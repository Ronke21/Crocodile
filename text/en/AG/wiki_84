<text>Vanilla is a spice derived from orchids of the genus &quot;Vanilla&quot;, primarily obtained from pods of the flat-leaved vanilla (&quot;V. planifolia&quot;).

&quot;Vanilla&quot; is not autogamous, so pollination is required to make the plants produce the fruit from which the vanilla spice is obtained. In 1837, Belgian botanist Charles François Antoine Morren discovered this fact and pioneered a method of artificially pollinating the plant. The method proved financially unworkable and was not deployed commercially. In 1841, Edmond Albius, a 12-year-old slave who lived on the French island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean, discovered that the plant could be hand-pollinated. Hand-pollination allowed global cultivation of the plant. Noted French botanist and plant collector Jean Michel Claude Richard falsely claimed to have discovered the technique three or four years earlier. By the end of the 20th century, Albius was considered the true discoverer.

Three major species of vanilla currently are grown globally, all derived from a species originally found in Mesoamerica, including parts of modern-day Mexico. They are &quot;V. planifolia&quot; (syn. &quot;V. fragrans&quot;), grown on Madagascar, Réunion, and other tropical areas along the Indian Ocean; &quot;V. × tahitensis&quot;, grown in the South Pacific; and &quot;V. pompona&quot;, found in the West Indies, Central America, and South America. The majority of the world&#x27;s vanilla is the &quot;V. planifolia&quot; species, more commonly known as &quot;Bourbon vanilla&quot; (after the former name of Réunion, Île Bourbon) or &quot;Madagascar vanilla&quot;, which is produced in Madagascar and neighboring islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean, and in Indonesia. Madagascar&#x27;s and Indonesia&#x27;s cultivations produce two-thirds of the world&#x27;s supply of vanilla.

Measured by weight, vanilla is the second-most expensive spice after saffron, because growing the vanilla seed pods is labor-intensive. Nevertheless, vanilla is widely used in both commercial and domestic baking, perfume production, and aromatherapy, as only small amounts are needed to impart its signature flavor and aroma.

==History==
&quot;Vanilla planifolia&quot; traditionally grew wild around the Gulf of Mexico from Tampico around to the northeast tip of South America, and from Colima to Ecuador on the Pacific side, as well as throughout the Caribbean. The Totonac people, who live along the eastern coast of Mexico in the present-day state of Veracruz, were among the first people to domesticate vanilla, cultivated on farms since at least 1185. The Totonac used vanilla as a fragrance in temples and as a good-luck charm in amulets, as well as flavoring for food and beverages. The cultivation of vanilla was a low-profile affair, as few people from outside these regions knew of it.

Although the Totonacs are the most famously associated with human use of vanilla, it is speculated that the Olmecs, who also lived in the regions of wild vanilla growth thousands of years earlier, were one of the first people to use wild vanilla in cuisine.

Aztecs from the central highlands of Mexico invaded the Totonacs in 1427, developed a taste for the vanilla pods, and began using vanilla to flavor their foods and drinks, often mixing it with cocoa in a drink called &quot;xocolatl&quot; that later inspired modern hot chocolate. The fruit was named &quot;tlilxochitl&quot;, wrongly interpreted as &quot;black flower&quot; instead of the more probable &quot;black pod&quot; because the matured fruit shrivels and turns a dark color shortly after being picked. For the Aztecs, much like earlier Mesoamerican peoples before them, it is probable that vanilla was used to tame the otherwise bitter taste of cacao, as sugarcane was not harvested in these regions at the time and there were no other sweeteners available.

Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s. In Europe, vanilla was seen mostly as an additive to chocolate until the early 17th century when Hugh Morgan, a creative apothecary in the employ of Queen Elizabeth I, created chocolate-free, vanilla-flavored &quot;sweetmeats&quot;. By the 18th century, the French were using vanilla to flavor ice cream.

Until the mid-19th century, Mexico was the chief producer of vanilla. One of Mexico&#x27;s top producing regions was Veracruz, especially in the town of Papantla. By 1889, Mexican exports of vanilla exceeded 70,000 kilograms making the region one of the world leaders in vanilla production at the time. While vanilla trade was surging throughout Papantla, many farmers who owned land on which this commodity was growing would soon be subject to political shifts that led to those farmers having to pay rent. Protests of these shifts in policy led many to fight and die against the four tier hierarchy made up of Totonac caciques, ranchero clans, a hefty class of landowning labradores, and a bulging stratum of tenants, jornaleros, and ranch hands. In 1819, French entrepreneurs shipped vanilla fruits to the islands of Réunion and Mauritius in hopes of producing vanilla there. After 1841, when Edmond Albius discovered how to pollinate the flowers quickly by hand, the pods began to thrive. Soon, the tropical orchids were sent from Réunion to the Comoros Islands, Seychelles, and Madagascar, along with instructions for pollinating them. By 1898, Madagascar, Réunion, and the Comoros Islands produced 200 metric tons of vanilla beans, about 80% of world production in that year. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization 2019 data, Madagascar, followed by Indonesia, were the largest producers of vanilla in 2018.
After a tropical cyclone ravaged key croplands, the market price of vanilla rose sharply in the late 1970s and remained high through the early 1980s despite the introduction of Indonesian vanilla. In the mid-1980s, the cartel that had controlled vanilla prices and distribution since its creation in 1930 disbanded. Prices dropped 70% over the next few years, to nearly US$20 per kilogram; prices rose sharply again after tropical cyclone Hudah struck Madagascar in April 2000. The cyclone, political instability, and poor weather in the third year drove vanilla prices to US$500/kg in 2004, bringing new countries into the vanilla industry. A good crop, coupled with decreased demand caused by the production of imitation vanilla, pushed the market price down to the $40/kg range in the middle of 2005. By 2010, prices were down to $20/kg. Cyclone Enawo caused a similar spike to $500/kg in 2017.

An estimated 95% of &quot;vanilla&quot; products are artificially flavored with vanillin derived from lignin instead of vanilla fruits.

Although vanilla was domesticated in Mesoamerica and subsequently spread to the Old World, the use of an unidentified, Old World-endemic &quot;Vanilla&quot; species is attested in Canaan/Israel during the Middle Bronze Age and later. Traces of vanillin were found in wine jars in Jerusalem, which were used by the Judahite elite before the city was destroyed in 586 BCE.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;vanilla&quot; is derived from the Spanish word meaning &quot;little pod&quot;, the diminutive of &quot;vaina&quot; derived from the Latin &quot;vagina&quot; (sheath) describing the shape of the pods. The word &quot;vanilla&quot; entered the English language in 1754, when the botanist Philip Miller wrote about the genus in his &quot;Gardener’s Dictionary&quot;.

==Biology==

===Vanilla orchid===


The main species of vanilla cultivated is &quot;V. planifolia&quot;. Although it is native to Mesoamerica and South America, it is now widely grown throughout the tropics. Indonesia and Madagascar are the world&#x27;s largest producers. Additional sources include &quot;V. pompona&quot; and &quot;V. tahitiensis&quot; (grown in Niue and Tahiti), although the vanillin content of these species is much less than &quot;V. planifolia&quot;.

Vanilla grows as a vine, climbing up an existing tree (also called a tutor), pole, or other support. It can be grown in a wood (on trees), in a plantation (on trees or poles), or in a &quot;shader&quot;, in increasing orders of productivity. Its growth environment is referred to as its &quot;terroir&quot;, and includes not only the adjacent plants, but also the climate, geography, and local geology. Left alone, it will grow as high as possible on the support, with few flowers. Every year, growers fold the higher parts of the plant downward so the plant stays at heights accessible by a standing human. This also greatly stimulates flowering.

The distinctively flavored compounds are found in the fruit, which results from the pollination of the flower. These seed pods are roughly a third of an inch (8 mm) by six inches (15 cm), and brownish red to black when ripe. Inside of these pods is an oily liquid full of tiny seeds. One flower produces one fruit. &quot;V. planifolia&quot; flowers are hermaphroditic: they carry both male (anther) and female (stigma) organs. However, self-pollination is blocked by a membrane which separates those organs.

Despite various claims otherwise, the only pollinators definitively documented to date are orchid bees in the genus &quot;Eulaema&quot; and the Western honey bee. All commercial vanilla production takes place via hand pollination by humans.

The first vanilla orchid to flower in Europe was in the London collection of the Honourable Charles Greville in 1806. Cuttings from that plant went to Netherlands and Paris, from which the French first transplanted the vines to their overseas colonies. The vines grew, but would not fruit outside Mexico. The only known way to produce fruits is artificial pollination. Today, even in Mexico, hand pollination is used extensively. In 1837, botanist Charles François Antoine Morren began experimenting with hand pollination of &quot;Vanilla&quot; orchids in cultivation in Europe. The method proved financially unworkable and was not deployed commercially. A few years later in 1841, a simple and efficient artificial hand-pollination method was developed by a 12-year-old slave named Edmond Albius on Réunion, a method still used today. Using a beveled sliver of bamboo, an agricultural worker lifts the membrane separating the anther and the stigma, then, using the thumb, transfers the pollinia from the anther to the stigma. The flower, self-pollinated, will then produce a fruit. The vanilla flower lasts about one day, sometimes less, so growers have to inspect their plantations every day for open flowers, a labor-intensive task.

The fruit, a seed capsule, if left on the plant, ripens and opens at the end; as it dries, the phenolic compounds crystallize, giving the fruits a diamond-dusted appearance, which the French call &quot;givre&quot; (hoarfrost). It then releases the distinctive vanilla smell. The fruit contains tiny, black seeds. In dishes prepared with whole natural vanilla, these seeds are recognizable as black specks. Both the pod and the seeds are used in cooking.

Like other orchids&#x27; seeds, vanilla seeds will not germinate without the presence of certain mycorrhizal fungi. Instead, growers reproduce the plant by cutting: they remove sections of the vine with six or more leaf nodes, a root opposite each leaf. The two lower leaves are removed, and this area is buried in loose soil at the base of support. The remaining upper roots cling to the support, and often grow down into the soil. Growth is rapid under good conditions.

===Cultivars===
* Bourbon vanilla or Bourbon-Madagascar vanilla, produced from &quot;V. planifolia&quot; plants introduced from the Americas, is from Indian Ocean islands such as Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius and Réunion, formerly named the Île Bourbon. It is also used to describe the distinctive vanilla flavor derived from &quot;V. planifolia&quot; grown successfully in tropical countries such as India. However, there is no Bourbon whiskey in Bourbon vanilla extract, despite common confusion about this.
* Mexican vanilla, made from the native &quot;V. planifolia&quot;, is produced in much less quantity and marketed as the vanilla from the land of its origin.
* Tahitian vanilla is from French Polynesia, made with &quot;V. tahitensis&quot;. Genetic analysis shows this species is possibly a cultivar from a hybrid of &quot;V. planifolia&quot; and &quot;V. odorata&quot;. The species was introduced by French Admiral François Alphonse Hamelin to French Polynesia from the Philippines, where it was introduced from Guatemala by the Manila Galleon trade. It comprises less than one percent of vanilla production and is only grown by a handful of skilled growers and preparers.
* West Indian vanilla is made from &quot;V. pompona&quot; grown in the Caribbean and Central and South America.

The term &quot;French vanilla&quot; is often used to designate particular preparations with a strong vanilla aroma, containing vanilla grains and sometimes also containing eggs (especially egg yolks). The appellation originates from the French style of making vanilla ice cream with a custard base, using vanilla pods, cream, and egg yolks. Inclusion of vanilla varietals from any of the former French dependencies or overseas France may be a part of the flavoring. Alternatively, French vanilla is taken to refer to a vanilla-custard flavor.

===Chemistry===

Vanilla essence occurs in two forms. Real seedpod extract is a complex mixture of several hundred different compounds, including vanillin, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, furfural, hexanoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, eugenol, methyl cinnamate, and isobutyric acid. Synthetic essence consists of a solution of synthetic vanillin in ethanol. The chemical compound vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) is a major contributor to the characteristic flavor and aroma of real vanilla and is the main flavor component of cured vanilla beans. Vanillin was first isolated from vanilla pods by Gobley in 1858. By 1874, it had been obtained from glycosides of pine tree sap, temporarily causing a depression in the natural vanilla industry. Vanillin can be easily synthesized from various raw materials, but the majority of food-grade (&gt; 99% pure) vanillin is made from guaiacol.

==Cultivation==

In general, quality vanilla only comes from good vines and through careful production methods. Commercial vanilla production can be performed under open field and &quot;greenhouse&quot; operations. The two production systems share these similarities:

* Plant height and number of years before producing the first grains
* Shade necessities
* Amount of organic matter needed
* A tree or frame to grow around (bamboo, coconut or &quot;Erythrina lanceolata&quot;)
* Labor intensity (pollination and harvest activities)

Vanilla grows best in a hot, humid climate from sea level to an elevation of 1,500 m. The ideal climate has moderate rainfall, 1,500–3,000 mm, evenly distributed through 10 months of the year. Optimum temperatures for cultivation are during the day and during the night. Ideal humidity is around 80%, and under normal greenhouse conditions, it can be achieved by an evaporative cooler. However, since greenhouse vanilla is grown near the equator and under polymer (HDPE) netting (shading of 50%), this humidity can be achieved by the environment. Most successful vanilla growing and processing is done in the region within 10 to 20° of the equator.

Soils for vanilla cultivation should be loose, with high organic matter content and loamy texture. They must be well drained, and a slight slope helps in this condition. Soil pH has not been well documented, but some researchers have indicated an optimum soil pH around 5.3. Mulch is very important for proper growth of the vine, and a considerable portion of mulch should be placed in the base of the vine. Fertilization varies with soil conditions, but general recommendations are: 40 to 60 g of N, 20 to 30 g of P2O5 and 60 to 100 g of K2O should be applied to each plant per year besides organic manures, such as vermicompost, oil cakes, poultry manure, and wood ash. Foliar applications are also good for vanilla, and a solution of 1% NPK (17:17:17) can be sprayed on the plant once a month. Vanilla requires organic matter, so three or four applications of mulch a year are adequate for the plant.

===Propagation, preparation and type of stock===
Dissemination of vanilla can be achieved either by stem cutting or by tissue culture. For stem cutting, a progeny garden needs to be established. All plants need to grow under 50% shade, as well as the rest of the crop. Mulching the trenches with coconut husk and micro irrigation provide an ideal microclimate for vegetative growth. Cuttings between should be selected for planting in the field or greenhouse. Cuttings below need to be rooted and raised in a separate nursery before planting. Planting material should always come from unflowered portions of the vine. Wilting of the cuttings before planting provides better conditions for root initiation and establishment.

Before planting the cuttings, trees to support the vine must be planted at least three months before sowing the cuttings. Pits of 30 × 30 × 30 cm are dug away from the tree and filled with farm yard manure (vermicompost), sand and top soil mixed well. An average of 2000 cuttings can be planted per hectare (2.5 acres). One important consideration is that when planting the cuttings from the base, four leaves should be pruned and the pruned basal point must be pressed into the soil in a way such that the nodes are in close contact with the soil, and are placed at a depth of . The top portion of the cutting is tied to the tree using natural fibers such as banana or hemp.

===Tissue culture===
Tissue culture was first used as a means of creating vanilla plants during the 1980s at Tamil Nadu University. This was the part of the first project to grow &quot;V. planifolia&quot; in India. At that time, a shortage of vanilla planting stock was occurring in India. The approach was inspired by the work going on to tissue culture other flowering plants. Several methods have been proposed for vanilla tissue culture, but all of them begin from axillary buds of the vanilla vine. In vitro multiplication has also been achieved through culture of callus masses, protocorms, root tips and stem nodes. Description of any of these processes can be obtained from the references listed before, but all of them are successful in generation of new vanilla plants that first need to be grown up to a height of at least before they can be planted in the field or greenhouse.

===Scheduling considerations===
In the tropics, the ideal time for planting vanilla is from September to November, when the weather is neither too rainy nor too dry, but this recommendation varies with growing conditions. Cuttings take one to eight weeks to establish roots, and show initial signs of growth from one of the leaf axils. A thick mulch of leaves should be provided immediately after planting as an additional source of organic matter. Three years are required for cuttings to grow enough to produce flowers and subsequent pods. As with most orchids, the blossoms grow along stems branching from the main vine. The buds, growing along the stems, bloom and mature in sequence, each at a different interval.

===Pollination===

Flowering normally occurs every spring, and without pollination, the blossom wilts and falls, and no vanilla bean can grow. In the wild in the New World, the only organisms ever observed to carry &quot;Vanilla&quot; pollen are orchid bees in the genus &quot;Eulaema&quot;, though direct evidence documenting seed set is lacking. Claims that pollination is achieved by stingless bees of the genus &quot;Melipona&quot; or hummingbirds have never been substantiated, though they do visit the flowers. Even within the range of orchid bees, wild vanilla orchids have only a 1% chance of successful pollination. As a result, all vanilla grown today is pollinated by hand. Each flower must be hand-pollinated within 12 hours of opening. A small splinter of wood or a grass stem is used to lift the rostellum or move the flap upward, so the overhanging anther can be pressed against the stigma and self-pollinate the vine. Generally, one flower per raceme opens per day, so the raceme may be in flower for over 20 days. A healthy vine should produce about 50 to 100 beans per year, but growers are careful to pollinate only five or six flowers from the 20 on each raceme. The first flowers that open in each raceme are usually the only ones that are pollinated, so the resulting beans are similar in age and mature together. This agronomic practice facilitates harvest and increases bean quality, as over-pollination results in diseases and inferior bean quality. The fruits require five to six weeks to develop, but around six months to mature. A vine remains productive between 12 and 14 years.

===Pest and disease management===
Vanilla is susceptible to many fungal and viral diseases. &quot;Fusarium&quot;, &quot;Sclerotium&quot;, &quot;Phytophthora&quot;, and &quot;Colletrotrichum&quot; species cause rots of root, stem, leaf, bean, and shoot apex. Development of most diseases is favoured by unsuitable growing conditions such as overwatering, insufficient drainage, heavy mulch, overpollination, and too much shade. Fungal diseases can be controlled by spraying Bordeaux mixture (1%), carbendazim (0.2%) and copper oxychloride (0.2%).

Biological control of the spread of such diseases can be managed by applying to the soil &quot;Trichoderma&quot; ( per plant in the rhizosphere) and foliar application of pseudomonas (0.2%). Mosaic virus, leaf curl, and cymbidium mosaic potexvirus are the common viral diseases. These diseases are transmitted through the sap, so affected plants must be destroyed. The insect pests of vanilla include beetles and weevils that attack the flower, caterpillars, snakes, and slugs that damage the tender parts of shoot, flower buds, and immature fruit, and grasshoppers that affect cutting shoot tips. If organic agriculture is practiced, insecticides are avoided, and mechanical measures are adopted for pest management. Most of these practices are implemented under greenhouse cultivation, since such field conditions are very difficult to achieve.

===Artificial vanilla===
Most artificial vanilla products contain vanillin, which can be produced synthetically from lignin, a natural polymer found in wood. Most synthetic vanillin is a byproduct from the pulp used in papermaking, in which the lignin is broken down using sulfites or sulfates. However, vanillin is only one of 171 identified aromatic components of real vanilla fruits.

The orchid species &quot;Leptotes bicolor&quot; is used as a natural vanilla replacement in Paraguay and southern Brazil.

In 1996 the US Food and Drug Administration cautioned that some vanilla products sold in Mexico were made from the cheaper tonka bean which as well as vanillin also contains the toxin coumarin. They advised consumers to always check the ingredients label and avoid suspiciously cheap products.

===Nonplant vanilla flavoring===
In the United States, castoreum, the exudate from the castor sacs of mature beavers, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a food additive, often referenced simply as a &quot;natural flavoring&quot; in the product&#x27;s list of ingredients. It is used in both food and beverages, especially as vanilla and raspberry flavoring, with a total annual U.S. production of less than 300 pounds. It is also used to flavor some cigarettes and in perfume-making, and is used by fur trappers as a scent lure.

===Harvest===
Harvesting vanilla fruits is as labor-intensive as pollinating the blossoms. Immature, dark green pods are not harvested. Pale yellow discoloration that commences at the distal end of the fruits is not a good indication of the maturity of pods. Each fruit ripens at its own time, requiring a daily harvest. &quot;Current methods for determining the maturity of vanilla (&quot;Vanilla planifolia&quot; Andrews) beans are unreliable. Yellowing at the blossom end, the current index, occurs before beans accumulate maximum glucovanillin concentrations. Beans left on the vine until they turn brown have higher glucovanillin concentrations but may split and have low quality. Judging bean maturity is difficult as they reach full size soon after pollination. Glucovanillin accumulates from 20 weeks, maximum about 40 weeks after pollination. Mature green beans have 20% dry matter but less than 2% glucovanillin.&quot; The accumulation of dry matter and glucovanillin are highly correlated. To ensure the finest flavor from every fruit, each individual pod must be picked by hand just as it begins to split on the end. Overmatured fruits are likely to split, causing a reduction in market value. Its commercial value is fixed based on the length and appearance of the pod.

If the fruit is more than in length, it is categorized as first-quality. The largest fruits greater than and up to as much as are usually reserved for the gourmet vanilla market, for sale to top chefs and restaurants. If the fruits are between 10 and 15 cm long, pods are in the second-quality category, and fruits less than in length are in the third-quality category. Each fruit contains thousands of tiny black vanilla seeds. Vanilla fruit yield depends on the care and management given to the hanging and fruiting vines. Any practice directed to stimulate aerial root production has a direct effect on vine productivity. A five-year-old vine can produce between of pods, and this production can increase up to after a few years. The harvested green fruit can be commercialized as such or cured to get a better market price.

===Curing===
Several methods exist in the market for curing vanilla; nevertheless, all of them consist of four basic steps: killing, sweating, slow-drying, and conditioning of the beans.

====Killing====
The vegetative tissue of the vanilla pod is killed to stop the vegetative growth of the pods and disrupt the cells and tissue of the fruits, which initiates enzymatic reactions responsible for the aroma. The method of killing varies, but may be accomplished by heating in hot water, freezing, or scratching, or killing by heating in an oven or exposing the beans to direct sunlight. The different methods give different profiles of enzymatic activity.

Testing has shown mechanical disruption of fruit tissues can cause curing processes, including the degeneration of glucovanillin to vanillin, so the reasoning goes that disrupting the tissues and cells of the fruit allow enzymes and enzyme substrates to interact.

Hot-water killing may consist of dipping the pods in hot water () for three minutes, or at for 10 seconds. In scratch killing, fruits are scratched along their length. Frozen or quick-frozen fruits must be thawed again for the subsequent sweating stage. Tied in bundles and rolled in blankets, fruits may be placed in an oven at for 36 to 48 hours. Exposing the fruits to sunlight until they turn brown, a method originating in Mexico, was practiced by the Aztecs.

====Sweating====
Sweating is a hydrolytic and oxidative process. Traditionally, it consists of keeping fruits, for 7 to 10 days, densely stacked and insulated in wool or other cloth. This retains a temperature of and high humidity. Daily exposure to the sun may also be used, or dipping the fruits in hot water. The fruits are brown and have attained much of the characteristic vanilla flavor and aroma by the end of this process, but still retain a 60–70% moisture content by weight.

====Drying====
Reduction of the beans to 25–30% moisture by weight, to prevent rotting and to lock the aroma in the pods, is always achieved by some exposure of the beans to air, and usually (and traditionally) intermittent shade and sunlight. Fruits may be laid out in the sun during the mornings and returned to their boxes in the afternoons, or spread on a wooden rack in a room for three to four weeks, sometimes with periods of sun exposure. Drying is the most problematic of the curing stages; unevenness in the drying process can lead to the loss of vanillin content of some fruits by the time the others are cured.

====Conditioning====
Conditioning is performed by storing the pods for five to six months in closed boxes, where the fragrance develops. The processed fruits are sorted, graded, bundled, and wrapped in paraffin paper and preserved for the development of desired bean qualities, especially flavor and aroma. The cured vanilla fruits contain an average of 2.5% vanillin.

===Grading===

Once fully cured, the vanilla fruits are sorted by quality and graded. Several vanilla fruit grading systems are in use. Each country which produces vanilla has its own grading system, and individual vendors, in turn, sometimes use their own criteria for describing the quality of the fruits they offer for sale. In general, vanilla fruit grade is based on the length, appearance (color, sheen, presence of any splits, presence of blemishes), and moisture content of the fruit. Whole, dark, plump and oily pods that are visually attractive, with no blemishes, and that have a higher moisture content are graded most highly. Such pods are particularly prized by chefs for their appearance and can be featured in gourmet dishes. Beans that show localized signs of disease or other physical defects are cut to remove the blemishes; the shorter fragments left are called &quot;cuts&quot; and are assigned lower grades, as are fruits with lower moisture contents. Lower-grade fruits tend to be favored for uses in which the appearance is not as important, such as in the production of vanilla flavoring extract and in the fragrance industry.

Higher-grade fruits command higher prices in the market. However, because grade is so dependent on visual appearance and moisture content, fruits with the highest grade do not necessarily contain the highest concentration of characteristic flavor molecules such as vanillin, and are not necessarily the most flavorful.
† &quot;moisture content varies among sources cited&quot;

A simplified, alternative grading system has been proposed for classifying vanilla fruits suitable for use in cooking:

Under this scheme, vanilla extract is normally made from Grade B fruits.

==Production==

In 2020, world production of vanilla was 7,614 tonnes, led by Madagascar with 39.1% of the total, and Indonesia with 30.3% (table). Due to drought, cyclones, and poor farming practices in Madagascar, there were concerns about the global supply and costs of vanilla in 2017 and 2018. The intensity of criminal enterprises against Madagascar farmers is high, elevating the worldwide cost of using Madagascar vanilla in consumer products.

==Uses==

The four main commercial preparations of natural vanilla are:

* Whole pod
* Powder (ground pods, kept pure or blended with sugar, starch, or other ingredients)
* Extract (in alcoholic or occasionally glycerol solution; both pure and imitation forms of vanilla contain at least 35% alcohol)
* Vanilla sugar, a packaged mix of sugar and vanilla extract

Vanilla flavoring in food may be achieved by adding vanilla extract or by cooking vanilla pods in the liquid preparation. A stronger aroma may be attained if the pods are split in two, exposing more of a pod&#x27;s surface area to the liquid. In this case, the pods&#x27; seeds are mixed into the preparation. Natural vanilla gives a brown or yellow color to preparations, depending on the concentration. Good-quality vanilla has a strong, aromatic flavor, but food with small amounts of low-quality vanilla or artificial vanilla-like flavorings are far more common, since true vanilla is much more expensive.

Regarded as the world&#x27;s most popular aroma and flavor, vanilla is a widely used aroma and flavor compound for foods, beverages and cosmetics, as indicated by its popularity as an ice cream flavor (as of 2004, around half of vanilla flavor consumed in the US was eaten in ice cream). Although vanilla is a prized flavoring agent on its own, it is also used to enhance the flavor of other substances, to which its own flavor is often complementary, such as chocolate, custard, caramel, coffee, and others. Vanilla is a common ingredient in Western sweet baked goods, such as cookies and cakes. Despite the expense, vanilla is highly valued for its flavor. 

The food industry uses methyl and ethyl vanillin as less-expensive substitutes for real vanilla. Ethyl vanillin is more expensive, but has a stronger note. &quot;Cook&#x27;s Illustrated&quot; ran several taste tests pitting vanilla against vanillin in baked goods and other applications, and to the consternation of the magazine editors, tasters could not differentiate the flavor of vanillin from vanilla; however, for the case of vanilla ice cream, natural vanilla won out. A more recent and thorough test by the same group produced a more interesting variety of results; namely, high-quality artificial vanilla flavoring is best for cookies, while high-quality real vanilla is slightly better for cakes and significantly better for unheated or lightly heated foods.

The liquid extracted from vanilla pods was once believed to have medical properties, helping with various stomach ailments.

==Contact dermatitis==
The sap of most species of vanilla orchid which exudes from cut stems or where beans are harvested can cause moderate to severe dermatitis if it comes in contact with bare skin. The sap of vanilla orchids contains calcium oxalate crystals, which are thought to be the main causative agent of contact dermatitis in vanilla plantation workers.

<text>Video editing software or a video editor is software used for performing the post-production video editing of digital video sequences on a non-linear editing system (NLE). It has replaced traditional flatbed celluloid film editing tools and analog video tape editing machines.

Video editing software serves a lot of purposes, such as filmmaking, audio commentary, and general editing of video content.

In NLE software, the user manipulates sections of video, images, and audio on a sequence. These clips can be trimmed, cut, and manipulated in many different ways. When editing is finished, the user exports the sequence as a video file.

==Components==

===Timeline===

NLE software is typically based on a timeline interface where sections moving image video recordings, known as clips, are laid out in sequence and played back. The NLE offers a range of tools for trimming, splicing, cutting, and arranging clips across the timeline.

Another kind of clip is a text clip, used to add text to a video, such as title screens or movie credits. Audio clips can additionally be mixed together, such as mixing a soundtrack with multiple sound effects.

Typically, the timeline is divided into multiple rows on the y-axis for different clips playing simultaneously, whereas the x-axis represents the run time of the video.

Effects such as transitions can be performed on each clip, such as a crossfade effect going from one scene to another.

===Exporting===

Since video editors represent a project with a file format specific to the program, one needs to export the video file in order to publish it.

Once a project is complete, the editor can then export to movies in a variety of formats in a context that may range from broadcast tape formats to compressed video files for web publishing (such as on an online video platform or personal website), optical media, or saved to mobile devices.

To facilitate editing, source video typically has a higher resolution than the desired output. Therefore, higher resolution video needs to be downscaled during exporting, or after exporting in a process known as transsizing.

===Visual effects===


As digital video editing advanced, visual effects became possible, and is part of the standard toolkit, usually found in prosumer and professional grade software.

A common ability is to do compositing techniques such as chroma keying or luma keying, among others, which allow different objects to look as if they are in the same scene.

A different kind of visual effects is motion capture. Software such as Blender can perform motion capture to make animated objects follow an actor&#x27;s movements.

===Additional features===

Most professional video editors are able to do color grading, which is to manipulate visual attributes of a video such as contrast to enhance output, and improve emotional impact.

Some video editors such as iMovie include stock footage available for use.

==Hardware requirements==
As video editing puts great demands on storage and graphics performance, especially at high resolutions such as 4K, and for videos with many visual effects, powerful hardware is often required.

It is not uncommon for a computer built for video editing to have a lot of drive capacity, and a powerful graphics processing unit, which optimally has hardware accelerated video encoding.

Having sufficient disk space is important since videos can take up large amounts of storage, depending on the resolution and compression format used. Each minute of a Full HD (1080p) video at 30 fps takes up 60MB of space.

When visual effects are used, a server farm can be employed to speed up the rendering process.

==Examples==
Video editing software can be divided into consumer grade, which focuses on ease-of-use, along with professional grade software, which focuses on feature availability, and advanced editing techniques. The typical use case for the former is to edit personal videos on the go, when more advanced editing is not required.

While most video editing software has been separate from the operating systems, some operating systems have had a video editor installed by default, such as Windows Movie Maker in Windows XP, or as a component of the default photo viewer, such as the Photos app on iOS.

Some social media platforms, such as TikTok and Instagram may include a rudimentary video editor to trim clips.

<text>VisiCalc (&quot;visible calculator&quot;) is the first spreadsheet computer program for personal computers, originally released for the Apple II by VisiCorp on October 17, 1979. It is considered the killer application for the Apple II, turning the microcomputer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a serious business tool, and then prompting IBM to introduce the IBM PC two years later. More than 700,000 copies were sold in six years, and up to 1 million copies over its history. 

Initially developed for the Apple II computer using a 6502 assembler running on the Multics time-sharing system, VisiCalc was ported to numerous platforms, both 8-bit and some of the early 16-bit systems. To do this, the company developed porting platforms that produced bug compatible versions. The company took the same approach when the IBM PC was launched, producing a product that was essentially identical to the original 8-bit Apple II version. Sales were initially brisk, with about 300,000 copies sold. 

VisiCalc uses the A1 notation in formulas.

When Lotus 1-2-3 was launched in 1983, taking full advantage of the expanded memory and screen of the IBM PC, VisiCalc sales declined so rapidly that the company was soon insolvent. In 1985, Lotus Development purchased the company and ended sales of VisiCalc.

==History==
Dan Bricklin conceived of VisiCalc while watching a presentation at Harvard Business School. The professor was creating a financial model on a blackboard that was ruled with vertical and horizontal lines (resembling accounting paper) to create a table, and he wrote formulas and data into the cells. When the professor found an error or wanted to change a parameter, he had to erase and rewrite several sequential entries in the table. Bricklin realized that he could replicate the process on a computer using an &quot;electronic spreadsheet&quot; to view results of underlying formulae.

Bob Frankston joined Bricklin at 231 Broadway, Arlington, Massachusetts, and the pair formed the Software Arts company, and developed the VisiCalc program in two months during the winter of 1978–79. Bricklin wrote:
Bricklin was referring to the variety of report generators that were in use at that time, including Business Planning Language (BPL) from International Timesharing Corporation (ITS) and Foresight from Foresight Systems. However, these earlier timesharing programs were not completely interactive, and they pre-dated personal computers.

Frankston described VisiCalc as a &quot;magic sheet of paper that can perform calculations and recalculations [which] allows the user to just solve the problem using familiar tools and concepts&quot;. The Personal Software company began selling VisiCalc in mid-1979 for under , after a demonstration at the fourth West Coast Computer Faire and an official launch on June 4 at the National Computer Conference. It requires an Apple II with 32K of random-access memory (RAM), and supports saving files to magnetic tape cassette or to the Apple Disk II floppy disk system.

VisiCalc was unusually easy to use and came with excellent documentation. Apple&#x27;s developer documentation cited the software as an example of one with a simple user interface. Observers immediately noticed its power. Ben Rosen speculated in July 1979, that &quot;VisiCalc could someday become the software tail that wags (and sells) the personal computer dog&quot;. For the first 12 months, it was only available for Apple II, and became its killer app. John Markoff wrote that the computer was sold as a &quot;VisiCalc accessory&quot;, and many bought Apple computers to run the $100 software — more than 25% of those sold in 1979 were reportedly for VisiCalc — even if they already owned other computers. Steve Wozniak said that small businesses, not the hobbyists he and Steve Jobs had expected, purchased 90% of Apple IIs. Apple&#x27;s rival Tandy Corporation used VisiCalc on Apple IIs at their headquarters. Other software supports its Data Interchange Format (DIF) to share data. One example is the Microsoft BASIC interpreter supplied with most microcomputers that ran VisiCalc. This allowed skilled BASIC programmers to write features, such as trigonometric functions, that VisiCalc lacked.

Bricklin and Frankston originally intended to fit the program into 16k memory, but they later realized that the program needed at least 32k. Even 32k is too small to support some features that the creators wanted to include, such as a split screen for text and graphics. However, Apple eventually began shipping all Apple IIs with 48k memory following a drop in RAM prices, enabling the developers to include more features. The initial release supported tape cassette storage, but that was quickly dropped.

At VisiCalc&#x27;s release, Personal Software promised to port the program to other computers, starting with those with the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor, and versions appeared for Atari 8-bit computers and Commodore PET. Both of those were easy, because those computers have the same CPU as Apple II, and large portions of code were reused. The PET version, which contains two separate executables for 40 and 80-column models, was widely criticized for having a very small amount of worksheet space due to the developers&#x27; inclusion of their own custom DOS, which uses a large amount of memory. The PET only has 32k versus Apple II&#x27;s available 48k.

Other ports followed for Apple III, the Zilog Z80-based Tandy TRS-80 Model I, Model II, Model III, Model 4, and Sony SMC-70. The TRS-80 Model I and Sony SMC-70 ports are the only versions of VisiCalc without copy protection. The HP 125 and Sony SMC-70 ports are the only CP/M version. Most versions are disk-based, but the PET VisiCalc came with a ROM chip that the user must install in one of the motherboard&#x27;s expansion ROM sockets. The most important port is for the IBM PC, and VisiCalc became one of the first commercial packages available when the IBM PC shipped in 1981. It quickly became a best-seller on this platform, though severely limited to be compatible with the versions for the 8-bit platforms. It is estimated that 300,000 copies were sold on the PC, bringing total sales to about 1 million copies.

By 1982, VisiCalc&#x27;s price had risen from $100 to . Several competitors appeared in the market, such as SuperCalc and Multiplan, each of which have more features and corrected deficiencies in VisiCalc, but could not overcome its market dominance. A more dramatic change occurred with the 1983 launch of Lotus Development Corporation&#x27;s Lotus 1-2-3, created by former Personal Software/VisiCorp employee Mitch Kapor, who had written VisiTrend and VisiPlot. Unlike the IBM PC version of VisiCalc, 1-2-3 was written to take full advantage of the PC&#x27;s increased memory, screen, and performance. Yet it was designed to be as compatible as possible with VisiCalc, including the menu structure, to allow VisiCalc users to easily migrate to 1-2-3.

1-2-3 was almost immediately successful, and in 1984, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; wrote that sales of VisiCalc were &quot;rapidly declining&quot;, stating, that it was &quot;the first successful software product to have gone through a complete life cycle, from conception in 1978 to introduction in 1979 to peak success in 1982 to decline in 1983 to a probable death according to industry insiders in 1984&quot;. The magazine added that the company was slow to upgrade the software, only releasing an Advanced Version of VisiCalc for Apple II in 1983, and announcing one for the IBM PC in 1984. By 1985, VisiCorp was insolvent. Lotus Development acquired Software Arts, and ended sales of the application.

== Reception ==
In 1983, &quot;Softline&quot; readers named VisiCalc tenth overall and the highest non-game on the magazine&#x27;s Top Thirty list of Atari 8-bit programs by popularity. &quot;II Computing&quot; listed it second on the magazine&#x27;s list of top Apple II software as of late 1985, based on sales and market-share data.

In its 1980 review, &quot;BYTE&quot; wrote &quot;The most exciting and influential piece of software that has been written for any microcomputer application is VisiCalc [...] VisiCalc is the first program available on a microcomputer that has been responsible for sales of entire systems&quot;. &quot;Creative Computing&quot;″s review that year similarly concluded, &quot;for almost anyone in business, education, or any science-related field it is [...] reason enough to purchase a small computer system in the first place&quot;. &quot;Compute!&quot; reported, &quot;Every Visicalc user knows of someone who purchased an Apple just to be able to use Visicalc&quot;. &quot;Antic&quot; wrote in 1984, &quot;VisiCalc isn&#x27;t as easy to use as prepackaged home accounting programs, because you&#x27;re required to design both the layout and the formulas used by the program. Because it is not pre-packaged, however, it&#x27;s infinitely more powerful and flexible than such programs. You can use VisiCalc to balance your checkbook, keep track of credit card purchases, calculate your net worth, do your taxes—the possibilities are practically limitless.&quot; &quot;The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984&quot; gave the application an overall A+ rating, praising its documentation and calling it &quot;indispensable ... a straight &#x27;A&#x27; classic&quot;.

In 1999, Harvard Business School put up a plaque commemorating Dan Bricklin in the room where he had studied, saying, &quot;Forever changed how people use computers in business.&quot;

In 2006, Charles Babcock of &quot;InformationWeek&quot; wrote that, in retrospect, &quot;VisiCalc was flawed and clunky, and couldn&#x27;t do many things users wanted it to do&quot;, but also, &quot;It&#x27;s great because it demonstrated the power of personal computing.&quot;

Since 2010, the anniversary of the October 17, 1979, launch of VisiCalc has been celebrated as Spreadsheet Day.

== Legacy ==
VisiCalc is one of the earliest examples of metaphor-driven user interface design, due to its resemblance with paper spreadsheets. This metaphor made the program comprehensible and familiar to accountants, economists, and bookkeepers who were not used to using computers, and VisiCalc&#x27;s release marked the point where &quot;personal computers crossed the line from a hobbyist obsession to a compelling tool&quot;. Compared to paper spreadsheets, VisiCalc freed users to change numbers without having to recalculate the whole spreadsheet by hand, which, according to Steven Levy, &quot;changed the perception of a spreadsheet from a document of hard costs into a modeling tool by which one tested business scenarios&quot;.

<text>A video game console is an electronic device that outputs a video signal or image to display a video game that can typically be played with a game controller. These may be home consoles, which are generally placed in a permanent location connected to a television or other display devices and controlled with a separate game controller, or handheld consoles, which include their own display unit and controller functions built into the unit and which can be played anywhere. Hybrid consoles combine elements of both home and handheld consoles.

Video game consoles are a specialized form of a home computer geared towards video game playing, designed with affordability and accessibility to the general public in mind, but lacking in raw computing power and customization. Simplicity is achieved in part through the use of game cartridges or other simplified methods of distribution, easing the effort of launching a game. However, this leads to ubiquitous proprietary formats that create competition for market share. More recent consoles have shown further confluence with home computers, making it easy for developers to release games on multiple platforms. Further, modern consoles can serve as replacements for media players with capabilities to play films and music from optical media or streaming media services.

Video game consoles are usually sold on a five–seven year cycle called a generation, with consoles made with similar technical capabilities or made around the same time period grouped into one generation. The industry has developed a razor and blades model: manufacturers often sell consoles at low prices, sometimes at a loss, while primarily making a profit from the licensing fees for each game sold. Planned obsolescence then draws consumers into buying the next console generation. While numerous manufacturers have come and gone in the history of the console market, there have always been two or three dominant leaders in the market, with the current market led by Sony (with their PlayStation brand), Microsoft (with their Xbox brand), and Nintendo (currently producing the Switch console). Previous console developers include Sega, Atari, Coleco, Mattel, NEC, SNK, Fujitsu, and 3DO.

==History==

The first video game consoles were produced in the early 1970s. Ralph H. Baer devised the concept of playing simple, spot-based games on a television screen in 1966, which later became the basis of the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972. Inspired by the table tennis game on the Odyssey, Nolan Bushnell, Ted Dabney, and Allan Alcorn at Atari, Inc. developed the first successful arcade game, &quot;Pong&quot;, and looked to develop that into a home version, which was released in 1975. The first consoles were capable of playing only a very limited number of games built into the hardware. Programmable consoles using swappable ROM cartridges were introduced with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976, though popularized with the Atari 2600 released in 1977.

Handheld consoles emerged from technology improvements in handheld electronic games as these shifted from mechanical to electronic/digital logic, and away from light-emitting diode (LED) indicators to liquid-crystal displays (LCD) that resembled video screens more closely. Early examples include the Microvision in 1979 and Game &amp; Watch in 1980, and the concept was fully realized by the Game Boy in 1989.

Both home and handheld consoles have become more advanced following global changes in technology. These technological shifts include improved electronic and computer chip manufacturing to increase computational power at lower costs and size, the introduction of 3D graphics and hardware-based graphic processors for real-time rendering, digital communications such as the Internet, wireless networking and Bluetooth, and larger and denser media formats as well as digital distribution.

Following the same type of Moore&#x27;s law progression, home consoles are grouped into generations; each lasting approximately five years. Consoles within each generation share similar specifications and features, such as processor word size. While no one grouping of consoles by generation is universally accepted, one breakdown of generations, showing representative consoles, of each is shown below.

==Form factor==
===Home video game console===
Home video game consoles are meant to be connected to a television or other type of monitor, with power supplied through an outlet. This requires the unit to be used in a fixed location, typically at home in one&#x27;s living room. Separate game controllers, connected through wired or wireless connections, are used to provide input to the game. Early examples include the Atari 2600, the Nintendo Entertainment System, and the Sega Genesis; newer examples include the Wii U, the PlayStation 5, and the Xbox Series X.

===Microconsole===
A microconsole is a home video game console that is typically powered by low-cost computing hardware, making the console lower-priced compared to other home consoles on the market. The majority of microconsoles, with a few exceptions such as the PlayStation TV and OnLive Game System, are Android-based digital media players that are bundled with gamepads and marketed as gaming devices. Such microconsoles can be connected to the television to play video games downloaded from an application store such as Google Play.

===Handheld game console===
Handheld game consoles are devices that typically include a built-in screen and game controller in their case, and contain a rechargeable battery or battery compartment. This allows the unit to be carried around and played anywhere, in contrast to a home game console. Examples include the Game Boy, the PlayStation Portable, and the Nintendo 3DS.

===Hybrid video game console===
Hybrid video game consoles are devices that can be used either as a handheld or as a home console. They have either a wired connection or docking station that connects the console unit to a television screen and fixed power source, and the potential to use a separate controller. However, they can also be used as a handheld. While prior handhelds like the Sega Nomad and PlayStation Portable, or home consoles such as the Wii U, have had these features, some consider the Nintendo Switch to be the first true hybrid console.

==Functionality==
Most consoles are considered programmable consoles and have the means for the player to switch between different games. Traditionally, this has been done by switching a physical game cartridge or game card or by using optical media. It is now common to download games through digital distribution and store them on internal or external digital storage devices.

===Dedicated console===
Some consoles are considered dedicated consoles, in which games available for the console are &quot;baked&quot; onto the hardware, either by being programmed via the circuitry or set in the read-only flash memory of the console. Thus, the console&#x27;s game library cannot be added to or changed directly by the user. The user can typically switch between games on dedicated consoles using hardware switches on the console, or through in-game menus. Dedicated consoles were common in the first generation of home consoles, such as the Magnavox Odyssey and the home console version of &quot;Pong&quot;, and more recently have been used for retro style consoles such as the NES Classic Edition and Sega Genesis Mini.

Dedicated consoles were very popular in the first generation until they were gradually replaced by second generation that use ROM cartridges. The fourth generation gradually merged with optical media.

===Retro style console===

During the later part of video game history, there have been specialized consoles using computing components to offer multiple games to players. Most of these plug directly into one&#x27;s television, and thus are often called plug-and-play consoles. Most of them are also considered dedicated consoles since it is generally impossible to access the computing components by an average consumer, though tech-savvy consumers often have found ways to hack the console to install additional functionality, voiding the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty. Plug-and-play consoles usually come with the console unit itself, one or more controllers, and the required components for power and video hookup. Many recent plug-and-play releases have been for distributing a number of retro games for a specific console platform. Examples of these include the Atari Flashback series, the NES Classic Edition, Sega Genesis Mini and also handheld retro consoles such as the Nintendo Game &amp; Watch color screen series.

==Components==
===Console unit===
Early console hardware was designed as customized printed circuit boards (PCB)s, selecting existing integrated circuit chips that performed known functions, or programmable chips like erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) chips that could perform certain functions. Persistent computer memory was expensive, so dedicated consoles were generally limited to the use of processor registers for storage of the state of a game, thus limiting the complexities of such titles. &quot;Pong&quot; in both its arcade and home format, had a handful of logic and calculation chips that used the current input of the players&#x27; paddles and resisters storing the ball&#x27;s position to update the game&#x27;s state and send it to the display device. Even with more advanced integrated circuits (IC)s of the time, designers were limited to what could be done through the electrical process rather than through programming as normally associated with video game development.

Improvements in console hardware followed with improvements in microprocessor technology and semiconductor device fabrication. Manufacturing processes have been able to reduce the feature size on chips (typically measured in nanometers), allowing more transistors and other components to fit on a chip, and at the same time increasing the circuit speeds and the potential frequency the chip can run at, as well as reducing thermal dissipation. Chips were able to be made on larger dies, further increasing the number of features and effective processing power. Random-access memory became more practical with the higher density of transistors per chip, but to address the correct blocks of memory, processors needed to be updated to use larger word sizes and allot for larger bandwidth in chip communications. All these improvements did increase the cost of manufacturing, but at a rate far less than the gains in overall processing power, which helped to make home computers and consoles inexpensive for the consumer, all related to Moore&#x27;s law of technological improvements.

For the consoles of the 1980s to 1990s, these improvements were evident in the marketing in the late 1980s to 1990s during the &quot;bit wars&quot;, where console manufacturers had focused on their console&#x27;s processor&#x27;s word size as a selling point. Consoles since the 2000s are more similar to personal computers, building in memory, storage features, and networking capabilities to avoid the limitations of the past. The confluence with personal computers eased software development for both computer and console games, allowing developers to target both platforms. However, consoles differ from computers as most of the hardware components are preselected and customized between the console manufacturer and hardware component provider to assure a consistent performance target for developers. Whereas personal computer motherboards are designed with the needs for allowing consumers to add their desired selection of hardware components, the fixed set of hardware for consoles enables console manufacturers to optimize the size and design of the motherboard and hardware, often integrating key hardware components into the motherboard circuitry itself. Often, multiple components, such as the central processing unit and graphics processing unit, can be combined into a single chip, otherwise known as a system on a chip (SoC), which is a further reduction in size and cost. In addition, consoles tend to focus on components that give the unit high game performance, such as the CPU and GPU, and as a tradeoff to keep their prices in expected ranges, use less memory and storage space compared to typical personal computers.

In comparison to the early years of the industry, where most consoles were made directly by the company selling the console, many consoles of today are generally constructed through a value chain that includes component suppliers, such as AMD and NVidia for CPU and GPU functions, and contract manufacturers including electronics manufacturing services, factories which assemble those components into the final consoles such as Foxconn and Flextronics. Completed consoles are then usually tested, distributed, and repaired by the company itself. Microsoft and Nintendo both use this approach to their consoles, while Sony maintains all production in-house with the exception of their component suppliers.

Some of the commons elements that can be found within console hardware include:
;Motherboard
:The primary PCB that all of the main chips, including the CPU, are mounted on.

;Daughterboard
:A secondary PCB that connects to the motherboard that would be used for additional functions. These may include components that can be easily replaced later without having to replace the full motherboard.

;Central processing unit (CPU)
:The main processing chip on the console that performs most of the computational workload.
:The consoles&#x27; CPU is generally defined by its word size (such as 8-bit or 64-bit), and its clock speed or frequency in hertz. For some CPUs, the clock speed can be variable in response to software needs. In general, larger word sizes and faster clock sizes indicate better performance, but other factors will impact the actual speed.
:Another distinguishing feature for a console&#x27;s CPU is the instruction set architecture. The instruction set defines low-level machine code to be sent to the CPU to achieve specific results on the chip. Differences in the instruction set architecture of CPU of consoles of a given generation can make for difficulty in software portability. This had been used by manufacturers to keep software titles exclusive to their platform as one means to compete with others. Consoles prior to the sixth generation typically used chips that the hardware and software developers were most familiar with, but as personal computers stabilized on the x86 architecture, console manufacturers followed suit as to help easily port games between computer and console.
:Newer CPUs may also feature multiple processing cores, which are also identified in their specification. Multi-core CPUs allow for multithreading and parallel computing in modern games, such as one thread for managing the game&#x27;s rendering engine, one for the game&#x27;s physics engine, and another for evaluating the player&#x27;s input.

;Graphical processing unit (GPU)
:The processing unit that performs rendering of data from the CPU to the video output of the console.
:In the earlier console generations, this was generally limited to simple graphic processing routines, such as bitmapped graphics and manipulation of sprites, all otherwise involving integer mathematics while minimizing the amount of required memory needed to complete these routines, as memo. For example, the Atari 2600 used its own Television Interface Adaptor that handled video and audio, while the Nintendo Entertainment System used the Picture Processing Unit. For consoles, these GPUs were also designed to send the signal in the proper analog formation to a cathode ray television, NTSC (used in Japan and North America) or PAL (mostly used in Europe). These two formats differed by their refresh rates, 60 versus 50 Hertz, and consoles and games that were manufactured for PAL markets used the CPU and GPU at lower frequencies.
:The introduction of real-time polygonal 3D graphics rendering in the early 1990s—not just an innovation in video games for consoles but in arcade and personal computer games—led to the development of GPUs that were capable of performing the floating-point calculations needed for real-time 3D rendering. In contrast to the CPU, modern GPUs for consoles and computers, principally made by AMD and NVidia, are highly parallel computing devices with a number of compute units/streaming multiprocessors (depending on vendor, respectively) within a single chip. Each compute unit/microprocessor contains a scheduler, a number of subprocessing units, memory caches and buffers, and dispatching and collecting units which also may be highly parallel in nature. Modern console GPUs can be run at a different frequency from the CPU, even at variable frequencies to increases its processing power at the cost of higher energy draw. The performance of GPUs in consoles can be estimated through floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) and more commonly as in teraflops (TFLOPS = 1012 FLOPS). However, particularly for consoles, this is considered a rough number as several other factors such as the CPU, memory bandwidth, and console architecture can impact the GPU&#x27;s true performance.

;Coprocessors
:Additional processors used to handle other dedicated functions on the console. Many early consoles feature an audio coprocessor for example.

;Northbridge
:The processor unit that, outside of the CPU and GPU, typically manages the fastest processing elements on the computer. Typically this involves communication of data between the CPU, the GPU, and the on-board RAM, and subsequently sending and receiving information with the southbridge.

;Southbridge
:The counterpart of the northbridge, the southbridge is the processing unit that handles slower processing components of the console, typically those of input/output (I/O) with some internal storage and other connected devices like controllers.

;BIOS
:The console&#x27;s BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is the fundamental instruction set baked into a firmware chip on the console circuit board that the console uses when it is first turned on to direct operations. In older consoles, prior to the introduction of onboard storage, the BIOS effectively served as the console&#x27;s operating system, while in modern consoles, the BIOS is used to direct loading of the console&#x27;s operating system off internal memory.

;Random-access memory (RAM)
:Memory storage that is designed for fast reading and writing, often used in consoles to store large amounts of data about a game while it is being played to avoid reading from the slower game media. RAM memory typically does not sustain itself after the console is powered off. Besides the amount of RAM available, a key measurement of performance for consoles is the RAM&#x27;s bandwidth, how fast in terms of bytes per second that the RAM can be written and read from. This is data that must be transferred to and from the CPU and GPU quickly as needed without requiring these chips to need high memory caches themselves.

;Internal storage
:Newer consoles have included internal storage devices, such as flash memory, hard disk drives (HDD) and solid-state drives (SSD), to save data persistently. Early application of internal storage was for saving game states, and more recently can be used to store the console&#x27;s operating system, game patches and updates, games downloaded through the Internet, additional content for those games, and additional media such as purchased movies and music. Most consoles provide the means to manage the data on this storage while respecting the copyrights on the system. Newer consoles, such as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, use high-speed SSD&#x27;s not only for storage but to augment the console&#x27;s RAM, as the combination of their I/O speeds and the use of decompression routines build into the system software give overall read speeds that approach that of the onboard RAM.

;Power supply
:Besides converting AC power from a wall socket to the DC power needed by the console electronics, the power supply also helps to regulate that power in cases of power surges. Some consoles power supplies are built into the unit, so that the consumer plugs the unit directly to a wall socket, but more often, the console ships with an AC adapter, colloquially known as a &quot;power brick&quot;, that converts the power outside of the unit. On handheld units the power supply will either be from a battery compartment, or optionally from a direct power connection from an AC adapter, or from a rechargeable battery pack built into the unit.

;Cooling systems
:More advanced computing systems generate heat, and require active cooling systems to keep the hardware at safe operating temperatures. Many newer consoles are designed with cooling fans, engineered cooling fins, internal layouts, and strategically-placed vents on the casing to assure good convective heat transfer for keeping the internal components cool.

;Media reader
:Since the introduction of game cartridges, nearly all consoles have a cartridge port/reader or an optical drive for game media. In the latter console generations, some console revisions have offered options without a media reader as a means to reduce the console&#x27;s cost and letting the consumer rely on digital distribution for game acquisition, such as with the Xbox One S All-Digital Edition or the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition.

;Case
:All consoles are enclosed in a case to protect the electronics from damage and to constrain the air flow for cooling.

;Input/output ports
:Ports for connecting power, controllers, televisions or video monitors, external storage devices, Internet connectivity, and other features are placed in strategic locations on the console. Controller connections are typically offered on the front of the console, while power and most other connections are usually found on the back to keep cables out of the way.

===Controllers===

All game consoles require player input through a game controller to provide a method to move the player character in a specific direction and a variation of buttons to perform other in-game actions such as jumping or interacting with the game world. Though controllers have become more featured over the years, they still provide less control over a game compared to personal computers or mobile gaming. The type of controller available to a game can fundamentally change the style of how a console game will or can be played. However, this has also inspired changes in game design to create games that accommodate for the comparatively limited controls available on consoles.

Controllers have come in a variety of styles over the history of consoles. Some common types include:

;Paddle
:A unit with a single knob or dial and usually one or two buttons. Turning the knob typically allows one to move an on-screen object along one axis (such as the paddle in a table tennis game), while the buttons can have additional features.

;Joystick
:A unit that has a long handle that can pivot freely along multiple directions along with one or more buttons. The unit senses the direction that the joystick is pushed, allowing for simultaneous movement in two directions within a game.

;Gamepad
:A unit that contains a variety of buttons, triggers, and directional controls either D-pads or analog sticks or both. These have become the most common type of controller since the third generation of console hardware, with designs becoming more detailed to give a larger array of buttons and directional controls to player&#x27;s while maintaining ergonomic features.

Numerous other controller types exist, including those that support motion controls, touchscreen support on handhelds and some consoles, and specialized controllers for specific types of games, such as racing wheels for racing games, light guns for shooting games, and musical instrument controllers for rhythm games. Some newer consoles also include optional support for a mouse and keyboard devices. Some older consoles such as 1988 Sega Genesis aka Mega Drive and 1993 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, supported optional mice, both with special mice made for them, but the 3DO mouse like that console was a flop, and the mouse for the Sega had very limited game support. The Sega also supported the optional Menacer, a wireless infrared light gun, and such were at one point popular for games. It also support BatterUP, a baseball bat-shaped controller.

A controller may be attached through a wired connection onto the console itself, or in some unique cases like the Famicom hardwired to the console, or with a wireless connection. Controllers require power, either provided by the console via the wired connection, or from batteries or a rechargeable battery pack for wireless connections. Controllers are nominally built into a handheld unit, though some newer ones allow for separate wireless controllers to also be used.

===Game media===
While the first game consoles were dedicated game systems, with the games programmed into the console&#x27;s hardware, the Fairchild Channel F introduced the ability to store games in a form separate from the console&#x27;s internal circuitry, thus allowing the consumer to purchase new games to play on the system. Since the Channel F, nearly all game consoles have featured the ability to purchase and swap games through some form, through those forms have changes with improvements in technology.

;ROM cartridge or game cartridge
:The read-only memory (ROM) cartridge was introduced with the Fairchild Channel F. A ROM cartridge consist of a printed circuit board (PCB) housed inside of a plastic casing, with a connector allowing the device to interface with the console. The circuit board can contain a wide variety of components, at the minimum, the read-only memory with the software written on it. Later cartridges were able to introduce additional components onto the circuit board like coprocessors, such as Nintendo&#x27;s SuperFX chip, to enhance the performance of the console. Some consoles such as the Turbografx-16 used a smart card-like technology to flatten the cartridge to a credit-card-sized system, which helped to reduce production costs, but limited additional features that could be included onto the circuitry. PCB-based cartridges waned with the introduction of optical media during the fifth generation of consoles. More recently, ROM cartridges have been based on high memory density, low cost flash memory, which allows for easier mass production of games. Sony used this approach for the PlayStation Vita, and Nintendo continues to use ROM cartridges for its 3DS and Switch products.

;Optical media
:Optical media, such as CD-ROM, DVD, and Blu-ray, became the primary format for retail distribution with the fifth generation. The CD-ROM format had gained popularity in the 1990s, in the midst of the fourth generation, and as a game media, CD-ROMs were cheaper and faster to produce, offered much more storage space and allowed for the potential of full-motion video. Several console manufacturers attempted to offer CD-ROM add-ons to fourth generation consoles, but these were nearly as expensive as the consoles themselves and did not fare well. Instead, the CD-ROM format became integrated into consoles of the fifth generation, with the DVD format present across most by the seventh generation and Blu-ray by the eighth. Console manufacturers have also used proprietary disc formats for copy protection as well, such as the Nintendo optical disc used on the GameCube, and Sony&#x27;s Universal Media Disc on the PlayStation Portable.

;Digital distribution
:Since the seventh generation of consoles, most consoles include integrated connectivity to the Internet and both internal and external storage for the console, allowing for players to acquire new games without game media. All three of Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft offer an integrated storefront for consumers to purchase new games and download them to their console, retaining the consumers&#x27; purchases across different consoles, and offering sales and incentives at times.

;Cloud gaming
:As Internet access speeds improved throughout the eighth generation of consoles, cloud gaming had gained further attention as a media format. Instead of downloading games, the consumer plays them directly from a cloud gaming service with inputs performed on the local console sent through the Internet to the server with the rendered graphics and audio sent back. Latency in network transmission remains a core limitation for cloud gaming at the present time.

While magnetic storage, such as tape drives and floppy disks, had been popular for software distribution with early personal computers in the 1980s and 1990s, this format did not see much use in console systems. There were some attempts, such as the Bally Astrocade and APF-M1000 using tape drives, as well as the Disk System for the Nintendo Famicom, and the Nintendo 64DD for the Nintendo 64, but these had limited applications, as magnetic media was more fragile and volatile than game cartridges.

===External storage===

In addition to built-in internal storage, newer consoles often give the consumer the ability to use external storage media to save game date, downloaded games, or other media files from the console. Early iterations of external storage were achieved through the use of flash-based memory cards, first used by the Neo Geo but popularized with the PlayStation. Nintendo continues to support this approach with extending the storage capabilities of the 3DS and Switch, standardizing on the current SD card format. As consoles began incorporating the use of USB ports, support for USB external hard drives was also added, such as with the Xbox 360.

===Online services===

With Internet-enabled consoles, console manufacturers offer both free and paid-subscription services that provide value-added services atop the basic functions of the console. Free services generally offer user identity services and access to a digital storefront, while paid services allow players to play online games, interact with other uses through social networking, use cloud saves for supported games, and gain access to free titles on a rotating basis. Examples of such services include the Xbox network, PlayStation Network, and Nintendo Switch Online.

===Console add-ons===
Certain consoles saw various add-ons or accessories that were designed to attach to the existing console to extend its functionality. The best example of this was through the various CD-ROM add-ons for consoles of the fourth generation such as the TurboGrafx CD, Atari Jaguar CD, and the Sega CD. Other examples of add-ons include the 32X for the Sega Genesis intended to allow owners of the aging console to play newer games but has several technical faults, and the Game Boy Player for the GameCube to allow it to play Game Boy games.

===Accessories===
Consumers can often purchase a range of accessories for consoles outside of the above categories. These can include:

;Video camera
:While these can be used with Internet-connected consoles like webcams for communication with other friends as they would be used on personal computers, video camera applications on consoles are more commonly used in augmented reality/mixed reality and motion sensing games. Devices like the EyeToy for PlayStation consoles and the Kinect for Xbox consoles were center-points for a range of games to support these devices on their respective systems.

;Standard Headsets
:Headsets provide a combination of headphones and a microphone for chatting with other players without disturbing others nearby in the same room.

;Virtual reality headsets
:Some virtual reality (VR) headsets can operate independently of consoles or use personal computers for their main processing system. , the only direct VR support on consoles is the PlayStation VR, though support for VR on other consoles is planned by the other manufacturers.

;Docking station
:For handheld systems as well as hybrids such as the Nintendo Switch, the docking station makes it easy to insert a handheld to recharge its battery, and if supported, for connecting the handheld to a television screen.

==Game development==
===Console development kits===

Console or game development kits are specialized hardware units that typically include the same components as the console and additional chips and components to allow the unit to be connected to a computer or other monitoring device for debugging purposes. A console manufacturer will make the console&#x27;s dev kit available to registered developers months ahead of the console&#x27;s planned launch to give developers time to prepare their games for the new system. These initial kits will usually be offered under special confidentiality clauses to protect trade secrets of the console&#x27;s design, and will be sold at a high cost to the developer as part of keeping this confidentiality. Newer consoles that share features in common with personal computers may no longer use specialized dev kits, though developers are still expected to register and purchase access to software development kits from the manufacturer. For example, any consumer Xbox One can be used for game development after paying a fee to Microsoft to register one intent to do so.

===Licensing===
Since the release of the Nintendo Famicom / Nintendo Entertainment System, most video game console manufacturers employ a strict licensing scheme that limit what games can be developed for it. Developers and their publishers must pay a fee, typically based on royalty per unit sold, back to the manufacturer. The cost varies by manufacturer but was estimated to be about per unit in 2012. With additional fees, such as branding rights, this has generally worked out to be an industry-wide 30% royalty rate paid to the console manufacturer for every game sold. This is in addition to the cost of acquiring the dev kit to develop for the system.

The licensing fee may be collected in a few different ways. In the case of Nintendo, the company generally has controlled the production of game cartridges with its lockout chips and optical media for its systems, and thus charges the developer or publisher for each copy it makes as an upfront fee. This also allows Nintendo to review the game&#x27;s content prior to release and veto games it does not believe appropriate to include on its system. This had led to over 700 unlicensed games for the NES, and numerous others on other Nintendo cartridge-based systems that had found ways to bypass the hardware lockout chips and sell without paying any royalties to Nintendo, such as by Atari in its subsidiary company Tengen. This licensing approach was similarly used by most other cartridge-based console manufacturers using lockout chip technology.

With optical media, where the console manufacturer may not have direct control on the production of the media, the developer or publisher typically must establish a licensing agreement to gain access to the console&#x27;s proprietary storage format for the media as well as to use the console and manufacturer&#x27;s logos and branding for the game&#x27;s packaging, paid back through royalties on sales. In the transition to digital distribution, where now the console manufacturer runs digital storefronts for games, license fees apply to registering a game for distribution on the storefront again gaining access to the console&#x27;s branding and logo with the manufacturer taking its cut of each sale as its royalty. In both cases, this still gives console manufacturers the ability to review and reject games it believes unsuitable for the system and deny licensing rights.

With the rise of indie game development, the major console manufacturers have all developed entry level routes for these smaller developers to be able to publish onto consoles at far lower costs and reduced royalty rates. Programs like Microsoft&#x27;s ID@Xbox give developers most of the needed tools for free after validating the small development size and needs of the team.

Similar licensing concepts apply for third-party accessory manufacturers.

==Emulation and backward compatibility==

Consoles, like most consumer electronic devices, have limited lifespans. There is great interest in preservation of older console hardware for archival and historical purposes, as games from older consoles, as well as arcade and personal computers, remain of interest. Computer programmers and hackers have developed emulators that can be run on personal computers or other consoles that simulate the hardware of older consoles that allow games from that console to be run. The development of software emulators of console hardware is established to be legal, but there are unanswered legal questions surrounding copyrights, including acquiring a console&#x27;s firmware and copies of a game&#x27;s ROM image, which laws such as the United States&#x27; Digital Millennium Copyright Act make illegal save for certain archival purposes. Even though emulation itself is legal, Nintendo is recognized to be highly protective of any attempts to emulate its systems and has taken early legal actions to shut down such projects.

To help support older games and console transitions, manufacturers started to support backward compatibility on consoles in the same family. Sony was the first to do this on a home console with the PlayStation 2 which was able to play original PlayStation content, and subsequently became a sought-after feature across many consoles that followed. Backward compatibility functionality has included direct support for previous console games on the newer consoles such as within the Xbox console family, the distribution of emulated games such as Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console, or using cloud gaming services for these older games as with the PlayStation Now service.

==Market==

===Distribution===

Consoles may be shipped in a variety of configurations, but typically will include one base configuration that include the console, one controller, and sometimes a pack-in game. Manufacturers may offer alternate stock keeping unit (SKUs) options that include additional controllers and accessories or different pack-in games. Special console editions may feature unique cases or faceplates with art dedicated to a specific video game or series and are bundled with that game as a special incentive for its fans. Pack-in games are typically first-party games, often featuring the console&#x27;s primary mascot characters.

The more recent console generations have also seen multiple versions of the same base console system either offered at launch or presented as a mid-generation refresh. In some cases, these simply replace some parts of the hardware with cheaper or more efficient parts, or otherwise streamline the console&#x27;s design for production going forward; the PlayStation 3 underwent several such hardware refreshes during its lifetime due to technological improvements such as significant reduction of the process node size for the CPU and GPU. In these cases, the hardware revision model will be marked on packaging so that consumers can verify which version they are acquiring.

In other cases, the hardware changes create multiple lines within the same console family. The base console unit in all revisions share fundamental hardware, but options like internal storage space and RAM size may be different. Those systems with more storage and RAM would be marked as a higher performance variant available at a higher cost, while the original unit would remain as a budget option. For example, within the Xbox One family, Microsoft released the mid-generation Xbox One X as a higher performance console, the Xbox One S as the lower-cost base console, and a special Xbox One S All-Digital Edition revision that removed the optical drive on the basis that users could download all games digitally, offered at even a lower cost than the Xbox One S. In these cases, developers can often optimize games to work better on the higher-performance console with patches to the retail version of the game. In the case of the Nintendo 3DS, the New Nintendo 3DS, featured upgraded memory and processors, with new games that could only be run on the upgraded units and cannot be run on an older base unit. There have also been a number of &quot;slimmed-down&quot; console options with significantly reduced hardware components that significantly reduced the price they could sell the console to the consumer, but either leaving certain features off the console, such as the Wii Mini that lacked any online components compared to the Wii, or that required the consumer to purchase additional accessories and wiring if they did not already own it, such as the New-Style NES that was not bundled with the required RF hardware to connect to a television.

===Pricing===

Consoles when originally launched in the 1970s and 1980s were about , and with the introduction of the ROM cartridge, each game averaged about . Over time the launch price of base consoles units has generally risen to about , with the average game costing . Exceptionally, the period of transition from ROM cartridges to optical media in the early 1990s saw several consoles with high price points exceeding and going as high as . Resultingly, sales of these first optical media consoles were generally poor.

When adjusted for inflation, the price of consoles has generally followed a downward trend, from from the early generations down to for current consoles. This is typical for any computer technology, with the improvements in computing performance and capabilities outpacing the additional costs to achieve those gains. Further, within the United States, the price of consoles has generally remained consistent, being within 0.8% to 1% of the median household income, based on the United States Census data for the console&#x27;s launch year.

Since the Nintendo Entertainment System, console pricing has stabilized on the razorblade model, where the consoles are sold at little to no profit for the manufacturer, but they gain revenue from each game sold due to console licensing fees and other value-added services around the console (such as Xbox Live). Console manufacturers have even been known to take losses on the sale of consoles at the start of a console&#x27;s launch with expectation to recover with revenue sharing and later price recovery on the console as they switch to less expensive components and manufacturing processes without changing the retail price. Consoles have been generally designed to have a five-year product lifetime, though manufacturers have considered their entries in the more recent generations to have longer lifetimes of seven to potentially ten years.

===Competition===

The competition within the video game console market as subset of the video game industry is an area of interest to economics with its relatively modern history, its rapid growth to rival that of the film industry, and frequent changes compared to other sectors.

Effects of unregulated competition on the market were twice seen early in the industry. The industry had its first crash in 1977 following the release of the Magnavox Odyssey, Atari&#x27;s home versions of &quot;Pong&quot; and the Coleco Telstar, which led other third-party manufacturers, using inexpensive General Instruments processor chips, to make their own home consoles which flooded the market by 1977. The video game crash of 1983 was fueled by multiple factors including competition from lower-cost personal computers, but unregulated competition was also a factor, as numerous third-party game developers, attempting to follow on the success of Activision in developing third-party games for the Atari 2600 and Intellivision, flooded the market with poor quality games, and made it difficult for even quality games to sell. Nintendo implemented a lockout chip, the Checking Integrated Circuit, on releasing the Nintendo Entertainment System in Western territories, as a means to control which games were published for the console. As part of their licensing agreements, Nintendo further prevented developers from releasing the same game on a different console for a period of two years. This served as one of the first means of securing console exclusivity for games that existed beyond technical limitation of console development.

The Nintendo Entertainment System also brought the concept of a video game mascot as the representation of a console system as a means to sell and promote the unit, and for the NES was Mario. The use of mascots in businesses had been a tradition in Japan, and this had already proven successful in arcade games like &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. Mario was used to serve as an identity for the NES as a humor-filled, playful console. Mario caught on quickly when the NES released in the West, and when the next generation of consoles arrived, other manufacturers pushed their own mascots to the forefront of their marketing, most notably Sega with the use of Sonic the Hedgehog. The Nintendo and Sega rivalry that involved their mascot&#x27;s flagship games served as part of the fourth console generation&#x27;s &quot;console wars&quot;. Since then, manufacturers have typically positioned their mascot and other first-party games as key titles in console bundles used to drive sales of consoles at launch or at key sales periods such as near Christmas.

Another type of competitive edge used by console manufacturers around the same time was the notion of &quot;bits&quot; or the size of the word used by the main CPU. The TurboGrafx-16 was the first console to push on its bit-size, advertising itself as a &quot;16-bit&quot; console, though this only referred to part of its architecture while its CPU was still an 8-bit unit. Despite this, manufacturers found consumers became fixated on the notion of bits as a console selling point, and over the fourth, fifth and sixth generation, these &quot;bit wars&quot; played heavily into console advertising. The use of bits waned as CPU architectures no longer needed to increase their word size and instead had other means to improve performance such as through multicore CPUs.
Generally, increased console numbers gives rise to more consumer options and better competition, but the exclusivity of titles made the choice of console for consumers an &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; decision for most. Further, with the number of available consoles growing with the fifth and sixth generations, game developers became pressured to which systems to focus on, and ultimately narrowed their target choice of platforms to those that were the best-selling. This cased a contraction in the market, with major players like Sega leaving the hardware business after the Dreamcast but continuing in the software area. Effectively, each console generation was shown to have two or three dominant players.

Competition in the console market in the 2010s and 2020s is considered an oligarchy between three main manufacturers: Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft. The three use a combination of first-party games exclusive to their console and negotiate exclusive agreements with third-party developers to have their games be exclusive for at least an initial period of time to drive consumers to their console. They also worked with CPU and GPU manufacturers to tune and customize hardware for computers to make it more amenable and effective for video games, leading to lower-cost hardware needed for video game consoles. Finally, console manufacturers also work with retailers to help with promotion of consoles, games, and accessories. While there is little difference in pricing on the console hardware from the manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price for the retailer to profit from, these details with the manufacturers can secure better profits on sales of game and accessory bundles for premier product placement. These all form network effects, with each manufacturer seeking to maximize the size of their network of partners to increase their overall position in the competition.

Of the three, Microsoft and Sony, both with their own hardware manufacturing capabilities, remain at a leading edge approach, attempting to gain a first-mover advantage over the other with adaption of new console technology. Nintendo is more reliant on its suppliers and thus instead of trying to compete feature for feature with Microsoft and Sony, had instead taken a &quot;blue ocean&quot; strategy since the Nintendo DS and Wii.

<doc id="32632" wikidata="Q238199" url="?curid=32632" title="Veneration of the dead">
<text>The veneration of the dead, including one&#x27;s ancestors, is based on love and respect for the deceased. In some cultures, it is related to beliefs that the dead have a continued existence, and may possess the ability to influence the fortune of the living. Some groups venerate their direct, familial ancestors. Certain religious groups, in particular the Eastern Orthodox Churches, Anglican Church, and Catholic Church venerate saints as intercessors with God; the latter also believes in prayer for departed souls in Purgatory. Other religious groups, however, consider veneration of the dead to be idolatry and a sin.

In European, Asian, Oceanian, African and Afro-diasporic cultures (which includes but should be distinguished from multiple cultures and Indigenous populations in the Americas who were never influenced by the African Diaspora), the goal of ancestor veneration is to ensure the ancestors&#x27; continued well-being and positive disposition towards the living, and sometimes to ask for special favours or assistance. The social or non-religious function of ancestor veneration is to cultivate kinship values, such as filial piety, family loyalty, and continuity of the family lineage. Ancestor veneration occurs in societies with every degree of social, political, and technological complexity, and it remains an important component of various religious practices in modern times.

==Overview==

Ancestor reverence is not the same as the worship of a deity or deities. In some Afro-diasporic cultures, ancestors are seen as being able to intercede on behalf of the living, often as messengers between humans and God. As spirits who were once human themselves, they are seen as being better able to understand human needs than would a divine being. In other cultures, the purpose of ancestor veneration is not to ask for favors but to do one&#x27;s filial duty. Some cultures believe that their ancestors actually need to be provided for by their descendants, and their practices include offerings of food and other provisions. Others do not believe that the ancestors are even aware of what their descendants do for them, but that the expression of filial piety is what is important.

Most cultures who practice ancestor veneration do not call it &quot;ancestor worship&quot;. In English, the word &quot;worship&quot; usually but not always refers to the reverent love and devotion accorded a deity (god) or God. However, in other cultures, this act of worship does not confer any belief that the departed ancestors have become some kind of deity. Rather, the act is a way to express filial duty, devotion and respect and look after ancestors in their afterlives as well as seek their guidance for their living descendants. In this regard, many cultures and religions have similar practices. Some may visit the graves of their parents or other ancestors, leave flowers and pray to them in order to honor and remember them, while also asking their ancestors to continue to look after them. However, this would not be considered as worshipping them since the term &quot;worship&quot; may not always convey such meaning in the exclusive and narrow context of certain Western European Christian traditions.

In that sense the phrase &quot;ancestor veneration&quot; may but from the limited perspective of certain Western European Christian traditions, convey a more accurate sense of what practitioners, such as the Chinese and other Buddhist-influenced and Confucian-influenced societies, as well as the African and European cultures see themselves as doing. This is consistent with the meaning of the word &quot;veneration&quot; in English, that is great respect or reverence caused by the dignity, wisdom, or dedication of a person.

Although there is no generally accepted theory concerning the origins of ancestor veneration, this social phenomenon appears in some form in all human cultures documented so far. David-Barrett and Carney claim that ancestor veneration might have served a group coordination role during human evolution, and thus it was the mechanism that led to religious representation fostering group cohesion.

==West and Southeast African cultures==
Ancestor veneration is prevalent throughout Africa, and serves as the basis of many religions. It is often augmented by a belief in a supreme being, but prayers and/or sacrifices are usually offered to the ancestors who may ascend to becoming a kind of minor deities themselves. Ancestor veneration remains among many Africans, sometimes practiced alongside the later adopted religions of Christianity (as in Nigeria among the Igbo people), and Islam (among the different Mandé peoples and the Bamum and the Bakossi people) in much of the continent. In orthodox Serer religion, the pangool is venerated by the Serer people.

===Serer of Senegal and Gambia===

The Seereer people of Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania who adhere to the tenets of A ƭat Roog (Seereer religion) believe in the veneration of the pangool (ancient Seereer saints and/or ancestral spirits). There are various types of pangool (singular: &quot;fangol&quot;), each with its own means of veneration.

===Madagascar===

Veneration of ancestors is prevalent throughout the island of Madagascar. Approximately half of the country&#x27;s population of 20 million currently practice traditional religion, which tends to emphasize links between the living and the &quot;razana&quot; (ancestors). The veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the &quot;famadihana&quot;, whereby a deceased family member&#x27;s remains may be exhumed to be periodically re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb. The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor&#x27;s memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere. Residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party, where food and rum are typically served and a hiragasy troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present. Veneration of ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to &quot;fady&quot;, taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways, they may intervene on behalf of the living. Conversely, misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected. The sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors. Small, everyday gestures of respect include throwing the first capful of a newly opened bottle of rum into the northeast corner of the room to give the ancestors their due share.
==North Africa==
In Egypt, a form of adorcism entwined with veneration of the dead, which one academic referred to as &quot;ghost riders&quot;. A ghost who came to possess a person would be honored with a dedicated grave monument or sanctuary, where locals would make offerings and swear oaths. Those who swore false oaths may be punished by the ghost in residence. This ghost was considered both powerful and something for others to fear. These ghosts are not necessarily saints (in fact, those who hold these beliefs believe very holy persons never possess others in this way, as they are always in the presence of God), but like saints, they function as intermediaries with God. In some cases these may be family shrines, which are not frequented by outsiders, but some (usually older shrines) are frequented by many. When asking for aid from one of these spirits, one may often pledge an animal sacrifice upon aid being rendered, which is also done with saints.

==Asian cultures==
===Cambodia===

During Pchum Ben and the Cambodian New Year people make offerings to their ancestors. Pchum Ben is a time when many Cambodians pay their respects to deceased relatives of up to seven generations. Monks chant the suttas in Pali language overnight (continuously, without sleeping) in prelude to the gates of hell opening, an event that is presumed to occur once a year, and is linked to the cosmology of King Yama originating in the Pali Canon. During this period, the gates of hell are opened and ghosts of the dead (preta) are presumed to be especially active. In order to combat this, food-offerings are made to benefit them, some of these ghosts having the opportunity to end their period of purgation, whereas others are imagined to leave hell temporarily, to then return to endure more suffering; without much explanation, relatives who are not in hell (who are in heaven or otherwise reincarnated) are also generally imagined to benefit from the ceremonies.

===China===
In China, ancestor veneration (敬祖, pinyin: &quot;jìngzǔ&quot;) and ancestor worship (拜祖, pinyin: &quot;bàizǔ&quot;) seek to honour and recollect the actions of the deceased; they represent the ultimate homage to the dead. The importance of paying respect to parents (and elders) lies with the fact that all physical bodily aspects of one&#x27;s being were created by one&#x27;s parents, who continued to tend to one&#x27;s well-being until one was on firm footing. The respect and homage to parents is to return this gracious deed to them in life and after. The &quot;shi&quot; (尸; &quot;corpse, personator&quot;) was a Zhou dynasty () sacrificial representative of a dead relative. During a &quot;shi&quot; ceremony, the ancestral spirit supposedly would enter the personator, who would eat and drink sacrificial offerings and convey spiritual messages. Spiritual messages usually were conveyed in the form of poe divination, or to confirm whether the ancestors consent on the messages requested by the divinator.

====Offerings====
In traditional Chinese culture, sacrifices are sometimes made to altars as food for the deceased. This falls under the modes of communication with the Chinese spiritual world concepts. Some of the veneration includes visiting the deceased at their graves, and making or buying offerings for the deceased in the Spring, Autumn, and Ghost Festivals. Due to the hardships of the late 19th- and 20th-century China, when meat and poultry were difficult to come by, sumptuous feasts are still offered in some Asian countries as a practice to the spirits or ancestors. However, in the orthodox Taoist and Buddhist rituals, only vegetarian food would suffice. For those with deceased in the afterlife or hell, elaborate or even creative offerings, such as servants, refrigerators, houses, car, paper money and shoes are provided so that the deceased will be able to have these items after they have died. Often, paper versions of these objects are burned for the same purpose. Originally, real-life objects were buried with the dead. In time these goods were replaced by full size clay models which in turn were replaced by scale models, and in time today&#x27;s paper offerings (including paper servants).

===India===

Ancestors are widely revered, honoured, and venerated in India. The spirit of a dead person is called a Pitr, which is venerated. When a person dies, the family observes a thirteen-day mourning period, generally called &quot;śrāddha&quot;. A year thence, they observe the ritual of &quot;tarpana&quot;, in which the family makes offerings to the deceased. During these rituals, the family prepares the food items that the deceased liked and offers food to the deceased. They offer this food to crows as well on certain days as it is believed that the soul comes in the form of a bird to taste it. They are also obliged to offer &quot;śrāddha&quot;, a small feast of specific preparations, to eligible Brahmins. Only after these rituals are the family members allowed to eat. It is believed that this reminds the ancestors&#x27;s spirits that they are not forgotten and are loved, so it brings them peace. On &quot;śrāddha&quot; days, people pray that the souls of ancestors be appeased, forget any animosity and find peace. Each year, on the particular date (as per the Hindu calendar) when the person had died, the family members repeat this ritual. This period falls just before the Navaratri or Durga Puja falling in the month of Ashvin. Mahalaya marks the end of the fortnight-long &quot;tarpana&quot; to the ancestors.

Indian and Chinese practices of ancestor-worship are prevalent throughout Asia as a result of the large Indian and Chinese populations in countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and elsewhere across the continent. Furthermore, the large Indian population in places such as Fiji and Guyana has resulted in these practices spreading beyond their Asian homeland.

====Assam====
The Ahom religion is based on ancestor-worship. The Ahoms believe that a person after his death remains as ‘Dam’(ancestor) only for a few days and soon he becomes ‘Phi’ (God). They also believe that the soul of a person which is immortal unites with the supreme soul, possesses the qualities of a spiritual being and always blesses the family. So every Ahom family in order to worship the dead establish a pillar on the opposite side of the kitchen (Barghar) which is called ‘Damkhuta’ where they worship the dead with various offerings like homemade wine, mah-prasad, rice with various items of meat and fish. Me-Dam-Me-Phi, a ritual centred on commemorating the dead, is celebrated by the Ahom people on 31 January every year in memory of the departed. It is the manifestation of the concept of ancestor worship that the Ahoms share with other peoples originating from the Tai-Shan stock. It is a festival to show respect to the departed ancestors and remember their contribution to society. On the day of Me-Dam Me Phi worship is offered only to Chaufi and Dam Chaufi because they are regarded as gods of heaven.

====Indus Valley Civilization====
At Rakhigarhi, an Indus Valley civilization (IVC) site in Haryana, the lover&#x27;s skeletons of a man between 35 and 40 years old and women in early 20s were found who were likely married to each other and buried together, their grave contained pots which likely carried food and water as offering to the dead.

====Paliya in Gujarat====
The &quot;Paliya&quot; memorial stones are associated with ancestral worship in western India. These memorials are worshipped by people of associated community or descendants of a person on special days such as death day of person, event anniversaries, festivals, auspicious days in Kartika, Shravana or Bhadrapada months of Hindu calendar. These memorials are washed with milk and water on these days. They are smeared with sindoor or kumkuma and flowers are scattered over it. The earthen lamp is lighted near it with sesame oil. Sometimes a flag is erected over it.

====Tuluva culture in Tulu Nadu====

Tuluvas practice a form of ancestor worship called kule aradhane.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia ancestor worship has been a tradition of some of the indigenous people. Podom of the Toba Batak, Waruga of the Minahasans and the coffins of the Karo people (Indonesia) are a few examples of the forms the veneration takes.

=== Japan ===
Before the introduction of Buddhism to Japan, ancestor worship and funerary rites were not common, especially for non-elites. In the Heian Period, abandonment was a common method of disposing of the dead. Following the advent of Buddhism, rituals were sometimes performed at the gravesite after burial or cremation.

===Korea===
In Korea, ancestor veneration is referred to by the generic term &quot;jerye&quot; ( or &quot;jesa&quot; (). Notable examples of &quot;jerye&quot; include &quot;Munmyo jerye&quot; and &quot;Jongmyo jerye&quot;, which are performed periodically each year for venerated Neo-Confucian scholars and kings of ancient times, respectively. The ceremony held on the anniversary of a family member&#x27;s death is called &quot;charye&quot; (차례). It is still practised today.

The majority of Catholics, Buddhists and nonbelievers practise ancestral rites, although Protestants do not. The Catholic ban on ancestral rituals was lifted in 1939, when the Catholic Church formally recognised ancestral rites as a civil practice.

Ancestral rites are typically divided into three categories:
# Charye (차례, 茶禮) – tea rites held four times a year on major holidays (Korean New Year, Chuseok)
# Kije (기제, 忌祭) – household rites held the night before an ancestor&#x27;s death anniversary (기일, 忌日)
# Sije (시제, 時祭; also called 사시제 or 四時祭) – seasonal rites held for ancestors who are five or more generations removed (typically performed annually on the tenth lunar month)

===Myanmar===
Ancestor worship in modern-day Myanmar is largely confined to some ethnic minority communities, but mainstream remnants of it still exist, such as worship of Bo Bo Gyi (literally &quot;great grandfather&quot;), as well as of other guardian spirits such as nats, all of which may be vestiges of historic ancestor worship.

Ancestor worship was present in the royal court in pre-colonial Burma. During the Konbaung dynasty, solid gold images of deceased kings and their consorts were worshipped three times a year by the royal family, during the Burmese New Year (&quot;Thingyan&quot;), at the beginning and at the end of Vassa. The images were stored in the treasury and worshiped at the Zetawunzaung (, &quot;Hall of Ancestors&quot;), along with a book of odes.

Some scholars attribute the disappearance of ancestor worship to the influence of Buddhist doctrines of anicca and anatta, impermanence and rejection of a &#x27;self&#x27;.

===Philippines===
In the animistic indigenous religions of the precolonial Philippines, ancestor spirits were one of the two major types of spirits (&quot;anito&quot;) with whom shamans communicate. Ancestor spirits were known as &quot;umalagad&quot; (lit. &quot;guardian&quot; or &quot;caretaker&quot;). They can be the spirits of actual ancestors or generalized guardian spirits of a family. Ancient Filipinos believed that upon death, the soul of a person travels (usually by boat) to a spirit world. There can be multiple locations in the spirit world, varying in different ethnic groups. Which place souls end up in depends on how they died, the age at death, or conduct of the person when they were alive. Souls reunite with deceased relatives in the underworld and lead normal lives in the underworld as they did in the material world. In some cases, the souls of evil people undergo penance and cleansing before they are granted entrance into a particular spirit realm. Souls would eventually reincarnate after a period of time in the spirit world.

Souls in the spirit world still retain a degree of influence in the material world, and vice versa. &quot;Paganito&quot; rituals may be used to invoke good ancestor spirits for protection, intercession, or advice. Vengeful spirits of the dead can manifest as apparitions or ghosts (&quot;mantiw&quot;) and cause harm to living people. &quot;Paganito&quot; can be used to appease or banish them. Ancestor spirits also figured prominently during illness or death, as they were believed to be the ones who call the soul to the underworld, guide the soul (a psychopomp), or meet the soul upon arrival.

Ancestor spirits are also known as &quot;kalading&quot; among the Cordillerans; &quot;tonong&quot; among the Maguindanao and Maranao; &quot;umboh&quot; among the Sama-Bajau; &quot;ninunò&quot; among Tagalogs; and &quot;nono&quot; among Bicolanos. Ancestor spirits are usually represented by carved figures called &quot;taotao&quot;. These were carved by the community upon a person&#x27;s death. Every household had a &quot;taotao&quot; stored in a shelf in the corner of the house.

The predominantly Roman Catholic Filipino people still hold ancestors in particular esteem—though without the formality common to their neighbours—despite having been Christianised since coming into contact with Spanish missionaries in 1521. In the present day, ancestor veneration is expressed in having photographs of the dead by the home altar, a common fixture in many Filipino Christian homes. Candles are often kept burning before the photographs, which are sometimes decorated with garlands of fresh sampaguita, the national flower. Ancestors, particularly dead parents, are still regarded as psychopomps, as a dying person is said to be brought to the afterlife (Tagalog: &quot;sundô&quot;, &quot;fetch&quot;) by the spirits of dead relatives. It is said that when the dying call out the names of deceased loved ones, they can see the spirits of those particular people waiting at the foot of the deathbed.

Filipino Catholic and Aglipayan veneration of the dead finds its greatest expression in the Philippines is the Hallowmas season between 31 October and 2 November, variously called &quot;Undás&quot; (based on the word for &quot;[the] first&quot;, the Spanish &quot;andas&quot; or possibly &quot;honra&quot;), &quot;Todos los Santos&quot; (literally &quot;All Saints&quot;), and sometimes &quot;Áraw ng mga Patáy&quot; (lit. &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;), which refers to the following solemnity of All Souls&#x27; Day. Filipinos traditionally observe this day by visiting the family dead, cleaning and repairing their tombs. Common offerings are prayers, flowers, candles, and even food, while many also spend the remainder of the day and ensuing night holding reunions at the graveyard, playing games and music or singing.

Chinese Filipinos, meanwhile, have the most apparent and distinct customs related to ancestor veneration, carried over from traditional Chinese religion and most often melded with their current Catholic faith. Many still burn incense and kim at family tombs and before photos at home, while they incorporate Chinese practises into Masses held during the All Souls&#x27; Day period.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, making offerings to one&#x27;s ancestors is conducted on the sixth day after death as a part of traditional Sri Lankan funeral rites.

=== Thailand ===

In rural northern Thailand, a religious ceremony honoring ancestral spirits known as &quot;Faun Phii&quot; (, lit. &quot;spirit dance&quot; or &quot;ghost dance&quot;) takes place. It includes offerings for ancestors with spirit mediums sword fighting, spirit-possessed dancing, and spirit mediums cock fighting in a spiritual cockfight.

===Vietnam===

Ancestor veneration is one of the most unifying aspects of Vietnamese culture, as practically all Vietnamese have an ancestor altar in their home or business.

In Vietnam, traditionally people did not celebrate birthdays (before Western influence), but the death anniversary of one&#x27;s loved one was always an important occasion. Besides an essential gathering of family members for a banquet in memory of the deceased, incense sticks are burned along with hell notes, and great platters of food are made as offerings on the ancestor altar, which usually has pictures or plaques with the names of the deceased. In the case of missing persons, believed to be dead by their family, a Wind tomb is made.

These offerings and practices are done frequently during important traditional or religious celebrations, the starting of a new business, or even when a family member needs guidance or counsel and is a hallmark of the emphasis Vietnamese culture places on filial duty.

A significant distinguishing feature of Vietnamese ancestor veneration is that women have traditionally been allowed to participate and co-officiate ancestral rites, unlike in Chinese Confucian doctrine, which allows only male descendants to perform such rites.

==European cultures==
Care of the dead and the loving duty toward one&#x27;s ancestors (&quot;pietas&quot;) were fundamental aspects of ancient Roman culture. A clear manifestation of this is Roman Republican era portrait busts which may have originated in the practice of making death masks of ancestors which were displayed in the home and during funerary rites and on the anniversary of the ancestor’s death.

In Catholic countries in Europe (continued later with the Anglican Church in England), November 1 (All Saints&#x27; Day), became known and is still known as the day to specifically venerate those who have died, and who have been deemed official saints by the Church. November 2, (All Souls Day), or &quot;The Day of the Dead&quot;, is the day when all of the faithful dead are remembered. On that day, families go to cemeteries to light candles for their dead relatives, leave them flowers, and often to picnic. They also celebrate Suffrage Masses to shorten the time that souls need to leave Purgatory and the enter in Paradise. The evening before All Saints&#x27;—&quot;All Hallows Eve&quot; or &quot;Hallowe&#x27;en&quot;—is unofficially the Catholic day to remember the realities of Hell, to mourn the souls lost to evil, and to remember ways to avoid Hell . It is commonly celebrated in the United States and parts of the United Kingdom in a spirit of light-hearted horror and fear, which is marked by the recounting of ghost stories, bonfires, wearing costumes, carving jack-o&#x27;-lanterns, and &quot;trick-or-treating&quot; (going door to door seeking candy).

===Brythonic Celtic cultures===

In Cornwall and Wales, the autumn ancestor festivals occur around November 1. In Cornwall the festival is known as &quot;Kalan Gwav&quot;, and in Wales as &quot;Calan Gaeaf.&quot; Modern-day Halloween is derived from these festivals.

===Gaelic Celtic cultures===

During &quot;Samhain&quot;, November 1 in Ireland and Scotland, the dead are thought to return to the world of the living, and offerings of food and light are left for them. On the festival day, ancient people would extinguish the hearth fires in their homes, participate in a community bonfire festival, and then carry a flame home from the communal fire and use it to light their home fires anew. This custom has continued to some extent into modern times, in both the Celtic nations and the diaspora. Lights in the window to guide the dead home are left burning all night. On the Isle of Man the festival is known as &quot;old Sauin&quot; or &quot;Hop-tu-Naa&quot;.

==North America==

In the United States and Canada, flowers, wreaths, grave decorations and sometimes candles, food, small pebbles, or items the dead valued in life are put on graves year-round as a way to honor the dead. These traditions originate in the diverse cultural backgrounds of the current populations of both countries. In the United States, many people honor deceased loved ones who were in the military on Memorial Day. Days with religious and spiritual significance like Easter, Christmas, Candlemas, and All Souls&#x27; Day, Day of the Dead, or Samhain are also times when relatives and friends of the deceased may gather at the graves of their loved ones. In the Catholic Church, one&#x27;s local parish church often offers prayers for the dead on their death anniversary or All Souls&#x27; Day.

In the United States, Memorial Day is a Federal holiday for remembering the deceased men and women who served in the nation&#x27;s military, particularly those who died in war or during active service. In the 147 National Cemeteries, like Arlington and Gettysburg, it is common for volunteers to place small American flags at each grave. Memorial Day is traditionally observed on the last Monday in May, allotting for a 3-day weekend in which many memorial services and parades take place not only across the country, but in 26 American cemeteries on foreign soil (in France, Belgium, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Panama, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, and Tunisia). It is also common practice among veterans to memorialize fallen service members on the dates of their death. This practice is also common in other countries when remembering Americans who died in battles to liberate their towns in the World Wars. One example of this is on 16 August (1944) Colonel Griffith, died of wounds from enemy action sustained in Lèves, the same day he is credited with saving Chartres Cathedral from destruction.
In Judaism, when a grave site is visited, a small pebble is placed on the headstone. While there is no clear answer as to why, this custom of leaving pebbles may date back to biblical days when individuals were buried under piles of stones. Today, they are left as tokens that people have been there to visit and to remember.

Americans of various religions and cultures may build a shrine in their home dedicated to loved ones who have died, with pictures of their ancestors, flowers and mementos. Increasingly, many roadside shrines may be seen for deceased relatives who died in car accidents or were killed on that spot, sometimes financed by the state or province as these markers serve as potent reminders to drive cautiously in hazardous areas. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., is particularly known for the leaving of offerings to the deceased; items left are collected by the National Park Service and archived.

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints perform posthumous baptisms and other rituals for their dead ancestors, along with those of other families.

Native Americans were not heavily concerned with the veneration of the dead, though they were known to bury the dead with clothes and tools as well as occasionally leave food and drink at the gravesite; Pueblo Indians supported a cult of the dead which worshipped or petitioned the dead through ritualistic dances.

==Islam==

Islam has a complex and mixed view on the idea of grave shrines and ancestor worship. The graves of many early Islamic figures are holy sites for Muslims, including Ali, and a cemetery with many companions and early caliphs. Many other mausoleums are major architectural, political, and cultural sites, including the National Mausoleum in Pakistan and the Taj Mahal in India. However, the religious movement of Wahhabism disputes the concept of saint veneration. Followers of this movement have destroyed many gravesite shrines, including in Saudi Arabia and in territory controlled by the Islamic State.

Imam Ahmad, Al-Hakim, and others narrated about Marwan Ibn al-Hakam–Umayyad governor of Medina–that he once passed by the grave of the Prophet and saw a man with his cheek on the grave of the Prophet. Marwan Ibn al-Hakam asked: “Do you know what you are doing?” Nearing the grave, Marwan Ibn al-Hakam realized it was Abu Ayyub al-Ansariyy, one of the greatest companions of the Prophet. Abu Ayyub al-Ansariyy replied, “Yes, I know what I am doing. I came here for the Messenger of Allah–not for the stone.” By this he meant he was seeking the blessings from the presence of the Prophet, not for the stone covering his grave. Abu Ayyub al-Ansariyy continued his response with what he heard the Messenger of Allah say: “Do not cry over the Religion of Islam if the rulers are ruling correctly. Rather, cry over this Religion if the rulers are ruling incorrectly.” By his response, Abu Ayyub was telling Marwan Ibn al-Hakam: “You are not one of those rulers who are correctly ruling by the rules of Islam.&quot;

Some followers of Islam are at odds with the concept of saint veneration, but this practice is retained in Turkey, particularly through Alevi Muslims.

==Judaism==
Judaism, like Islam, has a complicated relationship to ancestor veneration/worship, grave shrines, and other related concepts. It is thought ancient Israelite religion and Pre-Israelite Cannanites practiced a form of ancestor worship in which ancestors were raised to the status of gods, and some form of similar practice was likely seen as acceptable in Israelite religion until King Josiah&#x27;s reign. In Biblical literature, and in contemporary prayer, the ancestors, particularly Abraham, Moses, Aaron, Jacob/Israel, or &quot;the Patriarchs&quot; and &quot;the Matriarchs&quot;, are often referred to. Stress is placed on the identity of the Jewish people as being the &quot;seed&quot;, &quot;house&quot;, or &quot;children&quot; of these figures.

Two prayers- Kaddish and Yizkor- are recited on behalf of the dead by Rabbinic Jews, including on anniversaries of a death. For some, the performance of prayers, especially prayers in their first year after death from their children, are thought to positively impact God&#x27;s judgement of them, as well as donations and other good works done in their name. This is similar to Japanese practices and other ancestral veneration practices overall. These good deeds done in the name of the dead are reciprocated by the dead&#x27;s prayers to God for the living. There are taboos and injunctions the living must follow, particularly in regard to their direct ancestors: not to use the remains of coffin wood for other purposes, to bury the dead in a proper shroud, and not to eat or drink at the beginning and/or close of Shabbat, as that is when spirits of the dead are believed to eat, drink, and bathe. One who eats during this time has stolen from the spirits, and one who drinks at the beginning of Shabbat risks ingesting contaminated bathing water.

Ashkenazi Jews commonly name children after dead relatives, and are hoped to embody those dead&#x27;s positive traits. Eastern European Jews specifically transform the concept of &quot;zechut avot&quot;- the merit of one&#x27;s ancestors, used to explain both a belief that the dead pray on behalf of the deceased, and a prayer to God to remember the good deeds of one&#x27;s ancestors and be merciful in judgement- into the related idea of &quot;yichus ovus&quot;, inherited ancestral status.

In contemporary Rabbinic Judaism, visiting the graves of tzaddikim (righteous figures akin to saints) has long remained popular, including the graves of ancestral figures like Abraham and Esther. These visits may also be accompanied by petitions of the dead, as their elevated status is thought to give them more direct access to God. Rabbinic Jews stress that they do not worship the dead, and only respect and honor them- a distinction made by other cultures, including Japanese and African cultures.

==Ancient cultures==
Ancestor worship was a prominent feature of many historical societies.

===Ancient Egypt===

Although some historians claim that ancient Egyptian society was a &quot;death cult&quot; because of its elaborate tombs and mummification rituals, it was the opposite. The philosophy that &quot;this world is but a vale of tears&quot; and that to die and be with God is a better existence than an earthly one was relatively unknown among the ancient Egyptians. This was not to say that they were unacquainted with the harshness of life; rather, their ethos included a sense of continuity between this life and the next. The Egyptian people loved the culture, customs and religion of their daily lives so much that they wanted to continue them in the next—although some might hope for a better station in the Beautiful West (Egyptian afterlife).

Tombs were housing in the Hereafter and so they were carefully constructed and decorated, just as homes for the living were. Mummification was a way to preserve the corpse so the &quot;ka&quot; (soul) of the deceased could return to receive offerings of the things s/he enjoyed while alive. If mummification was not affordable, a &quot;ka-statue&quot; in the likeness of the deceased was carved for this purpose. The Blessed Dead were collectively called the &quot;akhu&quot;, or &quot;shining ones&quot; (singular: &quot;akh&quot;). They were described as &quot;shining as gold in the belly of Nut&quot; (Gr. Nuit) and were indeed depicted as golden stars on the roofs of many tombs and temples.

The process by which a &quot;ka&quot; became an &quot;akh&quot; was not automatic upon death; it involved a 70-day journey through the &quot;duat&quot;, or Otherworld, which led to judgment before Wesir (Gr. Osiris), Lord of the Dead where the &quot;ka’&quot;s heart would be weighed on a scale against the Feather of Ma’at (representing Truth). However, if the &quot;ka&quot; was not properly prepared, this journey could be fraught with dangerous pitfalls and strange demons; hence some of the earliest religious texts discovered, such as the Papyrus of Ani (commonly known as The Book of the Dead) and the Pyramid Texts were actually written as guides to help the deceased successfully navigate the &quot;duat&quot;.

If the heart was in balance with the Feather of Ma&#x27;at, the &quot;ka&quot; passed judgment and was granted access to the Beautiful West as an &quot;akh&quot; who was &quot;ma’a heru&quot; (&quot;true of voice&quot;) to dwell among the gods and other &quot;akhu&quot;. At this point only was the &quot;ka&quot; deemed worthy to be venerated by the living through rites and offerings. Those who became lost in the &quot;duat&quot; or deliberately tried to avoid judgment became the unfortunate (and sometimes dangerous) &quot;mutu&quot;, the Restless Dead. For the few whose truly evil hearts outweighed the Feather, the goddess Ammit waited patiently behind Wesir&#x27;s judgment seat to consume them. She was a composite creature resembling three of the deadliest animals in Egypt: the crocodile, the hippopotamus and the lion. Being fed to Ammit was to be consigned to the Eternal Void, to be &quot;unmade&quot; as a &quot;ka&quot;.

Besides being eaten by Ammit, the worst fate a &quot;ka&quot; could suffer after physical death was to be forgotten. For this reason, ancestor veneration in ancient Egypt was an important rite of remembrance in order to keep the &quot;ka&quot; &quot;alive&quot; in this life as well as in the next. Royals, nobles and the wealthy made contracts with their local priests to perform prayers and give offerings at their tombs. In return, the priests were allowed to keep a portion of the offerings as payment for services rendered. Some tomb inscriptions even invited passers-by to speak aloud the names of the deceased within (which also helped to perpetuate their memory), and to offer water, prayers or other things if they so desired. In the private homes of the less wealthy, niches were carved into the walls for the purpose of housing images of familial &quot;akhu&quot; and to serve as altars of veneration.

Many of these same religious beliefs and ancestor veneration practices are still carried on today in the religion of Kemetic Orthodoxy.

===Ancient Israelite Religion ===
It is thought that the word Sheol (the afterlife referred to in Biblical literature) comes from the word meaning &quot;to inquire&quot;. Pre-Israelite Cannanites gave their ancestors offerings of food and drink, as well as symbolic vessel offerings which, even empty, provided both in the afterlife. In light of this, &quot;honor thy father and mother&quot;, is thought by some to have referenced this practice, particularly as it predates the ban of ancestor worship and necromancy by Josiah.

===Ancient Rome===

The Romans, like many Mediterranean societies, regarded the bodies of the dead as polluting. During Rome&#x27;s Classical period, the body was most often cremated, and the ashes placed in a tomb outside the city walls. Much of the month of February was devoted to purifications, propitiation, and veneration of the dead, especially at the nine-day festival of the Parentalia during which a family honored its ancestors. The family visited the cemetery and shared cake and wine, both in the form of offerings to the dead and as a meal among themselves. The Parentalia drew to a close on February 21 with the more somber Feralia, a public festival of sacrifices and offerings to the Manes, the potentially malevolent spirits of the dead who required propitiation. One of the most common inscriptional phrases on Latin epitaphs is &quot;Dis Manibus&quot;, abbreviated &quot;D.M,&quot; &quot;for the Manes gods&quot;, which appears even on some Christian tombstones. The Caristia on February 22 was a celebration of the family line as it continued into the present.

A noble Roman family displayed ancestral images (&quot;imagines&quot;) in the tablinum of their home &quot;(domus)&quot;. Some sources indicate these portraits were busts, while others suggest that funeral masks were also displayed. The masks, probably modeled of wax from the face of the deceased, were part of the funeral procession when an elite Roman died. Professional mourners wore the masks and regalia of the dead person&#x27;s ancestors as the body was carried from the home, through the streets, and to its final resting place.

<doc id="32634" wikidata="Q196653" url="?curid=32634" title="Saint Veronica">
<text>Saint Veronica, also known as &quot;Berenike&quot;, was a widow from Jerusalem who lived in the 1st century AD, according to extra-biblical Christian traditions. A celebrated saint in many pious Christian countries, the 17th-century &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot; published by the Bollandists listed her feast under July 12, but the German Jesuit scholar Joseph Braun cited her commemoration in &quot;Festi Marianni&quot; on 13 January.

According to Church tradition, Veronica was moved with sympathy seeing Jesus carrying the cross to Calvary and gave him her veil so that he could wipe his forehead. Jesus accepted the offer, and when he returned the veil the image of his face was miraculously captured on it. The resulting relic became known as the Veil of Veronica.

The story of Veronica is celebrated in the sixth Station of the Cross in Anglican, Catholic, and Western Orthodox churches.

== Background==
There is no reference to the story of Veronica and her veil in the canonical gospels. The closest is the miracle of the unnamed woman who was healed by touching the hem of Jesus’s garment. The apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus gives her name as Berenikē or Beronike (). The name Veronica is a Latinisation of this ancient Macedonian name. The story was later elaborated in the 11th century by adding that Christ gave her a portrait of himself on a cloth, with which she later cured the Emperor Tiberius. The linking of this with the bearing of the cross in the Passion occurs only around 1380 in the internationally popular book &quot;Meditations on the Life of Christ&quot;.At some point a relic became associated with the story. Pedro Tafur, a Spanish knight visiting Rome in 1436, describes the following in the Church of St. Peter in his 1454 travel account:
However, he does not say specifically that he witnessed for himself this exhibition of the relic.

Some academic sources suggest a different origin for the legend of St. Veronica: that the cloth bearing an image of Jesus&#x27;s face was known in Latin as the &quot;vera icon&quot; (&quot;true image&quot;), and that this name for the relic was misinterpreted as the name of a saint. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; of 1913 writes:
The reference to Abgar is related to a similar legend in the Eastern Church, the Image of Edessa or Mandylion.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; says this about the legend:


Veronica was mentioned in the reported visions of Jesus by Marie of St Peter, a Carmelite nun who lived in Tours, France, and started the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus. In 1844, Sister Marie reported that in a vision, she saw Veronica wiping away the spit and mud from the face of Jesus with her veil on the way to Calvary. She said that sacrilegious and blasphemous acts today are adding to the spit and mud that Veronica wiped away that day. According to Marie of St Peter, in her visions, Jesus told her that he desired devotion to His Holy Face in reparation for sacrilege and blasphemy. Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ are thus compared to Veronica wiping the face of Jesus.

The Devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus was eventually approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1885. Veronica is commemorated on 12 July.

== Official patronage ==
Saint Veronica is the patron of the French mulquiniers whose representations they celebrated semi-annually (summer and winter) as in many pious Christian countries. She is also the patron saint of photographers, and laundry workers.

<text>In Norse mythology, Verðandi (Old Norse, meaning possibly &quot;happening&quot; or &quot;present&quot;), sometimes anglicized as Verdandi or Verthandi, is one of the norns. Along with Urðr (Old Norse &quot;fate&quot;) and Skuld (possibly &quot;debt&quot; or &quot;future&quot;), Verðandi makes up a trio of Norns that are described as deciding the fates (wyrd) of people.

==Etymology==
&quot;Verðandi&quot; is literally the present participle of the Old Norse verb &quot;verða&quot;, &quot;to become&quot;, and is commonly translated as &quot;in the making&quot; or &quot;that which is happening/becoming&quot;; it is related to the Dutch word &quot;worden&quot; and the German word &quot;werden&quot;, both meaning &quot;to become&quot;. &quot;Werdend&quot; is not a commonly used German word in modern times, but intutitively means the things that &quot;are becoming&quot;, as -nd is the gerund form.

==Attestation==
===&quot;Völuspá&quot;===
She appears in the following verse from the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, along with Urðr and Skuld:

<text>Valmet Oyj, a Finnish company, is a developer and supplier of process technologies, automation systems and services for the pulp, paper, energy industries. Flow control serves a wider base of process industries.

== History ==
===1999–2012 Valmet and Rauma merge as Metso===
At the end of 2009, Metso acquired Tamfelt Corporation, one of the world&#x27;s leading suppliers of technical textiles.

===Valmet 2020–===

At the end of June 2020, Neles was separated from Metso. The State of Finland sold its share of 15 per cent to Valmet. In mid-July, the Swedish company Alfa Laval made an offer to buy Neles. Valmet&#x27;s CEO Laine rebuked the board of Neles for ill-advised actions and accepting a price that was too low. Laine had previously managed the business operations of Neles and thought that Valmet could in time have bought more of its stock. Alfa Laval&#x27;s CEO said that they had bought Neles at a “pandemic discount,” and the front page of the Swedish financial newspaper Dagens Industri celebrated that Sweden would soon own Finland&#x27;s industry. Valmet started buying Neles stock. By the autumn, Valmet owned nearly 30 per cent of the stock. Alfa Laval only received the support of a third of Neles owners for its takeover bid, and withdrew from the competition in November.

In January 2021, Valmet reported that it would supply the mills of the Swedish company Renewcell with equipment to produce dissolving pulp from recycled clothes and textiles. In May, Valmet announced that it would deliver drying technology to Spinnova, which produces textile fiber from cellulose. Valmet equipment for the textile industry is in high demand in Europe, because the collection of discarded textiles for recycling must be organized in the EU countries by 2025. Valmet had been developing recycling technology with Renewcell for years, and the companies constructed a pilot plant and a factory in Sundsvall together. In July 2021, Valmet and Neles agreed to merge. Neles owners obtained 18.8 per cent of the merging company. The companies’ synergies were considered to be substantial during the transaction. Neles was thought to help increase sales in automation systems, while its products were also to be sold to the paper industry.

Neles merged into Valmet in April 2022, becoming Valmet&#x27;s fifth business line, Flow Control. The companies had several managers and employees who knew each other from Metso days. After the merger, the company had 17,000 employees, 3,000 of whom came from Neles.

In February 2024, it was announced that President and CEO Pasi Laine would be retiring at the end of September 2024. Danish CEO of Mediq, Thomas Hinnerskov, was chosen by Valmet&#x27;s board of directors to lead the company as the new President and CEO.

In October 2024, Velmet announced that is it cutting 112 jobs to improve &quot;profitability and competitiveness of the business operations.&quot;. This comes after a net profit of 157 million euros in Q1-Q2 2024.

<text>Vector calculus or vector analysis is a branch of mathematics concerned with the differentiation and integration of vector fields, primarily in three-dimensional Euclidean space, formula_1 The term &quot;vector calculus&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for the broader subject of multivariable calculus, which spans vector calculus as well as partial differentiation and multiple integration. Vector calculus plays an important role in differential geometry and in the study of partial differential equations. It is used extensively in physics and engineering, especially in the description of electromagnetic fields, gravitational fields, and fluid flow.

Vector calculus was developed from the theory of quaternions by J. Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside near the end of the 19th century, and most of the notation and terminology was established by Gibbs and Edwin Bidwell Wilson in their 1901 book, &quot;Vector Analysis&quot;. In its standard form using the cross product, vector calculus does not generalize to higher dimensions, but the alternative approach of geometric algebra, which uses the exterior product, does (see &quot;&quot; below for more).

== Basic objects ==

=== Scalar fields ===

A scalar field associates a scalar value to every point in a space. The scalar is a mathematical number representing a physical quantity. Examples of scalar fields in applications include the temperature distribution throughout space, the pressure distribution in a fluid, and spin-zero quantum fields (known as scalar bosons), such as the Higgs field. These fields are the subject of scalar field theory.

=== Vector fields ===
A vector field is an assignment of a vector to each point in a space. A vector field in the plane, for instance, can be visualized as a collection of arrows with a given magnitude and direction each attached to a point in the plane. Vector fields are often used to model, for example, the speed and direction of a moving fluid throughout space, or the strength and direction of some force, such as the magnetic or gravitational force, as it changes from point to point. This can be used, for example, to calculate work done over a line.

=== Vectors and pseudovectors ===
In more advanced treatments, one further distinguishes pseudovector fields and pseudoscalar fields, which are identical to vector fields and scalar fields, except that they change sign under an orientation-reversing map: for example, the curl of a vector field is a pseudovector field, and if one reflects a vector field, the curl points in the opposite direction. This distinction is clarified and elaborated in geometric algebra, as described below.

== Vector algebra ==

The algebraic (non-differential) operations in vector calculus are referred to as &quot;vector algebra&quot;, being defined for a vector space and then applied pointwise to a vector field. The basic algebraic operations consist of:

Also commonly used are the two triple products:
== Operators and theorems ==

=== Differential operators ===

Vector calculus studies various differential operators defined on scalar or vector fields, which are typically expressed in terms of the del operator (formula_2), also known as &quot;nabla&quot;. The three basic vector operators are:
Also commonly used are the two Laplace operators:

A quantity called the Jacobian matrix is useful for studying functions when both the domain and range of the function are multivariable, such as a change of variables during integration.

=== Integral theorems ===
The three basic vector operators have corresponding theorems which generalize the fundamental theorem of calculus to higher dimensions:

In two dimensions, the divergence and curl theorems reduce to the Green&#x27;s theorem:

== Applications ==

=== Linear approximations ===

Linear approximations are used to replace complicated functions with linear functions that are almost the same. Given a differentiable function with real values, one can approximate for close to by the formula
: formula_3

The right-hand side is the equation of the plane tangent to the graph of at 

=== Optimization ===

For a continuously differentiable function of several real variables, a point (that is, a set of values for the input variables, which is viewed as a point in ) is critical if all of the partial derivatives of the function are zero at , or, equivalently, if its gradient is zero. The critical values are the values of the function at the critical points.

If the function is smooth, or, at least twice continuously differentiable, a critical point may be either a local maximum, a local minimum or a saddle point. The different cases may be distinguished by considering the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of second derivatives.

By Fermat&#x27;s theorem, all local maxima and minima of a differentiable function occur at critical points. Therefore, to find the local maxima and minima, it suffices, theoretically, to compute the zeros of the gradient and the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at these zeros.

== Generalizations ==

Vector calculus can also be generalized to other 3-manifolds and higher-dimensional spaces.

=== Different 3-manifolds ===
Vector calculus is initially defined for Euclidean 3-space, formula_4 which has additional structure beyond simply being a 3-dimensional real vector space, namely: a norm (giving a notion of length) defined via an inner product (the dot product), which in turn gives a notion of angle, and an orientation, which gives a notion of left-handed and right-handed. These structures give rise to a volume form, and also the cross product, which is used pervasively in vector calculus.

The gradient and divergence require only the inner product, while the curl and the cross product also requires the handedness of the coordinate system to be taken into account (see &quot;&quot; for more detail).

Vector calculus can be defined on other 3-dimensional real vector spaces if they have an inner product (or more generally a symmetric nondegenerate form) and an orientation; this is less data than an isomorphism to Euclidean space, as it does not require a set of coordinates (a frame of reference), which reflects the fact that vector calculus is invariant under rotations (the special orthogonal group ).

More generally, vector calculus can be defined on any 3-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifold, or more generally pseudo-Riemannian manifold. This structure simply means that the tangent space at each point has an inner product (more generally, a symmetric nondegenerate form) and an orientation, or more globally that there is a symmetric nondegenerate metric tensor and an orientation, and works because vector calculus is defined in terms of tangent vectors at each point.

=== Other dimensions ===
Most of the analytic results are easily understood, in a more general form, using the machinery of differential geometry, of which vector calculus forms a subset. Grad and div generalize immediately to other dimensions, as do the gradient theorem, divergence theorem, and Laplacian (yielding harmonic analysis), while curl and cross product do not generalize as directly.

From a general point of view, the various fields in (3-dimensional) vector calculus are uniformly seen as being -vector fields: scalar fields are 0-vector fields, vector fields are 1-vector fields, pseudovector fields are 2-vector fields, and pseudoscalar fields are 3-vector fields. In higher dimensions there are additional types of fields (scalar, vector, pseudovector or pseudoscalar corresponding to , , or dimensions, which is exhaustive in dimension 3), so one cannot only work with (pseudo)scalars and (pseudo)vectors.

In any dimension, assuming a nondegenerate form, grad of a scalar function is a vector field, and div of a vector field is a scalar function, but only in dimension 3 or 7 (and, trivially, in dimension 0 or 1) is the curl of a vector field a vector field, and only in 3 or 7 dimensions can a cross product be defined (generalizations in other dimensionalities either require formula_5 vectors to yield 1 vector, or are alternative Lie algebras, which are more general antisymmetric bilinear products). The generalization of grad and div, and how curl may be generalized is elaborated at &quot;Curl § Generalizations&quot;; in brief, the curl of a vector field is a bivector field, which may be interpreted as the special orthogonal Lie algebra of infinitesimal rotations; however, this cannot be identified with a vector field because the dimensions differ – there are 3 dimensions of rotations in 3 dimensions, but 6 dimensions of rotations in 4 dimensions (and more generally formula_6 dimensions of rotations in dimensions).

There are two important alternative generalizations of vector calculus. The first, geometric algebra, uses -vector fields instead of vector fields (in 3 or fewer dimensions, every -vector field can be identified with a scalar function or vector field, but this is not true in higher dimensions). This replaces the cross product, which is specific to 3 dimensions, taking in two vector fields and giving as output a vector field, with the exterior product, which exists in all dimensions and takes in two vector fields, giving as output a bivector (2-vector) field. This product yields Clifford algebras as the algebraic structure on vector spaces (with an orientation and nondegenerate form). Geometric algebra is mostly used in generalizations of physics and other applied fields to higher dimensions.

The second generalization uses differential forms (-covector fields) instead of vector fields or -vector fields, and is widely used in mathematics, particularly in differential geometry, geometric topology, and harmonic analysis, in particular yielding Hodge theory on oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. From this point of view, grad, curl, and div correspond to the exterior derivative of 0-forms, 1-forms, and 2-forms, respectively, and the key theorems of vector calculus are all special cases of the general form of Stokes&#x27; theorem.

From the point of view of both of these generalizations, vector calculus implicitly identifies mathematically distinct objects, which makes the presentation simpler but the underlying mathematical structure and generalizations less clear.
From the point of view of geometric algebra, vector calculus implicitly identifies -vector fields with vector fields or scalar functions: 0-vectors and 3-vectors with scalars, 1-vectors and 2-vectors with vectors. From the point of view of differential forms, vector calculus implicitly identifies -forms with scalar fields or vector fields: 0-forms and 3-forms with scalar fields, 1-forms and 2-forms with vector fields. Thus for example the curl naturally takes as input a vector field or 1-form, but naturally has as output a 2-vector field or 2-form (hence pseudovector field), which is then interpreted as a vector field, rather than directly taking a vector field to a vector field; this is reflected in the curl of a vector field in higher dimensions not having as output a vector field.

<doc id="32641" wikidata="Q553321" url="?curid=32641" title="Vince Lombardi">
<text>Vincent Thomas Lombardi ( ; June 11, 1913 – September 3, 1970) was an American professional football coach and executive in the National Football League (NFL). Lombardi is considered by many to be among the greatest coaches and leaders in American sports. He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls at the conclusion of the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons.

Lombardi began his coaching career as an assistant and later as head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was assistant coach at Fordham University where he coached with Jim Lansing. He also coached for the United States Military Academy and the New York Giants before serving as head coach and general manager for the Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins from 1969 until dying from cancer during the 1970 preseason.

Lombardi never had a losing season as head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular-season winning percentage of 73.8% (96–34–6) and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses and 6 ties in the NFL. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and the NFL Super Bowl trophy was named in his honor.

== Early life ==
Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913, in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico &quot;Harry&quot; Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda &quot;Mattie&quot; Izzo (1891–1972). Harry&#x27;s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie&#x27;s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings, and Matilda had twelve. Vince was the oldest of five children, including Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. Both the Lombardi and Izzo clans settled entirely in Sheepshead Bay.
Anthony opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi&#x27;s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry&#x27;s shop did well, and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.

Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with extended family members, friends, and local clergy. Lombardi himself was an altar boy at St. Mark Catholic Church. Outside their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant ethnic discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants and their descendants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.

=== High school ===
Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at age 15 in 1928. He then enrolled in the Cathedral Preparatory Seminary, a division of Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school&#x27;s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity. His performance as a fullback on the Terriers&#x27; football team earned him a position on the virtual All-City football team.

=== Fordham University ===
In 1933, Lombardi received a football scholarship to Fordham University in the Bronx to play for the Fordham Rams and Coach Jim Crowley, who was one of the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame in the 1920s. During his freshman year, Lombardi proved to be an aggressive and spirited player on the football field. Prior to the beginning of his sophomore year, Lombardi was projected to start games at the tackle position. Lombardi was only 5&#x27;8&quot; and about 180 pounds and was classified as undersized for the position.

In his senior year of 1936, he was the right guard in the Seven Blocks of Granite, a nickname given by a Fordham University publicist to the Fordham University football team&#x27;s offensive front line. In a game against Pitt, he suffered a severe gash inside his mouth and had several teeth knocked out. He missed most of the remainder of the game, until he was called in on defense for a successful goal-line stand that preserved a scoreless tie. The Rams were 5–0–2 before losing in the final game of the season, 7–6, to NYU. The loss destroyed all hopes of Fordham playing in the Rose Bowl and taught Lombardi a lesson he would never forget — to never underestimate your opponent.

=== Early career ===
Lombardi graduated from Fordham University on June 16, 1937. The nation was still plagued by the Great Depression, so there were few career opportunities for the young Lombardi, and for the next two years, he showed no discernible career path or ambition. He tried to play semi-professional football with the Wilmington Clippers of the American Association and worked as a debt collector for a collection agency, but those efforts very quickly proved to be failures. With his father&#x27;s strong support, he enrolled in Fordham Law School in September 1938. Although he did not fail any classes, he believed his grades were so poor that he dropped out after one semester. Later in life, he would explain to others that he was close to graduating, but his desire to start and support a family forced him to leave law school and get a job. He also joined the Brooklyn Eagles.

== Coaching career ==
=== St. Cecilia High School ===
In 1939, Lombardi wanted to marry his girlfriend, Marie Planitz, but he deferred at his father&#x27;s insistence because he needed a steady job to support himself and a family; he married Marie the following year. In 1939, Lombardi accepted an assistant coaching job at St. Cecilia, a Catholic high school in Englewood, New Jersey. He was offered the position by the school&#x27;s new head coach, Lombardi&#x27;s former Fordham teammate, quarterback Andy Palau. Palau had just inherited the head coaching position from another Fordham teammate, Nat Pierce (left guard), who had accepted an assistant coach&#x27;s job back at Fordham. In addition to coaching, Lombardi, age 26, taught Latin, chemistry, and physics for an annual salary of under $1,000.

In 1942, Andy Palau left St. Cecilia&#x27;s for another position at Fordham, and Lombardi became the head coach at St. Cecilia&#x27;s. He stayed a total of eight years, five as head coach. In 1943, St. Cecilia&#x27;s was recognized as the top high school football team in the nation, in large part because of their victory over Brooklyn Prep, a Jesuit school considered one of the best teams in the eastern United States. Brooklyn Prep that season was led by senior Joe Paterno, who, like Lombardi, was to rise to legendary status in football. Lombardi won six state private school championships (NJISAA - New Jersey Independent Schools Athletic Association), and became the president of the Bergen County Coaches&#x27; Association.

=== Fordham ===
In 1947, Lombardi became the coach of freshman teams in football and basketball at his alma mater, Fordham University. The following year, he was an assistant coach for the varsity football team under head coach Ed Danowski, but he was arguably the &quot;de facto&quot; head coach.

=== West Point ===
Following the 1948 season, Lombardi accepted an assistant coaching job at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, a position that greatly influenced his future philosophy and system of coaching. He was offensive line coach under head coach Earl &quot;Colonel Red&quot; Blaik. &quot;As integral as religion was to [Lombardi&#x27;s] sense of self, it was not until he reached West Point and combined his spiritual discipline with Blaik&#x27;s military discipline that his coaching persona began to take its mature form.&quot; Blaik&#x27;s emphasis on execution became a trademark of Lombardi&#x27;s coaching style. Lombardi coached at West Point for five seasons, with varying results. The 1949 and 1950 seasons were successful, but the 1951 and 1952 seasons were not, due to the aftermath of a cadet cheating scandal (a violation of the Cadet Honor Code) which was uncovered in spring 1951. By order of the Superintendent, 43 of the 45 members of the varsity football team were discharged from the academy as a result of the scandal. &quot;Decades later, looking back on his rise, Lombardi came to regard ...&quot; Blaik&#x27;s decision not to resign &quot;... as a pivotal moment in his [own] career&quot; — it taught him &quot;perseverance&quot;. Blaik himself was and remains a highly controversial figure, in Army football and academic history. After the 1951 and 1952 seasons, not much was expected from the 1953 team as it had also lost six players due to academic misconduct. The 1953 team, however, did achieve a 7–1–1 record, as Lombardi had a bigger role than ever in coaching the team. Following these five seasons at Army, Lombardi accepted an assistant coaching position with the New York Giants.

=== New York Giants ===
At age 41 in 1954, Lombardi began his NFL career with the New York Giants. He accepted a job that later became known as the offensive coordinator position under new head coach Jim Lee Howell. The Giants had finished the previous season under 23-year coach Steve Owen with a 3–9 record. By his third season in 1956, Lombardi, along with the defensive coordinator, former All-Pro cornerback turned coach Tom Landry, turned the squad into a championship team, defeating the Chicago Bears 47–7 for the league title. &quot;Howell readily acknowledged the talents of Lombardi and Landry, and joked self-deprecatingly, that his main function was to make sure the footballs had air in them.&quot; At points in his tenure as an assistant coach at West Point, and as an assistant coach with the Giants, Lombardi worried that he was unable to land a head coaching job due to prejudice against his Italian heritage, especially with respect to Southern colleges. Howell wrote numerous recommendations for Lombardi to aid him in obtaining a head coaching position. Lombardi applied for head coaching positions at Wake Forest, Notre Dame, and other universities and, in some cases, never received a reply. In New York, Lombardi introduced the strategy of rule blocking to the NFL. In rule blocking, the offensive lineman would block an area, and not necessarily a particular defensive player, as was the norm up to that time. The running back was then expected to run towards any hole that was created. Lombardi referred to this as &quot;running to daylight&quot;.

=== Green Bay Packers ===
==== 1959 ====
The Green Bay Packers, with six future Hall of Famers on the roster in 1958, finished at 1–10–1 under head coach Ray McLean, the worst record in Packers history. The players were dispirited, the Packers shareholders were disheartened, and the Green Bay community was enraged. The angst in Green Bay extended to the NFL as a whole, as the financial viability and the very existence of the Green Bay Packer franchise were in jeopardy. On February 2, 1959, Lombardi accepted the position of head coach and general manager of the Packers. He demanded and gained full control over the football operations of the community-owned franchise, leaving no doubt of this when he told the franchise&#x27;s executive committee, &quot;I want it understood that I am in complete command here.&quot;

Lombardi&#x27;s assertion of &quot;complete command&quot; applied to the players as well. For his first training camp, he instituted harsh regimens and demanded absolute dedication and effort from his players. The Packers immediately improved in 1959 to 7–5, and rookie head coach Lombardi was named Coach of the Year. The fans appreciated what Lombardi was trying to do and responded by purchasing all the tickets for every home game during the 1960 season. Every Packers home game—preseason, regular season and playoffs—has been sold out ever since then.

==== 1960–1966 ====
In Lombardi&#x27;s second year in 1960, Green Bay won the NFL Western Conference for the first time since 1944. This victory, along with his well-known religious convictions, led the Green Bay community to anoint Lombardi with the nickname &quot;The Pope&quot;. Lombardi led the Packers to the Championship Game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Before the championship game, Lombardi met with Wellington Mara and advised him that he would not take the Giants&#x27; head coaching job, which was initially offered after the end of the 1959 season. In the final play of the game, in a drive that would have won it, the Packers were stopped a few yards from the goal line. Lombardi had suffered his first and only championship game loss. After the game, and after the press corps had left the locker room, Lombardi told his team, &quot;This will never happen again. You will never lose another championship.&quot; In later years as coach of the Packers, Lombardi made it a point to admonish his running backs that if they failed to score from one yard out, he would consider it a personal affront to him and he would seek retribution. He coached the Packers to win their next nine post-season games, a record streak not matched or broken until Bill Belichick won ten straight from 2002 to 2006 with New England. The Packers defeated the Giants for the NFL title in 1961 (37–0 in Green Bay) and 1962 (16–7 at Yankee Stadium), marking the first two of their five titles in Lombardi&#x27;s seven years. After the 1962 championship victory, President John F. Kennedy called Lombardi and asked him if he would &quot;come back to Army and coach again&quot;. Kennedy received Lombardi&#x27;s tacit refusal of the request. His only other post-season loss occurred to the St. Louis Cardinals in the third-place Playoff Bowl after the 1964 season (officially classified as an exhibition game).

Including postseason but excluding exhibition games, Lombardi compiled a 105–35–6 (.740) record as head coach, and never suffered a losing season. He led the Packers to three consecutive NFL championships — in 1965, 1966, and 1967 — a feat accomplished only once before in the history of the league, by Curly Lambeau, co-founder of the Packers, who coached the team to their first three straight NFL Championships in 1929, 1930, and 1931. At the conclusion of the 1966 and 1967 seasons, Lombardi&#x27;s Packers won the first two Super Bowls, for championships in five of seven seasons.

==== Packers Sweep ====

As coach of the Packers, Lombardi converted Notre Dame quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Paul Hornung to a full-time halfback. Lombardi also designed a play for fullback Jim Taylor: both guards, Jerry Kramer and Fuzzy Thurston, pulled to the outside and blocked downfield while Taylor would &quot;run to daylight&quot; — i.e., wherever the defenders weren&#x27;t. This was a play that he had originally developed with the Giants for Frank Gifford. It soon became known as the Packers sweep (or Lombardi sweep), though Lombardi openly admitted it was based on an old single wing concept.

===== Ice Bowl =====

In 1967, Lombardi&#x27;s Packers hosted the Dallas Cowboys in Green Bay on December 31 in the NFL Championship Game, a rematch of the previous season. This became known as the &quot;Ice Bowl&quot; because of the game-time temperature. Lombardi had a heating coil underneath the field but on this day it was not functioning. Some people believe that he turned it off on purpose. With 16 seconds left in the game and down by three points, the Packers called their final time-out. It was 3rd and goal on the Dallas two-foot line. In the huddle, with the game on the line, quarterback Bart Starr asked Kramer whether he could get enough traction on the icy turf for a wedge play and Kramer responded with an unequivocal yes. Starr came over to Lombardi on the sidelines to discuss the last play and told him he wanted to run a 31 wedge, but with him keeping the ball. Lombardi, having had enough of the bitter cold, told Starr to &#x27;Run it! And let&#x27;s get the hell out of here!&#x27; Lombardi was asked by Pat Peppler what play Starr would call, to which Lombardi replied, &#x27;Damned if I know.&#x27; Starr returned to the huddle and called a Brown right 31 Wedge, but with him keeping the ball. Kramer blocked Jethro Pugh low and Ken Bowman hit Pugh high as Starr followed them into the end zone for the Packer lead and gained victory. Shortly after the victory in Super Bowl II, Lombardi resigned as head coach of the Packers on February 1, 1968, continuing as general manager. He handed the head coaching position to Phil Bengtson, a longtime assistant, but the Packers finished at 6–7–1 in the 1968 season and were out of the four-team NFL playoffs.

=== Washington Redskins ===
In February 1969, Lombardi was let out of his contract with the Packers to become the head coach and executive vice president of the Washington Redskins. As with the Packers, Lombardi was given full control over football operations and a 5% stake in ownership. The Redskins finished the 1969 season at 7–5–2, their first winning record since 1955, but Lombardi died shortly before the start of the 1970 season. Lombardi was credited with having changed the culture and laying the foundation for Washington&#x27;s success in the 1970s under George Allen.

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===
In 1934, Lombardi&#x27;s roommate Jim Lawlor introduced him to his cousin&#x27;s relative, Marie Planitz. When Marie announced her ardent desire to marry Lombardi, her status-conscious stockbroker father did not like the idea of his daughter marrying the son of an Italian butcher from Brooklyn, a prejudice he would face more than once in his life. Lombardi and Marie wed on August 31, 1940.

Marie&#x27;s first pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage. This had a terrible effect on Marie and caused her to turn to heavy drinking, a problem she would encounter on more than one occasion in her life. Their son, Vincent Henry Lombardi (Vince Jr.), was born in 1942, and their daughter Susan followed five years later in 1947.

Lombardi&#x27;s perfectionism, authoritarian nature and temper, required that Marie learn to defend herself when Lombardi verbally abused her. His children were not immune from his yelling. When Lombardi had not lost his temper, he would often be reticent and aloof.

Lombardi&#x27;s grandson, Joe Lombardi, has served as an assistant coach in the NFL since 2006. Joe is currently the offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos.

===World War II deferments===
Though he was 28 years old when the United States entered World War II, Lombardi did not serve in the war. He obtained a series of deferments: his first was a 2-A due to his teaching occupation; in 1943, he obtained a second deferment due to parenthood (3-A); and his final deferment was labelled a 4-A (age) and given in April 1944.

===Religion===
The three constants throughout Lombardi&#x27;s life were his Roman Catholic religion, his family, and football. His father was a daily Communicant throughout his life and his mother&#x27;s favorite picture of Vince as a child was on his Confirmation. When Lombardi was 12, while serving as an altar boy on Easter Sunday, &quot;... amid the color and pageantry scarlet and white vestments, golden cross, scepters, the wafers and wine, body and blood ... the inspiration came to him that he should become a priest ...&quot;. When his mother, Mattie, got wind of it she bragged about her son&#x27;s plan to her neighbors. Lombardi attended Mass on a daily basis throughout his life.

During his tenure at St. Cecilia, Lombardi attended Mass every day and &quot;prayed for calm and control: of his temper and ... his wife&#x27;s drinking&quot;. When Lombardi became head coach of football in 1942, he led his team to Sunday Mass before each home game. At St. Cecilia, Lombardi shared an office with Father Tim Moore wherein it was not unusual for Lombardi to interrupt a conversation and request to go to Confession and for which Father Tim obliged him right in the office.

During his stay at Green Bay, Lombardi once emerged from his office and appeared before his secretary, Ruth McKloskey, wearing &quot;... all these priest robes on, and he had a miter with a tassel, everything&quot;. Each day on his way to work for the Green Bay Packers, Lombardi would stop at St. Willebrord Church and &quot;offer a prayer in case of unexpected death: &#x27;My God, if I am to die today, or suddenly at any time, I wish to receive this Communion as my viaticum ... &#x27;&quot;. He regularly attended Sunday Mass at Resurrection Church in the Allouez neighborhood of Green Bay&#x27;s southeast side, always sitting with his wife in the middle of the ninth pew.

On the morning of the dedication of Lombardi Avenue, Lombardi remarked to his 37-member entourage that he was pleased to have gotten them all up to attend morning Mass. Lombardi was a Fourth Degree in the Knights of Columbus.

=== Anti-discrimination philosophy ===
In 1960, a color barrier still existed on at least one team in the NFL, but Jack Vainisi, the Scouting Director for the Packers, and Lombardi were determined &quot;to ignore the prejudices then prevalent in most NFL front offices in their search for the most talented players&quot;. Lombardi explained his views by saying that he &quot;... viewed his players as neither black nor white, but Packer green&quot;.

Among professional football head coaches, in the midst of the civil rights movement, Lombardi&#x27;s anti-discrimination views were unusual. When Lombardi joined the Packers, they only had one black player, Nate Borden. During his time as coach the team became fully integrated: by 1967 they had 13 black players, including All-Pros Willie Davis, Willie Wood, Dave Robinson, Herb Adderley and Bob Jeter.

During his first training camp in Green Bay, Lombardi was notified by Packer veterans that an interracial relationship existed between one of the Packer rookies and a young woman. The next day at training camp, Lombardi—who was vehemently opposed to Jim Crow discrimination and had a zero-tolerance policy towards racism—responded by warning his team that if any player exhibited prejudice in any manner, that specific player would be thrown off the team.

Lombardi let it be known to all Green Bay establishments that if they did not accommodate his black and white players equally well, then that business would be off-limits to the entire team. Before the start of the 1960 regular season, he instituted a policy that the Packers would only lodge in places that accepted all his players. Lombardi also refused to assign hotel rooms to players based on their race: by 1967 the Packers were the only NFL team with such a policy.

Lombardi was a member of the all-white Oneida Golf and Riding Country Club in Green Bay, and he demanded that he should be allowed to choose a Native American caddie, even if white caddies were available. Lombardi&#x27;s view on racial matters was a result of his religious faith and the ethnic prejudice that he had experienced as an Italian-American.

While with the Redskins in 1969, at Lombardi&#x27;s insistence and with the support of then-minority owner Jack Kent Cooke, Hall of Fame wide receiver Bobby Mitchell joined the Redskins&#x27; front office, becoming the first African American to work in an NFL front office, and eventually becoming the NFL&#x27;s first African American executive, working his way up to assistant general manager in 1981.

Lombardi was known to be volatile and terse with players during practices and games, and he insisted on unconditional respect for everyone in his organization. Lombardi demanded acceptance from players and coaches toward all people and was noted for his stance against homophobia. According to Lombardi biographer and Pulitzer Prize–winning writer David Maraniss, if he caught a coach &quot;discriminating against a player thought to be gay, he&#x27;d be fired&quot;. Richard Nicholls, the lifelong partner of Lombardi&#x27;s younger brother, Hal, stated, &quot;Vin was always fair in how he treated everybody ... a great man who accepted people at face value for what they were, and didn&#x27;t judge anybody. He just wanted you to do the job.&quot;

In Washington, Lombardi&#x27;s assistant general manager David Slatterly was gay, as was PR director Joe Blair, who was described as Lombardi&#x27;s &quot;right-hand man&quot;. According to his son Vince Lombardi Jr., &quot;He saw everyone as equals, and I think having a gay brother (Hal) was a big factor in his approach ... I think my father would&#x27;ve felt, &#x27;I hope I&#x27;ve created an atmosphere in the locker room where this would not be an issue at all. And if you do have an issue, the problem will be yours because my locker room will tolerate nothing but acceptance.

Upon his arrival in Washington, Lombardi was aware of tight end Jerry Smith&#x27;s sexual orientation. &quot;Lombardi protected and loved Jerry,&quot; said former teammate Dave Kopay. Lombardi brought Smith into his office and told him that his sexual orientation would never be an issue as long as he was coaching the Redskins; Smith would be judged solely on his on-the-field performance and contribution to the team&#x27;s success. Under Lombardi&#x27;s leadership Smith flourished, becoming an integral part of Lombardi&#x27;s offense, and was voted a First Team All-Pro for the first time in his career, which was also Lombardi&#x27;s only season as the Redskins head coach.

Lombardi invited other gay players to training camp and would privately hope they would prove they could earn a spot on the team. In Lombardi&#x27;s first season with the Washington Redskins, he took interest in Ray McDonald, a gay running back recruited to the team in 1967. McDonald had been handpicked by owner Edward Bennet Williams, but was a disappointment in his rookie year and spent most of the 1968 season on the bench with an injury. Lombardi told running back coach, George Dickson, &#x27;I want you to get on McDonald and work on him and work on him – and if I hear &quot;one&quot; of you people make reference to his manhood, you&#x27;ll be out of here before your ass hits the ground.&#x27;

=== Politics ===
Although his wife was a Republican, Lombardi was a lifelong Democrat with liberal views on civil rights: he supported John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election, Robert F. Kennedy in the 1968 primaries, and was also a supporter of Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson. Despite this, during the 1960s he became uncomfortable with the burgeoning youth protest movements associated with the emerging counterculture, such as the New Left and the Anti-war movement. In a speech that he first delivered in February 1967 to the American Management Association, he suggested that &quot;everything has been done to strengthen the rights of the individual and at the same time weaken the rights of the church, weaken the rights of the state, and weaken the rights of all authority&quot;. Due to Lombardi&#x27;s popularity, Richard Nixon once considered him as a possible running mate in the 1968 presidential election but dropped the idea upon learning about Lombardi&#x27;s support for the Democratic Party.

==Illness and death==
Lombardi had suffered from digestive tract problems as early as 1967, and he had refused his doctor&#x27;s request to undergo a proctoscopic exam. On June 24, 1970, Lombardi was admitted to Georgetown University Hospital, and tests &quot;revealed anaplastic carcinoma in the rectal area of his colon, a fast-growing malignant cancer in which the cells barely resemble their normal appearance&quot;. On July 27, Lombardi was readmitted to Georgetown and exploratory surgery found that the cancer was terminal. Lombardi and Marie received family, friends, clergy, players, and former players at his hospital bedside. He received a phone call from President Nixon telling Lombardi that all of the U.S. was behind him, to which Lombardi replied that he would never give up his fight against his illness. On his deathbed, Lombardi told Father Tim that he was not afraid to die, but that he regretted he could not have accomplished more in his life. Lombardi died in Washington, D.C. at 7:12 a.m. on Thursday, September 3, 1970, surrounded by his wife, parents, both children, and six grandchildren. He was 57.

The funeral was held on September 7 at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Manhattan. Approximately 1,500 people lined Fifth Avenue, and the avenue was closed to traffic between 39th and 50th Street. Cardinal Terence Cooke preached the homily. In attendance were team officials, coaches Tom Landry, Dick Nolan, Weeb Ewbank, Alex Webster, Norm Van Brocklin, Phil Bengtson and Bill Austin, Commissioner Pete Rozelle, past and present members of the Packers, Redskins, and Giants, broadcasters Ray Scott and Howard Cosell, former students from Saints, colleagues and players from West Point (including Red Blaik), and classmates from Fordham University, including the remaining Seven Blocks of Granite. Lombardi was interred in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Middletown Township, New Jersey; before Super Bowl XLVIII was played at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey in 2014, the cemetery&#x27;s superintendent sought to have the Vince Lombardi Trophy brought to his gravesite.

==In popular culture==
In 1968, Lombardi starred in a half-hour motivational film titled &quot;Second Effort&quot;, which has been called &quot;The best-selling training film of all time&quot;.

On December 14, 1973, ABC aired &quot;Legend in Granite&quot; starring Ernest Borgnine as Vince. The biographical TV drama focused mostly on his first two seasons as Packers head coach (1959–1960).

A service area on the New Jersey Turnpike dedicated to and named after Lombardi opened in 1974.

The high school in the 1979 movie &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot; is named Vince Lombardi High School.

In 1986, CHCH aired the TV movie &quot;Lombardi: I Am Not a Legend&quot; starring Robert Knuckle in the title role depicting Lombardi&#x27;s life up until the NFL.

In 1996, Nike aired several commercials featuring Jerry Stiller as the ghost of Lombardi.

In 2005, ESPN produced &quot;Code Breakers&quot;, depicting the West Point cheating scandal and its effect on the football program. Richard Zeppieri played then-Assistant Coach Lombardi.

A play titled &quot;Lombardi&quot; opened on Broadway at the Circle in the Square Theatre in New York City in October 2010, following an out-of-town tryout at the Mahaiwe Theater in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. The production starred Dan Lauria as Lombardi and Judith Light as his wife, Marie. The play received positive reviews, as did Lauria&#x27;s performance.

NFL Films and HBO produced a film about Lombardi that debuted Saturday, December 11, 2010.

<doc id="32642" wikidata="Q769541" url="?curid=32642" title="Viz (comics)">
<text>Viz is a British adult comic magazine founded in 1979 by Chris Donald. It parodies British comics of the post-war period, notably &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot;, but with extensive profanity, toilet humour, black comedy, surreal humour and generally sexual or violent storylines. It also sends up tabloid newspapers, with mockeries of articles and letters pages. It features parody competitions and advertisements for overpriced &#x27;limited edition&#x27; , as well as obsessions with half-forgotten kitsch celebrities from the 1960s to the 1980s, such as Shakin&#x27; Stevens and Rodney Bewes. Occasionally, it satirises current affairs and politicians, but it has no particular political standpoint.

Its success in the early 1990s led to the appearance of numerous rivals copying the format &quot;Viz&quot; pioneered; none of them managed to attain its popularity. Circulation peaked at 1.2 million in the early 1990s, making it the third-most popular magazine in the UK, but ABC-audited sales have since dropped, to an average of 48,588 per issue in 2018. The 300th issue was published in October 2020.

==History==

The comic was started in Newcastle upon Tyne in December 1979 by Chris Donald, who produced the comic from his bedroom in his parents&#x27; Jesmond home with help from his brother Simon and friend Jim Brownlow. Donald himself cannot remember exactly where the name of the magazine comes from. The most he can remember is: at the time, he needed to come up with a proper name for it, and he considered the word &quot;Viz&quot; a very easy word to write/remember, as it consisted of three letters which are easily made with straight lines.

It came about at around the time, and in the spirit of, the punk fanzines, and used alternative methods of distribution, such as the prominent DIY record label and shop Falling A Records, which was an early champion of the comic. The first 12-page issue was produced as a fanzine for a local record label &#x27;Anti-Pop records&#x27; run by Arthur 2 Stroke and Andy &#x27;Pop&#x27; Inman, and went on sale for 20p (30p to students) in the Gosforth Hotel, which hosted &#x27;Anti-Pop&#x27; punk gigs, and the run of 150 copies had sold out within hours. The second issue was published three months later in March 1980, with the next ten issues being published at irregular intervals until November 1984. Issue ten from May 1983 was the first to feature the current &quot;Viz&quot; logo. The &#x27;best&#x27; of &quot;Viz Comics&quot; issues one to four was published in November 1983 as issue 10½. After a few years of steady sales, mostly in the North East of England, circulation had grown to around 5,000 by December 1984. This may have been boosted by the appearance in the BBC2 documentary series &#x27;Sparks&#x27; (episode 4 &#x27;The Young Guns&#x27;) which first aired in March/April 1984 and was repeated on BBC1. A further special edition was issued in May 1985 as issue 12a.

What had begun as a few pages, photocopied and sold to friends, became a publishing phenomenon. To meet the demand, and to make up for Brownlow&#x27;s diminishing interest in contributing, freelance artist Graham Dury was hired and worked alongside Chris Donald. 
As the magazine&#x27;s popularity grew, the bedroom became too small and production moved to a nearby Jesmond office. Donald also hired another freelance artist, Simon Thorp, whose work had impressed him. For over a decade, these four would be the nucleus of &quot;Viz&quot;.

In 1985, a deal was signed with Virgin Books to publish the comic nationally every two months, starting with the 13th issue, dated August 1985. In 1987, the Virgin director responsible for &quot;Viz&quot;, John Brown, set up his own publishing company, John Brown Publishing, to handle &quot;Viz&quot;. Sales exceeded a million by the end of 1989, making &quot;Viz&quot; for a time one of the biggest-selling magazines in the country. Inevitably, a number of imitations of &quot;Viz&quot; were launched, but these never matched the original in popularity, and rarely in quality.

Sales steadily declined from the mid-1990s to around 200,000 in 2001, by which time Chris Donald had resigned as editor and passed control to an &quot;editorial cabinet&quot; comprising his brother Simon, Dury, Thorp and new recruits Davey Jones and Alex Collier. In June 2001, the comic was acquired as part of a £6.4 million deal by I Feel Good (IFG), a company belonging to ex-&quot;Loaded&quot; editor James Brown, and increased in frequency to ten times a year. In 2003, it changed hands again when IFG were bought out by Dennis Publishing. Soon after, Simon Donald quit his role as co-editor, in an attempt to develop a career in television. In July 2018, Dennis Publishing were bought by Exponent, a British private equity firm.

Much of the non-cartoon material such as the newspaper spoofs are written by the editorial team – Graham Dury, Simon Thorp and Davey Jones – with contributions from Robin Halstead, Jason Hazeley, Joel Morris and Alex Morris, the authors of &quot;The Framley Examiner&quot;, and by James MacDougall, Christina Martin and Paul Roberts.

&quot;Viz&quot; and several Dennis Publishing titles including &quot;Cyclist&quot;, &quot;Expert Reviews&quot;, and &quot;Fortean Times&quot; were retained by Exponent when the company and most of its titles were sold to competitor Future plc in 2021 and by then operating as Viz Holdings Ltd, part of Broadleaf Group.

Metropolis International acquired several titles from Broadleaf Group in December 2021, including &quot;Viz&quot;.

==Notable strips==

Many &quot;Viz&quot; characters have featured in long-running strips, becoming well known in their own right, including spin-off cartoons. Characters often have rhyming or humorous taglines, such as Roger Mellie, the Man on the Telly; Nobby&#x27;s Piles; Johnny Fartpants; Buster Gonad; Sid the Sexist; Sweary Mary or Finbarr Saunders and his Double Entendres. Others are based on stereotypes of British culture, mostly via working class characters, such as Biffa Bacon, Cockney Wanker and The Fat Slags. Some are aimed upwards, parodying the upper-middle classes and elites, such as the pseudo-leftist but privileged &#x27;Student Grant&#x27;, &#x27;Nanny No Dumps&#x27; and the hypocritical Tory MP &#x27;Baxter Basics&#x27;, named after John Major&#x27;s &quot;Back to Basics&quot; speech. In addition to this, the comic also contains plenty of &#x27;in jokes&#x27; referring to people and places in and around Newcastle upon Tyne.

Many strips appear only once. These very often have extremely surreal or bizarre storylines, and often feature celebrities. For example: &quot;Paul Daniels&#x27;s Jet-Ski Journey to the Centre of Elvis&quot;, and &quot;Arse Farm – Young Pete and Jenny Nostradamus were spending the holidays with their Uncle Jed, who farmed arses deep in the heart of the Sussex countryside...&quot;. The latter type often follows the style of Enid Blyton and other popular children&#x27;s adventure stories of the 1950s. Several strips were single-panel, one-off puns, such as &quot;Daft Bugger&quot;, which featured two bored, uninterested men engaged in the act of buggery; the buggerer then states that he has forgotten his car keys (thus making him &quot;daft&quot;).

The one-off strips often have ludicrously alliterative and/or rhyming titles, for example: &quot;Reverend Milo&#x27;s Lino Rhino&quot;, &quot;Max&#x27;s Laxative Saxophone Taxi&#x27;, and &quot;Scottie Trotter&#x27;s Tottie Alottment&quot;. Some strips are built entirely around absurd puns, such as &quot;Noah&#x27;s Arse&quot; and &quot;Feet and Two Reg&quot;.

Most of the stories take place in the fictitious town of Fulchester. Originally the setting of the British TV programme &quot;Crown Court&quot;, the name was adopted by the &quot;Viz&quot; team. Billy the Fish plays for Fulchester United F.C. There is innuendo in the name: the Internet domain fuck.co.uk was at one time held by fans of &quot;Viz&quot; who claimed to be promoting the Fulchester Underwater Canoeing Klubb. A significant number of strips, most of which centre on child characters, are set in Barnton.

One of the most pun-based strips was &quot;George Bestial&quot;, about famous footballer George Best committing bestiality. The strip was discontinued after the death of Best, but has since reappeared.

&quot;Viz&quot; also lampoons political ideas – both left-wing ideals, in strips such as &quot;The Modern Parents&quot; (and to an extent in &quot;Student Grant&quot;), and right-wing ones such as &quot;Baxter Basics&quot;, &quot;Major Misunderstanding&quot;, &quot;Victorian Dad&quot; and numerous strips involving tabloid columnists Garry Bushell (&quot;Garry Bushell the Bear&quot;) and Richard Littlejohn (&quot;Richard Littlecock&quot; and &quot;Robin Hood and Richard Littlejohn&quot;), portraying them as obsessed with homosexuality, political correctness and non-existent left-wing conspiracies to the exclusion of all else. Holocaust denier David Irving featured as Dick Dastardly in the &quot;Wacky Races&quot; spoof, &quot;Wacky Racists&quot;.

In keeping with the comic&#x27;s irreverent and deliberately non-conformist style, the Duke of Edinburgh was portrayed as a culturally insensitive, dim-witted xenophobe in a strip &quot;HRH The Duke of Edinburgh and his Jocular Larks&quot;, about the Duke making outrageously ill-informed comments to a young Chinese victim of the collapse of a residential block.

Occasionally, celebrities are granted the &#x27;honour&#x27; of strips all to themselves. Billy Connolly has had more than one about him trying to ingratiate himself with the Queen and Bob Hope had a strip featuring the comedian trying to think up amusing last words to utter on his deathbed (but ending up with a torrent of swearing). The singer Elton John has also appeared frequently in recent issues as a double-dealing Del Boy-type character attempting to pull off small-time criminal scams such as tobacco smuggling, benefit fraud and cheating on fruit machines. Most recently, he was seen posing as a window cleaner and conning customers to pay him, before being mistaken for a Peeping Tom and given a thorough hiding. The strips always end with Elton being beaten at his own game by one or more of his musical contemporaries from the 1970s and 1980s. Other celebs to have been featured in their own strips include Jonathan Ross, Russell Brand, Esther Rantzen, Stephen Fry, Noel Edmonds, Jimmy Savile (as the headmaster of &quot;Pop School&quot;, as &quot;Sir Jimmy Savile, the Owl&quot; and in &quot;Jimmy Savile&#x27;s Haunted Head&quot;), Johnny Vaughan, Adam Ant, Jimmy Hill, Noddy Holder, Boy George, Freddie Garrity, Steve McFadden, Morrissey (constantly finding daffodils stuck into the seat of his trousers, parodying his appearances on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;), Busted, Eminem, Big Daddy, Danny Baker and plenty more.

In 2002, British comedian Johnny Vegas sold the exclusive rights to his wedding photographs to Viz for £1, in a flippant dig at celebrity couples who sold the rights to their wedding photos to glossy magazines such as &quot;OK!&quot; for anything up to (and over) £1 million.

Serial killers Fred West and Harold Shipman have also featured in a strip as rival neighbours trying to kill the old woman next door and foiling each other&#x27;s plans (&quot;Harold and Fred – they make ladies dead!&quot;).

==Other content==

===Spoof news stories===
The comic also prints regular satirical pastiches of typical tabloid and local media news stories. One issue featured a small write-up of a wedding. However, in true &quot;Viz&quot; style, the wedding featured a lecherous groom marrying his pregnant (and significantly underaged) girlfriend, eyeing up her younger sister while being called a &quot;cradle-snatching cunt&quot; by her father (with the resulting fight prompting the bride&#x27;s mother to cry out &quot;less it, for fuck&#x27;s sake&quot; before the police arrived). Another such story revolved around a man who won an inconsequential amount of money on the pools, and began living an inordinately lavish lifestyle (&quot;I bought the wife a new cover for her ironing board&quot; being one such example of his largesse), which collapsed when the money inevitably ran out, much to his chagrin (&quot;I wish I&#x27;d never set eyes on the money&quot;).

Other stories include ludicrous &quot;kiss and tell&quot; and similar stories by people who are portrayed as mentally disturbed, often with highly bizarre elements; examples include allegations by a man who claimed that, on holiday touring in his caravan, he found a campsite run by Elvis Presley who, when plied with drink, admitted to the Kennedy assassination; another from a retired toilet attendant who described the nature of faeces from various little-known celebrities and an elderly woman who blames anti-social behaviour in her area on bored Newsnight presenters, as well as a mental home patient who claimed to have had sex with a number of children&#x27;s TV puppets. Another regular feature is a column by &#x27;Tony Parsehole&#x27;, a parody of columnist Tony Parsons who frequently writes obituaries about recently deceased celebrities filled entirely with metaphor and empty sentiment which stops abruptly once the required word count is reached (with a note that the invoice is included).

Additionally, there are often stories revolving around celebrities, some in the &quot;tell-all&quot; vein (such as a customs agent who claimed he found drugs in Pamela Anderson&#x27;s &quot;plastic tits&quot;). If one of a select band of frequently referenced stars is mentioned during these stories, they will be named humorously. Among others, Lemmy Kilmister will invariably be referred to as &quot;Lemmy out of Motörhead&quot;, Bono as &quot;Bonio&quot; and Sting as &quot;Sting (real name Gordon Sting)&quot;, mixing the singer&#x27;s birth and stage names. One particularly memorable piece of tabloid-esque wordplay parody, involving a fictional plot to assassinate Paul McCartney by a disgruntled former roadie, read &#x27;Top Pop Mop-Top Pot Shot Plot Flops&#x27;, or with a gonad-focused violent encounter with a deranged Mr. T and a 1970s playground toy, &#x27;Crackers Baracus turns Macca&#x27;s knackers into clackers&#x27;.

Photos in &quot;Viz&quot; news stories are often crudely edited and altered, much to the detriment of the subjects involved (teeth blacked out, facial features shrunken/enlarged, and so on). In the case of the aforementioned Lemmy, for one photo the editors simply took a picture of a man wearing a baseball cap and drew a crude approximation of Lemmy&#x27;s facial hair and warts on his face (as well as writing &quot;Motörhead&quot; on the cap). Photos will frequently be captioned only with the name of the subject and a comma followed by &quot;yesterday&quot;, e.g. &quot;A train, yesterday&quot;.

Following the format common in tabloid newspapers, paragraphs within written articles include &#x27;cross heads&#x27; which, in normal journalism, serve to indicate the theme of the following sections. In &quot;Viz&quot; however, while these words often start out being relevant to the story, they quickly stray for comedic value and therefore have little or no relevance to the following text. The words will often follow a theme, such as TV cops&#x27; names or types of curry, and will sometimes spell out a sentence, rarely relevant, if read separately from the story.

===Letterbocks===
This section features letters both written by the editors and sent in by readers often with ridiculous names, usually in the form of obviously fictitious anecdotes (one reader claimed that by defecating on the high seas, he was able to expel a single unbroken &quot;monster&quot; turd; however, nobody wanted to grant him research funds for further attempts) or various observations, such as the &quot;children say the funniest things&quot; type (one issue featured numerous variations of a reader&#x27;s young son making a reference to masturbation during bathtime, such as &quot;playing with [his] pork sword&quot;; in this case, when the reader entered the bathroom, she discovered her son had indeed fashioned a sword out of pork sausages). Since Viz claims to offer £5 for the best letter published in a particular issue, many letters end with the inquiry, &quot;Do I win £5?&quot;

Many make observations about celebrities (especially those who have recently died; one letter printed after the deaths of Gianni Versace and Princess Diana remarked on both their violent deaths and friendship with Elton John, stating &quot;I tell you what. If I was George Michael right about now, I&#x27;d be shitting myself&quot;) or current events (a 2000 issue remarked &quot;The Government spent £850 million on the Millennium Bug, and the only thing that crashes is Q [Desmond Llewelyn] out of the Bond films&quot;).

Most employ deliberate misunderstandings for comic effect (e.g. &quot;These so-called speed bumps are a joke. If anything they slow you down&quot; or &quot;I went to one of these so called Gentlemen&#x27;s clubs and was shocked to see it was full of Women. To make matters worse many of them were wearing very little clothing&quot;, or the letter whose writer mentioned seeing a TV listing for the film &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; and stating their doubt that it would top the story told by their friend about a night spent &quot;with a couple of strippers, a bottle of tequila, and some cocaine&quot;). Often letters feature simple yet absurd statements (&quot;I&#x27;m heading off to the pub in a few minutes and wondered if any of your readers fancied joining me for a pint&quot; or &quot;They say size doesn&#x27;t matter – if that&#x27;s true, why can&#x27;t I get these shoes on?&quot;), or improbable situations such as a letter writer responding directly to the letter that preceded theirs in the very same column and issue.

A bizarre series of letters from a J Cursiter of Bristol recounted his hobby of watching passers-by from &quot;a series of cunningly-disguised hides&quot;. It is unclear whether Cursiter is a reader of the comic or a creation of the editors.

Often letters are printed that criticise Viz, accusing it of &quot;not being as funny as it used to be&quot;, condemning it as being offensive or of complaining about the frequent price rises. These are often published and sometimes even framed in a small section titled &quot;Why I Love My Viz!&quot;, blatantly mocking &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper&#x27;s habit of printing (positive) comments in little frames titled &quot;Why I Love My Sun!&quot;

There are often invitations for readers to submit pictures, such as the request for examples of &quot;Insincere Smiles&quot;, whereby people sent in pictures cut from newspapers and brochures of celebrities and politicians caught smiling in a manner which looks utterly insincere and forced (Tony Blair featured at least twice). A similar series was of men who were wearing absurdly ill-fitting wigs. There&#x27;s also &quot;Up The Arse Corner&quot;, where photographs are submitted of people whose pose, and/or facial expression, could be misconstrued as being in the midst of an act of buggery; a notable example of this was when a letter requested a picture of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; actor Ernie Hudson leaning over to sign autographs in front of a cardboard standee of himself, with the writer requesting the picture of &quot;Winston Zeddemore bumming himself&quot;.

Letterbocks also formerly featured correspondence from, and has brought fame to, the late Abdul Latif, Lord of Harpole, proprietor of the (real) Curry Capital restaurant (formerly the Rupali), Bigg Market. His Lordship often promoted his restaurant with spoof competitions and offers. One, genuine, offer involved getting a 20% discount on orders at his restaurant by bringing in a copy of the current Viz ad for it and pointing at his picture excitedly. In December 2006, he appeared in a seasonal broadcast to rival the Queen&#x27;s Christmas message.

====&quot;Lame to Fame&quot;====
A semi-regular feature in Letterbocks is the &quot;Lame to Fame&quot; column, where writers can send in &quot;claims to fame&quot; where they explain their connection to well-known celebrities. The connections are distant or commonplace; for example: &quot;I once had a drink with a bloke who had caught Duran Duran&#x27;s Simon Le Bon&#x27;s dog after it had escaped from his big house&quot;, and &quot;My sister once shagged Ringo out of The Bootleg Beatles.&quot;

===Top Tips===
A long-running segment has been the &quot;Top Tips&quot;, reader-submitted suggestions which are a parody of similar sections found in women&#x27;s magazines offering domestic and everyday tips to make life easier. In &quot;Viz&quot;, naturally, they are always absurd, impractical or ludicrous:

* A small coniferous tree in the corner of your living room is an excellent place to store Christmas decorations
* Why waste money on expensive binoculars? Simply stand closer to the object you wish to observe
* To stop blue tits pecking at your milk bottles, don&#x27;t buy any
* Dead moths make ideal hang-gliders for woodlice
* Don&#x27;t invite drug addicts to your house on Boxing Day. They may find the offer of cold turkey embarrassing or offensive

Some tips are for ludicrous motives, such as &quot;how to convince neighbours that your house has dry rot&quot;, while others are for ostensibly sensible motives but with ridiculous and impractical suggestions for their application:

* Convince friends that you have a high powered job in the City by leaving for work at 6 am every morning, arriving home at 10 at night, never keeping social appointments and dropping down dead at the age of 36
* Save money on sex-lines by phoning up the Samaritans and threatening to kill yourself unless they talk dirty

Some are just inexplicable:

* To make your husband&#x27;s trousers heavier, hang onions from the belt loops.

Others inspire running jokes:

* Fun-sized Mars Bars make ideal normal-sized Mars Bars for dwarves
* Normal-sized Mars bars make ideal fun-sized Mars Bars for giants
* King-size Mars Bars make ideal normal-sized Mars Bars for giants
* Normal-sized Mars Bars make ideal king-sized Mars Bars for dwarves

A more recent trend is for sarcastic tips to be offered that are observations by the readers regarding other people&#x27;s behaviour, such as a barmaid who suggests male public house customers who are &quot;trying to get into a barmaid&#x27;s knickers&quot; should &quot;pull back your tenner just as she reaches to take it when paying for a round. It really turns us on&quot;. In a similar vein, one reader suggested &quot;Old people – are you worried that people in a hurry might be able to get past you on the pavement? Why not try stumbling aimlessly from side to side? That should stop them&quot;.

====McDonald&#x27;s====
McDonald&#x27;s was accused of plagiarising a number of &quot;Viz Top Tips&quot; in an advertising campaign they ran in 1996. Some of the similarities are almost word-for-word:

* Save a fortune on laundry bills. Give your dirty shirts to Oxfam. They will wash and iron them, and then you can buy them back for 50p. – &quot;Viz Top Tip&quot; (published May 1989)
* Save a fortune on laundry bills. Give your dirty shirts to a second-hand shop. They will wash and iron them, and then you can buy them back for 50p. – McDonald&#x27;s advert

The case was later settled out of court for an undisclosed sum (donated to Comic Relief); but many &quot;Viz&quot; readers believed that the comic had given permission for their use, leading to &quot;Top Tips&quot; submissions such as:

* Geordie magazine editors. Continue paying your mortgage and buying expensive train sets ... by simply licensing the Top Tips concept to a multinational burger corporation.

The magazine published them.

At around the same time, the following &quot;Top Tip&quot; was also published:

* McDonald&#x27;s advertising executives. Why not steal someone else&#x27;s idea and then claim you overheard it in a bar, you fucking cunts.

In addition, a burger bar &quot;McWonald&#x27;s&quot; was used as a story setting and displayed a large W in the style of an inverted Golden Arches M. This establishment had spotty-faced teenage staff vomiting and smoking; a child customer informs his mother that he does not want to finish his burger as it &quot;tastes of pigeon and has cigarette butts in it&quot;.

In a further attack on the company, the map of &quot;Cuntinental Europe&quot;, given away free with Issue 118 and showing a large cartoon of stereotypes of the British and their neighbours over the relevant geographical areas, displayed the McDonald&#x27;s logo on potentially insensitive locations, such as the Parthenon and the vicinity of the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

===Spoof advertisements and competitions===
&quot;Viz&quot; has had many different spoof adverts for various items, such as ornaments, dolls, sheds, china plates and novelty chess sets. These poke fun at the genuine adverts for such items in magazines found in the colour supplements of Sunday newspapers. Those found in &quot;Viz&quot; are absurd, such as a breakfast plate depicting Princess Diana&#x27;s face in the middle of a fried egg, &quot;No. 22 Shit Street&quot; (which was a diorama of a dilapidated council house complete with rabid dog, youthful vandals and a &quot;gently rusting&quot; washing machine in the front yard), and &quot;Little Ted West&quot;, a teddy bear dressed to look like serial killer Fred West. &quot;Viz&quot; has manufactured some of these items and sold them, including a china plate depicting &quot;The Life of Christ...In Cats&quot;, featuring pictures of a cat in various stages of Jesus&#x27;s life, and the &quot;Elvis Presley Dambusters Clock Plate of Tutankhamun&quot;, a clock featuring Elvis in the style of Tutankhamun&#x27;s death mask in addition to Avro Lancaster bomber planes. Many of these adverts had a form with a tick box at the end, with outrageous binding statements in small print that invariably led the purchaser to usury, such as &quot;I enclose £49.50 in an infinite series of escalating payments&quot;.

Another staple of &quot;Viz&quot; advertisement parody are the adverts for public and government services which one would normally not expect to find advertised; for example, one ad consisted of the words &quot;Raped? Burgled? Run over? Why not call the police&quot;, placed next to a picture of a grinning policeman. Another ad exhorted male readers to join the British Army, because &quot;all the birds are gagging for squaddies&quot; (with the fine print on the reply coupon indicating to the respondent that spending &quot;33 years hiding behind some garden wall in Belfast should just about see [him] right&quot; when it comes to the ladies). The &#x27;PC Brigade&#x27; were also featured as if they were the fire brigade, stating they attended emergencies such as &#x27;collapsed turbans&#x27; or freeing gypsies from railings while leaving British people stuck tight. They also carried the slogan &#x27;Fueling middle England&#x27;s persecution complex since 1958&#x27;.

A long-running joke has been small adverts for bizarre sheds (&quot;TV Sheds&quot;, &quot;Shed Bikes&quot;, &quot;Shed Snakes&quot;, etc.). Testament to the quality of these is invariably provided by a Mrs. B. of Essex.

Adverts for loan companies have been parodied frequently since approximately 2000, usually with an absurd twist, such as ones aimed at vagrants, offering loans of between 5 and 10 pence for a cup of tea. Roger Mellie has frequently starred in such spoof advertisements, both in separate sections in &quot;Viz&quot; and also his own strip. Mellie is portrayed as someone who is willing to endorse any product whatsoever for money or gifts.

Scatological humour also featured heavily in the ads; one ad featured &quot;Clag-Gone&quot;, which consisted of a stationary bicycle with no seat. Instead, the rider simply placed his naked bottom onto the &quot;Clag-Gone&quot;&#x27;s wire brush wheel, which then cleaned away &quot;winnits&quot;, &quot;tag-nuts&quot; and &quot;dangleberries&quot;. Another ad featured a tourist package where eggs were served in great quantities; a happy tourist was featured saying &quot;I&#x27;m &quot;egg-bound&quot; for Jamaica!&quot;.

Genuine competitions have been run by &quot;Viz&quot;, with proper prizes. One of the earliest was a competition to win &#x27;a ton of money&#x27; a pointed satire of tabloid newspapers promising huge cash prizes to boost circulation, the prize was in fact a tonne of one- and two-pence pieces, equivalent to a few hundred pounds sterling. Recently, they were giving away a plasma screen television provided by the producers of &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;. Viz poked fun at the movie, describing it as &quot;shite&quot; in the competition description, and described the runners-up prizes of DVDs of the film as &quot;frankly worthless&quot;, which led to the producers refusing to hand over the prize, for insulting their film.

Another spin-off was &quot;Roger&#x27;s Profanisaurus&quot;, a thesaurus of (often freshly coined) rude words, phrases and sexual slang submitted by readers. It has been published as several books, the 2002 print of which has a foreword by Terry Jones. This also often features genuine regional slang. Roger&#x27;s Profanisaurus has become a popular downloadable app for Apple&#x27;s iPhone.

In November 1987, a free mini-issue of &quot;Viz&quot; was given away with issue 23 of computer magazine &quot;Your Sinclair&quot;. This was done in response to &quot;Your Sinclair&quot;&#x27;s competitor, &quot;CRASH&quot;, giving away a mini-copy of &quot;Oink!&quot; comic with their issue 42.

===Photo-strips===
Occasionally photo-strips are included. These parody the format of supernatural and true-love British comics which were popular with young girl readers in the 1970s and 1980s, such as &quot;Chiller&quot; and &quot;Jackie&quot;, as well as the &quot;real life dilemma&quot; photo strips often found in the advice columns of tabloid newspapers.

For example, a young woman is convinced that the spirit of her dead husband has possessed the family dog, and after some soul-searching, begins a sexual relationship with the dog. A running joke in these stories is that they often feature a car accident in which one of the characters is run down. In every case, the same man is driving the car, and always responds with the same line: &quot;Sorry mate, I didn&#x27;t see him/her!&quot; The locations for the photo-stories are recognisable as the suburbs of Newcastle upon Tyne where the Viz team are based.

On occasion, this is explicitly recognised: the one-off strip &quot;Whitley Baywatch&quot;, a spoof of the popular American TV show &quot;Baywatch&quot;, is based in the North East coastal resort of Whitley Bay. But other stories purporting to be set in London, or without a set location, are often also identifiably near to the Viz editorial offices in Jesmond. In &quot;He just loved to dance&quot; (no. 103), for example, Komal&#x27;s Tandoori restaurant in West Jesmond is visible. In &quot;Four minutes to fall in love&quot; (no. 107), the Gateshead Millennium Bridge provides a backdrop to the dénouement. An occasionally recurring actor in these strips is Arthur 2 Stroke, now acknowledged as the &quot;Guru of Viz&quot; by Chris Donald founder editor. Arthur, former lead singer of the band The Chart Commandos, still continues to perform with &quot;Big Black Bomb&quot; and is still considered to be an innovating force on the Newcastle music scene.

One such photo-strip was called &quot;I Believe in Father Christmas&quot;, where an adult man believes in Father Christmas. His wife, named Virginia, attempts to convince him otherwise. He visits a department store Father Christmas, just like a child, although he asks for a CD from either Dire Straits or Phil Collins. On Christmas night, the man goes downstairs to the living room, as he hears a noise and figures Father Christmas must have come. However, he is surprised to see that an armed robber has broken into his house, who promptly shoots him and flees. His wife, in shock, tends to her husband as he is badly hurt, and he tells her he was wrong to believe in Father Christmas like some small child. However, the wife tearfully says that Father Christmas did indeed come, and left presents for them. The strip ends with the husband saying to his wife &quot;Yes Virginia, there is a Father Christmas&quot;.

In his book &quot;Rude Kids: The Inside Story of Viz&quot;, the comic&#x27;s creator Chris Donald claimed that the first legal action ever taken against Viz was initiated by a man who objected to the use of a picture of his house (taken from an estate agent&#x27;s catalogue) in one of these photo-strips, and that the British tabloid newspaper &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; tried to provoke media outrage over another photo-strip which, if taken out of context, could be misconstrued as making light of the problem of illegal drugs being offered to children.

Actor Sean Bean made a one-off appearance in 1996 titled &quot;I&#x27;ve Bean to Paradise&quot; where the main character, unhappy with his long-term relationship, attempts to seek out for more physically attractive women by undergoing a makeover as a lookalike of the actor (played by himself) and passing himself off as the actor with references to his past screen roles.

==&quot;Viz&quot; in other media==
Some of the characters have had their own television cartoon series on Channel 4. They are:

* The Fat Slags (voiced by Kathy Burke and Jo Unwin - later replaced by Jenny Eclair)
* Roger Mellie (voiced by Peter Cook)
* Sid the Sexist (voiced by Sammy Johnson)
* Billy the Fish (voiced by Harry Enfield)

VHS releases of each series went on sale during the same months of broadcast. Chris Donald revealed in his book &quot;Rude Kids – The Unfeasibly True Story of Viz&quot; that the magazine&#x27;s publishers had pencilled in Student Grant as the next animated release but this never came to fruition. He went on to say that he was pleased that the project did not go ahead as he felt the quality of the previous releases was disappointing.

In December 2011, &quot;Viz&quot; produced three animated shorts for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Blaps&quot; with Baby Cow, voiced by Steve Coogan, Sarah Millican, Simon Greenall and Gavin Webster.

A one-off TV programme &quot;Viz – The Documentary&quot; was shown on Britain&#x27;s Channel 4 in 1990, spoofing serious investigative TV shows like &quot;Panorama&quot; or &quot;Dispatches&quot; while telling the story of &quot;Viz&quot;.

A computer game using &quot;Viz&quot; characters was produced in 1991 by Virgin Interactive. The game sold well; however, the critical response was mostly negative.

The Fat Slags appeared in TV ads for Lucozade, a drink which they hate with a passion. These ads included a mixture of cartoon characters (the slags) and live actors (the men who drink Lucozade).

A film based on The Fat Slags was produced in 2004, but was disowned by the magazine&#x27;s editors who threatened to stop running the strip in response.

A novelty single was released in 1987 for Viz, featuring its Buster Gonad character, by the band XTC, with John Otway, as &quot;Johnny Japes and His Jesticles&quot;. The A-side was &quot;Bags of Fun With Buster&quot; b/w &quot;Scrotal Scratch Mix&quot;.

During the Gulf War of 1991, SEPECAT Jaguar GR1A bombers of the Royal Air Force featured such Viz characters as Johnny Fartpants, the Fat Slags and Buster Gonad as nose art.

==Controversy==
The comic was reprimanded by the United Nations after featuring a strip called &quot;The Thieving Gypsy Bastards&quot;. UK tabloid newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; ran a story suggesting that the principal Roma man who initiated the complaints against Viz (&quot;Don&#x27;t call us thieving gypsies, says thieving gypsy&quot;) had been found guilty of handling stolen property at Preston Crown Court. He had, but in truth the man in question had been supportive of the comic in his correspondence with them and had not made any complaint against the strip. In the same issue &quot;Viz&quot; ran a short strip called &quot;The Nice, Honest Gypsies&quot;, featuring a kindly Gypsy woman selling pegs door-to-door and helpfully returning forgotten change.

The strip &quot;Wanker Watson&quot;, a parody of the children&#x27;s comic character Winker Watson, led to litigation by D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd, the owners of the Winker character. This was after they had issued several warnings previously about infringement of copyright in earlier parody strips, which Viz had ignored. In retaliation, &quot;Viz&quot; featured a new character called &#x27;D.C. Thompson The Humourless Scottish Git&#x27;. However, coinciding with DC Thomson’s legal action, and unaware of it, Dandy editor Maurice Heggie published a good humoured strip in response, &quot;The Jocks and The Geordies&quot;, a revival of an old strip from &quot;The Dandy&quot;, in which the Geordies (clearly representing &quot;Viz&quot;) competed with the Jocks (clearly representing Thomson) in a competition to design funny cartoon characters. The Geordies&#x27; miserable efforts bore sharp similarity to actual &quot;Viz&quot; characters, such as &#x27;The Boy with Big Pants&#x27; which was a reference to Felix and his Amazing Underpants. This served to deflate the situation. (Chris Donald&#x27;s book &quot;Rude Kids: The Inside Story of Viz&quot;, notes the good-humoured nature of the latter stages of this episode).

Sports clothing manufacturer Kappa insisted that the comic drop the name of one of its characters, &quot;Kappa Slappa&quot;, as it had no permission to use the brand name. Kappa also believed that the character in question insulted its customer base. &quot;Slappa&quot; was an obnoxious, uneducated, highly unattractive and sexually promiscuous 14-year-old living on a Tyneside council estate, always wearing a Kappa shellsuit. The characterisation was said to be more descriptive than insulting. However, after several runs of the strip, &quot;Viz&quot; agreed to change her name to &quot;Tasha Slappa&quot;.

In his book &quot;Rude Kids: The Inside Story of Viz&quot;, Chris Donald mentions that he was interviewed by police after giving the go-ahead to publish a Top Tip which could have been interpreted as an incitement to carry out a bomb plot. Donald claims that he then accidentally included the offending statement in that year&#x27;s &quot;Viz&quot; annual &quot;The Sausage Sandwich&quot;. It was covered with a sticker reading &quot;PUBLISHERS. Ensure that your editors have read the proofs of your books before printing a quarter of a million of them. J. Brown, London&quot;.

==Bibliography==

<text>The viola da gamba (), or viol, or informally gamba, is a bowed and fretted string instrument that is played (i.e. &quot;on the leg&quot;). It is distinct from the later violin, or ; and it is any one of the earlier viol family of bowed, fretted, and stringed instruments with hollow wooden bodies and pegboxes where the tension on the strings can be increased or decreased to adjust the pitch of each of the strings. Although treble, tenor and bass were most commonly used, viols came in different sizes, including (high treble, developed in 18th century), treble, alto, small tenor, tenor, bass and contrabass (called ). 

These members of the viol family are distinguished from later bowed string instruments, such as the violin family, by both appearance and orientation when played—as typically the neck is oriented upwards and the rounded bottom downwards to settle on the lap or between the knees.

The viola da gamba uses the alto clef. Seven and occasionally eight frets made of &quot;stretched gut&quot; are tied on the fingerboard around the instrument&#x27;s neck. Frets tied in this manner—instead of permanently fixed as on a guitar—allow for fine-tuning of the instrument. (Frets enable the performer to stop the strings more cleanly, improve consistency of intonation and lend the stopped notes a tone that better matches the open strings.) 

Viols first appeared in Spain and Italy in the mid-to-late 15th century, and were most popular in the Renaissance and Baroque (1600–1750) periods. Early ancestors include the Arabic &quot;rebab&quot; and the medieval European vielle, but later, more directly possible ancestors include the Venetian and the 15th- and 16th-century Spanish , a six-course plucked instrument tuned like a lute (and also like a present-day viol) that (at the time) looked like, but was quite distinct from, the four-course guitar (an earlier chordophone). It must be also mentioned that the Arabic &quot;rebab&quot; originally is a Persian instrument called &quot;rubāb&quot; in the original Persian.

Although bass viols superficially resemble cellos, viols are different in several respects from instruments of the violin family: the viol family has flat rather than curved backs, sloped rather than rounded shoulders, c holes rather than f holes, and five to seven rather than four strings. Additional differences include &quot;tuning strategy&quot;—in fourths, with a third in the middle, rather than in fifths (similar to a lute)—the presence of frets, and underhand rather than overhand bow grip.

A modern player of the viol is commonly known as a &quot;gambist&quot;, &quot;violist&quot; , or &quot;violist&quot; . Notably, &quot;violist&quot; is a homograph of the word commonly used since the mid-20th century to refer to a player of the viola, which can cause confusion in written/printed texts when not clear from the context.

==History==

Vihuelists began playing their flat-topped, originally plucked, instruments &quot;with a bow&quot; in the second half of the 15th century. Within two or three decades, this led to the evolution of an entirely new and dedicated bowed string instrument that retained many of the features of the vihuela: e.g., a flat back, sharp waist-cuts, frets, thin ribs initially, and identical tuning—hence its original name, vihuela de arco; is Spanish for &quot;bow&quot;. An influence on the playing posture has been credited to the example of Moorish &quot;rabab&quot; players.

However, Stefano Pio (2012) argues that a re-examination of documents in light of new data indicates an origin different than the &quot;vihuela de arco&quot; from Aragon. According to Pio, the viol had its origins in Venice, and evolved independently there. He asserts it was implausible that the vihuela de arco underwent such a rapid evolution by Italian rather than Venetian instrument makers. Nonetheless, a ten-year span brought the birth and diffusion in Italy of a new family of instruments (viola da gamba, or viols). These comprised instruments of different sizes, some as large as the famous &quot;violoni&quot;—as &#x27;big as a man&#x27;—mentioned by Prospero Bernardino in 1493.

Pio also notes that the fifth string of the viola da gamba is uniquely called a &quot;bordone&quot; (drone)—both in the manuscript of the early 15th-century music theorist Antonius de Leno, and in the treatises of the Venetian Silvestro Ganassi dal Fontego and . However, it is not a drone and is played the same as the other strings. This inconsistency is justified, Pio argues, only by assuming the invention (in the latter 15th century) of a larger instrument derived from the medieval &quot;violetta&quot;, which gradually added more strings to allow greater extension to the low register. The fifth string was incorporated into the neck. This was surpassed by a sixth string (&quot;basso&quot;) which fixed the lower sound produced by the instrument. Pio&#x27;s view was: the origin of the viola da gamba is tied to the evolution of the smaller violetta, or vielle, which was originally fitted with a fifth-string &quot;drone&quot;; and the name &#x27;stuck&#x27; even after it ceased to perform this function.

Ian Woodfield, in his &quot;The Early History of the Viol&quot;, points to evidence that the viol does start with the vihuela, but that Italian luthiers immediately began to apply their own highly developed instrument-making traditions to the early version of the instrument after it was introduced into Italy.

==Construction==
Viols most commonly have six strings, although many 16th-century instruments had only four or five strings, and during the 17th century in France, some bass viols featured a seventh lower string. Viols were (and are) strung with gut strings of lower tension than on the members of the violin family. Gut strings produce a sonority far different from steel, generally described as softer and sweeter. Around 1660, gut or silk core strings overspun with copper wire first became available; these were then used for the lowest-pitched bass strings on viols, and many other string instruments as well. In 1664, a style of string incorporating a copper wire spun within the gut fibers, called a &#x27;gimped&#x27; string, was introduced, mimicking the style of embroidery of the same name. 

Viols are fretted like early guitars or lutes, using movable wrapped-around and tied-on gut frets. A low seventh string was supposedly added in France to the bass viol by Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe (–1690), whose students included the French gamba virtuoso and composer Marin Marais. Also, the painting &quot;Saint Cecilia with an Angel&quot; (1618) by Domenichino (1581–1641) shows what may be a seven-string viol.

Unlike members of the violin family, most of which are tuned in fifths, viols are usually tuned in fourths with a major third in the middle, mirroring the tuning employed on the vihuela de mano and lute during the 16th century and similar to that of the modern six-string guitar.

Viols were first constructed much like the &quot;vihuela de mano&quot;, with all surfaces, top, back, and sides made from flat slabs or pieces of joined wood, bent or curved as required. However, some viols, both early and later, had carved tops, similar to those more commonly associated with instruments of the violin family. The ribs or sides of early viols were usually quite shallow, reflecting more the construction of their plucked vihuela counterparts. Rib depth increased during the 16th century, finally coming to resemble the greater depth of the classic 17th-century pattern.

The flat backs of most viols have a sharply angled break or &quot;canted&quot; bend in their surface close to where the neck meets the body. This serves to taper the back (and overall body depth) at its upper end to meet the back of the neck joint flush with its heel. Traditional construction uses animal glue, and internal joints are often reinforced with strips of either linen or vellum soaked in hot animal glue—a practice also employed in early plucked vihuela construction. The peg boxes of viols (which hold the tuning pegs) were typically decorated either with elaborately carved heads of animals or people or with the now-familiar spiral &quot;scroll&quot; finial.

The earliest vihuelas and viols, both plucked and bowed, all had sharp cuts to their waists, similar to the profile of a modern violin. This was a key and new feature—first appearing in the mid-15th century—and from then on, it was employed on many different types of string instruments. This feature was also key in seeing and understanding the connection between the plucked and bowed versions of early vihuelas. If one were to go searching for very early viols with smooth-curved figure-eight bodies, like those found on the only slightly later plucked vihuelas and the modern guitar, they would be out of luck. By the mid-16th century, however, &quot;guitar-shaped&quot; viols were fairly common, and a few of them survive.

The earliest viols had flat, glued-down bridges just like their plucked counterpart vihuelas. Soon after, however, viols adopted the wider and high-arched bridge that facilitated the bowing of single strings. The earliest of viols would also have had the ends of their fretboards flat on the deck, level with or resting upon the top or soundboard. Once the end of their fretboards was elevated above the top of the instrument&#x27;s face, the entire top could vibrate freely. Early viols did not have sound posts, either (again reflecting their plucked vihuela siblings). This reduced damping again meant that their tops could vibrate more freely, contributing to the characteristic &quot;humming&quot; sound of viols; yet the absence of a sound post also resulted in a quieter and softer voice overall.

It is commonly believed that C-holes (a type and shape of pierced sound port visible on the top face or belly of string instruments) are a definitive feature of viols, a feature used to distinguish viols from instruments in the violin family, which typically had F-shaped holes. This generality, however, renders an incomplete picture. The earliest viols had either large, open, round, sound holes (or even round pierced rosettes like those found on lutes and vihuelas), or they had some kind of C-holes. Viols sometimes had as many as four small C-holes—one placed in each corner of the bouts—but more commonly, they had two. The two C-holes might be placed in the upper bouts, centrally, or in the lower bouts. In the formative years, C-holes were most often placed facing each other or turned inwards.

In addition to round or C-holes, however, and as early as the first quarter of the 16th century, some viols adopted S-shaped holes, again facing inward. By the mid-16th century, S-holes morphed into the classic F-shaped holes, which were then used by viols and members of the violin family alike. By the mid-to late 16th century, the viol&#x27;s C-holes facing direction were reversed, becoming outward-facing. That configuration then became a standard feature of what we today call the “classic” 17th-century pattern. Yet another style of sound holes found on some viols was a pair of flame-shaped Arabesques placed left and right. The lute- and vihuela-like round or oval ports or rosettes became a standard feature of German and Austrian viols and were retained to the very end. That feature was unique to viols and reminded one always of the viol&#x27;s more ancient plucked vihuela roots, the &quot;cuteness&quot; of viols.

Historians, makers, and players generally distinguish between &quot;renaissance&quot; and &quot;baroque&quot; viols. The latter are more heavily constructed and are fitted with a bass bar and sound post, like modern stringed instruments.

===Viol bows===
The bow is held underhand with the palm facing upward, similar to a German double bass bow grip, but away from the frog towards the balance point. The stick&#x27;s curvature is generally convex as were violin bows of the period, rather than concave like a modern violin bow. The &quot;frog&quot; (which holds the bow hair and adjusts its tension) is also different from that of modern bows: whereas a violin bow frog has a &quot;slide&quot; (often made of mother of pearl), which pinches the hair and holds it flat and stationary across the frog, viol bows have an open frog that allows more movement of the hair. This facilitates a traditional playing technique where the performer uses one or two fingers of the bow hand to press the hair away from the bow stick. This dynamically increases bow hair tension to control articulation and inflection.

==Different versions==

Viols come in seven sizes: &quot;pardessus de viole&quot; (which is relatively rare, exclusively French and did not exist before the 18th century), treble (&quot;dessus&quot; in French), alto, tenor (in French &quot;taille&quot;), bass, great bass, and contrabass (the final two are often called violone, meaning &quot;large viol&quot;), the smaller one tuned an octave below the tenor (violone in G, sometimes called &quot;great bass&quot; or in French &quot;grande basse&quot;) and the larger one tuned an octave below the bass (violone in D, or the contrabass viol). This latter instrument is not to be confused with the double bass.

Their tuning (see next section) alternates G and D instruments: pardessus in G, treble in D, tenor in G, bass in D (the seven-string bass was a French invention, with an added low A), small violone in G, large violone in D and the alto (between the treble and the tenor. 

The treble has a size similar to a viola but with a deeper body; the typical bass is about the size of a cello. The pardessus and the treble were held vertically in the lap. The English made smaller basses known as division viols, and the still-smaller Lyra viol. The viola bastarda was a similar type of viol used in Italy for a virtuosic style of viol repertoire and performance. German consort basses were larger than the French instruments designed for continuo.

Those instruments were not all equally common. The typical Elizabethan consort of viols was composed of six instruments: two basses, two tenors and two trebles, or one bass, three tenors and two trebles (see Chest of viols). Thus the bass, tenor and treble were the central members of the family as far as music written specifically for viols is concerned. Besides consort playing the bass could also be used as a solo instrument (there were also smaller basses designed especially for a virtuosic solo role, see above &quot;division viol&quot;, &quot;lyra viol&quot;, &quot;viola bastarda&quot;). And the bass viol could also serve as a continuo bass. The pardessus was a French 18th-century instrument that was introduced to allow ladies to play mostly violin or flute music but eventually acquired its own repertoire. The alto was a relatively rare smaller version of the tenor. The violones were rarely part of the consort of viols but functioned as the bass or contrabass of all kinds of instrumental combinations.

==Tuning==
The standard tuning of most viols is in fourths, with a major third in the middle (like the standard Renaissance lute tuning), or in fourths, with a major third in between the 2nd and 3rd strings. The following table shows the tunings that have been adopted at least somewhat widely during the 20th and 21st-century revival of the viols. (Lyra viol tunings are not included.)

Alternative tunings (called &quot;&quot;) were often employed, particularly in the solo lyra viol style of playing, which also made use of many techniques such as chords and &quot;pizzicato&quot;, not generally used in consort playing. An unusual style of pizzicato was known as a thump. Lyra viol music was also commonly written in tablature. There is a vast repertoire of this music, some by well-known composers and much by anonymous ones.

Much viol music predates the adoption of equal temperament tuning by musicians. The movable nature of the tied-on frets permits the viol player to make adjustments to the tempering of the instrument, and some players and consorts adopt meantone temperaments, which are more suited to Renaissance music. Several fretting schemes involve frets that are spaced unevenly to produce better-sounding chords in a limited number of &quot;keys&quot;. In some of these schemes, the two strands of the gut that form the fret are separated so that the player can finger a slightly sharper or flatter version of a note (for example G versus A) to suit different circumstances.

==Treatises==
Descriptions and illustrations of viols are found in numerous early 16th-century musical treatises, including those authored by:

*Sebastian Virdung: &quot;Musica getutsch&quot;, 1511
*Hans Judenkünig: &quot;Ain schone kunstliche Vunderwaisung&quot;, 1523
*Martin Agricola: &quot;Musica instrumentalis deutsch&quot;, 1528
*Hans Gerle: &quot;Musica Teusch&quot; (or &quot;Teutsch&quot;), 1532

Both Agricola&#x27;s and Gerle&#x27;s works were published in various editions.

There were then several important treatises concerning or devoted to the viol. The first was by Silvestro Ganassi dal Fontego: &quot;Regola Rubertina &amp; Lettione Seconda&quot; (1542/3). Diego Ortiz published &quot;Trattado de Glosas&quot; (Rome, 1553), an important book of music for the viol with both examples of ornamentation and pieces called &quot;Recercadas&quot;. In England, Christopher Simpson wrote the most important treatise, with the second edition being published in 1667 in parallel text (English and Latin). This has divisions at the back that are very worthwhile repertoire. A little later, in England, Thomas Mace wrote &quot;Musick&#x27;s Monument&quot;, which deals more with the lute but has an important section on the viol. After this, the French treatises by Machy (1685), Rousseau (1687), Danoville (1687), and Etienne Loulie (1700) show further developments in playing technique.

==Popularity==





Viols were second in popularity only to the lute (although this is disputed), and like lutes, were very often played by amateurs. Affluent homes might have a so-called &quot;chest of viols&quot;, which would contain one or more instruments of each size. Gamba ensembles, called &quot;consorts&quot;, were common in the 16th and 17th centuries, when they performed vocal music (consort songs or verse anthems) as well as that written specifically for instruments. Only the treble, tenor, and bass sizes were regular members of the viol consort, which consisted of three, four, five, or six instruments. Music for consorts was very popular in England in Elizabethan times, with composers such as William Byrd and John Dowland, and, during the reign of King Charles I, John Jenkins, William Lawes and Tobias Hume. The last music for viol consorts before their modern revival was probably written in the early 1680s by Henry Purcell.

Perhaps even more common than the pure consort of viols was the mixed or broken consort (also called Morley consort). Broken consorts combined a mixture of different instruments—a small band, essentially—usually comprising a gathering of social amateurs and typically including such instruments as a bass viol, a lute or orpharion (a wire-strung lute, metal-fretted, flat-backed, and festoon-shaped), a cittern, a treble viol (or violin, as time progressed), sometimes an early keyboard instrument (virginal, spinet, or harpsichord), and whatever other instruments or players (or singers) might be available at the moment. The single most common and ubiquitous pairing of all was always and everywhere the lute and bass viol: for centuries, the inseparable duo.

The bass viola da gamba remained in use into the 18th century as a solo instrument (and to complement the harpsichord in basso continuo). It was a favorite instrument of Louis XIV and acquired associations of both courtliness and &quot;Frenchness&quot; (in contrast to the Italianate violin). Composers such as Marc-Antoine Charpentier, François Couperin, Marin Marais, Sainte Colombe, Johann Sebastian Bach, Johannes Schenck, DuBuisson, Antoine Forqueray, Charles Dollé and Carl Friedrich Abel wrote virtuoso music for it. Georg Philipp Telemann published his &quot;Twelve Fantasias for Viola da Gamba solo&quot; in 1735, when the instrument was already becoming out of fashion. However, viols fell out of use as concert halls grew larger and the louder and more penetrating tone of the violin family became more popular. In the 20th century, the viola da gamba and its repertoire were revived by early music enthusiasts, an early proponent being Arnold Dolmetsch.

The treble viol in d and the even smaller pardessus de viole in g (often with only five strings) were also popular instruments in the 18th century, especially in France. Composers like Jean-Baptiste Barrière, Georg Phillipp Telemann and Marin Marais wrote solo- and ensemble pieces for treble or pardessus. It was also common to play music for violins or flutes or unspecified top parts on small viols.

Historic viols survive in relatively great number, though very few remain in original condition. They can often be found in collections of historic musical instruments at museums and universities. Here are some of the extant historic viols at The Metropolitan Museum of Art:

* Division Viol by Barak Norman, London, 1692
* Bass Viol, labeled Richard Meares, London, ca. 1680
* Bass Viol by John Rose, ca. 1600, London
* English viol, unsigned, 17th century in spectacularly original condition
* Division Viol, School of Tielke, Hamburg, ca. 1720
* Bass Viol by Matthias Humel, 18th century, Nuremberg
* Bass Viol, Germany, 18th century
* Bass Viol by Nicolas Bertrand, Paris, 1720

==Modern era==
In the 20th and early 21st century, the viol is attracting ever more interest, particularly among amateur players and early music enthusiasts and societies, and in conservatories and music schools. This may be due to the increased availability of reasonably priced instruments from companies using more automated production techniques, coupled with the greater accessibility of early music editions and historic treatises. The viol is also regarded as a suitable instrument for adult learners; Percy Scholes wrote that the viol repertoire &quot;belongs to an age that demanded musicianship more often than virtuosity.&quot; There are now many societies for people with an interest in the viol. The first was the Viola da Gamba Society, which was established in the United Kingdom in 1948 (by Nathalie and Cecile Dolmetsch). The Viola da Gamba Society of America followed in 1962, and with over 1000 members in North America and around the world. Since then, similar societies have been organized in several other nations. In the 1970s, the now-defunct Guitar and Lute Workshop in Honolulu generated resurgent interest in the viol and traditional luthierie methods within the western United States.

A notable youth viol group is the Gateshead Viol Ensemble. It consists of young players between the ages of 7 and 18 and is quite well known in the northeast of England. It gives young people the opportunity to learn the viol and gives concerts in the North East and abroad. Ensembles like these show that the viol is making a comeback. A living museum of historical musical instruments was created at the University of Vienna as a center for the revival of the instrument. More than 100 instruments, including approximately 50 historical violas da gamba in playable condition, are the property of this new concept of a museum: the Orpheon Foundation Museum of Historical Instruments. All the instruments of this museum are played by the Orpheon Baroque Orchestra, the Orpheon consort, or by musicians who receive an instrument for a permanent loan. The instruments can be seen during temporary exhibitions. They are studied and copied by violin makers, contributing to the extension of the general knowledge we have on the viola da gamba, its forms, and the different techniques used for its manufacture.

The 1991 feature film &quot;Tous les matins du monde&quot; (All the Mornings of the World) by Alain Corneau, based on the lives of Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe and Marin Marais, prominently featured these composers&#x27; music for the viola da gamba and brought viol music to new audiences. The film&#x27;s bestselling soundtrack features performances by Jordi Savall, one of the best-known modern viola da gamba players. Among the foremost modern players of the viol are Alison Crum, Vittorio Ghielmi, Susanne Heinrich, Wieland Kuijken, Paolo Pandolfo, Andrea de Carlo, Hille Perl and Jonathan Dunford. Many fine modern viol consorts (ensembles) are also recording and performing, among them the groups Fretwork, the Rose Consort of Viols, Les Voix Humaines, and Phantasm. The Baltimore Consort specializes in Renaissance song (mostly English) with broken consort (including viols).

=== New compositions ===
A number of contemporary composers have written for viol, and a number of soloists and ensembles have commissioned new music for viol. Fretwork has been most active in this regard, commissioning George Benjamin, Michael Nyman, Elvis Costello, Sir John Tavener, Orlando Gough, John Woolrich, Tan Dun, Alexander Goehr, Fabrice Fitch, Andrew Keeling, Thea Musgrave, Sally Beamish, Peter Sculthorpe, Gavin Bryars, Barrington Pheloung, Simon Bainbridge, Duncan Druce, Poul Ruders, Ivan Moody, and Barry Guy; many of these compositions may be heard on their 1997 CD &quot;Sit Fast&quot;. The Yukimi Kambe Viol Consort has commissioned and recorded many works by David Loeb, and the New York Consort of Viols has commissioned Bülent Arel, David Loeb, Daniel Pinkham, Tison Street, Frank Russo, Seymour Barab, William Presser, and Will Ayton, many of these compositions appearing on their 1993 CD &quot;Illicita Cosa&quot;.

The Viola da Gamba Society of America has also been a potent force fostering new compositions for the viol. Among the music publications of the Society is its New Music for Viols (NMV) a series devoted to newly written pieces. The Society sponsors the International Leo M. Traynor Composition Competition for new music for viols. The competition was first held in 1989 and has taken place every four to five years since. The competition is specifically for consort music for three to six viol that, like the repertoire of the Renaissance, is accessible to accomplished amateurs. The winning pieces are played in concert and also published by the Society. The Society&#x27;s goal is to stimulate development of a contemporary literature for this remarkable early instrument and thus continue its tradition in modern society.

The Palazzo Strozzi in Florence commissioned composer Bruce Adolphe to create a work based on Bronzino poems, and the piece, &quot;Of Art and Onions: Homage to Bronzino&quot;, features a prominent viola da gamba part. Jay Elfenbein has also written works for the Yukimi Kambe Viol Consort, Les Voix Humaines, and Elliot Z. Levine, among others. Other composers for viols include Moondog, Kevin Volans, Roy Whelden, Toyohiko Satoh, Roman Turovsky, Giorgio Pacchioni, Michael Starke, Emily Doolittle, and Jan Goorissen. Composer Henry Vega has written pieces for the Viol: &quot;Ssolo,&quot; developed at the Institute for Sonology and performed by Karin Preslmayr, as well as for Netherlands-based ensemble The Roentgen Connection in 2011 with &quot;Slow slower&quot; for recorder, viola da gamba, harpsichord and computer. The Aston Magna Music Festival has recently commissioned works including viol from composers Nico Muhly and Alex Burtzos. The Italian contemporary composer Carlotta Ferrari has written two pieces for viol: &quot;Le ombre segrete&quot; in 2015, and &quot;Profondissimi affetti&quot; in 2016, this latter being based on RPS modal harmony system.

===Electric instruments===
Since the early 1980s, numerous instrument makers, including Eric Jensen, Francois Danger, Jan Goorissen, and Jonathan Wilson, have experimented with the design and construction of electric viols. Like other acoustic instruments to which pickups or microphones have been added, electric viols are plugged into an instrument amplifier or a PA system, which makes them sound louder. As well, given that amplifiers and PA systems are electronic components, this gives the performer the ability to change the tone and sound of the instrument by adding effects units such as reverb or changing the tone with a graphic equalizer. An equalizer can be used to shape the sound of an electric viol to suit a performance space, or to create unusual new sounds. Electric viols range from Danger&#x27;s minimally electrified acoustic/electric Altra line to Eric Jensen&#x27;s solid-body brace-mounted design. They have met with varying degrees of ergonomic and musical success. In the early 21st century, the Ruby Gamba, a seven-string electric viola da gamba, was developed by Ruby Instruments of Arnhem, the Netherlands. It has 21 tied nylon (adjustable) frets in keeping with the adjustable (tied gut) frets on traditional viols and has an effective playing range of more than six octaves. Electric viols have been adopted by such contemporary gambists as Paolo Pandolfo, Tina Chancey, and Tony Overwater.

==Similar names and common confusions==
The viola da gamba is occasionally confused with the viola, the alto member of the modern violin family and a standard member of both the symphony orchestra and string quartet. In the 15th century, the Italian word &quot; was a generic term used to refer to any bowed instrument, or fiddle. The word &quot; existed in Italy before the vihuela, or first viol, was brought from Spain. In Italy, &quot;&quot; was first applied to &quot;a braccio&quot; precursor to the modern violin, as described by Tinctoris (&quot;De inventione et usu musice&quot;, –3), and then was later used to describe the first Italian viols as well. Depending on the context, the unmodified &quot;viola da braccio&quot; most regularly denoted either an instrument from the violin family, or specifically the viola (whose specific name was &quot;alto de viola da braccio&quot;). When Monteverdi called simply for &quot;viole da braccio&quot; in &quot;Orfeo&quot;, the composer was requesting violas as well as treble and bass instruments. The full name of the viola, namely &quot;alto de viola da braccio&quot;, was finally shortened to &quot;viola&quot; in some languages (e.g. English, Italian, Spanish) once viols became less common, while other languages picked some other part of the phrase to designate the instrument, e.g. &quot; in French and &quot; in German (the latter derived from the Italian &quot;&quot;).

Some other instruments have &quot;viola&quot; in their name, but are not a member of the &quot;viola da gamba&quot; family. These include the viola d&#x27;amore and the viola pomposa. Though the baryton does not have &quot;viola&quot; in its name, it is sometimes included in the viol family. Whether it is considered a member of this family is a matter of semantics. It is organologically closely related to the viola da gamba proper, but if we think of the family as the group of differently sized instruments that play together in consorts, the baryton would not be among this group. The names &quot;viola&quot; (Italy) and &quot;vihuela&quot; (Spain) were essentially synonymous and interchangeable. According to viol historian Ian Woodfield, there is little evidence that the &quot;vihuela de arco&quot; was introduced to Italy before the 1490s. The term &quot;viola&quot; was never used exclusively for viols in the 15th or 16th centuries. In 16th century Italy, both &quot;&quot;violas&quot;,&quot;—the early viols and violins—developed somewhat simultaneously. While violins, such as those of Amati, achieved their classic form before the first half of the century, the viol&#x27;s form standardized later in the century at the hands of instrument makers in England.

Viola da gamba, &quot;viola cum arculo&quot;, and &quot;vihuela de arco&quot; are some (true) alternative names for viols. Both &quot;vihuela&quot; and &quot;viola&quot; were originally used in a fairly generic way, having included even early violins (&quot;viola da braccio&quot;) under their umbrella. It is common enough (and justifiable) today for modern players of the viola da gamba to call their instruments &quot;violas&quot; and likewise to call themselves &quot;violists&quot;. That the &quot;alto violin&quot; eventually became known simply as the &quot;viola&quot; is not without historical context, yet the ambiguity of the name tends to cause some confusion. The violin, or &quot;violino&quot;, was originally the soprano &quot;viola da braccio&quot;, or &quot;violino da braccio&quot;. Due to the popularity of the soprano violin, the entire consort eventually took on the name &quot;violin family&quot;. Some other names for viols include &quot;viole&quot; or &quot;violle&quot; (French). In Elizabethan English, the word &quot;gambo&quot; (for gamba) appears in many permutations; e.g., &quot;viola de gambo&quot;, &quot;gambo violl&quot;, &quot;viol de gambo&quot;, or &quot;viole de gambo&quot;, used by such notables as Tobias Hume, John Dowland, and William Shakespeare in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. Viol da Gamba and Gamba also appear as string family stops on the pipe organ. These stops are sounds created by organ pipes made to imitate the sound of the viol da gamba.

<doc id="32645" wikidata="Q183548" url="?curid=32645" title="Voyeurism">
<text>Voyeurism is the sexual interest in or practice of watching other people engaged in intimate behaviors, such as undressing, sexual activity, or other actions of a private nature.

The term comes from the French &quot;voir&quot; which means &quot;to see&quot;. A male voyeur is commonly labelled as &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; or a &quot;Jags&quot;, a term which originates from the Lady Godiva legend. However, that term is usually applied to a male who observes somebody secretly and, generally, not in a public space.

The American Psychiatric Association has classified certain voyeuristic fantasies, urges and behaviour patterns as a paraphilia in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&quot; (DSM-IV) if the person has acted on these urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. It is described as a disorder of sexual preference in the ICD-10. The DSM-IV defines voyeurism as the act of observing &quot;individuals, usually strangers, engaging in sexual activity, exhibitionism, or disrobing&quot;. The diagnosis as a disorder would not be given to people who experience typical sexual arousal or amusement, simply by seeing nudity or sexual activity.
==Historical perspectives==
There is relatively little academic research regarding voyeurism. When a review was published in 1976 there were only 15 available resources. Voyeurs were well-paying hole-lookers in especially Parisian brothels, a commercial innovation described as far back as 1857 but not gaining much notoriety until the 1880s, and not attracting formal medical-forensic recognition until the early 1890s. Society has accepted the use of the term voyeur as a description of anyone who views the intimate lives of others, even outside of a sexual context. This term is specifically used regarding reality television and other media which allow people to view the personal lives of others. This is a reversal from the historical perspective, moving from a term which describes a specific population in detail, to one which describes the general population vaguely.

One of the few historical theories on the causes of voyeurism comes from psychoanalytic theory. Psychoanalytic theory proposes that voyeurism results from a failure to accept castration anxiety and as a result of failure to identify with the father.

==Prevalence==
Voyeurism has high prevalence rates in most studied populations. Voyeurism was once believed to only be present in a small portion of the population. This perception changed when Alfred Kinsey discovered that 30% of men prefer coitus with the lights on. This behaviour is not considered voyeurism by modern diagnostic standards, but there was little differentiation between normal and pathological behaviour at the time. Subsequent research showed that 65% of men had engaged in peeping, which suggests that this behaviour is widely spread throughout the population. Congruent with this, research found voyeurism to be the most common sexual law-breaking behaviour in both clinical and general populations.
An earlier study, based on 60 college men from a rural area, indicates that 54% had voyeuristic fantasies, and that 42% had tried voyeurism, concluding that young men are more easily aroused by the idea.

In a national study of Sweden it was found that 7.7% of the population (16% of men and 4% of women) had engaged in voyeurism at some point. It is also believed that voyeurism occurs up to 150 times more frequently than police reports indicate. This same study also indicates that there are high levels of co-occurrence between voyeurism and exhibitionism, finding that 63% of voyeurs also report exhibitionist behaviour.

==Characteristics==
People engage in voyeuristic behaviours for diverse reasons, but statistics can indicate which groups are likelier to engage in the act.

Early research indicated that voyeurs were more mentally healthy than other groups with paraphilias. Compared to the other groups studied, it was found that voyeurs were unlikely to be alcoholics or drug users. More recent research shows that, compared to the general population, voyeurs were moderately more likely to have psychological problems, use alcohol and drugs, and have higher sexual interest generally. This study also shows that voyeurs have a greater number of sexual partners per year, and are more likely to have had a same-sex partner than most of the populations. Both older and newer research found that voyeurs typically have a later age of first sexual intercourse. However, other research found no difference in sexual history between voyeurs and non-voyeurs. Voyeurs who are not also exhibitionists tend to be from a higher socioeconomic status than those who do show exhibitionist behaviour.

===Gender differences===

Research shows that, like almost all paraphilias, voyeurism is more common in men than in women. However, research has found that men and women both report roughly the same likelihood that they would hypothetically engage in voyeurism. There appears to be a greater gender difference when actually presented with the opportunity to perform voyeurism. There is very little research done on voyeurism in women, so very little is known on the subject which limits the degree to which it can generalize to normal female populations.

A 2021 study found that 36.4% of men and 63.8% of women were strongly repulsed by the idea of voyeurism. Men were more likely to be mildly or moderately aroused than women, but there was little gender difference among those who reported strong arousal. Men reported slightly higher willingness to commit voyeurism but, when risk is introduced, willingness diminishes in both sexes proportionally to the risk involved. Individual differences in sociosexuality and sexual compulsivity were found to contribute to the sex differences in voyeurism.

===Contemporary perspectives===
Lovemap theory suggests that voyeurism exists because looking at naked others shifts from an ancillary sexual behaviour to a primary sexual act. This results in a displacement of sexual desire making the act of watching someone the primary means of sexual satisfaction.

Voyeurism has also been linked with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). When treated by the same approach as OCD, voyeuristic behaviours significantly decrease.

==Treatment==
===Professional treatment===
Historically voyeurism has been treated in a variety of ways. Psychoanalytic, group psychotherapy and shock aversion approaches have all been attempted with limited success. There is some evidence which shows that pornography can be used as a form of treatment for voyeurism. This is based on the idea that countries with pornography censorship have high amounts of voyeurism. Additionally shifting voyeurs from voyeuristic behaviour, to looking at graphic pornography, to looking at the nudes in &quot;Playboy&quot; has been successfully used as a treatment. These studies show that pornography can be used as a means of satisfying voyeuristic desires without breaking the law.

Voyeurism has also been successfully treated with a mix of anti-psychotics and antidepressants. However the patient in this case study had a multitude of other mental health problems. Intense pharmaceutical treatment may not be required for most voyeurs.

There has also been success in treating voyeurism through using treatment methods for obsessive compulsive disorder. There have been multiple instances of successful treatment of voyeurism through putting patients on fluoxetine and treating their voyeuristic behaviour as a compulsion.

==Techniques==

The increased miniaturisation of hidden cameras and recording devices since the 1950s has enabled those so minded to surreptitiously photograph or record others without their knowledge and consent. The vast majority of mobile phones, for example, are readily available to be used for their camera and recording ability.

==Criminology==
Non-consensual voyeurism is considered to be a form of sexual abuse.

When the interest in a particular subject is obsessive, the behaviour may be described as stalking.

The United States FBI assert that some individuals who engage in &quot;nuisance&quot; offences (such as voyeurism) may also have a propensity for violence based on behaviours of serious sex offenders. An FBI researcher has suggested that voyeurs are likely to demonstrate some characteristics that are common, but not universal, among serious sexual offenders who invest considerable time and effort in the capturing of a victim (or image of a victim); careful, methodical planning devoted to the selection and preparation of equipment; and often meticulous attention to detail.

Little to no research has been done into the demographics of voyeurs.

==Legal status==
Voyeurism is not a crime in common law. In common law countries, it is only a crime if made so by legislation.
===Canada===
In Canada, for example, voyeurism was not a crime when the case &quot;Frey v. Fedoruk et al.&quot; arose in 1947. In that case, in 1950, the Supreme Court of Canada held that courts could not criminalise voyeurism by classifying it as a breach of the peace and that Parliament would have to specifically outlaw it.

A test of the lack of laws related to voyeurism came in February 2005. It became public knowledge that a website called peepingthong.com had become a depository of photos showing young women, many of them University of Victoria students, sitting down at various campus locations, such as libraries. While the act of photographing them in isolation may not have caused a commotion, each of the women revealed their thong underwear to create a whale tail.

Reaction from female members of the university community was not positive. The chairwoman of the student union, Joanna Groves, believed that perpetrator(s) committed an action that were “a violation of someone’s privacy.” The outreach coordinator for the University of Victoria Student Society Women&#x27;s Centre, Caitlin Warbeck, went as far as to call it “sexual assault.” The photographed individuals also appeared to be completely unaware that they were being watched.

While the photos did cause a commotion, law enforcement could not do anything because the photos were snapped in public locations. University administrators were also powerless because the site was not affiliated with the institution. Campus security, however, did put up flyers in certain parts of campus where the perpetrator(s) were believed to be operating.

On November 1, 2005, Parliament outlawed voyeurism when section 162 was added to the Canadian &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, declaring voyeurism to be a sexual offence when it violates a reasonable expectation of privacy. In the case of R v Jarvis, the Supreme Court of Canada held that for the purposes of that law, the expectation of privacy is not all-or-nothing; rather there are degrees of privacy, and although secondary-school pupils in the school building cannot reasonably expect as much privacy as in the bedroom, nonetheless they can expect enough privacy so that photographing them without their consent for the purpose of sexual gratification is forbidden.

===United Kingdom===
In some countries voyeurism is considered to be a sex crime. In the United Kingdom, for example, non-consensual voyeurism became a criminal offence on May 1, 2004. In the English case of &quot;R v Turner&quot; (2006), the manager of a sports centre filmed four women taking showers. There was no indication that the footage had been shown to anyone else or distributed in any way. The defendant pleaded guilty. The Court of Appeal confirmed a sentence of nine months&#x27; imprisonment to reflect the seriousness of the abuse of trust and the traumatic effect on the victims.

In another English case in 2009, &quot;R v Wilkins&quot; (2010), a man who filmed his intercourse with five of his lovers for his own private viewing was sentenced to eight months in prison and ordered to sign onto the Sex Offender Register for ten years. In 2013, 40-year-old Mark Lancaster was found guilty of voyeurism and jailed for 16 months. He had tricked an 18-year-old student into traveling to a rented flat in Milton Keynes. There, he had filmed her with four secret cameras dressing up as a schoolgirl and posing for photographs before he had sex with her.

In a more recent English case in 2020, the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction of Tony Richards. Richards had sought &quot;to have two voyeurism charges under section 67 of the Sexual Offences Act dismissed on the grounds that he had committed no crime&quot;. Richards had &quot;secretly videoed himself having sex with two women who had consented to sex in return for money but had not agreed to being captured on camera&quot;. In an unusual step, the court allowed Emily Hunt, a person not involved in the case, to intervene on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Hunt had an ongoing judicial review against the CPS. The CPS had argued that Hunt&#x27;s alleged attacker had not violated the law when he &quot;took a video lasting over one minute of her naked and unconscious&quot; in a hotel room -- the basis being that there should be no expectation of privacy in the bedroom. However, in terms of what is considered a private act for the purposes of voyeurism, the CPS was arguing the opposite in the Richards appeal. The Court of Appeal clarified that consenting to sex in a private place does not amount to consent to be filmed without that person&#x27;s knowledge. Anyone who films or photographs another person naked, without their permission, is breaking the law under sections 67 and 68 of the Sexual Offences Act.

===United States===
In the United States, criminal voyeurism statutes arise from laws and legal principles that protect private activities from unlawful intrusion. They are specific to unlawful, unconsented surreptitious surveillance, recordings, and broadcasts. They involve places and times when a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a reasonable supposition they are not being photographed, filmed or observed by any form of recording or broadcast device. These statutes often also criminalize the broadcast, dissemination, publication, or selling of recordings.

Video voyeurism is an offense in at least twelve states. The case that led to the criminalisation of video voyeurism has been made into a television movie called &quot;Video Voyeur&quot;.

===Saudi Arabia===
Saudi Arabia banned the sale of camera phones nationwide in April 2004, but reversed the ban in December 2004. Some countries, such as South Korea and Japan, require all camera phones sold in their country to make a clearly audible sound whenever a picture is being taken. In South Korea, specialty teams have been set up to regularly check places like bathrooms and change-rooms for hidden cameras known as &quot;molka&quot;.

===India===
In 2013, the Indian Parliament made amendments to the Indian Penal Code, introducing voyeurism as a criminal offence. A man committing the offence of voyeurism would be liable for imprisonment of not less than one year and up to three years and a fine for the first offence. For any subsequent conviction, he would be liable for imprisonment for not less than three years and up to seven years as well as a fine.

===Singapore===
Voyeurism is generally deemed illegal in Singapore. Those convicted of voyeurism face a maximum punishment of one year in jail and a fine -- based on insulting a woman&#x27;s modesty. Recent cases in 2016 include the sentencing of church facility manager Kenneth Yeo Jia Chuan who filmed women in toilets. Yeo Jia Chuan planted pinhole cameras in a handicapped toilet at the Church of Singapore at Bukit Timah, and in the unisex toilet of the church&#x27;s office at Bukit Timah Shopping Centre.

Secret photography by law enforcement authorities is called surveillance and is not considered to be voyeurism, though it may be unlawful or regulated in some countries.

Headquartered in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, Germany, and since the late 2000s is a publicly traded family business owned by Porsche SE, which in turn is half-owned but fully controlled by the Austrian-German Porsche and Piëch family. The company also offers related services, including financing, leasing, and fleet management. In 2016, it was the world&#x27;s largest automaker by sales, and keeping this title in 2017, 2018, and 2019, selling 10.9 million vehicles and was the largest automaker by revenue in 2022. It has maintained the largest market share in Europe for over two decades. It ranked seventh in the 2020 &quot;Fortune&quot; Global 500 list of the world&#x27;s largest companies. In 2023, Volkswagen Group was the largest company in the European Union and the largest car manufacturer in the world by revenue.

The Volkswagen Group sells passenger cars under the Audi, Bentley, Cupra, Jetta, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, Škoda and Volkswagen brands, motorcycles under the Ducati name, light commercial vehicles under the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand, and heavy commercial vehicles via the marques of the listed subsidiary Traton (International Motors, MAN, Scania and Volkswagen Truck &amp; Bus). Software and techstack under CARIAD. It is divided into two primary divisions: the Automotive Division and the Financial Services Division. As of 2008, it had about 342 subsidiary companies.

Volkswagen was founded in Berlin in 1937 and incorporated in Wolfsburg to manufacture the car that would become known as the Beetle. The company&#x27;s production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1965, it acquired Auto Union, which subsequently produced the first postwar Audi models. Volkswagen launched a new generation of front-wheel drive vehicles in the 1970s, including the Passat, Polo and Golf; the latter became its bestseller. Volkswagen acquired a controlling stake in SEAT in 1986, making it the first non-German marque of the company, and acquired control of Škoda in 1994, of Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti in 1998, Scania in 2008 and of Ducati, MAN, and Porsche in 2012. The company&#x27;s operations in China have grown rapidly in the past decade, with the country becoming its largest market.

The government of Lower Saxony holds 12.7% of the company&#x27;s shares, granting it, by law, 20% of the voting rights.

==History==

===1937 to 1945===

Volkswagen (meaning &#x27;People&#x27;s car&#x27; in German) was founded in Berlin as the &quot;Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH&quot; (&#x27;Limited Liability Company for the preparation of the German People&#x27;s Car&#x27;, abbreviated to &quot;Gezuvor&quot;) by the National Socialist &quot;Deutsche Arbeitsfront&quot; (German Labour Front) and incorporated in the &quot;Stadt des KdF-Wagens bei Fallersleben&quot;, (&quot;&quot;&quot;City of the Strength Through Joy car at Fallersleben) on 28 May 1937. The purpose of the company was to manufacture the Volkswagen car, originally referred to as the Porsche Type 60, then the Volkswagen Type 1, and commonly called the Volkswagen Beetle. This vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Porsche&#x27;s consulting firm, and the company was backed by the support of Adolf Hitler. On 16 September 1938, Gezuvor was renamed &quot;Volkswagenwerk GmbH&quot; (&#x27;Volkswagen Factory GmbH&#x27;).

Shortly after the factory at Fallersleben was completed World War II started, and the plant primarily manufactured the military Kübelwagen (Porsche Type 82) and the related amphibious Schwimmwagen (Type 166), both of which were derived from the Volkswagen. Only a small number of Type 60 Volkswagens were made during this time. The Fallersleben plant also manufactured the V-1 flying bomb, making the plant a major bombing target for the Allied forces.

Slave labour was utilised in the Volkswagen plant, e.g. from Arbeitsdorf concentration camp. The company would admit in 1998 that it used 15,000 slaves during the war effort. German historians estimated that 80% of Volkswagen&#x27;s wartime workforce was slave labour. Many of the slaves were reported to have been supplied from the concentration camps upon request from plant managers. A lawsuit was filed in 1998 by survivors for restitution for the forced labour. Volkswagen would set up a voluntary restitution fund.

===1945 to 1970===

After the war in Europe, in June 1945, Major Ivan Hirst of the British Army Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) took control of the bomb-shattered factory for use in repairing British Army vehicles, pending the expected disposal of the plant tooling and equipment as war reparations. However, no British car manufacturer was interested. A British report on the car said that &quot;the vehicle does not meet the fundamental technical requirement of a motor-car … it is quite unattractive to the average buyer … To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise.&quot; In 1948, the Ford Motor Company of USA was offered Volkswagen, but Ernest Breech, a Ford executive vice president, said he did not think either the plant or the car was &quot;worth a damn.&quot; Breech later said that he would have considered merging Ford of Germany and Volkswagen, but after the war, ownership of the company was in such dispute that nobody could possibly hope to be able to take it over. As part of the Industrial plans for Germany, large parts of German industry, including Volkswagen, were to be dismantled. Total German car production was set at a maximum of 10% of the 1936 car production numbers. The company survived by producing cars for the British Army, and in 1948 the British Government handed the company back over to the German state, and it was managed by former Opel chief Heinrich Nordhoff.

Production of the Type 60 Volkswagen (re-designated Type 1) started slowly after the war due to the need to rebuild the plant and because of the lack of raw materials, but production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s. The company began introducing new models based on the Type 1, all with the same basic air-cooled, rear-engine, rear-drive platform. These included the Volkswagen Type 2 in 1950, the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia in 1955, the Volkswagen Type 3 in 1961, the Volkswagen Type 4 in 1968, and the Volkswagen Type 181 in 1969.

In 1960, upon the flotation of part of the German federal government&#x27;s stake in the company on the German stock market, its name became &quot;Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft&quot; (usually abbreviated to &quot;Volkswagenwerk AG&quot;).

On 1 January 1965, Volkswagenwerk acquired Auto Union GmbH from its parent company Daimler-Benz. The new subsidiary went on to produce the first post-war Audi models, the Audi F103 series, shortly afterwards.

Another German manufacturer, NSU Motorenwerke AG, was merged into Auto Union on 26 August 1969, creating a new company, Audi NSU Auto Union AG (later renamed AUDI AG in 1985).

===1970 to 1999===

From the late 1970s to 1992, the acronym V.A.G. was used by Volkswagen AG as a brand for group-wide activities, such as distribution and leasing. Contrary to popular belief, &quot;V.A.G.&quot; had no official meaning, and was never the formal name of the Volkswagen Group.

On 30 September 1982, Volkswagenwerk made its first step expanding outside Germany by signing a co-operation agreement with the Spanish car manufacturer SEAT, S.A.

To reflect the company&#x27;s increasing global diversification from its headquarters and main plant (the &quot;Volkswagenwerk&quot; in Wolfsburg), on 4 July 1985, the company name was changed again—to &quot;Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft&quot; (Volkswagen AG).

On 18 June 1986, Volkswagen AG acquired a 51% controlling stake in SEAT, making it the first non-German subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group. On 23 December the same year, it became the Spanish company&#x27;s major shareholder by increasing its share up to 75%.

In 1990—after purchasing its entire equity—Volkswagen AG took over the full ownership of SEAT, making the company a wholly owned subsidiary, and on 28 March 1991, another step to the expansion of the group&#x27;s activities was made through the signing of a joint-venture partnership agreement with Škoda automobilová a.s. of Czechoslovakia, accompanied with the acquisition of a 30% stake in the Czech car manufacturer on 16 April 1991.

On 19 December 1994, the group began the acquisition of Škoda Auto by raising its share to 60.3%. Later, on 11 December 1995, it became the Czech company&#x27;s largest and controlling shareholder by increasing its share up to 70%.

Three prestige automotive marques were added to the Volkswagen portfolio in 1998: Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti.

===2000 to present===

On 30 May 2000, after having gradually raised its equity share, Volkswagen AG took over the full ownership of Škoda Auto, making the company a wholly owned subsidiary.

From 2002 up to 2007, the Volkswagen Group&#x27;s automotive division was restructured so that two major Brand Groups with different profile would be formed, the &quot;Audi Brand Group&quot; focused on more sporty values – consisted of Audi, SEAT and Lamborghini – and the &quot;Volkswagen Brand Group&quot; on the field of classic values – consisted of Volkswagen, Skoda, Bentley and Bugatti – with each Brand Group&#x27;s product vehicles and performance being respectively under the higher responsibility of Audi and Volkswagen brands.

Volkswagen Group revealed on 24 October 2009 that it had made an offer to acquire long-time partner and German niche automotive manufacturer Wilhelm Karmann GmbH out of bankruptcy protection. In November 2009, the supervisory board of Volkswagen AG approved the acquisition of assets of Karmann, and planned to restart vehicle production at their Osnabrück plant in 2012.

In December 2009, Volkswagen AG bought a 49.9% stake in Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG (more commonly known as Porsche AG) in a first step towards an &#x27;integrated automotive group&#x27; with Porsche. The merger of Volkswagen AG and Porsche SE was scheduled to take place during the course of 2011. On 8 September 2011, it was announced that the planned merger &quot;cannot be implemented within the time frame provided for in the Comprehensive Agreement&quot;. As reasons, unquantifiable legal risks, including a criminal probe into the holding&#x27;s former management team were given. Both parties &quot;remain committed to the goal of creating an integrated automotive group with Porsche and are convinced that this will take place&quot;.

On 4 July 2012 Volkswagen group announced they would wrap up the remaining half of Porsche shares for 4.46 billion euros (US$5.58 billion) on 1 August 2012 to avoid taxes of as much as 1.5 billion euros, which would have to be paid if the wrap up happened after 31 July 2014. Volkswagen AG purchased the remaining stake in Porsche AG equaling 100% of the shares in Porsche Zwischenholding GmbH, effectively becoming its parent company as of 1 August 2012.

Volkswagen AG completed the purchase of 19.9% of Suzuki Motor Corporation&#x27;s issued shares on 15 January 2010. Suzuki invested part of the amount received from Volkswagen into 1.49% percent of Volkswagen. In 2011, Suzuki filed a lawsuit at an arbitration court in London requesting that Volkswagen return the 19.9% stake.

On 25 May 2010, it was announced that Volkswagen Group, through its subsidiary Lamborghini Holding S.p.A., had acquired a 90.1% stake in the Italian automotive design house Italdesign Giugiaro.
In less than three months, the transaction had been completed making the Italian firm a member of the Volkswagen Group. Since 2013 the Volkswagen Group has held a 89.7% stake in Traton.

In 2015 research showed a security flaw in the keyless ignition of Volkswagen and other carmakers&#x27; vehicles. Volkswagen spent two years trying to keep the research from the public domain.

On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of three German automakers—BMW, Daimler AG, and Volkswagen Group, for €2.8 billion. This was seen as an indication that the automakers were interested in automated cars.

Volkswagen held a 19.9% non-controlling shareholding in Suzuki between 2009 and 2015. An international arbitration court ordered Volkswagen to sell the stake back to Suzuki. On 17 September 2015, Suzuki paid $3.8bn to complete the stock buy-back just hours prior to a major scandal about emissions violations engulfing Volkswagen. Suzuki had wished to buy Fiat diesel engines.

In 2021, Volkswagen sold their 55% stake in Bugatti to Rimac Group while transferring the remaining 45% to Porsche AG, forming a joint venture company called Bugatti Rimac.

In early 2024, Volkswagen Group began looking for partners among international technology corporations to create AI labs, new digital prototypes of products and functions using artificial intelligence.

In October 2024, Volkswagen plans to close at least three plants in Germany and cut jobs, facing challenges from delayed EV investments and a drop in Chinese sales.

====Emissions scandal, 2015====

On 18 September 2015, the US EPA announced that Volkswagen had installed a &quot;defeat device&quot; software code in the diesel models sold in the US from 2009 to 2015. The code was intended to detect when an emissions test was being conducted, and altered emissions controls for better compliance. Off the test stand, the controls were relaxed, and emissions jumped 35 to 40 times regulatory levels according to investigators at West Virginia University and the California Air Resources Board. About 482,000 vehicles are under the recall order, a potential $18 billion ($37,500 per violation) in fines are pending, and news accounts speculate a criminal indictment for the deception is certain. The VW Group CEO, Martin Winterkorn, said he was &quot;deeply sorry&quot; and ordered an external investigation. The software code was only revealed when the EPA refused to certify VW&#x27;s 2016 models for sale in the US unless the corporation provided full disclosure. On Sunday, 20 September 2015, VW Group announced it was halting the sale of its four-cylinder diesel models in the US. The US EPA press release on its Notice of Violation, and the California Air Resources Board letter dated 18 September 2015 contain significant chronological detail of the agencies interaction with VW on the issue.

On 22 September 2015, VW AG admitted that 11 million cars worldwide had been fitted with software intended to deceive emissions testing. The company issued a profit warning, saying it had set aside $7 billion to fix the fraud. On 23 September 2015, Martin Winterkorn announced his resignation from the CEO position after a crisis meeting of the company board. On 25 September 2015 Matthias Müller was named CEO. Müller was the head of the Porsche marque within the VW corporate umbrella.

On 21 April 2017, a U.S. federal judge ordered Volkswagen &quot;to pay a $2.8 billion criminal fine for rigging diesel-powered vehicles to cheat on government emissions tests&quot;. The &quot;unprecedented&quot; plea deal formalized a punishment that Volkswagen AG agreed to earlier in 2017. In addition, the plea deal includes a $1.5 billion settlement for various environmental, customs and financial violations.

Overall, Volkswagen will pay more than $30 billion in penalties and lawsuit settlements related to the scandal.

====Huge debt====
In its own financial report for 2023 Volkswagen Group estimated its long, medium and short term debt at 155,6 Billion Euros. It is unclear how Volkswagen group plans to pay off that massive debt considering its falling global vehicle deliveries, planned closure of at least 3 factories in Germany after it previously closed 2 factories in Russia as well as 64% drop in profit for the three months to the end of September 2024. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz criticized Volkswagen&#x27;s plan to close factories in Germany. He proposed a European subsidy program for electric vehicles. 

Latest setback for Volkswagen came on 21 November 2024, when Swedish battery producer Northvolt filed for bankruptcy, Volkswagen previously invested 1.4 billion euros in their failed business. On 27 November 2024, Volkswagen announced sale of its Xinijang factory in China partly because &quot;demand for combustion engine vehicles is going down&quot;.

Former member of Croatian parliament Ivan Pernar warned that due to overall financial situation Volkswagen might go bankrupt just as &quot;too big to fail&quot; heavily indebted Evergrande Group. He also questioned how will EU tariffs on Chinese cars save Volkswagen when 50% of its sales are in China itself and not in EU, as well as its manangment decision to exit Russian market.

====Electrification strategy 2025====

In 2016, Volkswagen Group announced a corporate &quot;Strategy 2025&quot; that focuses on electrification of its portfolio. The VW Group developed the Volkswagen Group MEB platform chassis that will be utilized in a range of various cars and light utility vehicles across several VW Group marques due to its flexibility and floor-mounted battery.

As of May 2018, the VW Group has committed $48 billion in car battery supplies and plans to outfit 16 factories to build electric cars by the end of 2022. According to VW Group CEO Dr. Herbert Diess, the company will offer 25 electric models and 20 plug-in hybrids by 2020.

==== Production in Xinjiang ====
Volkswagen Group came under pressure for cooperating with the Chinese government in the region of Xinjiang. In that same region, western-funded NGOs accused the Chinese government of having committed human rights abuses against the Uyghur minority group, which included mass surveillance, incarceration, and forced labor. After these accusations emerged, Volkswagen responded, &quot;We do not assume any of our employees are forced laborers.&quot; &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; claimed that Volkswagen was operating a plant in Xinjiang at a loss in order to curry favor with the Chinese government to set up more lucrative plants in other parts of China, which Volkswagen denied, saying that the decision to set up the plant in 2012 was purely based on economics. Volkswagen is still operating a plant in the region as of 2020.

==== New Auto ====
In 2021, Volkswagen Group released their &quot;New Auto&quot; strategy. The strategy was based on transitioning to electric cars, and building a shared platform, battery systems, software and mobility solutions to use across all their brands. This involves creating the Scalable Systems Platform, as well as developing software under a new subsidiary CARIAD. Volkswagen Group aims by 2024 to transition to selling mostly electric cars. It aims to have six battery factories in Europe by 2030. In 2023, Volkswagen Group announced plans to cut costs by €10 billion ($11.1 billion). In February 2024, Volkswagen Group and Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer XPeng signed a technology cooperation and joint development agreement on platform and software.

==Operations==

Rooted in Europe, the Volkswagen Group operates in 153 countries.

==Corporate affairs==

=== Business trends ===
In February 2025, Volkswagen&#x27;s market capitalization was valued at US$50.5 billion. The key trends for the Volkswagen Group are (as at the financial year ending March 3):
===Ownership===

Under the Volkswagen Law, no shareholder in Volkswagen AG could exercise more than 20 percent of the firm&#x27;s voting rights, regardless of their level of stock holding. This law was supposed to protect Volkswagen Group from takeovers. In October 2005, Porsche acquired an 18.53 percent stake in the business, and in July 2006, Porsche increased that ownership to more than 25 percent. Analysts disagreed as to whether the investment was a good fit for Porsche&#x27;s strategy.

On 26 March 2007, after the European Union moved against the Volkswagen law, Porsche took its holding to 30.9 percent, triggering a takeover bid under German law. Porsche formally announced in a press statement that it did not intend to take over Volkswagen Group, setting its offer price at the lowest possible legal value, but intended the move to avoid a competitor taking a large stake, or to stop hedge funds dismantling Volkswagen Group, which is Porsche&#x27;s most important partner.
On 16 September 2008, Porsche announced that the company had increased its stake in Volkswagen AG to 35 percent. By October 2008, Porsche held 42.6 percent of Volkswagen AG&#x27;s ordinary shares, and held stock options on another 31.5 percent. thus, effectively holding over 74 percent; 42.6 percent actual shares, and the rest as convertible options. Volkswagen AG briefly became the world&#x27;s most valuable company, as the stock price rose to over €1,000 per share as short sellers tried to cover their positions. The substantial investment in Volkswagen left Porsche with huge financial burden with its debts accumulating up to 13 billion euros by 2009. Porsche would get emergency infusion of about a billion dollars from Volkswagen. In July 2012, Volkswagen completed takeover of Porsche ending the four-year saga and formed an integrated automotive group with Porsche. Porsche AG would become the 10th brand of Volkswagen. The holding company Porsche SE was left with 31 percent of the subscribed capital of Volkswagen AG, and 50.7 percent of the voting rights in the company.

, share ownership of Volkswagen AG is distributed as follows:

<text>A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious or malignant disease. The safety and effectiveness of vaccines has been widely studied and verified. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body&#x27;s immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and recognize further and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.

Vaccines can be prophylactic (to prevent or alleviate the effects of a future infection by a natural or &quot;wild&quot; pathogen), or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred, such as cancer). Some vaccines offer full sterilizing immunity, in which infection is prevented.

The administration of vaccines is called vaccination. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that licensed vaccines are currently available for twenty-five different preventable infections.

The first recorded use of inoculation to prevent smallpox occurred in the 16th century in China, with the earliest hints of the practice in China coming during the 10th century. It was also the first disease for which a vaccine was produced. The folk practice of inoculation against smallpox was brought from Turkey to Britain in 1721 by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.
The terms &quot;vaccine&quot; and &quot;vaccination&quot; are derived from &quot;Variolae vaccinae&quot; (smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Edward Jenner (who both developed the concept of vaccines and created the first vaccine) to denote cowpox. He used the phrase in 1798 for the long title of his &quot;Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae Known as the Cow Pox&quot;, in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox. In 1881, to honor Jenner, Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms should be extended to cover the new protective inoculations then being developed. The science of vaccine development and production is termed &quot;&quot;.
==Effects==

There is overwhelming scientific consensus that vaccines are a very safe and effective way to fight and eradicate infectious diseases. The immune system recognizes vaccine agents as foreign, destroys them, and &quot;remembers&quot; them. When the virulent version of an agent is encountered, the body recognizes the protein coat on the agent, and thus is prepared to respond, by first neutralizing the target agent before it can enter cells, and secondly by recognizing and destroying infected cells before that agent can multiply to vast numbers.

Limitations to their effectiveness, nevertheless, exist. Sometimes, protection fails for vaccine-related reasons such as failures in vaccine attenuation, vaccination regimens or administration.

Failure may also occur for host-related reasons if the host&#x27;s immune system does not respond adequately or at all. Host-related lack of response occurs in an estimated 2-10% of individuals, due to factors including genetics, immune status, age, health and nutritional status. One type of primary immunodeficiency disorder resulting in genetic failure is X-linked agammaglobulinemia, in which the absence of an enzyme essential for B cell development prevents the host&#x27;s immune system from generating antibodies to a pathogen.

Host–pathogen interactions and responses to infection are dynamic processes involving multiple pathways in the immune system. A host does not develop antibodies instantaneously: while the body&#x27;s innate immunity may be activated in as little as twelve hours, adaptive immunity can take 1–2 weeks to fully develop. During that time, the host can still become infected.

Once antibodies are produced, they may promote immunity in any of several ways, depending on the class of antibodies involved. Their success in clearing or inactivating a pathogen will depend on the amount of antibodies produced and on the extent to which those antibodies are effective at countering the strain of the pathogen involved, since different strains may be differently susceptible to a given immune reaction. 
In some cases vaccines may result in partial immune protection (in which immunity is less than 100% effective but still reduces risk of infection) or in temporary immune protection (in which immunity wanes over time) rather than full or permanent immunity. They can still raise the reinfection threshold for the population as a whole and make a substantial impact. They can also mitigate the severity of infection, resulting in a lower mortality rate, lower morbidity, faster recovery from illness, and a wide range of other effects.

Those who are older often display less of a response than those who are younger, a pattern known as Immunosenescence.
Adjuvants commonly are used to boost immune response, particularly for older people whose immune response to a simple vaccine may have weakened.

The efficacy or performance of the vaccine is dependent on several factors:
* the disease itself (for some diseases vaccination performs better than for others)
* the strain of vaccine (some vaccines are specific to, or at least most effective against, particular strains of the disease)
* whether the vaccination schedule has been properly observed.
* idiosyncratic response to vaccination; some individuals are &quot;non-responders&quot; to certain vaccines, meaning that they do not generate antibodies even after being vaccinated correctly.
* assorted factors such as ethnicity, age, or genetic predisposition.

If a vaccinated individual does develop the disease vaccinated against (breakthrough infection), the disease is likely to be less virulent than in unvaccinated cases.

Important considerations in an effective vaccination program:
# careful modeling to anticipate the effect that an immunization campaign will have on the epidemiology of the disease in the medium to long term
# ongoing surveillance for the relevant disease following introduction of a new vaccine
# maintenance of high immunization rates, even when a disease has become rare

In 1958, there were 763,094 cases of measles in the United States; 552 deaths resulted. After the introduction of new vaccines, the number of cases dropped to fewer than 150 per year (median of 56). In early 2008, there were 64 suspected cases of measles. Fifty-four of those infections were associated with importation from another country, although only thirteen percent were actually acquired outside the United States; 63 of the 64 individuals either had never been vaccinated against measles or were uncertain whether they had been vaccinated.

Vaccines led to the eradication of smallpox, one of the most contagious and deadly diseases in humans. Other diseases such as rubella, polio, measles, mumps, chickenpox, and typhoid are nowhere near as common as they were a hundred years ago thanks to widespread vaccination programs. As long as the vast majority of people are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. This effect is called herd immunity. Polio, which is transmitted only among humans, is targeted by an extensive eradication campaign that has seen endemic polio restricted to only parts of three countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan). However, the difficulty of reaching all children, cultural misunderstandings, and disinformation have caused the anticipated eradication date to be missed several times.

Vaccines also help prevent the development of antibiotic resistance. For example, by greatly reducing the incidence of pneumonia caused by &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, vaccine programs have greatly reduced the prevalence of infections resistant to penicillin or other first-line antibiotics.

The measles vaccine is estimated to prevent a million deaths every year.

===Adverse effects===

Vaccinations given to children, adolescents, or adults are generally safe. Adverse effects, if any, are generally mild. The rate of side effects depends on the vaccine in question. Some common side effects include fever, pain around the injection site, and muscle aches. Additionally, some individuals may be allergic to ingredients in the vaccine. MMR vaccine is rarely associated with febrile seizures.

Host-(&quot;vaccinee&quot;)-related determinants that render a person susceptible to infection, such as genetics, health status (underlying disease, nutrition, pregnancy, sensitivities or allergies), immune competence, age, and economic impact or cultural environment can be primary or secondary factors affecting the severity of infection and response to a vaccine. Elderly (above age 60), allergen-hypersensitive, and obese people have susceptibility to compromised immunogenicity, which prevents or inhibits vaccine effectiveness, possibly requiring separate vaccine technologies for these specific populations or repetitive booster vaccinations to limit virus transmission.

Severe side effects are extremely rare. Varicella vaccine is rarely associated with complications in immunodeficient individuals, and rotavirus vaccines are moderately associated with intussusception.

At least 19 countries have no-fault compensation programs to provide compensation for those with severe adverse effects of vaccination. The United States&#x27; program is known as the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, and the United Kingdom employs the Vaccine Damage Payment.

==Types==

Vaccines typically contain attenuated, inactivated or dead organisms or purified products derived from them. There are several types of vaccines in use. These represent different strategies used to try to reduce the risk of illness while retaining the ability to induce a beneficial immune response.

===Attenuated===
Some vaccines contain live, attenuated microorganisms. Many of these are active viruses that have been cultivated under conditions that disable their virulent properties, or that use closely related but less dangerous organisms to produce a broad immune response. Although most attenuated vaccines are viral, some are bacterial in nature. Examples include the viral diseases yellow fever, measles, mumps, and rubella, and the bacterial disease typhoid. The live &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; vaccine developed by Calmette and Guérin is not made of a contagious strain but contains a virulently modified strain called &quot;BCG&quot; used to elicit an immune response to the vaccine. The live attenuated vaccine containing strain &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; EV is used for plague immunization. Attenuated vaccines have some advantages and disadvantages. Attenuated, or live, weakened, vaccines typically provoke more durable immunological responses. Attenuated vaccines also elicit a cellular and humoral response. However, they may not be safe for use in immunocompromised individuals, and on rare occasions mutate to a virulent form and cause disease.

===Inactivated===
Some vaccines contain microorganisms that have been killed or inactivated by physical or chemical means. Examples include IPV (polio vaccine), hepatitis A vaccine, rabies vaccine and most influenza vaccines.

===Toxoid===
Toxoid vaccines are made from inactivated toxic compounds that cause illness rather than the microorganism. Examples of toxoid-based vaccines include tetanus and diphtheria. Not all toxoids are for microorganisms; for example, &quot;Crotalus atrox&quot; toxoid is used to vaccinate dogs against rattlesnake bites.

===Subunit===
Rather than introducing an inactivated or attenuated microorganism to an immune system (which would constitute a &quot;whole-agent&quot; vaccine), a subunit vaccine uses a fragment of it to create an immune response. One example is the subunit vaccine against hepatitisB, which is composed of only the surface proteins of the virus (previously extracted from the blood serum of chronically infected patients but now produced by recombination of the viral genes into yeast). Other examples include the Gardasil virus-like particle human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subunits of the influenza virus, and edible algae vaccines. A subunit vaccine is being used for plague immunization.

===Conjugate===
Certain bacteria have a polysaccharide outer coat that is poorly immunogenic. By linking these outer coats to proteins (e.g., toxins), the immune system can be led to recognize the polysaccharide as if it were a protein antigen. This approach is used in the &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; type B vaccine.

===Outer membrane vesicle===

Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are naturally immunogenic and can be manipulated to produce potent vaccines. The best known OMV vaccines are those developed for serotype B meningococcal disease.

===Heterotypic===
Heterologous vaccines also known as &quot;Jennerian vaccines&quot;, are vaccines that are pathogens of other animals that either do not cause disease or cause mild disease in the organism being treated. The classic example is Jenner&#x27;s use of cowpox to protect against smallpox. A current example is the use of BCG vaccine made from &quot;Mycobacterium bovis&quot; to protect against tuberculosis.

=== Genetic vaccine ===
Genetic vaccines are based on the principle of uptake of a nucleic acid into cells, whereupon a protein is produced according to the nucleic acid template. This protein is usually the immunodominant antigen of the pathogen or a surface protein that enables the formation of neutralizing antibodies. The subgroup of genetic vaccines encompass viral vector vaccines, RNA vaccines and DNA vaccines.

==== Viral vector ====
Viral vector vaccines use a safe virus to insert pathogen genes in the body to produce specific antigens, such as surface proteins, to stimulate an immune response. Viruses being researched for use as viral vectors include adenovirus, vaccinia virus, and VSV.

====RNA====
An mRNA vaccine (or RNA vaccine) is a novel type of vaccine which is composed of the nucleic acid RNA, packaged within a vector such as lipid nanoparticles. Among the COVID-19 vaccines are a number of RNA vaccines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and some have been approved or have received emergency use authorization in some countries. For example, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and Moderna mRNA vaccine are approved for use in adults and children in the US.

====DNA====
A DNA vaccine uses a DNA plasmid (pDNA)) that encodes for an antigenic protein originating from the pathogen upon which the vaccine will be targeted. pDNA is inexpensive, stable, and relatively safe, making it an excellent option for vaccine delivery.

This approach offers a number of potential advantages over traditional approaches, including the stimulation of both B- and T-cell responses, improved vaccine stability, the absence of any infectious agent and the relative ease of large-scale manufacture.

===Experimental===
Many innovative vaccines are also in development and use.
* Dendritic cell vaccines combine dendritic cells with antigens to present the antigens to the body&#x27;s white blood cells, thus stimulating an immune reaction. These vaccines have shown some positive preliminary results for treating brain tumors and are also tested in malignant melanoma.
* Recombinant vectorby combining the physiology of one microorganism and the DNA of another, immunity can be created against diseases that have complex infection processes. An example is the RVSV-ZEBOV vaccine licensed to Merck that is being used in 2018 to combat ebola in Congo.
* T-cell receptor peptide vaccines are under development for several diseases using models of Valley Fever, stomatitis, and atopic dermatitis. These peptides have been shown to modulate cytokine production and improve cell-mediated immunity.
* Targeting of identified bacterial proteins that are involved in complement inhibition would neutralize the key bacterial virulence mechanism.
* The use of plasmids has been validated in preclinical studies as a protective vaccine strategy for cancer and infectious diseases. However, in human studies, this approach has failed to provide clinically relevant benefit. The overall efficacy of plasmid DNA immunization depends on increasing the plasmid&#x27;s immunogenicity while also correcting for factors involved in the specific activation of immune effector cells.
* Bacterial vector – Similar in principle to viral vector vaccines, but using bacteria instead.
* Antigen-presenting cell
* Technologies which may allow rapid vaccine deployment in response to a novel pathogen include the use of virus-like particles or protein nanoparticles.
* Inverse vaccines are vaccines that train the immune system to not respond to certain substances.

While most vaccines are created using inactivated or attenuated compounds from microorganisms, synthetic vaccines are composed mainly or wholly of synthetic peptides, carbohydrates, or antigens.

==Valence==
Vaccines may be &quot;monovalent&quot; (also called &quot;univalent&quot;) or &quot;multivalent&quot; (also called &quot;polyvalent&quot;). A monovalent vaccine is designed to immunize against a single antigen or single microorganism. A multivalent or polyvalent vaccine is designed to immunize against two or more strains of the same microorganism, or against two or more microorganisms. The valency of a multivalent vaccine may be denoted with a Greek or Latin prefix (e.g., &quot;bivalent&quot;, &quot;trivalent&quot;, or &quot;tetravalent/quadrivalent&quot;). In certain cases, a monovalent vaccine may be preferable for rapidly developing a strong immune response.

=== Interactions ===
When two or more vaccines are mixed in the same formulation, the two vaccines can interfere. This most frequently occurs with live attenuated vaccines, where one of the vaccine components is more robust than the others and suppresses the growth and immune response to the other components.

This phenomenon was noted in the trivalent Sabin polio vaccine, where the relative amount of serotype2 virus in the vaccine had to be reduced to stop it from interfering with the &quot;take&quot; of the serotype1 and3 viruses in the vaccine. To accomplish this, the doses of serotypes1 and3 were increased in the vaccine in the early 1960s. It was also noted in a 2001 study to be a problem with dengue vaccines, where the DEN-3 serotype was found to predominate and suppress the response to DEN-1, -2 and -4 serotypes.

==Other contents==
===Adjuvants===
Vaccines typically contain one or more adjuvants, used to boost the immune response. Tetanus toxoid, for instance, is usually adsorbed onto alum. This presents the antigen in such a way as to produce a greater action than the simple aqueous tetanus toxoid. People who have an adverse reaction to adsorbed tetanus toxoid may be given the simple vaccine when the time comes for a booster.

In the preparation for the 1990 Persian Gulf campaign, the whole cell pertussis vaccine was used as an adjuvant for anthrax vaccine. This produces a more rapid immune response than giving only the anthrax vaccine, which is of some benefit if exposure might be imminent.

===Preservatives===
Vaccines may also contain preservatives to prevent contamination with bacteria or fungi. Until recent years, the preservative thiomersal ( &quot;Thimerosal&quot; in the US and Japan) was used in many vaccines that did not contain live viruses. As of 2005, the only childhood vaccine in the U.S. that contains thiomersal in greater than trace amounts is the influenza vaccine, which is currently recommended only for children with certain risk factors. Single-dose influenza vaccines supplied in the UK do not list thiomersal in the ingredients. Preservatives may be used at various stages of the production of vaccines, and the most sophisticated methods of measurement might detect traces of them in the finished product, as they may in the environment and population as a whole.

Many vaccines need preservatives to prevent serious adverse effects such as &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; infection, which in one 1928 incident killed 12 of 21 children inoculated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative. Several preservatives are available, including thiomersal, phenoxyethanol, and formaldehyde. Thiomersal is more effective against bacteria, has a better shelf-life, and improves vaccine stability, potency, and safety; but, in the U.S., the European Union, and a few other affluent countries, it is no longer used as a preservative in childhood vaccines, as a precautionary measure due to its mercury content. Although controversial claims have been made that thiomersal contributes to autism, no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims. Furthermore, a 10–11-year study of 657,461 children found that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism and actually reduced the risk of autism by seven percent.

===Excipients===
Beside the active vaccine itself, the following excipients and residual manufacturing compounds are present or may be present in vaccine preparations:
* Aluminum salts or gels are added as adjuvants. Adjuvants are added to promote an earlier, more potent response, and more persistent immune response to the vaccine; they allow for a lower vaccine dosage.
* Antibiotics are added to some vaccines to prevent the growth of bacteria during production and storage of the vaccine.
* Egg protein is present in the influenza vaccine and yellow fever vaccine as they are prepared using chicken eggs. Other proteins may be present.
* Formaldehyde is used to inactivate bacterial products for toxoid vaccines. Formaldehyde is also used to inactivate unwanted viruses and kill bacteria that might contaminate the vaccine during production.
* Monosodium glutamate (MSG) and 2-phenoxyethanol are used as stabilizers in a few vaccines to help the vaccine remain unchanged when the vaccine is exposed to heat, light, acidity, or humidity.
* Thiomersal is a mercury-containing antimicrobial that is added to vials of vaccines that contain more than one dose to prevent contamination and growth of potentially harmful bacteria. Due to the controversy surrounding thiomersal, it has been removed from most vaccines except multi-use influenza, where it was reduced to levels so that a single dose contained less than a microgram of mercury, a level similar to eating ten grams of canned tuna.

==Nomenclature==
Various fairly standardized abbreviations for vaccine names have developed, although the standardization is by no means centralized or global. For example, the vaccine names used in the United States have well-established abbreviations that are also widely known and used elsewhere. An extensive list of them provided in a sortable table and freely accessible is available at a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention web page. The page explains that &quot;The abbreviations [in] this table (Column 3) were standardized jointly by staff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ACIP Work Groups, the editor of the &quot;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&quot; (MMWR), the editor of &quot;Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases&quot; (the Pink Book), ACIP members, and liaison organizations to the ACIP.&quot;

Some examples are &quot;DTaP&quot; for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine, &quot;DT&quot; for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and &quot;Td&quot; for tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. At its page on tetanus vaccination, the CDC further explains that &quot;Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case &quot;d&quot; and &quot;p&quot; denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The &#x27;a&#x27; in DTaP and Tdap stands for &#x27;acellular&#x27;, meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.&quot;

Another list of established vaccine abbreviations is at the CDC&#x27;s page called &quot;Vaccine Acronyms and Abbreviations&quot;, with abbreviations used on U.S. immunization records. The United States Adopted Name system has some conventions for the word order of vaccine names, placing head nouns first and adjectives postpositively. This is why the USAN for &quot;OPV&quot; is &quot;poliovirus vaccine live oral&quot; rather than &quot;oral poliovirus vaccine&quot;.

==Licensing==

A vaccine &quot;licensure&quot; occurs after the successful conclusion of the development cycle and further the clinical trials and other programs involved through PhasesI–III demonstrating safety, immunoactivity, immunogenetic safety at a given specific dose, proven effectiveness in preventing infection for target populations, and enduring preventive effect (time endurance or need for revaccination must be estimated). Because preventive vaccines are predominantly evaluated in healthy population cohorts and distributed among the general population, a high standard of safety is required. As part of a multinational licensing of a vaccine, the World Health Organization &quot;Expert Committee on Biological Standardization&quot; developed guidelines of international standards for manufacturing and quality control of vaccines, a process intended as a platform for national regulatory agencies to apply for their own licensing process. Vaccine manufacturers do not receive licensing until a complete clinical cycle of development and trials proves the vaccine is safe and has long-term effectiveness, following scientific review by a multinational or national regulatory organization, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Upon developing countries adopting WHO guidelines for vaccine development and licensure, each country has its own responsibility to issue a national licensure, and to manage, deploy, and monitor the vaccine throughout its use in each nation. Building trust and acceptance of a licensed vaccine among the public is a task of communication by governments and healthcare personnel to ensure a vaccination campaign proceeds smoothly, saves lives, and enables economic recovery. When a vaccine is licensed, it will initially be in limited supply due to variable manufacturing, distribution, and logistical factors, requiring an allocation plan for the limited supply and which population segments should be prioritized to first receive the vaccine.

===World Health Organization===
Vaccines developed for multinational distribution via the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) require pre-qualification by the WHO to ensure international standards of quality, safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy for adoption by numerous countries.

The process requires manufacturing consistency at WHO-contracted laboratories following Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). When UN agencies are involved in vaccine licensure, individual nations collaborate by 1) issuing marketing authorization and a national license for the vaccine, its manufacturers, and distribution partners; and 2) conducting postmarketing surveillance, including records for adverse events after the vaccination program. The WHO works with national agencies to monitor inspections of manufacturing facilities and distributors for compliance with GMP and regulatory oversight.

Some countries choose to buy vaccines licensed by reputable national organizations, such as EMA, FDA, or national agencies in other affluent countries, but such purchases typically are more expensive and may not have distribution resources suitable to local conditions in developing countries.

===European Union===
In the European Union (EU), vaccines for pandemic pathogens, such as seasonal influenza, are licensed EU-wide where all the member states comply (&quot;centralized&quot;), are licensed for only some member states (&quot;decentralized&quot;), or are licensed on an individual national level. Generally, all EU states follow regulatory guidance and clinical programs defined by the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), a scientific panel of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) responsible for vaccine licensure. The CHMP is supported by several expert groups who assess and monitor the progress of a vaccine before and after licensure and distribution.

===United States===
Under the FDA, the process of establishing evidence for vaccine clinical safety and efficacy is the same as for the approval process for prescription drugs. If successful through the stages of clinical development, the vaccine licensing process is followed by a Biologics License Application which must provide a scientific review team (from diverse disciplines, such as physicians, statisticians, microbiologists, chemists) and comprehensive documentation for the vaccine candidate having efficacy and safety throughout its development. Also during this stage, the proposed manufacturing facility is examined by expert reviewers for GMP compliance, and the label must have a compliant description to enable health care providers&#x27; definition of vaccine-specific use, including its possible risks, to communicate and deliver the vaccine to the public. After licensure, monitoring of the vaccine and its production, including periodic inspections for GMP compliance, continue as long as the manufacturer retains its license, which may include additional submissions to the FDA of tests for potency, safety, and purity for each vaccine manufacturing step.

===India===
In India, the Drugs Controller General, the head of department of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, India&#x27;s national regulatory body for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, is responsible for the approval of licences for specified categories of drugs such as vaccines and other medicinal items, such as blood or blood products, IV fluids, and sera.

===Postmarketing surveillance===
Until a vaccine is in use amongst the general population, all potential adverse events from the vaccine may not be known, requiring manufacturers to conduct PhaseIV studies for postmarketing surveillance of the vaccine while it is used widely in the public. The WHO works with UN member states to implement post-licensing surveillance. The FDA relies on a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System to monitor safety concerns about a vaccine throughout its use in the American public.

==Scheduling==


In order to provide the best protection, children are recommended to receive vaccinations as soon as their immune systems are sufficiently developed to respond to particular vaccines, with additional &quot;booster&quot; shots often required to achieve &quot;full immunity&quot;. This has led to the development of complex vaccination schedules. Global recommendations of vaccination schedule are issued by Strategic Advisory Group of Experts and will be further translated by advisory committee at the country level with considering of local factors such as disease epidemiology, acceptability of vaccination, equity in local populations, and programmatic and financial constraint. In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends schedule additions for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommends routine vaccination of children against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, polio, mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, HiB, chickenpox, rotavirus, influenza, meningococcal disease and pneumonia.

The large number of vaccines and boosters recommended (up to 24 injections by age two) has led to problems with achieving full compliance. To combat declining compliance rates, various notification systems have been instituted and many combination injections are now marketed (e.g., Pentavalent vaccine and MMRV vaccine), which protect against multiple diseases.

Besides recommendations for infant vaccinations and boosters, many specific vaccines are recommended for other ages or for repeated injections throughout lifemost commonly for measles, tetanus, influenza, and pneumonia. Pregnant women are often screened for continued resistance to rubella. The human papillomavirus vaccine is recommended in the U.S. (as of 2011) and UK (as of 2009). Vaccine recommendations for the elderly concentrate on pneumonia and influenza, which are more deadly to that group. In 2006, a vaccine was introduced against shingles, a disease caused by the chickenpox virus, which usually affects the elderly.

Scheduling and dosing of a vaccination may be tailored to the level of immunocompetence of an individual and to optimize population-wide deployment of a vaccine when it supply is limited, e.g. in the setting of a pandemic.

==Economics of development==
One challenge in vaccine development is economic: Many of the diseases most demanding a vaccine, including HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, exist principally in poor countries. Pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies have little incentive to develop vaccines for these diseases because there is little revenue potential. Even in more affluent countries, financial returns are usually minimal and the financial and other risks are great.

Most vaccine development to date has relied on &quot;push&quot; funding by government, universities and non-profit organizations. Many vaccines have been highly cost effective and beneficial for public health. The number of vaccines actually administered has risen dramatically in recent decades. This increase, particularly in the number of different vaccines administered to children before entry into schools may be due to government mandates and support, rather than economic incentive.

===Patents===
According to the World Health Organization, the biggest barrier to vaccine production in less developed countries has not been patents, but the substantial financial, infrastructure, and workforce requirements needed for market entry. Vaccines are complex mixtures of biological compounds, and unlike the case for prescription drugs, there are no true generic vaccines. The vaccine produced by a new facility must undergo complete clinical testing for safety and efficacy by the manufacturer. For most vaccines, specific processes in technology are patented. These can be circumvented by alternative manufacturing methods, but this required R&amp;D infrastructure and a suitably skilled workforce. In the case of a few relatively new vaccines, such as the human papillomavirus vaccine, the patents may impose an additional barrier.

When increased production of vaccines was urgently needed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, the World Trade Organization and governments around the world evaluated whether to waive intellectual property rights and patents on COVID-19 vaccines, which would &quot;eliminate all potential barriers to the timely access of affordable COVID-19 medical products, including vaccines and medicines, and scale up the manufacturing and supply of essential medical products&quot;.

==Production==
Vaccine production is fundamentally different from other kinds of manufacturingincluding regular pharmaceutical manufacturingin that vaccines are intended to be administered to millions of people of whom the vast majority are perfectly healthy. This fact drives an extraordinarily rigorous production process with strict compliance requirements that go far beyond what is required of other products.

Depending upon the antigen, it can cost anywhere from US$50 to $500 million to build a vaccine production facility, which requires highly specialized equipment, clean rooms, and containment rooms. There is a global scarcity of personnel with the right combination of skills, expertise, knowledge, competence and personality to staff vaccine production lines. With the notable exceptions of Brazil, China, and India, many developing countries&#x27; educational systems are unable to provide enough qualified candidates, and vaccine makers based in such countries must hire expatriate personnel to keep production going.

Vaccine production has several stages. First, the antigen itself is generated. Viruses are grown either on primary cells such as chicken eggs (e.g., for influenza) or on continuous cell lines such as cultured human cells (e.g., for hepatitis A). Bacteria are grown in bioreactors (e.g., &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; type b). Likewise, a recombinant protein derived from the viruses or bacteria can be generated in yeast, bacteria, or cell cultures.

After the antigen is generated, it is isolated from the cells used to generate it. A virus may need to be inactivated, possibly with no further purification required. Recombinant proteins need many operations involving ultrafiltration and column chromatography. Finally, the vaccine is formulated by adding adjuvant, stabilizers, and preservatives as needed. The adjuvant enhances the immune response to the antigen, stabilizers increase the storage life, and preservatives allow the use of multidose vials. Combination vaccines are harder to develop and produce, because of potential incompatibilities and interactions among the antigens and other ingredients involved.

The final stage in vaccine manufacture before distribution is fill and finish, which is the process of filling vials with vaccines and packaging them for distribution. Although this is a conceptually simple part of the vaccine manufacture process, it is often a bottleneck in the process of distributing and administering vaccines.

Vaccine production techniques are evolving. Cultured mammalian cells are expected to become increasingly important, compared to conventional options such as chicken eggs, due to greater productivity and low incidence of problems with contamination. Recombination technology that produces genetically detoxified vaccines is expected to grow in popularity for the production of bacterial vaccines that use toxoids. Combination vaccines are expected to reduce the quantities of antigens they contain, and thereby decrease undesirable interactions, by using pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

===Vaccine manufacturers===
The companies with the highest market share in vaccine production are Merck, Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer and Novartis, with 70% of vaccine sales concentrated in the EU or US (2013). Vaccine manufacturing plants require large capital investments ($50 million up to $300 million) and may take between 4 and 6 years to construct, with the full process of vaccine development taking between 10 and 15 years. Manufacturing in developing countries is playing an increasing role in supplying these countries, specifically with regards to older vaccines and in Brazil, India and China. The manufacturers in India are the most advanced in the developing world and include the Serum Institute of India, one of the largest producers of vaccines by number of doses and an innovator in processes, recently improving efficiency of producing the measles vaccine by 10 to 20-fold, due to switching to a MRC-5 cell culture instead of chicken eggs. China&#x27;s manufacturing capabilities are focused on supplying their own domestic need, with Sinopharm (CNPGC) alone providing over 85% of the doses for 14 different vaccines in China. Brazil is approaching the point of supplying its own domestic needs using technology transferred from the developed world.

==Delivery systems==
One of the most common methods of delivering vaccines into the human body is injection.

The development of new delivery systems raises the hope of vaccines that are safer and more efficient to deliver and administer. Lines of research include liposomes and &quot;ISCOM&quot; (immune stimulating complex).

Notable developments in vaccine delivery technologies have included oral vaccines. Early attempts to apply oral vaccines showed varying degrees of promise, beginning early in the 20th century, at a time when the very possibility of an effective oral antibacterial vaccine was controversial. By the 1930s there was increasing interest in the prophylactic value of an oral typhoid fever vaccine for example.

An oral polio vaccine turned out to be effective when vaccinations were administered by volunteer staff without formal training; the results also demonstrated increased ease and efficiency of administering the vaccines. Effective oral vaccines have many advantages; for example, there is no risk of blood contamination. Vaccines intended for oral administration need not be liquid, and as solids, they commonly are more stable and less prone to damage or spoilage by freezing in transport and storage. Such stability reduces the need for a &quot;cold chain&quot;: the resources required to keep vaccines within a restricted temperature range from the manufacturing stage to the point of administration, which, in turn, may decrease costs of vaccines.

A microneedle approach, which is still in stages of development, uses &quot;pointed projections fabricated into arrays that can create vaccine delivery pathways through the skin&quot;.

An experimental needle-free vaccine delivery system is undergoing animal testing. A stamp-size patch similar to an adhesive bandage contains about 20,000 microscopic projections per square cm. This dermal administration potentially increases the effectiveness of vaccination, while requiring less vaccine than injection.

==In veterinary medicine==

Vaccinations of animals are used both to prevent their contracting diseases and to prevent transmission of disease to humans. Both animals kept as pets and animals raised as livestock are routinely vaccinated. In some instances, wild populations may be vaccinated. This is sometimes accomplished with vaccine-laced food spread in a disease-prone area and has been used to attempt to control rabies in raccoons.

Where rabies occurs, rabies vaccination of dogs may be required by law. Other canine vaccines include canine distemper, canine parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis, adenovirus-2, leptospirosis, &quot;Bordetella&quot;, canine parainfluenza virus, and Lyme disease, among others.

Cases of veterinary vaccines used in humans have been documented, whether intentional or accidental, with some cases of resultant illness, most notably with brucellosis. However, the reporting of such cases is rare and very little has been studied about the safety and results of such practices. With the advent of aerosol vaccination in veterinary clinics, human exposure to pathogens not naturally carried in humans, such as &quot;Bordetella bronchiseptica&quot;, has likely increased in recent years. In some cases, most notably rabies, the parallel veterinary vaccine against a pathogen may be as much as orders of magnitude more economical than the human one.

===DIVA vaccines===
DIVA (Differentiation of Infected from Vaccinated Animals), also known as SIVA (Segregation of Infected from Vaccinated Animals) vaccines, make it possible to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals. DIVA vaccines carry at least one epitope less than the equivalent wild microorganism. An accompanying diagnostic test that detects the antibody against that epitope assists in identifying whether the animal has been vaccinated or not.

The first DIVA vaccines (formerly termed marker vaccines and since 1999 coined as DIVA vaccines) and companion diagnostic tests were developed by J. T. van Oirschot and colleagues at the Central Veterinary Institute in Lelystad, The Netherlands. They found that some existing vaccines against pseudorabies (also termed Aujeszky&#x27;s disease) had deletions in their viral genome (among which was the gE gene). Monoclonal antibodies were produced against that deletion and selected to develop an ELISA that demonstrated antibodies against gE. In addition, novel genetically engineered gE-negative vaccines were constructed. Along the same lines, DIVA vaccines and companion diagnostic tests against bovine herpesvirus1 infections have been developed.

The DIVA strategy has been applied in various countries to successfully eradicate pseudorabies virus from those countries. Swine populations were intensively vaccinated and monitored by the companion diagnostic test and, subsequently, the infected pigs were removed from the population. Bovine herpesvirus1 DIVA vaccines are also widely used in practice. Considerable efforts are ongoing to apply the DIVA principle to a wide range of infectious diseases, such as classical swine fever, avian influenza, &quot;Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia&quot; and &quot;Salmonella&quot; infections in pigs.

==History==

Prior to the introduction of vaccination with material from cases of cowpox (heterotypic immunisation), smallpox could be prevented by deliberate variolation with smallpox virus. According to historian Joseph Needham, Taoists in China as far back as the 10th century practiced a form of inoculation and passed it down through oral tradition, though Needham&#x27;s claim has been criticized since the practice was not written about. The Chinese also practiced the oldest documented use of variolation, dating back to the fifteenth century. They implemented a method of &quot;nasal insufflation&quot; administered by blowing powdered smallpox material, usually scabs, up the nostrils. Various insufflation techniques have been recorded throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries within China. Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers. In France, Voltaire reports that the Chinese have practiced variolation &quot;these hundred years&quot;.
Mary Wortley Montagu, who had witnessed variolation in Turkey, had her four-year-old daughter variolated in the presence of physicians of the Royal Court in 1721 upon her return to England. Later on that year, Charles Maitland conducted an experimental variolation of six prisoners in Newgate Prison in London. The experiment was a success, and soon variolation was drawing attention from the royal family, who helped promote the procedure. However, in 1783, several days after Prince Octavius of Great Britain was inoculated, he died. In 1796, the physician Edward Jenner took pus from the hand of a milkmaid with cowpox, scratched it into the arm of an 8-year-old boy, James Phipps, and six weeks later variolated the boy with smallpox, afterwards observing that he did not catch smallpox. Jenner extended his studies and, in 1798, reported that his vaccine was safe in children and adults, and could be transferred from arm-to-arm, which reduced reliance on uncertain supplies from infected cows. In 1804, the Spanish Balmis smallpox vaccination expedition to Spain&#x27;s colonies Mexico and Philippines used the arm-to-arm transport method to get around the fact the vaccine survived for only 12 days &quot;in vitro&quot;. They used cowpox. Since vaccination with cowpox was much safer than smallpox inoculation, the latter, though still widely practiced in England, was banned in 1840.
Following on from Jenner&#x27;s work, the second generation of vaccines was introduced in the 1880s by Louis Pasteur who developed vaccines for chicken cholera and anthrax, and from the late nineteenth century vaccines were considered a matter of national prestige. National vaccination policies were adopted and compulsory vaccination laws were passed. In 1931 Alice Miles Woodruff and Ernest Goodpasture documented that the fowlpox virus could be grown in embryonated chicken egg. Soon scientists began cultivating other viruses in eggs. Eggs were used for virus propagation in the development of a yellow fever vaccine in 1935 and an influenza vaccine in 1945. In 1959 growth media and cell culture replaced eggs as the standard method of virus propagation for vaccines.

Vaccinology flourished in the twentieth century, which saw the introduction of several successful vaccines, including those against diphtheria, measles, mumps, and rubella. Major achievements included the development of the polio vaccine in the 1950s and the eradication of smallpox during the 1960s and 1970s. Maurice Hilleman was the most prolific of the developers of the vaccines in the twentieth century. As vaccines became more common, many people began taking them for granted. However, vaccines remain elusive for many important diseases, including herpes simplex, malaria, gonorrhea, and HIV.

===Generations of vaccines===
First generation vaccines are whole-organism vaccineseither live and weakened, or killed forms. Live, attenuated vaccines, such as smallpox and polio vaccines, are able to induce killer T-cell (TC or CTL) responses, helper T-cell (TH) responses and antibody immunity. However, attenuated forms of a pathogen can convert to a dangerous form and may cause disease in immunocompromised vaccine recipients (such as those with AIDS). While killed vaccines do not have this risk, they cannot generate specific killer T-cell responses and may not work at all for some diseases.

Second generation vaccines were developed to reduce the risks from live vaccines. These are subunit vaccines, consisting of specific protein antigens (such as tetanus or diphtheria toxoid) or recombinant protein components (such as the hepatitis B surface antigen). They can generate TH and antibody responses, but not killer T cell responses.

RNA vaccines and DNA vaccines are examples of third generation vaccines. In 2016 a DNA vaccine for the Zika virus began testing at the National Institutes of Health. Separately, Inovio Pharmaceuticals and GeneOne Life Science began tests of a different DNA vaccine against Zika in Miami. Manufacturing the vaccines in volume was unsolved as of 2016. Clinical trials for DNA vaccines to prevent HIV are underway. mRNA vaccines such as BNT162b2 were developed in the year 2020 with the help of Operation Warp Speed and massively deployed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman received Columbia University&#x27;s Horwitz Prize for their pioneering research in mRNA vaccine technology.

==Trends==
Since at least 2013, scientists have been trying to develop synthetic third-generation vaccines by reconstructing the outside structure of a virus; it was hoped that this will help prevent vaccine resistance.

Principles that govern the immune response can now be used in tailor-made vaccines against many noninfectious human diseases, such as cancers and autoimmune disorders. For example, the experimental vaccine CYT006-AngQb has been investigated as a possible treatment for high blood pressure. Factors that affect the trends of vaccine development include progress in translatory medicine, demographics, regulatory science, political, cultural, and social responses.

===Plants as bioreactors for vaccine production===
The idea of vaccine production via transgenic plants was identified as early as 2003. Plants such as tobacco, potato, tomato, and banana can have genes inserted that cause them to produce vaccines usable for humans. In 2005, bananas were developed that produce a human vaccine against hepatitis B.

== Vaccine hesitancy ==

Vaccine hesitancy is a delay in acceptance, or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccine services. The term covers outright refusals to vaccinate, delaying vaccines, accepting vaccines but remaining uncertain about their use, or using certain vaccines but not others. There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that vaccines are generally safe and effective. Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. The World Health Organization therefore characterized vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats in 2019.

<text>Veterinary medicine is the branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, management, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, disorder, and injury in non-human animals. The scope of veterinary medicine is wide, covering all animal species, both domesticated and wild, with a wide range of conditions that can affect different species.

Veterinary medicine is widely practiced, both with and without professional supervision. Professional care is most often led by a veterinary physician (also known as a veterinarian, veterinary surgeon, or &quot;vet&quot;), but also by paraveterinary workers, such as veterinary nurses, veterinary technicians, and veterinary assistants. This can be augmented by other paraprofessionals with specific specialties, such as animal physiotherapy or dentistry, and species-relevant roles such as farriers.

Veterinary science helps human health through the monitoring and control of zoonotic disease (infectious disease transmitted from nonhuman animals to humans), food safety, and through human applications via medical research. They also help to maintain food supply through livestock health monitoring and treatment, and mental health by keeping pets healthy and long-living. Veterinary scientists often collaborate with epidemiologists and other health or natural scientists, depending on type of work. Ethically, veterinarians are usually obliged to look after animal welfare. Veterinarians diagnose, treat, and help keep animals safe and healthy.

== History ==

===Premodern era===
Archeological evidence, in the form of a cow skull upon which trepanation had been performed, shows that people were performing veterinary procedures in the Neolithic (3400–3000 BCE). 

The Egyptian &quot;Papyrus of Kahun&quot; (Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt) is the first extant record of veterinary medicine.

The &quot;Shalihotra Samhita&quot;, dating from the time of Ashoka, is an early Indian veterinary treatise. The edicts of Asoka read: &quot;Everywhere King Piyadasi (Asoka) made two kinds of medicine (चिकित्सा) available, medicine for people, and medicine for animals. Where no healing herbs for people and animals were available, he ordered that they be bought and planted.&quot;

&quot;Hippiatrica&quot; is a Byzantine compilation of hippiatrics, dated to the fifth or sixth century AD.

The first attempts to organize and regulate the practice of treating animals tended to focus on horses because of their economic significance. In the Middle Ages, farriers combined their work in horseshoeing with the more general task of &quot;horse doctoring&quot;.
The Arabic tradition of &quot;Bayṭara&quot;, or &quot;Shiyāt al-Khayl&quot;, originates with the treatise of Ibn Akhī Hizām (fl. late ninth century).

In 1356, the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Henry Picard, concerned at the poor standard of care given to horses in the city, requested that all farriers operating within a 7-mile (11-km) radius of the City of London form a &quot;fellowship&quot; to regulate and improve their practices. This ultimately led to the establishment of the Worshipful Company of Farriers in 1674.

Meanwhile, Carlo Ruini&#x27;s book (&quot;Anatomy of the Horse&quot;) was published in 1598. It was the first comprehensive treatise on the anatomy of a nonhuman species.
===Establishment of profession===

The first veterinary school was founded in Lyon, France, in 1762 by Claude Bourgelat. According to Lupton, after observing the devastation being caused by cattle plague to the French herds, Bourgelat devoted his time to seeking out a remedy. This resulted in founding a veterinary school in Lyon in 1761, from which establishment he dispatched students to combat the disease; in a short time, the plague was stayed and the health of stock restored, through the assistance rendered to agriculture by veterinary science and art. The school received immediate international recognition in the 18th century and its pedagogical model drew on the existing fields of human medicine, natural history, and comparative anatomy.

The Swedish veterinary education received funding 1774, and was officially started May 8th 1775 when the king Gustaf III signed the document.
Peter Hernquist, who had studied for Carl von Linné in Uppsala, and also studied in Lyon with Claude Bourgelat, was head of school and is considered father of veterinary medicine in Sweden. 

The Odiham Agricultural Society was founded in 1783 in England to promote agriculture and industry, and played an important role in the foundation of the veterinary profession in Britain. A founding member, Thomas Burgess, began to take up the cause of animal welfare and campaign for the more humane treatment of sick animals. A 1785 society meeting resolved to &quot;promote the study of Farriery upon rational scientific principles.&quot;

Physician James Clark wrote a treatise entitled &quot;Prevention of Disease&quot; in which he argued for the professionalization of the veterinary trade, and the establishment of veterinary colleges. This was finally achieved in 1790, through the campaigning of Granville Penn, who persuaded Frenchman Benoit Vial de St. Bel to accept the professorship of the newly established veterinary college in London. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons was established by royal charter in 1844. Veterinary science came of age in the late 19th century, with notable contributions from Sir John McFadyean, credited by many as having been the founder of modern veterinary research.

In the United States, the first schools were established in the early 19th century in Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia. In 1879, Iowa Agricultural College became the first land-grant college to establish a school of veterinary medicine.

==Veterinary workers==

===Veterinary physicians===

Veterinary care and management are usually led by a veterinary physician (usually called a veterinarian, veterinary surgeon or &quot;vet&quot;) who has received their doctor of veterinary medicine degree. This role is the equivalent of a physician or surgeon (medical doctor) in human medicine, and involves postgraduate study and qualification.

In many countries, the local nomenclature for a vet is a protected term, meaning that people without the prerequisite qualifications and/or registration are not able to use the title, and in many cases, the activities that may be undertaken by a vet (such as animal treatment or surgery) are restricted only to those people who are registered as vet. For instance, in the United Kingdom, as in other jurisdictions, animal treatment may be performed only by registered vets (with a few designated exceptions, such as paraveterinary workers), calling oneself a vet without being registered or performing any treatment is illegal.

Most vets work in clinical settings, treating animals directly. They may be involved in a general practice, treating animals of all types; may be specialized in a specific group of animals such as companion animals, livestock, laboratory animals, zoo animals, or horses; or may specialize in a narrow medical discipline such as veterinary surgery, dermatology, cardiology, neurology, laboratory animal medicine, internal medicine, and more.

As healthcare professionals, vets face ethical decisions about the care of their patients. Current debates within the profession include the veterinary ethics of purely cosmetic procedures on animals, such as declawing of cats, docking of tails, cropping of ears, and debarking on dogs.

A wide range of surgeries and operations is performed on various types of animals, but not all of them are carried out by vets. In a case in Iran, for instance, an eye surgeon managed to perform a successful cataract surgery on a rooster for the first time in the world.

===Paraveterinary workers===
Paraveterinary workers, including veterinary nurses, veterinary technicians, and veterinary assistants, either assist vets in their work, or may work within their own scope of practice, depending on skills and qualifications, including in some cases, performing minor surgery.

The role of paraveterinary workers is less homogeneous globally than that of a vet, and qualification levels, and the associated skill mix, vary widely.

===Allied professions===
A number of professions exist within the scope of veterinary medicine, but may not necessarily be performed by vets or veterinary nurses. This includes those performing roles which are also found in human medicine, such as practitioners dealing with musculoskeletal disorders, including osteopaths, chiropractors, and physiotherapists.

Some roles are specific to animals, but which have parallels in human society, such as animal grooming and animal massage. Some roles are specific to a species or group of animals, such as farriers, who are involved in the shoeing of horses, and in many cases have a major role to play in ensuring the medical fitness of horses.

==Veterinary research==

Veterinary research includes prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases of animals, and basic biology, welfare, and care of animals. Veterinary research transcends species boundaries and includes the study of spontaneously occurring and experimentally induced models of both human and animal diseases and research at human-animal interfaces, such as food safety, wildlife and ecosystem health, zoonotic diseases, and public policy. By value the most important Animal Health pharmaceutical supplier worldwide is by far Zoetis (United States).

===Clinical veterinary research===
As in medicine, randomized controlled trials also are fundamental in veterinary medicine to establish the effectiveness of a treatment. Clinical veterinary research is far behind human medical research, though, with fewer randomized controlled trials, that have a lower quality and are mostly focused on research animals. Possible improvement consists in creation of networks for inclusion of private veterinary practices in randomized controlled trials. Although the FDA approves drugs for use in humans, the FDA keeps a separate &quot;Green Book&quot;, which lists drugs approved specifically for veterinary medicine (about half of which are separately approved for use in humans).

No studies exist on the effect of community animal health services on improving household wealth and the health status of low-income farmers.

The first recorded use of regenerative stem-cell therapy to treat lesions in a wild animal occurred in 2011 in Brazil. On that occasion, the used stem cells to treat a maned wolf who had been run over by a car, which was later returned, fully recovered, to nature.

<doc id="32658" wikidata="Q244323" url="?curid=32658" title="Visegrád Group">
<text>The Visegrád Group (also known as the Visegrád Four or the V4) is a cultural and political alliance of four Central European countries: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. The alliance aims to advance co-operation in military, economic, cultural and energy affairs. All four states are also members of the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the Three Seas Initiative.

The alliance traces its origins to the summit meetings of leaders of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, held in the Hungarian castle town of Visegrád on 15 February 1991. Visegrád was chosen as the location for the summits as an intentional allusion to the medieval Congress of Visegrád between John I of Bohemia, Charles I of Hungary, and Casimir III of Poland in 1335.

After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia became independent members of the alliance, increasing the number of members from three to four. All four members of the Visegrád Group joined the European Union on 1 May 2004, achieving its main goal.

During the European immigration crisis in 2015, the Visegrad Group successfully blocked EU-level actions aimed at implementing the forced relocation of illegal immigrants within the member states. At that time EU Commission started infringement procedures against actions of the Hungarian and Polish national-conservative governments, claiming that they undermine democracy, media freedom, and the independence of the judiciary. The Visegrad Four became politically split due to changes in governments and diverging reactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Yet its role in fostering exchange among countries&#x27; public servants and civil societies (Visegrad Fund) remains crucial. If the Visegrád Group were a single country, its land area, population, and economy would be similar to those of Metropolitan France.

==History==
===Background (1335–1989)===

The name of the Visegrád Group references the place of meeting selected for the 1335 Congress of Visegrád held by the Bohemian (Czech), Polish, and Hungarian rulers in Visegrád. Charles I of Hungary, Casimir III of Poland, and John I of Bohemia agreed to create new commercial routes to bypass the city of Vienna (a staple port, which required goods to be offloaded and offered for sale in the city before they could be sold elsewhere) and to obtain easier access to other European markets. The recognition of Czech sovereignty over the Duchy of Silesia was also confirmed. The second Congress of Visegrád took place in 1339 and decided that if Casimir III of Poland died without a son (as actually happened in 1370), then the son of Charles I of Hungary, Louis I of Hungary would become the King of Poland.

From the 16th century, large parts of the present-day territories of the group&#x27;s members became part of, or were influenced, by the Vienna-based Habsburg monarchy. This situation continued until the end of World War I and the dissolution of Habsburg-ruled Austria-Hungary in 1918. In the three years after the end of World War II in 1945 the countries became satellite states of the Soviet Union, as the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. In 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the fall of communism in central and eastern Europe enabled Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia to adopt capitalism and democracy. In December 1991, the fall of the Soviet Union occurred, further allowing the three countries to look westward.

===Establishment (1990s)===
The Visegrád Group was established on 15 February 1991 at a meeting between the President of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, Václav Havel, the President of the Republic of Poland, Lech Wałęsa, and the Prime Minister of the Republic of Hungary, József Antall, in the Hungarian town of Visegrád. The group was created with the aim of moving away from communism and implementing the reforms required for full membership of the Euro-Atlantic institutions, such as NATO and the EU.

After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia became independent members of the alliance, raising the number of members from three to four. All four members of the Visegrád Group joined the European Union on 1 May 2004.

===Contemporary history (2004–present)===
With all four Visegrad countries joining the EU in 2004, the primary goal of the group was achieved. Since then, the Visegrad Group has focused mostly on cultural cooperation through the Visegrad Fund and expert-level cooperation on topics such as infrastructure. The group became politically active and media visible during the European Migration Crisis in 2015. The Visegrad countries forcefully fought against the EU quota that aimed to distribute Syrian refugees from the overwhelmed southern EU countries across the continent. The coherence of the group decreased with the lower salience of migration in the subsequent years.

The full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022 caused a rift within the group. The Hungarian government under Viktor Orbán and the Slovak government under Robert Fico rejected support for Ukraine and echoed Russian claims that the war had been provoked by NATO. On the other hand, the Czech government under Petr Fiala and the Polish government under Donald Tusk are among the strongest supporters of Ukraine. This rift was highlighted by the summit in Prague in 2024, where Fiala said it &quot;wouldn&#x27;t make sense that we differ in the views of the cause of the Russian aggression against Ukraine and the ways of solving it.&quot; Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski also stressed that the priority for Poland (the largest country in the group) should be collaboration within the Weimar Triangle (Poland, Germany, France) and with the US, rather than with the Visegrad Four.

While some Czech politicians even called for leaving the Visegrad Four, Vít Dostál, head of the foreign policy think-tank AMO, argued that the V4 survived many governments with differing foreign policy priorities. He highlighted V4&#x27;s crucial role in networking among public servants (down to the level of ministerial experts), which helps the four countries in EU negotiations - as well as networking among civil society actors.

==Economies==

All four nations in the Visegrád Group are high-income countries with a very high Human Development Index. V4 countries have experienced more or less steady economic growth for over a century. 

=== History and categorization ===
Economic transformation from communist central-planning to democratic market-economy was one of the goals of the Visegrad cooperation and was seen as an integral part of the so-called “Return to Europe”. The Visegrad countries succeeded to various levels and managed to overcome the economic slump after the 1989 revolution during the 1990s. With integration into the European Union, they chose an export-led FDI-dependent growth model. Not only due to their geographical proximity to Germany, but also due to their elite&#x27;s decision to protect their industrial heritage, they became manufacturing hubs for Western European companies, foremost for the German automotive sector. This strategy differentiates Visegrad countries from other (semi)peripheral economies like the Baltic states (dependent on a debt-driven model) or Southern Europe (debt-based consumption-led model).

In 2009, Slovakia adopted the euro as its official currency, being the only member of the group to have done so. All four countries are eventually obliged to adopt the euro in the future and to join the Eurozone once they have satisfied the euro convergence criteria by the Treaty of Accession since they joined the EU.

=== GDP (per capita) ===
If counted as a single country, the Visegrád Group&#x27;s GDP would be the 4th in the EU, 5th in Europe and 15th in the world. In terms of international trade, the V4 is not only at the forefront of Europe, but also of the world (4th in the EU, 5th in Europe and 8th in the world).

Based on gross domestic product per capita (PPP) estimated figures for the year 2020, the most developed country in the group is the Czech Republic (US$40,858 per capita), followed by Slovakia (US$38,321 per capita), Hungary (US$35,941 per capita) and Poland (US$35,651 per capita). The average GDP (PPP) in 2019 for the entire group is estimated at US$34,865.

=== Nuclear energy ===
Within the EU, the V4 countries are pro-nuclear-power, and are seeking to expand or found (in the case of Poland) a nuclear-power industry. They have sought to counter what they see as an anti-nuclear-power bias within the EU, believing their countries would benefit from nuclear power.

===Czech Republic===
The economy of the Czech Republic is the group&#x27;s second largest (GDP PPP of US$432.346 billion total, ranked 36th in the world).

Within the V4, the Czech Republic has the highest Human Development Index, Human Capital Index, nominal GDP per capita as well as GDP at purchasing power parity per capita.

===Hungary===

Hungary has the group&#x27;s third largest economy (total GDP of US$350.000 billion, 53rd in the world). Hungary was one of the more developed economies of the Eastern bloc. With about $18 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) since 1989, Hungary has attracted over one-third of all FDI in central and eastern Europe, including the former Soviet Union. Of this, about $6 billion came from American companies. Now it is an industrial agricultural state. The main industries are engineering, mechanical engineering (cars, buses), chemical, electrical, textile, and food industries. The services sector accounted for 64.8% of GDP in 2017 (est.).

The main sectors of Hungarian industry are heavy industry (mining, metallurgy, machine and steel production), energy production, mechanical engineering, chemicals, food industry, and automobile production. The industry is leaning mainly on processing industry and (including construction) accounted for 29.32% of GDP in 2008. The leading industry is machinery, followed by the chemical industry (plastic production, pharmaceuticals), while mining, metallurgy and textile industry seemed to be losing importance in the past two decades. In spite of the significant drop in the last decade, the food industry still contributes up to 14% of total industrial production and amounts to 7–8% of the country&#x27;s exports.

Agriculture accounted for 4.3% of GDP in 2008 and along with the food industry occupied roughly 7.7% of the labour force.

Tourism employs nearly 150,000 people and the total income from tourism was 4 billion euros in 2008. One of Hungary&#x27;s top tourist destinations is Lake Balaton, the largest freshwater lake in Central Europe, with 1.2 million visitors in 2008. The most visited region is Budapest; the Hungarian capital attracted 3.61 million visitors in 2008. Hungary was the world&#x27;s 24th most visited country in 2011.

===Poland===

Poland has the region&#x27;s largest economy (GDP PPP total of US$1.353 trillion, ranked 22nd in the world). According to the United Nations and the World Bank, it is a high-income country with a high quality of life and a very high standard of living. The Polish economy is the fifth-largest in the EU and one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe, with a yearly growth rate of over 3.0% between 1991 and 2019.

Poland was the only European Union member to have avoided a decline in GDP during the late-2000s recession, and in 2009 created the most GDP growth of all countries in the EU. The Polish economy had not entered recession nor contracted. According to Poland&#x27;s Central Statistical Office, in 2011 the Polish economic growth rate was 4.3%, the best result in the entire EU. The largest component of its economy is the service sector (67.3%), followed by industry (28.1%) and agriculture (4.6%). Since increased private investment and EU funding assistance, Poland&#x27;s infrastructure has developed rapidly.

Poland&#x27;s main industries are mining, machinery (cars, buses, ships), metallurgy, chemicals, electrical goods, textiles, and food processing. The high-technology and IT sectors are also growing with the help of investors such as Google, Toshiba, Dell, GE, LG, and Sharp. Poland is a producer of many electronic devices and components.

===Slovakia===

The smallest, but still considerably powerful V4 economy is that of Slovakia (GDP of US$209.186 billion total, 68th in the world).

==Demographics==
The population is 64,301,710 inhabitants, which would rank 22nd largest in the world and 4th in Europe (similar in size to France, Italy or the UK) if V4 were a single country. The most populated country in the group is Poland (38 million), followed by the Czech Republic (~11 million), Hungary (~10 million), and Slovakia (5.5 million).

===V4 capitals===
* Warsaw (Poland) – 1,790,658 inhabitants (metro – 3,105,883)
* Budapest (Hungary) – 1,779,361 inhabitants (metro – 3,303,786)
* Prague (Czech Republic) – 1,318,688 inhabitants (metro – 2,647,308)
* Bratislava (Slovakia) – 432,801 inhabitants (metro – 659,578)

==Current leaders==
==Initiatives==
=== International Visegrád Fund ===
The International Visegrád Fund (IVF) is the only institutionalized form of regional cooperation of the Visegrád Group countries.

The main aim of the fund is to strengthen the ties among people and institutions in Central and Eastern Europe through giving support to regional non-governmental initiatives.

===Defence cooperation===
====Visegrád Battlegroup====

On 12 May 2011, Polish Defence Minister Bogdan Klich said that Poland will lead a new EU Battlegroup of the Visegrád Group. The decision was made at the V4 defence ministers&#x27; meeting in Levoča, Slovakia, and the battlegroup became operational and was placed on standby in the first half of 2016. The ministers also agreed that the V4 militaries should hold regular exercises under the auspices of the NATO Response Force, with the first such exercise to be held in Poland in 2013. The battlegroup included members of V4 and Ukraine.
Another V4 EU Battlegroup was formed in the second semester of 2019 (V4 + Croatia) and another will be on standby in the first semester of 2023.

====Other cooperation areas====
On 14 March 2014, in response to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, a pact was signed for a joint military body within the European Union.
Subsequent Action Plan defines these other cooperation areas:
* Defence Planning 
* Joint Training and Exercises
* Joint Procurement and Defence Industry
* Military Education
* Joint Airspace Protection
* Coordination of Positions
* Communication Strategy
&quot;V4 Joint Logistics Support Group Headquarters&quot; (V4 JLSG HQ) was established in 2020 and will reach the full operational capability by the beginning of 2023.

===Visegrád Patent Institute===
Created by an agreement signed in Bratislava on 26 February 2015, the Institute aims at operating as an International Searching Authority (ISA) and International Preliminary Examining Authorities (IPEA) under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) as from 1 July 2016.

==Neighbour relations==
===European Union===
All members of the V4 have been member states of the European Union since the EU&#x27;s enlargement in 2004, and members of the Schengen Area since 2007.

====Austria====

Austria is the Visegrád Group&#x27;s southwestern neighbor. The Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria launched the Slavkov format for the three countries in early 2015. The first meeting in this format took place on 29 January 2015 in Slavkov u Brna (Austerlitz) in the Czech Republic. Petr Drulák, the deputy foreign minister of the Czech Republic, emphasized that the Austerlitz format was not a competitor, but an addition to the Visegrád group, after proposals to enlarge the V4 with Austria and Slovenia were rejected by Hungary.

The leadership of the Freedom Party of Austria, the junior partner in the former Austrian coalition government, has expressed its willingness to closely cooperate with the Visegrád Group. Former Chancellor and leader of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party Sebastian Kurz wanted to act as a bridge builder between the east and the west.

====Germany====
Germany, the Visegrád Group&#x27;s western neighbour, is a key economic partner of the group and vice versa. As of 2018, Germany&#x27;s trade and investment flows with the V4 are greater than with China.

====Romania====
On 24 April 2015, Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia established the Craiova Group. The idea came from Victor Ponta, the then Romanian Prime Minister, who said he was inspired by the Visegrád Group. Greece joined the group in October 2017.

Romania has been invited to participate in the Visegrád Group on previous occasions. However, several incidents, such as the Black March ethnic clashes, made this impossible.

===Non-EU===
Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia border Ukraine on their east. Poland additionally borders Belarus and Russia&#x27;s Kaliningrad Oblast to the northeast. The Czech Republic is fully surrounded by other EU members. Hungary borders Serbia, a candidate for EU accession, in the south.

====Ukraine====

Ukraine, an eastern neighbour of the V4 that is not a member of the EU, is one of largest recipients of the International Visegrád Fund support and receives assistance from the Visegrád Group for its aspirations to European integration. Ukraine joined the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area with the EU and therefore with the V4 in 2016.

The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to tensions within the Visegrád Group with Hungary under Viktor Orban, opposed to harsher sanctions against Russia, while the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland strongly supporting Ukraine. In November 2022, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala stated, “This is not the best of times for the (Visegrád) format, and Hungary&#x27;s different attitudes are significantly influencing and complicating the situation.”

<doc id="32659" wikidata="Q1987925" url="?curid=32659" title="Varney the Vampire">
<text>Varney the Vampire; or, the Feast of Blood is a Victorian-era serialized gothic horror story variously attributed to James Malcolm Rymer and Thomas Peckett Prest. It first appeared in 1845–1847 as a series of weekly cheap pamphlets of the kind then known as &quot;penny dreadfuls&quot;. The author was paid by the typeset line, so when the story was published in book form in 1847, it was of epic length: the original edition ran to 876 double-columned pages and 232 chapters. Altogether it totals nearly 667,000 words.

It is the tale of the vampire Sir Francis Varney, and introduced many of the tropes present in vampire fiction recognizable to modern audiences. It was the first story to refer to sharpened teeth for a vampire, noting: &quot;With a plunge he seizes her neck in his fang-like teeth&quot;.

==Story==
===Setting===
The story has a confused setting. While ostensibly set in the early eighteenth century, there are references to the Napoleonic Wars and other indicators that the story is contemporary to the time of its writing in the mid-nineteenth century. Varney&#x27;s adventures also occur in various locations including London, Bath, Winchester and Naples.

===Human characters===
The plot concerns the troubles that Sir Francis Varney inflicts upon the Bannerworths, a formerly wealthy family driven to ruin by their recently deceased father. Initially the Bannerworths consist of Mrs Bannerworth and her adult children Henry, George, and Flora (George is never mentioned by name after the thirty-sixth chapter). A family friend, Mr Marchdale, lives with the Bannerworths in early chapters. Later, Flora&#x27;s fiancé Charles Holland, his seafaring uncle Admiral Bell, and Bell&#x27;s jovial assistant Jack Pringle also take residence with the Bannerworths.

===Varney===
Though the earliest chapters give the standard motives of blood sustenance for Varney&#x27;s actions toward the family, later ones suggest that Varney is motivated by monetary interests. The story is at times inconsistent and confusing, as if the author did not know whether to make Varney a literal vampire or simply a human who acts like one. Varney bears a strong resemblance to a portrait in Bannerworth Hall, and the implication throughout is that he is actually Marmaduke Bannerworth (or Sir Runnagate Bannerworth; the names are confused throughout the story), but that connection is never clarified. He is portrayed as loathing his condition, and at one point he turns Clara Crofton, a member of another family he terrorizes, into a vampire for revenge.

Over the course of the book, Varney is presented with increasing sympathy as a victim of circumstances. He tries to save himself, but is unable to do so. He ultimately commits suicide by throwing himself into Mount Vesuvius, after having left a written account of his origin with a sympathetic priest. According to Varney, he was cursed with vampirism after he betrayed a royalist to Oliver Cromwell, and subsequently killed his own son accidentally in a fit of anger. He &quot;dies&quot; and is revived several times in the course of his career. This afforded the author a variety of origin stories. In one of these, a medical student named Dr. Chillingworth applies galvanism to Varney&#x27;s hanged corpse and revives him. This sub-plot parallels the earlier story of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; by Mary Shelley and film adaptations which introduce electricity as Dr. Frankenstein&#x27;s means of creating the monster.

==Legacy==
Scholars including A. Asbjørn Jøn have suggested that &quot;Varney&quot; was a major influence on later vampire fiction, including &quot;Dracula&quot; (1897) by Bram Stoker. Many of today&#x27;s standard vampire tropes originated in &quot;Varney&quot;: Varney has fangs, leaves two puncture wounds on the necks of his victims, comes through a window to attack a sleeping maiden, has hypnotic powers, and has superhuman strength. Unlike later fictional vampires, he is able to go about in daylight and has no particular fear of either crosses or garlic. He can eat and drink in human fashion as a form of disguise, but he points out that human food and drink do not agree with him. This is also the first example of the &quot;sympathetic vampire&quot;, a vampire who despises his condition but is nonetheless a slave to it.

== In popular culture ==
The makers of Marvel Comics were influenced by this story. In the Marvel Universe, &quot;Varnae&quot; is the name of the first vampire, created by the people of Atlantis before it sank.

In the thirteenth episode of the 1991 television series &quot;&quot;, Varney treated Dracula (going by Alexander Lucard in the series) from blood poisoning. He was played by Sam Malkin.

In the sixth episode of the TV series &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; (2014), Abraham Van Helsing gives a copy of &quot;Varney the Vampire&quot; to Victor Frankenstein, explaining that the story is more truth than fiction and that the mysterious creature the series&#x27; characters are pursuing is a vampire.

Varney is one of the main characters in &quot;Strange Practice&quot; (2017) and its sequels by Vivian Shaw.

The 2017 film &quot;The Man Who Invented Christmas&quot; shows Charles Dickens reading it at the time that he was developing the supernatural elements of his novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;; however, &quot;Varney&quot; was not published until 1845, and the film&#x27;s action is set in 1843.

In 2021, Varney appears as a character in &quot;Castlevania&quot; season 4, as an alter ego of Death (voiced by Malcolm McDowell), used to operate beneath notice to advance his goals.

== Authorship ==
The story was published by Edward Lloyd, whose policy was not to allow authors to put their name on their published work. Due to this there is disagreement over the authorship of many works published by his company. &quot;Varney the Vampire&quot; is generally considered to have been co-written by James Malcolm Rymer and Thomas Preskett Prest. However, E. F. Bleiler has argued that Rymer is most likely the author due to the differences in how he wrote dialogue compared to Prest. Louis James also considered Rymer the most likely author, citing a piece of the manuscript in his handwriting.

<doc id="32660" wikidata="Q245272" url="?curid=32660" title="V12 engine">
<text>A V12 engine is a twelve-cylinder piston engine where two banks of six cylinders are arranged in a V configuration around a common crankshaft. V12 engines are more common than V10 engines. However, they are less common than V8 engines.

The first V12 engine was built in 1904 for use in racing boats. Due to the balanced nature of the engine and the smooth delivery of power, V12 engines were found in early luxury automobiles, boats, aircraft, and tanks. Aircraft V12 engines reached their apogee during World War II, after which they were mostly replaced by jet engines. In Formula One racing, V12 engines were common during the late 1960s and early 1990s.

Applications of V12 engines in the 21st century have been as marine engines, in railway locomotives, as large stationary power as well as in some European sports and luxury cars.

== Design ==
=== Balance and smoothness ===
Each bank of a V12 engine essentially functions as a straight-six engine, which by itself has perfect primary and secondary engine balance. A four-stroke V12 engine has even firing order at V-angles of 60, 120, or 180 degrees Many V12 engines use a V-angle of 60 degrees between the two banks of cylinders. V12 engines with other V-angles have been produced, sometimes using split crankpins to reduce the unbalanced vibrations. The drawbacks of V12 engines include extra cost, complexity, friction losses, and external size and weight, compared with engines containing fewer cylinders.

At any given time, three of the cylinders in a V12 engine are in their power stroke, which increases the smoothness of the power delivery by eliminating gaps between power pulses.

A V12 engine with a 180 degree V-angle is often called a flat-twelve engine. These are also sometimes called &#x27;boxer twelve&#x27; engines, however this terminology is incorrect for the majority of 180-degree V12 engines, since they use shared crankpins and are therefore not configured as true boxer engines.

Theoretically, the rotating parts of a V12 racing engine could be lighter than a crossplane V8 engine of similar displacement due to the V12 engine not requiring counterweights on the crankshaft or as much inertial mass for the flywheel. In addition, the exhaust system of a V12 engine is much simpler than would be required for a crossplane V8 engine to achieve pulsed exhaust gas tuning. However, the use of V12 engines in motor racing is uncommon in the 21st century.

=== Size and displacement ===
A 60-degree V12 engine is typically narrower than a 90-degree V6 or V8 engine of similar displacement. However, the V12 engine is usually longer than V6 and V8 engines. The added length often makes it difficult to fit a V12 engine into a passenger car, but the length is not typically a problem for trucks and stationary applications. Due to its narrower width, the V12 is common as locomotive, armoured tank, and marine engines. In these applications, the width of the engine is constrained by tight railway clearances or street widths, while the length of the vehicle is more flexible.

In twin-propeller boats, two V12 engines can be narrow enough to sit side by side, while three V12 engines are sometimes used in high-speed three-propeller configurations. Large, fast cruise ships can have six or more V12 engines. In historic piston-engine fighter and bomber aircraft, the long, narrow V12 configuration used in high-performance aircraft made them more streamlined than other engines, particularly the short, wide radial engine.

== Usage in marine vessels ==

The first V-engine (a V-twin design) was built by Daimler in 1889, then the first V8 engine was built by Antoinette in 1903. These were followed by the first V12 engine in 1904, which was built by Putney Motor Works in London for use in racing boats. Known as the &quot;Craig-Dörwald&quot; engine after Putney&#x27;s founding partners, the V12 engine was based on Putney&#x27;s existing two-cylinder engine with a flathead design, a V-angle of 90 degrees and an aluminium crankcase. As in many marine engines, the camshaft could be slid longitudinally to engage a second set of cams, giving valve timing that reversed the engine&#x27;s rotation to achieve astern propulsion. The engine had a displacement of a weight of and developed racing boats, but little is known of its racing achievements.

Two more V12s appeared in the 1909-1910 motor boat racing season. The Lamb Boat &amp; Engine Company in the United States built a engine for the company&#x27;s &#x27;Lamb IV&#x27; boat. The Orleans Motor Company built a massive flathead V12 engine with a power output quoted as &quot;nearly &quot;. In 1914, Panhard built two V12 engines with four valves per cylinder, which were designed for use in racing boats.

Large V12 diesel engines are common in modern cruise ships, which may have up to six such engines. An example of a currently produced V12 marine engine is the &quot;Wärtsilä 46F&quot; engine, where the V12 version has a displacement of and a power output of .

== Usage in airplanes ==
=== 1900s to 1930s ===
Renault introduced the first V12 engine for aircraft with their 90 hp model of 1912. This engine had a V-angle of 60 degrees, air cooling and an intake over exhaust (F-head) valve arrangement. The propeller was driven from the front end of the camshaft, thus spinning the propeller speed at half the speed of a typical crankshaft driven propeller, in order to improve the propeller efficiency. The Renault engine was closely mimicked by the RAF 4 and its derivatives, which was used by various British military aircraft during World War I. The RAF 4 engine had a displacement of , weighed and produced at 1,800 rpm.

In March 1914, a prototype version of the Sunbeam Mohawk V12 engine was unveiled in the United Kingdom, based on the &#x27;Toodles V&#x27; motor racing engine. The production version was rated at at 2,000 rpm, making it the most powerful airplane engine in Great Britain at the outbreak of World War I. During and after World War I, various companies in the United States produced the Liberty L-12 engine. In Austria, the Austro Daimler V12 engines were used by the large flying boats of the Naval Air Force and produced up to . By the end of World War I, V12s were well established in aviation, powering some of the newest and largest fighter and bomber airplanes.

After World War I, many Zeppelins used V12 engines built by Maybach and Daimler. V12 engines powered the first transatlantic crossings by the Curtiss NC flying boats (using four Liberty L-12 engines), the first non-stop transatlantic crossing in a Vickers Vimy (using two Rolls-Royce Eagle engines) and the first transatlantic crossing by an airship in the R-34 class airship (using five Sunbeam Maori engines).

=== 1940s to present ===
V12 engines reached their apogee during World War II with engines such as the British Rolls-Royce Merlin and Rolls-Royce Griffon, the Soviet Klimov VK-107 and Mikulin AM-38, the American Allison V-1710, and the German Daimler-Benz DB 600 and Junkers Jumo. These engines generated about at the beginning of the war and over at their ultimate evolution stage. This rapid increase in power outputs was due to technology such as multi-speed superchargers and high octane fuels, and the V12 layout was commonly adopted due to its low vibrations so that the powerful engines did not tear apart the light airframes of fighters.

The Allied forces used V12 engines with an &quot;upright&quot; design, while many German engines (aside from the BMW VI, which was designed prior to World War II), used an inverted engine design, which had a lower centre of gravity and improved pilot visibility for single-engined designs. The only American-design inverted V12 engine of any type to see even limited service in World War II was the air-cooled Ranger V-770, which was used in aircraft that were only used for training purposes within the United States, such as the Fairchild AT-21 Gunner.

The Rolls-Royce Merlin V12 engine was used in several British aircraft including the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters, and the Avro Lancaster and de Havilland Mosquito bombers. The Hurricane and Spitfire played vital roles in the Battle of Britain. The long, narrow configuration of the V12 contributed to good aerodynamics, while its smoothness allowed its use with relatively light and fragile airframes.

In the United States, the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was produced under license by Packard Motor Car Company, which was used in the P-51 Mustang fighter. This engine was also incorporated into some models of the Curtiss P-40, specifically the P-40F and P-40L. Packard Merlins powered Canadian-built Hurricane, Lancaster, and Mosquito aircraft, as well as the UK-built Spitfire Mark XVI, which was otherwise the same as the Mark IX with its British-built Merlin. The Allison V-1710 was the only liquid-cooled V12 engine designed in the United States that was used on active service during World War II. It was initially used in the P-38 Lightning, but the turbosupercharger system required bulky ductwork and had poor high-altitude performance. In 1943, a version using a more conventional mechanical supercharger began production.

After World War II, V12 engines became generally obsolete in aircraft due to the introduction of turbojet and turboprop engines that had more power for their weight, and fewer complications.

== Usage in automobiles ==

In automobiles, V12 engines are less common than engines with fewer cylinders, due to their size, complexity, and cost. They have been mostly used for expensive sports and luxury cars thanks to their power, smooth operation, and distinctive sound.

=== 1910s ===
One of the earliest recorded uses of V12 engines in automobiles was in October 1913, when a custom-built racing car competed at the Brooklands circuit in the United Kingdom. The car was entered by Louis Coatalen, who was chief engineer of the Sunbeam Motor Car Company. It was named &#x27;Toodles V&#x27; (after Coatalen&#x27;s pet name for his wife) and achieved several speed records in 1913 and 1914. The V12 engine had a displacement of , an aluminum crankcase, iron cylinders with L-shaped combustion chambers, a cam-in-block valvetrain and a V-angle of 60 degrees. Each bank of the engine consisted of two-cylinder blocks with three cylinders each. Valve clearance was set by grinding the relevant parts, the engine lacking any easy means of adjustment. This reflected the intention for the engine to be later used in aircraft since any adjustment method that could go wrong in flight was to be avoided. As initially built, the V12 was rated at at 2,400 rpm and weighed approximately .

Amongst the first production cars to use a V12 engine were the 1915 Packard Twin Six, the 1915 &quot;National&quot; V12 engine and the 1917 Weidely Pathfinder; all of which were built in the United States.

=== 1920s to 1940s ===
During the late 1920s, the number of marques offering V12 engines for their passenger cars increased and peaked in the 1930s. The lack of vibration and sound, inherent smoothness, and increased power were cited as key benefits for V12 engines. Automobile petrol produced in the 1920s and 1930s had lower octane rating, leading to lower engine performance ratings, and vibration isolating engine mounts were rarely fitted to the passenger cars in the 1920s and the early 1930s. Adding more cylinders to the engine was one of several techniques for performance increase.

European passenger cars with V12 engines were:
*Fiat 520 &#x27;Superfiat&#x27; (1921–1922)
*Daimler Double-Six (several models built at different times from 1926 to 1938)
* (1931–1934)
*Hispano-Suiza J12 (1931–1938)
*Maybach Zeppelin DS 7 (1928–1930) and DS 8 (1930–1938)
*Rolls-Royce Phantom III (1936–1939)
*Tatra 80 (1931–1935)

American passenger cars with V12 engines were:
*Auburn V-12 Speedster (1932–1934)
*Cadillac V-12 (1931–1937) 
*Franklin V-12 (1932–1934)
*Lincoln K-series/Model K (1931–1940)
** Custom (1941–1942)
** Continental (1940–1948)
*Lincoln-Zephyr V-12 (1936–1942)
** H-series (1946–1948)
*Packard Twin Six (1916–1923 and 1932)
** Packard 905 (1916–1923)
** Packard Twelve (1933–1939)
*Pierce-Arrow Twelve (1932–1938)
** Pierce Silver Arrow (1933)

The economic hardships caused the Great Depression meant that all American automakers except for Lincoln had discontinued production of V12 engines by the end of the 1930s. Lincoln themselves would cease V12 production in 1948, and no American automaker has built V12 engines since. Improvements in engine design, namely combustion chamber, piston form, fuel delivery system, and such enabled the lighter and cheaper V8 engines to surpass V12 engines in performance.

=== 1945 to 1960s ===

Following the end of the Second World War, the economic austerity and changes in taste in many European countries led to the demise of luxury automobiles with V12 engines in the 1940s and 1950s. Lincoln continued the limited production of luxury cars with V12 engines from 1946 to 1948. The American manufacturers focused on continuously improving V8 engines and their performances through the 1950s, leading to the first &quot;horsepower war&quot; in the 1960s.

In Italy, Enzo Ferrari, who had long admired the V12 engines of Packard, Auto Union, and his former employer Alfa Romeo, introduced his first passenger car, Ferrari 166 Inter, in 1948 and fitted it with Colombo V12 engine. Dissatisfied with the reliability and crudeness of his Ferrari 250 GT, Ferruccio Lamborghini wanted to develop his own passenger cars that were more cultured and more reliable than the cars produced by Ferrari. His first passenger car, a grand tourer, was 350 GT with DOHC engine. Both manufacturers have a long history of producing vehicles with V12 engines, which continues uninterrupted to this day.

Cadillac experimented with V12 engines in 1963 and 1964 as a potential engine option for its first-ever front-wheel-drive car, Cadillac Eldorado. However, Cadillac was unsatisfied with the performance of its V12 engine, having little advantage over the large displacement V8 that was cheaper to enlarge for more power.

=== 1970s to present ===

In Europe, several manufacturers added V12 engines to their line-up, as listed below:
* Jaguar: The Jaguar V12 engine was an all-aluminium SOHC design with displacements of that was produced from 1971 to 1997 in the E-Type, XJS, and XJ. The first application for the engine was a 5.3 litre version used in the Jaguar E-Type Series 3 sports car. 
* BMW: Production of V12 engines began with the BMW M70 SOHC engine introduced in the 1987 E32 7 Series luxury sedan. The engine was also used in the E31 8 Series. The engine was upgraded to a DOHC V12 engine in 2003, then to a turbocharged DOHC V12 engine which has been in production from 2008 to the present in the 7 Series. BMW V12 engines have also been used in several Rolls-Royce models, beginning in 1998 with the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph.
* Mercedes-Benz: The company&#x27;s first V12 engine was the M120, a DOHC engine introduced in the 1991 &quot;Mercedes-Benz 600 SE&quot; luxury sedan. This engine was replaced by a SOHC V12 engine in 1998, then a turbocharged SOHC V12 engine which has been in production for 2003 to the present. Mercedes-Benz V12 engines have also been used in several Maybach models, beginning with the Maybach 57 and 62 in 2002.
* Aston Martin: The 1999 Aston Martin DB7 V12 Vantage used the company&#x27;s first V12 engine, a DOHC design. Variations of this engine were used in the Vanquish, DB9, DBS V12, Rapide, Virage, and V12 Vantage. This engine was replaced by a turbocharged DOHC V12 engine, which was introduced in the Aston Martin DB11 and has been produced from 2016 to the present.
* Audi: The 2008–2012 Q7 SUV was powered by the Audi 6.0 V12 48v TDI engine, which was the first V12 diesel engine used in a production car.

In the United States, no mass-produced V12 engines have been built since the 1940s, with U.S. manufacturers preferring to use large displacement V8 engines instead.

Japanese manufacturers rarely produce engines with large displacements, therefore V12 engines are very rare. The sole Japanese V12 engine is the 1997–2016 Toyota GZ engine, a DOHC design which was used in the Toyota Century limousine.

In China, the 2009 Hongqi HQE limousine, powered by a DOHC V12 engine, is the sole Chinese car to be produced with a V12 engine.

=== List of V12 production engines ===
=== Motor racing ===
V12 engines have often been used in Formula One, particularly from the 1966 season to the 1969 season. The first V12 engine used in Formula One was in the 1964 Honda RA271 racing car, and continued through to the 1968 Honda RA301 racing car. The 1966 season saw V12 engines become popular, with new V12 engines from Ferrari, Maserati, and Weslake. Ferrari&#x27;s engine debuted in the Ferrari 312 racing car and was used up to the 1975 Ferrari 312B, after which Ferrari switched to a flat-twelve engine. Maserati&#x27;s engine was introduced in the Cooper T81 and was used until the 1969 Cooper T86. The Weslake V12 engine was used from 1966 to 1968 and was introduced in the Eagle Mk1 racing car. BRM produced V12 engines from the 1968 BRM P133 racing car until the 1977 BRM P207. The Matra Sports V12 engine was introduced in the 1968 &quot;Matra MS11&quot; racing car and used until the 1978 Ligier JS9. Few V12 engines were used in the following decade, with the exception of the Alfa Romeo V12 which was first used by the 1979 Brabham BT48 and then by Alfa Romeo until the 1982 Alfa Romeo 182.

A resurgence of V12 engines in Formula One began in 1989, with the introduction of the Ferrari 640 racing car. Ferrari continued to use V12 engines until the 1995 Ferrari 412 T2 became the last Formula One car to use a V12 engine. The Lamborghini LE3512 engine was used by various teams between 1989 and 1993. The &quot;Honda RA122-E&quot; engine was first used in the 1991 McLaren MP4/6 and was raced until the 1992 McLaren MP4/7A. The &quot;Yamaha OX99&quot; engine was used in the 1990 Brabham BT59 through to the 1992 Brabham BT60. The most powerful naturally-aspirated V12 engine used in Formula One was the &quot;Tipo 043&quot;, used by Ferrari in , which produced @ 15,800 rpm.

In prototype sports car racing, the highly successful 2006–2008 Audi R10 TDI used a diesel twin-turbo V12 engine. The Peugeot 908 HDi FAP, introduced in 2007, also used a diesel twin-turbo V12 engine.

== Usage in trucks ==
Several truck manufacturers have produced V12 diesel engines at various times. For example, the 1967–1982 Tatra T813, built in Czechoslovakia, used a naturally aspirated V12 diesel engine, and the 1983–present Tatra T815 is available with a V12 diesel engine in both naturally aspirated and turbocharged forms. In the United States, V12 versions of the 1938–1995 Detroit Diesel Series 71, the 1967–1999 Detroit Diesel Series 149 and the 1974–1995 Detroit Diesel Series 92 were produced. In Japan, Isuzu produced naturally aspirated V12 diesel engines from in 1976–2000, for their heavy duty trucks: New Power, 810 and Giga.

Trucks using V12 gasoline (petrol) engines are rare, however several were produced in the United States from the 1930s until the 1970s. In 1931, &quot;American La France&quot; began producing firetrucks with V12 gasoline engines based on the &quot;Lycoming BB motor&quot;. In 1935, the V12 engine used by the Pierce Arrow luxury car was fitted to firetrucks built by Seagrave (with production continuing until 1970, since Seagrave purchased the equipment to manufacture the Pierce Arrow engines themselves). The 1960–1965 GMC Twin Six gasoline V12 engine was basically the &quot;GMC 351&quot; V6 engine, doubled, with four rocker covers and four exhaust manifolds. Peak power was only . However peak torque was .
== Usage in railway locomotives ==
Many diesel locomotives use V12 engines. Examples include the EMD 12-710 and the &quot;GEVO-12&quot; engine (used in the GE ES44AC North American locomotives).

V12 engines used in railway locomotives include:
== Usage in armoured fighting vehicles ==
The V12 is a common engine configuration for tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles. Some examples are:
* German HL120TRM gasoline engine, used on World War II Panzer III, Panzer IV and other tanks based on their chassis. The Maybach HL230 and its variants was used on the Panther, Tiger II, Jagdpanther, Jagdtiger (HL230 P30), then Tiger I and Sturmtiger which used the HL230 P45.
* British Rolls-Royce Meteor petrol engine (derived from the &quot;Rolls-Royce Merlin&quot; aero-engine) used in the World War II Cromwell tank and Comet tank, and later in the Centurion tank and Conqueror tank. The Challenger 2 tank was powered by the &quot;Perkins CV12-6A&quot; diesel engine.
* Soviet Kharkiv model V-2 diesel engine, used in the World War II T-34 tank, Kliment Voroshilov tanks and IS-2 heavy tank. Model V-44 12-cyl. 38.88 L diesel used on the late-war T-44. V-12 diesel engine used on T-72, basically supercharged version of V-2.
* American Continental AV1790 engine, produced in gasoline and diesel variants, used on all versions of the Patton tank and on the M103 heavy tank. A prototype &quot;Chrysler A65&quot; V12 engine was tested in the M4 Sherman tank in 1943, but it did not reach production.
*French Poyaud V12XS25 diesel engine used on the AMX-40. The Maybach HL 295 (reiteration of Maybach HL234, a later version of the Maybach HL230) was also used on the AMX-50 heavy tank.
*Japanese Mitsubishi SA12200VD air-cooled V-12 diesel engine used on the Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank. A Mitsubishi Type 100 air-cooled V-12 diesel was also used on the Type 4 Ho-Ro self-propelled gun.

<text>A V-twin engine, also called a V2 engine, is a two-cylinder piston engine where the cylinders are arranged in a V configuration and share a common crankshaft.

The V-twin is widely associated with motorcycles, primarily installed longitudinally, though also transversely. They are also used in a variety of other land, air, and marine vehicles, as well as industrial applications. The V-twin design dates back to the late 1880s.

==Origins==
One of the first V-twin engines was built by Gottlieb Daimler in 1889. It was used as a stationary engine, for boats and in the Daimler Stahlradwagen (&quot;steel-wheeled car&quot;), Daimler&#x27;s second car. The engine was also manufactured under licence in France by Panhard et Levassor.

An early V-twin engined motorcycle was produced in November 1902 by the Princeps AutoCar Company in the United Kingdom. The following year, V-twin motorcycles were produced by Eclipse Motor &amp; Cycle Co in the United Kingdom (the &quot;XL-ALL&quot; model), Glenn Curtiss in the United States, and NSU Motorenwerke in Germany.

Peugeot, which had used Panhard-built Daimler V-twins in its first cars, began producing its own V-twin engines in the early 20th century. This Peugeot engine powered a Norton motorcycle that won the first Isle of Man TT race in 1907.

==Typical design==
===Crankshaft configuration===

Most V-twin engines have a single crankpin, which is shared by both connecting rods. The connecting rods may sit side-by-side with offset cylinders, or have fork and blade connecting rods which avoids the twisting forces caused by having offset cylinders.

Some notable exceptions include a 180° crank pin offset used by the 1935 Moto Guzzi 500cc, a dual-crankpin configuration used by the 1983 Honda Shadow 750, and the 75° crank pin offset (45° offset in the United States) used by the 1987 Suzuki VX 800.

===V angle===
Although any &#x27;V angle&#x27; (the angle between the two banks of cylinders) between zero and 180 degrees is theoretically possible for a V-twin engine, in practice angles smaller than 40 degrees are rarely used. The most common V angle for a V-twin engine is 90 degrees, which can achieve a perfect primary balance (if the correct counterweight is used) like most Ducatis, most Moto Guzzis, the Honda RC51, Suzuki TL1000S and TL1000R. However, this arrangement results in an uneven firing order, with the second cylinder firing 270 degrees after the first cylinder, then a 450 degrees interval until the first cylinder fires again. 90 degree engines are sometimes called L-twin (like the &quot;L&quot; in TL1000R or TL1000S) rather than V-twin.

The alternating longer and shorter gaps between firings produce a characteristic V-twin alternating engine noise &quot;phutphut phutphut phutphut phutphut&quot;.

When a V angle of less than 90 degrees is used, perfect primary balance can only be achieved if offset crankpins are used. If not, balance shafts are usually required to reduce the vibration. Vehicles which use engines with V angles of less than 90 degrees include:
* 20 degrees: 1889 Daimler Steel-wheel car
* 42 degrees: 1916–1923 Indian Powerplus, 1920–1949 Indian Scout, 1922–1953 Indian Chief

* 55 degrees: 1985–2006 Kawasaki Vulcan 750, 2006–present Kawasaki Vulcan 900 Classic
* 60 degrees: 2001–2017 Harley-Davidson VRSC, 2014–2021 Harley-Davidson Street, 1998–2003 Aprilia RSV Mille, 1988–present Yamaha XV250, 2001–present Yamaha DragStar 250, 2015–present Indian Scout
* 70 degrees: 1982–1983 Yamaha XZ 550, 1988–1998 Suzuki RGV250, 1987–2004 Yamaha Virago 535, 1997–present Yamaha DragStar 650
* 72 degrees: 1974–1989 Moto Morini 350 &amp; 500 V-twins Voxan 1997–2010

* 80 degrees: 1978–1983 Honda CX series, Rotax 810/660/490 engines

Vehicles which use engines with V angles of greater than 90 degrees include the 1934 Moto Guzzi 500cc (120 degrees) and the 1940–1948 Zündapp KS 750 (170 degrees).

==Motorcycles==
As per other motor vehicles, the terms longitudinal engine and transverse engine are most often used to refer to the crankshaft orientation relative to the frame. However, some companies use the opposite terminology, stating that a &quot;transverse&quot; V-twin engine has the cylinders mounted on each side of the motorcycle (therefore with the crankshaft running in line with the frame) and that a &quot;longitudinal&quot; V-twin engine has the cylinders at the front and rear. The latter terminology is used by the Italian manufacturer Moto Guzzi.

To avoid such ambiguity, some people use descriptions of &quot;transverse crankshaft engine&quot;, &quot;longitudinal crankshaft engine&quot;, or &quot;transversely mounted cylinders&quot;.

===Transverse engine===
The most common arrangement is to mount the engine with the crankshaft oriented transversely to the frame. The advantage of this mounting is that the width of the motorcycle can be smaller than a longitudinally-mounted V-twin. A disadvantage of this configuration for air-cooled engines is that the two cylinders receive different air-flows and cooling of the rear cylinder tends to be restricted (although the uneven cooling isn&#x27;t as pronounced as a parallel-twin engine, where the inner faces of the cylinders are not exposed to any airflow). Some transverse V-twins use a single carburettor in the middle of the V-angle to feed both cylinders. While this avoids the need for two carburettors, it creates further cooling problems for the rear cylinder by placing its hot exhaust port and pipe at the back of the cylinder, where it may be exposed to less cooling airflow.

Transverse V-twin engines have been used by Harley-Davidson, Ducati and many recent Japanese motorcycles, such as the Suzuki SV650. Some Ducati V-twin engines have been marketed as &quot;L-twin&quot; engines, due to the front cylinder being vertical and the rear cylinder being horizontal, thus forming an &quot;L&quot; shape.


===Longitudinal engine===
A less common arrangement is to mount the engine longitudinally. An advantage of this arrangement is that both cylinder heads can protrude into the air stream, so they can each receive the same amount of cooling (for air-cooled engines). Also, the transmission being located behind the engine is easier to fit within a typical motorcycle frame and, for shaft-drive motorcycles, a 90° bevel gear is not needed at the start of the driveshaft.

As per all longitudinal engines, a disadvantage is that the torque reaction will twist the motorcycle to one side (such as on sharp acceleration/deceleration or when opening the throttle in neutral) instead of shifting the weight balance between the front and rear wheels. However, many modern motorcycles reduce this effect by rotating flywheels or alternators in the opposite direction to that of the crankshaft.

Longitudinal V-twin engines have been used by the Honda CX series and several Moto Guzzi motorcycles.


==Automobiles==
Most cars are powered by engines with three or more cylinders, however several small cars have been produced with V-twin engines particularly during the period from 1912 to 1920 when cyclecars were made by many companies (due to a favourable tax position). Almost all of these used proprietary engines, either adapting the larger motorcycle engines used for sidecar work (large singles or V-twins), or using engines specifically made for cyclecars such as those made by J. A. Prestwich Industries (&#x27;J.A.P.&#x27; engines) or F. E. Baker Ltd (&#x27;Precision&#x27; engines).

In 1912, Humber produced a light car called the Humberette with a Humber-made V-twin side-valve engine of 998cc. The engine had a directly attached clutch, 3-speed gearbox and prop shaft output to a rear differential. A water cooled version of this engine was made available in 1914, but WW1 ended Humberette production in 1915.

From 1911 to 1939, various Morgan 3-wheelers three-wheeled cyclecar models were powered by V-twin engines. Production of three-wheeler models then resumed with the 2012–present Morgan 3-Wheeler. Also in the United Kingdom, Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) produced several cars powered by their V-twin motorcycle engines. These were produced from 1921 to 1926 (four-wheel models) and 1929–1936 (three-wheel and four-wheel models).

Several manufacturers have produced models inspired by the original Morgan three-wheeled car, such as the 1978–present Triking Cyclecar (using a Moto Guzzi engine), the 2006–present Ace Cycle Car (using a Harley-Davidson engine) and the 1990–present JZR Trikes kit car (using engines from several manufacturers).

Mazda&#x27;s first car, the 1960–1966 Mazda R360 rear-engined kei car, was powered by the Mazda V-twin engine. The 1961–1962 Mazda B360 front-engined light commercial vehicle used a version of this engine.

==Industrial engines==
Various V-twin engines have been produced for industrial uses such as pressure washers, lawn and garden tractors, tillers, generators and water pumps. The engines are usually air-cooled with a 90° V angle. Depending on the application, the engine&#x27;s orientation can have either a horizontal or vertical crankshaft.

Manufacturers of commercial V-twin engines include Briggs &amp; Stratton with its Vanguard, Professional and Intek V-twin series, Honda with its V-twin series engines, Kawasaki with its FD, FH, FR, FS, and FX series, Subaru with its EH series, Tecumseh with its OV691EA and TVT691 engines, and Kohler.

<doc id="32664" wikidata="Q620602" url="?curid=32664" title="Virial theorem">
<text>In mechanics, the virial theorem provides a general equation that relates the average over time of the total kinetic energy of a stable system of discrete particles, bound by a conservative force (where the work done is independent of path), with that of the total potential energy of the system. Mathematically, the theorem states that
formula_1
where is the total kinetic energy of the particles, represents the force on the th particle, which is located at position , and angle brackets represent the average over time of the enclosed quantity. The word virial for the right-hand side of the equation derives from , the Latin word for &quot;force&quot; or &quot;energy&quot;, and was given its technical definition by Rudolf Clausius in 1870.

The significance of the virial theorem is that it allows the average total kinetic energy to be calculated even for very complicated systems that defy an exact solution, such as those considered in statistical mechanics; this average total kinetic energy is related to the temperature of the system by the equipartition theorem. However, the virial theorem does not depend on the notion of temperature and holds even for systems that are not in thermal equilibrium. The virial theorem has been generalized in various ways, most notably to a tensor form.

If the force between any two particles of the system results from a potential energy that is proportional to some power of the interparticle distance , the virial theorem takes the simple form
formula_2

Thus, twice the average total kinetic energy equals times the average total potential energy . Whereas represents the potential energy between two particles of distance , represents the total potential energy of the system, i.e., the sum of the potential energy over all pairs of particles in the system. A common example of such a system is a star held together by its own gravity, where 

== History ==
In 1870, Rudolf Clausius delivered the lecture &quot;On a Mechanical Theorem Applicable to Heat&quot; to the Association for Natural and Medical Sciences of the Lower Rhine, following a 20-year study of thermodynamics. The lecture stated that the mean vis viva of the system is equal to its virial, or that the average kinetic energy is one half of the average potential energy. The virial theorem can be obtained directly from Lagrange&#x27;s identity as applied in classical gravitational dynamics, the original form of which was included in Lagrange&#x27;s &quot;Essay on the Problem of Three Bodies&quot; published in 1772. Carl Jacobi&#x27;s generalization of the identity to &quot;N&quot; bodies and to the present form of Laplace&#x27;s identity closely resembles the classical virial theorem. However, the interpretations leading to the development of the equations were very different, since at the time of development, statistical dynamics had not yet unified the separate studies of thermodynamics and classical dynamics. The theorem was later utilized, popularized, generalized and further developed by James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Rayleigh, Henri Poincaré, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Enrico Fermi, Paul Ledoux, Richard Bader and Eugene Parker. Fritz Zwicky was the first to use the virial theorem to deduce the existence of unseen matter, which is now called dark matter. Richard Bader showed that the charge distribution of a total system can be partitioned into its kinetic and potential energies that obey the virial theorem. As another example of its many applications, the virial theorem has been used to derive the Chandrasekhar limit for the stability of white dwarf stars.

== Illustrative special case ==

Consider particles with equal mass , acted upon by mutually attractive forces. Suppose the particles are at diametrically opposite points of a circular orbit with radius . The velocities are and , which are normal to forces and . The respective magnitudes are fixed at and . The average kinetic energy of the system in an interval of time from to is 
formula_3
Taking center of mass as the origin, the particles have positions and with fixed magnitude . The attractive forces act in opposite directions as positions, so . Applying the centripetal force formula results in
formula_4
as required. Note: If the origin is displaced, then we&#x27;d obtain the same result. This is because the dot product of the displacement with equal and opposite forces , results in net cancellation.

== Statement and derivation ==
Although the virial theorem depends on averaging the total kinetic and potential energies, the presentation here postpones the averaging to the last step.

For a collection of point particles, the scalar moment of inertia about the origin is
formula_5
where and represent the mass and position of the th particle. is the position vector magnitude. Consider the scalar
formula_6
where is the momentum vector of the th particle. Assuming that the masses are constant, is one-half the time derivative of this moment of inertia:
formula_7
In turn, the time derivative of is
formula_8
where is the mass of the th particle, is the net force on that particle, and is the total kinetic energy of the system according to the velocity of each particle,
formula_9

=== Connection with the potential energy between particles ===

The total force on particle is the sum of all the forces from the other particles in the system:
formula_10
where is the force applied by particle on particle . Hence, the virial can be written as
formula_11

Since no particle acts on itself (i.e., for ), we split the sum in terms below and above this diagonal and add them together in pairs:
formula_12
where we have used Newton&#x27;s third law of motion, i.e., (equal and opposite reaction).

It often happens that the forces can be derived from a potential energy that is a function only of the distance between the point particles and . Since the force is the negative gradient of the potential energy, we have in this case
formula_13
which is equal and opposite to , the force applied by particle on particle , as may be confirmed by explicit calculation. Hence,
formula_14

Thus
formula_15

=== Special case of power-law forces ===
In a common special case, the potential energy between two particles is proportional to a power of their distance :
formula_16
where the coefficient and the exponent are constants. In such cases, the virial is
formula_17
where
formula_18
is the total potential energy of the system.

Thus
formula_19

For gravitating systems the exponent equals −1, giving Lagrange&#x27;s identity
formula_20
which was derived by Joseph-Louis Lagrange and extended by Carl Jacobi.

=== Time averaging ===

The average of this derivative over a duration is defined as
formula_21
from which we obtain the exact equation
formula_22

The virial theorem states that if , then
formula_23

There are many reasons why the average of the time derivative might vanish. One often-cited reason applies to stably bound systems, that is, to systems that hang together forever and whose parameters are finite. In this case, velocities and coordinates of the particles of the system have upper and lower limits, so that is bounded between two extremes, and , and the average goes to zero in the limit of infinite :
formula_24

Even if the average of the time derivative of is only approximately zero, the virial theorem holds to the same degree of approximation.

For power-law forces with an exponent , the general equation holds:
formula_25

For gravitational attraction, , and the average kinetic energy equals half of the average negative potential energy:
formula_26

This general result is useful for complex gravitating systems such as planetary systems or galaxies.

A simple application of the virial theorem concerns galaxy clusters. If a region of space is unusually full of galaxies, it is safe to assume that they have been together for a long time, and the virial theorem can be applied. Doppler effect measurements give lower bounds for their relative velocities, and the virial theorem gives a lower bound for the total mass of the cluster, including any dark matter.

If the ergodic hypothesis holds for the system under consideration, the averaging need not be taken over time; an ensemble average can also be taken, with equivalent results.

== In quantum mechanics ==

Although originally derived for classical mechanics, the virial theorem also holds for quantum mechanics, as first shown by Vladimir Fock using the Ehrenfest theorem.

Evaluate the commutator of the Hamiltonian
formula_27
with the position operator and the momentum operator
formula_28
of particle ,
formula_29

Summing over all particles, one finds that for
formula_30
the commutator is
formula_31
where formula_32 is the kinetic energy. The left-hand side of this equation is just , according to the Heisenberg equation of motion. The expectation value of this time derivative vanishes in a stationary state, leading to the quantum virial theorem:
formula_33

=== Pokhozhaev&#x27;s identity ===

In the field of quantum mechanics, there exists another form of the virial theorem, applicable to localized solutions to the stationary nonlinear Schrödinger equation or Klein–Gordon equation, is Pokhozhaev&#x27;s identity, also known as Derrick&#x27;s theorem.
Let formula_34 be continuous and real-valued, with formula_35.

Denote formula_36.
Let
formula_37
be a solution to the equation
formula_38
in the sense of distributions.
Then formula_39 satisfies the relation
formula_40

== In special relativity ==
For a single particle in special relativity, it is not the case that . Instead, it is true that , where is the Lorentz factor
formula_41
and . We have
formula_42
The last expression can be simplified to
formula_43
Thus, under the conditions described in earlier sections (including Newton&#x27;s third law of motion, , despite relativity), the time average for particles with a power law potential is
formula_44
In particular, the ratio of kinetic energy to potential energy is no longer fixed, but necessarily falls into an interval:
formula_45
where the more relativistic systems exhibit the larger ratios.

== Examples ==
The virial theorem has a particularly simple form for periodic motion. It can be used to perform perturbative calculation for nonlinear oscillators.

It can also be used to study motion in a central potential. If the central potential is of the form formula_46, the virial theorem simplifies to formula_47. In particular, for gravitational or electrostatic (Coulomb) attraction, formula_48.

=== Driven damped harmonic oscillator ===

Analysis based on Sivardiere, 1986. For a one-dimensional oscillator with mass formula_49, position formula_50, driving force formula_51, spring constant formula_52, and damping coefficient formula_53, the equation of motion is 
formula_54

When the oscillator has reached a steady state, it performs a stable oscillation formula_55, where formula_56 is the amplitude, and formula_57 is the phase angle.

Applying the virial theorem, we have formula_58, which simplifies to formula_59, where formula_60 is the natural frequency of the oscillator.

To solve the two unknowns, we need another equation. In steady state, the power lost per cycle is equal to the power gained per cycle:
formula_61
which simplifies to formula_62.

Now we have two equations that yield the solution
formula_63

=== Ideal-gas law ===
Consider a container filled with an ideal gas consisting of point masses. The force applied to the point masses is the negative of the forces applied to the wall of the container, which is of the form formula_64, where formula_65 is the unit normal vector pointing outwards. Then the virial theorem states that
formula_66
By the divergence theorem, formula_67. And since the average total kinetic energy formula_68, we have formula_69.

=== Dark matter ===
In 1933, Fritz Zwicky applied the virial theorem to estimate the mass of Coma Cluster, and discovered a discrepancy of mass of about 450, which he explained as due to &quot;dark matter&quot;. He refined the analysis in 1937, finding a discrepancy of about 500.

==== Theoretical analysis ====
He approximated the Coma cluster as a spherical &quot;gas&quot; of formula_70 stars of roughly equal mass formula_49, which gives formula_72. The total gravitational potential energy of the cluster is formula_73, giving formula_74. Assuming the motion of the stars are all the same over a long enough time (ergodicity), formula_75.

Zwicky estimated formula_76 as the gravitational potential of a uniform ball of constant density, giving formula_77.

So by the virial theorem, the total mass of the cluster isformula_78

==== Data ====
Zwickyformula_79 estimated that there are formula_80 galaxies in the cluster, each having observed stellar mass formula_81 (suggested by Hubble), and the cluster has radius formula_82. He also measured the radial velocities of the galaxies by doppler shifts in galactic spectra to be formula_83. Assuming equipartition of kinetic energy, formula_84.

By the virial theorem, the total mass of the cluster should be formula_85. However, the observed mass is formula_86, meaning the total mass is 450 times that of observed mass.

== Generalizations ==

Lord Rayleigh published a generalization of the virial theorem in 1900, which was partially reprinted in 1903. Henri Poincaré proved and applied a form of the virial theorem in 1911 to the problem of formation of the Solar System from a proto-stellar cloud (then known as cosmogony). A variational form of the virial theorem was developed in 1945 by Ledoux. A tensor form of the virial theorem was developed by Parker, Chandrasekhar and Fermi. The following generalization of the virial theorem has been established by Pollard in 1964 for the case of the inverse square law:
formula_87
A &quot;boundary&quot; term otherwise must be added.

== Inclusion of electromagnetic fields ==

The virial theorem can be extended to include electric and magnetic fields. The result is

formula_88

where is the moment of inertia, is the momentum density of the electromagnetic field, is the kinetic energy of the &quot;fluid&quot;, is the random &quot;thermal&quot; energy of the particles, and are the electric and magnetic energy content of the volume considered. Finally, is the fluid-pressure tensor expressed in the local moving coordinate system

formula_89

and is the electromagnetic stress tensor,

formula_90

A plasmoid is a finite configuration of magnetic fields and plasma. With the virial theorem it is easy to see that any such configuration will expand if not contained by external forces. In a finite configuration without pressure-bearing walls or magnetic coils, the surface integral will vanish. Since all the other terms on the right hand side are positive, the acceleration of the moment of inertia will also be positive. It is also easy to estimate the expansion time . If a total mass is confined within a radius , then the moment of inertia is roughly , and the left hand side of the virial theorem is . The terms on the right hand side add up to about , where is the larger of the plasma pressure or the magnetic pressure. Equating these two terms and solving for , we find

formula_91

where is the speed of the ion acoustic wave (or the Alfvén wave, if the magnetic pressure is higher than the plasma pressure). Thus the lifetime of a plasmoid is expected to be on the order of the acoustic (or Alfvén) transit time.

== Relativistic uniform system ==
In case when in the physical system the pressure field, the electromagnetic and gravitational fields are taken into account, as well as the field of particles’ acceleration, the virial theorem is written in the relativistic form as follows:

formula_92

where the value exceeds the kinetic energy of the particles by a factor equal to the Lorentz factor of the particles at the center of the system. Under normal conditions we can assume that , then we can see that in the virial theorem the kinetic energy is related to the potential energy not by the coefficient , but rather by the coefficient close to 0.6. The difference from the classical case arises due to considering the pressure field and the field of particles’ acceleration inside the system, while the derivative of the scalar is not equal to zero and should be considered as the material derivative.

An analysis of the integral theorem of generalized virial makes it possible to find, on the basis of field theory, a formula for the root-mean-square speed of typical particles of a system without using the notion of temperature:

formula_93

where formula_94 is the speed of light, formula_95 is the acceleration field constant, formula_96 is the mass density of particles, formula_97 is the current radius.

Unlike the virial theorem for particles, for the electromagnetic field the virial theorem is written as follows:
formula_98
where the energy formula_99 considered as the kinetic field energy associated with four-current formula_100, and
formula_101
sets the potential field energy found through the components of the electromagnetic tensor.

== In astrophysics ==
The virial theorem is frequently applied in astrophysics, especially relating the gravitational potential energy of a system to its kinetic or thermal energy. Some common virial relations are 
formula_102
for a mass , radius , velocity , and temperature . The constants are Newton&#x27;s constant , the Boltzmann constant , and proton mass . Note that these relations are only approximate, and often the leading numerical factors (e.g. or ) are neglected entirely.

=== Galaxies and cosmology (virial mass and radius) ===

In astronomy, the mass and size of a galaxy (or general overdensity) is often defined in terms of the &quot;virial mass&quot; and &quot;virial radius&quot; respectively. Because galaxies and overdensities in continuous fluids can be highly extended (even to infinity in some models, such as an isothermal sphere), it can be hard to define specific, finite measures of their mass and size. The virial theorem, and related concepts, provide an often convenient means by which to quantify these properties.

In galaxy dynamics, the mass of a galaxy is often inferred by measuring the rotation velocity of its gas and stars, assuming circular Keplerian orbits. Using the virial theorem, the velocity dispersion can be used in a similar way. Taking the kinetic energy (per particle) of the system as , and the potential energy (per particle) as we can write

formula_103

Here formula_104 is the radius at which the velocity dispersion is being measured, and is the mass within that radius. The virial mass and radius are generally defined for the radius at which the velocity dispersion is a maximum, i.e.

formula_105

As numerous approximations have been made, in addition to the approximate nature of these definitions, order-unity proportionality constants are often omitted (as in the above equations). These relations are thus only accurate in an order of magnitude sense, or when used self-consistently.

An alternate definition of the virial mass and radius is often used in cosmology where it is used to refer to the radius of a sphere, centered on a galaxy or a galaxy cluster, within which virial equilibrium holds. Since this radius is difficult to determine observationally, it is often approximated as the radius within which the average density is greater, by a specified factor, than the critical density
formula_106
where is the Hubble parameter and is the gravitational constant. A common choice for the factor is 200, which corresponds roughly to the typical over-density in spherical top-hat collapse (see Virial mass), in which case the virial radius is approximated as
formula_107
The virial mass is then defined relative to this radius as
formula_108

=== Stars ===
The virial theorem is applicable to the cores of stars, by establishing a relation between gravitational potential energy and thermal kinetic energy (i.e. temperature). As stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium in their cores, the mean molecular weight of the core increases and it must contract to maintain enough pressure to support its own weight. This contraction decreases its potential energy and, the virial theorem states, increases its thermal energy. The core temperature increases even as energy is lost, effectively a negative specific heat. This continues beyond the main sequence, unless the core becomes degenerate since that causes the pressure to become independent of temperature and the virial relation with equals −1 no longer holds.

<doc id="32665" wikidata="Q1146822" url="?curid=32665" title="Voice-over">
<text>Voice-over (also known as off-camera or off-stage commentary) is a production technique used in radio, television, filmmaking, theatre, and other media in which a descriptive or expository voice that is not part of the narrative (i.e., non-diegetic) accompanies the pictured or on-site presentation of events. The voice-over is read from a script and may be spoken by someone who appears elsewhere in the production or by a specialist voice actor. Synchronous dialogue, where the voice-over is narrating the action that is taking place at the same time, remains the most common technique in voice-overs. Asynchronous, however, is also used in cinema. It is usually prerecorded and placed over the top of a film or video and commonly used in documentaries or news reports to explain information.

Voice-overs are used in video games and on-hold messages, as well as for announcements and information at events and tourist destinations. It may also be read live for events such as award presentations. Voice-over is added in addition to any existing dialogue and is not to be confused with voice acting or the process of replacing dialogue with a translated version, the latter of which is called dubbing or revoicing.

== History ==
The voice-over industry has evolved significantly since its inception, paralleling developments in technology, entertainment, and advertising. It began in the early days of radio and has since expanded into various media including television, film, video games, and the internet.

=== Early Beginnings (1920s-1930s) ===
Voice-over work began in the 1920s with the advent of radio broadcasting. The industry was primarily driven by radio dramas, comedies, and serials. Actors like Orson Welles were among the pioneers, known for their work on radio shows such as &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air.&quot; The most notable event of this era was the 1938 broadcast of &quot;The War of the Worlds,&quot; directed and narrated by Welles, which famously caused panic among listeners who believed the fictional story to be a real news broadcast.

=== The Golden Age of Radio and the Introduction of Television (1940s-1950s) ===
The 1940s and 1950s are often referred to as the Golden Age of Radio. Voice actors like Mel Blanc, known for his work with Warner Bros. cartoons, became household names. This era also saw the transition from radio to television. Voice-over work expanded to include off-screen narration and character voices in television shows, particularly in animations and commercials.

=== The Rise of Commercials and Dubbing (1960s-1970s) ===
The 1960s and 1970s witnessed a significant increase in the use of voice-overs in commercials. Advertisers began to realize the impact of a strong, persuasive voice in selling products. This period also saw the growth of dubbing foreign films and shows, expanding the global reach of media content.

=== Technological Advancements and the Home Video Revolution (1980s-1990s) ===
With the advent of cable television and home video in the 1980s and 1990s, the demand for voice-over artists surged. The era was marked by the rise of animated shows, video games, and the direct-to-video market. Voice actors like James Earl Jones, known for his work as the voice of Darth Vader in &quot;Star Wars,&quot; and Frank Welker, known for his work in cartoons and films, became prominent.

=== The Internet Age and the Democratization of Voice-Overs (2000s-Present) ===
The turn of the millennium brought about drastic changes with the proliferation of the internet. Platforms like YouTube and the advent of podcasting opened up new avenues for voice-over work. Home recording technology and high-speed internet made it possible for voice-over artists to work remotely, democratizing the industry. Voice-over websites and online casting services have made it easier for artists to find work and for producers to find talent.

== Career in voice-over ==
To become a voice actor, significant training is required. The important factors to being a voice actor are technique, genres, and work. It is recommended to hire an acting coach and voice coach to help hone skills for recording a voice-over. There are many pieces of equipment that are also required to start a career in voice-overs. A computer, professional microphone, and an editing program, along with a studio to set up in, are all requirements to develop a professional voice-over. Careers in voice-over often allow people to work at home. 

To audition for a voice-over role, people often record a demo-reel, which is a compilation of someone&#x27;s works in voice acting. A demo-reel is important to have for someone looking for a job in voice acting because many auditions ask for one. To find casting auditions, there are many online websites that can allow people to sign up for auditions. For an audition, people should study the target audience, warm up and try to arrive early so they can prepare and have the best chance at getting the role. The audition is begun with slating. Slating is a practice where the person going for the audition states their name and then says Take 1, Take 2, Take 3. After slating, the auditionee then reads the copy given to them by the casting team.

In Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1956), Ishmael (Richard Basehart) narrates the story, and he sometimes comments on the action in voice-over, as does Joe Gillis (William Holden) in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950) and Eric Erickson (William Holden) in &quot;The Counterfeit Traitor&quot; (1962); adult Pip (John Mills) in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946) and Michael York in its 1974 television remake.

Voice-over technique is likewise used to give voices and personalities to animated characters. Noteworthy and versatile voice actors include Mel Blanc, Daws Butler, Don Messick, Paul Frees, and June Foray. Charactering techniques in voice-overs are used to give personalities and voice to fictional characters. There has been some controversy with charactering techniques in voice-overs, particularly with white radio entertainers mimicking AAVE.

In the late 1920s, radio started to stray away from reporting exclusively on musicals and sporting events; instead, radio began to create serial talk shows as well as shows with fictional story lines. Radio became the ideal medium for voice impersonations.

===Creative device===
In film, the filmmaker distributes the sound of a human voice (or voices) over images shown on the screen that may or may not be related to the words that are being spoken. Consequently, voice-overs are sometimes used to create ironic counterpoint. Also, sometimes they can be random voices not directly connected to the people seen on the screen. In works of fiction, the voice-over is often by a character reflecting on his or her past, or by a person external to the story who usually has a more complete knowledge of the events in the film than the other characters.

Voice-overs are often used to create the effect of storytelling by a character/omniscient narrator. For example, in &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, the character of Roger &quot;Verbal&quot; Kint has voice-over segments as he is recounting details of a crime. Classic voice-overs in cinema history can be heard in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;The Naked City&quot;.

Sometimes, voice-over can be used to aid continuity in edited versions of films, in order for the audience to gain a better understanding of what has gone on between scenes. This was done when the film &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1948) starring Ingrid Bergman turned out to be far from the box-office and critical hit that was expected and it was edited down from 145 minutes to 100 minutes for its second run in theaters. The edited version, which circulated for years, used narration to conceal the fact that large chunks of the film had been cut out. In the full-length version, restored in 1998 and released on DVD in 2004, the voice-over narration is heard only at the beginning of the film.

Film noir is especially associated with the voice-over technique. The golden age of first-person narration was during the 1940s. Film noir typically used male voice-over narration but there are a few rare female voice-overs.

In radio, voice-overs are an integral part of the creation of the radio program. The voice-over artist might be used to entice listeners of the station name or as characters to enhance or develop show content. During the 1980s, the British broadcasters Steve Wright and Kenny Everett used voice-over artists to create a virtual &quot;posse&quot; or studio crew who contributed to the programmes. It is believed that this principle was in play long before that time. The American radio broadcaster Howard Stern has also used voice-overs in this way.

===Educational or descriptive device===
The voice-over has many applications in non-fiction as well. Television news is often presented as a series of video clips of newsworthy events, with voice-over by the reporters describing the significance of the scenes being presented; these are interspersed with straight video of the news anchors describing stories for which video is not shown.

Television networks such as The History Channel and the Discovery Channel make extensive use of voice-overs. On NBC, the television show &quot;Starting Over&quot; used Sylvia Villagran as the voice-over narrator to tell a story.

Live sports broadcasts are usually shown as extensive voice-overs by sports commentators over video of the sporting event.

Game shows formerly made extensive use of voice-overs to introduce contestants and describe available or awarded prizes, but this technique has diminished as shows have moved toward predominantly cash prizes. The most prolific have included Don Pardo, Johnny Olson, John Harlan, Jay Stewart, Gene Wood and Johnny Gilbert.

Voice-over commentary by a leading critic, historian, or by the production personnel themselves is often a prominent feature of the release of feature films or documentaries on DVDs.

===Commercial device===
The commercial use of voice-over in television advertising has been popular since the beginning of radio broadcasting.

In the early years, before effective sound recording and mixing, announcements were produced &quot;live&quot; and at-once in a studio with the entire cast, crew and, usually, orchestra. A corporate sponsor hired a producer, who hired writers and voice actors to perform comedy or drama.

Manufacturers will often use a distinctive voice to help them with brand messaging, often retaining talent to a long-term exclusive contract.

The industry expanded very rapidly with the advent of television in the 1950s, and the age of highly produced serial radio shows ended. The ability to record high-quality sound on magnetic tape also created opportunities. Digital recording, thanks to the proliferation of PCs, smartphones (iOS and Android 5.0+), dedicated recording devices, free or inexpensive recording and editing software, and USB microphones of reasonable quality, and the increasing use of home studios, has revolutionized the industry.

The sound recording industry uses the term &quot;presence&quot; as the standard of a good quality voice-over and is used for commercial purposes in particular. The term &quot;presence&quot; measures the legitimacy of how a voice sounds, specifically one of a voice-over. Advances in technology for sound recording have helped voice-overs reach that standard. These technological advances have increasingly diminished &quot;the noise of the system...and thus reducing the distance perceived between the object and its representation.&quot;

===Translation===
In some countries, such as Russia, Ukraine and Poland, voice-over provided by an artist is commonly used on television programs as a language localization technique, as an alternative to full dub localization.

In Bulgaria, multiple voice-over is also common, but each film (or episode) is normally voiced by three to six actors. The voice artists try to match the original voice and preserve the intonation. The main reason for the use of this type of translation is that unlike synchronized voice translation, it takes a relatively short time to produce, since there is no need to synchronize the voices with the character&#x27;s lip movements, which is compensated by the quieted original audio. When there is no speaking in the film for some time, the original sound is turned up. Recently, as more films are distributed with separate voice and noises-and-music tracks, some voice-over translations in Bulgaria are produced by only turning down the voice track, in this way not affecting the other sounds. One actor always reads the translation crew&#x27;s names over the show&#x27;s ending credits (except for when there is dialogue over the credits).

<doc id="32668" wikidata="Q170209" url="?curid=32668" title="Vincenzo Bellini">
<text>Vincenzo Salvatore Carmelo Francesco Bellini (; ; 3 November 1801 – 23 September 1835) was an Italian opera composer famed for his long, graceful melodies and evocative musical settings. A central figure of the era, he was admired not only by the public, but also by many composers who were influenced by his work. His songs balanced florid embellishment with a deceptively simple approach to lyric setting.

Born to a musical family in Sicily, he distinguished himself early and earned a scholarship to study under several noted musicians at Naples&#x27; Real Collegio di Musica. There he absorbed elements of the Neapolitan School&#x27;s style and was inspired by performances of Donizetti&#x27;s and Rossini&#x27;s operas, among others, in more modern idioms. He wrote his first opera, &quot;Adelson e Salvini&quot; (1825), for the conservatory, and his next, &quot;Bianca e Fernando&quot; (1826), on a Teatro di San Carlo-affiliated commission for promising students. He also became close friends with his peer and first biographer, Francesco Florimo.

Bellini then went to Milan to compose for La Scala, where the success of &quot;Il pirata&quot; (1827) established his short but significant career. He wrote many celebrated operas, ascending to triumphal heights with &quot;I Capuleti e i Montecchi&quot; (1830, La Fenice), &quot;La sonnambula&quot; (1831, Teatro Carcano), and more gradually &quot;Norma&quot; (1831, La Scala). He traveled abroad and wrote &quot;I puritani&quot; after a visit to London. Its successful premiere (1835, Théâtre-Italien) capped an illustrious international career. Bellini died at the age of 33 in Puteaux, France.

Verdi praised Bellini&#x27;s expansive melodies as unequaled, while Wagner, who was rarely complimentary, was captivated by Bellini&#x27;s expressive integration of music and text. Liszt and Chopin were also admirers, though Berlioz was less enthusiastic. Most musicologists now assess Bellini positively, though some question the quality of his work. Many of his operas, including &quot;Pirata&quot;, &quot;Capuleti&quot;, &quot;Sonnambula&quot;, &quot;Norma&quot;, and &quot;Puritani&quot; are regularly performed at major opera houses throughout the world.

==Catania: early life==

Born in Catania, at the time part of the Kingdom of Sicily, the eldest of seven children in the family, he became a child prodigy within a highly musical family. His grandfather, , had studied at the conservatory in Naples and, in Catania from 1767 forward, had been an organist and teacher, as had Vincenzo&#x27;s father, Rosario.

An anonymous twelve-page hand-written history, held in Catania&#x27;s Museo Civico Belliniano, states that he could sing an aria by Valentino Fioravanti at eighteen months, that he began studying music theory at two years of age and the piano at three. By the age of five, he could apparently play &quot;marvelously&quot;. The document states that Bellini&#x27;s first five pieces were composed when he was just six years old and &quot;at seven he was taught Latin, modern languages, rhetoric, and philosophy&quot;. Bellini&#x27;s biographer Herbert Weinstock regards some of these accounts as no more than myths, not being supported from other, more reliable sources. Additionally, he makes the point in regard to Bellini&#x27;s apparent knowledge of languages and philosophy: &quot;Bellini never became a well-educated man&quot;.

Another biographer, Stelios Galatopoulos, discusses the information presented in the précis and accepts some of the evidence for early compositions but expresses skepticism regarding the young Bellini&#x27;s child prodigy status. He mentions that Bellini never became a &quot;proficient&quot; piano player and, when he later went to the music conservatory in Naples at an age well past that required for admission and took an examination in which his compositions were assessed, he was placed in the beginners&#x27; class.

After 1816, Bellini began living with his grandfather, from whom he received his first music lessons. Soon after, the young composer began to write compositions. Among them were the nine &quot;Versetti da cantarsi il Venerdi Santo&quot;, eight of which were based on texts by Metastasio.

By 1818 Bellini had independently completed several additional orchestral pieces and at least two settings of the Mass Ordinary: one in D Major, the other in G Major, both of which survive and have been commercially recorded.

He was ready for further study. For well-off students, this would include moving to Naples. While his family wasn&#x27;t wealthy enough to support that lifestyle, Bellini&#x27;s growing reputation could not be overlooked. His break came when Stefano Notabartolo, the duca di San Martino e Montalbo and his duchess, became the new intendente of the province of Catania. They encouraged the young man to petition the city fathers for a stipend to support his musical studies. This was successfully achieved in May 1819 with unanimous agreement for a four-year pension to allow him to study at the Real Collegio di Musica di San Sebastiano in Naples. Thus, he left Catania in July carrying letters of introduction to several powerful individuals, including Giovanni Carafa who was the &quot;intendente&quot; of the Real Collegio as well as being in charge of the city&#x27;s royal theatres. The young Bellini was to live in Naples for the following eight years.

==Naples: musical education==

The Conservatorio di San Sebastiano (as it had been named when the original Real Collegio di Musica, established in 1806 and then renamed as such in 1808) had moved to more spacious facilities close to the church of Gesù Novo and the building formerly occupied by the nuns of San Sabastiano, was run by the government and there, students, who wore a semi-military uniform, were obliged to live under a tight daily regimen of classes in principal subjects, in singing and instrumental coaching, plus basic education. Their days were long, going from early morning mass at 5:15 am to finally ending by 10 pm. Although beyond the normal age for admission, Bellini had submitted ten pieces of music for consideration; these clearly demonstrated his talent, although he did need to do remedial work to correct some of his faulty technique.

The focus of study was on the masters of the Neapolitan school and the orchestral works of Haydn and Mozart, with the emphasis put upon the Italian classical era composers such as Pergolesi and Paisiello, rather than the &quot;modern-day&quot; approaches of composers such as Rossini. The young student&#x27;s first teacher was Giovanni Furno, with whom &quot;he studied exercises in harmony and accompaniment&quot;; another, from whom he learned counterpoint, was the composer of over 50 operas, Giacomo Tritto, but whom he found to be &quot;old fashioned and doctrinaire&quot;. However, the artistic director of the school was the opera composer, Niccolò Antonio Zingarelli.

By 1822/23, Bellini had become a member of a class which he taught: the older man appears to have recognised Bellini&#x27;s potential and treated his student like a son, giving him some firm advice:
If your compositions &quot;sing&quot;, your music will most certainly please. ... Therefore, if you train your heart to give you melody and then you set it forth as simply as possible, your success will be assured. You will become a composer. Otherwise, you will end up being a good organist in some village.

It was during these early years at the Collegio that Bellini met Francesco Florimo with whom he had a lifetime of correspondence. Other fellow students—who were to become opera composers—included Francesco Stabile and the Ricci brothers—Luigi and Federico—as well as Saverio Mercadante who, by this time, was a graduate student.

Another person to whom the young student/composer was introduced was Gaetano Donizetti whose ninth opera—which had been a great success in Rome—was given at the Teatro di San Carlo. About 50 years later, Florimo gave an account of the meeting of the two men: &quot;Carlo Conti [one of Bellini&#x27;s tutors] said to Bellini and me, &quot;Go and hear Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;La zingara&quot;, for which my admiration increases at every performance.&quot; After hearing the opera, Bellini acquired the score, convinced Conti to introduce him, and [Florimo] reports that Bellini&#x27;s reaction was that he was &quot;a truly beautiful, big man, and his noble countenance—sweet, but at the same time majestic—arouses affection as well as respect.&quot;

=== First Naples compositions ===
Increasingly, Bellini did better and better in his studies: in January 1820 he passed his examinations in theory, and was successful enough to gain an annual scholarship, which meant that his stipend from Catania could be used to help his family. In the following January he was equally successful and, to fulfill his obligations to write music for Catania – a condition of his scholarship – he sent a &quot;Messa di Gloria&quot; in A Minor for soloists, choir and orchestra, which was performed the following October.

Besides this melodious work, his output from these study years in Naples included two other settings of the Mass: a full Ordinary in E Minor and a second full Ordinary in G Minor, both of which probably date from 1823. There are two settings of the &quot;Salve Regina&quot; (one in A Major for solo soprano and organ, the other in F Minor for choir and orchestra), but these are less accomplished and may date from the first year of study after leaving Catania, 1820. His brief two-movement Oboe Concerto in E-flat from 1823 also survives and has been recorded by no less than the Berlin Philharmonic.

Bellini&#x27;s involvement in Zingarelli&#x27;s class took place over the 1822/23 school year. By January 1824, after passing examinations in which he did well, he attained the title &quot;primo maestrino&quot;, requiring him to tutor younger students and allowing him a room of his own in the &quot;collegio&quot; and visits to the Teatro di San Carlo on Thursdays and Sundays, where he saw his first opera by Rossini, &quot;Semiramide&quot;. While Weinstock gives an account of how he was &quot;clearly captivated by the music of Rossini [and] put Rossini on a pedestal&quot;, he relates that, returning from &quot;Semiramide&quot; Bellini was unusually quiet and then &quot;suddenly exclaimed to his companions, &#x27;Do you know what I think? After &quot;Semiramide&quot;, it&#x27;s futile for us to try and achieve anything!&#x27;&quot;

But a tougher challenge confronted the young composer: how to win the hand of young Maddalena Fumarolis, whom he had met as a guest in her home and to whom he had become music tutor. As their affair became obvious to her parents, they were forbidden to see each other. Bellini was determined to obtain the parents&#x27; permission for them to marry, and some writers regard this as the propelling reason for his writing his first opera.

=== &quot;Adelson e Salvini&quot; ===

The impetus to write this opera came about in late summer of 1824, when his &quot;primo maestrino&quot; status at the conservatory resulted in an assignment to compose an opera for presentation in the institute&#x27;s &quot;teatrino&quot;. This became &quot;Adelson e Salvini&quot;, an &quot;opera semi-seria&quot; (half-serious) to a libretto by the Neapolitan Andrea Leone Tottola, who had written the one for Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;La zingara&quot;. &quot;Adelson&quot; was first given sometime between mid-January and mid-March 1825, and featured an all-male cast of fellow students. It proved to be so popular among the student body that it was performed every Sunday for a year.

With that achievement behind him, it is believed that the young Bellini, who had been away from home for six years, set out for Catania to visit his family. However, some sources attribute the visit to 1824, others to 1825. However, it is known that he was back in Naples by the summer or early autumn of 1825 in order to fulfill a contract to write an opera for the San Carlo or one of the other royal theatres, the Teatro Fondo.

==Beginnings of a career==
Following the presentation of &quot;Adelson e Salvini&quot; and while he was in Milan, Bellini—requesting help from Florimo—began to make some revisions, shortening the opera to two acts in the hope that it might be given stagings by Domenico Barbaja, the Intendant at the Teato di San Carlo since 1809. But little is known about exactly how much Bellini or Florimo contributed to the revisions, and Weinstock asserts that no performances were ever given after 1825, but in March 1829, we find Bellini writing to Florimo that &quot;I have written you the changes that you should make in &quot;Adelson&quot; &quot;.

In the summer or early autumn of 1825 Bellini began work on what was to become his first professionally produced opera. A contract between the Conservatory and the royal theatres obliged the Conservatory—when it nominated a sufficiently talented student—to require that student to write a cantata or one-act opera to be presented on a gala evening in one of the theatres. After Zingarelli used his influence to secure this honour for his promising student, Bellini was able to obtain agreement that he could write a full-length opera and, furthermore, that the libretto did not have to be written by Tottola, the theatres&#x27; official dramatic poet. However, as Intendant of the San Carlo, &quot;Barbaja was the chief beneficiary: &#x27;With a small investment he found among those young men the one who would lead him to large profits&#x27;&quot; notes Florimo.

=== &quot;Bianca e Gernando&quot; ===
The young composer chose Domenico Gilardoni, a young writer who then prepared his first libretto, which he named &quot;Bianca e Fernando&quot;, based on an 1820 play, &quot;Bianca e Fernando alla tomba di Carlo IV, Duca d&#x27;Agrigento&quot; and set in Sicily.

However, the title &quot;Bianca e Fernando&quot; had to be changed, because Ferdinando was the name of the heir to the throne, and no form of it could be used on a royal stage. After some delays caused by King Francesco I forcing postponement, the opera—now named &quot;Bianca e Gernando&quot;—was given its premiere performance at the Teatro di San Carlo on 30 May 1826, Prince Ferdinando&#x27;s name day.

It was very successful, helped by the approval of the King, who broke the custom of there being no applause at a performance attended by royalty. It was also attended by Donizetti who enthusiastically wrote to Simon Mayr: &quot;It is beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, especially as it is his first opera.&quot; Bellini&#x27;s music was highly regarded, with the &quot;Giornale delle Due Sicilie&quot; on 13 June noting that &quot;[several of the arias and duets] are some of the most laudable pieces of new music heard in recent times at the [San Carlo].&quot; However, there were reservations about Gilardoni&#x27;s contribution.

Within nine months, in February/March 1827, Domenico Barbaja offered Bellini a commission for an opera to be presented in the autumn of 1827 at La Scala in Milan, of which between 1821 and 1832, Barbaja was also part of the management.

==Northern Italy==
Bellini spent 1827 to 1833 mostly in Milan, never holding any official position within an opera company and living solely from the income produced from his compositions, for which he was able to ask higher than usual fees.

Upon his arrival, he met Antonio Villa of La Scala and composer Saverio Mercadante whose new opera, &quot;Il Montanaro&quot; was in rehearsal. The latter introduced him to Francesco and Marianna Pollini (an older couple, the husband a retired professor of piano, the wife a better-than-amateur musician) who immediately took the young man under their wing.
In addition, Bellini was introduced to the librettist Felice Romani, who proposed the subject of the composer&#x27;s first project, &quot;Il pirata&quot;, to which the young man willingly agreed especially when he realised that the story &quot;provided several passionate and dramatic situations.. [and]..that such Romantic characters were then an innovation on the operatic stage.&quot; A strong professional relationship with Romani began from that time; he became Bellini&#x27;s primary creative partner, providing the libretti for six of Bellini&#x27;s operas which followed, in addition to about 100 libretti written for the major composers of the day, up to and including Verdi. As has been observed, &quot;no other Italian opera composer of the time showed such an attachment to a single librettist&quot; and although Romani was known to treat composers poorly, he evidently had great respect for Bellini, even acceding to his requests for revisions. For his part, Bellini admired &quot;the sonorous and elegance of the poet&#x27;s verses&quot;

While in Milan, &quot;[Bellini] quickly gained an entrée into higher social circles&quot;, although he also stayed for months at a time with friends, the Cantù and the Turina families. It was with Giuditta Turina that he began an affair in 1828 during the premiere performances of &quot;Bianca e Fernando&quot; in Genoa.

The four years in Northern Italy between 1827 and 1831 produced four great masterpieces, &quot;Il pirata&quot;, &quot;I Capuleti e i Montecchi&quot;, &quot;La sonnambula&quot;, and &quot;Norma&quot;, along with a revival and a setback.

=== &quot;Il pirata&quot; for Milan ===
The collaboration with Romani on &quot;Il pirata&quot; began in May 1827 and, by August, the music was being written. By then, the composer was aware that he was to write music for his favourite tenor Giovanni Battista Rubini and the soprano was to be Henriette Méric-Lalande. Both singers had starred in &quot;Bianca&quot; in the original 1826 production. The strong cast also included Antonio Tamburini, a major bass-baritone of the time. But rehearsals did not progress without some difficulties, as both Weinstock and Galatopoulos recount: it appears that Bellini found Rubini, while singing beautifully, to be lacking expressiveness: he was urged to &quot;throw yourself with all your soul into the character you are representing&quot; and to use [your] body, &quot;to accompany your singing with gestures&quot;, as well as to act with [your] voice. It appears that Bellini&#x27;s exhortations bore fruit, based on his own account of the audience&#x27;s reactions to the first performance, as well as the reaction of the &quot;Gazzetta privilegiata di Milano&quot; of 2 December which noted that this opera &quot;introduced us to Rubini&#x27;s dual personality as a singer and actor&quot;. The reviewer continued to declare that this duality had never been expressed in other operas in which he had performed.

The premiere, given on 17 October 1827, was &quot;an immediate and then an increasing, success. By Sunday, December 2, when the season ended, it had been sung to fifteen full houses&quot;. For Rubini, &quot;it marked the defining performance for the tenor&quot;, and the newspaper reviews which followed all agreed with the composer&#x27;s own assessment.

After its Milanese debut, the opera received very successful performances in Vienna in February 1828 and also in Naples three months later. Both productions starred Rubini, Tamburini, and—in the role of Imogene—Rubini&#x27;s wife, Adelaide Comelli-Rubini, about whom Bellini had initial misgivings, although it appears that she acquitted herself very well. By this time, Bellini had begun to achieve international fame.

=== &quot;Bianca&quot; revised ===
After &quot;Il pirata&quot;, Bellini remained in Milan with the hope of securing another commission. One came from Genoa via Bartolomeo Merelli on 13 January 1828 for a new opera for presentation on 7 April. However, without knowing which singers would be engaged, he was unwilling to commit at that time, but remained in hope of something definite from La Scala for the autumn. When no alternatives appeared, he accepted Genoa&#x27;s offer in February, but it was then too late to write anything new. He immediately proposed a revival and re-working of &quot;Bianca e Gernando&quot;, this time with the original title &quot;Bianca e Fernando&quot;, there being no royal by the name of Fernando in the House of Savoy. Romani wrote to Florimo in Naples and told him that he had taken on the re-construction of the libretto, with the result that &quot;out of the whole of &quot;Bianca&quot;, the only pieces entirely unchanged are the big duet and the &quot;romanza&quot;; everything else is altered, and about half of it is new&quot;, Bellini then re-arranged the music to suit the singers&#x27; voices, now knowing that the Bianca was to be Adelaide Tosi and the Fernando to be Giovanni David.

As Bellini reports, he had problems with Tosi wanting changes to be made to a &quot;cavatina&quot; and a &quot;stretta&quot; in one scene, but he stuck to his own opinion, proving to be correct when he reported the audience&#x27;s reaction to Florimo: &quot;the public was very happy with the entire opera, particularly with the second act&quot;. Overall, the first performance was even greater than it had been in Naples, and the opera was given a total of 21 times. However, critical reaction was not as positive as that of the audience: &quot;The second act is a long bore&quot; stated &quot;L&#x27;Eco di Milano&quot;, although the &quot;Gazzetta di Genova&quot; was more helpful, noting &quot;the more we listen to the style of the music, the more we appreciate its merit&quot;.

=== After &quot;Bianca&quot; ===
Bellini remained in Genoa until 30 April and then returned to Milan, but with no specific opportunity in place. His initial opposition to Comelli-Rubini being allowed to reprise the role of Imogene in &quot;Il pirata&quot; for performances in Naples (as she had done in Vienna—but successfully) was proved to be wrong, since she did sing well there and received general approval. But this issue had caused complications in his relationship with Barbaja, who controlled both theatres, and when he visited Milan in June, he offered Bellini the opportunity to choose between Naples and Milan as the venue for his next opera. For the composer, the decision hung on the availability of singers for each of the houses, especially because Rubini was contracted to sing only in Naples. However, by 16 June, he had decided on the location to be Milan, and then signed a contract to write a new opera for the Carnival season for a fee of one thousands ducati, compared to 150 ducati for his first opera.

=== &quot;La straniera&quot; for Milan ===

For &quot;La straniera&quot;, Bellini received a fee which was sufficient for him to be able to make his living solely by composing music, and this new work became an even greater success than &quot;Il pirata&quot; had been. As for singers, it appears there was some doubt about the tenor, but that Henriette Méric-Lalande, Luigi Lablache (or Tamburini), would be available. In consultation with Romani as to the subject, it was agreed that it would be based on the novel &quot;L&#x27;étrangère&quot; (&quot;Il solitario&quot;) of 1825 by Charles-Victor Prévot, vicomte d&#x27;Arlincourt, and planned for the premiere on the opening night of the season on 26 December.

However, by 20 September, Bellini told Florimo that he did not think the performance could take place as scheduled due to Romani being ill. In addition, he was concerned about who would sing the tenor role when he had been unable to obtain Rubini&#x27;s release from his Naples contract. Berardo Calvari (known as Winter) was rejected because audiences had disliked him the previous July when he appeared in both a Pacini and a Donizetti opera at La Scala. Fortunately, having received good reports of the young tenor Domenico Reina, he was able to secure his services, describing him in a letter to Florimo as &quot;one who will want to do himself honour; everyone tells me that his voice is beautiful, and that he has all the acting and spirit one could wish for.&quot;

Following Romani&#x27;s recovery, the delivery of the libretto arrived piecemeal, but Bellini set to work again; progress was slow. By 7 January 1829, with Romani having recovered and set off for Venice to fulfill a contract, the composer was &quot;almost up to the 2nd act&quot;. Filippo Cicconetti, in his 1859 biography, gives an account of Bellini&#x27;s working methods, explaining how he set texts to music always with the words in front of him in order to see how inspired to compose he might become. When it came time to compose the final aria &quot;Or sei pago, ol ciel tremendo&quot;, the librettist&#x27;s words gave him no inspiration at all and, at their next meeting, Romani agreed to re-write the text. Returning within half an hour, the second version left Bellini equally cold—as did a third draft. Finally, when asked what it was that he was seeking, Bellini replied: &quot;I want a thought that will be at one and the same time a prayer, an imprecation, a warning, a delirium ...&quot;. A fourth draft was quickly prepared: &quot;Have I entered into your spirit?&quot; asked the librettist—and he was embraced by the young composer.

Rehearsals began in early January with the premiere planned for 14 February 1829; it was an immediate and resounding success with the &quot;Gazzetta privilegiata di Milano&quot; on 16 February declaring it to be a:
clamorous success..[with] the poet [serving] the composer well, and the composer could not have served the singers better; all competed to render themselves pleasing to the public, and succeeded in such a way as to be applauded greatly.

Three days later, the same publication praised the quality of the music, describing Bellini as &quot;a modern Orpheus&quot; for the beauty of his melodies. Reporting to Romani, who was still in Venice, Bellini gave an account of the success: &quot;the thing went as we never had imagined it. We were in seventh heaven. With [this letter] receive my gratitude more than ever ...&quot; Others wrote equally enthusiastic reports, with abundant praise being given to the singers as well. However, there were detractors who criticised both the opera and its composer: its new style and its restless harmonic shifts into remote keys did not please all. 45 years later it was stated that &quot;Bellini&#x27;s style was abstruse, discontinuous, distorted, and lacking in distinction, that it alternated among the &quot;serio&quot; and the &quot;buffo&quot; and the &quot;semi-serio&quot;...&quot;

=== &quot;Zaira&quot;: a setback in Parma ===
&quot;Zaira&quot; was the opera which came into being following discussions with Barbaja in Milan in June 1828 for a second opera for La Scala. At around the same time, Bellini reported to Florimo that he had been approached by Merelli about writing an inaugural opera for the soon-to-be completed Teatro Ducale (now the Teatro Regio) in Parma which was due to open during the following year on 12 May 1829. Initially, the opera was to be &quot;Carlo di Borgogna&quot;, but composer and librettist decided to tackle &quot;a drama so ... hallowed as Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Zaïre&quot;&quot;, but this proved to be more challenging for Romani than first imagined.

With this opera, Bellini encountered &quot;the first serious setback of a hitherto brilliant career&quot;. Several reasons have been put forward: Lippmann and McGuire note, it was because &quot;Bellini showed too little enthusiasm for the undertaking&quot;. Another writer attributes it to Parma&#x27;s traditional love of and favouritism towards the music of Rossini, while yet another notes that a combination of the composer being constantly seen in cafes around the city (when it was assumed that he should have been composing) and the fact that Romani had included a long explanation of the difficulties of adapting Voltaire in the printed libretto provided to all operagoers. The librettist was critical of his own work: &quot;the style should have been more careful, and that here and there, certain repetitions of phrases and concepts should have been edited out&quot;. At the same time, he stated that, with music composed to those verses now in place, &quot;I was not permitted to go back over what already had been done; and poetry and music were finished in less than a month&quot;. This short period of time compares to the months which, for example, it took Bellini to write &quot;Il pirata&quot;.

In fact, Bellini arrived in Parma on 17 March giving him 56 days before the opening, but he then learned that some of the singers would only arrive 14 days before the date of the premiere, a date that was—in theory— unchangeable. In fact, it had to be changed due to the inability of Lalande to arrive in time for sufficient rehearsal. Both composer and librettist were somewhat dilatory, delaying work as much and as long as possible. Count Sanvitale&#x27;s request on 17 April, asking &quot;to let me know the reasons why our copyists are kept idle&quot;, did not receive much of response to satisfy the theatre&#x27;s management. Eventually, both men got down to work and finished on time, although the premiere was delayed by four days.

The general impression given by reports in the press was that, overall, the music was weak, although some numbers and the trio were liked. However, for the most part, the singers were applauded, even if the composer received little. The opera received eight performances, followed by some poorly received ones in Florence in 1836, and then it disappeared until 1976.

==Major achievements==
After the poor response in Parma to &quot;Zaira&quot;, Bellini stayed with Ferdinando and Giuditta Turina&#x27;s family for a short period in May/June and then returned to Milan by the end of June and discovered that his grandfather, then 85, had died in Catania. No contract for another opera in sight, except for the possibility of working with the Teatro La Fenice in Venice. As is revealed by Herbert Weinstock, there is limited knowledge of what happened to Bellini between June 1833 and February 1834, since no letters to Florimo from that period have survived, and the only sources are those letters sent to others.

Giovanni Pacini, another Catanese composer, was still in Milan in late June after the well-received premiere on 10 June of his opera &quot;Il Talismano&quot; at La Scala, where it went on to receive a total of 16 performances. To Bellini, he appeared to be a rival, and with his recent success, Pacini received offers to compose an opera for both Turin and Venice for the Carnival season. He accepted both offers, but the La Fenice impresario included a proviso that if he were to be unable to fulfill the Venice contract, then it would be transferred to Bellini.

Bellini then became preoccupied with staging a revival of his &quot;Il pirata&quot; during the summer season at the Teatro Canobbiana because La Scala was closed for repairs. &quot;Il Pirata&quot; was staged with the original cast and again was a triumph: it received 24 consecutive performances between 16 July and 23 August 1829, thus outnumbering Pacini&#x27;s.

During July and August, the composer Gioachino Rossini visited Milan on his way to Bologna. He saw the &quot;Il Pirata&quot; production and met Bellini; the two men were taken with each other, to the extent that when the younger composer was in Paris a year or two later, he developed a very strong bond with Rossini.

A firm offer of a contract for a new opera for Venice appeared in the autumn, a contract which also included a provision that &quot;Il pirata&quot; would be given during the Carnival 1830 season. Tearing himself away from dalliances with Mrs. Turina, by mid-December Bellini was in Venice where Giuseppe Persiani&#x27;s &quot;Constantino in Arles&quot; was in rehearsal with the same singers who were to perform in &quot;Pirata&quot;: they were Giuditta Grisi, the tenor Lorenzo Bonfigli, and Giulio Pellegrini.

===&quot;I Capuleti e i Montecchi&quot;: Venice, March 1830===

With rehearsals for &quot;Pirata&quot; underway in late December, Bellini was given notice by the La Fenice impresario, Alessandro Lanari, that it was doubtful whether Pacini would be present in time to stage an opera and that a contract was to be prepared with the proviso that it would only become effective on 14 January. Accepting the offer 5 January, Bellini stated that he would set Romani&#x27;s libretto for &quot;Giulietta Capellio&quot;, that he required 45 days between receipt of the libretto and the first performance, and that he would accept 325 napoleoni d&#x27;oro (about 8,000 lire).

The tentative contract deadline was extended until 20 January, but by that date Romani was in Venice, having already re-worked much of his earlier libretto which he had written for Nicola Vaccai&#x27;s 1825 opera, &quot;Giulietta e Romeo&quot;, the source for which was the play of the same name by Luigi Scevola which had been written in 1818. The two men set to work, but with the winter weather in Venice becoming increasingly bad, Bellini fell ill; however, he had to continue to work under great pressure within a now-limited timetable. Eventually, revisions to Romani&#x27;s libretto were agreed to, a new title was given to the work, and Bellini reviewed his score of &quot;Zaira&quot; to see how some of the music could be set to the new text, but composing the part of Romeo for Grisi. He also took Giulietta&#x27;s &quot;Oh quante volte&quot; and Nelly&#x27;s &quot;romanza&quot; from &quot;Adelson e Salvini&quot;. The Giulietta was to be sung by Rosalbina Caradori-Allan.

At the premiere of &quot;I Capuleti e i Montecchi&quot; on 11 March 1830 success for Bellini returned. Weinstock describes the premiere as &quot;an unclouded and immediate success&quot; but it was only able to be performed eight times before the La Fenice season closed on 21 March. A local newspaper, &quot;I Teatri&quot;, reported that &quot;all things considered, this opera by Bellini has aroused as much enthusiasm in Venice as &quot;La straniera&quot; aroused in Milan from the first evening on&quot;.

By this time, Bellini knew that he had achieved a degree of fame: writing on 28 March, he stated that &quot;My style is now heard in the most important theatres in the world ... and with the greatest enthusiasm.&quot;

Before leaving Venice, Bellini was offered a contract to produce another new opera for La Fenice for the 1830–31 Carnival season, and—upon his return to Milan after a reunion with Turina—he also found an offer from Genoa for a new opera but proposed for the same time period, an offer he was forced to reject.

Later that year, Bellini prepared a version of &quot;Capuleti&quot; for La Scala which was given on 26 December, lowering Giulietta&#x27;s part for the mezzo-soprano Amalia Schütz Oldosi.

===&quot;La sonnambula&quot;: Milan, March 1831===

Returning to Milan after the &quot;Capuleti&quot; performances, little occurred until the latter part of April when changes began to appear in the management of La Scala. The organisation, &quot;Crivelli and Company&quot; which had managed both that house as well as La Fenice, was negotiating with a triumvirate consisting of Count Pompeo Litta and two businessmen, their immediate concern being the engagement of singers and composers for La Scala. In order to contract with Bellini, he had to be released from his obligation to Venice; this was achieved by Litta buying out the Venice contract. When Bellini laid out his terms for writing for Milan, Litta gave him a very favourable response: &quot;I shall earn almost twice as much as if I had composed for Crivelli [then the Venetian impresario]&quot; he noted in a letter to his uncle.

However, the group led by Duke Litta failed to come to terms with the Crivelli-Lanari-Barbaja group which continued to manage both La Scala and La Fenice. As a result, in the April–May 1830 period, Bellini was able to negotiate a contract with both the Litta group—which was planning performances in a smaller Milan house, the Teatro Carcano—and with the Crivelli group to obtain a contract for an opera for the autumn of 1831 and another for the 1832 Carnival season. These were to become &quot;Norma&quot; for La Scala and &quot;Beatrice di Tenda&quot; for La Fenice.

Bellini then experienced the re-occurrence of an illness which had emerged in Venice due to pressure of work and the bad weather, but which consistently recurred after each opera and which would eventually cause his death. The gastro-enteric condition—which he describes as &quot;a tremendous inflammatory gastric bilious fever&quot;— resulted in his being cared for by Francesco Pollini and his wife at their home because, as Bellini wrote, &quot;he loves me more than a son&quot;.

Having recovered from his illness by the summer, Bellini went to stay near Lake Como. The need to decide on the subject for the following winter&#x27;s opera became pressing, although it had already been agreed that Giuditta Pasta, who had achieved success in the Teatro Carcano in 1829 and 1830 with in several major operas, would be the principal artist. That she owned a house near Como and would be staying there over the summer was the reason that Romani traveled to meet her and Bellini.

====Attempts to create &quot;Ernani&quot;====
By 15 July they had decided on an adaptation of Victor Hugo&#x27;s play, &quot;Hernani&quot;, although Weinstock speculates as to how this decision could have come about. The play&#x27;s political subject matter would have been known to the group and they would certainly know of the strict censorship then in existence in Austrian-controlled Lombardy. In addition, it was uncertain as to whether Pasta was interested in singing a trousers role, that of the protagonist, Ernani. While it seems that all three were in agreement, no further progress was made. Romani, who promised to begin the &quot;Ernani&quot; libretto immediately, went off to write one for what became Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; (which opened the Carcano&#x27;s season in December 1830). Rather than resting, Bellini immediately set off for Bergamo to stage &quot;La straniera&quot;, then went back to the mountains. But, by the end of November, nothing had been achieved in the way of writing either the libretto or the score of &quot;Ernani&quot;.

On 3 January 1831, a letter from Bellini stated: &quot;... I am no longer composing &quot;Ernani&quot; because the subject would have had to undergo some modifications at the hands of the police. ... [Romani] is now writing &quot;La sonnambula, ossia I Due Fidanzati Svizzeri&quot;. ... It must go on stage on 20 February at the latest.&quot;

====&quot;La sonnambula&quot; replaces &quot;Ernani&quot;====
Romani&#x27;s libretto for &quot;La sonnambula&quot; was based on a &quot;ballet-pantomime&quot; by Eugène Scribe and Jean-Pierre Aumer called &quot;La somnambule, ou L&#x27;arrivée d&#x27;un nouveau seigneur&quot;. With its pastoral setting and story, &quot;La sonnambula&quot; was to become another triumphant success during Bellini&#x27;s five years in Milan.

The title role of Amina (the sleepwalker) with its high tessitura is renowned for its difficulty, requiring a complete command of trills and florid technique. It was written for Pasta who has been described as a &quot;soprano sfogato&quot;.
That music which he was beginning to use for &quot;Ernani&quot; was transferred to &quot;La Sonnambula&quot; is not in doubt, and as Weinstein comments, &quot;he was as ready as most other composers of his era to reuse in a new situation musical passages created for a different, earlier one&quot;.

The opera&#x27;s premiere performance took place on 6 March 1831, a little later than the original date, at the Teatro Carcano. Its success was partly due to the differences between Romani&#x27;s earlier libretti and this one, as well as &quot;the accumulation of operatic experience which both [Bellini] and Romani had brought to its creation.&quot; Press reactions were universally positive, as was that of the Russian composer, Mikhail Glinka, who attended and wrote overwhelmingly enthusiastically:
Pasta and Rubini sang with the most evident enthusiasm to support their favourite conductor [&quot;sic&quot;]; the second act the singers themselves wept and carried the audience along with them.

After its premiere, the opera was performed in London on 28 July 1831 at the King&#x27;s Theatre and in New York on 13 November 1835 at the Park Theatre.

During Bellini&#x27;s lifetime, mezzo/contralto Maria Malibran, a daughter of Manuel Garcia and renowned Rosina, made her own version of Amina and was a notable exponent of the role.

===&quot;Norma&quot;: Milan, December 1831===
With &quot;La sonnambula&quot; successfully behind them, Bellini and Romani began to consider the subject of the opera for which they had been contracted by the Crivelli group for a December 1831 premiere at La Scala and which would mark Giuditta Pasta&#x27;s debut at that house. By the summer, they had decided upon &quot;Norma, ossia L&#x27;Infanticidio&quot; which was based on the play of the same name, &quot;Norma, or The Infanticide&quot; by Alexandre Soumet which was being performed in Paris at around that time and which Pasta would have seen.

For the roles of Adalgisa and Pollione, La Scala had engaged Giulia Grisi, the sister of Giuditta, and the well-known tenor Domenico Donzelli, who had made a name for himself with Rossini roles, especially that of Otello. He provided Bellini with precise details of his vocal capabilities which were confirmed by a report which Mercadante also provided. By the end of August it appears that Romani had completed a considerable amount of the libretto, enough at least to allow Bellini to begin work, which he certainly did in the first weeks of September as the verses were supplied. He reported in a letter to Pasta on 1 September:
I hope that you will find this subject to your liking. Romani believes it to be very effective, and precisely because of the all-inclusive character for you, which is that of Norma. He will manipulate the situations so that they will not resemble other subjects at all, and he will retouch, even change, the characters to produce more effect, if need be.
Pasta&#x27;s vocal and dramatic ranges were extensive: that March, she had created the very different Bellini role of Amina, the Swiss village maiden, in &quot;La sonnambula&quot;.

As the year progressed, several things appeared which began to disturb the composer. Firstly, an outbreak of cholera had occurred in Austria in July, and concern about its spread to Italy was real, to the point that, by late September, Bellini was writing to Florimo: &quot;I am composing the opera without any real zeal because I am almost certain that the cholera will arrive in time to close the theatres; but as soon it threatens to come near, I&#x27;ll leave Milan.&quot;

About this time he had received an offer to compose for the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples and, in return, had imposed some harsh terms, totally objecting to the English soprano Marianna Lewis, &quot;a donna who is below mediocrity: does not know how to sing, is a sausage on stage ...&quot; He continues by stressing the need for a good tenor were he to come to Naples and, in a separate letter to be forwarded by Florimo, tells Principe di Ruffano, then the superintendent of the royal theatres, that he doubts that Barbaja would even agree to the fee already offered to him by La Scala, a total of 2,400 ducati, when he would want 3,000 ducati from Naples for all the additional expenses which he would incur. In a post script, Bellini adds an indignant objection to what he has heard about the proposed casting of &quot;Capuleti&quot; in Naples. It is clear that he regards Barbaja as an enemy.

&quot;Norma&quot; was completed by about the end of November. Bellini then had to deal with the issue of piracy in regard to vocal reductions for piano of &quot;La sonnambula&quot; as published by Casa Ricordi. These scores were then fully orchestrated and sold to unsuspecting opera houses as full orchestral scores. This illegal action caused Bellini to publish a notice in major Italian newspapers putting such &quot;pirates&quot; on notice, but Weinstock comments that such attempts to control were not likely to succeed until Italian unification provided laws applicable to the country as a whole.

After rehearsals began on 5 December, Pasta baulked at singing the &quot;Casta diva&quot; in act 1, now one of the most famous arias of the nineteenth century. She felt that it was &quot;ill adapted to her vocal abilities&quot;, but Bellini was able to persuade her to keep trying for a week, after which she adapted to it and confessed her earlier error. At the opening night, the opera was received with what Weinstock describes as &quot;chill indifference&quot;. To Florimo on the night of the premiere, Bellini wrote &quot;Fiasco! Fiasco! Solemn fiasco!&quot; and proceed to tell him of the indifference of the audience and how it affected him.

In addition, in a letter to his uncle on 28 December, Bellini tries to explain the reasons for the reactions. As other commentators have also noted, some problems were innate to the structure and content of the opera, while others were external to it. Bellini discusses the tiredness of the singers (after rehearing the entire second on the day of the premiere) as well as noting how certain numbers failed to please—and failed to please the composer as well! But then he explains that most of the second act was very effective. It appears from the letter that the second evening&#x27;s performance was more successful. Among the external reasons, Bellini cites the adverse reaction caused by the attitudes of both the owner of a journal (and his claque) and also of &quot;a very rich woman&quot;—who Weinstock identifies as Contessa Giulia Samoyloff— who was Pacini&#x27;s mistress. He also notes that on this second evening, the theatre was full.

In all, &quot;Norma&quot; was given 39 performances in its first season at La Scala, and reports from elsewhere, especially those from Bergamo when performances were given there in late 1832, suggested that it was becoming more and more popular. Bellini left Milan for Naples, and then Sicily, on 5 January 1832, but for the first time since 1827, it was a year in which he did not write an opera.

===Naples, Sicily, Bergamo: January to September 1832===

Bellini traveled to Naples, although he may have stopped in Rome to see Giuditta Turina and her brother Gaetano Cantù. However, the sister and brother also went to Naples where Giuditta was finally able to meet Florimo and see the city in which Bellini had triumphed. Within six days, Bellini was in Naples where he remained for six weeks.

During that time he remained busy, spending some time with Turina (who was ill for part of it), visiting the conservatory and meeting with many of the students and his old teacher, Zingarelli (to whom he had dedicated &quot;Norma&quot;), and attending a performance of &quot;Capuleti&quot; at the San Carlo with Turina and Florimo on 5 February in the presence of King Ferdinand II. The King led the applause for the composer, resulting in his being called to the stage and thus enjoying a very warm welcome from the people of Naples.

Planning to leave Naples by 25 February, he dealt with the invitation from Lanari at La Fenice to compose for that house by stating that he would not work for less than the sum received from the last production, and that he was also in discussions with the San Carlo. Arriving in Messina along with Florimo on the morning of 27 February, Bellini was greeted by several members of his family including his father. They remained in Messina for two days, attending a performance of &quot;Il pirata&quot; at the Teatro della Munizione, where he was greeted with &quot;loud shouts of pleasure, hand-clapping, and words of praise&quot;.

Bellini arrived in Catania on 3 March to a civic welcome. He was greeted by the city&#x27;s authorities and citizens who also feted him at a concert the following evening. This included excerpts from &quot;La sonnambula&quot; and &quot;Il pirata&quot; at the Teatro Communale, now replaced by the Teatro Massimo Bellini which was opened in 1890 and named in Bellini&#x27;s honour. After a month, Bellini and Florimo left for Palermo where, once again, there was a &quot;royal welcome&quot; and where he made the acquaintance of Filippo Santocanale and his wife. Although weather delayed their departure for Naples, they continued to spend an enjoyable time there, but Bellini was anxious to return to Naples before Easter and to be with Giuditta Turina, who had remained in that city. They reached Naples on 25 April where he was reunited with Turina.

Upon his arrival, Bellini wrote to his new friend Santocanale in Palermo, telling him that he would be accepting a contract from La Fenice so the issue had resurfaced in the form of a contract from Lanari which appeared to have accepted the composer&#x27;s terms. But he had forgotten how much he had demanded: writing to Giuditta Pasta&#x27;s husband, Giuseppe, he asked for the letter he had written to him (in which he had revealed the terms offered) to be sent to him to await his arrival in Florence.

When returning to Naples, the couple reached Rome on 30 April. There is speculation that, when there, Bellini composed a one-act opera, &quot;Il fu ed il sarà&quot; (&quot;The Past and the Present&quot;) for a private performance (which was supposedly not given until 1832), but little further information—nor any of the music—has been forthcoming. It appears that the couple (along with Giuditta&#x27;s brother) left for Florence on or around 20 May traveling by private coach and that he attended what he described as &quot;a quite unrecognisable&quot; performance of &quot;La sonnumbula&quot; at the Teatro della Pergola. In the same letter, Bellini informed his publisher that: &quot;I have arranged the contract with Lanari to compose the opera for Venice; there I&#x27;ll have the divine Pasta, and on the same terms as the contract with La Scala for &quot;Norma&quot;&quot;. He continues by stating that, in addition, he will receive one hundred per cent of the rental rights of the scores.

Within a few days, Bellini was in Milan, from there writing to his friend Santocanale in Palermo that &quot;I&#x27;m ... trying to find a good subject for my new opera for Venice. In August, I shall go to Bergamo for the production of my &quot;Norma&quot; with Pasta.&quot; From Bergamo, he wrote to Romani, excited to tell him that:
Our &quot;Norma&quot; is decidedly a great success. If you heard how it&#x27;s performed in Bergamo, you&#x27;d almost think that it was a new work ... [Pasta] even moves me. In fact, I wept [with] the emotions I felt in my soul. I wanted you near me so that I could have these emotions with you, my good advisor and collaborator, because you alone understand me. My glory is intrinsic to yours.

After the successful production in Bergamo, which was favourably reviewed by the same writer from the &quot;Gazzetta privilegiata di Milano&quot; who was not enthusiastic about the original Milan production, Bellini spent a few days with Turina, and then, by mid-September, had returned to Milan anxious to meet Romani to decide on the subject for the following February&#x27;s opera for La Fenice for which a contract had become official. In addition, it had been agreed that the new opera would be preceded by performances of &quot;Norma&quot; and that they would open the season.

===&quot;Beatrice di Tenda&quot;: Venice 1833===
&quot;Beatrice di Tenda&quot;, with the leading role requiring a strong female character to be written for Pasta, composer and librettist met to consider a subject. Much of the initial work fell upon Romani, who had to look at a number of possible sources, and he became irritated by the task, finally hoping that a shipment of books from Paris would reveal a suitable one. It appears that by 6 October, a subject had been agreed upon: it would be &quot;Cristina regina di Svenzia&quot; from a play by Alexandre Dumas which had appeared in Paris in 1830. However, by one month later, Bellini was writing to Pasta to state that: &quot;The subject has been changed, and we&#x27;ll write &quot;Beatrice di Tenda&quot; [after the play of the same name by Carlo Tedaldi-Fores.] I had a hard time persuading Romani, but persuade him I did, and with good reasons. Knowing that the subject pleases you, as you told me the evening when you saw the ballet [in September 1832 in Milan when it accompanied a Mercadante opera] ... He is a man of good will, and I want him to show it also in wanting to prepare at least the first act for me swiftly.&quot;

Bellini&#x27;s expectation that Romani&#x27;s good will would be demonstrated promptly, turned out to be a mistake. The librettist had vastly over-committed himself: by the time that &quot;Cristina&quot; became &quot;Beatrice&quot;, he had made commitments to Mercadante for an October opera; also to Carlo Coccia for an opera for La Scala on 14 February 1833; and further, to Luigi Majocchi for a Parma production on 26 February; to Mercadante for La Scala on 10 March; and to Donizetti for Florence on 17 March. Nothing happened in November; Bellini announced that he would arrive in Venice in early December and after 10th, he became preoccupied with rehearsals for &quot;Norma&quot;. However, the lack of any verses—for an opera which was supposed to be staged in the second half of February—caused him to have to take action against Romani. This involved a complaint lodged with the governor of Venice who then contacted the governor of Milan, who then had his police contact Romani. The librettist finally arrived in Venice on 1 January 1833. He holed up to write Bellini&#x27;s libretto, but, at the same time, Donizetti was equally incensed at delays in receiving a libretto from Romani for an opera which was to be &quot;Parisina&quot;.

When &quot;Norma&quot; opened on 26 December, it was a success but only because of Pasta. The Adalgisa of Anna Del Serre and the Pollione of Alberico Curioni were mediocre; Bellini feared for how &quot;Beatrice&quot; would turn out. Writing to Santocanale on 12 January, Bellini was in despair, complaining of the short time to write his opera because &quot;Whose fault is that? that of my usual and original poet, the God of Sloth!&quot; Their relationship quickly began to deteriorate: greetings including &quot;tu&quot; (the informal &quot;you&quot;) gave way to &quot;voi&quot; (the formal &quot;you&quot;) and they lived in different parts of Venice. However, by 14 February, Bellini was reporting that he had only &quot;another three pieces of the opera to do&quot; and that &quot;I hope to go onstage here on 6 March if I am able to finish the opera and prepare it.&quot;

As it turned out, Bellini was only able to prepare the opera for rehearsals by deleting sections of the libretto as well as some of the music for the finale. To create more time for Bellini to finish, at La Fenice Lanari padded the programme with older works or revivals, but that allowed only eight days for &quot;Beatrice&quot; before the scheduled end of the season. Not surprisingly, the audience greeted the opening night on 16 March with little enthusiasm, especially after Romani&#x27;s plea for &quot;the reader&#x27;s full indulgence&quot; appeared in the libretto, but at the following two performances there was a large crowd. For Bellini, his opera &quot;was not unworthy of her sisters&quot;.

===The break with Romani===

There then began what Herbert Weinstock describes in over twelve pages of text, which include the long letters written by both sides in the dispute:
The journalistic storm over &quot;Beatrice di Tenda&quot; was about to evolve into the bitterest, most convoluted, and—at our distance from it—most amusing polemic in the annals of early nineteenth-century Italian opera.
Three days before the premiere, the Venetian daily, the &quot;Gazzetta privilegiata di Venezia&quot;, had published a letter purportedly written to its editor by &#x27;A.B.&#x27; of Fonzaso, in Weinstein&#x27;s view most certainly fabricated by Tommaso Locatelli, the musically sophisticated man who edited the paper. In the letter, he complained about the delay in the production of &quot;Beatrice&quot; as the end of the season became closer.

Weinstock assumes that it is Locatelli who replied to &quot;A.B.&quot;, asserting that Bellini and Romani were trying to achieve perfection before taking the opera to London. Then a torrent of anti-&quot;Beatrice&quot; letters appeared after the first performance, followed by a pro-Bellini reply, signed &quot;A friend of M. Bellini&quot;. This letter removes the blame from Bellini and lays it at the feet of Romani, outlining the timetable for the delivery of the libretto, which was contracted to be due in two parts: one in October and then the second in November. The author states that, except for a limited amount of text, nothing had been received by mid-January and the piece continues by describing the legal proceedings taken by Bellini and the various setbacks which occurred even after Romani arrived in Venice. On 2 April, this provoked a response from Romani himself, presenting his case against Bellini based largely on the composer&#x27;s inability to decide on a subject, as well as justifying all the work which he did after arriving in Venice, only to find his &quot;melodramma&quot; &quot;touched up in a thousand ways&quot;, in order to make it acceptable to &quot;the Milords of the Thames [who] await him&quot;, a sarcastic reference to planned trip to London. Another, a more &quot;venomous&quot; version of this letter, was sent to Milan&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Eco&quot;.

&quot;Pietro Marinetti&quot; replied from the pro-Bellini camp in the Milan journal, &quot;Il Barbiere di Siviglia&quot; on 11 April. In &quot;Two Words for Signor Felice Romani&quot; [but which takes five pages in print], he states that it is not his intention to defend the composer but &quot;only to vent my displeasure given me and all sensitive people by the very sarcastic manner, full of personal rancor and hauteur, with which Signor Romani has undertaken to assail his antagonist.&quot; Not unexpectedly, a further &quot;cannonade&quot; (says Weinstock) appeared from Romani, published this time in &quot;L&#x27;Eco&quot; on 12 April 1833 with both an editor&#x27;s preface, decrying the poor taste displayed by both sides, and a brief final response from Marinetti.

====The relationship begins to be repaired====
Having been invited to write a new opera for the San Carlo for the 1834–35 Carnival season, but declined because of his Paris commitment, he stated that May 1835 might be possible when he knew who were to be the contracted singers. Florimo immediately began to try to persuade his friend, indicating that Malibran had been engaged for Naples in January 1835. Continuing his letter to Florimo, he states:
why the Management ... doesn&#x27;t make a contract with Romani; not just for one libretto, but by the year ... with the understanding that he come to live in Naples; thus he could write the libretto for me as the only poet attached to the theatre, and if they want to negotiate with him, they can commission me to arrange it; I&#x27;d like to return good for evil to that wrongheaded and very talented man ...

From that statement of March 1834, it does not appear that animosity still existed on the composer&#x27;s part. Through an intermediary, Bordesi (or Bordese), a mutual friend of both men, Romani initially expressed interest in re-establishing friendly relations with Bellini. Thus, Bellini wrote back to the intermediary stating: &quot;Tell my dear Romani that I still love him even though he is a cruel man&quot; and he continues by wondering if Romani ever thinks about him where he, Bellini, says &quot;whereas I do nothing but to talk about him to the entire universe&quot;. Then he ends with: &quot;Give him a kiss for me&quot;. This was followed by a letter to Florimo in late May where Bellini wishes to know if Romani reciprocated his feelings, which—it appears—did happen when he writes to Romani himself (most likely expansion of the initial draft) laying out a series of concerns, but quoting back to him a part of his own letter to Bordese in which Romani states &quot;I have not ceased to love him [Bellini], for I recognise that the blame is not all his&quot;.

In conclusion, Bellini suggests &quot;draw[ing] a veil over everything that happened&quot;, stating that he cannot come to Milan at this time but, since he was planning to write the opera for Naples for 1836, he could do so in January [1835: presumably after &quot;I puritani&quot;]. He ends by saying that, if he does not hear back from Romani, he will not write to him again. Little is known about Romani&#x27;s reply, but reply he did, as indicated in Bellini&#x27;s letter to Florimo in October followed by a very friendly one on 7 October 1834 to the librettist (who had been engaged in Turin) and in which he states: &quot;It seemed impossible to exist without you&quot;, closing with &quot;Write for Turin or for wherever, write , for your Bellini&quot;.

Within a year of writing that letter, Bellini was dead. The two men never did meet again.

==London: April to August 1833==

After leaving Venice on 26 March, before the barrage of letter-writing began, it is known that Bellini spent some time with Mrs. Turina in Milan and, leaving many of his personal possessions with her, appears to have planned to return there by August since he did not give up his rooms in the contrade dei Tre Monasteri.

With the Pasta and other members of the Italian troupe contracted for London by the impresario of the King&#x27;s Theatre, Pierre-François Laporte, Bellini and his troupe set off. On the journey it is known that he stopped in Paris and discussed with Dr. Louis Véron, the director of the Paris Opéra, the possibility of writing a French opera, but his intention was to focus on that subject on his return in the coming July.

As Weinstock notes, when the Italians arrived in London by 27 April, Bellini was a known factor, many of his operas having already been given over the previous few years. His name is listed as an attendee in the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; of 29 April at a performance of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;, along with those of Maria Malibran, Felix Mendelssohn, Niccolò Paganini, as well as Pasta, Rubini, and other visiting Italian singers. His operas which had been presented in London included &quot;Il pirata&quot; (with Henriette Méric-Lalande in April 1830) followed by &quot;La sonnambula&quot; (with Pasta) and &quot;La straniera&quot; (with Giuditta Grisi).

In addition—and separate from Bellini&#x27;s troupe at the King&#x27;s Theatre—Maria Malibran was about to present her London debut in &quot;La sonnambula&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on 1 May in an English version with &quot;an adapted Bellini score&quot;. It appears that Bellini had his first meeting with Malibran when attending a performance where, as he states:
my music was tortured, torn to shreds. ... Only when Malibran was singing did I recognise my [opera] ... but in the &quot;allegro&quot; of the final scene, and precisely at the words &#x27;Ah! m&#x27;abbraccia&#x27; ... I was the first to shout at the top of my voice: &#x27;Viva, viva, brava, brava,&#x27; and to clap my hands as much as I could. [When he was recognised by the audience, who became more and more enthusiastic, he was called to the stage where he embraced Malibran. He continues:] My emotion was at its climax. I thought I was in Paradise.

As the opera season progressed, Bellini found himself caught up in the social whirl, with invitations coming from all around him. His fame was now secure—&quot;La sonnambula&quot; having established it—and the premiere of &quot;Norma&quot;, given on 21 June with Pasta in the title role, was a triumph according to a long letter which Giuseppe Pasta wrote about the experience and his wife&#x27;s huge success. Additionally, reports in the London press were favourable including the review which appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; of 23 June 1833. It took until late July for &quot;I Capuleti e i Montecchi&quot; to be given its London premiere and his contract was then over, after which he left for Paris by about mid-August.

==Paris: August 1833 to January 1835==

When he arrived in Paris in mid-August 1833, Bellini had intended to stay only about three weeks, the main aim being to continue the negotiations with the Opéra which had begun on his way to London a few months earlier. While there was no agreement with Véron at the Opéra, the Théâtre-Italien made him an offer which, Bellini notes, he accepted because &quot;the pay was richer than what I had received in Italy up to then, though only by a little; then because of so magnificent a company; and finally so as to remain in Paris at others&#x27; expense.&quot;

In fact, Éduard Robert and Carlo Severini of the &quot;Italien&quot; had written to the composer, offering a seat in their theatre during his stay in the city and telling him that Grisi, Unger, and Rubini would be singing &quot;Pirata&quot; in October and &quot;Capuleti&quot; in November. But with no definite arrangements having been made to compose for the Italian house—and Bellini essentially not wishing to proceed with an offer from Turin to stage &quot;Norma&quot;—he settled into a new, small apartment. He wrote to Florimo, telling him about the lodgings and that he had written to Turina not to sell any of his furniture, but to send some of it to him.

Quickly, Bellini entered the fashionable world of the Parisian salon, most importantly that run by the Italian exile Princess Belgiojoso whom he had met in Milan and who &quot;was by far the most overtly political of the salonnières&quot;. Her salon became a meeting place for Italian revolutionaries such as Vincenzo Gioberti, Niccolò Tommaseo, and Camillo Cavour, and it was there that he would have most likely made the acquaintance of Count Carlo Pepoli. Others that Bellini would have met included Victor Hugo, George Sand, Alexandre Dumas pėre, and Heinrich Heine. Among the many musical figures were several Italian such as Michele Carafa and the imposing Luigi Cherubini, then in his seventies.

In terms of musical activity—or lack thereof—Bellini pleaded guilty in the letter to Florimo in March 1834: &quot;If you reflect for a moment that a young man in my position, in London and Paris for the first time, cannot help amusing himself immensely, you will excuse me.&quot; However, in January 1834, he had signed a contract to write a new opera for the Théâtre-Italien which would be presented at the end of the year. At the same time, he had been invited to write a new opera for the San Carlo in Naples for the 1834–35 Carnival season, but declined given the Paris commitment and stated that it might be possible to do so by May 1835 when he knew who were to be the contracted singers. Florimo immediately began to try to persuade his friend to take up this offer, indicating that Malibran had been engaged for Naples in January 1835.

On a professional level, Bellini became very concerned around the middle of April 1834, when he learned that Donizetti would be composing for the Théâtre-Italien during the same season, 1834–35. According to Weinstock, quoting letters sent to Florimo in Italy at around that time (and continuing almost up to the premiere of &quot;I puritani&quot;), Bellini perceived this to be a plot orchestrated by Rossini. In a long, rambling letter of 2,500 words to Florino of 11 March 1834, he expresses his frustrations.

But over a year later and with hindsight—after &quot;Puritani&quot;″s great success which came way ahead of that of Donizetti&#x27;s first work for Paris, &quot;Marin Faliero&quot;—he outlines &quot;the plot which was being hatched against me&quot; and the strategies which he adopted to counter it. These strategies included expanding his contacts with Rossini to secure his growing friendship by continuing to see him on numerous occasions to seek his advice, noting &quot;I have always adored Rossini, and I succeeded, and happily ... [having] tamed Rossini&#x27;s hatred, I no longer was frightened and finished that work of mine which won me so much honour&quot;. In a series of letters to Florimo throughout the year, he wrote of Rossini&#x27;s increasing support, even love: &quot;I hear that he speaks well of me&quot; (4 September 1834); &quot;... if I have Rossini&#x27;s protection, I&#x27;ll be situated very well&quot; (4 November); &quot;The most beautiful is that Rossini loves me very, very, very much&quot; (18 November); and &quot;... my very dear Rossini who now loves me as a son&quot; (21 January 1835, following the dress rehearsal).

However, during the time during which he was composing &quot;Puritani&quot;, Bellini recounted the details of another bout of what he describes as &quot;gastric fever&quot; and which Weinstock describes as &quot;that brief indisposition, which had been recurring almost every year at the onset of warm weather&quot;.

===&quot;I puritani&quot;: January 1834 to January 1835===
Having signed the contract for a new opera, Bellini began to look around for a suitable subject and, in a letter to Florimo of 11 March 1834, he alludes to the opera which was to become &quot;I puritani&quot;, noting: &quot;I am about to lose my mind over the plot of the opera for Paris, as it has been impossible to find a suitable subject for my purpose and adaptable to the company&quot;.

In the same letter he continues by stating that he was working towards finding a subject with the Italian émigré, Count Pepoli, who came from a prominent Bologna family and who had been active in opposition to Austrian rule of Italy, until forced into exile in France and England. Although Pepoli had yet to write for the opera house, he made acquaintance with Bellini at one of the salons both attended. The process of writing the libretto and working with the composer was a struggle (notes Weinstock), added to by a period of illness which Bellini reports, although—on 11 April—he is able to report in a letter to Ferlito that he was well and that &quot;I have chosen the story for my Paris opera; it is of the times of Cromvello [Cromwell], after he had King Charles I of England beheaded.&quot; In his letter, he continues by providing a synopsis, indicating that his favourite singers—Giulia Grisi, Rubini, Tamburini, and Lablache—would be available for the principal roles, and that he would begin to write the music by 15 April if he has received the verses. He also referred to the offer from Naples for April 1836 and noting his financial demands with the questions as to how this might be received.

The chosen source was a play performed in Paris only six months before, &quot;Têtes Rondes et Cavalieres&quot; (&quot;Roundheads and Cavaliers&quot;), written by Jacques-François Ancelot and Joseph Xavier Saintine, which some sources state was based on Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Old Mortality&quot;, while others state that there is no connection. The composer had prepared the way for his librettist by providing him with a scenario of thirty-nine scenes (thus compressing the original drama into manageable proportions), reducing the number of characters from nine to seven and at the same time, giving them names of a more Italianate, singable quality.

Continuing to work on the yet-unnamed &quot;I Puritani&quot;, Bellini moved to Puteaux—&quot;a half an hour by road&quot; from central Paris, as the guest of an English friend, Samuel Levys, &quot;where I hope to complete my opera more carefully&quot;. At some time in the late Spring (specific date unknown) Bellini wrote to Pepoli to remind him that he should bring the first act of the opera with him the following day &quot;so that we can finish discussing the first act, which ... will be interesting, magnificent, and proper poetry for music in spite of you and all your absurd rules ...&quot; At the same time, he lays out one basic rule for the librettist to follow:
Carve into your head in adamantine letters: &quot;The opera must draw tears, terrify people, make them die through singing&quot;

By late June, there had been considerable progress and, in a letter copied into one written to Florimo on 25 July, Bellini writes in reply to Alesandro Lanari, now the director of the Royal Theatres of Naples. Because Lanari had written to him on 10 April 1834 regarding an opera for Naples, Bellini tells him that the first act of &quot;Puritani&quot; is finished and that he expects to complete the opera by September, in order that he may then have time to write for Naples. In this letter to Lanari, the composer lays down some very strict terms, some of which received counter-offers in August, but none of which were accepted by the composer. Finally, Bellini stated that he did not want &quot;to negotiate with anybody until I see what success my opera will have&quot;. This included a proposal from the Opéra-Comique for a new opera for them.)

By September he was writing to Florimo of being able to &quot;polish and re-polish&quot; in the three remaining months before rehearsals and he expresses happiness with Pepoli&#x27;s verses (&quot;a very beautiful trio for the two basses and &quot;La Grisi&quot;&quot;)and by around mid-December he had submitted the score for Rossini&#x27;s approval, with rehearsals planned for late December/early January. The dress rehearsal on 20 January 1835 was attended by many people—&quot;All of high society, all the great artists, and everyone most distinguished in Paris were in the theatre, enthusiastic.&quot;—and the premiere, postponed by two days, took place on 24 January 1835. Bellini&#x27;s ecstatic letter to Florimo which followed recounts the enthusiastic reception of many of the numbers throughout the performance, most especially the second act &quot;stretta&quot; so that, by its end:
The French had all gone mad; there were such noise and such shouts that they themselves were astonished at being so carried away. ... In a word, my dear Florimo, it was an unheard of thing, and since Saturday, Paris has spoken of it in amazement. ... I showed myself to the audience, which shouted as if insane. ... How satisfied I am! [He concludes by noting the success of the singers]: &quot;Lablache sang like a god, Grisi like a little angel, Rubini and Tamburini the same.&quot;
The opera became &quot;the rage of Paris&quot; and was given 17 performances to end the season on 31 March.

==Paris: January to September 1835==

In the immediate aftermath of &quot;I puritani&quot;″s success, Bellini was awarded two honours: the first by King Louis-Philippe, naming him as &quot;chevalier&quot; of the Légion d&#x27;honneur; the second by King Ferdinand II in Naples, awarding him the cross of the &quot;Order of Francesco I&quot;. Bellini then dedicated &quot;I puritiani&quot; &quot;To the Queen of the French&quot;, Queen Marie-Emélie. But from a personal point of view, Bellini expressed his sadness at not having seen Florimo for so long, and there flowed a succession of invitations, then demands that Florimo come to Paris to visit him, but from February to July, Florimo ignored the offers and finally, in a letter to him, Bellini stated: &quot;I&#x27;ll no longer ask for reasons, and I&#x27;ll see you when I see you.&quot; After that, he attempted to persuade his uncle, Vincenzo Ferlito, to visit, but without success.

During the final preparations in 1834 for the staging of &quot;Puritani&quot; and up to its delay into 1835, Bellini had concluded an agreement with Naples to present three operas there—including the re-writing of parts of the music for Malibran—beginning in the following January. All that went by the wayside when the revised score failed to arrive on time, and performances were abandoned and the contract scrapped. Thus, during March, Bellini did nothing, but did attend the final performance of &quot;Puritani&quot; on 31st. On 1 April, he wrote a very lengthy letter to Ferlito laying out the entire history of his life in Paris to date, as well as reviving the old jealousies about Donizetti and Rossini&#x27;s so-called &quot;enmity&quot; toward him. He ended by mentioning that &quot;my future plans are to be able to arrange a contract with the French Grand Opéra and remain in Paris, making it my home for the present.&quot; Additionally, he discusses the prospect of marriage to a young woman who &quot;is not rich, but she has an uncle and aunt who are: if they will give her 200,000 francs, I&#x27;ll marry her&quot;, but remarks that he is in no hurry.

Throughout May, accounts came to him from London of the success of &quot;I puritani&quot; and the failure of a revival of &quot;Norma&quot; (due to the poor performances by both the Adalgisa and Pollione), although later reports of Giulietta Grisi&#x27;s Norma—in contrast to those of Pasta—were not good either, and Bellini was pleased that it was not Grisi who gave the opera in Paris. Over the summer, Bellini&#x27;s general mood was reported to be &quot;dark&quot;: discussion with the Opéra could not proceed until a new director was appointed; &quot;he writes long letters, crowded with projects, ideas, reveries that the hand seems to have trouble restraining&quot;; and, as Weintock concludes, all of these things seem to &quot;inescapably suggest a man deeply disturbed physically, psychologically, or both&quot;.

At one of the literary gatherings which Bellini attended earlier in the year, Bellini met the writer Heinrich Heine. Both men then attended a dinner that summer, at which the writer is reported to have remarked:
You are a genius, Bellini, but you will pay for your great gift with a premature death. All the great geniuses died very young, like Raphael and like Mozart.

The rather superstitious Bellini was horrified. Also, Heine&#x27;s literary portrait of Bellini, which became part of his unfinished novel &quot;Florentinische Nächte&quot; (&quot;Florentine Nights&quot;) published in 1837, emphasized the less-appealing aspects of the composer&#x27;s personality, summing up a description of him as &quot;a sigh in dancing pumps&quot;.

In his last-known letter to Filippo Santocanale Bellini wrote on 16 August, followed by one to Florimo on 2 September. In the latter, he mentions that &quot;for three days I&#x27;ve been slightly disturbed by a diarrhea, but I am better now, and think that it is over.&quot;

===Final illness and death===
It was clear from Bellini&#x27;s reaction to Heine&#x27;s remarks that he did not like Heine. Attempting to reconcile the two men, Madame Joubert, who had attended the summer event, invited both to dinner, along with her friend the Princess Belgiojoso. Bellini failed to appear, instead he sent a note stating that he was too ill. Weinstock reports that the princess sent Doctor Luigi Montallegri to Puteaux. Over a few days, he reported to Carlo Severini of the Théatre-Italien with four notes, the first (on 20 September) stated &quot;no appreciable improvement&quot;. On the following day, Montallegri reported a slight improvement, and on 22nd, the doctor stated that he &quot;hopes to declare him out of danger tomorrow&quot;. However, the fourth note—on 22 September—is far more pessimistic; it reported that it was the thirteenth day of the illness and that Bellini had &quot;passed a very restless night&quot;. And then, during the daytime of the 23rd, Montallegri indicated that there had been what Weinstock describes as &quot;a terrifying convulsion&quot; and that death was close. It appears that Bellini died at around 5 pm on 23 September 1835.

Immediately taking charge of arrangements, Rossini began to plan Bellini&#x27;s funeral and entombment, as well as caring for his estate. He ordered that a post-mortem be performed, following an order which came directly from the King. The distinguished Court-appointed Doctor Dalmas performed the autopsy and reported his findings on the cause of death:
It is evident that Bellini succumbed to an acute inflammation of the colon, compounded by an abscess in the liver. The inflammation of the intestine had produced violent symptoms of dysentery during life.

Rossini then created a committee of Parisian musicians in order to find support for a subscription to build a monument to the dead composer, as well as supporting a funeral mass to be celebrated on 2 October in the chapel of the Hôtel des Invalides.

On 27 September and 3 October, Rossini wrote to Santocanale in Palermo providing very detailed accounts of all that he had done immediately following Bellini&#x27;s death as well as what had taken place on 2 October. Initially, Rossini regarded burial in Père Lachaise Cemetery as a short-term arrangement, not knowing where the final resting place would turn out to be. Despite attempts over many years to have Bellini&#x27;s remains transferred to Catania, that did not take place until 1876, when the casket containing his remains was taken to the cathedral in Catania and reburied. His elaborate now empty tomb in Père Lachaise Cemetery remains and is neighbouring that of Rossini&#x27;s whose bones were also eventually transferred back to Italy.

Of the many tributes which poured forth following Bellini&#x27;s death, one stands out. It was written by Felice Romani and published in Turin on 1 October 1835. In it, he stated:
... Perhaps no composers other than ours, know as well as Bellini the necessity for a close union of music with poetry, dramatic truth, the language of emotions, the proof of expression. ... I sweated for fifteen years to find a Bellini! A single day took him from me!

Today, the Museo Belliniano, housed in the Palazzo Gravina-Cruyllas in Catania—Bellini&#x27;s birthplace—preserves memorabilia and manuscripts. He was commemorated on the front of the Banca d&#x27;Italia 5,000 lire banknote in the 1980s and 90s (before Italy switched to the Euro) with the back showing a scene from the opera &quot;Norma&quot;.

==Bellini, romanticism and melodrama==
When planning the subject of his next opera after La Scala&#x27;s &quot;Il pirata&quot;, Bellini had been invited to write an opera for Parma&#x27;s inauguration of the new Teatro Ducale in early 1829. In the initial contract, Bellini was given power over who was to write the libretto and, after meeting the composer and &quot;prima donna&quot;, the Parman librettist Luigi Torrigiani&#x27;s work had been rejected. The aspiring librettist laid a complaint against Bellini in a report to Parma&#x27;s Grand Chamberlain in December 1828 (which was ignored). In it, the aggrieved librettist sums up Bellini&#x27;s tastes in Romantic drama: &quot;[he] likes Romanticism and exaggeration. He declares that Classicism is cold and boring. ... He is entranced by unnatural meetings in forests, among graves, tombs and the like ...&quot;

In writing the libretto for &quot;Zaira&quot;, Romani expressed his position in relation to Voltaire&#x27;s tragedy by noting in the preface to the libretto: &quot;&quot;Zaira&quot; therefore is not covered with the ample cloak of Tragedy but wrapped in the tight form of Melodrama.&quot;

==Personal life and relationships==
Bellini was a notorious womanizer as evidenced in his letters to Francesco Florimo. However, three people had a prominent place in his life: Francesco Florimo, Maddelena Fumaroli and Giuditta Turina.

===Francesco Florimo===

One of the closest people in Bellini&#x27;s life was Francesco Florimo, whom he met as a fellow student at the Naples Conservatory. Throughout Bellini&#x27;s lifetime, the two shared a close correspondence. During the 1820 revolution, Bellini and Florimo joined a secret society, the Carboneria. Their closeness is evident in their letters. For example, on 12 January 1828 Bellini wrote that theirs were &quot;hearts made only to be friends to the last breath.&quot; Bellini wrote in 1825 that &quot;Your existence is necessary to mine&quot;. Further, on 11 February 1835, Bellini wrote: &quot; my excellent, my honest, my angelic friend! The more we know the world, the more we shall see how rare is our friendship.&quot; Based on these letters, some have speculated about Bellini&#x27;s sexuality, but Weinstock (1971) believed such interpretations are anachronistic. Rosselli (1996) expands on this point: contrary to how they may seem to modern readers, the expressions of close friendship in these letters were commonplace in Mediterranean societies and the world of early 1800s Italian opera rather than a reflection of sexual attachment. Once Bellini left Naples for Milan, the two men seldom saw one another; their last meeting was in Naples in late 1832, when Bellini was there with Giuditta Turina, before the pair departed for Milan via Florence. Florimo&#x27;s published recollections—written fifty years after the events they recall—may be flawed. In later years, Bellini declared that Florimo &quot;was the only friend in whom [I] could find comfort&quot;. Interpretation of Florimo&#x27;s collection of letters is complicated however by evidence that he often altered or completely fabricated some of his correspondences with Bellini to create an idealized image of the composer. Florimo was also known to have destroyed some compromising letters involving Bellini&#x27;s affairs with married women, including some in which Bellini wrote in detail about his affair with Giuditta Turina. After Bellini&#x27;s death Florimo became his literary executor.

===Maddalena Fumaroli===
Although the frustrating affair with Maddalena Fumaroli which, as noted above, came to nothing during these early years, the success achieved by &quot;Bianca e Gernado&quot; gave Bellini fresh hope that her parents would finally relent, and a new appeal was made through a friend. This was utterly rejected by Maddalena&#x27;s father, who returned all the letters which she had received along with a letter from him stating that &quot;my daughter will never marry a poor piano player (&quot;suonatore di cembalo&quot;)&quot;. However, when Florimo gave him the news, he said that he was going to try again and win, but the next move was to come later from the Fumaroli family.

At some time before March 1828, after the major success of &quot;Il pirata&quot; and just as Bellini was about to leave Milan for his production of &quot;Bianca e Ferdinando&quot; in Genoa, he received a notification from his go-between with the Fumaroli family that they had withdrawn their rejection of his proposal. But by then—with the efforts to build his career and with time and distance between him and Maddalena—his feelings had changed and, using Florimo to communicate to the family, he rejected the offer, expressing the feeling that he would be unable to support her financially. Even Maddalena&#x27;s own pleas in three letters which followed failed to change his mind.

===Giuditta Turina===

The one significant relationship which Bellini had after 1828 was the five-year relationship with Giuditta Turina, a young married woman with whom he began a passionate affair when both were in Genoa in April 1828 for the production of &quot;Bianca e Fernando&quot;. Their relationship lasted until Bellini went to Paris. Bellini&#x27;s letters to his friend Florimo indicate his satisfaction with the nature of the liaison, particularly because it kept him from having to marry—and thus becoming distracted from his work.

However, in May 1833 while he was in London, a significant change in Bellini&#x27;s relationship with Giuditta followed from the discovery by her husband of a compromising letter from Bellini. The result was that he decided to seek a legal separation and have her removed from his house. For Bellini, it meant the possibility of taking on responsibility for her, and he had no interest in doing that, having cooled in his feelings for her. When he wrote to Florimo from Paris the following year, he clearly stated that &quot;I constantly am being threatened from Milan with Giuditta&#x27;s coming to Paris&quot;, at which point he says he&#x27;ll leave that city if that were to happen. Then he continues: &quot;I no longer want to be put in the position of renewing a relationship that made me suffer great troubles&quot;. When Turina announced that she was leaving her husband, Bellini left her, saying &quot;with so many commitments, such a relationship would be fatal to me,&quot; expressing his fear of romantic attachments getting in the way of his musical career. Ultimately, he resisted any long-term emotional commitment, and never married.

However, Turina maintained contact with Florimo throughout her life, although [nothing] was heard from her after his death until she wrote a sad-but-friendly letter to Florimo. Florimo eventually returned the friendship and, as Galatopoulos notes, &quot;the death of Bellini was a mutual loss and Florimo needed Giuditta as much as she needed him&quot; so that the two corresponded for years and Florimo visited her in Milan &quot;at least once, in 1858&quot;. She died on 1 December 1871.

==Complete works of Bellini==

===Operas===
In 1999, the Italian music publisher Casa Ricordi, in collaboration with the Teatro Massimo Bellini in Catania, embarked on a project to publish critical editions of the complete works of Bellini.

<text>Vodún or vodúnsínsen is an African traditional religion practiced by the Aja, Ewe, and Fon peoples of Benin, Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria. Practitioners are commonly called or .

Vodún teaches the existence of a supreme creator divinity, under whom are lesser spirits called . Many of these deities are associated with specific areas, but others are venerated widely throughout West Africa; some have been absorbed from other religions, including Christianity and Hinduism. The are believed to physically manifest in shrines and there are provided with offerings, typically including animal sacrifices. There are several all-male secret societies, including Oró and Egúngún, into which individuals receive initiation. Various forms of divination are used to gain information from the , the most prominent of which is Fá, itself governed by a society of initiates.

Amid the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th to the 19th century, were among the enslaved Africans transported to the Americas. There, their traditional religions influenced the development of new religions such as Haitian Vodou, Louisiana Voodoo, and Brazilian Candomblé Jejé. Since the 1990s, there have been growing efforts to encourage foreign tourists to visit West Africa and receive initiation into Vodún.

Many practice their traditional religion alongside Christianity, for instance by interpreting Jesus Christ as a . Although primarily found in West Africa, since the late 20th century the religion has also spread abroad and is practised by people of varied ethnicities and nationalities.

==Definition==
Vodún is a religion. The anthropologist Timothy R. Landry noted that, although the term is commonly used, a more accurate name for the religion was , meaning &quot;spirit worship&quot;. The spelling &quot;Vodún&quot; is commonly used to distinguish the West African religion from the Haitian religion more usually spelled; this in turn is often used to differentiate it from Louisiana. An alternative spelling sometimes used for the West African religion is &quot;Vodu&quot;.
The religion&#x27;s adherents are referred to as or, in the French language, .

Vodún is &quot;the predominant religious system&quot; of southern Benin, Togo, and parts of southeast Ghana. The anthropologist Judy Rosenthal noted that &quot;Fon and Ewe forms of Vodu worship are virtually the same&quot;.
It is part of the same network of religions that include Yoruba religion as well as African diasporic traditions like Haitian Vodou, Cuban Santería, and Brazilian Candomblé. As a result of centuries of interaction between Fon and Yoruba peoples, Landry noted that Vodún and Yoruba religion were &quot;at times, indistinguishable or at least, blurry&quot;. 

Vodún is a fragmented religion divided into &quot;independent small cult units&quot; devoted to particular spirits.
As a tradition, Vodún is not doctrinal, with no orthodoxy, and no central text. It is amorphous and flexible, changing and adapting in different situations, and emphasising efficacy over dogma. It is open to ongoing revision, being eclectic and absorbing elements from many cultural backgrounds, including from other parts of Africa but also from Europe, Asia, and the Americas. West African religions commonly absorb elements from elsewhere regardless of their origin; in West Africa, many individuals draw upon African traditional religions, Christianity, and Islam simultaneously to deal with life&#x27;s issues. In West Africa, sometimes abandon their religion for forms of Christianity like Evangelical Protestantism, although there are also Christians who convert to Vodún. A common approach is for people to practice Christianity while also engaging in Vodún rituals, although there are also who reject Christianity, deeming it incompatible with their tradition.

==Beliefs==
In Vodún, belief is centred around efficacy rather than Christian notions of faith.

===Theology===

Vodún teaches the existence of a single divine creator being. Below this entity are an uncountable number of spirits who govern different aspects of nature and society.
The term comes from the Gbé languages of the Niger-Congo language family. It translates as &quot;spirit&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;divinity&quot;, or &quot;presence&quot;. Among Fon-speaking Yoruba communities, the Fon term is regarded as being synonymous with the Yoruba language term .

The art historian Suzanne Preston Blier called these &quot;mysterious forces or powers that govern the world and the lives of those who reside within it&quot;. The religion is continually open to the incorporation of new spirit deities, while those that are already venerated may change and take on new aspects. Some Vodún practitioners for instance refer to Jesus Christ as the of the Christians.

A common belief is that the came originally from the sea. The spirits are thought to dwell in (&quot;land of the dead&quot;), an invisible world parallel to that of humanity.
The spirits have their own individual likes and dislikes; each also has particular songs, dances, and prayers directed to them. These spirits are deemed to manifest within the natural world.
When kings introduced new deities to the Fon people, it was often believed that these enhanced the king&#x27;s power.

The cult of each has its own particular beliefs and practices. It may also have its own restrictions on membership, with some groups only willing to initiate family members. People may venerate multiple sometimes also attending services at a Christian church.

Lɛgbà is the spirit of the crossroads who opens up communication between humanity and the spirit world. Sakpatá is the of earth and smallpox, but over time has come to be associated with new diseases like HIV/AIDS. The Dàn spirits are all serpents; Dàn is a serpent associated with riches and cool breezes. Xɛbyosò or Hɛvioso is the spirit of thunder. Gŭ is the spirit of metal and blacksmithing, and in more recent decades has come to be associated with metal vehicles like cars, trains, and planes. Gbădu is the wife of Fá. Tron is the spirit of the kola nut; he was recently introduced to the Vodún pantheon via Ewe speakers from Ghana and Togo.

Some Beninese acknowledge that certain Yoruba are more powerful than certain .

Also part of the Vodun worldview is the , a type of forest spirit.

Prayers to the usually include requests for financial wealth.
Practitioners seek to gain well-being by focusing on the health and remembrance of their families. There may be restrictions on who can venerate the deity; practitioners believe that women must be kept apart from Gbădu&#x27;s presence, for if they get near her they may be struck barren or die. Devotion to a particular deity may be marked in different ways; devotees of the smallpox spirit Sakpatá for instance scar their bodies to resemble smallpox scars.

Patterns of Vodun worship follow various dialects, spirits, practices, songs, and rituals. The divine Creator, called variously Mawu or Mahu, is a female being. She is an elder woman, and usually a mother who is gentle and forgiving. She is also seen as the god who owns all other gods and even if there is no temple made in her name, the people continue to pray to her, especially in times of distress. In one tradition, she bore seven children. Sakpata: Vodun of the Earth, Xêvioso (or Xêbioso): Vodun of Thunder, also associated with divine justice, Agbe: Vodun of the Sea, Gû: Vodun of Iron and War, Agê: Vodun of Agriculture and Forests, Jo: Vodun of Air, and Lêgba: Vodun of the Unpredictable.

The Creator embodies a dual cosmogonic principle of which Mawu the moon and Lisa the sun are respectively the female and male aspects, often portrayed as the twin children of the Creator. In other stories, Mawu-Lisa is depicted as a single hermaphroditic person capable of impregnating herself, with two faces rather than being twins. In other branches, the Creator and other are known by different names, such as Sakpo-Disa (Mawu), Aholu (Sakpata), and Anidoho (Da), Gorovodu.

===The soul===

Among the Fon, a common belief is that the head is the seat of a person&#x27;s soul. The head is thus of symbolic importance in Vodún.

Some Vodún traditions specifically venerate spirits of deceased humans. The Mama Tchamba tradition for instances honours slaves from the north who are believed to have become ancestors of contemporary Ewe people. Similarly, the Gorovodu tradition also venerates enslaved northerners, who are described as being from the Hausa, Kaybe, Mossi, and Tchamba ethnicities.

===Acɛ===

An important concept in Vodún is , a notion also shared by Yoruba religion and various African diasporic religions influenced by them.
Landry defined as &quot;divine power&quot;.
It is the of an object that is deemed to provide it with its power and efficacy.

==Practice==

The anthropologist Dana Rush noted that Vodun &quot;permeates virtually all aspects of life for its participants&quot;. As a tradition, it prioritises action and getting things done. Rosenthal found that, among members of the Gorovodu tradition, people stated that they followed the religion because it helped to heal their children when the latter fell sick. Financial transactions play an important role, with both the and their priests typically expecting payment for their services.

Landry described the religion as being &quot;deeply esoteric&quot;.
A male priest may be referred to with the Fon word . These practitioners may advertise their ritual services using radio, television, billboard adverts, and the internet. There are individuals who claim the title of the &quot;supreme child of Vodún in Benin&quot;, however there are competing claimants to the title and it is little recognised outside Ouidah.

The forest is a major symbol in Vodún.
Vodun practitioners believe that many natural materials contain supernatural powers, including leaves, meteorites, kaolin, soil from the crossroads, the feathers of African grey parrots, turtle shells, and dried chameleons. Landry stated that a connection to the natural environment was &quot;a dominant theme&quot; in the religion. The forest in particular is important in Vodun cosmology, and learning the power of the forest and of particular leaves that can be found there is a recurring theme among practitioners. Leaves, according to Landry, are &quot;building blocks for the spirits&#x27; power and material presence on earth&quot;. Leaves will often be immersed in water to create (vodun water), which is used to wash both new shrines and new initiates.

===Shrines===

The spirit temple is often referred to as the or the . This may be located inside a practitioner&#x27;s home, in a publicly accessible communal area, or hidden in a part of the forest accessible only to initiates. Its location impacts who uses it; some are used only be a household, others by a village, and certain shrines attract international pilgrims.

For adherents, these shrines are deemed to be physical incarnations of the spirits, and not simply images or representations of them. Rosenthal called these shrines &quot;god-objects&quot;. A wooden carved statue is referred to as a .

Particular objects are selected for use in building a shrine based on intrinsic qualities they are believed to possess.
The constituent parts of the shrine are dependent on the identity of the spirit being enshrined there. Fá for instance is enshrined in 16 palm nuts, while Xɛbyosò&#x27;s shrines require (&quot;thunderstones&#x27;) believed to have been created where lightning struck the earth. Gbǎdù, as the &quot;mother of creation,&quot; often requires that her shrines incorporate a vagina, either of a deceased family matriarch or of an animal, along with camwood, charcoal, kaolin, and mud. Lɛgbà, meanwhile, is represented by mounds of soil, typically covering leaves and other objects buried within it. There may also be some experimentation in the ingredients used in constructing the shrine, as practitioners hope to make the manifested spirit as efficacious as possible.

Plant material is often used in building shrines, with specific leaves being important in the process. Offerings may be given to a tree from which material is harvested. Shrines may also include material from endangered species, including leopard hides, bird eggs, parrot feathers, insects, and elephant ivory. Various foreign initiates, while trying to leave West Africa, have found material intended for their shrines confiscated at airport customs.

In a ritual that typically incorporates divination, sacrifices, and leaf baths for both the objects and the practitioner, the spirit is installed within these shrines. It is the objects added, and the rituals performed while adding them, that are deemed to give the spirit its earthly power.

An animal will usually be sacrificed to ensure the spirit manifests within the shrine; it is believed that the animal charges the spirit&#x27;s acɛ, which gives the shrine life. For shrines to Lɛgbà, for instance, a rooster force-fed red palm oil will often by buried alive at the spot where the shrine is to be built.
When praying at a shrine, it is customary for a worshipper to leave a gift of money for the spirits. There are often also pots around it in which offerings may be placed. Wooden stakes may be impaled into the floor around the shrine as part of an individual&#x27;s petition.

In this material form, the spirits must be maintained, fed, and cared for.
Offerings and prayers will be directed towards the shrine as a means of revitalising its power. At many shrines, years of dried blood and palm oil have left a patina across the shrine and offering vessels. Some have been maintained for hundreds of years. Shrines may also be adorned and embellished with new objects gifted by devotees. Shrines of Yalódè for instance may be adorned in brass bracelets, and those of Xɛbyosò with carved wooden axes. Although these objects are not seen as part of the spirit&#x27;s material body itself, they are thought to carry the deity&#x27;s divine essence.

===Oró and Egúngún===

The Oró and Egúngún groups are all-male secret societies. In Beninese society, these groups command respect through fear. In contemporary Benin, it is common for a young man to be initiated into both societies on the same day.

A culture of secrecy surrounds the Egúngún society.
Once initiated, a man will be expected to have his own Egúngún mask made; these masks are viewed as embodiments of the ancestors. Some people also make these masks, but do not consecrate or use them, for sale on the international art market, but other members of the society disapprove of this practice.

===Possession===
Possession is part of most Vodún cults. Rosenthal noted, from her ethnographic research in Togo, that females were more often possessed than males. Her research also found children as young as 10 being possessed, although most were over 15. In some groups, priests will rarely go into possession trance as they are responsible for overseeing the broader ceremony.

The possessed person is often referred to as the itself. Once the person has received the spirit, they will often be dressed in attire suitable for that possessing entity. The possessed will address other attendees, offering them advice on illnesses, conduct, and making promises. When a person is possessed, they may be cared for by another individual. Those possessed often enjoy the prestige of having hosted their deities.

===Offerings and animal sacrifice===
Vodun involves animal sacrifices to both ancestors and other spirits, a practice called in Fon. Animal species commonly used for sacrifice include birds, dogs, cats, goats, rams, and bulls. There is ample evidence that in parts of West Africa, human sacrifice was also performed prior to European colonisation, such as in the Dahomey kingdom during the Annual Customs of Dahomey.

Typically, a message to the spirits will be spoken into the animal&#x27;s ear and its throat will then be cut. The shrine itself will be covered in the victim&#x27;s blood. This is done to feed the spirit by nourishing its . Practitioners believe that this act maintains the relationship between humans and the spirits. The meat will be cooked and consumed by the attendees, something believed to bestow blessing from the for the person eating it. The individual who killed the animal will often take ritual precautions to pacify their victim and discourage their spirit from taking vengeance upon them.

Among followers in the United States, where butchery skills are far rarer, it is less common for practitioners to eat the meat. Also present in the U.S. are practitioners who have rejected the role of animal sacrifice in Vodun, deeming it barbaric.

===Initiation===

Initiation bestows a person with the power of a . It results in long-term obligations to the spirits that a person has received; that person is expected to honour their spirits with praise, to feed them, and to supply them with money, while in turn the spirit offers benefits to the initiate, giving them promises of protection, abundance, long life, and a large family.

The typical age of a person being initiated varies between spirit cults; in some cases children are preferred.
The process of initiation can last from a few months to a few years. It differs among spirit cults; in Benin, Fá initiation usually takes less than a week, whereas initiations into the cults of other may take several weeks or months. Initiation is expensive; especially high sums are generally charged for foreigners seeking initiation or training.
Practitioners believe that some spirits embody powers that are too intense for non-initiates.
Being initiated is described as &quot;to find the spirit&#x27;s depths&quot;. Animal sacrifice is a typical feature of initiation.
Trainees will often be expected to learn many different types of leaves and respective qualities.

===Divination===

Divination plays an important role in Vodún. Different groups often utilise different divinatory methods; the priestesses of Mamíwátá for instance employ mirror gazing, while the priests of Tron use kola nut divination.

Across Vodún&#x27;s practitioners, Fá is often deemed the best form of divination. Its initiates claim that it is the only system that has sufficient to be consistently accurate. This is a system adopted from the Yoruba. Fá diviners typically believe that the priests of other spirits do not have the right to read the sacred signs of Fá. A consultation with an initiate is termed a .

In Vodun, a diviner is called a . A successful diviner is expected to provide solutions to their client&#x27;s problem, for instance selling them charms, spiritual baths, or ceremonies to alleviate their issue. The fee charged will often vary depending on the client, with the diviner charging a reduced rate for family members and a more expensive rate to either tourists or to middle and upper-class Beninese.
Diviners will often recommend that their client seeks initiation.

===Healing and ===

Healing is a central element of Vodún.

The Fon term can be translated into English as &quot;charm&quot;; many Francophone Beninese refer to them as . These are amulets made from zoological and botanical material that is then activated using secret incantations, the latter called (&quot;bǒ&#x27;s language&quot;). Families or individuals often keep their recipes for creating a closely guarded secret; there is a widespread belief that if someone else discovers the precise ingredients they will have power over its maker. are often sold; tourists for instance often buy them to aid in attracting love, wealth, or protection while travelling.

 designed for specific functions may have particular names; a is alleged to offer invisibility while a provides the power of translocation.
Anthropomorphic figurines produced especially in the Fon and Ayizo area of southern Benin are commonly called (&quot;bǒ cadaver&quot;). These are often kept within a shrine or house—sometimes concealed in the rafters or under a bed—although in some places have also been situated outside, in public spaces. Although are not intended as representations of , early European travellers who encountered these objects labelled them &quot;idols&quot; and &quot;fetishes&quot;.

Another belief in Vodún is in a universal and invisible power, and one which many practitioners regard as the most powerful spiritual force available. In English, has sometimes been translated as &quot;witchcraft&quot;. Several such as Kɛnnɛsi, Mǐnɔna, and Gbădu, are thought to draw their power from .
Many practitioners draw a distinction between , the destructive and harmful side of this power, and , its protective and benevolent side. People who claim to use this power call themselves and typically insist that they employ to protect their families from . In Vodún lore, becoming an comes at a cost, for the gives the practitioner a propensity for illness and shortens their life.

According to Vodún belief, are capable of transforming into animals and flying. To become an , an individual must use to kill someone, commonly a relative. In the tradition, practitioners of send their soul out at night, where they gather with other practitioners to plot how they will devour other people&#x27;s souls, ultimately killing them. Owls, black cats, and vultures are all regarded as dangerous agents of . Many people fear that their success will attract the envy of malevolent within their family or neighbourhood. The identity of the , many practitioners believe, can be ascertained through divination.
Landry found that everyone he encountered in Benin believed in to various degrees, whereas many non-Africans arriving for initiation were more sceptical of its existence.

==History==

===Pre-colonial history===

Landry noted that prior to European colonialism, Vodún was not identified as &quot;a monolithic religion&quot; but was &quot;a social system made of countless spirit and ancestor cults that existed without religious boundaries.&quot; Many of these cults were closely interwoven with political structures, sometimes representing something akin to state religions.
From the early 16th century, waves of Adja and related peoples migrated eastward, establishing close ties with each other and forming the basis for the emergent Fon people. The Fon made contact with Portuguese sailors in the 16th century and subsequently also the French, British, Dutch, and Danish in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The 17th century saw the rise of the Dahomey state in this area of West Africa. This generated religious change; early in the 17th century, Dahomey&#x27;s king Agaja conquered the Xwedá kingdom (in what is now southern Benin) and the Xwedá&#x27;s serpent came to be widely adopted by the Fon.
From to 1823, Dahomey was a vassal state of Oyo, the Yoruba-led kingdom to the east, with this period seeing considerable religious exchange between the two. Fon peoples adopted the Fá, Oró, and Egúngún cults from the Yoruba. Fá was for instance present among the Fon by the reign of Dahomey&#x27;s fifth ruler, Tegbesu () and by the reign of Gezo () had become well established in the Dahomean royal palace.

As a result of the Atlantic slave trade, practitioners of Vodún were enslaved and transported to the Americas, where their practices influenced those of developing African diasporic traditions. Coupled with the religion of the Kongo people from Central Africa, the Vodún religion of the Fon became one of the two main influences on Haitian Vodou. Like the name itself, many of the terms used in this creolised Haitian religion derive from the Fon language; including the names of many deities, which in Haiti are called . In Brazil, the dominant African diasporic religion became Candomblé and this was divided into various traditions called &quot;nacoes&quot; (&quot;nations&quot;). Of these &quot;nacoes&quot;, the Jeje tradition uses terms borrowed from Ewe and Fon languages, for instance referring to its spirit deities as .

===Colonialism and Christianity===

In 1890, France invaded Dahomey and dethroned its king, Béhanzin. In 1894, it became a French protectorate under a puppet king, Agoli-agbo, but in 1900 the French ousted him and abolished the Kingdom of Dahomey. To the west, the area that became Togo became a German protectorate in 1884. Germany maintained control until 1919 when, following their defeat in the First World War, the eastern portion became part of the British Gold Coast and the western part became French territory.

Christian missionaries were active in this part of West Africa from the 18th century. A German Presbyterian mission had established in the Gold Coast in 1737 before spreading their efforts into the Slave Coast in the 19th century. These Presbyterians attempted to break adherence to Vodún in the southern and plateau regions. The 19th century also saw conversion efforts launched by Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Methodist missionaries.

Although proving less of an influence than Christianity, Islam also impacted Vodún, reflected in the occasional use of Islamic script in the construction of Vodún charms.

===Post-colonial history===

In 1960, Dahomey became an independent state, as did Togo.
In 1972, Mathieu Kérékou seized power of Dahomey in a military coup and subsequently transformed it into a Marxist-Leninist state, the People&#x27;s Republic of Benin. Kérékou believed that Vodún wasted time, money, and resources that were better spent on economic development. In 1973 he banned Vodún ceremonies during the rainy season, with further measures to suppress the religion following throughout the 1970s. Under Kérékou&#x27;s rule, Vodun priests had to perform new initiations in secret, and the duration of the initiatory process was often shortened from a period of years to one of months, weeks, or days.

In 1989, Benin transitioned to democratic governance. After becoming prime minister in 1991, Nicéphore Soglo lifted many anti-Vodún laws. The Beninese government planned &quot;Ouidah &#x27;92: The First International Festival of Vodun Arts and Cultures,&quot; which took place in 1993; among the special guests invited were Pierre Verger and Mama Lola, reflecting attempts to build links across the African diaspora. It also established 10 January as &quot;National Vodún Day.&quot; From the 1990s, the Beninese government increasingly made a concerted effort to encourage Vodún-themed tourism, hoping that many foreigners would come seeking initiation.

By the late 1960s, some American black nationalists were travelling to West Africa to gain initiation into Vodún or Yoruba religion. By the late 1980s, some white middle-class Americans began arriving for the same reason.
Some initiates of Haitian Vodou or Santería still go to West Africa for initiation as they believe that it is there that the &quot;real secrets&quot; or &quot;true spiritual power&quot; can be found; the majority of arrivals seek initiation into Fá. West Africans have also taken the religion to the U.S., where it has interacted and blended with diasporic religions like Vodou and Santería. Many West African practitioners have seen the international promotion of Vodún as a means of healing the world and countering hate and violence, as well as a means of promoting their own ritual abilities to an international audience, which will potentially attract new clients.

==Demographics==

About 17% of the population of Benin, some 1.6 million people, follow Vodun. (This does not count other traditional religions in Benin.) In addition, many of the 41.5% of the population that refer to themselves as &quot;Christian&quot; practice a syncretized religion, not dissimilar from Haitian Vodou or Brazilian Candomblé; indeed, many of them are descended from freed Brazilian slaves who settled on the coast near Ouidah.

In Togo, about half the population practices indigenous religions, of which Vodun is by far the largest, with some 2.5 million followers; there may be another million Vodunists among the Ewe of Ghana, as 13% of the total Ghana population of 20 million are Ewe and 38% of Ghanaians practice traditional religion. According to census data, about 14 million people practice traditional religion in Nigeria, most of whom are Yoruba practicing Ifá, but no specific breakdown is available.

Although initially present only among West Africans, Vodún is now followed by people of many races, ethnicities, nationalities, and classes. Foreigners who come for initiation are predominantly from the United States; many of them have already explored African diasporic traditions like Haitian Vodou, Santería, or Candomblé, or alternatively Western esoteric religions such as Wicca. Many of the spiritual tourists who arrived in West Africa had little or no Fon or French, nor an understanding of the region&#x27;s cultural and social norms. Some of these foreigners seek initiation so that they can initiate others as a source of revenue.

==Reception and influence==

In the view of some foreign observers, Vodún is Satanism and demon worship. Although seeing its deities as malevolent demons, many West African Christians still regard Vodún as being effective and powerful.
Some Beninese regard Christianity as &quot;less worrisome and less expensive&quot; than Vodún; many individuals converted to Christianity to deal with bewitchment, believing that Jesus could heal and protect them for free, whereas any offering to counter witches would extract a substantial price.

<text>Vickers was a British engineering company that existed from 1828 until 1999. It was formed in Sheffield as a steel foundry by Edward Vickers and his father-in-law, and soon became famous for casting church bells. The company went public in 1867, acquired more businesses, and began branching out into military hardware and shipbuilding. 

In 1911, the company expanded into aircraft manufacture and opened a flying school. They expanded even further into electrical and railway manufacturing, and in 1928 acquired an interest in the Supermarine.

Beginning in the 1960s, various parts of the company were nationalised, and in 1999 the rest of the company was acquired by Rolls-Royce plc, which sold the defence arm to Alvis plc. The Vickers name lived on in Alvis Vickers, until the latter was acquired by BAE Systems in 2004 to form BAE Systems Land Systems.

==History==
===Early history===
Vickers was formed in Sheffield as a steel foundry by Edward Vickers and his father-in-law George Naylor in 1828. Naylor was a partner in the foundry Naylor &amp; Sanderson and Vickers&#x27; brother William owned a steel rolling operation. Edward&#x27;s investments in the railway industry allowed him to gain control of the company, based at Millsands and known as Naylor Vickers and Company. It began by making steel castings and quickly became famous for casting church bells. In 1854 Vickers&#x27; sons Thomas (a militia officer known familiarly as &#x27;Colonel Tom&#x27;) and joined the business and their considerable talents – Tom Vickers as a metallurgist and Albert as a team-builder and salesman – were key to its subsequent rapid development. &quot;Its great architects,&quot; the historian Clive Trebilcock writes, &quot;Colonel T.E. (1833–1915) and Albert (1838–1919) Vickers... provided &quot;both&quot; inspired technical leadership... and equally astute commercial direction. Both men were autocrats by temperament, but neither shunned advice or avoided delegation; each, but particularly Albert, had a marked gift for the selection of talented subordinates.&quot;

In 1863 the company moved to a new site in Sheffield on the River Don in Brightside.

===Vickers, Sons &amp; Company===
The company went public in 1867 as Vickers, Sons &amp; Company and gradually acquired more businesses, branching out into various sectors. In 1868 Vickers began to manufacture marine shafts, in 1872 they began casting marine propellers and in 1882 they set up a forging press. They were also supplying steel forgings for gun barrel manufacturers, including their future main competitor Armstrong, as early as 1870.

After a decline in lucrative tool steel demand in the US during the first half of 1880s, the stockholders logically decided in spring 1887 to diversify into large-scale armaments production and approved £1.5 million (1887, equivalent to £172.83 million in 2023) capital increase. By the end of 1888 Vickers produced and tested both their first artillery piece and first armour plate. The time could have never been more fortunate, with the Naval Defence Act 1889 significantly increasing the domestic demand and the invention of nickel steel armour rendering obsolete and worthless the investments of established producers into compound armour.

===Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim===
Vickers bought out the Barrow-in-Furness shipbuilder The Barrow Shipbuilding Company in 1897, acquiring its subsidiary the Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company at the same time, to become Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim.

Ordnance and ammunition made during this period, including World War I, was stamped V.S.M.

The yard at Barrow became the &quot;Construction Yard&quot;. With these acquisitions, Vickers could now produce a complete selection of products, from ships and marine fittings to armour plate and a whole suite of ordnance. In 1901 the Royal Navy&#x27;s first submarine, &quot;Holland 1&quot;, was launched at the Naval Construction Yard. In 1902 Vickers took a half share in the famous Clyde shipyard John Brown &amp; Company.

Further diversification occurred in 1901 with the acquisition of a proposed business which was incorporated as The Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company and in 1905 the goodwill and patent rights of the Siddeley car. In 1911 a controlling interest was acquired in torpedo manufacturer Whitehead &amp; Company.

===Vickers Limited===
In 1911 the company name was changed to Vickers Ltd and expanded its operations into aircraft manufacture by the formation of Vickers Ltd (Aviation Department) and a Vickers School of Flying was opened at Brooklands, Surrey on 20 January 1912. In 1919, the British Westinghouse electrical company was taken over as the Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company; Metrovick. At the same time they came into Metropolitan&#x27;s railway interests.

===Reorganisation===
A reorganisation during 1926 led to the retention of the rolling stock group: Metropolitan Carriage Wagon and Finance Company and The Metropolitan -Vickers Company and the disposal of: Vickers-Petters Limited, British Lighting and Ignition Company, the Plywood department at Crayford Creek, Canadian Vickers, William Beardmore and Co, and Wolseley Motors.

In 1927, Vickers merged with Tyneside based engineering company Armstrong Whitworth to become Vickers-Armstrongs. Armstrong Whitworth had developed along similar lines to Vickers, expanding into various military sectors and was notable for their artillery manufacture at Elswick and shipbuilding at a yard at High Walker on the River Tyne. Armstrongs shipbuilding interests became the &quot;Naval Yard&quot;, those of Vickers on the west coast the &quot;Naval Construction Yard&quot;. Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft was not absorbed by the new company.

In 1928, the Aviation Department became Vickers (Aviation) Ltd and soon after acquired Supermarine, which became the &quot;Supermarine Aviation Works (Vickers) Ltd&quot;. In 1938, both companies were re-organised as Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft) Ltd, although the former Supermarine and Vickers works continued to brand their products under their former names. 1929 saw the merger of the acquired railway business with those of Cammell Laird to form Metropolitan Cammell Carriage &amp; Wagon.

===Nationalisation===
In 1960, the aircraft interests were merged with those of the Bristol, English Electric and Hunting Aircraft to form the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC). This was owned by Vickers, English Electric and Bristol (holding 40%, 40% and 20% respectively). BAC in turn owned 70% of Hunting. The Supermarine operation was closed in 1963 and the Vickers name for aircraft was dropped in 1965. Under the terms of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act BAC was nationalised in 1977 to become part of British Aerospace, which exists today in the guise of BAE Systems.

The Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act also led to the nationalisation of Vickers&#x27; shipbuilding division as part of British Shipbuilders. These had been renamed Vickers Armstrong Shipbuilders in 1955, changing again to Vickers Limited Shipbuilding Group in 1968. This division was privatised as Vickers Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering in 1986, later part of GEC&#x27;s Marconi Marine. It remains in operation to this day as BAE Systems Submarines.

===Vickers plc===
With their steelworking operations also nationalised into British Steel Corporation the remnants of Vickers became Vickers plc. In 1986, Vickers acquired the armaments manufacturer Royal Ordnance Factory, Leeds, which became Vickers Defence Systems. Other acquisitions included automotive engineers Cosworth in 1990, waterjet manufacturer Kamewa in 1986 and Norwegian marine propulsion and engineering company Ulstein in 1998. 1998 also saw the sale of Rolls-Royce Motors and Cosworth to Volkswagen Group for £430 million, beating out BMW&#x27;s offer of £340 million.

===Current status of Vickers===
In 1927, Vickers merged with the Tyneside-based engineering firm Armstrong Whitworth to form Vickers-Armstrongs. Armstrong Whitworth developed in a similar way to Vickers, expanding into various military fields and became famous for its artillery construction at Elswick and shipbuilding at its yard at High Walker upon Tyne.
In 1928, the Aviation Department changed its name to Vickers (Aviation) Ltd and shortly afterwards acquired Supermarine, which became &#x27;Supermarine Aviation Works (Vickers) Ltd&#x27;.
In 1938, the two companies were reorganised as Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft) Ltd, although the former Supermarine and Vickers works continued to brand their products under their former names. In 1929, the acquired railway business was merged with that of Cammell Laird to form Metropolitan Cammell Carriage &amp; Wagon.

1.6 Fifth change of the company
After the Second World War Vickers-Armstrongs manufactured commercial aircraft. In 1959 it introduced the VC10 jet aircraft and in the same year the government forced a merger with Bristol Aeroplane Company, English Electric and Hunting Aircraft to form the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC).
Alongside the achievements of BAC, the Hawker Siddeley Group were also experiencing success with the likes of the Hawker Harrier &#x27;Jump Jet&#x27; and Hawker Siddeley Trident passenger aircraft. The two companies competed side by side for contracts throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, until the British Government expressed a desire for the two entities to merge. Finally, on 29 April 1977, the two companies were finally nationalised and a new company, British Aerospace Plc, emerged.
The rail business acquired by Vickers was sold to Alstom in 1989.

<doc id="32673" wikidata="Q366502" url="?curid=32673" title="Villard de Honnecourt">
<text>Villard de Honnecourt (&quot;Wilars dehonecort&quot;, &quot;Vilars de Honecourt&quot;) was a 13th-century artist from Picardy in northern France. He is known to history only through a surviving portfolio or &quot;sketchbook&quot; containing about 250 drawings and designs of a wide variety of subjects.

== Life ==
Nothing is known of Villard apart from what can be gleaned from his surviving &quot;sketchbook.&quot; Based on the large number of architectural designs in the portfolio, it was traditionally thought that Villard was a successful, professional, itinerant architect and engineer. This view is sometimes contested today, as there is no evidence of him ever working as an architect and the drawings contain some inaccuracies. However, Honnecourt compiled a manual that gave precise instructions for executing specific objects with explanatory drawings. In his writings he fused principles passed on from ancient geometry, medieval studio techniques, and contemporary practices. The author includes sections on technical procedures, mechanical devices, suggestions for making human and animal figures, and notes on the buildings and monuments he had seen. And his writings offer insights into the variety of interests and work of the 13th-century master mason in addition to providing an explanation for the spread of Gothic architecture in Europe. He traveled to some of the major ecclesiastical building sites of his day to record details of these buildings. His drawing of one of the west facade towers of Laon Cathedral and those of radiating chapels and a main vessel bay, interior and exterior, of Rheims Cathedral are of particular interest.

Villard tells us, with pride, that he had been in many lands (&quot;Jai este en m[u]lt de tieres&quot;) and that he made a trip to Hungary where he remained many days (&quot;maint ior&quot;), but he does not say why he went there or who sent him. It has recently been proposed that he may have been a lay agent or representative of the cathedral chapter of Cambrai Cathedral to obtain a relic of St. Elizabeth of Hungary who had made a donation to the cathedral chapter and to whom the chapter dedicated one of the radiating chapels in their new chevet. He also claimed to have made many of his drawings &quot;from life&quot; (&quot;al vif&quot;), an activity more usually associated with much later artists of the Renaissance.

== Sketchbook ==
The &quot;sketchbook&quot; or &quot;manual&quot; of Villard de Honnecourt (more correctly, an album or portfolio) dates to about c.1225-1235. It was discovered in the mid-19th century and is presently housed in the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF), Paris, under the shelfmark MS Fr 19093. It consists of 33 parchment sheets measuring on average 235x155 mm, or 9.25 x 6.1 inches. The manuscript is not complete and its original extent cannot be determined. Because the drawings and captions are oriented in many different directions, the album appears to have been assembled in an ad hoc fashion, as if the individual sheets were not originally intended to be bound together into book form. It is unclear whether it was Villard himself or a later party who assembled and bound the leaves into a book.

The album contains about 250 drawings. These include architectural designs (plans, elevations, and details, often of identifiable buildings), a great variety of human and animal subjects, ensembles of religious and secular figures perhaps derived from or intended as sculptural groups, ecclesiastical objects, mechanical devices (including a perpetual-motion machine), engineering constructions such as lifting devices and a water-driven saw, a number of automata, designs for war engines such as a trebuchet, and many other subjects. Many drawings are accompanied by annotations and labels.

The original purpose of the album is debatable. Originally it was thought to have served as a kind of training manual for practicing architects. This is rejected by some current researchers who think Villard&#x27;s drawings seem ill-suited to such a purpose, though it can also be argued that the drawings are deliberately simplistic and abstracted to serve as coded mnemonic devices for architects who were initiated into the relevant oral tradition.

<text>Vertical Interval Timecode (VITC, pronounced &quot;vitsee&quot;) is a form of SMPTE timecode encoded on one scan line in a video signal. These lines are typically inserted into the vertical blanking interval of the video signal.

With one exception, VITC contains the same payload as SMPTE linear timecode (LTC), embedded in a new frame structure with extra synchronization bits and an error-detection checksum. The exception is that VITC is encoded twice per interlaced video frame, once in each field, and one additional bit (the &quot;field flag&quot;) is used to distinguish the two fields.

A video frame may contain more than one VITC code if necessary, recorded on different lines. This is often used in production, where different entities may want to encode different sets of time-code metadata on the same tape.

As a practical matter, VITC can be more &#x27;frame-accurate&#x27; than LTC, particularly at very slow tape speeds on analog formats. LTC readers can lose track of code at slow jog speeds whereas VITC can be read frame-by-frame if need be. Conversely, at high speeds (FF/rew.), the VITC is often unreadable due to image distortions, so the LTC is often used instead. Some VCRs have an auto selection between the two formats to provide the highest accuracy.

VITC is 90 bits long: 32 bits of time code, 32 bits of user data, 18 synchronization bits, and 8 bits of checksum. It is transmitted using non-return-to-zero encoding at a bit rate of 115 times the line rate. (The unused 25 bit times are to leave room for the horizontal blanking interval.)
* Bit 14 is set to 1 if drop frame numbering is in use; frame numbers 0 and 1 are skipped during the first second of every minute, except multiples of 10 minutes. This converts 30 frame/second time code to the 29.97 frame/second NTSC standard.
* Bit 15, the color framing bit, is set to 1 if the time code is synchronized to a (color) video signal. The frame number modulo 2 (for NTSC and SECAM) or modulo 4 (for PAL) should be preserved across cuts in order to avoid phase jumps in the chrominance subcarrier.
* Bits 35, 55, and 75 differ between 25 frame/s time code, and 30/29.97 frame/s. The bits are:
** Field flag (bit 35 for 29.97/30 frame/s, bit 75 for 25 frame/s): This is an additional least-significant bit for the frame number, distinguishing the two interlaced fields in one video frame. It is set to 0 during the first field of a frame, and to 1 during the second. This bit replaces the &quot;polarity correction&quot; bit in linear timecode.
** &quot;Binary group flag&quot; bits BGF0 and BGF2 (bits 55 and 75 for 29.97/30 frame/s, bits 35 and 55 for 25 frame/s): These indicate the format of the user bits. Both bits zero indicates no (or unspecified) format. Only BGF0 set indicates four 8-bit characters (transmitted little-endian). The combinations with BGF2 set are reserved.
* Bit 74 (&quot;Binary group flag 1&quot;) was previously unassigned, but is used to indicate that the time code is synchronized to an external clock. If zero, the timecode start time is arbitrary.
*The checksum in bits 82–89 is a simple bytewise XOR of the previous 82 bits (&quot;including&quot; the sync bits, so bit 82 is the XOR of bits 74, 66, ..., 2), which can be described as a CRC with generator polynomial &quot;x&quot;8+1. (Preset to zero, no inversion.)

The exact nature of the color frame sequence depends on the video standard being used. In the case of the three main composite video standards, PAL video has an 8-field (4 frame) color frame sequence, and NTSC and SECAM both have 4-field (2 frame) color frame sequences.

Preserving the color framing sequence of video across edits and between channels in video effects was an important issue in early analog composite videotape editing systems, as cuts between different color sequences would cause jumps in subcarrier phase, and mixing two signals of different field dominance would result in color artifacts on the part of the signal that was not in sync with the output color frame sequence.

To help prevent these problems, SMPTE time code contains a color framing bit, which can be used to indicate that the video material the timecode refers to follows a standard convention regarding the synchronization of video time code and the color framing sequence. If the color framing bit was set in both types of material, the editing system could then always ensure that color framing was preserved by constraining edit decisions between input sources to keep the correct relationship between the timecode sequences, and hence the color framing sequences.

<text>Vandalism is the action involving deliberate destruction of or damage to public or private property.

The term includes property damage, such as graffiti and defacement directed towards any property without permission of the owner. The term finds its roots in an Enlightenment view that the Germanic Vandals were a uniquely destructive people, as they sacked Rome in 455 AD.

==Etymology==

The Vandals, an ancient Germanic people, are associated with senseless destruction as a result of their sack of Rome under King Genseric in 455. During the Enlightenment, Rome was idealized, while the Goths and Vandals were blamed for its destruction. The Vandals may not have been any more destructive than other invaders of ancient times, but they did inspire English poet John Dryden to write, &quot;Till Goths, and Vandals, a rude Northern race, Did all the matchless Monuments deface&quot; (1694). However, the Vandals did intentionally damage statues, which may be why their name is associated with the vandalism of art. The term &quot;Vandalisme&quot; was coined in 1794 by Henri Grégoire, bishop of Blois, to describe the destruction of artwork following the French Revolution. The term was quickly adopted across Europe. This new use of the term was important in colouring the perception of the Vandals from later Late Antiquity, popularizing the pre-existing idea that they were a barbaric group with a taste for destruction.

Historically, vandalism has been justified by painter Gustave Courbet as destruction of monuments symbolizing &quot;war and conquest&quot;. Therefore, it is often done as an expression of contempt, creativity, or both. Courbet&#x27;s attempt, during the 1871 Paris Commune, to dismantle the Vendôme column, a symbol of the past Napoleon III authoritarian Empire, was one of the most celebrated events of vandalism. Nietzsche himself would meditate after the Commune on the &quot;fight against culture&quot;, taking as example the intentional burning of the Tuileries Palace on 23 May 1871. &quot;The criminal fight against culture is only the reverse side of a criminal culture&quot; wrote Klossowski after quoting Nietzsche.

In a proposal to the International Conference for Unification of Criminal Law held in Madrid in 1933, Raphael Lemkin envisaged the creation of two new international crimes (delicta juris gentium): the crime of barbarity, consisting in the extermination of racial, religious, or social collectivities, and the crime of vandalism, consisting in the destruction of cultural and artistic works of these groups. The proposal was not accepted. A figurative accusation of vandalism was applied towards the theology of Marcion of Sinope.

==As a crime==
Private citizens commit vandalism when they willfully damage or deface the property of others or the commons. Some vandalism may qualify as culture jamming or sniggling: it is thought by some to be artistic in nature even though carried out illegally or without the property owner&#x27;s permission. Examples include at least some graffiti art, billboard &quot;liberation&quot;, and possibly crop circles. Criminal vandalism takes many forms. Graffiti on public property is common in many inner cities as part of a gang culture, where they might be used as territorial markers.

More serious forms of vandalism that may take place during public unrest such as rioting can involve the willful destruction of public and private property. Vandalism per se is sometimes considered one of the less serious common crimes, but it can become quite serious and distressing when committed extensively, violently, or as an expression of hatred and intimidation. In response, local governments have adopted various legal measures to prevent vandalism, but research has shown that the conventional strategies employed by the government in response to at least unapproved graffiti are not the most effective.

===Examples===
Examples of vandalism include salting lawns, cutting trees without permission, egg throwing, breaking windows, arson, spraying paint on others&#x27; properties, tagging, placing glue into locks, tire slashing, &quot;keying&quot; (scratching) paint, ransacking a property, flooding a house by clogging a sink and leaving the water running, and pulling up plants from the roots without permission.

=== Political ===

In elections, opposing candidates&#x27; supporters may engage in &quot;political vandalism&quot;⁠—the act of defacing opponents&#x27; political posters, bumper stickers, billboards, and other street marketing material. Although the nature of this material is temporary, its effect can be long-lasting as it may reflect both negatively and positively on the candidate whose material is being vandalized as well as on the presumed candidate whose supporters are engaging in the vandalism.

In addition, activists may use the tactic of property destruction as means of protest, e.g. by smashing the windows of banks, shops and government institutions and setting fire to cars. This often takes place during riots but can also happen as a stand-alone event, e.g. by animal rights activists destroying property owned by farmers, hunters, biotech companies, and research facilities and setting free animals (which is sometimes referred to as eco-terrorism by opponents). Vandalism is also a common tactic of black blocs.

===Motives===
Actions of this kind can be ascribed to anger or envy, or to spontaneous, opportunistic behaviour, possibly for peer acceptance or bravado in gang cultures, or disgruntlement with the target (victim) person or society. Another common motive is to seek attention, and for personal gain. Opportunistic vandalism of this nature may also be filmed, the mentality of which can be akin to happy slapping. The large-scale prevalence of gang graffiti in some inner cities has almost made it acceptable to the societies based there, so much so that it may go unnoticed, or not be removed, possibly because it may be a fruitless endeavour, to be graffitied on once again. Greed can motivate vandalism as can some political ideologies, wish to draw attention to problems, frustration, even playfulness. Youngsters, the most common vandals, frequently experience low status and boredom. Vandalism enables powerless people to attack those above them, take control and frighten others. Unpunished vandalism can provide relief which reinforces the behaviour. Vandalism by one person can lead to imitation. Teenage boys and men in their 20s are most likely to vandalize, but older adults and females are also known to sometimes vandalize, with young children occasionally vandalizing, but in a much smaller form, such as making small crayon drawings on walls.
Criminological research into vandalism has found that it serves many purposes for those who engage in it and stems from a variety of motives. Sociologist Stanley Cohen describes seven different types of vandalism:
#Acquisitive vandalism (looting and petty theft).
#Peer pressure – Teenagers spend more time away from home with peers, and whether they act constructively or destructively can depend on the contacts they make. Disobeying authority can appear cool.
#Tactical vandalism (to advance some end other than acquiring money or property – such as breaking a window to be arrested and get a bed for the night in a police cell).
#Ideological vandalism (carried out to further an explicit ideological cause or deliver a message).
#Vindictive vandalism (for revenge).
#Play vandalism (damage resulting from children&#x27;s games).
#Malicious vandalism (damage caused by a violent outpouring of diffuse frustration and rage that often occurs in public settings). Cohen&#x27;s original typology was improved upon by Mike Sutton whose research led him to add a seventh sub-type of vandalism – Peer Status Motivated Vandalism.

===Reaction of authorities===
In view of its incivility, punishment for vandalism can be particularly severe in some countries. In Singapore, for example, a person who attempts to cause or commits an act of vandalism may be liable to imprisonment for up to three years and may also be punished with caning. Vandalism in the UK is construed as an environmental crime and may be punished with an ASBO (Anti-Social Behaviour Order).

In the 1990s, former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani cracked down on &quot;quality of life crimes&quot;, including graffiti. NY Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern described graffiti as &quot;a metaphor for urban decay perhaps best shown in &#x27;A Clockwork Orange&#x27;&quot; adding that &quot;New York City will not be like that&quot;.

===Cybervandalism===
Cybervandalism is vandalism on the internet. For example, vandalism on Wikipedia involves adding questionable content, removing content, or changing content in order to make it questionable, generally with the objective of harming Wikipedia&#x27;s reputation. Forms of online vandalism have been recorded, the most common of which is website defacement. Vandalism on web maps has been called &quot;cartographic vandalism&quot;. Certain kinds of malware without financial intent also count. 

Cybervandalism could be said to be a form of creativity and artistry. An example of this was when the Cheltenham paint festival was cancelled due to COVID-19, and artists still proceeded to celebrate their artistry virtually.

===Defacement===

Defacement is a type of vandalism that involves damaging the appearance or surface of something. The object of damage may be architecture, books, paintings, sculpture, or other forms of art.

Examples of defacement include:
* Marking or removing the part of an object (especially images, be they on the page, in illustrative art or as a sculpture) designed to hold the viewers&#x27; attention
* Scoring a book cover with a blade
* Splashing paint over a painting in a gallery
* Smashing the nose of a sculpted bust
* Damaging or chiselling off sculpted coats of arms
* Altering the content of web sites and publicly editable repositories to include nonsensical or whimsical references

Iconoclasm led to the defacement of many religious artworks.

==As art==


Though vandalism in itself is illegal, it is often also an integral part of modern popular culture. French painter Gustave Courbet&#x27;s attempt to disassemble the Vendôme column during the 1871 Paris Commune was probably one of the first artistic acts of vandalism, celebrated at least since Dada performances during World War I. The Vendôme column was considered a symbol of the recently deposed Second Empire of Napoleon III, and dismantled as such.

After the burning of the Tuileries Palace on 23 May 1871, Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche himself meditated about the &quot;fight against culture&quot;, wondering what could justify culture if it were to be destroyed in such a &quot;senseless&quot; manner (the arguments are: culture is justified by works of art and scientific achievements; exploitation is necessary to those achievements, leading to the creation of exploited people who then fight against culture. In this case, culture cannot be legitimised by art achievements, and Nietzsche writes: &quot;I {also} know what it means: fighting against culture&quot;. After quoting him, Klossowski writes: &quot;The criminal fight against culture is only the reverse side of a criminal culture&quot;.

As destruction of monument, vandalism can only have sense in a culture respecting history, archeology: Nietzsche spoke of &quot;monumental history&quot;. As destruction of monumental history, vandalism was assured a long life (as Herostratus proved): Performance art could make such a claim, as well as Hakim Bey&#x27;s &quot;poetic terrorism&quot; or &quot;Destroy 2000 Years of Culture&quot; from Atari Teenage Riot. Gustave Courbet&#x27;s declaration stated:

&quot;Attendu que la colonne Vendôme est un monument dénué de toute valeur artistique, tendant à perpétuer par son expression les idées de guerre et de conquête qui étaient dans la dynastie impériale, mais que réprouve le sentiment d&#x27;une nation républicaine, [le citoyen Courbet] émet le vœu que le gouvernement de la Défense nationale veuille bien l&#x27;autoriser à déboulonner cette colonne.&quot;

(&#x27;As the Vendôme column is a monument devoid of any artistic value, whose expression tends to perpetuate the ideas of war and conquest from the imperial dynasty, but that reject the sentiment of a republican nation, citizen Courbet declares that the government of National Defense should allow him to dismantle this column.)

Hence, painter Courbet justified the dismantlement of the Vendôme column on political grounds, downgrading its artistic value. Vandalism poses the problem of the value of art compared to life&#x27;s hardships: Courbet thought that the political values transmitted by this work of art neutralized its artistic value. His project was not followed; however, on 12 April 1871, the Commune voted to dismantle the imperial symbol, and the column was taken down on 8 May. After the assault on the Paris Commune by Adolphe Thiers, Gustave Courbet was condemned to pay part of the expenses.

In 1974, Norman Mailer glorified the art of vandalism in his essay &quot;The Faith of Graffiti&quot;, which likened tagging in New York City to the work of Giotto and Rauschenberg. New York Authorities responded by coating subway walls with Teflon paint, jailing taggers and requiring hardware stores to keep spray paint under lock and key.

Tags, designs, and styles of writing are commonplace on clothing, and are an influence on many of the corporate logos. Many skateparks and similar youth-oriented venues are decorated with commissioned graffiti-style artwork, and in many others patrons are welcome to leave their own. There is still, however, a fine line between vandalism as an artform, as a political statement, and as a crime. Bristol-born guerrilla artist Banksy&#x27;s claim is that official vandalism is far worse than that perpetrated by individuals, and that he is decorating buildings of no architectural merit.

=== Graphic design ===
Defacing could also be one of the techniques that many graphic designers use, by applying their own hand writing on a graphic itself. Sometimes the use of this technique might be mistaken as vandalism to the original work, as exemplified by the work of Stefan Sagmeister, including his Lou Reed CD cover. A unique use of the defacement technique is the CD cover for A.P.C. by Jean Touitou, where the designer wrote the title, volume number, and date with her own hand writing on the pre-print blank CD. Creative vandalism of this sort is not limited to writing and sketching. For example, the spraying on the KPIST album Golden coat for MNW Records by Sweden graphic uses gold spray, which may be considered an act of vandalism, but the customer may also appreciate the unicity of each cover that had been sprayed gold in different ways.
