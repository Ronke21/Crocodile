<text>Weightlifting (often known as Olympic weightlifting) is a competitive strength sport in which athletes compete in lifting a barbell loaded with weight plates from the ground to overhead, with the aim of successfully lifting the heaviest weights. Athletes compete in two specific ways of lifting the barbell overhead. The &quot;snatch&quot; is a wide-grip lift, in which the weighted barbell is lifted overhead in one motion. The &quot;clean and jerk&quot; is a combination lift, in which the weight is first taken from the ground to the front of the shoulders (the &quot;clean&quot;), and then from the shoulders to over the head (the &quot;jerk&quot;). The sport formerly included a third lift/event known as clean and press.

Each weightlifter gets three attempts at both the snatch and the clean and jerk, with the snatch attempted first. An athlete&#x27;s score is the combined total of the highest successfully-lifted weight in kilograms for each lift. Athletes compete in various weight classes, which are different for each sex and have changed over time.

Weightlifting is an Olympic sport, and has been contested in every Summer Olympic Games since 1920. While the sport is officially named &quot;weightlifting&quot;, the terms &quot;Olympic weightlifting&quot; and &quot;Olympic-style weightlifting&quot; are often used to distinguish it from the other sports and events that involve the lifting of weights, such as powerlifting, weight training, and strongman events. Similarly, the snatch and the clean and jerk are known as the &quot;Olympic lifts&quot;.

While other strength sports test limit of strength, Olympic-style weightlifting also tests limits of human power (explosive strength): the Olympic lifts are executed faster, and require more mobility and a greater range of motion during their execution, than other barbell lifts. The Olympic lifts, and their variations (e.g., power snatch, power clean) as well as components of the Olympic lifts (e.g., cleans, squats) are used by elite athletes in other sports to train for both explosive strength (power) and functional strength.

== Competition ==
The sport is competed at local, national, and international levels. The sport is governed internationally by the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF), which runs the World Weightlifting Championships each year.

=== Component lifts ===
The &quot;snatch&quot; is a lift wherein an athlete sweeps the barbell up and overhead in one fluid action: the lifter takes a wide-grip on the bar and pulls the barbell off the floor before rapidly re-bending their knees to get themself under the barbell (usually bringing themself into a deep overhead squat position), so that the barbell is supported over their head with arms outstretched. The &quot;snatch&quot; is then completed by the lifter rising to a standing position while holding the barbell overhead. The &quot;snatch&quot; demands precise balance.

The &quot;clean and jerk&quot; is a combination lift, in which the athlete gets the barbell overhead in two stages: first by lifting the barbell into support on the front of the shoulders, a position known as the front rack (&quot;the clean&quot;), and then lifting it from shoulders to overhead (&quot;the jerk&quot;). To perform the &quot;clean&quot;, the lifter takes a shoulder-width grip on the bar and pulls it off the floor, and then rapidly re-bends their knees (and bends their arms) to get their body under the barbell and &quot;catch&quot; the bar on the front of the shoulders (usually in a deep front squat position). The lifter finishes the &quot;clean&quot; by rising to a standing position while holding the barbell on the front of their shoulders. The lifter then uses the &quot;jerk&quot; to jump into a bent knees position (most commonly with one foot forward and the other back, a technique known as the &quot;split jerk&quot;) while pumping the barbell overhead&quot;.&quot; The &quot;jerk&quot; is completed when the lifter re-straightens the legs (bringing them together after a &quot;split jerk&quot;) so they come to a straight standing position with the barbell held overhead.

A third lift, the &quot;clean and press&quot;, was also a competition lift from 1924 through 1972. It entails a clean followed by an &quot;overhead press&quot;. The &quot;overhead press&quot; is distinguished from the &quot;jerk&quot;, in that jerking movements, bending of the legs, and displacement of the feet are prohibited. It was discontinued after 1972 due to difficulties in judging proper form.

=== Weight classes ===
Athletes compete in a division determined by their body mass. In summer 2018, the IWF approved the current weight categories, specifying which 7 of the 10 total would be contested at the 2020 Summer Olympics.

IWF Men&#x27;s weight classes:

Categories
*
*
*
* 
* and over (240 lb+)

Only five weight classes were chosen for Paris 2024:
*61 kg, 73 kg, 89 kg, 102 kg and over 102 kg.

IWF Women&#x27;s weight classes:

Categories
*
*
*
*
* and over (192 lb+)

Weight classes chosen for Paris 2024:
*49 kg, 59 kg, 71 kg, 81 kg and over 81 kg.

=== Official procedure ===
In each weight division, lifters compete in both the snatch and the clean and jerk. Prizes are usually given for the heaviest weights lifted in each and in the overall—the maximum lifts of both added. The order of the competition is up to the lifters—the competitor who chooses to attempt the lowest weight goes first. If they are unsuccessful at that weight, they have the option of reattempting at that weight or trying a heavier weight after any other competitors have made attempts at the previous weight or any other intermediate weights. The barbell is loaded incrementally and progresses to a heavier weight throughout the course of competition. Weights are set in 1-kilogram increments. If two athletes lift the same weight, they are both credited with it, but in terms of placing, the one who lifted the weight first gets the highest placing.

During competition, the snatch event takes place first, followed by a short intermission, and then the clean and jerk event. There are two side judges and one head referee who together provide a &quot;successful&quot; or &quot;failed&quot; result for each attempt based on their observation of the lift within the governing body&#x27;s rules and regulations. Two successes are required for any attempt to pass. Usually, the judges&#x27; and referee&#x27;s results are registered via a lighting system, with a white light indicating a &quot;successful&quot; lift and a red light indicating a &quot;failed&quot; lift. This is done for the benefit of all in attendance, be they athlete, coach, administrator, or audience. In addition, one or two technical officials may be present to advise during a ruling.

Lifters who fail to successfully complete at least one snatch and at least one clean and jerk fail to &quot;total&quot;, and receive an &quot;incomplete&quot; entry for the competition.

=== Local competition rules ===
At local competitions, a &quot;Best Lifter&quot; title is commonly awarded. It is awarded to both the best men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lifters. The award is based on a formula which employs the &quot;Sinclair coefficient&quot;, a coefficient derived and approved by the sport&#x27;s world governing body, which allows for differences in both gender and bodyweight. When the formula is applied to each lifter&#x27;s overall total and then grouped along with the other competitors&#x27; and evaluated, it provides a numeric result which determines the competition&#x27;s best overall men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lifters. And while, usually, the winner of the heaviest weight class will have lifted the most overall weight during the course of a competition, a lifter in a lighter weight class may still have lifted more weight both relative to their own bodyweight, and to the Sinclair coefficient formula, thereby garnering the &quot;Best Lifter&quot; award.

==History==
Competitions to establish who can lift the heaviest weight have been recorded throughout civilization, with the earliest known recordings including those found in Egypt, China, India, and Ancient Greece. 

=== Early international competitions ===
The international sport of weightlifting began with the First World Weightlifting Championships in 1891, in London, with Edward Lawrence Levy becoming the first world champion.

In 1896, the inaugural Olympic Games in Athens included weightlifting in the field event (the predecessor to today&#x27;s track and field or athletics event). In the early Olympic Games, a distinction was drawn between lifting with &#x27;one hand&#x27; only and lifting with &#x27;two hands&#x27;, and all competitors competed together regardless of their size and weight. The winner of the &#x27;one hand&#x27; competition in 1896 was Launceston Elliot of Scotland, while the winner of the &#x27;two hands&#x27; event was Viggo Jensen of Denmark.

Further World Weightlifting Championships followed in 1898 in Austria, 1899 in Milan, and 1903 in Paris, with the International Weightlifting Federation being founded in 1905.

Weightlifting was next contested at the Olympics in the 1904 Games (again in athletics), and at the 1906 Intercalated Games, but was omitted from the Games of 1900, 1908 and 1912 (1912 being the last Games until after the First World War).

=== Olympic Games 1920–1972 ===
In 1920, weightlifting returned to the Olympics and, for the first time, as an event in its own right – and weightlifting has been contested at every (summer) Olympics Games since. The 1920 Games took place at Antwerp in Belgium; and fourteen nations competed. The competition lifts were the &#x27;one hand&#x27; snatch, the &#x27;one hand&#x27; clean and jerk and the &#x27;two hands&#x27; clean and jerk. At the next Olympic Games, in Paris, in 1924, the &#x27;two hands&#x27; press and the &#x27;two hands&#x27; snatch were added to the program, making a total of five lifts; and weight classes were introduced for competitors, with weightlifters competing in five weight divisions.
In 1928, the sport dropped the &#x27;one hand&#x27; exercises, going forward with three &#x27;two hand&#x27; exercises: the &quot;snatch&quot;, the &quot;clean and press&quot;, and the &quot;clean and jerk&quot;.

The 1972 Olympics was the last Olympics featuring the &quot;clean and press&quot;, as difficulties in judging proper form led to it being dropped from subsequent competitions. Athletes, rather than &quot;strictly&quot; pressing the weight overhead with an upright torso, had been using their hips and leaning backward substantially. Some athletes were able to initiate the press with a hip thrust so rapid that judges found it difficult to determine whether or not they had utilized any knee bend to generate additional force, something strictly prohibited in the rules. Also prohibited was &quot;excessive layback&quot; (leaning back too much), but it was considered too difficult to determine what degree of layback constituted a rule violation. As a result, the &quot;clean and press&quot; was discontinued as a competition lift after 1972.

=== 1973–present ===
Since the 1973 World Weightlifting Championships, weightlifting competitions have been biathlons of the &quot;snatch&quot; and the &quot;clean and jerk,&quot; with the 1976 Olympics being the first Olympics in this format.

=== Women&#x27;s weightlifting ===
In 1987, women&#x27;s world championship events were included for the first time in IWF&#x27;s annual World Weightlifting Championships, with women such as Karyn Marshall (US) and Cai Jun (China) amongst the winners in that first year. Yet it was not until the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, that women&#x27;s weightlifting was incorporated into the Olympics. China&#x27;s Chen Yanqing became an early star of women&#x27;s weightlifting at the Olympics—as she won Olympic gold two games in a row, in 2004 and 2008.

In 2011, the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) ruled that athletes could wear a full body &quot;unitard&quot; under the customary weightlifting uniform. Kulsoom Abdullah became the first woman to do so at the U.S. National Championships that year, and athletes are allowed to do so at the Olympics. IWF rules previously stated that an athlete&#x27;s knees and elbows must be visible so officials can determine if a lift is correctly executed.

== Equipment ==
=== Barbell ===

Olympic weightlifting uses a steel bar (also known as a barbell) with larger-diameter rotating sleeves on either end, holding rubber-coated weight plates of different weights. This sleeve rotation is important for the Olympic lifts, particularly the snatch and clean movements, because it drastically reduces the rotational inertia of the bar. Without sleeve rotation, the Olympic lifter faces more challenging lifts and a greater risk of injury.

A men&#x27;s Olympic barbell weighs 20 kg (44 lbs) with a shaft diameter of 28 mm and a length of 2200 mm, whereas a women&#x27;s Olympic barbell weighs 15 kg (33 lbs) and has a shaft diameter of 25 mm with a length of 2010 mm. The distance between the sleeves, however, is the same for the men&#x27;s and the women&#x27;s bars at 1310 mm. The grip texture of the bar is called the knurling, and is distributed differently between the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s bars: the men&#x27;s has knurling in the center but the women&#x27;s does not. The Olympic barbells used in competition are certified by the IWF.

=== Bumper plates ===
The weight plates, typically referred to as &quot;bumper plates&quot; because of their rubber coated design, weigh between 10 kg and 25 kg in 5 kg increments. The bumper plates are coated with rubber to allow the weights to be dropped from various heights—either after a successful lift or during an unsuccessful one. Olympic bumper plates conform to international standards for coloring. That is, 10 kg is green, 15 kg is yellow, 20 kg is blue, and 25 kg is red.

=== Competition iron plates ===
In addition to the rubber bumpers, smaller competition iron plates can be used to add weight in small increments to the bar. The color designations for these iron plates are as follows: 1 kg is green, 1.5 kg is yellow, 2 kg is blue, 2.5 kg is red, 5 kg and 0.5 kg are white. It is useful to note the color assignment of these iron plates is consistent with the heavier bumper plates (i.e. 1 kg and 10 kg are green, 1.5 kg and 15 kg are yellow, etc.).

=== Collars ===

Weight plates are secured to the bar using collars on each side that weigh exactly 2.5 kg each.

=== Singlet ===
Lifters typically wear a one-piece close-fitting leotard often called a singlet. The wearing of a T-shirt underneath the singlet is optional.

=== Belt ===
A weightlifting belt of 120 mm maximum width may also be worn to increase intra-abdominal pressure.

=== Chalk ===
Chalk is regularly used by Olympic lifters, generally prior to each attempt at a lift. Lifters rub their hands with the chalk to promote dryness and prevent the bar moving in their hands.

=== Tape ===
Olympic lifters frequently use tape to cover the areas of their bodies exposed to friction while completing Olympic lifts. Tape is most commonly found on the Olympic lifter&#x27;s thumb. A taped thumb not only lessens the risk of calluses, but it also reduces the pain associated with the hook grip.

Olympic lifters also tape their wrists, preventing exaggerated and uncomfortable joint movement during lifts. For particularly heavy overhead lifts, a taped wrist enables the lifter to regulate wrist extension and delimit the translation of the radius and ulna distal heads. However, while taped wrists can prevent wrist and forearm injuries in the short-term, excessive use can lead to weakened connective tissue in the area, increasing the risk of pain and injury.

=== Shoes ===
The type of shoes worn by Olympic weightlifters is perhaps their most distinctive piece of equipment. Weightlifting shoes are typically designed with a raised heel of 0.5&quot; to 1.5&quot; and one or two metatarsal straps that tighten across the instep of the shoe. The raised heel helps the lifter maintain an upright torso while catching the bar and also allows for a deeper squat under the bar. The soles of the shoes are also quite rigid, helping to resist compression while under heavy loads. The shoes are designed for maximum stability while remaining flexible in the toe box. This allows the lifter to come up on the toes and to catch the weight on the ball of the back foot during the &quot;jerk&quot; movement of the lift.

There are also different heel constructions. Most modern Weightlifting shoes use a hard TPU plastic heel that does not deform and is more durable than other materials. However, there has been a resurgence in premium shoes using retro wood heels which are hard but do not last as long.

Knee sleeves

Some weightlifters may use knee sleeves to provide joint support and assist in standing from the deep squatting position. 

Wrist wraps

Wrist wraps are commonly used to provide support to the joint.

<doc id="33622" wikidata="Q41644" url="?curid=33622" title="Warsaw Pact">
<text>The Warsaw Pact (WP), formally the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance (TFCMA), was a collective defense treaty signed in Warsaw, Poland, between the Soviet Union and seven other Eastern Bloc socialist republics of Central and Eastern Europe in May 1955, during the Cold War. The term &quot;Warsaw Pact&quot; commonly refers to both the treaty itself and its resultant military alliance, the Warsaw Treaty Organization (WTO) (also known as ‘Warsaw Pact Organisation’ (‘WPO’)). The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon), the economic organization for the Eastern Bloc states.

Dominated by the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact was established as a balance of power or counterweight to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Western Bloc. There was no direct military confrontation between the two organizations; instead, the conflict was fought on an ideological basis and through proxy wars. Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact led to the expansion of military forces and their integration into the respective blocs. The Warsaw Pact&#x27;s largest military engagement was the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, its own member state, in August 1968 (with the participation of all pact nations except Albania and Romania), which, in part, resulted in Albania withdrawing from the pact less than one month later. The pact began to unravel with the spread of the Revolutions of 1989 through the Eastern Bloc, beginning with the Solidarity movement in Poland, its electoral success in June 1989 and the Pan-European Picnic in August 1989.

East Germany withdrew from the pact following German reunification in 1990. On 25 February 1991, at a meeting in Hungary, the pact ceased to exist via joint declaration by the defense and foreign ministers of the six remaining member states. The USSR itself was dissolved in December 1991, although most of the former Soviet republics formed the Collective Security Treaty Organization shortly thereafter. In the following 20 years, the Warsaw Pact countries outside the USSR each joined NATO (East Germany through its reunification with West Germany; and the Czech Republic and Slovakia as separate countries), as did the Baltic states.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Before the creation of the Warsaw Pact, the Czechoslovak leadership, fearful of a rearmed Germany, sought to create a security pact with East Germany and Poland. These states protested strongly against the re-militarization of West Germany. The Warsaw Pact was put in place as a consequence of the rearming of West Germany inside NATO. Soviet leaders, like many European leaders on both sides of the Iron Curtain, feared Germany being once again a military power and a direct threat. The consequences of German militarism remained a fresh memory among the Soviets and Eastern Europeans. As the Soviet Union already had an armed presence and political domination all over its eastern satellite states by 1955, the pact has been long considered &quot;superfluous&quot;, and because of the rushed way in which it was conceived, NATO officials labeled it a &quot;cardboard castle&quot;.

The USSR, fearing the restoration of German militarism in West Germany, had suggested in 1954 that it join NATO, but this was rejected by the US.

The Soviet request to join NATO arose in the aftermath of the Berlin Conference of January–February 1954. Soviet foreign minister Molotov made proposals to have Germany reunified and elections for a pan-German government, under conditions of withdrawal of the four powers&#x27; armies and German neutrality, but all were refused by the other foreign ministers, Dulles (US), Eden (UK), and Bidault (France). Proposals for the reunification of Germany were nothing new: earlier on 20 March 1952, talks about a German reunification, initiated by the so-called &#x27;Stalin Note&#x27;, ended after the United Kingdom, France, and the United States insisted that a unified Germany should not be neutral and should be free to join the European Defence Community (EDC) and rearm. James Dunn (US), who met in Paris with Eden, Konrad Adenauer (West Germany), and Robert Schuman (France), affirmed that &quot;the object should be to avoid discussion with the Russians and to press on the European Defense Community&quot;. According to John Gaddis, &quot;there was little inclination in Western capitals to explore this offer&quot; from the USSR, while historian Rolf Steininger asserts that Adenauer&#x27;s conviction that &quot;neutralization means sovietization&quot;, referring to the Soviet Union&#x27;s policies towards Finland known as finlandization, was the main factor in the rejection of the Soviet proposals. Adenauer also feared that German unification might have resulted in the end of the CDU&#x27;s leading political role in the West German Bundestag.

Consequently, Molotov, fearing that the EDC would be directed in the future against the USSR and &quot;seeking to prevent the formation of groups of European States directed against the other European States&quot;, made a proposal for a General European Treaty on Collective Security in Europe &quot;open to all European States without regard to their social systems&quot;, which would have included the unified Germany (thus rendering the EDC obsolete). But Eden, Dulles, and Bidault opposed the proposal.

One month later, the proposed European Treaty was rejected not only by supporters of the EDC, but also by Western opponents of the European Defence Community (like French Gaullist leader Gaston Palewski) who perceived it as &quot;unacceptable in its present form because it excludes the USA from participation in the collective security system in Europe&quot;. The Soviets then decided to make a new proposal to the governments of the US, UK, and France to accept the participation of the US in the proposed General European Agreement. As another argument deployed against the Soviet proposal was that it was perceived by Western powers as &quot;directed against the North Atlantic Pact and its liquidation&quot;, the Soviets decided to declare their &quot;readiness to examine jointly with other interested parties the question of the participation of the USSR in the North Atlantic bloc&quot;, specifying that &quot;the admittance of the USA into the General European Agreement should not be conditional on the three Western powers agreeing to the USSR joining the North Atlantic Pact&quot;.
Again, all Soviet proposals, including the request to join NATO, were rejected by the UK, US, and French governments shortly after. Emblematic was the position of British General Hastings Ismay, a fierce supporter of NATO expansion. He opposed the request to join NATO made by the USSR in 1954 saying that &quot;the Soviet request to join NATO is like an unrepentant burglar requesting to join the police force&quot;.

In April 1954, Adenauer made his first visit to the United States, meeting Nixon, Eisenhower, and Dulles. Ratification of the EDC was delayed but the US representatives made it clear to Adenauer that the EDC would have to become a part of NATO.

Memories of the Nazi occupation were still strong, and the rearmament of Germany was feared by France too. On 30 August 1954, the French Parliament rejected the EDC, thus ensuring its failure and blocking a major objective of US policy towards Europe: to associate West Germany militarily with the West. The US Department of State started to elaborate alternatives: West Germany would be invited to join NATO or, in the case of French obstructionism, strategies to circumvent a French veto would be implemented in order to obtain German rearmament outside NATO.

On 23 October 1954, the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany to the North Atlantic Pact was finally decided. The incorporation of West Germany into the organization on 9 May 1955 was described as &quot;a decisive turning point in the history of our continent&quot; by Halvard Lange, Foreign Affairs Minister of Norway at the time. In November 1954, the USSR requested a new European Security Treaty, in order to make a final attempt to not have a remilitarized West Germany potentially opposed to the Soviet Union, with no success.

On 14 May 1955, the USSR and seven other Eastern European countries &quot;reaffirming their desire for the establishment of a system of European collective security based on the participation of all European states irrespective of their social and political systems&quot; established the Warsaw Pact in response to the integration of the Federal Republic of Germany into NATO, declaring that: &quot;a remilitarized Western Germany and the integration of the latter in the North-Atlantic bloc [...] increase the danger of another war and constitutes a threat to the national security of the peaceable states; [...] in these circumstances the peaceable European states must take the necessary measures to safeguard their security&quot;.

One of the founding members, East Germany, was allowed to re-arm by the Soviet Union and the National People&#x27;s Army was established as the armed forces of the country to counter the rearmament of West Germany.

The USSR concentrated on its own recovery, seizing and transferring most of Germany&#x27;s industrial plants, and it exacted war reparations from East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises. It also instituted trading arrangements deliberately designed to favour the country. Moscow controlled the Communist parties that ruled the satellite states, and they followed orders from the Kremlin. Historian Mark Kramer concludes: &quot;The net outflow of resources from eastern Europe to the Soviet Union was approximately $15 billion to $20 billion in the first decade after World War II, an amount roughly equal to the total aid provided by the United States to western Europe under the Marshall Plan.&quot;

In November 1956, Soviet forces invaded Hungary, a Warsaw Pact member state, and violently put down the Hungarian Revolution. After that, the USSR made bilateral 20-year-treaties with Poland (17 December 1956), the GDR (12 March 1957), Romania (15 April 1957; Soviet forces were later removed as part of Romania&#x27;s de-satellization), and Hungary (27 May 1957), ensuring that Soviet troops were deployed in these countries.

===Members===
The founding signatories of the Pact consisted of the following communist governments:
* People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania (withheld support in 1961 because of the Albanian–Soviet split, but formally withdrew on 13 September 1968)
* People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria
* Czechoslovak Socialist Republic
* (German Democratic Republic; officially withdrew on 24 September 1990 in preparation for German reunification, with Soviet consent and a &quot;remarkable yet hardly noticed&quot; ceremony, ceasing to exist altogether at midnight on 3 October)
* Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic (temporarily withdrew from 1–4 November 1956 during the Hungarian Revolution)
* Polish People&#x27;s Republic
* Socialist Republic of Romania (the only independent permanent non-Soviet member of the Warsaw Pact, having freed itself from its Soviet satellite status by the early 1960s)

=== Observers ===
: In July 1963, the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic asked to join the Warsaw Pact under Article 9 of the treaty. Due to the emerging Sino-Soviet split, Mongolia remained in an observer status. In what was the first instance of a Soviet initiative being blocked by a non-Soviet member of the Warsaw Pact, Romania blocked Mongolia&#x27;s accession to the Warsaw Pact. The Soviet government agreed to station troops in Mongolia in 1966.

At first, China, North Korea, and North Vietnam had observer status, but China withdrew in 1961 as a consequence of the Albanian-Soviet split, in which China backed Albania against the USSR as part of the larger Sino-Soviet split of the early 1960s.

===During the Cold War===


For 36 years, NATO and the Warsaw Pact never directly waged war against each other in Europe; the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies implemented strategic policies aimed at the containment of each other in Europe, while working and fighting for influence within the wider Cold War on the international stage. These included the Korean War, Vietnam War, Bay of Pigs invasion, Dirty War, Cambodian–Vietnamese War, and others.

In 1956, following the declaration of the Imre Nagy government of the withdrawal of Hungary from the Warsaw Pact, Soviet troops entered the country and removed the government. Soviet forces crushed the nationwide revolt, leading to the death of an estimated 2,500 Hungarian citizens.

The multi-national Communist armed forces&#x27; sole joint action was the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, another Warsaw Pact member state, in August 1968. All member countries, with the exception of the Socialist Republic of Romania and the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania, participated in the invasion. The German Democratic Republic provided only minimal support. (Albania withdrew from the pact one month after this intervention.)

In April 1985, the leaders of Warsaw Pact members met in Warsaw where they renewed the alliance for thirty years.

===End of the Cold War===

In 1989, popular civil and political public discontent toppled the Communist governments of the Warsaw Treaty countries. The beginning of the end of the Warsaw Pact, regardless of military power, was the Pan-European Picnic in August 1989. The event, which goes back to an idea by Otto von Habsburg, caused the mass exodus of GDR citizens and the media-informed population of Eastern Europe felt the loss of power of their rulers and the Iron Curtain broke down completely. Though Poland&#x27;s new Solidarity government under Lech Wałęsa initially assured the Soviets that it would remain in the Pact, this broke the brackets of Eastern Europe, which could no longer be held together militarily by the Warsaw Pact. Independent national politics made feasible with the &quot;perestroika&quot; and liberal &quot;glasnost&quot; policies revealed shortcomings and failures (i.e. of the soviet-type economic planning model) and induced institutional collapse of the Communist government in the USSR in 1991. From 1989 to 1991, Communist governments were overthrown in Albania, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union.

As the last acts of the Cold War were playing out, several Warsaw Pact states (Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary) participated in the US-led coalition effort to liberate Kuwait in the Gulf War.

On 25 February 1991, the Warsaw Pact was declared disbanded at a meeting of defence and foreign ministers from remaining Pact countries meeting in Hungary. On 1 July 1991, in Prague, the Czechoslovak President Václav Havel formally ended the 1955 Warsaw Treaty Organization of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance and so disestablished the Warsaw Treaty after 36 years of military alliance with the USSR. The USSR disestablished itself in December 1991.

==Structure==
The Warsaw Treaty&#x27;s organization was two-fold: the Political Consultative Committee handled political matters, and the Combined Command of Pact Armed Forces controlled the assigned multi-national forces, with headquarters in Warsaw, Poland.

Although an apparently similar collective security alliance, the Warsaw Pact differed substantially from NATO. De jure, the eight-member countries of the Warsaw Pact pledged the mutual defense of any member who would be attacked; relations among the treaty signatories were based upon mutual non-intervention in the internal affairs of the member countries, respect for national sovereignty, and political independence.

However, de facto, the Pact was a direct reflection of the USSR&#x27;s authoritarianism and undisputed domination over the Eastern Bloc, in the context of the so-called Soviet Empire, which was not comparable to that of the United States over the Western Bloc. All Warsaw Pact commanders had to be, and have been, senior officers of the Soviet Union at the same time and appointed for an unspecified term length: the Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization, which commanded and controlled all the military forces of the member countries, was also a First Deputy Minister of Defence of the USSR, and the Chief of Combined Staff of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization was also a First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces. On the contrary, the Secretary General of NATO and Chair of the NATO Military Committee are positions with fixed term of office held on a random rotating basis by officials from all member countries through consensus.

Despite the American hegemony (mainly military and economic) over NATO, all decisions of the North Atlantic Alliance required unanimous consensus in the North Atlantic Council and the entry of countries into the alliance was not subject to domination but rather a natural democratic process. In the Warsaw Pact, decisions were ultimately taken by the Soviet Union alone; the countries of the Warsaw Pact were not equally able to negotiate their entry in the Pact nor the decisions taken.

Although nominally a &quot;defensive&quot; alliance, the Pact&#x27;s primary function was to safeguard the Soviet Union&#x27;s hegemony over its Eastern European satellites, with the Pact&#x27;s only direct military actions having been the invasions of its own member states to keep them from breaking away.

===Romania and Albania===
Romania and (until 1968) Albania were exceptions. Together with Yugoslavia, which broke with the Soviet Union before the Warsaw Pact was created, these three countries completely rejected the Soviet doctrine formulated for the Pact. Albania officially left the organization in 1968, in protest of its invasion of Czechoslovakia. Romania had its own reasons for remaining a formal member of the Warsaw Pact, such as Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s interest of preserving the threat of a Pact invasion so he could sell himself as a nationalist, as well as privileged access to NATO counterparts and a seat at various European forums which otherwise he would not have had (for instance, Romania and the Soviet-led remainder of the Warsaw Pact formed two distinct groups in the elaboration of the Helsinki Final Act). When Andrei Grechko assumed command of the Warsaw Pact, both Romania and Albania had for all practical purposes defected from the Pact. In the early 1960s, Grechko initiated programs meant to preempt Romanian doctrinal heresies from spreading to other Pact members. Romania&#x27;s doctrine of territorial defense threatened the Pact&#x27;s unity and cohesion. No other country succeeded in escaping from the Warsaw Pact like Romania and Albania did. For example, the mainstays of Romania&#x27;s tank forces were locally developed models. Soviet troops were deployed to Romania for the last time in 1963, as part of a Warsaw Pact exercise. After 1964, the Soviet Army was barred from returning to Romania, as the country refused to take part in joint Pact exercises.

Even before the advent of Nicolae Ceaușescu, Romania was in fact an independent country, as opposed to the rest of the Warsaw Pact. To some extent, it was even more independent than Cuba (a communist Soviet-aligned state that was not a member of the Warsaw Pact). The Romanian regime was largely impervious to Soviet political influence, and Ceaușescu was the only declared opponent of &quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot;. On account of the contentious relationship between Bucharest and Moscow, the West did not hold the Soviet Union responsible for the policies pursued by Bucharest. This was not the case for the other countries in the region, such as Czechoslovakia and Poland. At the start of 1990, the Soviet foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, implicitly confirmed the lack of Soviet influence over Ceaușescu&#x27;s Romania. When asked whether it made sense for him to visit Romania less than two weeks after its revolution, Shevardnadze insisted that only by going in person to Romania could he figure out how to &quot;restore Soviet influence&quot;.

Romania requested and obtained the complete withdrawal of the Soviet Army from its territory in 1958. The Romanian campaign for independence culminated on 22 April 1964 when the Romanian Communist Party issued a declaration proclaiming that: &quot;Every Marxist–Leninist Party has a sovereign right...to elaborate, choose or change the forms and methods of socialist construction.&quot; and &quot;There exists no &quot;parent&quot; party and &quot;offspring&quot; party, no &quot;superior&quot; and &quot;subordinated&quot; parties, but only the large family of communist and workers&#x27; parties having equal rights.&quot; and also &quot;there are not and there can be no unique patterns and recipes&quot;. This amounted to a declaration of political and ideological independence from Moscow.

Following Albania&#x27;s withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, Romania remained the only Pact member with an independent military doctrine which denied the Soviet Union use of its armed forces and avoided absolute dependence on Soviet sources of military equipment. Romania was the only non-Soviet Warsaw Pact member which was not obliged to militarily defend the Soviet Union in case of an armed attack. Bulgaria and Romania were the only Warsaw Pact members that did not have Soviet troops stationed on their soil. In December 1964, Romania became the only Warsaw Pact member (save Albania, which would leave the Pact altogether within 4 years) from which all Soviet advisors were withdrawn, including those in the intelligence and security services. Not only did Romania not participate in joint operations with the KGB, but it also set up &quot;departments specialized in anti-KGB counterespionage&quot;.

Romania was neutral in the Sino-Soviet split. Its neutrality in the Sino-Soviet dispute along with being the small Communist country with the most influence in global affairs enabled Romania to be recognized by the world as the &quot;third force&quot; of the Communist world. Romania&#x27;s independence – achieved in the early 1960s through its freeing from its Soviet satellite status – was tolerated by Moscow because Romania was not bordering the Iron Curtain – being surrounded by socialist states – and because its ruling party was not going to abandon communism.

Although certain historians such as Robert R. King and Dennis Deletant argue against the usage of the term &quot;independent&quot; to describe Romania&#x27;s relations with the Soviet Union, favoring &quot;autonomy&quot; instead on account of the country&#x27;s continued membership within both the Comecon and the Warsaw Pact along with its commitment to socialism, this approach fails to explain why in July 1963 Romania blocked Mongolia&#x27;s accession to the Warsaw Pact, why in November 1963 Romania voted in favor of a UN resolution to establish a nuclear-free zone in Latin America when the other Soviet-aligned countries abstained, or why in 1964 Romania opposed the Soviet-proposed &quot;strong collective riposte&quot; against China (and these are examples solely from the 1963–1964 period). Soviet disinformation tried to convince the West that Ceaușescu&#x27;s empowerment was a dissimulation in connivance with Moscow. To an extent this worked, as some historians came to see the hand of Moscow behind every Romanian initiative. For instance, when Romania became the only Eastern European country to maintain diplomatic relations with Israel, some historians have speculated that this was at Moscow&#x27;s whim. However, this theory fails upon closer inspection. Even during the Cold War, some thought that Romanian actions were done at the behest of the Soviets, but Soviet anger at said actions was &quot;persuasively genuine&quot;. In truth, the Soviets were not beyond publicly aligning themselves with the West against the Romanians at times.

== Strategy ==
The strategy behind the formation of the Warsaw Pact was driven by the desire of the Soviet Union to prevent Central and Eastern Europe being used as a base for its enemies. Its policy was also driven by ideological and geostrategic reasons. Ideologically, the Soviet Union arrogated the right to define socialism and communism and act as the leader of the global socialist movement. A corollary to this was the necessity of military intervention if a country appeared to be &quot;violating&quot; core socialist ideas, i.e. breaking away from the Soviet sphere of influence, explicitly stated in the Brezhnev Doctrine.

==Post–Warsaw Pact==
On 12 March 1999, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland joined NATO; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia joined in March 2004; Croatia and Albania joined on 1 April 2009.

The USSR&#x27;s successor Russia and some other post-Soviet states joined the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) in 1992, and the Shanghai Five in 1996, which was renamed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) after Uzbekistan&#x27;s addition in 2001.

In November 2005, the Polish government opened its Warsaw Treaty archives to the Institute of National Remembrance, which published some 1,300 declassified documents in January 2006, yet the Polish government reserved publication of 100 documents, pending their military declassification. Eventually, 30 of the reserved 100 documents were published; 70 remained secret and unpublished. Among the documents published was the Warsaw Treaty&#x27;s nuclear war plan, &quot;Seven Days to the River Rhine&quot; – a short, swift invasion and capture of Austria, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands east of the Rhine, using nuclear weapons after a supposed NATO first strike.

<doc id="33623" wikidata="Q376040" url="?curid=33623" title="Wakeboarding">
<text>Wakeboarding is a water sport in which the rider, standing on a wakeboard (a board with foot bindings), is towed behind a motorboat across its wake and especially up off the crest in order to perform aerial maneuvers. A hallmark of wakeboarding is the attempted performance of midair tricks. Wakeboarding was developed from a combination of water skiing, snowboarding and surfing techniques.

The rider is usually towed by a rope behind a boat, but can also be towed by cable systems and winches, and be pulled by other motorized vehicles like personal watercraft, cars, trucks, and all-terrain vehicles. The gear and wakeboard boat used are often personalized to each rider&#x27;s liking.

Though natural watercourses such as rivers, lakes and areas of open water are generally used in wakeboarding, it is possible to wakeboard in unconventional locations, such as flooded roads and car parks, using a car as the towing vehicle.

Wakeboarding is done for pleasure and competition, ranging from freestyle wakeboarding and wakeboard parks to wakeboard competitions at the X Games, WWA Wakeboard World Championships, or similar events. Though it had an obscure start, it is now the world&#x27;s fastest-growing water sport.

==History==

=== Mono Water Ski ===
The sport that would later become wake boarding began as water-skiing with mono water skis (single water skis) in the USA around 1950. The main difference between mono water skis and contemporary wake boards is the shape of the board and the stance. 

==== Surfboards as Mono ski ====
Wake surfing - using surfboards as mono water skis - began picking up traction around 1964, where it was seen as an &quot;exciting new sport that&#x27;s soon going to sweep the waterways.&quot; Although surfboards were originally used, boards without straps or bindings were first seen in New Zealand with boards called &quot;skurfboards&quot;. Eventually, wake boards with bindings or straps were sold in Australia under the name &quot;McSkis&quot;. Later, another company called &quot;Skurfer&quot; was founded by Tony Finn in 1985, named as such due to the board being a cross of a surfboard and a water ski. The first board made in the early 1990&#x27;s was the Hyper lite board by the O’Brien company, a water ski manufacturer who marketed the board as a “compression-molded neutral-buoyancy wake board.” This was followed by a variety of boards that are curvier and more compact, creating a smoother ride.

The wake board rope has advanced over the years with improvements in the material makeup. When wakeboarding first started, wakeboarders used ski rope, which was made with stretchy cloth or plastic ropes. The latter soon grew in popularity, and a braided rope made out of polypropylene was eventually introduced. A few years later, a rope that was less stretchy was invented that gave the rider a more consistent pull on the rope, though they were heavier and larger in diameter. Modern ropes are coated with Spectra and Dyneema, which decrease the stretch and drag of the rope.
==Equipment==

When wakeboarding, a wide variety of safety equipment is used. These include life vests or other buoyancy aids which prevent water-related injuries and deaths, as they keep the wearer buoyant until they are picked up. These vests especially help in situations where the rider is knocked unconscious or cannot tread water. Furthermore, wakeboarders use water-resistant helmets that are able to ventilate water so that the helmets do not fill up with water. Even the length of a wakeboarder&#x27;s rope is important in providing safety; if the rope is too long, a wakeboarder will land on the flat part of the wake instead of the downside, and their knees will buckle.

Wakeboards themselves are also important to consider when preparing to ride. Four of the most common wakeboard styles include the continuous rocker, the three-stage rocker, the five-stage rocker, and the hybrid rocker. Rocker refers to the curve of the board from head to tail and each type of board has a different placement and amount of curve that works best for different types of rides. The presence or absence of fins on the bottom of a board can also make a drastic difference in how it rides. Beginning riders are usually better off with deeper fins. Wakeboards can also vary in the amount of fins they have which can be up to 5. Fins will make it easier to turn and stay level for beginners but should be removed for tricks and spins since they can make it easier to catch an edge on a jump or during a spin. Another part of the wakeboard itself to consider is the size of the board and the material, which are usually a wood or foam core with a fiber glass or carbon fiber coating.

At the same time, the length of a wakeboarding rope will vary based on the rider&#x27;s preferences. Beginner ropes usually go from about 50’ to 75’ in total length, while more advanced riders will want a rope that goes from 65’ to 85’. A longer rope may allow for more preparation and momentum before performing tricks, whereas a shorter rope may require less speed and height to travel between wakes.
In addition to this, the material of the rope being used can make a significant difference in ride experience. The less stretch in the rope, the better it is for the rider to learn how to ride and do various tricks. Some of the best rope materials include Dyneema, Poly E, and Spectra. Each of these is known for its abrasion resistance, affordability and absorption, and durability respectively.

==Tricks==

When wakeboarding, a variety of tricks may be attempted. Most of these stem from the wakeboarder adjusting their posture, edge, and distribution of weight so as to fly into the air upon hitting the wake. Various tricks include the toeside edge, the heelside edge, the ride switch, and the 180° spin.

More advanced tricks call for what is known as inversion or “inverts”. An invert is considered any action where the board is above the head of the rider. This does not necessarily mean the rider is fully upside down, as evidenced by the Raley, a trick where the rider extends their body parallel to the water bending at the knees to achieve inversion.
The heel side backflip, otherwise known as a tantrum, is often regarded as the first and easiest invert to learn as an intermediate level rider. This is because the shape of the wake or the “kicker” (a type of floating ramp, used primarily at cable parks, that mimics the shape of a wake) naturally initiates the sequence of motions that are necessary to complete the trick.

==Community==
There are many different ways that people are engaged in this sport. Popular brands like Byerly, Hyperlight, O&#x27;Brien and Ronix provide ever evolving technology and equipment as well as quality advice for new and seasoned riders alike. Some of these brands also have active social media presence to reach more people and get them into the sport.

=== Relationship to Kitesurfing ===
Many movements and tricks in wakeboarding bear close resemblance to moves also found in kitesurfing. This is reflected in close similarities between wakeboards and twin-tip kitesurf-boards. Wakeboarding in wake and waterski parks is thus often considered a more approachable wind condition independent alternative to kitesurfing and has seen a surge in popularity in parallel to kitesurfing, especially in densely populated areas in Europe, such as Germany.

<text>In nuclear physics and particle physics, the weak interaction, also called the weak force, is one of the four known fundamental interactions, with the others being electromagnetism, the strong interaction, and gravitation. It is the mechanism of interaction between subatomic particles that is responsible for the radioactive decay of atoms: The weak interaction participates in nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. The theory describing its behaviour and effects is sometimes called quantum flavordynamics (QFD); however, the term QFD is rarely used, because the weak force is better understood by electroweak theory (EWT).

The effective range of the weak force is limited to subatomic distances and is less than the diameter of a proton.

== Background ==

The Standard Model of particle physics provides a uniform framework for understanding electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions. An interaction occurs when two particles (typically, but not necessarily, half-integer spin fermions) exchange integer-spin, force-carrying bosons. The fermions involved in such exchanges can be either elementary (e.g. electrons or quarks) or composite (e.g. protons or neutrons), although at the deepest levels, all weak interactions ultimately are between elementary particles.

In the weak interaction, fermions can exchange three types of force carriers, namely , , and  bosons. The masses of these bosons are far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of the weak force. In fact, the force is termed &quot;weak&quot; because its field strength over any set distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the electromagnetic force, which itself is further orders of magnitude less than the strong nuclear force.

The weak interaction is the only fundamental interaction that breaks parity symmetry, and similarly, but far more rarely, the only interaction to break charge–parity symmetry.

Quarks, which make up composite particles like neutrons and protons, come in six &quot;flavours&quot; up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom which give those composite particles their properties. The weak interaction is unique in that it allows quarks to swap their flavour for another. The swapping of those properties is mediated by the force carrier bosons. For example, during beta-minus decay, a down quark within a neutron is changed into an up quark, thus converting the neutron to a proton and resulting in the emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino. 

Weak interaction is important in the fusion of hydrogen into helium in a star. This is because it can convert a proton (hydrogen) into a neutron to form deuterium which is important for the continuation of nuclear fusion to form helium. The accumulation of neutrons facilitates the buildup of heavy nuclei in a star.

Most fermions decay by a weak interaction over time. Such decay makes radiocarbon dating possible, as carbon-14 decays through the weak interaction to nitrogen-14. It can also create radioluminescence, commonly used in tritium luminescence, and in the related field of betavoltaics (but &quot;not&quot; similar to radium luminescence).

The electroweak force is believed to have separated into the electromagnetic and weak forces during the quark epoch of the early universe.

== History ==
In 1933, Enrico Fermi proposed the first theory of the weak interaction, known as Fermi&#x27;s interaction. He suggested that beta decay could be explained by a four-fermion interaction, involving a contact force with no range.

In the mid-1950s, Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee first suggested that the handedness of the spins of particles in weak interaction might violate the conservation law or symmetry. In 1957, Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators confirmed the symmetry violation.

In the 1960s, Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg unified the electromagnetic force and the weak interaction by showing them to be two aspects of a single force, now termed the electroweak force.

The existence of the and  bosons was not directly confirmed until 1983.

== Properties ==

The electrically charged weak interaction is unique in a number of respects:
* It is the only interaction that can change the flavour of quarks and leptons (i.e., of changing one type of quark into another).
* It is the only interaction that violates P, or parity symmetry. It is also the only one that violates charge–parity (CP) symmetry.
* Both the electrically charged and the electrically neutral interactions are mediated (propagated) by force carrier particles that have significant masses, an unusual feature which is explained in the Standard Model by the Higgs mechanism.

Due to their large mass (approximately 90 GeV/&quot;c&quot;2) these carrier particles, called the and  bosons, are short-lived with a lifetime of under  seconds. The weak interaction has a coupling constant (an indicator of how frequently interactions occur) between and , compared to the electromagnetic coupling constant of about and the strong interaction coupling constant of about 1; consequently the weak interaction is &quot;weak&quot; in terms of intensity. The weak interaction has a very short effective range (around to  m (0.01 to 0.1 fm)). At distances around  meters (0.001 fm), the weak interaction has an intensity of a similar magnitude to the electromagnetic force, but this starts to decrease exponentially with increasing distance. Scaled up by just one and a half orders of magnitude, at distances of around 3 m, the weak interaction becomes 10,000 times weaker.

The weak interaction affects all the fermions of the Standard Model, as well as the Higgs boson; neutrinos interact only through gravity and the weak interaction. The weak interaction does not produce bound states, nor does it involve binding energy something that gravity does on an astronomical scale, the electromagnetic force does at the molecular and atomic levels, and the strong nuclear force does only at the subatomic level, inside of nuclei.

Its most noticeable effect is due to its first unique feature: The charged weak interaction causes flavour change. For example, a neutron is heavier than a proton (its partner nucleon) and can decay into a proton by changing the flavour (type) of one of its two &quot;down&quot; quarks to an &quot;up&quot; quark. Neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit flavour changing, so this can only proceed by weak decay; without weak decay, quark properties such as strangeness and charm (associated with the strange quark and charm quark, respectively) would also be conserved across all interactions.

All mesons are unstable because of weak decay.
In the process known as beta decay, a &quot;down&quot; quark in the neutron can change into an &quot;up&quot; quark by emitting a virtual  boson, which then decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino. Another example is electron capture a common variant of radioactive decay wherein a proton and an electron within an atom interact and are changed to a neutron (an up quark is changed to a down quark), and an electron neutrino is emitted.

Due to the large masses of the W bosons, particle transformations or decays (e.g., flavour change) that depend on the weak interaction typically occur much more slowly than transformations or decays that depend only on the strong or electromagnetic forces.
For example, a neutral pion decays electromagnetically, and so has a life of only about  seconds. In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through the weak interaction, and so lives about  seconds, or a hundred million times longer than a neutral pion. A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15 minutes.

=== Weak isospin and weak hypercharge ===

All particles have a property called &quot;weak isospin&quot; (symbol ), which serves as an additive quantum number that restricts how the particle can interact with the of the weak force. Weak isospin plays the same role in the weak interaction with as electric charge does in electromagnetism, and color charge in the strong interaction; a different number with a similar name, &quot;weak charge&quot;, discussed below, is used for interactions with the . All left-handed fermions have a weak isospin value of either or ; all right-handed fermions have 0 isospin. For example, the up quark has and the down quark has . A quark never decays through the weak interaction into a quark of the same : Quarks with a of only decay into quarks with a of and conversely.
In any given strong, electromagnetic, or weak interaction, weak isospin is conserved: The sum of the weak isospin numbers of the particles entering the interaction equals the sum of the weak isospin numbers of the particles exiting that interaction. For example, a (left-handed) with a weak isospin of +1 normally decays into a (with ) and a (as a right-handed antiparticle, ).

For the development of the electroweak theory, another property, weak hypercharge, was invented, defined as
: formula_1
where is the weak hypercharge of a particle with electrical charge (in elementary charge units) and weak isospin . Weak hypercharge is the generator of the U(1) component of the electroweak gauge group; whereas some particles have a weak isospin of zero, all known spin- particles have a non-zero weak hypercharge.

== Interaction types ==
There are two types of weak interaction (called &quot;vertices&quot;). The first type is called the &quot;charged-current interaction&quot; because the &quot;weakly interacting&quot; fermions form a current with total &quot;electric&quot; charge that is nonzero. The second type is called the &quot;neutral-current interaction&quot; because the &quot;weakly interacting&quot; fermions form a current with total &quot;electric&quot; charge of zero. It is responsible for the (rare) deflection of neutrinos. The two types of interaction follow different selection rules. This naming convention is often misunderstood to label the electric charge of the and bosons, however the naming convention predates the concept of the mediator bosons, and clearly (at least in name) labels the charge of the current (formed from the fermions), not necessarily the bosons.

=== Charged-current interaction ===
In one type of charged current interaction, a charged lepton (such as an electron or a muon, having a charge of −1) can absorb a boson (a particle with a charge of +1) and be thereby converted into a corresponding neutrino (with a charge of 0), where the type (&quot;flavour&quot;) of neutrino (electron , muon , or tau ) is the same as the type of lepton in the interaction, for example:
: formula_2
Similarly, a down-type quark (, , or , with a charge of ) can be converted into an up-type quark (, , or , with a charge of ), by emitting a  boson or by absorbing a  boson. More precisely, the down-type quark becomes a quantum superposition of up-type quarks: that is to say, it has a possibility of becoming any one of the three up-type quarks, with the probabilities given in the CKM matrix tables. Conversely, an up-type quark can emit a  boson, or absorb a  boson, and thereby be converted into a down-type quark, for example:
: formula_3

The W boson is unstable so will rapidly decay, with a very short lifetime. For example:
: formula_4

Decay of a W boson to other products can happen, with varying probabilities.

In the so-called beta decay of a neutron (see picture, above), a down quark within the neutron emits a virtual boson and is thereby converted into an up quark, converting the neutron into a proton. Because of the limited energy involved in the process (i.e., the mass difference between the down quark and the up quark), the virtual boson can only carry sufficient energy to produce an electron and an electron-antineutrino – the two lowest-possible masses among its prospective decay products.
At the quark level, the process can be represented as:
: formula_5

=== Neutral-current interaction ===

In neutral current interactions, a quark or a lepton (e.g., an electron or a muon) emits or absorbs a neutral boson. For example:
: formula_6

Like the  bosons, the  boson also decays rapidly, for example:
: formula_7

Unlike the charged-current interaction, whose selection rules are strictly limited by chirality, electric charge, weak isospin, the neutral-current interaction can cause any two fermions in the standard model to deflect: Either particles or anti-particles, with any electric charge, and both left- and right-chirality, although the strength of the interaction differs.

The quantum number &quot;weak charge&quot; () serves the same role in the neutral current interaction with the that electric charge (, with no subscript) does in the electromagnetic interaction: It quantifies the vector part of the interaction. Its value is given by:
: formula_8
Since the weak mixing angle , the parenthetic expression , with its value varying slightly with the momentum difference (called &quot;running&quot;) between the particles involved. Hence 
: formula_9
since by convention , and for all fermions involved in the weak interaction . The weak charge of charged leptons is then close to zero, so these mostly interact with the  boson through the axial coupling.

== Electroweak theory ==

The Standard Model of particle physics describes the electromagnetic interaction and the weak interaction as two different aspects of a single electroweak interaction. This theory was developed around 1968 by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, and Steven Weinberg, and they were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work. The Higgs mechanism provides an explanation for the presence of three massive gauge bosons (, , , the three carriers of the weak interaction), and the photon (, the massless gauge boson that carries the electromagnetic interaction).

According to the electroweak theory, at very high energies, the universe has four components of the Higgs field whose interactions are carried by four massless scalar bosons forming a complex scalar Higgs field doublet. Likewise, there are four massless electroweak vector bosons, each similar to the photon. However, at low energies, this gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the symmetry of electromagnetism, since one of the Higgs fields acquires a vacuum expectation value. Naïvely, the symmetry-breaking would be expected to produce three massless bosons, but instead those &quot;extra&quot; three Higgs bosons become incorporated into the three weak bosons, which then acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism. These three composite bosons are the , , and  bosons actually observed in the weak interaction. The fourth electroweak gauge boson is the photon () of electromagnetism, which does not couple to any of the Higgs fields and so remains massless.

This theory has made a number of predictions, including a prediction of the masses of the and  bosons before their discovery and detection in 1983.

On 4 July 2012, the CMS and the ATLAS experimental teams at the Large Hadron Collider independently announced that they had confirmed the formal discovery of a previously unknown boson of mass between 125 and , whose behaviour so far was &quot;consistent with&quot; a Higgs boson, while adding a cautious note that further data and analysis were needed before positively identifying the new boson as being a Higgs boson of some type. By 14 March 2013, a Higgs boson was tentatively confirmed to exist.

In a speculative case where the electroweak symmetry breaking scale were lowered, the unbroken interaction would eventually become confining. Alternative models where becomes confining above that scale appear quantitatively similar to the Standard Model at lower energies, but dramatically different above symmetry breaking.

== Violation of symmetry ==

The laws of nature were long thought to remain the same under mirror reflection. The results of an experiment viewed via a mirror were expected to be identical to the results of a separately constructed, mirror-reflected copy of the experimental apparatus watched through the mirror. This so-called law of parity conservation was known to be respected by classical gravitation, electromagnetism and the strong interaction; it was assumed to be a universal law. However, in the mid-1950s Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this law. Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 discovered that the weak interaction violates parity, earning Yang and Lee the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Although the weak interaction was once described by Fermi&#x27;s theory, the discovery of parity violation and renormalization theory suggested that a new approach was needed. In 1957, Robert Marshak and George Sudarshan and, somewhat later, Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann proposed a V − A (vector minus axial vector or left-handed) Lagrangian for weak interactions. In this theory, the weak interaction acts only on left-handed particles (and right-handed antiparticles). Since the mirror reflection of a left-handed particle is right-handed, this explains the maximal violation of parity. The &quot;V − A&quot; theory was developed before the discovery of the Z boson, so it did not include the right-handed fields that enter in the neutral current interaction.

However, this theory allowed a compound symmetry CP to be conserved. CP combines parity P (switching left to right) with charge conjugation C (switching particles with antiparticles). Physicists were again surprised when in 1964, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence in kaon decays that &quot;CP&quot; symmetry could be broken too, winning them the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1973, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa showed that &quot;CP&quot; violation in the weak interaction required more than two generations of particles, effectively predicting the existence of a then unknown third generation. This discovery earned them half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Unlike parity violation, &quot;CP&quot; violation occurs only in rare circumstances. Despite its limited occurrence under present conditions, it is widely believed to be the reason that there is much more matter than antimatter in the universe, and thus forms one of Andrei Sakharov&#x27;s three conditions for baryogenesis.

<doc id="33632" wikidata="Q208663" url="?curid=33632" title="William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham">
<text>William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham (15 November 170811 May 1778) was a British Whig statesman who served as Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1766 to 1768. Historians call him &quot;Chatham&quot; or &quot;Pitt the Elder&quot; to distinguish him from his son William Pitt the Younger, who also served as prime minister. Pitt was also known as &quot;the Great Commoner&quot; because of his long-standing refusal to accept a title until 1766.

Pitt was a member of the British cabinet and with a brief interlude in 1757, its informal leader from 1756 to 1761, during the Seven Years&#x27; War (including the French and Indian War in the American colonies). He again led the ministry, holding the official title of Lord Privy Seal, between 1766 and 1768. Much of his power came from his brilliant oratory. He was out of power for most of his career and became well-known for his attacks on the government, such as those on Walpole&#x27;s corruption in the 1730s, Hanoverian subsidies in the 1740s, peace with France in the 1760s, and the policy toward the American colonies during the 1770s.

Pitt is best known as the wartime political leader of Britain during the Seven Years&#x27; War, especially for his single-minded devotion to victory over France, a victory that ultimately solidified Britain&#x27;s dominance over world affairs. He is also known for his popular appeal, his opposition to corruption in government, his support for the American position in the run-up to the American Revolutionary War, his advocacy of British greatness, expansionism and empire, and his antagonism toward Britain&#x27;s chief enemies and rivals for colonial power, Spain and France. Marie Peters argues his statesmanship was based on a clear, consistent and distinct appreciation of the value of the Empire.

The British parliamentary historian P. D. G. Thomas argued that Pitt&#x27;s power was based not on his family connections, but on the extraordinary parliamentary skills by which he dominated the House of Commons. He displayed a commanding manner, brilliant rhetoric and sharp debating skills that cleverly used his broad literary and historical knowledge. Scholars rank him highly among all British prime ministers.

== Early life ==
=== Family ===

Pitt was the grandson of Thomas Pitt (1653–1726), the governor of Madras, known as &quot;Diamond&quot; Pitt for having discovered a diamond of extraordinary size and having sold it to the Duke of Orléans for approximately £135,000. This transaction, as well as other trading deals in India, established the Pitt family fortune. After returning home the governor was able to raise his family to a position of wealth and political influence: in 1691 he purchased the property of Boconnoc in Cornwall, which gave him control of a seat in Parliament. He made further land purchases and became one of the dominant political figures in the West Country, controlling seats such as the rotten borough of Old Sarum.

William&#x27;s mother was Harriet Villiers, the daughter of Edward Villiers-FitzGerald and the Irish heiress Katherine FitzGerald. William&#x27;s father was Robert Pitt (1680–1727), the eldest son of Governor Pitt. He served as a Tory Member of Parliament from 1705 to 1727.

Both William&#x27;s uncles Thomas and John were MPs, while his aunt Lucy married the leading Whig politician and soldier General James Stanhope. From 1717 to 1721, Stanhope served as effective First Minister in the Stanhope–Sunderland Ministry, and was a useful political contact for the Pitt family until the collapse of the South Sea Bubble, a disaster that engulfed the government.

=== Birth and education ===
William Pitt was born at Golden Square, Westminster, on 15 November 1708. His older brother Thomas Pitt had been born in 1704 and they had five sisters: Harriet, Catherine, Ann, Elizabeth, and Mary. From 1719, William was educated at Eton College along with his brother. William disliked Eton, later claiming that &quot;a public school might suit a boy of turbulent disposition but would not do where there was any gentleness&quot;. It was at school that Pitt began to suffer from gout. Governor Pitt died in 1726, and the family estate at Boconnoc passed to William&#x27;s father. When he died the following year, Boconnoc was inherited by William&#x27;s elder brother, Thomas Pitt of Boconnoc.

In January 1727, William was entered as a gentleman commoner at Trinity College, Oxford. There is evidence that he was an extensive reader, if not a minutely accurate classical scholar. Virgil was his favourite author. William diligently cultivated the faculty of expression by the practice of translation and re-translation. In these years he became a close friend of George Lyttelton, who would later become a leading politician. In 1728, a violent attack of gout compelled him to leave Oxford without finishing his degree. He then chose to travel abroad, from 1728 attending Utrecht University in the Dutch Republic, gaining a knowledge of Hugo Grotius and other writers on international law and diplomacy. It is not known how long Pitt studied at Utrecht; but by 1730 he had returned to his brother&#x27;s estate at Boconnoc.

He had recovered from the violent attack of gout, but the disease proved intractable, and he continued to be subject to attacks of growing intensity at frequent intervals until his death.

=== Military career ===

On Pitt&#x27;s return home it was necessary for him, as the younger son, to choose a profession and he opted for a career in the army. He obtained a cornet&#x27;s commission in the dragoons with the King&#x27;s Own Regiment of Horse (later 1st King&#x27;s Dragoon Guards). George II never forgot the jibes of &quot;the terrible cornet of horse&quot;. It was reported that the £1,000 cost of the commission had been supplied by Robert Walpole, the prime minister, out of Treasury funds in an attempt to secure the support of Pitt&#x27;s brother Thomas in Parliament. Alternatively, the fee may have been waived by the commanding officer of the regiment, Lord Cobham, who was related to the Pitt brothers by marriage.

Pitt grew close to Cobham, whom he regarded as almost a surrogate father. He was stationed for much of his service in Northampton, on peacetime duties. Pitt was particularly frustrated that he had not been tested in battle since Britain had not entered the War of the Polish Succession that began in 1733 owing to Walpole&#x27;s isolationist policies. Pitt was granted extended leave in 1733 and he toured France and Switzerland. He briefly visited Paris, but spent most of his time in the French provinces, spending the winter in Lunéville in the Duchy of Lorraine.

Pitt&#x27;s military career was destined to be relatively short. His elder brother Thomas was returned at the general election of 1734 for two separate seats, Okehampton and Old Sarum, and chose to sit for Okehampton, passing the vacant seat to William who, accordingly, in February 1735, entered parliament as member for Old Sarum. He became one of a large number of serving army officers in the House of Commons.

== Rise to prominence ==

=== Patriot Whigs ===
Pitt soon joined a faction of discontented Whigs known as the Patriots who formed part of the opposition. The group commonly met at Stowe House, the country estate of Lord Cobham, who was a leader of the group. Cobham had originally been a supporter of the government under Sir Robert Walpole, but a dispute over the controversial Excise Bill of 1733 had seen them join the opposition. Pitt swiftly became one of the faction&#x27;s most prominent members.

Pitt&#x27;s maiden speech in the Commons was delivered in April 1736, in the debate on the congratulatory address to George II on the marriage of his son Frederick, Prince of Wales. He used the occasion to pay compliments, and there was nothing striking in the speech as reported, but it helped to gain him the attention of the House when he later took part on debates on more partisan subjects. In particular, he attacked Britain&#x27;s non-intervention in the ongoing European war, which he believed was in violation of the Treaty of Vienna and the terms of the Anglo-Austrian Alliance.

He became such a troublesome critic of the government that Walpole moved to punish him by arranging his dismissal from the army in 1736, along with several of his friends and political allies. This provoked a wave of hostility to Walpole because many saw such an act as unconstitutional—that members of Parliament were being dismissed for their freedom of speech in attacking the government, something protected by Parliamentary privilege. None of the men had their commissions reinstated, however, and the incident brought an end to Pitt&#x27;s military career. The loss of Pitt&#x27;s commission was soon compensated. The heir to the throne, Frederick, Prince of Wales, was involved in a long-running dispute with his father, George II, and was the patron of the opposition. He appointed Pitt one of his Grooms of the Bedchamber as a reward. In this new position Pitt&#x27;s hostility to the government did not in any degree relax, and his oratorical gifts were substantial.

=== War ===
==== Spanish war ====

During the 1730s Britain&#x27;s relationship with Spain had slowly declined. Repeated cases of reported Spanish mistreatment of British merchants, whom they accused of smuggling, caused public outrage, particularly the incident of Jenkins&#x27; Ear. Pitt was a leading advocate of a more hard-line policy against Spain and he often castigated Walpole&#x27;s government for its weakness in dealing with Madrid. Pitt spoke out against the Convention of El Pardo that aimed to settle the dispute peacefully. In the speech against the convention in the House of Commons on 8 March 1739 Pitt said:

When trade is at stake, it is your last entrenchment; you must defend it, or perish  ... Sir, Spain knows the consequence of a war in America; whoever gains, it must prove fatal to her  ... is this any longer a nation? Is this any longer an English Parliament, if with more ships in your harbours than in all the navies of Europe; with above two millions of people in your American colonies, you will bear to hear of the expediency of receiving from Spain an insecure, unsatisfactory, dishonourable Convention?

Owing to public pressure, the British government was pushed toward declaring war with Spain in 1739. Britain began with a success at Porto Bello. However the war effort soon stalled, and Pitt alleged that the government was not prosecuting the war effectively—demonstrated by the fact that the British waited two years before taking further offensive action fearing that further British victories would provoke the French into declaring war. When they did so, a failed attack was made on the South American port of Cartagena that left thousands of British troops dead, more than half from disease, and cost many ships. The decision to attack during the rainy season was held as further evidence of the government&#x27;s incompetence.

After this, the colonial war against Spain was almost entirely abandoned as British resources were switched toward fighting France in Europe as the War of the Austrian Succession had broken out. The Spanish had repelled a major invasion intended to conquer Central America and succeeded in maintaining their trans-Atlantic convoys while causing much disruption to British shipping and twice broke a British blockade to land troops in Italy, but the war with Spain was treated as a draw. Many of the underlying issues remained unresolved by the later peace treaties leaving the potential for future conflicts to occur. Pitt considered the war a missed opportunity to take advantage of a power in decline, although later he became an advocate of warmer relations with the Spanish in an effort to prevent them forming an alliance with France.

==== Hanover ====
Walpole and Newcastle were now giving the war in Europe a much higher priority than the colonial conflict with Spain in the Americas. Prussia and Austria went to war in 1740, with many other European states soon joining in. There was a fear that France would launch an invasion of Hanover, which was linked to Britain through the crown of George II. To avert this, Walpole and Newcastle decided to pay a large subsidy to both Austria and Hanover, in order for them to raise troops and defend themselves.

Pitt then launched an attack on such subsidies, playing to widespread anti-Hanoverian feelings in Britain. This boosted his popularity with the public, but earned him the lifelong hatred of the King, who was emotionally committed to Hanover, where he had spent the first thirty years of his life. In response to Pitt&#x27;s attacks, the British government decided not to pay a direct subsidy to Hanover, but instead to pass the money indirectly through Austriaa move that was considered more politically acceptable. A sizeable Anglo-German army was formed that George II led to victory at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743, reducing the immediate threat to Hanover.

=== Fall of Walpole ===
Many of Pitt&#x27;s attacks on the government were directed personally at Walpole, who had now been prime minister for twenty years. He spoke in favour of the motion in 1742 for an inquiry into the last ten years of Walpole&#x27;s administration. In February 1742, following poor election results and the disaster at Cartagena, Walpole finally was forced to succumb to the long-continued attacks of opposition, he resigned and took a peerage.

Pitt now expected a new government to be formed led by Pulteney and dominated by Tories and Patriot Whigs in which he could expect a junior position. Instead, Walpole was succeeded as prime minister by Lord Wilmington, although the real power in the new government was divided among Lord Carteret and the Pelham brothers (Henry and Thomas, Duke of Newcastle). Walpole had carefully orchestrated this new government as a continuance of his own, and continued to advise it up to his death in 1745. Pitt&#x27;s hopes for a place in the government were thwarted and he remained in opposition. He was therefore unable to make any personal gain from the downfall of Walpole, to which he had personally contributed a great deal.

After the dismissal of Carteret, the administration formed by the Pelhams in 1744 included many of Pitt&#x27;s former Patriot allies, but Pitt was not granted a position because of continued ill-feeling by the king and leading Whigs about his views on Hanover. In 1744, Pitt received a large boost to his personal fortune when the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough died leaving him a legacy of £10,000 as an &quot;acknowledgment of the noble defence he had made for the support of the laws of England and to prevent the ruin of his country&quot;. The inheritance was probably as much a mark of her dislike of Walpole as of her admiration of Pitt.

=== Paymaster of the Forces ===

Reluctantly the king finally agreed to give Pitt a place in the government. Pitt had changed his stance on a number of issues to become more acceptable to George, most notably the heated issue of Hanoverian subsidies. To force the matter, the Pelham brothers had to resign on the question of whether he should be admitted or not, and it was only after all other arrangements had proved impracticable, that they were reinstated with Pitt appointed as Vice-Treasurer of Ireland in February 1746. George continued to resent him however.

In May of the same year Pitt was promoted to the more important and lucrative office of paymaster-general, which gave him a place in the Privy Council, although not in the cabinet. There he had an opportunity of displaying his public spirit and integrity in a way that deeply impressed both the king and the country. It had been the usual practise of previous paymasters to appropriate to themselves the interest of all money lying in their hands by way of advance, and also to accept a commission of % on all foreign subsidies. Although there was no strong public sentiment against the practice, Pitt completely refused to profit by it. All advances were lodged by him in the Bank of England until required, and all subsidies were paid over without deduction, even though it was pressed upon him, so that he did not draw a shilling from his office beyond the salary legally attaching to it. Pitt ostentatiously made this clear to everyone, although he was in fact following what Henry Pelham had done when he had held the post between 1730 and 1743. This helped to establish Pitt&#x27;s reputation with the British people for honesty and placing the interests of the nation before his own.

The administration formed in 1746 lasted without major changes until 1754. It would appear from his published correspondence that Pitt had a greater influence in shaping its policy than his comparatively subordinate position would in itself have entitled him to. His support for measures, such as the Spanish Treaty and the continental subsidies, which he had violently denounced when in opposition was criticised by his enemies as an example of his political opportunism.

Between 1746 and 1748, Pitt worked closely with Newcastle in formulating British military and diplomatic strategy. He shared with Newcastle a belief that Britain should continue to fight until it could receive generous peace terms, in contrast to some such as Henry Pelham who favoured an immediate peace. Pitt was saddened when his friend and brother-in-law Thomas Grenville was killed at the naval First Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1747, however, this victory helped secure British supremacy of the sea that gave the British a stronger negotiating position when it came to the peace talks that ended the war. At the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 British colonial conquests were exchanged for a French withdrawal from Brussels. Many saw this as merely an armistice and awaited an imminent new war.

=== Dispute with Newcastle ===

In 1754, Henry Pelham died suddenly and was succeeded as prime minister by his brother, the Duke of Newcastle. As Newcastle sat in the House of Lords, he required a leading politician to represent the government in the House of Commons. Pitt and Henry Fox were considered the two favourites for the position, but Newcastle instead rejected them both and turned to the less well-known figure of Sir Thomas Robinson, a career diplomat, to fill the post. It was widely believed that Newcastle had done this because he feared the ambitions of both Pitt and Fox, and believed he would find it easier to dominate the inexperienced Robinson.

Despite his disappointment there was no immediate open breach. Pitt continued at his post; and at the general election that took place during the year, he even accepted a nomination for the Duke&#x27;s pocket borough of Aldborough. He had sat for Seaford since 1747. The government won a landslide, further strengthening its majority in parliament.

When parliament met, however, he made no secret of his feelings. Ignoring Robinson, Pitt made frequent and vehement attacks on Newcastle, although still continuing to serve as Paymaster under him. From 1754, Britain was increasingly drawn into conflict with France during this period, despite Newcastle&#x27;s wish to maintain the peace. The countries clashed in North America, where each had laid claim to the Ohio Country. A British expedition under General Braddock had been despatched and defeated in summer 1755 that caused a ratcheting up of tensions.
Eager to prevent the war spreading to Europe, Newcastle now tried to conclude a series of treaties that would secure Britain allies through the payment of subsidies, which he hoped would discourage France from attacking Britain. Similar subsidies had been an issue of past disagreement, and they were widely attacked by Patriot Whigs and Tories. As the government came under increasing attack, Newcastle replaced Robinson with Fox who it was acknowledged carried more political weight and again slighted Pitt.

Finally in November 1755, Pitt was dismissed from office as paymaster, having spoken during a debate at great length against the new system of continental subsidies proposed by the government of which he was still a member. Fox retained his own place, and although the two men continued to be of the same party, and afterward served again in the same government, there was henceforward a rivalry between them, which makes the celebrated opposition of their sons, William Pitt the Younger and Charles James Fox, seem like an inherited quarrel.

Pitt&#x27;s relationship with the Duke slumped further in early 1756 when he alleged that Newcastle was deliberately leaving the island of Menorca ill-defended so that the French would seize it, and Newcastle could use its loss to prove that Britain was not able to fight a war against France and sue for peace. When in June 1756 Menorca fell after a failed attempt by Admiral Byng to relieve it, Pitt&#x27;s allegations fuelled the public anger against Newcastle, leading him to be attacked by a mob in Greenwich. The loss of Menorca shattered public faith in Newcastle, and forced him to step down as prime minister in November 1756.

=== Secretary of State ===
In December 1756, Pitt, who now sat for Okehampton, became Secretary of State for the Southern Department, and Leader of the House of Commons under the premiership of the Duke of Devonshire. Upon entering this coalition, Pitt said to Devonshire: &quot;My Lord, I am sure I can save this country, and no one else can&quot;.

He had made it a condition of his joining any administration that Newcastle should be excluded from it, which proved fatal to the lengthened existence of his government. With the king unfriendly, and Newcastle, whose influence was still dominant in the Commons, estranged, it was impossible to carry on a government by the aid of public opinion alone, however emphatically that might have declared itself on his side. The historian Basil Williams has claimed that this is the first time in British history when a &quot;man was called to supreme power by the voice of the people&quot; rather than by the king&#x27;s appointment or, as the choice of Parliament.

Pitt drew up his plans for the campaigning season of 1757 in which he hoped to reverse Britain&#x27;s string of defeats during the war&#x27;s opening years.

In April 1757 Pitt was dismissed from office on account of his opposition to the continental policy and the circumstances surrounding the court-martial and execution of Admiral John Byng. He was succeeded by the Duke of Devonshire who formed the 1757 Caretaker Ministry. But the power that was insufficient to keep him in office was strong enough to make any arrangement that excluded him, impracticable. The public voice spoke in a way that was not to be mistaken. Probably no English minister ever received in so short a time so many proofs of the confidence and admiration of the public, the capital and all the chief towns voting him addresses and the freedom of their corporations (e.g., London presented him with the first ever &quot;honorary&quot; Freedom of the City awarded in history). Horace Walpole recorded the freedoms of various cities awarded to Pitt:

... for some weeks it rained gold boxes: Chester, Worcester, Norwich, Bedford, Salisbury, Yarmouth, Tewkesbury, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Stirling, and other populous and chief towns following the example. Exeter, with singular affection, sent boxes of oak.

After some weeks&#x27; negotiation, in the course of which the firmness and moderation of &quot;The Great Commoner&quot;, as he had come to be called, contrasted favourably with the characteristic tortuosities of the crafty peer, matters were settled on such a basis that, while Newcastle was the nominal, Pitt was the virtual head of the government. On his acceptance of office, he was chosen member for Bath.

== Pitt–Newcastle ministry ==
=== Seven Years&#x27; War ===


A coalition with Newcastle was formed in June 1757, and held power until October 1761. It brought together several various factions and was built around the partnership between Pitt and Newcastle, which a few months earlier had seemed impossible. The two men used Lord Chesterfield as an intermediary and had managed to agree a division of powers that was acceptable to both. For the past few months Britain had been virtually leaderless, although Devonshire had remained formally prime minister, but now Pitt and Newcastle were ready to offer stronger direction to the country&#x27;s strategy.

By summer 1757 the British war effort over the previous three years had broadly been a failure. Britain&#x27;s attempts to take the offensive in North America had ended in disaster, Menorca had been lost, and the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s Army of Observation was retreating across Hanover following the Battle of Hastenback. In October Cumberland was forced to conclude the Convention of Klosterzeven, which would take Hanover out of the war. The French Invasion of Hanover posed a threat to Britain&#x27;s ally Prussia, which was now vulnerable to attack from the west by the French as well as facing attack from Austria, Russia, Saxony and Sweden.

Although it was late in the campaigning season when he had come to power, Pitt set about trying to initiate a more assertive strategy. He conspired with a number of figures to persuade the Hanoverians to revoke the Klosterzevern Convention and re-enter the war on Britain&#x27;s side, which they did in late 1757. He also put into practice a scheme of Naval Descents that would make amphibious landings on the French coast. The first of these, the Raid on Rochefort, took place in September but was not a success. The centrepiece of the campaign in North America, an expedition to capture Louisbourg, was aborted due to the presence of a large French fleet and a gale that scattered the British fleet.

=== 1758 ===
In 1758 Pitt began to put into practice a new strategy to win the Seven Years&#x27; War, which would involve tying down large numbers of French troops and resources in Germany, while Britain used its naval supremacy to launch expeditions to capture French forces around the globe. Following the capture of Emden he ordered the dispatch of the first British troops to the European continent under the Duke of Marlborough, who joined Brunswick&#x27;s army. This was a dramatic reversal of his previous position, as he had recently been strongly opposed to any such commitment.

Pitt had been lobbied by an American merchant Thomas Cumming to launch an expedition against the French trading settlements in West Africa. In April 1758 British forces captured the ill-defended fort of Saint-Louis in Senegal. The mission was so lucrative that Pitt sent out further expeditions to capture Gorée and Gambia later in the year. He also drew up plans to attack French islands in the Caribbean the following year at the suggestion of a Jamaican sugar planter William Beckford.

In North America, a second British attempt to capture Louisbourg succeeded. However, Pitt&#x27;s pleasure over this was tempered by the subsequent news of a significant British defeat at the Battle of Carillon. Toward the end of the year the Forbes Expedition seized the site of Fort Duquesne and began constructing the British-controlled Fort Pitt (which later grew into the city of Pittsburgh). This gave the British control of the Ohio Country, which had been the principal cause of the war.

In Europe, Brunswick&#x27;s forces enjoyed a mixed year. Brunswick had crossed the Rhine, but faced with being cut off he had retreated and blocked any potential French move toward Hanover with his victory at the Battle of Krefeld. The year ended with something approaching a stalemate in Germany. Pitt had continued his naval descents during 1758, but the first had enjoyed only limited success and the second ended with near disaster at the Battle of St Cast and no further descents were planned. Instead the troops and ships would be used as part of the coming expedition to the French West Indies. The scheme of amphibious raids was the only one of Pitt&#x27;s policies during the war that was broadly a failure, although it did help briefly relieve pressure on the German front by tying down French troops on coastal protection service.

====Annus Mirabilis====
In France a new leader, the Duc de Choiseul, had recently come to power and 1759 offered a duel between their rival strategies. Pitt intended to continue with his plan of tying down French forces in Germany while continuing the assault on France&#x27;s colonies. Choiseul hoped to repel the attacks in the colonies while seeking total victory in Europe.

Pitt&#x27;s war around the world was largely successful. While a British invasion of Martinique failed, they captured Guadeloupe shortly afterward. In India, a French attempt to capture Madras was repulsed. In North America, British troops closed in on France&#x27;s Canadian heartland. A British force under James Wolfe moved up the Saint Lawrence with the aim of capturing Quebec. After initially failing to penetrate the French defences at the Montmorency Falls, Wolfe later led his men to a victory to the west of the city allowing the British forces to capture Quebec.

Choiseul had pinned much of his hopes on a French invasion of Britain, which he hoped would knock Britain out of the war and make it surrender the colonies it had taken from France. Pitt had stripped the home islands of troops to send on his expeditions, leaving Britain guarded by poorly trained militia and giving an opportunity for the French if they could land in enough force. The French did build a large invasion force. However the French naval defeats at Lagos and Quiberon Bay forced Choiseul to abandon the invasion plans. France&#x27;s other great hope, that their armies could make a breakthrough in Germany and invade Hanover, was thwarted at the Battle of Minden. Britain ended the year victorious in every theatre of operations in which it was engaged, with Pitt receiving the credit for this.

====1760–61====
Britain completed the conquest of Canada in 1760 by capturing Montreal, which effectively brought the war to an end on mainland North America.

Pitt&#x27;s power had now reached its peak, but was soon under threat. The domestic political situation was altered dramatically when George II died in October 1760. He was succeeded by his grandson, George III, who had once considered Pitt an ally but had become angered by Pitt&#x27;s alliance with Newcastle and acceptance of the need for British intervention in Germanywhich George was strongly opposed to. The new king successfully lobbied for his favourite Lord Bute to be given the post of Northern Secretary. Bute was inclined to support a withdrawal from Germany, and to fight the war with France largely at sea and in the colonies.

Pitt&#x27;s plan for an expedition to capture Belle Île was put into force in April 1761 and it was captured after a siege. This provided yet a further blow to French prestige, as it was the first part of Metropolitan France to be occupied. Pitt now expected France to offer terms, although he was prepared for a longer war if necessary. Envoys were exchanged, but neither side could reach an agreement. Pitt&#x27;s refusal to grant the French a share in Newfoundland proved the biggest obstacle to peace, as Pitt declared he would rather lose the use of his right arm than give the French a share there and later said he would rather give up the Tower of London than Newfoundland. Newfoundland was at the time seen as possessing huge economic and strategic value because of the extensive fishing industry there.

The war in Germany continued through 1761 with the French again attempting to overcome Brunswick and invade Hanover, but suffering a defeat at the Battle of Villinghausen. Pitt had substantially increased the number of British troops serving with Brunswick, and he also planned further conquests in the West Indies. A strategy he hoped would compel the French to conclude a reasonable peace treaty.

====Treaty of Paris====
To the preliminaries of the peace concluded in February 1763 he offered an indignant resistance, considering the terms quite inadequate to the successes that had been gained by the country. When the treaty was discussed in parliament in December of the previous year, although suffering from a severe attack of gout, he was carried down to the House, and in a speech of three hours&#x27; duration, interrupted more than once by paroxysms of pain, he strongly protested against its various conditions. These conditions included the return of the sugar islands (but Britain retained Dominica); trading stations in West Africa (won by Boscawen); Pondicherry (France&#x27;s Indian colony); and fishing rights in Newfoundland. Pitt&#x27;s opposition arose through two heads: France had been given the means to become once more formidable at sea, whilst Frederick of Prussia had been betrayed.

Pitt believed that the task had been left half-finished and called for a final year of war which would crush French power for good. Pitt had long-held plans for further conquests which had been uncompleted. Newcastle, by contrast, sought peace but only if the war in Germany could be brought to an honourable and satisfactory conclusion (rather than Britain suddenly bailing out of it as Bute proposed). However the combined opposition of Newcastle and Pitt was not enough to prevent the Treaty passing comfortably in both Houses of Parliament.

However, there were strong reasons for concluding the peace: the National Debt had increased from £74.5m. in 1755 to £133.25m. in 1763, the year of the peace. The requirement to pay down this debt, and the lack of French threat in Canada, were major movers in the subsequent American War of Independence.

The physical cause which rendered this effort so painful probably accounts for the infrequency of his appearances in parliament, as well as for much that is otherwise inexplicable in his subsequent conduct. In 1763, he spoke against the unpopular tax on cider, imposed by his brother-in-law, George Grenville, and his opposition, although unsuccessful in the House, helped to keep alive his popularity with the country, which cordially hated the excise and all connected with it. When next year the question of general warrants was raised in connexion with the case of John Wilkes, Pitt vigorously maintained their illegality, thus defending at once the privileges of Parliament and the freedom of the press.

During 1765 he seems to have been totally incapacitated for public business. In the following year he supported with great power the proposal of the Rockingham administration for the repeal of the Stamp Act, arguing that it was unconstitutional to impose taxes upon the colonies. He thus endorsed the contention of the colonists on the ground of principle, while the majority of those who acted with him contented themselves with resisting the disastrous taxation scheme on the ground of expediency.
The Repeal (1766) of the Stamp Act, indeed, was only passed &quot;pari passu&quot; with another censuring the American assemblies, and declaring the authority of the British parliament over the colonies &quot;in all cases whatsoever&quot;. Thus the House of Commons repudiated in the most formal manner the principle Pitt laid down. His language in approval of the resistance of the colonists was unusually bold, and perhaps no one but himself could have employed it with impunity at a time when the freedom of debate was only imperfectly conceded.

Pitt had not been long out of office when he was solicited to return to it, and the solicitations were more than once renewed. Unsuccessful overtures were made to him in 1763, and twice in 1765, in May and June—the negotiator in May being the king&#x27;s uncle, the Duke of Cumberland, who went down in person to Hayes, Pitt&#x27;s seat in Kent. It is known that he had the opportunity of joining the Marquess of Rockingham&#x27;s short-lived administration at any time on his own terms, and his conduct in declining an arrangement with that minister has been more generally condemned than any other step in his public life.

===Leadership===
The &quot;London Magazine&quot; of 1767 offered &quot;Pitt, Pompadour, Prussia, Providence&quot; as the reasons for Britain&#x27;s success in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Pitt&#x27;s relation to all three was such as to entitle him to a large share in the credit of their deeds. He inspired trust in his chosen commanders by his indifference to rules of seniority—several of &quot;Pitt&#x27;s boys&quot;, like Keppel, captor of Gorée, were in their thirties—and by his clear orders. It was his discernment that selected Wolfe to lead the attack on Quebec, and gave him the opportunity of dying a victor on the heights of Abraham. He had personally less to do with the successes in India than with the other great enterprises that shed an undying lustre on his administration; but his generous praise in parliament encouraged Robert Clive, and the forces that acted at the close of the struggle were animated by his indomitable spirit.

Pitt&#x27;s particular genius was to finance an army on the continent to drain French men and resources so that Britain might concentrate on what he held to be the vital spheres: Canada and the West Indies; whilst Clive successfully defeated Siraj ud-Daulah, (the last independent Nawab of Bengal) at Plassey (1757), securing India. The Continental campaign was carried on by Cumberland, defeated at Hastenbeck and forced to surrender at Convention of Klosterzeven (1757) and thereafter by Ferdinand of Brunswick, later victor at Minden; Britain&#x27;s Continental campaign had two major strands, firstly subsidising allies, particularly Frederick the Great, and second, financing an army to divert French resources from the colonial war and to also defend Hanover (which was the territory of the Kings of England at this time)

Pitt was a leading imperialist in English history. He was the directing mind in the expansion of his country, and with him the beginning of empire is rightly associated. The Seven Years&#x27; War might well, moreover, have been another Thirty Years&#x27; War if Pitt had not furnished Frederick with an annual subsidy of £700,000, and in addition relieved him of the task of defending western Germany against France: this was the policy that allowed Pitt to boast of having &quot;won Canada on the banks of the Rhine&quot;.

Contemporary opinion was, of course, incompetent to estimate the permanent results gained for the country by the brilliant foreign policy of Pitt. It has long been generally agreed that by several of his most costly expeditions nothing was really won but glory: the policy of diversionary attacks on places like Rochefort was memorably described as &#x27;breaking windows with gold guineas&#x27;. It has even been said that the only permanent acquisition that England owed directly to him was her Canadian dominion; and, strictly speaking, this is true, it being admitted that the campaign by which the Indian empire was virtually won was not planned by him, although brought to a successful issue during his ministry.

But material &quot;aggrandisement&quot;, although the only tangible, was not the only real or lasting effect of a war policy. More could be gained by crushing a formidable rival than by conquering a province. The loss of her Canadian possessions was only one of a series of disasters suffered by France, which included the victories at sea of Boscawen at Lagos and Hawke at Quiberon Bay. Such defeats radically affected the future of Europe and the world. Deprived of her most valuable colonies both in the East and in the West, and thoroughly defeated on the continent, France&#x27;s humiliation was the beginning of a new epoch in history.

The victorious policy of Pitt destroyed the military prestige which repeated experience has shown to be in France as in no other country the very life of monarchy, and thus was not the least of the influences that slowly brought about the French Revolution. It effectually deprived France of the lead in the councils of Europe which she had hitherto arrogated to herself, and so affected the whole course of continental politics. It is such far-reaching results as these, and not the mere acquisition of a single colony, however valuable, that constitute Pitt&#x27;s claim to be considered as the most powerful minister that ever guided the foreign policy of England.

====Resignation====
George II died on 25 October 1760, and was succeeded by his grandson, George III. The new king was inclined to view politics in personal terms and taught to believe that &quot;Pitt had the blackest of hearts&quot;. The new king had counsellors of his own, led by Lord Bute. Bute soon joined the cabinet as a Northern Secretary and Pitt and he were quickly in dispute over a number of issues.

In 1761 Pitt had received information from his agents about a secret Bourbon Family Compact by which the Bourbons of France and Spain bound themselves in an offensive alliance against Britain. Spain was concerned that Britain&#x27;s victories over France had left them too powerful, and were a threat in the long term to Spain&#x27;s own empire. Equally they may have believed that the British had become overstretched by fighting a global war and decided to try to seize British possessions such as Jamaica. A secret convention pledged that if Britain and France were still at war by 1 May 1762, Spain would enter the war on the French side.

Pitt urged that such a clear threat should be met by a pre-emptive strike against Spain&#x27;s navy and her colonies—with emphasis on speed to prevent Spain bringing the annual Manila galleon safely to harbour. Bute and Newcastle refused to support such a move, as did the entire cabinet except Temple, believing it would make Britain look the aggressor against Spain potentially provoking other neutral nations to declare war on Britain. Pitt believed he had no choice but to leave a cabinet in which his advice on a vital question had been rejected and presented his resignation. Many of his cabinet colleagues secretly welcomed his departure as they believed his dominance and popularity were a threat to the Constitution. Pitt&#x27;s brother-in-law George Grenville was given a major role in government, angering Pitt who felt Grenville should have resigned with him. Pitt regarded Grenville&#x27;s action as a betrayal and there was hostility between them for several years.

After Pitt&#x27;s resignation in October 1761, the King urged Pitt to accept a mark of royal favour. Accordingly, he obtained a pension of £3000 a year and his wife, Lady Hester Grenville was created Baroness Chatham in her own right—although Pitt refused to accept a title himself. Pitt assured the King that he would not go into direct opposition against the government. His conduct after his retirement was distinguished by a moderation and disinterestedness which, as Edmund Burke remarked, &quot;set a seal upon his character&quot;. The war with Spain, in which he had urged the cabinet to take the initiative, proved inevitable; but he scorned to use the occasion for &quot;altercation and recrimination&quot;, and spoke in support of the government measures for carrying on the war.

Twenty years after he had received a similar windfall from the Marlborough legacy, Sir William Pynsent, Bt., a Somerset baronet to whom he was personally quite unknown, left him his entire estate, worth about three thousand a year, in testimony of approval of his political career.

== Prime Minister (1766-1768) ==

=== Chatham Ministry===

In July 1766 Rockingham was dismissed, and Pitt was entrusted by the King with the task of forming a government entirely of his own selection. His principle, &quot;measures not men&quot;, appealed to the King whom he proposed to serve by &quot;destroying all party distinctions&quot;. Pitt made appointments based not on connections but on merit, such as Charles Townshend to the Exchequer and Shelburne as Secretary of State, to order American affairs. Pitt chose for himself the office of Lord Privy Seal, which required his elevation to the House of Lords, and on 4 August he became Earl of Chatham in the county of Kent and Viscount Pitt of Burton Pynsent in the county of Somerset.

Pitt&#x27;s decision to accept a peerage was likely influenced by his declining health and desire for a less demanding role, but the &quot;great commoner&quot; lost a great deal of public support. For example, in view of his probable accession to power, preparations were made in the City of London for a banquet and a general illumination to celebrate the event, but the celebration was at once countermanded when it was known that he had become Earl of Chatham.

Edmund Burke described the administration as &quot;chequered and speckled&quot;, and spoke of it as &quot;patriots and courtiers, King&#x27;s friends and republicans; Whigs and Tories  ... indeed a very curious show, but utterly unsafe to touch and unsure to stand on&quot;.

=== Economic policy ===
The problems facing the government included the observance of the Treaty of Paris by France and Spain, tension between American colonists and the mother country, and the status of the East India Company. One of the new ministry&#x27;s earliest acts was to lay an embargo upon corn, which was thought necessary in order to prevent a dearth resulting from the unprecedented bad harvest of 1766. The measure was strongly opposed, and Lord Chatham delivered his first speech in the House of Lords in support of it. It proved to be almost the only measure introduced by his government in which he personally interested himself.

=== Colonial policy ===
In 1767, Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, enacted duties in the American colonies on tea, paper, and other goods. The taxes were created without the consultation of Chatham and possibly against his wishes. They proved offensive to the American colonists. Chatham&#x27;s attention had been directed to the growing importance of the affairs of India, and there is evidence in his correspondence that he was meditating a comprehensive scheme for transferring much of the power of the East India Company to the crown. Yet he was incapacitated physically and mentally during nearly his entire tenure of office. Chatham rarely saw any of his colleagues although they repeatedly and urgently pressed for interviews with him, and even an offer from the King to visit him in person was respectfully declined. While his gout seemed to improve, he was newly afflicted with mental alienation bordering on insanity. Chatham&#x27;s lack of leadership resulted in an incohesive set of policies.

=== Resignation ===
Chatham dismissed his allies Amherst and Shelburne from their posts, and then in October 1768 he tendered his own resignation on the grounds of poor health, leaving the leadership to Grafton, his First Lord of the Treasury.

==Later life==
Soon after his resignation a renewed attack of gout freed Chatham from the mental disease under which he had so long suffered. He had been nearly two years and a half in seclusion when, in July 1769, he again appeared in public at a royal levee. It was not, however, until 1770 that he resumed his seat in the House of Lords.

===Falklands Crisis===

The same year when Britain and Spain became involved in the Falklands Crisis and came close to war, Pitt was a staunch advocate of taking a tough stance with Madrid and Paris (as he had been during the earlier Corsican Crisis when France had invaded Corsica) and made a number of speeches on the subject rousing public opinion. The government of Lord North was pushed into taking a firmer line because of this, mobilising the navy, and forcing Spain to back down. Some had even believed that the issue was enough to cast North from office and restore Pitt as Prime Minister—although the ultimate result was to strengthen the position of North who took credit for his firm handling of the crisis and was able to fill the cabinet with his own supporters. North would go on to dominate politics for the next decade, leading the country until 1782.

===War of American Independence===
Chatham sought to discourage industrialization in the American colonies, in 1770 he stated that &quot;the colonies should not be permitted to manufacture so much as a horseshoe nail&quot;.

Chatham sought to find a compromise on the escalating conflict with the American colonies. As he realised the gravity of the American situation, Chatham re-entered the fray, declaring that he would &quot;be in earnest for the public&quot; and &quot;a scarecrow of violence to the gentler warblers of the grove&quot;. His position changed from an obsession in 1774 with the question of the authority of Parliament to a search for a formula for conciliation in 1775. He proposed the &quot;Provisional Act&quot; that would both maintain the ultimate authority of Parliamentary sovereignty, while meeting the colonial demands. The Lords defeated his proposal on 1 February 1775. Chatham&#x27;s warnings regarding America were ignored. After war had broken out, he warned that America could not be conquered. Due to his stance, Pitt was very popular amongst the American colonists. This high esteem approached to idolatry according to historian Clinton Rossiter:

In the last decade of the colonial period the ideal of the man of public virtue was made real in the person of William Pitt. The cult of this noblest of Whigs, &quot;the Genius of England and the Comet of his Age&quot; was well advanced toward idolatry at least five years before the Stamp Act. The greatest of &quot;the great men of England&quot;, the last and noblest of the Romans, was considered the embodiment of virtue, wisdom, patriotism, liberty, and temperance  ... Pitt, &quot;glorious and immortal&quot;, the &quot;guardian of America&quot;, was the idol of the colonies  ... A Son of Liberty in Bristol County, Massachusetts, paid him the ultimate tribute of identification with English liberty: &quot;Our toast in general is,—&quot;Magna Charta&quot;, the &quot;British Constitution&quot;,— and Liberty forever!&quot;

=== Death ===
Pitt had now almost no personal following, mainly owing to the grave mistake he had made in not forming an alliance with the Rockingham party, but his eloquence was as powerful as ever, and all its power was directed against the government policy in the contest with America, which had become the question of all-absorbing interest. His last appearance in the House of Lords was on 7 April 1778, on the occasion of the Duke of Richmond&#x27;s motion for an address praying the king to conclude peace with America on any terms.

In view of the hostile demonstrations of France the various parties had come generally to see the necessity of such a measure but Chatham could not brook the thought of a step which implied submission to the &quot;natural enemy&quot; whom it had been the main object of his life to humble, and he declaimed for a considerable time, although with diminished vigour, against the motion. After the Duke of Richmond had replied, he rose again excitedly as if to speak, pressed his hand upon his breast, and fell down in a fit. His last words before he collapsed were: &quot;My Lords, any state is better than despair; if we must fall, let us fall like men.&quot; James Harris MP, however, recorded that Lord Nugent had told him that Chatham&#x27;s last words in the Lords were: &quot;If the Americans defend independence, they shall find me in their way&quot; and that his very last words (spoken to his soldier son John) were: &quot;Leave your dying father, and go to the defence of your country&quot;.

He was moved to his home at Hayes, where his middle son William read to him Homer&#x27;s passage about the death of Hector. Chatham died on 11 May 1778, aged 69. Although he was initially buried at Hayes, all parties combined to show their sense of the national loss and the Commons presented an address to the king praying that the deceased statesman might be buried with the honours of a public funeral. A sum was voted for a public monument which was erected over a new grave in Westminster Abbey. The monument, by the sculptor John Bacon, has a figure of Pitt above statues of Britannia and Neptune with figures representing Prudence, Fortitude, the Earth and also a sea creature.

In the Guildhall Edmund Burke&#x27;s inscription summed up what he had meant to the city: he was &quot;the minister by whom commerce was united with and made to flourish by war&quot;. Soon after the funeral a bill was passed bestowing a pension of £4,000 a year on his successors in the earldom. He had a family of three sons and two daughters, of whom the second son, William, became prime minister in 1783.

==Legacy==
Horace Walpole, not an uncritical admirer, wrote of Pitt:

It were ingratitude to him to say that he did not give such a reverberation to our stagnating councils, as exceedingly altered the appearance of our fortune. He warded off the evil hour that seemed approaching, he infused vigour into our arms, he taught the nation to speak again as England used to speak to foreign powers  ... Pitt, on entering upon administration, had found the nation at the lowest ebb in point of power and reputation  ... France, who meant to be feared, was feared heartily  ... They were willing to trust that France would be so good as to ruin us by inches. Pitt had roused us from this ignoble lethargy  ... The admirers of Mr Pitt extol the reverberation he gave to our councils, the despondence he banished, the spirit he infused, the conquests he made, the security he affixed to our trade and plantations, the humiliation of France, the glory of Britain carried under his administration to a pitch at which it never had arrived—and all this is exactly true.

Samuel Johnson is reported to have said that &quot;Walpole was a minister given by the king to the people, but Pitt was a minister given by the people to the king&quot;, and the remark correctly indicated Chatham&#x27;s distinctive place among English statesmen. He was the first minister whose main strength lay in the support of the nation at large as distinct from its representatives in the Commons, where his personal following was always small. He was the first to discern that public opinion, though generally slow to form and slow to act, is in the end the paramount power in the state; and he was the first to use it not in an emergency merely, but throughout a whole political career.

Chatham marked the commencement of that vast change in the movement of English politics by which it came about that the sentiment of the great mass of the people then told effectively on the action of the government from day to day—almost from hour to hour. He was well fitted to secure the sympathy and admiration of his countrymen, for his virtues and his failings were alike English. He was often inconsistent, he was generally intractable and overbearing, and he was always pompous and affected to a degree which, as Macaulay remarked, seemed scarcely compatible with true greatness.

Of the last quality evidence was furnished in the stilted style of his letters, and in the fact recorded by Thomas Seward that he never permitted his under-secretaries to sit in his presence. Burke spoke of &quot;some significant, pompous, creeping, explanatory, ambiguous matter, in the true Chathamic style&quot;. But these defects were known only to the inner circle of his associates.

To the outside public he was endeared as a statesman who could do or suffer &quot;nothing base&quot;, and who had the rare power of transfusing his own indomitable energy and courage into all who served under him. &quot;A spirited foreign policy&quot; has always been popular in England, and Pitt was the most popular of English ministers, because he was the most successful exponent of such a policy. In domestic affairs his influence was small and almost entirely indirect. He himself confessed his unfitness for dealing with questions of finance. The commercial prosperity that was produced by his war policy was in a great part delusive, as prosperity so produced must always be, although it had permanent effects of the highest moment in the rise of such centres of industry as Glasgow. This, however, was a remote result which he could have neither intended nor foreseen.

It has been suggested that Pitt was in fact a far more orthodox Whig than has been historically portrayed demonstrated by his sitting for rotten borough seats controlled by aristocratic magnates, and his lifelong concern for protecting the balance of power on the European continent, which marked him out from many other Patriots.

Historians such as Caleb Carr have described Pitt as &quot;the greatest British statesman of the eighteenth century&quot;. He is immortalised in St Stephen&#x27;s Hall, where he and other notable Parliamentarians look on at visitors to Parliament.

The American city of Pittsburgh, originally Fort Duquesne, was renamed for Pitt after it was captured from the French during the Seven Years&#x27; War.

==Family and personal life==
Pitt married Lady Hester Grenville (1720–1803), daughter of the 1st Countess Temple, on 16 November 1754 by Francis Ayscough under special licence at her home in Argyle Street, London.

They had five children, born at Hayes:

* Lady Hester Pitt (19 October 175520 July 1780), who married Viscount Mahon, later the 3rd Earl Stanhope, on 19 December 1774; three children, including the traveler and Arabist Lady Hester Stanhope
* John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham (1756–1835), who married The Hon. Mary Townshend; no issue
* Lady Harriet Pitt (18 April 1758 – 1786), who married The Hon. Edward James Eliot, oldest son of the 1st Baron Eliot, in 1785; one child
* Hon. William Pitt the Younger (28 May 1759 – 23 January 1806), who also served as prime minister; never married

===References in popular culture===
* Pitt is referred to in the 1992 &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot;, where Barney and guest star Wade Boggs get into a bar fight after a heated debate over the subject of who was England&#x27;s greatest prime minister. Boggs claims Pitt the Elder was the greatest prime minister to Barney&#x27;s Lord Palmerston, causing Barney to punch Boggs in the face, knocking him unconscious.
* Pitt is briefly derided (but does not appear) in the &quot;Blackadder The Third&quot; episode &quot;Dish and Dishonesty&quot;. Blackadder states that he is &quot;about as effective as a catflap in an elephant house&quot;.
* In &quot;The Two Georges&quot;, an alternate history by Harry Turtledove, William Pitt was the prime minister during a period of political tension between Great Britain and its North American colonies. He played a significant role in easing those tensions and ensuring the colonists remained content British subjects. He was also one of the historical figures in Thomas Gainsborough&#x27;s fictional painting &quot;The Two Georges&quot;, depicting George Washington being presented to King George III.
* In 1770, Laurence Sterne dedicated his masterpiece, &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman&quot; to the rt. hon. Mr Pitt.
* In 1790, Scotland&#x27;s Bard, the poet Robert Burns, referred to Pitt in his Scots language poem, &quot;Lines To A Gentleman&quot;, which Burns composed in response to being sent a newspaper, which the gentlemen sender offered to continue providing free of charge. The poet&#x27;s satirical summary of events makes clear that he has no interest in the reports contained in the newspaper. The poem&#x27;s section on events in Parliament, which refers to Pitt as &#x27;Chatham Will&#x27;, is as follows:

<doc id="33637" wikidata="Q49855" url="?curid=33637" title="Wasabi">
<text>Wasabi (Japanese: , , or , ) or Japanese horseradish (&quot;Eutrema japonicum&quot; syn. &quot;Wasabia japonica&quot;) is a plant of the family Brassicaceae, which also includes horseradish and mustard in other genera. The plant is native to Japan, the Russian Far East including Sakhalin, and the Korean Peninsula. It grows naturally along stream beds in mountain river valleys in Japan.

Wasabi is grown for its rhizomes, which are ground into a paste as a pungent condiment for sushi and other foods. It is similar in taste to hot mustard or horseradish rather than chilli peppers, in that it stimulates the nose more than the tongue, but freshly grated wasabi has a subtly distinct flavour. The main cultivars in the marketplace are &quot;E. japonicum&quot; &#x27;Daruma&#x27; and &#x27;Mazuma&#x27;, but there are many others.

The oldest record of wasabi as a food dates to the 8th century AD. The popularity of wasabi in English-speaking countries has coincided with that of sushi, growing steadily from about 1980. Due to constraints that limit the Japanese wasabi plant&#x27;s mass cultivation and thus increase its price and decrease availability outside Japan, the western horseradish plant is widely used in place of wasabi. This is commonly referred to as &quot;western wasabi&quot; () in Japan.

== Taxonomy ==

Siebold named &quot;Cochlearia (?) wasabi&quot; in 1830, noting its use &quot;pro condimento&quot; or &quot;as a condiment&quot;; however, this is a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;, and the synonym &quot;Eutrema wasabi&quot;, published by Maximovich in 1873, is thus an illegitimate name. The wasabi plant was first described by Miquel in 1866, as &quot;Lunaria (?) japonica&quot;, from the type collected by Siebold in Japan, though the precise type locality was not recorded.

In 1899 Matsumura erected the genus &quot;Wasabia&quot;, recognising within it the species &quot;Wasabia pungens&quot; and &quot;Wasabia hederaefolia&quot;; these are now regarded as synonyms of &quot;Eutrema japonicum&quot;. In 1912 Matsumura recognised the species &quot;Wasabia japonica&quot;, treating his earlier &quot;Wasabia pungens&quot; as a synonym. In 1930, Koidzumi transferred the wasabi plant to the genus &quot;Eutrema&quot;, the correct name and author citation being &quot;Eutrema japonicum&quot; (Miq.) Koidz.

== Description ==
It has large leaves produced from long, thin stalks. They are simple and large, long and wide with palmate veins.

Wasabi flowers appear in clusters from long stems that bloom from late winter to early spring.

== Culinary uses ==
=== As condiment ===
Wasabi is mainly used to make wasabi paste, which is a pungent, spicy condiment eaten with foods like sushi. The part used for wasabi paste has been characterized as the rhizome or the stem, or the &quot;rhizome plus the base part of the stem&quot;. Stores generally sell only this part of the plant.

The fresh rhizome is grated into a paste, and eaten in small amounts at a time. Traditionally, coarse sharkskin is used to grate the root, but metal graters called &quot;oroshigane&quot; are used in modern times. Fresh wasabi paste loses its flavor quickly if left uncovered, and so the paste is grated on the spot in some high-end restaurants. Sushi chefs usually put the wasabi between the fish and the rice, to cover the wasabi and preserve its flavour.

Store-bought wasabi paste is usually made from dried wasabi powder, and sold in bottles or squeezable toothpaste-like tubes.

=== As flavoring ===

Wasabi is used to flavor many foods, especially dry snacks. are legumes (peanuts, soybeans, or peas) that are roasted or fried and then coated with wasabi powder, and eaten as a snack.

=== Others ===

Fresh wasabi leaves can be eaten raw, having a spicy flavor, but a common side effect is diarrhea. &quot;Wasabizuke&quot; is made of wasabi leaves pickled in sake lees, and is considered a specialty of Shizuoka Prefecture.

==Surrogates==
Wasabi favors growing conditions that restrict its wide cultivation – among other things, it is quite intolerant of direct sunlight, requires an air temperature between , and prefers high humidity in summer. This makes fully satisfying commercial demand impossible for growers, which makes wasabi quite expensive. Therefore, outside Japan, finding real wasabi plants is rare.

A common substitute is a mixture of horseradish, mustard, starch, and green food colouring or spinach powder. Often packages are labelled as wasabi while the ingredients do not include any part of the wasabi plant. The primary difference is colour, with wasabi being naturally green. Fresh horseradish root is described as having a similar (albeit simpler) flavor and texture to that of fresh wasabi.

In Japan, horseradish is referred to as . Outside of Japan, where fresh wasabi is hard to obtain, a powdered mixture of horseradish and mustard oil, known as , is used at a majority of sushi restaurants, including reputable ones. In the United States, true wasabi is generally found only at specialty grocers and high-end restaurants.

==Chemistry==
The chemical in wasabi that provides its initial pungency is the volatile compound allyl isothiocyanate, which is produced by hydrolysis of allyl glucosinolate, a natural thioglucoside (conjugates of the sugar glucose and sulfur-containing organic compounds); the hydrolysis reaction is catalyzed by myrosinase and occurs when the enzyme is released on cell rupture caused by maceration – e.g., grating – of the plant. The same compound is responsible for the pungency of horseradish and mustard. Allyl isothiocyanate can also be released when the wasabi plants have been damaged because it is being used as a defense mechanism. The sensory neural target of mustard oil is the chemosensory receptor, TRPA1, also known as the wasabi receptor.

The unique flavour of wasabi is a result of complex chemical mixtures from the broken cells of the plant, including those resulting from the hydrolysis of thioglucosides, including sinigrin and other glucosinolates, into glucose and methylthioalkyl isothiocyanates:

* 6-(Methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MITC)
* 7-Methylthioheptyl isothiocyanate
* 8-Methylthiooctyl isothiocyanate

Such isothiocyanates inhibit microbial growth, perhaps with implications for preserving food against spoilage and suppressing oral bacterial growth.

Because the burning sensations of wasabi are not oil-based, they are short-lived compared to the effects of capsaicin in chilli peppers and are washed away with more food or liquid. The sensation is felt primarily in the nasal passage and can be painful depending on the amount consumed. Inhaling or sniffing wasabi vapor has an effect like smelling salts, a property exploited by researchers attempting to create a smoke alarm for the deaf. One deaf subject participating in a test of the prototype awoke within 10 seconds of wasabi vapour sprayed into his sleeping chamber. The 2011 Ig Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the researchers for determining the ideal density of airborne wasabi to wake people in the event of an emergency.

==Nutritional information==
Wasabi is normally consumed in such small quantities that its nutritional value is negligible. The major constituents of raw wasabi root are carbohydrates (23.5%), water (69.1%), fat (0.63%), and protein (4.8%).

==Cultivation==
Few places are suitable for large-scale wasabi cultivation, which is difficult even in ideal conditions. In Japan, wasabi is cultivated mainly in these regions:

* Izu Peninsula in Shizuoka Prefecture (&quot;Traditional Wasabi Cultivation in Shizuoka, Japan&quot; is a Globally and Japanese Nationally Important Agricultural Heritage System)
* Nagano Prefecture including the Daio Wasabi Farm in Azumino (a popular tourist attraction and the world&#x27;s largest commercial wasabi farm)
* Iwate Prefecture
* Shimane Prefecture known as its Hikimi wasabi


Numerous artificial cultivation facilities also exist as far north as Hokkaido and as far south as Kyushu. As the demand for real wasabi is higher than that which can be produced within Japan, Japan imports copious amounts of wasabi from the United States, Canada, Taiwan, South Korea, Pakistan, Thailand and New Zealand. In North America, wasabi is cultivated by a handful of small farmers and companies in the rain forests on the coast of Western Canada, the Oregon Coast, and in areas of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee. In Europe, wasabi is grown commercially in Iceland, the Netherlands, Hungary, and the UK.

Modern cultivars of wasabi mostly derive from three traditional cultivars, &#x27;Fujidaruma&#x27;, &#x27;Shimane No. 3&#x27; and &#x27;Mazuma&#x27;. Sequencing of the chloroplastic genome, which is inherited maternally in wasabi, supports this conclusion.

<doc id="33644" wikidata="Q158281" url="?curid=33644" title="Wends">
<text>Wends ( ; ; , ; ; ; ; ) is a historical name for Slavs who inhabited present-day northeast Germany. It refers not to a homogeneous people, but to various people, tribes or groups depending on where and when it was used. In the modern day, communities identifying as Wendish exist in Slovenia, Austria, Lusatia, the United States (such as the Texas Wends), and Australia.

In German-speaking Europe during the Middle Ages, the term &quot;Wends&quot; was interpreted as synonymous with &quot;Slavs&quot; and sporadically used in literature to refer to West Slavs and South Slavs living within the Holy Roman Empire. The name has possibly survived in Finnic languages ( , , ), denoting modern Russia.

==Term==
According to one theory, Germanic peoples first applied this name to the ancient Veneti.
For the medieval Scandinavians, the term Wends (&quot;Vender&quot;) meant Slavs living near the southern shore of the Baltic Sea (&quot;Vendland&quot;), and the term was therefore used to refer to Polabian Slavs like the Obotrites, Rugian Slavs, Veleti/Lutici, and Pomeranian tribes.

For people living in the medieval Northern Holy Roman Empire and its precursors, especially for the Saxons, a Wend (&quot;Wende&quot;) was a Slav living in the area west of the River Oder, an area later entitled &quot;Germania Slavica&quot;, settled by the Polabian Slav tribes (mentioned above) in the north and by others, such as the Sorbs and the Milceni, further south (see Sorbian March).

The Germans in the south used the term &quot;Winde&quot; instead of &quot;Wende&quot; and applied it, just as the Germans in the north, to Slavs they had contact with; e.g., the Polabians from &quot;Bavaria Slavica&quot; or the Slovenes (the names Windic March, Windisch Feistritz, Windischgraz, or Windisch Bleiberg near Ferlach still bear testimony to this historical denomination). The same term was sometimes applied to the neighboring region of Slavonia, which appears as Windischland in some documents prior to the 18th century.

Following the 8th century, the Frankish kings and their successors organised nearly all Wendish land into marches. This process later turned into the series of Crusades. By the 12th century, all Wendish lands had become part of the Holy Roman Empire. In the course of the Ostsiedlung, which reached its peak in the 12th to 14th centuries, this land was settled by Germans and reorganised.

Due to the process of assimilation following German settlement, many Slavs west of the Oder adopted the German culture and language. Only some rural communities which did not have a strong admixture with Germans and continued to use West Slavic languages were still termed &quot;Wends&quot;. With the gradual decline of the use of these local Slavic tongues, the term &quot;Wends&quot; slowly disappeared, too.

Some sources claim that in the 13th century there were actual historic people called Wends or Vends living as far as northern Latvia (east of the Baltic Sea) around the city of Wenden. Henry of Livonia (Henricus de Lettis) in his 13th-century Latin chronicle described a tribe called the &quot;Vindi&quot;.

Today, only one group of &quot;Wends&quot; still exists: the Lusatian Sorbs in present-day Eastern Germany, with international diaspora.

==Roman-era Veneti==
The term &quot;Wends&quot; derived from the Roman-era people called in , or ; in . This people is mentioned by Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy as inhabiting the Baltic coast.

==History==

===Rise (500–1000)===
In the 1st millennium AD, during the Slavic migrations which split the Slavs into Southern, Eastern and Western groups, some West Slavs moved into the areas between the Rivers Elbe and Oder - moving from east to west and from south to north. There they assimilated the remaining Germanic population that had not left the area in the Migration period. Their German neighbours adapted the term they had been using for peoples east of the River Elbe before to the Slavs, calling them &quot;Wends&quot; as they called the &quot;Venedi&quot; before and probably the &quot;Vandals&quot; as well. In his late sixth century work &quot;History of Armenia&quot;, Movses Khorenatsi mentions their raids into the lands named Vanand after them.

The Wends are mentioned in Fredegar IV.74-75. The lived east of the river Elbe and were neighbours of the Saxons. The Saxons paid tribute to the Merovingian Kingdom since Chlothar I (511-561). They had to pay 500 cows yearly and had the obligation to guard the sector of the Frankish border against the Wends. However, the Saxons broke their oath under Dagobert I which resulted in frequent raids of Wends into Frankish territory and spreading out over Thuringia and other territory. The Saxon duplicity is one of the reasons for future military campaigns against them by the Carolingians, especially Charles Martel and Charlemagne.

While the Wends were arriving in so-called &quot;Germania Slavica&quot; as large homogeneous groups, they soon divided into a variety of small tribes, with large strips of woodland separating one tribal settlement area from another. Their tribal names were derived from local place names, sometimes adopting the Germanic tradition (e.g. Heveller from &quot;Havel&quot;, Rujanes from Rugians). Settlements were secured by round &quot;burghs&quot; made of wood and clay, where either people could retreat in case of a raid from the neighbouring tribe or used as military strongholds or outposts.

Some tribes unified into larger, duchy-like units. For example, the Obotrites evolved from the unification of the &quot;Holstein&quot; and Western &quot;Mecklenburg&quot; tribes led by mighty dukes known for their raids into German Saxony. The Lutici were an alliance of tribes living between Obotrites and Pomeranians. They did not unify under a duke, but remained independent. Their leaders met in the temple of Rethra.

In 983, many Wend tribes participated in a great uprising against the Holy Roman Empire, which had previously established Christian missions, German colonies and German administrative institutions (&quot;Marken&quot; such as &quot;Nordmark&quot; and &quot;Billungermark&quot;) in pagan Wendish territories. The uprising was successful and the Wends delayed Germanisation for about two centuries.

Wends and Danes had early and continuous contact including settlement, first and mainly through the closest South Danish islands of Møn, Lolland and Falster, all having place-names of Wendish origin. There were also trading and settlement outposts by Danish towns as important as Roskilde, when it was the capital: &#x27;Vindeboder&#x27; (Wends&#x27; booths) is the name of a city neighbourhood there. Danes and Wends also fought wars due to piracy and crusading.

===Decline (1000–1200)===

After their successes in 983 the Wends came under increasing pressure from Germans, Danes and Poles. The Poles invaded Pomerania several times. The Danes often raided the Baltic shores (and, in turn, the Wends often raided the raiders). The Holy Roman Empire and its margraves tried to restore their marches.

In 1068/69, a German expedition took and destroyed Rethra, one of the major pagan Wend temples. The Wendish religious centre shifted to Arkona thereafter. In 1124 and 1128, the Pomeranians and some Lutici were baptised. In 1147, the &quot;Wend crusade&quot; took place in what is today north-eastern Germany.

This did not, however, affect the Wendish people in today&#x27;s Saxony, where a relatively stable co-existence of German and Slavic inhabitants as well as close dynastic and diplomatic cooperation of Wendish and German nobility had been achieved. (See: Wiprecht of Groitzsch).

In 1168, during the Northern Crusades, Denmark mounted a crusade led by Bishop Absalon and King Valdemar the Great against the Wends of Rugia in order to convert them to Christianity. The crusaders captured and destroyed Arkona, the Wendish temple-fortress, and tore down the statue of the Wendish god Svantevit. With the capitulation of the Rugian Wends, the last independent pagan Wends were defeated by the surrounding Christian feudal powers.

From the 12th to the 14th centuries, Germanic settlers moved into the Wendish lands in large numbers, transforming the area&#x27;s culture from a Slavic to a Germanic one. Local dukes and monasteries invited settlers to repopulate farmlands devastated in the wars, as well as to cultivate new farmlands from the expansive woodlands and heavy soils, with the use of iron-based agricultural tools that had developed in Western Europe. Concurrently, a large number of new towns were created under German town law with the introduction of legally enforced markets, contracts and property rights. These developments over two centuries were collectively known as the (German eastward expansion). A minority of Germanic settlers moved beyond the Wendish territory into Hungary, Bohemia and Poland, where they were generally welcomed for their skills in farming and craftsmanship.

The Polabian language was spoken in the central area of Lower Saxony and in Brandenburg until around the 17th or 18th century. The German population assimilated most of the Wends, meaning that they disappeared as an ethnic minority - except for the Sorbs. Yet many place names and some family names in eastern Germany still show Wendish origins today. Also, the Dukes of Mecklenburg, of Rügen and of Pomerania had Wendish ancestors.

Between 1540 and 1973, the kings of Sweden were officially called &quot;kings of the Swedes, the Goths and the Wends&quot; (; ). After the Danish monarch Queen Margrethe II chose not to use these titles in 1972 the Swedish monarch, Carl XVI Gustaf also chose only to use the title King of Sweden&quot; (), thereby changing an age-old tradition.

From the Middle Ages, the kings of Denmark and of Denmark–Norway used the titles &quot;King of the Wends&quot; (from 1362) and &quot;Goths&quot; (from the 12th century). The use of both titles was discontinued in 1973.

==Legacy==

The Wendish people co-existed with the German settlers for centuries and became gradually assimilated into the German-speaking culture.

The Golden Bull of 1356 (one of the constitutional foundations of the German-Roman Empire) explicitly recognised in its Art. 31 that the German-Roman Empire was a multi-national entity with &quot;diverse nations distinct in customs, manner of life, and in language&quot;. For that it stipulated &quot;the sons, or heirs and successors of the illustrious prince electors, ... since they are expected in all likelihood to have naturally acquired the German language, ... shall be instructed in the grammar of the Italian and Slavic (i.e. Wendish) tongues, beginning with the seventh Year of their age.&quot;

Many geographical names in Central Germany and northern Germany can be traced back to a Slavic origin. Typical Slavic endings include -itz, -itzsch and -ow. They can be found in city names such as Delitzsch and Rochlitz. Even names of major cities like Leipzig and Berlin are most likely of Wendish origin.

Today, the only remaining minority people of Wendish origin, the Sorbs, maintain their traditional languages and culture and enjoy cultural self-determination exercised through the Domowina. The third minister president of Saxony Stanislaw Tillich (2008–2017) is of Sorbian origin, being the first head of a German federal state with an ethnic minority background.

===The Texas Wends===
In 1854, the Wends of Texas departed Lusatia in north central Europe on the &quot;Ben Nevis&quot; seeking greater liberty, in order to settle an area of central Texas, primarily Serbin. The Wends succeeded, expanding into Warda, Giddings, Austin, Houston, Fedor, Swiss Alp, Port Arthur, Mannheim, Copperas Cove, Vernon, Walburg, The Grove, Bishop, and the Rio Grande Valley.

A strong influence of the Wendish pioneers remains evident today in thousands of families (many unaware of their background) descended from them.
==Other uses==
Historically, the term &quot;Wends&quot; has also occurred in the following contexts:

* Until the mid-19th century, German speakers most commonly used the name &quot;Wenden&quot; to refer to Slovenes. This usage is mirrored in the name of the Windic March, a medieval territory in present-day Lower Carniola, which merged with the Duchy of Carniola by the mid 15th century. With the diffusion of the term &quot;slowenisch&quot; for the Slovene language and &quot;Slowenen&quot; for Slovenes, the words &quot;windisch&quot; and &quot;Winde&quot; or &quot;Wende&quot; became derogatory in connotation. The same development could be seen in the case of the Hungarian Slovenes, who used to be known under the name &quot;Vends&quot;.
** was a 1927 work by , a Carinthian German nationalist historian.
* It was also used to denote the Slovaks in German-language texts before c. 1400.
* The German term &quot;Windischland&quot; was used in the Middle Ages for the historical Kingdom of Slavonia (in Croatia). The terms &quot;Veneta&quot;, &quot;Wenden&quot;, &quot;Winden&quot; etc. were used in reference to the westernmost Slavs in the 1st and 2nd century CE, as a reference to the name of the earlier tribes of Veneti.

<text>A blog (a truncation of &quot;weblog&quot;) is an informational website consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. In the 2000s, blogs were often the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s, &quot;multi-author blogs&quot; (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other &quot;microblogging&quot; systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. &quot;Blog&quot; can also be used as a verb, meaning &quot;to maintain or add content to a blog&quot;.

The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or computer programming. Previously, knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content on the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts. As of the 2010s, the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites. In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers not only produce content to post on their blogs but also often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers. Blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online comments to remove hate speech or other offensive content. There are also high-readership blogs which do not allow comments.

Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from philosophy, religion, and arts to science, politics, and sports. Others function as more personal online diaries or online brand advertising of a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text, digital images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (&quot;art blogs&quot;), photographs (&quot;photoblogs&quot;), videos (&quot;video blogs&quot; or &quot;vlogs&quot;), music (&quot;MP3 blogs&quot;), and audio (&quot;podcasts&quot;). In education, blogs can be used as instructional resources; these are referred to as &quot;edublogs&quot;. Microblogging is another type of blogging, featuring very short posts.

&quot;Blog&quot; and &quot;blogging&quot; are now loosely used for content creation and sharing on social media, especially when the content is long-form and one creates and shares content on a regular basis, so one could be maintaining a blog on Facebook or blogging on Instagram. A 2022 estimate suggested that there were over 600 million public blogs out of more than 1.9 billion websites.

==History==

The term &quot;weblog&quot; was coined by Jorn Barger on December 17, 1997. The short form &quot;blog&quot; was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word &quot;weblog&quot; into the phrase &quot;we blog&quot; in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in May 1999. Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used &quot;blog&quot; as both a noun and verb (&quot;to blog&quot;, meaning &quot;to edit one&#x27;s weblog or to post to one&#x27;s weblog&quot;) and devised the term &quot;blogger&quot; in connection with Pyra Labs&#x27; Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.

===Origins===
Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including Usenet, commercial online services such as GEnie, Byte Information Exchange (BIX) and the early CompuServe, e-mail lists, and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS). In the 1990s, Internet forum software created running conversations with &quot;threads&quot;. Threads are topical connections between messages on a virtual &quot;corkboard&quot;.

Berners-Lee also created what is considered by Encyclopedia Britannica to be &quot;the first &#x27;blog in 1992 to discuss the progress made on creating the World Wide Web and software used for it.

From June 14, 1993, Mosaic Communications Corporation maintained their &quot;What&#x27;s New&quot; list of new websites, updated daily and archived monthly. The page was accessible by a special &quot;What&#x27;s New&quot; button in the Mosaic web browser.

In November 1993 Ranjit Bhatnagar started writing about interesting sites, pages and discussion groups he found on the internet, as well as some personal information, on his website Moonmilk, arranging them chronologically in a special section called Ranjit&#x27;s HTTP Playground. Other early pioneers of blogging, such as Justin Hall, credit him with being an inspiration.

The earliest instance of a commercial blog was on the first business to consumer Web site created in 1995 by Ty, Inc., which featured a blog in a section called &quot;Online Diary&quot;. The entries were maintained by featured Beanie Babies that were voted for monthly by Web site visitors.

The modern blog evolved from the online diary where people would keep a running account of the events in their personal lives. Most such writers called themselves diarists, journalists, or journalers. Justin Hall, who began personal blogging in 1994 while a student at Swarthmore College, is generally recognized as one of the earlier bloggers, as is Jerry Pournelle. Dave Winer&#x27;s Scripting News is also credited with being one of the older and longer running weblogs. The Australian Netguide magazine maintained the Daily Net News on their web site from 1996. Daily Net News ran links and daily reviews of new websites, mostly in Australia.

Another early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, an online shared diary of a person&#x27;s personal life combining text, digital video, and digital pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site in 1994. This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as sousveillance, and such journals were also used as evidence in legal matters. Some early bloggers, such as The Misanthropic Bitch, who began in 1997, referred to their online presence as a zine, before the term blog entered common usage.

The first research paper about blogging was Torill Mortensen and Jill Walker Rettberg&#x27;s paper &quot;Blogging Thoughts&quot;, which analysed how blogs were being used to foster research communities and the exchange of ideas and scholarship, and how this new means of networking overturns traditional power structures.

===Technology===
Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common Websites. In 1995, the &quot;Online Diary&quot; on the Ty, Inc. Web site was produced and updated manually before any blogging programs were available. Posts were made to appear in reverse chronological order by manually updating text-based HTML code using FTP software in real time several times a day. To users, this offered the appearance of a live diary that contained multiple new entries per day. At the beginning of each new day, new diary entries were manually coded into a new HTML file, and at the start of each month, diary entries were archived into their own folder, which contained a separate HTML page for every day of the month. Then, menus that contained links to the most recent diary entry were updated manually throughout the site. This text-based method of organizing thousands of files served as a springboard to define future blogging styles that were captured by blogging software developed years later.

The evolution of electronic and software tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible for a much larger and less technically-inclined population. Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of &quot;blogging&quot;. Blogs can be hosted by dedicated blog hosting services, on regular web hosting services, or run using blog software.

===Rise in popularity===
After a slow start, blogging rapidly gained in popularity. Blog usage spread during 1999 and the years following, being further popularized by the near-simultaneous arrival of the first hosted blog tools:
* Bruce Ableson launched Open Diary in October 1998, which soon grew to thousands of online diaries. Open Diary innovated the reader comment, becoming the first blog community where readers could add comments to other writers&#x27; blog entries.
* Brad Fitzpatrick started LiveJournal in March 1999.
* Andrew Smales created Pitas.com in July 1999 as an easier alternative to maintaining a &quot;news page&quot; on a Web site, followed by DiaryLand in September 1999, focusing more on a personal diary community.
* Blogger (blogspot.com) was launched in 1999
===Political impact===
An early milestone in the rise in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. Senator Lott, at a party honoring U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president. Lott&#x27;s critics saw these comments as tacit approval of racial segregation, a policy advocated by Thurmond&#x27;s 1948 presidential campaign. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See Josh Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Talking Points Memo&quot;.) Though Lott&#x27;s comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story. Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.

Similarly, blogs were among the driving forces behind the &quot;Rathergate&quot; scandal. Television journalist Dan Rather presented documents on the CBS show &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that conflicted with accepted accounts of President Bush&#x27;s military service record. Bloggers declared the documents to be forgeries and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view. Consequently, CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques (see: Little Green Footballs). The impact of these stories gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination.

In Russia, some political bloggers have started to challenge the dominance of official, overwhelmingly pro-government media. Bloggers such as Rustem Adagamov and Alexei Navalny have many followers, and the latter&#x27;s nickname for the ruling United Russia party as the &quot;party of crooks and thieves&quot; has been adopted by anti-regime protesters. This led to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; calling Navalny &quot;the man Vladimir Putin fears most&quot; in March 2012.

===Mainstream popularity===
By 2004, the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream, as political consultants, news services, and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming. Blogging was established by politicians and political candidates to express opinions on war and other issues and cemented blogs&#x27; role as a news source. (See Howard Dean and Wesley Clark.) Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the UK&#x27;s Labour Party&#x27;s Member of Parliament (MP) Tom Watson, began to blog to bond with constituents. In January 2005, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine listed eight bloggers whom business people &quot;could not ignore&quot;: Peter Rojas, Xeni Jardin, Ben Trott, Mena Trott, Jonathan Schwartz, Jason Goldman, Robert Scoble, and Jason Calacanis.

Israel was among the first national governments to set up an official blog. Under David Saranga, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs became active in adopting Web 2.0 initiatives, including an official video blog and a political blog. The Foreign Ministry also held a microblogging press conference via Twitter about its war with Hamas, with Saranga answering questions from the public in common text-messaging abbreviations during a live worldwide press conference. The questions and answers were later posted on IsraelPolitik, the country&#x27;s official political blog.

The impact of blogging on the mainstream media has also been acknowledged by governments. In 2009, the presence of the American journalism industry had declined to the point that several newspaper corporations were filing for bankruptcy, resulting in less direct competition between newspapers within the same circulation area. Discussion emerged as to whether the newspaper industry would benefit from a stimulus package by the federal government. U.S. President Barack Obama acknowledged the emerging influence of blogging upon society by saying, &quot;if the direction of the news is all blogosphere, all opinions, with no serious fact-checking, no serious attempts to put stories in context, then what you will end up getting is people shouting at each other across the void, but not a lot of mutual understanding&quot;. Between 2009 and 2012, an Orwell Prize for blogging was awarded.

In the late 2000s, blogs were often used on business websites and for grassroots political activism.

==Types==

There are many different types of blogs, differing not only in the type of content, but also in the way that content is delivered or written.

;Personal blogs: The personal blog is an ongoing online diary or commentary written by an individual, rather than a corporation or organization. While the vast majority of personal blogs attract very few readers, other than the blogger&#x27;s immediate family and friends, a small number of personal blogs have become popular, to the point that they have attracted lucrative advertising sponsorship. A tiny number of personal bloggers have become famous, both in the online community and in the real world.

;Collaborative blogs or group blogs: A type of weblog in which posts are written and published by more than one author. The majority of high-profile collaborative blogs are organised according to a single uniting theme, such as politics, technology or advocacy. In recent years, the blogosphere has seen the emergence and growing popularity of more collaborative efforts, often set up by already established bloggers wishing to pool time and resources, both to reduce the pressure of maintaining a popular website and to attract a larger readership.

;Microblogging: Microblogging is the practice of posting small pieces of digital content—which could be text, pictures, links, short videos, or other media—on the internet. Microblogging offers a portable communication mode that feels organic and spontaneous to many users. It has captured the public imagination, in part because the short posts are easy to read on the go or when waiting. Friends use it to keep in touch, business associates use it to coordinate meetings or share useful resources, and celebrities and politicians (or their publicists) microblog about concert dates, lectures, book releases, or tour schedules. A wide and growing range of add-on tools enables sophisticated updates and interaction with other applications. The resulting profusion of functionality is helping to define new possibilities for this type of communication. Examples of these include Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and, by far the largest, Weibo.

;Corporate and organizational blogs: A blog can be private, as in most cases, or it can be for business or not-for-profit organization or government purposes. Blogs used internally and only available to employees via an Intranet are called corporate blogs. Companies use internal corporate blogs to enhance the communication, culture and employee engagement in a corporation. Internal corporate blogs can be used to communicate news about company policies or procedures, build employee esprit de corps and improve morale. Companies and other organizations also use external, publicly accessible blogs for marketing, branding, or public relations purposes. Some organizations have a blog authored by their executive; in practice, many of these executive blog posts are penned by a ghostwriter who makes posts in the style of the credited author. Similar blogs for clubs and societies are called club blogs, group blogs, or by similar names; typical use is to inform members and other interested parties of club and member activities.

;Aggregated blogs: Individuals or organization may aggregate selected feeds on a specific topic, product or service and provide a combined view for its readers. This allows readers to concentrate on reading instead of searching for quality on-topic content and managing subscriptions. Many such aggregations called planets from name of Planet (software) that perform such aggregation, hosting sites usually have &quot;planet.&quot; subdomain in domain name (like http://planet.gnome.org/).

;By genre: Some blogs focus on a particular subject, such as political blogs, journalism blogs, health blogs, travel blogs (also known as &quot;travelogs&quot;), gardening blogs, house blogs, Book Blogs, fashion blogs, beauty blogs, lifestyle blogs, party blogs, wedding blogs, photography blogs, project blogs, psychology blogs, sociology blogs, education blogs, niche blogs, classical music blogs, quizzing blogs, legal blogs (often referred to as a blawgs), or dreamlogs. How-to/Tutorial blogs are becoming increasing popular. Two common types of genre blogs are art blogs and music blogs. A blog featuring discussions, especially about home and family is not uncommonly called a mom blog. While not a legitimate type of blog, one used for the sole purpose of spamming is known as a splog.

;By media type: A blog comprising videos is called a vlog, one comprising links is called a linklog, a site containing a portfolio of sketches is called a sketchblog or one comprising photos is called a photoblog. Blogs with shorter posts and mixed media types are called tumblelogs. Blogs that are written on typewriters and then scanned are called typecast or typecast blogs. A rare type of blog hosted on the Gopher Protocol is known as a phlog.

;By device: A blog can also be defined by which type of device is used to compose it. A blog written by a mobile device like a mobile phone or PDA could be called a moblog. One early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, an online shared diary of a person&#x27;s personal life combining text, video, and pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site. This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as sousveillance. Such journals have been used as evidence in legal matters.

;Reverse blog: A reverse blog is composed by its users rather than a single blogger. This system has the characteristics of a blog and the writing of several authors. These can be written by several contributing authors on a topic or opened up for anyone to write. There is typically some limit to the number of entries to keep it from operating like a web forum.

==Community and cataloging==

;Blogosphere: The collective community of all blogs and blog authors, particularly notable and widely read blogs, is known as the &quot;blogosphere&quot;. Since all blogs are on the internet by definition, they may be seen as interconnected and socially networked, through blogrolls, comments, linkbacks (refbacks, trackbacks or pingbacks), and backlinks. Discussions &quot;in the blogosphere&quot; were occasionally used by the media as a gauge of public opinion on various issues. Because new, untapped communities of bloggers and their readers can emerge in the space of a few years, Internet marketers pay close attention to &quot;trends in the blogosphere&quot;.

;Blog search engines: Several blog search engines have been used to search blog contents, such as Bloglines (defunct), BlogScope (defunct), and Technorati (defunct).

;Blogging communities and directories: Several online communities exist that connect people to blogs and bloggers to other bloggers. Interest-specific blogging platforms are also available. For instance, Blogster has a sizable community of political bloggers among its members. Global Voices aggregates international bloggers, &quot;with emphasis on voices that are not ordinarily heard in international mainstream media.&quot;

;Blogging and advertising: It is common for blogs to feature banner advertisements or promotional content, either to financially benefit the blogger, support website hosting costs, or to promote the blogger&#x27;s favourite causes or products. The popularity of blogs has also given rise to &quot;fake blogs&quot; in which a company will create a fictional blog as a marketing tool to promote a product.

As the popularity of blogging continued to rise (as of 2006), the commercialisation of blogging is rapidly increasing. Many corporations and companies collaborate with bloggers to increase advertising and engage online communities with their products. In the book &quot;Fans, Bloggers, and Gamers&quot;, Henry Jenkins stated that &quot;Bloggers take knowledge into their own hands, enabling successful navigation within and between these emerging knowledge cultures. One can see such behaviour as co-optation into commodity culture insofar as it sometimes collaborates with corporate interests, but one can also see it as increasing the diversity of media culture, providing opportunities for greater inclusiveness, and making more responsive to consumers.&quot;

==Early popularity==
*Before 2006: The blogdex project was launched by researchers in the MIT Media Lab to crawl the Web and gather data from thousands of blogs to investigate their social properties. Information was gathered by the tool for over four years, during which it autonomously tracked the most contagious information spreading in the blog community, ranking it by recency and popularity. It can, therefore, be considered the first instantiation of a memetracker. The project was replaced by tailrank.com, which in turn has been replaced by spinn3r.com.
*2006: Blogs are given rankings by Alexa Internet (web hits of Alexa Toolbar users), and formerly by blog search engine Technorati based on the number of incoming links (Technorati stopped doing this in 2014). In August 2006, Technorati found that the most linked-to blog on the internet was that of Chinese actress Xu Jinglei. Chinese media Xinhua reported that this blog received more than 50 million page views, claiming it to be the most popular blog in the world at the time. Technorati rated Boing Boing to be the most-read group-written blog.

*2008: , blogging had &quot;become such a mania that a new blog was created every second of every minute of every hour of every day.&quot; Researchers have actively analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular. There are essentially two measures of this: popularity through citations, as well as popularity through affiliation (i.e., blogroll). The basic conclusion from studies of the structure of blogs is that while it takes time for a blog to become popular through blogrolls, permalinks can boost popularity more quickly and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls since they denote that people are reading the blog&#x27;s content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases.

==Software==

Blogs are a form of websites and can therefore be created via the same software as can be used for creating websites. Many people use managed platforms such as Medium (website) or Substack. These platforms have built-in support for many features such as previewing posts, paywalls, and newsletters. Other people self-host their website via open source software such as WordPress or static site generators such as Hugo (software) or Jekyll (software).

==Blurring with the mass media==
Many bloggers, particularly those engaged in participatory journalism, are amateur journalists, and thus they differentiate themselves from the professional reporters and editors who work in mainstream media organizations. Other bloggers are media professionals who are publishing online, rather than via a TV station or newspaper, either as an add-on to a traditional media presence (e.g., hosting a radio show or writing a column in a paper newspaper), or as their sole journalistic output. Some institutions and organizations see blogging as a means of &quot;getting around the filter&quot; of media &quot;gatekeepers&quot; and pushing their messages directly to the public. Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs—well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net&#x27;s J-blog list. The first known use of a blog on a news site was in August 1998, when Jonathan Dube of &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie.

Some bloggers have moved over to other media. The following bloggers (and others) have appeared on radio and television: Duncan Black (known widely by his pseudonym, Atrios), Glenn Reynolds (Instapundit), Markos Moulitsas Zúniga (Daily Kos), Alex Steffen (Worldchanging), Ana Marie Cox (Wonkette), Nate Silver (FiveThirtyEight.com), and Ezra Klein (Ezra Klein blog in &quot;The American Prospect,&quot; now in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;). In counterpoint, Hugh Hewitt exemplifies a mass media personality who has moved in the other direction, adding to his reach in &quot;old media&quot; by being an influential blogger. Similarly, it was &quot;Emergency Preparedness and Safety Tips On Air and Online&quot; blog articles that captured Surgeon General of the United States Richard Carmona&#x27;s attention and earned his kudos for the associated broadcasts by talk show host Lisa Tolliver and Westchester Emergency Volunteer Reserves-Medical Reserve Corps Director Marianne Partridge.

Blogs have also had an influence on minority languages, bringing together scattered speakers and learners; this is particularly so with blogs in Gaelic languages. Minority language publishing (which may lack economic feasibility) can find its audience through inexpensive blogging. There are examples of bloggers who have published books based on their blogs, e.g., Salam Pax, Ellen Simonetti, Jessica Cutler, and ScrappleFace. Blog-based books have been given the name blook. A prize for the best blog-based book was initiated in 2005, the Lulu Blooker Prize. However, success has been elusive offline, with many of these books not selling as well as their blogs. The book based on Julie Powell&#x27;s blog &quot;The Julie/Julia Project&quot; was made into the film &quot;Julie &amp; Julia&quot;, apparently the first to do so.

==Consumer-generated advertising==
Consumer-generated advertising is a relatively new and controversial development, and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers. Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts. These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords. Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites. On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established to take advantage of this new development as well. However, there are many people who look negatively on this new development. Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere&#x27;s credibility.

==Legal and social consequences==

Blogging can result in a range of legal liabilities and other unforeseen consequences.

===Defamation or liability===
Several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers concerning issues of defamation or liability. U.S. payouts related to blogging totalled $17.4 million by 2009; in some cases these have been covered by umbrella insurance. The courts have returned with mixed verdicts. Internet Service Providers (ISPs), in general, are immune from liability for information that originates with third parties (U.S. Communications Decency Act and the EU Directive 2000/31/EC). In &quot;Doe v. Cahill&quot;, the Delaware Supreme Court held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask the anonymous bloggers and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the trial court for reconsideration. In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to obtain the identity of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town&#x27;s mayor, Councilman Cahill&#x27;s political rival. The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial.

In January 2007, two prominent Malaysian political bloggers, Jeff Ooi and Ahirudin Attan, were sued by a pro-government newspaper, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad, Kalimullah bin Masheerul Hassan, Hishamuddin bin Aun and Brenden John a/l John Pereira over alleged defamation. The plaintiff was supported by the Malaysian government. Following the suit, the Malaysian government proposed to &quot;register&quot; all bloggers in Malaysia to better control parties against their interests. This is the first such legal case against bloggers in the country. In the United States, blogger Aaron Wall was sued by Traffic Power for defamation and publication of trade secrets in 2005. According to &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, Traffic Power had been &quot;banned from Google for allegedly rigging search engine results.&quot; Wall and other &quot;white hat&quot; search engine optimization consultants had exposed Traffic Power in what they claim was an effort to protect the public. The case was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, and Traffic Power failed to appeal within the allowed time.

In 2009, NDTV issued a legal notice to Indian blogger Kunte for a blog post criticizing their coverage of the Mumbai attacks. The blogger unconditionally withdrew his post, which resulted in several Indian bloggers criticizing NDTV for trying to silence critics.

===Employment===
Employees who blog about elements of their place of employment can begin to affect the reputation of their employer, either in a positive way, if the employee is praising the employer and its workplaces, or in a negative way, if the blogger is making negative comments about the company or its practices.

In general, attempts by employee bloggers to protect themselves by maintaining anonymity have proved ineffective. In 2009, a controversial and landmark decision by The Hon. Mr Justice Eady refused to grant an order to protect the anonymity of Richard Horton. Horton was a police officer in the United Kingdom who blogged about his job under the name &quot;NightJack&quot;.

Delta Air Lines fired flight attendant Ellen Simonetti because she posted photographs of herself in uniform on an aeroplane and because of comments posted on her blog &quot;Queen of Sky: Diary of a Flight Attendant&quot; which the employer deemed inappropriate. This case highlighted the issue of personal blogging and freedom of expression versus employer rights and responsibilities, and so it received wide media attention. Simonetti took legal action against the airline for &quot;wrongful termination, defamation of character and lost future wages&quot;. The suit was postponed while Delta was in bankruptcy proceedings.

In early 2006, Erik Ringmar, a senior lecturer at the London School of Economics, was ordered by the convenor of his department to &quot;take down and destroy&quot; his blog in which he discussed the quality of education at the school.

Mark Jen was terminated in 2005 after 10 days of employment as an assistant product manager at Google for discussing corporate secrets on his personal blog, then called 99zeros and hosted on the Google-owned Blogger service. He blogged about unreleased products and company finances a week before the company&#x27;s earnings announcement. He was fired two days after he complied with his employer&#x27;s request to remove the sensitive material from his blog.

In India, blogger Gaurav Sabnis resigned from IBM after his posts questioned the claims made by a management school. Jessica Cutler, aka &quot;The Washingtonienne&quot;, blogged about her sex life while employed as a congressional assistant. After the blog was discovered and she was fired, she wrote a novel based on her experiences and blog: &quot;The Washingtonienne: A Novel&quot;. , Cutler is being sued by one of her former lovers in a case that could establish the extent to which bloggers are obligated to protect the privacy of their real life associates.

Catherine Sanderson, a.k.a. Petite Anglaise, lost her job in Paris at a British accountancy firm because of blogging. Although given in the blog in a fairly anonymous manner, some of the descriptions of the firm and some of its people were less than flattering. Sanderson later won a compensation claim case against the British firm, however.

On the other hand, Penelope Trunk wrote an upbeat article in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; in 2006, entitled &quot;Blogs &#x27;essential&#x27; to a good career&quot;. She was one of the first journalists to point out that a large portion of bloggers are professionals and that a well-written blog can help attract employers.

====Business owners====
Business owners who blog about their business can also run into legal consequences. Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, was fined during the 2006 NBA playoffs for criticizing NBA officials on the court and in his blog.

===Political dangers===

Blogging can sometimes have unforeseen consequences in politically sensitive areas. In some countries, Internet police or secret police may monitor blogs and arrest blog authors or commentators. Blogs can be much harder to control than broadcast or print media because a person can create a blog whose authorship is hard to trace by using anonymity technology such as Tor. As a result, totalitarian and authoritarian regimes often seek to suppress blogs and punish those who maintain them.

In Singapore, two ethnic Chinese individuals were imprisoned under the country&#x27;s anti-sedition law for posting anti-Muslim remarks in their blogs. Egyptian blogger Kareem Amer was charged with insulting the Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and an Islamic institution through his blog. It is the first time in the history of Egypt that a blogger was prosecuted. After a brief trial session that took place in Alexandria, the blogger was found guilty and sentenced to prison terms of three years for insulting Islam and inciting sedition and one year for insulting Mubarak. Egyptian blogger Abdel Monem Mahmoud was arrested in April 2007 for anti-government writings in his blog. Monem is a member of the then banned Muslim Brotherhood. After the 2011 Egyptian revolution, the Egyptian blogger Maikel Nabil Sanad was charged with insulting the military for an article he wrote on his personal blog and sentenced to three years.

After expressing opinions in his personal blog about the state of the Sudanese armed forces, Jan Pronk, United Nations Special Representative for Sudan, was given three days notice to leave Sudan. The Sudanese army had demanded his deportation. In Myanmar, Nay Phone Latt, a blogger, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for posting a cartoon critical of head of state Than Shwe.

===Personal safety===

One consequence of blogging is the possibility of online or in-person attacks or threats against the blogger, sometimes without apparent reason. In some cases, bloggers have faced cyberbullying. Kathy Sierra, author of the blog &quot;Creating Passionate Users&quot;, was the target of threats and misogynistic insults to the point that she cancelled her keynote speech at a technology conference in San Diego, fearing for her safety. While a blogger&#x27;s anonymity is often tenuous, Internet trolls who would attack a blogger with threats or insults can be emboldened by the anonymity of the online environment, where some users are known only by a pseudonymous &quot;username&quot; (e.g., &quot;Hacker1984&quot;). Sierra and supporters initiated an online discussion aimed at countering abusive online behaviour and developed a Blogger&#x27;s Code of Conduct, which set out a rules for behaviour in the online space.

<doc id="33651" wikidata="Q19871" url="?curid=33651" title="Waiting for Godot">
<text>Waiting for Godot ( or ) is a play by Irish playwright Samuel Beckett in which two characters, Vladimir (Didi) and Estragon (Gogo), engage in a variety of discussions and encounters while awaiting the titular Godot, who never arrives. &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; is Beckett&#x27;s reworking of his own original French-language play, , and is subtitled (in English only) &quot;a tragicomedy in two acts&quot;. In a poll conducted by the British Royal National Theatre in 1998/99, it was voted as, &quot;the most significant English-language play of the 20th century&quot;.

The original French text was composed between 9 October 1948 and 29 January 1949. The premiere, directed by Roger Blin, was on 5 January 1953 at the , Paris. The English-language version of the play premiered in London in 1955.

==Plot==
===Act I ===
The play opens with two bedraggled acquaintances, Vladimir and Estragon, meeting by a leafless tree. Estragon notifies Vladimir of his most recent troubles: he spent the previous night lying in a ditch and received a beating from a number of anonymous assailants. The duo discuss a variety of issues at length, none of any apparent significance, and it is finally revealed that they are awaiting a man named Godot. They are not certain if they have ever met Godot, nor if he will even arrive.

Subsequently, an imperious traveller named Pozzo, along with his silent slave Lucky, arrives and pauses to converse with Vladimir and Estragon. Lucky is bound by a rope held by Pozzo, who forces Lucky to carry his heavy bags and physically punishes him if he deems Lucky&#x27;s movements too lethargic. Pozzo states that he is on the way to the market, at which he intends to sell Lucky for profit. Following Pozzo&#x27;s command &quot;Think!&quot;, the otherwise mute Lucky performs a sudden dance and monologue: a torrent of academic-sounding phrases mixed with pure nonsense. Pozzo and Lucky depart, leaving the bewildered Estragon and Vladimir to continue their wait for the absent Godot.

Eventually, a boy shows up and explains to Vladimir and Estragon that he is a messenger from Godot, and that Godot will not be arriving tonight, but surely tomorrow. Vladimir asks for descriptions of Godot, receiving only extremely brief or vague answers from the boy, who soon exits. Vladimir and Estragon then announce that they will also leave, but they remain onstage without moving.

===Act II===
Vladimir and Estragon are again waiting near the tree, which has grown a number of leaves since it was last seen in Act 1. Both men are still awaiting Godot. Lucky and Pozzo eventually reappear, but not as they were previously. Pozzo has become blind and Lucky is now fully mute. Pozzo cannot recall ever having met Vladimir and Estragon, who themselves cannot agree on when they last saw the travellers. Lucky and Pozzo exit shortly after their spirited encounter, leaving Vladimir and Estragon to go on waiting.

Soon after, the boy reappears to report that Godot will not be coming. The boy states that he has not met Vladimir and Estragon before and he is not the same boy who talked to Vladimir yesterday, which causes Vladimir to burst into a rage at the child, demanding that the boy remember him the next day so as to avoid repeating this encounter once more. After the boy exits, Vladimir and Estragon consider suicide, but they do not have a rope with which to hang themselves. They decide to leave and return the day after with a rope, but again they merely remain motionless as the scene fades to black.

==Characters==
Beckett refrained from elaborating on the characters beyond what he had written in the play. He once recalled that when Sir Ralph Richardson &quot;wanted the low-down on Pozzo, his home address and curriculum vitae, and seemed to make the forthcoming of this and similar information the condition of his condescending to illustrate the part of Vladimir ... I told him that all I knew about Pozzo was in the text, that if I had known more I would have put it in the text, and that was true also of the other characters.&quot;

===Vladimir and Estragon===

When Beckett started writing he did not have a visual image of Vladimir and Estragon. They are never referred to as tramps in the text, though they are often performed in tramps’ costumes on stage. Roger Blin advises: &quot;Beckett heard their voices, but he couldn&#x27;t describe his characters to me. [He said]: &#x27;The only thing I&#x27;m sure of is that they&#x27;re wearing bowlers. &quot;The bowler hat was of course &quot;de rigueur&quot; for men in many social contexts when Beckett was growing up in Foxrock, and [his father] commonly wore one.&quot; The play does indicate that the clothes worn at least by Estragon are shabby. When told by Vladimir that he should have been a poet, Estragon says he was, gestures to his rags, and asks if it were not obvious.

There are no physical descriptions of either of the two characters; however, the text indicates that Vladimir is the heavier of the pair: the contemplation-of-suicide scene tells us exactly that. The bowlers and other broadly comic aspects of their personae have reminded modern audiences of Laurel and Hardy, who occasionally played tramps in their films. &quot;The hat-passing game in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; and Lucky&#x27;s inability to think without his hat on are two obvious Beckett derivations from Laurel and Hardy – a substitution of form for essence, covering for reality&quot;, wrote Gerald Mast in &quot;The Comic Mind: Comedy and the Movies&quot;. Their &quot;blather&quot;, which includes Hiberno-English idioms, indicated that they are both Irish.

Vladimir stands through most of the play whereas Estragon sits down numerous times and even dozes off. &quot;Estragon is inert and Vladimir restless.&quot; Vladimir looks at the sky and muses on religious or philosophical matters. Estragon &quot;belongs to the stone&quot;, preoccupied with mundane things such as what he can get to eat and how to ease his physical aches and pains; he is direct, intuitive. The monotonous, ritualistic means by which Estragon continuously sits upon the stone may be likened to the constant nail filing carried out by Winnie in &quot;Happy Days&quot;, another of Beckett&#x27;s plays, both actions representing the slow, deliberate erosion of the characters&#x27; lives. He finds it hard to remember but can recall certain things when prompted, &quot;e.g.&quot;, when Vladimir asks: &quot;Do you remember the Gospels?&quot; Estragon tells Vladimir about the coloured maps of the Holy Land and that he planned to honeymoon by the Dead Sea; it is his short-term memory that is poorest and suggests that he may, in fact, be suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Al Alvarez writes: &quot;But perhaps Estragon&#x27;s forgetfulness is the cement binding their relationship together. He continually forgets, Vladimir continually reminds him; between them they pass the time.&quot; Estragon&#x27;s forgetfulness affords the author a certain narrative utility also, allowing for the mundane, empty conversations held between him and Vladimir to continue seamlessly. They have been together for fifty years but when asked by Pozzo they do not reveal their actual ages. Vladimir&#x27;s life is not without its discomforts too but he is the more resilient of the pair. &quot;Vladimir&#x27;s pain is primarily mental anguish, which would thus account for his voluntary exchange of his hat for Lucky&#x27;s, thus signifying Vladimir&#x27;s symbolic desire for another person&#x27;s thoughts.&quot; These characterizations, for some, represented the act of thinking or mental state (Vladimir) and physical things or the body (Estragon). This is visually depicted by Vladimir&#x27;s continuous attention to his hat and Estragon to his boots. While the two characters are temperamentally opposite, with their differing responses to a situation, they are both essential as demonstrated in the way Vladimir&#x27;s metaphysical musings were balanced by Estragon&#x27;s physical demands.

The above characterizations, particularly that which concerns their existential situation, are also demonstrated in one of the play&#x27;s recurring themes, which is sleep. There are two instances when Estragon falls asleep in the play and has nightmares, about which he wanted to tell Vladimir when he woke. The latter refuses to hear it since he could not tolerate the sense of entrapment experienced by the dreamer during each episode. This idea of entrapment supports the view that the setting of the play may be understood more clearly as a dream-like landscape, or, a form of Purgatory, from which neither man can escape. One interpretation noted the link between the two characters&#x27; experiences and the way they represent them: the impotence in Estragon&#x27;s nightmare and Vladimir&#x27;s predicament of waiting as his companion sleeps. It is also said that sleep and impatience allow the spectators to distinguish between the two main characters, that sleep expresses Estragon&#x27;s focus on his sensations while Vladimir&#x27;s restlessness shows his focus on his thoughts. This particular aspect involving sleep is indicative of what some called a pattern of duality in the play. In the case of the protagonists, the duality involves the body and the mind, making the characters complementary.

Throughout the play the couple refer to each other by the pet names &quot;Didi&quot; and &quot;Gogo&quot;, although the boy addresses Vladimir as &quot;Mister Albert&quot;. Beckett originally intended to call Estragon &quot;Lévy&quot; but when Pozzo questions him he gives his name as &quot;Magrégor, André&quot; and also responds to &quot;Catulle&quot; in French or &quot;Catullus&quot; in the first Faber edition. This became &quot;Adam&quot; in the American edition. Beckett&#x27;s only explanation was that he was &quot;fed up with Catullus&quot;.

Vivian Mercier described &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; as a play which &quot;has achieved a theoretical impossibility – a play in which nothing happens, that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. What&#x27;s more, since the second act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which nothing happens, twice.&quot; Mercier once questioned Beckett on the language used by the pair: &quot;It seemed to me...he made Didi and Gogo sound as if they had earned PhDs. &#x27;How do you know they hadn&#x27;t?&#x27; was his reply.&quot; They clearly have known better times, such as a visit to the Eiffel Tower and grape-harvesting by the Rhône; this is about all either has to say about their pasts, save for Estragon&#x27;s claim to have been a poet, an explanation Estragon provides to Vladimir for his destitution. In the first stage production, which Beckett oversaw, both are &quot;more shabby-genteel than ragged...Vladimir at least is capable of being scandalised...on a matter of etiquette when Estragon begs for chicken bones or money.&quot;

===Pozzo and Lucky===
Pozzo and Lucky have been together for 60 years. Pozzo controls Lucky by means of an extremely long rope, which he jerks and tugs if Lucky is the least bit slow.

It has been contended that &quot;Pozzo and Lucky are simply Didi and Gogo writ large&quot;, unbalanced as their relationship is. However, Pozzo&#x27;s dominance is superficial; &quot;upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that Lucky always possessed more influence in the relationship, for he danced, and more importantly, thought – not as a service, but in order to fill a vacant need of Pozzo: he committed all of these acts Pozzo. As such, since the first appearance of the duo, the true slave had always been Pozzo.&quot; Pozzo credits Lucky with having given him all the culture, refinement, and ability to reason that he possesses. His rhetoric has been learned by rote. Pozzo&#x27;s &quot;party piece&quot; on the sky is a clear example: as his memory crumbles, he finds himself unable to continue under his own steam.

Little is learned about Pozzo besides the fact that he is on his way to the fair to sell his slave, Lucky. From Beckett&#x27;s own life experiences in Ireland and wartime France, commentators such as Hugh Kenner have identified Pozzo as representing German behaviour in occupied France, or alternatively as a bullying and conceited Protestant Ascendancy landlord. When translating his original French dialogue into English, Beckett took pains to introduce Irish idiom (specifically, Dubliners&#x27; idiom): Pozzo&#x27;s pipe is made by Kapp and Peterson, Dublin&#x27;s best-known tobacconists (which he refers to as a &quot;briar&quot; but which Estragon calls by the dialect word &quot;dudeen&quot;). Not only is his Hiberno-English text more colourful than the French original, but it emphasizes the differences in the characters&#x27; social standing. Pozzo confesses to a poor memory but it is more a result of an abiding self-absorption. &quot;Pozzo is a character who has to overcompensate. That&#x27;s why he overdoes things ... and his overcompensation has to do with a deep insecurity in him. These were things Beckett said, psychological terms he used.&quot; Beckett&#x27;s advice to the American director Alan Schneider was: &quot;[Pozzo] is a hypomaniac and the only way to play him is to play him mad.&quot;

&quot;In his [English] translation ... Beckett struggled to retain the French atmosphere as much as possible, so that he delegated all the English names and places to Lucky, whose own name, he thought, suggested such a correlation&quot;.

Lucky appears to be the subservient member of their relationship, at least initially, carrying out every task that Pozzo bids him to do without question, portraying a form of &quot;dog-like devotion&quot; to his &quot;master.&quot; He struggles with a heavy suitcase, falling on a number of occasions, only to be helped and held up by Estragon and Vladimir.

Lucky speaks only once in the play and it is in response to Pozzo&#x27;s order to &quot;think&quot; for Estragon and Vladimir. The ostensibly abstract philosophical meanderings supplied to the audience by Lucky during his speech have been described as &quot;a flood of completely meaningless gibberish&quot; by Martin Esslin in his essay, &quot;The Theatre of the Absurd&quot;. Esslin suggests that this seemingly involuntary, philosophical spouting is an example of the actor&#x27;s working &quot;against the dialogue rather than with it&quot;, providing grounds for Esslin&#x27;s claims that the &quot;fervor of delivery&quot; in the play must &quot;stand in a dialectical contrast to the pointlessness of the meaning of the lines&quot;.

Jean Martin, who originated the role of Lucky in Paris in 1953, spoke to a doctor named Marthe Gautier, who was working at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. Martin asked if she knew of a physiological reason that would explain Lucky&#x27;s voice as it was written in the text. Gautier suggested Parkinson&#x27;s disease, which, she said, &quot;begins with a trembling, which gets more and more noticeable, until later the patient can no longer speak without the voice shaking&quot;. Martin began incorporating this idea into his rehearsals. Beckett and the director may not have been completely convinced, but they expressed no objections. When Martin mentioned to the playwright that he was &quot;playing Lucky as if he were suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s&quot;, Beckett responded by saying &quot;Yes, of course&quot;, and mentioning that his own mother had Parkinson&#x27;s.

When Beckett was asked why Lucky was so named, he replied, &quot;I suppose he is lucky to have no more expectations...&quot;

===The Boy===

The cast list specifies only one boy.

The boy in Act I, a local lad, assures Vladimir that this is the first time he has seen him. He says he was not there the previous day. He confirms he works for Mr. Godot as a goatherd. His brother, whom Godot beats, is a shepherd. Godot feeds both of them and allows them to sleep in his hayloft.

The boy in Act II also assures Vladimir that it was not he who called upon them the day before. He insists that this too is his first visit. When Vladimir asks what Godot does the boy tells him, &quot;He does nothing, sir.&quot; We also learn he has a white beard – possibly, the boy is not certain. This boy also has a brother who it seems is sick but there is no clear evidence to suggest that his brother is the boy who came in Act I or the one who came the day before that.

Whether the boy from Act I is the same boy from Act II or not, both boys are polite yet timid. In the first act, the boy, despite arriving while Pozzo and Lucky are still about, does not announce himself until after Pozzo and Lucky leave, saying to Vladimir and Estragon that he waited for the other two to leave out of fear of the two men and of Pozzo&#x27;s whip; the boy does not arrive early enough in Act II to see either Lucky or Pozzo. In both acts, the boy seems hesitant to speak very much, saying mostly &quot;Yes Sir&quot; or &quot;No Sir&quot;, and winds up exiting by running away.

===Godot===
The identity of Godot has been the subject of much debate. &quot;When Colin Duckworth asked Beckett point-blank whether Pozzo was Godot, the author replied: &#x27;No. It is just implied in the text, but it&#x27;s not true.

Deirdre Bair says that though &quot;Beckett will never discuss the implications of the title&quot;, she suggests two stories that both may have at least partially inspired it. The first is that because feet are a recurring theme in the play, Beckett has said the title was suggested to him by the slang French term for boot: &quot;&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;&quot;. The second story, according to Bair, is that Beckett once encountered a group of spectators at the French &quot;Tour de France&quot; bicycle race, who told him &quot;Nous attendons Godot&quot; – they were waiting for a competitor whose name was Godot.

&quot;Beckett said to Peter Woodthorpe that he regretted calling the absent character &#x27;Godot&#x27;, because of all the theories involving God to which this had given rise.&quot; &quot;I also told [Ralph] Richardson that if by Godot I had meant God I would [have] said God, and not Godot. This seemed to disappoint him greatly.&quot; That said, Beckett did once concede, &quot;It would be fatuous of me to pretend that I am not aware of the meanings attached to the word &#x27;Godot&#x27;, and the opinion of many that it means &#x27;God&#x27;. But you must remember – I wrote the play in French, and if I did have that meaning in my mind, it was somewhere in my unconscious and I was not overtly aware of it.&quot; (Note: the French word for &#x27;God&#x27; is &#x27;Dieu&#x27;.) However, &quot;Beckett has often stressed the strong unconscious impulses that partly control his writing; he has even spoken of being &#x27;in a trance&#x27; when he writes.&quot; While Beckett stated he originally had no knowledge of Balzac&#x27;s play &quot;Mercadet ou le faiseur&quot;, whose character Godeau has an identical-sounding name and is involved in a similar situation, it has been suggested he may have been instead influenced by &quot;The Lovable Cheat&quot;, a minor adaptation of &quot;Mercadet&quot; starring Buster Keaton, whose works Beckett had admired, and whom he later sought out for &quot;Film&quot;.

Unlike elsewhere in Beckett&#x27;s work, no bicycle appears in this play, but Hugh Kenner in his essay &quot;The Cartesian Centaur&quot; reports that Beckett once, when asked about the meaning of Godot, mentioned &quot;a veteran racing cyclist, bald, a &#x27;stayer&#x27;, recurrent placeman in town-to-town and national championships, Christian name elusive, surname Godeau, pronounced, of course, no differently from Godot.&quot; &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; is clearly not about track cycling, but it is said that Beckett himself did wait for French cyclist (1920–2000; a professional cyclist from 1943 to 1961), outside the velodrome in Roubaix.

Of the two boys who work for Godot only one appears safe from beatings, &quot;Beckett said, only half-jokingly, that one of Estragon&#x27;s feet was saved&quot;.

The name &quot;Godot&quot; is pronounced in Britain and Ireland with the emphasis on the first syllable, ; in North America it is usually pronounced with an emphasis on the second syllable, . Beckett himself said the emphasis should be on the first syllable, and that the North American pronunciation is a mistake. Georges Borchardt, Beckett&#x27;s literary agent, and who represents Beckett&#x27;s literary estate, has always pronounced &quot;Godot&quot; in the French manner, with equal emphasis on both syllables. Borchardt checked with Beckett&#x27;s nephew, Edward, who told him his uncle pronounced it that way as well. The 1956 Broadway production split the difference by having Vladimir pronounce &quot;Godot&quot; with equal stress on both syllables (goh-doh) and Estragon pronounce it with the accent on the second syllable (g&#x27;doh).

==Setting==
There is only one scene throughout both acts. Two men are waiting on a country road by a tree. The men are of unspecified origin, though it is clear that they are not English by nationality since they refer to currency as francs, and tell derisive jokes about the English – and in English-language productions the pair are traditionally played with Irish accents. The script calls for Estragon to sit on a low mound but in practice – as in Beckett&#x27;s own 1975 German production – this is usually a stone.  In the first act the tree is bare. In the second, a few leaves have appeared despite the script specifying that it is the next day. The minimal description calls to mind &quot;the idea of the &quot;lieu vague&quot;, a location which should not be particularised&quot;.

Other clues about the location can be found in the dialogue. In Act I, Vladimir turns toward the auditorium and describes it as a bog. In Act II, Vladimir again motions to the auditorium and notes that there is &quot;Not a soul in sight.&quot; When Estragon rushes toward the back of the stage in Act II, Vladimir scolds him, saying that &quot;There&#x27;s no way out there.&quot; Also in Act II, Vladimir comments that their surroundings look nothing like the Macon country, and Estragon states that he&#x27;s lived his whole life &quot;Here! In the Cackon country!&quot;

Alan Schneider once suggested putting the play on in the round – Pozzo has been described as a ringmaster – but Beckett dissuaded him: &quot;I don&#x27;t in my ignorance agree with the round and feel &quot;Godot&quot; needs a very closed box.&quot; He even contemplated at one point having a &quot;faint shadow of bars on stage floor&quot; but, in the end, decided against this level of what he called &quot;explicitation&quot;. In Beckett&#x27;s 1975 Schiller Theater production in Berlin, there are times when Didi and Gogo appear to bounce off something &quot;like birds trapped in the strands of [an invisible] net&quot;, in James Knowlson&#x27;s description.

==Interpretations==
&quot;Because the play is so stripped down, so elemental, it invites all kinds of social and political and religious interpretation&quot;, wrote Normand Berlin in a tribute to the play in autumn 1999, &quot;with Beckett himself placed in different schools of thought, different movements and &#x27;isms&#x27;. The attempts to pin him down have not been successful, but the desire to do so is natural when we encounter a writer whose minimalist art reaches for bedrock reality. &#x27;Less&#x27; forces us to look for &#x27;more&#x27;, and the need to talk about &quot;Godot&quot; and about Beckett has resulted in a steady outpouring of books and articles.&quot;

Throughout &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, the audience may encounter religious, philosophical, classical, psychoanalytical and biographical – especially wartime – references. There are ritualistic aspects and elements taken directly from vaudeville, and there is a danger in making more of these than what they are: that is, merely structural conveniences, avatars into which the writer places his fictional characters. The play &quot;exploits several archetypal forms and situations, all of which lend themselves to both comedy and pathos.&quot; Beckett makes this point emphatically clear in the opening notes to &quot;Film&quot;: &quot;No truth value attaches to the above, regarded as of merely structural and dramatic convenience.&quot; He made another important remark to Lawrence Harvey, saying that his &quot;work does not depend on experience – [it is] not a record of experience. Of course you use it.&quot;

Beckett tired quickly of &quot;the endless misunderstanding.&quot; As far back as 1955, he remarked, &quot;Why people have to complicate a thing so simple I can&#x27;t make out.&quot; He was not forthcoming with anything more than cryptic clues, however: &quot;Peter Woodthorpe [who played Estragon] remembered asking him one day in a taxi what the play was really about: &#x27;It&#x27;s all , Peter; it&#x27;s symbiosis,&#x27; answered Beckett.&quot;

Beckett directed the play for the Schiller-Theater in Berlin in 1975. Although he had overseen many productions, this was the first time that he had taken complete control. Walter Asmus was his conscientious young assistant director. The production was not naturalistic. Beckett explained,

It is a game, everything is a game. When all four of them are lying on the ground, that cannot be handled naturalistically. That has got to be done artificially, balletically. Otherwise everything becomes an imitation, an imitation of reality [...]. It should become clear and transparent, not dry. It is a game in order to survive.

Over the years, Beckett clearly realised that the greater part of &quot;Godot&quot;&#x27;s success came down to the fact that it was open to a variety of readings and that this was not necessarily a bad thing. Beckett himself sanctioned &quot;one of the most famous mixed-race productions of &quot;Godot&quot;, performed at the Baxter Theatre in the University of Cape Town, directed by Donald Howarth, with [...] two black actors, John Kani and Winston Ntshona, playing Didi and Gogo; Pozzo, dressed in checked shirt and gumboots reminiscent of an Afrikaner landlord, and Lucky (&#x27;a shanty town piece of white trash&#x27;) were played by two white actors, Bill Flynn and Peter Piccolo [...]. The Baxter production has often been portrayed as if it were an explicitly political production, when in fact it received very little emphasis. What such a reaction showed, however, was that, although the play can in no way be taken as a political allegory, there are elements that are relevant to any local situation in which one man is being exploited or oppressed by another.&quot;

=== Political ===
&quot;It was seen as an allegory of the Cold War&quot; or of French Resistance to the Germans. Graham Hassell writes, &quot;[T]he intrusion of Pozzo and Lucky [...] seems like nothing more than a metaphor for Ireland&#x27;s view of mainland Britain, where society has ever been blighted by a greedy ruling élite keeping the working classes passive and ignorant by whatever means.&quot;

The play was written shortly after World War II, during which Beckett and his partner were forced to flee occupied Paris to avoid arrest, owing to their affiliation with the French Resistance. After the war, Beckett volunteered for the Red Cross in the French city Saint-Lô, which had been almost completely destroyed during the D-Day fighting. These experiences would have likely had a severe impact on both Beckett&#x27;s personal politics, as well as his views on the prevailing policies that informed the period in which he found himself. Some academics have theorized that &quot;Godot&quot; is set during World War II, with Estragon and Vladimir being two Jews waiting for Godot to smuggle them out of occupied France.

Vladimir and Estragon are often played with Irish accents, as in the Beckett on Film project. This, some feel, is an inevitable consequence of Beckett&#x27;s rhythms and phraseology, but it is not stipulated in the text. At any rate, they are not of English stock: at one point early in the play, Estragon mocks the English pronunciation of &quot;calm&quot; and has fun with &quot;the story of the Englishman in the brothel&quot;.

=== Psychological ===
==== Freudian ====
&quot;Bernard Dukore develops a triadic theory in &quot;Didi, Gogo and the absent Godot&quot;, based on Sigmund Freud&#x27;s trinitarian description of the psyche in &quot;The Ego and the Id&quot; (1923) and the usage of onomastic techniques. Dukore defines the characters by what they lack: the rational Go-go embodies the incomplete ego, the missing pleasure principle: (e)go-(e)go. Di-di (id-id) – who is more instinctual and irrational – is seen as the backward id or subversion of the rational principle. Godot fulfills the function of the superego or moral standards. Pozzo and Lucky are just re-iterations of the main protagonists. Dukore finally sees Beckett&#x27;s play as a metaphor for the futility of man&#x27;s existence when salvation is expected from an external entity, and the self is denied introspection.&quot;

==== Jungian ====
&quot;The four archetypal personalities or the four aspects of the soul are grouped in two pairs: the ego and the shadow, the persona and the soul&#x27;s image (animus or anima). The shadow is the container of all our despised emotions repressed by the ego. Lucky, the shadow, serves as the polar opposite of the egocentric Pozzo, prototype of prosperous mediocrity, who incessantly controls and persecutes his subordinate, thus symbolising the oppression of the unconscious shadow by the despotic ego. Lucky&#x27;s monologue in Act I appears as a manifestation of a stream of repressed unconsciousness, as he is allowed to &quot;think&quot; for his master. Estragon&#x27;s name has another connotation, besides that of the aromatic herb, tarragon: &quot;estragon&quot; sounds similar to estrogen, the female hormone (Carter, 130). This prompts us to identify him with the anima, the feminine image of Vladimir&#x27;s soul. It explains Estragon&#x27;s propensity for poetry, his sensitivity and dreams, his irrational moods. Vladimir appears as the complementary masculine principle, or perhaps the rational persona of the contemplative type.&quot;

=== Philosophical ===

==== Existential ====
Broadly speaking, existentialists hold that there are certain fundamental questions that all human beings must come to terms with if they are to take their subjective existences seriously and with intrinsic value. Questions such as life, death, the meaning of human existence and the place of God in that existence are among them. By and large, the theories of existentialism assert that conscious reality is very complex and without an &quot;objective&quot; or universally known value: the individual must create value by affirming it and living it, not by simply talking about it or philosophising it in the mind. The play may be seen to touch on all of these issues.

Martin Esslin, in his &quot;The Theatre of the Absurd&quot; (1960), argued that &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; was part of a broader literary movement that he called the Theatre of the Absurd, a form of theatre that stemmed from the absurdist philosophy of Albert Camus. Absurdism itself is a branch of the traditional assertions of existentialism, pioneered by Søren Kierkegaard, and posits that, while inherent meaning might very well exist in the universe, human beings are incapable of finding it due to some form of mental or philosophical limitation. Thus, humanity is doomed to be faced with &quot;the Absurd&quot;, or the absolute absurdity of the existence in lack of intrinsic purpose.

==== Ethical ====
Just after Didi and Gogo have been particularly selfish and callous, the boy comes to say that Godot is not coming. The boy (or pair of boys) may be seen to represent meekness and hope before compassion is consciously excluded by an evolving personality and character, and in which case may be the youthful Pozzo and Lucky. Thus Godot is compassion and fails to arrive every day, as he says he will. No-one is concerned that a boy is beaten. In this interpretation, there is the irony that only by changing their hearts to be compassionate can the characters fixed to the tree move on and cease to have to wait for Godot.

=== Christian ===
Much of the play is steeped in scriptural allusion. The boy from Act I mentions that he and his brother mind Godot&#x27;s sheep and goats. Much can be read into Beckett&#x27;s inclusion of the story of the two thieves from Luke 23:39–43 and the ensuing discussion of repentance. It is easy to see the solitary tree as representative of the Christian cross or the tree of life. Some see God and Godot as one and the same. Vladimir&#x27;s &quot;Christ have mercy upon us!&quot; could be taken as evidence that that is at least what he believes.

Another, perhaps less conspicuous, &quot;potentially&quot; religious, element in the play, is Pozzo&#x27;s bout with blindness, during which he comes to resemble the biblical figure of Bartimaeus or &#x27;The Blind Beggar&#x27;.

This reading is given further weight early in the first act when Estragon asks Vladimir what it is that he has requested from Godot:

Other explicit Christian elements that are mentioned in the play include, but are not limited to, repentance, the Gospels, a Saviour, human beings made in God&#x27;s image, the cross, and Cain and Abel.

According to biographer Anthony Cronin, &quot;[Beckett] always possessed a Bible, at the end more than one edition, and Bible concordances were always among the reference books on his shelves.&quot; Beckett himself was quite open on the issue: &quot;Christianity is a mythology with which I am perfectly familiar so I naturally use it.&quot; As Cronin argues, these biblical references &quot;may be ironic or even sarcastic&quot;.

&quot;In answer to a defence counsel question in 1937 (during the libel action brought by his uncle against Oliver St. John Gogarty) as to whether he was a Christian, Jew or atheist, Beckett replied, &#x27;None of the three. Looking at Beckett&#x27;s entire œuvre, Mary Bryden observed that &quot;the hypothesised God who emerges from Beckett&#x27;s texts is one who is both cursed for his perverse absence and cursed for his surveillant presence. He is by turns dismissed, satirised, or ignored, but he, and his tortured son, are never definitively discarded.&quot;

=== Autobiographical ===
&quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; has been described as a &quot;metaphor for the long walk into Roussillon, when Beckett and Suzanne slept in haystacks ... during the day and walked by night ... [or] of the relationship of Beckett to Joyce&quot;. Beckett told Ruby Cohn that Caspar David Friedrich&#x27;s painting &quot;Two Men Contemplating the Moon&quot;, which he saw on his journey to Germany in 1936, was a source for the play.

=== Sexual ===
Though the sexuality of Vladimir and Estragon is not always considered by critics, some see the two vagabonds as an ageing homosexual couple, who are worn out, with broken spirits, impotent and not engaging sexually any longer. The two appear to be written as a parody of a married couple. Peter Boxall points out that the play features two characters who seem to have shared life together for years; they quarrel, embrace, and are mutually dependent. Beckett was interviewed at the time the play was premiering in New York, and, speaking of his writings and characters in general, Beckett said &quot;I&#x27;m working with impotence, ignorance. I don&#x27;t think impotence has been exploited in the past.&quot;

Pozzo and his slave, Lucky, arrive on the scene. Pozzo is a stout man, who wields a whip and holds a rope around Lucky&#x27;s neck. Some critics have considered that the relationship of these two characters is homosexual and sado-masochistic in nature. Lucky&#x27;s long speech is a torrent of broken ideas and speculations regarding man, sex, God, and time. It has been said that the play contains little or no sexual hope; which is the play&#x27;s lament, and the source of the play&#x27;s humour and comedic tenderness. Norman Mailer wonders if Beckett might be restating the sexual and moral basis of Christianity, that life and strength is found in an adoration of those in the lower depths where God is concealed.

=== Beckett&#x27;s objection to the casting of female actors ===
Beckett was not open to most interpretative approaches to his work. He famously objected when, in the 1980s, several women&#x27;s acting companies began to stage the play. &quot;Women don&#x27;t have prostates&quot;, said Beckett, a reference to the fact that Vladimir frequently has to leave the stage to urinate.

In 1988 a Dutch theatre company, De Haarlemse Toneelschuur, put on a production directed by Matin Van Veldhuizen with all female actors, using a French-to-Dutch translation by Jacoba Van Velde. Beckett brought an unsuccessful lawsuit against the theatre company. &quot;The issue of gender seemed to him to be so vital a distinction for a playwright to make that he reacted angrily, instituting a ban on all productions of his plays in The Netherlands.&quot; This ban was short-lived, however. 

In 1991 (two years after Beckett&#x27;s death), a French judge ruled that productions with female casts would not cause excessive damage to Beckett&#x27;s legacy, and allowed the play to be performed by the all-female cast of the Brut de Beton theater company at the Avignon Festival, although an objection by Beckett&#x27;s representative had to be read before each performance.

Similarly, an injunction was issued against a theatre in Pontedera, Tuscany, by lawyers for Samuel Beckett&#x27;s estate who did not want female actors to play Vladimir and Estragon in the play, but in 2006 a court in Rome ruled that the women could play the roles. 

At the 1995 Acco Festival, director Nola Chilton staged a production with Daniella Michaeli in the role of Lucky. In 2021, São João National Theatre in Porto, Portugal, staged a version with Maria Leite as Lucky. 

==Production history==
===1950s to 1969===
====France and Germany====
&quot;[O]n 17 February 1952 ... an abridged version of the play was performed in the studio of the Club d&#x27;Essai de la Radio and was broadcast on [French] radio ... [A]lthough he sent a polite note that Roger Blin read out, Beckett himself did not turn up.&quot; Part of his introduction reads:
The play was first published in September 1952 by Les Éditions de Minuit and released on 17 October 1952 in advance of the first full theatrical performance; only 2500 copies were printed of this first edition. On 4 January 1953, &quot;[t]hirty reviewers came to the &quot;générale&quot; of &quot;En attendant Godot&quot; before the public opening ... Contrary to later legend, the reviewers were kind ... Some dozen reviews in daily newspapers range[d] from tolerant to enthusiastic ... Reviews in the weeklies [were] longer and more fervent; moreover, they appeared in time to lure spectators to that first thirty-day run&quot; which began on 5 January 1953 at the Théâtre de Babylone, Paris. Early public performances were not, however, without incident: during one performance &quot;the curtain had to be brought down after Lucky&#x27;s monologue as twenty, well-dressed, but disgruntled spectators whistled and hooted derisively ... One of the protesters [even] wrote a vituperative letter dated 2 February 1953 to &quot;Le Monde&quot;.&quot;

The cast comprised (Estragon), Lucien Raimbourg (Vladimir), Jean Martin (Lucky) and Roger Blin (Pozzo). The actor due to play Pozzo found a more remunerative role and so the director – a shy, lean man in real life – had to step in and play the stout bombaster himself with a pillow amplifying his stomach. Both boys were played by Serge Lecointe. The entire production was done on the thinnest of shoestring budgets; the large battered valise that Martin carried &quot;was found among the city&#x27;s refuse by the husband of the theatre dresser on his rounds as he worked clearing the dustbins&quot;, for example. Blin helped the actors embody their characters by asking them to determine a physical malady that would contribute to the nature of their character. Latour emphasized Estragon&#x27;s bad feet and Raimbourg Vladimir&#x27;s prostate problems, while Blin played Pozzo as a man with heart difficulties. Martin played Lucky with the symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

A particularly significant production – from Beckett&#x27;s perspective – took place in Lüttringhausen Prison near Remscheid in Germany. An inmate obtained a copy of the French first edition, translated it himself into German and obtained permission to stage the play. The first night had been on 29 November 1953. He wrote to Beckett in October 1954: &quot;You will be surprised to be receiving a letter about your play &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, from a prison where so many thieves, forgers, toughs, homos, crazy men and killers spend this bitch of a life waiting ... and waiting ... and waiting. Waiting for what? Godot? Perhaps.&quot; Beckett was intensely moved and intended to visit the prison to see a last performance of the play but it never happened. This marked &quot;the beginning of Beckett&#x27;s enduring links with prisons and prisoners ... He took a tremendous interest in productions of his plays performed in prisons.&quot;

====UK====
Like all of Beckett&#x27;s translations, the English translation of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; is not simply a literal translation of &quot;&quot;. &quot;Small but significant differences separate the French and English text. Some, like Vladimir&#x27;s inability to remember the farmer&#x27;s name (Bonnelly), show how the translation became more indefinite, attrition and loss of memory more pronounced.&quot; A number of biographical details were removed, all adding to a general &quot;vaguening&quot; of the text which he continued to trim for the rest of his life.

The English-language saw its first UK production on 3 August 1955 at the Arts Theatre in London, directed by Peter Hall. During an early rehearsal Hall told the cast &quot;I haven&#x27;t really the foggiest idea what some of it means ... But if we stop and discuss every line we&#x27;ll never open.&quot; Again, the printed version preceded it (New York: Grove Press, 1954) but Faber&#x27;s &quot;mutilated&quot; edition did not materialise until 1956. A &quot;corrected&quot; edition was subsequently produced in 1965. &quot;The most accurate text is in &quot;Theatrical Notebooks&quot; I, (Ed.) Dougald McMillan and James Knowlson (Faber and Grove, 1993). It is based on Beckett&#x27;s revisions for his Schiller-Theater production (1975) and the London San Quentin Drama Workshop, based on the Schiller production but revised further at the Riverside Studios (March 1984).&quot;

In the 1950s, theatre was strictly censored in the UK, to Beckett&#x27;s amazement since he thought it a bastion of free speech. The Lord Chamberlain insisted that the word &quot;erection&quot; be removed, &quot; &#x27;Fartov&#x27; became &#x27;Popov&#x27; and Mrs Gozzo had &#x27;warts&#x27; instead of &#x27;clap. Indeed, there were attempts to ban the play completely. Lady Dorothy Howitt wrote to the Lord Chamberlain, saying: &quot;One of the many themes running through the play is the desire of two old tramps continually to relieve themselves. Such a dramatisation of lavatory necessities is offensive and against all sense of British decency.&quot; &quot;The first unexpurgated version of &quot;Godot&quot; in England ... opened at the Royal Court on 30 December 1964.&quot;

The London run was not without incident. The actor Peter Bull, who played Pozzo, recalls the reaction of that first night audience:

Waves of hostility came whirling over the footlights, and the mass exodus, which was to form such a feature of the run of the piece, started quite soon after the curtain had risen. The audible groans were also fairly disconcerting ... The curtain fell to mild applause, we took a scant three calls (Peter Woodthorpe reports only one curtain call) and a depression and a sense of anti-climax descended on us all.

The critics were less than kind but &quot;[e]verything changed on Sunday 7 August 1955 with Kenneth Tynan&#x27;s and Harold Hobson&#x27;s reviews in &quot;The Observer&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. Beckett was always grateful to the two reviewers for their support ... which more or less transformed the play overnight into the rage of London.&quot; &quot;At the end of the year, the Evening Standard Drama Awards were held for the first time ... Feelings ran high and the opposition, led by Sir Malcolm Sargent, threatened to resign if &quot;Godot&quot; won [The Best New Play category]. An English compromise was worked out by changing the title of the award. &quot;Godot&quot; became The Most Controversial Play of the Year. It is a prize that has never been given since.&quot;

On 27 April 1960, the BBC Third Programme broadcast the very first radio adaptation, directed by Donald McWhinnie, with Patrick Magee as Vladimir, Wilfrid Brambell as Estragon, Felix Felton as Pozzo, Donal Donnelly as Lucky and Jeremy Ward as The Boy.

On 26 June 1961, Donald McWhinnie directed a production broadcast on BBC Television, with Jack MacGowran as Vladimir, Peter Woodthorpe as Estragon, Felix Felton as Pozzo, Timothy Bateson as Lucky and Mark Mileham as The Boy.

On 5 February 1962, the BBC Home Service broadcast a radio production as part of the &quot;From the Fifties&quot; series, directed by Robin Midgley with Nigel Stock as Vladimir, Kenneth Griffith as Estragon, Philip Leaver as Pozzo, Andrew Sachs as Lucky and Terry Raven as The Boy.

In December 1964, Nicol Williamson played Vladimir, Alfred Lynch played Estragon and Jack MacGowran played Lucky in a production at London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre directed by Anthony Page. This was the first West End revival since the play&#x27;s British première.

====US====
Planning for an American tour for &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; started in 1955. The first American tour was directed by Alan Schneider and produced by Michael Myerberg. Bert Lahr and Tom Ewell acted in the initial production.

The first part of the tour was a disaster. The play was originally set to be shown in Washington and Philadelphia. However, low advance sales forced the play to be performed in Miami for two weeks in early January 1956 at the newly opened Coconut Grove Playhouse, where the audience was made up of vacationers. It had been promoted as &quot;the laugh sensation of two continents&quot; in the notices run by Myerberg in the local newspapers.

Most audience members were baffled by the play. Theatregoers would leave after the first act, describing it as a play where &quot;nothing happens&quot;, and taxi drivers would wait in front of the theatre to take them home. The Miami showing caused the cancellation of the showings in New York.

By April 1956, new showings were planned. That month, Schneider and most of the cast were replaced. Herbert Berghof took over as director and E. G. Marshall replaced Tom Ewell as Vladimir. The play had its Broadway premiere at the John Golden Theatre on 19 April 1956, with Bert Lahr as Estragon, E. G. Marshall as Vladimir, Alvin Epstein as Lucky, and Kurt Kasznar as Pozzo. The New York showing of the play prompted discussions of the play being an allegory. One reviewer, Henry Hewes of the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, identified Godot as God, Pozzo as a capitalist-aristocrat, and Lucky as labour-proletarian. This prompted Beckett to issue a rare statement, stating that the reaction was based on a misconception of the play. To Beckett, the play tries not to be able to be defined. The New York showing of the play was well-received with critics. Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Lahr for his performance as Estragon. The production was recorded as a two-record album by Columbia Masterworks Records.

In 1957, four years after its world premiere, &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; was staged for one night only at the San Quentin State Prison in California. Herbert Blau with the San Francisco Actor&#x27;s Workshop directed the production. Some 1,400 inmates encountered the performance. Beckett later gave Rick Cluchey, a former prisoner from San Quentin, financial and moral support over a period of many years. Cluchey played Vladimir in two productions in the former Gallows room of the San Quentin California State Prison, which had been converted into a 65-seat theatre and, like the German prisoner before him, went on to work on a variety of Beckett&#x27;s plays after his release. Cluchey said, &quot;The thing that everyone in San Quentin understood about Beckett, while the rest of the world had trouble catching up, was what it meant to be in the face of it.&quot; The attitude of this troupe was to move it away from a commercial attitude to an &quot;avant garde&quot; attitude. As well, the play did not have competition between the actors playing Vladimir and Estragon for being the star of the show. The most successful showing was in November 1957 at the San Quentin prison, where the play had a profound impact on the inmates and spurred them to start a drama group in the prison. They would go on to produce seven of Beckett&#x27;s works. In 1958, the play, produced by the San Francisco Actor&#x27;s Workshop, would be chosen to go to Brussels for the 1958 World&#x27;s Fair.

The first Broadway revival was produced in 1957 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre directed by Herbert Berghof, but only ran for six performances (January 21–26). It had an all-Black cast, including Earle Hyman as Vladimir, Mantan Moreland as Estragon, Rex Ingram as Pozzo and Geoffrey Holder as Lucky. This rendition of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; played on themes of the Africana absurd as opposed to the European absurd. For example, Hyman&#x27;s career as a classical actor and Moreland&#x27;s as a vaudeville actor were used to juxtapose the different facets of African American theatre in the mind of the audience.

Also in May 1957, a production directed by Walter Biakel was staged at the Studebaker Theatre in Chicago with Harvey Korman as Vladimir, Louis Zorich as Estragon, Moultrie Patten as Pozzo and Mike Nichols as Lucky.

In 1965, a production at the Olney Theatre in Olney, Maryland starred Dana Elcar as &quot;Vladimir&quot; and Stefan Gierasch as &quot;Estragon&quot; as part of &quot;A Festival of the Absurd&quot;.

====Australia====
In the Australian premiere at the Arrow Theatre in Melbourne in 1957, Barry Humphries played Estragon opposite Peter O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s Vladimir.

====Canada====
&quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; was first performed at the Stratford Festival in 1968 at the Avon Theatre in a production directed by William Hutt, with Powys Thomas as Vladimir, Eric Donkin as Estragon, James Blendick as Pozzo, Adrian Pecknold as Lucky and Douglas Birkenshaw as The Boy.

====South Africa====
The very first South African production was performed in 1955 at the Little Theatre in Cape Town, produced by Leonard Schach, with Gavin Haughton as Vladimir, Alec Bell as Estragon, Donald Inskip as Lucky, Gordon Roberts as Pazzo and Frank Rothgiesser as The Boy. The play was also presented at the Hofmeyr Theatre and then taken on a tour of several country towns in South Africa.

====Brazil====
After a few amateur productions in the 1950s, the first professional staging of the play in Brazil happened in 1969, directed by Flávio Rangel and staged by actress Cacilda Becker as Estragon and her real-life husband, actor Walmor Chagas as Vladimir. After few performances, on May 6, 1969, Becker had a stroke and collapsed during the intermission. She was immediately taken to a hospital, still wearing the play&#x27;s costume, and remained in a coma for 38 days until her passing on June 14.

==== Poland ====
The Polish premiere took place on 25 January 1957, at Teatr Współczesny in Warsaw. directed by Jerzy Kreczmar and featuring Tadeusz Fijewski as Vladimir and Józef Kondrat as Estragon. The Polish premiere was the fifth in the world and the first in the Communist Bloc.

===1970s to 2000===
In 1977, PBS broadcast an adaptation for television directed by Charles S. Dubin and performed by the Los Angeles Actors&#x27; Theatre, with Dana Elcar as Vladimir, Donald Moffat as Estragon, Ralph Waite as Pozzo and Bruce French as Lucky.

On 4 September 1977, as part of the British television series &quot;Drama&quot;, the Open University filmed a production of &quot;Godot&quot; directed by Richard Callanan with Leo McKern as Estragon, Max Wall as Vladimir, Graham Crowden as Pozzo, Basil Clarke as Lucky and Toby Page as The Boy.

In 1978, a production was staged by Walter Asmus at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City with Sam Waterston as Vladimir, Austin Pendleton as Estragon, Milo O&#x27;Shea as Lucky and Michael Egan as Pozzo.

A young Geoffrey Rush played Vladimir opposite his then flatmate Mel Gibson as Estragon in 1979 at the Jane Street Theatre in Sydney.

In 1980, Braham Murray directed a production at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester with Max Wall as Vladimir, Trevor Peacock as Estragon and Wolfe Morris as Pozzo.

Also in 1980, a production was performed at the Baxter Theatre in Cape Town, directed by Donald Howarth, with John Kani (&quot;Vladimir&quot;), Winston Ntshona (&quot;Estragon&quot;), Pieter-Dirk Uys (&quot;Pozzo&quot;), Peter Piccolo (&quot;Lucky&quot;) and Silamour Philander (&quot;The Boy&quot;). The multiracial cast, approved by Beckett himself, caused quite a stir, but the play received good reviews. After the Cape Town run, the play was also performed at the Grahamstown National Arts Festival, the Port Elizabeth Opera House, and the Market Theatre, Johannesburg (where it ran for three weeks). In 1981, the production went on an international tour to the US and Britain, with Bill Flynn replacing Uys as &quot;Pozzo&quot;. The tour included New Haven, Connecticut, The Old Vic Theatre in London and the Oxford Playhouse in Oxford. It was also invited to participate in the First International Baltimore Theatre Festival but on arrival the play was picketed by anti-Apartheid demonstrators who claimed that it and the Baxter Theatre were &quot;part and parcel of the South African propaganda machine to misrepresent what was taking place in the country&quot;, so the performances were canceled.

The 1984 Stratford Festival production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, directed by Leon Rubin, was performed at the Tom Patterson Theatre, with Brian Bedford as Vladimir, Edward Abenza as Estragon, Andreas Katsulas as Pozzo, Paul Zimet as Lucky and Adam Poynter as The Boy.

The Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center was the site of a 1988 revival directed by Mike Nichols, featuring Robin Williams (Estragon), Steve Martin (Vladimir), Bill Irwin (Lucky), F. Murray Abraham (Pozzo), and Lukas Haas (boy). With a limited run of seven weeks and an all-star cast, it was financially successful, but the critical reception was not particularly favourable, with Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing, &quot;Audiences will still be waiting for a transcendent &quot;Godot&quot; long after the clowns at Lincoln Center, like so many others passing through Beckett&#x27;s eternal universe before them, have come and gone.&quot;

The play was revived in London&#x27;s West End at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in a production directed by Les Blair, which opened on 30 September 1991. Rik Mayall played Vladimir and Adrian Edmondson played Estragon, with Philip Jackson as Pozzo and Christopher Ryan as Lucky; the boy was played by Dean Gaffney and Duncan Thornley. Derek Jarman provided the scenic design, in collaboration with Madeleine Morris.

In 1992, in what would be his last stage appearance, Dana Elcar reprised his 1965 stage role and 1977 TV movie role of Vladimir in a 1992 Los Angeles production at the Santa Paula Theatre Center directed by Deborah LaVine.

On 3 September 1994, a rare French-language recording of the play, recorded at the Theatre de Babylone shortly after the 1953 Paris premiere with the original cast and director &quot;(see above)&quot; was broadcast on BBC Radio 3. The following day, 4 September 1994, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a production in English with Alan Howard as Vladimir, Michael Maloney as Estragon, Stratford Jones as Pozzo, Simon Russell Beale as Lucky, Tristan Moriarty as The Boy and Geraldine McEwan as The Narrator; this production was rebroadcast on BBC Radio 3 30 June 1995 and 5 September 1999.

In 1996, the Stratford Festival staged a production directed by Brian Bedford, with Stephen Ouimette as Estragon, Tom McCamus as Vladimir, James Blendick as Pozzo, Tim MacDonald as Lucky and Joe Dinicol as The Boy. The cast reunited in March 1997 to perform the play on CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Bank of Montreal Stratford Festival Series&quot; and again at the Stratford Festival for the 1998 season at the Tom Patterson Theatre (with Philip Psutka replacing Dinicol as The Boy), again directed by Bedford.

In June 1999, the Royal Exchange, Manchester staged a production directed by Matthew Lloyd with Richard Wilson as Vladimir, Brian Pettifer as Estragon and Nicky Henson as Pozzo.

===2000 to present===
Neil Armfield directed a controversial production in January 2003 with Max Cullen as Estragon, John Gaden as Vladimir, Boddan Koca as Pozzo and Steve Le Marquand as Lucky at Sydney&#x27;s Belvoir St Theatre. A representative of Beckett&#x27;s estate was present at opening night and had believed a contract for the play had stated that no music was to be used in the production.

On 16 April 2006, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a production directed by John Tydeman, with Sean Barrett as Vladimir, David Burke as Estragon, Nigel Anthony as Lucky and The Narrator, Terence Rigby as Pozzo and Zachary Fox as The Boy.

On 2 and 3 November 2007, two performances were staged in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, two years after the neighborhood had been devastated by the failure of the federal levee system caused by Hurricane Katrina. This was followed by two performances in the similarly damaged neighborhood Gentilly on 9 and 10 November. The production was staged by American artist Paul Chan, the NYC-based arts organization Creative Time, and the Classical Theatre of Harlem. It featured New Orleans native Wendell Pierce as Vladimir, J. Kyle Manzay as Estragon, Tony Felix and Michael Pepp as Boy. Waiting for Godot in New Orleans

On 30 April 2009, a production directed by Sean Mathias, with Sir Ian McKellen as Estragon and Sir Patrick Stewart as Vladimir, opened at the Haymarket Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. Their performances received critical acclaim, and were the subject of an eight-part documentary series called &quot;Theatreland&quot;, which was produced by Sky Arts. The production was revived at the same theatre in January 2010 for 11 weeks and in 2010 toured internationally with Roger Rees replacing Stewart as Vladimir. This production toured to Adelaide, South Australia, in June 2010, playing at Her Majesty&#x27;s.

A 2009 Broadway revival of the play starring Nathan Lane as Estragon, John Goodman as Pozzo, John Glover as Lucky and Bill Irwin as Vladimir was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Revival of a Play, Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play (John Glover), and Best Costume Design of a Play (Jane Greenwood).

In 2012, a critically acclaimed production starred Alan Mandell, Barry McGovern, James Cromwell, and Hugo Armstrong at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, receiving five Ovation Awards, including best production of a play by a large theater and for actors Alan Mandell and Hugo Armstrong.

In May 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, a production, directed by Scott Elliot with Ethan Hawke as Vladimir, John Leguizamo as Estragon, Wallace Shawn as Lucky and Tariq Trotter as Pozzo, was performed online in the style of a Zoom teleconference call with each actor performing on camera from their respective locations. The production was presented by The New Group and broadcast by the Off Stage Broadway production company for rental or full-access pass.

In New York City, the Theatre for a New Audience staged a production from November 4, 2023, to December 3, 2023 (extended to December 23, 2023) with Paul Sparks as Estragon, Michael Shannon as Vladimir, Ajay Naidu as Pozzo, and Jeff Biehl as Lucky. It was directed by Arin Arbus.

== Adaptations ==
Beckett received numerous requests to adapt &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; for film and television. The author, however, resisted these offers, except for occasional approval out of friendship or sympathy for the person making the request. This was the case when he agreed to some televised productions in his lifetime (including a 1961 American telecast with Zero Mostel as Estragon and Burgess Meredith as Vladimir that &quot;New York Times&quot; theatre critic Alvin Klein describes as having &quot;left critics bewildered and is now a classic&quot;). When Keep Films made Beckett an offer to film an adaptation in which Peter O&#x27;Toole would feature, Beckett tersely told his French publisher to advise them: &quot;I do not want a film of &quot;Godot&quot;.&quot; The BBC broadcast a television production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; on 26 June 1961 &quot;(see above)&quot;, a version for radio having already been transmitted on 25 April 1960. Beckett watched the programme with a few close friends in Peter Woodthorpe&#x27;s Chelsea flat. He was unhappy with what he saw. &quot;My play&quot;, he said, &quot;wasn&#x27;t written for this box. My play was written for small men locked in a big space. Here you&#x27;re all too big for the place.&quot; One analysis argued that Beckett&#x27;s opposition to alterations and creative adaptations stem from his abiding concern with audience reaction rather than proprietary rights over a text being performed.

On the other hand, theatrical adaptations have had more success. For instance, Andre Engel adapted the play in 1979 and was produced in Strasbourg. In this performance, the two main characters were fragmented into 10 characters. The first four involved Gogo, Didi, Lucky, and Pozzo while the rest were divided into three pairs: two tramps, a pair of grim heterosexuals, and a bride raped by her groom. Each of these embodied some characteristics of Estragon and Vladimir. A similar approach was employed by Tamiya Kuriyama who directed his own adaptation of the play in Tokyo. These interpretations, which only used extracts from the dialogues of the original, focused on the minds of the urban-dwellers today, who are considered to be no longer individuals but one of the many or of the whole, which turned such individuals into machines.

A web series adaptation titled &quot;While Waiting for Godot&quot; was also produced at New York University in 2013, setting the story among the modern-day New York homeless. Directed by Rudi Azank, the English script was based on Beckett&#x27;s original French manuscript of &quot;&quot; (the new title being an alternate translation of the French) prior to censorship from British publishing houses in the 1950s, as well as adaptation to the stage. Season 1 of the web series won Best Cinematography at the 2014 Rome Web Awards. Season 2 was released in Spring 2014 on the show&#x27;s official website whilewaitingforgodot.com.

==Place in Beckett&#x27;s work==

Although not his favourite among his plays, &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; was the work which brought Beckett fame and financial stability and as such it always held a special place in his affections. &quot;When the manuscript and rare books dealer, Henry Wenning, asked him if he could sell the original French manuscript for him, Beckett replied: &#x27;Rightly or wrongly have decided not to let &quot;Godot&quot; go yet. Neither sentimental nor financial, probably peak of market now and never such an offer. Can&#x27;t explain.

==Related works==
* Racine&#x27;s &quot;Bérénice&quot; is a play &quot;in which nothing happens for five acts.&quot; In the preface to this play Racine writes: &quot;All creativity consists in making something out of nothing.&quot; Beckett was an avid scholar of the 17th-century playwright and lectured on him during his time at Trinity. &quot;Essential to the static quality of a Racine play is the pairing of characters to talk at length to each other.&quot;
* The title character of Balzac&#x27;s 1851 play &quot;Mercadet&quot; is waiting for financial salvation from his never-seen business partner, Godeau. Although Beckett was familiar with Balzac&#x27;s prose, he insisted that he learned of the play after finishing &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;.
* Many critics, including Al Alvarez and Christopher Ricks, regard the protagonists in Beckett&#x27;s novel &quot;Mercier and Camier&quot; as prototypes of Vladimir and Estragon. &quot;If you want to find the origins of &quot;Godot&quot;&quot;, Beckett told Colin Duckworth once, &quot;look at &quot;Murphy&quot;.&quot; Here we see the agonised protagonist yearning for self-knowledge, or at least complete freedom of thought at any cost, and the dichotomy and interaction of mind and body. Mercier and Camier wander aimlessly about a boggy, rain-soaked island that, although not explicitly named, is Beckett&#x27;s native Ireland. They speak convoluted dialogues similar to Vladimir and Estragon&#x27;s, joke about the weather and chat in pubs, while the purpose of their odyssey is never made clear. The waiting in &quot;Godot&quot; is the wandering of the novel. &quot;There are large chunks of dialogue which he later transferred directly into &quot;Godot&quot;.&quot;
* &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; has been compared with Tom Stoppard&#x27;s 1966 play, &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;. Parallels include two central characters who appear to be aspects of a single character and whose lives are dependent on outside forces over which they have little control. There are also plot parallels, the act of waiting as a significant element of the play, during the waiting, the characters pass time by playing Questions, impersonating other characters, at times repeatedly interrupting each other while at other times remaining silent for long periods.
* The 1991 West End production (see above), inspired Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson to develop &quot;Bottom&quot;, which Mayall described as a &quot;cruder cousin&quot; to &quot;Godot&quot;.

==Works inspired by &quot;Godot&quot;==
* An unauthorised sequel was written by Miodrag Bulatović in 1966: &quot;Godo je došao&quot; (&quot;Godot Arrived&quot;). It was translated from Serbian into German (&quot;Godot ist gekommen&quot;) and French. The playwright presents Godot as a baker who ends up being condemned to death by the four main characters. Since it turns out he is indestructible, Lucky declares him non-existent. Although Beckett was noted for disallowing productions that took even slight liberties with his plays, he let this pass without incident but not without comment. Ruby Cohn writes: &quot;On the flyleaf of my edition of the Bulatović play, Beckett is quoted: &#x27;I think that all that has nothing to do with me.
* Alan Titley&#x27;s Irish-language sequel (Godot Arrives) was written for Oireachtas na Gaeilge in 1987 and produced as a radio play by RTÉ and on stage in 1990 at the Peacock Theatre, Dublin directed by Tómas Mac Anna.
* In the late 1990s an unauthorised sequel was written by Daniel Curzon entitled &quot;Godot Arrives&quot;. Máirtín Coilféir finds similarities to Titley&#x27;s work, of which Curzon was unaware.
* A radical transformation was written by Bernard Pautrat, performed at Théâtre National de Strasbourg in 1979–1980: &quot;Ils allaient obscurs sous la nuit solitaire&quot; (&quot;d&#x27;après &#x27;En attendant Godot&#x27; de Samuel Beckett&quot;)(&quot;They Went Dark Under the Lonely Night (from &#x27;Waiting for Godot&#x27; by Samuel Beckett&quot;)) It features not four actors and the brief appearance of a fifth one (as in Beckett&#x27;s play), but ten actors. Four of them bore the names of Gogo, Didi, Lucky and Pozzo. The dialogue, consisting of extensive quotations from the original, was distributed in segments among the ten actors, not necessarily following the order of the original.&quot;
* Gujarati playwright Labhshankar Thakar, along with Subhash Shah, wrote a play &quot;Ek Undar ane Jadunath&quot; (&quot;A Rat and Jadunath&quot;) based on &quot;Godot&quot; in 1966.
* In 2006, John Griffin wrote and produced a play titled &quot;Godot Has Left the Building&quot;, which serves as a modern-day homage to Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. Set in a post-apocalyptic landscape filled with the remnants of modern technology, the play follows two men, Sebastian and Joe, as they struggle to find meaning in their desolate world. The play retains the absurdist themes of its predecessor, focusing on existential despair and the search for purpose in a seemingly indifferent universe. Unlike &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, which leaves many questions unanswered, &quot;Godot Has Left the Building&quot; is noted for its more direct confrontation with the futility of waiting and the inevitability of meaninglessness. The play received mixed reviews, with some critics praising its atmosphere and performances, while others criticized it for not offering the same depth as Beckett&#x27;s original work.

* In 2007, development on the Godot game engine began. It is a cross-platform, free and open-source game engine with naming inspired by &quot;Waiting for Godot;&quot; referencing the endless trek to a product with every possible feature. Its scope includes both 2D and 3D games targeting PC, mobile, and web platforms.
*In 2011, Mike Rosenthal and Jeff Rosenthal created a video game adaptation of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, played in the browser.

==In popular culture and media==

* In November/December 1987, Garry Trudeau ran a week-long spoof in his &quot;Doonesbury&quot; syndicated comic strip called &quot;Waiting for Mario&quot; in which two characters discussed – and dismissed – each other&#x27;s hopes that Mario Cuomo would declare as a candidate in the 1988 Democratic Party presidential primaries.
* In 1992 &quot;Sesame Street&quot; had a short video in their segment &quot;Monsterpiece Theater&quot; entitled &quot;Waiting for Elmo&quot;. Telly and Grover wait by a bare tree for Elmo to appear. They discuss their situation: If Elmo arrives they would be &quot;happy&quot;, if not they would be &quot;angry&quot;. Elmo never appears, and the tree declares it does not understand the play before leaving, prompting Telly and Grover to chase after it.
* The 1997 comedy film &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; concerns a small-town community theatre group in Missouri who put on a show hoping to attract the attention of prominent Broadway producer Mort Guffman, who never arrives.
* In 1998 a short comedic sketch in episode 9 season 9 of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; featured the two protagonist robots Crow and Tom Servo motionless and expressing they are waiting for &quot;Gorgo&quot; (the titular monster of the movie that was featured). It ends with Mike Nelson disguised as the monster and scaring them off. 
*The 2010 documentary film &quot;The Impossible Itself&quot; is about the 1953 Lüttringhausen and 1957 San Quentin Prison productions of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;.
* A 2001 short film titled &quot;Pitch &#x27;n&#x27; Putt With Beckett &#x27;n&#x27; Joyce&quot;, parodies the play, with Beckett and James Joyce awaiting a never-seen W.B. Yeats at a miniature golf course.
* The Open-Source software editor &amp; game creation tool known as the Godot Engine gets its name from the titular character of the play. The two Argentine developers, Jaun Linietsky &amp; Ariel Manzur, were repeatedly tasked with updating the engine from a period of time from 2001 to 2014, and chose the name &quot;Godot&quot; due to its relation to the play, as it represents the never-ending wish of adding new features in the engine, which would get it closer to an exhaustive product, but would never actually be completed. It released to the public as Godot in 2014.
* A sketch in March 2017 on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, &quot;Waiting for Godot&#x27;s Obamacare Replacement&quot;, Colbert and Patrick Stewart satirized the Trump administration&#x27;s failure to implement their announced &quot;repeal and replace&quot; of Obamacare.
* The fourteenth-season finale of &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; (2019), titled &quot;Waiting for Big Mo&quot;, is based on the play, substituting Dennis Reynolds and Charlie Kelly for Vladimir and Estragon, Mac McDonald and Sweet Dee Reynolds for Pozzo and Lucky, Frank Reynolds for The Boy, and the titular &quot;Big Mo&quot; for Godot.

<text>The Wheel of the Year is an annual cycle of seasonal festivals, observed by a range of modern pagans, marking the year&#x27;s chief solar events (solstices and equinoxes) and the midpoints between them. Modern pagan observances are based to varying degrees on folk traditions, regardless of the historical practices of world civilizations. British neopagans popularized the Wheel of the Year in the mid-20th century, combining the four solar events (&quot;quarter days&quot;) marked by many European peoples, with the four midpoint festivals (&quot;cross-quarter days&quot;) celebrated by Insular Celtic peoples. 

Different paths of modern Paganism may vary regarding the precise timing of each observance, based on such distinctions as the lunar phase and geographic hemisphere. Some Wiccans use the term sabbat () to refer to each festival, represented as a spoke in the Wheel.

==Origins==
Seasonal festival activities of pagan peoples differed across ancient Europe. Among the British Isles, Anglo-Saxons primarily marked the solar stations (solstices and equinoxes), while Insular Celtic peoples marked the four midpoints between them. The four Celtic festivals were known to the Gaels as Beltane (1 May), Lughnasadh (1 August), Samhain (1 November), and Imbolc (1 February).

Influential works such as &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; (1890) by James George Frazer explored various European seasonal festivals and their possible pagan roots. &quot;The Witch-Cult in Western Europe&quot; (1921) by Margaret Murray examined reports of the European witch trials, including a 1661 trial record from Forfar, Scotland, where the accused witch (Issobell Smyth) was alleged to attend witches meetings &quot;every quarter&quot; at Candlemas (2 February), Roodmas (3 May), Lammas (1 August), and Hallowmas (1 November). &quot;The White Goddess&quot; (1948) by Robert Graves suggested that, despite Christianisation, the importance of agricultural and social cycles had preserved eight holidays of &quot;the ancient British festal system&quot;, consisting of Candlemas (2 February), Lady Day (25 March), May Day (1 May), Midsummer Day (24 June), Lammas (1 August), Michaelmas (29 September), Halloween (31 October), and Christmas (25 December).
Two neopagan streams in Britain popularised these seasonal festival calendars in the twentieth century: the Bricket Wood coven, a Wiccan group founded by Gerald Gardner, and the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids, a neo-Druidic group founded by Ross Nichols. Legend holds that Gardner and Nichols harmonised an eight-fold calendar during a naturist retreat, merging the four solar stations alongside their four midpoints as a unified festival cycle. Coordination eventually had the benefit of better aligning celebrations between the two neopagan groups. Gardner&#x27;s first publications refer to the Celtic festivals as &quot;May eve, August eve, November eve (Hallowe&#x27;en), and February eve&quot;.

The phrase &#x27;Wheel of the Year&#x27; was in use by the mid-1960s to describe an annual cycle of eight observances. Prominent Wiccan Aidan Kelly gave names to the Wiccan summer solstice (Litha) and equinox holidays (Ostara and Mabon) in 1974, which were then promoted by Timothy Zell through his &quot;Green Egg&quot; magazine. Popularisation of these names happened gradually; in her 1978 book &quot;Witchcraft For Tomorrow&quot;, influential Wiccan author Doreen Valiente did not use Kelly&#x27;s holiday names, instead simply identifying the solstices and equinoxes (&quot;Lesser Sabbats&quot;) by their seasons. Valiente identified the four &quot;Greater Sabbats&quot;, or fire festivals, by the names Candlemas, May Eve, Lammas, and Hallowe&#x27;en, while also naming their Gaelic counterparts Imbolc, Beltane, Lughnasa, and Samhain.

Due to early Wicca&#x27;s influence on modern paganism and the syncretic adoption of Anglo-Saxon and Celtic motifs, Wheel of the Year festival names in English commonly combine the Celtic names used by Gardner and the Germanic-derived names introduced by Kelly, regardless whether local celebrations are based on those cultures.

==Festivals==
In many traditions of modern pagan cosmology, all things are considered to be cyclical, with time as a perpetual cycle of growth and retreat tied to the Sun&#x27;s annual death and rebirth. This cycle is also viewed as a micro- and macrocosm of other life cycles in an immeasurable series of cycles composing the Universe. The days that fall on the landmarks of the yearly cycle traditionally mark the beginnings and middles of the four seasons. They are regarded with significance and host to major communal festivals. These eight festivals are the most common times for community celebrations.

In addition to the quarter and cross-quarter days, other festivals may also be celebrated throughout the year, especially in the context of polytheistic reconstructionism and other ethnic traditions. While festivals of the Wheel are steeped in solar mythology and symbolism, many Wiccan esbats are commonly based on lunar cycles. Together, they represent the most common celebrations in Wiccan-influenced forms of modern paganism, especially in Neopagan witchcraft groups.

===Winter Solstice (Midwinter / Yule)===

The winter solstice, falling on or about 21 December in the Northern hemisphere, is celebrated by neopagans under various names, including &quot;Midwinter&quot; and &quot;Yule&quot;. A name used by neo-druids is &quot;Alban Arthan&quot;.

It has been recognised as a significant turning point in the yearly cycle since the late Stone Age. Ancient megalithic sites Newgrange and Stonehenge were carefully aligned with the winter solstice sunrise and sunset. While commonly referred to as &quot;Yule&quot;, after the Germanic and later Northern European winter festival of the same name, those celebrations by Germanic heathens likely followed the Christianisation of the Germanic peoples. Historical sources indicate those observances coinciding with the full moon of the lunisolar month following the winter solstice, ranging between January 5 and February 2 in the Gregorian calendar. The reversal of the Sun&#x27;s ebbing presence in the sky symbolises the rebirth of the solar god and presages the return of fertile seasons. From Germanic to Roman tradition, this is the most important time of celebration.

Practices vary, but sacrifice offerings, feasting, and gift giving are common elements of Midwinter festivities. Bringing sprigs and wreaths of evergreenery (such as holly, ivy, mistletoe, yew, and pine) into the home and tree decorating are also common during this time.

===Imbolc (Candlemas)===
&quot;Imbolc&quot; is the traditional Gaelic name for 1 February and traditionally marks the first stirrings of spring. In Christianity it is Saint Brigid&#x27;s Day, while 2 February is Candlemas. It aligns with the contemporary observance of Groundhog Day. It is time for purification and spring cleaning in anticipation of the year&#x27;s new life. In ancient Rome, it was a shepherd&#x27;s holiday, while the Gaels associated it with the onset of ewes&#x27; lactation, prior to birthing the spring lambs.

For Celtic neopagans, the festival is dedicated to the goddess Brigid, daughter of The Dagda and one of the Tuatha Dé Danann.

In the Reclaiming tradition, this is the traditional time for pledges and rededications for the coming year and for initiation among Dianic Wiccans.

===Spring Equinox (Ostara)===
&quot;Ostara&quot; is a name for the spring equinox in some modern pagan traditions. The term is derived from a reconstruction produced by linguist Jacob Grimm of an Old High German form of the Old English &quot;Ēostre&quot;, an Anglo-Saxon goddess for whom, according to Bede, feasts were held in her eponymous month, which he equated to April in the Julian calendar.

Known as &quot;Alban Eilir&quot; in strands of neo-druidry, this holiday is the second of three spring celebrations (the midpoint between Imbolc and Beltane), during which light and darkness are again in balance, with light on the rise. It is a time of new beginnings and of life emerging further from the grips of winter.

===Beltane (May Day)===
&quot;Beltane&quot; comes from the Gaelic name for May Day ( and ), with the Welsh names being , , or . Traditionally, it marked the beginning of summer. It is known as Walpurgis Night in Germanic countries. Ancient Rome observed Floralia at the same time of year.

Following the Christianisation of Europe, the May Day festival was generally associated with maypole dancing and the crowning of the May Queen.

May Day is celebrated in many neo-pagan traditions; in neo-druidry, it recognises the power of life in its fullness, the greening of the world, youthfulness, and flourishing.

===Summer Solstice (Midsummer / Litha)===

The summer solstice, falling on or about 21 June in the Northern hemisphere, is celebrated by neopagans under various names, including &quot;Midsummer&quot; and &quot;Litha&quot;. A name used by neo-druids is &quot;Alban Hefin&quot;.

The name &quot;Litha&quot;, is found in Bede&#x27;s &quot;The Reckoning of Time&quot; (&#x27;, eighth century), which preserves a list of the (then-obsolete) Anglo-Saxon names for the months of the early Germanic calendar. &#x27; (&quot;first&quot; or &quot;preceding&quot; &#x27;) roughly corresponds to June in the Gregorian calendar, and &#x27; (&quot;following&quot; &quot;&quot;) to July. Bede writes that &quot;Litha means &quot;gentle&quot; or &quot;navigable&quot;, because in both these months the calm breezes are gentle and they were wont to sail upon the smooth sea&quot;.

In some neo-druid traditions the festival is called &quot;Alban Hefin&quot;. The sun in its greatest strength is greeted and celebrated on this holiday. While it is the time of greatest strength of the solar current, it also marks a turning point, for the sun also begins its time of decline as the wheel of the year turns. Arguably the most important neo-druidic festival, due to the focus on the sun and its light as a symbol of divine inspiration. Neo-druid groups frequently celebrate this event at Stonehenge.

===Lughnasadh (Lammas)===

&quot;Lughnasadh&quot; or &quot;Lúnasa&quot; () is the Gaelic name for a harvest festival held on or around 1 August. Its Welsh name is . In English it is &quot;Lammas&quot;. Some Wiccan traditions base their celebrations on the Celtic deity Lugh, for whom the holiday is named, while others draw on more eclectic sources. While &quot;Lughnasadh&quot; is one of the most common names for the holiday in Wicca currently, in early versions of Wiccan literature, the festival is referred to as &quot;August Eve&quot;.

Lammas is often referenced interchangeably with Lughnasadh, though the two are sometimes recognised as distinct and separate holidays. While Lughnasadh has Celtic origins, Lammas has Anglo-Saxon origins, and was often marked with the blessing of loaves of bread by the church. The name &quot;Lammas&quot; (contraction of &quot;loaf mass&quot;) implies it is an agrarian-based festival and feast of thanksgiving for grain and bread, which symbolises the first fruits of the harvest.

===Autumn Equinox (Mabon)===

The holiday of the autumnal equinox is known variously among neopagans as &quot;Mabon&quot;, &quot;Harvest Home&quot;, or &quot;Feast of the Ingathering&quot;. A name used by neo-druids is &quot;Alban Elfed&quot;. It is a neopagan festival of thanksgiving for the fruits of the earth and a recognition of the need to share them to secure the blessings of the Goddess and the Gods during the coming winter months. The name &quot;Mabon&quot; was coined by Aidan Kelly around 1970 as a reference to , a character from Welsh mythology.

===Samhain (All Hallows)===

&quot;Samhain&quot; (), or &quot;Sauin&quot;, is the name of a traditional Gaelic festival held around 1 November. Its Welsh name is . For Wiccans, it is a time to celebrate the lives of those who have passed on, and it often involves paying respect to ancestors, family members, elders of the faith, friends, pets, and other loved ones who have died. Aligned with the contemporary observance of Halloween and Day of the Dead, in some traditions the spirits of the departed are invited to attend the festivities. It is seen as a festival of darkness, which is balanced at the opposite point of the Wheel by the festival of Beltane, which is celebrated as a festival of light and fertility. Many neopagans believe that the veil between this world and the afterlife is at its thinnest point of the year at Samhain, making it easier to communicate with those who have departed.

Some authorities claim the Christian festival of All Hallows&#x27; Day (All Saints&#x27; Day, Hallowmas), and All Hallows&#x27; Eve, are appropriations of Samhain by early Christian missionaries to the British Isles.

==Practice==

Celebration commonly takes place outdoors in the form of a communal gathering.

===Dates of celebration===
The precise dates on which festivals are celebrated often vary to some degree, as would the related agricultural milestones of the local region. Celebrations may occur on the astrologically precise quarter and cross-quarter days, the nearest full moon, the nearest new moon, or the nearest weekend for contemporary convenience. The festivals were originally celebrated by peoples in the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Consequently, the traditional timing for seasonal celebrations do not align with the seasons in the Southern Hemisphere or near the equator. Pagans in the Southern Hemisphere often advance these dates by six months to coincide with their own seasons.

===Offerings===

Offerings of food, drink, various objects, etc. have been central in ritual propitiation and veneration for millennia. Modern pagan practice strongly avoids sacrificing animals in favour of grains, herbs, milk, wines, incense, baked goods, minerals, etc. The exception being with ritual feasts including meat, where the inedible parts of the animal are often burned as offerings while the community eats the rest.

Sacrifices are typically offered to gods and ancestors by burning them. Burying and leaving offerings in the open are also common in certain circumstances. The purpose of offering is to benefit the venerated, show gratitude, and give something back, strengthening the bonds between humans and divine and between members of a community.

===Heathen observances===
Heathens may add to the demarcations of the Wheel of the Year with various Days of Remembrance celebrating heroes of the Edda and the Sagas and figures of Germanic history such as Leif Ericson, who explored parts of North America. Heathen organisations using the Wheel of the Year framework for their festival calendar include the Swedish group Samfundet Forn Sed Sverige, the American inclusive group The Troth, and the folkish Ásatrú Alliance.

=== Colours ===
According to some pagan traditions, for each holiday on the wheel, different colours are displayed. This practice is not universal, however, and there are a wide range of ways which different sects or individuals would decorate for the sabbats. 

Many of these colours are also used in the different holidays interchangeably with the others, and colour decorations are not exclusively these colours. However, it is widely believed that Samhain has a particular association with black (and orange) only. Colour associations vary across sects and practice, nor are they an integral part to a holiday. Some practitioners do not have colour associations for sabbats at all.

==Narratives==

===Celtic===
It is a misconception in some quarters of the modern pagan community, influenced by the writings of Robert Graves, that historical Celts had an overarching narrative for the entire cycle of the year. While the various Celtic calendars include &quot;some&quot; cyclical patterns, and a belief in the balance of light and dark, these beliefs vary between the different Celtic cultures. Modern preservationists and revivalists usually observe the four &#x27;fire festivals&#x27; of the Gaelic Calendar, and some also observe local festivals that are held on dates of significance in the different Celtic nations.

===Slavic===

Slavic mythology tells of a persisting conflict involving Perun, god of thunder and lightning, and Veles, the &quot;black god&quot; and &quot;horned god&quot; of the underworld. Enmity between the two is initiated by Veles&#x27; annual ascent up the world tree in the form of a huge serpent and his ultimate theft of Perun&#x27;s divine cattle from the heavenly domain. Perun retaliates to this challenge of the divine order by pursuing Veles, attacking with his lightning bolts from the sky. Veles taunts Perun and flees, transforming himself into various animals and hiding behind trees, houses, even people. (Lightning bolts striking down trees or homes were explained as results of this.) In the end Perun overcomes and defeats Veles, returning him to his place in the realm of the dead. Thus the order of the world is maintained.

The idea that storms and thunder are actually divine battle is pivotal to the changing of the seasons. Dry periods are identified as chaotic results of Veles&#x27; thievery. This duality and conflict represents an opposition of the natural principles of earth, water, substance, and chaos (Veles) and of heaven, fire, spirit, order (Perun), not a clash of good and evil. The cosmic battle between the two also echoes the ancient Indo-European narrative of a fight between the sky-borne storm god and chthonic dragon.

On the &quot;great night&quot; (New Year), two children of Perun are born, Jarilo, god of fertility and vegetation and son of the Moon, and Morana, goddess of nature and death and daughter of the Sun. On the same night, the infant Jarilo is snatched and taken to the underworld, where Veles raises him as his own. At the time of the spring equinox, Jarilo returns across the sea from the world of the dead, bringing with him fertility and spring from the evergreen underworld into the realm of the living. He meets his sister Morana and courts her. With the beginning of summer, the two are married bringing fertility and abundance to Earth, ensuring a bountiful harvest. The union of Perun&#x27;s kin and Veles&#x27; stepson brings peace between two great gods, staving off storms which could damage the harvest. After the harvest, however, Jarilo is unfaithful to his wife and she vengefully slays him, returning him to the underworld and renewing enmity between Perun and Veles. Without her husband, god of fertility and vegetation, Morana – and all of nature with her – withers and freezes in the ensuing winter. She grows into the old and dangerous goddess of darkness and frost, eventually dying by the year&#x27;s end only to be reborn again with her brother in the new year.

===Wicca and Druidry===

In Wicca, the narrative of the Wheel of the Year traditionally centers on the sacred marriage of the God and the Goddess and the god/goddess duality. In this cycle, the God is perpetually born from the Goddess at Yule, grows in power at the vernal equinox (as does the Goddess, now in her &quot;maiden aspect&quot;), courts and impregnates the Goddess at Beltane, reaches his peak at the summer solstice, wanes in power at Lammas, passes into the underworld at Samhain (taking with him the fertility of the Goddess/Earth, who is now in her &quot;crone aspect&quot;) until he is once again born from Her mother/crone aspect at Yule. The Goddess, in turn, ages and rejuvenates endlessly with the seasons, being courted by and giving birth to the Horned God.

Many Wiccan, modern Druids, and eclectic modern pagans incorporate a narrative of the Holly King and Oak King as rulers of the waning year and the waxing year respectively. These two figures battle endlessly with the turning of the seasons. At the summer solstice, the Holly King defeats the Oak King and commences his reign. After the Autumn equinox the Oak King slowly begins to regain his power as the sun begins to wane. Come the winter solstice the Oak King in turn vanquishes the Holly King.After the spring equinox the sun begins to wax again and the Holly King slowly regains his strength until he once again defeats the Oak King at the summer solstice. The two are ultimately seen as essential parts of a whole, light and dark aspects of the male God, and would not exist without each other.

The Holly King is often portrayed as a woodsy figure, similar to the modern Santa Claus, dressed in red with sprigs of holly in his hair and the Oak King as a fertility god.

<text>Widewuto or Videvutis (also &quot;Viduutus&quot;, &quot;Vidvutus&quot;, &quot;Witowudi&quot;, &quot;Waidewut&quot;, &quot;Vaidevutis&quot;) was a legendary king of the pagan Baltic Prussians who ruled along with his elder brother, the high priest (&quot;Kriwe-Kriwajto&quot;) Bruteno in the 6th century AD. They are known from writings of 16th-century chroniclers , Simon Grunau, and Lucas David. Though the legend lacks historical credibility, it became popular with medieval historians. It is unclear whether the legend was authentically Prussian (i.e. recorded from Prussian mythology) or was created by Grunau (possibly inspired by Biblical Moses and Aaron), though Lithuanian researchers tend to support its authenticity.

==Names==
Widewuto&#x27;s name is found in literature in different forms: Veijdenutus, Vydevutis, Vidowuto, Viduutus, Waidewut, Wejdewut, Wenedut, Widewuto, Widewutte, Widiwutus, Wydowudo, Wydowudus, Widowuto, Wydowuto, Widowutus, Witoud, Witoudo, Witouito, Witowudus, Witowuto, Wotowudo, Vaidevutis (modern Lithuanian emendation). As for his brother Bruteno, his name is also written in many ways: Brudeno, Bruteno, Brutenus, Brutheno, Brutteno. Belarusian scholar Siarhiej Sanko interprets their names as &quot;Widow&#x27;s Son&quot; and &quot;Brother&quot;.

==Legends==
According to the legend, Widewuto and Bruteno were kings of the Cimbri, a tribe in Jutland. Driven out by the Goths from their homeland, the Cimbri arrived to Ulmiganea, an area inhabited by rather primitive people who had no agriculture or cities. Widewuto and Bruteno civilized the region and named it Prussia after Bruteno (Pruteno). Gintaras Beresnevičius noted that such arrival has a lot in common with the origin legend of the Lombards. Widewuto ruled wisely and issued laws regulating family life (for example, men could have three wives; burning of gravely sick relatives was allowed; infidelity was punished by death), public life (for example, slavery was prohibited; distinguished warriors with a horse were raised to nobility), and punishments for criminal activity. Bruteno was the high priest (&quot;Kriwe-Kriwajto&quot;) in charge of religious life. Widewuto had twelve sons, whose names were memorialized in the districts of Prussia. For example, Lithuania was named after eldest son Litvas, Sudovia after Sudo, etc. Aged 116, Widewuto burned himself together with Bruteno in a religious ceremony at the temple of Romuva. After their deaths the brothers were worshiped as god Wurskaito.

==Flag==
Widewuto had a white flag, measuring five by three ells. The flag had portraits of three Prussian gods, which Grunau reproduced in his work. On the left, there was the god of the underworld, Peckols – an old man with white beard and white scarf on his head. Middle-aged and fiery-haired Perkūnas, god of sky, storm, and thunder, was in the middle. The god of sea, earth, and crops, Patrimpas, was portrayed as a young beardless man wearing a wreath of grain ears. The flag also displayed mysterious symbols. Several linguists have unsuccessfully attempted to decipher the writing hoping to discover an ancient Prussian writing system.

<text>The Kingdom of the West Saxons, also known as the Kingdom of Wessex, was an Anglo-Saxon kingdom in the south of Great Britain, from around 519 until Alfred the Great declared himself as King of the Anglo-Saxons in 886.

The Anglo-Saxons believed that Wessex was founded by Cerdic and Cynric of the Gewisse, though this is considered by some to be a legend. The two main sources for the history of Wessex are the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (the latter of which drew on and adapted an early version of the List), which sometimes conflict. Wessex became a Christian kingdom after Cenwalh () was baptised and was expanded under his rule. Cædwalla later conquered Sussex, Kent and the Isle of Wight. His successor, Ine (), issued one of the oldest surviving English law codes and established a second West Saxon bishopric. The throne subsequently passed to a series of kings with unknown genealogies.

During the 8th century, as the hegemony of Mercia grew, Wessex largely retained its independence. It was during this period that the system of shires was established. Under Egbert, Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Essex, and Mercia, along with parts of Dumnonia, were conquered. He also obtained the overlordship of the Northumbrian king. However, Mercian independence was restored in 830. During the reign of his successor, Æthelwulf, a Danish army arrived in the Thames estuary, but was decisively defeated. When Æthelwulf&#x27;s son, Æthelbald, usurped the throne, the kingdom was divided to avoid war. Æthelwulf was succeeded in turn by his four sons, the youngest being Alfred the Great.

Wessex was invaded by the Danes in 871, and Alfred was compelled to pay them to leave. They returned in 876, but were forced to withdraw. In 878 they forced Alfred to flee to the Somerset Levels, but were eventually defeated at the Battle of Edington. During his reign Alfred issued a new law code, gathered scholars to his court and was able to devote funds to building ships, organising an army and establishing a system of burhs. Alfred&#x27;s son, Edward, captured the eastern Midlands and East Anglia from the Danes and became ruler of Mercia in 918 upon the death of his sister, Æthelflæd. Edward&#x27;s son, Æthelstan, conquered Northumbria in 927, and England became a unified kingdom for the first time. Cnut the Great, who conquered England in 1016, created the wealthy and powerful earldom of Wessex, but in 1066 Harold Godwinson reunited the earldom with the crown and Wessex ceased to exist.

== History ==
=== Prehistoric Britain ===
From the Neolithic onwards the chalk downland of the area that would become Wessex was traversed by the Harrow Way, which can still be traced from Marazion in Cornwall to the coast of the English Channel near Dover, and was probably connected with the ancient tin trade. In the Late Neolithic, the ceremonial sites of Avebury and Stonehenge were completed on Salisbury Plain, but the final phase of Stonehenge was erected by the so-called &quot;Wessex culture&quot; of the Middle Bronze Age (). The area has many other earthworks and erected stone monuments from the Neolithic and Early Bronze periods, including the Dorset Cursus, an earthwork long and wide, which was oriented to the midwinter sunset. Although agriculture and hunting were pursued during this long period, there is little archaeological evidence of human settlements. By the Iron Age, Celtic British tribes such as the Durotriges, Atrebates, Belgae and Dobunni occupied the future Wessex.

=== Roman Britain ===

Following the Roman conquest of Britain, from the 1st century AD, numerous country Roman villa with attached farms were established across Wessex, along with the important towns of Dorchester and Winchester (the ending -chester comes from Latin &quot;castra&quot;, &quot;a military camp&quot;). The Romans, or rather the Romano-British, built another major road that integrated Wessex, running eastwards from Exeter through Dorchester to Winchester and Silchester and on to London.

In the mid-4th century there were increasing raids on Roman Britain by peoples such as the Picts, Scottish people, Attacotti, and Franks, as well as the Saxons. In 367, these tribes simultaneously invaded Britain from the north, west and east. The invaders reportedly defeated or co-opted Roman forces in most parts of northern and western Britain. However, the Roman general Theodosius had recaptured most areas by the end of 368. In 380–1, Magnus Maximus defeated further raids. However, there was increasing internal conflict across the Roman Empire. During 383–4, in the context of the overthrow of Emperor Gratian, Maximus took most of the garrison from Britain to Gaul, where he was made Augustus of the West, ruling Britain, Gaul, Spain and Roman Africa. Following the death of Maximus in 388, Roman authority in Britain again declined. During the late 390s, Stilicho attempted to restore control, with a campaign against the Picti, but this was undermined in 401 when Stilicho transferred troops to the Continent to fight the Goths. Two subsequent Roman rulers of Britain were murdered. In 407, a Roman officer in Britain, Constantine III declared himself Augustus of the West, and left for Gaul, taking with him Roman troops. Finally, in 410, when Romano-British officials requested military assistance from Emperor Honorius, he told them to manage their own defences. Economic decline occurred after these events: circulation of Roman coins ended and the importation of items from the Roman Empire stopped.

=== Anglo-Saxon settlement ===

Theories about the settlement of Saxons, Jutes and Angles in Britain are divided into two categories by the historian Peter Hunter Blair (1956), namely &quot;Welsh&quot; and &quot;English&quot;. 

==== The Welsh tradition ====

The Welsh tradition is exemplified by Gildas, in &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;. In brief, it states that after the Romans left, the Celtic Britons managed to continue for a time without any major disruptions. However, when finally faced with northern invaders, a certain unnamed ruler in Britain (called &quot;a proud tyrant&quot; by Gildas) requested assistance from the Saxons in exchange for land. 

There were no conflicts between the British and the Saxons for a time, but following &quot;a dispute about the supply of provisions&quot; the Saxons warred against the British and severely damaged parts of the country. In time, however, some Saxon troops left Britain; under Ambrosius Aurelianus, the British subsequently defeated those who remained. 

A lengthy conflict ensued, in which neither side gained any decisive advantage until the Britons routed the Saxons at the Battle of Mons Badonicus. After this, there occurred a peaceful period for the Britons, under which Gildas was living at the time he wrote the &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;. 

==== The English tradition ====

One of the &quot;English&quot; traditions about the Saxon arrival concerns Hengest and Horsa. When Bede wrote his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, he adapted Gildas&#x27; narrative and added details, such as the names of those involved. To the &quot;proud tyrant&quot; he gave the name Vortigern, and the Saxon commanders he named Hengest and Horsa. 

Further details were added to the story in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, which was partially written by Nennius. According to the &quot;Historia&quot;, Hengest and Horsa fought the invaders of Britain under the condition of gaining the Island of Thanet. The daughter of Hengest, Rowena, later arrived on a ship of reinforcements, and Vortigern married her. 

However, a war arose in Kent due to a dispute between Hengest and Vortigern&#x27;s son. After losing several battles, the Saxons finally defeated the British by treacherously attacking them once the two parties had convened for a meeting. Some additional details of the Hengest and Horsa legend are found in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; then records subsequent Saxon arrivals, including that of Cerdic, the founder of Wessex, in 495.

==== The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle ====

According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Cerdic of Wessex and his son Cynric of Wessex landed in southern Hampshire in 495, but this account is not regarded by historians as reliable due to duplication of &quot;Chronicle&quot; entries and evidence that the area was first occupied by Jutes. Although the entry mentions Cynric as Cerdic&#x27;s son, a different source lists him as the son of Cerdic&#x27;s son, Creoda of Wessex. 

The &quot;Chronicle&quot; continues, stating that &quot;Port, and his two sons Bieda and Mægla&quot;, landed at Portsmouth in 501 and killed a high-ranking British nobleman. In 508, Cerdic and Cynric slew British king Natanleod along with five thousand of his men (though the historicity of Natanleod has been disputed), and Cerdic became the first king of Wessex in 519. 

The Saxons attacked Cerdicesford in 519, intending to cross the River Avon and block a road which connected Old Sarum and Badbury Rings, a British stronghold. The battle appears to have ended as a draw, and the expansion of Wessex ended for about thirty years. This is likely due to losses suffered during the battle and an apparent peace agreement with the Britons. 

The battle of Mons Badonicus is believed to have been fought around this time. Gildas states that the Saxons were completely defeated in the battle, in which King Arthur participated according to Nennius. This defeat is not recorded in the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. The thirty-year period of peace was temporarily interrupted when, according to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, the Saxons conquered the Isle of Wight in 530 at a battle near Carisbrooke.

Cynric became the ruler of Wessex after Cerdic died in 534, and reigned for twenty-six years. The sources do agree that Ceawlin, who succeeded Cynric in about 581, is the son of Cynric; he usually is named as the father of Cuthwine. Ceawlin&#x27;s reign is thought to be more reliably documented than those of his predecessors, though the &quot;Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s dates of 560 to 592 are different from the revised chronology. Ceawlin overcame pockets of resisting Britons to the northeast, in the Chilterns, Gloucestershire and Somerset. The capture of Cirencester, Gloucester and Bath in 577, after the pause caused by the battle of Mons Badonicus, opened the way to the southwest.

Ceawlin is one of the seven kings named in Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; as holding &quot;imperium&quot; over the southern English: the &quot;Chronicle&quot; later repeated this claim, referring to Ceawlin as a &quot;bretwalda&quot;, or &quot;Britain-ruler&quot;. Ceawlin was deposed, perhaps by his nephew, Ceol, and died a year later. 

Six years later, in about 594, Ceol was succeeded by a brother, Ceolwulf, who was succeeded in his turn in about 617 by Cynegils of Wessex. The genealogies do not agree on Cynegils&#x27; pedigree: his father is variously given as Ceola, Ceolwulf, Ceol, Cuthwine, Cutha or Cuthwulf.

The tradition embodied in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, and in the genealogies of the West Saxon dynasty, is open to considerable doubt. This is largely because the founder of the dynasty and a number of his alleged descendants had Brittonic Celtic, rather than Anglo-Saxon Germanic, names. The name Cerdic is derived from the British name Caraticos. This may indicate that Cerdic was a native Briton, and that his dynasty became anglicised over time. Other members of the dynasty possessing Celtic names include Ceawlin and Cædwalla. Cædwalla, who died as late as 689, was the last West Saxon king to possess a Celtic name.

=== Christianisation of Wessex ===

Cynegils&#x27; reign saw the first event in West Saxon history that can be dated with reasonable certainty: the baptism of Cynegils by Birinus, at the end of the 630s, perhaps in 640. Birinus was then established as bishop of the West Saxons, with his seat at Dorchester-on-Thames. This was the first conversion to Christianity by a West Saxon king, but it was not accompanied by the immediate conversion of all the West Saxons: Cynegils&#x27; successor (and probably his son), Cenwealh, who came to the throne in about 642, was a pagan at his accession. However, he too was baptised only a few years later and Wessex became firmly established as a Christian kingdom. Cynegils&#x27; godfather was King Oswald of Northumbria, and his conversion may have been connected with an alliance against King Penda of Mercia, who had previously attacked Wessex.

These attacks marked the beginning of sustained pressure from the expanding kingdom of Mercia. In time this would deprive Wessex of its territories north of the Thames and the (Bristol) Avon, encouraging the kingdom&#x27;s reorientation southwards. Cenwealh married Penda&#x27;s daughter, and when he repudiated her, Penda again invaded and drove him into exile for some time, perhaps three years. The dates are uncertain but it was probably in the late 640s or early 650s. He spent his exile in East Anglia, and was converted to Christianity there. After his return, Cenwealh faced further attacks from Penda&#x27;s successor Wulfhere, but was able to expand West Saxon territory in Somerset at the expense of the Britons. He established a second bishopric at Winchester, while the one at Dorchester was soon abandoned as Mercian power pushed southwards.

After Cenwealh&#x27;s death in 673, his widow, Seaxburh, held the throne for a year; she was followed by Æscwine, who was apparently descended from another brother of Ceawlin. This was one of several occasions when the kingship of Wessex is said to have passed to a remote branch of the royal family with an unbroken male line of descent from Cerdic; these claims may be genuine, or may reflect the spurious assertion of descent from Cerdic to legitimise a new dynasty. Æscwine&#x27;s reign only lasted two years, and in 676 the throne passed back to the immediate family of Cenwealh with the accession of his brother Centwine of Wessex. Centwine is known to have fought and won battles against the Britons, but the details have not survived.

Centwine was succeeded by another supposed distant relative, Cædwalla, who claimed descent from Ceawlin. Cædwalla reigned for just two years, but achieved a dramatic expansion of the kingdom&#x27;s power, conquering the kingdoms of Sussex, Kent and the Isle of Wight, although Kent regained its independence almost immediately and Sussex followed some years later. His reign ended in 688 when he abdicated and went on pilgrimage to Rome, where he was baptised by Pope Sergius I but died soon afterwards. Bokerley Dyke appears to have been fortified around this period, and the former Roman Road at Ackling Dyke blocked by the Britons to prevent the West Saxons&#x27; advance into Dorset. Evidence suggests that Dorset, north Hampshire, eastern Devon and southern Wiltshire were substantially under West Saxon control by the beginning of the reign of Cædwalla of Wessex in 685, but details of their conquest are unclear.

His successor was Ine, who also claimed to be a descendant of Cerdic through Ceawlin, but again through a long-separated line of descent. Ine was the most durable of the West Saxon kings, reigning for 38 years. He issued the oldest surviving English code of laws apart from those of the kingdom of Kent, and established a second West Saxon bishopric at Sherborne, covering the area west of Selwood Forest, which formed an important boundary between east and west Wessex. Near the end of his life he followed in Cædwalla&#x27;s footsteps by abdicating and making a pilgrimage to Rome. The throne then passed to a series of other kings who claimed descent from Cerdic, but whose supposed genealogies and relationship to one another are unknown.

During the 8th century Wessex was overshadowed by Mercia, whose power was then at its height, and the West Saxon kings may at times have acknowledged Mercian overlordship. They were, however, able to avoid the more substantial control which Mercia exerted over smaller kingdoms. During this period Wessex continued its gradual advance to the west, overwhelming the British kingdom of Dumnonia (Devon). At this time Wessex took &quot;de facto&quot; control of much of Devon, although Britons retained a degree of independence in Devon until at least the 10th century. (William of Malmesbury claimed that the Britons and Saxons inhabited Exeter &quot;as equals&quot; until 927.) As a result of the Mercian conquest of the northern portion of its early territories in Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire, the Thames and the Avon now probably formed the northern boundary of Wessex, while its heartland lay in Hampshire, Wiltshire, Berkshire, Dorset and Somerset. The system of shires which was later to form the basis of local administration throughout England (and eventually Ireland, Wales and Scotland as well) originated in Wessex, and had been established by the mid-8th century.

=== Hegemony of Wessex and the Viking raids ===
In 802 the fortunes of Wessex were transformed by the accession of Egbert who came from a cadet branch of the ruling dynasty that claimed descent from Ine&#x27;s brother Ingild. With his accession the throne became firmly established in the hands of a single lineage. Early in his reign he conducted two campaigns against the &quot;West Welsh&quot;, first in 813 and then again at Gafulford in 825. During the course of these campaigns he conquered the western Britons still in Devon and reduced those beyond the River Tamar, now Cornwall, to the status of a vassal. In 825 or 826 he overturned the political order of England by decisively defeating King Beornwulf of Mercia at Ellendun and seizing control of Surrey, Sussex, Kent and Essex from the Mercians, while with his help East Anglia broke away from Mercian control. In 829 he conquered Mercia, driving its King Wiglaf into exile, and secured acknowledgement of his overlordship from the king of Northumbria. He thereby became the Bretwalda, or high king of Britain. This position of dominance was short-lived, as Wiglaf returned and restored Mercian independence in 830, but the expansion of Wessex across south-eastern England proved permanent.

Egbert&#x27;s later years saw the beginning of Danish Viking raids on Wessex, which occurred frequently from 835 onwards. In 851 a huge Danish army, said to have been carried on 350 ships, arrived in the Thames estuary. Having defeated King Beorhtwulf of Mercia in battle, the Danes moved on to invade Wessex, but were decisively crushed by Egbert&#x27;s son and successor King Æthelwulf in the exceptionally bloody Battle of Aclea. This victory postponed Danish conquests in England for fifteen years, but raids on Wessex continued.

In 855–856 Æthelwulf went on pilgrimage to Rome and his eldest surviving son Æthelbald took advantage of his absence to seize his father&#x27;s throne. On his return, Æthelwulf agreed to divide the kingdom with his son to avoid bloodshed, ruling the new territories in the east while Æthelbald held the old heartland in the west. Æthelwulf was succeeded by each of his four surviving sons ruling one after another: the rebellious Æthelbald, then Æthelbert, who had previously inherited the eastern territories from his father and who reunited the kingdom on Æthelbald&#x27;s death, then Æthelred, and finally Alfred the Great. This occurred because the first two brothers died in wars with the Danes without issue, while Æthelred&#x27;s sons were too young to rule when their father died.

=== Last English kingdom ===
In 865, several of the Danish commanders combined their respective forces into one large army and landed in England. Over the following years, what became known as the Great Heathen Army overwhelmed the kingdoms of Northumbria and East Anglia. Then in 871, the Great Summer Army arrived from Scandinavia, to reinforce the Great Heathen Army. The reinforced army invaded Wessex and, although Æthelred and Alfred won some victories and succeeded in preventing the conquest of their kingdom, a number of defeats and heavy losses of men compelled Alfred to pay the Danes to leave Wessex. The Danes spent the next few years subduing Mercia and some of them settled in Northumbria, but the rest returned to Wessex in 876. Alfred responded effectively and was able with little fighting to bring about their withdrawal in 877. A portion of the Danish army settled in Mercia, but at the beginning of 878 the remaining Danes mounted a winter invasion of Wessex, taking Alfred by surprise and overrunning much of the kingdom. Alfred was reduced to taking refuge with a small band of followers in the marshes of the Somerset Levels, but after a few months he was able to gather an army and defeated the Danes at the Battle of Edington, bringing about their final withdrawal from Wessex to settle in East Anglia. There were simultaneous Danish raids on the north coast of France and Brittany in the 870s – prior to the establishment of Normandy in 911 – and recorded Danish alliances with both Bretons and Cornish may have resulted in the suppression of Cornish autonomy with the death by drowning of King Donyarth in 875 as recorded by the Annales Cambriae. No subsequent &#x27;Kings&#x27; of Cornwall are recorded after this time, but Asser records Cornwall as a separate kingdom from Wessex in the 890s.

In 879 a Viking fleet that had assembled in the Thames estuary sailed across the English Channel to start a new campaign on the continent. The rampaging Viking army on the continent encouraged Alfred to protect his Kingdom of Wessex. Over the following years Alfred carried out a dramatic reorganisation of the government and defences of Wessex, building warships, organising the army into two shifts which served alternately, and establishing a system of fortified &quot;burhs&quot; across the kingdom. This system is recorded in a 10th-century document known as the Burghal Hidage, which details the location and garrisoning requirements of thirty-three forts, whose positioning ensured that no one in Wessex was more than a long day&#x27;s ride from a place of safety. In the 890s these reforms helped him to repel the invasion of another huge Danish army – which was aided by the Danes settled in England – with minimal losses.

In 2015, two individuals found a large hoard near Leominster consisting primarily of Saxon jewellery and silver ingots but also coins; the latter date to around 879 CE. According to a news report, &quot;experts believe it [the hoard] was buried by a Viking during a series of raids known to have taken place in the area at that time&quot;, while Wessex was ruled by Alfred the Great and Mercia by Ceolwulf II. Two imperial coins recovered from the treasure hunters depict the two kings, &quot;indicating an alliance between the two kingdoms—at least, for a time—that was previously unknown to historians&quot;, according to the report. A report by The Guardian adds that

&quot;The presence of both kings on the two emperor coins suggests some sort of pact between the pair. But the rarity of the coins also suggests that Alfred quickly dropped his ally, who was just about written out of history&quot;.

Alfred also reformed the administration of justice, issued a new law code and championed a revival of scholarship and education. He gathered scholars from around England and Europe to his court, and with their help translated a range of Latin texts into English, doing much of the work personally, and orchestrated the composition of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. As a result of these literary efforts and the political dominance of Wessex, the West Saxon dialect of this period became the standard written form of Old English for the rest of the Anglo-Saxon period and beyond.

The Danish conquests had destroyed the kingdoms of Northumbria and East Anglia and divided Mercia in half, with the Danes settling in the north-east while the south-west was left to the English king Ceolwulf, allegedly a Danish puppet. When Ceolwulf&#x27;s rule came to an end he was succeeded as ruler of &quot;English Mercia&quot; not by another king but by a mere ealdorman, Aethelred, who acknowledged Alfred&#x27;s overlordship and married his daughter Ethelfleda. The process by which this transformation of the status of Mercia took place is unknown, but it left Alfred as the only remaining English king.

=== Unification of England; Earldom of Wessex ===
After the invasions of the 890s, Wessex and English Mercia continued to be attacked by the Danish settlers in England, and by small Danish raiding forces from overseas, but these incursions were usually defeated, while there were no further major invasions from the continent. The balance of power tipped steadily in favour of the English. In 911 Ealdorman Æthelred died, leaving his widow, Alfred&#x27;s daughter Æthelflæd, in charge of Mercia. Alfred&#x27;s son and successor Edward the Elder then annexed London, Oxford and the surrounding area, probably including Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, from Mercia to Wessex. Between 913 and 918 a series of English offensives overwhelmed the Danes of Mercia and East Anglia, bringing all of England south of the Humber under Edward&#x27;s power. In 918 Æthelflæd died and Edward took over direct control of Mercia, extinguishing what remained of its independence and ensuring that henceforth there would be only one Kingdom of the English. In 927 Edward&#x27;s successor Æthelstan conquered Northumbria, bringing the whole of England under one ruler for the first time. The Kingdom of Wessex had thus been transformed into the Kingdom of England.

Æthelstan never married, and when he died in 939 he was succeeded by his half-brother Edmund. Edmund&#x27;s sons were young children when he died in 946, so he was succeeded by his full brother Eadred. Edmund and Eadred both lost control of Northumbria at the beginning of their reigns but had regained it by their deaths. Northumbria&#x27;s acceptance of West Saxon rule in 954 meant the final unification of the kingdom of England. When Eadred died in 955, he was succeeded by Edmund&#x27;s elder son Eadred, whose incompetent rule may have led to the division of England between Wessex under Eadred and Mercia and Northumbria under his younger brother Edgar in 957, although some historians argue that it was intended from the start that the kingdom would be divided when Edgar came of age, which occurred in 957. Eadwig died in 959 and Edgar became king of the whole of England.

After the conquest of England by the Danish king Cnut in 1016, he established earldoms based on the former kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia, but initially administered Wessex personally. Within a few years, however, he had created an earldom of Wessex, encompassing all of England south of the Thames, for his English henchman Godwin, Earl of Wessex. For almost fifty years the vastly wealthy holders of this earldom, first Godwin and then his son Harold Godwinson, were the most powerful men in English politics after the king. Finally, on the death of Edward the Confessor in 1066, Harold became king, reuniting the earldom of Wessex with the crown. No new earl was appointed before the ensuing Norman Conquest of England, and as the Norman kings soon did away with the great earldoms of the late Anglo-Saxon period, 1066 marks the extinction of Wessex as a political unit.

==Symbols==

===Wyvern or dragon===

Wessex is often symbolised by a wyvern or dragon.

Both Henry of Huntingdon and Matthew of Westminster talk of a golden dragon being raised at the Battle of Burford in 752 by the West Saxons. The Bayeux Tapestry depicts a fallen golden dragon, as well as a red/golden/white dragon at the death of King Harold II, who was previously Earl of Wessex. Dragon standards were in fairly wide use in Europe at the time, being derived from the &quot;draco&quot; standard employed by the later Roman army, and there is no evidence that it explicitly identified Wessex.

A panel of 18th century stained glass at Exeter Cathedral indicates that an association with an image of a dragon in south west Britain pre-dated the Victorians. Nevertheless, the association with Wessex was only popularised in the 19th century, most notably through the writings of E. A. Freeman. By the time of the grant of armorial bearings by the College of Arms to Somerset County Council in 1911, a (red) dragon had become the accepted heraldic emblem of the former kingdom. This precedent was followed in 1937 when Wiltshire County Council was granted arms. Two gold Wessex dragons were later granted as supporters to the arms of Dorset County Council in 1950.

In the British Army the wyvern has been used to represent Wessex: the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, and postwar regional 43 (Wessex) Brigade adopted a formation sign consisting of a gold wyvern on a black or dark blue background. The regular Wessex Brigade of the 1960s adopted a cap badge featuring the heraldic beast, until the regiments took back up individual regimental badges in the late 1960s. The Territorial Army Wessex Regiment continued to wear the Wessex Brigade badge until the late 1980s when its individual companies too readopted their parent regular regimental cap badges. The now disbanded West Somerset Yeomanry adopted a Wessex Wyvern rampant as the centre piece for its cap badge, and the current Royal Wessex Yeomanry adopted a similar device in 2014 when the Regiment moved from wearing individual squadron county yeomanry cap badges to a unified single Regimental cap badge.

When Sophie, Countess of Wessex was granted arms, the sinister supporter assigned was a blue wyvern, described by the College of Arms as &quot;an heraldic beast which has long been associated with Wessex&quot;.

In the 1970s William Crampton, the founder of the British Flag Institute, designed a flag for the Wessex region which depicts a gold wyvern on a red field.

===Cross of Saint Aldhelm===

A white cross on a field of red, known as the Flag of Saint Aldhelm (whose feast day on 25 May is also celebrated as &quot;Wessex Day&quot;) is sometimes flown by Wessex regionalists as an alternative to the Wyvern. The flag is effectively an inverted version of the Cross of Saint George, although it is also thought to have been derived from the arms of Sherborne Abbey, Dorset.

===Attributed coat of arms===
A coat of arms was attributed by medieval heralds to the Kings of Wessex. These arms appear in a manuscript of the 13th century, and are blazoned as &quot;Azure, a cross patoncé&quot; (alternatively a &quot;cross fleury&quot; or &quot;cross moline&quot;) &quot;between four martlets Or&quot;.

The attributed arms of Wessex are also known as the &quot;Arms of Edward the Confessor&quot;, and the design is based on an emblem historically used by King Edward the Confessor on the reverse side of pennies minted by him. The heraldic design continued to represent both Wessex and Edward in classical heraldry and is found on a number of church windows in derived shields such as the Arms of the Collegiate Church of St Peter at Westminster (Westminster Abbey, which was founded by the king).

== Cultural and political identity in modern times ==
Thomas Hardy used a fictionalised Wessex as a setting for many of his novels, adopting his friend William Barnes&#x27; term &quot;Wessex&quot; for their home county of Dorset and its neighbouring counties in the south and west of England. Hardy&#x27;s Wessex excluded Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire, but the city of Oxford, which he called &quot;Christminster&quot;, was visited as part of Wessex in &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;. He gave each of his Wessex counties a fictionalised name, such as with Berkshire, which is known in the novels as &quot;North Wessex&quot;.

In the book and television series &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Wessex&quot; is the primary setting, focusing on the rule of Alfred the Great and the war against the Vikings.

&quot;Wessex&quot; remains a common term for the area. Many organisations that cover the area of Dorset, Somerset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire use the name Wessex in their company or organisation name; for example Wessex Bus, Wessex Water, and Wessex Institute of Technology. The Wessex Constitutional Convention and Wessex Regionalist Party are minor groups seeking increased political autonomy for the region. A number of British Army units also use the name Wessex, such as the Wessex Regiment, and 32nd Regiment Royal Artillery – known as the &#x27;Wessex Gunners&#x27;.

In 2023, Dorset Council proposed to form a devolved authority named &quot;Heart of Wessex&quot; with Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, Somerset, North Somerset and Wiltshire councils.

<text>In mathematics, weak topology is an alternative term for certain initial topologies, often on topological vector spaces or spaces of linear operators, for instance on a Hilbert space. The term is most commonly used for the initial topology of a topological vector space (such as a normed vector space) with respect to its continuous dual. The remainder of this article will deal with this case, which is one of the concepts of functional analysis.

One may call subsets of a topological vector space weakly closed (respectively, weakly compact, etc.) if they are closed (respectively, compact, etc.) with respect to the weak topology. Likewise, functions are sometimes called [[Dual system#Weak continuity|weakly continuous]] (respectively, weakly differentiable, weakly analytic, etc.) if they are continuous (respectively, differentiable, analytic, etc.) with respect to the weak topology.

== History ==

Starting in the early 1900s, David Hilbert and Marcel Riesz made extensive use of weak convergence. The early pioneers of functional analysis did not elevate norm convergence above weak convergence and oftentimes viewed weak convergence as preferable. In 1929, Banach introduced weak convergence for normed spaces and also introduced the analogous weak-* convergence. The weak topology is called in French and in German.

== The weak and strong topologies ==
Let formula_1 be a topological field, namely a field with a topology such that addition, multiplication, and division are continuous. In most applications formula_1 will be either the field of complex numbers or the field of real numbers with the familiar topologies.

=== Weak topology with respect to a pairing ===
Both the weak topology and the weak* topology are special cases of a more general construction for pairings, which we now describe. 
The benefit of this more general construction is that any definition or result proved for it applies to &quot;both&quot; the weak topology and the weak* topology, thereby making redundant the need for many definitions, theorem statements, and proofs. This is also the reason why the weak* topology is also frequently referred to as the &quot;weak topology&quot;; because it is just an instance of the weak topology in the setting of this more general construction.

Suppose is a pairing of vector spaces over a topological field formula_1 (i.e. and are vector spaces over formula_1 and is a bilinear map).

:Notation. For all , let denote the linear functional on defined by . Similarly, for all , let be defined by .

:Definition. The weak topology on induced by (and ) is the weakest topology on , denoted by or simply , making all maps continuous, as ranges over .

The weak topology on is now automatically defined as described in the article Dual system. However, for clarity, we now repeat it.

:Definition. The weak topology on induced by (and ) is the weakest topology on , denoted by or simply , making all maps continuous, as ranges over .

If the field formula_1 has an absolute value , then the weak topology on is induced by the family of seminorms, , defined by

for all and . This shows that weak topologies are locally convex.

:Assumption. We will henceforth assume that formula_1 is either the real numbers formula_7 or the complex numbers formula_8.

==== Canonical duality ====

We now consider the special case where is a vector subspace of the algebraic dual space of (i.e. a vector space of linear functionals on ).

There is a pairing, denoted by formula_9 or formula_10, called the canonical pairing whose bilinear map formula_11 is the canonical evaluation map, defined by formula_12 for all formula_13 and formula_14. Note in particular that formula_15 is just another way of denoting formula_16 i.e. formula_17.

:Assumption. If is a vector subspace of the algebraic dual space of then we will assume that they are associated with the canonical pairing .

In this case, the weak topology on (resp. the weak topology on ), denoted by (resp. by ) is the weak topology on (resp. on ) with respect to the canonical pairing .

The topology is the initial topology of with respect to .

If is a vector space of linear functionals on , then the continuous dual of with respect to the topology is precisely equal to .

==== The weak and weak* topologies ====

Let be a topological vector space (TVS) over formula_1, that is, is a formula_1 vector space equipped with a topology so that vector addition and scalar multiplication are continuous. We call the topology that starts with the original, starting, or given topology (the reader is cautioned against using the terms &quot;initial topology&quot; and &quot;strong topology&quot; to refer to the original topology since these already have well-known meanings, so using them may cause confusion). We may define a possibly different topology on using the topological or continuous dual space formula_20, which consists of all linear functionals from into the base field formula_1 that are continuous with respect to the given topology.

Recall that formula_22 is the canonical evaluation map defined by formula_12 for all formula_13 and formula_25, where in particular, formula_26.

:Definition. The weak topology on is the weak topology on with respect to the canonical pairing formula_27. That is, it is the weakest topology on making all maps formula_28 continuous, as formula_16 ranges over formula_20.

:Definition: The weak topology on formula_20 is the weak topology on formula_20 with respect to the canonical pairing formula_27. That is, it is the weakest topology on formula_20 making all maps formula_35 continuous, as ranges over . This topology is also called the weak* topology.

We give alternative definitions below.

=== Weak topology induced by the continuous dual space ===

Alternatively, the weak topology on a TVS is the initial topology with respect to the family formula_20. In other words, it is the coarsest topology on X such that each element of formula_20 remains a continuous function.

A subbase for the weak topology is the collection of sets of the form formula_38 where formula_39 and is an open subset of the base field formula_1. In other words, a subset of is open in the weak topology if and only if it can be written as a union of (possibly infinitely many) sets, each of which is an intersection of finitely many sets of the form formula_38.

From this point of view, the weak topology is the coarsest polar topology.

=== Weak convergence ===
The weak topology is characterized by the following condition: a net formula_42 in converges in the weak topology to the element of if and only if formula_43 converges to formula_44 in formula_7 or formula_8 for all formula_39.

In particular, if formula_48 is a sequence in , then formula_48 converges weakly to if

:formula_50

as for all formula_51. In this case, it is customary to write

:formula_52

or, sometimes,

:formula_53

=== Other properties ===

If is equipped with the weak topology, then addition and scalar multiplication remain continuous operations, and is a locally convex topological vector space.

If is a normed space, then the dual space formula_20 is itself a normed vector space by using the norm

:formula_55

This norm gives rise to a topology, called the strong topology, on formula_20. This is the topology of uniform convergence. The uniform and strong topologies are generally different for other spaces of linear maps; see below.

== Weak-* topology ==

The weak* topology is an important example of a polar topology.

A space can be embedded into its double dual &quot;X**&quot; by

:formula_57

Thus formula_58 is an injective linear mapping, though not necessarily surjective (spaces for which &quot;this&quot; canonical embedding is surjective are called reflexive). The weak-* topology on formula_20 is the weak topology induced by the image of formula_60. In other words, it is the coarsest topology such that the maps &quot;Tx&quot;, defined by formula_61 from formula_20 to the base field formula_7 or formula_8 remain continuous.

;Weak-* convergence

A net formula_65 in formula_20 is convergent to formula_67 in the weak-* topology if it converges pointwise:

:formula_68

for all formula_13. In particular, a sequence of formula_70 converges to formula_67 provided that

:formula_72

for all . In this case, one writes

:formula_73

as .

Weak-* convergence is sometimes called the simple convergence or the pointwise convergence. Indeed, it coincides with the pointwise convergence of linear functionals.

=== Properties ===

If is a separable (i.e. has a countable dense subset) locally convex space and &quot;H&quot; is a norm-bounded subset of its continuous dual space, then &quot;H&quot; endowed with the weak* (subspace) topology is a metrizable topological space. However, for infinite-dimensional spaces, the metric cannot be translation-invariant. If is a separable metrizable locally convex space then the weak* topology on the continuous dual space of is separable.

;Properties on normed spaces

By definition, the weak* topology is weaker than the weak topology on formula_20. An important fact about the weak* topology is the Banach–Alaoglu theorem: if is normed, then the closed unit ball in formula_20 is weak*-compact (more generally, the polar in formula_20 of a neighborhood of 0 in is weak*-compact). Moreover, the closed unit ball in a normed space is compact in the weak topology if and only if is reflexive.

In more generality, let be locally compact valued field (e.g., the reals, the complex numbers, or any of the p-adic number systems). Let be a normed topological vector space over , compatible with the absolute value in . Then in formula_20, the topological dual space of continuous -valued linear functionals on , all norm-closed balls are compact in the weak* topology.

If is a normed space, a version of the Heine-Borel theorem holds. In particular, a subset of the continuous dual is weak* compact if and only if it is weak* closed and norm-bounded. This implies, in particular, that when is an infinite-dimensional normed space then the closed unit ball at the origin in the dual space of does not contain any weak* neighborhood of 0 (since any such neighborhood is norm-unbounded). Thus, even though norm-closed balls are compact, X* is not weak* locally compact.

If is a normed space, then is separable if and only if the weak* topology on the closed unit ball of formula_20 is metrizable, in which case the weak* topology is metrizable on norm-bounded subsets of formula_20. If a normed space has a dual space that is separable (with respect to the dual-norm topology) then is necessarily separable. If is a Banach space, the weak* topology is not metrizable on all of formula_20 unless is finite-dimensional.

== Examples ==

=== Hilbert spaces ===

Consider, for example, the difference between strong and weak convergence of functions in the Hilbert space . Strong convergence of a sequence formula_81 to an element means that

:formula_82

as . Here the notion of convergence corresponds to the norm on .

In contrast weak convergence only demands that

:formula_83

for all functions (or, more typically, all &quot;f&quot; in a dense subset of such as a space of test functions, if the sequence {&quot;ψ&quot;&quot;k&quot;} is bounded). For given test functions, the relevant notion of convergence only corresponds to the topology used in formula_8.

For example, in the Hilbert space , the sequence of functions

:formula_85

form an orthonormal basis. In particular, the (strong) limit of formula_86 as does not exist. On the other hand, by the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma, the weak limit exists and is zero.

=== Distributions ===
One normally obtains spaces of distributions by forming the strong dual of a space of test functions (such as the compactly supported smooth functions on formula_87). In an alternative construction of such spaces, one can take the weak dual of a space of test functions inside a Hilbert space such as . Thus one is led to consider the idea of a rigged Hilbert space.

=== Weak topology induced by the algebraic dual ===

Suppose that is a vector space and &quot;X&quot;# is the algebraic dual space of (i.e. the vector space of all linear functionals on ). If is endowed with the weak topology induced by &quot;X&quot;# then the continuous dual space of is , every bounded subset of is contained in a finite-dimensional vector subspace of , every vector subspace of is closed and has a topological complement.

==Operator topologies==

If and are topological vector spaces, the space of continuous linear operators may carry a variety of different possible topologies. The naming of such topologies depends on the kind of topology one is using on the target space to define operator convergence . There are, in general, a vast array of possible operator topologies on , whose naming is not entirely intuitive.

For example, the strong operator topology on is the topology of &quot;pointwise convergence&quot;. For instance, if is a normed space, then this topology is defined by the seminorms indexed by :

:formula_88

More generally, if a family of seminorms &quot;Q&quot; defines the topology on , then the seminorms on defining the strong topology are given by

:formula_89

indexed by and .

In particular, see the weak operator topology and weak* operator topology.

<doc id="33670" wikidata="Q496381" url="?curid=33670" title="Waterloo, Iowa">
<text>Waterloo is a city in and the county seat of Black Hawk County, Iowa, United States. As of the 2020 United States census the population was 67,314, making it the eighth-most populous city in the state.

Waterloo comprises a twin conurbation with neighbor municipality Cedar Falls. Waterloo is part of the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area, and is the more populous of the two cities.

==History==

Waterloo was originally known as Prairie Rapids Crossing. The town was established near two Meskwaki American tribal seasonal camps alongside the Cedar River. It was first settled in 1845 when George and Mary Melrose Hanna and their children arrived on the east bank of the Red Cedar River (now just called the Cedar River). They were followed by the Virden and Mullan families in 1846. Evidence of these earliest families can still be found in the street names Hanna Boulevard, Mullan Avenue and Virden Creek.

On December 8, 1845, the &quot;Iowa State Register and Waterloo Herald&quot; was the first newspaper published in Waterloo.

The name Waterloo supplanted the original name, Prairie Rapids Crossing, shortly after Charles Mullan petitioned for a post office in the town. Since the signed petition did not include the name of the proposed post office location, Mullan was charged with selecting the name when he submitted the petition. Tradition has it that as he flipped through a list of other post offices in the United States, he came upon the name Waterloo. The name struck his fancy, and a post office was established under that name. There were two extended periods of rapid growth over the next 115 years. From 1895 to 1915, the population increased from 8,490 to 33,097, a 290% increase. From 1925 to 1960, population increased from 36,771 to 71,755. The 1895 to 1915 period was a time of rapid growth in manufacturing, rail transportation and wholesale operations. During this period the Waterloo Gasoline Traction Engine Company moved to Waterloo and, shortly after, the Rath Packing Company moved from Dubuque. Another major employer throughout the first two-thirds of the 20th century was the Illinois Central Railroad. Among the others was the less-successful brass era automobile manufacturer, the Maytag-Mason Motor Company.

On June 7, 1934, bank robber Tommy Carroll had a shootout with the FBI when he and his wife stopped to pick up gas. Accidentally parking next to a police car and wasting time dropping his gun and picking it back up, Carroll was forced to flee into an alley, where he was shot. He was taken to Allen Memorial Hospital in Waterloo, where he soon died.

Waterloo suffered in the agricultural recession of the 1980s; its major employers at the time were heavily rooted in agriculture. John Deere, the area&#x27;s largest employer, cut 10,000 jobs, and the Rath meatpacking plant closed altogether, losing 2,500 jobs. It is estimated that Waterloo lost 14% of its population during this time. Today the city enjoys a broader industrial base, as city leaders have sought to diversify its industrial and commercial mix. Deere remains a strong presence in the city, but employs only roughly one-third the number of people it did at its peak.

=== African American community ===
In 1910, black railroad workers were brought in as strikebreakers to the Waterloo area. Black workers were relegated to 20 square blocks in Waterloo, an area that remains the east side to this day. In 1940, more black strikebreakers were brought in to work in the Rath meat plant. In 1948, a black strikebreaker killed a white union member. Instead of a race riot, a strike ensued against the Rath Company. The National Guard was called in to end the 73-day strike.

==== Civil rights ====
United Packinghouse Workers of America became the main union of the Rath Company, welcoming black workers, but United Auto Workers Local 838 continued to refuse black members. With the power of the union, Anna Mae Weems, Ada Treadwell, Charles Pearson and Jimmy Porter formed an anti-discrimination department at Rath by the 1950s. This department helped organize protests against local places that discriminated against blacks.

Porter would go on to organize the first black radio station in Waterloo, KBBG, in 1978. Weems became the head of the anti-discrimination department and local NAACP chapter.

On May 31, 1966, Eddie Wallace Sallis was found dead in the local jail. The black community felt the death was suspicious, and protests were held. On June 4, Weems led a march on city hall to encourage investigation into his death. The march led to the creation of the Waterloo Human Rights Commission, which lasted only a year due to lack of funding.

On Sept. 7, 1967, a city report, &quot;Waterloo&#x27;s Unfinished Business&quot;, was released. The report covered the ongoing problems in housing, education and employment faced by Waterloo&#x27;s black community. It confirmed the housing bias faced by black residents, that many of the schools were generally 80% of one race, and that 80% of black residents held service jobs. In a 2007 article, the Courier covered some changes in the 40 years since, finding that housing was now mostly divided by socioeconomic status, schools still violated the desegregation plan, and black unemployment was still double that of white residents.

The Iowa Supreme Court outlawed school segregation in 1868. A 1967 commission found most schools were still segregated and recommended immediate desegregation, which Mayor Lloyd Turner opposed. In 1969, the Waterloo school board voted to allow open enrollment in all their schools to encourage integration. Many parents felt it was not enough. Despite the efforts between 1967 and 1970, already-black schools in the area increased in their segregation.

==== Protests and riots ====
By the 1960s, Rath was declining and jobs there were harder to come by. A federal government program trained 1,200 local youths with the promise of summer jobs, only to hire two as bricklayers. Starting in the summer months of 1966, Waterloo was subject to riots over race relations between the white community and the black community. Many white residents expressed confusion as to why riots were occurring in Waterloo, while younger black residents felt they were being treated unfairly, as their conditions seemed worse than those of their white neighbors. In 1967, the black population of Waterloo was equivalent to 8%, and according to the Courier, had a 4% unemployment rate. Waterloo was segregated at the time, as 95% of its black population lived in &quot;East&quot; Waterloo. While the white community felt East High was integrated with a 45% black student body, the black community pointed out that the elementary school in East Waterloo had only one white pupil.

Protests were mostly organized by black youths aged 16–25. Protests became riots when the youth felt protesting wasn&#x27;t effective. Protests turned into riots in July 1968 and reached a critical mass by September, with buildings on East 4th street torched and vandalized.

In August 1968, East High students Terri and Kathy Pearson gave the principal a list of grievances detailing how they felt the discrimination could be lessened. The principal refused to implement any of the requested changes. Student protests and walkouts continued through September. Students were angry that no African American history course was being taught, and that interracial dating was discouraged by teachers and administrators.

On September 13, 1968, during an East High School football game, police attempted to arrest a black youth. He resisted arrest, drawing attention of students in the stands. Black students fought and argued with the police, and police responded by using clubs and mace. The riot continued into the east side of Waterloo, with a subsequent fire that claimed a lumber mill and three homes. There was an attempt to set East High on fire as well. The riot lasted until midnight and resulted in seven officers injured and thirteen youths jailed. The National Guard was called in the following day. The riots were called off and a solution was reached thanks to civil rights leader William G Parker.

==== 21st century ====
In 2003, Governor Tom Vilsack created a task force to close the racial achievement gap in Waterloo. In 2009, a fair housing report, &quot;Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice&quot;, compiled by Mullin &amp; Lonergan Associates Inc., found Waterloo to be Iowa&#x27;s most segregated city. &quot;Historical patterns of racial segregation persist in Waterloo. Of the 20 cities in Iowa with populations exceeding 25,000, Waterloo ranks as the most segregated&quot;.

Many activists who participated in the original protests feel that Waterloo has remained the same. In 2015, The Huffington Post listed Waterloo as the 10th worst city for black Americans. The site noted that the city&#x27;s black residents have a 24% unemployment rate compared to 3.9% for whites, giving Waterloo one of the highest black unemployment rates among Midwest cities. Waterloo still has a higher percentage of blacks than most Iowa cities.

In December 2012, Derrick Ambrose Jr. was shot by a police officer. Ambrose&#x27;s family maintains he was unarmed, while the officer stated that he felt his life was in danger. A grand jury acquitted the officer. The shooting sparked outrage in the community.

===== Flood of 2008 =====

<doc id="33671" wikidata="Q57461" url="?curid=33671" title="Wilhelm Gustloff">
<text>Wilhelm Gustloff (30 January 1895 – 4 February 1936) was a German politician and meteorologist who founded the Swiss branch of the Nazi Party/Foreign Organization (NSDAP/AO) at Davos in 1932. The NSDAP/AO was formed as the wing of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) for German citizens living outside Germany. Gustloff continued to lead the Swiss branch of the NSDAP/AO until 1936, when he was assassinated by David Frankfurter, a Croatian Jew angered by the growth of the NSDAP. After killing Gustloff, Frankfurter immediately surrendered to the authorities and confessed to the Swiss police that &quot;I fired the shots because I am a Jew.&quot;

==Life and assassination==

Gustloff was a son of merchant Herrmann Gustloff and his wife. After his education, he worked for the Swiss government as a meteorologist, and joined the NSDAP in 1927. He assisted in the distribution of the antisemitic propaganda book &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; (1903). Members of the Swiss Jewish community sued the book&#x27;s distributor, the Swiss NSDAP/AO, for libel.

Gustloff was shot and killed in Davos in 1936 by David Frankfurter, a Yugoslav Jewish student (from what is now Croatia), who was incensed by the growth of the NSDAP and resolved to assassinate Gustloff. 

Frankfurter found Gustloff&#x27;s address, which was listed in the phone book. On 4 February, he went to the Gustloff home; Gustloff&#x27;s wife Hedwig received him and showed him into the study, asking him to wait since her husband was on the telephone.

When Gustloff, who was in the adjoining room, entered his office where Frankfurter was sitting opposite a picture of Adolf Hitler, the young man pulled out his revolver and shot Gustloff five times: in the head, neck and chest. He left the premises and prepared to commit suicide. However, he was unable to follow through.

Frankfurter surrendered immediately to the Swiss police, confessing &quot;I fired the shots because I am a Jew&quot;. Unlike Maurice Conradi, who killed a Soviet diplomat in Lausanne in 1923 with similar political motives, he was convicted and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment.

He was incarcerated during the war years in a Swiss prison. On May 17, 1945 — shortly after V-E Day — Frankfurter was pardoned by a Swiss court.

==Aftermath==

Gustloff was given a state funeral in his birthplace of Schwerin in Mecklenburg, with Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Göring, Heinrich Himmler, Martin Bormann and Joachim von Ribbentrop in attendance. Thousands of Hitler Youth members lined the route. His coffin, transported on a special train from Davos to Schwerin, made stops in Stuttgart, Würzburg, Erfurt, Halle, Magdeburg and Wittenberg. Gustloff&#x27;s widow, mother and brother attended the funeral and received personal condolences from Hitler. Ernst Wilhelm Bohle was the first at Gustloff&#x27;s funeral to recite a few lines in his honour.

Gustloff was proclaimed a &quot;Blutzeuge&quot; of the Nazi cause. His murder became part of the propaganda that served as pretext for the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom. His wife Hedwig, who had been Hitler&#x27;s secretary, received from Hitler personally a monthly &quot;honorary pay&quot; of , the equivalent of some US$13,000 today.

Unlike the assassination of the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by Herschel Grynszpan in Paris in 1938, Gustloff&#x27;s death was not immediately politicized to incite &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;. Hitler did not want to risk any domestic bouts of antisemitism to cause Germany to lose the recently awarded right to host the 1936 Summer Olympics. His antisemitic policies had already led to some calls to relocate the games. Nevertheless, an editorial on the front page of &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; demanded Frankfurter&#x27;s execution.

===Namesakes===

The German cruise ship MV &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; was named for Gustloff by the Nazi regime. The ship was sunk by the Soviet submarine &quot;S-13&quot; on 30 January 1945 (coincidentally the 50th anniversary of her namesake&#x27;s birth) in the Baltic Sea while carrying civilian refugees and military personnel fleeing from the advancing Red Army. About 9,400 people died, the greatest death toll from the sinking of a single vessel in human history. The disaster remains relatively unknown.

In 1933 the Nazi Party created the &quot;Wilhelm-Gustloff-Stiftung&quot; (&quot;The Wilhelm Gustloff Foundation&quot;), a national corporation funded by properties and wealth confiscated from Jews. It ran the &quot;Gustloff Werke&quot; (&quot;Gustloff Factories&quot;), a group of businesses that had been confiscated from their Jewish owners or partners.

The small arms factory Berlin Suhler Waffen und Fahrzeugwerke was renamed Wilhelm Gustloff Werke in Gustloff&#x27;s honour in 1939.

The Commanders have played more than 1,300 games and have won more than 600. Washington was among the first NFL franchises with a fight song, &quot;Hail to the Commanders&quot;, which is played by their marching band after every home game touchdown. The Commanders are owned by a group managed by investor Josh Harris, who acquired the franchise from Daniel Snyder in 2023 for $6.05 billion.

The Commanders were founded by George Preston Marshall as the Boston Braves in 1932. The team changed its name to the Redskins the following year before moving to Washington, D.C., to become the Washington Redskins in 1937. The usage of the term &quot;redskin&quot; was controversial for decades. In 2020, pressure from several NFL and team sponsors led to its being retired as part of a wave of name changes in the wake of the George Floyd protests, which led to larger awareness of the Native American mascot controversy. The team played as the Washington Football Team for two seasons before rebranding as the Commanders in 2022.

Washington won the 1937 and 1942 NFL championship games and Super Bowls XVII, XXII, and XXVI. Washington has finished a season as league runner-up six times, losing the 1936, 1940, 1943, and 1945 title games and Super Bowls VII and XVIII. Washington has 26 playoff appearances and 14 division titles, with their three Super Bowl wins tied with the Denver Broncos and Las Vegas Raiders, behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots (six each), San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys (five each), and Green Bay Packers, New York Giants and Kansas City Chiefs (four each).

All of Washington&#x27;s championships were attained during two 10-year spans. From 1936 to 1945, the team went to the NFL Championship six times, winning two of them under general manager Jack Espey and head coach Ray Flaherty. The second period lasted from 1982 to 1991 when they won three of the four Super Bowls they appeared in, under owner Jack Kent Cooke, general managers Bobby Beathard and Charley Casserly, and head coach Joe Gibbs. From 1946 to 1970, Washington posted just four winning seasons and never reached the playoffs. They went without a single winning season from 1956 to 1968, a span that included their worst regular season record: in 1961. Another period following their last Super Bowl victory in 1991 saw only four NFC East division titles and three playoff wins until 2024.

==History==
===George Preston Marshall era (1932–1965)===

Boston was awarded a National Football League franchise on July 9, 1932, under the ownership of American businessman George Preston Marshall. The team was named after the Boston Braves baseball team, with whom they shared Braves Field, with the inaugural season being coached by Lud Wray. The team saw several changes in 1933, including a name change to the &quot;Redskins&quot; and playing their home games at Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox. Wray was also replaced at head coach by William &quot;Lone Star&quot; Dietz.

The situation faced by Marshall in New England was difficult. In 1935, Joe F. Carr opined: &quot;To the casual observer bred in the knowledge of New England&#x27;s place in football&#x27;s sun, because its cradle and nursery were there, the success of a Boston team in the professional ranks would be a foregone conclusion. Nothing could have been more erroneous. Boston finished the most forbidding ground for professional football of any large city in the country. The history of the game in Boston and New England was entirely associated with college, preparatory, and high school playing. Its eminence as an institution of sport grew in a hallowed atmosphere as an almost sacrosanct element of education which was to be kept ever free from commercial pollution.&quot;

The Redskins appeared in the 1936 NFL Championship Game, their first championship appearance, but lost to the Green Bay Packers 21–6. The Redskins moved to Washington, D.C., after five years in Boston, with Marshall stating that the New England city showed a lack of interest in the team. Through 1960, the team shared baseball&#x27;s Griffith Stadium with the first American League Washington Senators baseball team. In their first game in Washington, D.C., the Redskins defeated the New York Giants in the season opener. The same season, they earned their first division title in Washington with a win over the Giants. Shortly after, the team won their first championship by defeating the Chicago Bears in the 1937 NFL Championship Game.

In 1940, the Redskins met the Bears again in the 1940 NFL Championship Game. The result, in favor of the Bears, remains the worst one-sided loss in NFL history. The Redskins won their second championship in 1942, defeating the Bears In 1943, Dutch Bergman was named head coach and led the team to a return to the NFL championship game, however they were defeated by the Chicago Bears That same season, Sammy Baugh led the NFL in passing, punting, and interceptions.

The Redskins played in the NFL Championship one more time before a quarter-century drought that lasted until the 1972 season. With former Olympic gold medalist Dudley DeGroot as their new head coach, the Redskins went during the 1945 season. One of the most impressive performances came from Baugh, who had a completion percentage of 70.3. They ended the season by losing to the Cleveland Rams in the 1945 NFL Championship Game, 15–14. The one-point margin of victory came under scrutiny because of a safety that occurred early in the game. In the first quarter, the Redskins had the ball at their own 5-yard line. Dropping back into the end zone, quarterback Baugh threw to an open receiver, but the ball hit the goal post and bounced back to the ground in the end zone. Under the rules at the time, this was ruled as a safety and thus gave the Rams a 2–0 lead. Marshall was so upset at the outcome that he became a major force in passing a major rule change after the season, in which a forward pass that struck the goalpost was automatically ruled incomplete. This later became known as the &quot;Baugh/Marshall Rule&quot;.

The Redskins had four different head coaches from 1946 to 1951, including former players Turk Edwards and Dick Todd as well as John Whelchel and Herman Ball. But this did not stop Marshall from trying to make the Redskins the most successful franchise in the league. His first major alteration happened on June 14, 1950, when it was announced that the American Oil Company planned to televise all Redskins games, making them the first NFL team to have an entire season of televised games. His next major change came in February 1952, when he hired former Green Bay Packers coach Earl &quot;Curly&quot; Lambeau. But, after two seasons, Marshall fired Lambeau following the Redskins loss in their exhibition opener to the Los Angeles Rams and hired Joe Kuharich. In 1955, Kuharich led the Redskins to their first winning season in ten years and was named both Sporting News Coach of the Year and UPI NFL Coach of the Year.

In 1961, the Redskins moved into their new stadium called D.C. Stadium, later renamed Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in 1969. The first game in new D.C. Stadium occurred on October 1 in front of 37,767 fans. However, the Redskins failed to hold a 14-point lead and lost to the New York Giants That same year, Bill McPeak became the head coach and had a record of over five seasons. During his tenure, he helped draft future stars: wide receiver Charley Taylor, tight end Jerry Smith, safety Paul Krause, center Len Hauss, and linebacker Chris Hanburger. He also helped pull off two important trades, gaining quarterback Sonny Jurgensen from the Philadelphia Eagles and linebacker Sam Huff from the New York Giants. In 1966, Otto Graham was hired as the new head coach. Graham coached the Redskins for three seasons for a record of . He resigned after the 1968 season, with the team hiring former Green Bay Packers head coach Vince Lombardi for the same role.

====Integration controversy====

During most of this unsuccessful period, Marshall continually refused to integrate the team, despite pressure from the U.S. government. Two months into the Kennedy administration on March 24, 1961, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall warned Marshall to hire black players or face federal retribution. For the first time in history, the federal government had attempted to desegregate a professional sports team. The Redskins were under the threat of civil rights legal action by the Kennedy administration, which would have prevented a segregated team from playing at the new federally-owned D.C. Stadium, managed by the U.S. Department of the Interior. The Redskins&#x27; previous venue, Griffith Stadium, was owned by the Griffith family, owners of the Washington Senators, who moved and became the Minnesota Twins in 1961.

In 1962, Washington became the final professional American football franchise to integrate. First, the Redskins selected running back Ernie Davis of Syracuse first overall in the 1962 NFL draft; Davis was the first black player to win the Heisman Trophy and the first to be the top selection in an NFL draft. Washington also took fullback Ron Hatcher of Michigan State in the eighth round, who became the first black player to sign a contract with the team.

In December 1961, Marshall announced he had traded the rights to Davis to the Cleveland Browns, who wanted Davis to join the league&#x27;s leading rusher, Jim Brown, in their backfield. Davis was traded for veteran running back Bobby Mitchell, who became a wide receiver in Washington, D.C., and 1962 first-round draft choice Leroy Jackson of Western Illinois. The move was made under unfortunate circumstances – as it turned out that Davis had leukemia, and died without ever playing a down in professional football. The Redskins ended the 1962 season with their best record in five years: . Mitchell led the league with 11 touchdowns, and caught 72 passes and was selected to the Pro Bowl. In time, Mitchell would be joined by other black players like receiver Charley Taylor, running back Larry Brown, defensive back Brig Owens, and guard John Nisby.

=== Edward Bennett Williams era (1965–1979) ===
Marshall appointed board member Edward Bennett Williams to run the team&#x27;s daily operations in 1965 due to declining health. He acquired controlling interest in the franchise following Marshall&#x27;s death on August 9, 1969. In 1969, Williams hired former Green Bay Packers head coach Vince Lombardi for the same role, granting him a 5% stake in ownership and full control over football operations as the team&#x27;s executive vice president. Lombardi coached the Redskins to a 7–5–2 record, their first winning season since 1955, but died from cancer shortly before the start of the 1970 season. Bill Austin, appointed earlier by Lombardi, served as interim head coach for the season.

==== George Allen years (1971–1977) ====

On January 6, 1971, Williams hired former Los Angeles Rams head coach George Allen as head coach and general manager. Partial to seasoned veterans instead of highly touted young players, Allen&#x27;s teams became known as the Over-the-Hill Gang. That season, the Redskins made the playoffs for the first time since 1945 with a 9–4–1 mark with Redskins first-year head coach George Allen winning the 1971 NFL Coach of the Year award, the second of his career, having won his first Coach of the Year award in 1967 as the head coach of the Rams. However, they lost in the Divisional Playoffs to the San Francisco 49ers, 24–20.

The following season, the Redskins hosted their first postseason game in Washington since 1942, where they beat the Green Bay Packers 16–3 in the NFC Divisional Playoffs. The Redskins reached the NFC Championship Game, and in a much-anticipated match-up against the archrival Dallas Cowboys, The Redskins placekicker Curt Knight kicked an 18-yard field goal in the second quarter to get the scoring underway, then Redskins quarterback Billy Kilmer connected with Redskins wide receiver Charley Taylor on a 15-yard touchdown pass and Washington had a 10–3 lead at halftime. In the fourth quarter, Kilmer again went to Taylor, this time for a 45-yard touchdown. Knight added three more field goals that period and The Over-The-Hill-Gang defense allowed only a second-quarter field goal. The final score was Washington 26, Dallas 3. After defeating the Dallas Cowboys to win the NFC Championship, the Redskins went on to lose to the undefeated Miami Dolphins 14–7 in Super Bowl VII. Redskins running back Larry Brown would be named the 1972 NFL MVP. The Redskins again made the playoffs in 1973, 1974, and 1976, only to lose all three times in the first round. After the team failed to make the playoffs in Redskins despite a record, Allen was fired and was replaced at head coach by Jack Pardee.

=== Jack Kent Cooke era (1979–1998) ===
Canadian-American businessman Jack Kent Cooke, who had owned minority shares of the Redskins and been a board member since 1960, purchased majority interest from Edward Bennett Williams in 1974. Due to NFL rules at the time disallowing controlling ownership in other leagues, he allowed Williams to operate the team until selling his other properties, the NBA&#x27;s Los Angeles Lakers and the NHL&#x27;s Los Angeles Kings, to Jerry Buss in May 1979. Cooke became the team&#x27;s sole owner in 1985 after purchasing the remaining shares from Williams for around $9 million.

==== Joe Gibbs years (1981–1992) ====

Jack Pardee, the 1979 NFL Coach of the Year, was fired following a record in 1980. On January 13, 1981, Cooke hired San Diego Chargers offensive coordinator Joe Gibbs as head coach. During the offseason, the Redskins acquired players such as Mark May, Russ Grimm, and Dexter Manley in the 1981 NFL draft. After starting the 1981 season , the Redskins won eight out of their next 11 games and finished the season but fourth in the NFC East.

===== Super Bowl XVII champions (1982) =====
Starting on September 21, 1982, the NFL faced a 57-day long players&#x27; strike, which reduced the 1982 season from a 16-game schedule to a nine-game schedule. Because of the shortened season, the NFL adopted a special 16-team playoff tournament, in which eight teams from each conference were seeded 1–8 based on their regular season records. After the strike was settled, the Redskins dominated, winning six out of the seven remaining games to make the playoffs for the first time since 1976.

In January 1983, during the second round of the playoffs against the Minnesota Vikings, John Riggins rushed for franchise playoff record 185 yards, leading Washington to a 21–7 win. The game is perhaps best known for a moment when the stadium physically shook as a crowd chanted &quot;We Want Dallas!&quot;, which later became a rallying cry of sorts for Redskin fans before games against the Cowboys. In the NFC Championship Game against them at RFK Stadium, Redskins defensive end Dexter Manley knocked Cowboys&#x27; quarterback Danny White out for the rest of the game and sent him into the locker room shortly before halftime. Later in the game, Redskins defensive tackle Darryl Grant&#x27;s interception, which he returned for a 10-yard touchdown, off one of Cowboys&#x27; backup quarterback Gary Hogeboom&#x27;s passes which was tipped by Dexter Manley to score the decisive points. John Riggins rushed for 140 yards and two touchdowns on 36 carries and the Redskins went on to defeat the Cowboys&#x27; by a score of 31–17. The Redskins&#x27; first Super Bowl win, and their first NFL Championship in 40 years, was in Super Bowl XVII, where the Redskins defeated the Miami Dolphins 27–17. Riggins provided the game&#x27;s signature play when, on 4th and inches, with the Redskins down 17–13, the coaches called &quot;70 Chip&quot;, a play designed for short yardage. Riggins instead gained by running through would-be tackler Don McNeal and getting the go-ahead touchdown. The Redskins ended up winning by a 27–17 score with John Riggins winning the Super Bowl MVP.

After the 1982 season Redskins placekicker Mark Moseley was the first and only placekicker in NFL history to be named the NFL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player; Moseley made 20 of 21 field goals attempted in 1982. Redskins head coach Joe Gibbs also won his first NFL Coach of the Year award in 1982, which was the first of his back-to-back NFL Coach of the Year awards, his second coming in the 1983 NFL season.

Cornerback Darrell Green and defensive end Charles Mann were selected in the 1983 NFL draft and became key contributors for the team; Green would play his entire 20-year career with the Redskins. On October 1, 1983, the Redskins lost to the Green Bay Packers 48–47 in the highest-scoring Monday night football game in history, in which both teams combine for more than of total offense. Then during the regular-season finale on December 17, 1983, Moseley set an NFL scoring record with 161 points while Riggins&#x27; total of 144 points was second. This marked the first time since 1951 that the top two scorers in a season played on the same team. They dominated the NFL with a 14-win season which included scoring a then NFL record 541 points, many of which came from Riggins, who scored 24 touchdowns. Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann would also be named the 1983 NFL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player finishing the season with a career-high in both yards passing 3,714 yds., and touchdown passes thrown, 29 Td&#x27;s while throwing only 11 interceptions. In the postseason, the Redskins beat the Los Angeles Rams 51–7. The next week, Washington beat the San Francisco 49ers 24–21 in the NFC Championship Game. It was their final win of the season because two weeks later, the Raiders beat the Redskins 38–9 in Super Bowl XVIII.

The Redskins finished the 1984 season with an record, and won the NFC East for the third consecutive season. However, they lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Chicago Bears, 23–19. On November 18, 1985, while playing against the Giants, Theismann broke his leg during a sack by Lawrence Taylor. The compound fracture forced him to retire after a 12-year career, during which he became the Redskins&#x27; all-time leader in pass attempts and completions. The Redskins finished 3rd in the NFC East behind the Cowboys and missed the wild card to the Giants by virtue of tiebreakers.

The 1986 offseason&#x27;s major highlight occurred during the 1986 NFL draft, when the Redskins picked up future Super Bowl MVP Mark Rypien in the sixth round, also the Redskins defensive end Dexter Manley set a franchise single-season record when he recorded 18.5 sacks while earning All-Pro honors. In 1986 season, the Redskins making the postseason as a wild-card team despite having a regular-season record of . They won the Wild Card playoff against the Rams, and then again in the Divisional playoffs against the Bears. This game was Gibbs&#x27;s 70th career, which made him the winningest head coach in Redskins history. The season ended next week, however, when the Redskins lost to the eventual Super Bowl XXI Champion Giants 17–0 in the NFC Championship game.

===== Super Bowl XXII champions (1987) =====

The 1987 NFL season began with a players&#x27; strike that reduced the 16-game season to 15. No Redskins players crossed the picket line—the only such team—and the games for Weeks 4–6 were won with all-replacement squads. Those three victories, often credited with getting the team into the playoffs, are the basis for the 2000 movie &quot;The Replacements&quot;. The Redskins won their second championship in Super Bowl XXII on January 31, 1988, in San Diego, California. The Redskins routed the Denver Broncos 42–10 after starting the game down 10–0, the largest come-from-behind victory in Super Bowl history, which was tied by the New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV and the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX. This game is also noted for Super Bowl MVP quarterback Doug Williams, who threw four touchdowns in the second quarter en route to becoming the first black quarterback to lead his team to a championship, and for rookie running back Timmy Smith, who ran for a Super Bowl-record .

In 1988, the team missed the playoffs with a record. The 1989 Redskins finished with a record but missed the playoffs. The team is best remembered for &quot;The Posse&quot;—Art Monk, Gary Clark, and Ricky Sanders—the first trio of NFL wide receivers to post more than 1,000 yards apiece in a single season. Also, Redskins head coach Joe Gibbs achieved his 100th career victory in a week-14 win against the San Diego Chargers. The Redskins returned to the playoffs in 1990 as a Wild Card team, but lost in the Divisional round to the 49ers.

===== Super Bowl XXVI champions (1991) =====
The 1991 season started with a franchise-record 11 straight wins. &quot;The Hogs&quot;, under the coaching of Redskins offensive line coach Joe Bugel, allowed a franchise-record nine sacks, the third-lowest total in NFL history. The offense also dominated under head football coach Joe Gibbs, scoring 485 points, more than any other team that year. The defense was also dominant under defensive coordinator Richie Petitbon, giving up 224 total points, second-best of any team that year, while holding opponents scoreless three times. After posting a record, the Redskins dominated the playoffs, beating the Falcons and Lions by a combined score of 64–17. On January 26, 1992, the Redskins won Super Bowl XXVI by defeating the Buffalo Bills 37–24; QB Mark Rypien won the Super Bowl MVP award. After the Super Bowl, the Redskins set another franchise record by sending eight players to the Pro Bowl. The 1991 Washington Redskins are widely considered one of the best teams in NFL history.

In 1992, the Redskins reached the playoffs as a wild-card team, but lost in the Divisional playoffs to the 49ers, 20–13. On October 12, 1992, Art Monk became the NFL&#x27;s all-time leading pass receiver by catching his 820th career reception against the Denver Broncos on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. The era ended on March 5, 1993, when Gibbs retired after 12 years of coaching with the Redskins. Gibbs later founded Joe Gibbs Racing.

After the end of Gibbs&#x27; first tenure, the Redskins hired former Redskins player Richie Petitbon for the 1993 season. However, his first and only year as head coach, the Redskins finished with a record of . Petitbon was fired at the end of the season and on February 2, 1994, Norv Turner was hired as head coach after being the offensive coordinator of the Dallas Cowboys. 1994 was even worse as they finished , their worst season in over 30 years. Their sole bright spot that year came on October 9, 1994, linebacker Monte Coleman played in his 206th career game with the Redskins, which broke Art Monk&#x27;s team record for games played (Coleman retired at season&#x27;s end with 216 games played). They improved to in 1995 where they were able to get a season sweep on the eventual Super Bowl XXX Champions the Dallas Cowboys. On March 13, 1996, Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke, Maryland Governor Parris Glendening, and Prince George&#x27;s County Executive Wayne K. Curry signed a contract that paved the way for the immediate start of construction for the new home of the Redskins (now Northwest Stadium). The 1996 season saw Washington post their first winning record in 4 years by finishing . On December 22, 1996, the Redskins played their final game at RFK Stadium, a victory over the Dallas Cowboys 37–10, and finished their tenure at the stadium with a record, including in the playoffs.

On April 6, 1997, Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke died of congestive heart failure at the age of 84. In his will, Cooke left the Redskins to the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, with instructions to sell the team. In the meantime, management of the team was given to son and executive vice president John Kent Cooke. On September 14, 1997, the Redskins played in their new stadium for the first time and beat the Arizona Cardinals, 19–13 in overtime. On November 23, 1997, they played the New York Giants and the result was a 7–7 tie, the Redskins first tie game since the 1971 season. They would finish 1997 and would miss the playoffs for the fifth season in a row. Cornerback Darrell Green would break Monte Coleman&#x27;s record for games played with the team during the season. The 1998 season started with a seven-game losing streak, and the Redskins finished with a record.

===Daniel Snyder era (1999–2023)===

On May 25, 1999, Cooke sold the Redskins to local businessman Daniel Snyder for $800 million after being unable to raise sufficient funds to keep the team. Snyder sold the naming rights to Jack Kent Cooke Stadium to FedEx in November 1999, becoming FedExField.

In Snyder&#x27;s first season as owner, the Redskins went , including a four-game winning streak early in the season, and made it to the playoffs for the first time in Norv Turner&#x27;s career (and the first time for the Redskins since 1992) in the final game of the season (on January 2, 2000, against the Dolphins). Running back Stephen Davis rushed for a then franchise record 1,405 yards and quarterback Brad Johnson completed a then franchise record 316 passes and threw for more than 4,000 yards in regular play that season. They then defeated the Detroit Lions in the first round of the playoffs, but lost to the Buccaneers, 14–13.

The 2000 season started with the selection of future Pro Bowler Chris Samuels and the tumultuous LaVar Arrington in the 2000 NFL draft and included five consecutive wins in the first half of the season. However, they ended up going with Turner being fired as head coach prior to the end of the season. Terry Robiskie was named interim coach to finish out the season, which ended with an record. During the final game of the season, Larry Centers became the NFL&#x27;s all-time leader in receptions by a running back with 685.

On January 3, 2001, the Redskins hired former Cleveland Browns and Kansas City Chiefs head coach Marty Schottenheimer for the same role. The 2001 season began with a loss to the San Diego Chargers, 30–3, two days before the September 11, 2001, attacks. On September 13, 2001, the Redskins announced the establishment of the Redskins Relief Fund to help families of the victims of the attack at the Pentagon. During the course of the season, the Redskins raised more than $700,000. They finished the season with an record and Schottenheimer was fired after the final game. Snyder later said in a 2013 interview that he was fired due to his over-controlling nature.

On January 14, 2002, Snyder hired Florida Gators coach Steve Spurrier, the Redskins&#x27; fifth head coach in 10 years. They finished with a record, their first losing season in four years. A bittersweet moment during the season occurred on December 29, when Darrell Green concluded his 20th and final season as the Redskins defeated the Cowboys 20–14 at FedExField. During his 20 seasons, he set an NFL record for consecutive seasons with at least one interception (19) and a Redskins team record for regular-season games played (295) and started (258). The Redskins finished the 2003 season with a record, their worst since 1994. After two mediocre years, Spurrier resigned after the 2003 season with three years left on his contract.

For the 2004 season, Snyder hired former coach Joe Gibbs to return as head coach and team president. Gibbs&#x27; return to the franchise did not pay instant dividends as the Redskins finished the 2004 season with a record of . Despite an impressive defense, the team struggled offensively. Quarterback Mark Brunell—an off-season acquisition from the Jacksonville Jaguars—struggled in his first season, and was replaced midway through the season by backup Patrick Ramsey. On the other hand, some of Gibbs&#x27; other new signings, such as cornerback Shawn Springs and linebacker Marcus Washington, did very well. The Redskins also selected Sean Taylor during the first draft in Gibbs&#x27; return.

The 2005 season started with three wins, including a win on September 19 against the Dallas Cowboys. Dallas led 13–0 with less than four minutes left when Brunell threw a touchdown pass to Moss on a fourth-down play. Then, with 2:44 left, Brunell connected with Moss again on a touchdown pass and Nick Novak kicked the game-winning extra point. It was the Redskins&#x27; first victory at Texas Stadium since 1995. They then fell into a slump, losing six of the next eight games which included three straight losses in November, and their playoff chances looked bleak. On December 18, 2005, the Redskins beat Cowboys, 35–7, which marked the first time since 1995 that the Redskins swept the season series with Dallas. The Redskins clinched their first playoff berth since 1999. The game also culminated impressive season performances by individuals. Portis set a team mark for most rushing yards in a single season with , and Moss set a team record for most receiving yards in a single season with , breaking Bobby Mitchell&#x27;s previous record set in 1963. Also, Chris Cooley&#x27;s 71 receptions broke Jerry Smith&#x27;s season record for a Redskins tight end. In the first round of the playoffs, the Redskins met the Buccaneers. The Redskins won 17–10, after taking an early 14–0 lead, which they thought they lost until replay showed that a touchdown, which would have tied the game, was an incomplete pass. In that game, the Redskins broke the record for fewest offensive yards (120) gained in a playoff victory, with one of their two touchdowns being from a defensive run after a fumble recovery. The following weekend, they played the Seahawks, who defeated the Redskins 20–10, ending their hopes of reaching their first NFC Championship Game since 1991.

The first major move of the 2006 off-season was the hiring of Kansas City Chiefs&#x27; offensive coordinator Al Saunders as offensive coordinator. Gibbs also added former Buffalo Bills defensive coordinator Jerry Gray to his staff as secondary/cornerbacks coach and lost quarterbacks coach Bill Musgrave to the Falcons. The Redskins also picked up future starters Rocky McIntosh, Anthony Montgomery, Reed Doughty, and Kedric Golston in the 2006 NFL draft. After winning only three of the first nine games, Gibbs benched quarterback Brunell for former first-round draft pick Jason Campbell. After losing his first game as a starter to Tampa Bay, Campbell got his first NFL victory against the Carolina Panthers, bringing the Redskins out of a three-game losing streak. The highlight of the season happened on November 5, and concluded with one of the most exciting endings in the history of the Cowboys–Redskins rivalry. Tied 19–19, Troy Vincent blocked a last-second field goal attempt by Dallas that would have given them the win. Sean Taylor picked up the ball and ran , breaking tackles along the way. It was thought that the game would then go in overtime, however because of a defensive face mask penalty, the Redskins would get an untimed down. Novak kicked a field goal, giving Washington a 22–19 victory. However, the Redskins finished the year with a record, which resulted in them being last in the NFC East. This marked the second losing season of Joe Gibbs&#x27; second term as head coach with the Redskins, compared to the one losing season he had in his first 12-year tenure as head coach.

The Redskins began the 2007 season by &quot;winning ugly&quot; starting the season off 2–0. The Redskins kept winning and losing close games, the only exception to this a 34–3 rout of the Detroit Lions. The Redskins continued to win ugly and lose ugly to be 5–3 at the halfway mark. However, the Redskins would begin to collapse. The team lost their next three games to fall to 5–6. On Monday, November 26, Redskins safety Sean Taylor was shot by home intruders early in the morning in his Miami home. The next morning, Taylor died from severe blood loss. However, the Redskins rebounded to finish 9–7 and clinch the final playoff spot in the NFC. Washington trailed 13–0 entering the 4th quarter to the Seattle Seahawks in the wild-card round, but rallied to take a 14–13 lead, but Redskins kicker Shaun Suisham missed a field goal later in the game, and the Seahawks scored on the next drive and converted the two-point conversion. To close the game, Todd Collins threw two interceptions, each returned for a touchdown, and the Redskins fell 35–14.

After Joe Gibbs announced his retirement following the 2007 season, Jim Zorn was hired as head coach and brought in a West Coast Offense. The 2008 season started well, as the Redskins started the season 6–2. Furthermore, Redskins RB Clinton Portis led the NFL in rushing yards. However, things turned for the worse in early November, when they were routed 23–6 by the Pittsburgh Steelers and Portis&#x27; injuries finally caught up to him. The Redskins continued to struggle, falling all the way to 7–7, with their only win during that six-week period being a 3-point victory of the then-2–8 Seattle Seahawks. The Redskins managed to upset the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 16, but were eliminated from playoff contention. The team&#x27;s fortunes continued to slide in 2009, as they finished . Zorn was fired and replaced by Mike Shanahan after the season.

On April 4, the Redskins acquired quarterback Donovan McNabb in a trade from the rival Philadelphia Eagles. However, the Redskins struggled to a finish, once again 4th place in the division. The McNabb era came to an abrupt end when he was traded to Minnesota in August 2011. After cutting the injury-rattled Clinton Portis, the Redskins had no important offensive players left except for Santana Moss. Mike Shanahan surprised most observers by his decision to name John Beck, an obscure free-agent quarterback, as the starter. However, Shanahan suddenly reversed direction by naming veteran backup Rex Grossman to the starting position. In Week 1, Grossman threw for 305 yards and two touchdown passes as the Redskins crushed the Giants 28–14, ending a six-game losing streak against that team. The Washington Redskins started the season 2–0, but then struggled to a finish, however, they managed to win both meetings over the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants.

In 2012, the Redskins traded several high draft picks to the St. Louis Rams in order to take Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III second overall in the 2012 NFL draft. Although the need for a franchise quarterback was obvious, many journalists had doubts about the value of giving up a lot for a single player. In the opening game of the season, Griffin threw for 320 yards and two touchdown passes in a 40–32 victory over the New Orleans Saints to give the team its highest-scoring game since 2005. The Redskins struggled to a 3–6 start, but in Week 11, the Redskins would host the struggling Philadelphia Eagles. Griffin would have one of the best games of his career to date, as the Redskins won 31–6 with long touchdowns to Santana Moss and Aldrick Robinson. The Redskins would win their next 6 games after that, including the crucial final game of the season against the Cowboys, which would clinch the division for and send the Redskins to the playoffs. The Redskins hosted the Seattle Seahawks in the Wild Card round but lost 24–14.

Hopes were high for a repeat division title in 2013. However, these hopes were in vain, as poor play and controversy stirred during the entire year, leading to a record. Even though most players had a down year compared to 2012, Pierre Garçon had his greatest season statistically yet. Garcon broke Art Monk&#x27;s 29-year-old franchise record for catches in a single season. Garcon had 113 catches total, which broke Monk&#x27;s 106 catches in 1984 by seven. The Redskins fired Shanahan and most of his staff after the season.

====Jay Gruden era (2014–2019)====
On January 9, 2014, the Redskins hired Jay Gruden as their head coach. Gruden became the eighth head coach of the team since Daniel Snyder purchased the franchise in 1999. The Redskins struggled throughout the season, having three different quarterbacks start games, amounting to a record. Defensive coordinator Jim Haslett was fired at the end of the season.

In 2015, the Redskins hired Scot McCloughan to be their general manager, with Bruce Allen serving as team president. In October 2015, the Redskins had their largest comeback win in franchise history, coming back to win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31–30 after being down 0–24 in the second quarter. The Redskins clinched the NFC East division title on December 26, when they beat the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 16, 38–24. The division title was their third since Snyder took over ownership of the team, and was the first since the 1999 season to be clinched before Week 17. The Redskins hosted the Green Bay Packers in the Wild Card round on January 10, 2016, but lost 35–18, ending their 2015 season. Kirk Cousins, who took over as starting quarterback in the preseason, finished the season with career highs in touchdowns (29), yards (4,166), and completion percentage (69.8%). His completion percentage led the league, while his 29 touchdowns tied him for second on the franchise single-season list.

The team&#x27;s offense in 2016 set several franchise records, including having over 6,000 total net yards, which was only the third time in franchise history the team had accomplished that. Quarterback Kirk Cousins also set single-season team records in attempts, completions, and passing yards, breaking many of his records he had previously set in 2015. DeSean Jackson, Pierre Garçon, Jamison Crowder, Robert Kelley, Chris Thompson, Jordan Reed, Vernon Davis, and Matt Jones all finished the season with at least 500 yards from scrimmage, tying the 2011 New Orleans Saints for the most in a single season in NFL history. Despite the numerous records set, the Redskins missed the playoffs, losing 19–10 in a &quot;win and in&quot; situation against the New York Giants in the final week of the season. However, the Redskins still finished the season with a record of , giving the team their first consecutive winning seasons in nearly 20 years. In contrast with the record setting offense, the team&#x27;s defense had a poor season, finishing 29 out of 32 teams in total defense, which led to the firing of defensive coordinator Joe Barry, as well as three of his assistants. In 2017, Cousins had his third straight season with 4,000 passing yards while once again playing under the franchise tag. For the second straight season, the Redskins missed the playoffs, finishing 7–9.

During the 2018 offseason, the Redskins traded for quarterback Alex Smith to replace Kirk Cousins as he left for the Minnesota Vikings in free agency. Despite early success starting the season 6–3, their best start since 2008, the team finished the season due to injuries. In a game against the Houston Texans on November 18, 2018, Smith suffered a compound and spiral fracture to his tibia and fibula in his right leg when he was sacked by Kareem Jackson and J. J. Watt which forced him to miss the rest of the season. This led to Colt McCoy, Mark Sanchez, and Josh Johnson starting games in the second half of the season. The team finished at and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year, with a league-high 25 players on injured reserve.

Due to Smith&#x27;s injury, the Redskins acquired Case Keenum from the Denver Broncos in the 2019 offseason, and drafted Dwayne Haskins from Ohio State in the 2019 NFL draft. With a league worst 0–5 start to the season, tying with the Cincinnati Bengals, and their worst start since 2001, the Redskins fired Gruden on October 7, 2019, with offensive line coach Bill Callahan serving as the interim head coach for the rest of the season. Gruden finished as the longest-tenured head coach in the Snyder era with six seasons, a 35–49–1 regular season record and one playoff appearance. The Redskins finished the season at , with victories over the Detroit Lions and Carolina Panthers, and missed the playoffs for the fourth straight year. The record matched their worst since 2013 and was the second worst of any team that season.

==== Rebranding, investigations into Snyder and workplace culture (2020–2023) ====
The team underwent several changes in 2020, including retiring the Redskins name and logo and hiring former Carolina Panthers head coach Ron Rivera in the same role, as well as naming Jason Wright as team president, the first black person named to that position in NFL history. Some notable members of Rivera&#x27;s staff include former Jacksonville Jaguars and Oakland Raiders head coach Jack Del Rio as defensive coordinator and Scott Turner, the son of former Redskins head coach Norv Turner, as offensive coordinator.

Under Rivera and Del Rio, the team switched their defensive scheme from a 3–4 defense, which the team had used under both Shanahan and Gruden&#x27;s tenure, to a 4–3 defense. Due to their record the previous season, the team held the second overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft and selected Chase Young, who would go on to be named Defensive Rookie of the Year. Dwayne Haskins, the team&#x27;s first-round draft pick from 2019, was released prior to the season&#x27;s end due to ineffective play and not meeting the team&#x27;s standards off the field. Despite that, Washington would eventually win the division for the first time since 2015 at 7–9, becoming only the third team in NFL history to win a division with a losing record in a non-strike year after the 2010 Seattle Seahawks and 2014 Carolina Panthers, the latter of which Rivera also coached.

In July 2021, a year-long independent investigation led by lawyer Beth Wilkinson into the team&#x27;s workplace culture under owner Daniel Snyder was concluded. It found that several incidents of sexual harassment, bullying, and intimidation were commonplace throughout the organization under his ownership. The NFL fined the team $10 million in response, with Snyder also voluntarily stepping down from running the team&#x27;s day-to-day operations, giving those responsibilities to his wife and team CEO Tanya. A U.S. House Oversight Committee report later corroborated the claims and accused him of withholding security deposit from season ticket holders.

The 2021 season saw the hiring of Martin Mayhew as general manager and Marty Hurney as another high-ranking executive. With the hiring of Mayhew, Washington became the first team in NFL history to concurrently have a minority general manager, head coach, and president. Backup quarterback Taylor Heinicke would start the majority of the season after Ryan Fitzpatrick was injured in the opening game. The team missed the playoffs with a record. The Football Team rebranded as the Commanders in 2022 with new logos and uniforms. The team traded for Colts quarterback Carson Wentz in the offseason, with them finishing and becoming the first team since 2008 to finish last in the division with a non-losing record. Wentz, who was benched for Henicke during the season, would be released with Heinicke not being retained. The season would also be the final one under Snyder&#x27;s ownership.

=== Josh Harris era (2023–present) ===
In November 2022, Snyder hired BofA Securities after mounting pressure from other NFL owners to sell the team to explore possible transactions. In May 2023, he reached an agreement to sell the franchise to a group headed by Josh Harris, co-founder of Apollo Global Management and owner of the NBA&#x27;s Philadelphia 76ers and NHL&#x27;s New Jersey Devils, for $6.05 billion. Key limited partners include Danaher and Glenstone founder Mitchell Rales, Hall of Fame basketball player Magic Johnson, and venture captilalist Mark Ein. The sale, the highest price ever paid for a sports team, was approved by the NFL on July 20, 2023. By 2024, the team had invested $75 million in improving the infrastructure and game experience of Northwest Stadium, including improved food options and renovations to the sound system and suites.

The Commanders finished the 2023 season with a record, allowing the most points and having the worst point differential in the league. Second-year quarterback Sam Howell, who started all 17 games, also led the league in sacks allowed (65) and interceptions thrown (21). It was their seventh straight non-winning season and third straight being eliminated from the playoffs, with the team also going winless in the division for the first time since 2019. Head coach Ron Rivera and his staff were fired following the season&#x27;s conclusion. The 2024 season saw the hiring of Adam Peters as general manager and former Falcons head coach Dan Quinn for the same role. The front office and roster saw several changes under Peters, including signing around 30 free agents and selecting 2023 Heisman quarterback Jayden Daniels second overall in the 2024 NFL draft. Led by Daniels, the 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year, the Commanders went , won a playoff game for the first time since 2005, and made the NFC Championship Game for the first time since 1991.

==Logos and uniforms==
The franchise&#x27;s primary colors are burgundy and gold. From 1961 through 1978, Washington wore gold pants with both the burgundy and white jerseys, although details of the jerseys and pants changed a few times during this period. Gold face masks were introduced in 1978 and remain as such to this day; previous to that they were grey. Throughout most of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, Washington was just one of three other teams that primarily wore their white jerseys at home (the others being the Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins). The tradition of wearing white jerseys over burgundy pants at home, which is considered the &quot;classic&quot; look, was started by Joe Gibbs when he took over as coach in 1981. Gibbs was an assistant for the San Diego Chargers in 1979 and 1980 when the team wore white at home under head coach Don Coryell.

Their burgundy jerseys were primarily used only when the opposing team decided to wear white at home, which came mostly against the Dallas Cowboys and was normally worn over white pants. It was worn on the road against other teams that prefer to wear white at home for games occurring early in the season. From 1981 through 2000, Washington wore their white jerseys over burgundy pants at home almost exclusively. In 1994, as part of a league-wide celebration of the NFL&#x27;s 75th anniversary, during certain games, the team wore special uniforms which emulated the uniforms worn by the team in its inaugural season in Washington in 1937. Both worn over gold pants, the burgundy jerseys featured gold numbers bordered in white and the white jerseys featured burgundy numbers bordered in gold. The most distinctive feature of both colors of the jersey was the patches worn on both sleeves, which were a reproduction of the patches worn on the full-length sleeves of the 1937 jerseys. Worn with these uniforms was a plain burgundy helmet with a gold facemask.

In 2001, the team wore burgundy for all home games in the preseason and regular season per a decision by Marty Schottenheimer, their coach for that year. In 2002, the team celebrated the passing of 70 years since its creation as the Boston Braves in 1932 and wore a special home uniform, a burgundy jersey over gold pants, which roughly resembled the home uniforms used from 1969 to 1978. The helmets used with this special home uniform during that year were a reproduction of the helmets used by the team from 1965 to 1969, though they wore white at home in Week 1 against the Arizona Cardinals and again in Week 17, the latter forcing the Cowboys to use their blue jerseys. This special home uniform was also worn during one game in 2003. In 2004, when Gibbs became the coach of the team once again, the team switched back to wearing white jerseys at home; in Gibbs&#x27;s 16 years as head coach, the team never wore burgundy jerseys at home, even wearing a white throwback jersey in 2007.

Their white jerseys have provided three basic color combinations. The last combination consists of both white jerseys and pants. That particular combination surfaced in the first game of the 2003 season when the team was coached by Steve Spurrier, during a nationally televised game against the New York Jets, which led many sports fans and Redskins faithful alike to point out that they had never seen that particular combination before. The Redskins won six straight games, including one in the playoffs against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, wearing that combination. In the NFC Divisional Playoff game against the eventual 2005 NFC Champion Seattle Seahawks, Washington wore the all-white uniforms in hopes that they could keep their streak going; however, they lost 20–10. The white jersey over burgundy pants look reappeared in a home game against the Carolina Panthers later in 2006.

In celebration of the franchise&#x27;s 75th anniversary, Washington wore a one-time throwback uniform for a home game against the New York Giants, based on their away uniform from 1970 to 1971. Players wore a white jersey with three burgundy and two gold stripes on each sleeve and the 75th-anniversary logo on the left chest. The pants were gold, with one white stripe bordered by a burgundy stripe on each side, running down each side. The helmet was gold-colored with a burgundy &quot;R&quot; logo. The helmet and uniform styles were the same as the ones the franchise used during the 1970–71 seasons. Vince Lombardi, who coached Washington in 1969 before dying during the 1970 preseason, was the inspiration behind the helmet. Lombardi pushed for the logo, which sat inside a white circle enclosed within a burgundy circle border, with Native American feathers hanging down from the side because of its similarity to the &quot;G&quot; on the helmets worn by the Green Bay Packers, who he had coached during most of the 1960s.

In a 2008 &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Washington wore a monochrome look by wearing burgundy jerseys over burgundy pants. This combination made two further appearances the following season against the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants. The Redskins, starting in 2010, began to wear the burgundy jersey paired with the gold pants reminiscent of the George Allen era. Against the Tennessee Titans later that season, the team matched the gold pants with the usual white jerseys for the first time. Washington wore the same combination against the Giants on the road two weeks later.

In 2011, the Redskins wore the burgundy jersey and gold pants for five home games and a road game at Dallas, the burgundy jersey with white pants for three home games and a road game at Miami, the white jersey and burgundy pants for five road games, and the white jersey and gold pants for a Bills game in Toronto. The following year, the team wore an updated throwback uniform of the 1937 championship team that featured a helmet pattern based on the logo-less leather helmets worn at the time, in a game against the Carolina Panthers. In 2013, a newly implemented NFL rule stated that teams could not wear alternate helmets (thus limiting them to one helmet) on account of player safety. As a result, Washington wore its 1937 throwbacks with the logo removed from the regular helmet in a game versus the San Diego Chargers. That year, the Redskins removed the burgundy collar from their white jerseys in order to have better consistency with the new Nike uniforms that had debuted the previous season.

Between 2014 and 2016, the team wore the gold pants with their standard uniforms, although the burgundy pants returned as part of the team&#x27;s away uniform later in 2016. In 2017, Washington resurrected the all-burgundy ensemble as part of the NFL Color Rush. Nike initially provided an all-gold uniform but team officials called it &quot;garish&quot; and refused to wear it. In 2018, Washington replaced the gold pants with white for the majority of their home games.

During their two season as the Washington Football Team in 2020 and 2021, their logo was a simple &quot;W&quot; with the helmets having player numbers. The Commanders rebranding included new logos and uniforms featuring military-inspired motifs. The primary home uniform remained burgundy with gold and white stripes with the letters having a gold base. The team name is placed atop the numbers in front, which were also gold and trimmed in white. The road white uniform features burgundy and white gradient numbers with black trim, along with burgundy and white gradient and black sleeve stripes. Both sets are paired with either burgundy or white pants. The alternate black uniform features the team name on the left chest in gold, and numbers have a gold base with burgundy trim. Black pants are paired with this uniform with an alternate black helmet having with the &quot;W&quot; logo in front and uniform numbers on each side. A pig mascot, Major Tuddy, was also unveiled near the end of the season. In 2024, gold pants returned to the uniform rotation for the first time since 2018.

===Redskins branding controversy===

The team&#x27;s former Redskins branding, used from 1933 until 2020, was one of the leading examples of the Native American mascot controversy. Various people and groups, such as the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), considered the name a racial slur and attempted to get the team to change it for decades. In a 2013 letter, Snyder stated that while respecting those that say they were offended, a poll conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004 found that 90% of Native Americans were not. This poll was essentially replicated in 2016 by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Social scientists from the University of Michigan and University of California at Berkeley performed a study in 2020 that measured Native American opinion in detail, finding that 49% had responded that the name was offensive, with the level of offense increasing to 67% for those with a stronger involvement in Native American culture. When the franchise was undergoing a trademark dispute in 2014, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; announced their editorials would no longer use the &quot;Redskins&quot; name. ESPN updated their employee work policies to allow their reporters to choose how to refer to the team going forward.

Following renewed attention to racial justice in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and subsequent protests in 2020, a letter signed by 87 shareholders and investors was sent to team and league sponsors Nike, FedEx, and PepsiCo urging them to cut their ties unless the name was changed. Around the same time, several retail companies began removing Redskins merchandise from their stores. In response, the team underwent a review in July 2020 and announced that it would play as the Washington Football Team after retiring its name and logo in wake of the George Floyd protests.

The team rebranded as the Commanders, featuring new logos and uniforms, in 2022. In 2023, the Native American Guardians Association (NAGA) launched a petition to return to the Redskins branding; NAGA later attempted to sue the Commanders for defamation after team management claimed NAGA to be a &quot;fake&quot; association. In 2024, U.S. Senator from Montana Steve Daines advocated for the NFL to honor Blackfeet Nation member Blackie Wetzel in recognition of his role in designing the team&#x27;s former logo depicting a Native American chief based on John Two Guns White Calf, the last chief of the Blackfeet. While Daines sought to honor the legacy without calling for the return of the Redskins branding, some viewed the gesture as insufficient compared to addressing more pressing community needs. The Wetzel family stated their desire to regain the rights to the logo to use it to raise awareness about social issues on reservations. In November 2024, the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources voted 17–2 to transfer control of the RFK Stadium site to the District of Columbia. The bill&#x27;s approval came after negotiations between the team, NFL, and Daines to potentially restore the Redskins logo, with portions of merchandise proceeds going to Native American causes.

==Rivalries==
===Divisional===
====Dallas Cowboys====

The Commanders&#x27; rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys features two teams that have won 31 combined division titles and 10 championships, including eight combined Super Bowls. The rivalry started in 1960 when the Cowboys joined the league as an expansion team. During that year they were in separate conferences, but played once during the season. In 1961, Dallas was placed in the same division as the Redskins, and from that point on, they have played each other twice during every regular season.

Texas oil tycoon Clint Murchison Jr. was having a difficult time bringing an NFL team to Dallas. In 1958, Murchison heard that George Preston Marshall, owner of the Washington Redskins, was eager to sell the team. Just as the sale was about to be finalized, Marshall called for a change in terms. Murchison was outraged and canceled the whole deal. Around this time, Marshall had a falling out with the Redskin band director, Barnee Breeskin. Breeskin had written the music for the team&#x27;s fight song, now known as &quot;Hail to the Commanders&quot;, which gets played by the Washington Commanders Marching Band after every touchdown at home games. He wanted revenge after the failed negotiations with Marshall. He approached Tom Webb, Murchison&#x27;s lawyer, and sold the rights for $2,500 (). Murchison then decided to create his own team, with the support of NFL expansion committee chairman, George Halas. Halas decided to put the proposition of a Dallas franchise before the NFL owners, which needed to have unanimous approval in order to pass. The only owner against the proposal was George Preston Marshall. However, Marshall found out that Murchison owned the rights to Washington&#x27;s fight song, so a deal was finally struck. If Marshall showed his approval of the Dallas franchise, Murchison would return the song. The Cowboys were then founded and began playing in 1960. At the time in 2016, a matchup between the teams on Thanksgiving was the most-watched regular-season game broadcast by the &quot;NFL on Fox&quot;. The Cowboys lead the series .

====Philadelphia Eagles====

The Commanders&#x27; rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles began in 1934. Washington leads the series .

====New York Giants====

The Commanders&#x27; rivalry with the New York Giants began in 1932. The Giants lead the all-time series .

===Other===
==== Baltimore Ravens ====
Though the two teams only play each other every 4 years, the Commanders have taken part in a minor geographic rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens as both stadiums are approximately 40 miles apart. The Commanders particularly had long blocked the return of an NFL team to Baltimore since the Colts franchise relocated to Indianapolis in 1984. Former owner Jack Kent Cooke had been accused in multiple instances of orchestrating any means to prevent the city from receiving a new franchise until the Cleveland Browns relocated to Baltimore in 1996, prompting Cooke to put the Redskins&#x27; then-new stadium in Landover, Maryland. The two teams play each other annually during the preseason. The Ravens lead the all-time series .

==Players==
===Roster===
===Retired numbers===
Some numbers are unofficially retired and are withheld from being selected by other players.
* 7 Joe Theismann, QB, 1974–1985
* 42 Charley Taylor, WR, 1964–1977
* 43 Larry Brown, RB, 1969–1976

* 70 Sam Huff, LB, 1964–1969
* 81 Art Monk, WR, 1980–1993

The use of unofficial retired numbers drew controversy during Steve Spurrier&#x27;s first year as head coach in 2002. Quarterbacks Danny Wuerffel and Shane Matthews first wore 7 and 9 respectively during training camp. The resulting controversy led to them switching to 17 and 6. Dwayne Haskins, the team&#x27;s first-round selection in the 2019 NFL draft, received permission from Theismann to wear number 7.

===Pro Football Hall of Fame members===
Names in bold indicate induction primarily based on accomplishments with Washington.

===Ring of Fame===
When the team left RFK Stadium in 1996, the signs commemorating the Washington Hall of Stars were left behind and the team began a new tradition of honoring Redskins greats via the &quot;Ring of Fame&quot;, a set of signs on the upper level facade at Northwest Stadium. Team founder George Preston Marshall is the only member to ever be removed, which happened in 2020.

===90 Greatest===
In honor of the Redskins&#x27; 70th anniversary in 2002, a panel selected the 70 Greatest Redskins to honor the players and coaches who were significant on-field contributors to the Redskins five championships. They were honored in a weekend of festivities, including a special halftime ceremony during a Redskins&#x27; win over the Indianapolis Colts. In 2012, ten more players and personnel were added to the list for the team&#x27;s 80th anniversary. In 2022, ten more players were added in honor of the franchise&#x27;s 90th anniversary.

The panel that chose the 70 consisted of former news anchor Bernard Shaw; former player Bobby Mitchell; Senator George Allen (son of coach George Allen); broadcaster Ken Beatrice; Noel Epstein, editor for the Washington Post; former diplomat Joseph J. Sisco; Phil Hochberg, who retired in 2001 after 38 years as team stadium announcer; Pro Football Hall of Fame historian Joe Horrigan; sportscaster George Michael; sports director Andy Pollin; NFL Films president Steven Sabol; and news anchor Jim Vance.

The list includes three head coaches and 67 players, of which 41 were offensive players, 23 defensive players and three special teams players. Among the 70 Greatest, there are 92 Super Bowl appearances, with 47 going once and 45 playing in more than one. 29 members possess one Super Bowl ring and 26 have more than one. Also, before the Super Bowl, members of the 70 made 18 World Championship appearances including six that participated in the Redskins&#x27; NFL Championship victories in 1937 and 1942. Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

====Offense====

The Redskins led the league in completion percentage 11 times: in 1937, 1939–1940, 1942–45, 1947–48 and 1969–1970, second only to the San Francisco 49ers.

==Broadcasting==

The Commanders&#x27; flagship station is Big 100 (WBIG-FM), which acquired the rights in 2022 as part of an agreement with iHeartMedia. Frank Herzog served the team&#x27;s lead play-by-play announcer from 1979 until 2004, when he was replaced by Larry Michael. Herzog was joined from 1981 by former Redskins Sonny Jurgensen and Sam Huff. Michael retired in 2020 and was replaced by Bram Weinstein. Weinstein is joined by color commentators and former players London Fletcher and Logan Paulsen. Julie Donaldson served as host from 2020 to 2023 and was the first woman to be an on-air broadcaster for an NFL team.

WMAL served as the team&#x27;s flagship station from 1942 to 1956 and from 1963 through 1991. From 1992 to 1994, WTEM—which had become DC&#x27;s first all-sports radio station—became the Redskins&#x27; flagship station after which they moved to WJFK-FM. In 2006, after WJFK and CBS Radio declined to renew its rights to the team, the Redskins moved to WWXT, WWXX, and WXTR. The stations had recently been bought by Red Zebra Broadcasting—a group co-owned by Snyder—and had become a sports radio trimulcast known as &quot;Triple X ESPN Radio&quot;. Red Zebra Broadcasting would eventually acquire WTEM in 2008, making it the originating station of the simulcast.

In 2017, Cumulus Media reached an agreement to carry the team&#x27;s radio broadcasts on WMAL, marking its return to the station for the first time since 1991. As part of the agreement, WTEM remained the team&#x27;s official flagship. In 2018, WTEM was sold to Urban One, but maintained its rights to the team. In June 2019, WMAL flipped to sports radio itself as WSBN, taking over the local ESPN Radio affiliation from WTEM; WMAL&#x27;s previous conservative talk format moved exclusively to its FM simulcast station.

Telecasts of preseason games were previously carried by NBC Sports Washington in the Mid-Atlantic region. Sister NBC owned-and-operated station WRC-TV was the team&#x27;s &quot;official&quot; broadcast television station, simulcasting the preseason games and airing other team-produced programs during the season. With the sale of NBC Sports Washington by NBCUniversal to Washington Capitals and Washington Wizards owner Ted Leonsis, the network declined to renew its rights to the team. Most regular season Commanders games are carried by &quot;NFL on Fox&quot;. In June 2024, the team and WUSA announced a partnership to broadcast the team&#x27;s preseason games as well as some original content.

==U.S. presidential election superstition==

Between 1932 and 2008, for 19 of 20 United States presidential elections, a win for the Redskins in their last home game prior to Election Day coincided with the incumbent party winning re-election. The exception was in 2004, when Republican incumbent George W. Bush won re-election despite the Green Bay Packers beating the Redskins. The trend subsequently came to an end when in 2012, Democratic incumbent Barack Obama won re-election despite the Redskins losing to the Carolina Panthers. It has since been wrong for the elections in 2016, 2020, and 2024.

<doc id="33683" wikidata="Q239062" url="?curid=33683" title="Winnie Madikizela-Mandela">
<text>Winnie Nomzamo Madikizela-Mandela (born Nomzamo Winifred Zanyiwe Madikizela; 26 September 1936 – 2 April 2018), also known as Winnie Mandela, was a South African anti-apartheid activist and the second wife of Nelson Mandela. A convicted kidnapper, she served as a Member of Parliament from 1994 to 2003, and from 2009 until her death, and was a deputy minister of arts and culture from 1994 to 1996. A member of the African National Congress (ANC) political party, she served on the ANC&#x27;s National Executive Committee and headed its Women&#x27;s League. Madikizela-Mandela was known to her supporters as the &quot;Mother of the Nation&quot;.

Born to a Xhosa royal family in Bizana, and a qualified social worker, she married anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg in 1958; they remained married for 38 years and had two children together. In 1963, after Mandela was imprisoned following the Rivonia Trial, she became his public face during the 27 years he spent in jail. During that period, she rose to prominence within the domestic anti-apartheid movement. Madikizela-Mandela was detained by apartheid state security services on various occasions, tortured, subjected to banning orders, and banished to a rural town, and she spent several months in solitary confinement.

In the mid-1980s, Madikizela-Mandela exerted a &quot;reign of terror&quot;, and was &quot;at the centre of an orgy of violence&quot; in Soweto, which led to condemnation by the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, and a rebuke by the ANC in exile. During this period, her home was burned down by residents of Soweto. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) established by Nelson Mandela&#x27;s government to investigate human rights abuses found Madikizela-Mandela to have been &quot;politically and morally accountable for the gross violations of human rights committed by the Mandela United Football Club&quot;, her security detail. Madikizela-Mandela endorsed the necklacing of alleged police informers and apartheid government collaborators, and her security detail carried out kidnapping, torture, and murder, most notoriously the killing of 14-year-old Stompie Seipei whose kidnapping she was convicted of.

Nelson Mandela was released from prison on 11 February 1990, and the couple separated in 1992; their divorce was finalised in March 1996. She visited him during his final illness. As a senior ANC figure, she took part in the post-apartheid ANC government, although she was dismissed from her post amid allegations of corruption. In 2003, Madikizela-Mandela was convicted of theft and fraud, and she temporarily withdrew from active politics before returning several years later. Her biography &quot;Winnie Mandela: A life was&quot; written by Anné Mariè du Preez Bezdrob and published in 2003

==Early life and education==
Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s Xhosa name was Nomzamo. She was born in the village of Mbhongweni,
Bizana, Pondoland, in what is now the Eastern Cape province. She was the fifth of nine children, seven sisters and a brother. Her parents, Columbus and Gertrude, who had a white father and Xhosa mother, were both teachers. Columbus was a history teacher and a headmaster, and Gertrude was a domestic science teacher. Madikizela-Mandela went on to become the head girl at her high school in Bizana.

Upon leaving school, she went to Johannesburg to study social work at the Jan Hofmeyr School of Social Work. She earned a degree in social work in 1956, and decades later earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in international relations from the University of the Witwatersrand.

She held a number of jobs in various parts of what was then the Bantustan of Transkei; including with the Transkei government, living at various points of time at Bizana, Shawbury and Johannesburg. Her first job was as a social worker at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto.

==Marriage to Nelson Mandela==

Madikizela met lawyer and anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela in 1957, when he was still married to Evelyn Mase. She was 22 years old and standing at a bus stop in Soweto when Mandela first saw her and charmed her, securing a lunch date the following week. The couple married in 1958 and had two daughters, Zenani (born 1959) and Zindziswa (born 1960). Mandela was arrested and jailed in 1963 and was not released until 1990.

The couple separated in 1992. They finalised their divorce in March 1996 with an unspecified out-of-court settlement. During the divorce hearing, Nelson Mandela rejected Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s assertion that arbitration could salvage the marriage, and cited her infidelity as a cause of the divorce, saying &quot;... I am determined to get rid of the marriage&quot;. Her attempt to obtain a settlement up to US $5million (R70 million) – half of what she claimed her ex-husband was worth – was dismissed when she failed to appear in court for a settlement hearing.

When asked in a 1994 interview about the possibility of reconciliation, she said: &quot;I am not fighting to be the country&#x27;s First Lady. In fact, I am not the sort of person to carry beautiful flowers and be an ornament to everyone.&quot;

Madikizela-Mandela was involved in a lawsuit at the time of her death, claiming that she was entitled to Mandela&#x27;s homestead in Qunu, through customary law, despite her divorce from Nelson Mandela in 1996. Her case was dismissed by the Mthatha High Court in 2016, and she was reportedly preparing to appeal to the Constitutional Court at the time of her death, after failing at the Supreme Court of Appeal in January 2018.

==Apartheid: 1963–1985==
Winnie Mandela emerged as a leading opponent of apartheid during the latter part of her husband&#x27;s imprisonment. Due to her political activities, she was regularly detained by the National Party government. She was subjected to house arrest, kept under surveillance, imprisoned, and banished to the remote town of Brandfort.

Her longest jailing was for 491 days (as noted in her account &quot;491 Days: Prisoner Number 1323/69&quot;), beginning on 12 May 1969, at Pretoria Central Prison, where she spent months in solitary confinement, and was tortured and beaten. By her own account, her experience in prison &quot;hardened&quot; her.

From 1977 to 1985, she was banished to the town of Brandfort in the Orange Free State and confined to the area. It was at this time that she became well known in the Western world. She organised a creche with a non-governmental organization, Operation Hunger and a clinic in Brandfort with Dr Abu Baker Asvat, her personal physician, campaigned actively for equal rights and was promoted by the ANC as a symbol of their struggle against apartheid. While in exile in Brandfort, she, and those who attempted to assist her, were harassed by the apartheid police.

In a leaked letter to Jacob Zuma in October 2008, outgoing President of South Africa Thabo Mbeki alluded to the role the ANC had created for Nelson and Winnie Mandela, as representative symbols of the brutality of apartheid: In the context of the global struggle for the release of political prisoners in our country, our movement took a deliberate decision to profile Nelson Mandela as the representative personality of these prisoners, and therefore to use his personal political biography, including the persecution of his wife, Winnie Mandela, dramatically to present to the world and the South African community the brutality of the apartheid system.

Beaten by the apartheid police, she developed an addiction to painkillers and alcohol as a result of a back injury caused by the assault.

==Violence and criminal proceedings==
During a speech in Munsieville on 13 April 1986, Madikizela-Mandela endorsed the practice of necklacing (burning people alive using rubber tyres filled with petrol) by saying: &quot;With our boxes of matches and our necklaces we shall liberate this country.&quot; Further tarnishing her reputation were accusations by her bodyguard, Jerry Musivuzi Richardson, and others, at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, that she had ordered kidnapping and murder during the second half of the 1980s.

===Return to Soweto and Mandela United Football Club: 1986–1989===
Madikizela-Mandela returned to Soweto from Brandfort in late 1985, in defiance of a banning order. During her banishment, the United Democratic Front (UDF) and Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) had formed a mass-movement against apartheid. The new organisations relied more heavily on collective decision-making structures, rather than on individual charisma. She took a more militaristic approach, eschewing the approach of the newer bodies, and began dressing in military garb, and surrounding herself with bodyguards: the Mandela United Football Club (MUFC). Living in Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s home, the putative &quot;soccer team&quot; began hearing family disputes and delivering &quot;judgments&quot; and &quot;sentences&quot;, and eventually became associated with kidnapping, torture and murder. She was implicated in at least 15 deaths during this time period.

In 1988, Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s home was burned by high school students in Soweto, in retaliation for the actions of the Mandela United Football Club. By 1989, after appeals from local residents, and after the Seipei kidnapping, the UDF (in the guise of the &quot;Mass Democratic Movement&quot;, or MDM), &quot;disowned&quot; her for &quot;violating human rights ... in the name of the struggle against apartheid&quot;. The ANC in exile issued a statement criticising her judgment after she refused to heed instructions issued from prison by Nelson Mandela to dissociate herself from the Football Club and after attempts at mediation by an ANC crisis committee failed.

====Lolo Sono and Siboniso Shabalala====
In November 1988, 21-year-old Lolo Sono, and his 19-year-old friend Siboniso Shabalala, disappeared in Soweto. Sono&#x27;s father said he saw his son in a kombi with Madikizela-Mandela, and that his son had been badly beaten. Sono’s mother claimed that Madikizela-Mandela had labelled her son a spy, and had said she was &quot;taking him away&quot;. At the subsequent Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, Sono&#x27;s stepmother said, fighting back tears, &quot;I am pleading with Mrs Mandela today, in front of the whole world, that please, Mrs Mandela, give us our son back. Even if Lolo is dead, let Mrs Mandela give us the remains of our son, so that we must bury him decently. Then after, maybe, we can rest assured knowing that Lolo is buried here.&quot; Sono and Shabalala&#x27;s bodies were exhumed from pauper&#x27;s graves in Soweto&#x27;s Avalon Cemetery in 2013, by the National Prosecuting Authority&#x27;s Missing People&#x27;s Task Team, having been stabbed soon after their abductions.

====Seipei and Asvat killings====

On 29 December 1988, Jerry Richardson, who was &quot;coach&quot; of the Mandela United Football Club, abducted 14-year-old James Seipei (also known as Stompie Moeketsi) and three other youths from the home of Methodist minister Paul Verryn, with Richardson claiming that Madikizela-Mandela had the youths taken to her home because she suspected the minister was sexually abusing them (allegations that were baseless). The four were beaten to get them to admit to having had sex with the minister. Negotiations that lasted 10 days, by senior ANC and community leaders to get the kidnapped boys released by Madikizela-Mandela failed. Seipei was accused of being an informer, and his body later found in a field with stab wounds to the throat on 6 January 1989.

In 1991, Mrs Mandela was acquitted of all but the kidnapping of Seipei. A key witness, Katiza Cebekhulu, who was going to testify that Madikizela-Mandela had killed Sepei, had been tortured and kidnapped to Zambia by her supporters prior to the trial, to prevent him testifying against her. Her six-year jail sentence was reduced to a fine on appeal.

In 1992, she was accused of ordering the murder of Abu Baker Asvat, a family friend and prominent Soweto doctor, who had examined Seipei at Mandela&#x27;s house, after Seipei had been abducted but before he had been killed. Mandela&#x27;s role in the Asvat killing was later probed as part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings in 1997. Asvat&#x27;s murderer testified that she paid the equivalent of $8,000 and supplied the firearm used in the killing, which took place on 27 January 1989. The hearings were later adjourned amid claims that witnesses were being intimidated on Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s orders.

In a 2017 documentary about the life and activism of Madikizela-Mandela, former Soweto police officer Henk Heslinga alleged that former safety minister Sydney Mufamadi had instructed him to re-open the investigation into the death of Seipei, as well as all other cases made against Madikizela-Mandela, for the purpose of charging Winnie with murder. According to Heslinga, Richardson admitted during an interview that Seipei discovered he was an informant, and that he killed the child to cover his tracks. However, at a press conference a few days after Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s funeral, Mufamadi denied the allegations in the documentary, stating that Helsinga&#x27;s statements were false. The documentary had previously been described by in a review by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; as &quot;unabashedly one-sided&quot; and &quot;overwhelmingly defensive&quot;. Commentator Max du Preez, called the decision by television station eNCA to broadcast the documentary in the week prior to Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s funeral without context a &quot;serious mistake&quot;, and he described it as making &quot;outrageous claims&quot;, while former TRC commissioner Dumisa Ntsebeza questioned the motives of the documentary maker.

In January 2018, ANC MP Mandla, Nelson Mandela&#x27;s grandson by his first wife, Evelyn Mase, called for Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s role in the Asvat and Seipei murders to be probed. In October 2018 a new biography of Madikizela-Mandela concluded that she had been responsible for the murder of Asvat.

In April 2018, Joyce Seipei, the mother of Stompie Seipei, told media that she did not believe that Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was involved in her son’s murder. In a subsequent interview with UK paper &quot;The Independent&quot;, Joyce Seipei said that she had forgiven Madikizela-Mandela, and that during the TRC hearings, Madikizela-Mandela had told her, in the context of her son Stompie&#x27;s murder: &quot;...may God forgive me&quot;. After the TRC hearings, Madikizela-Mandela had provided financial support to Joyce Sepei&#x27;s family, and Seipei&#x27;s home was furnished by the ANC.

===TRC findings===

The final report of the Truth and Reconciliation commission (TRC), issued in 1998, found &quot;Ms Winnie Madikizela Mandela politically and morally accountable for the gross violations of human rights committed by the Mandela United Football Club&quot; and that she &quot;was responsible, by omission, for the commission of gross violations of human rights.&quot; The TRC report also stated that the abduction to Zambia of the Sepei trial witness Katiza Cebekhulu, where he was detained without trial for almost 3 years by the Kenneth Kaunda government before moving to the UK, was done by the ANC and in the &quot;interests&quot; of Madikizela-Mandela. The TRC found allegations against Methodist minister Paul Verryn to be &quot;unfounded and without any merit&quot; and that &quot;Madikizela-Mandela deliberately and maliciously slandered Verryn...in an attempt to divert attention away from herself and [her] associates...&quot;. The TRC also found that she was responsible for the abduction of, and assaults on, Stompie Sepei, and that she had attempted to cover up his death by claiming he had fled to Botswana. She was found by the TRC to be responsible for the 1988 disappearance of Lolo Sono and Siboniso Shabalala.

==Transition to democracy: 1990–2003==

During South Africa&#x27;s transition to multi-racial democracy, she adopted a far less conciliatory attitude to White South Africans and was considered to be as controversial as her husband was before his arrest. She was seen on her husband&#x27;s arm when he was released in February 1990, the first time the couple had been seen in public for nearly 30 years.

Their 38-year marriage ended in April 1992 after rumours of unfaithfulness. Their divorce was finalised in March 1996. She then adopted the surname &quot;Madikizela-Mandela&quot;. Also in 1992, she lost her position as the head of the ANC social welfare department, amid allegations of corruption.

Madikizela-Mandela campaigned for the ANC in South Africa&#x27;s first non-racial elections. Appointed Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology in May 1994, she was dismissed 11 months later following allegations of corruption.

In 1995, prominent members of the ANC Women&#x27;s League, including Adelaide Tambo resigned from the National Executive Committee of that body because of disagreement with Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s leadership of the body and amid a controversy about a large donation from Pakistani politician Benazir Bhutto that was not handed over to the League by Madikizela-Mandela.

She remained extremely popular amongst many African National Congress (ANC) supporters. In December 1993 and April 1997, she was elected president of the ANC Women&#x27;s League, although she withdrew her candidacy for ANC Deputy President at the movement&#x27;s Mafikeng conference in December 1997. Earlier in 1997, she appeared before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Archbishop Desmond Tutu as chairman of the commission recognised her importance in the anti-apartheid struggle but exhorted her to apologise and to admit her mistakes. In a guarded response, she admitted &quot;things went horribly wrong&quot;.

During the 1990s, she associated with the Israeli mafia operating in South Africa, which was involved in extorting the local Jewish community, and other criminal activity.

In 2002, Madikizela-Mandela was found guilty by a Parliamentary ethics committee of failing to disclose donations and financial interests. Madikizela Mandela was often absent from Parliament, sometimes for months at a time and was ordered by Parliament to account for her absences in 2003.

== Withdrawal from politics: 2003–2007==
In 2003, Madikizela-Mandela offered to act as a human shield prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Also in 2003, she helped defuse a hostage situation at Wits University, where a student who was in arrears with fees took a staff member hostage at knifepoint.

On 24 April 2003, Madikizela-Mandela was convicted on 435 counts of fraud and 25 of theft, and her broker, Addy Moolman, was convicted on 58 counts of fraud and 25 of theft. Both had pleaded not guilty. The charges related to money taken from loan applicants&#x27; accounts for a funeral fund, but from which the applicants did not benefit. Madikizela-Mandela was sentenced to five years in prison. Shortly after the conviction, she resigned from all leadership positions in the ANC, including her parliamentary seat and the presidency of the ANC Women&#x27;s League.

In July 2004, an appeal judge of the Pretoria High Court ruled that &quot;the crimes were not committed for personal gain&quot;. The judge overturned the conviction for theft, but upheld the one for fraud, handing her a three years and six months suspended sentence.

==Return to politics==

When the ANC announced the election of its National Executive Committee on 21 December 2007, Madikizela-Mandela placed first with 2,845 votes.

Madikizela-Mandela criticised the anti-immigrant violence in May–June 2008 that began in Johannesburg and spread throughout the country and blamed the government&#x27;s lack of suitable housing provisions for the sentiments behind the riots. She apologised to the victims of the riots and visited the Alexandra township. She offered her home as shelter for an immigrant family from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She warned that the perpetrators of the violence could strike at the Gauteng train system.

Madikizela-Mandela secured fifth place on the ANC&#x27;s electoral list for the 2009 general election, behind party president Jacob Zuma, President of South Africa Kgalema Motlanthe, Deputy President Baleka Mbete, and Finance Minister Trevor Manuel. An article in &quot;The Observer&quot; suggested her position near the top of the list indicated that the party&#x27;s leadership saw her as a valuable asset in the election with regard to solidifying support among the party&#x27;s grassroots and the poor.

Madkizela-Mandela was largely sidelined by the ANC in the post-apartheid period. Despite her status as an ANC MP over much of that period, she largely associated with non-ANC figures including Bantu Holomisa and Julius Malema. Madikizela-Mandela was a political patron of Malema, who was expelled from the ANC and later formed his own party, the Economic Freedom Fighters.

===2010 interview with Nadira Naipaul===
In 2010, Madikizela-Mandela was interviewed by Nadira Naipaul. In the interview, she attacked her ex-husband, claiming that he had &quot;let blacks down&quot;, that he was only &quot;wheeled out to collect money&quot;, and that he is &quot;nothing more than a foundation&quot;. She further attacked his decision to accept the Nobel Peace Prize with F. W. de Klerk. Among other things, she reportedly claimed Mandela was no longer &quot;accessible&quot; to her daughters. She referred to Archbishop Desmond Tutu, in his capacity as the head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as a &quot;cretin&quot;.

The interview attracted media attention, and the ANC announced that it would ask her to explain her comments regarding Nelson Mandela. On 14 March 2010, a statement was issued on Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s behalf claiming that the interview was a fabrication.

==Death and funeral==

Winnie Madikizela-Mandela died at the Netcare Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg on 2 April 2018 at the age of 81. She suffered from diabetes and had recently undergone several major surgeries. She &quot;had been in and out of hospital since the start of the year&quot;.

In the lead-up to Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s funeral, in a politically fraught environment soon after the ouster of former president Jacob Zuma, Jessie Duarte, a senior ANC leader, warned critics to &quot;sit down and shut up&quot;, with Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema saying that &quot;anyone who accuses Mama Winnie of any crime is guilty of treason&quot;.

Madikizela-Mandela was granted a &quot;Special Official Funeral&quot; by the South African government. Her public funeral service was held at Orlando Stadium on 14 April 2018. Planning for Madikizela Mandela&#x27;s funeral was largely handled by her daughters and Julius Malema, and the ANC reportedly had to &quot;fight for space&quot; on the programme. At the public service, ANC and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa &quot;acknowledged&quot; that the ANC failed to stand by Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s side during her legal troubles. Julius Malema delivered an impassioned speech in which he criticised the United Democratic Front for distancing themselves from Madikizela-Mandela in the 1980s. Malema also criticised members of the National Executive Committee of the ANC Women&#x27;s League for resigning in 1995, because they regarded Madikizela-Mandela as a &quot;criminal&quot;. Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s daughter Zenani attacked those who &quot;vilified&quot; her mother, calling them hypocrites. After the public service, her body was interred at a cemetery in Fourways in the north of Johannesburg during a private memorial service.

A number of ANC figures prepared to defend themselves against the allegations made at the funeral; however, the ANC urged &quot;restraint&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Mandela was portrayed by Alfre Woodard in the 1987 HBO TV movie, &quot;Mandela&quot;. Woodard earned both a CableACE Award and an NAACP Image Award for her performance, as did costar Danny Glover, who portrayed Nelson Mandela.

Tina Lifford played her in the 1997 TV film &quot;Mandela and de Klerk&quot;. Sophie Okonedo portrayed her in the BBC drama &quot;Mrs Mandela&quot;, first broadcast on BBC Four on 25 January 2010.

Jennifer Hudson played her in &quot;Winnie Mandela&quot;, directed by Darrell Roodt, released in Canada by D Films on 16 September 2011. Roodt, Andre Pieterse, and Paul L. Johnson based the film&#x27;s script on Anne Marie du Preez Bezdrob&#x27;s biography, &quot;Winnie Mandela: A Life&quot;. The Creative Workers Union of South Africa opposed the choice of Hudson in the title role, saying the use of foreign actors to tell the country&#x27;s stories undermined efforts to develop the national film industry. Though the performances of Hudson and Terrance Howard, who portrayed Nelson Mandela, earned praise from many critics, the film was a critical and commercial failure.

In 2007, an opera based on her life called &quot;The Passion of Winnie&quot; was produced in Canada; however, she was declined a visa to attend its world premiere and associated gala fundraising concert.

Mandela was again portrayed in the 2013 film &quot;&quot; by actress Naomie Harris (British actor Idris Elba played Nelson Mandela). On viewing the film, Madikizela-Mandela told Harris it was &quot;the first time she felt her story had been captured on film&quot;. Gugulethu okaMseleku, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stated that the film had returned Madikizela-Mandela to her rightful place, recognising her role in &quot;the struggle&quot; that, &quot;for South African women ... was more fundamental than her husband&#x27;s.&quot;

==Honours and awards==
In 1985, Mandela won the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award along with fellow activists Allan Boesak and Beyers Naudé for their human rights work in South Africa. She received a Candace Award for Distinguished Service from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1988.

In January 2018, the University Council and University Senate of Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda, approved the award of an honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) degree to Winnie Nomzamo Madikizela-Mandela, in recognition of her fight against apartheid in South Africa.

In 2021, the Mbizana Local Municipality in the Eastern Cape was officially renamed the &quot;Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Local Municipality.&quot; The town of Brandfort in the Free State was also officially renamed as &quot;Winnie Mandela.&quot;

In 2022, the section of the R562 road connecting Midrand with Olifantsfontein, was renamed from &quot;Olifantsfontein Road&quot; to &quot;Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Road&quot; by the City of Ekurhuleni in Gauteng.

<text>William Butler Yeats (13 June 186528 January 1939) was an Irish poet, dramatist and writer, and one of the foremost figures of 20th-century literature. He was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival, and along with Lady Gregory founded the Abbey Theatre, serving as its chief during its early years. He was awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in Literature, and later served two terms as a Senator of the Irish Free State.

A Protestant of Anglo-Irish descent, Yeats was born in Sandymount, Ireland. His father practised law and was a successful portrait painter. He was educated in Dublin and London and spent his childhood holidays in County Sligo. He studied poetry from an early age, when he became fascinated by Irish legends and the occult. While in London he became part of the Irish literary revival. His early poetry was influenced by John Keats, William Wordsworth, William Blake and many more. These topics feature in the first phase of his work, lasting roughly from his student days at the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin until the turn of the century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced, modernist and lyrical poems display debts to Edmund Spenser, Percy Bysshe Shelley and the poets of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.

From 1900 his poetry grew more physical, realistic and politicised. He moved away from the transcendental beliefs of his youth, though he remained preoccupied with some elements including cyclical theories of life. He had become the chief playwright for the Irish Literary Theatre in 1897, and early on promoted younger poets such as Ezra Pound. His major works include &quot;The Land of Heart&#x27;s Desire&quot; (1894), &quot;Cathleen ni Houlihan&quot; (1902), &quot;Deirdre&quot; (1907), &quot;The Wild Swans at Coole&quot; (1919), &quot;The Tower&quot; (1928) and &quot;Last Poems and Plays&quot; (1940).

== Early years ==
William Butler Yeats was born in Sandymount in County Dublin, Ireland. His father John was a descendant of Jervis Yeats, a Williamite soldier, linen merchant, and well-known painter, who died in 1712. Benjamin Yeats, Jervis&#x27;s grandson and William&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, had in 1773 married Mary Butler of a landed family in County Kildare. Following their marriage, they kept the name Butler. Mary was of the Butler of Neigham Gowran family, descended from an illegitimate brother of The 8th Earl of Ormond. At the time of his marriage, his father, John, was studying law but later pursued art studies at Heatherley School of Fine Art, in London. 

William&#x27;s mother, Susan Mary Pollexfen, from Sligo, came from a wealthy merchant family, who owned a milling and shipping business. Soon after William&#x27;s birth, the family relocated to the Pollexfen home at Merville, Sligo, to stay with her extended family, and the young poet came to think of the area as his childhood and spiritual home. Its landscape became, over time, both personally and symbolically, his &quot;country of the heart&quot;. So too did its location by the sea; John Yeats stated that &quot;by marriage with a Pollexfen, we have given a tongue to the sea cliffs&quot;. 

The Butler Yeats family were highly artistic; his brother Jack became an esteemed painter, while his sisters Elizabeth and Susan Mary—known to family and friends as Lollie and Lily—became involved in the Arts and Crafts movement. Their cousin Ruth Pollexfen, who was raised by the Yeats sisters after her parents&#x27; separation, designed the interior of the Australian prime minister&#x27;s official residence.

Yeats was raised a member of the Protestant Ascendancy, which was at the time undergoing a crisis of identity. While his family was supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer R. F. Foster observed that Napoleon&#x27;s dictum that to understand the man you have to know what was happening in the world when he was twenty &quot;is manifestly true of W.B.Y.&quot; Yeats&#x27;s childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of Charles Stewart Parnell and the home rule movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Irish Catholics became prominent around the turn of the century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country&#x27;s biography.

In 1867, the family moved to England to aid their father, John, to further his career as an artist. At first, the Yeats children were educated at home. Their mother entertained them with stories and Irish folktales. John provided an erratic education in geography and chemistry and took William on natural history explorations of the nearby Slough countryside. On 26 January 1877, the young poet entered the Godolphin School, which he attended for four years. He did not distinguish himself academically, and an early school report describes his performance as &quot;only fair. Perhaps better in Latin than in any other subject. Very poor in spelling&quot;. Though he had difficulty with mathematics and languages (possibly because he was tone deaf and had dyslexia), he was fascinated by biology and zoology. In 1879 the family moved to Bedford Park taking a two-year lease at 8 Woodstock Road. For financial reasons, the family returned to Dublin toward the end of 1880, living at first in the suburbs of Harold&#x27;s Cross and later in Howth. In October 1881, Yeats resumed his education at Dublin&#x27;s Erasmus Smith High School. His father&#x27;s studio was nearby and William spent a great deal of time there, where he met many of the city&#x27;s artists and writers. During this period he started writing poetry, and, in 1885, the &quot;Dublin University Review&quot; published Yeats&#x27;s first poems, as well as an essay entitled &quot;The Poetry of Sir Samuel Ferguson&quot;. Between 1884 and 1886, William attended the Metropolitan School of Art—now the National College of Art and Design—in Thomas Street. In March 1888 the family moved to 3 Blenheim Road in Bedford Park where they would remain until 1902. The rent on the house in 1888 was £50 a year.

== Young poet ==
Yeats began writing his first works when he was seventeen; these included a poem—heavily influenced by Percy Bysshe Shelley—that describes a magician who set up a throne in central Asia. Other pieces from this period include a draft of a play about a bishop, a monk, and a woman accused of paganism by local shepherds, as well as love-poems and narrative lyrics on German knights. The early works were both conventional and, according to the critic Charles Johnston, &quot;utterly unIrish&quot;, seeming to come out of a &quot;vast murmurous gloom of dreams&quot;. Although Yeats&#x27;s early works drew heavily on Shelley, Edmund Spenser, and on the diction and colouring of pre-Raphaelite verse, he soon turned to Irish mythology and folklore and the writings of William Blake. In later life, Yeats paid tribute to Blake by describing him as one of the &quot;great artificers of God who uttered great truths to a little clan&quot;. In 1891, Yeats published &quot;John Sherman&quot; and &quot;Dhoya&quot;, one a novella, the other a story. The influence of Oscar Wilde is evident in Yeats&#x27;s theory of aesthetics, especially in his stage plays, and runs like a motif through his early works. The theory of masks, developed by Wilde in his polemic &quot;The Decay of Lying&quot; can clearly be seen in Yeats&#x27;s play &quot;The Player Queen&quot;, while the more sensual characterisation of Salomé, in Wilde&#x27;s play of the same name, provides the template for the changes Yeats made in his later plays, especially in &quot;On Baile&#x27;s Strand&quot; (1904), &quot;Deirdre&quot; (1907), and his dance play &quot;The King of the Great Clock Tower&quot; (1934).

==Mysticism and occult==

Yeats had a lifelong interest in mysticism, spiritualism, occultism and astrology. He read extensively on the subjects throughout his life, became a member of the paranormal research organisation &quot;The Ghost Club&quot; (in 1911) and was influenced by the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. In 1892 Yeats wrote: &quot;If I had not made magic my constant study I could not have written a single word of my Blake book, nor would &quot;The Countess Kathleen&quot; ever have come to exist. The mystical life is the centre of all that I do and all that I think and all that I write.&quot; His mystical interests—also inspired by a study of Hinduism, under the Theosophist Mohini Chatterjee, and the occult—formed much of the basis of his late poetry. Some critics disparaged this aspect of Yeats&#x27;s work.

During 1885, Yeats was involved in the formation of the Dublin Hermetic Order. That year the Dublin Theosophical lodge was opened in conjunction with Brahmin Mohini Chatterjee, who travelled from the Theosophical Society in London to lecture. Yeats attended his first séance the following year. 

Yeats was admitted into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in March 1890 and took the magical motto &quot;&quot;—translated as &#x27;Devil is God inverted&#x27;. He was an active recruiter for the sect&#x27;s Isis-Urania Temple, and brought in his uncle George Pollexfen, Maud Gonne, and Florence Farr. Although he reserved a distaste for abstract and dogmatic religions founded around personality cults, he was attracted to the type of people he met at the Golden Dawn. He became heavily involved with Theosophy and with the eclectic Rosicrucianism of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He was involved in the Order&#x27;s power struggles, both with Farr and Macgregor Mathers, and was involved when Mathers sent Aleister Crowley to repossess Golden Dawn paraphernalia during the &quot;Battle of Blythe Road&quot;. After the Golden Dawn ceased and splintered into various offshoots, Yeats remained with the Stella Matutina until 1921.

During séances held from 1912, a spirit calling itself &quot;Leo Africanus&quot; apparently claimed it was Yeats&#x27;s &quot;Daemon&quot; or anti-self, inspiring some of the speculations in &quot;Per Amica Silentia Lunae&quot;.

==Early poems==
Yeats first significant poem was &quot;The Island of Statues&quot;, a fantasy work that took Edmund Spenser and Shelley for its poetic models. The piece was serialized in the &quot;Dublin University Review&quot;. Yeats wished to include it in his first collection, but it was deemed too long, and in fact, was never republished in his lifetime. Quinx Books published the poem in complete form for the first time in 2014. His first solo publication was the pamphlet &quot;Mosada: A Dramatic Poem&quot; (1886), which comprised a print run of 100 copies paid for by his father. This was followed by the collection &quot;The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems&quot; (1889), which arranged a series of verse that dated as far back as the mid-1880s. The long title poem contains, in the words of his biographer R. F. Foster, &quot;obscure Gaelic names, striking repetitions [and] an unremitting rhythm subtly varied as the poem proceeded through its three sections&quot;:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;We rode in sorrow, with strong hounds three,
Bran, Sceolan, and Lomair,
On a morning misty and mild and fair.
The mist-drops hung on the fragrant trees,
And in the blossoms hung the bees.
We rode in sadness above Lough Lean,
For our best were dead on Gavra&#x27;s green.&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;The Wanderings of Oisin&quot; is based on the lyrics of the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology and displays the influence of both Sir Samuel Ferguson and the Pre-Raphaelite poets. The poem took two years to complete and was one of the few works from this period that he did not disown in his maturity. &quot;Oisin&quot; introduces what was to become one of his most important themes: the appeal of the life of contemplation over the appeal of the life of action. Following the work, Yeats never again attempted another long poem. His other early poems, which are meditations on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects, include &quot;Poems&quot; (1895), &quot;The Secret Rose&quot; (1897), and &quot;The Wind Among the Reeds&quot; (1899). The covers of these volumes were illustrated by Yeats&#x27;s friend Althea Gyles.

==Rhymers&#x27; Club==
In 1890 Yeats and Ernest Rhys co-founded the Rhymers&#x27; Club, a group of London-based poets who met regularly in a Fleet Street tavern to recite their verse. Yeats later sought to mythologize the collective, calling it the &quot;Tragic Generation&quot; in his autobiography, and published two anthologies of the Rhymers&#x27; work, the first one in 1892 and the second one in 1894. He collaborated with Edwin Ellis on the first complete edition of William Blake&#x27;s works, in the process rediscovering a forgotten poem, &quot;Vala, or, the Four Zoas&quot;.

== Maud Gonne ==
In 1889, Yeats met Maud Gonne, a 23-year-old English heiress and ardent Irish nationalist. She was eighteen months younger than Yeats and later claimed she met the poet as a &quot;paint-stained art student.&quot; Gonne admired &quot;The Island of Statues&quot; and sought out his acquaintance. Yeats began an obsessive infatuation, and she had a significant and lasting effect on his poetry and his life thereafter. In later years he admitted, &quot;it seems to me that she [Gonne] brought into my life those days—for as yet I saw only what lay upon the surface—the middle of the tint, a sound as of a Burmese gong, an over-powering tumult that had yet many pleasant secondary notes.&quot; Yeats&#x27;s love was unrequited, in part due to his reluctance to participate in her nationalist activism.

In 1891 he visited Gonne in Ireland and proposed marriage, but was rejected. He later admitted that from that point &quot;the troubling of my life began&quot;. Yeats proposed to Gonne three more times: in 1899, 1900 and 1901. She refused each proposal, and in 1903, to his dismay, married the Irish nationalist Major John MacBride. His only other love affair during this period was with Olivia Shakespear, whom he first met in 1894, and parted from in 1897.

Yeats derided MacBride in letters and in poetry. He was horrified by Gonne&#x27;s marriage, at losing his muse to another man; in addition, her conversion to Catholicism before marriage offended the Protestant/agnostic Yeats. He worried his muse would come under the influence of the priests and do their bidding.

Gonne&#x27;s marriage to MacBride was a disaster. This pleased Yeats, as Gonne began to visit him in London. After the birth of her son, Seán MacBride, in 1904, Gonne and MacBride agreed to end the marriage, although they were unable to agree on the child&#x27;s welfare. Despite the use of intermediaries, a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her husband with Yeats as her main &#x27;second&#x27;, though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted, for the only accusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage. A separation was granted, with Gonne having custody of the baby and MacBride having visiting rights. 

In 1895, Yeats moved into number 5 Woburn Walk and resided there until 1919.

Yeats&#x27;s friendship with Gonne ended, yet, in Paris in 1908, they finally consummated their relationship. &quot;The long years of fidelity rewarded at last&quot; was how another of his lovers described the event. Yeats was less sentimental and later remarked that &quot;the tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul.&quot; The relationship did not develop into a new phase after their night together, and soon afterwards Gonne wrote to the poet indicating that despite the physical consummation, they could not continue as they had been: &quot;I have prayed so hard to have all earthly desire taken from my love for you and dearest, loving you as I do, I have prayed and I am praying still that the bodily desire for me may be taken from you too.&quot; By January 1909, Gonne was sending Yeats letters praising the advantage given to artists who abstain from sex. Nearly twenty years later, Yeats recalled the night with Gonne in his poem &quot;A Man Young and Old&quot;:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;My arms are like the twisted thorn
And yet there beauty lay;
The first of all the tribe lay there
And did such pleasure take;
She who had brought great Hector down
And put all Troy to wreck.&lt;/poem&gt;

In 1896, Yeats was introduced to Lady Gregory by their mutual friend Edward Martyn. Gregory encouraged Yeats&#x27;s nationalism and convinced him to continue focusing on writing drama. Although he was influenced by French Symbolism, Yeats concentrated on an identifiably Irish content and this inclination was reinforced by his involvement with a new generation of younger and emerging Irish authors. Together with Lady Gregory, Martyn, and other writers including J. M. Synge, Seán O&#x27;Casey, and Padraic Colum, Yeats was one of those responsible for the establishment of the &quot;Irish Literary Revival&quot; movement. Apart from these creative writers, much of the impetus for the Revival came from the work of scholarly translators who were aiding in the discovery of both the ancient sagas and Ossianic poetry and the more recent folk song tradition in Irish. One of the most significant of these was Douglas Hyde, later the first President of Ireland, whose &quot;Love Songs of Connacht&quot; was widely admired.

== Abbey Theatre ==
In 1899, Yeats, Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and George Moore founded the Irish Literary Theatre to promote Irish plays. The ideals of the Abbey were derived from the avant-garde French theatre, which sought to express the &quot;ascendancy of the playwright rather than the actor-manager &quot;à l&#x27;anglais&quot;.&quot; The group&#x27;s manifesto, which Yeats wrote, declared, &quot;We hope to find in Ireland an uncorrupted &amp; imaginative audience trained to listen by its passion for oratory ... &amp; that freedom to experiment which is not found in the theatres of England, &amp; without which no new movement in art or literature can succeed.&quot; Yeats&#x27;s interest in the classics and his defiance of English censorship were also fueled by a tour of America he took between 1903 and 1904. Stopping to deliver a lecture at the University of Notre Dame, he learned about the student production of the &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;. This play was banned in England, an act he viewed as hypocritical and denounced as part of &#x27;British Puritanism&#x27;. He contrasted this with the artistic freedom of the Catholicism found at Notre Dame, which had allowed such a play with themes such as incest and parricide. He desired to stage a production of the &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; in Dublin.

The collective survived for about two years but was unsuccessful. Working with the Irish brothers with theatrical experience, William and Frank Fay, Yeats&#x27;s unpaid but independently wealthy secretary Annie Horniman, and the leading West End actress Florence Farr, the group established the Irish National Theatre Society. Along with Synge, they acquired property in Dublin and on 27 December 1904 opened the Abbey Theatre. Yeats&#x27;s play &quot;Cathleen ni Houlihan&quot; and Lady Gregory&#x27;s &quot;Spreading the News&quot; were featured on the opening night. Yeats remained involved with the Abbey until his death, both as a member of the board and a prolific playwright. In 1902, he helped set up the Dun Emer Press to publish work by writers associated with the Revival. This became the Cuala Press in 1904, and inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement, sought to &quot;find work for Irish hands in the making of beautiful things.&quot; From then until its closure in 1946, the press—which was run by the poet&#x27;s sisters—produced over 70 titles; 48 of them books by Yeats himself.

Yeats met the American poet Ezra Pound in 1909. Pound had travelled to London at least partly to meet the older man, whom he considered &quot;the only poet worthy of serious study.&quot; From 1913 until 1916, the two men wintered in the Stone Cottage at Ashdown Forest, with Pound nominally acting as Yeats&#x27;s secretary. The relationship got off to a rocky start when Pound arranged for the publication in the magazine &quot;Poetry&quot; of some of Yeats&#x27;s verse with Pound&#x27;s own unauthorised alterations. These changes reflected Pound&#x27;s distaste for Victorian prosody. A more indirect influence was the scholarship on Japanese Noh plays that Pound had obtained from Ernest Fenollosa&#x27;s widow, which provided Yeats with a model for the aristocratic drama he intended to write. The first of his plays modelled on Noh was &quot;At the Hawk&#x27;s Well&quot;, the first draft of which he dictated to Pound in January 1916.

The emergence of a nationalist revolutionary movement from the ranks of the mostly Roman Catholic lower-middle and working class made Yeats reassess some of his attitudes. In the refrain of &quot;Easter, 1916&quot; (&quot;All changed, changed utterly / A terrible beauty is born&quot;), Yeats faces his own failure to recognise the merits of the leaders of the Easter Rising, due to his attitude towards their ordinary backgrounds and lives. Yeats was close to Lady Gregory and her home place of Coole Park, County Galway. He would often visit and stay there as it was a central meeting place for people who supported the resurgence of Irish literature and cultural traditions. His poem, &quot;The Wild Swans at Coole&quot; was written there, between 1916 and 1917.

He wrote prefaces for two books of Irish mythological tales, compiled by Lady Gregory: &quot;Cuchulain of Muirthemne&quot; (1902), and &quot;Gods and Fighting Men&quot; (1904). In the preface of the latter, he wrote: &quot;One must not expect in these stories the epic lineaments, the many incidents, woven into one great event of, let us say the War for the Brown Bull of Cuailgne or that of the last gathering at Muirthemne.&quot;

== Politics ==

Yeats was an Irish nationalist, who sought a kind of traditional lifestyle articulated through poems such as &#x27;The Fisherman&#x27;. But as his life progressed, he sheltered much of his revolutionary spirit and distanced himself from the intense political landscape until 1922, when he was appointed Senator for the Irish Free State.

In the earlier part of his life, Yeats was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. In the 1930s, Yeats was fascinated with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, nationalist movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the Blueshirts, although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order and the needs of the national collective over petty individualism. He was an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order. After the Blueshirt movement began to falter in Ireland, he distanced himself somewhat from his previous views, but maintained a preference for authoritarian and nationalist leadership.

== Marriage to Georgie Hyde-Lees ==
By 1916, Yeats was 51 years old and determined to marry and produce an heir. His rival, John MacBride, had been executed for his role in the 1916 Easter Rising, so Yeats hoped that his widow, Maud Gonne, might remarry. His final proposal to Gonne took place in mid-1916. Gonne&#x27;s history of revolutionary political activism, as well as a series of personal catastrophes in the previous few years of her life—including chloroform addiction and her troubled marriage to MacBride—made her a potentially unsuitable wife; biographer R. F. Foster has observed that Yeats&#x27;s last offer was motivated more by a sense of duty than by a genuine desire to marry her.

Yeats proposed in an indifferent manner, with conditions attached, and he both expected and hoped she would turn him down. According to Foster, &quot;when he duly asked Maud to marry him and was duly refused, his thoughts shifted with surprising speed to her daughter.&quot; Iseult Gonne was Maud&#x27;s second child with Lucien Millevoye, and at the time was twenty-one years old. She had lived a sad life to this point; conceived as an attempt to reincarnate her short-lived brother, for the first few years of her life she was presented as her mother&#x27;s adopted niece. When Maud told her that she was going to marry, Iseult cried and told her mother that she hated MacBride. When Gonne took action to divorce MacBride in 1905, the court heard allegations that he had sexually assaulted Iseult, then eleven. At fifteen, she proposed to Yeats. In 1917, he proposed to Iseult but was rejected.

That September, Yeats proposed to 25-year-old Georgie Hyde-Lees (1892–1968), known as George, whom he had met through Olivia Shakespear. Despite warnings from her friends—&quot;George ... you can&#x27;t. He must be dead&quot;—Hyde-Lees accepted, and the two were married on 20 October 1917. Their marriage was a success, in spite of the age difference, and in spite of Yeats&#x27;s feelings of remorse and regret during their honeymoon. The couple went on to have two children, Anne and Michael. Although in later years he had romantic relationships with other women, Georgie herself wrote to her husband, &quot;When you are dead, people will talk about your love affairs, but I shall say nothing, for I will remember how proud you were.&quot;

During the first years of marriage, they experimented with automatic writing; she contacted a variety of spirits and guides they called &quot;Instructors&quot; while in a trance. The spirits communicated a complex and esoteric system of philosophy and history, which the couple developed into an exposition using geometrical shapes: phases, cones, and gyres. Yeats devoted much time to preparing this material for publication as &quot;A Vision&quot; (1925). In 1924, he wrote to his publisher T. Werner Laurie, admitting, &quot;I dare say I delude myself in thinking this book my book of books.&quot;

== Nobel Prize ==
In December 1923, Yeats was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his always inspired poetry, which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation&quot;. Politically aware, he knew the symbolic value of an Irish winner so soon after Ireland had gained independence, and highlighted the fact at each available opportunity. His reply to many of the letters of congratulations sent to him contained the words: &quot;I consider that this honour has come to me less as an individual than as a representative of Irish literature, it is part of Europe&#x27;s welcome to the Free State.&quot;

Yeats used the occasion of his acceptance lecture at the Royal Academy of Sweden to present himself as a standard-bearer of Irish nationalism and Irish cultural independence. As he remarked, &quot;The theatres of Dublin were empty buildings hired by the English travelling companies, and we wanted Irish plays and Irish players. When we thought of these plays we thought of everything that was romantic and poetical because the nationalism we had called up—the nationalism every generation had called up in moments of discouragement—was romantic and poetical.&quot; The prize led to a significant increase in the sales of his books, as his publishers Macmillan sought to capitalise on the publicity. For the first time he had money, and he was able to repay not only his own debts but those of his father.

== Old age ==
By early 1925, Yeats&#x27;s health had stabilised, and he had completed most of the writing for &quot;A Vision&quot;. Dated 1925, it actually appeared in January 1926, when he almost immediately started rewriting it for a second version. He had been appointed to the first Irish Senate in 1922, and was re-appointed for a second term in 1925. Early in his tenure, a debate on divorce arose, and Yeats viewed the issue as primarily a confrontation between the emerging Roman Catholic ethos and the Protestant minority. When the Roman Catholic Church weighed in with a blanket refusal to consider their anti position, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; countered that a measure to outlaw divorce would alienate Protestants and &quot;crystallise&quot; the partition of Ireland. In response, Yeats delivered a series of speeches that attacked the &quot;quixotically impressive&quot; ambitions of the government and clergy, likening their campaign tactics to those of &quot;medieval Spain.&quot; &quot;Marriage is not to us a Sacrament, but, upon the other hand, the love of a man and woman, and the inseparable physical desire, are sacred. This conviction has come to us through ancient philosophy and modern literature, and it seems to us a most sacrilegious thing to persuade two people who hate each other... to live together, and it is to us no remedy to permit them to part if neither can re-marry.&quot; The resulting debate has been described as one of Yeats&#x27;s &quot;supreme public moments&quot;, and began his ideological move away from pluralism towards religious confrontation.

His language became more forceful; the Jesuit Father Peter Finlay was described by Yeats as a man of &quot;monstrous discourtesy&quot;, and he lamented that &quot;It is one of the glories of the Church in which I was born that we have put our Bishops in their place in discussions requiring legislation.&quot; During his time in the Senate, Yeats further warned his colleagues, &quot;If you show that this country, southern Ireland, is going to be governed by Roman Catholic ideas and by Catholic ideas alone, you will never get the North... You will put a wedge in the midst of this nation.&quot; He memorably said of his fellow Irish Protestants, &quot;we are no petty people&quot;.

In 1924 he chaired a coinage committee charged with selecting a set of designs for the first currency of the Irish Free State. Aware of the symbolic power latent in the imagery of a young state&#x27;s currency, he sought a form that was &quot;elegant, racy of the soil, and utterly unpolitical&quot;. When the house finally decided on the artwork of Percy Metcalfe, Yeats was pleased, though he regretted that compromise had led to &quot;lost muscular tension&quot; in the finally depicted images. He retired from the Senate in 1928 because of ill health.

Towards the end of his life—and especially after the Wall Street crash of 1929 and Great Depression, which led some to question whether democracy could cope with deep economic difficulty—Yeats seems to have returned to his aristocratic sympathies. During the aftermath of the First World War, he became sceptical about the efficacy of democratic government, and anticipated political reconstruction in Europe through totalitarian rule. His later association with Pound drew him towards Benito Mussolini, for whom he expressed admiration on a number of occasions. He wrote three &quot;marching songs&quot;—never used—for the Irish General Eoin O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s Blueshirts.

At the age of 68 he was &#x27;rejuvenated&#x27; by the Steinach operation which was performed on 6 April 1934 by Norman Haire. For the last five years of his life Yeats found a new vigour evident from both his poetry and his intimate relations with younger women. During this time, Yeats was involved in a number of romantic affairs with, among others, the poet and actress Margot Ruddock and the novelist, journalist and sexual radical Ethel Mannin. As in his earlier life, Yeats found erotic adventure conducive to his creative energy, and, despite age and ill-health, he remained a prolific writer. In a letter of 1935, Yeats noted: &quot;I find my present weakness made worse by the strange second puberty the operation has given me, the ferment that has come upon my imagination. If I write poetry it will be unlike anything I have done.&quot; In 1936, he undertook editorship of the &quot;Oxford Book of Modern Verse, 1892–1935&quot;. From 1935 to 1936 he travelled to the Western Mediterranean island of Majorca with Indian-born Shri Purohit Swami and from there the two of them performed the majority of the work in translating the principal Upanishads from Sanskrit into common English; the resulting work, &quot;The Ten Principal Upanishads&quot;, was published in 1938.

== Death ==
He died at the Hôtel Idéal Beauséjour in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, near Menton, France, on 28 January 1939, aged 73. He was buried after a discreet and private funeral at Roquebrune. Attempts had been made at Roquebrune to dissuade the family from proceeding with the removal of the remains to Ireland due to the uncertainty of their identity. His body had earlier been exhumed and transferred to the ossuary. Yeats and his wife, George, had often discussed his death and his express wish was that he be buried quickly in France with a minimum of fuss. According to George, &quot;His actual words were &#x27;If I die, bury me up there [at Roquebrune] and then in a year&#x27;s time when the newspapers have forgotten me, dig me up and plant me in Sligo.&#x27;&quot; In September 1948, Yeats&#x27;s body was moved to the churchyard of St Columba&#x27;s Church, Drumcliff, County Sligo, on the Irish Naval Service corvette &quot;LÉ Macha&quot;. The person in charge of this operation for the Irish Government was Seán MacBride, son of Maud Gonne MacBride, and then Minister of External Affairs.

His epitaph is taken from the last lines of &quot;Under Ben Bulben&quot;, one of his final poems:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Cast a cold Eye
On Life, on Death.
Horseman, pass by!&lt;/poem&gt;

The French ambassador Stanislas Ostroróg was involved in returning Yeats&#x27;s remains to Ireland in 1948; in a letter to the European director of the Foreign Ministry in Paris, &quot;Ostrorog tells how Yeats&#x27;s son Michael sought official help in locating the poet&#x27;s remains. Neither Michael Yeats nor Sean MacBride, the Irish foreign minister who organised the ceremony, wanted to know the details of how the remains were collected, Ostrorog notes. He repeatedly urges caution and discretion and says the Irish ambassador in Paris should not be informed.&quot; Yeats&#x27;s body was exhumed in 1946 and the remains were moved to an ossuary and mixed with other remains. The French Foreign Ministry authorized Ostrorog to secretly cover the cost of repatriation from his slush fund. Authorities were worried about the fact that the much-loved poet&#x27;s remains were thrown into a communal grave, causing embarrassment for both Ireland and France. Per a letter from Ostroróg to his superiors, &quot;Mr Rebouillat, (a) forensic doctor in Roquebrune would be able to reconstitute a skeleton presenting all the characteristics of the deceased.&quot;

== Style ==

Yeats is considered one of the key 20th-century English-language poets. He was a Symbolist poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled them so that, in addition to a particular meaning, they suggest abstract thoughts that may seem more significant and resonant. His use of symbols is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities.

Unlike the modernists who experimented with free verse, Yeats was a master of the traditional forms. The impact of modernism on his work can be seen in the increasing abandonment of the more conventionally poetic diction of his early work in favour of the more austere language and more direct approach to his themes that increasingly characterises the poetry and plays of his middle period, comprising the volumes &quot;In the Seven Woods&quot;, &quot;Responsibilities&quot; and &quot;The Green Helmet&quot;. His later poetry and plays are written in a more personal vein, and the works written in the last twenty years of his life include mention of his son and daughter, as well as meditations on the experience of growing old. In his poem &quot;The Circus Animals&#x27; Desertion&quot;, he describes the inspiration for these late works:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Now that my ladder&#x27;s gone
I must lie down where all the ladders start
In the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.&lt;/poem&gt;

During 1929, he stayed at Thoor Ballylee near Gort in County Galway (where Yeats had his summer home since 1919) for the last time. Much of the remainder of his life was lived outside Ireland, although he did lease Riversdale house in the Dublin suburb of Rathfarnham in 1932. He wrote prolifically through his final years, and published poetry, plays, and prose. In 1938, he attended the Abbey for the final time to see the premiere of his play &quot;Purgatory&quot;. His &quot;Autobiographies of William Butler Yeats&quot; was published that same year. The preface for the English translation of Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s &quot;Gitanjali&quot; (&quot;Song Offering&quot;) (for which Tagore won the Nobel prize in Literature) was written by Yeats in 1913.

While Yeats&#x27;s early poetry drew heavily on Irish myth and folklore, his later work was engaged with more contemporary issues, and his style underwent a dramatic transformation. His work can be divided into three general periods. The early poems are lushly pre-Raphaelite in tone, self-consciously ornate, and, at times, according to unsympathetic critics, stilted. Yeats began by writing epic poems such as &quot;The Isle of Statues&quot; and &quot;The Wanderings of Oisin&quot;. His other early poems are lyrics on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects. Yeats&#x27;s middle period saw him abandon the pre-Raphaelite character of his early work and attempt to turn himself into a Landor-style social ironist.

Critics characterize his middle work as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find the poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats&#x27;s later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system he began to work out for himself under the influence of spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly-minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of &quot;The Wanderings of Oisin&quot;, is reproduced in &quot;A Dialogue Between Self and Soul&quot;.

Some critics hold that Yeats spanned the transition from the 19th century into 20th-century modernism in poetry much as Pablo Picasso did in painting; others question whether late Yeats has much in common with modernists of the Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot variety.

Modernists read the well-known poem &quot;The Second Coming&quot; as a dirge for the decline of European civilisation, but it also expresses Yeats&#x27;s apocalyptic mystical theories and is shaped by the 1890s. His most important collections of poetry started with &quot;The Green Helmet&quot; (1910) and &quot;Responsibilities&quot; (1914). In imagery, Yeats&#x27;s poetry became sparer and more powerful as he grew older. &quot;The Tower&quot; (1928), &quot;The Winding Stair&quot; (1933), and &quot;New Poems&quot; (1938) contained some of the most potent images in 20th-century poetry.

Yeats&#x27;s mystical inclinations, informed by Hinduism, theosophical beliefs and the occult, provided much of the basis of his late poetry, which some critics have judged as lacking in intellectual credibility. The metaphysics of Yeats&#x27;s late works must be read in relation to his system of esoteric fundamentals in &quot;A Vision&quot; (1925).

Yeats is commemorated in Sligo town by a statue, sculpted by Rowan Gillespie in 1989. On the 50th anniversary of the poet&#x27;s death, it was erected outside the Ulster Bank. When receiving his Nobel Prize in Stockholm, Yeats had remarked on the similarities between that city&#x27;s Royal Palace and the Ulster Bank. Across the river is the Yeats Memorial Building, which houses the Sligo Yeats Society. &quot;Standing Figure: Knife Edge&quot; by Henry Moore is displayed in the W. B. Yeats Memorial Garden at St Stephen&#x27;s Green in Dublin.

Composer Marcus Paus&#x27; choral work &quot;The Stolen Child&quot; (2009) is based on poetry by Yeats. Critic Stephen Eddins described it as &quot;sumptuously lyrical and magically wild, and [...] beautifully [capturing] the alluring mystery and danger and melancholy&quot; of Yeats. Argentine composer Julia Stilman-Lasansky based her &quot;Cantata No. 4&quot; on text by Yeats.

There is a blue plaque dedicated to Yeats at Balscadden House on the Balscadden Road in Howth; his cottage home from 1880 to 1883. In 1957 the London County Council erected a plaque at his former residence on 23 Fitzroy Road, Primrose Hill, London.
