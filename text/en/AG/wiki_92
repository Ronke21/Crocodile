<text>War film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval, air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama. It has been strongly associated with the 20th century. The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them. Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, camaraderie between soldiers, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. War films are often categorized by their milieu, such as the Korean War; the most popular subjects are the Second World War and the American Civil War. The stories told may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical. Critics have noted similarities between the Western and the war film.

Nations such as China, Indonesia, Japan, and Russia have their own traditions of war film, centred on their own revolutionary wars but taking varied forms, from action and historical drama to wartime romance.

Subgenres, not necessarily distinct, include anti-war, comedy, propaganda, and documentary. There are similarly subgenres of the war film in specific theatres such as the Western Desert of North Africa and the Pacific in the Second World War, Vietnam, or the Soviet–Afghan War; and films set in specific domains of war, such as the infantry, the air, at sea, in submarines or at prisoner of war camps.

== Genre ==
The war film genre is not necessarily tightly defined: the American Film Institute, for example, speaks of &quot;films to grapple with the Great War&quot; without attempting to classify these. However, some directors and critics have offered at least tentative definitions. The director Sam Fuller defined the genre by saying that &quot;a war film&#x27;s objective, no matter how personal or emotional, is to make a viewer feel war.&quot; John Belton identified four narrative elements of the war film within the context of Hollywood production: a) the suspension of civilian morality during times of war, b) primacy of collective goals over individual motivations, c) rivalry between men in predominantly male groups as well as marginalization and objectification of women, and d) depiction of the reintegration of veterans. The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them.

The film critic Stephen Neale suggests that the genre is for the most part well defined and uncontentious, since war films are simply those about war being waged in the 20th century, with combat scenes central to the drama. However, Neale notes, films set in the American Civil War or the American Indian Wars of the 19th century were called war films in the time before the First World War. The critic Julian Smith argues, on the contrary, that the war film lacks the formal boundaries of a genre like the Western, but that in practice, &quot;successful and influential&quot; war films are about modern wars, in particular World War II, with the combination of mobile forces and mass killing. The film scholar Kathryn Kane points out some similarities between the war film genre and the Western. Both genres use opposing concepts like war and peace, civilization and savagery. War films usually frame World War II as a conflict between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; as represented by the Allied forces and Nazi Germany whereas the Western portrays the conflict between civilized settlers and the savage indigenous peoples. James Clarke notes the similarity between a Western like Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; and &quot;war-movie escapades&quot; like &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;.

The film historian Jeanine Basinger states that she began with a preconception of what the war film genre would be, namely that:

Further, Basinger considers &quot;Bataan&quot; to provide a definition-by-example of &quot;the World War II combat film&quot;, in which a diverse and apparently unsuited group of &quot;hastily assembled volunteers&quot; hold off a much larger group of the enemy through their &quot;bravery and tenacity&quot;. She argues that the combat film is not a subgenre but the only genuine kind of war film. Since she notes that there were in fact only five true combat films made during the Second World War, in her view these few films, central to the genre, are outweighed by the many other films that are only just war films. However, other critics such as Russell Earl Shain propose a far broader definition of war film, to include films that deal &quot;with the roles of civilians, espionage agents, and soldiers in any of the aspects of war (i.e. preparation, cause, prevention, conduct, daily life, and consequences or aftermath.)&quot; Neale points out that genres overlap, with combat scenes for different purposes in other types of film, and suggests that war films are characterised by combat which &quot;determines the fate of the principal characters&quot;. This in turn pushes combat scenes to the climactic ends of war films. Not all critics agree, either, that war films must be about 20th-century wars. James Clarke includes Edward Zwick&#x27;s Oscar-winning &quot;Glory&quot; (1990) among the war films he discusses in detail; it is set in the American Civil War, and he lists six other films about that war which he considers &quot;notable&quot;. The screenwriter and scholar Eric R. Williams identifies war films as one of eleven super-genres in his screenwriters&#x27; taxonomy, claiming that all feature-length narrative films can be classified as belonging to one of them.

The British military historian Antony Beevor &quot;despair[s]&quot; at how film-makers from America and Britain &quot;play fast and loose with the facts&quot;, yet imply that &quot;their version is as good as the truth&quot;. For example, he calls the 2000 American film &quot;U-571&quot; a &quot;shameless deception&quot; for pretending that a US warship had helped to win the Battle of the Atlantic—seven months before America entered the war. He is equally critical of Christopher Nolan&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;Dunkirk&quot; with its unhistorically empty beaches, low-level air combat over the sea, and rescues mainly by the &quot;little ships&quot;. Beevor feels, however, that Continental European film-makers are often &quot;far more scrupulous&quot;; for example, in his view the 2004 German film &quot;Downfall&quot; accurately depicted the historical events of Hitler&#x27;s final days in his Berlin bunker, and he considers the 1965 French film &quot;The 317th Platoon&quot;, set in Vietnam, &quot;the greatest war movie ever made&quot;. The 1966 film &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot; is, he argues, a close second.

== History ==
=== American Civil War ===

The costliest war in U.S. history in terms of American life, this war has been the subject of, or the backdrop to, numerous films, documentaries and mini-series. One of the earliest films using the Civil War as its subject was D.W. Griffith&#x27;s 1910 silent picture, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. Films that have the war as its main subject, or about a certain aspect of the war, include the 1989 film &quot;Glory&quot;, about the first formal unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War to be made up entirely of Black volunteers. Some films such as &quot;Gettysburg&quot; focused on a single battle during the war, or even on a single incident, like the French short film &quot;La Rivière du Hibou&quot; (&quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge&quot;) and Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot; (1956). Others like the 1993 miniseries &quot;North and South&quot; spanned the entire breadth of the war. Some films deal with the human aspects of the war, such as &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; (1951), or &quot;Shenandoah&quot; (1965), on the tragedy that the war inflicted on the civilian population. Ken Burns&#x27;s &quot;The Civil War&quot; is the most-watched documentary in the history of PBS.

=== The Spanish–American War ===

The first war films come from the Spanish–American War of 1898. Short &quot;actualities&quot;—documentary film-clips—included &quot;Burial of the Maine Victims&quot;, &quot;Blanket-Tossing of a New Recruit&quot;, and &quot;Soldiers Washing Dishes&quot;. These non-combat films were accompanied by &quot;reenactments&quot; of fighting, such as of Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Rough Riders&quot; in action against the Spanish, staged in the United States.

=== First World War ===
During the First World War, many films were made about life in the war. Topics included prisoners of war, covert operations, and military training. Both the Central Powers and the Allies produced war documentaries. The films were also used as propaganda in neutral countries like the United States. Among these was a film shot on the Eastern Front by official war photographer to the Central Powers, Albert K. Dawson: &quot;The Battle and Fall of Przemysl&quot; (1915), depicting the Siege of Przemyśl, disastrous for the Austrians, with incidents reenacted using soldiers as extras.

The 1915 Australian film &quot;Within Our Gates&quot; (also known as &quot;Deeds that Won Gallipoli&quot;) by Frank Harvey was described by the &quot;Motion Picture News&quot; as &quot;a really good war story, which is exceptional&quot;.

The 1916 British film &quot;The Battle of the Somme&quot;, by two official cinematographers, Geoffrey Malins and John McDowell, combined documentary and propaganda, seeking to give the public an impression of what trench warfare was like. Much of the film was shot on location at the Western Front in France; it had a powerful emotional impact. It was watched by some 20 million people in Britain in its six weeks of exhibition, making it what the critic Francine Stock called &quot;one of the most successful films of all time&quot;.

The 1925 American film &quot;The Big Parade&quot; depicted unglamorous elements of war: the protagonist loses his leg, and his friends are killed. William A. Wellman&#x27;s &quot;Wings&quot; (1927) showed aerial combat during the war and was made in cooperation with the Army Air Corps. It proved a powerful recruiting tool. It became the first film (in any genre) to be awarded an Oscar for best picture. Later films of varied genres that deal with the First World War include David Lean&#x27;s &quot;colossal epic&quot;, both war film and biopic &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), shot in the then unfamiliar and exciting 70mm Technicolor, and described by Steven Spielberg as &quot;maybe the greatest screenplay ever written for the motion-picture medium&quot;; Richard Attenborough&#x27;s satirical anti-war musical comedy based on Joan Littlewood&#x27;s play of the same name, &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1969); Spielberg&#x27;s 2011 war drama &quot;War Horse&quot; was based on Michael Morpurgo&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel of the same name.

Many of the films promoted as &quot;documentaries&quot; added context to authentic battlefield scenes by staging critical events, and invented episodes and dialog to enhance excitement at the cost of authenticity.

=== Finnish Civil War ===

Although the 1918 Finnish Civil War between Whites and Reds remained a controversial topic a century later in Finland, many Finnish filmmakers have taken up the subject, often basing their work on a book. In 1957, Toivo Särkkä&#x27;s &quot;1918&quot;, based on Jarl Hemmer&#x27;s play and novel, was screened at the 7th Berlin International Film Festival. Recent films include Lauri Törhönen&#x27;s 2007 &quot;The Border&quot;, and Aku Louhimies&#x27;s 2008 &quot;Tears of April&quot;, based on Leena Lander&#x27;s novel. Perhaps the most famous film about the Finnish Civil War is Edvin Laine&#x27;s 1968 &quot;Here, Beneath the North Star&quot;, based on the first two books of Väinö Linna&#x27;s &quot;Under the North Star&quot; trilogy; it describing the civil war from the losing side, Finland&#x27;s Red Guards.

=== Spanish Civil War ===

The Spanish Civil War has attracted directors from different countries. Sam Wood&#x27;s &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943), based on Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s book of the same name, portrays the fated romance between an American played by Gary Cooper and a partisan played by Ingrid Bergman against the backdrop of the civil war. The epic 168-minute film with its landscapes shot in Technicolor and a &quot;beautiful&quot; orchestral score was a success both with audiences and with critics. Alain Resnais&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot; (1950) uses Picasso&#x27;s 1937 painting of the same name to protest against war. Carlos Saura&#x27;s &quot;La Caza&quot; (The Hunt, 1966) uses the metaphor of hunting to criticise the aggressiveness of Spanish fascism. It won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 16th Berlin International Film Festival in 1966. Ken Loach&#x27;s &quot;Land and Freedom&quot; (&quot;Tierra y Libertad&quot;, 1995), loosely based on George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;, follows a British communist through the war to reveal the painful contradictions within the anti-fascist Republican side.

=== Korean War ===

Samuel Fuller&#x27;s &quot;The Steel Helmet&quot; (1951) was made during the Korean War (1950–1953). The critic Guy Westwell notes that it questioned the conduct of the war, as did later films like &quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri&quot; (1954) and &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot; (1959). Fuller agreed that all his films were anti-war. No Hollywood films about the Korean War did well at the box office; the historian Lary May suggested in 2001 that they reminded American viewers of &quot;the only war we have lost&quot;.

In 1955, after the fighting, the successful South Korean action film &quot;Piagol&quot; about leftist guerrilla atrocities encouraged other film-makers. The 1960s military government punished pro-communist film-makers and gave Grand Bell Awards to films with the strongest anti-communist message. &quot;The Taebaek Mountains&quot; (1994) dealt with leftists from the south who fought for the communists, while &quot;Silver Stallion&quot; (1991) and &quot;Spring in My Hometown&quot; (1998) showed the destructive impact of American military presence on village life. The violent action films &quot;Shiri&quot; (1999) and &quot;Joint Security Area&quot; (2000) presented North Korea in a favourable light.

Films in North Korea were made by government film studios and had clear political messages. The first was &quot;My Home Village&quot; (1949), on the liberation of Korea from the Japanese, presented as the work of Kim Il Sung without help from the Americans. Similarly, the country&#x27;s films about the Korean War show victory without help from the Chinese. The film scholar Johannes Schönherr concludes that the purpose of these films is &quot;to portray North Korea as a country under siege&quot;, and that since the U.S. and its &quot;puppet&quot; South Korea invaded the North once, they would do so again.

=== Algerian War ===
Gillo Pontecorvo&#x27;s dramatic &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot; ((; ; ), 1966) portrayed events in the Algerian War (1954–1956). It was shot on location as an Italo-Algerian co-production. It had the black and white newsreel style of Italian neorealism, and even-handedly depicts violence on both sides. It won various awards including Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. It was attacked by French critics and was for five years banned in France as well as &quot;Jamila, the Algerian&quot; (1958).

=== Vietnam War ===
Few films before the late 1970s about the Vietnam War actually depicted combat; exceptions include &quot;The Green Berets&quot; (1968). Critics such as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because of opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, making the subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the army did not wish to assist in making anti-war films.

From the late 1970s, independently financed and produced films showed Hollywood that Vietnam could be treated in film. Successful but very different portrayals of the war in which America had been defeated included Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978), and Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979). With the shift in American politics to the right in the 1980s, military success could again be shown in films such as Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Platoon&quot; (1986), Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987) and John Irvin&#x27;s &quot;Hamburger Hill&quot; (1987).

The Vietnamese director &#x27;s &quot;The Abandoned Field: Free Fire Zone&quot; (&quot;Cánh đồng hoang&quot;, 1979) gives an &quot;unnerving and compelling .. subjective-camera-eye-view&quot; of life under helicopter fire in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War. The film cuts to an (American) &quot;helicopter-eye view&quot;, contrasting painfully with the human tenderness seen earlier.

=== Later wars ===
Dino Mustafić&#x27;s &quot;Remake&quot; (2003), written by Zlatko Topčić, tells the parallel coming-of-age stories of a father living in Sarajevo during World War II and his son living through the Siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian War. According to Topčić, the story is based on incidents from his own life.

The Iraq War served as the background story of American movies, like &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; from 2008, &quot;Green Zone&quot; from 2010, and &quot;American Sniper&quot; from 2014.

The War in Afghanistan since 2001 was depicted in various movies, among them &quot;Restrepo&quot; in 2010 and &quot;Lone Survivor&quot; from 2013.

== Second World War ==
=== Made by Western Allies ===
The first popular Allied war films made during the Second World War came from Britain and combined the functions of documentary and propaganda. Films such as &quot;The Lion Has Wings&quot; and &quot;Target for Tonight&quot; were made under the control of the Films Division of the Ministry of Information. The British film industry began to combine documentary techniques with fictional stories in films like Noël Coward and David Lean&#x27;s &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942)—&quot;the most successful British film of the war years&quot;—&quot;Millions Like Us&quot; (1943), and &quot;The Way Ahead&quot; (1944).

In America, documentaries were produced in various ways: General Marshall commissioned the &quot;Why We Fight&quot; propaganda series from Frank Capra; the War Department&#x27;s Information-Education Division started out making training films for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; the Army made its own through the U.S. Signal Corps, including John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of San Pietro&quot;. Hollywood made films with propaganda messages about America&#x27;s allies, such as &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; (1942), which portrayed a British family on the home front; &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; (1943) showed Norwegian resistance fighters, and &quot;The North Star&quot; (1943) showed the Soviet Union and its Communist Party. Towards the end of the war popular books provided higher quality and more serious stories for films such as &quot;Guadalcanal Diary&quot; (1943), Mervyn LeRoy&#x27;s &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; (1944), and John Ford&#x27;s &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; (1945).

The Soviet Union, too, appreciated the propaganda value of film, to publicise both victories and German atrocities. Ilya Kopalin&#x27;s documentary &quot;Moscow Strikes Back&quot; (, literally &quot;The rout of the German troops near Moscow&quot;), was made during the Battle of Moscow between October 1941 and January 1942. It depicted civilians helping to defend the city, the parade in Red Square and Stalin&#x27;s speech rousing the Russian people to battle, actual fighting, Germans surrendering and dead, and atrocities including murdered children and hanged civilians. It won an Academy Award in 1943 for best documentary. Newsreel cameras were similarly rushed to Stalingrad early in 1943 to record &quot;the spectacle which greeted the Russian soldiers&quot;—the starvation of Russian prisoners of war in the Voropovono camp by the German Sixth Army, defeated in the Battle of Stalingrad.

Feature films made in the west during the war were subject to censorship and were not always realistic in nature. One of the first to attempt to represent violence, and which was praised at the time for &quot;gritty realism&quot;, was Tay Garnett&#x27;s &quot;Bataan&quot; (1943). The depiction actually remained stylised. Jeanine Basinger gives as an example the &quot;worst image for stark violence&quot; when a Japanese soldier beheads an American: the victim shows pain and his lips freeze in a scream, yet no blood spurts and his head does not fall off. Basinger points out that while this is physically unrealistic, psychologically it may not have been. The wartime audience was, she points out, well aware of friends and relatives who had been killed or who had come home wounded.

=== Made by Axis powers ===

The Axis powers similarly made films during the Second World War, for propaganda and other purposes. In Germany, the army high command brought out &quot;Sieg im Westen&quot; (&quot;Victory in the West&quot;, 1941). Other Nazi propaganda films had varied subjects, as with &quot;Kolberg&quot; (1945), which depicts stubborn Prussian resistance in the Siege of Kolberg (1807) to the invading French troops under Napoleon. The propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels chose the historical subject as suitable for the worsening situation facing Nazi Germany when it was filmed from October 1943 to August 1944. At over eight million marks, using thousands of soldiers as extras and 100 railway wagonloads of salt to simulate snow, it was the most costly German film made during the war. The actual siege ended with the surrender of the town; in the film, the French generals abandon the siege.

For Japan, the war began with the undeclared war and invasion of China in 1937, which the Japanese authorities called &quot;The China Incident&quot;. The government dispatched a &quot;pen brigade&quot; to write and film the action in China with &quot;humanist values&quot;. Tomotaka Tasaka&#x27;s &quot;Mud and Soldiers&quot; (1939) for instance, shot on location in China, Kōzaburō Yoshimura&#x27;s &quot;Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi&quot;, and Sato Takeshi&#x27;s &quot;Chocolate and Soldiers&quot; (1938) show the common Japanese soldier as an individual and as a family man, and even enemy Chinese soldiers are presented as individuals, sometimes fighting bravely. Once war with the United States was declared, the Japanese conflict became known as the Pacific War. Japanese film critics worried that even with Western film techniques, their film output failed to represent native Japanese values. The historian John Dower found that Japanese wartime films had been largely forgotten, as &quot;losers do not get reruns&quot;, yet they were so subtle and skilful that Frank Capra thought &quot;Chocolate and Soldiers&quot; unbeatable. Heroes were typically low-ranking officers, not samurai, calmly devoted to his men and his country. These films did not personalise the enemy and therefore lacked hatred, though Great Britain could figure as the &quot;cultural enemy&quot;. For Japanese film-makers, war was not a cause but more like a natural disaster, and &quot;what mattered was not whom one fought but how well&quot;. Asian enemies, especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war, but present the Japanese state as one great family and the Japanese people as an &quot;innocent, suffering, self-sacrificing people&quot;. Dower comments that the perversity of this image &quot;is obvious: it is devoid of any recognition that, at every level, the Japanese also victimized others.&quot;

=== Postwar ===

According to Andrew Pulver of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the public fascination with war films became an &quot;obsession&quot;, with over 200 war films produced in each decade of the 1950s and 1960s. War film production in the United Kingdom and United States reached its zenith in the mid-1950s. Its popularity in the United Kingdom was brought on by the critical and commercial success of Charles Frend&#x27;s &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; (1953). Like others of the period, &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; was based on a bestselling novel, in this case the former naval commander Nicholas Monsarrat&#x27;s story of the battle of the Atlantic. Others, like &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1954), with its exciting tale of the inventor Barnes Wallis&#x27;s unorthodox bouncing bomb and its distinctive theme music, were true stories. &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; became the most popular film in Britain in 1955, and remained a favourite as of 2015 with a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, though, partly because it celebrated an &quot;exclusively British [victory]&quot;, it failed in the American market. A large number of war films were made in the 1955–1958 period in particular. In 1957 alone, &quot;Bitter Victory&quot;, &quot;Count Five and Die&quot;, &quot;The Enemy Below&quot;, &quot;Ill Met by Moonlight&quot;, &quot;Men in War&quot;, &quot;The One That Got Away&quot;, and &quot;Seven Thunders&quot;, and the highly successful, critically acclaimed pictures &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (which won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year) and &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; were released. Some, such as &quot;Bitter Victory&quot;, focused more on the psychological battle between officers and egotism rather than events during the war. &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; brought a new complexity to the war picture, with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war. By the end of the decade the &quot;sense of shared achievement&quot; which had been common in war films &quot;began to evaporate&quot;, according to Pulver.

Hollywood films in the 1950s and 1960s could display spectacular heroics or self-sacrifice, as in the popular &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; (1949) starring John Wayne. U.S. Marines considered &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; visually authentic, but found Lewis Milestone&#x27;s &quot;Battle Cry&quot; (1955), with its attention to the lives of the men, the more realistic film. The formula for a successful war film consisted, according to Lawrence Suid, of a small group of ethnically diverse men; an unreasonable senior officer; cowards became heroic, or died. Jeanine Basinger suggests that a traditional war film should have a hero, a group, and an objective, and that the group should contain &quot;an Italian, a Jew, a cynical complainer from Brooklyn, a sharpshooter from the mountains, a midwesterner (nicknamed by his state, &#x27;Iowa&#x27; or &#x27;Dakota&#x27;), and a character who must be initiated in some way&quot;. Films based on real commando missions, like &quot;The Gift Horse&quot; (1952) based on the St. Nazaire Raid, and &quot;Ill Met by Moonlight&quot; (1956) based on the capture of the German commander of Crete, inspired fictional adventure films such as &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961), &quot;The Train&quot; (1964), and &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; (1968). These used the war as a backdrop for spectacular action.

Darryl F. Zanuck produced the 178 minute documentary drama &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962), based on the first day of the D-Day landings, achieving commercial success and Oscars. It was followed by large-scale but thoughtful films like Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s &quot;Ivan&#x27;s Childhood&quot; (1962), and quasi-documentary all-star epics filmed in Europe such as &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; (1965), &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969), &quot;The Battle of Neretva&quot; (1969), &quot;Midway&quot; (1976), and &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977). In Lawrence Suid&#x27;s view, &quot;The Longest Day&quot; &quot;served as the model for all subsequent combat spectaculars&quot;. However, its cost also made it the last of the traditional war films, while the controversy around the help given by the U.S. Army and Zanuck&#x27;s &quot;disregard for Pentagon relations&quot; changed the way that Hollywood and the Army collaborated.

Zanuck, by then an executive at 20th Century Fox, set up an American–Japanese co-production for Richard Fleischer&#x27;s &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970) to depict what &quot;really happened on December 7, 1941&quot; in the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The film, panned by Roger Ebert and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was a major success in Japan. Its realistic-looking attack footage was reused in later films such as &quot;Midway&quot; (1976), &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; (1980), and &quot;Australia&quot; (2008). The story was revisited in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001), described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a &quot;noisy, expensive and very long new blockbuster&quot;, with the comment that &quot;for all its epic pretensions (as if epic were a matter of running time, tumescent music and earnest voice-over pronouncements), the movie works best as a bang-and-boom action picture&quot;.

Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998) uses hand-held camera, sound design, staging, and increased audio-visual detail to defamiliarise viewers accustomed to conventional combat films, so as to create what film historian Stuart Bender calls &quot;reported realism&quot;, whether or not the portrayal is genuinely more realistic. Jeanine Basinger notes that critics experienced it as &quot;groundbreaking and anti-generic&quot;, with, in James Wolcott&#x27;s words, a &quot;desire to bury the cornball, recruiting poster legend of John Wayne: to get it right this time&quot;; and that combat films have always been &quot;grounded in the need to help an audience understand and accept war&quot;. Its success revived interest in World War II films. Others tried to portray the reality of the war, as in Joseph Vilsmaier&#x27;s &quot;Stalingrad&quot; (1993), which &quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;goes about as far as a movie can go in depicting modern warfare as a stomach-turning form of mass slaughter&quot;.

=== Military–film industry relations ===

Many war films have been produced with the cooperation of a nation&#x27;s military forces. Since the Second World War, the United States Navy has provided ships and technical guidance for films such as &quot;Top Gun&quot;. The U.S. Air Force assisted with &quot;The Big Lift&quot;, &quot;Strategic Air Command&quot; and &quot;A Gathering of Eagles&quot;, which were filmed on Air Force bases; Air Force personnel appeared in many roles. Critics have argued that the film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;&#x27;s US-biased portrayal of events is a compensation for technical assistance received from the US armed forces, noting that the premiere was held on board a U.S. Navy carrier. In another case, the U.S. Navy objected to elements of &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, especially mutiny on board an American naval vessel, so the film was produced without their assistance. The film historian Jonathan Rayner observes that such films &quot;have also clearly been intended to serve vital propagandist, recruitment and public relations functions&quot;.

== National traditions ==

=== Chinese ===

The first Chinese war films were newsreels like &quot;Battle of Wuhan&quot; (1911) and &quot;Battle of Shanghai&quot; (1913). Still in films such as Xu Xinfu&#x27;s &quot;Battle Exploits&quot; (1925), war featured mainly as background. Only with the Second Sino–Japanese War from 1937 onwards did war film become a serious genre in China, with nationalistic films such as Shi Dongshan&#x27;s &quot;Protect Our Land&quot; (1938). The Chinese Civil War, too, attracted films such as Cheng Yin&#x27;s &quot;From Victory to Victory&quot; (1952). A more humanistic film set in the same period is Xie Jin&#x27;s The Cradle (1979), while more recent large-scale commercial films include Lu Chuan&#x27;s &quot;City of Life and Death&quot; (2009). Chinese directors have repeatedly attempted to cover the atrocities committed by the Japanese during the Nanjing Massacre (1937–1938), with films such as the political melodrama &quot;Massacre in Nanjing&quot;, Mou Tun Fei&#x27;s docudrama &quot;Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre&quot;, and the &quot;contrived Sino–Japanese romance&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry, Nanking&quot;. Zhang Yimou&#x27;s epic Chinese film &quot;Flowers of War&quot; (2011), based on Geling Yan&#x27;s novel, portrays the violent events through the eyes of a 13-year-old girl.

=== Indonesian ===
Many Indonesian films deal with the occupation of the archipelago by the Japanese during the Second World War. Teguh Karya&#x27;s &quot;Doea Tanda Mata&quot; (&quot;Mementos&quot;, literally &quot;Two Eye Marks&quot;, 1985) covers the limited nationalist resistance to Dutch colonial rule in the 1930s. A third group of films such as &quot;Enam Djam di Jogja&quot; (&quot;Six Hours in Yogyakarta&quot;, 1951) and &quot;Serangan Fajar&quot; (&quot;Attack at Dawn&quot;, 1983) covers the Indonesian war of independence (1945–1949). Two other films about the same period portray the Indonesian equivalent of the Chinese Long March: Usmar Ismail&#x27;s &quot;Darah dan Doa&quot; (&quot;The Long March&quot;, literally &quot;Blood and Prayer&quot;, 1950) and &quot;Mereka Kembali&quot; (&quot;They Return&quot;, 1975). Each of these films interprets the past from the perspective of its own time.

The more recent &quot;Merdeka&quot; (Freedom) trilogy (2009–2011), starting with &quot;Merah Putih&quot; (&quot;Red and White&quot;, the colours of the flag of the new Indonesia), revisits the campaign for independence through the lives of a diverse group of cadets who become guerillas.

Karya&#x27;s &quot;November 1828&quot; (1979) looks at Indonesia&#x27;s struggle for independence through historical drama about the Java or Diponegoro War (1825–1830), though the colonial enemy was the same, the Dutch. Deanne Schultz considered it &quot;a valuable interpretation&quot; of Indonesian history that &quot;embodies the best of popular Indonesian cinema&quot;. It was the first Indonesian film to become well known internationally.

=== Soviet ===

War has been the Soviet Union&#x27;s cinema&#x27;s major genre, becoming known indeed as the &quot;cinema front&quot;, and its war films ranged from grim portrayals of atrocities to sentimental and even quietly subversive accounts. Leonid Lukov&#x27;s popular and &quot;beautiful&quot; &quot;Two Warriors&quot; (1943) depicted two stereotypical Soviet soldiers, a quiet Russian and an extrovert southerner from Odessa, singing in his dugout.

The many Soviet films about the Second World War include both large-scale epics such as Yury Ozerov&#x27;s &quot;Battle of Moscow&quot; (1985) and Mikhail Kalatozov&#x27;s more psychological &quot;The Cranes are Flying&quot; (1957) on the cruel effects of war; it won the 1958 Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes.

=== Japanese ===
Japanese directors have made popular films such as &quot;Submarine I-57 Will Not Surrender&quot; (1959), &quot;Battle of Okinawa&quot; (1971) and &quot;Japan&#x27;s Longest Day&quot; (1967) from a Japanese perspective. These &quot;generally fail to explain the cause of the war&quot;. In the decades immediately after the Second World War, Japanese films often focused on human tragedy rather than combat, such as &quot;The Burmese Harp&quot; (1956) and &quot;Fires on the Plain&quot; (1959). From the late 1990s, films started to take a positive view of the war and of Japanese actions. These nationalistic films, including &quot;Pride&quot; (1998), &quot;Merdeka 17805&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Truth about Nanjing&quot; (2007), have emphasized positive traits of the Japanese military and contended that the Japanese were victims of post-war vindictiveness and viciousness. Such films have, however, been subject to protest for revisionism. &quot;The Eternal Zero&quot; (2013) narrates the tale of a Zero fighter pilot who is considered a coward by his comrades, as he returns alive from his missions. It broke the record takings for a Japanese live action film, and won the Golden Mulberry at the Udine Far East Film Festival, but was criticised for its nationalistic sympathy with kamikaze pilots.

== Subgenres ==

=== Documentary ===
The wartime authorities in both Britain and America produced a wide variety of documentary films. Their purposes included military training, advice to civilians, and encouragement to maintain security. Since these films often carried messages, they grade into propaganda. Similarly, commercially produced films often combined information, support for the war effort, and a degree of propaganda. Newsreels, ostensibly simply for information, were made in both Allied and Axis countries, and were often dramatised. More recently, in the Iran–Iraq War, Morteza Avini&#x27;s &quot;Ravayat-e Fath&quot; (Chronicles of Victory) television series combined front-line footage with commentary.

=== Propaganda ===

Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s 1938 historical drama &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; depicts Prince Alexander&#x27;s defeat of the attempted invasion of the Russian city of Novgorod by the Teutonic Knights. By April 1939 the film had been seen by 23,000,000 people. In 1941 the director and three others were awarded the Stalin Prize for their contributions. The film features a musical score by the classical composer Sergei Prokofiev, considered by artists such as the composer André Previn the best ever written for cinema. Russell Merritt, writing in &quot;Film Quarterly&quot;, describes it as a &quot;war propaganda film&quot;. A 1978 Mondadori poll placed &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; among the world&#x27;s 100 best motion pictures.

During the Second World War, film propaganda was widely used. Kenneth Clark advised the British government that &quot;If we renounced interest in entertainment as such, we might be deprived of a valuable weapon for getting across our propaganda&quot;; he suggested using documentaries about the war and the war effort; celebrations of Britishness; and films about British life and character. Michael Powell and Clark agreed on a story about survivors of a U-boat crew, imbued with brutal Nazi ideology, travelling across Canada and meeting various kind, tolerant and intelligent Canadians, to encourage America into the war. The resulting film, &quot;49th Parallel&quot; (1941), became the top film at British offices that year. Entertaining films could carry messages about the need for vigilance, too, as in &quot;Went the Day Well?&quot; (1942) or the avoidance of &quot;careless talk&quot;, as in &quot;The Next of Kin&quot; (1942).

In America, Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; (1940) clearly satirised fascism. Michael Curtiz&#x27;s &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1943) was not simply a romance between the characters played by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, but vilified the Nazis and glorified resistance to them. Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Why We Fight&quot; series (1942–1945) won the 1942 Academy Award for best documentary, though it was designed to &quot;influence opinion in the U.S. military&quot;.

During the Cold War, &quot;propaganda played as much of a role in the United States&#x27; struggle with the Soviet Union as did the billions of dollars spent on weaponry.&quot; &quot;Face to Face with Communism&quot; (1951) dramatised an imagined invasion of the United States; other films portrayed threats such as communist indoctrination.

=== Submarine ===

Submarine films have their own particular meanings and conventions, concerned specifically with giving the effect of submarine warfare. A distinctive element in this subgenre is the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s 1981 &quot;Das Boot&quot;, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges, the ping of sonar, and threatening sounds such as of the propellers of enemy destroyers and torpedoes. Classic films in the genre include &quot;The Enemy Below&quot; (1957) and &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; (1958), both based on novels by naval commanders. &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; is a movie full of tension, both with the enemy and between the contrasting personalities of the submarine Commander and his Lieutenant, played by Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.

=== Prisoner of war ===

A popular subgenre of war films in the 1950s and 1960s was the prisoner of war film. The genre was popularised in Britain with major films like Guy Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;The Colditz Story&quot; (1955) and John Sturges&#x27;s American film &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963). They told stories of real escapes from German prisoner of war camps such as Stalag Luft III in the Second World War. Despite episodes of danger and human tragedy, these films delight in a continual boyish game of escape and ingenuity, celebrating the courage and the defiant spirit of the prisoners of war, and treating war as fun. David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957) was judged best picture at the Oscars; it took the genre from chilly German prisons to the heat of a camp in Thailand. It was the first, too, to use lush colour to bring out the British stiff upper lip of the colonel, played by Alec Guinness in an Oscar-winning performance. The &quot;definitive&quot; Oscar-winning prisoner of war film was Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Stalag 17&quot; (1953), while the brief but powerful prison camp scenes of &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978) lend an air of tragedy to the whole of that film.

=== Comedy ===

Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Shoulder Arms&quot; (1918) set a style for war films to come, and was the first comedy about war in film history.

British cinema in the Second World War marked the evacuation of children from London with social comedies such as &quot;Those Kids from Town&quot; (1942) where the evacuees go to stay with an earl, while in &quot;Cottage to Let&quot; (1941) and &quot;Went the Day Well?&quot; (1942) the English countryside is thick with spies. &quot;Gasbags&quot; (1941) offered &quot;zany, irreverent, knockabout&quot; comedy making fun of everything from barrage balloons to concentration camps. Abbott and Costello&#x27;s &quot;Buck Privates&quot; (1941) was successful in America, leading to many further wartime comedies.

=== Animated ===
Winsor McCay&#x27;s &quot;The Sinking of the Lusitania&quot; (1918) was a silent First World War film. At 12 minutes long, it was the longest animated film made at that time. It was probably the first animated propaganda film to be made; it remains the earliest serious animated drama that has survived. Through World War II, animated propaganda shorts remained influential in American cinema. The Walt Disney Company, working with the American armed forces, produced 400,000 feet of war propaganda films between 1942 and 1945, including &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot; (1943) and &quot;Education for Death&quot; (1943).

Japanese anime films from the 1960s onwards addressed national memories of war. &quot;Akira&quot; (1988) moves from the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to apocalyptic visions of global conflict; &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; (1988) is elegiac on the effect of war on children. &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; (1983) portrays the bombing of Hiroshima through the eyes of a child, but reviewers consider it a less well made film than &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; with &quot;stomach-churning detail&quot; bizarrely paired with crude artwork, giving it the look of a &quot;Saturday morning Warner Brothers cartoon&quot;.

=== Anti-war ===

The anti-war genre began with films about the First World War. Films in the genre are typically revisionist, reflecting on past events and often generically blended. Lewis Milestone&#x27;s &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930) was unquestionably powerful, and an early anti-war film, portraying a German point of view; it was the first film (in any genre) to win two Oscars, best picture and best director. Andrew Kelly, analysing &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, defined the genre as showing: the brutality of war; the amount of human suffering; the betrayal of men&#x27;s trust by incompetent officers. War and anti-war films often prove difficult to categorize as they contain many generic ambiguities. While many anti-war films criticize war directly through depictions of grisly combat in past wars, some films such as Penn&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; criticized war obliquely by poking fun at such things as the draft board. The number of anti-war films produced in America dipped sharply during the 1950s because of McCarthyism and the Hollywood blacklist. The end of the blacklist and the introduction of the MPAA rating system marked a time of resurgence for films of all type including anti-war films in the States. Robert Eberwein names two films as anti-war classics. The first is Jean Renoir&#x27;s prisoner of war masterpiece &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; (&quot;The Grand Illusion&quot;, 1937). Renoir&#x27;s critique of contemporary politics and ideology celebrates the universal humanity that transcends national and racial boundaries and radical nationalism, suggesting that mankind&#x27;s common experiences should prevail above political division, and its extension: war. The second is Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; (1957). The critic David Ehrenstein writes that &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; established Kubrick as the &quot;leading commercial filmmaker of his generation&quot; and a world-class talent. Ehrenstein describes the film as an &quot;outwardly cool/inwardly passionate protest drama about a disastrous French army maneuver and the court-martial held in its wake&quot;, contrasting it with the &quot;classic&quot; &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;&#x27;s story of an innocent &quot;unstrung by the horrors of war&quot;.

=== Mixed genres ===

Comedy gave scope for satire, and post-war film-makers merged comedy and anti-war sentiment in films as varied as &quot;Stalag 17&quot; (1953) and &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964). Black comedies like Mike Nichols&#x27;s &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970), based on Joseph Heller&#x27;s satirical novel about the Second World War, and Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970), set in Korea, reflected the attitudes of an increasingly sceptical public during the Vietnam War.

Other genres were combined in Franklin J. Schaffner&#x27;s &quot;Patton&quot; (1970), about real life General George S. Patton, where combat scenes were interleaved with commentary about how he waged war, showing good and bad sides to a command. It and &quot;MASH&quot; became the two most profitable war/anti-war films made up to that time, and &quot;Patton&quot; won seven Academy Awards.

<text>A wireless network is a computer network that uses wireless data connections between network nodes. Wireless networking allows homes, telecommunications networks, and business installations to avoid the costly process of introducing cables into a building, or as a connection between various equipment locations. Admin telecommunications networks are generally implemented and administered using radio communication. This implementation takes place at the physical level (layer) of the OSI model network structure.

Examples of wireless networks include cell phone networks, wireless local area networks (WLANs), wireless sensor networks, satellite communication networks, and terrestrial microwave networks.

== History ==
=== Wireless networks ===
The first professional wireless network was developed under the brand ALOHAnet in 1969 at the University of Hawaii and became operational in June 1971. The first commercial wireless network was the WaveLAN product family, developed by NCR in 1986.

*1973 Ethernet 802.3
*1991 2G cell phone network
*June 1997 802.11 &quot;Wi-Fi&quot; protocol first release
*1999 803.11 VoIP integration

=== Underlying technology ===
Advances in MOSFET (MOS transistor) wireless technology enabled the development of digital wireless networks. The wide adoption of RF CMOS (radio frequency CMOS), power MOSFET and LDMOS (lateral diffused MOS) devices led to the development and proliferation of digital wireless networks by the 1990s, with further advances in MOSFET technology leading to increasing bandwidth in the 2000s (Edholm&#x27;s law). Most of the essential elements of wireless networks are built from MOSFETs, including the mobile transceivers, base station modules, routers, RF power amplifiers, telecommunication circuits, RF circuits, and radio transceivers, in networks such as 2G, 3G, and 4G.

== Wireless links ==
* &quot;Terrestrial microwave&quot; – Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately apart.
* &quot;Communications satellites&quot; – Satellites communicate via microwave radio waves, which are not deflected by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.
* &quot;Cellular and PCS systems&quot; use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area has a low-power transmitter or radio relay antenna device to relay calls from one area to the next area.
* &quot;Radio and spread spectrum technologies&quot; – Wireless local area networks use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular and a low-frequency radio technology. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. IEEE 802.11 defines a common flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology known as Wi-Fi.
* &quot;Free-space optical communication&quot; uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, line-of-sight propagation is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.

== Types of wireless networks ==

===Wireless PAN===
Wireless personal area networks (WPANs) connect devices within a relatively small area, that is generally within a person&#x27;s reach. For example, both Bluetooth radio and invisible infrared light provides a WPAN for interconnecting a headset to a laptop. Zigbee also supports WPAN applications. Wi-Fi PANs are becoming commonplace (2010) as equipment designers start to integrate Wi-Fi into a variety of consumer electronic devices. Intel &quot;My WiFi&quot; and Windows 7 &quot;virtual Wi-Fi&quot; capabilities have made Wi-Fi PANs simpler and easier to set up and configure.

===Wireless LAN===
A wireless local area network (WLAN) links two or more devices over a short distance using a wireless distribution method, usually providing a connection through an access point for internet access. The use of spread-spectrum or OFDM technologies may allow users to move around within a local coverage area, and still remain connected to the network.

Products using the IEEE 802.11 WLAN standards are marketed under the Wi-Fi brand name.
Fixed wireless technology implements point-to-point links between computers or networks at two distant locations, often using dedicated microwave or modulated laser light beams over line of sight paths. It is often used in cities to connect networks in two or more buildings without installing a wired link.
To connect to Wi-Fi using a mobile device, one can use a device like a wireless router or the private hotspot capability of another mobile device.

=== Wireless ad hoc network ===
A wireless ad hoc network, also known as a wireless mesh network or mobile ad hoc network (MANET), is a wireless network made up of radio nodes organized in a mesh topology. Each node forwards messages on behalf of the other nodes and each node performs routing. Ad hoc networks can &quot;self-heal&quot;, automatically re-routing around a node that has lost power. Various network layer protocols are needed to realize ad hoc mobile networks, such as Distance Sequenced Distance Vector routing, Associativity-Based Routing, Ad hoc on-demand distance-vector routing, and Dynamic Source Routing.

=== Wireless MAN ===
Wireless metropolitan area networks are a type of wireless network that connects several wireless LANs.
* WiMAX is a type of Wireless MAN and is described by the IEEE 802.16 standard.

=== Wireless WAN ===
Wireless wide area networks are wireless networks that typically cover large areas, such as between neighboring towns and cities, or city and suburb. These networks can be used to connect branch offices of business or as a public Internet access system. The wireless connections between access points are usually point to point microwave links using parabolic dishes on the 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz band, rather than omnidirectional antennas used with smaller networks. A typical system contains base station gateways, access points and wireless bridging relays. Other configurations are mesh systems where each access point acts as a relay also. When combined with renewable energy systems such as photovoltaic solar panels or wind systems they can be stand-alone systems.

===Cellular network===
A cellular network or mobile network is a radio network distributed over land areas called cells, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver, known as a cell site or base station. In a cellular network, each cell characteristically uses a different set of radio frequencies from all their immediate neighbouring cells to avoid any interference.

When joined these cells provide radio coverage over a wide geographic area. This enables a large number of portable transceivers (e.g., mobile phones, pagers, etc.) to communicate with each other and with fixed transceivers and telephones anywhere in the network, via base stations, even if some of the transceivers are moving through more than one cell during transmission.

Although originally intended for cell phones, with the development of smartphones, cellular telephone networks routinely carry data in addition to telephone conversations:
*Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM): The GSM network is divided into three major systems: the switching system, the base station system, and the operation and support system. The cell phone connects to the base system station which then connects to the operation and support station; it then connects to the switching station where the call is transferred to where it needs to go. GSM is the most common standard and is used for a majority of cell phones.
*Personal Communications Service (PCS): PCS is a radio band that can be used by mobile phones in North America and South Asia. Sprint happened to be the first service to set up a PCS.
*D-AMPS: Digital Advanced Mobile Phone Service, an upgraded version of AMPS, is being phased out due to advancements in technology. The newer GSM networks are replacing the older system.

====Private LTE/5G networks====

Private LTE/5G networks use licensed, shared or unlicensed wireless spectrum thanks to LTE or 5G cellular network base stations, small cells and other radio access network (RAN) infrastructure to transmit voice and data to edge devices (smartphones, embedded modules, routers and gateways.

3GPP defines 5G private networks as non-public networks that typically employ a smaller-scale deployment to meet an organization&#x27;s needs for reliability, accessibility, and maintainability.

====Open Source====

Open source private networks are based on a collaborative, community-driven software that relies on peer review and production to use, modify and share the source code.

=== Global area network ===
A global area network (GAN) is a network used for supporting mobile across an arbitrary number of wireless LANs, satellite coverage areas, etc. The key challenge in mobile communications is handing off user communications from one local coverage area to the next. In IEEE Project 802, this involves a succession of terrestrial wireless LANs.

=== Space network ===
Space networks are networks used for communication between spacecraft, usually in the vicinity of the Earth. The example of this is NASA&#x27;s Space Network.

== Uses ==
Some examples of usage include cellular phones which are part of everyday wireless networks, allowing easy personal communications. Another example, Intercontinental network systems, use radio satellites to communicate across the world. Emergency services such as the police utilize wireless networks to communicate effectively as well. Individuals and businesses use wireless networks to send and share data rapidly, whether it be in a small office building or across the world.

== Properties ==

=== General ===
In a general sense, wireless networks offer a vast variety of uses by both business and home users.
&quot;Now, the industry accepts a handful of different wireless technologies. Each wireless technology is defined by a standard that describes unique functions at both the Physical and the Data Link layers of the OSI model. These standards differ in their specified signaling methods, geographic ranges, and frequency usages, among other things. Such differences can make certain technologies better suited to home networks and others better suited to network larger organizations.&quot;

=== Performance ===
Each standard varies in geographical range, thus making one standard more ideal than the next depending on what it is one is trying to accomplish with a wireless network.
The performance of wireless networks satisfies a variety of applications such as voice and video. The use of this technology also gives room for expansions, such as from 2G to 3G and, 4G and 5G technologies, which stand for the fourth and fifth generation of cell phone mobile communications standards. As wireless networking has become commonplace, sophistication increases through configuration of network hardware and software, and greater capacity to send and receive larger amounts of data, faster, is achieved. Now the wireless network has been running on LTE, which is a 4G mobile communication standard. Users of an LTE network should have data speeds that are 10x faster than a 3G network.

=== Space ===
Space is another characteristic of wireless networking. Wireless networks offer many advantages when it comes to difficult-to-wire areas trying to communicate such as across a street or river, a warehouse on the other side of the premises or buildings that are physically separated but operate as one. Wireless networks allow for users to designate a certain space which the network will be able to communicate with other devices through that network.

Space is also created in homes as a result of eliminating clutters of wiring. This technology allows for an alternative to installing physical network mediums such as TPs, coaxes, or fiber-optics, which can also be expensive.

=== Home ===
For homeowners, wireless technology is an effective option compared to Ethernet for sharing printers, scanners, and high-speed Internet connections. WLANs help save the cost of installation of cable mediums, save time from physical installation, and also creates mobility for devices connected to the network.
Wireless networks are simple and require as few as one single wireless access point connected directly to the Internet via a router.

=== Wireless network elements ===
The telecommunications network at the physical layer also consists of many interconnected wireline network elements (NEs). These NEs can be stand-alone systems or products that are either supplied by a single manufacturer or are assembled by the service provider (user) or system integrator with parts from several different manufacturers.

Wireless NEs are the products and devices used by a wireless carrier to provide support for the backhaul network as well as a mobile switching center (MSC).

Reliable wireless service depends on the network elements at the physical layer to be protected against all operational environments and applications (see GR-3171, &quot;Generic Requirements for Network Elements Used in Wireless Networks – Physical Layer Criteria&quot;).

What are especially important are the NEs that are located on the cell tower to the base station (BS) cabinet. The attachment hardware and the positioning of the antenna and associated closures and cables are required to have adequate strength, robustness, corrosion resistance, and resistance against wind, storms, icing, and other weather conditions. Requirements for individual components, such as hardware, cables, connectors, and closures, shall take into consideration the structure to which they are attached.

=== Difficulties ===

==== Interference ====
Compared to wired systems, wireless networks are frequently subject to electromagnetic interference. This can be caused by other networks or other types of equipment that generate radio waves that are within, or close, to the radio bands used for communication. Interference can degrade the signal or cause the system to fail.

==== Absorption and reflection ====
Some materials cause absorption of electromagnetic waves, preventing it from reaching the receiver, in other cases, particularly with metallic or conductive materials reflection occurs. This can cause dead zones where no reception is available. Aluminium foiled thermal isolation in modern homes can easily reduce indoor mobile signals by 10 dB frequently leading to complaints about the bad reception of long-distance rural cell signals.

==== Multipath fading ====
In multipath fading two or more different routes taken by the signal, due to reflections, can cause the signal to cancel out each other at certain locations, and to be stronger in other places (upfade).

==== Hidden node problem ====

The hidden node problem occurs in some types of network when a node is visible from a wireless access point (AP), but not from other nodes communicating with that AP. This leads to difficulties in medium access control (collisions).

==== Exposed terminal node problem ====

The exposed terminal problem is when a node on one network is unable to send because of co-channel interference from a node that is on a different network.

==== Shared resource problem ====
The wireless spectrum is a limited resource and shared by all nodes in the range of its transmitters. Bandwidth allocation becomes complex with multiple participating users. Often users are not aware that advertised numbers (e.g., for IEEE 802.11 equipment or LTE networks) are not their capacity, but shared with all other users and thus the individual user rate is far lower. With increasing demand, the capacity crunch is more and more likely to happen. User-in-the-loop (UIL) may be an alternative solution to ever upgrading to newer technologies for over-provisioning.

=== Capacity ===

==== Channel ====

Shannon&#x27;s theorem can describe the maximum data rate of any single wireless link, which relates to the bandwidth in hertz and to the noise on the channel.

One can greatly increase channel capacity by using MIMO techniques, where multiple aerials or multiple frequencies can exploit multiple paths to the receiver to achieve much higher throughput – by a factor of the product of the frequency and aerial diversity at each end.

Under Linux, the Central Regulatory Domain Agent (CRDA) controls the setting of channels.

==== Network ====
The total network bandwidth depends on how dispersive the medium is (more dispersive medium generally has better total bandwidth because it minimises interference), how many frequencies are available, how noisy those frequencies are, how many aerials are used and whether a directional antenna is in use, whether nodes employ power control and so on.

Cellular wireless networks generally have good capacity, due to their use of directional aerials, and their ability to reuse radio channels in non-adjacent cells. Additionally, cells can be made very small using low power transmitters this is used in cities to give network capacity that scales linearly with population density.

== Safety ==
Wireless access points are also often close to humans, but the drop off in power over distance is fast, following the inverse-square law.
The position of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Health Protection Agency (HPA) is that “...radio frequency (RF) exposures from WiFi are likely to be lower than those from mobile phones&quot;. It also saw “...no reason why schools and others should not use WiFi equipment&quot;. In October 2007, the HPA launched a new &quot;systematic&quot; study into the effects of WiFi networks on behalf of the UK government, in order to calm fears that had appeared in the media in a recent period up to that time&quot;. Dr Michael Clark, of the HPA, says published research on mobile phones and masts does not add up to an indictment of WiFi.

<text>A web browser is an application for accessing websites. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user&#x27;s screen. Browsers are used on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. By 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion people had used a browser. The most-used browser is Google Chrome, with a 67% global market share on all devices, followed by Safari with 18%.

A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused. A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a website&#x27;s server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed. In some technical contexts, browsers are referred to as user agents.

As of 2024, most used browsers worldwide are: Chrome, Safari (macOS and iOS only), Firefox, Edge, Opera, Samsung Internet (Android only), UC Browser (Android and iOS only), Yandex, Brave and Vivaldi.

==Function==
The purpose of a web browser is to fetch content and display it on the user&#x27;s device. This process begins when the user inputs a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), such as &quot;codice_1&quot;, into the browser. Virtually all URLs on the Web start with either &quot;codice_2&quot; or &quot;codice_3&quot; which means they are retrieved with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). For secure mode (HTTPS), the connection between the browser and web server is encrypted, providing a secure and private data transfer.

Web pages usually contain hyperlinks to other pages and resources. Each link contains a URL, and when it is clicked or tapped, the browser navigates to the new resource. Most browsers use an internal cache of web page resources to improve loading times for subsequent visits to the same page. The cache can store many items, such as large images, so they do not need to be downloaded from the server again. Cached items are usually only stored for as long as the web server stipulates in its HTTP response messages.

===Privacy===
During the course of browsing, cookies received from various websites are stored by the browser. Some of them contain login credentials or site preferences. However, others are used for tracking user behavior over long periods of time, so browsers typically provide a section in the menu for deleting cookies. Finer-grained management of cookies usually requires a browser extension.

==History==
The first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. He then recruited Nicola Pellow to write the Line Mode Browser, which displayed web pages on dumb terminals. The Mosaic web browser was released in April 1993, and was later credited as the first web browser to find mainstream popularity. Its innovative graphical user interface made the World Wide Web easy to navigate and thus more accessible to the average person. This, in turn, sparked the Internet boom of the 1990s, when the Web grew at a very rapid rate. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released the Mosaic-influenced Netscape Navigator in 1994. Navigator quickly became the most popular browser.

Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. Within a few years, Microsoft gained a dominant position in the browser market for two reasons: it bundled Internet Explorer with its popular Windows operating system and did so as freeware with no restrictions on usage. The market share of Internet Explorer peaked at over 95% in the early 2000s. In 1998, Netscape launched what would become the Mozilla Foundation to create a new browser using the open-source software model. This work evolved into the Firefox browser, first released by Mozilla in 2004. Firefox&#x27;s market share peaked at 32% in 2010. Apple released its Safari browser in 2003; it remains the dominant browser on Apple devices, though it did not become popular elsewhere.

Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, which steadily took market share from Internet Explorer and became the most popular browser in 2012. Chrome has remained dominant ever since. By 2015, Microsoft replaced Internet Explorer with Edge [Legacy] for the Windows 10 release.

Since the early 2000s, browsers have greatly expanded their HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and multimedia capabilities. One reason has been to enable more sophisticated websites, such as web apps. Another factor is the significant increase of broadband connectivity in many parts of the world, enabling people to access data-intensive content, such as streaming HD video on YouTube, that was not possible during the era of dial-up modems.

== Browser market ==
Google Chrome has been the dominant browser since the mid-2010s and currently has a 67% global market share on all devices. The vast majority of its source code comes from Google&#x27;s open-source Chromium project; this code is also the basis for many other browsers, including Microsoft Edge, currently in third place with about a 5% share, as well as Samsung Internet and Opera in fifth and sixth places respectively with over 2% market share each.

The other two browsers in the top four are made from different codebases. Safari, based on Apple&#x27;s WebKit code, is the second most popular web browser and is dominant on Apple devices, resulting in an 18% global share. Firefox, in fourth place, with about 3% market share, is based on Mozilla&#x27;s code. Both of these codebases are open-source, so a number of small niche browsers are also made from them.

==Features==
The most popular browsers share many features in common. They automatically log users&#x27; browsing history, unless the users turn off their browsing history or use the non-logging private mode. They also allow users to set bookmarks, customize the browser with extensions, and can manage user passwords. Some provide a sync service and web accessibility features.

Common user interface (UI) features:
* Allowing the user to have multiple pages open at the same time, either in different browser windows or in different tabs of the same window.
* &quot;Back&quot; and &quot;forward&quot; buttons to go back to the previous page visited or forward to the next one.
* A &quot;refresh&quot; or &quot;reload&quot; and a &quot;stop&quot; button to reload and cancel loading the current page. (In most browsers, the stop button is merged with the reload button.)
* A &quot;home&quot; button to return to the start page.
* An address bar to input the URL of a page and display it, and a search bar to input queries into a search engine. (In most browsers, the search bar is merged with the address bar.)

While mobile browsers have similar UI features as desktop versions, the limitations of touch screens require mobile UIs to be simpler. The difference is significant for users accustomed to keyboard shortcuts. The most popular desktop browsers also have sophisticated web development tools.

== Security ==

Web browsers are popular targets for hackers, who exploit security holes to steal information, destroy files, and other malicious activities. Browser vendors regularly patch these security holes, so users are strongly encouraged to keep their browser software updated. Other protection measures are antivirus software and being aware of scams.

<doc id="33174" wikidata="Q828909" url="?curid=33174" title="Wharf">
<text>A wharf ( or wharfs), quay ( , also ), staith, or staithe is a structure on the shore of a harbour or on the bank of a river or canal where ships may dock to load and unload cargo or passengers. Such a structure includes one or more berths (mooring locations), and may also include piers, warehouses, or other facilities necessary for handling the ships. Wharves are often considered to be a series of docks at which boats are stationed. A marginal wharf is connected to the shore along its full length.

==Overview==

A wharf commonly comprises a fixed platform, often on pilings. Commercial ports may have warehouses that serve as interim storage: where it is sufficient a single wharf with a single berth constructed along the land adjacent to the water is normally used; where there is a need for more capacity multiple wharves, or perhaps a single large wharf with multiple berths, will instead be constructed, sometimes projecting over the water. A pier, raised over the water rather than within it, is commonly used for cases where the weight or volume of cargos will be low.

Smaller and more modern wharves are sometimes built on flotation devices (pontoons) to keep them at the same level as the ship, even during changing tides.

In everyday parlance the term &quot;quay&quot; (pronounced &#x27;key&#x27;) is common in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and many other Commonwealth countries, and the Republic of Ireland, and may also refer to neighbourhoods and roadways running along the wayside (for example, Queen&#x27;s Quay in Toronto and Belfast). The term &quot;wharf&quot; is more common in the United States. In some contexts &quot;wharf&quot; and &quot;quay&quot; may be used to mean pier, berth, or jetty.

In old ports such as London (which once had around 1700 wharves) many old wharves have been converted to residential or office use.

Certain early railways in England referred to goods loading points as &quot;wharves&quot;. The term was carried over from marine usage. The person who was resident in charge of the wharf was referred to as a &quot;wharfinger&quot;.

==Etymology==
===Wharf===
The word &quot;wharf&quot; comes from the Old English &quot;hwearf&quot;, cognate to the Old Dutch word &quot;werf&quot;, which both evolved to mean &quot;yard&quot;, an outdoor place where work is done, like a shipyard (Dutch: &quot;scheepswerf&quot;) or a lumberyard (Dutch: &quot;houtwerf&quot;). Originally, &quot;werf&quot; or &quot;werva&quot; in Old Dutch (&quot;werf&quot;, &quot;wer&quot; in Old Frisian) simply referred to inhabited ground that was not yet built on (similar to &quot;yard&quot; in modern English), or alternatively to a &quot;terp&quot;. This could explain the name Ministry Wharf located at Saunderton, just outside High Wycombe, which is nowhere near any body of water. In support of this explanation is the fact that many places in England with &quot;wharf&quot; in their names are in areas with a high Dutch influence, for example the Norfolk broads.

===Staith===
In the northeast and east of England the term &quot;staith&quot; or &quot;staithe&quot; (from the Norse for landing stage) is also used. The two terms have historically had a geographical distinction: those to the north in the Kingdom of Northumbria used the Old English spelling &quot;staith&quot;, southern sites of the Danelaw took the Danish spelling &quot;staithe&quot;. Both originally referred to jetties or wharves. In time, the northern coalfields of Northumbria developed coal staiths specifically for loading coal onto ships and these would adopt the &quot;staith&quot; spelling as a distinction from simple wharves: for example, Dunston Staiths in Gateshead and Brancaster Staithe in Norfolk. However, the term &quot;staith&quot; may also be used to refer only to loading chutes or ramps used for bulk commodities like coal in loading ships and barges.

===Quay===
&quot;Quay&quot;, on the other hand, has its origin in the Proto-Celtic language. Before it changed to its current form under influence of the modern French &quot;quai&quot;, its Middle English spelling was &quot;key&quot;, &quot;keye&quot; or &quot;caye&quot;. This in turn also came from the Old Norman &quot;cai&quot; (Old French / French &quot;chai&quot; &quot;wine cellar&quot;), meaning originally &quot;earth bank near a river&quot;, then &quot;bank built at a port to allow ship docking&quot;. The French term &quot;quai&quot; comes, through Picard or Norman-French, from Gaulish &quot;caio&quot;, ultimately tracing back to the Proto-Celtic &quot;*kagio-&quot; &quot;to encompass, enclose&quot;. Modern cognates include Welsh &quot;cae&quot; &quot;fence, hedge&quot; and Cornish &quot;ke&quot; &quot;hedge&quot;,

<doc id="33175" wikidata="Q41513" url="?curid=33175" title="William Blake">
<text>William Blake (28 November 1757 – 12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his life, Blake has become a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he called his &quot;prophetic works&quot; were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form &quot;what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language&quot;. While he lived in London his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham, he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works, which embraced the imagination as &quot;the body of God&quot;, or &quot;human existence itself&quot;.

Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he came to be highly regarded by later critics and readers for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as &quot;Pre-Romantic&quot;. A theist who preferred his own Marcionite style of theology, he was hostile to the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), and was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the French and American Revolutions. Although later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he maintained an amicable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers such as Emanuel Swedenborg. Despite these known influences, the singularity of Blake&#x27;s work makes him difficult to classify. The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti characterised him as a &quot;glorious luminary&quot;, and &quot;a man not forestalled by predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable successors&quot;.

Collaboration with his wife, Catherine Boucher, was instrumental in the creation of many of his books. Boucher worked as a printmaker and colorist for his works. &quot;For almost forty-five years she was the person who lived and worked most closely with Blake, enabling him to realize numerous projects, impossible without her assistance. Catherine was an artist and printer in her own right&quot;, writes literary scholar Angus Whitehead.

== Early life ==

William Blake was born on 28 November 1757 at 28 Broad Street (now Broadwick Street) in Soho, London. He was the third of seven children, two of whom died in infancy. Blake&#x27;s father, James, was a hosier, who had lived in London. He attended school only long enough to learn reading and writing, leaving at the age of 10, and was otherwise educated at home by his mother Catherine Blake (&quot;née&quot; Wright). Even though the Blakes were English Dissenters, William was baptised on 11 December at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly, London. The Bible was an early and profound influence on Blake, and remained a source of inspiration throughout his life. Blake&#x27;s childhood, according to him, included mystical religious experiences such as &quot;beholding God&#x27;s face pressed against his window, seeing angels among the haystacks, and being visited by the Old Testament prophet Ezekiel.&quot;

Blake started engraving copies of drawings of Greek antiquities purchased for him by his father, a practice that was preferred to actual drawing. In these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of Raphael, Michelangelo, Maarten van Heemskerck and Albrecht Dürer. The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed, at least for a time, a comfortable wealth. When William was ten years old, his parents knew enough of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but instead enrolled in drawing classes at Henry Pars&#x27;s drawing school in the Strand. He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing. During this period, Blake made explorations into poetry; his early work displays knowledge of Ben Jonson, Edmund Spenser, and the Psalms.

=== Apprenticeship ===
On 4 August 1772, Blake was apprenticed to engraver James Basire of Great Queen Street, at the sum of £52.10, for a term of seven years. At the end of the term, aged 21, he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake&#x27;s apprenticeship, but Peter Ackroyd&#x27;s biography notes that Blake later added Basire&#x27;s name to a list of artistic adversaries; and then crossed it out. This aside, Basire&#x27;s style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier stipple or mezzotint styles. It has been speculated that Blake&#x27;s instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring work or recognition in later life.

After two years, Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the Gothic churches in London (perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker, his fellow apprentice). His experiences in Westminster Abbey helped form his artistic style and ideas. The Abbey in his day was decorated with suits of armour, painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks. Ackroyd notes that &quot;the most immediate [impression] would have been of faded brightness and colour&quot;. This close study of the Gothic (which he saw as the &quot;living form&quot;) left clear traces in his style. In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey, he was occasionally interrupted by boys from Westminster School, who were allowed in the Abbey. They teased him and one tormented him so much that Blake knocked the boy off a scaffold to the ground, &quot;upon which he fell with terrific Violence&quot;. After Blake complained to the Dean, the schoolboys&#x27; privilege was withdrawn. Blake claimed that he experienced visions in the Abbey. He saw Christ with his Apostles and a great procession of monks and priests, and heard their chant.

=== Royal Academy ===
On 8 October 1779, Blake became a student at the Royal Academy in Old Somerset House, near the Strand. While the terms of his study required no payment, he was expected to supply his own materials throughout the six-year period. There, he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as Rubens, championed by the school&#x27;s first president, Joshua Reynolds. Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds&#x27; attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of &quot;general truth&quot; and &quot;general beauty&quot;. Reynolds wrote in his &quot;Discourses&quot; that the &quot;disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind&quot;; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that &quot;To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit&quot;. Blake also disliked Reynolds&#x27; apparent humility, which he held to be a form of hypocrisy. Against Reynolds&#x27; fashionable oil painting, Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences, Michelangelo and Raphael.

David Bindman suggests that Blake&#x27;s antagonism towards Reynolds arose not so much from the president&#x27;s opinions (like Blake, Reynolds held history painting to be of greater value than landscape and portraiture), but rather &quot;against his hypocrisy in not putting his ideals into practice&quot;. Certainly Blake was not averse to exhibiting at the Royal Academy, submitting works on six occasions between 1780 and 1808.

Blake became a friend of John Flaxman, Thomas Stothard and George Cumberland during his first year at the Royal Academy. They shared radical views, with Stothard and Cumberland joining the Society for Constitutional Information.

=== Gordon Riots ===
Blake&#x27;s first biographer, Alexander Gilchrist, records that in June 1780 Blake was walking towards Basire&#x27;s shop in Great Queen Street when he was swept up by a rampaging mob that stormed Newgate Prison. The mob attacked the prison gates with shovels and pickaxes, set the building ablaze, and released the prisoners inside. Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack. The riots, in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism, became known as the Gordon Riots and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of George III, and the creation of the first police force.

== Marriage and collaboration with Catherine Boucher ==
In 1781 William met Catherine Boucher when he was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal. He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents, after which he asked Catherine: &quot;Do you pity me?&quot; When she responded affirmatively, he declared: &quot;Then I love you&quot;. William married Catherine, who was five years his junior, on 18 August 1782 in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Battersea. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an X. The original wedding certificate may be viewed at the church, where a commemorative stained-glass window was installed between 1976 and 1982. The marriage was successful and Catherine became William&#x27;s &quot;partner in both life and work&quot;, undertaking important roles as an engraver and colourist. According to the Tate Gallery, Catherine mixed and applied his paint colours. One of Catherine Blake&#x27;s most noted works is the colouring of the cover of the book &quot;.&quot; William Blake&#x27;s 1863 biographer, Alexander Gilchrist, wrote, &quot;The poet and his wife did everything in making the book - writing, designing, printing, engraving - everything except manufacturing the paper: the very ink, or colour rather, they did make.&quot; In 2019 Tate Britain&#x27;s Blake exhibition gave particular focus to Catherine Boucher&#x27;s role in William Blake&#x27;s work.

== Career ==
=== Early work ===

Around 1783, Blake&#x27;s first collection of poems, &quot;Poetical Sketches&quot;, was printed. In 1784, after his father&#x27;s death, Blake and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop. They began working with radical publisher Joseph Johnson. Johnson&#x27;s house was a meeting-place for some leading English intellectual dissidents of the time: theologian and scientist Joseph Priestley; philosopher Richard Price; artist John Henry Fuseli; early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft; and English-American revolutionary Thomas Paine. Along with William Wordsworth and William Godwin, Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a Phrygian cap in solidarity with the French revolutionaries, but despaired with the rise of Robespierre and the Reign of Terror in France. That same year, Blake composed his unfinished manuscript &quot;An Island in the Moon&quot; (1784).

Blake illustrated &quot;Original Stories from Real Life&quot; (2nd edition, 1791) by Mary Wollstonecraft. Although they seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage, no evidence is known that would prove that they had met. In &quot;Visions of the Daughters of Albion&quot; (1793), Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfilment.

From 1790 to 1800, William Blake lived in North Lambeth, London, at 13 Hercules Buildings, Hercules Road. The property was demolished in 1918, but the site is marked with a plaque. A series of 70 mosaics commemorates Blake in the nearby railway tunnels of Waterloo Station. The mosaics largely reproduce illustrations from Blake&#x27;s illuminated books, &quot;The Songs of Innocence and of Experience&quot;, &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;, and the prophetic books.

=== Relief etching ===
In 1788, aged 31, Blake experimented with relief etching, a method he used to produce most of his books, paintings, pamphlets and poems. The process is also referred to as illuminated printing, and the finished products as illuminated books or prints. Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes, using an acid-resistant medium. Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier illuminated manuscripts. He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name).

This is a reversal of the usual method of etching, where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid, and the plate printed by the intaglio method. Relief etching (which Blake referred to as &quot;stereotype&quot; in &quot;The Ghost of Abel&quot;) was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio. Stereotype, a process invented in 1725, consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving, but Blake&#x27;s innovation was, as described above, very different. The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in watercolours and stitched together to form a volume. Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works, including &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience&quot;, &quot;The Book of Thel&quot;, &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot; and &quot;Jerusalem&quot;.

=== Engravings ===

Although Blake has become better known for his relief etching, his commercial work largely consisted of intaglio engraving, the standard process of engraving in the 18th century in which the artist incised an image into the copper plate, a complex and laborious process, with plates taking months or years to complete, but as Blake&#x27;s contemporary, John Boydell, realised, such engraving offered a &quot;missing link with commerce&quot;, enabling artists to connect with a mass audience and became an immensely important activity by the end of the 18th century.

&quot;Europe Supported by Africa and America&quot; is an engraving by Blake held in the collection of the University of Arizona Museum of Art. The engraving was for a book written by Blake&#x27;s friend John Gabriel Stedman called &quot;The Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam&quot; (1796). It depicts three women embracing one another. Black Africa and White Europe hold hands in a gesture of equality, as the barren earth blooms beneath their feet. Europe wears a string of pearls, while her sisters Africa and America are depicted wearing slave bracelets. Some scholars have speculated that the bracelets represent the &quot;historical fact&quot; of slavery in Africa and the Americas while the handclasp refer to Stedman&#x27;s &quot;ardent wish&quot;: &quot;we only differ in color, but are certainly all created by the same Hand.&quot; Others have said it &quot;expresses the climate of opinion in which the questions of color and slavery were, at that time, being considered, and which Blake&#x27;s writings reflect.&quot;

Blake employed intaglio engraving in his own work, such as for his &quot;Illustrations of the Book of Job&quot;, completed just before his death. Most critical work has concentrated on Blake&#x27;s relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art, but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake&#x27;s surviving plates, including those for the Book of Job: they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as &quot;repoussage&quot;, a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate. Such techniques, typical of engraving work of the time, are very different from the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching, and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete.

== Later life ==

Blake&#x27;s marriage to Catherine was close and devoted until his death. Blake taught Catherine to write, and she helped him colour his printed poems. Gilchrist refers to &quot;stormy times&quot; in the early years of the marriage. Some biographers have suggested that Blake tried to bring a concubine into the marriage bed in accordance with the beliefs of the more radical branches of the Swedenborgian Society, but other scholars have dismissed these theories as conjecture.
In his Dictionary, Samuel Foster Damon suggests that Catherine may have had a stillborn daughter for which &quot;The Book of Thel&quot; is an elegy. That is how he rationalises the Book&#x27;s unusual ending, but notes that he is speculating.

=== Felpham ===
In 1800, Blake moved to a cottage at Felpham, in Sussex (now West Sussex), to take up a job illustrating the works of William Hayley, a minor poet. It was in this cottage that Blake began &quot;&quot; (the title page is dated 1804, but Blake continued to work on it until 1808). The preface to this work includes a poem beginning &quot;And did those feet in ancient time&quot;, which became the words for the anthem &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. Over time, Blake began to resent his new patron, believing that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry, and preoccupied with &quot;the meer drudgery of business&quot; (E724). Blake&#x27;s disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced &quot;Milton: a Poem&quot;, in which Blake wrote that &quot;Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies&quot;. (4:26, E98)

Blake&#x27;s trouble with authority came to a head in August 1803, when he was involved in a physical altercation with a soldier, John Schofield. Blake was charged not only with assault, but with uttering seditious and treasonable expressions against the king. Schofield claimed that Blake had exclaimed &quot;Damn the king. The soldiers are all slaves.&quot; Blake was cleared in the Chichester assizes of the charges. According to a report in the Sussex county paper, &quot;[T]he invented character of [the evidence] was ... so obvious that an acquittal resulted&quot;. Schofield was later depicted wearing &quot;mind forged manacles&quot; in an illustration to &quot;Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion&quot;.

=== Return to London ===
Blake returned to London in 1804 and began to write and illustrate &quot;Jerusalem&quot; (1804–20), his most ambitious work. Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, Blake approached the dealer Robert Cromek, with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake&#x27;s friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brother&#x27;s haberdashery shop at 27 Broad Street in Soho. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled &quot;The Canterbury Pilgrims&quot;), along with other works. As a result, he wrote his &quot;Descriptive Catalogue&quot; (1809), which contains what Anthony Blunt called a &quot;brilliant analysis&quot; of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism. It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings. The exhibition was very poorly attended, selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review, in &quot;The Examiner&quot;, was hostile.

Also around this time (circa 1808), Blake gave vigorous expression of his views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the &quot;Discourses&quot; of Sir Joshua Reynolds, denouncing the Royal Academy as a fraud and proclaiming, &quot;To Generalize is to be an Idiot&quot;.

In 1818, he was introduced by George Cumberland&#x27;s son to a young artist named John Linnell. A blue plaque commemorates Blake and Linnell at Old Wyldes&#x27; at North End, Hampstead. Through Linnell he met Samuel Palmer, who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the Shoreham Ancients. The group shared Blake&#x27;s rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age. Aged 65, Blake began work on illustrations for the &quot;Book of Job&quot;, later admired by Ruskin, who compared Blake favourably to Rembrandt, and by Vaughan Williams, who based his ballet &quot;&quot; on a selection of the illustrations.

In later life Blake began to sell a great number of his works, particularly his Bible illustrations, to Thomas Butts, a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit; this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life.
The commission for Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; came to Blake in 1826 through Linnell, with the aim of producing a series of engravings. Blake&#x27;s death in 1827 cut short the enterprise, and only a handful of watercolours were completed, with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form. Even so, they have earned praise:


Blake&#x27;s illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works, but rather seem to critically revise, or furnish commentary on, certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text.

Because the project was never completed, Blake&#x27;s intent may be obscured. Some indicators bolster the impression that Blake&#x27;s illustrations in their totality would take issue with the text they accompany: in the margin of &quot;Homer Bearing the Sword and His Companions&quot;, Blake notes, &quot;Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All &amp; the Goddess Nature &amp; not the Holy Ghost.&quot; Blake seems to dissent from Dante&#x27;s admiration of the poetic works of ancient Greece, and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell (as evidenced by the grim humour of the cantos).

At the same time, Blake shared Dante&#x27;s distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante&#x27;s work pictorially. Even as he seemed to be near death, Blake&#x27;s central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;; he is said to have spent one of the last shillings he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching.

== Final years ==


Blake&#x27;s last years were spent at Fountain Court off the Strand (the property was demolished in the 1880s, when the Savoy Hotel was built). On the day of his death (12 August 1827), Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series. Eventually, it is reported, he ceased working and turned to his wife, who was in tears by his bedside. Beholding her, Blake is said to have cried, &quot;Stay Kate! Keep just as you are – I will draw your portrait – for you have ever been an angel to me.&quot; Having completed this portrait (now lost), Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses. At six that evening, after promising his wife that he would be with her always, Blake died. Gilchrist reports that a female lodger in the house, present at his expiration, said, &quot;I have been at the death, not of a man, but of a blessed angel.&quot;

George Richmond gives the following account of Blake&#x27;s death in a letter to Samuel Palmer:

Catherine paid for Blake&#x27;s funeral with money lent to her by Linnell. Blake&#x27;s body was buried in a plot shared with others, five days after his death – on the eve of his 45th wedding anniversary – at the Dissenter&#x27;s burial ground in Bunhill Fields, that became the London Borough of Islington. His parents&#x27; bodies were buried in the same graveyard. Present at the ceremonies were Catherine, Edward Calvert, George Richmond, Frederick Tatham and John Linnell. Following Blake&#x27;s death, Catherine moved into Tatham&#x27;s house as a housekeeper. She believed she was regularly visited by Blake&#x27;s spirit. She continued selling his illuminated works and paintings, but entertained no business transaction without first &quot;consulting Mr. Blake&quot;. On the day of her death, in October 1831, she was as calm and cheerful as her husband, and called out to him &quot;as if he were only in the next room, to say she was coming to him, and it would not be long now.&quot;

On her death, longtime acquaintance Frederick Tatham took possession of Blake&#x27;s works and continued selling them. Tatham later joined the fundamentalist Irvingite church and under the influence of conservative members of that church burned manuscripts that he deemed heretical. The exact number of destroyed manuscripts is unknown, but shortly before his death Blake told a friend he had written &quot;twenty tragedies as long as &quot;Macbeth&quot;&quot;, none of which survive. Another acquaintance, William Michael Rossetti, also burned works by Blake that he considered lacking in quality, and John Linnell erased sexual imagery from a number of Blake&#x27;s drawings. At the same time, some works not intended for publication were preserved by friends, such as his notebook and &quot;An Island in the Moon&quot;.

Blake&#x27;s grave is commemorated by two stones. The first was a stone that reads &quot;Near by lie the remains of the poet-painter William Blake 1757–1827 and his wife Catherine Sophia 1762–1831&quot;. The memorial stone is situated approximately away from the actual grave, which was not marked until 12 August 2018. For years since 1965, the exact location of William Blake&#x27;s grave had been lost and forgotten. The area had been damaged in the Second World War; gravestones were removed and a garden was created. The memorial stone, indicating that the burial sites are &quot;nearby&quot;, was listed as a Grade II listed structure in 2011. A Portuguese couple, Carol and Luís Garrido, rediscovered the exact burial location after 14 years of investigatory work, and the Blake Society organised a permanent memorial slab, which was unveiled at a public ceremony at the site on 12 August 2018. The new stone is inscribed &quot;Here lies William Blake 1757–1827 Poet Artist Prophet&quot; above a verse from his poem &quot;Jerusalem&quot;.

The Blake Prize for Religious Art was established in his honour in Australia in 1949. In 1957 a memorial to Blake and his wife was erected in Westminster Abbey. Another memorial lies in St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly, where he was baptised.
At the time of Blake&#x27;s death, he had sold fewer than 30 copies of &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience.&quot;

==Opinions ==
=== Politics ===
Blake was not active in any well-established political party. His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman&#x27;s major study &quot;&quot; (1954). Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the Industrial Revolution. Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions. Erdman claims Blake was disillusioned with the political outcomes of the conflicts, believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism. Erdman also notes Blake was deeply opposed to slavery and believes some of his poems, read primarily as championing &quot;free love&quot;, had their anti-slavery implications short-changed. A more recent study, &quot;William Blake: Visionary Anarchist&quot; by Peter Marshall (1988), classified Blake and his contemporary William Godwin as forerunners of modern anarchism. British Marxist historian E. P. Thompson&#x27;s last finished work, &quot;Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law&quot; (1993), claims to show how far he was inspired by dissident religious ideas rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the English Civil War.

=== Development of views ===

Because Blake&#x27;s later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism, his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work. The Vintage anthology of Blake edited by Patti Smith focuses heavily on the earlier work, as do many critical studies such as &quot;William Blake&quot; by D. G. Gillham.

The earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protest against dogmatic religion especially notable in &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;, in which the figure represented by the &quot;Devil&quot; is virtually a hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity. In later works, such as &quot;Milton&quot; and &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self-sacrifice and forgiveness, while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion. Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake&#x27;s earlier and later works.

Psychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake&#x27;s late work displayed a development of the ideas first introduced in his earlier works, namely, the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit. The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study &quot;The Unholy Bible&quot; suggests the later works are the &quot;Bible of Hell&quot; promised in &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;. Regarding Blake&#x27;s final poem, &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, she writes: &quot;The promise of the divine in man, made in &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;, is at last fulfilled.&quot;

John Middleton Murry notes discontinuity between &quot;Marriage&quot; and the late works, in that while the early Blake focused on a &quot;sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason&quot;, the later Blake emphasised the notions of self-sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness. This renunciation of the sharper dualism of &quot;Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot; is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of Urizen in the later works. Murry characterises the later Blake as having found &quot;mutual understanding&quot; and &quot;mutual forgiveness&quot;.

=== Religious views ===

Regarding conventional religion, Blake was a satirist and ironist in his viewpoints which are illustrated and summarised in his poem Vala, or The Four Zoas, one of his uncompleted prophetic books begun in 1797. The demi-mythological and demi-religious main characters of the book are the Four Zoas (Urthona, Urizen, Luvah and Tharmas), who were created by the fall of Albion in Blake&#x27;s mythology. It consists of nine books, referred to as &quot;nights&quot;. These outline the interactions of the Zoas, their fallen forms and their Emanations. Blake intended the book to be a summation of his mythic universe. Blake&#x27;s Four Zoas, which represent four aspects of the Almighty God and &quot;Vala&quot; is the first work to mention them. In particular, Blake&#x27;s God/Man union is broken down into the bodily components of Urizen (head), Urthona (loins), Luvah (heart), and Tharmas (unity of the body) with paired Emanations being Ahania (wisdom, from the head), Enitharmon (what can&#x27;t be attained in nature, from the loins), Vala (nature, from the heart), and Enion (earth mother, from the separation of unity). As connected to Blake&#x27;s understanding of the divine, the Zoas are the God the Father (Tharmas, sense), the Son of God (Luvah, love), the Holy Ghost (Urthona, imagination), and Satan who was originally of the divine substance (Urizen, reason) and their Emanations represent Sexual Urges (Enion), Nature (Vala), Inspiration (Enitharmon), and Pleasure (Ahania).

Blake believed that each person had a twofold identity with one half being good and the other evil. In &quot;Vala&quot;, both the character Orc and The Eternal Man discuss their selves as divided. By the time he was working on his later works, including &quot;Vala&quot;, Blake felt that he was able to overcome his inner battle but he was concerned about losing his artistic abilities. These thoughts carried over into &quot;Vala&quot; as the character Los (imagination) is connected to the image of Christ, and he added a Christian element to his mythic world. In the revised version of &quot;Vala&quot;, Blake added Christian and Hebrew images and describes how Los experiences a vision of the Lamb of God that regenerates Los&#x27;s spirit. In opposition to Christ is Urizen and the Synagogue of Satan, who later crucifies Christ. It is from them that Deism is born.
Blake did not subscribe to the notion of a body distinct from the soul that must submit to the rule of the soul, but sees the body as an extension of the soul, derived from the &quot;discernment&quot; of the senses. Thus, the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul. Elsewhere, he describes Satan as the &quot;state of error&quot;, and as beyond salvation.

Blake opposed the sophistry of theological thought that excuses pain, admits evil and apologises for injustice. He abhorred self-denial, which he associated with religious repression and particularly sexual repression:
&lt;poem&gt;
Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity.
He who desires but acts not breeds . (7.4–5, E35)&lt;/poem&gt;
He saw the concept of &quot;sin&quot; as a trap to bind men&#x27;s desires (the briars of &quot;Garden of Love&quot;), and believed that restraint in obedience to a moral code imposed from the outside was against the spirit of life:
&lt;poem&gt;
Abstinence sows sand all over
The ruddy limbs &amp; flaming hair
But Desire Gratified
Plants fruits &amp; beauty there. (E474)
&lt;/poem&gt;

He did not hold with the doctrine of God as Lord, an entity separate from and superior to mankind; this is shown clearly in his words about Jesus Christ: &quot;He is the only God ... and so am I, and so are you.&quot; A telling phrase in &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot; is &quot;men forgot that All deities reside in the human breast&quot;.

== Enlightenment philosophy ==
Blake had a complex relationship with Enlightenment philosophy. His championing of the imagination as the most important element of human existence ran contrary to Enlightenment ideals of rationalism and empiricism. Due to his visionary religious beliefs, he opposed the Newtonian view of the universe. This mindset is reflected in an excerpt from Blake&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
I turn my eyes to the Schools &amp; Universities of Europe
And there behold the Loom of Locke whose Woof rages dire
Washd by the Water-wheels of Newton. black the cloth
In heavy wreathes folds over every Nation; cruel Works
Of many Wheels I view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic
Moving by compulsion each other: not as those in Eden: which
Wheel within Wheel in freedom revolve in harmony &amp; peace. (15.14–20, E159)
&lt;/poem&gt;

Blake believed the paintings of Sir Joshua Reynolds, which depict the naturalistic fall of light upon objects, were products entirely of the &quot;vegetative eye&quot;, and he saw Locke and Newton as &quot;the true progenitors of Sir Joshua Reynolds&#x27; aesthetic&quot;. The popular taste in the England of that time for such paintings was satisfied with mezzotints, prints produced by a process that created an image from thousands of tiny dots upon the page. Blake saw an analogy between this and Newton&#x27;s particle theory of light. Accordingly, Blake never used the technique, opting rather to develop a method of engraving purely in fluid line, insisting that:

It has been supposed that, despite his opposition to Enlightenment principles, Blake arrived at a linear aesthetic that was in many ways more similar to the Neoclassical engravings of John Flaxman than to the works of the Romantics, with whom he is often classified. However, Blake&#x27;s relationship with Flaxman seems to have grown more distant after Blake&#x27;s return from Felpham, and there are surviving letters between Flaxman and Hayley wherein Flaxman speaks ill of Blake&#x27;s theories of art. Blake further criticised Flaxman&#x27;s styles and theories of art in his responses to criticism made against his print of Chaucer&#x27;s Caunterbury Pilgrims in 1810.

== Sexuality ==

=== &quot;Free Love&quot; ===

Since his death, Blake has been claimed by those of various movements who apply his complex and often elusive use of symbolism and allegory to the issues that concern them. In particular, Blake is sometimes considered (along with Mary Wollstonecraft and her husband William Godwin) a forerunner of the 19th-century &quot;free love&quot; movement, a broad reform tradition starting in the 1820s that held that marriage is slavery, and advocated the removal of all state restrictions on sexual activity such as homosexuality, prostitution, and adultery, culminating in the birth control movement of the early 20th century. Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century, although it is still mentioned by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsjö who moderately challenges this interpretation. The 19th-century &quot;free love&quot; movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners, but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state-sanctioned marriage was &quot;legal prostitution&quot; and monopolistic in character. It has somewhat more in common with early feminist movements (particularly with regard to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, whom Blake admired).

Blake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue. At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine&#x27;s apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house. His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection, and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws. Poems such as &quot;Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?&quot; and &quot;Earth&#x27;s Answer&quot; seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem &quot;London&quot; he speaks of &quot;the Marriage-Hearse&quot; plagued by &quot;the youthful Harlot&#x27;s curse&quot;, the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. &quot;Visions of the Daughters of Albion&quot; is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the &quot;frozen marriage-bed&quot;. In &quot;Visions&quot;, Blake writes:

&lt;poem&gt;
Till she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound
In spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain
Of life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the 19th century, poet and free love advocate Algernon Charles Swinburne wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises &quot;sacred natural love&quot; that is not bound by another&#x27;s possessive jealousy, the latter characterised by Blake as a &quot;creeping skeleton&quot;. Swinburne notes how Blake&#x27;s &quot;Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot; condemns the hypocrisy of the &quot;pale religious letchery&quot; of advocates of traditional norms. Another 19th-century free love advocate, Edward Carpenter (1844–1929), was influenced by Blake&#x27;s mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions.

In the early 20th century, Pierre Berger described how Blake&#x27;s views echo Mary Wollstonecraft&#x27;s celebration of joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty, the former being the true measure of purity. Irene Langridge notes that &quot;in Blake&#x27;s mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of &#x27;the soul&#x27;.&quot; Michael Davis&#x27; 1977 book &quot;William Blake a New Kind of Man&quot; suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity, condemning him to a frozen death.

As a theological writer, Blake has a sense of human &quot;fallenness&quot;. S. Foster Damon noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication. Thomas Wright&#x27;s 1928 book &quot;Life of William Blake&quot; (entirely devoted to Blake&#x27;s doctrine of free love) notes that Blake thinks marriage should &quot;in practice&quot; afford the joy of love, but notes that in reality it often does not, as a couple&#x27;s knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy. Pierre Berger also analyses Blake&#x27;s early mythological poems such as &quot;Ahania&quot; as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity, as these are born from pride and jealousy.

Some scholars have noted that Blake&#x27;s views on &quot;free love&quot; are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years. Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as &quot;The Sick Rose&quot;. Magnus Ankarsjö notes that while the hero of &quot;Visions of the Daughters of Albion&quot; is a strong advocate of free love, by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown, crying &quot;Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water?&quot; Ankarsjö also notes that a major inspiration to Blake, Mary Wollstonecraft, similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life. In light of Blake&#x27;s aforementioned sense of human &#x27;fallenness&#x27; Ankarsjö thinks Blake does &quot;not&quot; fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha, since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained. Ankarsjö records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners, though David Worrall read &quot;The Book of Thel&quot; as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church.

Blake&#x27;s later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity, and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure, there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems, and there is advocacy of &quot;self-denial&quot;, though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion. Berger (more so than Swinburne) is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake. Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses, and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self. Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems (most notably in Blake&#x27;s denial of the virginity of Jesus&#x27;s mother). However, the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness, redemption, and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships.

== Legacy ==

=== Creativity ===
Northrop Frye, commenting on Blake&#x27;s consistency in strongly held views, notes that Blake himself says that his notes on [Joshua] Reynolds, written at fifty, are &#x27;exactly Similar&#x27; to those on Locke and Bacon, written when he was &#x27;very Young&#x27;. Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later. Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles ... Consistency, then, foolish or otherwise, is one of Blake&#x27;s chief preoccupations, just as &#x27;self-contradiction&#x27; is always one of his most contemptuous comments.
Blake abhorred slavery, and believed in racial and sexual equality. Several of his poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: &quot;As all men are alike (tho&#x27; infinitely various)&quot;. In one poem, narrated by a black child, white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds, which exist only until one learns &quot;to bear the beams of love&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;
When I from black and he from white cloud free,
And round the tent of God like lambs we joy:
Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear,
To lean in joy upon our fathers knee.
And then I&#x27;ll stand and stroke his silver hair,
And be like him and he will then love me. (23-8, E9)
&lt;/poem&gt;

Blake retained an active interest in social and political events throughout his life, and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism. His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church. His spiritual beliefs are evident in &quot;Songs of Experience&quot; (1794), in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God, whose restrictions he rejected, and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence.

=== Visions ===
From a young age, William Blake claimed to have seen visions. The first may have occurred as early as the age of four when, according to one anecdote, the young artist &quot;saw God&quot; when God &quot;put his head to the window&quot;, causing Blake to break into screaming. At the age of eight or ten in Peckham Rye, London, Blake claimed to have seen &quot;a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars.&quot; According to Blake&#x27;s Victorian biographer Gilchrist, he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake&#x27;s early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber. On another occasion, Blake watched haymakers at work, and thought he saw angelic figures walking among them.

Blake claimed to experience visions throughout his life. They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery, and may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits. Certainly, religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blake&#x27;s works. God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings, from which he drew inspiration. Blake believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by Archangels to create his artistic works, which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels. In a letter of condolence to William Hayley, dated 6 May 1800, four days after the death of Hayley&#x27;s son, Blake wrote:

In a letter to John Flaxman, dated 21 September 1800, Blake wrote:

In a letter to Thomas Butts, dated 25 April 1803, Blake wrote:

In &quot;A Vision of the Last Judgement&quot; Blake wrote:

Despite seeing angels and God, Blake has also claimed to have seen Satan on the staircase of his South Molton Street home in London.

Aware of Blake&#x27;s visions, William Wordsworth commented, &quot;There was no doubt that this poor man was mad, but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter Scott.&quot; In a more deferential vein, John William Cousins wrote in &quot;A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature&quot; that Blake was &quot;a truly pious and loving soul, neglected and misunderstood by the world, but appreciated by an elect few&quot;, who &quot;led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations&quot;. Blake&#x27;s sanity was called into question as recently as the publication of the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, whose entry on Blake comments that &quot;the question whether Blake was or was not mad seems likely to remain in dispute, but there can be no doubt whatever that he was at different periods of his life under the influence of illusions for which there are no outward facts to account, and that much of what he wrote is so far wanting in the quality of sanity as to be without a logical coherence&quot;.

=== Cultural influence ===
Blake&#x27;s work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten by the time Alexander Gilchrist began work on his biography in the 1860s. The publication of the &quot;Life of William Blake&quot; rapidly transformed Blake&#x27;s reputation, in particular as he was taken up by Pre-Raphaelites and associated figures, in particular Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne. In the 20th century, however, Blake&#x27;s work was fully appreciated and his influence increased. Important early and mid-20th-century scholars involved in enhancing Blake&#x27;s standing in literary and artistic circles included S. Foster Damon, Geoffrey Keynes, Northrop Frye and David V. Erdman.

While Blake had a significant role in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti, it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists. William Butler Yeats, who edited an edition of Blake&#x27;s collected works in 1893, drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas, while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake&#x27;s conceptions of non-mimetic, visionary practice in the painting of artists such as Paul Nash and Graham Sutherland. 

His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers, who set his works. The earliest such work known is Doyne Bell&#x27;s setting of the poem &quot;Can I see another&#x27;s woe&quot;, from &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience&quot;, published in 1876. Notable settings are by Benjamin Britten and Ralph Vaughan Williams, and John Tavener set several of Blake&#x27;s poems, including &quot;The Lamb&quot; (as the 1982 work &quot;The Lamb&quot;) and &quot;The Tyger&quot;.

Many such as June Singer have argued that Blake&#x27;s thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst Carl Jung. In Jung&#x27;s own words: &quot;Blake [is] a tantalizing study, since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my ideas they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes.&quot; Similarly, Diana Hume George claimed that Blake can be seen as a precursor to the ideas of Sigmund Freud.

Blake had an enormous influence on the beat poets of the 1950s and the counterculture of the 1960s, frequently being cited by such seminal figures as beat poet Allen Ginsberg, songwriters Bob Dylan, Richard Ashcroft, Jim Morrison, Van Morrison, Bruce Dickinson, and English writer Aldous Huxley. The Pulitzer-winning composer William Bolcom set &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience&quot; to music, with different poems set to different styles of music, &quot;from modern techniques to Broadway to Country/Western&quot; and reggae.

Much of the central conceit of Philip Pullman&#x27;s fantasy trilogy &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; is rooted in the world of Blake&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;. Blake also features as a relatively significant character in Brian Catling&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Erstwhile&quot;, where his visions of angelic beings are figured into the story. Canadian music composer Kathleen Yearwood is one of many contemporary musicians that have set Blake&#x27;s poems to music. After World War II, Blake&#x27;s role in popular culture came to the fore in a variety of areas such as popular music, film, and the graphic novel, leading Edward Larrissy to assert that &quot;Blake is the Romantic writer who has exerted the most powerful influence on the twentieth century.&quot;

== Exhibitions ==
Major recent exhibitions focusing on William Blake include:
* The Ashmolean Museum&#x27;s (Oxford) exhibition &quot;William Blake: Apprentice and Master&quot;, open from December 2014 until March 2015, examined William Blake&#x27;s formation as an artist, as well as his influence on young artist-printmakers who gathered around him in the last years of his life.
* The National Gallery of Victoria&#x27;s exhibition &quot;William Blake&quot; in summer 2014 showcased the Gallery&#x27;s collection of works by William Blake which includes spectacular watercolours, single prints and illustrated books.

<doc id="33176" wikidata="Q5256229" url="?curid=33176" title="Demon dialing">
<text>In the computer hacking scene of the 1980s, demon dialing was a technique by which a computer was used to repeatedly dial a number (usually to a crowded modem pool) in an attempt to gain access immediately after another user had hung up. The expansion of accessible internet service provider connectivity since that time has rendered the practice more or less obsolete.

A similar technique was sometimes used to get the first call for prizes in radio &quot;call-in&quot; shows, thus leading to the adoption of random &quot;fifth caller,&quot; &quot;seventeenth caller&quot; etc. by radio stations to circumvent this practice.

The term &quot;demon dialing&quot; derives from the Demon Dialer product from Zoom Telephonics, Inc., a telephone device produced in the 1980s which repeatedly dialed busy telephone numbers under control of an extension phone. The emergence of affordable consumer telephony devices with advanced features such as last number redial and preprogrammed numbers paralleled phone industry deregulation and the Breakup of the Bell System in the early 1980s. While Speed dial technology had been invented nearly a decade earlier by Bell Labs, it did not become a consumer product until deregulation. Previously, connecting non-AT&amp;T handsets was generally prohibited and most phones were leased devices (similar to residential broadband routers). By putting its functionally in a line-connected appliance rather than a handset, the Demon Dialer device could be configured to provide speed dialing to all extensions within a residence through touch tone control.

&quot;Demon dialing&quot; was popularized by the movie &quot;WarGames&quot;, which demonstrates the hacking technique (the technique eventually evolves into a technique called phreaking). After giving the program an area code and 3 digit prefix, the program then serially dialed every phone number in that prefix in order, recording which phone numbers were answered by a computer modem. Soon after, most likely because it was popularized by the movie, serial dialing was outlawed. Hackers got around this by simply randomizing the order the program dialed all the numbers. Later the terms &quot;demon dialing&quot; and &quot;war dialing&quot; became synonymous.

==Similar technologies==
Automatic redial is essentially exactly the same thing, but for modems, and included in most telecommunications programs that use modems, including all variants of Dial-up networking ever included in the Windows operating system.

<doc id="33178" wikidata="Q698752" url="?curid=33178" title="White supremacy">
<text>White supremacy is the belief that white people are superior to those of other races and thus should dominate them. The belief favors the maintenance and defense of any power and privilege held by white people. White supremacy has roots in the now-discredited doctrine of scientific racism and was a key justification for European colonialism.

As a political ideology, it imposes and maintains cultural, social, political, historical or institutional domination by white people and non-white supporters. In the past, this ideology had been put into effect through socioeconomic and legal structures such as the Atlantic slave trade, European colonial labor and social practices, the Scramble for Africa, Jim Crow laws in the United States, the activities of the Native Land Court in New Zealand, the White Australia policies from the 1890s to the mid-1970s, and apartheid in South Africa. This ideology is also today present among neo-Confederates.

White supremacy underlies a spectrum of contemporary movements including white nationalism, white separatism, neo-Nazism, and the Christian Identity movement. In the United States, white supremacy is primarily associated with the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), Aryan Nations, and the White American Resistance movement, all of which are also considered to be antisemitic. The Proud Boys, despite claiming non-association with white supremacy, have been described in academic contexts as being such. In recent years, websites such as Twitter (known as X since July 2023), Reddit, and Stormfront, and the first campaign and presidency of Donald Trump, have contributed to an increased activity and interest in white supremacy.

Different forms of white supremacy have different conceptions of who is considered white (though the exemplar is generally light-skinned, blond-haired, and blue-eyed — traits most common in northern Europe and that are viewed pseudoscientifically as being traits of an Aryan race), and not all white-supremacist organizations agree on who is their greatest enemy. Different groups of white supremacists identify various racial, ethnic, religious, and other enemies, most commonly those of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, Indigenous peoples of the Americas and Oceania, Asians, multiracial people, Middle Eastern people, Jews, Muslims, and LGBTQ+ people.

In academic usage, particularly in critical race theory or intersectionality, &quot;white supremacy&quot; can also refer to a social system in which white people enjoy structural advantages (privilege) over other ethnic groups, on both a collective and individual level, despite formal legal equality.

==History==
White supremacy has ideological foundations that date back to 17th-century scientific racism, the predominant paradigm of human variation that helped shape international relations and racial policy from the latter part of the Age of Enlightenment until the late 20th century (marked by decolonization and the abolition of apartheid in South Africa in 1991, followed by that country&#x27;s first multiracial elections in 1994).

===United States===



==== Early history ====
White supremacy was dominant in the United States both before and after the American Civil War, and it persisted for decades after the Reconstruction Era. The Virginia Slave Codes of 1705 socially segregated white colonists from black enslaved persons, making them disparate groups and hindering their ability to unite. Unity of the commoners was a perceived fear of the Virginia aristocracy, who wished to prevent repeated events such as Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion, occurring 29 years prior. Prior to the Civil War, many wealthy white Americans owned slaves; they tried to justify their economic exploitation of black people by creating a &quot;scientific&quot; theory of white superiority and black inferiority. One such slave owner, future president Thomas Jefferson, wrote in 1785 that blacks were &quot;inferior to the whites in the endowments of body and mind.&quot; In the antebellum South, four million slaves were denied freedom. The outbreak of the Civil War saw the desire to uphold white supremacy being cited as a cause for state secession and the formation of the Confederate States of America. In an 1890 editorial about Native Americans and the American Indian Wars, author L. Frank Baum wrote: &quot;The Whites, by law of conquest, by justice of civilization, are masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few remaining Indians.&quot;

The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited U.S. citizenship to whites only. In some parts of the United States, many people who were considered non-white were disenfranchised, barred from government office, and prevented from holding most government jobs well into the second half of the 20th century. Professor Leland T. Saito of the University of Southern California writes: &quot;Throughout the history of the United States, race has been used by whites for legitimizing and creating difference and social, economic and political exclusion.&quot;

==== 20th century ====
The denial of social and political freedom to minorities continued into the mid-20th century, resulting in the civil rights movement. The movement was spurred by the lynching of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old boy. David Jackson writes it was the image of the &quot;murdered child&#x27;s ravaged body, that forced the world to reckon with the brutality of American racism.&quot; Vann R. Newkirk II wrote &quot;the trial of his killers became a pageant illuminating the tyranny of white supremacy.&quot; Moved by the image of Till&#x27;s body in the casket, one hundred days after his murder Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person.

Sociologist Stephen Klineberg has stated that U.S. immigration laws prior to 1965 clearly &quot;declared that Northern Europeans are a superior subspecies of the white race&quot;. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 opened entry to the U.S. to non-Germanic groups, and significantly altered the demographic mix in the U.S. as a result. With 38 U.S. states having banned interracial marriage through anti-miscegenation laws, the last 16 states had such laws in place until 1967 when they were invalidated by the Supreme Court of the United States&#x27; decision in &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot;. These mid-century gains had a major impact on white Americans&#x27; political views; segregation and white racial superiority, which had been publicly endorsed in the 1940s, became minority views within the white community by the mid-1970s, and continued to decline in 1990s&#x27; polls to a single-digit percentage. For sociologist Howard Winant, these shifts marked the end of &quot;monolithic white supremacy&quot; in the United States.

After the mid-1960s, white supremacy remained an important ideology to the American far-right. According to Kathleen Belew, a historian of race and racism in the United States, white militancy shifted after the Vietnam War from supporting the existing racial order to a more radical position (self-described as &quot;white power&quot; or &quot;white nationalism&quot;) committed to overthrowing the United States government and establishing a white homeland. Such anti-government militia organizations are one of three major strands of violent right-wing movements in the United States, with white-supremacist groups (such as the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazi organizations, and racist skinheads) and a religious fundamentalist movement (such as Christian Identity) being the other two. Howard Winant writes that, &quot;On the far right the cornerstone of white identity is belief in an ineluctable, unalterable racialized difference between whites and nonwhites.&quot; In the view of philosopher Jason Stanley, white supremacy in the United States is an example of the fascist politics of hierarchy, in that it &quot;demands and implies a perpetual hierarchy&quot; in which whites dominate and control non-whites.

==== 21st century ====
The presidential campaign of Donald Trump led to a surge of interest in white supremacy and white nationalism in the United States, bringing increased media attention and new members to their movement; his campaign enjoyed their widespread support.

Some academics argue that outcomes from the 2016 United States Presidential Election reflect ongoing challenges with white supremacy. Psychologist Janet Helms suggested that the normalizing behaviors of social institutions of education, government, and healthcare are organized around the &quot;birthright of...the power to control society&#x27;s resources and determine the rules for [those resources]&quot;. Educators, literary theorists, and other political experts have raised similar questions, connecting the scapegoating of disenfranchised populations to white superiority.

As of 2018, there were over 600 white-supremacist organizations recorded in the U.S. On July 23, 2019, Christopher A. Wray, the head of the FBI, said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that the agency had made around 100 domestic terrorism arrests since October 1, 2018, and that the majority of them were connected in some way with white supremacy. Wray said that the Bureau was &quot;aggressively pursuing [domestic terrorism] using both counterterrorism resources and criminal investigative resources and partnering closely with our state and local partners,&quot; but said that it was focused on the violence itself and not on its ideological basis. A similar number of arrests had been made for instances of international terrorism. In the past, Wray has said that white supremacy was a significant and &quot;pervasive&quot; threat to the U.S.

On September 20, 2019, the acting Secretary of Homeland Security, Kevin McAleenan, announced his department&#x27;s revised strategy for counter-terrorism, which included a new emphasis on the dangers inherent in the white-supremacy movement. McAleenan called white supremacy one of the most &quot;potent ideologies&quot; behind domestic terrorism-related violent acts. In a speech at the Brookings Institution, McAleenan cited a series of high-profile shooting incidents, and said &quot;In our modern age, the continued menace of racially based violent extremism, particularly white supremacist extremism, is an abhorrent affront to the nation, the struggle and unity of its diverse population.&quot; The new strategy will include better tracking and analysis of threats, sharing information with local officials, training local law enforcement on how to deal with shooting events, discouraging the hosting of hate sites online, and encouraging counter-messages.

In a 2020 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; titled &quot;How White Women Use Themselves as Instruments of Terror&quot;, columnist Charles M. Blow wrote:

==== Patterns of influence ====

===== Political violence =====
The Tuskegee Institute has estimated that 3,446 blacks were the victims of lynchings in the United States between 1882 and 1968, with the peak occurring in the 1890s at a time of economic stress in the South and increasing political suppression of blacks. If 1,297 whites were also lynched during this period, blacks were disproportionally targeted, representing 72.7% of all people lynched. According to scholar Amy L. Wood, &quot;lynching photographs constructed and perpetuated white supremacist ideology by creating permanent images of a controlled white citizenry juxtaposed to images of helpless and powerless black men.&quot;

===== School curriculum =====
White supremacy has also played a part in U.S. school curriculum. Over the course of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, material across the spectrum of academic disciplines has been taught with a heavy emphasis on white culture, contributions, and experiences, and a lack of representation of non-white groups&#x27; perspectives and accomplishments. In the 19th century, Geography lessons contained teachings on a fixed racial hierarchy, which white people topped. Mills (1994) writes that history as it is taught is really the history of white people, and it is taught in a way that favors white Americans and white people in general. He states that the language used to tell history minimizes the violent acts committed by white people over the centuries, citing the use of the words, for example, &quot;discovery,&quot; &quot;colonization,&quot; and &quot;New World&quot; when describing what was ultimately a European conquest of the Western Hemisphere and its indigenous peoples. Swartz (1992) seconds this reading of modern history narratives when it comes to the experiences, resistances, and accomplishments of black Americans throughout the Middle Passage, slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, and the civil rights movement. In an analysis of American history textbooks, she highlights word choices that repetitively &quot;normalize&quot; slavery and the inhumane treatment of black people. She also notes the frequent showcasing of white abolitionists and actual exclusion of black abolitionists and the fact that black Americans had been mobilizing for abolition for centuries before the major white American push for abolition in the 19th century. She ultimately asserts the presence of a &quot;masternarrative&quot; that centers Europe and its associated peoples (white people) in school curriculum, particularly as it pertains to history. She writes that this masternarrative condenses history into only history that is relevant to, and to some extent beneficial for, white Americans.

Elson (1964) provides detailed information about the historic dissemination of simplistic and negative ideas about non-white races. Native Americans, who were subjected to attempts of cultural genocide by the U.S. government through the use of American Indian boarding schools, were characterized as homogenously &quot;cruel,&quot; a violent menace toward white Americans, and lacking civilization or societal complexity (p. 74). For example, in the 19th century, black Americans were consistently portrayed as lazy, immature, and intellectually and morally inferior to white Americans, and in many ways not deserving of equal participation in U.S. society. For example, a math problem in a 19th-century textbook read, &quot;If 5 white men can do as much work as 7 negroes...&quot; implying that white men are more industrious and competent than black men (p. 99). In addition, little to nothing was taught about black Americans&#x27; contributions, or their histories before being brought to U.S. soil as slaves. According to Wayne (1972), this approach was taken especially much after the Civil War to maintain whites&#x27; hegemony over emancipated black Americans. Other racial groups have received oppressive treatment, including Mexican Americans, who temporarily were prevented from learning the same curriculum as white Americans because they supposedly were intellectually inferior, and Asian Americans, some of whom were prevented from learning much about their ancestral lands because they were deemed a threat to &quot;American&quot; culture, i.e. white culture, at the turn of the 20th century.

===== Role of the internet =====
With the emergence of Twitter in 2006, and platforms such as &quot;Stormfront&quot;, which was launched in 1996, an alt-right portal for white supremacists with similar beliefs, both adults and children, was provided in which they were given a way to connect. Jessie Daniels, of CUNY-Hunter College, discussed the emergence of other social media outlets such as 4chan and Reddit, which meant that the &quot;spread of white nationalist symbols and ideas could be accelerated and amplified.&quot; Sociologist Kathleen Blee notes that the anonymity which the Internet provides can make it difficult to track the extent of white-supremacist activity in the country, but nevertheless she and other experts see an increase in the number of hate crimes and amount of white-supremacist violence. In the latest wave of white supremacy, in the age of the Internet, Blee sees the movement as having become primarily a virtual one, in which divisions between groups become blurred: &quot;[A]ll these various groups that get jumbled together as the alt-right and people who have come in from the more traditional neo-Nazi world. We&#x27;re in a very different world now.&quot;

David Duke, a former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, wrote in 1999 that the Internet was going to create a &quot;chain reaction of racial enlightenment that will shake the world.&quot; Daniels documents that racist groups see the Internet as a way to spread their ideologies, influence others and gain supporters. Legal scholar Richard Hasen describes a &quot;dark side&quot; of social media:

There certainly were hate groups before the Internet and social media. [But with social media] it just becomes easier to organize, to spread the word, for people to know where to go. It could be to raise money, or it could be to engage in attacks on social media. Some of the activity is virtual. Some of it is in a physical place. Social media has lowered the collective-action problems that individuals who might want to be in a hate group would face. You can see that there are people out there like you. That&#x27;s the dark side of social media.

A series on YouTube hosted by the grandson of Thomas Robb, the national director of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, &quot;presents the Klan&#x27;s ideology in a format aimed at kids — more specifically, white kids.&quot; The short episodes inveigh against race-mixing, and extol other white-supremacist ideologies. A short documentary published by TRT describes Imran Garda&#x27;s experience, a journalist of Indian descent, who met with Thomas Robb and a traditional KKK group. A sign that greets people who enter the town states &quot;Diversity is a code for white genocide.&quot; The KKK group interviewed in the documentary summarizes its ideals, principles, and beliefs, which are emblematic of white supremacists in the United States. The comic book super hero Captain America was used for dog whistle politics by the alt-right in college campus recruitment in 2017, an ironic co-optation because Captain America battled against Nazis in the comics, and was created by Jewish cartoonists.

===British Commonwealth ===

There has been debate whether Winston Churchill, who was voted &quot;the greatest ever Briton&quot; in 2002, was &quot;a racist and white supremacist&quot;. In the context of rejecting the Arab wish to stop Jewish immigration to Palestine, he said:
I do not admit that the dog in the manger has the final right to the manger, though he may have lain there for a very long time. I do not admit that right. I do not admit for instance that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to those people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race or at any rate a more worldly-wise race ... has come in and taken their place.&quot;

British historian Richard Toye, author of &quot;Churchill&#x27;s Empire&quot;, concluded that &quot;Churchill did think that white people were superior.&quot;

====South Africa====

A number of Southern African nations experienced severe racial tension and conflict during global decolonization, particularly as white Africans of European ancestry fought to protect their preferential social and political status. Racial segregation in South Africa began in colonial times under the Dutch Empire. It continued when the British took over the Cape of Good Hope in 1795. Apartheid was introduced as an officially structured policy by the Afrikaner-dominated National Party after the general election of 1948. Apartheid&#x27;s legislation divided inhabitants into four racial groups — &quot;black&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;coloured&quot;, and &quot;Indian&quot;, with coloured divided into several sub-classifications. In 1970, the Afrikaner-run government abolished non-white political representation, and starting that year black people were deprived of South African citizenship. South Africa abolished apartheid in 1991.

====Rhodesia====
In Rhodesia a predominantly white government issued its own unilateral declaration of independence from the United Kingdom in 1965 during an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to avoid majority rule. Following the Rhodesian Bush War which was fought by African nationalists, Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith acceded to biracial political representation in 1978 and the state achieved recognition from the United Kingdom as Zimbabwe in 1980.

===Germany===
Nazism promoted the idea of a superior Germanic people or Aryan race in Germany during the early 20th century. Notions of white supremacy and Aryan racial superiority were combined in the 19th century, with white supremacists maintaining the belief that white people were members of an Aryan &quot;master race&quot; that was superior to other races, particularly the Jews, who were described as the &quot;Semitic race&quot;, Slavs, and Gypsies, who they associated with &quot;cultural sterility&quot;. Arthur de Gobineau, a French racial theorist and aristocrat, blamed the fall of the &quot;ancien régime&quot; in France on racial degeneracy caused by racial intermixing, which he argued had destroyed the &quot;purity&quot; of the Nordic or Germanic race. Gobineau&#x27;s theories, which attracted a strong following in Germany, emphasized the existence of an irreconcilable polarity between Aryan or Germanic peoples and Jewish culture.

As the Nazi Party&#x27;s chief racial theorist, Alfred Rosenberg oversaw the construction of a human racial &quot;ladder&quot; that justified Hitler&#x27;s racial and ethnic policies. Rosenberg promoted the Nordic theory, which regarded Nordics as the &quot;master race&quot;, superior to all others, including other Aryans (Indo-Europeans). Rosenberg got the racial term &quot;Untermensch&quot; from the title of Klansman Lothrop Stoddard&#x27;s 1922 book &quot;The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man&quot;. It was later adopted by the Nazis from that book&#x27;s German version &quot;Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen&quot; (1925). Rosenberg was the leading Nazi who attributed the concept of the East-European &quot;under man&quot; to Stoddard. An advocate of the U.S. immigration laws that favored Northern Europeans, Stoddard wrote primarily on the alleged dangers posed by &quot;colored&quot; peoples to white civilization, and wrote &quot;The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy&quot; in 1920. In establishing a restrictive entry system for Germany in 1925, Hitler wrote of his admiration for America&#x27;s immigration laws: &quot;The American Union categorically refuses the immigration of physically unhealthy elements, and simply excludes the immigration of certain races.&quot;

German praise for America&#x27;s institutional racism, previously found in Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, was continuous throughout the early 1930s. Nazi lawyers were advocates of the use of American models. Race-based U.S. citizenship and anti-miscegenation laws directly inspired the Nazis&#x27; two principal Nuremberg racial laws—the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law. To preserve the Aryan or Nordic race, the Nazis introduced the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, which forbade sexual relations and marriages between Germans and Jews, and later between Germans and Romani and Slavs. The Nazis used the Mendelian inheritance theory to argue that social traits were innate, claiming that there was a racial nature associated with certain general traits, such as inventiveness or criminal behavior.

According to the 2012 annual report of Germany&#x27;s interior intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, at the time there were 26,000 right-wing extremists living in Germany, including 6,000 neo-Nazis.
=== Australia and New Zealand ===
Fifty-one people died from two consecutive terrorist attacks at the Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre by an Australian white supremacist carried out on March 15, 2019. The terrorist attacks have been described by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern as &quot;One of New Zealand&#x27;s darkest days&quot;. On August 27, 2020, the shooter was sentenced to life without parole.

In 2016, there was a rise in debate over the appropriateness of the naming of Massey University in Palmerston North after William Massey, whom many historians and critics have described as a white supremacist. Lecturer Steve Elers was a leading proponent of the idea that Massey was an avowed white supremacist, given Massey &quot;made several anti-Chinese racist statements in the public domain&quot; and intensified the New Zealand head tax. In 1921, Massey wrote in the &quot;Evening Post:&quot; &quot;New Zealanders are probably the purest Anglo-Saxon population in the British Empire. Nature intended New Zealand to be a white man&#x27;s country, and it must be kept as such. The strain of Polynesian will be no detriment&quot;. This is one of many quotes attributed to him regarded as being openly racist.

==Ideologies and movements==
Supporters of Nordicism consider the &quot;Nordic peoples&quot; to be a superior race. By the early 19th century, white supremacy was attached to emerging theories of racial hierarchy. The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer attributed cultural primacy to the white race:

The eugenicist Madison Grant argued in his 1916 book, &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot;, that the Nordic race had been responsible for most of humanity&#x27;s great achievements, and that admixture was &quot;race suicide&quot;. In this book, Europeans who are not of Germanic origin but have Nordic characteristics such as blonde/red hair and blue/green/gray eyes, were considered to be a Nordic admixture and suitable for Aryanization.

In the United States, the groups most associated with the white-supremacist movement are the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), Aryan Nations, and the White American Resistance movement, all of which are also considered to be antisemitic. The Proud Boys, despite claiming non-association with white supremacy, have been described in academic contexts as being such. Many white-supremacist groups are based on the concept of preserving genetic purity, and do not focus solely on discrimination based on skin color. The KKK&#x27;s reasons for supporting racial segregation are not primarily based on religious ideals, but some Klan groups are openly Protestant. The 1915 silent drama film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; followed the rising racial, economic, political, and geographic tensions leading up to the Emancipation Proclamation and the Southern Reconstruction era that was the genesis of the Ku Klux Klan.

Nazi Germany promulgated white supremacy based on the belief that the Aryan race, or the Germans, were the &quot;master race&quot;. It was combined with a eugenics programme that aimed for racial hygiene through compulsory sterilization of sick individuals and extermination of &quot;Untermenschen&quot; (&quot;subhumans&quot;): Slavs, Jews and Romani, which eventually culminated in the Holocaust.

Christian Identity is another movement closely tied to white supremacy. Some white supremacists identify themselves as Odinists, although many Odinists reject white supremacy. Some white-supremacist groups, such as the South African Boeremag, conflate elements of Christianity and Odinism. Creativity (formerly known as &quot;The World Church of the Creator&quot;) is atheistic and it denounces Christianity and other theistic religions. Aside from this, its ideology is similar to that of many Christian Identity groups because it believes in the antisemitic conspiracy theory that there is a &quot;Jewish conspiracy&quot; in control of governments, the banking industry and the media. Matthew F. Hale, founder of the World Church of the Creator, has published articles stating that all races other than white are &quot;mud races&quot;, which is what the group&#x27;s religion teaches.

The white-supremacist ideology has become associated with a racist faction of the skinhead subculture, despite the fact that when the skinhead culture first developed in the United Kingdom in the late 1960s, it was heavily influenced by black fashions and music, especially Jamaican reggae and ska, and African American soul music.

White-supremacist recruitment activities are primarily conducted at a grassroots level as well as on the Internet. Widespread access to the Internet has led to a dramatic increase in white-supremacist websites. The Internet provides a venue for open expression of white-supremacist ideas at little social cost because people who post the information are able to remain anonymous.

=== White nationalism ===
=== White separatism ===

White separatism is a political and social movement that seeks the separation of white people from people of other races and ethnicities. This may include the establishment of a white ethnostate by removing non-whites from existing communities or by forming new communities elsewhere.

Most modern researchers do not view white separatism as distinct from white-supremacist beliefs. The Anti-Defamation League defines white separatism as &quot;a form of white supremacy&quot;; the Southern Poverty Law Center defines both white nationalism and white separatism as &quot;ideologies based on white supremacy.&quot; Facebook has banned content that is openly white nationalist or white separatist because &quot;white nationalism and white separatism cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups&quot;.

Use of the term to self-identify has been criticized as a dishonest rhetorical ploy. The Anti-Defamation League argues that white supremacists use the phrase because they believe it has fewer negative connotations than the term &quot;white supremacist&quot;.

Dobratz and Shanks-Meile reported that adherents usually reject marriage &quot;outside the white race&quot;. They argued for the existence of &quot;a distinction between the white supremacist&#x27;s desire to dominate (as in apartheid, slavery, or segregation) and complete separation by race&quot;. They argued that this is a matter of pragmatism, because, while many white supremacists are also white separatists, contemporary white separatists reject the view that returning to a system of segregation is possible or desirable in the United States.

==Academic use of the term==
The term &quot;white supremacy&quot; is used in some academic studies of racial power to denote a system of structural or societal racism which privileges white people over others, regardless of the presence or the absence of racial hatred. According to this definition, white racial advantages occur at both a collective and an individual level (&quot;ceteris paribus&quot;, , when individuals are compared that do not differ relevantly except in ethnicity). Legal scholar Frances Lee Ansley explains this definition as follows:

This and similar definitions have been adopted or proposed by Charles W. Mills, bell hooks, David Gillborn, Jessie Daniels, and Neely Fuller Jr, and they are widely used in critical race theory and intersectional feminism. Some anti-racist educators, such as Betita Martinez and the Challenging White Supremacy workshop, also use the term in this way. The term expresses historic continuities between a pre–civil rights movement era of open white supremacy and the current racial power structure of the United States. It also expresses the visceral impact of structural racism through &quot;provocative and brutal&quot; language that characterizes racism as &quot;nefarious, global, systemic, and constant&quot;. Academic users of the term sometimes prefer it to &quot;racism&quot; because it allows for a distinction to be drawn between racist feelings and white racial advantage or privilege. John McWhorter, a specialist in language and race relations, explains the gradual replacement of &quot;racism&quot; by &quot;white supremacy&quot; by the fact that &quot;potent terms need refreshment, especially when heavily used&quot;, drawing a parallel with the replacement of &quot;chauvinist&quot; by &quot;sexist&quot;&quot;.&quot;

Other intellectuals have criticized the term&#x27;s recent rise in popularity among leftist activists as counterproductive. John McWhorter has described the use of &quot;white supremacy&quot; as straying from its commonly accepted meaning to encompass less extreme issues, thereby cheapening the term and potentially derailing productive discussion. Political columnist Kevin Drum attributes the term&#x27;s growing popularity to frequent use by Ta-Nehisi Coates, describing it as a &quot;terrible fad&quot; that fails to convey nuance. He claims that the term should be reserved for those who are trying to promote the idea that whites are inherently superior to blacks and not used to characterize less blatantly racist beliefs or actions. The academic use of the term to refer to systemic racism has been criticized by Conor Friedersdorf for the confusion that it creates for the general public, inasmuch as it differs from the more common dictionary definition; he argues that it is likely to alienate those that it hopes to convince.

<text>W, or w, is the twenty-third letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is &quot;double-u&quot;, plural &quot;double-ues&quot;.

==Name==
Double-u, whose name reflects stages in the letter&#x27;s evolution when it was considered two of the same letter, a double U, is the only modern English letter whose name has more than one syllable. It is also the only English letter whose name is not pronounced with any of the sounds that the letter typically makes in words, with the exception of H for some speakers.

Some speakers shorten the name &quot;double u&quot; into &quot;dub-u&quot; or just &quot;dub&quot;; for example, University of Wisconsin, University of Washington, University of Wyoming, University of Waterloo, University of the Western Cape and University of Western Australia are all known colloquially as &quot;U Dub&quot;, and the automobile company Volkswagen, abbreviated &quot;VW&quot;, is sometimes pronounced &quot;V-Dub&quot;. The fact that many website URLs require a &quot;www.&quot; prefix has been influential in promoting these shortened pronunciations.

In other West Germanic languages, its name is monosyllabic: German , Dutch . In many languages, its name literally means &quot;double v&quot;: Portuguese &quot;duplo vê&quot;, Spanish &quot;doble ve&quot; (though it can be spelled &quot;uve doble&quot;), French &quot;double vé&quot;, Icelandic &quot;tvöfalt vaff&quot;, Czech &quot;dvojité vé&quot;, Estonian &quot;kaksisvee&quot;, Finnish &quot;kaksois-vee&quot;, etc.

==History==
The classical Latin alphabet, from which the modern European alphabets derived, did not have the &quot;W&quot; character. The &quot;W&quot; sounds were represented by the Latin letter &quot;V&quot; (at the time, not yet distinct from &quot;U&quot;).

The sounds (spelled ) and (spelled ) of Classical Latin developed into the voiced bilabial fricative between vowels in Early Medieval Latin. Therefore, no longer adequately represented the voiced labial-velar approximant sound of Germanic phonology.
The Germanic phoneme was, therefore, written as or ( and becoming distinct only by the Early Modern period) by the earliest writers of Old English and Old High German, in the 7th or 8th centuries. Gothic (not Latin-based), by contrast, had simply used a letter based on the Greek Υ for the same sound in the 4th century. The digraph / was also used in Medieval Latin to represent Germanic names, including Gothic ones like Wamba.

It is from this digraph that the modern name &quot;double U&quot; derives. The digraph was commonly used in the spelling of Old High German but only in the earliest texts in Old English, where the sound soon came to be represented by borrowing the rune , adapted as the Latin letter wynn: . In early Middle English, following the 11th-century Norman Conquest, regained popularity; by 1300, it had taken wynn&#x27;s place in common use.

Scribal realisation of the digraph could look like a pair of Vs whose branches crossed in the middle: both forms (separate and crossed) appear, for instance, in the &quot;running text&quot; (in Latin) of the Bayeux tapestry in proper names such as EDVVARDVS and VVILLELMVS (or the same with crossed Vs). Another realisation (common in roundhand, kurrent and blackletter) takes the form of an whose rightmost branch curved around, as in a cursive (viz. formula_1) It was used up to the nineteenth century in Britain and continues to be familiar in Germany.

Thus, the shift from the digraph to the distinct ligature was gradual and was only apparent in abecedaria, explicit listings of all individual letters. It was probably considered a separate letter by the 14th century in both Middle English and Middle German orthography. However, it remained an outsider, not really considered part of the Latin alphabet proper, as expressed by Valentin Ickelshamer in the 16th century, who complained that:

In Middle High German (and possibly already in late Old High German), the West Germanic phoneme became realized as ; this is why, today, the German represents that sound.

==Use in writing systems==
===English===
English uses to represent . There are also a number of words beginning with a written that is silent in most dialects before a (pronounced) , remaining from usage in Old English in which the was pronounced: &quot;wreak&quot;, &quot;wrap&quot;, &quot;wreck&quot;, &quot;wrench&quot;, &quot;wroth&quot;, &quot;wrinkle&quot;, etc. Certain dialects of Scottish English still distinguish this digraph. represents a vowel sound, , in the word pwn, and in the Welsh loanwords &quot;cwm&quot; and &quot;crwth&quot;, it retains the Welsh pronunciation, . is also used in digraphs: , , , wherein it is usually an orthographic allograph of in final positions. It is the fifteenth most frequently used letter in the English language, with a frequency of about 2.56% in words.

===Other languages===
In Europe languages with in native words are in a central-western European zone between Cornwall and Poland: English, German, Low German, Dutch, Frisian, Welsh, Cornish, Breton, Walloon, Polish, Kashubian, Sorbian, Wymysorys, Resian and Scandinavian dialects. German, Polish, Wymysorys and Kashubian use it for the voiced labiodental fricative (with Polish, related Kashubian and Wymysorys using Ł for , except in conservative and some eastern Polish speech, where Ł still represents the dark L sound.), and Dutch uses it for . Unlike its use in other languages, the letter is used in Welsh and Cornish to represent the vowel as well as the related approximant consonant .

The following languages historically used for in native words, but later replaced it by : Swedish, Finnish, Czech, Slovak, Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Ukrainian Łatynka and Belarusian Łacinka. It is also used in modern systems of Romanization of Belarusian for the letter , for example in the BGN/PCGN system, in contrast to the letter , which is used in the Instruction on transliteration of Belarusian geographical names with letters of Latin script.
In Swedish and Finnish, traces of this old usage may still be found in proper names. In Hungarian remains in some aristocratic surnames, e.g. Wesselényi.

Modern German dialects generally have only or for West Germanic , but or is still heard allophonically for , especially in the clusters , , and . Some Bavarian dialects preserve a &quot;light&quot; initial , such as in &quot;wuoz&quot; (Standard German &quot;weiß&quot; &#x27;[I] know&#x27;). The Classical Latin is heard in the Southern German greeting &quot;Servus&quot; (&#x27;hello&#x27; or &#x27;goodbye&#x27;).

In Dutch, became a labiodental approximant (with the exception of words with -, which have , or other diphthongs containing -). In many Dutch-speaking areas, such as Flanders and Suriname, the pronunciation (or in some areas a pronunciation, e.g. Belgian-Dutch &quot;water&quot; &quot;water&quot;, &quot;wit&quot; &quot;white&quot;, &quot;eeuw&quot; &quot;century&quot;, etc.) is used at all times.

In Finnish, is sometimes seen as a variant of and not a separate letter, but it is a part of official alphabet. It is, however, recognized and maintained in the spelling of some old names, reflecting an earlier German spelling standard, and in some modern loan words. In all cases, it is pronounced . The first edition of the &quot;Kalevala&quot; had its title spelled &quot;Kalewala&quot;.

In Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, is named double-v and not double-u. In these languages, the letter only exists in old names, loanwords and foreign words. (Foreign words are distinguished from loanwords by having a significantly lower level of integration in the language.) It is usually pronounced , but in some words of English origin, it may be pronounced . The letter was officially introduced in the Danish and Swedish alphabets as late as 1980 and 2006, respectively, despite having been in use for much longer. It had been recognized since the conception of modern Norwegian with the earliest official orthography rules of 1907. was earlier seen as a variant of , and as a letter (double-v) is still commonly replaced by in speech (e.g. &quot;WC&quot; being pronounced as &quot;VC&quot;, &quot;www&quot; as &quot;VVV&quot;, &quot;WHO&quot; as &quot;VHO&quot;, etc.). The two letters were sorted as equals before was officially recognized, and that practice is still recommended when sorting names in Sweden. In modern slang, some native speakers may pronounce more closely to the origin of the loanword than the official pronunciation.

Multiple dialects of Swedish and Danish use the sound, however. In Denmark, notably in Jutland, the northern half uses it extensively in traditional dialect, and in multiple places in Sweden. It is used in southern Swedish; for example, the words &quot;wesp&quot; (wisp) and &quot;wann&quot; (water) are traditionally used in Halland. In northern and western Sweden, there are also dialects with . Elfdalian is a good example, which is one of many dialects where the Old Norse difference between v () and f ( or ) is preserved. Thus, &quot;warg&quot; from Old Norse &quot;vargr&quot;, but &quot;åvå&quot; from Old Norse &quot;hafa&quot;.

In the alphabets of most modern Romance languages, is used mostly in foreign names and words recently borrowed (Italian &quot;il watt&quot;, Spanish &quot;el kiwi&quot;). In Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, is a non-syllabic variant of , spelled . In Italian, while the letter is not considered part of the standard Italian alphabet, the character is often used in place of &quot;Viva&quot; (hooray for...), generally in the form in which the branches of the Vs cross in the middle, at least in handwriting (in fact it could be considered a monogram). The same symbol written upside down indicates &quot;abbasso&quot; (down with...). In French, is also used mostly in foreign names and words recently borrowed such as &quot;wagon&quot; or &quot;week&quot;(&quot;-&quot;)&quot;end&quot;, but in the first case it is pronounced (because of its German origin; except in Belgium, where it is pronounced [w]) and in the second . In most northern French dialects, the former turned finally to , but still exists as a remnant in the place-names of Romance Flanders, Picardie, Artois, Champagne, Romance Lorraine and sometimes elsewhere (Normandy, Île-de-France), and in the surnames from the same regions. Walloon as it sounds conserves the pronounced . The digraph is used to render in rare French words such as &quot;ouest&quot; &quot;west&quot; and to spell Arabic names transliterated &quot;-wi&quot; in English, but &quot;-oui&quot; in French (compare Arabic surname Badawi / Badaoui). In all these languages, as in Scandinavian languages mentioned above, the letter is named &quot;double v&quot; (French , Spanish ) though in Belgium the name is also used.

In Indonesian, the letter &quot;w&quot; is called &quot;wé&quot;. The letter names in Indonesian are always the same with the sounds they produce, especially the consonants.

The Japanese language uses &quot;W&quot;, pronounced &quot;daburu&quot;, as an ideogram meaning &quot;double&quot;. It is also used in internet slang to indicate laughter (like LOL), derived from the word &quot;warau&quot; (笑う, meaning &quot;to laugh&quot;).

In Italian, while the letter is not considered part of the standard Italian alphabet, the character is often used in place of &quot;Viva&quot; (hooray for...), generally in the form in which the branches of the Vs cross in the middle, at least in handwriting (in fact, it could be considered a monogram). The same symbol written upside down indicates &quot;abbasso&quot; (down with...).

In the Kokborok language, represents the open-mid back rounded vowel .

In Turkey, the use of the was banned between 1928 and 2013 which was a problem for the Kurdish population in Turkey as the was a letter of the Kurdish alphabet. The use of the letter in the word Newroz, the Kurdish new year, was forbidden, and names which included the letter were not able to be used. In 2008, a court in Gaziantep reasoned the use of the letter would incite civil unrest.

In Vietnamese, is called &#x27; or (), from the French &#x27;. It is not included in the standard Vietnamese alphabet, but it is often used as a substitute for &quot;qu-&quot; in literary dialect and very informal writing. It&#x27;s also commonly used for abbreviating &quot;Ư&quot; in formal documents, for example &quot;Trung Ương&quot; is abbreviated as TW even in official documents and document ID number, derived from the Vietnamese Telex input method that usually interpret a single &quot;w&quot; into Vietnamese character &quot;ư&quot;.

&quot;W&quot; is the 24th letter in the Modern Filipino Alphabet and has its English name. However, in the old Filipino alphabet, Abakada, it was the 19th letter and had the name &quot;wah&quot;.

In Washo, lower-case represents a typical sound, while upper-case represents a voiceless w sound, like the difference between English &quot;weather&quot; and &quot;whether&quot; for those who maintain the distinction.

<text>A woman is an adult female human. Before adulthood, a female child or adolescent is referred to as a girl.

Typically, women are of the female sex and inherit a pair of X chromosomes, one from each parent, and women with functional uteruses are capable of pregnancy and giving birth from puberty until menopause. More generally, sex differentiation of the female fetus is governed by the lack of a present, or functioning, &quot;SRY&quot; gene on either one of the respective sex chromosomes. Female anatomy is distinguished from male anatomy by the female reproductive system, which includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, and vulva. An adult woman generally has a wider pelvis, broader hips, and larger breasts than an adult man. These characteristics facilitate childbirth and breastfeeding. Women typically have less facial and other body hair, have a higher body fat composition, and are on average shorter and less muscular than men.

Throughout human history, traditional gender roles within patriarchal societies have often defined and limited women&#x27;s activities and opportunities, resulting in gender inequality; many religious doctrines and legal systems stipulate certain rules for women. With restrictions loosening during the 20th century in many societies, women have gained wider access to careers and the ability to pursue higher education. Violence against women, whether within families or in communities, has a long history and is primarily committed by men. Some women are denied reproductive rights. The movements and ideologies of feminism have a shared goal of achieving gender equality.

Some women are transgender, meaning they were assigned male at birth, while some women are intersex, meaning they have sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of female biology.

The glyph (♀) for the planet and Roman goddess Venus, or Aphrodite in Greek, is the symbol used to represent the female sex. In ancient alchemy, the Venus symbol stood for copper and was associated with femininity.

== Etymology ==

The spelling of &quot;woman&quot; in English has progressed over the past millennium from to &quot;wīmmann&quot; to &quot;wumman&quot;, and finally, the modern spelling &quot;woman&quot;. In Old English, had the gender-neutral meaning of , akin to the Modern or . The word for was or () whereas was or (from ). However, following the Norman Conquest, &quot;man&quot; began to mean , and by the late 13th century it had largely replaced . The consonants and in coalesced into the modern &quot;woman&quot;, while narrowed to specifically mean a married woman ().

It is a popular misconception that the term &quot;woman&quot; is etymologically connected to &quot;womb&quot;. &quot;Womb&quot; derives from the Old English word meaning (cognate to the modern German colloquial term &quot;&quot; from Old High German for ).

== Terminology ==
The word &quot;woman&quot; can be used generally, to mean any female human, or specifically, to mean an adult female human as contrasted with &quot;girl&quot;. The word &quot;girl&quot; originally meant &quot;young person of either sex&quot; in English; it was only around the beginning of the 16th century that it came to mean specifically a &quot;female&quot; child. The term &quot;girl&quot; is sometimes used colloquially to refer to a young or unmarried woman; however, during the early 1970s, feminists challenged such use because the use of the word to refer to a fully grown woman may cause offense. In particular, previously common terms such as &quot;office girl&quot; are no longer widely used. Conversely, in certain cultures which link family honor with female virginity, the word &quot;girl&quot; (or its equivalent in other languages) is still used to refer to a never-married woman; in this sense it is used in a fashion roughly analogous to the more-or-less obsolete English &quot;maid&quot; or &quot;maiden&quot;. 

The social sciences&#x27; views on what it means to be a woman have changed significantly since the early 20th century as women gained more rights and greater representation in the workforce, with scholarship in the 1970s moving toward a focus on the sex–gender distinction and social construction of gender. There are various words used to refer to the quality of being a woman. The term &quot;womanhood&quot; merely means the state of being a woman; &quot;femininity&quot; is used to refer to a set of typical female qualities associated with a certain attitude to gender roles; &quot;womanliness&quot; is like &quot;femininity&quot;, but is usually associated with a different view of gender roles.

Different countries have different laws, but age 18 is frequently considered the age of majority (the age at which a person is legally considered an adult). Menarche, the onset of menstruation, occurs on average at age 12–13. Many cultures have rites of passage to symbolize a girl&#x27;s coming of age, such as confirmation in some branches of Christianity, bat mitzvah in Judaism, or a custom of a special celebration for a certain birthday (generally between 12 and 21), like the quinceañera of Latin America.

== Biology ==

Male and female bodies have some differences. Some differences, such as the external sex organs, are visible, while other differences, such as internal anatomy and genetic characteristics, are not visible.

=== Genetic characteristics ===
Typically, the cells of female humans contain two X chromosomes, while the cells of male humans have an X and a Y chromosome. During early fetal development, all embryos have phenotypically female genitalia up until week 6 or 7, when a male embryo&#x27;s gonads differentiate into testes due to the action of the &quot;SRY&quot; gene on the Y chromosome. Sex differentiation proceeds in female humans in a way that is independent of gonadal hormones. Because humans inherit mitochondrial DNA only from the mother&#x27;s ovum, genealogical researchers can trace maternal lineage far back in time.

=== Hormonal characteristics, menstruation and menopause ===

Female puberty triggers bodily changes that enable sexual reproduction via fertilization. In response to chemical signals from the pituitary gland, the ovaries secrete hormones that stimulate maturation of the body, including increased height and weight, body hair growth, breast development and menarche (the onset of menstruation).

Most girls go through menarche between ages 12–13, and are then capable of becoming pregnant and bearing children. Pregnancy generally requires internal fertilization of the eggs with sperm, via either sexual intercourse or artificial insemination, though in vitro fertilization allows fertilization to occur outside the human body. Humans are similar to other large mammals in that they usually give birth to a single offspring per pregnancy, but are unusual in being altricial compared to most other large mammals, meaning young are undeveloped at time of birth and require the aid of their parents or guardians to fully mature. Sometimes humans have multiple births, most commonly twins.

Usually between ages 49–52, a woman reaches menopause, the time when menstrual periods stop permanently, and they are no longer able to bear children. Unlike most other mammals, the human lifespan usually extends many years after menopause. Many women become grandmothers and contribute to the care of grandchildren and other family members. Many biologists believe that the extended human lifespan is evolutionarily driven by kin selection, though other theories have also been proposed.

=== Morphological and physiological characteristics ===


In terms of biology, the female sex organs are involved in the reproductive system, whereas the secondary sex characteristics are involved in breastfeeding children and attracting a mate. Humans are placental mammals, which means the mother carries the fetus in the uterus and the placenta facilitates the exchange of nutrients and waste between the mother and fetus.

The internal female genitalia consist of the ovaries, gonads that produce female gametes called ova, the fallopian tubes, tubular structures that transport the egg cells, the uterus, an organ with tissue to protect and nurture the developing fetus and its cervix to expel it, the accessory glands (Bartholin&#x27;s and Skene&#x27;s), two pairs of glands that help lubricate during intercourse, and the vagina, an organ used in copulating and birthing. 

The vulva (external female genitalia) consists of the clitoris, labia majora, labia minora and vestibule. The vestibule is where the vaginal and urethral openings are located. 

The mammary glands are hypothesized to have evolved from apocrine-like glands to produce milk, a nutritious secretion that is the most distinctive characteristic of mammals, along with live birth. In mature women, the breast is generally more prominent than in most other mammals; this prominence, not necessary for milk production, is thought to be at least partially the result of sexual selection.

Estrogens, which are primary female sex hormones, have a significant impact on a female&#x27;s body shape. They are produced in both men and women, but their levels are significantly higher in women, especially in those of reproductive age. Besides other functions, estrogens promote the development of female secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts and hips. As a result of estrogens, during puberty, girls develop breasts and their hips widen. Working against estrogen, the presence of testosterone in a pubescent female inhibits breast development and promotes muscle and facial hair development.

===Circulatory system===
Women have lower hematocrit (the volume percentage of red blood cells in blood) than men; this is due to lower testosterone, which stimulates the production of erythropoietin by the kidney. The normal hematocrit level for a woman is 36% to 48% (for men, 41% to 50%). The normal level of hemoglobin (an oxygen-transport protein found in red blood cells) for women is 12.0 to 15.5 g/dL (for men, 13.5 to 17.5 g/dL).

Women&#x27;s hearts have finer-grained textures in the muscle compared to men&#x27;s hearts, and the heart muscle&#x27;s overall shape and surface area also differs to men&#x27;s when controlling for body size and age. In addition, women&#x27;s hearts age more slowly compared to men&#x27;s hearts.

=== Sex distribution ===
Girls are born slightly less frequently than boys (the ratio is around 1:1.05). Out of the total human population in 2015, there were 1018 men for every 1000 women.

=== Intersex women ===
Intersex women have an intersex condition, usually defined as those born with ambiguous genitalia. Most individuals with ambiguous genitalia are assigned female at birth, and most intersex women are cisgender. The medical practices to assign binary female to intersex youth is often controversial. Some intersex conditions are associated with typical rates of female gender identity, while others are associated with substantially higher rates of identifying as LGBT compared to the general population.

== Sexuality and gender ==

Female sexuality and attraction are variable, and a woman&#x27;s sexual behavior can be affected by many factors, including evolved predispositions, personality, upbringing, and culture. While most women are heterosexual, significant minorities are lesbian or bisexual.

Most cultures use a gender binary by which women are of one of two genders, the others being men; other cultures have a third gender. 
&quot;Femininity&quot; (also called &quot;womanliness&quot; or &quot;girlishness&quot;) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles generally associated with women and girls. Although femininity is socially constructed, some behaviors considered feminine are biologically influenced. The extent to which femininity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate. It is distinct from the definition of the biological female sex, as both men and women can exhibit feminine traits.

Most women are cisgender, meaning their female sex assignment at birth corresponds with their female gender identity. Some women are transgender, meaning they were assigned male at birth. Trans women may experience gender dysphoria, the distress brought upon by the discrepancy between a person&#x27;s gender identity and their sex assigned at birth. Gender dysphoria may be treated with gender-affirming care, which may include social or medical transition. Social transition may involve changes such as adopting a new name, hairstyle, clothing, and pronoun associated with the individual&#x27;s affirmed female gender identity. A major component of medical transition for trans women is feminizing hormone therapy, which causes the development of female secondary sex characteristics (such as breasts, redistribution of body fat, and lower waist–hip ratio). Medical transition may also involve gender-affirming surgery, and a trans woman may undergo one or more feminizing procedures which result in anatomy that is typically gendered female. Like cisgender women, trans women may have any sexual orientation.

== Health ==
Factors that specifically affect the health of women in comparison with men are most evident in those related to reproduction, but sex differences have been identified from the molecular to the behavioral scale. Some of these differences are subtle and difficult to explain, partly due to the fact that it is difficult to separate the health effects of inherent biological factors from the effects of the surrounding environment they exist in. Sex chromosomes and hormones, as well as sex-specific lifestyles, metabolism, immune system function, and sensitivity to environmental factors are believed to contribute to sex differences in health at the levels of physiology, perception, and cognition. Women can have distinct responses to drugs and thresholds for diagnostic parameters.

Some diseases primarily affect or are exclusively found in women, such as lupus, breast cancer, cervical cancer, or ovarian cancer. The medical practice dealing with female reproduction and reproductive organs is called gynaecology (&quot;science of women&quot;).

=== Maternal mortality ===
Maternal mortality or maternal death is defined by WHO as &quot;the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.&quot; In 2008, noting that each year more than 500,000 women die of complications of pregnancy and childbirth and at least seven million experience serious health problems while 50 million more have adverse health consequences after childbirth, the World Health Organization urged midwife training to strengthen maternal and newborn health services. To support the upgrading of midwifery skills the WHO established a midwife training program, Action for Safe Motherhood.

In 2017, 94% of maternal deaths occur in low and lower middle-income countries. Approximately 86% of maternal deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with sub-Saharan Africa accounting for around 66% and Southern Asia accounting for around 20%. The main causes of maternal mortality include pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, unsafe abortion, pregnancy complications from malaria and HIV/AIDS, and severe bleeding and infections following childbirth. Most European countries, Australia, Japan, and Singapore are very safe in regard to childbirth.

=== Life expectancy ===
The life expectancy for women is generally longer than men&#x27;s. This advantage begins from birth, with newborn girls more likely to survive the first year than boys. Worldwide, women live six to eight years longer than men. However, this varies by place and situation. For example, discrimination against women has lowered female life expectancy in some parts of Asia so that men there live longer than women.

The difference in life expectancy are believed to be partly due to biological advantages and partly due to gendered behavioral differences between men and women. For example, women are less likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors like smoking and reckless driving, and consequently have fewer preventable premature deaths from such causes.

In some developed countries, the life expectancy is evening out. This is believed to caused both by worse health behaviors among women, especially an increased rate of smoking tobacco by women, and improved health among men, such as less cardiovascular disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) writes that it is &quot;important to note that the extra years of life for women are not always lived in good health.&quot;

=== Reproductive rights ===

Reproductive rights are legal rights and freedoms relating to reproduction and reproductive health. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics has stated that:

:... the human rights of women include their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. Equal relationships between women and men in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the integrity of the person, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behavior and its consequences.

The World Health Organization reports that based on data from 2010 to 2014, 56 million induced abortions occurred worldwide each year (25% of all pregnancies). Of those, about 25 million were considered as unsafe. The WHO reports that in developed regions about 30 women die for every 100,000 unsafe abortions and that number rises to 220 deaths per 100,000 unsafe abortions in developing regions and 520 deaths per 100,000 unsafe abortions in sub-Saharan Africa. The WHO ascribes these deaths to:
*restrictive laws
*poor availability of services
*high cost
*stigma
*conscientious objection of health-care providers 
*unnecessary requirements, such as mandatory waiting periods, mandatory counseling, provision of misleading information, third-party authorization, and medically unnecessary tests that delay care.

== History ==
The earliest women whose names are known include:
* Neithhotep (c. 3200 BCE), the wife of Narmer and the first queen of ancient Egypt.
* Merneith (c. 3000 BCE), consort and regent of ancient Egypt during the first dynasty. She may have been ruler of Egypt in her own right.
* Peseshet (c. 2600 BCE), a physician in Ancient Egypt.
* Puabi (c. 2600 BCE), or Shubad – queen of Ur whose tomb was discovered with many expensive artifacts. Other known pre-Sargonic queens of Ur (royal wives) include Ashusikildigir, Ninbanda, and Gansamannu.
* Kugbau (&quot;circa&quot; 2,500 BCE), a taverness from Kish chosen by the Nippur priesthood to become hegemonic ruler of Sumer, and in later ages deified as &quot;Kubaba&quot;.
* Tashlultum (c. 2400 BCE), Akkadian queen, wife of Sargon of Akkad and mother of Enheduanna.
* Baranamtarra (c. 2384 BCE), prominent and influential queen of Lugalanda of Lagash. Other known pre-Sargonic queens of the first Lagash dynasty include Menbara-abzu, Ashume&#x27;eren, Ninkhilisug, Dimtur, and Shagshag, and the names of several princesses are also known.
* Enheduanna (c. 2285 BCE), the high priestess of the temple of the Moon God in the Sumerian city-state of Ur and possibly the first known poet and first named author of either gender.
* Shibtu (c. 1775 BCE), king Zimrilim&#x27;s consort and queen of the Syrian city-state of Mari. During her husband&#x27;s absence, she ruled as regent of Mari and enjoyed extensive administrative powers as queen.

== Culture and gender roles ==
In recent history, gender roles have changed greatly. At some earlier points in history, children&#x27;s occupational aspirations starting at a young age differed according to gender. Traditionally, middle class women were involved in domestic tasks emphasizing child care. For poorer women, economic necessity compelled them to seek employment outside the home even if individual poor women may have preferred domestic tasks. Many of the occupations that were available to them were lower in pay than those available to men.

As changes in the labor market for women came about, availability of employment changed from only &quot;dirty&quot;, long hour factory jobs to &quot;cleaner&quot;, more respectable office jobs where more education was demanded. Married women&#x27;s participation in the U.S. labor force rose from 5.6–6% in 1900 to 23.8% in 1923. These shifts in the labor force led to changes in the attitudes towards women at work, allowing for the revolution which resulted in women becoming career and education oriented.

In the 1970s, many female academics, including scientists, avoided having children. Throughout the 1980s, institutions tried to equalize conditions for men and women in the workplace. Even so, the inequalities at home hampered women&#x27;s opportunities: professional women were still generally considered responsible for domestic labor and child care, which limited the time and energy they could devote to their careers. Until the early 20th century, U.S. women&#x27;s colleges required their women faculty members to remain single, on the grounds that a woman could not carry on two full-time professions at once. According to Schiebinger, &quot;Being a scientist and a wife and a mother is a burden in society that expects women more often than men to put family ahead of career.&quot; (p. 93).

Movements advocate equality of opportunity for both sexes and equal rights irrespective of gender. Through a combination of economic changes and the efforts of the feminist movement, in recent decades women in many societies have gained access to careers beyond the traditional homemaker. Despite these advances, modern women in Western society still face challenges in the workplace as well as with the topics of education, violence, health care, politics, and motherhood, and others. Sexism can be a main concern and barrier for women almost anywhere, though its forms, perception, and gravity vary between societies and social classes. There has been an increase in the endorsement of egalitarian gender roles in the home by both women and men.

Although a greater number of women are seeking higher education, their salaries are often less than those of men. CBS News said in 2005 that in the United States women who are ages 30 to 44 and hold a university degree make 62% of what similarly qualified men do, a lower rate than in all but three of the 19 countries for which numbers are available. Some Western nations with greater inequality in pay are Germany, New Zealand and Switzerland.

=== Religion ===

Particular religious doctrines have specific stipulations relating to gender roles, social and private interaction between the sexes, appropriate dressing attire for women, and various other issues affecting women and their position in society. In many countries, these religious teachings influence the criminal law, or the family law of those jurisdictions (see Sharia law, for example). The relation between religion, law and gender equality has been discussed by international organizations.

=== Violence against women ===

The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women defines &quot;violence against women&quot; as:

It identifies three forms of such violence: that which occurs &quot;in the family&quot;, that which occurs &quot;within the general community&quot;, and that which is perpetrated or condoned &quot;by the State&quot;. It also states that &quot;violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women&quot;.

Violence against women remains a widespread problem, fueled, especially outside the West, by patriarchal social values, lack of adequate laws, and lack of enforcement of existing laws. Social norms that exist in many parts of the world hinder progress towards protecting women from violence. For example, according to surveys by UNICEF, the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is as high as 90% in Afghanistan and Jordan, 87% in Mali, 86% in Guinea and Timor-Leste, 81% in Laos, and 80% in the Central African Republic. A 2010 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that stoning as a punishment for adultery was supported by 82% of respondents in Egypt and Pakistan, 70% in Jordan, 56% Nigeria, and 42% in Indonesia.

Specific forms of violence that affect women include female genital mutilation, sex trafficking, forced prostitution, forced marriage, rape, sexual harassment, honor killings, acid throwing, and dowry related violence. Laws and policies on violence against women vary by jurisdiction. In the European Union, sexual harassment and human trafficking are subject to directives. Governments can be complicit in violence against women, such as when stoning is used as a legal punishment, mostly for women accused of adultery. 

There have also been many forms of violence against women which have been prevalent historically, notably the burning of witches, the sacrifice of widows (such as sati) and foot binding. The prosecution of women accused of witchcraft has a long tradition; for example, during the early modern period (between the 15th and 18th centuries), witch trials were common in Europe and in the European colonies in North America. Today, there remain regions of the world (such as parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, rural North India, and Papua New Guinea) where belief in witchcraft is held by many people, and women accused of being witches are subjected to serious violence. In addition, there are also countries which have criminal legislation against the practice of witchcraft. In Saudi Arabia, witchcraft remains a crime punishable by death, and in 2011 the country beheaded a woman for &#x27;witchcraft and sorcery&#x27;.

It is also the case that certain forms of violence against women have been recognized as criminal offences only during recent decades, and are not universally prohibited, in that many countries continue to allow them. This is especially the case with marital rape. In the Western World, there has been a trend towards ensuring gender equality within marriage and prosecuting domestic violence, but in many parts of the world women still lose significant legal rights when entering a marriage.

Sexual violence against women greatly increases during times of war and armed conflict, during military occupation, or ethnic conflicts; most often in the form of war rape and sexual slavery. Contemporary examples of sexual violence during war include rape during the Armenian Genocide, rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War, rape in the Bosnian War, rape during the Rwandan genocide, and rape during Second Congo War. In Colombia, the armed conflict has also resulted in increased sexual violence against women. The most recent case was the sexual jihad done by ISIL where 5000–7000 Yazidi and Christian girls and children were sold into sexual slavery during the genocide and rape of Yazidi and Christian women, some of whom jumped to their death from Mount Sinjar, as described in a witness statement.

== Clothing, fashion and dress codes ==
Women in different parts of the world dress in different ways, with their choices of clothing being influenced by local culture, religious tenets, traditions, social norms, and fashion trends, among other factors. Different societies have different ideas about modesty. 

In many jurisdictions, laws limit what women may or may not wear. This is especially the case in regard to Islamic dress. While certain jurisdictions legally mandate such clothing (the wearing of the headscarf), other countries forbid or restrict the wearing of certain hijab attire (such as burqa/covering the face) in public places (one such country is France – see French ban on face covering). These laws – both those mandating and those prohibiting certain articles of dress – are highly controversial.

== Fertility and family life ==

The total fertility rate (TFR) – the average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime – differs significantly between different regions of the world. In 2016, the highest estimated TFR was in Niger (6.62 children born per woman) and the lowest in Singapore (0.82 children/woman). While most Sub-Saharan African countries have a high TFR, which creates problems due to lack of resources and contributes to overpopulation, most Western countries currently experience a sub replacement fertility rate which may lead to population ageing and population decline.

In many parts of the world, there has been a change in family structure over the past few decades. For instance, in the West, there has been a trend of moving away from living arrangements that include the extended family to those which only consist of the nuclear family. There has also been a trend to move from marital fertility to non-marital fertility. Children born outside marriage may be born to cohabiting couples or to single women. While births outside marriage are common and fully accepted in some parts of the world, in other places they are highly stigmatized, with unmarried mothers facing ostracism, including violence from family members, and in extreme cases even honor killings. In addition, sex outside marriage remains illegal in many countries (such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Sudan, and Yemen).

The social role of the mother differs between cultures. In many parts of the world, women with dependent children are expected to stay at home and dedicate all their energy to child raising, while in other places mothers most often return to paid work (see working mother and stay-at-home mother).

== Education ==
Single-sex education has traditionally been dominant and is still highly relevant. Universal education, meaning state-provided primary and secondary education independent of gender, is not yet a global norm, even if it is assumed in most developed countries. In some Western countries, women have surpassed men at many levels of education. For example, in the United States in 2005/2006, women earned 62% of associate degrees, 58% of bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 60% of master&#x27;s degrees, and 50% of doctorates.

In 2020, 87% of the world&#x27;s women were literate, compared to 90% of men; at the same time, only 59% of women in sub-Saharan Africa were literate. The educational gender gap in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries has been reduced over the last 30 years. Younger women today are far more likely to have completed a tertiary qualification: in 19 of the 30 OECD countries, more than twice as many women aged 25 to 34 have completed tertiary education than have women aged 55 to 64. In 21 of 27 OECD countries with comparable data, the number of women graduating from university-level programmes is equal to or exceeds that of men. 15-year-old girls tend to show much higher expectations for their careers than boys of the same age.
While women account for more than half of university graduates in several OECD countries, they receive only 30% of tertiary degrees granted in science and engineering fields, and women account for only 25% to 35% of researchers in most OECD countries.

Research shows that while women are studying at prestigious universities at the same rate as men they are not being given the same chance to join the faculty. Sociologist Harriet Zuckerman has observed that the more prestigious an institute is, the more difficult and time-consuming it will be for women to obtain a faculty position there. In 1989, Harvard University tenured its first woman in chemistry, Cynthia Friend, and in 1992 its first woman in physics, Melissa Franklin. She also observed that women were more likely to hold their first professional positions as instructors and lecturers while men are more likely to work first in tenure positions. According to Smith and Tang, as of 1989, 65% of men and only 40% of women held tenured positions and only 29% of all scientists and engineers employed as assistant professors in four-year colleges and universities were women. In the Soviet Union, 40% of chemistry PhDs went to women in the 1960s. 

In 1992, women earned 9% of the PhDs awarded in engineering, but only one percent of those women became professors. In 1995, 11% of professors in science and engineering were women. In relation, only 311 deans of engineering schools were women, which is less than 1% of the total. Even in psychology, a degree in which women earn the majority of PhDs, they hold a significant amount of fewer tenured positions, roughly 19% in 1994.

== Government and politics ==
Women are underrepresented in government in most countries. In January 2019, the global average of women in national assemblies was 24.3%. 

Suffrage is the civil right to vote, and women&#x27;s suffrage movements have a long historic timeline. For example, women&#x27;s suffrage in the United States was achieved gradually, first at state and local levels in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then in 1920 when women in the US received universal suffrage with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Some Western countries were slow to allow women to vote, notably Switzerland, where women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971, and in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women were granted the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland; and Liechtenstein, in 1984, through a women&#x27;s suffrage referendum.

== Science, literature and art ==

=== Science and medicine ===
One area where women have been permitted most access historically was that of obstetrics and gynecology (prior to the 18th century, caring for pregnant women in Europe was undertaken by women; from the mid 18th century onwards, medical monitoring of pregnant women started to require rigorous formal education, to which women did not generally have access, and thus the practice was largely transferred to men).

=== Literature ===
Writing was generally also considered acceptable for upper-class women, although achieving success as a female writer in a male-dominated world could be very difficult; as a result of several women writers adopted a male pen name (e.g. George Sand, George Eliot).

=== Music ===
Women have been composers, songwriters, instrumental performers, singers, conductors, music scholars, music educators, music critics/music journalists and other musical professions. There are music movements, events and genres related to women, women&#x27;s issues and feminism. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of popular music and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, rock critics and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of women composers in classical music, from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the commonly performed classical music repertoire, music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the &quot;Concise Oxford History of Music&quot;, Clara Schumann is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.

Women comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked Vienna Philharmonic orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and heavy metal, although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and all-female bands. Women are particularly underrepresented in extreme metal genres. Women are also underrepresented in orchestral conducting, music criticism/music journalism, music producing, and sound engineering. While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women musicologists, women became involved in music education &quot;... to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century.&quot;

According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London&#x27;s &quot;The Independent&quot;, women musicians in classical music are &quot;... too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent&quot; and they face pressure &quot;... to look sexy onstage and in photos.&quot; Duchen states that while &quot;[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks, ... the ones who do tend to be more materially successful.&quot;

According to the UK&#x27;s Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the classical music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the leader of an orchestra. In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.

<text>The  (; ) was the combat branch of the Nazi Party&#x27;s paramilitary &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) organisation. Its formations included men from Nazi Germany, along with volunteers and conscripts from both German-occupied Europe and unoccupied lands. With the start of World War II, tactical control was exercised by the (OKW, &quot;High Command of the Armed Forces&quot;), with some units being subordinated to the (Command Staff &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;) directly under Himmler&#x27;s control. It was disbanded in May 1945.

The grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions during World War II. Combining combat and police functions, it served alongside the German Army (&quot;Heer&quot;), &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Order Police), and other security units. Originally, it was under the control of the (SS operational command office) beneath Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS. 

Initially, in keeping with the racial policy of Nazi Germany, membership was open only to people of Germanic origin (so-called &quot;Aryan ancestry&quot;). The rules were partially relaxed in 1940, and after the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Nazi propaganda claimed that the war was a &quot;European crusade against Bolshevism&quot; and subsequently units consisting largely or solely of foreign volunteers and conscripts were also raised. These units were made up of men mainly from among the nationals of Nazi-occupied Europe. Despite relaxation of the rules, the was still based on the racist ideology of Nazism, and ethnic Poles (who were viewed as subhumans) were specifically barred from the formations.

The were involved in numerous atrocities. It was declared a criminal organisation by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg in 1946, due to its involvement in the Holocaust, the Porajmos, and numerous war crimes and crimes against the civilian population, including torture, human experimentation, kidnapping of children, mass rape, child sexual abuse and mass murder. Therefore members, with the exception of conscripts, who comprised about one-third of the membership, were denied many of the rights afforded to military veterans. 
==Origins (1929–39)==

The origins of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; can be traced back to the selection of a group of 120 SS men on 17 March 1933 by Sepp Dietrich to form the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; Berlin. By November 1933 the formation had 800 men, and at a commemorative ceremony in Munich for the tenth anniversary of the failed Beer Hall Putsch the regiment swore allegiance to Adolf Hitler. The oaths pledged were &quot;Pledging loyalty to him alone&quot; and &quot;Obedience unto death&quot;. The formation was given the title () &quot;Adolf Hitler&quot; (LAH). On 13 April 1934, by order of Himmler, the regiment became known as the &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; (LSSAH).

The demonstrated their loyalty to Hitler in 1934 during the &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot;, when the Nazi regime carried out a series of political murders and the purge of the (SA). Led by one of Hitler&#x27;s oldest comrades, Ernst Röhm, the SA was seen as a threat by Hitler to his newly gained political power. Hitler also wanted to appease leaders of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; (the Weimar Republic&#x27;s armed forces) and conservatives of the country, people whose support Hitler needed to solidify his position. When Hitler decided to act against the SA, the SS was put in charge of killing Röhm and the other high-ranking SA officers. The Night of the Long Knives occurred between 30 June and 2 July 1934, claiming up to 200 victims and murdering almost the entire SA leadership, effectively ending its power. This action was largely carried out by SS personnel (including the ) and the Gestapo.

In September 1934, Hitler authorised the formation of the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party and approved the formation of the (SS-VT), a special service troop under Hitler&#x27;s overall command. The SS-VT had to depend on the German Army for its supply of weapons and military training, and its local draft boards responsible for assigning conscripts to the different branches of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; to meet quotas set by the German High Command ( or OKW in German); the SS was given the lowest priority for recruits.

Even with the difficulties presented by the quota system, Heinrich Himmler formed two new SS regiments, the and , which together with the and a communications unit made up the SS-VT. At the same time Himmler established two SS-Junker Schools (SS officer training camps) that, under the direction of former Lieutenant General Paul Hausser, prepared future SS leaders. In addition to military training, the courses aimed to instill a proper ideological worldview, with antisemitism being the main tenet. Instructors such as Matthias Kleinheisterkamp, or future war criminals, such as Franz Magill of the notorious SS Cavalry Brigade were of questionable competence.
In 1934, Himmler set stringent requirements for recruits. They were to be German nationals who could prove their Aryan ancestry back to 1800, unmarried, and without a criminal record. A four-year commitment was required for the SS-VT and LSSAH. Recruits had to be between the ages of 17 and 23, at least tall ( for the LSSAH). Concentration camp guards had to make a one-year commitment, be between the ages of 16 and 23, and at least tall. All recruits were required to have 20/20 eyesight, no dental fillings, and to provide a medical certificate. By 1938, the height restrictions were relaxed, up to six dental fillings were permitted, and eyeglasses for astigmatism and mild vision correction were allowed. Once the war commenced, the physical requirements were no longer strictly enforced, and any recruit who could pass a basic medical exam was considered for service. Members of the SS could be of any religion except Judaism, but atheists were not allowed according to Himmler in 1937. Hitler expounded on the attitude he wanted during a talk in the Wolf&#x27;s Lair: &quot;I have six divisions of SS composed of men absolutely indifferent in matters of religion. It doesn&#x27;t prevent them from going to their deaths with serenity in their souls.&quot;

Historian Bernd Wegner found in his study of officers that a large majority of the senior officers corps of the were from an upper-middle-class background and would have been considered for commissioning by traditional standards. Among later generals, approximately six out of ten had a &quot;university entrance qualification (Abitur), and no less than one-fifth a university degree&quot;.

Hausser became the Inspector of the SS-VT in 1936. In this role, Hausser was in charge of the troops&#x27; military and ideological training but did not have command authority. The decision on deployment of the troops remained in Himmler&#x27;s hands. This aligned with Hitler&#x27;s intentions to maintain these troops exclusively at his disposal, &quot;neither [a part] of the army, nor of the police&quot;, according to Hitler&#x27;s order of 17 August 1938.

On 17 August 1938, Hitler declared that the SS-VT would have a role in domestic as well as foreign affairs, which transformed this growing armed force into the rival that the army had feared. He decreed that service in the SS-VT qualified to fulfill military service obligations, although service in the (SS-TV) would not. Some units of the SS-TV would, in the case of war, be used as reserves for the SS-VT, which did not have its own reserves. For all its training, the SS-VT was untested in combat. In 1938, a battalion of the was chosen to accompany the army troops in occupying Austria during the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, and the three regiments of the SS-VT participated in the occupation of the Sudetenland that same year in October. In both actions no resistance was met.

Recruiting ethnic Germans from other countries began in April 1940, and units consisting of non-Germanic recruits were formed beginning in 1942. Non-Germanic units were not considered to be part of the SS, which still maintained its racial criteria, but rather were considered to be foreign nationals serving under the command of the SS. As a general rule, an &quot;SS Division&quot; was made up of Germans or other Germanic peoples, while a &quot;Division of the SS&quot; was made up of non-Germanic volunteers and conscripts.

==World War II==
===1939===
====Invasion of Poland====

Himmler&#x27;s military formations at the outbreak of the war comprised several subgroups that would become the basis of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;:
* The &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; (LSSAH), under then SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Josef &quot;Sepp&quot; Dietrich
* The Inspectorate of &quot;Verfügungstruppe&quot; (SS-VT), under then SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Paul Hausser, which commanded the &quot;Deutschland&quot;, &quot;Germania&quot; and &quot;Der Führer&quot; regiments. The latter was recruited in Austria after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; and was not yet combat-ready.
* The Inspectorate of Concentration Camps, under SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Theodor Eicke, which fielded four infantry and one cavalry Death&#x27;s Head &quot;Standarten&quot;, comprising camp guards of the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; (SS-TV). These troops wore the SS-TV skull and crossbones rather than the SS-VT &quot;SS&quot; runes.
* Police units of &quot;Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei&quot; Kurt Daluege&#x27;s &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;, which reported to Himmler in his capacity as Chief of German Police. These troops used police ranks and insignia rather than those of the SS.

In August 1939, Hitler placed the and the SS-VT under the operational control of the Army High Command (OKH). Himmler retained command of the for employment behind the advancing combat units in what were euphemistically called &quot;special tasks of a police nature&quot;.

In spite of the swift military victory over Poland in September 1939, the regular army felt that the performance of the SS-VT left much to be desired; its units took unnecessary risks and had a higher casualty rate than the army. They also stated that the SS-VT was poorly trained and its officers unsuitable for combat command. As an example, the OKW noted that the had to be rescued by an army regiment after becoming surrounded by the Poles at Pabianice. In its defence, the SS insisted that it had been hampered by having to fight piecemeal instead of as one formation, and was improperly equipped by the army to carry out its objectives. Himmler insisted that the SS-VT should be allowed to fight in its own formations under its own commanders, while the OKW tried to have the SS-VT disbanded altogether. Hitler was unwilling to upset either the army or Himmler, and chose a third path. He ordered that the SS-VT form its own divisions but that the divisions would be under army command. Hitler resisted integrating the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; into the army, as it was intended to remain the armed wing of the party and to become an elite police force once the war was won.

During the invasion, numerous war crimes were committed against the Polish people. The became notorious for torching villages without military justification. Members of the also committed atrocities in numerous towns, including the murder of 50 Polish Jews in Błonie and the massacre of 200 civilians, including children, who were machine gunned in Złoczew. Shootings also took place in Bolesławiec, Torzeniec, Goworowo, Mława, and Włocławek. Eicke&#x27;s SS-TV field forces were not military. 

His troops were called on to carry out &quot;police and security measures&quot; in the rear areas. What these measures involved is demonstrated by the record of &quot;SS Totenkopf Standarte &quot;Brandenburg&quot;&quot;. It arrived in Włocławek on 22 September 1939 and embarked on a four-day &quot;Jewish action&quot; that included the burning of synagogues and the execution en-masse of the leaders of the Jewish community. On 29 September the &quot;Standarte&quot; travelled to Bydgoszcz to conduct an &quot;intelligentsia action&quot;.

====First divisions====
In October 1939, the &quot;Deutschland&quot;, &quot;Germania&quot;, and &quot;Der Führer&quot; regiments were reorganised into the &quot;SS-Verfügungs-Division&quot;. The remained independent and was increased in strength to a reinforced motorised regiment. Hitler authorised the creation of two new divisions: the SS &quot;Totenkopf&quot; Division, formed from militarised &quot;Standarten&quot; of the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot;, and the Polizei Division, formed from members of the national police force. Almost overnight the force that the OKW had tried to disband had increased from 18,000 to over 100,000 men. Hitler next authorised the creation of four motorised artillery battalions in March 1940, one for each division and the . The OKW was supposed to supply these new battalions with artillery, but was reluctant to hand over guns from its own arsenal. The weapons arrived only slowly and, by the time of the Battle of France, only the battalion was up to strength.

===1940===
====France and the Netherlands====
The three SS divisions and the spent the winter of 1939 and the spring of 1940 training and preparing for the coming war in the west. In May, they moved to the front, and the was attached to the army&#x27;s 227th Infantry Division. The &quot;Der Führer&quot; Regiment was detached from the SS-VT Division and attached to the 207th Infantry Division. The SS-VT Division minus &quot;Der Führer&quot; was concentrated near Münster awaiting the invasion of the Netherlands. The SS &quot;Totenkopf&quot; and Polizei Divisions were held in reserve.

On 10 May, the overcame Dutch border guards to spearhead the German advance of X Corps into the Netherlands, north of the rivers towards the Dutch Grebbe Line and subsequently the Amsterdam region. The neighbouring &quot;Der Führer&quot; Regiment advanced towards the Grebbe Line in the sector of the Grebbeberg with as a follow-up objective the city of Utrecht. The Battle of the Grebbeberg lasted three days and took a toll on &quot;Der Führer&quot;. On 11 May, the SS-VT Division crossed into the Netherlands south of the rivers and headed towards Breda. It fought a series of skirmishes before &quot;Germania&quot; advanced into the Dutch province of Zeeland on 14 May. The rest of the SS-VT Division joined the northern front against the forces in Antwerp. On the same day, the entered Rotterdam. After the surrender of Rotterdam, the left for The Hague, which they reached on 15 May, capturing 3,500 Dutch soldiers as prisoners of war.

In France, the SS &quot;Totenkopf&quot; Division was involved in the only Allied tank counterattack in the Battle of France. On 21 May, units of the 1st Army Tank Brigade, supported by the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, took part in the Battle of Arras. The SS &quot;Totenkopf&quot;, on the southern flank of the 7th Panzer Division, was overrun, finding their standard anti-tank gun, the 3.7 cm PaK 36, was no match for the British Matilda II tank.

After the Dutch surrender, the moved south to France on 24 May. Becoming part of the XIX Panzer Corps under the command of General Heinz Guderian, they took up a position 15 miles south west of Dunkirk along the line of the Aa Canal, facing the Allied defensive line near Watten. A patrol from the SS-VT Division crossed the canal at Saint-Venant, but was destroyed by British armour. A larger force from the SS-VT Division then crossed the canal and formed a bridgehead at Saint-Venant; 30 miles from Dunkirk. That night the OKW ordered the advance to halt, with the British Expeditionary Force trapped. The paused for the night. However, on the following day, in defiance of Hitler&#x27;s orders, Dietrich ordered his 3rd Battalion to cross the canal and take the heights beyond, where British artillery observers were putting the regiment at risk. They assaulted the heights and drove the observers off. Instead of being censured for his act of defiance, Dietrich was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. On that same day, British forces attacked Saint-Venant, forcing the SS-VT Division to retreat.

On 26 May, the German advance resumed. On 27 May, the &quot;Deutschland&quot; Regiment of the SS-VT Division reached the Allied defensive line on the Leie River at Merville. They forced a bridgehead across the river and waited for the SS &quot;Totenkopf&quot; Division to arrive to cover their flank. What arrived first was a unit of British tanks, which penetrated their position. The SS-VT managed to hold on against the British tank force, which got to within 15 feet of commander Felix Steiner&#x27;s position. Only the arrival of the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; &quot;Panzerjäger&quot; platoon saved the &quot;Deutschland&quot; Regiment from being destroyed and their bridgehead lost.

That same day, as the SS &quot;Totenkopf&quot; Division advanced near Merville, they encountered stubborn resistance from British Army units, which slowed their advance. The SS &quot;Totenkopf&quot; 4 Company, then committed the Le Paradis massacre, where 97 captured men of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment were machine gunned after surrendering, with survivors finished off with bayonets. Only two men survived.

By 28 May, the had taken the village of Wormhout, only ten miles from Dunkirk. After their surrender, soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, along with some other units (including French soldiers), were taken to a barn in &quot;La Plaine au Bois&quot; near Wormhout and Esquelbecq. It was there that troops of the &#x27;s 2nd Battalion committed the Wormhoudt massacre, where 81 British and French prisoners of war were murdered.

By 30 May, the British were cornered at Dunkirk, and the SS divisions continued the advance into France. The reached Saint-Étienne, 250 miles south of Paris, and had advanced further into France than any other unit. By the next day, the fighting was all but over. German forces arrived in Paris unopposed on 14 June and France formally surrendered on 25 June. Hitler expressed his pleasure with the performance of the in the Netherlands and France, telling them, &quot;Henceforth it will be an honour for you, who bear my name, to lead every German attack.&quot;

====1940 expansion and naming====

On 19 July 1940, Hitler gave a speech to the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, where he gave a summary of the western campaign and praised the German forces involved. He used the term &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; when describing the units of the LSSAH and SS-VT that took part. From that day forward, the term &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; became the official designation for the SS combat formations. Himmler gained approval for the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; to form its own high command, the &quot;Kommandoamt der Waffen-SS&quot; within the &quot;SS Führungshauptamt&quot;, which was created in August 1940. It received command of the SS-VT (the and the &quot;Verfügungs-Division&quot;, renamed &quot;Reich&quot;) and the armed SS-TV regiments (the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; Division together with several independent &quot;Totenkopf-Standarten&quot;).

In 1940, SS chief of staff Gottlob Berger approached Himmler with a plan to recruit volunteers in the conquered territories from the ethnic German and Germanic populations. At first, Hitler had doubts about recruiting foreigners, but he was persuaded by Himmler and Berger. He gave approval for a new division to be formed from foreign nationals with German officers. By June 1940, Danish and Norwegian volunteers had formed the SS Regiment &quot;Nordland&quot;, with Dutch and Flemish volunteers forming the SS Regiment &quot;Westland&quot;. The two regiments, together with &quot;Germania&quot; (transferred from the &quot;Reich&quot; Division), formed the SS Division &quot;Wiking&quot;. A sufficient number of volunteers came forward requiring the SS to open a new training camp just for foreign volunteers at Sennheim in Alsace-Lorraine.

===1941===
At the beginning of the new year, the &quot;Polizei&quot; Division was brought under FHA administration, although it would not be formally merged into the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; until 1942. At the same time, the &quot;Totenkopf-Standarten&quot;, aside from the three constituting the TK-Division, lost their Death&#x27;s Head designation and insignia and were reclassified &quot;SS-Infanterie-&quot; (or &quot;Kavallerie-&quot;) &quot;Regimente&quot;. The 11th Regiment was transferred into the &quot;Reich&quot; Division to replace &quot;Germania&quot;; the remainder were grouped into three independent brigades and a battle group in Norway.

By the spring of 1941, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; consisted of the equivalent of six or seven divisions: the &quot;Reich&quot;, &quot;Totenkopf&quot;, &quot;Polizei&quot;, and &quot;Wiking&quot; Divisions and &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; (later Division) &quot;Nord&quot;, and the , 1st SS Infantry, 2nd SS Infantry, and SS Cavalry Brigades.

====Balkans====

In March 1941, a major Italian counterattack against Greek forces failed, and Germany came to the aid of its ally. Operation Marita began on 6 April 1941, with German troops invading Greece through Bulgaria and Yugoslavia in an effort to secure its southern flank.

&quot;Reich&quot; was ordered to leave France and head for Romania, and the was ordered to Bulgaria. The , attached to the XL Panzer Corps, advanced west then south from Bulgaria into the mountains, and by 9 April had reached Prilep in Yugoslavia, 30 miles from the Greek border. Further north the &quot;Reich&quot; Division, with the XLI Panzer Corps, crossed the Romanian border and advanced on Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital. Fritz Klingenberg, a company commander in the &quot;Reich&quot;, led his men into Belgrade, where a small group in the vanguard accepted the surrender of the city on 13 April. A few days later the Royal Yugoslav Army surrendered.

The had now crossed into Greece, and on 10 April engaged the 6th Australian Division in the Battle of the Klidi Pass. For 48 hours they fought for control of the heights, often engaging in hand-to-hand combat, eventually gaining control with the capture of Height 997, which opened the pass and allowed the German Army to advance into the Greek interior. This victory gained praise from the OKW: in the order of the day they were commended for their &quot;unshakable offensive spirit&quot; and told that &quot;the present victory signifies for the a new and imperishable page of honour in its history.&quot;

The continued the advance on 13 May. When the Reconnaissance Battalion under the command of Kurt Meyer came under heavy fire from the Greek Army defending the Klisura Pass, they broke through the defenders and captured 1,000 prisoners of war at the cost of only six dead and nine wounded. The next day, Meyer captured Kastoria and took another 11,000 prisoners of war. By 20 May, the had cut off the retreating Greek Army at Metsovo and accepted the surrender of the Greek Epirus-Macedonian Army. As a reward, the was nominally redesignated as a full motorised division, although few additional elements had been added by the start of the Soviet campaign and the &quot;division&quot; remained effectively a reinforced brigade.

====Soviet Union====
Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, started on 22 June 1941, and all the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; formations participated (including the &quot;Reich&quot; Division, which was formally renamed to &quot;Das Reich&quot; by the fall of 1941).

SS Division Nord, which was in northern Finland, took part in Operation Arctic Fox with the Finnish Army and fought at the battle of Salla, where against strong Soviet forces they suffered 300 killed and 400 wounded in the first two days of the invasion. Thick forests and heavy smoke from forest fires disoriented the troops and the division&#x27;s units completely fell apart. By the end of 1941, &quot;Nord&quot; had suffered severe casualties. Over the winter of 1941–42 it received replacements from the general pool of &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; recruits, who were supposedly younger and better trained than the SS men of the original formation, which had been drawn largely from &quot;Totenkopfstandarten&quot; of Nazi concentration camp guards.

The rest of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; divisions and brigades fared better. The &quot;Totenkopf&quot; and &quot;Polizei&quot; divisions were attached to Army Group North, with the mission to advance through the Baltic states and on to Leningrad. The &quot;Das Reich&quot; Division was with Army Group Centre and headed towards Moscow. The and &quot;Wiking&quot; Divisions were with Army Group South, heading for Ukraine and the city of Kiev.

The invasion of the Soviet Union proceeded well at first, but the cost to the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; was extreme: by late October, the was at half strength due to enemy action and dysentery that swept through the ranks. &quot;Das Reich&quot; lost 60% of its strength and was still to take part in the Battle of Moscow. The unit was later decimated in the following Soviet offensive. The &quot;Der Führer&quot; Regiment was reduced to 35 men out of the 2,000 that had started the campaign in June. Altogether, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; had suffered 43,000 casualties.

While the and the SS divisions were fighting in the front line, behind the lines it was a different story. The 1st SS Infantry and 2nd SS Infantry Brigades, which had been formed from surplus concentration camp guards of the SS-TV, and the SS Cavalry Brigade moved into the Soviet Union behind the advancing armies. At first, they fought Soviet partisans and cut off units of the Red Army in the rear of Army Group South, capturing 7,000 prisoners of war, but from mid-August 1941 until late 1942 they were assigned to the Reich Security Main Office headed by Reinhard Heydrich. The brigades were now used for rear area security and policing, and were no longer under army or &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; command. In the autumn of 1941, they left the anti-partisan role to other units and actively took part in the Holocaust. While assisting the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, they participated in the extermination of the Jewish population of the Soviet Union, forming firing parties when required. The three brigades were responsible for the murder of tens of thousands by the end of 1941.
Because it was more mobile and better able to carry out large-scale operations, the SS Cavalry Brigade had 2 regiments with a strength of 3500 men and played a pivotal role in the transition to the wholesale extermination of the Jewish population. In the summer of 1941, Himmler assigned Hermann Fegelein to be in charge of both regiments. On 19 July 1941, Himmler assigned Fegelein&#x27;s regiments to the general command of HSSPF Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski for the &quot;systematic combing&quot; of the Pripyat swamps, an operation designed to round up and exterminate Jews, partisans, and civilians in that area of the Byelorussian SSR.

Fegelein split the territory to be covered into two sections divided by the Pripyat River, with the 1st Regiment taking the northern half and the 2nd Regiment the south. The regiments worked their way from east to west through their assigned territory, and filed daily reports on the number of people killed and taken prisoner. By 1 August, 1st SS Cavalry Regiment under the command of Gustav Lombard was responsible for the death of 800 people; by 6 August, this total had reached 3,000 &quot;Jews and partisans&quot;. Throughout the following weeks, the regiment&#x27;s personnel under Lombard&#x27;s command murdered an estimated 11,000 Jews and more than 400 dispersed soldiers of the Red Army. Thus Fegelein&#x27;s units were among the first in the Holocaust to wipe out entire Jewish communities. Fegelein&#x27;s final operational report dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken and losses of 17 dead, 36 wounded, and 3 missing. Historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700.

===1942===
====1942 expansion====
In 1942, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; was further expanded and a new division was entered on the rolls in March. By the second half of 1942, an increasing number of foreigners, many of whom were not volunteers, began entering the ranks. The 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was recruited from &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; (ethnic Germans) drafted under threat of punishment by the local German leadership from Croatia, Serbia, Hungary, and Romania and used for anti-partisan operations in the Balkans. Himmler approved the introduction of formal compulsory service for the &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; in German-occupied Serbia. Another new division was formed at the same time, when the SS Cavalry Brigade was used as the cadre in the formation of the 8th SS Cavalry Division &quot;Florian Geyer&quot;.

====&quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; divisions====
The front line divisions of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; that had suffered losses through the winter of 1941–1942 and during the Soviet counter-offensive were withdrawn to France to recover and be reformed as &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; divisions. Due to the efforts of Himmler and Hausser, the new commander of the SS Panzer Corps, the three SS &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; divisions , &quot;Das Reich&quot;, and &quot;Totenkopf&quot; were to be formed with a full regiment of tanks rather than only a battalion. This meant that the SS &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; divisions were full-strength Panzer divisions in all but name. They each received nine Tiger tanks, which were formed into the heavy panzer companies.

====Demyansk Pocket====
The Soviet offensive of January 1942 trapped a number of German divisions in the Demyansk Pocket between February and April 1942; the 3rd SS &quot;Totenkopf&quot; Division was one of the divisions encircled by the Red Army. The Red Army liberated Demyansk on 1 March 1943 with the retreat of German troops. &quot;For his excellence in command and the particularly fierce fighting of the &quot;Totenkopf&quot;&quot;, Eicke was awarded Oak Leaves to the Knight&#x27;s Cross on 20 May 1942.

===1943===
====1943 expansion====

The &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; expanded further in 1943: in February the 9th SS Panzer Division &quot;Hohenstaufen&quot; and its sister division, the 10th SS Panzer Division &quot;Frundsberg&quot;, were formed in France. They were followed in July by the 11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Nordland&quot; created from Norwegian and Danish volunteers. September saw the formation of the 12th SS Panzer Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; using volunteers from the Hitler Youth. Himmler and Berger successfully appealed to Hitler to form a Bosnian Muslim division, and the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS &quot;Handschar&quot; (1st Croatian), the first non-Germanic division, was formed, to fight Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Yugoslav Partisans. This was followed by the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician) formed from volunteers from Galicia in western Ukraine. The 15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Latvian) was created in 1943, using compulsory military service in the &quot;Ostland&quot;. The final new division of 1943 was the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;, which was created using the &quot;Sturmbrigade Reichsführer SS&quot; as a cadre. By the end of the year, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; had increased in size from eight divisions and some brigades to 16 divisions. By 1943 the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; could no longer claim to be an &quot;elite&quot; fighting force. Recruitment and conscription based on &quot;numerical over qualitative expansion&quot; took place, with many of the &quot;foreign&quot; units being good for only rear-guard duty.

====Kharkov====

On the Eastern Front, the Germans suffered a devastating defeat when the 6th Army was destroyed during the Battle of Stalingrad. Hitler ordered the SS Panzer Corps back to the Eastern Front for a counter-attack with the city of Kharkov as its objective. The SS Panzer Corps was in full retreat on 19 February, having been attacked by the Soviet 6th Army, when they received the order to counter-attack. Disobeying Hitler&#x27;s order to &quot;stand fast and fight to the death&quot;, Hausser withdrew in front of the Red Army. During Field Marshal Erich von Manstein&#x27;s counteroffensive, the SS Panzer Corps, without support from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; or neighbouring German formations, broke through the Soviet line and advanced on Kharkov. Despite orders to encircle Kharkov from the north, the SS Panzer Corps directly attacked in the Third Battle of Kharkov on 11 March. This led to four days of house-to-house fighting before Kharkov was recaptured by the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; Division on 15 March. Two days later, the Germans recaptured Belgorod, creating the salient that, in July 1943, led to the Battle of Kursk. The German offensive cost the Red Army an estimated 70,000 casualties but the house-to-house fighting in Kharkov was particularly bloody for the SS Panzer Corps, which lost approximately 44% of its strength by the time operations ended in late March.

====Warsaw Ghetto uprising====

The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was a Jewish insurgency that arose within the Warsaw Ghetto from 19 April to 16 May, an effort to prevent the transportation of the remaining population of the ghetto to Treblinka extermination camp. Units involved from the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; were 821 &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; &quot;Panzergrenadiers&quot; from five reserve and training battalions and one cavalry reserve and training battalion.

====Kursk====
For the Battle of Kursk, the SS Panzer Corps was renamed the II SS Panzer Corps and was part of the 4th Panzer Army. The II SS Panzer Corps spearheaded the attack through the Soviet defences. The attack penetrated to a depth of and was then stopped by the Soviet 1st Tank Army.

The Soviet reserves had been sent south to defend against a German attack by the III Panzer Corps. With the loss of their reserves, any hope they may have had of dealing a major defeat to the II SS Panzer Corps ended. But the German advances now failed – despite appalling losses, the Soviet tank armies held the line and prevented the II SS Panzer Corps from making the expected breakthrough.

The failure to break through the Soviet tactical zone and the need to break off the assault by the German 9th Army on the northern shoulder of the Kursk salient due to Operation Kutuzov contributed to Hitler&#x27;s decision to halt the offensive. A parallel attack by the Red Army against the new 6th Army on the Mius river south of Kharkov necessitated the withdrawal of reserve forces held to exploit any success on the southern shoulder of Kursk. The OKW also had to draw on some German troops from the Eastern Front to bolster the Mediterranean theatre following the Allied invasion of Sicily. On 17 July, Hitler called off the operation and ordered a withdrawal. The Soviet Union was not beaten, and the strategic initiative had swung to the Red Army. The Germans were forced onto the defensive as the Red Army began the liberation of Western Russia.

====Italy====
The was thereafter sent to Italy to help stabilise the situation there following the disposal of Benito Mussolini by the Badoglio government and the Allied invasion of Sicily, which marked the beginning of the Italian campaign. The division left behind its armour and equipment, which was given to the &quot;Das Reich&quot; and &quot;Totenkopf&quot; Divisions. After the Italian surrender and collapse of 8 September 1943, the was ordered to begin disarming nearby Italian units. It also had the task of guarding vital road and rail junctions in the north of Italy and was involved in several skirmishes with partisans. This went smoothly, with the exception of a brief skirmish with Italian troops stationed in Parma on 9 September. By 19 September, all Italian forces in the Po River plain had been disarmed, but the OKW received reports that elements of the Italian 4th Army were regrouping in Piedmont, near the French border. Joachim Peiper&#x27;s mechanised 3rd Battalion, 2nd SS &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; Regiment, was sent to disarm these units. On arriving in the province of Cuneo, Peiper was met by an Italian officer who warned that his forces would attack unless Peiper&#x27;s unit vacated the province immediately. After Peiper refused, the Italians attacked. Peiper&#x27;s battalion defeated the Italians, and subsequently shelled and burnt down the village of Boves, killing at least 34 civilians. Peiper&#x27;s battalion then disarmed the remaining Italian forces in the area.

While the was operating in the north, the 16th SS &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Division sent a small battlegroup to contain the Anzio landings in January 1944. In March, the bulk of the 1st &quot;Italienische Freiwilligen Sturmbrigade&quot; (or &quot;Brigata d&#x27;Assalto, Volontari&quot; in Italian) was sent to the Anzio beachhead, where they fought alongside their German allies, receiving favourable reports and taking heavy losses. In recognition of their performance, Himmler declared the unit to be fully integrated into the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;.

===1944===
====1944 expansion====

The &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; expanded again during 1944. January saw the formation of the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian), formed from the two SS infantry brigades as cadre with Latvian conscripts. The 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian) was formed via general conscription in February 1944, around a cadre from the 3rd Estonian SS Volunteer Brigade. The 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS &quot;Skanderbeg&quot; (1st Albanian) was formed in March 1944 from Albanian and Kosovan volunteers, which as with other &quot;eastern formations&quot; were intended for use against &quot;irregular forces&quot;. A second &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; cavalry division followed in April 1944, the 22nd SS Volunteer Cavalry Division &quot;Maria Theresia&quot;. The bulk of the troops were Hungarian Army &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; conscripts transferred to the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; following an agreement between Germany and Hungary. The 23rd SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Nederland&quot; followed, formed from the 4th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Brigade &quot;Nederland&quot;, but it was never more than a large brigade. The 24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS &quot;Karstjäger&quot; was another division that was never more than brigade size, consisting mainly of ethnic German volunteers from Italy and Yugoslavia, along with volunteers from Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, and Ukraine. They were primarily involved in fighting partisans in the Kras region of the Alps on the frontiers of Slovenia, Italy, and Austria, the mountainous terrain requiring specialised mountain troops and equipment. Two Hungarian divisions followed: the 25th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS &quot;Hunyadi&quot; (1st Hungarian) and the 26th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Hungarian). These were formed under the authority of the Hungarian defence minister, at the request of Himmler. One regiment from the Hungarian Army was ordered to join, but they mostly consisted of Hungarian and Romanian volunteers.

The SS Division &quot;Langemarck&quot; was formed next in October 1944, from Flemish volunteers added to the 6th SS Volunteer Assault Brigade &quot;Langemarck&quot;, but again it was nothing more than a large brigade. The 5th SS Volunteer Assault Brigade &quot;Wallonien&quot; was also upgraded to the SS Division &quot;Wallonien&quot;, but it too was never more than a large brigade. Plans to convert the Kaminski Brigade into the 29th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS RONA (1st Russian) were dropped after the execution of their commander, Bronislav Kaminski; instead the Waffen Grenadier Brigade of SS (Italian no. 1) became the 29th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Italian). The 30th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Russian) was formed from the &quot;Schutzmannschaft-Brigade Siegling&quot;. The final new division of late 1944 was the 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division, formed from Hungarians and conscripted &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;.

In November 1944 the 1st Cossack Division, originally mustered by the German Army in 1943, was taken over by the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. The &quot;SS Führungshauptamt&quot; reorganised the division and used further Cossack combat units from the army and the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; to form a 2nd Cossack Division. Both divisions were placed under the command of the XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps on 1 February 1945. With the transfer of the 5th Volunteer &quot;Cossack-Stamm-Regiment&quot; from the &quot;Freiwilligen-Stamm-Division&quot; on the same day the takeover of the Cossack units by the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; was complete.

====Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket====
The Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket was formed in January 1944 when units of the 8th Army withdrew to the Panther-Wotan Line, a defensive position along the Dnieper River in Ukraine. Two army corps were left holding a salient into the Soviet lines extending some . The Red Army&#x27;s 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts encircled the pocket. Trapped in the pocket were a total of six German divisions, including the 5th SS &quot;Wiking&quot; Division, with the attached 5th SS Volunteer Assault Brigade &quot;Wallonien&quot;, and the Estonian SS Battalion &quot;Narwa&quot;. The Germans broke out in coordination with other German forces from the outside, including the 1st SS Panzer Division . Roughly two out of every three encircled men successfully escaped the pocket.

====Raid on Drvar====
The Raid on Drvar, codenamed Operation &quot;Rösselsprung&quot;, was an attack by the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; on the command structure of the Yugoslav partisans. Their objective was the elimination of the partisan-controlled Supreme Headquarters and the capture of Tito. The offensive took place in April and May 1944. The &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; units involved were the 500th SS Parachute Battalion and the 7th SS &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; Division.

The assault started when a small group parachuted into Drvar to secure landing grounds for the following glider force. The 500th SS Parachute Battalion fought their way to Tito&#x27;s cave headquarters and exchanged heavy gunfire resulting in numerous casualties on both sides. By the time German forces had penetrated into the cave, Tito had already escaped. At the end of the battle, only 200 men of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion remained unwounded.

====Baltic states====
In Estonia, the Battle of Narva started in February. The battle can be divided into two phases: the Battle for Narva Bridgehead from February to July and the Battle of Tannenberg Line from July to September. A number of volunteer and conscript &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; units from Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Estonia fought in Narva. The units were all part of the III SS (Germanic) Panzer Corps in Army Group North, which consisted of the 11th SS Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Nordland&quot;, the 4th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Brigade &quot;Nederland&quot;, the 5th SS Volunteer Assault Brigade &quot;Wallonien&quot;, the 6th SS Volunteer Assault Brigade &quot;Langemarck&quot;, and the conscript 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian), under the command of &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Felix Steiner.

Also in Army Group North was the VI SS Corps, which consisted of the 15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Latvian) and the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian). Latvian &quot;Waffen SS&quot; and German Army units held out in the Courland Pocket until the end of the war.

====Normandy====

Operation Overlord, the Allied &quot;D-Day&quot; landings in Normandy, took place on 6 June 1944. In preparation for the expected landings, the I SS Panzer Corps was moved to Septeuil to the west of Paris in April 1944. The corps had the 1st SS Panzer Division &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot;, the 12th SS Panzer Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot;, and the 17th SS Panzergrenadier &quot;Götz von Berlichingen&quot; Divisions, along with the army&#x27;s Panzer-Lehr-Division assigned to it. The corps was to form a part of General Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg&#x27;s Panzer Group West, the Western theatre&#x27;s armoured reserve. The corps was restructured on 4 July 1944 and only the 1st SS and the 12th SS &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; Divisions remained on strength.

After the landings, the first &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; unit in action was the 12th SS &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; Division, which arrived at the invasion front on 7 June, in the Caen area. That same day they committed the Ardenne Abbey massacre against Canadian Army prisoners of war. The next unit to arrive was the 17th SS Division &quot;Götz von Berlichingen&quot; on 11 June, which came into contact with the US 101st Airborne Division. The 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion arrived next to protect the left wing of the I SS Panzer Corps. The 1st SS Division arrived towards the end of the month with lead elements becoming embroiled in the British offensive Operation Epsom.

The only other &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; unit in France at this time was the 2nd SS Panzer Division &quot;Das Reich&quot;, in Montauban, north of Toulouse. They were ordered north to the landing beaches and on 9 June were responsible for the Tulle massacre, where 99 men were murdered. The next day, they reached the village of Oradour-sur-Glane where they massacred 642 civilians including 247 children.

The II SS Panzer Corps, consisting of the 9th SS &quot;Hohenstaufen&quot; and 10th SS &quot;Frundsberg&quot; Panzer Divisions and the 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion, was transferred from the Eastern Front to spearhead an offensive to destroy the Allied beachhead. However, the British launched Operation Epsom and the two divisions were fed piecemeal into the battle, and launched several counterattacks over the following days.

Without any further reinforcements in men or materiel, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; divisions could not stop the Allied advance. Both the 1st SS and 2nd SS Panzer Divisions took part in the failed Operation Lüttich in early August. The end came in mid August when the German Army was encircled and trapped in the Falaise pocket, including the 1st SS, 10th SS, 12th SS, and 17th SS Divisions, while the 2nd SS and 9th SS Panzer Divisions were ordered to attack Hill 262 from the outside in order to keep the gap open. By 22 August, the Falaise pocket had been closed, and all German forces west of the Allied lines were either dead or in captivity. In the fighting around Hill 262 alone, casualties totalled 2,000 killed and 5,000 taken prisoner. The 12th SS Panzer Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; had lost 94 per cent of its armour, nearly all of its artillery, and 70 per cent of its vehicles. The division had close to 20,000 men and 150 tanks before the campaign started, and was now reduced to just 300 men and 10 tanks.
With the German Army in full retreat, two further &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; formations entered the battle in France, the SS Panzergrenadier Brigade 49 and the SS Panzergrenadier Brigade 51. Both had been formed in June 1944 from staff and students at the SS Junker Schools. They were stationed in Denmark to allow the garrison there to move into France, but were brought forward at the beginning of August to the area south and east of Paris. Both brigades were tasked to hold crossings over the Seine River allowing the army to retreat. Eventually, they were forced back and then withdrew, the surviving troops being incorporated into the 17th SS Division.

====Greece====
While the bulk of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; was now on the Eastern Front or in Normandy, the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division was stationed in Greece on internal security duties and anti-partisan operations. On 10 June, they committed the Distomo massacre, when over a period of two hours they went door to door and massacred Greek civilians, reportedly in revenge for a Greek resistance attack. In total, 218 men, women, and children were murdered. According to survivors, the SS forces &quot;bayoneted babies in their cribs, stabbed pregnant women, and beheaded the village priest.&quot;

====Italy====
On the Italian Front, the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;, conducting anti-partisan operations, is remembered more for the atrocities it perpetrated than its fighting ability; the division committed the Sant&#x27;Anna di Stazzema massacre in August 1944 and the Marzabotto massacre between September and October 1944.

====Finland====
In Finland, the 6th SS Mountain Division &quot;Nord&quot; had held its lines during the Soviet summer offensive until it was ordered to withdraw from Finland upon the conclusion of an armistice between Finland and the Soviet Union in September 1944. It then formed the rear guard for the three German corps withdrawing from Finland in Operation Birch, and from September to November 1944 marched 1,600 kilometres to Mo i Rana, Norway, where it entrained for the southern end of the country, crossing the Skagerrak to Denmark.

====Arnhem and Operation Market Garden====
In early September 1944, the II SS Panzer Corps (comprising the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions) was pulled out of the line and sent to the Arnhem area in the Netherlands. Upon arrival, they began the task of refitting, and the majority of the remaining armoured vehicles were loaded onto trains in preparation for transport to repair depots in Germany. On 17 September 1944, the Allies launched Operation Market Garden, and the British 1st Airborne Division was dropped in Oosterbeek, to the west of Arnhem. Realizing the threat, Wilhelm Bittrich, commander of the II SS Panzer Corps, ordered the &quot;Hohenstaufen&quot; and &quot;Frundsberg&quot; divisions to ready themselves for combat. Also in the area was the Training and Reserve Battalion of the 16th SS Division. The Allied airborne operation was a failure, and Arnhem was not liberated until 14 April 1945.

====Warsaw Uprising====

At the other end of Europe, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; was dealing with the Warsaw Uprising. Between August and October 1944, the Dirlewanger Brigade (recruited from criminals and the mentally ill throughout Germany), which included the Azerbaijani Legion (part of the &quot;Ostlegionen&quot;), and the SS Assault Brigade RONA (Russian National Liberation Army), which was made up of anti-Soviet Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian collaborators, were both sent to Warsaw to put down the uprising. During the battle, the Dirlewanger Brigade behaved atrociously, raping, looting, and killing citizens regardless of whether they belonged to the Polish resistance or not; the unit&#x27;s commander SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; Oskar Dirlewanger encouraged their excesses. The unit&#x27;s behaviour was reportedly so bestial and indiscriminate that Himmler was forced to send a battalion of SS military police to ensure the &quot;Dirlewanger&quot; convicts did not turn their aggressions against the leadership of the brigade or other nearby German units. At the same time, they were encouraged by Himmler to terrorise freely, take no prisoners, and generally indulge their perverse tendencies. Favoured tactics during the siege, particularly of the Dirlewanger Brigade, included the ubiquitous gang rape of female Poles, both women and children; playing &quot;bayonet catch&quot; with live babies; and torturing captives to death by hacking off their arms, dousing them with gasoline, and setting them alight to run armless and flaming down the street. The Dirlewanger Brigade committed almost non-stop atrocities during this period, in particular the Wola massacre.

The other unit, the Kaminski Brigade, was tasked with clearing the Ochota district in Warsaw that was defended by members of the Polish Home Army. Their attack was planned for the morning of 5 August, but when the time came, the Kaminski Brigade could not be found; after some searching by the SS military police, members of the unit were found looting abandoned houses in the rear of the German column. Later, thousands of Polish civilians were killed during the events known as the Ochota massacre; many victims were also raped. In the following weeks, the unit was moved south to the Wola district, but it fared no better in combat there than it did in Ochota; in one incident, a sub-unit of the Kaminski Brigade advanced to loot a captured building on the front line, but was subsequently cut off from the rest of the SS formation and wiped out by the Poles. Following the fiasco, SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Bronislav Vladislavovich Kaminski, the unit&#x27;s commander, was called to Łódź to attend an SS leadership conference. He never arrived; official Nazi sources blamed Polish partisans for an alleged ambush that killed the RONA commander. But, according to various other sources, he was arrested and tried by the SS, or simply shot on spot by the Gestapo. The behaviour of the Kaminski Brigade during the battle was an embarrassment even to the SS, and the alleged rape and murder of two German Strength Through Joy girls may have played a part in the eventual execution of the brigade&#x27;s commander.

====Vistula River line====
In late August 1944, the 5th SS Panzer Division &quot;Wiking&quot; was ordered back to Modlin on the Vistula River line near Warsaw, where it was to join the newly formed Army Group Vistula. Fighting alongside the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;&#x27;s 1st Fallschirm-Panzer Division &quot;Hermann Göring&quot;, they were faced against the Soviet 3rd Tank Corps. The advent of the Warsaw Uprising brought the Soviet offensive to a halt, and relative peace fell on the front line. The division remained in the Modlin area, grouped with the 3th SS Panzer Division &quot;Totenkopf&quot; in the IV SS Panzer Corps. Heavy defensive battles around Modlin followed for the rest of the year.

The Ardennes Offensive (popularly known as the &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot;), between 16 December 1944 and 25 January 1945, was a major German offensive through the forested Ardennes mountains region of Belgium. The &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; units included the 6th Panzer Army under Sepp Dietrich. Created on 26 October 1944, it incorporated the I SS Panzer Corps (the 1st and 12th SS Panzer Divisions along with the 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion). It also had the II SS Panzer Corps (the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions). Another unit involved was Otto Skorzeny&#x27;s SS Panzer Brigade 150.

The purpose of the attack was to split the British and American line in half, capture Antwerp, and encircle and destroy four Allied armies, forcing the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty on terms favourable to the Axis Powers. However, advancing through the forests and wooded hills of the Ardennes proved difficult in the winter weather. Initially, the Germans made good progress in the northern end of its advance. However, they ran into unexpectedly strong resistance by the US 2nd and 99th Infantry Divisions. By 23 December, weather conditions started improving, allowing the Allied air forces, which had been grounded, to attack. In increasingly difficult conditions, the German advance slowed. The attack was ultimately a failure. Despite the efforts of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; and the German Army, fuel shortages, stiff American resistance, including in and around the town of Bastogne, and Allied air-assaults on German supply columns proved too much, costing the Germans 700 tanks and most of their remaining mobile forces in the west. Hitler&#x27;s failed counteroffensive had used most of Germany&#x27;s remaining reserves of manpower and materiel, which could not be replaced.

During the battle, &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot;, part of the Division, left a path of destruction, which included &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; soldiers massacring American POWs, raping Belgian women, and looting and murdering unarmed Belgian civilians. It is infamous for the Malmedy massacre, in which approximately 90 unarmed American prisoners of war were murdered on 17 December 1944. Also during this battle, 3./SS-PzAA1 LSSAH captured and shot eleven African-American soldiers from the US 333rd Field Artillery Battalion in the hamlet of Wereth. Their remains were found by Allied troops two months later. The soldiers had their fingers cut off and legs broken, and one was shot while trying to bandage a comrade&#x27;s wounds.

====Siege of Budapest====
In late December 1944, Axis forces, including the IX SS Mountain Corps, defending Budapest, were encircled in the Siege of Budapest. The IV SS Panzer Corps (the 3rd and 5th SS Panzer Divisions) was ordered south to join General Hermann Balck&#x27;s 6th Army (Army Group Balck), which was mustering for a relief effort code named Operation Konrad.

As a part of Operation Konrad I, the IV SS Panzer Corps was committed to action on 1 January 1945, near Tata, with the advance columns of the &quot;Wiking&quot; Division slamming into the Soviet 4th Guards Army. A heavy battle ensued, with the &quot;Wiking&quot; and &quot;Totenkopf&quot; Division destroying many of the Soviet tanks. In three days their panzer spearheads had driven 45 kilometres, over half the distance from the start point to Budapest. The Red Army manoeuvred forces to block the advance, halting them at Bicske, from Budapest. Two further attacks, Operations Konrad II and III, also failed.

The Hungarian Third Army was besieged in Budapest along with the IX SS Mountain Corps (the 8th and 22nd SS Cavalry Divisions). The siege lasted from 29 December 1944 until the city surrendered unconditionally on 13 February 1945. Only 170 men of the 22nd SS Cavalry Division &quot;Maria Theresa&quot; made it back to the German lines.

===1945===
====1945 expansion====
The &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; continued to expand in 1945. January saw the 32nd SS Volunteer Grenadier Division &quot;30 Januar&quot; formed from the remnants of other units and staff from the SS Junker Schools. In February, the Waffen Grenadier Brigade of the SS &quot;Charlemagne&quot; was upgraded to a division and became known as the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS &quot;Charlemagne&quot; (1st French). At this time, it had a strength of 7,340 men. The SS Volunteer Grenadier Brigade &quot;Landstorm Nederland&quot; was upgraded to the 34th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division &quot;Landstorm Nederland&quot;. The second SS police division followed when the 35th SS-Police Grenadier Division was formed from SS police units that had been transferred to the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. The Dirlewanger Brigade was reformed as the 36th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS. As there was now a real shortage of &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; volunteers and conscripts, units from the army were attached to bring it up to strength. The third SS cavalry division, the 37th SS Volunteer Cavalry Division &quot;Lützow&quot;, was formed from the remnants of the 8th and 22nd SS Cavalry Divisions, which had both been virtually destroyed. The last &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; division was the 38th SS Grenadier Division &quot;Nibelungen&quot;, which was formed from students and staff from the SS Junker Schools, but consisted of only around 6,000 men, the strength of a normal brigade.

====Operation Nordwind====
Operation Nordwind was the last major German offensive on the Western Front. It began on 1 January 1945 in Alsace and Lorraine in northeastern France, and it ended on 25 January. The initial attack was conducted by three corps of the 1st Army. By 15 January, at least 17 German divisions (including units in the Colmar Pocket) were engaged, including the XIII SS Army Corps (the 17th and 38th SS Divisions) and the 6th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions. At the same time, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; mounted a large offensive over the skies of France. Some 240 fighters were lost and just as many pilots. It was the &#x27;last gasp&#x27; attempt for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to take back air supremacy from the Western Allies.

====Operation Solstice====
Operation Solstice, or the &quot;Stargard Tank Battle&quot; (February 1945) was one of the last armoured offensive operations on the Eastern Front. It was a limited counterattack by the three Corps of the 11th SS Panzer Army, which was being assembled in Pomerania, against the spearheads of the Soviet 1st Belorussian Front. Originally planned as a major offensive, it was executed as a more limited attack. It was repulsed by the Red Army, but helped to convince the Soviet High Command to postpone the planned attack on Berlin.

Initially, the attack achieved a total surprise, reaching the banks of the Ina River and, on 17 January, Arnswalde. Strong Soviet counterattacks halted the advance, and the operation was called off. The III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps, was pulled back to the Stargard and Stettin on the northern Oder River.

====East Pomeranian Offensive====
The East Pomeranian Offensive lasted from 24 February to 4 April, in Pomerania and West Prussia. The &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; units involved were the 11th SS &quot;Nordland&quot;, 20th SS &quot;Estonian&quot;, 23rd SS &quot;Nederland&quot;, 27th SS &quot;Langemark&quot;, and 28th SS &quot;Wallonien&quot; Divisions all in the III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps and the X SS Corps, which did not command any SS units.

In March 1945, the X SS Corps was encircled by the 1st Guards Tank Army, 3rd Shock Army, and First Polish Army in the area of Dramburg. This pocket was destroyed by the Red Army on 7 March 1945. On 8 March 1945, the Soviets announced the capture of General Krappe and 8,000 men of the corps.

====Operation Spring Awakening====

After the Ardennes offensive failed, in Hitler&#x27;s estimation, the Nagykanizsa oilfields southwest of Lake Balaton were the most strategically valuable reserves on the Eastern Front. The SS divisions were pulled out and refitted in Germany in preparation for Operation Spring Awakening (&quot;Frühlingserwachsen&quot;). Hitler ordered Dietrich&#x27;s 6th Panzer Army to take the lead and move to Hungary in order to protect the oilfields and refineries there. The 6th Panzer Army was made up of the I SS Panzer Corps (the 1st and 12th SS Panzer Divisions) and the II SS Panzer Corps (the 2nd and 10th SS Panzer Divisions). Also present but not part of the 6th Panzer Army was the IV SS Panzer Corps (the 3rd and 5th SS Panzer Divisions).

This final German offensive in the east began on 6 March. The German forces attacked near Lake Balaton with the 6th Panzer Army advancing northwards towards Budapest and the 2nd Panzer Army moving eastwards and south. Dietrich&#x27;s army made &quot;good progress&quot; at first, but as they drew near the Danube, the combination of the muddy terrain and strong resistance by the Soviets ground them to a halt. The overwhelming numerical superiority of the Red Army made any defence impossible, yet Hitler somehow had believed victory was attainable.

After Operation Spring Awakening, the 6th Panzer Army withdrew towards Vienna and was involved what became known as the Vienna Offensive. The only major force to face the attacking Red Army was the II SS Panzer Corps (the 2nd and 3rd SS Panzer Divisions), under the command of Wilhelm Bittrich, along with &quot;ad hoc&quot; forces made up of garrison and anti-aircraft units. Vienna fell to the Soviets on 13 April. Bittrich&#x27;s II SS Panzer Corps had pulled out to the west that evening to avoid encirclement. The LSSAH retreated westward with less than 1,600 men and 16 tanks remaining.

This failure is famous for the &quot;armband order&quot; that followed. The order was issued to Dietrich by Hitler, who claimed that the troops, and more importantly, the 1st SS Division , &quot;did not fight as the situation demanded&quot;. As a mark of disgrace, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; units involved in the battle were ordered to remove their distinctive cuff titles. Dietrich did not relay the order to his troops.

====Berlin====
Army Group Vistula was formed in 1945 to protect Berlin from the advancing Red Army. It fought in the Battle of the Seelow Heights (16–19 April) and the Battle of Halbe (21 April – 1 May), both part of the Battle of Berlin. The &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; was represented by the III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps.

On 23 April, SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Wilhelm Mohnke was appointed by Hitler as Battle Commander for the centre government district (Zitadelle sector), which included the Reich Chancellery and the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;. Mohnke&#x27;s command post was in the bunkers under the Reich Chancellery. He formed &quot;Kampfgruppe Mohnke&quot;, divided into two weak regiments. It was made up of the LSSAH Flak Company, replacements from the LSSAH Training and Reserve Battalion from Spreenhagan (under &quot;Standartenfuhrer&quot; Anhalt), 600 men from the &quot;Begleit-Bataillon Reichsführer-SS&quot;, the Führer-Begleit-Company, and the core group—800 men of the LSSAH Guard Battalion assigned to guard the &quot;Führer&quot;.

On 23 April, the Reich Chancellery ordered SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Gustav Krukenberg to proceed to Berlin with his men, who were reorganised as Assault Battalion &quot;Charlemagne&quot;. Between 320 and 330 French troops arrived in Berlin on 24 April after a long detour to avoid Soviet advance columns. Krukenberg was also appointed the commander of (Berlin) Defence Sector C. This included the &quot;Nordland&quot; Division, whose previous commander, Joachim Ziegler, was relieved of command the same day. On 27 April, after a futile defence, the remnants of &quot;Nordland&quot; were pushed back into the centre government district (Zitadelle sector) in Defence Sector Z. There Krukenberg&#x27;s headquarters was a carriage in the Stadtmitte U-Bahn station. The men of the &quot;Nordland&quot; Division were now under Mohnke&#x27;s overall command. Among the men were French, Latvian, and Scandinavian &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; troops.

A heavy artillery bombardment of the centre government district had begun on 20 April 1945 and lasted until the end of hostilities. Under intense shelling, the SS troops put up stiff resistance which led to bitter and bloody street fighting with the Red Army. By 26 April, the defenders were pushed back into the Reichstag and Reich Chancellery. There, over the next few days, the survivors (mainly French SS troops from the former 33rd SS Division &quot;Charlemagne&quot;) fought in vain against the Soviets.

On 30 April, after receiving news of Hitler&#x27;s suicide, orders were issued that those who could do so were to break out. Prior to the break-out, Mohnke briefed all commanders that could be reached within the Zitadelle sector about Hitler&#x27;s death and the planned break-out. The break out started at 2300 hours on 1 May. There were ten main groups that attempted to head northwest towards Mecklenburg. Fierce fighting continued all around, especially in the Weidendammer Bridge area. What was left of the &quot;Nordland&quot; Division under Krukenberg fought hard in that area, but Soviet artillery, anti-tank guns, and tanks destroyed the groups. Several very small groups managed to reach the Americans at the Elbe&#x27;s west bank, but most, including Mohnke&#x27;s group, could not make it through the Soviet rings.

Himmler fled and attempted to go into hiding. Using a forged paybook under the name of Sergeant Heinrich Hitzinger, he fled south on 11 May to Friedrichskoog. On 21 May, Himmler and two aides were detained at a checkpoint set up by former Soviet POWs and then handed over to the British Army. On 23 May, after Himmler had admitted his real identity, a doctor attempted to examine him. However, Himmler bit into a hidden cyanide pill and collapsed onto the floor. He was dead within 15 minutes.

==Divisions==

All divisions in the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; were ordered in a single series of numbers as formed, regardless of type. A total of 39 were formed, beginning with the initial three in 1933 and ramping up to nine alone in 1945. Those tagged with nationalities were at least nominally recruited from those nationalities. Many of the late-formed higher-numbered units were in fact small battlegroups (&quot;Kampfgruppen&quot;), and divisions in name only.

==Highest ranked commanders==
* Josef &quot;Sepp&quot; Dietrich, a former army sergeant with a peasant background, commanded the forerunner of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, the &quot;Sonderkommando Berlin&quot;. He would command the &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; from its inception to regiment, brigade, and division. He was then given command of the I SS Panzer Corps and by the end of the war was the commander of the 6th Panzer Army.
* Paul Hausser, a former general in the regular army, was chosen by Himmler to transform the SS-VT into a credible military organisation. He was the first divisional commander of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; when the SS-VT was formed into a division for the Battle of France. He went on to command the II SS Panzer Corps and the 7th Army.

==Casualties==

Military historian Rüdiger Overmans estimates that the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; suffered 314,000 dead. Casualty rates were not significantly higher than in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; overall and were comparable to those among the armoured divisions of the army and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; paratroop formations.

==Criminality==

The &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; was responsible for the administration of both the concentration and extermination camps. Many members of it and the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; subsequently became members of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, forming the initial core of the 3rd SS &quot;Totenkopf&quot; Division. A number of SS medical personnel who were members of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; were convicted of crimes during the &quot;Doctors&#x27; trials&quot; in Nuremberg, held between 1946 and 1947 for the Nazi human experimentation they performed at the camps.
According to the &quot;Modern Genocide: The Definitive Resource and Document Collection&quot;, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; had played a &quot;paramount role&quot; in the ideological war of extermination (&quot;Vernichtungskrieg&quot;), and not just as frontline or rear area security formations: a third of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; (mobile death squads) members, which were responsible for mass murder, especially of Jews, Slavs and communists, had been recruited from &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; personnel prior to the invasion of the Soviet Union. The &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; construction office built the gas chambers at Auschwitz, and, according to Rudolf Höss, about 7,000 served as guards at that camp.

Many &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; members and units were responsible for war crimes against civilians and allied servicemen. After the war the SS organisation as a whole was held to be a criminal organisation by the post-war German government. Formations such as the &quot;Dirlewanger&quot; and Kaminski Brigades were singled out, and many others participated in large-scale massacres or smaller-scale killings such as murder of 34 captured allied servicemen ordered by Josef Kieffer during Operation Bulbasket in 1944, the Houtman affair, or murders perpetrated by Heinrich Boere. The listed &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; units were responsible for the following massacres:

* Wormhoudt massacre by the SS Leibstandarte &quot;Adolf Hitler&quot;, 1940, France
* Le Paradis massacre by the SS Division &quot;Totenkopf&quot;, 1940, France
* Pripyat swamps (punitive operation) by the SS Cavalry Brigade, 1941, USSR
* Ascq massacre by the 12th SS Panzer Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot;, 1944, France
* Tulle massacre by 2nd SS Panzer Division &quot;Das Reich&quot;, 1944, France
* Oradour-sur-Glane massacre by the 2nd SS Panzer Division &quot;Das Reich&quot;, 1944, France
* Ochota massacre by the SS Kaminski Brigade, 1944, Poland
* Wola massacre by SS-Sturmbrigade &quot;Dirlewanger&quot;, 1944, Poland
* Huta Pieniacka massacre by the 14th Galician SS Volunteer Division, 1944, Poland
* Graignes Massacre by the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen, 1944, France
* Maillé massacre, also by the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen, 1944, France
* Marzabotto massacre by the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;, 1944, Italy
* Malmedy massacre by Kampfgruppe Peiper, part of the 1st SS Panzer Division, 1944, Belgium
* Wereth 11 massacre by the 1st SS Panzer Division &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot;, 1944, Belgium
* Ardeatine massacre by two SS officers, 1944, Italy
* Distomo massacre by the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division, 1944, Greece
* Sant&#x27;Anna di Stazzema massacre by the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS, 1944, Italy
* Doli Pivski massacre by the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen and 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian), 1943, Montenegro 
* Ardenne Abbey massacre by the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend, 1944, France
* Velika massacre by the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen and 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg, 1944, Montenegro

The linking of the SS-VT with the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; (SS-TV) in 1938 raised important questions about &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; criminality, since the SS-TV were already responsible for the imprisonment, torture, and murder of Jews and other political opponents through providing the personnel for manning the concentration camps. Their leader, Theodor Eicke, who was the commandant of Dachau, inspector of the camps, and murderer of Ernst Röhm, later became the commander of the 3rd SS &quot;Totenkopf&quot; Division. With the invasion of Poland, the &quot;Totenkopfverbände&quot; troops were called on to carry out so-called &quot;police and security measures&quot; in rear areas. What these measures entailed is demonstrated by the record of &quot;SS Totenkopf Standarte Brandenburg&quot;. It arrived in Włocławek on 22 September 1939 and embarked on a four-day &quot;Jewish action&quot; that included the burning of synagogues and the execution en masse of the leaders of the Jewish community. On 29 September the Standarte travelled to Bydgoszcz to conduct an &quot;intelligentsia action&quot;. Approximately 800 Polish civilians and what the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) termed &quot;potential resistance leaders&quot; were killed. Later the formation became the 3rd SS Panzer Division &quot;Totenkopf&quot;, but from the start they were among the first executors of a policy of systematic extermination.

&quot;Waffen-SS&quot; formations were found guilty of war crimes, especially in the opening and closing phases of the war. In addition to documented atrocities, &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; units assisted in rounding up Eastern European Jews for deportation and utilised scorched earth tactics during rear security operations. Some &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; personnel convalesced at concentration camps, from which they were drawn, by serving guard duties. Other members of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; were more directly involved in genocide.

The end of the war saw a number of war crime trials, including the Malmedy massacre trial. The counts of indictment related to the massacre of more than 300 American prisoners in the vicinity of Malmedy, between 16 December 1944 and 13 January 1945, and the massacre of 100 Belgian civilians mainly in the vicinity of Stavelot.

During the Nuremberg Trials, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; was declared a criminal organisation for its major involvement in war crimes and for being an &quot;integral part&quot; of the SS. An exception was made for conscripts who were not given a choice in joining the ranks, and had not committed &quot;such crimes&quot;. They were determined to be exempt.

In 2016, the Polish parliament classified the crimes of the 14th Grenadier Division&#x27;s soldiers against the Polish population as genocide.

==Post-war==
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the dissemination of propaganda material and the use of SS symbols are a crime and punishable by Sections 86 and 86a of the German Criminal Code.

===Waffen-SS veterans in post-war Germany===
&quot;Waffen-SS&quot; veterans in post-war Germany played a large role, through publications and political pressure, in the efforts to rehabilitate the reputation of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, which had committed many war crimes during World War II. High ranking German politicians such as Konrad Adenauer, Franz Josef Strauss, and Kurt Schumacher courted former &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; members and their veteran organisation, HIAG, in an effort to tap into the voter potential, and helped deflect blame for war crimes onto other branches of the SS. A small number of veterans served in the new German armed forces, the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;, something that raised national and international unease in regard to how it would affect the democratic nature of the new army.

SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Heinz Lammerding, who commanded the &quot;Das Reich&quot; Division that perpetrated the Tulle and the Oradour-sur-Glane massacres in occupied France, died in 1971, following a successful business career in West Germany. The West German government refused to extradite him to France.
A historical review in Germany of the impact of &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; veterans in post-war German society continues, and a number of books on the subject have been published in recent years.

&quot;Waffen-SS&quot; veterans have received pensions (West Germany&#x27;s War Victims&#x27; Assistance Act, or the &quot;Bundesversorgungsgesetz&quot;) from the German government. According to &quot;The Times of Israel&quot;, &quot;The benefits come through the Federal Pension Act, which was passed in 1950 to support war victims, whether civilians or veterans of the Wehrmacht or Waffen-SS.&quot;

On 22 June 2005, the Italian military court in La Spezia found ten former &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; officers and NCOs living in Germany guilty of participation in the Sant&#x27;Anna di Stazzema massacre and sentenced them &quot;in absentia&quot; to life imprisonment. However, extradition requests from Italy were rejected by Germany.

===Baltic states===
In 1990, Latvian Legion veterans started commemorating &#x27;Legionnaire Day&#x27; (&quot;Leģionāru diena&quot;) in Latvia. On 21 February 2012, The Council of Europe&#x27;s Commission against Racism and Intolerance published its report on Latvia (fourth monitoring cycle), in which it condemned commemorations of persons who fought in the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;.

Estonian Waffen SS Grenadier Division veterans have participated in yearly commemoration of the Battle of Tannenberg Line at Sinimäed Hills in Estonia.

===Finland===

Three former members of the Waffen SS served as ministers of defense; the Finnish SS Battalion officers Sulo Suorttanen and Pekka Malinen as well as Mikko Laaksonen, a soldier in the Finnish SS-Company, formed of pro-Nazi defectors.

The Nordic Resistance Movement and Finns Party, along with other nationalist organizations, organizes an annual torch march demonstration in Helsinki in memory of the Finnish SS Battalion on Finnish independence day, which ends at the Hietaniemi cemetery where participiants visit the tomb of Marshal Baron Mannerheim and the monument to the Finnish SS Battalion. The event has been protested by antifascists, which has led to counterdemonstrators being violently assaulted by the NRM members who act as security. The demonstration attracts close to 3000 participants according to the estimates of the police and hundreds of officers patrol Helsinki to prevent violent clashes. The march has been attended and promoted by the Finns Party, and condemned by left-wing parties, for example Green League MP Iiris Suomela characterized it as &quot;obviously neo-nazi&quot; and expressed her disappointment in it being attended by such a large number of people.

In between 2019 and 2022, Finns party MP and later Minister of Economic Affairs Vilhelm Junnila made four budgetary motions in order to support Veljesapu-Perinneyhdistys, a Finnish organization that cherishes the heritage of the Finnish volunteers in the Waffen-SS. Junnila wrote in his motion, that the support would be &quot;for the promotion of balanced historical research&quot;.

===HIAG lobby group===

HIAG (, literally &quot;Mutual aid association of former &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; members&quot;) was a lobby group and a revisionist veterans&#x27; organisation founded by former high-ranking &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; personnel in West Germany in 1951. It campaigned for the legal, economic and historical rehabilitation of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, using contacts with political parties to manipulate them for its purposes. Kurt Meyer, &quot;Brigadeführer&quot; of the 12th SS Division, a convicted war criminal, was HIAG&#x27;s most effective spokesperson.

HIAG&#x27;s historical revisionism encompassed multi-prong propaganda efforts, including periodicals, books and public speeches, alongside a publishing house that served as a platform for its publicity aims. This extensive body of work – 57 book titles and more than 50 years of monthly periodicals – have been described by historians as revisionist apologia: [a] &quot;chorus of self-justification&quot;; &quot;crucible of historical revisionism&quot;; &quot;false&quot; and &quot;outrageous&quot; claims; &quot;most important works of [&quot;Waffen-SS&quot;] apologist literature&quot; (in reference to books by Hausser and Steiner); and &quot;exculpating multi-volume chronicle&quot; (in reference to the history of the SS Division ).

Always in touch with its Nazi past, HIAG was a subject of significant controversy, both in West Germany and abroad, since its founding. The organisation drifted into right-wing extremism in its later history. It was disbanded in 1992 at the federal level, but local groups, along with the organisation&#x27;s monthly periodical, continued to exist at least into the 2000s.

While the HIAG leadership only partially achieved the goals of legal and economic rehabilitation of &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, falling short of their &quot;extravagant fantasies about [&quot;Waffen-SS&quot;″s] past and future&quot;, HIAG&#x27;s propaganda efforts have led to a reshaping of the image of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; in popular culture. The results are still felt, with scholarly works being drowned out by a &quot;veritable avalanche of titles&quot;, including amateur historical studies, memoirs, picture books, websites, and wargames.

=== Ukraine ===
In 2020, the Ukrainian Supreme Court ruled that symbols of SS Division Galicia (14th Grenadier Division) do not belong to the Nazis and were not banned in the country. However, the division&#x27;s insignia is classified as a Nazi and hate symbol by the non-governmental Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union and Freedom House.

On 28 April, an annual march is organised in Lviv to celebrate the anniversary of the 14th Grenadier Division&#x27;s foundation. On 30 April 2021, after the march was held in Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated: &quot;We categorically condemn any manifestation of propaganda of totalitarian regimes, in particular the National Socialist, and attempts to revise truth about World War II.&quot; The march was condemned by the German and Israeli governments.

<doc id="33187" wikidata="Q134942" url="?curid=33187" title="W. Somerset Maugham">
<text>William Somerset Maugham ( ; 25 January 1874 – 16 December 1965) was an English writer, known for his plays, novels and short stories. Born in Paris, where he spent his first ten years, Maugham was schooled in England and went to a German university. He became a medical student in London and qualified as a physician in 1897. He never practised medicine, and became a full-time writer. His first novel, &quot;Liza of Lambeth&quot; (1897), a study of life in the slums, attracted attention, but it was as a playwright that he first achieved national celebrity. By 1908 he had four plays running at once in the West End of London. He wrote his 32nd and last play in 1933, after which he abandoned the theatre and concentrated on novels and short stories.

Maugham&#x27;s novels after &quot;Liza of Lambeth&quot; include &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1915), &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; (1919), &quot;The Painted Veil&quot; (1925), &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1944). His short stories were published in collections such as &quot;The Casuarina Tree&quot; (1926) and &quot;The Mixture as Before&quot; (1940); many of them have been adapted for radio, cinema and television. His great popularity and prodigious sales provoked adverse reactions from highbrow critics, many of whom sought to belittle him as merely competent. More recent assessments generally rank &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; – a book with a large autobiographical element – as a masterpiece, and his short stories are widely held in high critical regard. Maugham&#x27;s plain prose style became known for its lucidity, but his reliance on clichés attracted adverse critical comment.

During the First World War Maugham worked for the British Secret Service, later drawing on his experiences for stories published in the 1920s. Although primarily homosexual, he attempted to conform to some extent with the norms of his day. After a three-year affair with Syrie Wellcome which produced their daughter, Liza, they married in 1917. The marriage lasted for twelve years, but before, during and after it, Maugham&#x27;s principal partner was a younger man, Gerald Haxton. Together they made extended visits to Asia, the South Seas and other destinations; Maugham gathered material for his fiction wherever they went. They lived together in the French Riviera, where Maugham entertained lavishly. After Haxton&#x27;s death in 1944, Alan Searle became Maugham&#x27;s secretary-companion for the rest of the author&#x27;s life. Maugham gave up writing novels shortly after the Second World War, and his last years were marred by senility. He died at the age of 91.

==Life and career==
===Background and early years===
William Somerset Maugham came from a family of lawyers. His grandfather, Robert Maugham (1788–1862), was a prominent solicitor and co-founder of the Law Society of England and Wales. Maugham&#x27;s father, Robert Ormond Maugham (1823–1884), was a prosperous solicitor, based in Paris; his wife, Edith Mary, &quot;née&quot; Snell, lived most of her life in France, where all the couple&#x27;s children were born. Robert Maugham handled the legal affairs of the British Embassy there, as his eldest surviving son, Charles, later did. The second son, Frederic, became a barrister, and had a distinguished legal career in Britain – &quot;The Times&quot; described him as &quot;a great legal figure&quot; – serving as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary (1935–1938) and Lord Chancellor (1938–1939). The two younger sons became writers: Henry (1868–1904) wrote poetry, essays and travel books.

Shortly before the birth of the Maughams&#x27; fourth son the government of France proposed a new law under which all boys born on French soil to foreign parents would automatically be French citizens and liable to conscription for military service. The British ambassador, Lord Lyons, had a maternity ward set up within his embassy – which was legally recognised as UK territory – enabling British couples in France to circumvent the new law, and it was there that William Somerset Maugham was born on 25 January 1874. Maugham never greatly liked his middle name – which commemorated a great-uncle named after General Sir Henry Somerset – and was known by family and friends throughout his life as &quot;Willie&quot;.

Maugham&#x27;s mother died of tuberculosis in January 1882, a few days after his eighth birthday. He later said that for him her loss was &quot;a wound that never entirely healed&quot; and even in old age he kept her photograph at his bedside. Two and a half years after his mother&#x27;s death his father died, and Maugham was sent to England to live with his paternal uncle Henry MacDonald Maugham, the vicar of Whitstable in Kent.

After spending the first ten years of his life in Paris, Maugham found an unwelcome contrast in life at Whitstable, which according to his biographer Ted Morgan &quot;represented social obligation and conformity, the narrow-minded provincialism of nineteenth-century small-town English life&quot;. He found his uncle and aunt well-meaning but remote by contrast with the loving warmth of his home in Paris; he became shy and developed a stammer that stayed with him all his life. In a 2004 biography of Maugham, Jeffrey Meyers comments, &quot;His stammer, a psychological and physical handicap, and his gradual awareness of his homosexuality made him furtive and secretive&quot;. Maugham&#x27;s biographer Selina Hastings describes as &quot;the first step in Maugham&#x27;s loss of faith&quot; his disillusion when the God in whom he had been taught to believe failed to answer his prayers for relief from his troubles. In his teens he became a lifelong non-believer.

From 1885 to 1890 Maugham attended The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, where he was regarded as an outsider and teased for his poor English (French had been his first language), his short stature, his stammer, and his lack of interest in sport. He left as soon as he could, although he later developed an affection for the school, and became a generous benefactor. A modest legacy from his father enabled him to go to Heidelberg University to study. His aunt, who was German, arranged accommodation for him, and aged sixteen he travelled to Germany. For the next year and a half he studied literature, philosophy and German. During his time in Heidelberg he had his first sexual affair; it was with John Ellingham Brooks, an Englishman ten years his senior. Brooks encouraged Maugham&#x27;s ambitions to be a writer and introduced him to the works of Schopenhauer and Spinoza. Maugham wrote his first book while in Heidelberg, a biography of the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer, but it was not accepted for publication and the author destroyed the manuscript.

After Maugham&#x27;s return to Britain in 1892, he and his uncle had to decide on his future. He did not wish to follow his brothers to Cambridge University, and his stammer precluded a career in the church or the law even if either had attracted him. His uncle ruled out the civil service, believing that it was no longer a career for gentlemen after reforms requiring applicants to pass an entrance examination. A family friend found Maugham a position in an accountant&#x27;s office in London, which he endured for a month before resigning. The local physician in Whitstable suggested the medical profession, and Maugham&#x27;s uncle agreed. Maugham, who had been writing steadily since he was 15, intended to make his career as an author, but he dared not tell his guardian. From 1892 until he qualified in 1897, he studied medicine at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital Medical School in Lambeth.

===Early works===

In his work as a medical student Maugham met the poorest working-class people: &quot;I was in contact with what I most wanted, life in the raw&quot;. In maturity, he recalled the value of his experiences: &quot;I saw how men died. I saw how they bore pain. I saw what hope looked like, fear and relief; I saw the dark lines that despair drew on a face.&quot;

Maugham took rooms in Westminster, across the Thames from the hospital. He made himself comfortable there, filled many notebooks with literary ideas, and continued writing nightly, while studying for his medical degree. In 1897 he published his first novel, &quot;Liza of Lambeth&quot;, a tale of working-class adultery and its consequences. It drew its details from his obstetric duties in South London slums. He wrote near the opening of the novel: &quot;... it is impossible always to give the exact unexpurgated words of Liza and the other personages of the story; the reader is therefore entreated with his thoughts to piece out the necessary imperfections of the dialogue&quot;.

The book received mixed reviews. &quot;The Evening Standard&quot; commented that there had not been so powerful a story of slum life since Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Record of Badalia Herodsfoot&quot; (1890), and praised the author&#x27;s &quot;vividness and knowledge ... extraordinary gift of directness and concentration ... His characters have an astounding amount of vitality&quot;. &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot; praised the writing but deplored the subject matter, and &quot;The Times&quot; also conceded the author&#x27;s skill – &quot;Mr Maugham seems to aspire, and not unsuccessfully, to be the Zola of the New Cut&quot; – but thought him &quot;capable of better things [than] this singularly unpleasant novel&quot;. The first print run sold out within three weeks and a reprint was quickly arranged. Maugham qualified as a physician the month after the publication of &quot;Liza of Lambeth&quot; but he immediately abandoned medicine and embarked on his 65-year career as a writer. He later said, &quot;I took to it as a duck takes to water.&quot;

Before the publication of his next novel, &quot;The Making of a Saint&quot; (1898), Maugham travelled to Spain. He found Mediterranean lands much to his liking, for what his biographer Frederic Raphael calls their &quot;&quot;douceur de vivre&quot; missing under grim English skies&quot;. He based himself in Seville, where he grew a moustache, smoked cigars, took lessons in the guitar, and developed a passion for &quot;a young thing with green eyes and a gay smile&quot; (gender carefully unspecified, as Hastings comments).
&quot;The Making of a Saint&quot;, a historical novel, attracted less attention than &quot;Liza of Lambeth&quot; and its sales were unremarkable. Maugham continued to write assiduously and within five years he published two more novels and a collection of short stories, and had his first play produced; but a success to match that of his first book eluded him. Between 1903 and 1906 he wrote two more plays, a travel book and two novels, but his next big commercial and critical success did not come until October 1907, when his comedy &quot;Lady Frederick&quot; opened at the Court Theatre in London. He had written it four years earlier, but numerous managements turned it down until Otho Stuart accepted it and cast the popular Ethel Irving in the title role. It ran for 422 performances at five different West End theatres. By the next year, while the run of &quot;Lady Frederick&quot; continued, Maugham had three other plays running simultaneously in London.
Maugham later said that he made comparatively little money from this unprecedented theatrical achievement, but it made his reputation. &quot;Punch&quot; printed a cartoon of Shakespeare&#x27;s ghost looking concerned about the ubiquity of Maugham&#x27;s plays. Between 1908 and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Maugham wrote a further eight plays, but his stage successes did not completely distract him from writing novels. His supernatural thriller &quot;The Magician&quot; (1908) had a principal character modelled on Aleister Crowley, a well-known occultist. Crowley took offence and wrote a critique of the novel in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, charging Maugham with &quot;varied, shameless and extensive&quot; plagiarism.

Maugham was acutely conscious of the fate of Oscar Wilde, whose arrest and imprisonment took place when Maugham was in his early twenties. Lifelong, Maugham was highly reticent about homosexual encounters, but it was thought by at least two of his lovers that at this period in his life he had recourse to young male prostitutes. Nevertheless he had a wish to marry, which he later greatly regretted. Looking back, he described his early attempts to be heterosexual as the greatest mistake in his life. He told his nephew Robin, &quot;I tried to persuade myself that I was three-quarters normal and that only a quarter of me was queer – whereas really it was the other way round&quot;. In 1913 he proposed to the actress Sue Jones, daughter of the playwright Henry Arthur Jones; she declined his offer. In 1914 he began an affair with Syrie Wellcome, whom he had known since 1910. She was married to the pharmaceutical magnate Henry Wellcome, but the couple had formally separated in 1909, after which she had a succession of partners, including the retailer Harry Gordon Selfridge.

===First World War===
By 1914 Maugham was famous, with thirteen plays and eight novels completed. Too old to enlist when the First World War broke out, he served in France as a volunteer ambulance driver for the British Red Cross. Among his colleagues was Frederick Gerald Haxton, a young San Franciscan, who became his lover and companion for the next thirty years, but the affair between Maugham and Syrie Wellcome continued.

In the weeks before the war began, Maugham had been completing his novel &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;, a Bildungsroman with substantial autobiographical elements. The critic John Sutherland says of it:
According to some of Maugham&#x27;s intimates, the main female character, the manipulative Mildred, was based on &quot;a youth, probably a rent boy, with whom he became infatuated&quot;. Raphael comments that there is no firm evidence for this, and Meyers suggests that she is based on Harry Phillips, a young man whom Maugham had taken to Paris as, nominally, his secretary for a prolonged stay in 1905.

Maugham proofread &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; at Malo-les-Bains, near Dunkirk, during a lull in his ambulance duties. When the book was published in 1915 some of the initial reviews were favourable but many, both in Britain and in the US, were unenthusiastic. The &quot;New York World&quot; described the romantic obsession of the protagonist as &quot;the sentimental servitude of a poor fool&quot;. The tide of opinion was turned by the influential American novelist and critic Theodore Dreiser, who called Maugham a great artist and the book a work of genius, of the utmost importance, comparable to a Beethoven symphony. Bryan Connon comments in &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, &quot;After this it seemed that Maugham could not fail, and the public eagerly bought his novels [and] volumes of his carefully crafted short stories&quot;.

In 1915 Syrie Wellcome became pregnant, and in September, while Maugham was on leave to be with her, she gave birth to their only child, Mary Elizabeth, known as Liza. The baby was legally the daughter of Henry Wellcome, although he had not seen his wife for many years. He successfully sued for divorce in 1916, citing Maugham as co-respondent.

===Secret Service and marriage===
After the birth of his daughter, Maugham moved to Switzerland. His fluency in French and German was an advantage, and for a year he worked in Geneva – at his own expense – as an agent for the British Secret Service. He was recruited by Sir John Wallinger, a friend of Syrie, portrayed as the spymaster &quot;R&quot; in the &quot;&quot; stories Maugham wrote after the war. Syrie and Liza were with him for part of the year, providing a convincing domestic cover, and his profession as a writer enabled him to travel about and stay in hotels without attracting attention. His covert job, which was in violation of Switzerland&#x27;s neutrality laws, was to coordinate the work of British agents in enemy territory and dispatch their information to London. In his overt capacity as an author he wrote &quot;Caroline&quot;, a three-act comedy, which opened in February 1916 at the New Theatre, London, with Irene Vanbrugh in the title role.
In November 1916 Maugham was asked by the intelligence service to go to the South Seas. Samoa was regarded as crucial to Britain&#x27;s strategic interests, and Maugham&#x27;s task was to gather information about the island&#x27;s powerful radio transmitter and the threat from German military and naval forces in the region. He was reunited with Haxton, who joined him as secretary-companion. In addition to his intelligence work, Maugham gathered material for his fiction wherever he went. He was, by his own account, not a particularly imaginative or inventive person, but he studied people and places and used them, sometimes with minimal alteration or disguise, in his stories. He was helped in this by Haxton – extrovert and gregarious in contrast with Maugham&#x27;s shyness – who became what Morgan terms an &quot;intermediary with the outside world&quot;. Maugham wrote of Haxton:

After the South Seas trip Maugham visited the US and was joined by Syrie. In May 1917 they married at a ceremony in New Jersey. He entered the marriage from a sense of duty rather than from personal inclination, and the two quickly began to grow apart. She returned to England and he continued with his work as a secret agent. He was selected by Sir William Wiseman of British Intelligence to go to Russia, where the overthrow of the monarchy threatened to lead to a Russian withdrawal from the war. Maugham&#x27;s job was to counter German propaganda, and to encourage the moderate republican Russian government under Alexander Kerensky to continue fighting. He arrived in Petrograd in August, too late to influence the outcome: in November, Kerensky was supplanted by Lenin and the Bolsheviks, who took Russia out of the war.

By that time Maugham was ill with tuberculosis. He returned to Britain and spent three months in a sanatorium in Scotland. While there he wrote a farce, &quot;Home and Beauty&quot;, which was presented at the Playhouse Theatre in August 1919 starring Gladys Cooper and Charles Hawtrey. In the same year Maugham published one of his best-known novels, &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot;, about a respectable stockbroker who rebels against conformity, abandons his wife and children, flees to Tahiti and becomes a painter. It was well received: reviewers called it &quot;extraordinarily powerful and interesting&quot;, and &quot;a triumph [that] has given me such pleasure and entertainment as rarely comes my way&quot;; one described it as &quot;an exhibition of the beast in man, done with such perfect art that it is beyond praise&quot;.

===1920s: travel and divorce===

After the war Maugham had to choose between living in Britain or being with Haxton, because the latter was refused admission to the country. The lifelong ban followed his arrest and trial over a homosexual incident in 1915. He was acquitted, but was nonetheless registered as an &quot;undesirable alien&quot;. When in Britain, Maugham lived with his wife at their house in Marylebone, but the couple were temperamentally incompatible, and their relationship grew increasingly fractious. He spent much time travelling with Haxton. They visited the Far East together in 1919–20, keeping Maugham away from home for six months.

In late 1920 Maugham and Haxton set out on a trip that lasted more than a year. In the US they spent time in Hollywood, which Maugham despised from the first, but found highly remunerative. They then visited San Francisco and sailed to Honolulu and Australia before the final leg of their voyage, to Singapore and the Malay Peninsula, where they remained for six months. Maugham, as always, observed closely and collected material for his stories wherever they went. His fellow author Cyril Connolly wrote, &quot;there will remain a story-teller&#x27;s world from Singapore to the Marquesas that is exclusively and forever Maugham&quot;. In 1922–23 Maugham&#x27;s next extended trip was in south and east Asia, with stops at Colombo, Rangoon, Mandalay, Bangkok and Hanoi.

In Maugham&#x27;s absence his wife found an occupation, becoming a sought-after interior designer. Her concentration on her work briefly lessened the domestic tensions at the couple&#x27;s house when Maugham was in residence. By 1925, Maugham, learning that his wife was spreading scandal about his private life and had taken lovers of her own, was reconsidering his future. After another long trip to the Far East, he agreed with Syrie that they would live separately, she in London and he at Cap Ferrat in the south of France. They divorced in 1929.

During the 1920s Maugham published one novel (&quot;The Painted Veil&quot;, (1925)), three books of short stories (&quot;The Trembling of a Leaf&quot; (1921), &quot;The Casuarina Tree&quot; (1926) and &quot;&quot; (1928)) and a travel book (&quot;On a Chinese Screen&quot;, (1922)) but much of his work was for the theatre. He wrote seven plays during the decade: &quot;The Unknown&quot; (1920), &quot;The Circle&quot; (1921), &quot;East of Suez&quot; (1922), &quot;The Camel&#x27;s Back&quot; (1923), &quot;The Constant Wife&quot; (1926), &quot;The Letter&quot; (1927) and &quot;The Sacred Flame&quot; (1928). His longest-running play of the decade, and of his whole career, was &quot;Our Betters&quot;. It was written in 1915 and staged in New York in 1917, for a satisfactory but not unusual 112 performances, but when produced in the West End in 1923 it was played 548 times.

===1930–1940===

In 1930 Maugham published the novel &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot;, regarded by Connon as the most likely of the author&#x27;s works to survive. This book, described by Raphael as &quot;an elegant piece of literary malice&quot;, is a satire on the literary world and a humorously cynical observation of human mating. There was hostile comment in the press that the central figure seemed to be a tasteless parody of Thomas Hardy, who had died in 1928. Maugham further damaged his own reputation by denying that another character, Alroy Kear – a superficial novelist of more pushy ambition than literary talent – was a caricature of Hugh Walpole. Few believed Maugham&#x27;s denial and he eventually admitted it was a lie. Hastings quotes a contemporary&#x27;s view that Kear was Maugham&#x27;s revenge on Walpole for &quot;a stolen boyfriend, an unrequited love and an old canker of jealousy&quot;.

By the early 1930s Maugham had grown tired of the theatre. He told Noël Coward in 1933:

Maugham&#x27;s thirty-second and last play was &quot;Sheppey&quot; (1933). It was a departure from his previous style; its moral ambiguity and equivocal ending puzzled the critics and the public. Despite some help from Coward in the drafting and having Ralph Richardson as star and John Gielgud as director, it ran for a modest 83 performances. Maugham later wrote, &quot;I grew conscious that I was no longer in touch with the public that patronises the theatre. This happens in the end to most dramatists, and they are wise to accept the warning. It is high time for them then to retire. I did so with relief.&quot; Raphael suggests that Maugham now wished to write to please himself rather than others.
Maugham&#x27;s days of lengthy trips to distant places were mostly behind him, but at Kipling&#x27;s suggestion he sailed to the West Indies in 1936. The British colonies there failed to provide him with anything like the material he had gathered in the Asian outposts in the 1920s, but the French penal settlement on Devil&#x27;s Island furnished him with some stories. During a visit to India in 1938 he found his interest prompted less by the British expatriates than by Indian philosophers and ascetics: &quot;As soon as the Maharajas realized that I didn&#x27;t want to go on tiger hunts but that I was interested in seeing poets and philosophers they were very helpful.&quot; He visited the Hindu sage Ramana Maharishi at his ashram, and later used him as the model for the spiritual guru of his 1944 novel &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;.

Throughout the decade Maugham, with Haxton in attendance, lived and entertained lavishly at his house on Cap Ferrat, the Villa La Mauresque. His domestic staff there comprised thirteen servants. When the Second World War began in 1939 he stayed in his home as long as he could, but in June 1940 France surrendered; knowing himself to be proscribed by the Nazis (Joseph Goebbels denounced him personally) Maugham made his way to England in uncomfortable conditions on a coal freighter from Nice. Haxton, as a citizen of neutral America, was not in immediate peril from the Germans and remained at the villa, securing it and its contents as far as possible, before making his way via Lisbon to New York.

===Second World War===
Maugham spent most of the war years in the US, based for much of the time at a comfortable house on the estate of his American publisher, Nelson Doubleday. His lifestyle was modest: he felt that despite his considerable wealth he should not live luxuriously while Britain was enduring wartime privations. He saw little of Haxton, who undertook war work in Washington DC. As always, Maugham wrote continually. His daily routine was to write between an early breakfast and lunchtime, after which he entertained himself. His most substantial book from the war years was &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;; he found writing it unusually tiring – he was seventy when it was completed – and vowed it would be the last long novel he wrote.

Haxton was holding down a responsible job in Washington and enjoying his new independence and self-reliance. Maugham was happy for him and was reconciled to the possibility of returning to La Mauresque without him after the war. The possibility became a certainty when in November 1944, after a six-month illness initially diagnosed as pleurisy, Haxton died of tuberculosis. Maugham was distraught; he told his nephew, Robin, &quot;You&#x27;ll never know how great a grief this has been to me. The best years of my life – those we spent wandering about the world – are inextricably connected with him. And in one way or another – however indirectly – all I&#x27;ve written during the last twenty years has something to do with him&quot;.

Even before Haxton&#x27;s mortal illness, Maugham had already chosen a replacement as secretary-companion, in anticipation that Haxton would not return to live at La Mauresque. This was Alan Searle, whom Maugham had known since 1928, when Searle was twenty-three. He came from Bermondsey, a poor district of London. Morgan describes him:

Maugham&#x27;s biographers have differed considerably about Searle&#x27;s character and his influence for better or worse on his employer. Connon writes, &quot;He was seen by some as a near saint and by others, particularly the Maugham family, as a villain&quot;; Hastings labels him &quot;a podgy Iago ... constantly briefing against [Syrie and Liza]&quot;, and quotes Alan Pryce-Jones&#x27;s summary: &quot;an intriguer, a schemer with a keen eye to his own advantage, a troublemaker&quot;. Raphael calls him &quot;a man of more reliable stamp&quot; than Haxton; Meyers describes him as &quot;sober, efficient, honest and gentle&quot;.

===Post-war and final years===
Before returning to the south of France after the war, Maugham travelled to England and lived in London until the end of 1946. While there, he established and endowed the Somerset Maugham Award, to be administered by the Society of Authors and given annually for a work of fiction, non-fiction, or poetry written by a British subject under the age of thirty-five. After returning to Cap Ferrat he completed his last full-length work of fiction, the historical novel &quot;Catalina&quot;. He took part in the adaptation for the cinema of some of his short stories, &quot;Quartet&quot; (1948), &quot;Trio&quot; (1950) and &quot;Encore&quot; (1951), in all of which he appeared, contributing on-screen introductions. He did the same on American television, introducing the &quot;Somerset Maugham Theater&quot; series, which a reviewer said enjoyed &quot;tremendous popularity ... and has won for him an audience of millions of enthusiastic fans&quot;.

Maugham made many subsequent visits to London, including one for his daughter&#x27;s second marriage in July 1948, where, in Hastings&#x27;s words, &quot;with professional ease he acted the part of proud father, managed to be civil to Syrie, and made a creditable speech at the reception at Claridge&#x27;s afterwards&quot;. During a visit in 1954 he was invested as a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) by the Queen at a private audience in Buckingham Palace. He was widely understood in literary circles to have turned down a knighthood and to have hankered after the more prestigious and exclusive British honour, the Order of Merit, saying to friends that the CH &quot;means &#x27;Well done, but ...&#x27;&quot;. There is some suggestion that his known homosexuality may have militated against his receiving the higher honour.
In the post-war era, Maugham settled into a pattern of life that changed little from year to year:

In 1959 the foreign travel included a final trip to the far East. He kept himself fit, and further attempted to fend off the encroachments of age with supposedly rejuvenating injections at the clinic of Paul Niehans. Nonetheless, his final years, according to Connon, were marred by increasing senility, misguided legal disputes and a memoir, published in 1962, &quot;Looking Back&quot;, in which &quot;he denigrated his late former wife, was dismissive of Haxton, and made a clumsy attempt to deny his homosexuality by claiming he was a red-blooded heterosexual&quot;. He attempted to disinherit his daughter and to make Searle his adopted son, but the courts prevented it.

Maugham died in the Anglo-American Hospital in Nice on the night of 15–16 December 1965 at the age of 91, of complications following a fall. He was cremated in Marseille on 20 December. Two days later his ashes were interred in the grounds of The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, beside the wall of the Maugham Library, which he had endowed in 1961. Morgan observes:
==Works==
Although most of Maugham&#x27;s early successes were as a dramatist, it is for his novels and short stories that he has been best known since the 1930s. He was a prolific writer: between 1902 and 1933 he had 32 plays staged, and between 1897 and 1962 he published 19 novels, nine volumes of short stories, and non-fiction books covering travel, reminiscences, essays and extracts from his notebooks. His works sold prodigiously throughout the English-speaking world. His American publishers estimated that four and a half million copies of his books were bought in the US during his lifetime.
Maugham wrote that he followed no master, and acknowledged none, but he named Guy de Maupassant as an early influence. In the view of Kenneth Funsten in a 1981 study, British writers with whom Maugham has stylistic affinities include Jonathan Swift, William Hazlitt, John Dryden and John Henry Newman – &quot;all practitioners of precise prose&quot;. Maugham&#x27;s literary style was plain and functional; he disclaimed any pretence of being a prose stylist. He was not known as a phrase-maker; the 2014 edition of &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations&quot; cites him ten times, compared with nearly a hundred quotations from his contemporary Bernard Shaw. H.E.Bates, praising many of Maugham&#x27;s attributes as a writer, objected to his frequent reliance on clichéd phrases, and George Lyttelton commented that Maugham &quot;purchases a beautiful lucidity at the cost of numberless clichés&quot;, but rated the lucidity second only to that of Shaw. Morgan comments:

In his 1926 short story &quot;The Creative Impulse&quot; Maugham made fun of self-conscious stylists whose books appealed only to a literary clique: &quot;It was indeed a scandal that so distinguished an author, with an imagination so delicate and a style so exquisite, should remain neglected of the vulgar&quot;. After his early writing, in which long sentences are punctuated with semicolons and commas, Maugham came to favour short, direct sentences. In &quot;The Spectator&quot; the critic J. D. Scott wrote of &quot;The Maugham Effect&quot;: &quot;This quality is one of force, of swiftness, of the dramatic leap&quot;. Scott thought the style more effective in narrative than in suggestion and nuance.

===Plays===
The biggest theatrical success of Maugham&#x27;s career was an adaptation by others of his short story &quot;Rain&quot;, which opened on Broadway in 1921 and ran for 648 performances. The majority of his original plays were comedies, but of his serious dramas &quot;East of Suez&quot; (1922), &quot;The Letter&quot; (1927) and &quot;The Sacred Flame&quot; (1929) ran for more than 200 performances. Among his longest-running comedies were &quot;Lady Frederick&quot; (1907), &quot;Jack Straw&quot; (1908), &quot;Our Betters&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Constant Wife&quot; (1926), which ran in the West End or on Broadway for 422, 321, 548 and 295 performances respectively. Raphael remarks about Maugham as a playwright, &quot;His wit was sharp but rarely distressing; his plots abounded in amusing situations, his characters were usually drawn from the same class as his audiences and managed at once to satirize and delight their originals&quot;.

As in his novels and short stories, Maugham&#x27;s plots are clear and his dialogue naturalistic. The critic J. C. Trewin writes, &quot;His dialogue, unlike that of many of his contemporaries, is designed to be spoken ... Maugham does not write elaborately visual prose: that is, it does not make a fussy pattern on the page&quot;. Trewin quoted with approval Maugham&#x27;s observation, &quot;Words have weight, sound, and appearance; it is only by considering these that you can write a sentence that is good to look at and good to listen to&quot;.

Unlike his elder contemporary Shaw, Maugham did not view drama as didactic or moralistic; like his younger contemporary Coward, he wrote plays to entertain, and any moral or social conclusions were at most incidental. Several commentators have characterised him as a pessimist, who did not share Shaw&#x27;s optimistic belief that art could improve humanity. Christopher Innes has observed that, like Chekhov, Maugham qualified as a doctor, and their medical training gave them &quot;a materialistic determinism that discounted any possibility of changing the human condition&quot;. When Maugham&#x27;s &quot;The Circle&quot; was revived in the US in 2011, the reviewer in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the play had been criticised &quot;for not having anything substantial to say about love, marriage or infidelity. Actually it has extremely complicated things to say about them, but its most important message may be that actions have real consequences, no matter how casually those actions may be taken&quot;. Trewin singles out &quot;The Circle&quot;, calling it one of the great comedies of the 20th century, and comparing it with Congreve&#x27;s &quot;The Way of the World&quot;, to the disadvantage of the latter: &quot;He can put Congreve to shame in the task of telling a theatrical story – telling it clearly and without inessentials&quot;.

A few of Maugham&#x27;s plays have been revived occasionally. The Internet Broadway Database in 2022 records three productions since the author&#x27;s death: &quot;The Constant Wife&quot; directed by Gielgud and starring Ingrid Bergman in 1975; &quot;The Circle&quot;, starring Rex Harrison, Stewart Granger and Glynis Johns in 1989–90; and another production of &quot;The Constant Wife&quot;, with Kate Burton in the title role. In London, the National Theatre has presented two Maugham plays since its inception in 1963: &quot;Home and Beauty&quot; in 1968 and &quot;For Services Rendered&quot; in 1979. Other London productions have included &quot;The Circle&quot; (1976), &quot;For Services Rendered&quot; (1993), &quot;The Constant Wife&quot; (2000) and &quot;Home and Beauty&quot; (2002).

===Novels===
Maugham published novels in every decade from the 1890s to the 1940s. There are nineteen in all, of which those most often mentioned by critics are &quot;Liza of Lambeth&quot;, &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;, &quot;The Painted Veil&quot;, &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot;, &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; and &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;.

&quot;Liza of Lambeth&quot; caused outrage in some quarters, not only because its heroine sleeps with a married man, but also for its graphic depiction of the deprivation and squalor of the London slums, of which most people from Maugham&#x27;s social class preferred to remain ignorant. Unlike many of Maugham&#x27;s later novels it has an unequivocally tragic ending.

&quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;, influenced by Goethe and Samuel Butler, is a serious, partly autobiographical work, depicting a young man&#x27;s struggles and emotional turmoil. The hero survives, and by the end of the book he is evidently set for a happy ending. &quot;The Painted Veil&quot; is a story of marital strife and adultery against the background of a cholera epidemic in Hong Kong. Again, despite the suffering of the main characters, there is a reasonably happy ending for the central figure, Kitty.

&quot;Cakes and Ale&quot; combines humorous satire on the London literary scene and wry observations about love. Like &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; it has a strong female character at its centre, but the two are polar opposites: the malign Mildred in the earlier novel contrasts with the lovable, and much loved, Rosie in &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot;. Rosie appears to be based on Sue Jones, to whom Maugham had proposed in 1913. He observed, &quot;I am willing enough to agree with common opinion that &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; is my best work. It is the kind of book that an author can only write once. After all, he has only one life. But the book I like best is &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot;. It was an amusing book to write.&quot;

&quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; is the story of a man rejecting a conventional lifestyle, family obligations and social responsibility to indulge his ambition to be a painter. The structure of the book is unusual in that the protagonist is already dead before the novel opens, and the narrator attempts to piece together his story, and particularly his final years in Tahitian exile. &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;, the author&#x27;s last major novel, is described by Sutherland as &quot;Maugham&#x27;s twentieth-century manifesto for human fulfilment&quot;, satirising Western materialism and drawing on Eastern spiritualism as a way to find meaning in existence.

===Short stories===
For many readers and critics, the best of Maugham is in his short stories. Raphael writes that Maugham became widely regarded as the supreme English exponent of the form – &quot;both the magazine squib and the more elaborate conte&quot;. Most were first published in weekly or monthly magazines and later collected in book form. The first volume, &quot;Orientations&quot;, came out in 1898 and his last, &quot;Creatures of Circumstance&quot;, in 1947, with seven others between the two. Maugham&#x27;s British and American publishers issued and reissued various, sometimes overlapping, permutations during his lifetime and subsequently.

The stories range from the short sketches of &quot;On a Chinese Screen&quot;, which he had written during his 1920 travels through China and Hong Kong, to many, mostly serious, short stories dealing with the lives of British and other colonial expatriates in the Pacific Islands and Asia. These often convey the emotional toll that isolation exacts from the characters. Among the best-known examples are &quot;Rain&quot; (1921), charting the moral disintegration of a missionary attempting to convert the sexual sinner Sadie Thompson; &quot;The Letter&quot; (1924), dealing with domestic murder and its implications; &quot;The Book Bag&quot; (1932), a story of the tragic result of an incestuous relationship; and &quot;Flotsam and Jetsam&quot; (1947), set in a rubber plantation in Borneo, where a dreadful shared secret binds a husband and wife to a mutually abhorrent relationship.

Among the short stories set in England, one of the best-known is &quot;The Alien Corn&quot; (1931), where a young man rediscovers his Jewish heritage and rejects his family&#x27;s efforts to distance themselves from Judaism. His aspiration to become a concert pianist ends in failure and suicide. Another English story is &quot;Lord Mountdrago&quot; (1939), depicting the psychological collapse of a pompous cabinet minister.

The polished, detached , the central figure of the eponymous collection of spy stories (1928), is a writer recruited, as Maugham was, into the British Secret Service. His stories – the first in the genre of spy fiction continued by Ian Fleming, John le Carré and many others – are based so closely on Maugham&#x27;s experiences that it was not until ten years after the war ended that the security services permitted their publication. In the 1928 volume Ashenden features in sixteen stories; two years later he reappeared, in his peacetime role of writer, as the narrator of &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot;.

Comic stories include &quot;Jane&quot; (1923), about a dowdy widow who reinvents herself as an outrageous and conspicuous society figure, to the consternation of her family; &quot;The Creative Impulse&quot; (1926), in which a domineering authoress is shocked when her mild-mannered husband leaves her and sets up home with their cook; and &quot;The Three Fat Women of Antibes&quot; (1933) in which three middle-aged friends play highly competitive bridge while attempting to slim, until reversals at the bridge table at the hands of an effortlessly slender fourth player provoke them into extravagantly breaking their diets.

===Adaptations===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; commented in 1964:

In a study published thirteen years after Maugham&#x27;s death, Robert L. Calder notes that the writer&#x27;s works had been made into forty films and hundreds of radio and television plays, and he suggests &quot;it would be fair to say that no other serious writer&#x27;s work has been so often presented in other media&quot;.

In Calder&#x27;s view Maugham&#x27;s &quot;ability to tell a fascinating story and his dramatic skill&quot; appealed strongly to the makers of films and radio programmes, but his liberal attitudes, disregard of conventional morality and unsentimental view of humanity led adapters to make his stories &quot;blander, safer, and more narrowly moralistic than he had ever conceived them&quot;. Some of his stories were judged too improper for the cinema; Calder cites an adaptation of the historical novel &quot;Then and Now&quot; which the Hays Office rejected for thirty-seven separate reasons. In the first screen version of &quot;Rain&quot; (1928) expurgations fundamentally altered the characters; an adaptation of &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; in the 1948 omnibus film &quot;Quartet&quot; omitted the key plot point that the scheming young woman on whom the young hero turns the tables is a prostitute with whom he has just spent a night; in &quot;The Ant and the Grasshopper&quot; a young adventurer marries not a rich old woman who dies soon afterwards but a rich young one who remains very much alive. Titles were altered to avoid association with stage plays held to be sensational: &quot;Rain&quot; became &quot;Sadie Thompson&quot; and &quot;The Constant Wife&quot; became &quot;Charming Sinners&quot;.

Radio and television adaptations have, in general, been more faithful to Maugham&#x27;s original stories. Calder cites BBC Television&#x27;s series of twenty-six stories shown in 1969 and 1970, adapted by dramatists including Roy Clarke, Simon Gray, Hugh Leonard, Simon Raven and Hugh Whitemore, &quot;presented with scrupulous fidelity to [their] tone, attitude, and thematic intention&quot;. On radio, the BBC&#x27;s connection with Maugham goes back to 1930, when Hermione Gingold and Richard Goolden starred in an adaptation of &quot;Before the Party&quot; from his 1922 volume &quot;The Casuarina Tree&quot;. Since then BBC radio has broadcast numerous adaptations of his plays, novels and short stories – ranging from one-off presentations to 12-part serialisations – including six productions of &quot;The Circle&quot; and two adaptations apiece of &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;, &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; and &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot;.

==Awards and honours==
Maugham was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1954, on the recommendation of the British prime minister, Winston Churchill, and six years later – along with Churchill – he was one of the first five writers to be made a Companion of Literature. He was a Commandeur of the Legion of Honour, and an honorary doctor of the universities of Oxford and Toulouse. On his eightieth birthday the Garrick Club gave a dinner in his honour: only Dickens, Thackeray and Trollope had been similarly honoured. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, a Fellow of the Library of Congress, Washington, an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and an honorary senator of Heidelberg University.

==Reputation==
The critic Philip Holden wrote in 2006 that Maugham occupies a paradoxical position in twentieth-century British literature. Although he was an important influence on many well-known writers, &quot;Maugham&#x27;s critical stock has remained low&quot;. Maugham outsold, and outlived, contemporaries such as James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and D. H. Lawrence, but, in Holden&#x27;s view, &quot;he could not match them in terms of stylistic innovation or thematic complexity&quot;. Nonetheless, Maugham is recognised as an influence on Coward, Lawrence, Kingsley Amis, Graham Greene, Christopher Isherwood, V. S. Naipaul and George Orwell. His urbane spy, Ashenden, influenced the stories of Raymond Chandler, Ian Fleming, Georges Simenon and John le Carré.

In &quot;The Summing Up&quot; (1938), Maugham wrote of his non-dramatic work, &quot;I have no illusions about my literary position. There are but two important critics in my own country who have troubled to take me seriously and when clever young men write essays about contemporary fiction they never think of considering me. I do not resent it. It is very natural&quot;. Some biographers have doubted Maugham&#x27;s claim to be unresentful at being overlooked or dismissed by literary critics, but there is little doubt that he was right about it. L. A. G. Strong acknowledged his craftsmanship, but described his writing as having an effect like &quot;that of music expertly played in an expensive restaurant at dinner&quot;. Virginia Woolf was friendly though a little patronising; Lytton Strachey disparaged one of his books as &quot;Class II, Division I&quot;. Lee Wilson Dodd wrote, &quot;Mr Maugham knows how to plan a story and carry it through. Competence is the word. His style is without a trace of imaginative beauty.&quot; In a 2016 survey Don Adams remarks, &quot;The gist of the criticism of Maugham&#x27;s fiction, that it lacks psychological and emotional profundity, is remarkably consistent throughout the decades.&quot;

The &quot;two important critics&quot; Maugham referred to were probably Desmond MacCarthy and Raymond Mortimer; the former particularly praised the short stories, tracing their roots in French naturalism, and the latter reviewed Maugham&#x27;s books carefully and on the whole favourably in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. A rising critic of a younger generation, Cyril Connolly, praised Maugham for his lucidity and called him &quot;the last of the great professional writers&quot;, but Connolly&#x27;s contemporary Edmund Wilson insisted that Maugham was second-rate and &quot;disappointing&quot;. Even an admirer such as Evelyn Waugh felt that Maugham&#x27;s disciplined writing with its &quot;brilliant technical dexterity&quot; was not without disadvantages:

Maugham himself, although he never used the terms &quot;second rate&quot; or &quot;mediocre&quot; about his work, was modest about his status. He said that lacking any great powers of imagination he wrote about what he saw, and that although he could see more than most people could, &quot;the greatest writers can see through a brick wall – my vision is not so penetrating&quot;.

Marking Maugham&#x27;s eightieth birthday &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that he had not only outlived his contemporaries including Shaw, Joseph Conrad, H. G. Wells, Henry James, Arnold Bennett and John Galsworthy but was now seen to rank with them in excellence, after years in which his popularity had caused critics to depreciate his work. The tribute continued, &quot;Best sellers that appeal to the mass reader are seldom good literature, but there are exceptions. &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; is certainly one; &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot; probably; &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; possibly. Some of the short stories will undoubtedly prove immortal&quot;. In 2014 Robert McCrum concluded an article about &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; – which he said &quot;shows the author&#x27;s savage honesty and gift for storytelling at their best&quot;:

<doc id="33189" wikidata="Q43296" url="?curid=33189" title="Wake Island">
<text>Wake Island (), also known as Wake Atoll, is a coral atoll in the Micronesia subregion of the Pacific Ocean. The atoll is composed of three islets – Wake, Wilkes, and Peale Islands – surrounding a lagoon encircled by a coral reef. The nearest inhabited island is Utirik Atoll in the Marshall Islands, located to the southeast.

The island may have been found by prehistoric Austronesian mariners before its first recorded discovery by Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira in 1568. Ships continued visiting the area in the following centuries, but the island remained undeveloped until the United States claimed it in 1899. Significant development of the island didn&#x27;t begin until 1935 when Pan American Airways constructed an airfield and hotel, establishing Wake Island as a stopover for trans-Pacific flying boat routes. In December 1941 at the opening of the Pacific Theatre of World War II Japan seized the island where it remained under Japanese occupation until the end of the war in September 1945. In 1972, Pan American Airways ceased using the island for trans-Pacific layovers, instead using Boeing 747 aircraft, which could cross the ocean without stopping. With the withdrawal of Pan American Airways, the island&#x27;s administration was taken over by the United States Air Force, which later used the atoll as a processing location for Vietnamese refugees during Operation New Life in 1975.

Wake Island is claimed by the Marshall Islands but is administered by the United States as an unorganized and unincorporated territory and is part of the United States Minor Outlying Islands. The island is administered by the Department of the Interior and managed by the United States Air Force. While there are no permanent residents, approximately 300 people are on the island at any given time, primarily military personnel and contractors.

The natural areas of Wake are a mix of tropical trees, scrub, and grasses that have adapted to the limited rainfall. Thousands of hermit crabs and rats live on Wake, and in the past, cats were introduced to help control the rat population, which at one time was estimated at 2 million. The Wake Island rail, a small flightless bird, once lived on the atoll but went extinct during World War II. Many seabird species also visit Wake, although the thick vegetation has caused most birds to nest in a designated bird sanctuary on Wilkes Island. The submerged and emergent lands at Wake Island are a unit of the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument.

==Etymology==

Wake Island derives its name from British sea captain Samuel Wake, who rediscovered the atoll in 1796 while in command of the &quot;Prince William Henry&quot;. The name is sometimes attributed to Captain William Wake, who also is reported to have discovered the atoll from the &quot;Prince William Henry&quot; in 1792.

Peale Island is named for the naturalist Titian Peale, who visited the island in 1841, and Wilkes Island is named for U.S. Naval officer Charles Wilkes, who led the U.S. expedition to Wake Atoll in 1841.

==History==

===Prehistory===
The presence of the Polynesian rat on the island suggests that Wake was likely visited by Polynesian or Micronesian voyagers at an early date. In the Marshallese oral tradition, stories tell of Ānen Kio, or &quot;island of the orange flower,&quot; where men would collect albatross bones for tattooing rituals. Dwight Heine speculated that the Marshall Islanders treated Ānen Kio similar to a game preserve for hunting and gathering food and that no one permanently lived there, similar to land usage practices on Bokak Atoll and Bikar Atoll. He also speculated that the islanders may have stopped traveling to Wake Atoll in the mid-1800s, around the time the first missionaries arrived in the Marshalls. However, the atoll&#x27;s remoteness and lack of fresh water may have prevented permanent pre-modern human habitation, and no ancient artifacts have been discovered.

===Early exploration and shipwrecks===
The first recorded discovery of Wake Island was on October 2, 1568, by Spanish explorer and navigator Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira. In 1567, Mendaña and his crew had set off on two ships, &quot;Los Reyes&quot; and &quot;Todos los Santos&quot;, from Callao, Peru, on an expedition to search for a gold-rich land in the South Pacific mentioned in Inca tradition. After visiting Tuvalu and the Solomon Islands, the expedition headed north and came upon Wake Island, &quot;a low barren island, judged to be eight leagues in circumference&quot;. Since the date, October 2, was the eve of the feast of Saint Francis of Assisi, the captain named it &quot;St Francis Island&quot; ( ) The ships were in need of water and the crew was suffering from scurvy, but after circling the island, it was determined that Wake was waterless and had &quot;not a cocoanut nor a pandanus&quot; and &quot;there was nothing on it but sea-birds, and sandy places covered with bushes.&quot; (It was while attempting to relocate Wake according to Mendaña&#x27;s description of its coordinates that James Cook first reached the Hawaiian Islands.)

In 1796, Captain Samuel Wake of the merchantman &quot;Prince William Henry&quot; also came upon Wake Island, naming the atoll Wake, for himself. Soon thereafter, the 80-ton fur trading merchant brig &quot;Halcyon&quot; arrived at Wake and Master Charles William Barkley, unaware of Captain Wake&#x27;s visit and other prior European contact, named the atoll &quot;Halcyon Island&quot; in honor of his ship. In 1823, Captain Edward Gardner, while in command of the Royal Navy&#x27;s whaling ship HMS &quot;Bellona&quot;, visited an island at , which he judged to be long. The island was &quot;covered with wood, having a very green and rural appearance&quot;. This report is considered to be another sighting of Wake Island.

On December 20, 1841, the United States Exploring Expedition, commanded by US Navy Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, arrived at Wake on and sent several boats to survey the island. Wilkes described the atoll as &quot;a low coral one, of triangular form and above the surface. It has a large lagoon in the center, which was well filled with fish of a variety of species; among these were some fine mullet.&quot; He also noted that Wake had no fresh water but was covered with shrubs, &quot;the most abundant of which was the tournefortia.&quot; The expedition&#x27;s naturalist, Titian Peale, noted that &quot;the only remarkable part in the formation of this island is the enormous blocks of coral that have been thrown up by the violence of the sea&quot;. Peale collected an egg from a short-tailed albatross and added other specimens, including a Polynesian rat, to the natural history collections of the expedition. Wilkes also reported that &quot;from appearances, the island must be at times submerged, or the sea makes a complete breach over it&quot;.

Wake Island first received international attention with the wreck of the barque . On the night of March 4, 1866, the 650-ton iron-hulled &quot;Libelle&quot;, of Bremen, struck the eastern reef of Wake Island during a gale. Commanded by Captain Anton Tobias, the ship was en route from San Francisco to Hong Kong with a cargo of mercury (quicksilver). After three days of searching and digging on the island for water, the crew recovered a water tank from the wrecked ship. Valuable cargo was also recovered and buried on the island, including some of the 1,000 flasks of mercury, coins, and precious stones. After three weeks with a dwindling water supply and no sign of rescue, the passengers and crew decided to leave Wake and attempt to sail to Guam (the center of the then Spanish colony of the Mariana Islands) on the two remaining boats from &quot;Libelle&quot;. Twenty-two passengers and some of the crew sailed in the longboat under the command of First Mate Rudolf Kausch, and the remainder of the crew sailed with Captain Tobias in the gig. On April 8, 1866, the longboat reached Guam after 13 days of frequent squalls, short rations, and tropical sun. The gig, commanded by the captain, was lost at sea.

The Spanish governor of the Mariana Islands, Francisco Moscoso y Lara, welcomed and aided the &quot;Libelle&quot; shipwreck survivors on Guam. He also ordered the schooner &quot;Ana&quot;, owned and commanded by his son-in-law George H. Johnston, to be dispatched with first mate Kausch to search for the missing gig and then sail on to Wake Island to confirm the shipwreck story and recover the buried treasure. &quot;Ana&quot; departed Guam on April 10 and, after two days at Wake Island, found and salvaged the buried coins, precious stones, and a small quantity of the quicksilver.

On July 29, 1870, the British tea clipper &quot;Dashing Wave&quot;, under the command of Captain Henry Vandervord, sailed out of Fuzhou en route to Sydney. On August 31, &quot;the weather was very thick, and it was blowing a heavy gale from the eastward, attended with violent squalls and a tremendous sea.&quot; At 10:30 pm, breakers were seen, and the ship struck the reef at Wake Island. The vessel began to break up overnight, and at 10:00 am, the crew launched the longboat over the leeward side. In the chaos of the evacuation, the captain secured a chart and nautical instruments but no compass. The crew loaded a case of wine, some bread, and two buckets, but no drinking water. Since Wake Island appeared to have neither food nor water, the captain and his 12-man crew quickly departed, crafting a makeshift sail by attaching a blanket to an oar. With no water, each man was allotted a glass of wine daily until a heavy rain shower came on the sixth day. After 31 days of drifting westward in the longboat, they reached Kosrae (Strong&#x27;s Island) in the Caroline Islands. Captain Vandervord attributed the loss of &quot;Dashing Wave&quot; to the erroneous way Wake Island &quot;is laid down in the charts. It is very low, and not easily seen even on a clear night.&quot;

===American annexation===
With the annexation of Hawaii in 1898 and the acquisition of Guam and the Philippines resulting from the conclusion of the Spanish–American War that same year, the United States began to consider unclaimed and uninhabited Wake Island, located approximately halfway between Honolulu and Manila, as a good location for a telegraph cable station and coaling station for refueling warships of the rapidly expanding United States Navy and passing merchant and passenger steamships. On July 4, 1898, United States Army Brigadier General Francis V. Greene of the 2nd Brigade, Philippine Expeditionary Force, of the Eighth Army Corps, stopped at Wake Island and raised the United States flag while en route to the Philippines on the steamship liner SS &quot;China&quot;.

On January 17, 1899, under orders from President William McKinley, Commander Edward D. Taussig of landed on Wake and formally took possession of the island for the United States. After a 21-gun salute, the flag was raised, and a brass plate was affixed to the flagstaff with the following inscription:
Although the proposed Wake Island route for the submarine cable would have been shorter by , the Midway Islands and not Wake Island was chosen as the location for the telegraph cable station between Honolulu and Guam. Rear Admiral Royal Bird Bradford, chief of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Equipment, stated before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on January 17, 1902, that &quot;Wake Island seems at times to be swept by the sea. It is only a few feet above the level of the ocean, and if a cable station were established there, costly work would be required; besides, it has no harbor, while the Midway Islands are perfectly habitable and have a fair harbor for vessels of draught.&quot;

On June 23, 1902, , commanded by Captain Alfred Croskey and bound for Manila, spotted a ship&#x27;s boat on the beach as it passed closely by Wake Island. Soon thereafter, the Japanese launched the boat on the island and sailed out to meet the transport. The Japanese told Captain Croskey that they had been put on the island by a schooner from Yokohama in Japan and that they were gathering guano and drying fish. The captain suspected they were also engaged in pearl hunting. The Japanese revealed that one of their parties needed medical attention, and the captain determined from their descriptions of the symptoms that the illness was most likely beriberi. They informed Captain Croskey that they did not need any provisions or water and expected the Japanese schooner to return in a month or so. The Japanese declined an offer to be taken on the transport to Manila and were given some medical supplies for the sick man, some tobacco, and a few incidentals.

After USAT &quot;Buford&quot; reached Manila, Captain Croskey reported the Japanese presence at Wake Island. He also learned that USAT Sheridan had a similar encounter at Wake with the Japanese. The incident was brought to the attention of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Charles Darling, who at once informed the State Department and suggested that an explanation from the Japanese Government was needed. In August 1902, Japanese Minister Takahira Kogorō provided a diplomatic note stating that the Japanese Government had &quot;no claim whatever to make on the sovereignty of the island, but that if any subjects are found on the island the Imperial Government expects that they should be properly protected as long as they are engaged in peaceful occupations.&quot;

Wake Island was now clearly a territory of the United States, but the island was only occasionally visited by passing American ships during this period. One notable visit occurred in December 1906, when U.S. Army General John J. Pershing, later famous as the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces in western Europe during World War I, stopped at Wake on and hoisted a 45-star U.S. flag that was improvised out of sail canvas.

====Japanese activity====
With limited freshwater resources, no harbor, and no plans for development, Wake Island remained a remote uninhabited Pacific island in the early 20th century. However, a large seabird population attracted Japanese feather collecting. The global demand for feathers and plumage was driven by the millinery industry and popular European fashion designs for hats, while other demand came from pillow and bedspread manufacturers. Japanese poachers set up camps to harvest feathers on many remote islands in the Central Pacific. The feather trade was primarily focused on Laysan albatross, black-footed albatross, masked booby, lesser frigatebird, great frigatebird, sooty tern and other species of tern. On February 6, 1904, Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans arrived at Wake Island on and observed Japanese collecting feathers and catching sharks for their fins. Abandoned feather poaching camps were seen by the crew of the submarine tender in 1922 and in 1923. Although feather collecting and plumage exploitation had been outlawed in the territorial United States, there is no record of any enforcement actions at Wake Island.

In January 1908, the Japanese ship &quot;Toyoshima Maru&quot;, en route from Tateyama, Japan, to the South Pacific, encountered a heavy storm that disabled the ship and swept the captain and five of the crew overboard. The 36 remaining crew members landed on Wake Island, enduring five months of great hardship, disease, and starvation. In May 1908, the Brazilian Navy training ship &quot;Benjamin Constant&quot;, while on a voyage around the world, passed by the island and spotted a tattered red distress flag. Unable to land a boat, the crew executed a challenging three-day rescue operation using rope and cable to bring on board the 20 survivors and transport them to Yokohama.

====U.S. expeditions====
In his 1921 book &quot;Sea-Power in the Pacific: A Study of the American-Japanese Naval Problem&quot;, Hector C. Bywater recommended establishing a well-defended fueling station at Wake Island to provide coal and oil for United States Navy ships engaged in future operations against Japan. On June 19, 1922, the submarine tender landed an investigating party to determine the practicality and feasibility of establishing a naval fueling station on Wake Island. Lt. Cmdr. Sherwood Picking reported that from &quot;a strategic point of view, Wake Island could not be better located, dividing as it does with Midway, the passage from Honolulu to Guam into almost exact thirds.&quot; He observed that the boat channel was choked with coral heads and that the lagoon was very shallow and not over in depth, and therefore Wake would not be able to serve as a base for surface vessels. Picking suggested clearing the channel to the lagoon for &quot;loaded motor sailing launches&quot; so that parties on shore could receive supplies from passing ships, and he strongly recommended that Wake be used as a base for aircraft. Picking stated, &quot;If the long heralded trans-Pacific flight ever takes place, Wake Island should certainly be occupied and used as an intermediate resting and fueling port.&quot;

In 1923, a joint expedition by the then Bureau of the Biological Survey (in the U.S. Department of Agriculture), the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum and the United States Navy was organized to conduct a thorough biological survey of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, then administered by the Biological Survey Bureau as the Hawaiian Islands Bird Reservation. On February 1, 1923, Secretary of Agriculture Henry C. Wallace contacted Secretary of Navy Edwin Denby to request Navy participation and recommended expanding the expedition to Johnston, Midway and Wake, all islands not administered by the Department of Agriculture. On July 27, 1923, , a World War I minesweeper, brought the Tanager Expedition to Wake Island under the leadership of ornithologist Alexander Wetmore, and a tent camp was established on the eastern end of Wilkes. From July 27 to August 5, the expedition charted the atoll, made extensive zoological and botanical observations, and gathered specimens for the Bishop Museum while the naval vessel under the command of Lt. Cmdr. Samuel Wilder King conducted a sounding survey offshore. Other achievements at Wake included examinations of three abandoned Japanese feather poaching camps, scientific observations of the now extinct Wake Island rail, and confirmation that Wake Island is an atoll, a group of three islands with a central lagoon. Wetmore named the southwest island for Charles Wilkes, who had led the original pioneering United States Exploring Expedition to Wake in 1841. The northwest island was named for Titian Peale, the chief naturalist of that 1841 expedition.

===Pan American Airways===
Juan Trippe, president of the world&#x27;s then-largest airline, Pan American Airways (PAA), wanted to expand globally by offering passenger air service between the United States and China. To cross the Pacific Ocean, his planes would need to island-hop, stopping at various points for refueling and maintenance. He first tried to plot the route on his globe, but it showed only open sea between Midway and Guam. Next, he went to the New York Public Library to study 19th-century clipper ship logs and charts and he &quot;discovered&quot; a little-known coral atoll, Wake Island. To proceed with his plans at Wake and Midway, Trippe would need to be granted access to each island and approval to construct and operate facilities; however, the islands were not under the jurisdiction of any specific U.S. government entity.

Meanwhile, U.S. Navy military planners and the State Department were increasingly alarmed by the Empire of Japan&#x27;s expansionist attitude and growing belligerence in the Western Pacific. Following World War I, the Council of the League of Nations had granted the South Seas Mandate (&quot;Nanyo&quot;) to Japan (which had joined the Allied Powers in the First World War) which included the already Japanese-held Micronesia islands north of the equator that were part of the former colony of German New Guinea of the German Empire; these include the modern nation/states of Palau, The Federated States of Micronesia, The Northern Mariana Islands and The Marshall Islands. In the 1920s and 1930s, Japan restricted access to its mandated territory and began to develop harbors and airfields throughout Micronesia in defiance of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, which prohibited both the United States and Japan from expanding military fortifications in the Pacific islands. With Trippe&#x27;s planned Pan American Airways aviation route passing through Wake and Midway, the U.S. Navy and the State Department saw an opportunity to project American air power across the Pacific under the guise of a commercial aviation enterprise. On October 3, 1934, Trippe wrote to the Secretary of the Navy, requesting a five-year lease on Wake Island with an option for four renewals. Given the potential military value of PAA&#x27;s base development, on November 13, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William H. Standley ordered a survey of Wake by and on December 29 President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6935, which placed Wake Island and also Johnston, Sand Island at Midway and Kingman Reef under the control of the Department of the Navy. Rear Admiral Harry E. Yarnell designated Wake Island as a bird sanctuary to disguise the Navy&#x27;s military intentions.

USS &quot;Nitro&quot; arrived at Wake Island on March 8, 1935, and conducted a two-day ground, marine, and aerial survey, providing the Navy with strategic observations and complete photographic coverage of the atoll. Four days later, on March 12, Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson formally granted Pan American Airways permission to construct facilities at Wake Island.

To construct bases in the Pacific, PAA chartered the 6,700-ton freighter SS &quot;North Haven&quot;, which arrived at Wake Island on May 9, 1935, with construction workers and the necessary materials and equipment to start to build Pan American facilities and to clear the lagoon for a flying boat landing area. The atoll&#x27;s encircling coral reef prevented the ship from entering and anchoring in the shallow lagoon. The only suitable location for ferrying supplies and workers ashore was at nearby Wilkes Island; however, the chief engineer of the expedition, Charles R. Russell, determined that Wilkes was too low and, at times, flooded and that Peale Island was the best site for the Pan American facilities. To offload the ship, cargo was lightered (barged) from ship to shore, carried across Wilkes, and then transferred to another barge and towed across the lagoon to Peale Island. Someone had earlier loaded railroad track rails onto &quot;North Haven&quot; by inspiration, so the men built a narrow-gauge railway to make it easier to haul the supplies across Wilkes to the lagoon. The line used a flatbed car pulled by a tractor. On June 12, &quot;North Haven&quot; departed for Guam, leaving behind various PAA technicians and a construction crew.

Out in the middle of the lagoon, Bill Mullahey, a swimmer and free diver from Columbia University, was tasked with placing dynamite charges to blast hundreds of coral heads from a long, wide, deep landing area for the flying boats. In total some of dynamite were used over three months on the coral heads in the Wake Atoll lagoon.

On August 17, the first aircraft landing at Wake Island occurred when a PAA flying boat landed in the lagoon on a survey flight of the route between Midway and Wake.

The second expedition of &quot;North Haven&quot; arrived at Wake Island on February 5, 1936, to complete the construction of the PAA facilities. A five-ton diesel locomotive for the Wilkes Island Railroad was offloaded, and the railway track was extended to run from dock to dock. Across the lagoon on Peale, workers assembled the Pan American Hotel, a prefabricated structure with 48 rooms and wide porches and verandas. The hotel consisted of two wings built out from a central lobby, with each room having a bathroom with a hot-water shower. The PAA facilities staff included a group of Chamorro men from Guam who were employed as kitchen helpers, hotel service attendants, and laborers. The village on Peale was nicknamed &quot;PAAville&quot; and was the first &quot;permanent&quot; human settlement on Wake.
By October 1936, Pan American Airways was ready to transport passengers across the Pacific on its small fleet of three Martin M-130 &quot;Flying Clippers&quot;. On October 11, the &quot;China Clipper&quot; landed at Wake on a press flight with ten journalists on board. A week later, on October 18, PAA President Juan Trippe and a group of VIP passengers arrived at Wake on the &quot;Philippine Clipper&quot; (NC14715).  On October 25, the &quot;Hawaii Clipper&quot; (NC14714) landed at Wake with the first paying airline passengers ever to cross the Pacific. In 1937, Wake Island became a regular stop for PAA&#x27;s international trans-Pacific passenger and airmail service, with two scheduled flights per week, one westbound from Midway and one eastbound from Guam. Pan Am also flew Boeing 314 Clipper flying boats, in addition, the Martin M130.

Wake Island is credited with being one of the early successes of hydroponics, which enabled Pan American Airways to grow vegetables for its passengers, as it was costly to airlift in fresh vegetables and the island lacked natural soil. Pan Am remained in operation up to the day of the first Japanese air raid in December 1941, forcing the U.S. into World War II.

The last flight out was Martin M-130, which had just taken off on the flight to Guam when it was called on the radio about Pearl Harbor and the outbreak of World War II, so it returned to Wake. It was fueled up and was going to do a maritime patrol to search for the Japanese, when the Japanese bombing raid attacked and the aircraft took some light damage during the raid, but two of the air crew were wounded. It was stripped of seats and spare weight and filled with 40 people to evacuate. After three take-off attempts, it got in the air. It flew to Midway, then Pearl Harbor, then back to the US. The flight with passengers and 26 Pan-Am employees left in such a hurry that 1 passenger, 1 employee, and 35 Guam staff were left behind. It departed about two hours after the air raid. Except for one other Marine that a PBY flew out on the December 21, these were the last to leave Wake island before the Japanese capture on the 23rd. The US plan was to resupply Wake with a naval force and evacuate civilians, but the island fell to the Japanese while it was still en route.

===Military buildup===
In January 1941, the United States Navy began constructing a military base on the atoll. On August 19, 1941 the first permanent military garrison, elements of the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27; First Marine Defense Battalion, totaling 449 officers and men, were stationed on the island, commanded by Navy Cmdr. Winfield Scott Cunningham. Also on the island were 68 U.S. Naval personnel and about 1,221 civilian workers from the American firm Morrison-Knudsen Corp. The base plan was not complete at the time the war started, and work continued even during the battle of Wake. One shortcoming was that the hangars and bunkers were incomplete, so repairing damaged aircraft during the battle was hard.

On February 14, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8682 to create naval defense areas in the central Pacific territories. The proclamation established the &quot;Wake Island Naval Defensive Sea Area&quot;, encompassing the territorial waters between the extreme high-water marks and the three-mile marine boundaries surrounding Wake. &quot;Wake Island Naval Airspace Reservation&quot; was also established to restrict access to the airspace over the naval defense sea area. Only U.S. government ships and aircraft were permitted to enter the naval defense areas at Wake Island unless authorized by the Secretary of the Navy.

In November 1941, VMF-211 embarked 12 of its 24 F4F-3 Wildcats and 13 of its 29 pilots aboard for movement to Wake Island launching from the carrier and arriving at Wake on December 3.

===World War II===

On December 8, 1941, the Japanese began an assault on Wake Island. At the time, there were about 500 Marines, 1100 civilian contractors, and dozens of Pan-Am airline employees and passengers. Shortly after a bombing raid that killed dozens, the Pan Am Flying Boat took off with the passengers and many employees. Three days later, the Japanese began a multi-ship amphibious invasion led by a cruiser, which was turned away at the loss of two destroyers by Wake&#x27;s artillery. This action was widely reported as the first American battlefield success of the war. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy began a plan to resupply the island and evacuate the contractors; however, before this could happen, a much larger amphibious invasion took place on the island on December 23, 1941, losing two more ships and additional casualties. The Japanese stationed about 4,000 troops on the island. All but 100 of the POWs were sent away; the ones that remained were executed in 1943 after a U.S. bombing raid. In June 1945, the Allies allowed a Japanese hospital ship to evacuate about 1000 soldiers from Wake. The island was bombed many times by the Allies throughout the war but never invaded; it was surrendered to the U.S. in September 1945.

====Battle of Wake Island====

The battle started with air attacks beginning on December 8, 1941. After three days, a naval assault was attempted but rebuffed on December 11, 1941. The island continued to be bombed, and the Japanese amassed a larger invasion fleet. There was a 50-plane air raid on December 21, 1941. The Japanese returned on December 23, 1941, with a much larger amphibious force and captured the island. The Japanese occupied it until September 1945.

On December 8, 1941 (December 7 in Hawaii, the day of the attack on Pearl Harbor), at least 27 Japanese Mitsubishi G3M &quot;Nell&quot; medium bombers flown from bases on Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands attacked Wake Island, destroying eight of the 12 Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter aircraft belonging to USMC Fighter Squadron 211 on the ground. The Marine garrison&#x27;s defensive emplacements were left intact by the raid, which primarily targeted the aircraft. On December 9 and 10, there were more air attacks, and two Japanese bombers were shot down. However,  the bombing of Wilkes Island detonated an ammunition dump, the Wake hospital was destroyed, and many other buildings were damaged. Meanwhile, the Japanese naval landing force was on its way from Roi in the Japanese-held Marshall Islands and would arrive at Wake on December 11, 1941. On the night of December 10, the US submarine USS &quot;Triton&quot; engaged an enemy destroyer near Wake while on patrol; it fired torpedoes, but in the battle neither vessel was sunk. This is noted as the first time a U.S. submarine launched its torpedoes in the Pacific war.

The Japanese are known to have lost one of the submarines they sent as part of the operation. Still, it was because two of their submarines accidentally collided with one another on December 17, sinking one. Japanese submarine &quot;Ro-66&quot; was on the surface southwest of Wake Island – bearing 252 degrees from the atoll – to recharge her batteries in a heavy squall in the predawn darkness of December 17, 1941, when her lookouts suddenly sighted &quot;Ro-62&quot;, also on the surface and recharging batteries. Both submarines attempted to back off, but it was too late to avoid a collision, and &quot;Ro-62&quot; rammed &quot;Ro-66&quot; at 20:20 Japan Standard Time. &quot;Ro-66&quot; sank at with the loss of 63 lives, including that of the commander of Submarine Division 27. &quot;Ro-62&quot; rescued her three survivors, who had been thrown overboard from her bridge by the collision.

The American garrison, supplemented by civilian construction workers employed by Morrison-Knudsen Corp., repelled several Japanese landing attempts. An American journalist reported that after the initial Japanese amphibious assault was beaten back with heavy losses on December 11, the American commander was asked by his superiors if he needed anything. Popular legend has it that Major James Devereux sent back the message, &quot;Send us more Japs!&quot; – a reply that became famous. After the war, when Major Devereux learned that he had been credited with sending such a message, he pointed out that he had not been the commander on Wake Island and denied sending it. &quot;As far as I know, it wasn&#x27;t sent at all. None of us was that much of a damn fool. We already had more Japs than we could handle.&quot;
In reality, Commander Winfield S. Cunningham, USN, was in charge of Wake Island, not Devereux. Cunningham ordered that coded messages be sent during operations. A junior officer had added &quot;send us&quot; and &quot;more Japs&quot; to the beginning and end of a message to confuse Japanese code breakers. This was put together at Pearl Harbor and passed on as part of the message.

On December 12, in the early morning, a four-engined flying boat bombed Wake, but a Wildcat fighter aircraft was able to intercept and shoot it down. Later in the day, they were bombed again by 26 Nell aircraft (G3M twin-engine bombers), one of which was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. An F4F Wildcat on patrol late in the day sank a Japanese submarine that was near Wake. The next air raid was on December 14, which included a bombing raid by several 4-engined flying boats, and later in the day, 30 Nells (G3M) struck the atoll, destroying a Wildcat that was under repair. The island was bombed again on December 15, killing one civilian worker. Wake was bombed again on December 16 by 33 Nells (G3M), and again on the 19th, though in that attack one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire and several more damaged. Before and at the start of hostilities, the waters around Wake were patrolled by two USN submarines, the USS Triton and the USS Tambor. Before the start of the war one of the USS Triton crew members became sick and was dropped off at Wake Island on December 1, 1941. He became a prisoner of war and survived WWII. The Triton was radioed about the start of the war when it surfaced to recharge its batteries and was warned to stay away from the atoll, lest Wake&#x27;s gunners target it. On December 10, the USS Triton had one engagement with a Japanese destroyer and fired the first US torpedoes of the Pacific War, though it did not sink. It escaped unscathed and went on to serve in the Pacific theater (it was later sunk in 1943). The submarine USS Tambor had to return to its home port in Hawaii in mid-December due to mechanical difficulties and had no engagements.

A PBY Catalina flying boat arrived with mail delivery on December 20, 1941. When it left, one marine was sent away on orders because he was required on Midway, thus Lt. Colonel Bayler became the last person to leave Wake Island before its loss. On December 21, 49 aircraft attacked Wake, striking from a Japanese carrier group.  During this time, there was a US Naval force on the way that was going to resupply Wake on December 24, but it did not work as planned as the Japanese 2nd wave took the island on December 23 before this could take place.  American and Japanese dead from the fighting between December 8 and 23 were buried on the island.

The U.S. Navy attempted to provide support from Hawaii but suffered great losses at Pearl Harbor. The relief fleet they managed to organize was delayed by bad weather. The isolated U.S. garrison was overwhelmed by a reinforced and greatly superior Japanese invasion force on December 23. American casualties numbered 52 military personnel (Navy and Marine) and approximately 70 civilians killed. Japanese losses exceeded 700 dead, with some estimates ranging as high as 1,000. Wake&#x27;s defenders sank two Japanese fast transports (&quot;P32&quot; and &quot;P33&quot;) and one submarine and shot down 24 Japanese aircraft. The US relief fleet, en route, on hearing of the island&#x27;s loss, turned back.

In the aftermath of the battle, most of the captured civilians and military personnel were sent to POW camps in Asia. However, the Japanese enslaved some of the civilian laborers and tasked them with improving the island&#x27;s defenses.

At the end of the battle on December 23, 1,603 people, of whom 1,150 were civilians, were taken prisoner. Three weeks later, all but roughly 350–360 were taken to Japanese prisoner-of-war camps in Asia aboard the &quot;Nita Maru&quot; (later renamed &quot;Chūyō)&quot;. Many of those who stayed were those who were too badly wounded, and some were civilian contractors who knew how to operate the machinery on the island. A significant source of the prisoner war experience on Wake were the accounts in the commanding officer logs for Wilcox and Russel. In September 1942, another 265 were taken off Wake including Wilcox and Russel; not including those that had died or been executed, that left 98 on the island. With the departure of the officers, their logs of daily prisoners of life on Wake ended. Still, additional facts are known, including a new commanding officer of the island in December 1942. In July 1943, a prisoner of war was executed for stealing food, as ordered by Sakaibara; however, the identity of this POW is unknown. On October 7, 1943, the prisoners of war were executed on order of Sakaibara; they were marched into an anti-tank ditch and executed by machine gun fire. At the end of the war, the Japanese garrison surrendered and said the POWs had been killed in a bombing attack; however, that story broke down when some of the officers wrote notes explaining the true story, and Sakaibara confessed to the mass execution.

====Japanese occupation, air raids, POWs====
The island&#x27;s Japanese garrison was composed of the IJN 65th Guard Unit (2,000 men), Japan Navy Captain Shigematsu Sakaibara and the IJA units, which became the 13th Independent Mixed Regiment (1,939 men) under the command of Col. Shigeji Chikamori. Fearing an imminent invasion, the Japanese reinforced Wake Island with more formidable defenses. The American captives were ordered to build a series of bunkers and fortifications on Wake. The Japanese brought in an naval gun which is often incorrectly reported as having been captured in Singapore. The U.S. Navy established a submarine blockade instead of an amphibious invasion of Wake Island. The Japanese-occupied island (called Ōtorishima (大鳥島) or &quot;Big Bird Island&quot; by them for its birdlike shape) was bombed several times by American aircraft; one of these raids was the first mission for future United States President George H. W. Bush.

The island was also bombed with leaflets and even small rubber rafts, with the idea that someone could escape from the island by sea.

In February 1942, there was a raid attack on Wake, which included naval bombardment and bombing by aircraft. On the first day of the attack on February 23, several targets on the island were struck, and in the waters nearby, two Japanese patrol boats were sunk, and four Japanese seamen recovered. The next day (February 24) a Japanese 4-engine patrol aircraft was shot down 5 miles east of Wake, and another patrol boat was sunk by air attack in addition to also striking targets on Wake island. The raids would continue to reduce the danger of Wake being used as a launching point for a strike on Midway.

From June 1942 to July 1943, many US B-24 raids and photographic recon missions were launched from Midway to Wake, often resulting in air battles between Zeros and bombers. For example, on May 15, 1943, a raid of 7 B-24s made it to Wake to be intercepted by 22 Zeros, with allies losing one B-24 and claiming four kills. In July 1943, a B-24 strike targeting the fuel depots lost another B-24 when intercepted by 20–30 Zeros. The last raid from Midway in 1943 was in July. The next significant attack combined naval bombardment and carrier strike aircraft in the fateful October 1943 raids. In 1944, Wake Island was bombed by PB2Y Coronado flying boats operating from Midway to stop the Japanese garrison from supporting the battle for the Marshall Islands. Once the Kwajalein was taken, Wake was attacked from the newly won base with B-24 raids. This continued until October 1944, thereafter Wake was only bombed a few more times by carrier strike groups usually heading west.

On May 10, 1942, one prisoner was executed for breaking into a store and getting drunk. In September 1942, another 265 POWs were taken off the island, leaving 98.

In March 1943, the Japanese transport ship Suwa Maru was traveling to Wake with over 1000 troops on board. The U.S. submarine USS Tunny torpedoed it, and the ship was taking on water as it approached Wake, so it was beached on the coral reef to avoid sinking.

After a successful American air raid on October 5, 1943, Sakaibara ordered the execution of the remaining 97 (one had been executed in July) POWs. They were taken to the northern end of the island, blindfolded and machine-gunned. One prisoner escaped, carving the message &quot;98 US PW 5-10-43&quot; on a large coral rock near where the victims had been hastily buried in a mass grave. This unknown American was soon recaptured and beheaded. The one that escaped created an issue for the Japanese, who had already buried the bodies at the end of the runway under coral sand. They then had to dig up and count all the bodies, confirming that one was missing. This would not be the final resting place, as near the end of the war in August 1945, the bodies were again dug up and reburied at Peacock Point in a mass grave but with multiple wooden crosses. After the war, they were exhumed again and buried at the U.S. National Cemetery of the Pacific.

Later in the war, the Japanese garrison had been almost cut off from supplies and was reduced to the point of starvation. While the islands&#x27; sooty tern colony had received some protection as a source of eggs, the Wake Island rail was hunted to extinction by the starving soldiers. Ultimately, about three-quarters of the Japanese garrison perished, and the rest survived only by eating tern eggs, the Polynesian rats, and what scant amount of vegetables they could grow in makeshift gardens among the coral rubble. In early 1944, Wake was largely cut off from resupply because the Allies Pacific campaign had moved past Wake, in particular, the Japanese base to the south that had been resupplying Wake was captured in January 1944. In May 1944, the Japanese forces on Wake began rationing food, and the rationing became progressively stricter. To survive the garrison engaged in fishing, growing vegetables, bird eggs, and rats, which were essential food supplies at this time, and sometimes tens of thousands of rats were killed in a single day to stave off starvation.

In June 1945, the Japanese hospital ship &quot;Takasago Maru&quot; was allowed to visit Wake Island, and it departed with 974 patients. It was boarded and checked both before and after the visit to confirm it was not carrying contraband, and the number of patients was confirmed: 974 Japanese were taken off Wake. On the way to Wake, it was stopped by the USS &quot;Murray&quot; (DD-576) and on the way back from Wake it was stopped by the USS &quot;McDermut II&quot; (DD-677) to confirm it was carrying the patients. The condition was recorded first hand by the USS &quot;McDermut II&quot;, which reported that about 15% of the troops that the Japanese evacuated were extremely sick.

The Pacific War finally came to a close in August 1945, with negotiations opening. The Emperor of Japan announced the surrender to the Japanese people, and the agreement was formally signed on September 2, 1945.

Most of the Wake POWs were liberated from Hirahata Camp 12-B, which switched over from Japanese to American control in late August 1945. About 300 prisoners were included from Wake Island, and a makeshift flag was raised at the camp as they gathered to mark the end of their internment.

==== Surrender and trial ====
On September 4, 1945, the Japanese garrison surrendered to a detachment of United States Marines under the command of Brigadier General Lawson H. M. Sanderson. The garrison, having previously received news that Imperial Japan&#x27;s defeat was imminent, exhumed the mass grave. The bones were moved to the U.S. cemetery established on Peacock Point after the invasion. Wooden crosses were erected in preparation for the expected arrival of U.S. forces. During the initial interrogations, the Japanese claimed that an American bombing raid mostly killed the remaining 98 Americans on the island. However, some escaped and fought to the death after being cornered on the beach at the north end of Wake Island. Several Japanese officers in American custody committed suicide over the incident, leaving written statements that incriminated Sakaibara. Sakaibara and his subordinate, lieutenant commander Tachibana, were later sentenced to death after conviction for this and other war crimes. Sakaibara was executed by hanging in Guam on June 18, 1947, while Tachibana&#x27;s sentence was commuted to life in prison. The remains of the murdered civilians were exhumed and reburied at Honolulu&#x27;s National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific at section G, commonly known as Punchbowl Crater. A year after the Wake executions, in 1944, there was the Palawan massacre in which Captain Nagayoshi Kojima ordered the execution of 150 POW when he was told the Allies were near. They were burned alive in trenches, and those who tried to flee were gunned down, but 11 escaped, leading to a death toll of 139. In response, the Allies then realized the Japanese might execute POWs if they thought the Allies were near and began a special mission to liberate POW camps. At the time, the events on Wake in 1943 were unknown, and the U.S. allowed the hospital ship &quot;Takasago Maru&quot; to visit Wake in June 1945.  After the surrender, the POW gravesite was found where they had been buried with crosses at Peacock Point, and the story was that either they had died in a U.S. bombing raid or that they had died in a revolt. At the handover of Wake, 2200 Japanese were on the island, significantly less than at the start, but 974 had just been shipped back to Japan in June 1945. Wake was not cut off until later in the war, but it is estimated that hundreds died during the bombing strikes and from starvation, and many were sick with tuberculosis.

In any case, the Japanese soldiers who had survived were nearly all sent away by November 1, 1945, transported aboard the &quot;Hikawa Maru&quot; for repatriation. The remaining Japanese troops and the officers were shipped to the U.S. base atoll, but on the route, two of the officers committed suicide, leaving notes describing a POW massacre. Another officer wrote a note describing the same. Finally, the Admiral admitted what he had ordered and accepted blame, leading to two officers&#x27; trial in late December. Back on Wake, the bodies were eventually exhumed, including those that had died in the Battle of Wake, to try to make identifications. The task proved too difficult, and they were buried as a group with a memorial listing the names. There was a ceremony in 1953.
===Post-World War II military and commercial airfield===
With the end of hostilities with Japan and the increase in international air travel driven partly by wartime advances in aeronautics, Wake Island became a critical mid-Pacific base for the servicing and refueling of military and commercial aircraft. The United States Navy resumed control of the island, and in October 1945, 400 Seabees from the 85th Naval Construction Battalion arrived at Wake to clear the island of the effects of the war and to build basic facilities for a Naval Air Base. The base was completed in March 1946, and on September 24, Pan Am resumed regular commercial passenger service. The era of the flying boats was nearly over, so Pan Am switched to longer-range, faster, and more profitable airplanes that could land on Wake&#x27;s new coral runway. Other airlines that established transpacific routes through Wake included British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), Japan Airlines, Philippine Airlines and Transocean Airlines. Due to the substantial increase in the number of commercial flights, on July 1, 1947, the Navy transferred administration, operations, and maintenance of the facilities at Wake to the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA). In 1949, the CAA upgraded the runway by paving over the coral surface and extending its length to 7,000 feet. Previously Pan Am was still operating airport at Wake.

In July 1950, the Korean Airlift started, and the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) used the airfield and facilities at Wake as an essential mid-Pacific refueling stop for its mission of transporting men and supplies to the Korean War. By September, 120 military aircraft were landing at Wake per day. On October 15, U.S. President Harry S. Truman and General MacArthur met at the Wake Island Conference to discuss progress and war strategy for the Korean Peninsula. They chose to meet at Wake Island because of its proximity to Korea so that MacArthur would not have to be away from the troops in the field for long.

In September 1952, Typhoon Olive struck, causing 750 people to shelter in World War II bunkers as the island was battered with 150 mph winds. Olive, the second typhoon to affect the island since 1935, produced sustained wind speeds of and peak gusts of on the island. Significant flooding was also recorded. Damage was severe; it is estimated that 85% of the island&#x27;s structures were demolished due to the storm. All of the homes and the island&#x27;s hotel were destroyed. Additionally, the island&#x27;s chapel and Quonset huts were destroyed. The island&#x27;s LORAN station, operated by the United States Coast Guard, was also damaged. On September 18, 1952 water and power services were restored. The facilities on the island were fully restored in 1953. The total cost to repair damages caused by Olive amounted to $1.6 million (1952 USD; $13 million 2009 USD). No fatalities occurred on the island, and four injuries were reported. None of the 230 Pan Am employees received injuries. In 1953, the bridge between Peale and Wake Island was rebuilt.

The U.S. Coast Guard Loran station had a staff of about ten people. It operated from 1950 to 1978, with facilities rebuilt on Peale Island by 1958. Originally, the staff lived on Wake and commuted to the Loran station on Peale across the bridge; the Loran equipment was in a Quonset hut. However, after 1958, new modern facilities were all built on Peale. The cargo ship USCGC Kukui supported the construction of the new LORAN facilities, arriving at the island in 1957.

====Missile Impact Location System====
From 1958 through 1960, the United States installed the Missile Impact Location System (MILS) in the Navy-managed Pacific Missile Range. Later, the Air Force managed Western Range to localize the splashdowns of test missile nose cones. MILS was developed and installed by the same entities that had completed the first phase of the Atlantic and U.S. West Coast SOSUS systems. A MILS installation, consisting of both a target array for precision location and a broad ocean area system for good positions outside the target area, was installed at Wake as part of the system supporting Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) tests. Other Pacific MILS shore terminals were at the Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay supporting Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) tests with impact areas northeast of Hawaii and the other ICBM test support systems at Midway Island and Eniwetok.

====Tanker shipwreck and oil spill====

On September 6, 1967, Standard Oil of California&#x27;s 18,000-ton tanker SS &quot;R.C. Stoner&quot; was driven onto the reef at Wake Island by a strong southwesterly wind after the ship failed to moor to the two buoys near the harbor entrance. An estimated six million gallons of refined fuel oil – including 5.7 million gallons of aviation fuel, 168,000 gallons of diesel oil, and 138,600 gallons of bunker C fuel – spilled into the small boat harbor and along the southwestern coast of Wake Island to Peacock Point. The oil spill killed large numbers of fish, and personnel from the FAA and crew members from the ship cleared the area closest to the spill of dead fish.

The U.S. Navy salvage team Harbor Clearance Unit Two and Pacific Fleet Salvage Officer Cmdr. John B. Orem flew to Wake to assess the situation. By September 13, the Navy tugs and , salvage ships and , tanker , and , arrived from Honolulu, Guam and Subic Bay in the Philippines, to assist in the cleanup and removal of the vessel. The salvage team pumped and skimmed oil at the boat harbor, which they burned each evening in nearby pits. Recovery by the Navy salvage team of the &quot;R.C. Stoner&quot; and its remaining cargo, however, was hampered by strong winds and heavy seas.

On September 16, Super Typhoon Sarah made landfall on Wake Island at peak intensity with winds up to 145-knots, causing widespread damage. The storm&#x27;s intensity significantly accelerated the cleanup effort by clearing the harbor and scouring the coast. However, oil remained embedded in the reef&#x27;s flat crevices, impregnating the coral. The storm also had broken the wrecked vessel into three sections and, although delayed by rough seas and harassment by blacktip reef sharks, the salvage team used explosives to flatten and sink the remaining portions of the ship that were still above water.

===U.S. military administration===
In the early 1970s, higher-efficiency jet aircraft with longer-range capabilities lessened the use of Wake Island Airfield as a refueling stop, and the number of commercial flights landing at Wake declined sharply. Pan Am had replaced many of its Boeing 707s with more efficient 747s, thus eliminating the need to continue weekly stops at Wake. Other airlines began to eliminate their scheduled flights into Wake. In June 1972, the last scheduled Pan Am passenger flight landed at Wake, and in July, Pan Am&#x27;s last cargo flight departed the island, marking the end of the heyday of Wake Island&#x27;s commercial aviation history. During this same period, the U.S. military had transitioned to longer-range C-5A and C-141 aircraft, leaving the C-130 as the only aircraft that would continue to use the island&#x27;s airfield regularly. The steady decrease in air traffic control activities at Wake Island was apparent and was expected to continue.

The last Pan Am passenger flight was in 1972, and the airport was transferred from the FAA to the Department of Defense, however it remained open for emergency landings.

On June 24, 1972, responsibility for the civil administration of Wake Island was transferred from the FAA to the United States Air Force under an agreement between the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Air Force. In July, the FAA turned over the administration of the island to the Military Airlift Command (MAC). However, legal ownership stayed with the Department of the Interior. The FAA continued maintaining air navigation facilities and providing air traffic control services. On December 27, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) General John D. Ryan directed MAC to phase out en-route support activity at Wake Island effective June 30, 1973. On July 1, 1973, all FAA activities ended, and the U.S. Air Force under Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), Detachment 4, 15th Air Base Wing assumed control of Wake Island.

In 1973, Wake Island was selected as a launch site for testing defensive systems against ICBMs under the U.S. Army&#x27;s &quot;Project Have Mill&quot;. Air Force personnel on Wake and the Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) Space and Missile Systems Organization (SAMSO) provided support to the Army&#x27;s Advanced Ballistic Missile Defense Agency (ABMDA). A missile launch complex was activated on Wake, and, from February 13 to June 22, 1974, seven Athena H missiles were launched from the island to the Roi-Namur Test Range at Kwajalein Atoll.

In 1973, Wake Island was claimed by what would become the Republic of the Marshall Islands, based on oral legends.

====Vietnam War refugees: &quot;Operation New Life&quot;====
In the spring of 1975, the population of Wake Island consisted of 251 military, government, and civilian contract personnel, whose primary mission was to maintain the airfield as a Mid-Pacific emergency runway. With the imminent fall of Saigon to North Vietnamese forces, President Gerald Ford ordered American forces to support &quot;Operation New Life&quot;, the evacuation of refugees from South Vietnam. The original plans included the Philippines&#x27; Subic Bay and Guam as refugee processing centers. Still, due to the high number of Vietnamese seeking evacuation, Wake Island was selected as an additional location.

In March 1975, Island Commander Major Bruce R. Hoon was contacted by PACAF and ordered to prepare Wake for its new mission as a refugee processing center where Vietnamese evacuees could be medically screened, interviewed, and transported to the United States or other resettlement countries. A 60-man civil engineering team was brought in to reopen boarded-up buildings and housing. Two complete MASH units arrived to set up field hospitals, and three Army field kitchens were deployed. A 60-man United States Air Force Security Police team, processing agents from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, and various other administrative and support personnel were also on Wake. Potable water, food, medical supplies, clothing, and other supplies were shipped in.

On April 26, 1975, the first C-141 carrying refugees arrived. The airlift to Wake continued at a rate of one C-141 every hour and 45 minutes, each aircraft with 283 refugees on board. At the peak of the mission, 8,700 Vietnamese refugees were on Wake. When the airlift ended on August 2, a total of about 15,000 refugees had been processed through Wake Island as part of &quot;Operation New Life&quot;.

====Commemorative and memorial visits====
In April 1981, a party of 19 Japanese, including 16 former Japanese soldiers who were at Wake during World War II, visited the island to pay respects for their war dead at the Japanese Shinto Shrine.

On November 3 and 4, 1985, a group of 167 former American prisoners of war (POWs) visited Wake with their wives and children. This was the first such visit by a group of former Wake Island POWs and their families.

On November 24, 1985, a Pan Am Boeing 747, renamed &quot;China Clipper II&quot;, came through Wake Island on a flight across the Pacific to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the inauguration of Pan American China Clipper Service to the Orient. Author James A. Michener and Lars Lindbergh, grandson of aviator Charles Lindbergh, were among the dignitaries on board the aircraft.

====Army missile tests====
Subsequently, the island has been used for strategic defense and operations during and after the Cold War, with Wake Island serving as a launch platform for military rockets involved in testing missile defense systems and atmospheric re-entry trials as part of the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site.  Wake&#x27;s location allows for a safe launch and trajectory over the unpopulated ocean with open space for intercepts.

In 1987, Wake Island was selected as a missile launch site for a Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program named &quot;Project Starlab/Starbird&quot;. In 1989, the U.S. Army Strategic Defense Command (USASDC) constructed two launch pads on Peacock Point, as well as nearby support facilities, for the eight-ton, , multi-stage Starbird test missiles. The program involved using electro-optical and laser systems mounted on the Starlab platform in the payload bay of an orbiting Space Shuttle to acquire, track, and target Starbird missiles launched from Cape Canaveral and Wake. After being impacted by mission scheduling delays caused by the explosion of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;, the program was canceled in late September 1990 to protect funding for another U.S. Army space-based missile defense program known as &quot;Brilliant Pebbles&quot;. Although no Starbird missiles were ever launched from Wake Island, the Starbird launch facilities at Wake were modified to support rocket launches for the &quot;Brilliant Pebbles&quot; program, with the first launch occurring on January 29, 1992. On October 16, a Castor-Orbus rocket was destroyed by ground controllers seven minutes after its launch from Wake. The program was canceled in 1993.

Missile testing activities continued with the Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile (LEAP) Test Program, another U.S. Army strategic defense project that included the launch of two Aerojet Super Chief HPB rockets from Wake Island. The first launch, on January 28, 1993, reached apogee at and was a success. On February 11, the second launch reached apogee at and was deemed a failure.

Due to the U.S. Army&#x27;s continued use of the atoll for various missile testing programs, on October 1, 1994, the U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command (USASSDC) assumed administrative command of Wake Island under a caretaker permit from the U.S. Air Force. The USASSDC had been operating on Wake since 1988 when the construction of the Starbird launch and support facilities started. Now under U.S. Army control, the island, which is located north of Kwajalein Atoll, became a rocket launch site for the Kwajalein Missile Range known as the Wake Island Launch Center.

====Operation Prompt Return====
In July 1995, various units of the U.S. military established a camp on Wake Island to provide housing, food, medical care, and social activities for Chinese illegal immigrants as part of &quot;Operation Prompt Return&quot; (also known as &quot;Joint Task Force Prompt Return&quot;). The Chinese immigrants were discovered on July 3 on board the &quot;M/V Jung Sheng Number 8&quot; when the 160-foot-long vessel was interdicted by the U.S. Coast Guard south of Hawaii. The &quot;Jung Sheng&quot; had left Canton, China en route to the United States on June 2 with 147 Chinese Illegal Immigrants, including 18 &quot;enforcers&quot;, and 11 crew on board. On July 29, the Chinese were transported to Wake Island, where they were cared for by U.S. military personnel, and on August 7, they were safely repatriated to China by commercial air charter. From October 10 to November 21, 1996, military units assigned to &quot;Operation Marathon Pacific&quot; used facilities at Wake Island as a staging area for the repatriation of another group of more than 113 Chinese illegal immigrants who had been interdicted in the Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda aboard the human smuggling vessel, the &quot;Xing Da&quot;.

====U.S. Air Force regains control====


On October 1, 2002, administrative control and support of Wake Island was transferred from the U.S. Army to the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s 15th Wing of PACAF based at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. The 15th Wing had previously controlled Wake from July 1, 1973, to September 30, 1994. Although the Air Force was again in control, the Missile Defense Agency would continue operating the Wake Island Launch Center. The U.S. Army&#x27;s Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site would maintain and operate the launch facilities and provide instrumentation, communications, flight and ground safety, security, and other support.

On August 31, 2006, Wake Island was hit by the Super Typhoon Ioke with sustained winds over 155 mph and gusts of 190; this caused damage to the wildlife and facilities on the atoll. There was considerable damage, but overall it was less than feared on inspection. The runway was largely intact, but some electrical and waste-water systems had been damaged. The golf course at Heel Point and Golf clubhouse was also damaged by the Ioke Typhoon.

On January 6, 2009, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 8836, establishing Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument to preserve the marine environments around Wake, Baker, Howland, and Jarvis Islands, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef and Palmyra Atoll. The proclamation assigned management of the nearby waters and submerged and emergent lands of the islands to the Department of the Interior and management of fishery-related activities in waters beyond 12 nautical miles from the islands&#x27; mean low water line to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). On January 16, Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne issued Order Number 3284 which stated that the area at Wake Island assigned to the Department of Interior by Executive Order 8836 will be managed as a National Wildlife Refuge. Management of the emergent lands at Wake Island by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, however, will not begin until the existing management agreement between the Secretary of the Air Force and the Secretary of the Interior is terminated.

The 611th Air Support Group (ASG), a U.S. Air Force unit based at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska took over control of Wake Island from the 15th Wing On October 1, 2010. The 611th ASG was already providing support and management to various geographically remote Air Force sites within Alaska, and the addition of Wake Island provided the unit with more opportunities for outdoor projects during the winter months when projects in Alaska are minimal. The 611th ASG, a unit of the 11th Air Force, was renamed the Pacific Air Forces Regional Support Center.
On September 27, 2014, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 9173 to expand the area of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument out to the full 200 nautical miles U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) boundary for each island. By this proclamation, the area of the monument at Wake Island was increased from . In 2014, 3300 tons of waste dumps was removed from the islands on barges.

On November 1, 2015, a complex $230 million U.S. military missile defense system test event, called &quot;Campaign Fierce Sentry&quot; Flight Test Operational-02 Event 2 (FTO-02 E2), was conducted at Wake Island and the surrounding ocean areas. The test involved a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system built by Lockheed Martin, two AN/TPY-2 radar systems built by Raytheon, Lockheed&#x27;s Command, Control, Battle Management, and Communications system, and guided missile destroyer with its AN/SPY-1 radar. The objective was to test the ability of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and THAAD Weapon Systems to defeat a raid of three near-simultaneous air and missile targets, consisting of one medium-range ballistic missile, one short-range ballistic missile and one cruise missile target. During the test, a THAAD system on Wake Island detected and destroyed a short-range target simulating a short-range ballistic missile launched by a C-17 transport plane. At the same time, the THAAD system and the destroyer launched missiles to intercept a medium-range ballistic missile launched by a second C-17.

In 2017, Thai contractors and armed forces personnel celebrated the Thai New Year or Songkran in April, and Thai King&#x27;s Day was celebrated in December. Wake at one point had an estimated 2 million rats, and despite eradication efforts hunting rats at night is popular activity of the islanders.

In early 2024, the island experienced multiple high waves that inundated areas, and this damaged dormitories and a dining hall. This was not the only U.S. facility damaged, to the south at Roi-Namur inundation also caused damage.

==Geography==

Although Wake Island is officially called an island in its singular form, it is geologically an atoll composed of three islets (Wake, Wilkes, and Peale islets). They enclose a shallow lagoon of , with average depth of around and a maximum depth of . It is ringed by a sandy beach of around wide with an offshore fringing reef. The atoll has an average elevation of about and maximum elevation of , with a total land area of about .

The island is made of coral and sand, as it sits on a coral reef that grew on the top of a seamount made of the remnants of an old volcano. This is consistent with many islands in the Pacific, which are formed when waves erode extinct volcanoes until they reach the surface of the ocean and coral grows on it, forming an atoll (see also guyot). The island is covered in boulders that average 5–6 feet in diameter (1–2 meters) especially on the southern side of Wake and Wilkes islands.

Wake is located two-thirds of the way from Honolulu to Guam; Honolulu is to the east, and Guam to the west. Midway Atoll is to the northeast. The closest land is the uninhabited Bokak Atoll, away in the Marshall Islands to the southeast. The atoll is to the west of the International Date Line and in the Wake Island Time Zone (UTC+12), the easternmost time zone of the United States and almost one day ahead of the 50 states.

A shallow channel separates Wake and Peale, while Wilkes is connected to Wake by a causeway. The partially completed submarine channel, which has washed through Wilkes at times, almost splits the island in half.

The atoll has several named capes and points:

*Wilkes Island (Split islet on the south and west)
**Kuku Point (Western Cape of Wilkes)
**Wilkes Channel (a channel to the small port/harbor area on the south side of the island)
**Submarine channel (an artificial channel for a partially completed World War II submarine harbor also called New Channel)
*Peale Island (on the north and west, separated from Wake by a narrow channel)
**Toki Point (Western Cape of Peale)
**Flipper Point (Tip of Peale island land that extends into the lagoon pointing west)
*Wake Island (excluding the islets)
**Heel Point (the north cape of Wake islet before it turns towards Peale)
**Peacock Point (the Southern and eastern point of Wake Island)
**Causeway crossing Wilkes Channel to Wilkes Island

===Climate===
Wake Island lies in the tropical zone but is subject to periodic temperate storms during the winter. Sea surface temperatures are warm all year long, reaching above in summer and autumn. Typhoons occasionally pass over the island. Temperatures range between and and it gets about 40 inches of rain each year, with the rainy season running from July through October. The island lies in the northeast trade winds of the Pacific.

====Typhoons====
On October 19, 1940, an unnamed typhoon hit Wake Island with winds. This was the first recorded typhoon to hit the island since observations began in 1935.

Super Typhoon Olive impacted Wake on September 16, 1952, with wind speeds reaching . Olive caused major flooding, destroyed approximately 85% of its structures, and caused in damage.

On September 16, 1967, at 10:40 pm local time, the eye of Super Typhoon Sarah passed over the island. Sustained winds in the eyewall were , from the north before the eye and the south afterward. All non-reinforced structures were demolished. There were no serious injuries, and most of the civilian population was evacuated after the storm.

On August 28, 2006, the United States Air Force evacuated all 188 residents and suspended all operations as Category 5 Super Typhoon Ioke headed toward Wake. By August 31 the southwestern eyewall of the storm passed over the island, with winds well over , driving a storm surge and waves directly into the lagoon inflicting major damage. A U.S. Air Force assessment and repair team returned to the island in September 2006 and restored limited function to the airfield and facilities leading ultimately to a full return to normal operations.

===Ecology===
Wake Island is home to the Wake Atoll National Wildlife Refuge and is a unit of the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument.
Native vegetation communities of Wake Island include scrub, grass, and wetlands. &quot;Tournefortia argentia&quot; (heliotrope tree) dominated scrublands exist in association with &quot;Scaevola taccada&quot; (beach cabbage), &quot;Cordia subcordata&quot; (sea trumpet), and &quot;Pisonia grandis&quot;. Grassland species include &quot;Dactyloctenium aegyptium&quot; and &quot;Tribulus cistoides&quot;. Wetlands are dominated by &quot;Sesuvium portulacastrum&quot;, and &quot;Pemphis acidula&quot; is found near intertidal lagoons. (see also List of birds of Wake Island)

The atoll, with its surrounding marine waters, has been recognized as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International for its sooty tern colony, with some 200,000 individual birds estimated in 1999. 56 bird species have been sighted on the atoll. Wilkes Island is largely designated as a bird refuge and includes a field mowed annually to attract sooty terns and other birds that might otherwise seek to nest on the mowed apron of the airfield runway.

Due to human use, several invasive species have become established on the atoll. Feral cats were introduced in the 1960s as pets and for pest control. Eradication efforts began in earnest in 1996 and were deemed successful in 2008. Two species of rat, &quot;Rattus exulans&quot; (Polynesian rat) and &quot;Rattus tanezumi&quot; (Asian house rat), have colonized the island. &quot;R. tanezumi&quot; populations were successfully eradicated by 2014, however, &quot;R. exulans&quot; persists. &quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot; (ironwood or coastal she-oak) was allegedly planted on Wake Island by Boy Scouts in the 1960s for use as a windbreak. It formed large mono-cultural forests that choked out native vegetation. Concerted efforts to kill the population began in 2017. Other introduced plant species include &quot;Cynodon dactylon&quot; (Bermuda grass) and &quot;Leucaena leucocephala&quot; (miracle tree). Non-native species of ants are also found on the atoll. Overall, the island is a mixture of tropical scrub brush and grass with trees; some of the trees are over 25 feet tall (over 7 meters).
The lagoon, surrounding reef, and the ocean are noted for their diverse collection of marine life. Wake waters have the largest known population of bumphead parrotfish (&quot;Bolbometopon muricatum)&quot;. The coral reef that surrounds the island is home to at least 100 species of coral and over 320 species of fish. In the coral reef, there is a diverse collection of shark species, including grey reef, blacktip, and dusky sharks. The atoll is home to multiple species of land crabs, with &quot;Coenobita perlatus&quot; being especially abundant.

==Demographics==
Wake Island has no permanent inhabitants, and access is restricted. However, as of 2017, there are approximately 100 Air Force personnel and American and Thai contractor residents at any given time. As of 2011, the billeting at the airfield supports 198 beds.

The start of habitation was in 1935, the staff of the Pan Am waypoint and hotel on Peale Island.

In 1941, over 500 troops and over 1200 contractors were on the island. At the surrender on December 24, 1,603 (not counting those that had died in the battle) were surrendered to the Japanese. There was also 45 people from Guam that had been employed at the Pan Am airport and hotel that were left there also, of those 10 died on Wake and 35 were sent to POW camps in Asia. During the war all but 98 civilians were taken off the island or died, so the main occupants became the Japanese garrison there. The Japanese garrison during the war was nearly 4000, as described earlier in this article. About 1000 of these were confirmed to have been taken away by hospital ship in June 1945.

There were 45 workers from Guam working to support the Pan Am airbase. During the battle for Wake Island, five were killed, and five more were wounded in the attacks on December 8, 1941. Afterward, the Wake Island commander asked if the workers would help defend the island, and they agreed. During the defense of the island, the five wounded workers were killed when the hospital was bombed. When the island fell to the Japanese forces, the 35 remaining were taken prisoner and sent to a Japanese POW camp in China, where two died and others were tortured. The 33 survivors were sent to Osaka, Japan, where they stayed until the end of the war. In 1988, the Guam workers were given veteran status and POW medals for their participation in the Battle of Wake Island.

In 1975, there were at one point 8,700 Vietnamese refugees on the atoll when it was used as a waypoint in &quot;Operation New Life&quot;.

In the early 21st century, many of the civilian contractors come from Thailand.

==Government==

According to an agreement between the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Air Force, on June 24, 1972, the United States Air Force assumed responsibility for the civil administration of Wake Island.

The Secretary of the Air Force has delegated the civil administration authority at Wake Island to the General Counsel of the Air Force under U.S. federal law known as the &quot;Wake Island Code&quot;. The general counsel provides civil, legal, and judicial authority and can appoint one or more judges to serve on the Wake Island Court and the Wake Island Court of Appeals.

Certain authorities have been re-delegated by the general counsel to the Commander, Wake Island, a position currently held by Commander, Detachment 1, Pacific Air Forces Regional Support Center. The commander may issue permits or registrations, appoint peace officers, impose quarantines, issue traffic regulations, commission notaries public, direct evacuations and inspections and carry out other duties, powers, and functions as the agent of the general counsel on Wake.

Since Wake Island is an active Air Force airfield, the commander is also the senior officer in charge of all activities on the island.

The Empire of Japan administered the atoll from December 23, 1941, to September 4, 1945.

The U.S. administered the island from January 17, 1899, when it was both unclaimed and uninhabited.

==Transportation==

===Aviation===

Air transportation facilities at Wake are operated by the United States Air Force at Wake Island Airfield in support of trans-Pacific military operations, western Pacific military contingency operations, and missile launch activities. The runway on Wake is also available to provide military and commercial in-flight emergency services. Although there is only one flight scheduled every other week to transport passengers and cargo to Wake, approximately 600 aircraft per year use Wake Island Airfield.

In 2020, the runway and support facilities were modernized.

===Ports===
Although Wake Island is supplied by seagoing barges and ships, the island&#x27;s only harbor between Wilkes and Wake is too narrow and shallow for seagoing vessels to enter. The Base Operations Support (BOS) contractor maintains three small landing barges for transferring material from ships moored offshore to the dockyard in the harbor. Hydrants also pump gasoline and JP-5 fuels to the storage tanks on Wilkes. The landing barges and recreational offshore sportfishing boats are docked in the marina. A submarine channel was planned for Wilkes Island, but was just partially complete at the start of hostilities in World War II.

===Roads===

Transportation on Wake Island is provided by contractors or government-owned vehicles. The primary road is a two-lane paved road extending the length of Wake Island to the causeway between Wake Island and Wilkes Island. A bridge connecting Wake and Peale Islands burned down in December 2002. The causeway was rehabilitated in 2003 and is capable of supporting heavy equipment. A combination of paved and coral gravel roads serves the marina area. Paved access to Wilkes Island ends at the petroleum tank farm, where a road constructed of crushed coral provides access to the western point of Wilkes Island. Near the unfinished WWII submarine channel, a portion of the road is flooded nearly every year by high seas. The launch sites are accessed from the main paved road on Wake Island by paved and coral roads. Generally, the road network is suitable for low-speed, light-duty use only. Wake Island&#x27;s paved roadway network has been adequately maintained to move materials, services, and personnel from the airfield on the southern end to the personnel support area on the northern end. Modes of transportation include walking, bicycles, light utility carts, automobiles, vans, and larger trucks and equipment.

The main road that connects Wilkes and most of Wake Island is a crushed coral road about wide that runs the perimeter. There used to be since World War II a 450-foot-long timber bridge between Wake and Peale. With the bridge gone to traverse between Wake and Peale is usually done by a kayak trip.

==Territorial claims==

No one lodged any complaints or counter-claims after the 1899, although the US occasionally found Japanese bird hunters on the island and so formally asked the Japanese about this, but they reaffirmed that they were not claiming Wake with a diplomatic note. Japanese Minister Takahira Kogorō said in 1902 that the Japanese Government had &quot;no claim whatever to make on the sovereignty of the island, but that if any subjects are found on the island the Imperial Government expects that they should be properly protected as long as they are engaged in peaceful occupations.&quot; (see also Root–Takahira Agreement) The island did not become an issue until World War II, the Japanese occupied the island from December 23, 1941, to September 4, 1945, as mentioned previously in this article.

For 75 years, there were no claims on Wake until 1973, when a claim was made from the Congress of the Trust Territory of the Pacific. The Marshallese were people living on islands that Germany annexed in the late 19th century, taken in World War I, and under Japanese control until 1944, when the U.S. captured the islands The U.S. was to administer the islands after World War II but the Congress of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, which was established in 1964, attempted to make a change. In 1973, Marshallese in the Trust Territory of the Pacific claimed Wake Island, which they call Ānen Kio (new orthography) or Enen-kio (old orthography). As mentioned elsewhere in the Article, Wake had always been found to be uninhabited and was formally annexed by the US in 1899. In 1973, Marshallese lawmakers meeting in Saipan at the Congress of Micronesia, the legislative body for the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, asserted that &quot;Enen-kio is and always has been the property of the people of the Marshall Islands&quot;. Their claim was based on oral legends and songs, passed down through generations, describing ancient Marshallese voyages to Wake to gather food and a sacred bird&#x27;s wing bone used in traditional tattooing ceremonies. In 1990, legislation in the U.S. Congress proposed including Wake Island within the boundaries of the U.S. territory of Guam. In response, Marshallese President Amata Kabua reasserted his nation&#x27;s claim to Wake, declaring that Enen-kio was a site of great importance to the traditional rituals of the Marshall Islands.

The self-declared Kingdom of EnenKio has also claimed Wake Island as a separate sovereign nation and has issued passports. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not recognized in any international forum as a sovereign state, nor does any internationally recognized state recognize it. The Kingdom of EnenKio is characterized as a scam by anti-fraud website Quatloos!. In 2000, Robert Moore, who claimed to be the head of state, was prevented by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from fraudulently issuing bonds for the non-existent nation. On April 23, 1998, the Marshall Islands government notified all countries with which it has diplomatic ties that the claims of the Kingdom of EnenKio are fraudulent.

==U.S. National Historic Landmark and NRHP==
In the early 1980s, the National Park Service evaluated Wake Island to determine if the World War II (WWII) cultural resources remaining on Wake, Wilkes, and Peale were of national historical significance. As a result of this survey, Wake Island was designated as a National Historic Landmark on September 16, 1985, helping preserve sites and artifacts on the atoll associated with World War II in the Pacific and the transpacific aviation era before the war. As a National Historic Landmark, Wake Island was also included in the National Register of Historic Places.


Historic items at the island include:
*Several old shipwrecks, including at least six vessels from World War II and the remains of several sailing vessels
*Bunkers and items from World War II US and Japanese military bases, such as pill boxes, bunkers, and gun emplacements
*Additional cultural items from prisoners of war, memorials, and other structures
*World War II aircraft underwater in the reefs

There is also danger of unexploded ordinance (UXO) on the atolls and submerged in reefs. The island was surveyed in 2010 for historical items and structures, and during that time, various UXOs were encountered and destroyed. One issue with many of the structures was that the salty sea air caused corrosion on the reinforced concrete buildings and gun emplacements.

In 2011, anthropological work discovered several more human remains on the island, at the site of the POW execution. The island was the initial burial site for American and Japanese dead from World War II. One of the issues with the human remains from the 1943 massacre was that they were buried, then dug up and reburied, then dug up again and reburied at Peacock Point in August 1945 in mass graves; those were exhumed yet again after the war and moved to the United States National Cemetery of the Pacific. At the national cemetery, both those who died during the battle for Wake or as POWs were interred and honored with a ceremony in 1953 in Hawaii.

There are many memorials to historic events on the island. Memorials and historical sites include the 98 rock, Nitro rock, Wake Defenders Memorial, Harry Morrison and Civilian Construction Memorial, Japanese Memorial, Historical Command Post, Historical Aircraft Revetments, 8&quot; Peale Island Gun, Pan Am Hotel and seaplane base remains. The islands are also noted for nature, including about 40,000 birds of 12 different types. One of the noted locations is Drifter&#x27;s Reef Bar for those stationed on the island.

<text>Wallis and Futuna, officially the Territory of the Wallis and Futuna Islands (), is a French island collectivity in the South Pacific, situated between Tuvalu to the northwest, Fiji to the southwest, Tonga to the southeast, Samoa to the east, and Tokelau to the northeast.

Mata Utu is its capital and largest city. The territory&#x27;s land area is . It had a population of 11,151 at the July 2023 census (down from 14,944 at the 2003 census). The territory is made up of three main volcanic tropical islands and a number of tiny islets. It is divided into two island groups that lie about apart: the Wallis Islands (also known as Uvea) in the northeast; and the Hoorn Islands (also known as the Futuna Islands) in the southwest, including Futuna Island proper and the mostly uninhabited Alofi Island.

Since 28 March 2003, Wallis and Futuna has been a French overseas collectivity (, or ). Between 1961 and 2003, it had the status of a French overseas territory (, or ). Its official name did not change with the change in its status.

==History==

===Early humans===
The earliest signs of human habitation on these islands are artifacts characteristic of the Lapita culture, dating roughly to between 850 and 800 BCE. The islands served as natural stopover points for boat traffic, mostly between Fiji and Samoa. During Tongan invasions in the 15th and 16th centuries, the islands defended themselves with varying levels of resistance, but also accepted varying degrees of assimilation. Futuna retained more of its pre-Tongan cultural features, while Wallis underwent greater fundamental changes in its society, language, and culture. The original inhabitants built forts and other identifiable structures on the islands (many of which are in ruins), some of which are still partially intact. Oral history and archaeological evidence suggests that the Tongan invaders re-occupied and modified some of these structures. The oral history also preserves a cultural memory of relationships between Samoa and Futuna that are so longstanding, they are described in the islanders&#x27; origin stories.

===European settlements===
Futuna was first put on European maps by Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire, during their circumnavigation of the globe, in 1616. They named the islands of Futuna &quot;Hoornse Eylanden&quot;, after the Dutch town of Hoorn where they hailed from. This was later translated into French, as &quot;Isles de Horne.&quot; The Wallis Islands are named after the British explorer Samuel Wallis, who sailed past them in 1767, after being the first European to visit Tahiti. The French were the first Europeans to settle in the territory, with the arrival of French missionaries in 1837, who converted the population to Roman Catholicism. Pierre Chanel, canonized in 1954, is a major patron saint of the island of Futuna and of the region.

On 5 April 1842, the missionaries asked for the protection of France, after the uprising of part of the local population. On 5 April 1887, the queen of Uvea (of the traditional chiefdom of Wallis) signed a treaty, officially establishing a French protectorate. The kings of Sigave and Alo (on the islands of Futuna and Alofi) also signed a treaty establishing a French protectorate, on 16 February 1888. From that moment, the islands were officially under the authority of the French colony of New Caledonia.

In 1917, the three traditional kingdoms of Uvea, Sigave, and Alo were annexed by France, integrated into the colony of Wallis and Futuna, and remained under the authority of the colony of New Caledonia.

===World War II===

During World War II, the islands&#x27; administration was briefly pro-Vichy, until a &quot;Free French&quot; corvette from New Caledonia deposed the regime, on 26 May 1942. Units of the US Marine Corps later landed on Wallis, on 29 May 1942.

===Overseas territory===
In 1959, the inhabitants of the islands voted to become a separate French overseas territory, effective since 29 July 1961, thus ending their subordination to New Caledonia.

In 2005, the 50th king of Uvea, Tomasi Kulimoetoke II, faced being deposed after giving sanctuary to his grandson who was convicted of manslaughter. The king claimed his grandson should be judged by tribal law rather than by the French penal system. As a result, there were riots in the streets involving the king&#x27;s supporters, who were victorious over attempts to replace the king. Two years later, Tomasi Kulimoetoke died on 7 May 2007. There was a six-month period of mourning, during which mentioning a successor was forbidden. On 25 July 2008, Kapeliele Faupala was installed as king despite protests from some of the royal clans. He was deposed in 2014. A new king, Patalione Kanimoa, was eventually installed in Uvea in 2016; Lino Leleivai in Alo on Futuna succeeded after Filipo Katoa abdicated, and Eufenio Takala succeeded Polikalepo Kolivai in Sigave. The French president at the time, François Hollande, attended the installation ceremony.

==Governance and law==
The territory is divided into three traditional kingdoms (&quot;royaumes coutumiers&quot;): Uvea, on the island of Wallis, Sigave, on the western part of the island of Futuna, and Alo, on the eastern part of the island of Futuna and on the uninhabited island of Alofi (only Uvea is further subdivided, into three districts):

The capital of the collectivity is Mata Utu on the island of Uvéa, the most populous of the Wallis Islands. As an overseas collectivity of France, it is governed under the French constitution of 28 September 1958, and has universal suffrage for those over 18 years of age. The French president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term; the high administrator is appointed by the French president on the advice of the French Ministry of the Interior; the presidents of the Territorial Government and the Territorial Assembly are elected by the members of the assembly. The most recent election was held on 20 March 2022.

As of 2023, the head of state is President Emmanuel Macron of France, as represented by Administrator-Superior Hervé Jonathan. The president of the Territorial Assembly has been Munipoese Muliʻakaʻaka since March 2022. The Council of the Territory consists of three kings (monarchs of the three pre-colonial kingdoms) and three members appointed by the high administrator on the advice of the Territorial Assembly.

The legislative branch consists of the unicameral 20-member Territorial Assembly or &quot;Assemblée territoriale&quot;. Its members are elected by popular vote, and serve five-year terms. Wallis and Futuna elects one senator to the French Senate and one deputy to the French National Assembly.

Criminal justice is generally governed by French law and administered by a tribunal of first resort in Mata Utu; appeals from that tribunal are decided by the Court of Appeal in Nouméa, New Caledonia. However, in non-criminal cases (civil-law disputes), the three traditional kingdoms administer justice according to customary law.

The territory participates in the Franc Zone, and is both a permanent member of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community and an observer at the Pacific Islands Forum.

==Geography and climate==

Wallis and Futuna is located at , west of Samoa and northeast of Fiji — about one-third of the way northeast from New Zealand towards Hawaii.

The territory includes the island of Uvéa (also called Wallis), which is the most populous; the island of Futuna; the virtually uninhabited island of Alofi; and 20 uninhabited islets. The total area of the territory is , with of coastline. The highest point in the territory is Mont Puke, on the island of Futuna, at .

The islands have a hot, rainy season from November to April, when tropical cyclones passing over them cause storms. Then they have a cool, dry season from May to October, caused by the southeast trade winds that predominate during those months. The average annual rainfall is between , and rain is likely on at least 260 days per year. The average humidity is 80%. The average annual temperature is , rarely falling below ; during the rainy season, it ranges between .

Only 5% of the islands&#x27; land area consists of arable land; permanent crops cover another 20%. Deforestation is a serious problem: Only small portions of the original forests remain, largely because the inhabitants use wood as their main fuel source, and, as a result, the mountainous terrain of Futuna is particularly susceptible to erosion. The island of Alofi lacks natural freshwater resources, so it has no permanent settlements.

Volcanic activity during the mid-Pleistocene created numerous volcanic crater lakes on Uvea (Wallis Island). The names of some of them are: Lalolalo, Lano, Lanutavake, Lanutuli, Lanumaha, Kikila, and Alofivai.

Wallis and Futuna is part of the Fiji tropical moist forests terrestrial ecoregion.

==Economy==

The GDP of Wallis and Futuna in 2019 was US$212 million (at market exchange rates). 
The territory&#x27;s economy consists mostly of traditional subsistence agriculture, with about 80% of the labor force earning its livelihood from agriculture (coconuts and vegetables), livestock (mostly pigs), and fishing. About 4% of the population is employed in government. Additional revenue comes from French government subsidies, licensing of fishing rights to Japan and South Korea, import taxes, and remittances from expatriate workers in New Caledonia, French Polynesia, and France. Industries include copra, handicrafts, fishing, and lumber. Agricultural products include coconuts, breadfruit, yams, taro, bananas, pigs, and fish.
Exports include copra, chemicals, and fish.

There is a single bank in the territory, Banque de Wallis-et-Futuna, established in 1991. It is a subsidiary of BNP Paribas. There had previously been a branch of Banque Indosuez at Mata Utu. It had opened in 1977, but was closed in 1989, leaving the territory without any bank for two years.

== Demographics ==
===Population===

The total population of the territory at the July 2023 census was 11,151 (72.5% on the island of Wallis, 27.5% on the island of Futuna), down from 14,944 at the July 2003 census. The vast majority of the population are of Polynesian ethnicity, with a small minority who were born in Metropolitan France or are of French European descent.

Lack of economic opportunities has, since the 1950s, been impelling many young Wallisians and Futunians to migrate to the more prosperous French territory of New Caledonia, where, as French citizens, they are legally entitled to settle and work. Since the mid-2000s, emigration has surged in response to political tensions on the main island of Wallis (Uvea), that have arisen from a feud between rival aristocratic clans, who are supporting competing kings. Emigrants have begun settling, not only in New Caledonia, but also much farther away, in Metropolitan France. At the 2019 New Caledonian census, 22,520 residents of New Caledonia (whether born in New Caledonia or in Wallis and Futuna) reported their ethnicity as &quot;Wallisian and Futunian&quot;. This is almost double the total population of Wallis and Futuna.

===Religion===

The overwhelming majority (99%) of the people in Wallis and Futuna are Catholics, with the island having been evangelized in the 19th century by Fr Peter Chanel, SM. They are served by their own Diocese of Wallis and Futuna, with a see at Mata Utu, a suffragan diocese of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Nouméa (New Caledonia).

== Culture ==

The culture of Wallis and Futuna is Polynesian, and is similar to the cultures of its neighboring nations Samoa and Tonga. The Wallisian and Futunan cultures are very similar to each other in language, dance, cuisine and modes of celebration.

Fishing and agriculture are the traditional occupations, and most people live in traditional oval, thatch &quot;fale&quot; houses. Kava is a popular beverage brewed in the two islands, as in much else of Polynesia. It also serves as a traditional offering in rituals. Highly detailed tapa cloth art is a specialty of Wallis and Futuna.

Uvea Museum Association is a private museum that holds a collection of objects that record the history of the Second World War in the territory. It is located in Mata Utu shopping center and in 2009 was open by appointment.

==Transport and communications==
In 2018, the territory had 3,132 telephones in use, one AM radio station, and two television broadcast stations. Communication costs are up to ten times higher than in western countries. The island of Wallis has about of roadways, 16 of which are paved. The island of Futuna has only of roadways, none of which are paved. The territory has two main ports, in the harbors at Mata Utu and Leava (on the island of Futuna). These ports support its merchant marine fleet, which comprises three ships (two passenger ships and a petroleum tanker), totaling 92,060 GRT or 45,881 tonnes. There are two airports: Hihifo Airport, on Wallis, which has a paved runway; and Pointe Vele Airport, on Futuna, which has a runway. Now the only commercial flights to and from Wallis are operated by Caledonia-based Aircalin, which has an office in Mata Utu. There are currently no commercial boat operators.

=== Newspapers ===
The French High Commission published a local newspaper in the 1970s, &quot;Nouvelles de Wallis et de Futuna&quot;. Today, news is available online via a local program broadcast by the French television network La Première.

==Education==
There are 18 primary schools in the territory, 12 on Wallis and six on Futuna, with a combined total of over 5200 students.

The territory has six junior high schools and one senior high school/sixth-form college.
*Junior high schools (&quot;collèges&quot;) in Wallis: Mataotama de Malae, Alofivai de Lano, Vaimoana de Lavegahau, and Tinemui de Teesi
*Junior high schools in Futuna: Fiua de Sigave and Sisia d&#x27;Ono
*The senior high school/sixth-form college is Lycée d&#x27;État de Wallis et Futuna on Wallis

There is also an agricultural high school.

==Healthcare==

As of 2018, yaws was endemic in the area, but cases were not being reported to the WHO eradication program.

Healthcare is available free of charge in two hospitals on Uvea and Futuna islands. There are also three dispensaries.

==Environment==
Deforestation is a major concern in the region as only small portions of the original forests remain due to the continued use of wood as the main source of fuel. Consequently, the mountainous terrain of Futuna has become prone to erosion. There are no permanent settlements on Alofi due to the lack of natural freshwater resources, and the presence of infertile soil on the islands of Uvea and Futuna further reduces agricultural productivity.

==Sport==
Wallis and Futuna competes in the Pacific Games. Volleyball and rugby union are popular in the territory, with several rugby players going on to play for the France national rugby union team.

<text>Demographic features of the population of Wallis and Futuna include population density, ethnicity, religious affiliations and other aspects. Statistics are from INSEE and the United Nations Demographic Yearbooks.

==Population==

Between July 24 and August 19, 2023, 11,151 people were counted in Wallis and Futuna (8,088 in Wallis and 3,063 in Futuna). Since 2003, these French Pacific islands have been facing a decrease in their population due to a strong emigration of young people of university or working age. This decrease was particularly marked between 2003 and 2013 (-2.0% on average per year), then it eased between 2013 and 2023 (-0.9% per year). The majority of the inhabitants (72.5%) live in Wallis, which has the highest population density of the two inhabited islands (104 inhabitants per km² compared to only 48 inhabitants per km² in Futuna). Over the last twenty years, the population has fallen by 25.4%, but the population decline has been half as pronounced in Wallis as in Futuna (respectively -19.7% versus -37.1%).

The evolution of a population depends on the natural balance and the migratory balance. In Wallis and Futuna, natural increase has been divided by five in past twenty years. As the balance of births over deaths is very slightly in surplus, the migratory deficit explains the decline in the population. Between the censuses of 2018 and 2023, natural increase was only 42 people on average per year. It contributed 0.4% to the average annual population increase, compared to 0.7% between 2013 and 2018 (80 people per year) and 1.5% over the period 1996-2003 (218 people per year). However, the migratory balance has been in deficit since 1969 (except during the period from 1976 to 1983). It has contributed to the decline in population over the last five years (-1.1% per year on average), but less significantly than before (-3.2% per year on average between 2003 and 2008).

<text>This page is an overview of the economy of [[Wallis and Futuna]].

== Finance ==
The GDP of Wallis and Futuna in 2005 was 188 million US dollars at market exchange rates. The GDP per capita was 12,640 US dollars in 2005 (at market exchange rates, not at PPP), which is lower than in New Caledonia, French Polynesia, and all the other French overseas departments and territories (except Mayotte), but higher than in all the small insular independent states of Oceania.

Along with the French territories of New Caledonia and French Polynesia, the territory uses the CFP Franc, which is fixed vs. the euro, at the rate of 1,000 XPF = 8.38 euro. In 1991, BNP Nouvelle-Calédonie, a subsidiary of BNP Paribas, established a subsidiary, Banque de Wallis et Futuna, which currently is the only bank in the territory. Two years earlier Banque Indosuez had closed the branch at Mata-Utu that it had opened in 1977, leaving the territory without any bank.

== Agriculture and industry ==
The territory&#x27;s economy is limited to traditional subsistence agriculture, with about 80% of the labor force earning its livelihood from agriculture (coconuts and vegetables), livestock (mostly pigs), and fishing. Agricultural products include breadfruit, yams, taro, bananas, pigs, and goats.

Industries include copra, handicrafts, fishing, and lumber. In 2007, US$63 million worth of commodities (foodstuffs, manufactured goods, transportation equipment, fuel, clothing) were imported, primarily from France, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand, and there were no exports (the previous year, in 2006, exports amounted to US$122,000 and consisted entirely of 19 tons of trochus shells). About 4% of the population is employed in government. Revenues come from French government subsidies, licensing of fishing rights to Japan and South Korea, import taxes, and remittances from expatriate workers in New Caledonia, French Polynesia and France.

<text>The West Bank (; ), so called due to its location relative to the Jordan River, is the larger of the two Palestinian territories (the other being the Gaza Strip) that make up the State of Palestine. A landlocked territory near the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the Levant region of West Asia, it is bordered by Jordan and the Dead Sea to the east and by Israel (via the Green Line) to the south, west, and north. Since 1967, the territory has been under Israeli occupation, which has been regarded illegal under the law of the international community.

The territory first emerged in the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War as a region occupied and subsequently annexed by Jordan. Jordan ruled the territory until the 1967 Six-Day War, when it was occupied by Israel. Since then, Israel has administered the West Bank as the Judea and Samaria Area, expanding its claim into East Jerusalem in 1980. Jordan continued to claim the territory as its own until 1988. The mid-1990s Oslo Accords split the West Bank into three regional levels of Palestinian sovereignty, via the Palestinian National Authority (PNA): Area A (PNA), Area B (PNA and Israel), and Area C (Israel, comprising 60% of the West Bank). The PNA exercises total or partial civil administration over 165 Palestinian enclaves across the three areas. 

The West Bank remains central to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The Palestinians consider it the heart of their envisioned state, along with the Gaza Strip. Right-wing and religious Israelis see it as their ancestral homeland, with numerous biblical sites. There is a push among some Israelis for partial or complete annexation of this land. Additionally, it is home to a rising number of Israeli settlers. Area C contains 230 Israeli settlements into which Israeli law is applied and under the Oslo Accords was supposed to be mostly transferred to the PNA by 1997, but this did not occur. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank to be illegal under international law. Citing the 1980 law in which Israel claimed Jerusalem as its capital, the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, and the Oslo Accords, a 2004 advisory ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) concluded that the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, remain Israeli-occupied territory. In 2024 the ICJ again ruled that Israel&#x27;s occupation of the West Bank is unlawful, adding that their conduct also violates the international prohibition on racial segregation and apartheid.

The West Bank has a land area of about . It has an estimated population of 2,747,943 Palestinians, and over 670,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank, of which approximately 220,000 live in East Jerusalem.

==Etymology==

===West Bank===
The name &quot;West Bank&quot; is a translation of the Arabic term , which designates the territory situated on the western side of the Jordan River that was occupied in 1948 and annexed in 1950 by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. This annexation was widely considered to be illegal, and was recognized only by Iraq, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom.

===Cisjordan===
Variations on the neo-Latin name &quot;Cisiordania&quot; () are the usual names for the territory in Romance languages, e.g. , , , , and , and in some others, e.g. , , , , and . The name &quot;West Bank&quot;, however, has become the standard usage for this geopolitical entity in English and some of the other Germanic languages since its inception following the 1948 Jordanian capture.

The analogous &quot;Transjordan&quot; () was historically used to designate the region now roughly comprising the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which lies to the east of the Jordan River.

==History==

From 1517 to 1917, the area now known as the West Bank was under Turkish rule, as part of Ottoman Syria.

At the 1920 San Remo conference, the victorious Allies of World War I allocated the area to the British Mandate of Palestine (1920–1948). The San Remo Resolution, adopted on 25 April 1920, incorporated the Balfour Declaration of 1917. It and Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations were the basic documents upon which the British Mandate of Palestine was constructed. The United Kingdom proclaimed Abdullah I as emir of the Emirate of Transjordan on 11 April 1921. He declared it an independent Hashemite kingdom on 25 May 1946.

Under the United Nations in 1947, it was designated as part of a proposed Arab state by the Partition Plan for Palestine. UN Resolution 181 recommended the splitting of the British Mandate into a Jewish state, an Arab state, and an internationally administered enclave of Jerusalem. A broader region of the modern-day West Bank was assigned to the Arab state. The resolution designated the territory described as &quot;the hill country of Samaria and Judea&quot;, the area now known as the &quot;West Bank&quot;, as part of the proposed Arab state. Following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, this area was captured by Transjordan.

===Jordanian West Bank===

During the 1948 war, Israel occupied parts of what was designated in the UN partition plan as &quot;Palestine&quot;. The 1949 Armistice Agreements defined the interim boundary between Israel and Jordan, essentially reflecting the battlefield after the war. Following the December 1948 Jericho Conference, Transjordan annexed the area west of the Jordan River in 1950, naming it &quot;West Bank&quot; or &quot;Cisjordan&quot;, and designated the area east of the river as &quot;East Bank&quot; or &quot;Transjordan&quot;. Jordan, as it was now known, ruled over the West Bank from 1948 until 1967. Jordan&#x27;s annexation was never formally recognized by the international community, with the exception of the United Kingdom and Iraq. King Abdullah of Jordan was crowned King of Jerusalem by the Coptic Bishop on 15 November 1948. Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, were granted Jordanian citizenship and half of the Jordanian Parliament seats, thus enjoying equal opportunities in all sectors of the state.

Many refugees continued to live in camps and relied on UNRWA assistance for sustenance. Palestinian refugees constituted more than a third of the kingdom&#x27;s population of 1.5 million. The last Jordanian elections in which West Bank residents voted in were those of April 1967. Their parliamentary representatives continued in office until 1988, when West Bank seats were abolished. Palestinians enjoyed equal opportunities in all sectors of the state without discrimination. Agriculture remained the primary activity of the territory. The West Bank, despite its smaller area, contained half of Jordan&#x27;s agricultural land.

In 1966, 43% of the labor force of 55,000 worked in agriculture, and 2,300 km2 were under cultivation. In 1965, 15,000 workers were employed in industry, producing 7% of the GNP. This number fell after the 1967 war and was not surpassed until 1983. The tourism industry played an important role. 26 branches of 8 Arab banks were present. The Jordanian dinar became legal tender and remains so until today. 80% of Jordan&#x27;s fruit-growing land and 40% of its vegetables lay in the West Bank. With the onset of the occupation, the area could no longer produce export earnings.

On the eve of occupation, the West Bank accounted for 40% of Jordanian GNP, between 34% and 40% of its agricultural output and almost half of its manpower, though only a third of Jordanian investment was allocated to it and mainly to the private housing construction sector. Even though its per-capita product was 10 times greater than that of the West Bank, the Israeli economy on the eve of occupation had experienced two years (1966–1967) of a sharp recession.

Immediately after the occupation, from 1967 to 1974, the economy boomed. In 1967, the Palestinian economy had a gross domestic product of $1,349 per capita for a million people. The West Bank&#x27;s population was 585,500, of whom 18% were refugees, and was growing annually by 2%. West Bank growth, compared to Gaza (3%), had lagged, due to the effect of mass emigration of West Bankers seeking employment in Jordan. As agriculture gave way to industrial development in Israel, in the West Bank the former still generated 37% of domestic product, and industry a mere 13%.

The growth rate of the West Bank economy in the period of the Jordanian rule of the West Bank, before Israeli occupation, had ticked along at an annual rate of 6–8%. This rate of growth was indispensable if the post-war West Bank were to achieve economic self-reliance.

===Israeli Military Governorate and Civil Administration===

In June 1967, the West Bank and East Jerusalem were captured by Israel as a result of the Six-Day War. With the exception of East Jerusalem and the former Israeli–Jordanian no man&#x27;s land, the West Bank was not annexed by Israel. It remained under Israeli military control until 1982.

The 1974 Arab League summit resolution at Rabat designated the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the &quot;sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people&quot;. Jordan did not officially relinquish its claim to the area until 1988, when it severed all administrative and legal ties with the West Bank and eventually stripped West Bank Palestinians of Jordanian citizenship.

In 1982, as a result of the Egypt–Israel peace treaty, the direct military rule was transformed into a semi-civil authority, operating directly under the Israeli Ministry of Defense, taking control of civil matters of Palestinians from the IDF to civil servants in the Ministry of Defense. The Israeli settlements were administered as Judea and Samaria Area, directly by Israel.

Since the 1993 Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority officially controls a geographically non-contiguous territory comprising approximately 11% of the West Bank, known as Area A, which remains subject to Israeli incursions. Area B, approximately 28%, is subject to joint Israeli-Palestinian military and Palestinian civil control. Area C, approximately 61%, is under full Israeli control. Though 164 nations refer to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as &quot;Occupied Palestinian Territory&quot;, the state of Israel quotes the UN that only territories captured in war from &quot;an established and recognized sovereign&quot; are considered occupied territories.

After the 2007 split between Fatah and Hamas, the West Bank areas under Palestinian control are an exclusive part of the Palestinian Authority. The Gaza Strip is ruled by Hamas.

===Early economic impact===
The Jordanians neglected to invest much in the area during their time governing the area, although there was some investment in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem.

Soon after the 1967 war, Yigal Allon produced the Allon Plan, which would have annexed a strip along the Jordan River valley and excluded areas closer to the pre-1967 border, which had a high density of Palestinians. Moshe Dayan proposed a plan which Gershom Gorenberg likens to a &quot;photo negative of Allon&#x27;s.&quot; The Allon plan evolved over a period of time to include more territory. The final draft dating from 1970 would have annexed about half of the West Bank. Israel had no overall approach for integrating the West Bank.

The early occupation set severe limits on public investment and comprehensive development programmes in the territories. British and Arab commercial banks operating in the West Bank were closed down soon after Israel assumed power there. Bank Leumi then opened nine branches, without successfully replacing the earlier system. Farmers could get loans, but Palestinian businessmen avoided taking out loans from them, since they charged 9% compared to 5% interest in Jordan. By June 1967, only a third of West Bank land had been registered under Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Settlement of Disputes over Land and Water Law&quot;. In 1968, Israel moved to cancel the possibility of registering one&#x27;s title with the Jordanian Land Register.

Ian Lustick states that Israel &quot;virtually prevented&quot; Palestinian investment in local industry and agriculture. At the same time, Israel encouraged Arab labour to enter into Israel&#x27;s economy, and regarded them as a new, expanded and protected market for Israeli exports. Limited export of Palestinian goods to Israel was allowed. Expropriation of prime agricultural land in an economy where two thirds of the workforce had farmed is believed to account for the flight of labourers to work in Israel.

As much as 40% of the workforce commuted to Israel on a daily basis finding only poorly paid menial employment. Remittances from labourers earning a wage in Israel were the major factor in Palestinian economic growth during the 1969–73 boom years. The migration of workers from the territories had a negative impact on local industry, by creating an internal labour scarcity in the West Bank and consequent pressure for higher wages there. The contrast between the quality of their lives and Israelis&#x27; growing prosperity stoked resentment.

Attempting to impose governmental authority, Israel established a licensing system according to which no industrial plant could be built without obtaining a prior Israeli permit. With Military Order No. 393 (14 June 1970), the local commander was given the power and authority to block any construction if, in his evaluation, the building might pose a danger to Israel&#x27;s security. The overall effect was to obstruct manufacturing development and subordinate any local industrial activity to the exigencies of Israel&#x27;s economy, or to block the creation of industries that might compete with Israel&#x27;s. For example, entrepreneurs were denied a permit for a cement factory in Hebron. In order to protect Israeli farmers, melon production was forbidden, imports of grapes and dates were banned, and limits were set to how many cucumbers and tomatoes could be produced. Israeli milk producers exerted pressure on the Ministry for Industry and Trade to stop the establishment of a competitive dairy in Ramallah.

The sum effect after two decades was that 15% of all Palestinian firms in the West Bank and Gaza employing over eight people, and 32% with seven or less, were prohibited from selling their products in Israel. Israeli protectionist policies distorted wider trade relations to the point that, by 1996, 90% of all West Bank imports came from Israel, with consumers paying more than they would for comparable products had they been able to exercise commercial autonomy.

===Legal status===

From 1517 to 1917 the West Bank was part of the Ottoman Empire. Turkey, successor state to the Ottoman Empire, renounced its territorial claims in 1923, signing the Treaty of Lausanne, and the area now called the West Bank became an integral part of the British Mandate for Palestine. During the Mandate period Britain had no right of sovereignty, which was held by the people under the mandate. Nevertheless, Britain, as custodians of the land, implemented the land tenure laws in Palestine, which it had inherited from the Ottoman Turks (as defined in the Ottoman Land Code of 1858), applying these laws to both Arab and Jewish legal tenants or otherwise. In 1947 the UN General Assembly recommended that the area that became the West Bank become part of a future Arab state, but this proposal was opposed by the Arab states at the time. In 1948, Jordan occupied the West Bank and annexed it in 1950.

In 1967, Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the Six-Day War. UN Security Council Resolution 242 followed, calling for withdrawal (return to the 1949 armistice lines) from territories occupied in the conflict in exchange for peace and mutual recognition. Since 1979, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, the United States, the EU, the International Court of Justice, and the International Committee of the Red Cross refer to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as occupied Palestinian territory or the occupied territories. General Assembly resolution 58/292 (17 May 2004) affirmed that the Palestinian people have the right to sovereignty over the area.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the Supreme Court of Israel have ruled that the status of the West Bank is that of military occupation. In its 2004 advisory opinion the International Court of Justice concluded that:

In the same vein the Israeli Supreme Court stated in the 2004 &quot;Beit Sourik&quot; case that:

The executive branch of the Israeli government, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has defined the West Bank as &quot;disputed&quot; instead of &quot;occupied&quot; territory, whose status can only be determined through negotiations. The Ministry argues that the West Bank was not captured in war because it was not under the legitimate sovereignty of any state prior to the Six-Day War (when it was occupied by Israel).

The International Court of Justice ruling of 9 July 2004, however, found that the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is territory held by Israel under military occupation, regardless of its status prior to it coming under Israeli occupation, and that the Fourth Geneva convention applies &quot;de jure&quot;. The international community regards the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) as territories occupied by Israel.

In 2024, the ICJ reaffirmed in an advisory ruling that Israel&#x27;s military occupation of the West Bank (along with the Gaza strip and East Jerusalem) is unlawful. The ruling also added that Israel&#x27;s &quot;legislation and measures violate the international prohibition on racial segregation and apartheid.&quot;

International law (Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention) prohibits &quot;transfers of the population of an occupying power to occupied territories&quot;, incurring a responsibility on the part of Israel&#x27;s government to not settle Israeli citizens in the West Bank.

As of June 2024, 146 (75.6%) of the 193 member states of the United Nations have recognised the State of Palestine within the Palestinian territories, which are recognized by Israel to constitute a single territorial unit, and of which the West Bank is the core of the would-be state. 
===Political status===
The future status of the West Bank, together with the Gaza Strip on the Mediterranean shore, has been the subject of negotiation between the Palestinians and Israelis, although the 2002 Road Map for Peace, proposed by the &quot;Quartet&quot; comprising the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations, envisions an independent Palestinian state in these territories living side by side with Israel (see also history of the State of Palestine). However, the &quot;Road Map&quot; states that in the first phase, Palestinians must end all attacks on Israel, whereas Israel must dismantle all outposts.

The Palestinian Authority believes that the West Bank ought to be a part of their sovereign nation, and that the presence of Israeli military control is a violation of their right to Palestinian Authority rule. The United Nations calls the West Bank and Gaza Strip &quot;Israeli-occupied territories&quot;. The United States State Department also refers to the territories as &quot;occupied&quot;.

In 2005 the United States ambassador to Israel, Daniel C. Kurtzer, expressed U.S. support &quot;for the retention by Israel of major Israeli population centres [in the West Bank] as an outcome of negotiations&quot;, reflecting President Bush&#x27;s statement a year earlier that a permanent peace treaty would have to reflect &quot;demographic realities&quot; on the West Bank. In May 2011 US President Barack Obama officially stated US support for a future Palestinian state based on borders prior to the 1967 War, allowing for land swaps where they are mutually agreeable between the two sides. Obama was the first US president to formally support the policy, but he stated that it had been one long held by the US in its Middle East negotiations.

In December 2016, a resolution was adopted by United Nations Security Council that condemned Israel&#x27;s settlement activity as a &quot;flagrant violation&quot; of international law with &quot;no legal validity&quot;. It demands that Israel stop such activity and fulfill its obligations as an occupying power under the Fourth Geneva Convention. The United States abstained from the vote.

In 2020, President Donald Trump unveiled a peace plan, radically different from previous peace plans. The plan failed to gain support.

West Bank was ranked 10th most electoral democracy in the Middle East and North Africa according to V-Dem Democracy indices in 2024 with a score of 0.254 out of one.
==Public opinion==
Palestinian public opinion opposes Israeli military and settler presence on the West Bank as a violation of their right to statehood and sovereignty. Israeli opinion is split into a number of views:
*Complete or partial withdrawal from the West Bank in hopes of peaceful coexistence in separate states (sometimes called the &quot;land for peace&quot; position); (In a 2003 poll, 76% of Israelis supported a peace agreement based on that principle).
*Maintenance of a military presence in the West Bank to reduce Palestinian terrorism by deterrence or by armed intervention, while relinquishing some degree of political control;
*Annexation of the West Bank while considering the Palestinian population with Palestinian Authority citizenship with Israeli residence permit as per the Elon Peace Plan;
*Annexation of the West Bank and assimilation of the Palestinian population to fully fledged Israeli citizens;
*Transfer of the East Jerusalem Palestinian population (a 2002 poll at the height of the Al-Aqsa Intifada found 46% of Israelis favoring Palestinian transfer of Jerusalem residents).

==Geography==

The West Bank has an area of , which comprises 21.2% of former Mandatory Palestine (excluding Jordan) and has generally rugged mountainous terrain. The total length of the land boundaries of the region are . The terrain is mostly rugged dissected upland, some vegetation in the west, but somewhat barren in the east. The elevation span between the shoreline of the Dead Sea at −408 m to the highest point at Mount Nabi Yunis, at 1,030 m (3,379 ft) above sea level. The West Bank is landlocked; its highlands are the main recharge area for Israel&#x27;s coastal aquifers.

The West Bank has of water area, consisting of the northwestern quarter of the Dead Sea.

There are few natural resources in the area except the highly arable land, which comprises 27% of the land area of the region. It is mostly used as permanent pastures (32% of arable land) and seasonal agricultural uses (40%). Forests and woodland comprise just 1%, with no permanent crops.

===Climate===
The climate in the West Bank is mostly Mediterranean, slightly cooler at elevated areas compared with the shoreline, west to the area. In the east, the West Bank includes the Judean Desert and the shoreline of the Dead Sea – both with dry and hot climate.

In the most highly elevated areas in the northwest, annual rainfall is more than 27 inches (685 mm). This declines in the southwest and southeast to less than 4 inches (100 mm). Hilly terrains are used for sheep grazing and cultivating olives, cereals and fruits. The Jordan River valley is also cultivated for various fruits and vegetables.

===Political geography===

====Palestinian enclaves====
The 1993 Oslo Accords declared the final status of the West Bank to be subject to a forthcoming settlement between Israel and the Palestinian leadership. Following these interim accords, Israel withdrew its military rule from some parts of the West Bank, which was divided into three Areas:
Area A, 2.7%, full civil control of the Palestinian Authority, comprises Palestinian towns, and some rural areas away from Israeli settlements in the north (between Jenin, Nablus, Tubas, and Tulkarm), the south (around Hebron), and one in the center south of Salfit. Area B, 25.2%, adds other populated rural areas, many closer to the center of the West Bank. Area C contains all the Israeli settlements (excluding settlements in East Jerusalem), roads used to access the settlements, buffer zones (near settlements, roads, strategic areas, and Israel), and almost all of the Jordan Valley and the Judean Desert.

Areas A and B are themselves divided among 227 separate areas (199 of which are smaller than ) that are separated from one another by Israeli-controlled Area C.
 Areas A, B, and C cross the 11 governorates used as administrative divisions by the Palestinian National Authority, Israel, and the IDF and named after major cities. The mainly open areas of Area C, which contains all of the basic resources of arable and building land, water springs, quarries and sites of touristic value needed to develop a viable Palestinian state, were to be handed over to the Palestinians by 1999 under the Oslo Accords as part of a final status agreement. This agreement was never achieved.

According to B&#x27;tselem, while the vast majority of the Palestinian population lives in areas A and B, the vacant land available for construction in dozens of villages and towns across the West Bank is situated on the margins of the communities and defined as area C. Less than 1% of area C is designated for use by Palestinians, who are also unable to legally build in their own existing villages in area C due to Israeli authorities&#x27; restrictions,

An assessment by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in 2007 found that approximately 40% of the West Bank was taken up by Israeli infrastructure. The infrastructure, consisting of settlements, the barrier, military bases and closed military areas, Israeli declared nature reserves and the roads that accompany them is off-limits or tightly controlled to Palestinians.

In June 2011, the Independent Commission for Human Rights published a report that found that Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were subjected in 2010 to an &quot;almost systematic campaign&quot; of human rights abuse by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, as well as by Israeli authorities, with the security forces of the PA and Hamas being responsible for torture, arrests and arbitrary detentions.

====Area annexed by Israel====

Through the Jerusalem Law, Israel extended its administrative control over East Jerusalem. This has often been interpreted as tantamount to an official annexation, though Ian Lustick, in reviewing the legal status of Israeli measures, has argued that no such annexation ever took place. The Palestinian residents have legal permanent residency status. Rejecting the Jerusalem Law, the UN Security Council passed UN Security Council Resolution 478, declaring that the law was &quot;null and void&quot;. Although permanent residents are permitted, if they wish, to receive Israeli citizenship if they meet certain conditions including swearing allegiance to the State and renouncing any other citizenship, most Palestinians did not apply for Israeli citizenship for political reasons. There are various possible reasons as to why the West Bank had not been annexed to Israel after its capture in 1967. The government of Israel has not formally confirmed an official reason; however, historians and analysts have established a variety of such, most of them demographic. Among those most commonly cited have been:
*Reluctance to award its citizenship to an overwhelming number of a potentially hostile population whose allies were sworn to the destruction of Israel.
*To ultimately exchange land for peace with neighbouring states
*Fear that the population of ethnic Arabs, including Israeli citizens of Palestinian ethnicity, would outnumber the Jewish Israelis west of the Jordan River.
*The disputed legality of annexation under the Fourth Geneva Convention
The importance of demographic concerns to some significant figures in Israel&#x27;s leadership was illustrated when Avraham Burg, a former Knesset Speaker and former chair of the Jewish Agency for Israel, wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in September 2003,
:&quot;Between the Jordan and the Mediterranean there is no longer a clear Jewish majority. And so, fellow citizens, it is not possible to keep the whole thing without paying a price. We cannot keep a Palestinian majority under an Israeli boot and at the same time think ourselves the only democracy in the Middle East. There cannot be democracy without equal rights for all who live here, Arab as well as Jew. We cannot keep the territories and preserve a Jewish majority in the world&#x27;s only Jewish state – not by means that are humane and moral and Jewish.&quot;

====Area C and Israeli settlements====

As of 2022, there are over 450,000 Israeli settlers living in 132 Israeli settlements in the West Bank excluding East Jerusalem, with an additional 220,000 Jewish settlers residing in 12 settlements in East Jerusalem. In addition, there are over 140 Israeli outposts in the West Bank that are not recognized and are therefore illegal even under Israeli law, but which have nevertheless been provided with infrastructure, water, sewage, and other services by the authorities. They are colloquially known as &quot;illegal outposts&quot;.

As a result of the application of Israeli law in the settlements (&quot;Enclave law&quot;), large portions of Israeli civil law are applied to Israeli settlements and to Israelis living in the Israeli-occupied territories.

The international consensus is that all Israeli settlements on the West Bank are illegal under international law. In 2002, the European Union as a whole found all Israeli settlement activities to be illegal. Significant portions of the Israeli public similarly oppose the continuing presence of Jewish Israelis in the West Bank and have supported the 2005 settlement relocation. The majority of legal scholars also hold the settlements to violate international law, however individuals including Julius Stone, and Eugene Rostow have argued that they are legal under international law.

Immediately after the 1967 war, Theodor Meron, legal counselor of Israel&#x27;s Foreign Ministry, advised Israeli ministers in a &quot;top secret&quot; memo that any policy of building settlements across occupied territories violated international law and would &quot;contravene the explicit provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention&quot;. Fifty years later, citing decades of legal scholarship on the subject, Meron reiterated his legal opinion regarding the illegality of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories.

The UN Security Council has issued several non-binding resolutions addressing the issue of the settlements. Typical of these is UN Security Council resolution 446 which states that the &quot;practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity&quot;, and it calls on Israel &quot;as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention&quot;&quot;.&quot;

The Conference of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention held in Geneva on 5 December 2001 called upon &quot;the Occupying Power to fully and effectively respect the Fourth Geneva Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to refrain from perpetrating any violation of the Convention.&quot; The High Contracting Parties reaffirmed &quot;the illegality of the settlements in the said territories and of the extension thereof.&quot;

On 30 December 2007, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert issued an order requiring approval by both the Israeli Prime Minister and Israeli Defense Minister of all settlement activities (including planning) in the West Bank. The change had little effect with settlements continuing to expand, and new ones being established. On 31 August 2014, Israel announced it was appropriating 400 hectares of land in the West Bank to eventually house 1,000 Israel families. The appropriation was described as the largest in more than 30 years. According to reports on Israel Radio, the development is a response to the 2014 kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers.

====Palestinian outposts====

The Haaretz newspaper published an article in December 2005 about demolition of &quot;Palestinian outposts&quot; in Bil&#x27;in. The demolitions sparked a political debate as according to &quot;PeaceNow&quot; it was a double standard (&quot;After what happened today in Bil&#x27;in, there is no reason that the state should defend its decision to continue the construction&quot; credited to Michael Sfard).

In January 2012, the European Union approved the &quot;Area C and Palestinian state building&quot; report. The report said Palestinian presence in Area C has been continuously undermined by Israel and that state building efforts in Area C of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the EU were of &quot;utmost importance in order to support the creation of a contiguous and viable Palestinian state&quot;. The EU will support various projects to &quot;support the Palestinian people and help maintain their presence&quot;.

In May 2012, a petition was filed to the Israeli Supreme Court about the legality of more 15 Palestinian outposts and Palestinian building in &quot;Area C&quot;. The cases were filed by Regavim.

The petition was one of 30 different petitions with the common ground of illegal land takeover and illegal construction and use of natural resources. Some of the petitions (27) had been set for trials and the majority received a verdict.

&quot;Ynet News&quot; stated on 11 January 2013 that a group of 200 Palestinians with unknown number of foreign activists created an outpost named Bab al-Shams (&quot;Gate of the Sun&quot;), contains 50 tents

&quot;Ynet News&quot; stated on 18 January 2013 that Palestinian activists built an outpost on a disputed area in Beit Iksa, where Israel plans to construct part of the separation fence in the Jerusalem vicinity while the Palestinians claim that the area belongs to the residents of Beit Iksa. named Bab al-Krama

====West Bank barrier====

The Israeli West Bank barrier is a physical barrier ordered for construction by the Israeli Government, consisting of a network of fences with vehicle-barrier trenches. Israel began building the barrier on 23 June 2002, two years into the Second Intifada. It is surrounded by an on average wide exclusion area (90%) and up to high concrete walls (10%), although in most areas the wall is not nearly that high. It is located mainly within the West Bank, partly along the 1949 Armistice line, or &quot;Green Line&quot; between the West Bank and Israel. The length of the barrier as approved by the Israeli government is long. As of 2020, approximately have been constructed (64%). The space between the barrier and the green line is a closed military zone known as the Seam Zone, cutting off 9% of the West Bank and encompassing dozens of villages and tens of thousands of Palestinians.

The barrier generally runs along or near the 1949 Jordanian-Israeli armistice/Green Line, but diverges in many places to include on the Israeli side several of the highly populated areas of Jewish settlements in the West Bank such as East Jerusalem, Ariel, Gush Etzion, Immanuel, Karnei Shomron, Givat Ze&#x27;ev, Oranit, and Maale Adumim.

Supporters of the barrier stated it was necessary for protecting Israeli civilians from Palestinian attacks, which increased significantly during the Al-Aqsa Intifada; it has helped reduce incidents of terrorism by 90% from 2002 to 2005; over a 96% reduction in terror attacks in the six years ending in 2007, though Israel&#x27;s State Comptroller has acknowledged that most of the suicide bombers crossed into Israel through existing checkpoints. Its supporters state that the onus is now on the Palestinian Authority to fight terrorism.

Opponents state the barrier is an illegal attempt to annex Palestinian land under the guise of security, violates international law, has the intent or effect to pre-empt final status negotiations, and severely restricts Palestinian livelihoods, particularly limiting their freedom of movement within and from the West Bank thereby undermining their economy.

=====Palestinian governorates=====
After the signing of the Oslo Accords, the West Bank was divided into 11 governorates under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority. Since 2007 there are two governments claiming to be the legitimate government of the Palestinian National Authority, one based in the West Bank and one based in the Gaza Strip.
===== Israeli administrative districts =====

The West Bank is further divided into 8 administrative regions: Menashe (Jenin area), HaBik&#x27;a (Jordan Valley), Shomron (Shechem area, known in Arabic as Nablus), Efrayim (Tulkarm area), Binyamin (Ramallah/al-Bireh area), Maccabim (Maccabim area), Etzion (Bethlehem area) and Yehuda (Hebron area).

==Crossing points to Jordan and Egypt==
Allenby Bridge, or &#x27;King Hussein Bridge&#x27;, is the main port for the Palestinians in the West Bank to cross the Jordanian borders. This crossing point is controlled by Israel since 1967. It was inaugurated on 11 December 2011 under the military order &quot;175&quot; entitled &#x27;An order concerning transition station&#x27;. Later, Order &#x27;446&#x27; was issued which annexed the Damia Bridge crossing point to the Allenby Bridge as a commercial crossing point only. Goods were exported to Jordan, while the import was banned for security purposes.

In 1993, the Palestinian National Authority, according to Oslo Accord assigned by PLO and the Israeli government, became a partial supervisor over the Rafah Border Crossing to Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Authority was responsible for issuing passports to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel remained the major responsible party for this crossing point. According to the agreement, Israel has the right to independently inspect luggage and to maintain security. In addition, it can prevent anyone from using the crossing.

==Economy==

As of the early-21st century, the economy of the Palestinian territories is chronically depressed, with unemployment rates constantly over 20% since 2000. The unemployment rate was 19% in the West Bank in first half of 2013.

==Consequences of occupation==

===Economic consequences===
According to a 2013 World Bank report, Israeli restrictions hinder Palestinian economic development in Area C of the West Bank. A 2013 World Bank report calculates that, if the Interim Agreement was respected and restrictions lifted, a few key industries alone would produce US$2.2 billion per annum more (or 23% of 2011 Palestinian GDP) and reduce by some US$800 million (50%) the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s deficit; the employment would increase by 35%.

===Water supply===

Amnesty International has criticized the way that the Israeli state is dealing with the regional water resources:

Israeli settlers in the West Bank have seized dozens of wells from Palestinians. The wells are privately owned by Palestinians and the settlers forcibly took them, gave them Hebrew names and, with the assistance of the Israeli military, prevent Arab people, including the wells&#x27; owners, from using the wells and the pools the wells feed.

===Israeli garbage disposal===
Israel ratified the international Basel Convention treaty on Israel on 14 December 1994, according to which, any transfer of waste must be performed with an awareness of the dangers posed to the disempowered occupied people. It forbids the creation among them of &quot;environmental sacrifice zones.&quot; Israel, it is argued, uses the West Bank as a &quot;sacrifice&quot; zone by placing 15 waste treatment plants, which are there under less stringent rules that those required in Israel because a different legal system has been organized regarding hazardous materials that can be noxious to local people and the environment. The military authorities do not make public the details of these operations. These materials include sewage sludge, infectious medical waste, used oils, solvents, metals, electronic waste and batteries.

In 2007 it was estimated that 38% (35 mcm a year) of all wastewater flowing into the West Bank derived from settlements and Jerusalem. Of the 121 settlements surveyed, 81 had wastewater treatment plant, much of it inadequate or subject to breakdown, with much sewage flowing into lowland streams and terrain where Palestinian villages are located. Only 4 of 53 indictments for waste pollution were made over the years from 2000 to 2008, whereas in Israel the laws are strictly applied and, in 2006 alone, 230 enforcements for the same abuse were enforced. At the same time 90–95% of Palestinian wastewater was not treated, with only 1 of 4 Israeli plants built in the 1970s to that purpose functioning, and the neglect to improve the infrastructure is attributed to Israeli budgetary problems.

After the Oslo Accords, the global community earmarked $250,000,000 for West Bank wastewater infrastructure. Israel at times insisted its approval was conditional on linking the grid to Israeli settlements, which neither the donors nor Palestinians accepted. Most of the infrastructure was subsequently destroyed by IDF military operations. The PA raised funds from Germany for 15 plants, but only managed to build one, at al-Bireh, within Area B, though even there Israel insisted the plant process waste from the settlement of Psagot, though refusing to pay fees for the treatment. Palestinian town Salfit has been deeply affected by sewage overflow channelled past the town from the settlement of Ariel.

Unlike the data available for sewage treatment within Israel, the Israeli Water Commission refuses to provide public reports on 15 million cubic metres of sewage flowing from Israeli settlements in the West Bank. It claims 75% is treated adequately but independent Israeli studies (2000) suggest that only 6% met Israeli treatment standards, while 48% was either not treated adequastely or discharged raw. Since then some improvements have been implemented.

The landfill near Al-Jiftlik in the Jericho Governorate, built on absentee Palestinian property without planning or an environment impact analysis, is for the exclusive use of waste, 1,000 tons per day, produced by Israeli settlements and cities within Israel. Palestinians are restricted to 3 landfills, and permits for more have been denied unless the sites can be used to dump settlement garbage. Even if a permit is given without this agreement, settler waste under military escort is still dumped there.

Israel has been accused of engaging in &#x27;warfare ecology&#x27; in the West Bank. In response to local opposition in Israel to waste treatment plants and the high cost of meeting stringent environment laws in that country. It has been argued that Israel had used the area of the West Bank as a &#x27;sacrifice zone&#x27; where its waste can be dumped.&quot;

Many waste treatment facilities in the West Bank were built for processing waste generated inside Israeli sovereign territory, according to B&#x27;Tselem, Israel&#x27;s leading human rights organization for monitoring the West Bank.

The Israel government requires no reporting by these West Bank facilities of the amount of waste they process or the risks they pose to the local population, and applies less rigorous regulatory standards to these facilities than it does to solid waste treatment facilities in Israel. B&#x27;Tselem has said that &quot;any transfer of waste to the West Bank is a breach of international law which Israel is dutybound to uphold&quot; because according to international law &quot;an occupied territory or its resources may not be used for the benefit of the occupying power&#x27;s own needs.&quot; Experts have also warned that some of these facilities are garbage dumps that endanger the purity of the mountain aquifer, which is one of the largest sources of water in the region.

===Palestinian water and sewage===

In 1995, the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) was established by a presidential decree. One year later, its functions, objectives and responsibilities were defined through a by-law, giving the PWA the mandate to manage water resources and execute the water policy.

About 90% of the Palestinians in the Territories had access to improved sanitation in 2008. Cesspits were used by 39% of households, while access to the sewer network increased to 55% in 2011, up from 39% in 1999. In the West Bank, only 13,000 out of 85,000 m3 of wastewater were treated in five municipal wastewater treatment plants in Hebron, Jenin, Ramallah, Tulkarem and Al-Bireh. The Al Bireh plant was constructed in 2000 with funding by the German aid agency KfW. According to the World Bank report, the other four plants perform poorly concerning efficiency and quality.

===Resource extraction===
Based on the number of quarries per km2 in Areas A and B, it is calculated that, were Israel to lift restrictions, a further 275 quarries could be opened in Area C. The World Bank estimates that Israel&#x27;s virtual ban on issuing Palestinians permits for quarries there costs the Palestinian economy at least US$241 million per year.
In international law drawing on the Hague Conventions (Article 55), it is established that an occupying power may reap some value from the resources of the country occupied but not deplete its assets, and that the usufruct must benefit the people under occupation. The Oslo Accords agreed to hand over mining rights to the Palestinian Authority. Israel licenses eleven settlement quarries in the West Bank and they sell 94% of their material to Israel, which arguably constitutes &quot;depletion&quot; and pays royalties to its West Bank military government and settlement municipalities.

Thus the German cement firm quarrying at Nahal Raba paid out €430,000 ($479,000) in taxes to the Samaria Regional Council in 2014 alone. The Israeli High Court rejected a petition that such quarrying was a violation by stating that after four decades Israeli law must adapt to &quot;the realities on the ground&quot;. The state did undertake not to open more quarries.

A Human Rights Watch report contrasts the difference between a Palestinian-owned quarry company in Beit Fajar and that of a European one working on what Israeli considers its state land. The European company obtained a concession and license to harvest stone, whereas Israel refuses permits for most of the roughly 40 Beit Fajar quarries, or nearly any other Palestinian-owned quarry in the West Bank under Israeli administration.

Israel had denied Palestinians permits to process minerals in that area of the West Bank. The products of the Israeli cosmetics firm Ahava, established in 1988, were developed in laboratories at the West Bank Dead Sea settlements of Mitzpe Shalem and Kalya. 60% of their production is sold in the EU market. In 2018 The UN, stating that the violations were both &quot;pervasive and devastating&quot; to the local Palestinian population, identified some 206 companies which do business with Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

Roughly 73 percent of global bromine production comes from Israeli and Jordanian exploitation of the Dead Sea. The potential incremental value that could accrue to the Palestinian economy from the production and sales of potash, bromine and magnesium has been conservatively estimated at US$918 million per annum, or 9 percent of GDP. The lost earnings from not being allowed to process Dead Sea minerals such as potash, and for making bromide-based flame retardants, based on calculations of comparable use by Israel and Jordan, suggest a figure of $642 million.

===Loss of cultural property===
Albert Glock argued that Israel is responsible for the disappearance of significant parts of the Palestinian cultural patrimony, by confiscating Arab cultural resources. In 1967 it appropriated the Palestine Archaeological Museum and its library in East Jerusalem. Often these losses are personal, as when homes are ransacked and looted of their valuables. The journalist Hamdi Faraj, jailed for endangering public order, had his 500-volume library confiscated, including copies of the Bible and Qur&#x27;an and, when he applied for their restitution, was told all the books had been accidentally burnt.
The Israeli occupation has wrought a profound change in Palestinian identity, which clings to a sense of a &quot;paradise lost&quot; before the changes brought out by the 1967 conquest.

===Tourism===

The Palestinian territories contain several of the most significant sites for Muslims, Christians and Jews, and are endowed with a world-class heritage highly attractive to tourists and pilgrims. The West Bank Palestinians themselves have difficulties in accessing the territory for recreation.

Based on 1967 figures, the Palestinian Dead Sea Coastline is roughly 40 km in length, of which 15% (6 kilometres) could lend itself to the same tourist infrastructure developed by Jordan and Israel in their respective areas. Were Israel to permit a parallel development of this Palestinian sector, the World Bank estimates that 2,900 jobs would be added, allowing the Palestinian economy a potential value-added input of something like $126 million annually. It is also the only maritime recreational outlet for West Bankers, but according to an Acri complaint to the Israeli Supreme Court in 2008 Palestinians are often barred or turned away from the beaches at their only access point, the Beit Ha&#x27;arava checkpoint on Route 90. Acri claimed the ban responds to fears by settlers who operate tourist concessions in this West Bank area that they will lose Jewish customers if there are too many West Bank Palestinians on the beaches.

The key Palestinian towns in the West Bank for tourism are East Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Jericho. All access points are controlled by Israel and the road system, checkpoints and obstacles in place for visitors desiring to visit Palestinian towns leaves their hotels half-empty. From 92 to 94 cents in every dollar of the tourist trade goes to Israel. The general itineraries under Israeli management focus predominantly on Jewish history. Obstacles placed in the way of Palestinian-managed tourism down to 1995 included withholding licenses from tour guides, and hotels, for construction or renovation, and control of airports and highways, enabling Israel to develop a virtual monopoly on tourism.

==Demographics==
In December 2007, an official census conducted by the Palestinian Authority found that the Palestinian Arab population of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, was 2,345,000. However, the World Bank and American-Israeli Demographic Research Group identified a 32% discrepancy between first-grade enrollment statistics documented by the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS)&#x27; 2007 projections, with questions also raised about the PCBS&#x27; growth assumptions for the period 1997–2003. The Israeli Civil Administration put the number of Palestinians in the West Bank at 2,657,029 as of May 2012.

In 2014, there were 389,250 Israeli settlers living in the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem, as well as around 375,000 living in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem. There are also small ethnic groups, such as the Samaritans living in and around Nablus, numbering in the hundreds.

As of October 2007, around 23,000 Palestinians in the West Bank worked in Israel every day, while another 9,200 worked in Israeli settlements. In addition, around 10,000 Palestinian traders from the West Bank were allowed to travel every day into Israel. By 2014, 92,000 Palestinians worked in Israel legally or illegally, twice as many as in 2010.

In 2008, approximately 30% of Palestinians or 754,263 persons living in the West Bank were refugees or descendants of refugees from villages and towns located in what became Israel during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, according to UNRWA statistics. A 2011 EU report titled &quot;Area C and Palestinian State Building&quot; reported that before the Israeli occupation in 1967, between 200,000 and 320,000 Palestinians used to live in the Jordan Valley, 90% which is in Area C, but demolition of Palestinian homes and prevention of new buildings has seen the number drop to 56,000, 70% of which live in Area A, in Jericho. In a similar period, the Jewish population in Area C has grown from 1,200 to 310,000.

===Major population centers===

The most densely populated part of the region is a mountainous spine, running north–south, where the cities of Jerusalem, Nablus, Ramallah, al-Bireh, Jenin, Bethlehem, Hebron and Yattah are located as well as the Israeli settlements of Ariel, Ma&#x27;ale Adumim and Beitar Illit. Ramallah, although relatively mid in population compared to other major cities as Hebron, Nablus and Jenin, serves as an economic and political center for the Palestinians. Near Ramallah the new city of Rawabi is under construction. Jenin in the extreme north and is the capital of north of the West Bank and is on the southern edge of the Jezreel Valley. Modi&#x27;in Illit, Qalqilyah and Tulkarm are in the low foothills adjacent to the Israeli Coastal Plain, and Jericho and Tubas are situated in the Jordan Valley, north of the Dead Sea.

===Religion===

The population of the West Bank is 80–85% Muslim (mostly Sunni) and 12–14% Jewish. The remainder are 1–2.5% Christian (mostly Greek Orthodox), and others.

==Transportation and communications==

===Road system===
In 2010, the West Bank and Gaza Strip together had of roadways.

It has been said that for &quot;Jewish settlers, roads &quot;connect&quot;; for Palestinians, they &quot;separate&quot;.&quot; Between 1994 and 1997, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) built of bypass roads in the territories, on appropriated land because they ran close to Palestinian villages. The given aim was said to be to afford protection to settlers from Palestinian sniping, bombing, and drive-by shootings. For TAU emeritus professor of geography Elisha Efrat, they ignored the historical topography, road systems and environmental characteristics of the West Bank, and simply formed an apartheid network of &quot;octopus arms which hold a grip on Palestinian population centres&quot;.

A large number of embankments, concrete slabs and barriers impeded movement on primary and secondary roads. The result was to cantonize and fragment Palestinian townships, and cause endless obstacles to Palestinians going to work, schools, markets and relatives. Ramallah was cut off from all of its feeder villages in 2000.

Though prohibited by law, confiscation of Palestinian identity cards at checkpoints is a daily occurrence. At best drivers must wait for several hours for them to be returned, when, as can happen, the IDs themselves are lost as soldiers change shifts, in which case Palestinians are directed to some regional office the next day, and more checkpoints to get there. Even before the Al Aqsa Intifada, UNFPA estimated that 20% of pregnant West Bank women were unable to access prenatal care because of the difficulties and delays caused by crossing checkpoints, and dozens were forced to deliver their children on the roadside.

Constant uncertainty and the inability to plan are the results for Palestinians of the Israeli military rules governing their movements. The World Bank noted that additional costs arising from longer travelling caused by restrictions on movement through three major routes in the West Bank alone ran to (2013) USD 185 million a year, adding that other, earlier calculations (2007) suggest restrictions on the Palestinian labour market cost the West Bank approximately US$229 million per annum. It concluded that such imposed restrictions had a major negative impact on the local economy, hindering stability and growth. In 2007, official Israeli statistics indicated that there were 180,000 Palestinians on Israel&#x27;s secret travel ban list. 561 roadblocks and checkpoints were in place (October), the number of Palestinians licensed to drive private cars was 46,166 and the annual cost of permits was $454.

These checkpoints, together with the separation wall and the restricted networks restructure the West Bank into &quot;land cells&quot;, freezing the flow of normal everyday Palestinian lives. Israel sets up flying checkpoints without notice. In 2017, 2,941 flying checkpoints were set up along West Bank roads, around 327 a month. There were 476 unstaffed physical obstacles (dirt mounds, concrete blocks, gates and fenced sections) on roads. Of the gates erected at village entrances, 59 were always closed.

The checkpoint system did not ease up after the Oslo Accords, but was strengthened after them, which has been interpreted as suggesting their function is to assert control over Palestinians, and as a sign of an unwillingness to yield ground in the West Bank. According to PA Health Ministry statistics relating to the period from 2000 to 2006, of 68 Palestinian women who gave birth to their children while held up at checkpoints, 35 miscarried and 5 died while delivering their child there. Machsom Watch accumulated over a mere five years (2001–2006) some 10,000 eyewitness reports and testimonies regarding the difficulties faced by Palestinians trying to negotiate West Bank checkpoints.

Transportation infrastructure is particularly problematic as Palestinian use of roads in Area C is highly restricted, and travel times can be inordinate; the Palestinian Authority has also been unable to develop roads, airports or railways in or through Area C, while many other roads were restricted only to public transportation and to Palestinians who have special permits from Israeli authorities.

At certain times, Israel maintained more than 600 checkpoints or roadblocks in the region.
Movement restrictions on main roads between cities were still (as of 2005) blamed for poverty and economic depression in the West Bank. Underpasses and bridges, 28 of which have been constructed and 16 of which are planned, link Palestinian areas separated from each other by Israeli settlements and bypass roads&quot;
Israeli restrictions were tightened in 2007.

Route 4370, which has a concrete wall dividing the two sides, one designated for Israeli vehicles, the other for Palestinian. The wall is designed to allow Palestinians to pass north–south through Israeli-held land and facilitate the building of additional Jewish settlements in the Jerusalem neighborhood.

===Rail===
, a plan for 475-kilometer rail network, establishing 11 new rail lines in West Bank, was confirmed by Israeli Transportation Ministry. The West Bank network would include one line running through Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah, Jerusalem, Ma&#x27;aleh Adumim, Bethlehem and Hebron. Another would provide service along the Jordanian border from Eilat to the Dead Sea, Jericho and Beit She&#x27;an and from there toward Haifa in the west and in also in a northeasterly direction. The proposed scheme also calls for shorter routes, such as between Nablus and Tul Karm in the West Bank, and from Ramallah to the Allenby Bridge crossing into Jordan.

===Airports===
The only airport in the West Bank is the Atarot Airport near Ramallah, but it has been closed since 2001.

===Telecom===

The Palestinian Paltel telecommunication companies provide communication services such as landline, cellular network and Internet in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Dialling code +970 is used in the West Bank and all over the Palestinian territories. Until 2007, the Palestinian mobile market was monopolized by Jawwal. A new mobile operator for the territories launched in 2009 under the name of Wataniya Telecom. The number of Internet users increased from 35,000 in 2000 to 356,000 in 2010.

===Radio and television===
The Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts from an AM station in Ramallah on 675 kHz; numerous local privately owned stations are also in operation. Most Palestinian households have a radio and TV, and satellite dishes for receiving international coverage are widespread. Recently, PalTel announced and has begun implementing an initiative to provide ADSL broadband internet service to all households and businesses.

Israel&#x27;s cable television company HOT, satellite television provider (DBS) Yes, AM and FM radio broadcast stations and public television broadcast stations all operate. Broadband internet service by Bezeq&#x27;s ADSL and by the cable company is available as well. The Al-Aqsa Voice broadcasts from Dabas Mall in Tulkarem at 106.7 FM. The Al-Aqsa TV station shares these offices.

==Education==

Seven universities are operating in the West Bank:
*Bethlehem University, a Roman Catholic institution of the Lasallian tradition partially funded by the Vatican, opened its doors in 1973.
*In 1975, Birzeit College (located in the town of Bir Zeit north of Ramallah) became Birzeit University after adding third- and fourth-year college-level programs.
*An-Najah College in Nablus likewise became An-Najah National University in 1977.
*Hebron University was established as College of Shari&#x27;a in 1971 and became Hebron University in 1980.
*Al-Quds University was founded in 1995, unifying several colleges and faculties in and around East Jerusalem.
*In 2000, the Arab American University – the only private university in the West Bank – was founded outside of Zababdeh, with the purpose of providing courses according to the American system of education.
*Ariel University is located in the Israeli settlement of Ariel and was granted full university status on 17 July 2012. It was established in 1982.

Most universities in the West Bank have politically active student bodies, and elections of student council officers are normally along party affiliations. Although the establishment of the universities was initially allowed by the Israeli authorities, some were sporadically ordered closed by the Israeli Civil Administration during the 1970s and 1980s to prevent political activities and violence against the IDF. Some universities remained closed by military order for extended periods during years immediately preceding and following the first Palestinian Intifada, but have largely remained open since the signing of the Oslo Accords despite the advent of the Al-Aqsa Intifada (Second Intifada) in 2000.

The founding of Palestinian universities has greatly increased education levels among the population in the West Bank. According to a Birzeit University study, the percentage of Palestinians choosing local universities as opposed to foreign institutions has been steadily increasing; as of 1997, 41% of Palestinians with bachelor&#x27;s degrees had obtained them from Palestinian institutions. According to UNESCO, Palestinians are one of the most highly educated groups in the Middle East &quot;despite often difficult circumstances&quot;. The literacy rate among Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) is 94.6% for 2009.

<text>Western Sahara is a disputed territory in North-western Africa. It has a surface area of . Approximately 30% of the territory () is controlled by the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR); the remaining 70% is occupied and administered by neighboring Morocco. It is the most sparsely populated territory in Africa and the second most sparsely populated territory in the world, mainly consisting of desert flatlands. The population is estimated at 618,600. Nearly 40% of that population lives in Morocco-controlled Laayoune, the largest city of Western Sahara.

Previously occupied by Spain as the Spanish Sahara until 1975, Western Sahara has been on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories since 1963 after a Moroccan demand. In 1965, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on Western Sahara, asking Spain to decolonize the territory. A year later, resolution 2229 (XXI) was passed by the UN General Assembly requesting that a referendum be held by Spain on self-determination. In 1975, Spain relinquished administrative control of the territory to a joint administration by Morocco and Mauritania. A war erupted between those countries and a Sahrawi nationalist movement, the Polisario Front, which proclaimed itself the rightful leadership of the SADR with a government-in-exile in Tindouf, Algeria. Mauritania withdrew its claims in 1979, and Morocco secured &quot;de facto&quot; control of most of the territory, including all major cities and most natural resources. The UN considers the Polisario Front the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people, and maintains the Sahrawis have a right to self-determination. Western Sahara is the last African colonial state yet to achieve independence and has been dubbed &quot;Africa&#x27;s last colony&quot;.

Since a UN-sponsored ceasefire agreement in 1991, most of the territory has been administered by the Moroccan government, with tacit support from France and the United States. The remainder is administered by the SADR, backed by Algeria. The only part of the coast in SADR territory is the extreme south. Internationally, countries such as Russia have taken an ambiguous and neutral position on each side&#x27;s claims and pressed parties to agree on a peaceful resolution. Morocco and Polisario have sought to boost their claims by accumulating formal recognition, especially from African, Asian, and Latin American states in the developing world. The Polisario Front has won formal recognition for the SADR from 46 UN member states and South Ossetia, and was extended membership of the African Union. Morocco has won support from several African governments and most of the Muslim world and Arab League. In most instances, recognitions are extended or withdrawn due to a change in relations with Morocco. Until 2020, no other member state of the UN had ever recognized Moroccan sovereignty over parts of Western Sahara. In 2020, the US recognized Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara in exchange for Moroccan normalization of relations with Israel. In 2023, Israel recognized Moroccan sovereignty. 

In 1984, the African Union&#x27;s predecessor, the Organisation of African Unity, recognized the SADR as one of its full members, with the same status as Morocco, and Morocco protested by suspending its membership of the OAU. Morocco was readmitted to the Union in 2017, after promising conflicting claims would be resolved peacefully and it would stop building walls to extend its military control. Meanwhile, the African Union has not issued any formal statement about the border separating the sovereign territories of Morocco and the SADR. Instead, the African Union works with the UN mission to maintain the ceasefire and reach a peace agreement. The African Union provides a peacekeeping contingent to the UN mission which is used to control a buffer zone near the &quot;de facto&quot; border walls built by Morocco.

== Geography ==


Western Sahara is located on the north-west coast in West Africa and on the cusp of North Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean to the northwest, Morocco proper to the north-northeast, Algeria to the east-northeast, and Mauritania to the east and south.

Among the most arid and inhospitable on the planet, the land along the coast is low flat desert and rises, especially in the north, to small mountains reaching up to on the eastern side.

While the area can experience flash flooding in the spring, there are no permanent streams. At times, a cool off-shore current can produce fog and heavy dew.

The interior experiences extreme summer heat, with average highs reaching in July and in August; during winter, days are still hot to very hot, with average highs from ; however, in the northern part of the territory, the thermometer may drop below at night and it can be freezing in December and in January, although this is rare.

Western Sahara contains four terrestrial ecoregions: Saharan halophytics, Mediterranean acacia-argania dry woodlands and succulent thickets, Atlantic coastal desert, and North Saharan steppe and woodlands.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

The earliest known inhabitants of Western Sahara were the Gaetuli. Depending on the century, Roman-era sources describe the area as inhabited by Gaetulian Autololes or the Gaetulian Daradae tribes. Berber heritage is still evident from regional and place-name toponymy, as well as from tribal names.

Other early inhabitants of Western Sahara may be the Bafour and later the Serer. The Bafour were later replaced or absorbed by Berber-speaking populations, which eventually merged in turn with the migrating Beni Ḥassān Arab tribes.

The arrival of Islam in the 8th century played a major role in the development of the Maghreb region. Trade developed further, and the territory may have been one of the routes for caravans, especially between Marrakesh and Tombouctou in Mali.

In the 11th century, the Maqil Arabs (fewer than 200 individuals) settled in Morocco (mainly in the Draa River valley, between the Moulouya River, Tafilalt and Taourirt). Towards the end of the Almohad Caliphate, the Beni Hassan, a sub-tribe of the Maqil, were called by the local ruler of the Sous to quell a rebellion; they settled in the Sous Ksours and controlled such cities as Taroudant. During Marinid dynasty rule, the Beni Hassan rebelled but were defeated by the Sultan and escaped beyond the Saguia el-Hamra dry river. The Beni Hassan then were at constant war with the Lamtuna nomadic Berbers of the Sahara. Over roughly five centuries, through a complex process of acculturation and mixing seen elsewhere in the Maghreb and North Africa, some of the indigenous Berber tribes mixed with the Maqil Arab tribes and formed a culture unique to Morocco and Mauritania.

=== Spanish province ===

The Spanish presence in the region of modern-day Western Sahara lasted from 1884 to 1975. While initial Spanish interest in the Sahara was focused on using it as a port for the slave trade, by the 1700s Spain had transitioned economic activity on the Saharan coast towards commercial fishing. By the 19th century, Spain had claimed the southern coastal region and penetration of the hinterland gradually followed; later in 1904 the northern region was acquired. After an agreement among the European colonial powers at the Berlin Conference in 1884 on the division of spheres of influence in Africa, the same year Spain seized control of Western Sahara and established it as a Spanish colony. Despite establishing their first colony in the region at Río de Oro Bay in 1884, the Spanish were unable to pacify the interior of the region until the 1930s. Raids and rebellions by the indigenous Saharan population kept the Spanish forces out of much of the territory for a long time. The territory was eventually subdued by joint Spanish and French forces in 1934, the same year the Spaniards divided their Saharan territories into two regions named after the rivers: Saguía el-Hamra and Río de Oro. After 1939 and the outbreak of World War II, this area was administered by Spanish Morocco. In 1958, Spain joined the district of Saguia el-Hamra (the &quot;Red River&quot;) in the north with the Río de Oro (in the south) to form the province of Spanish Sahara, following Morocco&#x27;s claiming these regions in 1957. As a consequence, Ahmed Belbachir Haskouri, the Chief of Cabinet, General Secretary of the Government of Spanish Morocco, cooperated with the Spanish to select governors in that area. The Saharan lords who were already in prominent positions, such as the members of Maa El Ainain family, provided a recommended list of candidates for new governors. Together with the Spanish High Commissioner, Belbachir selected from this list. During the annual celebration of Muhammad&#x27;s birthday, these lords paid their respects to the caliph to show loyalty to the Moroccan monarchy.As time went by, Spanish colonial rule began to unravel with the general wave of decolonization after World War II; former North African and sub-Saharan African possessions and protectorates gained independence from European powers. Spanish decolonization proceeded more slowly, but internal political and social pressures for it in mainland Spain built up towards the end of Francisco Franco&#x27;s rule. There was a global trend towards complete decolonization. Spain abandoned most territories within neighboring Morocco in 1956, but resisted encroachment by the Moroccan Liberation Army within Ifni and Spanish Sahara from 1956 to 1958. In 1971, Sahrawi (an Arabic term for those from Sahara) students in Moroccan universities began organizing what came to be known as The Embryonic Movement for the Liberation of Saguía el Hamra and Río de Oro. The movement tried without success to gain backing from several Arab governments, including Algeria and Morocco. Spain began rapidly to divest itself of most of its remaining colonial possessions. By 1974–75 the government issued promises of a referendum on independence in Western Sahara.

At the same time, Morocco and Mauritania, which had historical and competing claims of sovereignty over the territory, argued that it had been artificially separated from their territories by the European colonial powers. Algeria, which also bordered the territory, viewed their demands with suspicion, as Morocco also claimed the Algerian provinces of Tindouf and Béchar. After arguing for a process of decolonization to be guided by the United Nations, the Algerian government under Houari Boumédiènne in 1975 committed to assisting the Polisario Front, which opposed both Moroccan and Mauritanian claims and demanded full independence of Western Sahara.

The UN attempted to settle these disputes through a visiting mission in late 1975, as well as a verdict from the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It acknowledged that Western Sahara had historical links with Morocco and Mauritania, but not sufficient to prove the sovereignty of either State over the territory at the time of the Spanish colonization. The population of the territory thus possessed the right of self-determination. On 6 November 1975 Morocco initiated the Green March into Western Sahara; 350,000 unarmed Moroccans converged on the city of Tarfaya in southern Morocco and waited for a signal from King Hassan II of Morocco to cross the border in a peaceful march. A few days before, on 31 October, Moroccan troops invaded Western Sahara from the north.

=== Demands for independence ===
In the waning days of General Franco&#x27;s rule, and after the Green March, the Spanish government signed a tripartite agreement with Morocco and Mauritania as it moved to transfer the territory on 14 November 1975. The accords were based on a bipartite administration, and Morocco and Mauritania each moved to annex the territories, with Morocco taking control of the northern two-thirds of Western Sahara as its Southern Provinces, and Mauritania taking control of the southern third as Tiris al-Gharbiyya. Spain terminated its presence in Spanish Sahara within three months, repatriating Spanish remains from its cemeteries.

The Moroccan and Mauritanian annexations were resisted by the Polisario Front, which had gained backing from Algeria. It initiated guerrilla warfare and, in 1979, Mauritania withdrew due to pressure from Polisario, including a bombardment of its capital and other economic targets. Morocco extended its control to the rest of the territory. It gradually contained the guerrillas by setting up the extensive sand-berm in the desert (known as the Border Wall or Moroccan Wall) to exclude guerrilla fighters. Hostilities ceased in a 1991 cease-fire, overseen by the peacekeeping mission MINURSO, under the terms of a UN Settlement Plan.

=== Stalling of the referendum and Settlement Plan ===

The referendum, originally scheduled for 1992, foresaw giving the local population the option between independence or affirming integration with Morocco, but it quickly stalled. In 1997, the Houston Agreement attempted to revive the proposal for a referendum but likewise has hitherto not had success. , negotiations over terms have not resulted in any substantive action. At the heart of the dispute lies the question of who qualifies to be registered to participate in the referendum, and, since about the year 2000, Morocco considers that since there is no agreement on persons entitled to vote, a referendum is not possible. Meanwhile, Polisario still insisted on a referendum with independence as a clear option, without offering a solution to the problem of who is qualified to be registered to participate in it.

Both sides blame each other for the stalling of the referendum. The Polisario has insisted on only allowing those found on the 1974 Spanish Census lists (see below) to vote, while Morocco has insisted that the census was flawed by evasion and sought the inclusion of members of Sahrawi tribes that escaped from Spanish invasion to the north of Morocco by the 19th century.

Efforts by the UN special envoys to find a common ground for both parties did not succeed. By 1999 the UN had identified about 85,000 voters, with nearly half of them in the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara or Southern Morocco, and the others scattered between the Tindouf refugee camps, Mauritania and other places of exile. Polisario accepted this voter list, as it had done with the previous list presented by the UN (both of them originally based on the Spanish census of 1974), but Morocco refused and, as rejected voter candidates began a mass-appeals procedure, insisted that each application be scrutinized individually. This again brought the process to a halt.

According to a NATO delegation, MINURSO election observers stated in 1999, as the deadlock continued, that &quot;if the number of voters does not rise significantly the odds were slightly on the SADR side&quot;. By 2001, the process had effectively stalemated and the UN Secretary-General asked the parties for the first time to explore other, third-way solutions. Indeed, shortly after the Houston Agreement (1997), Morocco officially declared that it was &quot;no longer necessary&quot; to include an option of independence on the ballot, offering instead autonomy. Erik Jensen, who played an administrative role in MINURSO, wrote that neither side would agree to a voter registration in which they were destined to lose (see &quot;Western Sahara: Anatomy of a Stalemate&quot;).

=== Baker Plan ===

As personal envoy of the Secretary-General, James Baker visited all sides and produced the document known as the &quot;Baker Plan&quot;. This was discussed by the United Nations Security Council in 2000, and envisioned an autonomous Western Sahara Authority (WSA), which would be followed after five years by the referendum. Every person present in the territory would be allowed to vote, regardless of birthplace and with no regard to the Spanish census. It was rejected by both sides, although it was initially derived from a Moroccan proposal. According to Baker&#x27;s draft, tens of thousands of post-annexation immigrants from Morocco proper (viewed by Polisario as settlers but by Morocco as legitimate inhabitants of the area) would be granted the vote in the Sahrawi independence referendum, and the ballot would be split three ways by the inclusion of an unspecified &quot;autonomy&quot;, further undermining the independence camp. Morocco was also allowed to keep its army in the area and retain control over all security issues during both the autonomy years and the election. In 2002, the Moroccan king stated that the referendum idea was &quot;out of date&quot; since it &quot;cannot be implemented&quot;; Polisario retorted that that was only because of the King&#x27;s refusal to allow it to take place.

In 2003, a new version of the plan was made official, with some additions spelling out the powers of the WSA, making it less reliant on Moroccan devolution. It also provided further detail on the referendum process in order to make it harder to stall or subvert. This second draft, commonly known as Baker II, was accepted by the Polisario as a &quot;basis of negotiations&quot; to the surprise of many. This appeared to abandon Polisario&#x27;s previous position of only negotiating based on the standards of voter identification from 1991 (i.e. the Spanish census). After that, the draft quickly garnered widespread international support, culminating in the UN Security Council&#x27;s unanimous endorsement of the plan in the summer of 2003.

=== End of the 2000s ===
Baker resigned his post at the United Nations in 2004; his term did not see the crisis resolved. His resignation followed several months of failed attempts to get Morocco to enter into formal negotiations on the plan, but he was met with rejection.

King Hassan II of Morocco initially supported the referendum idea in principle in 1982, and signed contracts with Polisario and the UN in 1991 and 1997. No major powers have expressed interest in forcing the issue, however, and Morocco has shown little interest in a real referendum. Hassan II&#x27;s son and successor, Mohammed VI, has opposed any referendum on independence, and has said Morocco will never agree to one: &quot;We shall not give up one inch of our beloved Sahara, not a grain of its sand.&quot; In 2006, he created an appointed advisory body Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs (CORCAS), which proposes a self-governing Western Sahara as an autonomous community within Morocco.

The UN has put forth no replacement strategy after the breakdown of Baker II, and renewed fighting has been raised as a possibility. In 2005, former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan reported increased military activity on both sides of the front and breaches of several cease-fire provisions against strengthening military fortifications.

Morocco has repeatedly tried to engage Algeria in bilateral negotiations, based on its view of Polisario as the of the Algerian military. It has received vocal support from France and occasionally (and currently) from the United States. These negotiations would define the exact limits of a Western Sahara autonomy under Moroccan rule but only after Morocco&#x27;s &quot;inalienable right&quot; to the territory was recognized as a precondition to the talks. The Algerian government has consistently refused, claiming it has neither the will nor the right to negotiate on the behalf of the Polisario Front.

In May 2005, demonstrations and riots by supporters of independence or a referendum broke out in the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara and in parts of southern Morocco (notably the town of Assa). They were met by police. Several international human rights organizations expressed concern at what they termed abuse by Moroccan security forces, and a number of Sahrawi activists have been jailed. Pro-independence Sahrawi sources, including the Polisario, have given these demonstrations the name &quot;Independence Intifada&quot;, while most sources have tended to see the events as being of limited importance. International press and other media coverage have been sparse, and reporting is complicated by the Moroccan government&#x27;s policy of strictly controlling independent media coverage within the territory.
Demonstrations and protests still occur, even after Morocco declared in February 2006 that it was contemplating a plan for devolving a limited variant of autonomy to the territory but still explicitly refused any referendum on independence. As of January 2007, the plan had not been made public, though the Moroccan government claimed that it was more or less complete.

Polisario has intermittently threatened to resume fighting, referring to the Moroccan refusal of a referendum as a breach of the cease-fire terms, but most observers seem to consider armed conflict unlikely without the green light from Algeria, which houses the Sahrawis&#x27; refugee camps and has been the main military sponsor of the movement.

In April 2007, the government of Morocco suggested that a self-governing entity, through the CORCAS, should govern the territory with some degree of autonomy for Western Sahara. The project was presented to the UN Security Council in mid-April 2007. The stalemating of the Moroccan proposal options has led the UN in the recent &quot;Report of the UN Secretary-General&quot; to ask the parties to enter into direct and unconditional negotiations to reach a mutually accepted political solution.

=== 2010s ===

In October 2010, Gadaym Izik camp was set up near Laayoune as a protest by displaced Sahrawi people about their living conditions. It was home to more than 12,000 people. In November 2010, Moroccan security forces entered Gadaym Izik camp in the early hours of the morning, using helicopters and water cannon to force people to leave. The Polisario Front said Moroccan security forces had killed a 26-year-old protester at the camp, a claim denied by Morocco. Protesters in Laayoune threw stones at police and set fire to tires and vehicles. Several buildings, including a TV station, were also set on fire. Moroccan officials said five security personnel had been killed in the unrest.

On 15 November 2010, the Moroccan government accused the Algerian secret services of orchestrating and financing the Gadaym Izik camp with the intent to destabilize the region. The Spanish press was accused of mounting a campaign of disinformation to support the Sahrawi initiative, and all foreign reporters were either prevented from traveling or else expelled from the area. The protest coincided with a fresh round of negotiations at the UN.

In 2016, the European Union (EU) declared that &quot;Western Sahara is not part of Moroccan territory.&quot; In March 2016, Morocco &quot;expelled more than 70 U.N. civilian staffers with MINURSO&quot; due to strained relations after Ban Ki-moon called Morocco&#x27;s annexation of Western Sahara an &quot;occupation&quot;.

===2020s===
In November 2020, the ceasefire between the Polisario Front and Morocco broke down, leading to armed clashes between both sides.

On 10 December 2020, the United States announced that it would recognize full Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara in exchange for Morocco normalizing relations with Israel with a view for subsequent establishment of diplomatic relations.

In February 2021, Morocco proposed to Spain the creation of an autonomy for Western Sahara under the sovereignty of the King of Morocco.

In March 2022, the Spanish government abandoned its traditional position of neutrality in the conflict, siding with the Moroccan government and recognising the autonomy proposal &quot;as the most serious, realistic and credible basis for the resolution of the dispute&quot;. This sudden turnaround was generally rejected by both the Opposition, the parties that make up the government coalition, the Polisario Front, as well as members of the governing party, who support a solution &quot;that respects the democratic will of the Saharawi people&quot;.

In July 2023, Israel officially recognized Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. 

In October 2024, in a speech to the Parliament of Morocco, French President Emmanuel Macron backed Morocco&#x27;s autonomy proposal. Macron also unveiled a €25 million ($27 million) investment in Guelmim-Oued Noun, which includes part of the Western Sahara.

== Politics ==


Sovereignty over Western Sahara is contested between Morocco and the Polisario Front and its legal status remains unresolved. The United Nations considers it to be a &quot;non-self-governing territory&quot;.

Formally, Morocco is administered by a bicameral parliament under a constitutional monarchy wherein the monarch retains significant powers, such as the capacity to appoint the government and to dissolve parliament. The last elections to the parliament&#x27;s lower house were deemed reasonably free and fair by international observers. The Morocco-controlled parts of Western Sahara are divided into several provinces that are treated as integral parts of the kingdom. The Moroccan government heavily subsidizes the Saharan provinces under its control with cut-rate fuel and related subsidies, to appease nationalist dissent and attract immigrants from Sahrawis and other communities in Morocco proper.

The exiled government of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) is a form of single-party parliamentary and presidential system, but according to its constitution, this will be changed into a multi-party system at the achievement of independence. It is presently based at the Tindouf refugee camps in Algeria, which it controls. It also controls the part of Western Sahara to the east of the Moroccan Wall, known as the &quot;liberated territories&quot;. This area has a very small population, estimated to be approximately 30,000 nomads. The Moroccan government views it as a no-man&#x27;s land patrolled by UN troops. The SADR government whose troops also patrol the area have proclaimed a village in the area, Bir Lehlou and Tifariti, as SADR&#x27;s former and actual temporary factual capitals.

On 18 December 2019, the Comoros became the first nation to open a consulate in Laayoune in support of Moroccan claims to Western Sahara. In January 2020, The Gambia and Guinea opened consulates in Dakhla; meanwhile, Gabon opened a consulate general in Laayoune. As part of the Moroccan-Israeli normalisation deal, the United States established a temporary consulate post in Dakhla in January 2021 as a transition to establishing a permanent consulate within the near future.

=== Human rights ===

The Western Sahara conflict has resulted in severe human-rights abuses, constantly reported by external reporters and human rights activists, most notably the displacement of tens of thousands of Sahrawi civilians from the country, the expulsion of tens of thousands of Moroccan civilians by the Algerian government from Algeria, and numerous casualties of war and repression.

During the war years (1975–1991), both sides accused each other of targeting civilians. Moroccan claims of Polisario terrorism have generally had little to no support abroad, with the US, European Union, African Union and UN all refusing to include the group on their lists of terrorist organizations. Polisario leaders maintain that they are ideologically opposed to terrorism, and insist that collective punishment and forced disappearances among Sahrawi civilians should be considered state terrorism on the part of Morocco. Both Morocco and the Polisario additionally accuse each other of violating the human rights of the populations under their control, in the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara and the Tindouf refugee camps in Algeria, respectively. Morocco and organizations such as France Libertés consider Algeria to be directly responsible for any crimes committed on its territory, and accuse the country of having been directly involved in such violations.

Morocco has been repeatedly criticized for its actions in Western Sahara by international human rights organizations including:
* Amnesty International
* Human Rights Watch
* World Organization Against Torture
* Freedom House
* Reporters Without Borders
* International Committee of the Red Cross
* UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
* Derechos Human Rights
* Defend International
* Front Line
* International Federation for Human Rights
* Society for Threatened Peoples
* Norwegian Refugee Council

The POLISARIO has received criticism from the French organisation France Libertes on its treatment of Moroccan prisoners of war, and on its general behaviour in the Tindouf refugee camps in reports by the Belgian commercial counseling society ESISC. Social anthropologist of the Sahara Desert, Konstantina Isidoros, said that in both 2005 and 2008, ESISC issued two near-identical reports proclaiming distorted truths that Polisario is evolving to new fears terrorism, radical Islamism or international crime. According Isidoros &quot;lies appear to play some peculiar importance in this report&quot;. Jacob Mundi considers this report as a part of the Moroccan propaganda designed to discredit the Polisario Front.

A number of former Polisario officials who have defected to Morocco accuse the organization of abuse of human rights and sequestration of the population in Tindouf.

== Administrative divisions ==

=== Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ===
The SADR has two levels of notional administrative division:
* 4 provinces (), named after the notional capitals: Aousserd, Dakhla, Laayoune, and Smara
* 25 districts ()

=== Moroccan regions and provinces ===
Three Moroccan regions are within or partly within Western Sahara:
* Guelmim-Oued Noun Region
*: &quot;Assa-Zag Province&quot;
* Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra Region
*: &quot;Boujdour Province&quot;
*: &quot;Es Semara Province&quot;
*: &quot;Laâyoune Province&quot;
*: &quot;Tarfaya Province&quot;
* Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab Region
*: &quot;Aousserd Province&quot;
*: &quot;Oued Eddahab Province&quot;

Morocco controls territory to the west of the berm (border wall) while the Sahrawi Republic controls territory to the east (see map on right).

== Dispute ==
 
Western Sahara was partitioned between Morocco and Mauritania in April 1976, with Morocco acquiring the northern two-thirds of the territory. When Mauritania, under pressure from Polisario guerrillas, abandoned all claims to its portion in August 1979, Morocco moved to occupy that sector shortly thereafter and has since asserted administrative control over the whole territory. The official Moroccan government name for Western Sahara is the &quot;Southern Provinces&quot;, consisting of the Río de Oro and Saguia el-Hamra regions.

The portion not under the control of the Moroccan government is the area that lies between the border wall and the actual border with Algeria. The Polisario Front claims to run this as the Free Zone on behalf of the SADR. The area is patrolled by Polisario forces, and access is restricted, even among Sahrawis, due to the harsh climate of the Sahara, the military conflict and the abundance of land mines. Landmine Action UK undertook preliminary survey work by visiting the Polisario-controlled area of Western Sahara in October 2005 and February–March 2006. A field assessment in the vicinity of Bir Lahlou, Tifariti and the berms revealed that the densest concentrations of mines are in front of the berms. Mines were laid in zigzags up to one meter apart, and in some parts of the berms, there are three rows of mines. There are also berms in the Moroccan-controlled zone, around Dakhla and stretching from Boujdour, including Smara on the Moroccan border. Mine-laying was not restricted to the vicinity of the berms though, as occupied settlements throughout the Polisario-controlled areas, such as Bir Lahlou and Tifariti, are ringed by mines laid by Moroccan forces.

Despite this, the area is traveled and inhabited by many Sahrawi nomads from the Tindouf refugee camps of Algeria and the Sahrawi communities in Mauritania. United Nations MINURSO forces are also present in the area. The UN forces oversee the cease-fire between Polisario and Morocco agreed upon in the 1991 Settlement Plan.

The Polisario forces (of the Sahrawi People&#x27;s Liberation Army (SPLA)) in the area are divided into seven &quot;military regions&quot;, each controlled by a top commander reporting to the President of the Polisario proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The total size of the Polisario&#x27;s guerrilla army present in this area is unknown, but it is believed to number a few thousand men, despite many combatants being demobilized due to the cease-fire.

Major Sahrawi political events, such as Polisario congresses and sessions of the Sahrawi National Council (the SADR parliament in exile) are held in the Free Zone (especially in Tifariti and Bir Lehlou), since it is politically and symbolically important to conduct political affairs on Sahrawi territory. In 2005, MINURSO lodged a complaint to the Security Council of the United Nations for &quot;military maneuvers with real fire which extends to restricted areas&quot; by Morocco. A concentration of forces for the commemoration of the Saharawi Republic&#x27;s 30th anniversary were subject to condemnation by the United Nations, as it was considered an example of a cease-fire violation to bring such a large force concentration into the area. In late 2009, Moroccan troops performed military maneuvers near Umm Dreiga, in the exclusion zone, violating the cease-fire. Both parties have been accused of such violations by the UN, but to date there has been no serious hostile action from either side since 1991.

UN sponsored peace talks, the first in six years between Morocco and Polisario, were held in Geneva on 5 December 2018, with both sides agreeing to meet again in a few months for further talks.

During the joint Moroccan–Mauritanian control of the area, the Mauritanian-controlled part, roughly corresponding to Saquia el-Hamra, was known as Tiris al-Gharbiyya.

== Economy ==
Aside from its rich fishing waters and phosphate reserves, Western Sahara has few natural resources and lacks sufficient rainfall and freshwater resources for most agricultural activities. Western Sahara&#x27;s much-touted phosphate reserves are relatively unimportant, representing less than two percent of proven phosphate reserves in Morocco. There is speculation that there may be off-shore oil and natural gas fields, but the debate persists as to whether these resources can be profitably exploited, and if this would be legally permitted due to the non-self-governing status of Western Sahara (see below).

Western Sahara&#x27;s economy is based almost entirely on fishing, which employs two-thirds of its workforce, with mining, agriculture and tourism providing modest additional income. Most food for the urban population comes from Morocco. All trade and other economic activities are controlled by the Moroccan government (as its de facto southern province). The government has encouraged citizens to relocate to the territory by giving subsidies and price controls on basic goods. These heavy subsidies have created a state-dominated economy in the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara.

Due to the disputed nature of Moroccan sovereignty over the territory, the application of international accords to Western Sahara is highly ambiguous. Political leadership of trade agreement signatories such as the United States (US-Morocco Free Trade Agreement) and Norway (European Free Trade Association trade accord) have made statements as to these agreements&#x27; non-applicability – although practical policy application is ambiguous.

=== Exploitation of natural resources ===

After reasonably exploitable oil fields were located in Mauritania, speculation intensified on the possibility of major oil resources being located off the coast of Western Sahara. Despite the fact that findings remain inconclusive, both Morocco and the Polisario have signed deals with oil and gas exploration companies. US and French companies (notably TotalEnergies and Kerr-McGee) began prospecting on behalf of the Moroccan Office National de Recherches et d&#x27;Exploitations Petrolières (ONAREP).

In 2002, Hans Corell, Under-Secretary General of the United Nations and head of its Office of Legal Affairs, issued a legal opinion on the matter. The opinion was rendered following an analysis of relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, the United Nations General Assembly resolutions, the case law of the International Court of Justice and the practice of sovereign states. It concluded that while the existing exploration contracts for the area were not illegal, &quot;if further exploration and exploitation activities were to proceed in disregard of the interests and wishes of the people of Western Sahara, they would be in violation of the principles of international law.&quot; After pressures from corporate ethics-groups, TotalEnergies pulled out in late 2004.

In May 2006, the remaining company, Kerr-McGee, also left, following sales of numerous shareholders like the National Norwegian Oil Fund, due to continued pressure from NGOs and corporate groups.

In December 2014, it became known that Seabird Exploration operated controversial seismic surveys offshore Western Sahara, in violation of the 2002 Hans Corell legal opinion.

The European Union fishing agreements with Morocco include Western Sahara.

In a previously confidential legal opinion (published in February 2010, although it was forwarded in July 2009), the European Parliament&#x27;s Legal Service opined that fishing by European vessels under a current EU–Morocco fishing agreement covering Western Sahara&#x27;s waters is in violation of international law.

Similarly, the exploitation of phosphate mines in Bou Craa has led to charges of international law violations and divestment from several European states.

== Demographics ==
The indigenous population of Western Sahara is usually known in Western media as Sahrawis, but they are also referred to in Morocco as &quot;Southerners&quot; or &quot;Southern Berbers&quot;. They are Hassaniya-speaking or Berber-speaking tribes of Berber origin (97% of Y-DNA). Many of them have mixed Berber-Arab heritage, effectively continuations of the tribal groupings of Hassaniya-speaking and Zenaga-Berber speaking Moorish tribes extending south into Mauritania and north into Morocco as well as east into Algeria. The Sahrawis are traditionally nomadic Bedouins with a lifestyle very similar to that of the Tuareg Berbers from whom Sahrawis most likely have descended, and they can be found in all surrounding countries. War and conflict has led to major population displacement.

As of July 2004, an estimated 267,405 people (excluding about 160,000 Moroccan military personnel) lived in the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara. Many people from parts of Morocco have come to live in the territory, and these latest arrivals are today thought to outnumber the indigenous Western Sahara Sahrawis. The precise size and composition of the population is subject to political controversy.

The Polisario-controlled parts of Western Sahara are barren. This area has a sparse population, estimated to be approximately 30,000 in 2008. The population is primarily made up of nomads who engage in herding camels back and forth between the Tindouf area and Mauritania. The presence of land mines scattered throughout the territory by the Moroccan army makes this a dangerous way of life.

=== Spanish census and MINURSO ===
A 1974 Spanish census claimed there were some 74,000 Sahrawis in the area at the time (in addition to approximately 20,000 Spanish residents), but this number is likely to be on the low side, due to the difficulty in counting a nomad people, even if Sahrawis were by the mid-1970s mostly urbanized. Despite these possible inaccuracies, Morocco and the Polisario Front agreed on using the Spanish census as the basis for voter registration when striking a cease-fire agreement in the late 1980s, contingent on the holding of a referendum on independence or integration into Morocco.

In December 1999, the United Nations&#x27; MINURSO mission announced that it had identified 86,425 eligible voters for the referendum that was supposed to be held under the 1991 Settlement plan and the 1997 Houston accords. By &quot;eligible voter&quot; the UN referred to any Sahrawi over 18 years of age that was part of the Spanish census or could prove their descent from someone who was. These 86,425 Sahrawis were dispersed between Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara and the refugee camps in Algeria, with smaller numbers in Mauritania and other places of exile. These numbers cover only Sahrawis &#x27;indigenous&#x27; to Western Sahara during the Spanish colonial period, not the total number of &quot;ethnic&quot; Sahrawis (i.e., members of Sahrawi tribal groupings), who also extend into Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria. The number was highly politically significant due to the expected organization of a referendum on self-determination.

The Polisario has its home base in the Tindouf refugee camps in Algeria, and declares the number of Sahrawi population in the camps to be approximately 155,000. Morocco disputes this number, saying it is exaggerated for political reasons and for attracting more foreign aid. The UN uses a number of 90,000 &quot;most vulnerable&quot; refugees as basis for its food aid program.

== Culture ==


The major ethnic group of Western Sahara are the Sahrawis, a nomadic or Bedouin ethnic group speaking the Hassānīya dialect of Arabic, also spoken in much of Mauritania. They are of mixed Arab-Berber descent, but claim descent from the Beni Hassan, an Arab tribe that migrated across the desert in the 11th century.

Like other Saharan Bedouin and Hassaniya groups, the Sahrawis are mostly Muslims of the Sunni branch and the Maliki fiqh. Local religious custom (Urf) is, like other Saharan groups, heavily influenced by pre-Islamic Berber and African practices, and differs substantially from urban practices. For example, Sahrawi Islam has traditionally functioned without mosques, in an adaptation to nomadic life.

The original clan-/tribe-based society underwent a massive social upheaval in 1975 when the war forced part of the population to settle in the refugee camps of Tindouf, Algeria, where they remain. Families were broken up by the dispute.

The Museum of the Sahrawi People&#x27;s Liberation Army is located in this refugee camp. This museum is dedicated to the struggle for the independence of Western Saharan people. It presents weapons, vehicles and uniforms, as well as abundant documentation history.

=== Cross-cultural influence ===
The contemporary history of the territory has experienced long-term international presence and occupation that has deeply influenced the cultural practices of the people, such as languages spoken throughout the territory and its institutions. Spanish colonization lasted roughly from 1884 to 1976, following the creation of the Madrid Accords where Spain absolved all responsibility over the territory and left it to Morocco and Mauritania.

Throughout the nine decades of Spanish colonial presence, one of the primary spoken languages in Western Sahara came to be Spanish. The reasons for its widespread usage was due to the necessity of communicating with Spanish leadership and administrators throughout the territory, who ultimately established institutions modeled after those of Spain. The importance and prevalence of Spanish has persisted to the present day, even after Spanish withdrawal from Western Sahara in 1976, due to various education exchanges and host programs for Sahrawi children to Spain and Cuba.

One such exchange program to Spain is Vacaciones en Paz (Vacations in Peace), which is an annual holiday program that was created in 1988 and is organized by the Union of Sahrawi Youth (UJSARIO) in collaboration with 300 other associations throughout Spain. The program itself allows 7,000 to 10,000 Sahrawi children between the ages of 8 and 12 the opportunity to live in Spain for the summer outside of the refugee camps. Sometimes children return to the same Spanish household year after year while they are still eligible, and forge strong relationships with their host families. These types of exchange programs that successfully create cross-border and cross-cultural relationships reinforce the usage of the Spanish language throughout subsequent generations of Sahrawi children.

=== Gender relations ===

Much Spanish literature and recent refugee studies scholarship has been dedicated to the exploration of the major role women play in Sahrawi society, and the degree of freedom they experience within the occupied territory and the refugee camps. There is a consensus among Sahrawi women that they have always enjoyed a large degree of freedom and influence within the Sahrawi community.

Traditionally, women have played pivotal roles in Sahrawi culture, as well as in efforts to resist colonialism and foreign interference in their territory. Similar to other nomadic traditions on the African continent, Sahrawi women traditionally exercised significant power and roles both in the camp and in their tents.

Sahrawi women could inherit property, and subsist independently from their fathers, brothers, husbands, and other male relatives. Women were key for establishing alliances through marriage, being that the Sahrawi culture values monogamy, with their tribe and to others. Furthermore, Sahrawi women were endowed with major responsibility for the camp during long periods of absence by the men of the camp due to war or trade. Among the responsibilities women had were setting up, repairing, and moving the tents of the camp, and participating in major tribal decisions.

In the contemporary history of Western Sahara, women have occupied central roles and been highly represented in the political sphere. During Spanish colonial rule, Sahrawi women actively provided financial and physical support to the resistance movements during the 1930s, 1950s, and the late 1960s. In more official ways, women were consistently part of the Polisario Front, which in 1994 created the National Union of Sahrawi Women (NUSW). The NUSW was structured at the local, regional, and national levels and concentrated on four areas: the occupied territories and emigration, information and culture, political and professional development, and foreign affairs.

=== Art and cultural expression ===
FiSahara International Film Festival is an annual film festival that takes place in one of the southwestern refugee camps in Algeria. At this event, actors, directors, and film industry insiders from around the world join the Sahrawi people for a week-long festival of screenings, parallel activities, and concerts. The festival provides entertainment and educational opportunities for Sahrawi refugees alongside cultural celebrations for visitors and spectators. It aims to raise awareness of the humanitarian crises in the refugee camps, and expose the Sahrawi people to this medium of art and expression.

Spanish filmmakers and actors, such as Javier Bardem, Penélope Cruz, and Pedro Almodóvar have supported and attended the festival. In 2013, the festival screened over 15 films from around the world including comedies, short films, animations, and documentaries. Some of the films were made by the refugees themselves. Art as embodied in film has been a strong and popular medium that Sahrawi youth have used to express themselves, and share their stories of conflict and exile.

ARTifariti, the International Art and Human Rights Meeting in Western Sahara, is an annual art workshop set up in the Liberated Zone and refugee camps, specifically in Tifariti, that brings artists from all over the world. This event led to the introduction of graffiti art to the camps, and popular graffiti artists have come to the workshop to work with refugees. One such artist was Spanish street artist MESA, who travelled to the Sahrawi refugee camps in 2011 and displayed his own graffiti throughout the landscape. His canvases of choice were destroyed walls, which he brought back to life through his art.

MESA inspired other Sahrawis to express themselves and embody their national struggle through art and graffiti. One such artist is Mohamed Sayad, a Sahrawi artist that has been transforming the refugee camp landscape by creating works of art amongst the devastation in camps that have existed for four decades. His canvases, much like MESA, are walls that have been ruined by massive floods in the Sahrawi refugee camps in southwestern Algeria. Sayad&#x27;s work tells a consistent story, one that draws on his experience of protracted conflict and a life under Moroccan occupation. Sayad&#x27;s graffiti depicts aspects of Sahrawi culture and includes actual Sahrawi people as his subjects.

Poetry is a popular artform in Sahrawi culture, and is composed by both men and women. Notable poets include: Al Khadra Mabrook, Hadjatu Aliat Swelm, Beyibouh El Haj. Traditionally, Sahrawi poetry was performed and passed on orally: younger poets would undergo &#x27;apprenticeships to more experienced ones, today the internet is a key way in which Sahrawi poetry is transmitted between and within generations&#x27;. However Sahrawi poets find it difficult to be published, especially by Arabic publishers, due to the political nature of much of their output.
