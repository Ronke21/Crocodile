<text>Summerfest is an annual music festival held in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. First held in 1968, Summerfest is located at Henry Maier Festival Park, adjacent to Lake Michigan and Milwaukee&#x27;s Third Ward business district. Summerfest is known as &quot;The World&#x27;s Largest Music Festival&quot;, a title certified by Guinness World Records in 1999.

During Summerfest, the 75 acre (30 ha) park hosts the industry&#x27;s biggest acts for an unforgettable live music experience, from late June until early July (including the Fourth of July). It was announced in 2021 that the festival would move to a three weekend schedule to allow for more Friday and Saturday event days. The performers include local and nationally known music talent from various genres, performing throughout the grounds from noon to midnight, including the 23,000-capacity American Family Insurance Amphitheater. Since 2004, nearly $150 million has been invested into Henry Maier Festival Park, including permanent stages, bars, production space, VIP amenities and other infrastructure.

Summerfest also showcases a wide variety of food from many Milwaukee-area restaurants. Other Summerfest attractions include shopping vendors, fireworks (including &quot;The Big Bang&quot; on opening night), family activities, and more. Summerfest is operated by Milwaukee World Festival, Inc. a non-profit organization, which is governed by a volunteer board of directors.

In its 50+ year history, Summerfest has hosted a variety of well-known artists, including Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Tina Turner, Metallica, Whitney Houston, Stevie Wonder, Kenny Chesney, Aerosmith, Bruno Mars, Arctic Monkeys, Lady Gaga, Usher, and Dave Matthews Band.

In 2024 Summerfest welcomed SZA, Tyler Childers, Lil Uzi Vert, Maroon 5, Kane Brown, AJR, Ivan Cornejo, Goo Goo Dolls, Bryson Tiller, Cold War Kids, Mario, Alison Wonderland, En Vogue, The All-American Rejects,REO Speedwagon, Ethel Cain, Key Glock, and many others. 

Don Smiley served as president and chief executive officer of Summerfest from 2004 until his retirement in December 2023. He was succeeded in both roles by Sarah Smith Pancheri.

== Community Engagement ==
Aligned with Summerfest&#x27;s non-profit mission, the festival made significant contributions to the community in 2024, providing over 26,000 meals for Wisconsinites struggling with food insecurity through Feeding America Eastern Wisconsin, over $13,500 worth of hygiene products donated to Milwaukee and Waukesha County schools through the United Way, and over 4,000 books for Next Door&#x27;s community literacy initiatives. The festival also integrated over 70 local community organizations into the festival through performances and events such as Direct Supply Seniorfest Day and Children&#x27;s Fest Day presented by Shorewest, Realtors. 

=== Economic Impact ===
In 2023, Summerfest conducted an independent economic impact study through Oxford Economics, and we&#x27;re thrilled to share the results! Summerfest presented by American Family Insurance generated a total economic impact of $160.3 million for the city of Milwaukee and supported 3,400 total part-time and full-time jobs. For the state of Wisconsin, Summerfest generated $188.7 million in economic impact, along with $14.4 million in state and local taxes. 

=== Admission Promotions ===
Summerfest offers more ways than ever to access the festival via free or discounted admission, while giving back to the community. On select days, fans are encouraged to donate non-perishable food items, hygiene supplies, or books to get into the festival and enjoy the fun, while supporting the local community. 

=== Let the Music Play Grant Program ===
Since its inception in 2019, the Let the Music Play Grant Program has supported over 40 organizations and hundreds of music students annually. The program is open to non-profit organizations and schools through music-based programming and represent the variety of music-based activities taking place in the greater Milwaukee community. 

=== BMO Empower Grant Program ===
The BMO EMpower grant program is a long-term platform that helps support minority-owned businesses through BMO&#x27;s partnership with Summerfest. 

These grants are part of BMO&#x27;s EMpower program, a more than $40 billion commitment to address key barriers faced by minority businesses, communities and families in the United States. In 2024, 11 minority small business owners received funding, along with business banking-related educational opportunities, to support their work as vendors during Summerfest. 

=== POWER UP WITH PURPOSE ===
The &quot;Power Up with Purpose&quot; program allows fans the opportunity to gain front row, pit access to Generac Power Stage headliners during the festival, while supporting Veterans Community Project in Milwaukee, WI.All proceeds will benefit Veterans Community Project (VCP), a nationally recognized nonprofit organization dedicated to ending Veteran homelessness.

==History==
Summerfest was conceived in the 1960s by then-mayor Henry W. Maier. Inspired by his visit to Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany, Maier envisioned a similar ethnic-themed festival in Milwaukee, and in 1962 formed a panel of business and civic leaders to study the feasibility of a large-scale summer festival. By the middle of the decade, the panel drew up a proposal for a 10-day multi-event festival with the proposed name of &quot;Milwaukee World Festival,&quot; which was changed briefly in 1966 to &quot;Juli Spa√ü&quot; (German for &quot;July Fun&quot;) and then to &quot;Summerfest&quot;.

The inaugural Summerfest was held in July 1968 at 35 different locations throughout the city (including Milwaukee County Stadium and Milwaukee Arena), and its events ranged from concerts to a film festival, an air show, and even a pageant. The first Summerfest, produced by Dee Robb and Con Merten was regarded as a success; the second event in 1969, was less successful, as it was plagued by additional venues, inclement weather, and severe financial debt.

In 1970, a permanent central location was decided upon, and Summerfest moved to a former Nike missile site on the lakefront, where it continues to be held to this day. Also that year, Summerfest introduced its red &quot;smiley face&quot; logo, an insignia that has become synonymous with the event. The logo was designed by local graphic artists Noel Spangler and Richard D. Grant.

It was also in 1970 that Henry Jordan, former Green Bay Packers defensive tackle, became executive director of Summerfest, a title he held during the event&#x27;s early years until his death in 1977. After a few other businessmen were hired by the board for the executive director&#x27;s job, Elizabeth &quot;Bo&quot; Black, who was formerly Henry Jordan&#x27;s secretary, became executive director in 1984 after a ten-year lobbying effort.

The event has not been without its controversy. On December 9, 2002, Lee Gates commented in the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; about the lack of opportunity to play at Summerfest. &quot;I don&#x27;t get the credit I deserve here. I&#x27;ve been playing 50-something years. There&#x27;s discrimination at Summerfest. I shouldn&#x27;t need to have a CD out to be paid $700 at Summerfest. If they want you to have CDs, they should pay you like they pay the professional people.&quot;

Summerfest celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2007. The event&#x27;s history was the subject of &quot;Summerfest Stories&quot;, a documentary that aired in June 2007 on Milwaukee Public Television.

In 2015, Milwaukee World Festival, Inc and ReverbNation announced a three-year agreement to use the online service as an audition to give musicians a chance to perform. Summerfest wanted to provide an opportunity for performers to get a chance to be one of the 800+ acts and allow new talent to be seen by over 900,000 people that attend.

2020 saw the COVID-19 pandemic as grounds for scrapping the concert part &amp; moving others online.

===Attendance===

Summerfest Attendance Since 1995
Summerfest attendance peaked in 2001 (12 days over 2 weeks) at 1,000,563 attendees. In 2010 Summerfest officials announced a new 11-day schedule for the 2011 festival. Summerfest was closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021 (409,386 attendees), the event was revised to 9 days ( 3 weekends) instead of 11 days (over 2 weeks), and it occurred in September rather than during the summer months.Summerfest returned to the June /July summer months in 2022 (445,611 attendees), but continued the 3 weekend format. Citing analyzed available data, patron surveys and the event landscape Milwaukee World Festival ultimately determined the best possible path forward for Summerfest was to transition to a 3 weekend format. 

The festival reported 555,925 fans during Summerfest 2024, despite rain impacting six of the nine festival days (2024 saw the most rain since Summerfest 2000). In fulfillment of Milwaukee World Festival, Inc.&#x27;s (MWF) nonprofit mission, 21% of those patrons who attended the festival gained access via one of the 14 free admission promotions. 

==Stages and other venues==
The Summerfest grounds include seven permanent stages and two pavilions that can be converted to stages (Johnson Controls World Sound Stage and the South Pavilion).

==Concert history year by year==
Summerfest has been most famous for its music since the first festival in 1968, when acts such as Ronnie Dove, The New Colony Six, The Robbs and Up With People performed. Since then, musical acts from Bob Dylan, The Jackson 5, Frank Sinatra, Prince, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, The Jonas Brothers, Fleetwood Mac, Maroon 5, Fun, Britney Spears, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Cher, Tina Turner, and James Taylor to Christina Aguilera, Diana Ross, Roy Orbison, Liza Minnelli, Kanye West, Kid Cudi, Stevie Wonder, Mary J. Blige, Wiz Khalifa, Imagine Dragons, Nine Inch Nails, The Ramones, Billie Eilish, Willie Nelson, The Rolling Stones, and Paul McCartney have graced the Summerfest stages. Acts with Milwaukee and Wisconsin connections have had a prominent history at Summerfest, most notably the BoDeans, The Gufs, Danny Gokey, and Violent Femmes.

The concerts have been mostly civil events, with two notable exceptions. In 1970, a performance by the late-arriving Sly &amp; the Family Stone nearly resulted in a riot. In 1973, a performance by Humble Pie &amp; Jo Jo Gunne resulted in a riot, a bonfire, and about 300 arrests. As a result of the latter concert, organizers shied away from rock bands for several years, and established guidelines for &quot;family-friendly&quot; acts and a ban on alcohol brought in by patrons. This was properly managed when Henry Jordan found the experienced managers, Joel Gast and Lou Volpano, to manage entertainment in-house, eliminating Cleveland&#x27;s Jules Belkin Promotions, who were hired by Board Members Bernie Samson and Steve Marcus. Also at that time local manager Volpano was hired specifically to improve production and book international superstars on what was a mere Local Rock Stage, where then the Ramones, UFO, and Judas Priest headlined 
Live comedy acts have also been a part of Summerfest&#x27;s history, even before a regular &quot;Comedy Showcase&quot; was first established in 1975. Bob Hope was the main headliner at Summerfest 1969, performing two shows at Milwaukee County Stadium. George Carlin (opening for Arlo Guthrie) performed his &quot;Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television&quot; routine at the 1972 event and was subsequently arrested for violating obscenity laws. Prior to his arrest, he discarded a bag of cocaine to avoid further imprisonment.

Since 1975, comedy acts ranging from David Brenner and Henny Youngman to Jay Leno and Jon Stewart have performed at the event. Sandra Bernhard did TV and radio promos for its 1986 season when she was a performer there. Lewis Black has also become a frequent performer at Summerfest.

<doc id="33130" wikidata="Q40904" url="?curid=33130" title="Werner Heisenberg">
<text>Werner Karl Heisenberg (; ; 5 December 1901 ‚Äì 1 February 1976) was a German theoretical physicist, one of the main pioneers of the theory of quantum mechanics and a principal scientist in the Nazi nuclear weapons program during World War II.

He published his &quot;Umdeutung&quot; paper in 1925, a major reinterpretation of old quantum theory. In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, during the same year, his matrix formulation of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated. He is known for the uncertainty principle, which he published in 1927. Heisenberg was awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for the creation of quantum mechanics&quot;.

Heisenberg also made contributions to the theories of the hydrodynamics of turbulent flows, the atomic nucleus, ferromagnetism, cosmic rays, and subatomic particles. He introduced the concept of a wave function collapse. He was also instrumental in planning the first West German nuclear reactor at Karlsruhe, together with a research reactor in Munich, in 1957.

Following World War II, he was appointed director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, which soon thereafter was renamed the Max Planck Institute for Physics. He was director of the institute until it was moved to Munich in 1958. He then became director of the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics from 1960 to 1970.

Heisenberg was also president of the German Research Council, chairman of the Commission for Atomic Physics, chairman of the Nuclear Physics Working Group, and president of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.

Werner Karl Heisenberg was born in W√ºrzburg, Germany, to Kaspar Ernst August Heisenberg, and his wife, Annie Wecklein. His father was a secondary school teacher of classical languages who became Germany&#x27;s only &quot;ordentlicher Professor&quot; (ordinarius professor) of medieval and modern Greek studies in the university system.

Heisenberg was raised and lived as a Lutheran Christian. In his late teenage years, Heisenberg read Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; while hiking in the Bavarian Alps. He recounted philosophical conversations with his fellow students and teachers about understanding the atom while receiving his scientific training in Munich, G√∂ttingen and Copenhagen. Heisenberg later stated that &quot;My mind was formed by studying philosophy, Plato and that sort of thing&quot; and that &quot;Modern physics has definitely decided in favor of Plato. In fact the smallest units of matter are not physical objects in the ordinary sense; they are forms, ideas which can be expressed unambiguously only in mathematical language&quot;.

In 1919 Heisenberg arrived in Munich as a member of the &quot;Freikorps&quot; to fight the Bavarian Soviet Republic established a year earlier. Five decades later he recalled those days as youthful fun, like &quot;playing cops and robbers and so on; it was nothing serious at all&quot;; his duties were restricted to &quot;seizing bicycles or typewriters from &#x27;red&#x27; administrative buildings&quot;, and guarding suspected &quot;red&quot; prisoners.

===University studies===

From 1920 to 1923, he studied physics and mathematics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich under Arnold Sommerfeld and Wilhelm Wien and at the Georg-August University of G√∂ttingen with Max Born and James Franck and mathematics with David Hilbert. He received his doctorate in 1923 at Munich under Sommerfeld.

In June 1922, Sommerfeld took Heisenberg to G√∂ttingen to attend the Bohr Festival, because Sommerfeld had a sincere interest in his students and knew of Heisenberg&#x27;s interest in Niels Bohr&#x27;s theories on atomic physics. At the event, Bohr was a guest lecturer and gave a series of comprehensive lectures on quantum atomic physics and Heisenberg met Bohr for the first time, which had a lasting effect on him.

Heisenberg&#x27;s doctoral thesis, the topic of which was suggested by Sommerfeld, was on turbulence; the thesis discussed both the stability of laminar flow and the nature of turbulent flow. The problem of stability was investigated by the use of the Orr‚ÄìSommerfeld equation, a fourth-order linear differential equation for small disturbances from laminar flow. He briefly returned to this topic after World War II.

At G√∂ttingen, under Born, he completed his habilitation in 1924 with a &quot;Habilitationsschrift&quot; (habilitation thesis) on the anomalous Zeeman effect.

In his youth he was a member and Scoutleader of the &quot;Neupfadfinder&quot;, a German Scout association and part of the German Youth Movement. In August 1923 Robert Honsell and Heisenberg organized a trip to Finland with a Scout group of this association from Munich.

===Personal life===
Heisenberg enjoyed classical music and was an accomplished pianist. His interest in music led to meeting his future wife. In January 1937, Heisenberg met Elisabeth Schumacher (1914‚Äì1998) at a private music recital. Elisabeth was the daughter of a well-known Berlin economics professor, and her brother was the economist E. F. Schumacher, author of &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot;. Heisenberg married her on 29 April. Fraternal twins Maria and Wolfgang were born in January 1938, whereupon Wolfgang Pauli congratulated Heisenberg on his &quot;pair creation&quot;‚Äîa wordplay on a process from elementary particle physics, pair production. They had five more children over the next 12 years: Barbara, Christine, Jochen, Martin and Verena. In 1939 he bought a summer home for his family in Urfeld am Walchensee, in southern Germany.

One of Heisenberg&#x27;s sons, Martin Heisenberg, became a neurobiologist at the University of W√ºrzburg, while another son, Jochen Heisenberg, became a physics professor at the University of New Hampshire.

==Academic career==
===G√∂ttingen, Copenhagen and Leipzig===
From 1924 to 1927, Heisenberg was a Privatdozent at G√∂ttingen, meaning he was qualified to teach and examine independently, without having a chair. From 17 September 1924 to 1 May 1925, under an International Education Board Rockefeller Foundation fellowship, Heisenberg went to do research with Niels Bohr, director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen. On June 7, after weeks of failing to alleviate a severe bout of hay fever with aspirin and cocaine, Heisenberg retreated to the pollen-free North Sea island of Helgoland to focus on quantum mechanics. His seminal paper, &quot;√úber quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen&quot; (&quot;Quantum theoretical re-interpretation of kinematic and mechanical relations&quot;) also called the &quot;Umdeutung&quot; (reinterpretation) paper, was published in September 1925. He returned to G√∂ttingen and, with Max Born and Pascual Jordan over a period of about six months, developed the matrix mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics. On 1 May 1926, Heisenberg began his appointment as a university lecturer and assistant to Bohr in Copenhagen. It was in Copenhagen, in 1927, that Heisenberg developed his uncertainty principle, while working on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. On 23 February, Heisenberg wrote a letter to fellow physicist Wolfgang Pauli, in which he first described his new principle. In his paper on the principle, Heisenberg used the word &quot;Ungenauigkeit&quot; (imprecision), not uncertainty, to describe it.

In 1927, Heisenberg was appointed &quot;ordentlicher Professor&quot; (professor ordinarius) of theoretical physics and head of the department of physics at the University of Leipzig; he gave his inaugural lecture there on 1 February 1928. In his first paper published from Leipzig, Heisenberg used the Pauli exclusion principle to solve the mystery of ferromagnetism.

At 25 years old, Heisenberg gained the title of the youngest full-time professor in Germany and professorial chair of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Leipzig. He gave lectures that were attended by physicists like Edward Teller and Robert Oppenheimer, who would later work on the Manhattan Project for the United States. 

During Heisenberg&#x27;s tenure at Leipzig, the high quality of the doctoral students and post-graduate and research associates who studied and worked with him is clear from the acclaim that many later earned. They included Erich Bagge, Felix Bloch, Ugo Fano, Siegfried Fl√ºgge, William Vermillion Houston, Friedrich Hund, Robert S. Mulliken, Rudolf Peierls, George Placzek, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Fritz Sauter, John C. Slater, Edward Teller, John Hasbrouck van Vleck, Victor Frederick Weisskopf, Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker, Gregor Wentzel, and Clarence Zener.

In early 1929, Heisenberg and Pauli submitted the first of two papers laying the foundation for relativistic quantum field theory. Also in 1929, Heisenberg went on a lecture tour of China, Japan, India, and the United States. In the spring of 1929, he was a visiting lecturer at the University of Chicago, where he lectured on quantum mechanics.

In 1928, the British mathematical physicist Paul Dirac had derived his relativistic wave equation of quantum mechanics, which implied the existence of positive electrons, later to be named positrons. In 1932, from a cloud chamber photograph of cosmic rays, the American physicist Carl David Anderson identified a track as having been made by a positron. In mid-1933, Heisenberg presented his theory of the positron. His thinking on Dirac&#x27;s theory and further development of the theory were set forth in two papers. The first, &quot;Bemerkungen zur Diracschen Theorie des Positrons&quot; (&quot;Remarks on Dirac&#x27;s theory of the positron&quot;) was published in 1934, and the second, &quot;Folgerungen aus der Diracschen Theorie des Positrons&quot; (&quot;Consequences of Dirac&#x27;s Theory of the Positron&quot;), was published in 1936. In these papers Heisenberg was the first to reinterpret the Dirac equation as a &quot;classical&quot; field equation for any point particle of spin ƒß/2, itself subject to quantization conditions involving anti-commutators. Thus reinterpreting it as a (quantum) field equation accurately describing electrons, Heisenberg put matter on the same footing as electromagnetism: as being described by relativistic quantum field equations which allowed the possibility of particle creation and destruction. (Hermann Weyl had already described this in a 1929 letter to Albert Einstein.)

===Matrix mechanics and the Nobel Prize===

Heisenberg&#x27;s &quot;Umdeutung&quot; paper that established modern quantum mechanics has puzzled physicists and historians. His methods assume that the reader is familiar with Kramers-Heisenberg transition probability calculations. The main new idea, non-commuting matrices, is justified only by a rejection of unobservable quantities. It introduces the non-commutative multiplication of matrices by physical reasoning, based on the correspondence principle, despite the fact that Heisenberg was not then familiar with the mathematical theory of matrices. The path leading to these results has been reconstructed by MacKinnon, and the detailed calculations are worked out by Aitchison and coauthors.

In Copenhagen, Heisenberg and Hans Kramers collaborated on a paper on dispersion, or the scattering from atoms of radiation whose wavelength is larger than the atoms. They showed that the successful formula Kramers had developed earlier could not be based on Bohr orbits, because the transition frequencies are based on level spacings which are not constant. The frequencies which occur in the Fourier transform of the classical sharp series orbits, by contrast, are equally spaced. But these results could be explained by a semi-classical virtual state model: the incoming radiation excites the valence, or outer, electron to a virtual state from which it decays. In a subsequent paper, Heisenberg showed that this virtual oscillator model could also explain the polarization of fluorescent radiation.

These two successes, and the continuing failure of the Bohr‚ÄìSommerfeld model to explain the outstanding problem of the anomalous Zeeman effect, led Heisenberg to use the virtual oscillator model to try to calculate spectral frequencies. The method proved too difficult to immediately apply to realistic problems, so Heisenberg turned to a simpler example, the anharmonic oscillator.

The dipole oscillator consists of a simple harmonic oscillator, which is thought of as a charged particle on a spring, perturbed by an external force, like an external charge. The motion of the oscillating charge can be expressed as a Fourier series in the frequency of the oscillator. Heisenberg solved for the quantum behavior by two different methods. First, he treated the system with the virtual oscillator method, calculating the transitions between the levels that would be produced by the external source.

He then solved the same problem by treating the anharmonic potential term as a perturbation to the harmonic oscillator and using the perturbation methods that he and Born had developed. Both methods led to the same results for the first and the very complicated second-order correction terms. This suggested that behind the very complicated calculations lay a consistent scheme.

So Heisenberg set out to formulate these results without any explicit dependence on the virtual oscillator model. To do this, he replaced the Fourier expansions for the spatial coordinates with matrices, matrices which corresponded to the transition coefficients in the virtual oscillator method. He justified this replacement by an appeal to Bohr&#x27;s correspondence principle and the Pauli doctrine that quantum mechanics must be limited to observables.

On 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born this paper to review and submit for publication. When Born read the paper, he recognized the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices, which he had learned from his study under Jakob Rosanes at Breslau University. Born, with the help of his assistant and former student Pascual Jordan, began immediately to make the transcription and extension, and they submitted their results for publication; the paper was received for publication just 60 days after Heisenberg&#x27;s paper. A follow-on paper was submitted for publication before the end of the year by all three authors.

Up until this time, matrices were seldom used by physicists; they were considered to belong to the realm of pure mathematics. Gustav Mie had used them in a paper on electrodynamics in 1912 and Born had used them in his work on the lattice theory of crystals in 1921. While matrices were used in these cases, the algebra of matrices with their multiplication did not enter the picture as they did in the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics.

In 1928, Albert Einstein nominated Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan for the Nobel Prize in Physics. The announcement of the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 was delayed until November 1933. It was at that time announced that Heisenberg had won the Prize for 1932 &quot;for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has, inter alia, led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen&quot;.

===Interpretation of quantum theory===

The development of quantum mechanics, and the apparently contradictory implications in regard to what is &quot;real&quot; had profound philosophical implications, including what scientific observations truly mean. In contrast to Albert Einstein and Louis de Broglie, who were realists who believed that particles had an objectively true momentum and position at all times (even if both could not be measured), Heisenberg was an anti-realist, arguing that direct knowledge of what is &quot;real&quot; was beyond the scope of science. In his book &quot;The Physicist&#x27;s Conception of Nature&quot;, Heisenberg argued that ultimately we only can speak of the &quot;knowledge&quot; (numbers in tables) which describes something about particles but we can never have any &quot;true&quot; access to the particles themselves:We can no longer speak of the behaviour of the particle independently of the process of observation. As a final consequence, the natural laws formulated mathematically in quantum theory no longer deal with the elementary particles themselves but with our knowledge of them. Nor is it any longer possible to ask whether or not these particles exist in space and time objectively ...

When we speak of the picture of nature in the exact science of our age, we do not mean a picture of nature so much as a &quot;picture of our relationships with nature&quot;. ...Science no longer confronts nature as an objective observer, but sees itself as an actor in this interplay between man and nature. The scientific method of analysing, explaining and classifying has become conscious of its limitations, which arise out of the fact that by its intervention science alters and refashions the object of investigation. In other words, method and object can no longer be separated.

===&quot;SS&quot; investigation===
Shortly after the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932, Heisenberg submitted the first of three papers on his neutron-proton model of the nucleus. After Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, Heisenberg was attacked in the press as a &quot;White Jew&quot; (i.e. an Aryan who acts like a Jew). Supporters of &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot;, or German Physics (also known as Aryan Physics), launched vicious attacks against leading theoretical physicists, including Arnold Sommerfeld and Heisenberg. From the early 1930s onward, the anti-Semitic and anti-theoretical physics movement &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; had concerned itself with quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity. As applied in the university environment, political factors took priority over scholarly ability, even though its two most prominent supporters were the Nobel Laureates in Physics Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark.

There had been many failed attempts to have Heisenberg appointed as a professor at a number of German universities. His attempt to be appointed as successor to Arnold Sommerfeld failed because of opposition by the &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; movement. On 1 April 1935, the eminent theoretical physicist Sommerfeld, Heisenberg&#x27;s doctoral advisor at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen, achieved emeritus status. However, Sommerfeld stayed in his chair during the selection process for his successor, which took until 1 December 1939. The process was lengthy due to academic and political differences between the Munich Faculty&#x27;s selection and that of the Reich Education Ministry and the supporters of &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot;.

In 1935, the Munich Faculty drew up a list of candidates to replace Sommerfeld as ordinarius professor of theoretical physics and head of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Munich. The three candidates had all been former students of Sommerfeld: Heisenberg, who had received the Nobel Prize in Physics; Peter Debye, who had received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1936; and Richard Becker. The Munich Faculty was firmly behind these candidates, with Heisenberg as their first choice. However, supporters of &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; and elements in the REM had their own list of candidates, and the battle dragged on for over four years. During this time, Heisenberg came under vicious attack by the &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; supporters. One attack was published in &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot;, the newspaper of the &quot;SS&quot;, headed by Heinrich Himmler. In this, Heisenberg was called a &quot;White Jew&quot; who should be made to &quot;disappear&quot;. These attacks were taken seriously, as Jews were violently attacked and incarcerated. Heisenberg fought back with an editorial and a letter to Himmler, in an attempt to resolve the matter and regain his honour.

At one point, Heisenberg&#x27;s mother visited Himmler&#x27;s mother. The two women knew each other, as Heisenberg&#x27;s maternal grandfather and Himmler&#x27;s father were rectors and members of a Bavarian hiking club. Eventually, Himmler settled the Heisenberg affair by sending two letters, one to SS Gruppenf√ºhrer Reinhard Heydrich and one to Heisenberg, both on 21 July 1938. In the letter to Heydrich, Himmler said Germany could not afford to lose or silence Heisenberg, as he would be useful for teaching a generation of scientists. To Heisenberg, Himmler said the letter came on the recommendation of his family and he cautioned Heisenberg to make a distinction between professional physics research results and the personal and political attitudes of the involved scientists.

Wilhelm M√ºller replaced Sommerfeld at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. M√ºller was not a theoretical physicist, had not published in a physics journal, and was not a member of the German Physical Society. His appointment was considered a travesty and detrimental to educating theoretical physicists.

The three investigators who led the SS investigation of Heisenberg had training in physics. Indeed, Heisenberg had participated in the doctoral examination of one of them at the Universit√§t Leipzig. The most influential of the three was Johannes Juilfs. During their investigation, they became supporters of Heisenberg as well as his position against the ideological policies of the &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; movement in theoretical physics and academia.

==German nuclear weapons program==
===Pre-war work on physics===
In mid-1936, Heisenberg presented his theory of cosmic-ray showers in two papers. Four more papers appeared in the next two years.

In December 1938, the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann sent a manuscript to &quot;The Natural Sciences&quot; reporting they had detected the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons, leading Hahn to conclude that a &quot;bursting&quot; of the uranium nucleus had occurred; simultaneously, Hahn communicated these results to his friend Lise Meitner, who had in July of that year fled, first to the Netherlands, then to Sweden. Meitner, and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch, correctly interpreted Hahn&#x27;s and Strassmann&#x27;s results as being nuclear fission. Frisch confirmed this experimentally on 13 January 1939.

In June and July 1939, Heisenberg traveled to the United States visiting Samuel Abraham Goudsmit at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. However, Heisenberg refused an invitation to emigrate to the United States. He did not see Goudsmit again until six years later, when Goudsmit was the chief scientific advisor to the American Operation Alsos at the close of World War II.

===Membership in the Uranverein===
The German nuclear weapons program, known as &quot;Uranverein&quot;, was formed on 1 September 1939, the day World War II began in Europe. The &quot;Heereswaffenamt&quot; (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) had squeezed the &quot;Reichsforschungsrat&quot; (RFR, Reich Research Council) out of the &quot;Reichserziehungsministerium&quot; (REM, Reich Ministry of Education) and started the formal German nuclear energy project under military auspices. The project had its first meeting on 16 September 1939. The meeting was organized by Kurt Diebner, advisor to the HWA, and held in Berlin. The invitees included Walther Bothe, Siegfried Fl√ºgge, Hans Geiger, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck, Gerhard Hoffmann, Josef Mattauch and Georg Stetter. A second meeting was held soon thereafter and included Heisenberg, Klaus Clusius, Robert D√∂pel and Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker. The &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f√ºr Physik&quot; (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics) in Berlin-Dahlem, was placed under HWA authority, with Diebner as the administrative director, and the military control of the nuclear research commenced. During the period when Diebner administered the KWIP under the HWA program, considerable personal and professional animosity developed between Diebner and Heisenberg&#x27;s inner circle, which included Karl Wirtz and Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker.
At a scientific conference on 26‚Äì28 February 1942 at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, called by the Army Weapons Office, Heisenberg presented a lecture to Reich officials on energy acquisition from nuclear fission. The lecture, entitled &quot;Die theoretischen Grundlagen f√ºr die Energiegewinnung aus der Uranspaltung&quot; (&quot;The theoretical basis for energy generation from uranium fission&quot;) was, as Heisenberg wrote after the Second World War in a letter to Samuel Goudsmit, &quot;adapted to the intelligence level of a Reich Minister&quot;, as is often done when presenting complex and cutting-edge scientific concepts to laymen. Heisenberg lectured on the enormous energy potential of nuclear fission, stating that 250 million electron volts could be released through the fission of an atomic nucleus. Heisenberg stressed that pure U-235 had to be obtained to achieve a chain reaction. He explored various ways of obtaining isotope in its pure form, including uranium enrichment and an alternative layered method of normal uranium and a moderator in a machine. This machine, he noted, could be used in practical ways to fuel vehicles, ships and submarines. Heisenberg stressed the importance of the Army Weapons Office&#x27;s financial and material support for this scientific endeavour.

A second scientific conference followed. Lectures were heard on problems of modern physics with decisive importance for the national defense and economy. The conference was attended by Bernhard Rust, the Reich Minister of Science, Education and National Culture. At the conference, Reich Minister Rust decided to take the nuclear project away from the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, and give it to the Reich Research Council.

In April 1942 the army returned the Physics Institute to the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, naming Heisenberg as Director at the Institute. Peter Debye was still director of the institute, but had gone on leave to the United States after he had refused to become a German citizen when the HWA took administrative control of the KWIP. Heisenberg still also had his department of physics at the University of Leipzig where work had been done for the &quot;Uranverein&quot; by Robert D√∂pel and his wife Klara D√∂pel.

On 4 June 1942, Heisenberg was summoned to report to Albert Speer, Germany&#x27;s Minister of Armaments, on the prospects for converting the Uranverein&#x27;s research toward developing nuclear weapons. During the meeting, Heisenberg told Speer that a bomb could not be built before 1945, because it would require significant monetary resources and number of personnel.

After the Uranverein project was placed under the leadership of the Reich Research Council, it focused on nuclear power production and thus maintained its &quot;kriegswichtig&quot; (importance for the war) status; funding therefore continued from the military. The nuclear power project was broken down into the following main areas: uranium and heavy water production, uranium isotope separation and the &quot;Uranmaschine&quot; (uranium machine, i.e., nuclear reactor). The project was then essentially split up between a number of institutes, where the directors dominated the research and set their own research agendas. The point in 1942, when the army relinquished its control of the German nuclear weapons program, was the zenith of the project relative to the number of personnel. About 70 scientists worked for the program, with about 40 devoting more than half their time to nuclear fission research. After 1942, the number of scientists working on applied nuclear fission diminished dramatically. Many of the scientists not working with the main institutes stopped working on nuclear fission and devoted their efforts to more pressing war-related work.

In September 1942, Heisenberg submitted his first paper of a three-part series on the scattering matrix, or S-matrix, in elementary particle physics. The first two papers were published in 1943 and the third in 1944. The S-matrix described only the states of incident particles in a collision process, the states of those emerging from the collision, and stable bound states; there would be no reference to the intervening states. This was the same precedent as he followed in 1925 in what turned out to be the foundation of the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics through only the use of observables.

In February 1943, Heisenberg was appointed to the Chair for Theoretical Physics at the &quot;Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t&quot; (today, the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin). In April, his election to the &quot;Preu√üische Akademie der Wissenschaften&quot; (Prussian Academy of Sciences) was approved. That same month, he moved his family to their retreat in Urfeld as Allied bombing increased in Berlin. In the summer, he dispatched the first of his staff at the &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f√ºr Physik&quot; to Hechingen and its neighboring town of Haigerloch, on the edge of the Black Forest, for the same reasons. From 18‚Äì26 October, he travelled to German-occupied Netherlands. In December 1943, Heisenberg visited German-occupied Poland.

From 24 January to 4 February 1944, Heisenberg travelled to occupied Copenhagen, after the German army confiscated Bohr&#x27;s Institute of Theoretical Physics. He made a short return trip in April. In December, Heisenberg lectured in neutral Switzerland. The United States Office of Strategic Services sent agent Moe Berg to attend the lecture carrying a pistol, with orders to shoot Heisenberg if his lecture indicated that Germany was close to completing an atomic bomb.

In January 1945, Heisenberg, with most of the rest of his staff, moved from the &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f√ºr Physik&quot; to the facilities in the Black Forest.

==Post-Second World War==
===1945: Alsos Mission===
The Alsos Mission was an Allied effort to determine if the Germans had an atomic bomb program and to exploit German atomic-related facilities, research, material resources, and scientific personnel for the benefit of the US. Personnel on this operation generally swept into areas which had just come under control of the Allied military forces, but sometimes they operated in areas still under control by German forces. Berlin had been a location of many German scientific research facilities. To limit casualties and loss of equipment, many of these facilities were dispersed to other locations in the latter years of the war. The &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f√ºr Physik&quot; (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics) had been bombed so it had mostly been moved in 1943 and 1944 to Hechingen and its neighbouring town of Haigerloch, on the edge of the Black Forest, which eventually became included in the French occupation zone. This allowed the American task force of the Alsos Mission to take into custody a large number of German scientists associated with nuclear research.

On 30 March, the Alsos Mission reached Heidelberg, where important scientists were captured including Walther Bothe, Richard Kuhn, Philipp Lenard, and Wolfgang Gentner. Their interrogation revealed that Otto Hahn was at his laboratory in Tailfingen, while Heisenberg and Max von Laue were at Heisenberg&#x27;s laboratory in Hechingen, and that the experimental natural uranium reactor that Heisenberg&#x27;s team had built in Berlin had been moved to Haigerloch. Thereafter, the main focus of the Alsos Mission was on these nuclear facilities in the W√ºrttemberg area. Heisenberg was smuggled out from Urfeld, on 3 May 1945, in an alpine operation in territory still under control by elite German forces. He was taken to Heidelberg, where, on 5 May, he met Goudsmit for the first time since the Ann Arbor visit in 1939. Germany surrendered just two days later. Heisenberg would not see his family again for eight months, as he was moved across France and Belgium and flown to England on 3 July 1945.

===1945: Reaction to Hiroshima===
Nine of the prominent German scientists who published reports in &quot;Nuclear Physics Research Reports&quot; as members of the &quot;Uranverein&quot; were captured by Operation Alsos and incarcerated in England under Operation Epsilon. Ten German scientists, including Heisenberg, were held at Farm Hall in England. The facility had been a safe house of the British foreign intelligence MI6. During their detention, their conversations were recorded. Conversations thought to be of intelligence value were transcribed and translated into English. The transcripts were released in 1992. On 6 August 1945, the scientists at Farm Hall learned from media reports that the US had dropped an atomic bomb in Hiroshima, Japan. At first, there was disbelief that a bomb had been built and dropped. In the weeks that followed, the German scientists discussed how the United States might have built the bomb.

The Farm Hall transcripts reveal that Heisenberg, along with other physicists interned at Farm Hall including Otto Hahn and Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker, were glad the Allies had won World War II. Heisenberg told other scientists that he had never contemplated a bomb, only an atomic pile to produce energy. The morality of creating a bomb for the Nazis was also discussed. Only a few of the scientists expressed genuine horror at the prospect of nuclear weapons, and Heisenberg himself was cautious in discussing the matter. On the failure of the German nuclear weapons program to build an atomic bomb, Heisenberg remarked, &quot;We wouldn&#x27;t have had the moral courage to recommend to the government in the spring of 1942 that they should employ 120,000 men just for building the thing up.&quot;

When in 1992 the transcripts were declassified, German physicist Manfred Popp analyzed the transcripts, as well as the documentation of Uranverein. When the German scientists heard about the Hiroshima bomb, Heisenberg admitted that he had never calculated the critical mass of an atomic bomb before. When he subsequently attempted to calculate the mass, he made serious calculation errors. Edward Teller and Hans Bethe saw the transcript, and drew the conclusion that Heisenberg had done it for the first time as he made similar errors as they had. Only a week later Heisenberg gave a lecture about the physics of the bomb. He correctly recognized many essential aspects, including the efficiency of the bomb, although he still underestimated it. For Popp, this is proof that Heisenberg did not spend time on a nuclear weapon during the war; on the contrary, he avoided even thinking about it.

==Post-war research career==
===Executive positions at German research institutions===
On 3 January 1946, the ten Operation Epsilon detainees were transported to Alswede in Germany. Heisenberg settled in G√∂ttingen, which was in the British zone of Allied-occupied Germany. Heisenberg immediately began to promote scientific research in Germany. Following the Kaiser Wilhelm Society&#x27;s dissolution by the Allied Control Council and the establishment of the Max Planck Society in the British zone, Heisenberg became the director of the Max Planck Institute for Physics. Max von Laue was appointed vice director, while Karl Wirtz, Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker and Ludwig Biermann joined to help Heisenberg establish the institute. Heinz Billing joined in 1950 to promote the development of electronic computing. The core research focus of the institute was cosmic radiation. The institute held a colloquium every Saturday morning.

Heisenberg together with was instrumental in the establishment of the Forschungsrat (research council). Heisenberg envisaged this council to promote the dialogue between the newly founded Federal Republic of Germany and the scientific community, based in Germany. Heisenberg was appointed president of the &quot;Forschungsrat&quot;. In 1951, the organization was fused with the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft (Emergency Association of German Science) and that same year renamed the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation). Following the merger, Heisenberg was appointed to the presidium.

In 1958, the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Physik was moved to Munich, expanded, and renamed Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Physik und Astrophysik (MPIFA). In the interim, Heisenberg and the astrophysicist Ludwig Biermann were co-directors of MPIFA. Heisenberg also became an &quot;ordentlicher Professor&quot; (ordinarius professor) at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen. Heisenberg was the sole director of MPIFA from 1960 to 1970. Heisenberg resigned his directorship of the MPIFA on 31 December 1970.

===Promotion of international scientific cooperation===
In 1951, Heisenberg agreed to become the scientific representative of the Federal Republic of Germany at the UNESCO conference, with the aim of establishing a European laboratory for nuclear physics. Heisenberg&#x27;s aim was to build a large particle accelerator, drawing on the resources and technical skills of scientists across the Western Bloc. On 1 July 1953 Heisenberg signed the convention that established CERN on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany. Although he was asked to become CERN&#x27;s founding scientific director, he declined. Instead, he was appointed chair of CERN&#x27;s science policy committee and went on to determine the scientific program at CERN.

In December 1953, Heisenberg became the president of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. During his tenure as president 550 Humboldt scholars from 78 nations received scientific research grants. Heisenberg resigned as president shortly before his death.

===Research interests===
In 1946, the German scientist Heinz Pose, head of Laboratory V in Obninsk, wrote a letter to Heisenberg inviting him to work in the USSR. The letter lauded the working conditions in the USSR and the available resources, as well as the favorable attitude of the Soviets towards German scientists. A courier hand delivered the recruitment letter, dated 18 July 1946, to Heisenberg; Heisenberg politely declined. In 1947, Heisenberg presented lectures in Cambridge, Edinburgh and Bristol. Heisenberg contributed to the understanding of the phenomenon of superconductivity with a paper in 1947 and two papers in 1948, one of them with Max von Laue.

In the period shortly after World War II, Heisenberg briefly returned to the subject of his doctoral thesis, turbulence. Three papers were published in 1948 and one in 1950. In the post-war period Heisenberg continued his interests in cosmic-ray showers with considerations on multiple production of mesons. He published three papers in 1949, two in 1952, and one in 1955.

In late 1955 to early 1956, Heisenberg gave the Gifford Lectures at St Andrews University, in Scotland, on the intellectual history of physics. The lectures were later published as &quot;Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science&quot;. During 1956 and 1957, Heisenberg was the chairman of the &quot;Arbeitskreis Kernphysik&quot; (Nuclear Physics Working Group) of the &quot;Fachkommission II &quot;Forschung und Nachwuchs&quot;&quot; (Commission II &quot;Research and Growth&quot;) of the &quot;Deutsche Atomkommission&quot; (DAtK, German Atomic Energy Commission). Other members of the Nuclear Physics Working Group in both 1956 and 1957 were: Walther Bothe, Hans Kopfermann (vice-chairman), Fritz Bopp, Wolfgang Gentner, Otto Haxel, Willibald Jentschke, Heinz Maier-Leibnitz, Josef Mattauch, , Wilhelm Walcher and Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker. Wolfgang Paul was also a member of the group during 1957.

In 1957, Heisenberg was a signatory of the G√∂ttinger Manifest, taking a public stand against the Federal Republic of Germany arming itself with nuclear weapons. Heisenberg, like Pascual Jordan, thought politicians would ignore this statement by nuclear scientists. But Heisenberg believed that the G√∂ttinger Manifest would &quot;influence public opinion&quot; which politicians would have to take into account. He wrote to Walther Gerlach: &quot;We will probably have to keep coming back to this question in public for a long time because of the danger that public opinion will slacken.&quot; In 1961 Heisenberg signed the Memorandum of T√ºbingen alongside a group of scientists who had been brought together by Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker and Ludwig Raiser. A public discussion between scientists and politicians ensued. As prominent politicians, authors and socialites joined the debate on nuclear weapons, the signatories of the memorandum took a stand against &quot;the full-time intellectual nonconformists&quot;.

From 1957 onwards, Heisenberg was interested in plasma physics and the process of nuclear fusion. He also collaborated with the International Institute of Atomic Physics in Geneva. He was a member of the Institute&#x27;s scientific policy committee, and for several years was the Committee&#x27;s chair. He was one of the eight signatories of the Memorandum of T√ºbingen which called for the recognition of the Oder‚ÄìNei√üe line as the official border between Germany and Poland and spoke against a possible nuclear armament of West Germany.

In 1973, Heisenberg gave a lecture at Harvard University on the historical development of the concepts of quantum theory. On 24 March 1973 Heisenberg gave a speech before the Catholic Academy of Bavaria, accepting the Romano Guardini Prize. An English translation of his speech was published under the title &quot;Scientific and Religious Truth&quot;, a quotation from which appears in a later section of this article.

==Philosophy and worldview==
Heisenberg admired Eastern philosophy and saw parallels between it and quantum mechanics, describing himself as in &quot;complete agreement&quot; with the book &quot;The Tao of Physics&quot;. Heisenberg even went as far to state that after conversations with Rabindranath Tagore about Indian philosophy &quot;some of the ideas that seemed so crazy suddenly made much more sense&quot;. Regarding the laws of nature he remarked that &quot;the concept of &#x27;the law of nature&#x27; cannot be completely objective, the word &#x27;law&#x27; being a purely human principle&quot;.

Regarding the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Heisenberg disliked &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; but he liked &quot;very much the later ideas of Wittgenstein and his philosophy about language.&quot;

Heisenberg, a devout Christian, wrote: &quot;We can console ourselves that the good Lord God would know the position of the [subatomic] particles, thus He would let the causality principle continue to have validity&quot;, in his last letter to Albert Einstein. Einstein continued to maintain that quantum physics must be incomplete because it implies that the universe is indeterminate at a fundamental level.

In lectures given in the 1950s and later published as &quot;Physics and Philosophy&quot;, Heisenberg contended that scientific advances were leading to cultural conflicts. He stated that modern physics is &quot;part of a general historical process that tends toward a unification and a widening of our present world&quot;.

When Heisenberg accepted the in 1974, he gave a speech, which he later published under the title &quot;Scientific and Religious Truth&quot;. He mused:

Heisenberg referred to nature as &quot;God&#x27;s second book&quot; (the first being the Bible) and believed that &quot;Physics is reflection on the divine
ideas of Creation; therefore physics is divine service&quot;. This was because &quot;God created the world in accordance with his ideas of creation&quot; and humans can understand the world because &quot;Man was created as the spiritual image of God&quot;.

==Autobiography and death==
In his late sixties, Heisenberg penned his autobiography for the mass market. In 1969 the book was published in Germany, in early 1971 it was published in English and in the years thereafter in a string of other languages. Heisenberg initiated the project in 1966, when his public lectures increasingly turned to the subjects of philosophy and religion. Heisenberg had sent the manuscript for a textbook on the unified field theory to Hirzel Verlag and John Wiley &amp; Sons for publication. This manuscript, he wrote to one of his publishers, was the preparatory work for his autobiography. He structured his autobiography in themes, covering: 1) The goal of exact science, 2) The problematic of language in atomic physics, 3) Abstraction in mathematics and science, 4) The divisibility of matter or Kant&#x27;s antinomy, 5) The basic symmetry and its substantiation, and 6) Science and religion.

Heisenberg wrote his memoirs as a chain of conversations, covering the course of his life. The book became a popular success, but was regarded as troublesome by historians of science. In the preface Heisenberg wrote that he had abridged historical events, to make them more concise. At the time of publication, it was reviewed by Paul Forman in the journal &quot;Science&quot; with the comment &quot;Now here is a memoir in the form of rationally reconstructed dialogue. And the dialogue as Galileo well knew, is itself a most insidious literary device: lively, entertaining, and especially suited for insinuating opinions while yet evading responsibility for them.&quot; Few scientific memoirs had been published, but Konrad Lorenz and Adolf Portmann had penned popular books that conveyed scholarship to a wide audience. Heisenberg worked on his autobiography and published it with the Piper Verlag in Munich. Heisenberg initially proposed the title &quot;Gespr√§che im Umkreis der Atomphysik&quot; (&quot;Conversations on Atomic Physics&quot;). The autobiography was published eventually under the title &quot;Der Teil und das Ganze&quot; (&quot;The Part and the Whole&quot;). The 1971 English translation was published under the title &quot;Physics and Beyond: Encounters and Conversations&quot;.

Heisenberg died of kidney cancer at his home, on 1 February 1976. The next evening, his colleagues and friends walked in remembrance from the Institute of Physics to his home, lit a candle and placed it in front of his door. Heisenberg is buried in Munich Waldfriedhof.

In 1980 his widow, Elisabeth Heisenberg, published &quot;Das politische Leben eines Unpolitischen&quot; (&quot;The Political Life of an Apolitical Person&quot;), in which she characterized Heisenberg as &quot;first and foremost, a spontaneous person, thereafter a brilliant scientist, next a highly talented artist, and only in the fourth place, from a sense of duty, homo politicus&quot;.

==Honors and awards==
Heisenberg was awarded a number of honors:
* Honorary doctorates from the University of Brussels, the Technological University of Karlsruhe, and E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University.
* Bavarian Order of Merit
* Romano Guardini Prize
* Grand Cross for Federal Service with Star
* Pour le M√©rite (Civil Class)
* Elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1937, a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1955, and an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958.
* Member of the Academies of Sciences of G√∂ttingen, Bavaria, Saxony, Prussia, Sweden, Romania, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands (1939), Rome (Pontifical), the &quot;Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina&quot; (Halle), the Accademia dei Lincei (Rome), and the American Academy of Sciences.
* 1932 ‚Äì Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has, inter alia, led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen&quot;.
* 1933 ‚Äì &quot;Max-Planck-Medaille&quot; of the &quot;Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft&quot;

==Research reports on nuclear physics==
The following reports were published in &quot;Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte&quot; (&quot;Research Reports in Nuclear Physics&quot;), an internal publication of the German &quot;Uranverein&quot;. The reports were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied Operation Alsos and sent to the United States Atomic Energy Commission for evaluation. In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center and the American Institute of Physics.

==In popular culture==
Heisenberg&#x27;s surname is used as the primary alias for Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), the lead character in AMC&#x27;s crime drama series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, throughout White&#x27;s transformation from a high-school chemistry teacher into a meth cook and a drug kingpin. In the spin-off prequel series &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;, a German character named Werner directs the construction of the meth lab belonging to antagonist Gus Fring that Walt cooks in for much of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;.

Heisenberg was the target of an assassination by spy Moe Berg in the film &quot;The Catcher Was a Spy&quot;, based on real events. Heisenberg is also credited with building the atomic bomb used by the Axis in the Amazon TV series adaptation of the novel &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; by Philip K. Dick. Atomic bombs in this universe are referred to as Heisenberg Devices.

Daniel Craig portrayed Heisenberg in the 2002 film &quot;Copenhagen,&quot; an adaptation of Michael Frayn&#x27;s play. Matthias Schweigh√∂fer portrayed Heisenberg in the 2023 biopic &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;.

Heisenberg is the namesake of &quot;Resident Evil Village&quot; secondary antagonist Karl Heisenberg. Heisenberg&#x27;s research on ferromagnetism served as inspiration for the character&#x27;s magnetic abilities.

In the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, the &quot;Heisenberg compensator&quot; is an essential component of transporter technology to ensure the integrity of transported matter. The compensator counteracts effects of the applied characteristics identified in Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle. To accurately isolate matter prior to its entry into the transporter buffer, all particles must be located, their velocity observed, and tracked; the compensators allow this to happen.

<text>Wireless telegraphy or radiotelegraphy is the transmission of text messages by radio waves, analogous to electrical telegraphy using cables. Before about 1910, the term &quot;wireless telegraphy&quot; was also used for other experimental technologies for transmitting telegraph signals without wires. In radiotelegraphy, information is transmitted by pulses of radio waves of two different lengths called &quot;dots&quot; and &quot;dashes&quot;, which spell out text messages, usually in Morse code. In a manual system, the sending operator taps on a switch called a telegraph key which turns the transmitter on and off, producing the pulses of radio waves. At the receiver the pulses are audible in the receiver&#x27;s speaker as beeps, which are translated back to text by an operator who knows Morse code.

Radiotelegraphy was the first means of radio communication. The first practical radio transmitters and receivers invented in 1894‚Äì1895 by Guglielmo Marconi used radiotelegraphy. It continued to be the only type of radio transmission during the first few decades of radio, called the &quot;wireless telegraphy era&quot; up until World War I, when the development of amplitude modulation (AM) radiotelephony allowed sound (audio) to be transmitted by radio. Beginning about 1908, powerful transoceanic radiotelegraphy stations transmitted commercial telegram traffic between countries at rates up to 200 words per minute.

Radiotelegraphy was used for long-distance person-to-person commercial, diplomatic, and military text communication throughout the first half of the 20th century. It became a strategically important capability during the two world wars since a nation without long-distance radiotelegraph stations could be isolated from the rest of the world by an enemy cutting its submarine telegraph cables. Radiotelegraphy remains popular in amateur radio. It is also taught by the military for use in emergency communications. However, commercial radiotelegraphy is obsolete.

==Principles==

Wireless telegraphy or radiotelegraphy, commonly called CW (continuous wave), ICW (interrupted continuous wave) transmission, or on-off keying, and designated by the International Telecommunication Union as emission type A1A or A2A, is a radio communication method. It was transmitted by several different modulation methods during its history. The primitive spark-gap transmitters used until 1920 transmitted damped waves, which had very wide bandwidth and tended to interfere with other transmissions. This type of emission was banned by 1934, except for some legacy use on ships. The vacuum tube (valve) transmitters which came into use after 1920 transmitted code by pulses of unmodulated sinusoidal carrier wave called continuous wave (CW), which is still used today. To receive CW transmissions, the receiver requires a circuit called a beat frequency oscillator (BFO). The third type of modulation, frequency-shift keying (FSK) was used mainly by radioteletype networks (RTTY). Morse code radiotelegraphy was gradually replaced by radioteletype in most high volume applications by World War II.

In manual radiotelegraphy the sending operator manipulates a switch called a telegraph key, which turns the radio transmitter on and off, producing pulses of unmodulated carrier wave of different lengths called &quot;dots&quot; and &quot;dashes&quot;, which encode characters of text in Morse code. At the receiving location, Morse code is audible in the receiver&#x27;s earphone or speaker as a sequence of buzzes or beeps, which is translated back to text by an operator who knows Morse code. With automatic radiotelegraphy teleprinters at both ends use a code such as the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 and produced typed text.

Radiotelegraphy is obsolete in commercial radio communication, and its last civilian use, requiring maritime shipping radio operators to use Morse code for emergency communications, ended in 1999 when the International Maritime Organization switched to the satellite-based GMDSS system. However it is still used by amateur radio operators, and military services require signalmen to be trained in Morse code for emergency communication. A CW coastal station, KSM, still exists in California, run primarily as a museum by volunteers, and occasional contacts with ships are made. In a minor legacy use, VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) and NDB radio beacons in the aviation radio navigation service still transmit their one to three letter identifiers in Morse code.

Radiotelegraphy is popular amongst radio amateurs world-wide, who commonly refer to it as continuous wave, or just CW. A 2021 analysis of over 700 million communications logged by the Club Log blog, and a similar review of data logged by the American Radio Relay League, both show that wireless telegraphy is the 2nd most popular mode of amateur radio communication, accounting for nearly 20% of contacts. This makes it more popular than voice communication, but not as popular as the FT8 digital mode, which accounted for 60% of amateur radio contacts made in 2021. Since 2003, knowledge of Morse code and wireless telegraphy has no longer been required to obtain an amateur radio license in many countries, it is, however, still required in some countries to obtain a licence of a different class. As of 2021, licence Class A in Belarus and Estonia, or the General class in Monaco, or Class 1 in Ukraine require Morse proficiency to access the full amateur radio spectrum including the high frequency (HF) bands. Further, CEPT Class 1 licence in Ireland, and Class 1 in Russia, both of which require proficiency in wireless telegraphy, offer additional privileges: a shorter and more desirable call sign in both countries, and the right to use a higher transmit power in Russia.

==History==


Efforts to find a way to transmit telegraph signals without wires grew out of the success of electric telegraph networks, the first instant telecommunication systems. Developed beginning in the 1830s, a telegraph line was a person-to-person text message system consisting of multiple telegraph offices linked by an overhead wire supported on telegraph poles. To send a message, an operator at one office would tap on a switch called a telegraph key, creating pulses of electric current which spelled out a message in Morse code. When the key was pressed, it would connect a battery to the telegraph line, sending current down the wire. At the receiving office, the current pulses would operate a telegraph sounder, a device that would make a &quot;click&quot; sound when it received each pulse of current. The operator at the receiving station who knew Morse code would translate the clicking sounds to text and write down the message. The ground was used as the return path for current in the telegraph circuit, to avoid having to use a second overhead wire.

By the 1860s, the telegraph was the standard way to send most urgent commercial, diplomatic and military messages, and industrial nations had built continent-wide telegraph networks, with submarine telegraph cables allowing telegraph messages to bridge oceans. However installing and maintaining a telegraph line linking distant stations was very expensive, and wires could not reach some locations such as ships at sea. Inventors realized if a way could be found to send electrical impulses of Morse code between separate points without a connecting wire, it could revolutionize communications.

The successful solution to this problem was the discovery of radio waves in 1887, and the development of practical radiotelegraphy transmitters and receivers by about 1899.

Over several years starting in 1894, the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi worked on adapting the newly discovered phenomenon of radio waves to communication, turning what was essentially a laboratory experiment up to that point into a useful communication system, building the first radiotelegraphy system using them. Preece and the General Post Office (GPO) in Britain at first supported and gave financial backing to Marconi&#x27;s experiments conducted on Salisbury Plain from 1896. Preece had become convinced of the idea through his experiments with wireless induction. However, the backing was withdrawn when Marconi formed the Wireless Telegraph &amp; Signal Company. GPO lawyers determined that the system was a telegraph under the meaning of the Telegraph Act and thus fell under the Post Office monopoly. This did not seem to hold back Marconi. After Marconi sent wireless telegraphic signals across the Atlantic Ocean in 1901, the system began being used for regular communication including ship-to-shore and ship-to-ship communication.

With this development, wireless telegraphy came to mean &quot;radiotelegraphy&quot;, Morse code transmitted by radio waves. The first radio transmitters, primitive spark gap transmitters used until World War I, could not transmit voice (audio signals). Instead, the operator would send the text message on a telegraph key, which turned the transmitter on and off, producing short (&quot;dot&quot;) and long (&quot;dash&quot;) pulses of radio waves, groups of which comprised the letters and other symbols of the Morse code. At the receiver, the signals could be heard as musical &quot;beeps&quot; in the earphones by the receiving operator, who would translate the code back into text. By 1910, communication by what had been called &quot;Hertzian waves&quot; was being universally referred to as &quot;radio&quot;, and the term wireless telegraphy has been largely replaced by the more modern term &quot;radiotelegraphy&quot;.

==Methods==
The primitive spark-gap transmitters used until 1920 transmitted by a modulation method called damped wave. As long as the telegraph key was pressed, the transmitter would produce a string of transient pulses of radio waves which repeated at an audio rate, usually between 50 and several thousand hertz. In a receiver&#x27;s earphone, this sounded like a musical tone, rasp or buzz. Thus the Morse code &quot;dots&quot; and &quot;dashes&quot; sounded like beeps. Damped wave had a large frequency bandwidth, meaning that the radio signal was not a single frequency but occupied a wide band of frequencies. Damped wave transmitters had a limited range and interfered with the transmissions of other transmitters on adjacent frequencies.

After 1905 new types of radiotelegraph transmitters were invented which transmitted code using a new modulation method: continuous wave (CW) (designated by the International Telecommunication Union as emission type A1A). As long as the telegraph key was pressed, the transmitter produced a continuous sinusoidal wave of constant amplitude. Since all the radio wave&#x27;s energy was concentrated at a single frequency, CW transmitters could transmit further with a given power, and also caused virtually no interference to transmissions on adjacent frequencies. The first transmitters able to produce continuous wave were the arc converter (Poulsen arc) transmitter, invented by Danish engineer Valdemar Poulsen in 1903, and the Alexanderson alternator, invented 1906‚Äì1912 by Reginald Fessenden and Ernst Alexanderson. These slowly replaced the spark transmitters in high power radiotelegraphy stations.

However, the radio receivers used for damped wave could not receive continuous wave. Because the CW signal produced while the key was pressed was just an unmodulated carrier wave, it made no sound in a receiver&#x27;s earphones. To receive a CW signal, some way had to be found to make the Morse code carrier wave pulses audible in a receiver.

This problem was solved by Reginald Fessenden in 1901. In his &quot;heterodyne&quot; receiver, the incoming radiotelegraph signal is mixed in the receiver&#x27;s detector crystal or vacuum tube with a constant sine wave generated by an electronic oscillator in the receiver called a beat frequency oscillator (BFO). The frequency of the oscillator formula_1 is offset from the radio transmitter&#x27;s frequency formula_2. In the detector the two frequencies subtract, and a beat frequency (heterodyne) at the difference between the two frequencies is produced: formula_3. If the BFO frequency is near enough to the radio station&#x27;s frequency, the beat frequency is in the audio frequency range and can be heard in the receiver&#x27;s earphones. During the &quot;dots&quot; and &quot;dashes&quot; of the signal, the beat tone is produced, while between them there is no carrier so no tone is produced. Thus the Morse code is audible as musical &quot;beeps&quot; in the earphones.

The BFO was rare until the invention in 1913 of the first practical electronic oscillator, the vacuum tube feedback oscillator by Edwin Armstrong. After this time BFOs were a standard part of radiotelegraphy receivers. Each time the radio was tuned to a different station frequency, the BFO frequency had to be changed also, so the BFO oscillator had to be tunable. In later superheterodyne receivers from the 1930s on, the BFO signal was mixed with the constant intermediate frequency (IF) produced by the superheterodyne&#x27;s detector. Therefore, the BFO could be a fixed frequency.

Continuous-wave vacuum tube transmitters replaced the other types of transmitter with the availability of power tubes after World War I because they were cheap. CW became the standard method of transmitting radiotelegraphy by the 20s, damped wave spark transmitters were banned by 1930 and CW continues to be used today. Even today most communications receivers produced for use in shortwave communication stations have BFOs.

==Industry==
The International Radiotelegraph Union was unofficially established at the first International Radiotelegraph Convention in 1906, and was merged into the International Telecommunication Union in 1932. When the United States entered World War I, private radiotelegraphy stations were prohibited, which put an end to several pioneers&#x27; work in this field. By the 1920s, there was a worldwide network of commercial and government radiotelegraphic stations, plus extensive use of radiotelegraphy by ships for both commercial purposes and passenger messages. The transmission of sound (radiotelephony) began to displace radiotelegraphy by the 1920s for many applications, making possible radio broadcasting. Wireless telegraphy continued to be used for private person-to-person business, governmental, and military communication, such as telegrams and diplomatic communications, and evolved into radioteletype networks. The ultimate implementation of wireless telegraphy was telex, using radio signals, which was developed in the 1930s and was for many years the only reliable form of communication between many distant countries. The most advanced standard, CCITT R.44, automated both routing and encoding of messages by short wave transmissions.

Today, due to more modern text transmission methods, Morse code radiotelegraphy for commercial use has become obsolete. On shipboard, the computer and satellite-linked GMDSS system have largely replaced Morse as a means of communication.

==Regulation==
Continuous wave (CW) radiotelegraphy is regulated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as emission type A1A.

The US Federal Communications Commission issues a lifetime commercial Radiotelegraph Operator License. This requires passing a simple written test on regulations, a more complex written exam on technology, and demonstrating Morse reception at 20 words per minute plain language and 16 wpm code groups. (Credit is given for amateur extra class licenses earned under the old 20 wpm requirement.)

<doc id="33132" wikidata="Q163415" url="?curid=33132" title="William Shockley">
<text>William Bradford Shockley Jr. (February 13, 1910 ‚Äì August 12, 1989) was an American inventor, physicist, and eugenicist. He was the manager of a research group at Bell Labs that included John Bardeen and Walter Brattain. The three scientists were jointly awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for &quot;their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect&quot;.

Partly as a result of Shockley&#x27;s attempts to commercialize a new transistor design in the 1950s and 1960s, California&#x27;s Silicon Valley became a hotbed of electronics innovation. He recruited brilliant employees, but quickly alienated them with his autocratic and erratic management; they left and founded major companies in the industry. 

In his later life, while a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University and afterward, Shockley became known as a racist and eugenicist.
==Early life and education==
Shockley was born to American parents in London on February 13, 1910, and was raised in his family&#x27;s hometown of Palo Alto, California, from the age of three. His father, William Hillman Shockley, was a mining engineer who speculated in mines for a living and spoke eight languages. His mother, May (n√©e Bradford), grew up in the American West, graduated from Stanford University and became the first female U.S. Deputy mining surveyor. Shockley was homeschooled up to the age of eight, due to his parents&#x27; dislike of public schools as well as Shockley&#x27;s habit of violent tantrums. Shockley learned a little physics at a young age from a neighbor who was a Stanford physics professor. Shockley spent two years at Palo Alto Military Academy, then briefly enrolled in the Los Angeles Coaching School to study physics and later graduated from Hollywood High School in 1927.

Shockley earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Caltech in 1932 and a PhD from MIT in 1936. The title of his doctoral thesis was &quot;Electronic Bands in Sodium Chloride&quot;, a topic suggested by his thesis advisor, John C. Slater.

==Career==
Shockley was one of the first recruits to Bell Labs by Mervin Kelly, who became director of research at the company in 1936 and focused on hiring solid-state physicists. Shockley joined a group headed by Clinton Davisson in Murray Hill, New Jersey. Executives at Bell Labs had theorized that semiconductors may offer solid-state alternatives to the vacuum tubes used throughout Bell&#x27;s nationwide telephone system. Shockley conceived a number of designs based on copper-oxide semiconductor materials, and with Walter Brattain unsuccessfully attempted to create a prototype in 1939.

Shockley published a number of fundamental papers on solid state physics in &quot;Physical Review&quot;. In 1938, he received his first patent, &quot;Electron Discharge Device&quot;, on electron multipliers.When World War II broke out, Shockley&#x27;s prior research was interrupted and he became involved in radar research in Manhattan (New York City). In May 1942, he took leave from Bell Labs to become a research director at Columbia University&#x27;s Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Group. This involved devising methods for countering the tactics of submarines with improved convoying techniques, optimizing depth charge patterns, and so on. Shockley traveled frequently to the Pentagon and Washington to meet high-ranking officers and government officials.
In 1944, he organized a training program for B-29 bomber pilots to use new radar bomb sights. In late 1944, he took a three-month tour to bases around the world to assess the results. For this project, Secretary of War Robert Patterson awarded Shockley the Medal for Merit on October 17, 1946.

In July 1945, the War Department asked Shockley to prepare a report on the question of probable casualties from an invasion of the Japanese mainland. Shockley concluded:

This report influenced the decision of the United States to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which preceded the surrender of Japan.

Shockley was the first physicist to propose a log-normal distribution to model the creation process for scientific research papers.

===Development of the transistor===
Shortly after the war ended in 1945, Bell Labs formed a solid-state physics group, led by Shockley and chemist Stanley Morgan, which included John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, physicist Gerald Pearson, chemist Robert Gibney, electronics expert Hilbert Moore, and several technicians. Their assignment was to seek a solid-state alternative to fragile glass vacuum tube amplifiers. First attempts were based on Shockley&#x27;s ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity. These experiments failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials. The group was at a standstill until Bardeen suggested a theory that invoked surface states that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor. The group changed its focus to study these surface states and they met almost daily to discuss the work. The group had excellent rapport and freely exchanged ideas.

By the winter of 1946 they had enough results that Bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to &quot;Physical Review&quot;. Brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductor&#x27;s surface. This led to several more papers (one of them co-authored with Shockley), which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments. The pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with electrolytes. Moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily. Finally they began to get some evidence of power amplification when Pearson, acting on a suggestion by Shockley, put a voltage on a droplet of glycol borate placed across a p‚Äìn junction.
Bell Labs&#x27; attorneys soon discovered Shockley&#x27;s field effect principle had been anticipated and devices based on it patented in 1930 by Julius Lilienfeld, who filed his MESFET-like patent in Canada on October 22, 1925. Although the patent appeared &quot;breakable&quot; (it could not work) the patent attorneys based one of its four patent applications only on the Bardeen-Brattain point contact design. Three others (submitted first) covered the electrolyte-based transistors with Bardeen, Gibney and Brattain as the inventors.

Shockley&#x27;s name was not on any of these patent applications. This angered Shockley, who thought his name should also be on the patents because the work was based on his field effect idea. He even made efforts to have the patent written only in his name, and told Bardeen and Brattain of his intentions.

Shockley, angered by not being included on the patent applications, secretly continued his own work to build a different sort of transistor based on junctions instead of point contacts; he expected this kind of design would be more likely to be commercially viable. The point contact transistor, he believed, would prove to be fragile and difficult to manufacture. Shockley was also dissatisfied with certain parts of the explanation for how the point contact transistor worked and conceived of the possibility of minority carrier injection.

On February 13, 1948, another team member, John N. Shive, built a point contact transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of a thin wedge of germanium, proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought. Shive&#x27;s invention sparked Shockley&#x27;s invention of the junction transistor. A few months later he invented an entirely new, considerably more robust, type of transistor with a layer or &#x27;sandwich&#x27; structure. This structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the 1960s, and evolved into the bipolar junction transistor. Shockley later described the workings of the team as a &quot;mixture of cooperation and competition&quot;. He also said that he kept some of his own work secret until his &quot;hand was forced&quot; by Shive&#x27;s 1948 advance. Shockley worked out a rather complete description of what he called the &quot;sandwich&quot; transistor, and a first proof of principle was obtained on April 7, 1949.

Meanwhile, Shockley worked on his magnum opus, &quot;Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors&quot; which was published as a 558-page treatise in 1950. The tome included Shockley&#x27;s critical ideas of drift and diffusion and the differential equations that govern the flow of electrons in solid state crystals. Shockley&#x27;s diode equation is also described. This seminal work became the reference text for other scientists working to develop and improve new variants of the transistor and other devices based on semiconductors.

This resulted in his invention of the bipolar &quot;junction transistor&quot;, which was announced at a press conference on July 4, 1951.

In 1951, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). He was forty-one years old; this was rather young for such an election. Two years later, he was chosen as the recipient of the prestigious Comstock Prize for Physics by the NAS, and was the recipient of many other awards and honors.

The ensuing publicity generated by the &quot;invention of the transistor&quot; often thrust Shockley to the fore, much to the chagrin of Bardeen and Brattain. Bell Labs management, however, consistently presented all three inventors as a team. Though Shockley would correct the record where reporters gave him sole credit for the invention, he eventually infuriated and alienated Bardeen and Brattain, and he essentially blocked the two from working on the junction transistor. Bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left Bell Labs in 1951. Brattain refused to work with Shockley further and was assigned to another group. Neither Bardeen nor Brattain had much to do with the development of the transistor beyond the first year after its invention.

Shockley left Bell Labs around 1953 and took a job at Caltech.

Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956.

===Shockley Semiconductor===

In 1956, Shockley started Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in Mountain View, California, which was close to his elderly mother in Palo Alto, California. The company, a division of Beckman Instruments, Inc., was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as Silicon Valley.

Shockley recruited brilliant employees to his company, but alienated them by undermining them relentlessly. &quot;He may have been the worst manager in the history of electronics&quot;, according to his biographer Joel Shurkin. Shockley was autocratic, domineering, erratic, hard-to-please, and increasingly paranoid. In one well-known incident, he demanded lie detector tests to find the &quot;culprit&quot; after a company secretary suffered a minor cut. In late 1957, eight of Shockley&#x27;s best researchers, who would come to be known as the &quot;traitorous eight&quot;, resigned after Shockley decided not to continue research into silicon-based semiconductors. They went on to form Fairchild Semiconductor, a loss from which Shockley Semiconductor never recovered and which led to its purchase by another company three years later. Over the course of the next 20 years, more than 65 new enterprises would end up having employee connections back to Fairchild.

A group of about thirty colleagues have met on and off since 1956 to reminisce about their time with Shockley, &quot;the man who brought silicon to Silicon Valley&quot;, as the group&#x27;s organizer said in 2002.

==Racist and eugenicist views==

After Shockley left his role as director of Shockley Semiconductor, he joined Stanford University, where he was appointed the Alexander M. Poniatoff Professor of Engineering and Applied Science in 1963, a position which he held until he retired as a professor emeritus in 1975.

In the last two decades of his life, Shockley, who had no degree in genetics, became widely known for his extreme views on race and human intelligence, and his advocacy of eugenics. As described by his &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; obituary, &quot;He went from being a physicist with impeccable academic credentials to amateur geneticist, becoming a lightning rod whose views sparked campus demonstrations and a cascade of calumny&quot;. He thought his work was important to the future of humanity and he also described it as the most important aspect of his career. He argued that a higher rate of reproduction among purportedly less intelligent people was having a dysgenic effect, and argued that a drop in average intelligence would lead to a decline in civilization. He also claimed that black people were genetically and intellectually inferior to white people. 

Shockley&#x27;s biographer Joel Shurkin notes that for much of Shockley&#x27;s life in the racially segregated United States of the time, he had almost no contact with black people. In a debate with psychiatrist Frances Cress Welsing and on &quot;Firing Line&quot; with William F. Buckley Jr., Shockley argued, &quot;My research leads me inescapably to the opinion that the major cause of the American Negro&#x27;s intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and racially genetic in origin and, thus, not remediable to a major degree by practical improvements in the environment&quot;.

Shockley was one of the race theorists who received money from the Pioneer Fund, and at least one donation to him came from its founder, the eugenicist Wickliffe Draper. Shockley proposed that individuals with IQs below 100 should be paid to undergo voluntary sterilization, $1,000 for each of their IQ points under 100. This proposal led to the University of Leeds to withdraw its offer of an honorary degree to him. Anthropologist and far-right activist Roger Pearson defended Shockley in a self-published book co-authored with Shockley. In 1973, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee professor Edgar G. Epps argued that &quot;William Shockley&#x27;s position lends itself to racist interpretations&quot;. The Southern Poverty Law Center describes Shockley as a white nationalist who failed to produce evidence for his eugenic theories amidst &quot;near-universal acknowledgement that his work was that of a racist crank&quot;. The science writer Angela Saini describes Shockley as having been &quot;a notorious racist&quot;.

Shockley insisted that he was not a racist. He wrote that his findings do not support white supremacy, instead claiming that East Asians and Jews fare better than whites intellectually. In 1973, Edgar Epps wrote that &quot;I am pleased that Professor Shockley is not an Aryan supremacist, but I would remind him that a theory espousing hereditary superiority of Orientals or Jews is just as racist in nature as the Aryan supremacy doctrine&quot;.

Shockley&#x27;s advocacy of eugenics triggered protests. In one incident, the science society Sigma Xi, fearing violence, canceled a 1968 convocation in Brooklyn where Shockley was scheduled to speak.

In Atlanta in 1981, Shockley filed a libel suit against the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; after a science writer, Roger Witherspoon, compared Shockley&#x27;s advocacy of a voluntary sterilization program to Nazi human experimentation. The suit took three years to go to trial. Shockley won the suit but he only received one dollar in damages and he did not receive any punitive damages. Shockley&#x27;s biographer Joel Shurkin, a science writer on the staff of Stanford University during those years, sums this statement up by saying that it was defamatory, but Shockley&#x27;s reputation was not worth much by the time the trial reached a verdict. Shockley taped his telephone conversations with reporters, transcribed them, and sent the transcripts to the reporters by registered mail. At one point, he toyed with the idea of making the reporters take a simple quiz on his work before he would discuss the subject matter of it with them. His habit of saving all of his papers (including laundry lists) provides abundant documentation on his life for researchers.

Shockley was a candidate for the Republican nomination in the 1982 United States Senate election in California. He ran on a single-issue platform of opposing the &quot;dysgenic threat&quot; that he alleged African-Americans and other groups posed. He came in eighth place in the primary, receiving 8,308 votes and 0.37% of the vote. According to Shurkin, by this time, &quot;His racism destroyed his credibility. Almost no one wanted to be associated with him, and many of those who were willing did him more harm than good&quot;.

===Foundation for Research and Education on Eugenics and Dysgenics===
Foundation for Research and Education on Eugenics and Dysgenics (FREED) was a non-profit organization founded in March 1970 in the United States formed to support the research of Shockley, who was the president of the foundation and R. Travis Osborne, a member. The foundation released newsletter &#x27;FREED&#x27; and research papers at Stanford University.

The organization was founded according to its mission &quot;solely for scientific and educational purposes related to human population and quality problems&quot;.

From 1969 to 1976, the Pioneer Fund allocated about $2.5 million (adjusted-for-inflation in 2023) to support Shockley&#x27;s endeavors. This funding was distributed through grants to Stanford University for the exploration of &quot;research into the factors which affect genetic potential&quot; and also directly to FREED.&lt;ref name=&quot;fighting-hate/extremist&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Via FREED, Shockley promoted his concept of a &quot;Voluntary Sterilization Bonus Plan&quot;, proposing to compensate economically disadvantaged women for undergoing sterilization procedures.

In 1970, Shockley listed former senator of Alaska Ernest Gruening as a director of FREED.

==Personal life==
At age 23 and while still a student, Shockley married Jean Bailey in August 1933. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Shockley separated from her in 1953. He married Emily Lanning, a psychiatric nurse, in 1955; she helped him with some of his theories. Although one of his sons earned a PhD at Stanford University and his daughter graduated from Radcliffe College, Shockley believed his children &quot;represent a very significant regression ... my first wife ‚Äì their mother ‚Äì had not as high an academic-achievement standing as I had&quot;.

Shockley was an accomplished rock climber, going often to the Shawangunks in the Hudson River Valley. His route across an overhang, known as &quot;Shockley&#x27;s Ceiling&quot;, is one of the classic climbing routes in the area. Mountain Project, a web-based climbing guidebook, changed the route&#x27;s name to &quot;The Ceiling&quot; in 2020 due to Shockley&#x27;s eugenics controversies. He was popular as a speaker, lecturer, and amateur magician. He once &quot;magically&quot; produced a bouquet of roses at the end of his address before the American Physical Society. He was also known in his early years for elaborate practical jokes. He had a longtime hobby of raising ant colonies.

Shockley donated sperm to the Repository for Germinal Choice, a sperm bank founded by Robert Klark Graham in hopes of spreading humanity&#x27;s best genes. The bank, called by the media the &quot;Nobel Prize sperm bank&quot;, claimed to have three Nobel Prize-winning donors, though Shockley was the only one to publicly acknowledge his involvement. However, Shockley&#x27;s controversial views brought the Repository for Germinal Choice a degree of notoriety and may have discouraged other Nobel Prize winners from donating sperm.

According to PBS, Shockley was cruel towards his children and unhappy in his life. He reportedly tried playing Russian roulette as part of an attempted suicide.

===Death===
Shockley died of prostate cancer in 1989 at the age of 79. At the time of his death, he was estranged from most of his friends and family, except his second wife, the former Emmy Lanning (1913‚Äì2007). His children reportedly learned of his death by reading his obituary in the newspaper. Shockley is interred at Alta Mesa Memorial Park in Palo Alto, California.

<text>Walter Houser Brattain (; February 10, 1902 ‚Äì October 13, 1987) was an American physicist who shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics with John Bardeen and William Shockley for their invention of the point-contact transistor. Brattain devoted much of his life to research on surface states.

== Biography ==
Walter Brattain was born in Amoy (now Xiamen), Fujian, Qing China, to American parents Ross R. Brattain and Ottilie Houser Brattain. His father was of Scottish descent, while his mother&#x27;s parents were both immigrants from Stuttgart, Germany. Ross R. Brattain was a teacher at the Ting-Wen Institute, a private school for Chinese boys; Ottilie Houser Brattain was a gifted mathematician. Both were graduates of Whitman College. Ottilie and baby Walter returned to the United States in 1903, and Ross followed shortly afterward. The family lived for several years in Spokane, Washington, then settled on a cattle ranch near Tonasket, Washington in 1911.

Brattain attended high school in Washington, spending one year at Queen Anne High School in Seattle, two years at Tonasket High School, and one year at Moran School for Boys on Bainbridge Island. Brattain then attended Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, where he studied with Benjamin H. Brown (physics) and Walter A. Bratton (mathematics). He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Whitman in 1924, with a double major in physics and mathematics. Brattain and his classmates Walker Bleakney, Vladimir Rojansky and E. John Workman would all go on to have distinguished careers, later becoming known as &quot;the four horsemen of physics&quot;. Brattain&#x27;s brother Robert, who followed him at Whitman College, also became a physicist.

Brattain earned a Master of Arts from the University of Oregon in Eugene in 1926, and a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1929. At Minnesota, Brattain had the opportunity to study the new field of quantum mechanics under John Hasbrouck Van Vleck. His thesis, supervised by John T. Tate, was &quot;Efficiency of Excitation by Electron Impact and Anomalous Scattering in Mercury Vapor.&quot;

Walter Brattain married twice. His first wife was chemist Keren Gilmore. They were married in 1935 and had a son, William G. Brattain, in 1943. Keren Gilmore Brattain died on April 10, 1957. The following year, Brattain married Mrs. Emma Jane (Kirsch) Miller, a mother of three children.

He moved to Seattle in the 1970s and lived there until his death from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on October 13, 1987. He is buried at City Cemetery in Pomeroy, Washington.

==Scientific work==

From 1927 to 1928 Brattain worked for the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., where he helped to develop piezoelectric frequency standards. In August 1929 he joined Joseph A. Becker at Bell Telephone Laboratories as a research physicist. The two men worked on the heat-induced flow of charge carriers in copper oxide rectifiers. Brattain was able to attend a lecture by Arnold Sommerfeld. Some of their subsequent experiments on thermionic emission provided experimental validation for the Sommerfeld theory. They also did work on the surface state and work function of tungsten and the adsorption of thorium atoms. Through his studies of rectification and photo-effects on the semiconductor surfaces of cuprous oxide and silicon, Brattain discovered the photo-effect at the free surface of a semiconductor. This work was considered by the Nobel prize committee to be one of his chief contributions to solid state physics.

At the time, the telephone industry was heavily dependent on the use of vacuum tubes to control electron flow and amplify current. Vacuum tubes were neither reliable nor efficient, and Bell Laboratories wanted to develop an alternative technology. As early as the 1930s Brattain worked with William B. Shockley on the idea of a semiconductor amplifier that used copper oxide, an early and unsuccessful attempt at creating a field effect transistor. Other researchers at Bell and elsewhere were also experimenting with semiconductors, using materials such as germanium and silicon, but the pre-war research effort was somewhat haphazard and lacked strong theoretical grounding.

During World War II, both Brattain and Shockley were separately involved in research on magnetic detection of submarines with the National Defense Research Committee at Columbia University. Brattain&#x27;s group developed magnetometers sensitive enough to detect anomalies in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field caused by submarines. As a result of this work, in 1944, Brattain patented a design for a magnetometer head.

In 1945, Bell Labs reorganized and created a group specifically to do fundamental research in solid state physics, relating to communications technologies. Creation of the sub-department was authorized by the vice-president for research, Mervin Kelly. An interdisciplinary group, it was co-led by Shockley and Stanley O. Morgan. The new group was soon joined by John Bardeen. Bardeen was a close friend of Brattain&#x27;s brother Robert, who had introduced John and Walter in the 1930s. They often played bridge and golf together. Bardeen was a quantum physicist, Brattain a gifted experimenter in materials science, and Shockley, the leader of their team, was an expert in solid-state physics.


According to theories of the time, Shockley&#x27;s field effect transistor, a cylinder coated thinly with silicon and mounted close to a metal plate, should have worked. He ordered Brattain and Bardeen to find out why it wouldn&#x27;t. During November and December the two men carried out a variety of experiments, attempting to determine why Shockley&#x27;s device wouldn&#x27;t amplify. Bardeen was a brilliant theorist; Brattain, equally importantly, &quot;had an intuitive feel for what you could do in semiconductors&quot;. Bardeen theorized that the failure to conduct might be the result of local variations in the surface state which trapped the charge carriers. Brattain and Bardeen eventually managed to create a small level of amplification by pushing a gold metal point into the silicon, and surrounding it with distilled water. Replacing silicon with germanium enhanced the amplification, but only for low frequency currents.

On December 16, Brattain devised a method of placing two gold leaf contacts close together on a germanium surface. Brattain reported: &quot;Using this double point contact, contact was made to a germanium surface that had been anodized to 90 volts, electrolyte washed off in H2O and then had some gold spots evaporated on it. The gold contacts were pressed down on the bare surface. Both gold contacts to the surface rectified nicely... One point was used as a grid and the other point as a plate. The bias (D.C.) on the grid had to be positive to get amplification&quot;

As described by Bardeen, &quot;The initial experiments with the gold spot suggested immediately that holes were being introduced into the germanium block, increasing the concentration of holes near the surface. The names emitter and collector were chosen to describe this phenomenon. The only question was how the charge of the added holes was compensated. Our first thought was that the charge was compensated by surface states. Shockley later suggested that the charge was compensated by electrons in the bulk and suggested the junction transistor geometry... Later experiments carried out by Brattain and me showed that very likely both occur in the point-contact transistor.&quot;

On December 23, 1947, Walter Brattain, John Bardeen, and William B. Shockley demonstrated the first working transistor to their colleagues at Bell Laboratories. Amplifying small electrical signals and supporting the processing of digital information, the transistor is &quot;the key enabler of modern electronics&quot;. The three men received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956 &quot;for research on semiconductors and the discovery of the transistor effect.&quot;

Convinced by the 1947 demonstration that a major breakthrough was being made, Bell Laboratories focused intensively on what it now called the &quot;Surface States Project&quot;. Initially, strict secrecy was observed. Carefully restricted internal conferences within Bell Labs shared information about the work of Brattain, Bardeen, Shockley and others who were engaged in related research. Patents were registered, recording the invention of the point-contact transistor by Bardeen and Brattain. There was considerable anxiety over whether Ralph Bray and Seymour Benzer, studying resistance in germanium at Purdue University, might make a similar discovery and publish before Bell Laboratories.

On June 30, 1948, Bell Laboratories held a press conference to publicly announce their discovery. They also adopted an open policy in which new knowledge was freely shared with other institutions. By doing so, they avoided classification of the work as a military secret, and made possible widespread research and development of transistor technology. Bell Laboratories organized several symposia, open to university, industry and military participants, which were attended by hundreds of scientists in September 1951, April 1952, and 1956. Representatives from international as well as domestic companies attended.

Shockley believed (and stated) that he should have received all the credit for the discovery of the transistor. He actively excluded Bardeen and Brattain from new areas of research, in particular the junction transistor, which Shockley patented. Shockley&#x27;s theory of the junction transistor was an &quot;impressive achievement&quot;, pointing the way to future solid-state electronics, but it would be several years before its construction would become practically possible.

Brattain transferred to another research group within Bell Laboratories, working with C. G. B. Garrett, and P. J. Boddy. He continued to study the surface properties of solids and the &quot;transistor effect&quot;, so as to better understand the various factors underlying semiconductor behavior. Describing it as &quot;an intolerable situation&quot;, Bardeen left Bell Laboratories in 1951 to go to the University of Illinois, where he eventually won a second Nobel Prize for his theory of superconductivity. Shockley left Bell Laboratories in 1953 and went on to form the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory at Beckman Instruments.

In 1956, the three men were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics by King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden &quot;for research on semiconductors and the discovery of the transistor effect.&quot; Bardeen and Brattain were included for the discovery of the point-contact transistor; Shockley for the development of the junction transistor. Walter Brattain is credited as having said, when told of the award, &quot;I certainly appreciate the honor. It is a great satisfaction to have done something in life and to have been recognized for it in this way. However, much of my good fortune comes from being in the right place, at the right time, and having the right sort of people to work with.&quot; Each of the three gave a lecture. Brattain spoke on &quot;Surface Properties of Semiconductors&quot;, Bardeen on &quot;Semiconductor Research Leading to the Point Contact Transistor&quot;, and Shockley on &quot;Transistor Technology Evokes New Physics&quot;.

Brattain later collaborated with P. J. Boddy and P. N. Sawyer on several papers on electrochemical processes in living matter. He became interested in blood clotting after his son required heart surgery. He also collaborated with Whitman chemistry professor David Frasco, using phospholipid bilayers as a model to study the surface of living cells and their absorption processes.

==Teaching==

Brattain taught at Harvard University as a visiting lecturer in 1952 and at Whitman College as a visiting lecturer in 1962 and 1963, and a visiting professor beginning in 1963. Upon formally retiring from Bell Laboratories in 1967, he continued to teach at Whitman, becoming an adjunct professor in 1972. He retired from teaching in 1976 but continued to be a consultant at Whitman.

At Whitman, the Walter Brattain Scholarships are awarded on a merit basis to &quot;entering students who have achieved high academic excellence in their college preparatory work.&quot; All applicants for admission are considered for the scholarship, which is potentially renewable for four years.

<doc id="33134" wikidata="Q205049" url="?curid=33134" title="World music">
<text>&quot;World music&quot; is an English phrase for styles of music from non-English speaking countries, including quasi-traditional, intercultural, and traditional music. World music&#x27;s broad nature and elasticity as a musical category pose obstacles to a universal definition, but its ethic of interest in the culturally exotic is encapsulated in &quot;Roots&quot; magazine&#x27;s description of the genre as &quot;local music from out there&quot;.

Music that does not follow &quot;North American or British pop and folk traditions&quot; was given the term &quot;world music&quot; by music industries in Europe and North America. The term was popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category for non-Western traditional music. It has grown to include subgenres such as ethnic fusion (Clannad, Ry Cooder, Enya, etc.) and worldbeat.

==Lexicology==
The term &quot;world music&quot; has been credited to ethnomusicologist Robert E. Brown, who coined it in the early 1960s at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, where he developed undergraduate through doctoral programs in the discipline. To enhance the learning process (John Hill), he invited more than a dozen visiting performers from Africa and Asia and began a world music concert series. The term became current in the 1980s as a marketing/classificatory device in the media and the music industry. There are several conflicting definitions for world music. One is that it consists of &quot;all the music in the world&quot;, though such a broad definition renders the term virtually meaningless.

==Forms==

Examples of popular forms of world music include the various forms of non-European classical music (e.g. Chinese guzheng music, Indian raga music, Tibetan chants), Eastern European folk music (e.g. the village music of the Balkans, The Mystery of the Bulgarian Voices), Nordic folk music, Latin music, Indonesian music, and the many forms of folk and tribal music of the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Central and South America.

The broad category of world music includes isolated forms of ethnic music from diverse geographical regions. These dissimilar strains of ethnic music are commonly categorized together by virtue of their indigenous roots. Over the 20th century, the invention of sound recording, low-cost international air travel, and common access to global communication among artists and the general public have given rise to a related phenomenon called &quot;crossover&quot; music. Musicians from diverse cultures and locations could readily access recorded music from around the world, see and hear visiting musicians from other cultures and visit other countries to play their own music, creating a melting pot of stylistic influences. While communication technology allows greater access to obscure forms of music, the pressures of commercialization also present the risk of increasing musical homogeneity, the blurring of regional identities, and the gradual extinction of traditional local music-making practices.

==Hybrid examples==

Since the music industry established this term, the fuller scope of what an average music consumer defines as &quot;world&quot; music in today&#x27;s market has grown to include various blends of ethnic music tradition, style and interpretation, and derivative world music genres have been coined to represent these hybrids, such as ethnic fusion and worldbeat. Good examples of hybrid, world fusion are the Irish-West African meld of Afro Celt Sound System, the pan-cultural sound of AO Music and the jazz / Finnish folk music of V√§rttin√§, each of which bear tinges of contemporary, Western influence‚Äîan increasingly noticeable element in the expansion genres of world music. Worldbeat and ethnic fusion can also blend specific indigenous sounds with more blatant elements of Western pop. Good examples are Paul Simon&#x27;s album &quot;Graceland&quot;, on which South African mbaqanga music is heard; Peter Gabriel&#x27;s work with Pakistani Sufi singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan; the Deep Forest project, in which vocal loops from West Africa are blended with Western, contemporary rhythmic textures and harmony structure; and the work of Mango, who combined pop and rock music with world elements.

Depending on style and context, world music can sometimes share the new-age music genre, a category that often includes ambient music and textural expressions from indigenous roots sources. Good examples are Tibetan bowls, Tuvan throat singing, Gregorian chant or Native American flute music. World music blended with new-age music is a sound loosely classified as the hybrid genre &#x27;ethnic fusion&#x27;. Examples of ethnic fusion are Nicholas Gunn&#x27;s &quot;Face-to-Face&quot; from &quot;Beyond Grand Canyon,&quot; featuring authentic Native American flute combined with synthesizers, and &quot;Four Worlds&quot; from &quot;The Music of the Grand Canyon&quot;, featuring spoken word from Razor Saltboy of the Navajo Indian Nation.

===World fusion===

The subgenre world fusion is often mistakenly assumed to refer exclusively to a blending of Western jazz fusion elements with world music. Although such a hybrid expression falls easily into the world fusion category, the suffix &quot;fusion&quot; in the term world fusion should not be assumed to mean jazz fusion. Western jazz combined with strong elements of world music is more accurately termed &quot;world fusion jazz&quot;, &quot;ethnic jazz&quot; or &quot;non-Western jazz&quot;. World fusion and global fusion are nearly synonymous with the genre term &quot;worldbeat&quot;, and though these are considered subgenres of popular music, they may also imply universal expressions of the more general term &quot;world music&quot;. In the 1970s and 1980s, fusion in the jazz music genre implied a blending of jazz and rock music, which is where the misleading assumption is rooted.

== Precursors ==

Millie Small released &quot;My Boy Lollipop&quot; in 1964. Small&#x27;s version was a hit, reaching number 2 both in the UK Singles Chart and in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In the 1960s, Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela had popular hits in the USA. In 1969 Indian musician Ravi Shankar played sitar at the Woodstock festival.

In the 1970s, Manu Dibango&#x27;s funky track &quot;Soul Makossa&quot; (1972) became a hit, and Osibisa released &quot;Sunshine Day&quot; (1976). Fela Kuti created Afrobeat and Femi Kuti, Seun Kuti and Tony Allen followed Fela Kuti&#x27;s funky music. Salsa musicians such as Jos√© Alberto &quot;El Canario&quot;, Ray Sep√∫lveda, Johnny Pacheco, Fania All-Stars, Ray Barretto, Rub√©n Blades, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Roberto Roena, Bobby Valent√≠n, Eddie Palmieri, H√©ctor Lavoe and Willie Col√≥n developed Latin music.

The 1979 American ensemble Libana was incorporated by founder Susan Robbins, specifically to represent world folk traditions through chants, dance, storytelling, and musical performance. Initially consisting of 25 women, it honed down to 6 &quot;core&quot; members who able to travel the world, all of whom toured in America, Canada, Bulgaria, India, Greece, and Morrocco. Libana has performed music of divergent cultural expressions, of the Mediterranean, the Balkans, the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Asia and South America. Libana musicians use instruments such as guitars, hammered dulcimers, ouds, baƒülamas, pan flutes, charangos, djembes, davuls, frame drums, double bass, clarinets, dumbeks, accordions, and naqarehs. They continue to be active as of 2024.

The Breton musician Alan Stivell pioneered the connection between traditional folk music, modern rock music and world music with his 1972 album &quot;Renaissance of the Celtic Harp&quot;. Around the same time, Stivell&#x27;s contemporary, Welsh singer-songwriter Meic Stevens popularised Welsh folk music. Neo-traditional Welsh language music featuring a fusion of modern instruments and traditional instruments such as the pibgorn and the Welsh harp has been further developed by Bob Delyn a&#x27;r Ebillion.

==Popular genres==
Although it primarily describes traditional music, the world music category also includes popular music from non-Western urban communities (e.g. South African &quot;township&quot; music) and non-European music forms that have been influenced by other so-called third-world musics (e.g. Afro-Cuban music).

The inspiration of Zimbabwe&#x27;s Thomas Mapfumo in blending the Mbira (finger Piano) style onto the electric guitar, saw a host of other Zimbabwean musicians refining the genre, none more successfully than The Bhundu Boys. The Bhundu Jit music hit Europe with some force in 1986, taking Andy Kershaw and John Peel fully under its spell.

For many years, Paris has attracted numerous musicians from former colonies in West and North Africa. This scene is aided by the fact that there are many concerts and institutions that help to promote the music.

Algerian and Moroccan music have an important presence in the French capital. Hundreds of thousands of Algerian and Moroccan immigrants have settled in Paris, bringing the sounds of Amazigh (Berber), ra√Ø, and Gnawa music.

The West African music community is also very large, integrated by people from Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast, and Guinea.

Unlike musical styles from other regions of the globe, the American music industry tends to categorize Latin music as its own genre and defines it as any music from Spanish- and Portuguese- speaking countries.

===Western===
The most common name for this form of music is also &quot;folk music&quot;, but is often called &quot;contemporary folk music&quot; or &quot;folk revival music&quot; to make the distinction. The transition was somewhat centered in the US and is also called the American folk music revival. Fusion genres such as folk rock and others also evolved within this phenomenon.

==== 1987 industry meeting ====

On 29 June 1987, a meeting of interested parties gathered to capitalize on the marketing of non-Western folk music. Paul Simon had released the world music-influenced album &quot;Graceland&quot; in 1986. The concept behind the album had been to express his own sensibilities using the sounds he had fallen in love with while listening to artists from Southern Africa, including Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Savuka. This project and the work of Peter Gabriel and Johnny Clegg among others had, to some degree, introduced non-Western music to a wider audience. They saw this as an opportunity.

In an unprecedented move, all of the world music labels coordinated together and developed a compilation cassette for the cover of the music magazine &quot;NME&quot;. The overall running time was 90 minutes, each package containing a mini-catalog showing the other releases on offer.

By the time of a second meeting it became clear that a successful campaign required its own dedicated press officer. The press officer would be able to juggle various deadlines and sell the music as a concept‚Äînot just to national stations, but also regional DJs keen to expand their musical variety. DJs were a key resource as it was important to make &quot;world music&quot; important to people outside London‚Äîmost regions after all had a similarly heritage to tap into. A cost-effective way of achieving all this would be a leafleting campaign.

The next step was to develop a world music chart, gathering together selling information from around fifty shops, so that it would finally be possible to see which were big sellers in the genre‚Äîso new listeners could see what was particularly popular. It was agreed that the &quot;NME&quot; could again be involved in printing the chart and also &quot;Music Week&quot; and the London listings magazine &quot;City Limits&quot;. It was also suggested that Andy Kershaw might be persuaded to do a run down of this chart on his show regularly.

== Relationship to immigration and multiculturalism ==

In most wealthy industrialized countries, large amounts of immigration from other regions has been ongoing for many decades. This has introduced non-Western music to Western audiences not only as &quot;exotic&quot; imports, but also as local music played by fellow citizens. But the process is ongoing and continues to produce new forms. In the 2010s several musicians from immigrant communities in the West rose to global popularity, such as Haitian-American Wyclef Jean, Somali-Canadian K&#x27;naan, Tamil-Briton M.I.A., often blending the music of their heritage with hip-hop or pop. Cuban-born singer-songwriter Addys Mercedes started her international career from Germany mixing traditional elements of Son with pop.

Once, an established Western artist might collaborate with an established African artist to produce an album or two. Now, new bands and new genres are built from the ground up by young performers. For example, the Punjabi-Irish fusion band Delhi 2 Dublin is from neither India nor Ireland, but Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Country for Syria, an Istanbul based music collective, blends American country music with the music of Syrian refugees and local Turkish music. Musicians and composers also work collectively to create original compositions for various combinations of western and non western instruments.

The introduction of non-western music into western culture created a fusion that influenced both parties. (Feld 31) With the quick demand for new music came the technicalities of ownership. As Feld states in page 31: &quot;This complex traffic in sounds money and media is rooted in the nature of revitalization through appropriation.&quot; There are collaborations between African and American popular music artists that raise questions on who is benefiting from said collaborations.(Feld 31) Feld mentions the example of &quot;That was your mother&quot;. Alton Rubin and his band the Twisters collaborated with Paul Simon on the song that possessed a zydeco feel, signature of Dopsie&#x27;s band. Even though Paul Simon wrote and sang the lyrics with them, the whole copyright is attributed to Paul and not to the band as well. (Feld 34) Because of crossovers like this one, where there was a disproportional gain when covering non-western music. Feld states that 

Immigration also heavily influences world music, providing a variety of options for the wider public. In the 1970s Punjabi music was greatly popular in the UK because of its growing Punjabi diaspora. (Schreffler 347) Bhangra music was also greatly covered by its diaspora in cities like New York and Chicago. (Schreffler 351) For a more mainstream integration, the Punjabi music scene integrated collaborations with rappers and started gaining more recognition. One of these successful attempts was a remix of the song &quot;MundiƒÅn ton Bach ke&quot; called &quot;Beware of the Boys&quot; by Panjabi MC featuring Jay Z. (Schreffler 354) Collaborations between outsider artists provided an integration of their music, even with foreign instrumentation, into the popular music scene.

Immigration, being a great part of music exportation, plays a big role in cultural identity. Immigrant communities use music to feel as if they are home and future generations it plays the role of educating or giving insight into what their culture is about. In Punjabi culture, music became the carrier of culture around the world. (Schreffler 355)

==Radio programs==
World music radio programs today often play African hip hop or reggae artists, crossover Bhangra and Latin American jazz groups, etc. Common media for world music include public radio, webcasting, the BBC, NPR, and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. By default, non-region-specific or multi-cultural world music projects are often listed under the generic category of world music.

Examples of radio shows that feature world music include &quot;The Culture Cafe&quot; on WWUH West Hartford, &quot;World of Music&quot; on Voice of America, &quot;Transpacific Sound Paradise&quot; on WFMU, &quot;The Planet&quot; on Australia&#x27;s ABC Radio National, DJ Edu presenting &quot;D.N.A: DestiNation Africa&quot; on BBC Radio 1Xtra, Adil Ray on the BBC Asian Network, Andy Kershaw&#x27;s show on BBC Radio 3 and Charlie Gillett&#x27;s show on the BBC World Service.

==Awards==
The BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music was an award given to world music artists between 2002 and 2008, sponsored by BBC Radio 3. The award was thought up by &quot;fRoots&quot; magazine&#x27;s editor Ian Anderson, inspired by the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. Award categories included: Africa, Asia/Pacific, Americas, Europe, Mid East and North Africa, Newcomer, Culture Crossing, Club Global, Album of the Year, and Audience Award. Initial lists of nominees in each category were selected annually by a panel of several thousand industry experts. Shortlisted nominees were voted on by a twelve-member jury, which selected the winners in every category except for the Audience Award category. These jury members were appointed and presided over by the BBC. The annual awards ceremony was held at the BBC Proms and winners were given an award called a &quot;Planet&quot;. In March 2009, the BBC made a decision to axe the BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music.

In response to the BBC&#x27;s decision to end its awards program, the British world music magazine &quot;Songlines&quot; launched the Songlines Music Awards in 2009 &quot;to recognise outstanding talent in world music&quot;.

The WOMEX Awards were introduced in 1999 to honor the high points of world music on an international level and to acknowledge musical excellence, social importance, commercial success, political impact and lifetime achievement. Every October at the WOMEX event, the award figurine‚Äîan ancient mother goddess statue dating back about 6000 years to the Neolithic age‚Äîis presented in an award ceremony to a worthy member of the world music community.

<text>Wu-Tang Clan is an American hip hop musical collective formed in Staten Island, New York City, in 1992. Its members include RZA, GZA, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God, Masta Killa, and, until his death in 2004, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard. Close affiliate Cappadonna later became an official member. They are credited for revitalizing East Coast hip hop and are considered one of the greatest hip hop groups of all time.

After signing to Steve Rifkind&#x27;s label Loud Records in 1992, Wu-Tang Clan released their debut album &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; in 1993; initially receiving positive reviews, it has since garnered widespread critical acclaim and is widely considered to be one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. Members of the group released solo albums between 1994 and 1996. In 1997, the group released their second album, &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot;. It debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards. The group later released the albums &quot;The W&quot; (2000), &quot;Iron Flag&quot; (2001), &quot;8 Diagrams&quot; (2007), and &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (2014), to less popularity. The only copy of their seventh album, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Shaolin&quot; (2015), was purchased for $2 million by former hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli.

Wu-Tang Clan has introduced and launched the careers of a number of affiliated artists and groups, collectively known as the Wu-Tang Killa Bees.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
In the late 1980s, cousins Robert Diggs, Gary Grice, and Russell Jones formed a group named Force of the Imperial Master, also known as the All in Together Now Crew. Each member recorded under an alias: Diggs as Prince Rakeem or The Scientist, Grice as The Genius, and Jones as The Specialist. The group never signed to a major label, but caught the attention of the New York City rap scene and was recognized by rapper Biz Markie. By 1991, The Genius and Prince Rakeem were signed to separate record labels. The Genius released &quot;Words from the Genius&quot; (1991) on Cold Chillin&#x27; Records and Prince Rakeem released &quot;Ooh I Love You Rakeem&quot; (1991) on Tommy Boy Records. Both were soon dropped by their labels. They then adopted new monikers; The Genius became GZA (pronounced &quot;jizza&quot;), and Prince Rakeem became RZA (pronounced &quot;rizza&quot;). The Specialist also took on a new name and became known as Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard.

RZA began collaborating with Dennis Coles, later known as Ghostface Killah, another rapper from the Stapleton Houses in Staten Island. The duo decided to create a hip hop group whose ethos would be a blend of &quot;Eastern philosophy picked up from kung fu movies, Five-Percent Nation teachings picked up on the New York streets, and comic books&quot;. Wu-Tang Clan assembled in late 1992, with RZA as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader and the group&#x27;s producer. RZA and Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard adopted the name for the group after the film &quot;Shaolin and Wu Tang&quot;. The group developed backronyms for the name (as hip hop pioneers such as KRS-One and Big Daddy Kane did with their names), including &quot;We Usually Take All Niggas&#x27; Garments&quot;, &quot;Witty Unpredictable Talent And Natural Game&quot;, and &quot;Wisdom of the Universe, and the Truth of Allah for the Nation of the Gods&quot;.

=== 1992‚Äì96: &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; and solo albums ===

Wu-Tang Clan became known in 1993 following the release of the independent single &quot;Protect Ya Neck&quot;, which helped gain the group a sizable underground following. Though there was some difficulty in finding a record label that would sign the Wu-Tang Clan while still allowing each member to record solo albums with other labels, Loud/RCA finally agreed, releasing their debut album, &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot;, in November 1993. The album loosely adopted a Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang theme, dividing the album into Shaolin and Wu-Tang sections. The album received critical acclaim, and to date is regarded as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. The success of their debut album established the group as a creative and influential force in the 1990s, allowing individual members to negotiate solo contracts. RZA spoke on the Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s unorthodox business model:

In 1994, RZA founded the group Gravediggaz with Prince Paul, Frukwan (both of Stetsasonic) and Poetic. In August of the same year, the group released &quot;6 Feet Deep&quot;, which became one of the best known works to emerge from the horrorcore subgenre.

RZA held the role of primary producer for the first wave of the group members&#x27; solo albums, producing out of his basement studio in Staten Island. In November 1994, Method Man&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Tical&quot;, was released. RZA&#x27;s hands-on approach to &quot;Tical&quot; extended beyond his merely creating the beats to devising song concepts and structures. The track &quot;All I Need&quot; from &quot;Tical&quot; was the winner of the &quot;Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group&quot; at the 1995 Grammy Awards. Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version&quot;, was released in March 1995, and is considered a hip hop classic. Raekwon&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot;, was released in August 1995. It featured all but one member of the Wu-Tang Clan, and featured the debut of Cappadonna, who later joined the group. The album is also credited with reviving the mafioso rap subgenre. GZA&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Liquid Swords&quot;, was released in November 1995. &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; features guest appearances from every Wu-Tang Clan member, and is linked together by excerpts from the 1980 movie &quot;Shogun Assassin&quot;. Ghostface Killah released his first solo album, &quot;Ironman&quot;, in October 1996. &quot;Ironman&quot; was critically acclaimed and is widely considered to be one of the best of Wu-Tang solo albums.

=== 1997‚Äì2000: &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot;, diversification and second string of solo albums ===

Wu-Tang Clan re-assembled and released their second studio album, &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot;, in June 1997; it debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Triumph&quot;, is over five minutes long, features nine verses (one from each member plus Cappadonna and excluding Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard who appeared on the intro and bridge), and no hook or a repeated phrase. The album was produced by RZA and his prot√©g√©s True Master and 4th Disciple. The group&#x27;s lyrics differed significantly from those of &quot;36 Chambers&quot;, with many verses written in a dense stream of consciousness form heavily influenced by the teachings of the Five-Percent Nation. &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot; was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards, losing to Puff Daddy; Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard infamously protested the loss by interrupting Shawn Colvin&#x27;s acceptance speech for Song of the Year.

Killah Priest, a close associate of the group, released &quot;Heavy Mental&quot; in March 1998. That same month, Cappadonna released his debut album &quot;The Pillage&quot;. Affiliated groups Sunz of Man and Killarmy also released well-received albums, followed by &quot;Wu-Tang Killa Bees: The Swarm&quot;‚Äîa compilation album released in 1998, showcasing these and more Wu-affiliated artists, and including new solo tracks from the group members themselves. &quot;The Swarm&quot; sold well and was certified gold. There was also a long line of releases from secondary affiliates such as Popa Wu, Shyheim, GP Wu, and Wu-Syndicate. Second albums from Gravediggaz and Killarmy, as well as a greatest hits album and a b-sides compilation, were also released.

The second round of solo albums from Wu-Tang Clan members included second albums from the five members who had already released albums, as well as debuts from all the remaining members, with the exception of Masta Killa. In the space of two years, RZA&#x27;s &quot;Bobby Digital In Stereo&quot;, Method Man&#x27;s &quot;Tical 2000: Judgement Day&quot; and &quot;Blackout!&quot; (with Redman), GZA&#x27;s &quot;Beneath the Surface&quot;, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s &quot;Nigga Please&quot;, U-God&#x27;s &quot;Golden Arms Redemption&quot;, Raekwon&#x27;s &quot;Immobilarity&quot;, Ghostface Killah&#x27;s &quot;Supreme Clientele&quot; and Inspectah Deck&#x27;s &quot;Uncontrolled Substance&quot; were all released (seven of them being released in the space of seven months between June 1999 and January 2000). RZA also composed the score for the film &quot;Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai&quot;, directed by Jim Jarmusch, while he and other Wu-Tang members contributed music to a companion &quot;music inspired by the film&quot; album.

The frequent release of Wu-Tang Clan content between 1997 and 2000 was considered by some critics to have resulted in an oversaturation that was responsible for the group&#x27;s decline in popularity.

=== 2000‚Äì01: &quot;The W&quot; and &quot;Iron Flag&quot; ===
The group reconvened again for their third album, &quot;The W&quot;. Despite his incarceration in California for violating the terms of his probation, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard was on the song &quot;Conditioner&quot;, featuring Snoop Dogg. Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s vocals were recorded via prison telephones.&quot;The W&quot; was released in November 2000, and was mostly well received by critics, and included the single &quot;Gravel Pit&quot;. The album reached platinum status.

In 2001, Wu-Tang Clan released their fourth album, &quot;Iron Flag&quot;. While originally featured on the cover of &quot;Iron Flag&quot;, Cappadonna was airbrushed out of the artwork and absent from the album entirely. This may be related to tension that arose within the group when it was revealed that Cappadonna&#x27;s manager was, or had been, a police informant, a revelation that also brought on the manager&#x27;s subsequent firing. Cappadonna continued collaborating and touring with the group in the following years.

=== 2004: Issues and resurgence ===
In early 2004, U-God allegedly left the group. A DVD titled &quot;Rise of a Fallen Soldier&quot; was released detailing his problems, which were mostly with his treatment by RZA, who he claimed had hindered his success as a solo artist. U-God formed a group of young proteg√©s called the Hillside Scramblers with whom he released the album &quot;U-Godzilla Presents the Hillside Scramblers&quot; in March 2004. The dispute culminated in a heated phone conversation between RZA and U-God on live radio, which ultimately saw the two reconcile. He has since returned to the group.

In 2004, the group embarked on a short European tour before coming together as a complete group for the first time in several years to headline the Rock the Bells festival in California. The concert was released on CD under the name &quot;Disciples of the 36 Chambers: Chapter 1&quot;. On October 26, 2004, the group released a greatest hits album, &quot;Legend of the Wu-Tang: Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;.

==== Death of Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard ====
Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s career was tumultuous. His run-ins with the law were well publicized‚Äîhe was arrested several times for offenses including assault, shoplifting, wearing body armor after being convicted of a felony, and possession of cocaine, and he missed multiple court dates. In April 2001, he was sentenced to two to four years in prison. Once released from prison, he signed a million-dollar contract with Roc-A-Fella Records.

On November 13, 2004, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard collapsed at Wu-Tang&#x27;s recording studio in New York City, and was pronounced dead later that night. Wu-Tang Clan paid him homage a number of times: in August 2006, one of his sons came out at a Wu-Tang concert at Webster Hall and rapped &quot;Brooklyn Zoo&quot;, along with his mother, and during a concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom the Clan brought his mother out on stage for a sing-along to &quot;Shimmy Shimmy Ya&quot;.

=== 2005‚Äì10: Solo albums and &quot;8 Diagrams&quot; ===

In 2005, RZA released a book titled &quot;The Wu-Tang Manual&quot;. In the same year, U-God&#x27;s second album, &quot;Mr. Xcitement&quot; and a collaboration between GZA and producer DJ Muggs, entitled &quot;Grandmasters&quot; were also released.

On March 28, 2006, Ghostface Killah released &quot;Fishscale&quot;, to much critical acclaim and some commercial success. The entire group, including Cappadonna and the late Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard, appeared on the track &quot;9 Milli Bros&quot;. The same year, Ghostface Killah released &quot;More Fish&quot;.

On June 25, 2006, Inspectah Deck released a street album entitled &quot;The Resident Patient&quot;, a prelude to his upcoming album, titled &quot;The Rebellion&quot;, which is said to be his final solo album. Also released in 2006 were Masta Killa&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Made in Brooklyn&quot;, to lukewarm reviews, and Method Man&#x27;s &quot;4:21... the Day After.&quot; Ghostface Killah released his seventh full-length album, &quot;The Big Doe Rehab&quot;, in December 2007.

In 2007, Wu-Tang Clan released their fifth album, &quot;8 Diagrams,&quot; on Steve Rifkind&#x27;s new label SRC Records. This album marked the inclusion of Cappadonna as an official member of the group. In an interview with MTV.com, Ghostface Killah stated that he was upset with RZA for starting the &quot;8 Diagrams&quot; project while he was in the middle of writing and recording &quot;The Big Doe Rehab&quot;, as well as giving &quot;8 Diagrams&quot; the same release date as &quot;The Big Doe Rehab&quot;, for which RZA rescheduled a release date one week later. The outcome of &quot;8 Diagrams&quot; received mixed views from both fans and critics, and is regarded as being RZA&#x27;s most experimental work to date. Raekwon and Ghostface Killah were unhappy with the album, and proposed recording a group album titled &quot;Shaolin Vs. Wu-Tan&quot; without RZA production. That album would eventually become Raekwon&#x27;s fifth solo album &quot;Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang&quot;.

In 2008, RZA released &quot;Digi Snacks,&quot; under the name Bobby Digital. The album included lesser-known Wu-Tang Clan affiliates such as Freemurder, Killa Sin, Black Knights, and others. In the same year, GZA released the album &quot;Pro Tools&quot;. In September 2008, RZA announced that he had signed a deal with digital music company The Orchard to release the Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s back catalogue worldwide digitally, for the first time. In addition to forthcoming material, the Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s catalogue includes 13 previous releases that have been previously unavailable digitally, including recordings by the group as a whole, U-God, Wu-Syndicate, Killarmy, Shyheim, West Coast Killa Beez, Black Knights and others, and would be available online beginning September 23. RZA said: &quot;The time is right to bring some older Wu material to the masses digitally. Our fans have been dedicated and patient and they&#x27;re hungry to hear the music that has set us apart from so many others. Hip-hop is alive in Wu Music, and with The Orchard, we&#x27;ve got a solid partner that understands our audience and is committed to doing all they can to help us reach the fans. I&#x27;m definitely looking forward to working with them to see what else we all come up with. There&#x27;s much more to come&quot;.

In 2009, U-God released his third solo album, &quot;Dopium&quot;, which features guest appearances from several Wu-Tang Clan members, and affiliates, among others, and was met with mostly lukewarm reviews. &quot;Wu-Tang Chamber Music&quot; was released in the same year, a side project executively produced by RZA, featuring live instrumentation from a Brooklyn soul band The Revelations. The album features appearances from five Wu-Tang Clan members, along with AZ, Kool G Rap, Cormega, Havoc, Sean Price, and M.O.P. Its first single, &quot;Harbor Masters&quot; featured Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, and AZ. RZA spoke about the album to Billboard.com: &quot;I think the &quot;Chamber Music&quot; title is very fitting. This music is totally in the chamber, or in the mind-frame of Wu-Tang like in the [&quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot;] days. But it&#x27;s not a Wu-Tang album. The whole Clan&#x27;s not on this album. But it couldn&#x27;t be in any other category but Wu-Tang&quot;.

Raekwon&#x27;s &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II&quot; was released in September 2009, which features guest appearances from several big-name artists, and Clan members, with Ghostface being the most prominent, and also production from RZA, Dr. Dre, Pete Rock, and J Dilla, among others. The album was initially intended to be released on Dr. Dre&#x27;s Aftermath Records. The album debuted at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at number 2 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and has been praised by most music critics. Several weeks later, Ghostface Killah released &quot;&quot;.

Talk of the album &quot;Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang&quot; re-surfaced in July 2009; originally planned as a Wu-Tang album without RZA&#x27;s input. The project evolved to include RZA only vocally, with no contribution to production. Raekwon stated &quot;[It&#x27;ll] be alter egos challenging each other, really allowing RZA to fall back on the production and allowing us to give him a flashback memory to the things we know we need from the abbot [RZA]. We want him to be involved [with the album as an MC], but the concept was for him not to be involved production-wise&quot;. Speaking to MTV.com, Method Man revealed his, Ghostface Killah&#x27;s and Raekwon&#x27;s plans to record a separate album as a trio: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to say it&#x27;s written in stone, but it&#x27;s in discussion. I want some feedback from the fans to see how they would take that. RZA produced tracks, some other outside producers, of course, and we gonna have Wu-Tang members on the album, but it&#x27;ll be a Rae, Ghost and Meth album&quot;. Soon after, Ghostface Killah cemented the details: the record, featuring other Wu-Tang Clan members, was to consist primarily of him, Method Man, and Raekwon. The title, as announced in three separate trailers (directed by Rik Cordero) promoting the upcoming release, is &quot;Wu-Massacre&quot;. Speaking on their willingness to complete the album, Ghostface Killah estimated the release date of the album to be the end of 2009 or January 2010. It was then announced that the album would be pushed back from December to March 30, 2010; the single, &quot;Meth vs. Chef Part II&quot;, was released after the announcement. Produced by Mathematics, it is an update of the song &quot;Meth vs. Chef&quot; from Method Man&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Tical&quot;, featuring verses by only Method Man and Raekwon. It had been confirmed by Raekwon that &quot;Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang&quot; would in fact be his next solo album and that &quot;Wu-Massacre&quot; is a separate album, while the rapper stated that he himself had petitioned to have &quot;Wu-Massacre&quot;‚Ä≥s release date postponed in order to yield more studio time.

On February 25, 2011, &quot;Wu Tang Live At The Palladium NYC&quot; was released through the group&#x27;s official Facebook page as a collectors digital download. This included exclusive, unreleased freestyles. It was limited to 100 downloads before the page was disabled after this figure was reached.

=== 2011‚Äìpresent: &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;, and &quot;Once Upon a Time in Shaolin&quot; ===
==== &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; ====

On June 29, 2011, Raekwon announced that the group were working on a new studio album, still in early stages. Ghostface Killah later said that the album would be released in May 2012.

Members went back and forth on the issue. While GZA hinted that a new album was unlikely, the RZA said a new Wu-Tang Clan album might happen after all, on the occasion of the group&#x27;s 20th anniversary, though Raekwon doubted it.

On January 9, 2013, work on the sixth Wu-Tang Clan album was announced via the group&#x27;s official Facebook page. In early March 2013 Method Man announced that the Clan was working on a sixth studio album and it would be released during 2013 in celebration of their 20-year anniversary since &quot;36 Chambers&quot;. Cappadonna has said the album is in recording process taking place in New York, Los Angeles and the Wu mansion in New Jersey. RZA has also said he had talked to Adrian Younge about working on a song for the album. On April 11, 2013, it was announced via a press release that their upcoming sixth studio album would be titled, &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; and was set to be released in July 2013. During late April 2013, the Clan performed at the 2013 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. On May 17, an unreleased Wu-Tang song titled &quot;Execution in Autumn&quot; was released for purchase through RZA&#x27;s record label Soul Temple Records. They performed at the 2013 HOT 97 Summer Jam at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, twenty years after they performed at the first annual Summer Jam concert. On June 5, 2013, the first promotional single &quot;Family Reunion&quot; featuring Masta Killah, Method Man, Ghostface Killah and RZA was released via the Soul Temple Records website.

In June 2013 RZA said so far every member of the Clan except Raekwon and GZA had put in work on the &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; album and that recording was being done at the Wu-Mansion, and the Wu-Mansion West. Unreleased verses from Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard will also be featured on the album. He also stated he was hoping to release the album in November 2013. In July 2013 Cappadonna indicated the album was half way finished. Once November 2013 arrived, RZA gave an update on the album, saying that not every member had been significantly working on the album. He gave credit to Method Man, Cappadonna, U-God and Masta Killa for working hard on the album, while saying he needed more effort from Ghostface, Raekwon and GZA. Shortly after Method Man stated that Raekwon had not worked on the album at all, and Ghostface had only recorded two songs for the album so far. In late November, RZA suggested that the album was approximately six weeks from completion. In January 2014, the group posted a message on their Facebook page, saying: &quot;The new Wu album &#x27;A Better Tomorrow&#x27; coming soon.&quot; After several disputes between Raekwon and RZA about the direction of the group and album, they reconciled, with the latter agreeing to record verses for &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;. On October 3, 2014, it was announced that the album will arrive December 2, 2014, courtesy of a new deal with Warner Bros. Records. The album was released late 2014.

==== &quot;Once Upon a Time in Shaolin&quot; ====
In March 2014 it was reported that in addition to work on &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;, a Wu-Tang Clan compilation album entitled &quot;The Wu ‚Äì Once Upon A Time In Shaolin&quot; had been recorded, with Wu-Tang-affiliated producer Cilvaringz as the primary producer instead of RZA. The album, a double album consisting of 31 tracks, was not given a conventional commercial release and only one copy has been produced; the copy toured in museums, art galleries and music festivals before being sold at a high price to a single individual. In August 2014, a reporter from &quot;Forbes&quot; traveled to Marrakech to meet Cilvaringz and hear a 51-second snippet of a song from the album, which featured Cher. The snippet was subsequently put on their website. The album is encased in a handcrafted silver-and-nickel box made by British-Moroccan artist Yahya and features never-before-heard music recorded over years. RZA stated he has been receiving multiple million dollar offers for the album. Despite the album&#x27;s exclusivity it made an appearance in electronic dance music producer Skrillex&#x27;s music video for his song &quot;Fuck That&quot; even though he did not purchase the project. The album was sold through Paddle8, an online auction house, for $2 million to Martin Shkreli. When the FBI arrested Martin Shkreli on December 17, 2015, they did not seize the Wu-Tang Clan album. Following the victory of Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Shkreli broadcast excerpts from the album on streaming platforms Periscope and Hitbox.tv.

In July 2021, it was announced that the album had been again sold by the US government for an undisclosed amount (later revealed as $4 million USD), following Shkreli handing it over to the FBI in 2018 after being convicted of defrauding investors. The new owner of the album is the PleasrDAO group.

==== &quot;The Saga Continues&quot; ====

On August 25, 2017, Wu-Tang Clan released the song, &quot;People Say&quot;, which featured Redman. RZA announced that the song would be part of an upcoming album, titled &quot;The Saga Continues&quot;. The album was released on October 13 under the name &quot;Wu-Tang&quot;, as U-God was absent from it. The Saga Continues was primarily produced by Mathematics, and debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200.

==== Las Vegas residency and &quot;Black Samson, The Bastard Swordsman&quot; ====
In December 2023, it was announced that Wu-Tang Clan would host &quot;Wu-Tang Clan: The Saga Continues‚Ä¶ The Las Vegas Residency&quot; at The Theater at Virgin Hotels in Paradise, Nevada; in the process, they became the first hip-hop act to ever receive an artist residency. The collective started performing at the residency in February 2024.

On February 6, 2025, Wu-Tang Clan announced that they would release a new joint project with producer Mathematics, titled &quot;Black Samson, The Bastard Swordsman&quot;, on April 12 of the same year, in coincidence with Record Store Day. The distribution of the album, which was inspired by Blaxploitation movies and marked the first release to feature the entire formation of the collective since 2014, would be initially limited to 5,000 2xLP copies sold at participating Record Store Day retailers.

==== Final Tour ====
On February 24, 2025 the group announced their final tour, &quot;Wu-Tang Forever: The Final Chamber&quot; with performance dates across North America from June through July of 2025.

== Artistry ==
=== Production ===
RZA&#x27;s production was described by AllMusic as &quot;consisting of stark, booming beats and chilling samples (heavily drawing from vintage soul records as well as kung fu movies),&quot; summarizing it as &quot;lean, menacing.&quot; According to RZA, he tries to have no more than 20‚Äì25% sampling on any given record, something starkly different from many other major hip hop groups. He uses &quot;the sampler more like a painter&#x27;s palette than a Xerox. Then again, I might use it as a Xerox if I find rare beats that nobody had in their crates yet&quot;. He played much of the piano himself, with Bill Evans and Thelonious Monk as major influences; for instance, he created the piano part to &quot;Da Mystery of Chessboxin&#x27;&quot; after watching the Thelonious Monk documentary, &quot;Straight, No Chaser&quot;.

RZA&#x27;s production technique, specifically the manner of chopping up and/or speeding or slowing soul samples, has been picked up by producers including Kanye West and Just Blaze. West&#x27;s own take on RZA&#x27;s style briefly flooded the rap market with what was dubbed &quot;chipmunk soul&quot;, the pitch bending of a vocal sample to where it sounded as though the singer had inhaled helium. Several producers at the time copied the style, creating other offshoots. West has admitted that his style was distinctly influenced by RZA&#x27;s production, and RZA has acknowledged his influence in an issue of &quot;Scratch&quot; magazine, saying he wished he had produced &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot;, two 2004 hits produced by Kanye West and Just Blaze, respectively. Kanye West commented:

=== Lyrics ===
Raekwon&#x27;s &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot; helped (with the likes of Kool G Rap) popularize mafioso rap, which remained widespread for more than half a decade. The landmark album touted a lifestyle patterned on drug dealing, regrets of living in harsh conditions, and partying (including popularizing the Cristal brand of champagne) which Nas, Mobb Deep, Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z, and other popular artists all borrowed and/or expanded upon these themes at points in their respective careers.

The Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s slang has long been a staple of their music, wherein members would blend Five Percenter terms, Kung Fu/oriental words, and comic book and street terms to create their own nicknames for actions, people, places and things (such as the christening of Staten Island as &quot;Shaolin Land&quot; and money as &quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot;). RZA noted in &quot;The Wu-Tang Manual&quot;, that Raekwon was the resident &quot;slang-master&quot; of a great deal of the slang used by the group.

== Syndication ==
=== Video games ===
All nine original members of the group were featured in the game &quot;Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style&quot;, released for the PlayStation on October 31, 1999, as well as a special collector&#x27;s edition controller. Ghostface Killah and Method Man play themselves in all three games in the Def Jam series &quot;Def Jam Vendetta&quot;, &quot;Def Jam Fight For NY&quot;, and &quot;Def Jam: Icon&quot;. The video games also feature Wu-Tang affiliate Redman.

Method Man is an avid fan of video games himself and has publicly stated that he loves playing &quot;SOCOM&quot; online with other PlayStation 2 users, and is part of an online clan (&quot;KMA/Kiss My Ass&quot;). His &quot;SOCOM II&quot; name is &quot;ICU&quot;. He has a fellow &quot;SOCOM&quot; player featured on a skit on his album &quot;4:21... The Day After&quot;.

In &quot;Army of Two&quot;, main character Salem talks about Wu-Tang asking his teammate Rios who the best member is. Salem says it&#x27;s RZA but he says Ghostface Killah is pretty good himself. In the ending cut scene, a reference is made when Salem says &quot;Survey says?&quot; and Rios replies &quot;You&#x27;re dead&quot;. The exchange referenced the lyric, &quot;And the survey says? / You&#x27;re dead!&quot; from &quot;Wu-Tang Clan Ain&#x27;t Nuthin&#x27; Ta F&#x27; Wit&quot;, from the album &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang Clan (36 Chambers)&quot;.

Several tracks by Clan members and affiliates such as Method Man, Ghostface, Cappadonna, Trife, DJ Mathematics and others were featured in the 2006 game &quot;Saints Row&quot;.

&quot;Afro Samurai&quot;, based on the TV series, was released in January 2009 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Its soundtrack, like the show, was produced by RZA.

=== Clothing line ===
Oliver &quot;Power&quot; Grant was one of the first to move from music to clothes. The Clan&#x27;s executive producer, Grant began making clothes in the early 1990s, with little success. But in 1995, after the platinum success of &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot;, manufacturers who earlier wouldn&#x27;t extend Power credit saw the potential. He opened four Wu Wear stores, in New York City, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Norfolk, Virginia. The line was carried in Macy&#x27;s, Rich&#x27;s, and d.e.m.o, among others. Power says he earned $10 million in 1998.

Method Man was unhappy with the decision to bring Wu-Tang into the fashion world with Wu Wear, despite the brand being a major money-maker for the group. &quot;When Wu-Wear started making shoes and sneakers and pants, it was shoddy material. I never rocked that shit.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m going to bring out Dirty Wear,&quot; declared ODB. &quot;A set of ready-worn clothes: &#x27;Dirty Wear, for the girl who likes to wear her panties three days in a row.&#x27;&quot;

In 1999, Nike released a Wu-Tang Clan themed dunk high. The shoes were produced in low quantities. Their rarity and popularity makes them very sought after, with reseller prices as much as $7,500.

A partnership between Wu-Tang and the Alife NYC clothing group took place in 2007 through 2008 for an exclusive series of custom sneakers, T-shirts, hoodies and other accessories for men and women. The collection was named &quot;A Wu-Tang Life&quot;.

== Television ==
=== Documentaries ===
&quot;Wu-Tang Revealed&quot;, a GZA-directed documentary, promised to show behind the scenes of the Clan, has yet to be released.

&quot;U-God: Rise of a Fallen Soldier&quot; details U-God&#x27;s side of the struggle between him and RZA circa 2004‚Äì2005.

Gerald K. Barclay directed the Wu-Tang documentary, entitled &quot;Wu: The Story of the Wu-Tang Clan&quot;, which premiered on BET on November 13, 2008. The documentary was released on DVD on November 18, 2008.

On November 10, 2009, a documentary on Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard was released, entitled &quot;Dirty: The Official ODB Biography&quot;. The documentary features interviews and stories from his family members, Wu-Tang members, and affiliates, as well as old interviews with Ol&#x27; Dirty, and live performances.

&quot;Wu Tang Saga&quot;, starring Cappadonna and featuring footage of the Clan dating back to the early nineties through their most recent tours was released on February 25, 2010.

In May 2019, Showtime premiered the four-episode documentary series &quot;Wu-Tang Clan: Of Mics and Men&quot;. The documentary was created by Sacha Jenkins and tells a story of the New York-based hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan from their earliest times to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the group. The series features interviews from all living members of the Wu-Tang Clan. A 7-track EP was released on May 17, 2019, one week after the documentary premiered.

=== &quot;Wu-Tang: An American Saga&quot; ===

On September 4, 2019, Hulu released &quot;Wu-Tang: An American Saga&quot;, a fictionalized account of the formation of the Wu-Tang Clan. The drama web series was created by RZA and Alex Tse. In January 2020, Hulu renewed the series for a second season. In November 2021, the series was renewed for a third and final season which premiered on February 15, 2023 and concluded on April 5, 2023.

<doc id="33138" wikidata="Q44131" url="?curid=33138" title="Werner Herzog">
<text>Werner Herzog (; n√© Stipetiƒá; born 5 September 1942) is a German filmmaker, actor, opera director, and author. Regarded as a pioneer of New German Cinema, his films often feature ambitious protagonists with impossible dreams, people with unusual talents in obscure fields, or individuals in conflict with nature. His style involves avoiding storyboards, emphasizing improvisation, and placing his cast and crew into real situations mirroring those in the film they are working on.

In 1961, when Herzog was 19, he started work on his first film &quot;Herakles&quot;. He has since produced, written, and directed over 60 films and documentaries such as &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot; (1972), &quot;The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser&quot; (1974), &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; (1976), &quot;Stroszek&quot; (1977), &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot; (1979), &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; (1982), &quot;Cobra Verde&quot; (1987), &quot;Lessons of Darkness&quot; (1992), &quot;Little Dieter Needs to Fly&quot; (1997), &quot;My Best Fiend&quot; (1999), &quot;Invincible&quot; (2001), &quot;Grizzly Man&quot; (2005), &quot;Encounters at the End of the World&quot; (2007), &quot;Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans&quot; (2009), and &quot;Cave of Forgotten Dreams&quot; (2010). He has also published over 12 books of prose and directed many operas.

French filmmaker Fran√ßois Truffaut once called Herzog &quot;the most important film director alive&quot;. American film critic Roger Ebert said that Herzog &quot;has never created a single film that is compromised, shameful, made for pragmatic reasons, or uninteresting. Even his failures are spectacular&quot;. He was named one of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people by &quot;Time&quot; in 2009.
==Life==
===Early life===
Herzog was born Werner Stipetiƒá in Munich, German Reich on 5 September 1942, the son of Elisabeth Stipetiƒá and Dietrich Herzog. His mother was Austrian with Croatian ancestry, while his father was German. When he was two weeks old, his mother took refuge in the remote Bavarian village of Sachrang in the Chiemgau Alps, after the house next to theirs was destroyed during an Allied bombing raid in World War II. He, his older brother Till and younger half-brother Lucki grew up without running water, a flushing toilet, or a telephone. He recounted that his family had &quot;no toys&quot; and &quot;no tools&quot; and said that there was a sense of anarchy, as all the fathers of the village&#x27;s children were absent. He never saw films, and did not even know cinema existed until a traveling projectionist came by the one-room schoolhouse in Sachrang.

When Herzog was 12, he and his family moved back to Munich. His father had abandoned the family early in his youth, but he later adopted his father&#x27;s surname (which is German for &quot;duke&quot;) as he thought it sounded more impressive for a filmmaker. Herzog made his first phone call when he was seventeen; two years later, he started work on his first film, &quot;Herakles&quot;. Herzog says that when he eventually met his father again, &quot;fairly late in life&quot;, his mother had to translate Werner&#x27;s German into the Bavarian dialect which his father spoke so the two could communicate. Herzog, aged thirteen, was told by a bullying music teacher to sing in front of his class at school in an effort, Herzog said, &quot;to break my back.&quot; When he adamantly refused he was almost expelled. The incident scarred him for life. For several years Herzog listened to no music, sang no songs, and studied no instruments, but when he turned eighteen he immersed himself in music with particular intensity.

At an early age, he experienced a dramatic phase in which he converted to Catholicism, which only lasted a few years. He started to embark on long journeys, some on foot. Around this time, he knew he would be a filmmaker and learned the basics from a few pages in an encyclopedia which provided him with &quot;everything I needed to get myself started&quot; as a filmmaker‚Äîthat, and the 35 mm camera he stole from the Munich Film School. In the commentary for &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot;, he says, &quot;I don&#x27;t consider it theft. It was just a necessity. I had some sort of natural right for a camera, a tool to work with&quot;.

During Herzog&#x27;s last years of high school, no production company was willing to take on his projects, so he worked night shifts as a welder in a steel factory to earn the funds for his first featurettes. When he finished school, but before he formally graduated, he followed his girlfriend to Manchester, England, where he spent several months and learned to speak English. He found the language classes pointless and &quot;fled&quot;. After graduating from high school, he was intrigued by the post-independence Congo, but in attempting to travel there, reached only the south of Sudan before falling seriously ill. While already making films, he had a brief stint at the University of Munich, where he studied history and literature. Herzog subsequently moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in order to study at Duquesne University.

===Early and mid-career: 1962‚Äì2005===
Herzog, along with Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Wim Wenders and Volker Schl√∂ndorff, led the beginning of the New German Cinema, which included documentarians who filmed on low budgets and were influenced by the French New Wave. He developed a habit of casting professional actors alongside people from the locality in which he was shooting. His films, &quot;usually set in distinct and unfamiliar landscapes, are imbued with mysticism.&quot; Herzog says his youthful experience with Catholicism is evident in &quot;something of a religious echo in my work&quot;.

In 1971, while Herzog was location scouting for &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot; in Peru, he narrowly avoided taking LANSA Flight 508. Herzog&#x27;s reservation was cancelled due to a last-minute change in itinerary. The plane was later struck by lightning and disintegrated, but one survivor, Juliane Koepcke, lived after a free fall. Long haunted by the event, nearly 30 years later he made a documentary film, &quot;Wings of Hope&quot; (1998), which explored the story of the sole survivor.

Herzog and his films have been nominated for and won many awards. His first major award was the Silver Bear Extraordinary Prize of the Jury for his first feature film &quot;Signs of Life&quot; (&quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot; was also nominated for Golden Bear in 1979). Herzog won the Best Director award for &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. In 1975, his movie &quot;The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser&quot; won the &quot;Grand Prix Sp√©cial du Jury&quot; (also known as the &quot;Silver Palm&quot;) and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the Cannes Festival. Other films directed by Herzog nominated for Golden Palm are: &quot;Woyzeck&quot; (1979) and &quot;Where the Green Ants Dream&quot; (1984). His films have been nominated at many other festivals around the world: C√©sar Awards (&quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot;), Emmy Awards (&quot;Little Dieter Needs to Fly&quot;), European Film Awards (&quot;My Best Fiend&quot;) and Venice Film Festival (&quot;Scream of Stone&quot; and &quot;The Wild Blue Yonder&quot;). In 1987, Herzog and his half-brother Lucki Stipetiƒá won the Bavarian Film Award for Best Producing for the film &quot;Cobra Verde&quot;. In 2002, he won the Dragon of Dragons Honorary Award at the Krak√≥w Film Festival.

Herzog once promised to eat his shoe if Errol Morris completed a film project on pet cemeteries that he had been working on, in order to challenge and motivate Morris as he perceived Morris to be incapable of following up on the projects he conceived. In 1978, when the film &quot;Gates of Heaven&quot; premiered, Herzog cooked and publicly ate his shoe; the event was later incorporated into a short documentary, &quot;Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe&quot;, by Les Blank. Herzog suggested that he hoped the act would serve to encourage anyone having difficulty bringing a project to fruition.

In the winter of 1974, German-French writer Lotte H. Eisner (a friend and mentor of Herzog since the late 1950s) fell gravely ill; Herzog walked from Munich to Paris, believing that she would not die if he did so. During these travels, which took him three weeks, he kept a diary that would eventually be published as &quot;Of Walking in Ice&quot;. Eight years later, the 87-year-old Eisner allegedly complained to Herzog of her infirmities and told him, &quot;I am saturated with life. There is still this spell upon me that I must not diecan you lift it?&quot; He says that he agreed to do so, and she died eight days later.
Werner Herzog moved to Los Angeles with his wife in the late 1990s. He said of the city, &quot;Wherever you look is an immense depth, a tumult that resonates with me. New York is more concerned with finance than anything else. It doesn&#x27;t create culture, only consumes it; most of what you find in New York comes from elsewhere. Things actually get done in Los Angeles. Look beyond the glitz and glamour of Hollywood and a wild excitement of intense dreams opens up; it has more horizons than any other place. There is a great deal of industry in the city and a real working class; I also appreciate the vibrant presence of the Mexicans.&quot;

=== Later directorial career: 2006 onwards ===

Herzog was honored at the 49th San Francisco International Film Festival, receiving the 2006 Film Society Directing Award. Four of his films have been shown at the San Francisco International Film Festival: &quot;Wodaabe ‚Äì Herdsmen of the Sun&quot; in 1990, &quot;Bells from the Deep&quot; in 1993, &quot;Lessons of Darkness&quot; in 1993, and &quot;The Wild Blue Yonder&quot; in 2006.

&quot;Grizzly Man&quot;, a documentary directed by Herzog, was awarded the Alfred P. Sloan Prize at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. He seemed to attract danger even in more suburban settings. In 2006, Herzog was shot in the abdomen while on Skyline Drive in Los Angeles. He had been giving an interview on &quot;Grizzly Man&quot; to Mark Kermode of the BBC. Herzog continued the interview without seeking medical treatment, stating &quot;it&#x27;s not significant&quot;. The shooter later turned out to be a crazed fan with an air rifle. Regarding the incident, Herzog later said, &quot;I seem to attract the clinically insane.&quot; In a 2021 episode of &quot;Diminishing Returns&quot; podcast covering Herzog&#x27;s film &quot;Stroszek&quot;, presenter Dallas Campbell called this incident a hoax, claiming to be friends with the director of the piece and that the incident was &quot;set up&quot;. 
Herzog&#x27;s April 2007 appearance at the Ebertfest in Champaign, Illinois, earned him the Golden Thumb Award, and an engraved glockenspiel given by a young film maker inspired by his films. &quot;Encounters at the End of the World&quot;, set in Antarctica, won the award for Best Documentary at the 2008 Edinburgh International Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, Herzog&#x27;s first Oscar nomination. In 2009, Herzog became the only filmmaker in recent history to enter two films in competition in the same year at the Venice Film Festival. Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans&quot; was entered into the festival&#x27;s official competition schedule, and his &quot;My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?&quot; entered the competition as a &quot;surprise film&quot;. Herzog also provided the narration for the short film &quot;Plastic Bag&quot;, directed by Ramin Bahrani, which was the opening night film in the Corto Cortissimo section of the festival.

Herzog completed a documentary called &quot;Cave of Forgotten Dreams&quot; in 2010, which shows his journey into the Chauvet Cave in France. Although generally skeptical of 3D film as a format, Herzog premiered the film at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival in 3-D and had its European premiere at the 2011 Berlinale. Also in 2010, Herzog co-directed with Dimitry Vasuykov &quot;Happy People: A Year in the Taiga&quot;, which portrays the life of fur trappers and their families in the Siberian part of the Taiga; it premiered at the 2010 Telluride Film Festival.

Herzog has narrated many of his documentary films.

In 2011, Herzog competed with Ridley Scott to make a film based on the life of British explorer Gertrude Bell. In 2012, it was confirmed that Herzog would start production on his long-in-development project in March 2013 in Morocco with Naomi Watts to play Gertrude Bell along with Robert Pattinson to play T. E. Lawrence and Jude Law to play Henry Cadogan. The film was completed in 2014 with a different cast: Nicole Kidman as Gertrude Bell, James Franco as Henry Cadogan, Damian Lewis as Charles Doughty-Wylie, and Robert Pattinson as a 22-year-old archaeologist T. E. Lawrence.&quot; Queen of the Desert&quot; had its world premiere at the 2015 Berlin International Film Festival.

In 2015, Herzog shot a feature film, &quot;Salt and Fire&quot;, in Bolivia, starring Veronica Ferres, Michael Shannon and Gael Garc√≠a Bernal. It is described as a &quot;highly explosive drama inspired by a short story by Tom Bissell&quot;.

=== Acting and other endeavours ===

Dissatisfied with the way film schools are run, in 2009 Herzog founded his own Rogue Film School. For the students, Herzog has said, &quot;I prefer people who have worked as bouncers in a sex club, or have been wardens in the lunatic asylum. You must live life in its very elementary forms. The Costa Ricans have a very nice word for it: &quot;pura vida&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t mean just purity of life, but the raw, stark-naked quality of life. And that&#x27;s what makes young people more into a filmmaker than academia.&quot; Notable alumni include Keirda Bahruth, Nir Sa&#x27;ar, Bob Baldori, Sean Gill, Frederick Kroetsch, and George Hickenlooper.

Herzog was selected to be the president of the jury at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival in 2010.

In 2010 he expanded his reach by performing a voiceover for an animated television program for the first time, appearing in &quot;The Boondocks&quot; in its third-season premiere episode &quot;It&#x27;s a Black President, Huey Freeman&quot;. In the episode, he played a fictional cameo of himself filming a documentary about the series&#x27; cast of characters and their actions during the 2008 election of Barack Obama.

Continuing with voice work, Herzog played Walter Hotenhoffer (formerly known as Augustus Gloop) in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Scorpion&#x27;s Tale&quot;, which aired in March 2011. The next year, he also appeared in the 8th-season episode of &quot;American Dad!&quot;, called &quot;Ricky Spanish&quot;. He lent his voice to a recurring character during the 4th season of the Adult Swim animated series &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;. In 2015 he voiced a guest character Old Reptile, an affiliate of Shrimply Pibbles for Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;.

He appeared in person opposite Tom Cruise as the villain Zec Chelovek in the 2012 action film &quot;Jack Reacher&quot;. Herzog gained attention in 2013 when he released a 35-minute Public Service Announcement-style documentary, &quot;From One Second to the Next&quot;, demonstrating the danger of texting while driving and financed by AT&amp;T, Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile as part of their &quot;It Can Wait&quot; driver safety campaign. The film, which documents four stories in which texting and driving led to tragedy or death, initially received more than 1.7 million YouTube views and was subsequently distributed to over 40,000 high schools. In July 2013, Herzog contributed to an art installation entitled &quot;Hearsay of the Soul&quot;, for the Whitney Biennial, which was later acquired as a permanent exhibit by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. In late 2013 he voiced some of the English-language dub of Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;The Wind Rises&quot;.

In 2019, Herzog joined the cast of the Disney+ live action &quot;Star Wars&quot; television series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, portraying &quot;The Client&quot;, a character with nebulous connections to the Empire. Herzog accepted the role after being impressed with the screenplay, although he said he had never seen any of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films.

In June 2022, Herzog published his debut novel, titled &quot;The Twilight World&quot;, telling the story of Hiroo Onoda, a Japanese soldier who had refused to surrender for decades while hiding in the jungle of a Philippine island. Herzog had met Onoda in Tokyo more than two decades before, and the two had discussed the jungle. Herzog had used jungles as settings of many of his important works.
Onoda, a WWII Japanese soldier who was deployed in 1944 to Lubang, a small Philippine Island, where he conducted warfare for twenty-nine years. After receiving orders to &quot;hold his position&quot;, his commander promised that someone would return for him, but as the years went by, it was clear that he was forgotten.

Herzog said his novel was a fictional account of Hiroo Onoda&#x27;s ordeal of being stranded in a jungle fighting a war that had officially ended. He has said, &quot;Most details are factually correct; some are not&quot;.

==Film theory==
===Style===
Herzog&#x27;s films have received considerable critical acclaim and achieved popularity on the art house circuit. They have also been the subject of controversy in regard to their themes and messages, especially the circumstances surrounding their creation. A notable example is &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot;, in which the obsessiveness of the central character was reflected by the director during the making of the film. &quot;Burden of Dreams&quot;, a documentary filmed during the making of &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot;, explored Herzog&#x27;s efforts to make the film in harsh conditions. Herzog&#x27;s diaries during the making of &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; were published as &quot;Conquest of the Useless: Reflections from the Making of Fitzcarraldo.&quot; Mark Harris of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in his review: &quot;The movie and its making are both fables of daft aspiration, investigations of the blurry border between having a dream and losing one&#x27;s mind.&quot;

Herzog has said that our civilization is &quot;starving for new images&quot;; in a 1982 interview with Roger Ebert, he explained that &quot;We do not have adequate images for our kind of civilization...We are surrounded by images that are worn out, and I believe that unless we discover new images, we will die out.&quot; He has said it is his mission to help us discover new images: &quot;I am trying to make something that has not been made before.&quot; He is proud of never using storyboards and often improvising large parts of the script. He explains this technique in the commentary track to &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot;.

In 1999, before a public dialogue with critic Roger Ebert at the Walker Art Center, Herzog read a new manifesto, which he dubbed Minnesota Declaration: Truth and Fact in Documentary Cinema. Subtitled &quot;Lessons of Darkness&quot;, after his film of that name, the 12-point declaration began: &quot;Cinema Verit√© is devoid of verit√©. It reaches a merely superficial truth, the truth of accountants.&quot; Herzog explained that &quot;There are deeper strata of truth in cinema, and there is such a thing as poetic, ecstatic truth. It is mysterious and elusive, and can be reached only through fabrication and imagination and stylization&quot; and that &quot;facts sometimes have a strange and bizarre power that makes their inherent truth seem unbelievable.&quot; Ebert later wrote of its significance: &quot;For the first time, it fully explained his theory of &#x27;ecstatic truth. In 2017, Herzog wrote a six-point addendum to the manifesto, prompted by a question about &quot;truth in an age of alt-facts&quot;.

His treatment of subjects has been characterized as Wagnerian in its scope, but film theory has in recent years focused on the concept of the ecstatic and the nomadic character of his film. The plot of &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; is based on the building of an opera house and his later film &quot;Invincible&quot; (2001) touches on the character of Siegfried. Herzog&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Transformation of the World into Music&quot; goes behind the scenes of the Bayreuth Festival. Herzog has directed several operas, including Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, and Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal.&quot;

=== Teaching ===
Critical of film schools, Herzog has taught three cinema workshops. From 2009 to 2016, he organized the Rogue Film School, in which young directors spent a few days with him in evocative locations. What exactly goes on at the rogue film school has been clouded in secrecy, but director and writer Kristoffer Hegnsvad report from his stay there in his book &quot;Werner Herzog ‚Äì Ecstatic Truth and Other Useless Conquests&quot;: &quot;The first thing you notice is his enormous presence. His self-confidence sends shockwaves through a room every time he opens his mouth or make eye contact; he adopts a stance of exalted calm, as though he has achieved some kind of mastery ‚Äì not just over his own mind, but over the capriciousness of the world&quot; &quot;. Lessons ranged from &quot;How does music function in film?&quot; to &quot;The creation of your own shooting permits&quot;.

In 2018, he held &quot;Filming in Peru with Werner Herzog&quot;, a twelve-day workshop in the Amazonian rainforest, close to the locations for &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot;, for new filmmakers from around the world. Each made a short film under Herzog&#x27;s supervision. Herzog was enthusiastic, and said of the resulting films that &quot;the best 10 of them are better than the selections for best short film at the Academy Awards&quot;. Workshop participants included directors Rupert Clague and Quentin Lazzarotto. Herzog is also on the website MasterClass, where he presents a course on filmmaking, entitled &quot;Werner Herzog teaches filmmaking&quot;. In a discussion with Errol Morris at the Toronto Film Festival, Morris, who was influenced by Herzog&#x27;s early films, joked that he considered himself one of the first students of the Rogue Film School. Regarding Herzog&#x27;s influence on him, Morris quoted Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez&#x27;s reaction to reading Kafka for the first time: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know you were allowed to do that.&quot;

==Personal life==
Herzog has been married three times and has three children. In 1967, he married Martje Grohmann and they had a son named Rudolph Amos Achmed (born 1973). They divorced in 1985. He later began dating Austrian-German actress Eva Mattes, and they had a daughter named Hanna Mattes (born 1980) before splitting up. He married Christine Maria Ebenberger in 1987, and they had a son named Simon (born 1989). They divorced in 1997. Herzog moved to Los Angeles in 1996 and married Russian-American photographer Elena Pisetski in 1999.

Herzog is a voracious reader. As required reading for the Rogue Film School, he has listed J. A. Baker&#x27;s &quot;The Peregrine&quot;, Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;, and Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber&quot;. Suggested reading includes the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; as translated from Old Norse by Lee M. Hollander, Bernal D√≠az del Castillo&#x27;s &quot;Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa√±a&quot; (&quot;The True History of the Conquest of New Spain&quot;), and the 888-page report published by the President&#x27;s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy.

Herzog has been described as an atheist. In addition to standard German and his native Bavarian, he speaks English, French, Greek, Italian and Spanish. He can also read Latin and Ancient Greek.

==Filmography==

Since 1962, Herzog has directed 20 fiction feature films, seven fiction short films, and 34 documentary feature films, as well as eight documentary short films and episodes of two television series. He has also been the screenwriter or co-writer for all his films and for four others, and has appeared as an actor in 26 film or television productions.

<text>The World Wide Web (WWW or simply the Web) is an information system that enables content sharing over the Internet through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and hobbyists. It allows documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet according to specific rules of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN in 1989 and opened to the public in 1993. It was conceived as a &quot;universal linked information system&quot;. Documents and other media content are made available to the network through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs).

The original and still very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that implement complex user interaction. The HTML language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs) which provide immediate access to other web resources. Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple websites. Web applications are web pages that function as application software. The information in the Web is transferred across the Internet using HTTP. Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name make up a website. A single web server may provide multiple websites, while some websites, especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple servers. Website content is provided by a myriad of companies, organizations, government agencies, and individual users; and comprises an enormous amount of educational, entertainment, commercial, and government information.

The Web has become the world&#x27;s dominant information systems platform. It is the primary tool that billions of people worldwide use to interact with the Internet.

== History ==

The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN. He was motivated by the problem of storing, updating, and finding documents and data files in that large and constantly changing organization, as well as distributing them to collaborators outside CERN. In his design, Berners-Lee dismissed the common tree structure approach, used for instance in the existing CERNDOC documentation system and in the Unix filesystem, as well as approaches that relied in tagging files with keywords, as in the VAX/NOTES system. Instead he adopted concepts he had put into practice with his private ENQUIRE system (1980) built at CERN. When he became aware of Ted Nelson&#x27;s hypertext model (1965), in which documents can be linked in unconstrained ways through hyperlinks associated with &quot;hot spots&quot; embedded in the text, it helped to confirm the validity of his concept.

The model was later popularized by Apple&#x27;s HyperCard system. Unlike Hypercard, Berners-Lee&#x27;s new system from the outset was meant to support links between multiple databases on independent computers, and to allow simultaneous access by many users from any computer on the Internet. He also specified that the system should eventually handle other media besides text, such as graphics, speech, and video. Links could refer to mutable data files, or even fire up programs on their server computer. He also conceived &quot;gateways&quot; that would allow access through the new system to documents organized in other ways (such as traditional computer file systems or the Usenet). Finally, he insisted that the system should be decentralized, without any central control or coordination over the creation of links.

Berners-Lee submitted a proposal to CERN in May 1989, without giving the system a name. He got a working system implemented by the end of 1990, including a browser called WorldWideWeb (which became the name of the project and of the network) and an HTTP server running at CERN. As part of that development he defined the first version of the HTTP protocol, the basic URL syntax, and implicitly made HTML the primary document format. The technology was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the whole Internet on 23 August 1991. The Web was a success at CERN, and began to spread to other scientific and academic institutions. Within the next two years, there were 50 websites created.

CERN made the Web protocol and code available royalty free in 1993, enabling its widespread use. After the NCSA released the Mosaic web browser later that year, the Web&#x27;s popularity grew rapidly as thousands of websites sprang up in less than a year. Mosaic was a graphical browser that could display inline images and submit forms that were processed by the HTTPd server. Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark founded Netscape the following year and released the Navigator browser, which introduced Java and JavaScript to the Web. It quickly became the dominant browser. Netscape became a public company in 1995 which triggered a frenzy for the Web and started the dot-com bubble. Microsoft responded by developing its own browser, Internet Explorer, starting the browser wars. By bundling it with Windows, it became the dominant browser for 14 years.

Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) which created XML in 1996 and recommended replacing HTML with stricter XHTML. In the meantime, developers began exploiting an IE feature called XMLHttpRequest to make Ajax applications and launched the Web 2.0 revolution. Mozilla, Opera, and Apple rejected XHTML and created the WHATWG which developed HTML5. In 2009, the W3C conceded and abandoned XHTML. In 2019, it ceded control of the HTML specification to the WHATWG.

The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.

== Nomenclature ==

Tim Berners-Lee states that &quot;World Wide Web&quot; is officially spelled as three separate words, each capitalised, with no intervening hyphens. Nonetheless, it is often called simply &quot;the Web&quot;, and also often &quot;the web&quot;; see Capitalization of &quot;Internet&quot; for details. In Mandarin Chinese, &quot;World Wide Web&quot; is commonly translated via a phono-semantic matching to &quot;w√†n w√©i w«éng&quot; (), which satisfies &quot;www&quot; and literally means &quot;10,000-dimensional net&quot;, a translation that reflects the design concept and proliferation of the World Wide Web.

Use of the www prefix has been declining, especially when web applications sought to brand their domain names and make them easily pronounceable. As the mobile Web grew in popularity, services like Gmail.com, Outlook.com, Myspace.com, Facebook.com and Twitter.com are most often mentioned without adding &quot;www.&quot; (or, indeed, &quot;.com&quot;) to the domain.

In English, &quot;www&quot; is usually read as &quot;double-u double-u double-u&quot;. Some users pronounce it &quot;dub-dub-dub&quot;, particularly in New Zealand. Stephen Fry, in his &quot;Podgrams&quot; series of podcasts, pronounces it &quot;wuh wuh wuh&quot;. The English writer Douglas Adams once quipped in &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; (1999): &quot;The World Wide Web is the only thing I know of whose shortened form takes three times longer to say than what it&#x27;s short for&quot;.

== Function ==

The terms &quot;Internet&quot; and &quot;World Wide Web&quot; are often used without much distinction. However, the two terms do not mean the same thing. The Internet is a global system of computer networks interconnected through telecommunications and optical networking. In contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URIs. Web resources are accessed using HTTP or HTTPS, which are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet transport protocols.

Viewing a web page on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the URL of the page into a web browser or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages‚Äîand to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks‚Äîcame to be known as &#x27;browsing,&#x27; &#x27;web surfing&#x27; (after channel surfing), or &#x27;navigating the Web&#x27;. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One study, for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation.

The following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URL . The browser resolves the server name of the URL () into an Internet Protocol address using the globally distributed Domain Name System (DNS). This lookup returns an IP address such as &quot;203.0.113.4&quot; or &quot;2001:db8:2e::7334&quot;. The browser then requests the resource by sending an HTTP request across the Internet to the computer at that address. It requests service from a specific TCP port number that is well known for the HTTP service so that the receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing. HTTP normally uses port number 80 and for HTTPS it normally uses port number 443. The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text:

GET /home.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
The computer receiving the HTTP request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port 80. If the web server can fulfil the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
followed by the content of the requested page. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) for a basic web page might look like this:

&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Example.org ‚Äì The World Wide Web&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The World Wide Web, abbreviated as WWW and commonly known ...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
The web browser parses the HTML and interprets the markup (&lt;title&gt;, &lt;p&gt; for paragraph, and such) that surrounds the words to format the text on the screen. Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images, other embedded media, scripts that affect page behaviour, and Cascading Style Sheets that affect page layout. The browser makes additional HTTP requests to the web server for these other Internet media types. As it receives their content from the web server, the browser progressively renders the page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources.

=== HTML ===

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by &quot;tags&quot;, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behaviour and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML 

=== Linking ===
Most web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://example.org/home.html&quot;&gt;Example.org Homepage&lt;/a&gt;.

Such a collection of useful, related resources, interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a &quot;web&quot; of information. Publication on the Internet created what Tim Berners-Lee first called the &quot;WorldWideWeb&quot; (in its original CamelCase, which was subsequently discarded) in November 1990.

The hyperlink structure of the web is described by the webgraph: the nodes of the web graph correspond to the web pages (or URLs) the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks. Over time, many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear, relocate, or are replaced with different content. This makes hyperlinks obsolete, a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot, and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called &quot;dead&quot; links. The ephemeral nature of the Web has prompted many efforts to archive websites. The Internet Archive, active since 1996, is the best known of such efforts.

=== WWW prefix ===

Many hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin with &quot;www&quot; because of the long-standing practice of naming Internet hosts according to the services they provide. The hostname of a web server is often &quot;www&quot;, in the same way that it may be &quot;ftp&quot; for an FTP server, and &quot;news&quot; or &quot;nntp&quot; for a Usenet news server. These hostnames appear as Domain Name System (DNS) or subdomain names, as in &quot;www.example.com&quot;. The use of &quot;www&quot; is not required by any technical or policy standard and many websites do not use it; the first web server was &quot;nxoc01.cern.ch&quot;. According to Paolo Palazzi, who worked at CERN along with Tim Berners-Lee, the popular use of &quot;www&quot; as subdomain was accidental; the World Wide Web project page was intended to be published at www.cern.ch while info.cern.ch was intended to be the CERN home page; however the DNS records were never switched, and the practice of prepending &quot;www&quot; to an institution&#x27;s website domain name was subsequently copied. Many established websites still use the prefix, or they employ other subdomain names such as &quot;www2&quot;, &quot;secure&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for special purposes. Many such web servers are set up so that both the main domain name (e.g., example.com) and the &quot;www&quot; subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) refer to the same site; others require one form or the other, or they may map to different web sites. The use of a subdomain name is useful for load balancing incoming web traffic by creating a CNAME record that points to a cluster of web servers. Since, currently, only a subdomain can be used in a CNAME, the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root.

When a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field, some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix &quot;www&quot; to the beginning of it and possibly &quot;.com&quot;, &quot;.org&quot; and &quot;.net&quot; at the end, depending on what might be missing. For example, entering &quot;&quot; may be transformed to &quot;http://www.microsoft.com/&quot; and &quot;openoffice&quot; to &quot;http://www.openoffice.org&quot;. This feature started appearing in early versions of Firefox, when it still had the working title &#x27;Firebird&#x27; in early 2003, from an earlier practice in browsers such as Lynx. It is reported that Microsoft was granted a US patent for the same idea in 2008, but only for mobile devices.

=== Scheme specifiers ===
The scheme specifiers &quot;codice_1&quot; and &quot;codice_2&quot; at the start of a web URI refer to Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP Secure, respectively. They specify the communication protocol to use for the request and response. The HTTP protocol is fundamental to the operation of the World Wide Web, and the added encryption layer in HTTPS is essential when browsers send or retrieve confidential data, such as passwords or banking information. Web browsers usually automatically prepend http:// to user-entered URIs, if omitted.

===Pages===
A &quot;web page&quot; (also written as &quot;webpage&quot;) is a document that is suitable for the World Wide Web and web browsers. A web browser displays a web page on a monitor or mobile device.

The term &quot;web page&quot; usually refers to what is visible, but may also refer to the contents of the computer file itself, which is usually a text file containing hypertext written in HTML or a comparable markup language. Typical web pages provide hypertext for browsing to other web pages via hyperlinks, often referred to as &quot;links&quot;. Web browsers will frequently have to access multiple web resource elements, such as reading style sheets, scripts, and images, while presenting each web page.

On a network, a web browser can retrieve a web page from a remote web server. The web server may restrict access to a private network such as a corporate intranet. The web browser uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to make such requests to the web server.

A &quot;static&quot; web page is delivered exactly as stored, as web content in the web server&#x27;s file system. In contrast, a &quot;dynamic&quot; web page is generated by a web application, usually driven by server-side software. Dynamic web pages are used when each user may require completely different information, for example, bank websites, web email etc.

==== Static page ====

A &quot;static web page&quot; (sometimes called a &quot;flat page/stationary page&quot;) is a web page that is delivered to the user exactly as stored, in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application.

Consequently, a static web page displays the same information for all users, from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of a web server to negotiate content-type or language of the document where such versions are available and the server is configured to do so.

==== Dynamic pages ====
A &quot;server-side dynamic web page&quot; is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.

A &quot;client-side dynamic web page&quot; processes the web page using JavaScript running in the browser. JavaScript programs can interact with the document via Document Object Model, or DOM, to query page state and alter it. The same client-side techniques can then dynamically update or change the DOM in the same way.

A dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a computer program to change some variable content. The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page&#x27;s DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a &quot;dynamic web page update&quot; using Ajax technologies will neither create a page to go back to nor truncate the web browsing history forward of the displayed page. Using Ajax technologies the end user gets &quot;one dynamic page&quot; managed as a single page in the web browser while the actual web content rendered on that page can vary. The Ajax engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, &quot;the&quot; DOM, for its client, from an application server.

Dynamic HTML, or DHTML, is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not static web pages, though it has fallen out of common use since the popularization of AJAX, a term which is now itself rarely used. Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser.

JavaScript is a scripting language that was initially developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich, then of Netscape, for use within web pages. The standardised version is ECMAScript. To make web pages more interactive, some web applications also use JavaScript techniques such as Ajax (asynchronous JavaScript and XML). Client-side script is delivered with the page that can make additional HTTP requests to the server, either in response to user actions such as mouse movements or clicks, or based on elapsed time. The server&#x27;s responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response, so the server needs only to provide limited, incremental information. Multiple Ajax requests can be handled at the same time, and users can interact with the page while data is retrieved. Web pages may also regularly poll the server to check whether new information is available.

===Website===
A &quot;website&quot; is a collection of related web resources including web pages, multimedia content, typically identified with a common domain name, and published on at least one web server. Notable examples are wikipedia.org, google.com, and amazon.com.

A website may be accessible via a public Internet Protocol (IP) network, such as the Internet, or a private local area network (LAN), by referencing a uniform resource locator (URL) that identifies the site.

Websites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be a personal website, a corporate website for a company, a government website, an organization website, etc. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, ranging from entertainment and social networking to providing news and education. All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web, while private websites, such as a company&#x27;s website for its employees, are typically a part of an intranet.

Web pages, which are the building blocks of websites, are documents, typically composed in plain text interspersed with formatting instructions of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML, XHTML). They may incorporate elements from other websites with suitable markup anchors. Web pages are accessed and transported with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which may optionally employ encryption (HTTP Secure, HTTPS) to provide security and privacy for the user. The user&#x27;s application, often a web browser, renders the page content according to its HTML markup instructions onto a display terminal.

Hyperlinking between web pages conveys to the reader the site structure and guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page containing a directory of the site web content. Some websites require user registration or subscription to access content. Examples of subscription websites include many business sites, news websites, academic journal websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, message boards, web-based email, social networking websites, websites providing real-time price quotations for different types of markets, as well as sites providing various other services. End users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktop and laptop computers, tablet computers, smartphones and smart TVs.

===Browser===

A &quot;web browser&quot; (commonly referred to as a &quot;browser&quot;) is a software user agent for accessing information on the World Wide Web. To connect to a website&#x27;s server and display its pages, a user needs to have a web browser program. This is the program that the user runs to download, format, and display a web page on the user&#x27;s computer.

In addition to allowing users to find, display, and move between web pages, a web browser will usually have features like keeping bookmarks, recording history, managing cookies (see below), and home pages and may have facilities for recording passwords for logging into websites.

The most popular browsers are Chrome, Safari, Edge, Samsung Internet and Firefox.

===Server===

A &quot;Web server&quot; is server software, or hardware dedicated to running said software, that can satisfy World Wide Web client requests. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols.

The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients. The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images, style sheets and scripts in addition to the text content.
A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server&#x27;s secondary storage, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the webserver is implemented.

While the primary function is to serve content, full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting web forms, including uploading of files.

Many generic web servers also support server-side scripting using Active Server Pages (ASP), PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor), or other scripting languages. This means that the behaviour of the webserver can be scripted in separate files, while the actual server software remains unchanged. Usually, this function is used to generate HTML documents dynamically (&quot;on-the-fly&quot;) as opposed to returning static documents. The former is primarily used for retrieving or modifying information from databases. The latter is typically much faster and more easily cached but cannot deliver dynamic content.

Web servers can also frequently be found embedded in devices such as printers, routers, webcams and serving only a local network. The web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring or administering the device in question. This usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer since only a web browser is required (which now is included with most operating systems).

===Optical Networking===
Optical networking is a sophisticated infrastructure that utilizes optical fiber to transmit data over long distances, connecting countries, cities, and even private residences. The technology uses optical microsystems like tunable lasers, filters, attenuators, switches, and wavelength-selective switches to manage and operate these networks.

The large quantity of optical fiber installed throughout the world at the end of the twentieth century set the foundation of the Internet as it‚Äôs used today. The information highway relies heavily on optical networking, a method of sending messages encoded in light to relay information in various telecommunication networks.

The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was one of the first iterations of the Internet, created in collaboration with universities and researchers 1969. However, access to the ARPANET was limited to researchers, and in 1985, the National Science Foundation founded the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET), a program that provided supercomputer access to researchers.

Limited public access to the Internet led to pressure from consumers and corporations to privatize the network. In 1993, the US passed the National Information Infrastructure Act, which dictated that the National Science Foundation must hand over control of the optical capabilities to commercial operators.

The privatization of the Internet and the release of the World Wide Web to the public in 1993 led to an increased demand for Internet capabilities. This spurred developers to seek solutions to reduce the time and cost of laying new fiber and increase the amount of information that can be sent on a single fiber, in order to meet the growing needs of the public.

In 1994, Pirelli S.p.A.&#x27;s optical components division introduced a wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) system to meet growing demand for increased data transmission. This four-channel WDM technology allowed more information to be sent simultaneously over a single optical fiber, effectively boosting network capacity.

Pirelli wasn&#x27;t the only company that developed a WDM system; another company, the Ciena Corporation (Ciena), created its own technology to transmit data more efficiently. David Huber, an optical networking engineer and entrepreneur Kevin Kimberlin founded Ciena in 1992. Drawing on laser technology from Gordon Gould and William Culver of Optelecom, Inc., the company focused on utilizing optical amplifiers to transmit data via light. Under chief executive officer Pat Nettles, Ciena developed a dual-stage optical amplifier for dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM), patented in 1997 and deployed on the Sprint network in 1996.

===Cookie===

An &quot;HTTP cookie&quot; (also called &quot;web cookie&quot;, &quot;Internet cookie&quot;, &quot;browser cookie&quot;, or simply &quot;cookie&quot;) is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user&#x27;s computer by the user&#x27;s web browser while the user is browsing. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user&#x27;s browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields such as names, addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers.

Cookies perform essential functions in the modern web. Perhaps most importantly, &quot;authentication cookies&quot; are the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not, and which account they are logged in with. Without such a mechanism, the site would not know whether to send a page containing sensitive information or require the user to authenticate themselves by logging in. The security of an authentication cookie generally depends on the security of the issuing website and the user&#x27;s web browser, and on whether the cookie data is encrypted. Security vulnerabilities may allow a cookie&#x27;s data to be read by a hacker, used to gain access to user data, or used to gain access (with the user&#x27;s credentials) to the website to which the cookie belongs (see cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery for examples).

Tracking cookies, and especially third-party tracking cookies, are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals&#x27; browsing histories a potential privacy concern that prompted European and U.S. lawmakers to take action in 2011. European law requires that all websites targeting European Union member states gain &quot;informed consent&quot; from users before storing non-essential cookies on their device.

Google Project Zero researcher Jann Horn describes ways cookies can be read by intermediaries, like Wi-Fi hotspot providers. When in such circumstances, he recommends using the browser in private browsing mode (widely known as Incognito mode in Google Chrome).

===Search engine===
A &quot;web search engine&quot; or &quot;Internet search engine&quot; is a software system that is designed to carry out &quot;web search&quot; (&quot;Internet search&quot;), which means to search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information specified in a web search query. The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as search engine results pages (SERPs). The information may be a mix of web pages, images, videos, infographics, articles, research papers, and other types of files. Some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories. Unlike web directories, which are maintained only by human editors, search engines also maintain real-time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler. Internet content that is not capable of being searched by a web search engine is generally described as the deep web.

In 1990, Archie, the world‚Äôs first search engine, was released. The technology was originally an index of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sites, which was a method for moving files between a client and a server network. This early search tool was superseded by more advanced engines like Yahoo! in 1995 and Google in 1998.

===Deep web===
The deep web, &quot;invisible web&quot;, or &quot;hidden web&quot; are parts of the World Wide Web whose contents are not indexed by standard web search engines. The opposite term to the deep web is the surface web, which is accessible to anyone using the Internet. Computer scientist Michael K. Bergman is credited with coining the term &quot;deep web&quot; in 2001 as a search indexing term.

The content of the deep web is hidden behind HTTP forms, and includes many very common uses such as web mail, online banking, and services that users must pay for, and which is protected by a paywall, such as video on demand, some online magazines and newspapers, among others.

The content of the deep web can be located and accessed by a direct URL or IP address and may require a password or other security access past the public website page.

=== Caching ===
A web cache is a server computer located either on the public Internet or within an enterprise that stores recently accessed web pages to improve response time for users when the same content is requested within a certain time after the original request. Most web browsers also implement a browser cache by writing recently obtained data to a local data storage device. HTTP requests by a browser may ask only for data that has changed since the last access. Web pages and resources may contain expiration information to control caching to secure sensitive data, such as in online banking, or to facilitate frequently updated sites, such as news media. Even sites with highly dynamic content may permit basic resources to be refreshed only occasionally. Web site designers find it worthwhile to collate resources such as CSS data and JavaScript into a few site-wide files so that they can be cached efficiently. Enterprise firewalls often cache Web resources requested by one user for the benefit of many users. Some search engines store cached content of frequently accessed websites.

== Security ==
For criminals, the Web has become a venue to spread malware and engage in a range of cybercrime, including (but not limited to) identity theft, fraud, espionage, and intelligence gathering. Web-based vulnerabilities now outnumber traditional computer security concerns, and as measured by Google, about one in ten web pages may contain malicious code. Most web-based attacks take place on legitimate websites, and most, as measured by Sophos, are hosted in the United States, China and Russia. The most common of all malware threats is SQL injection attacks against websites. Through HTML and URIs, the Web was vulnerable to attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) that came with the introduction of JavaScript and were exacerbated to some degree by Web 2.0 and Ajax web design that favours the use of scripts. In one 2007 estimate, 70% of all websites are open to XSS attacks on their users. Phishing is another common threat to the Web. In February 2013, RSA (the security division of EMC) estimated the global losses from phishing at $1.5¬†billion in 2012. Two of the well-known phishing methods are Covert Redirect and Open Redirect.

Proposed solutions vary. Large security companies like McAfee already design governance and compliance suites to meet post-9/11 regulations, and some, like Finjan Holdings have recommended active real-time inspection of programming code and all content regardless of its source. Some have argued that for enterprises to see Web security as a business opportunity rather than a cost centre, while others call for &quot;ubiquitous, always-on digital rights management&quot; enforced in the infrastructure to replace the hundreds of companies that secure data and networks. Jonathan Zittrain has said users sharing responsibility for computing safety is far preferable to locking down the Internet.

== Privacy ==

Every time a client requests a web page, the server can identify the request&#x27;s IP address. Web servers usually log IP addresses in a log file. Also, unless set not to do so, most web browsers record requested web pages in a viewable &quot;history&quot; feature, and usually cache much of the content locally. Unless the server-browser communication uses HTTPS encryption, web requests and responses travel in plain text across the Internet and can be viewed, recorded, and cached by intermediate systems. Another way to hide personally identifiable information is by using a virtual private network. A VPN encrypts traffic between the client and VPN server, and masks the original IP address, lowering the chance of user identification.

When a web page asks for, and the user supplies, personally identifiable information‚Äîsuch as their real name, address, e-mail address, etc. web-based entities can associate current web traffic with that individual. If the website uses HTTP cookies, username, and password authentication, or other tracking techniques, it can relate other web visits, before and after, to the identifiable information provided. In this way, a web-based organization can develop and build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites. It may be able to build a record for an individual that includes information about their leisure activities, their shopping interests, their profession, and other aspects of their demographic profile. These profiles are of potential interest to marketers, advertisers, and others. Depending on the website&#x27;s terms and conditions and the local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold, shared, or passed to other organizations without the user being informed. For many ordinary people, this means little more than some unexpected emails in their inbox or some uncannily relevant advertising on a future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement, counterterrorism, and espionage agencies can also identify, target, and track individuals based on their interests or proclivities on the Web.

Social networking sites usually try to get users to use their real names, interests, and locations, rather than pseudonyms, as their executives believe that this makes the social networking experience more engaging for users. On the other hand, uploaded photographs or unguarded statements can be identified to an individual, who may regret this exposure. Employers, schools, parents, and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles, such as text posts or digital photos, that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences. Online bullies may make use of personal information to harass or stalk users. Modern social networking websites allow fine-grained control of the privacy settings for each posting, but these can be complex and not easy to find or use, especially for beginners. Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems, as they can add a person&#x27;s face to an online profile. With modern and potential facial recognition technology, it may then be possible to relate that face with other, previously anonymous, images, events, and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere. Due to image caching, mirroring, and copying, it is difficult to remove an image from the World Wide Web.

== Standards ==

Web standards include many interdependent standards and specifications, some of which govern aspects of the Internet, not just the World Wide Web. Even when not web-focused, such standards directly or indirectly affect the development and administration of websites and web services. Considerations include the interoperability, accessibility and usability of web pages and web sites.

Web standards, in the broader sense, consist of the following:
* &quot;Recommendations&quot; published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
* &quot;Living Standard&quot; made by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)
* &quot;Request for Comments&quot; (RFC) documents published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
* &quot;Standards&quot; published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
* &quot;Standards&quot; published by Ecma International (formerly ECMA)
* &quot;The Unicode Standard&quot; and various &quot;Unicode Technical Reports&quot; (UTRs) published by the Unicode Consortium
* Name and number registries maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)

Web standards are not fixed sets of rules but are constantly evolving sets of finalized technical specifications of web technologies. Web standards are developed by standards organizations‚Äîgroups of interested and often competing parties chartered with the task of standardization‚Äînot technologies developed and declared to be a standard by a single individual or company. It is crucial to distinguish those specifications that are under development from the ones that already reached the final development status (in the case of W3C specifications, the highest maturity level).

== Accessibility ==

There are methods for accessing the Web in alternative mediums and formats to facilitate use by individuals with disabilities. These disabilities may be visual, auditory, physical, speech-related, cognitive, neurological, or some combination. Accessibility features also help people with temporary disabilities, like a broken arm, or ageing users as their abilities change. The Web is receiving information as well as providing information and interacting with society. The World Wide Web Consortium claims that it is essential that the Web be accessible, so it can provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with disabilities. Tim Berners-Lee once noted, &quot;The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.&quot; Many countries regulate web accessibility as a requirement for websites. International co-operation in the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative led to simple guidelines that web content authors as well as software developers can use to make the Web accessible to persons who may or may not be using assistive technology.

== Internationalisation ==

The W3C Internationalisation Activity assures that web technology works in all languages, scripts, and cultures. Beginning in 2004 or 2005, Unicode gained ground and eventually in December 2007 surpassed both ASCII and Western European as the Web&#x27;s most frequently used character map. Originally allowed resources to be identified by URI in a subset of US-ASCII. allows more characters‚Äîany character in the Universal Character Set‚Äîand now a resource can be identified by IRI in any language.

<text>A wireless LAN (WLAN) is a wireless computer network that links two or more devices using wireless communication to form a local area network (LAN) within a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, campus, or office building. This gives users the ability to move around within the area and remain connected to the network. Through a gateway, a WLAN can also provide a connection to the wider Internet.

Wireless LANs based on the IEEE 802.11 standards are the most widely used computer networks in the world. These are commonly called Wi-Fi, which is a trademark belonging to the Wi-Fi Alliance. They are used for home and small office networks that link together laptop computers, printers, smartphones, Web TVs and gaming devices through a wireless network router, which in turn may link them to the Internet. Hotspots provided by routers at restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, libraries, and airports allow consumers to access the internet with portable wireless devices.

== History == 
Norman Abramson, a professor at the University of Hawaii, developed the world&#x27;s first wireless computer communication network, ALOHAnet. The system became operational in 1971 and included seven computers deployed over four islands to communicate with the central computer on the Oahu island without using phone lines.

Wireless LAN hardware initially cost so much that it was only used as an alternative to cabled LAN in places where cabling was difficult or impossible. Early development included industry-specific solutions and proprietary protocols, but at the end of the 1990s these were replaced by technical standards, primarily the various versions of IEEE 802.11 (in products using the Wi-Fi brand name). 

Beginning in 1991, a European alternative known as HiperLAN/1 was pursued by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) with a first version approved in 1996. This was followed by a HiperLAN/2 functional specification with ATM influences accomplished February 2000. Neither European standard achieved the commercial success of 802.11, although much of the work on HiperLAN/2 has survived in the physical specification (PHY) for IEEE 802.11a, which is nearly identical to the PHY of HiperLAN/2.

In 2009, 802.11n was added to 802.11. It operates in both the 2.4¬†GHz and 5¬†GHz bands at a maximum data transfer rate of 600¬†Mbit/s. Most newer routers are &quot;dual-band&quot; and able to utilize both wireless bands. This allows data communications to avoid the crowded 2.4¬†GHz band, which is also shared with Bluetooth devices and microwave ovens. The 5¬†GHz band also has more channels than the 2.4¬†GHz band, permitting a greater number of devices to share the space. Not all WLAN channels are available in all regions.

A HomeRF group formed in 1997 to promote a technology aimed at residential use, but it disbanded in January 2003.

== Architecture ==
=== Stations ===
All components that can connect into a wireless medium in a network are referred to as stations. All stations are equipped with wireless network interface controllers. Wireless stations fall into two categories: wireless access points (WAPs) and clients. WAPs are base stations for the wireless network. They transmit and receive radio frequencies for wireless-enabled devices to communicate with. Wireless clients can be mobile devices such as laptops, personal digital assistants, VoIP phones and other smartphones, or non-portable devices such as desktop computers, printers, and workstations that are equipped with a wireless network interface.

=== Service set ===
The basic service set (BSS) is a set of all stations that can communicate with each other at PHY layer. Every BSS has an identification (ID) called the BSSID, which is the MAC address of the access point servicing the BSS.

There are two types of BSS: Independent BSS (also referred to as IBSS), and infrastructure BSS. An independent BSS (IBSS) is an ad hoc network that contains no access points, which means they cannot connect to any other basic service set. In an IBSS the STAs are configured in ad hoc (peer-to-peer) mode.

An extended service set (ESS) is a set of connected BSSs. Access points in an ESS are connected by a distribution system. Each ESS has an ID called the SSID which is a 32-byte (maximum) character string.

A distribution system (DS) connects access points in an extended service set. The concept of a DS can be used to increase network coverage through roaming between cells. DS can be wired or wireless. Current wireless distribution systems are mostly based on WDS or Mesh protocols, though other systems are in use.

== Types of wireless LANs ==
The IEEE 802.11 has two basic modes of operation: &quot;infrastructure&quot; and &quot;ad hoc&quot; mode. In ad hoc mode, mobile units communicate directly peer-to-peer. In infrastructure mode, mobile units communicate through a wireless access point (WAP) that also serves as a bridge to other networks such as a local area network or the Internet.

Since wireless communication uses a more open medium for communication in comparison to wired LANs, the 802.11 designers also included encryption mechanisms: Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), no longer considered secure, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, WPA3), to secure wireless computer networks. Many access points will also offer Wi-Fi Protected Setup, a quick, but no longer considered secure, method of joining a new device to an encrypted network.

=== Infrastructure ===
Most Wi-Fi networks are deployed in &quot;infrastructure mode&quot;. In infrastructure mode, wireless clients, such as laptops and smartphones, connect to the WAP to join the network. The WAP usually has a wired network connection and may have permanent wireless connections to other WAPs.

WAPs are usually fixed and provide service to their client nodes within range. Some networks will have multiple WAPs using the same SSID and security arrangement. In that case, connecting to any WAP on that network joins the client to the network, and the client software will try to choose the WAP that gives the best service, such as the WAP with the strongest signal.

=== Peer-to-peer ===
An ad hoc network is a network where stations communicate only peer-to-peer (P2P). There is no base and no one gives permission to talk. This is accomplished using the Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS). A Wi-Fi Direct network is a different type of wireless network where stations communicate peer-to-peer. In a peer-to-peer network wireless devices within range of each other can discover and communicate directly without involving central access points.

In a Wi-Fi P2P group, the group owner operates as an access point and all other devices are clients. There are two main methods to establish a group owner in the Wi-Fi Direct group. In one approach, the user sets up a P2P group owner manually. This method is also known as &quot;autonomous group owner&quot; (&quot;autonomous GO&quot;). In the second method, called &quot;negotiation-based group creation&quot;, two devices compete based on the group owner intent value. The device with higher intent value becomes a group owner and the second device becomes a client. Group owner intent value can depend on whether the wireless device performs a cross-connection between an infrastructure WLAN service and a P2P group, available power in the wireless device, whether the wireless device is already a group owner in another group or a received signal strength of the first wireless device.

IEEE 802.11 defines the PHY and medium access control (MAC) layers based on carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). This is in contrast to Ethernet which uses carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD). The 802.11 specification includes provisions designed to minimize collisions because mobile units have to contend with the hidden node problem where two mobile units may both be in range of a common access point, but out of range of each other.

=== Bridge ===
A bridge can be used to connect networks, typically of different types. A wireless Ethernet bridge allows the connection of devices on a wired Ethernet network to a wireless network. The bridge acts as the connection point to the wireless LAN.

=== Wireless distribution system ===
A wireless distribution system (WDS) enables the wireless interconnection of access points in an IEEE 802.11 network. It allows a wireless network to be expanded using multiple access points without the need for a wired backbone to link them, as is traditionally required. The notable advantage of a WDS over some other solutions is that it preserves the MAC addresses of client packets across links between access points. 

An access point can be either a main, relay, or remote base station. A main base station is typically connected to the wired Ethernet. A relay base station relays data between remote base stations, wireless clients or other relay stations to either a main or another relay base station. A remote base station accepts connections from wireless clients and passes them to relay or main stations.

Because data is forwarded wirelessly, consuming wireless bandwidth, throughput in this method is halved for wireless clients not connected to a main base station. Connections between base stations are done at layer-2 and do not involve or require layer-3 IP addresses. WDS capability may also be referred to as repeater mode because it appears to bridge and accept wireless clients at the same time (unlike traditional bridging).

All base stations in a WDS must be configured to use the same radio channel and share WEP keys or WPA keys if they are used. They can be configured to different service set identifiers. WDS also requires that every base station be configured to forward to others in the system as mentioned above.

== Roaming ==

There are two definitions for wireless LAN roaming:

# Internal roaming: The mobile station (MS) moves from one access point (AP) to another AP within a home network if the signal strength is too weak. An authentication server performs the re-authentication of MS via 802.1x (e.g. with PEAP). The billing of QoS is in the home network. A MS roaming from one access point to another often interrupts the flow of data between the MS and an application connected to the network. The MS, for instance, periodically monitors the presence of alternative APs (ones that will provide a better connection). At some point, based on proprietary mechanisms, the MS decides to re-associate with an AP having a stronger wireless signal. The MS, however, may lose a connection with an AP before associating with another access point. To provide reliable connections with applications, the MS must generally include software that provides session persistence.
# External roaming: The MS (client) moves into a WLAN of another wireless Internet service provider (WISP) and takes their services. The user can use a foreign network independently from their home network, provided that the foreign network allows visiting users on their network. There must be special authentication and billing systems for mobile services in a foreign network.

== Common issues ==
WLAN signals often extends beyond the boundaries of a building and can create coverage where it is unwanted, offering a channel through which non-residents or other unauthorized people could compromise a system and retrieve personal data. To prevent this it is usually sufficient to enforce the use of authentication, encryption, or VPN that requires a password for network connectivity.

<text>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. Founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of member organizations that maintain full-time staff working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web. W3C had 349 members. The organization has been led by CEO Seth Dobbs since October 2023. W3C also engages in education and outreach, develops software and serves as an open forum for discussion about the Web.

==History==

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Laboratory for Computer Science with support from the European Commission, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which had pioneered the ARPANET, the most direct predecessor to the modern Internet. It was located in Technology Square until 2004, when it moved, with the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, to the Stata Center.

The organization tries to foster compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption of new standards defined by the W3C. Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors, causing inconsistency in how web pages are displayed. The consortium tries to get all those vendors to implement a set of core principles and components that are chosen by the consortium.

It was originally intended that CERN host the European branch of W3C; however, CERN wished to focus on particle physics, not information technology. In April 1995, the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation became the European host of W3C, with Keio University Research Institute at SFC becoming the Asian host in September 1996. Starting in 1997, W3C created regional offices around the world. As of September 2009, it had eighteen World Offices covering Australia, the Benelux countries (Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg), Brazil, China, Finland, Germany, Austria, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, South Korea, Morocco, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and, as of 2016, the United Kingdom and Ireland.

In October 2012, W3C convened a community of major web players and publishers to establish a MediaWiki wiki that seeks to document open web standards called the WebPlatform and WebPlatform Docs.

In January 2013, Beihang University became the Chinese host.

In 2022 the W3C WebFonts Working Group won an Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for standardizing font technology for custom downloadable fonts and typography for web and TV devices.

On 1 January 2023, it reformed as a public-interest 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. In October 2023, Seth Dobbs was named as the organization&#x27;s chief executive officer.

==Specification maturation==
W3C develops technical specifications for HTML5, CSS, SVG, WOFF, the Semantic Web stack, XML, and other technologies. Sometimes, when a specification becomes too large, it is split into independent modules that can mature at their own pace. Subsequent editions of a module or specification are known as levels and are denoted by the first integer in the title (e.g. CSS3 = Level 3). Subsequent revisions on each level are denoted by an integer following a decimal point (for example, CSS2.1 = Revision 1).

The W3C standard formation process is defined within the W3C process document, outlining four maturity levels through which each new standard or recommendation must progress.

=== Working draft (WD) ===
After enough content has been gathered from &#x27;editor drafts&#x27; and discussion, it may be published as a working draft (WD) for review by the community. A WD document is the first form of a standard that is publicly available. Commentary by virtually anyone is accepted, though no promises are made with regard to action on any particular element commented upon.

At this stage, the standard document may have significant differences from its final form. As such, anyone who implements WD standards should be ready to significantly modify their implementations as the standard matures.

=== Candidate recommendation (CR) ===
A candidate recommendation is a version of a more mature standard than the WD. At this point, the group responsible for the standard is satisfied that the standard meets its goal. The purpose of the CR is to elicit aid from the development community on how implementable the standard is.

The standard document may change further, but significant features are mostly decided at this point. The design of those features can still change due to feedback from implementors.

=== Proposed recommendation (PR) ===
A proposed recommendation is the version of a standard that has passed the prior two levels. The users of the standard provide input. At this stage, the document is submitted to the W3C Advisory Council for final approval.

While this step is important, it rarely causes any significant changes to a standard as it passes to the next phase.

=== W3C recommendation (REC) ===
This is the most mature stage of development. At this point, the standard has undergone extensive review and testing, under both theoretical and practical conditions. The standard is now endorsed by the W3C, indicating its readiness for deployment to the public, and encouraging more widespread support among implementors and authors.

Recommendations can sometimes be implemented incorrectly, partially, or not at all, but many standards define two or more levels of conformance that developers must follow if they wish to label their product as W3C-compliant.

=== Later revisions ===
A recommendation may be updated or extended by separately-published, non-technical errata or editor drafts until sufficient substantial edits accumulate for producing a new edition or level of the recommendation. Additionally, the W3C publishes various kinds of informative notes which are to be used as references.

=== Certification ===
Unlike the Internet Society and other international standards bodies, the W3C does not have a certification program. The W3C has decided, for now, that it is not suitable to start such a program, owing to the risk of creating more drawbacks for the community than benefits.

==Administration==
In January 2023, after 28 years of being jointly administered by the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (located in Stata Center) in the United States, the (in Sophia Antipolis, France), Keio University (in Japan) and Beihang University (in China), the W3C incorporated as a legal entity, becoming a public-interest not-for-profit organization.

The W3C has a staff team of 70‚Äì80 worldwide . W3C is run by a management team which allocates resources and designs strategy, led by CEO Jeffrey Jaffe (as of March 2010), former CTO of Novell. It also includes an advisory board that supports strategy and legal matters and helps resolve conflicts. The majority of standardization work is done by external experts in the W3C&#x27;s various working groups.

==Membership==
The Consortium is governed by its membership. The list of members is available to the public. Members include businesses, nonprofit organizations, universities, governmental entities, and individuals.

Membership requirements are transparent except for one requirement: An application for membership must be reviewed and approved by the W3C. Many guidelines and requirements are stated in detail, but there is no final guideline about the process or standards by which membership might be finally approved or denied.

The cost of membership is given on a sliding scale, depending on the character of the organization applying and the country in which it is located. Countries are categorized by the World Bank&#x27;s most recent grouping by gross national income per capita.

==Criticism==
In 2012 and 2013, the W3C started considering adding DRM-specific Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) to HTML5, which was criticised as being against the openness, interoperability, and vendor neutrality that distinguished websites built using only W3C standards from those requiring proprietary plug-ins like Flash. On 18 September 2017, the W3C published the EME specification as a recommendation, leading to the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#x27;s resignation from W3C. As feared by the opponents of EME, , none of the widely used Content Decryption Modules used with EME are available for licensing without a per-browser licensing fee.

<doc id="33153" wikidata="Q281" url="?curid=33153" title="Whisky">
<text>Whisky or whiskey is a type of liquor made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn, rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, which are typically made of charred white oak. Uncharred white oak casks previously used for the aging of port, rum or sherry are also sometimes used.

Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;whisky&quot; (or &quot;whiskey&quot;) is an anglicisation of the Classical Gaelic word (or ) meaning &quot;water&quot; (now written as in Modern Irish, and in Scottish Gaelic). This Gaelic word shares its ultimate origins with Germanic &quot;water&quot; and Slavic &quot;voda&quot; of the same meaning. Distilled alcohol was known in Latin as (&quot;water of life&quot;). This was translated into Middle Irish as , which became () in Irish and in Scottish Gaelic. Early forms of the word in English included &quot;uskebeaghe&quot; (1581), &quot;usquebaugh&quot; (1610), &quot;usquebath&quot; (1621), and &quot;usquebae&quot; (1715).

===Names and spellings===
Much is made of the word&#x27;s two spellings: &quot;whisky&quot; and &quot;whiskey&quot;. There are two schools of thought on the issue. One is that the spelling difference is simply a matter of regional language convention for the spelling of a word, indicating that the spelling varies depending on the intended audience or the background or personal preferences of the writer (like the difference between &quot;color&quot; and &quot;colour&quot;; or &quot;recognize&quot; and &quot;recognise&quot;), and the other is that the spelling should depend on the style or origin of the spirit being described. There is general agreement that when quoting the proper name printed on a label, one should not alter its spelling.

The spelling &quot;whiskey&quot; is common in Ireland and the United States, while &quot;whisky&quot; is used in all other whisky-producing countries. In the US, the usage has not always been consistent. From the late eighteenth century to the mid-twentieth century, American writers used both spellings interchangeably until the introduction of newspaper style guides. Since the 1960s, American writers have increasingly used &quot;whiskey&quot; as the accepted spelling for aged grain spirits made in the US and &quot;whisky&quot; for aged grain spirits made outside the US. However, some prominent American brands, such as George Dickel, Maker&#x27;s Mark, and Old Forester (all made by different companies), use the &quot;whisky&quot; spelling on their labels, and the &quot;Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits&quot;, the legal regulations for spirit in the US, also use the &quot;whisky&quot; spelling throughout.

===Scotch===
Whisky made in Scotland is simply called &quot;whisky&quot; within Scotland. Elsewhere and in the regulations of the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) that govern its production, it is commonly called &quot;Scotch whisky&quot; or simply &quot;Scotch&quot; (especially in North America).

==History==
=== Early distilling ===
It is possible that distillation was practised by the Babylonians in Mesopotamia in the 2nd millennium BC, with perfumes and aromatics being distilled, but this is subject to uncertain and disputed interpretations of evidence.

The earliest certain chemical distillations were by Greeks in Alexandria in the 1st century AD, but these were not distillations of alcohol. The medieval Arabs adopted the distillation technique of the Alexandrian Greeks, and written records in Arabic begin in the 9th century, but again these were not distillations of alcohol. Distilling technology passed from the medieval Arabs to the medieval Latins, with the earliest records in Latin in the early 12th century.

The earliest records of the distillation of alcohol are in Italy in the 13th century, where alcohol was distilled from wine. An early description of the technique was given by Ramon Llull (1232‚Äì1315). Its use spread through medieval monasteries, largely for medicinal purposes, such as the treatment of colic and smallpox.

=== Ireland and Scotland ===
The practice of distillation spread to Ireland and Scotland no later than the 15th century, as did the common European practice of distilling &quot;aqua vitae&quot;, spirit alcohol, primarily for medicinal purposes. The practice of medicinal distillation eventually passed from a monastic setting to the secular via professional medical practitioners of the time, The Guild of Barber Surgeons. The earliest mention of whiskey in Ireland comes from the &quot;Annals of Clonmacnoise&quot;, which attributes the death of a chieftain in 1405 to &quot;taking a surfeit of aqua vitae&quot; at Christmas. In Scotland, the first evidence of whisky production comes from an entry in the &quot;Exchequer Rolls&quot; for 1495 where malt is sent &quot;To Friar John Cor, by order of the king, to make aquavitae&quot;, enough to make about 500 bottles.

James IV of Scotland (r. 1488‚Äì1513) reportedly had a great liking for Scotch whisky, and in 1506 the town of Dundee purchased a large amount of whisky from the Guild of Barber-Surgeons, which held the monopoly on production at the time. 

The distillation process was still in its infancy; whisky itself was not allowed to age, and as a result tasted very raw and brutal compared to today&#x27;s versions. Renaissance-era whisky was also very potent and not diluted. Over time whisky evolved into a much smoother drink.

=== 18th century ===
In 1707, the Acts of Union merged England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain, and thereafter taxes on distilled spirits rose dramatically. Following parliament&#x27;s divisive malt tax of 1725, most of Scotland&#x27;s distillation was either shut down or forced underground. Scotch whisky was hidden under altars, in coffins, and in any available space to avoid the governmental excisemen or revenuers. Scottish distillers, operating out of homemade stills, took to distilling whisky at night when the darkness hid the smoke from the stills. At one point, it was estimated that over half of Scotland&#x27;s whisky output was illegal.

In America, whisky was used as currency during the American Revolution; George Washington operated a large distillery at Mount Vernon. Given the distances and primitive transportation network of colonial America, farmers often found it easier and more profitable to convert corn to whisky and transport it to market in that form. It also was a highly coveted trade good, and when an additional excise tax was levied against it in 1791, the Whiskey Rebellion erupted.

=== 19th century ===

The drinking of Scotch whisky was introduced to India in the nineteenth century. The first distillery in India was built by Edward Dyer at Kasauli in the late 1820s. The operation was soon shifted to nearby Solan (close to the British summer capital Shimla), as there was an abundant supply of fresh spring water there.

In 1823, the UK passed the Excise Act, legalizing distillation (for a fee), and this put a practical end to the large-scale production of Scottish moonshine.

In 1831, Aeneas Coffey patented the Coffey still, allowing for a cheaper and more efficient distillation of whisky. In 1850, Andrew Usher began producing a blended whisky that mixed traditional pot still whisky with that from the new Coffey still. The new distillation method was scoffed at by some Irish distillers, who clung to their traditional pot stills. Many Irish contended that the new product was, in fact, not whisky at all.

By the 1880s, the French brandy industry was devastated by the phylloxera pest that ruined much of the grape crop; as a result, whisky became the primary liquor in many markets.

=== 20th century ===

During the Prohibition era in the United States lasting from 1920 to 1933, all alcohol sales were banned in the country. The federal government made an exemption for whisky prescribed by a doctor and sold through licensed pharmacies, such as Walgreens.

==Production==
Although specific methods may vary among distilleries, whisky production broadly comprises four primary stages: grain preparation, fermentation, distillation, and maturation (aging). This process is typically followed by the two additional stages of bottling and marketing.

===Grain preparation===
To initiate whisky production, grains are processed to convert their starches into fermentable sugars, which can then be subjected to fermentation and distillation. This process involves malting, milling and mashing the grains. 

==== Malting ====
Malt production begins with the soaking of grains in water tanks for a period of three days. The soaked grains are then transferred to large containers where germination occurs, initiating the metabolic process that converts starches into sugars. This process is subsequently halted by drying the grains with hot air, a procedure also known as &quot;kilning&quot;, at the end of which the product is malt. In the production of Scotch whisky, the air used for kilning is heated by burning peat bricks in a furnace, imparting the characteristic smoky flavour to the malt.

==== Milling ====
Following the malting process, the grains are transferred to a dressing machine, which separates the sprouts from the seeds. The grains are then conveyed to a mill for grinding.

==== Mashing ====
The extraction of sugars to be converted into alcohol is achieved through a process known as mashing. During mashing, the diastase enzyme is activated, which facilitates the conversion of starches and dextrins into sugars. The ground malt is introduced into a &quot;mashtun&quot;, a large vat containing hot water, and is agitated for approximately thirty minutes or more. The water is then drained from the mashtun, which is subsequently refilled with hot water. This procedure is typically repeated between one and three times. Once complete, the resulting liquid, known as &quot;wort&quot;, which contains the extracted sugars, is separated from the mash, cooled, and transferred to the &quot;washbacks&quot;, or fermenting vats.

=== Fermentation ===
During fermentation, a specific strain of yeast, &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; (commonly known as &quot;brewer&#x27;s yeast&quot;), is introduced to the sugary wort, which provides the necessary nutrients for its asexual reproduction. The yeast metabolizes the sugars, producing alcohol, carbon dioxide, and congeners, which can influence the flavor profile of the whisky, either enhancing or suppressing desirable characteristics. The fermenting vats are maintained within a controlled temperature range, typically between which is optimal for yeast activity. Distillers ensure consistency by using the same yeast strain to achieve uniformity in the final whiskey product. Fermentation continues for two days or longer until the alcohol content of the liquid reaches between 5% and 10%. Once fermentation is complete, and the yeast ceases to be active, the resulting liquid is referred to as &quot;wash&quot; or &quot;distiller&#x27;s beer&quot;. Even though the wash is alcoholic it is still organic, which makes it susceptible to contamination by microorganisms that cause rot. Consequently, it is promptly transferred to the still for boiling to mitigate this risk.

===Distillation===
The decision to transfer either the entire wash or only the most liquid portion into the still is at the discretion of the distiller, and each choice affects the flavor profile of the final product in distinct ways. Following the transfer of the wash, the still is heated to a temperature sufficient to evaporate the alcohol while remaining low enough to prevent the evaporation of water. Alcohol vapour ascends through the still and is directed to the condenser, which consists of copper tubes or plates, where it condenses back into a liquid form known as the &quot;distilled spirit&quot;. This distilled spirit is meticulously monitored during its extraction. The initial and final portions of the distillate are deemed undesirable and are therefore redirected back into the still. Only the middle portion, considered the most desirable, is collected in the &quot;spirits receiver&quot;. At this stage, the distilled spirit is clear and has an ethanol content ranging from 70% to 80% ABV. It is typically diluted before being transferred to casks for maturation, though some distilleries sell it as is at &#x27;cask strength&#x27;. 

A still for making whisky is usually made of copper, since it removes sulfur-based compounds from the alcohol that would make it unpleasant to drink. Modern stills are made of stainless steel with copper innards (piping, for example, will be lined with copper along with copper plate inlays along still walls). The simplest standard distillation apparatus is commonly known as a pot still, consisting of a single heated chamber and a vessel to collect purified alcohol.

Column stills are frequently used in the production of grain whisky and are the most commonly used type of still in the production of bourbon and other American whiskeys. Column stills behave like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. Whereas a single pot still charged with wine might yield a vapour enriched to 40‚Äì60% alcohol, a column still can achieve a vapour alcohol content of 95.6%; an azeotropic mixture of alcohol and water.

===Maturation (Aging)===
Whiskies do not mature in the bottle, only in the cask, so the &quot;age&quot; of a whisky is only the time between distillation and bottling. This reflects how much the cask has interacted with the whisky, changing its chemical makeup and taste. Whiskies that have been bottled for many years may have a rarity value, but are not &quot;older&quot; and not necessarily &quot;better&quot; than a more recent whisky that matured in wood for a similar time. After a decade or two, additional aging in a barrel does not necessarily improve a whisky, and excessive aging will even affect it negatively. The minimum aging period required for whisky varies by country. In the United States, the minimum aging requirement is typically 2 years, while in Scotland, Ireland, and Canada, it is generally 3 years. 

While aging in wooden casks, especially American oak and French oak casks, whisky undergoes six processes that contribute to its colour and final flavour: extraction, evaporation, oxidation, concentration, filtration, and colouration. Extraction in particular results in whisky acquiring a number of compounds, including aldehydes and acids such as vanillin, vanillic acid, and syringaldehyde. The casks used for aging bourbon whiskey are required to be new (and charred); after being used for this purpose, these casks are typically exported for use in the aging of other whiskies elsewhere. Distillers will sometimes age their whiskey in barrels previously used to age other spirits, such as port, rum or sherry, to impart particular flavours. The size of the barrel also has an effect on the flavour development of the whisky, smaller barrels will contribute more to the whisky due to the higher wood surface to whisky ratio.

During maturation, up to of whisky may evaporate from the cask over a 4 year period. This portion is called the &quot;angel&#x27;s share&quot; by distillers.

===Packaging===
Most whiskies are sold at or near an alcoholic strength of 40% abv, which is the statutory minimum in some countries ‚Äì although the strength can vary, and cask-strength whisky may have as much as twice that alcohol percentage. Enthusiasts often prefer cask strength whisky for its concentrated flavors and customizable dilution experience.

===Exports===
The UK exports more whisky than the rest of the world combined. In 2022, whisky exports from Scotland were valued at ¬£6.25 billion, making up a quarter of all UK food and drink export revenues. In 2012, the US was the largest market for Scotch whisky (¬£655 million), followed by France (¬£535 million). It is also one of the UK&#x27;s overall top five manufacturing export earners and it supports around 42,000 jobs. Principal whisky producing areas include Speyside and the Isle of Islay, where there are nine distilleries providing a major source of employment. In many places, the industry is closely linked to tourism, with many distilleries also functioning as attractions worth ¬£30 million GVA each year.

In 2011, 70% of Canadian whisky was exported, with about 60% going to the US, and the rest mostly to Europe and Asia. 15 million cases of Canadian whisky were sold in the US in 2011.

==Types==

Whisky or whisky-like products are produced in most grain-growing areas. They differ in base product, alcoholic content, and quality.

* Malt whisky ‚Äì made from malted barley
* Grain whisky ‚Äì made from any type of grain

Malts and grains are combined in various ways:

* &quot;Single malt whisky&quot; is whisky from a single distillery made from a mash that uses only one particular malted grain. Unless the whisky is described as &quot;single-cask&quot;, it contains whisky from many casks, and different years, so the blender can achieve a taste recognisable as typical of the distillery. In most cases, single malts bear the name of the distillery, with an age statement and perhaps some indication of some special treatments, such as maturation in a port wine cask.
* &quot;Blended malt whisky&quot; is a mixture of single malt whiskies from different distilleries. If whisky is labelled &quot;pure malt&quot; or just &quot;malt&quot; it is almost certainly a blended malt whisky. This was formerly called a &quot;vatted malt&quot; whisky.
* &quot;Blended whisky&quot; is made from a mixture of different types of whisky. A blend may contain whisky from many distilleries so that the blender can produce a flavour consistent with the brand. The brand name may, therefore, omit the name of a distillery. Most Scotch, Irish and Canadian whisky is sold as part of a blend, even when the spirits are the product of one distillery, as is common in Canada. American blended whisky may contain neutral spirits.
* &quot;Cask strength&quot; (also known as &quot;barrel proof&quot;) whiskies are rare, and usually, only the very best whiskies are bottled in this way. They are bottled from the cask undiluted or only lightly diluted.
* &quot;Single cask&quot; (also known as &quot;single barrel&quot;) whiskies are bottled from an individual cask, and often the bottles are labelled with specific barrel and bottle numbers. The taste of these whiskies may vary substantially from cask to cask within a brand.

== National varieties ==

===American===

American whiskey is distilled from a fermented mash of cereal grain. It must have the taste, aroma, and other characteristics commonly attributed to whiskey.

Some types of whiskey listed in the United States federal regulations are:
* Bourbon whiskey: made from mash that consists of at least 51% corn (maize) and aged in new charred American white oak barrels.
* Corn whiskey: made from mash that consists of at least 80% corn and is not aged, or, if aged, is aged in uncharred or used barrels. 
* Malt whiskey: made from mash that consists of at least 51% malted barley
* Rye whiskey: made from mash that consists of at least 51% rye
* Rye malt whiskey: made from mash that consists of at least 51% malted rye
* Wheat whiskey: made from mash that consists of at least 51% wheat

These types of American whiskey must be distilled to no more than 80% alcohol by volume, and barrelled at no more than 125 proof. Only water may be added to the final product; the addition of colouring or flavouring is prohibited. These whiskeys must be aged in new charred-oak containers, except for corn whiskey, which does not have to be aged. If it is aged, it must be in uncharred oak barrels or in used barrels. Corn whiskey is usually unaged and sold as a legal version of moonshine.

There is no minimum aging period required for a spirit to legally be called whiskey. If one of these whiskey types reaches two years aging or beyond, it is additionally designated as &quot;straight&quot;, e.g., &quot;straight rye whiskey&quot;. A whiskey that fulfils all above requirements but derives from less than 51% of any one specific grain can be called simply a &quot;straight whiskey&quot; without naming a grain.

US regulations recognize other whiskey categories, including:

* Blended whiskey: a mixture that contains a blend of straight whiskeys and neutral grain spirits (NGS), and may also contain flavourings and colourings. The percentage of NGS must be disclosed on the label and may be as much at 80% on a proof gallon basis.
* Light whiskey: produced in the US at more than 80% alcohol by volume and stored in used or uncharred new oak containers
* Spirit whiskey: a mixture of neutral spirits and at least 5% of certain stricter categories of whiskey

Another important labelling in the marketplace is Tennessee whiskey, which includes brands such as Jack Daniel&#x27;s, George Dickel, Collier and McKeel, and Benjamin Prichard&#x27;s. The main difference defining a Tennessee whiskey is that it must be filtered through sugar maple charcoal before aging, known as the Lincoln County Process. (Benjamin Prichard&#x27;s, which is not so filtered, was grandfathered in when the requirement was introduced in 2017.) The rest of the distillation process of Tennessee Whiskey is identical to bourbon whiskey. Whiskey sold as &quot;Tennessee whiskey&quot; is defined as bourbon under NAFTA and at least one other international trade agreement, and is similarly required to meet the legal definition of bourbon under Canadian law.

===Australian===

Australian whiskies have won global whisky awards and medals, including the World Whiskies Awards and Jim Murray&#x27;s Whisky Bible &quot;Liquid Gold Awards&quot;.

===Canadian===
By Canadian law, Canadian whiskies must be produced and aged in Canada, be distilled from a fermented mash of cereal grain, be aged in wood barrels with a capacity limit of for not less than three years, and &quot;possess the aroma, taste and character generally attributed to Canadian whisky&quot;. The terms &quot;Canadian Whisky&quot;, &quot;Rye Whisky&quot;, and &quot;Canadian Rye Whisky&quot; are legally indistinguishable in Canada and do not require any specific grain in their production and are often blends of two or more grains. Canadian whiskies may contain caramel and flavouring in addition to the distilled mash spirits, and there is no maximum limit on the alcohol level of the distillation. The minimum bottling proof is 40% ABV. To be exported under one of the &quot;Canadian Whisky&quot; designations, a whisky cannot contain more than 9.09% imported spirits.

Canadian whiskies are available throughout the world and are a culturally significant export. Well known brands include Crown Royal, Canadian Club, Seagram&#x27;s, and Wiser&#x27;s among others. The historic popularity of Canadian whisky in the United States is partly a result of rum runners illegally importing it into the country during the period of American Prohibition.

===Danish===
Denmark began producing whisky early in 1974. The first Danish single malt to go on sale was Lille Gadeg√•rd from Bornholm, in 2005. Lille Gadeg√•rd is a winery as well, and uses its own wine casks to mature whisky.

The second Danish distilled single malt whisky for sale was Edition No.1 from the Braunstein microbrewery and distillery. It was distilled in 2007, using water from the Greenlandic ice sheet, and entered the market in March 2010.

Another distillery is Stauning Whisky, based in Jutland.

Nyborg Destilleri, from the island Funen (Fyn) in the center of Denmark, produces organic whisky and other organic spirits. The distillery was established in 2009, and in 2020 they launched their first 10 year old whisky.

===English===

Distillers operated in London, Liverpool, and Bristol until the late 19th century, after which production of English single malt whisky ceased until 2003. There are currently 55 distilleries producing English whisky and 20 brands of English whisky. An English whisky GI is currently awaiting approval.

===Finnish===

In 2005, there were two working distilleries in Finland and a third one under construction. Whisky retail sales in Finland are controlled solely by the state alcohol monopoly Alko and advertising of strong alcoholic beverages is banned.

===French===

The distilleries producing French whisky include Glann ar Mor and Warenghem in Brittany, Guillon in the Champagne region, and Grallet-Dupic in Lorraine. Buckwheat whisky is produced by Distillerie des Menhirs in Plomelin, Brittany. In 2022, there were around 100 whisky producers in France. 

The first French whisky was produced at Warenghem distillery in 1987, who then introduced the first single malt French whisky in 1998.

According to a study in 2016, the French are the largest consumers of single malt whisky in the world, especially Scotch.

===German===

German whisky production is a relatively recent phenomenon having only started in the early 1990s. The styles produced resemble those made in Ireland, Scotland and the United States: single malts, blends, wheat, and bourbon-like styles. There is no standard spelling of German whiskies with distilleries using both &quot;whisky&quot; and &quot;whiskey&quot;. In 2008 there were 23 distilleries in Germany producing whisky.

===Indian===

Distilled alcoholic beverages that are labelled as &quot;whisky&quot; in India were commonly blends based on neutral spirits that are distilled from fermented molasses/grain with only a small portion consisting of traditional malt whisky, usually about 10 to 12 percent. Outside India, such a drink would more likely be labelled a rum. According to the Scotch Whisky Association&#x27;s 2013 annual report, &quot;there is no compulsory definition of whisky in India, and the Indian voluntary standard does not require whisky to be distilled from cereals or to be matured.&quot; Molasses-based blends made up 90 percent of the spirits consumed as &quot;whisky&quot; in India, although whisky wholly distilled from malt and other grains is also produced. By 2004 shortages of wheat had been overcome and India was one of the largest producers. Amrut, the first single malt whisky produced in India, was launched in Glasgow, Scotland in 2004. After expanding in Europe it was launched in India in 2010.

By 2022 India produced many whiskies both for the local market‚Äîthe most lucrative market for whisky in the world‚Äîand export. Indian single malts comprised 15% of the local market in 2017, increasing to 33% in 2022. In the three years to 2022 sales of Indian malts increased by an annual average of 42%, compared with 7% for imported rivals.

===Irish===
Irish whiskeys are normally distilled three times, Cooley Distillery being the exception as they also double distil. Though traditionally distilled using pot stills, the column still is now used to produce grain whiskey for blends. By law, Irish whiskey must be produced in Ireland and aged in wooden casks for a period of no less than three years, although in practice it is usually three or four times that period. Unpeated malt is almost always used, the main exception being Connemara Peated Malt whiskey. There are several types of whiskey common to Ireland: single malt, single grain, blended whiskey and single pot still whiskey.

Irish whiskey was once the most popular spirit in the world, though a long period of decline from the late 19th century to the late 20th century greatly damaged the industry, so much so that, although Ireland boasted over 30 distilleries in the 1890s, a century later this number had fallen to just three. However, it has seen a great resurgence in popularity since the late twentieth century, and has been the fastest growing spirit in the world every year since 1990. With exports growing by over 15% per annum in recent years, existing distilleries have been expanded and a number of new distilleries constructed. As of mid 2019, Ireland now has 25 operating distilleries, with 24 more either planned or under development. However, many of these have not been operating long enough to have products sufficiently aged for sale, and only one was operating prior to 1975.

===Japanese===
Japan produces both single malt and blended whiskies. The base is a mash of malted barley, dried in kilns fired with a little peat (although less than what is used for some peated Scotch whiskies), and is distilled using the pot still method. Production began in the 1920s. Before 2000, Japanese whisky was primarily for the domestic market and exports were limited. In recent years, though, Japanese whisky has grown in popularity on the global market. Japanese whiskies such as Suntory and Nikka won many prestigious international awards between 2007 and 2014. Japanese whisky has earned a reputation for quality.

===Mexican===
Mexican whisky is relatively young as it has not been as popular in the country as other distilled drinks but recently many distillers in the country have started to make a push to create homegrown whisky and make it as popular as whisky from other countries.

=== Scotch ===
Whisky made in Scotland is known as Scotch whisky, or simply as &quot;Scotch&quot; (especially in North America).

Scotch whiskies are generally distilled twice, although some are distilled a third time and others even up to twenty times. Scotch Whisky Regulations require anything bearing the label &quot;Scotch&quot; to be distilled and bottled in Scotland and matured for a minimum of three years in oak casks, among other, more specific criteria. Any age statement on the bottle, in the form of a number, must reflect the age of the youngest Scotch whisky used to produce that product. A whisky with an age statement is known as guaranteed age whisky. Scotch whisky without an age statement may, by law, be as young as three years old.

The basic types of Scotch are malt whisky, grain whisky (or a blend of the two) made in Scotland. Scotch malt whiskies were divided into five main regions: Highland, Lowland, Islay, Speyside and Campbeltown. Each of the whisky producing regions has a distinct flavour profile and characteristics to the whisky they produce.

There is also a sixth region recognized by some sources, though not by the Scotch Whisky Association: the Islands, excluding Islay. This unofficial region, (part of the Highlands according to the Association), includes the following whisky-producing islands making Island single malt: Arran, Jura, Mull, Orkney, and Skye.

===Swedish===
Whisky started being produced in Sweden in 1955 by the now defunct &quot;Skeppets whisky&quot; brand. Their last bottle was sold in 1971. In 1999 Mackmyra Whisky was founded and is today the largest producer and has won several awards including European Whisky of the Year in Jim Murray&#x27;s 2011 Whisky Bible and the International Wine &amp; Spirits Competition (IWSC) 2012 Award for Best European Spirits Producer of 2012.

===Taiwanese===

Kavalan was the first private whisky distillery in Taiwan. In January 2010, one of the distillery&#x27;s products caused a stir by beating three Scotch whiskies and one English whisky in a blind tasting organised in Leith, Scotland, to celebrate Burns Night.[4] [5] The distillery was named by &quot;Whisky Magazine&quot; as the World Icons of Whisky &quot;Whisky Visitor Attraction of the Year&quot; for 2011, and its products have won several other awards.[3] In 2012, Kavalan&#x27;s Fino Sherry Cask malt whisky was named &quot;new whisky of the year&quot; by Jim Murray in his guide, &quot;Jim Murray&#x27;s Whisky Bible&quot;.[6] In 2015, Kavalan&#x27;s Vinho Barrique Single Cask was named the world&#x27;s best single malt whisky by World Whiskies Awards.[7] [8] In 2016, Kavalan Amontillado Sherry Single Cask was named the world&#x27;s best single malt whisky by World Whisky Awards.

===Welsh===

Although distillation of whisky in Wales began in Middle Ages there were no commercially operated distilleries during the 20th century. The rise of the temperance movement saw the decline of the commercial production of liquor during the 19th century and in 1894 Welsh whisky production ceased. The revival of Welsh whisky began in the 1990s. Initially a &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; malt whisky was sold as Welsh whisky but was simply blended scotch bottled in Wales. A lawsuit by Scotch distillers ended this enterprise. In 2000, Penderyn Distillery started production of Penderyn single malt whisky. The first bottles went on sale on 1 March 2004, Saint David&#x27;s Day, and it is now sold worldwide. Penderyn Distillery is located in the Brecon Beacons National Park and is considered to be the smallest distillery in the world.

===Other===

ManX Spirit from the Isle of Man is distilled elsewhere and re-distilled in the country of its nominal &quot;origin&quot;. The ManX distillery takes a previously matured Scotch malt whisky and re-distills it.

Whisky DYC is a Spanish whisky made by Destiler√≠as y Crianza del Whisky S.A since 1958.

Frysk Hynder is Frisian single malt, distilled and bottled in the &quot;Us Heit Distillery&quot;. It is the first single malt produced in Friesland, Netherlands.

Puni is an Italian distillery in Glurns that makes single malt whisky, including Alba, which is matured in Marsala casks.

==Chemistry==

===Overview===
Whiskies and other distilled beverages, such as cognac and rum, are complex beverages that contain a vast range of flavouring compounds, of which some 200 to 300 are easily detected by chemical analysis. The flavouring chemicals include &quot;carbonyl compounds, alcohols, carboxylic acids and their esters, nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds, tannins, and other polyphenolic compounds, terpenes, and oxygen-containing, heterocyclic compounds&quot; and esters of fatty acids. The nitrogen compounds include pyridines, picolines and pyrazines. The sulfur compounds include thiophenes and polysulfides which seem to contribute to whiskey&#x27;s roasted character.

===Flavours from treating the malt===
The distinctive smoky flavour found in various types of whisky, especially Scotch, is due to the use of peat smoke to treat the malt.

===Flavours from distillation===
The flavouring of whisky is partially determined by the presence of congeners and fusel oils. Fusel oils are higher alcohols than ethanol, are mildly toxic, and have a strong, disagreeable smell and taste. An excess of fusel oils in whisky is considered a defect. A variety of methods are employed in the distillation process to remove unwanted fusel oils. Traditionally, American distillers focused on secondary filtration using charcoal, gravel, sand, or linen to remove undesired distillates.

Acetals are rapidly formed in distillates and a great many are found in distilled beverages, the most prominent being acetaldehyde diethyl acetal (1,1-diethoxyethane). Among whiskies the highest levels are associated with malt whisky. This acetal is a principal flavour compound in sherry, and contributes fruitiness to the aroma.

The diketone diacetyl (2,3-butanedione) has a buttery aroma and is present in almost all distilled beverages. Whiskies and cognacs typically contain more of this than vodkas, but significantly less than rums or brandies.

Polysulfides and thiophenes enter whiskey through the distillation process and contribute to its roasted flavour.

===Flavours from oak===

Whisky that has been aged in oak barrels absorbs substances from the wood. One of these is cis-3-methyl-4-octanolide, known as the &quot;whisky lactone&quot; or &quot;quercus lactone&quot;, a compound with a strong coconut aroma.

Commercially charred oaks are rich in phenolic compounds. One study identified 40 different phenolic compounds. The coumarin scopoletin is present in whisky, with the highest level reported in Bourbon whiskey.

In an experiment, whiskey aged 3 years in orbit on the International Space Station tasted and measured significantly different from similar test subjects in gravity on Earth. Particularly, wood extractives were more present in the space samples.

===Flavours and colouring from additives===
Depending on the local regulations, additional flavourings and colouring compounds may be added to the whisky. Canadian whisky may contain caramel and flavouring in addition to the distilled mash spirits. Scotch whisky may contain added (E150A) caramel colouring, but no other additives. The addition of flavourings is not allowed in American &quot;straight&quot; whiskey, but is allowed in American blends.

===Chill filtration===
Whisky is often &quot;chill filtered&quot;: chilled to precipitate out fatty acid esters and then filtered to remove them. Most whiskies are bottled this way, unless specified as &quot;unchillfiltered&quot; or &quot;non-chill filtered&quot;. This is done primarily for cosmetic reasons. Unchillfiltered whiskies often turn cloudy when stored at cool temperatures or when cool water is added to them, and this is perfectly normal.

<text>War is an armed conflict between the armed forces of states, or between governmental forces and armed groups that are organized under a certain command structure and have the capacity to sustain military operations, or between such organized groups. It is generally characterized by widespread violence, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties.

While some war studies scholars consider war a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural, economic, or ecological circumstances.
==Etymology==
The English word &quot;war&quot; derives from the 11th-century Old English words and , from Old French ( as in modern French), in turn from the Frankish , ultimately deriving from the Proto-Germanic . The word is related to the Old Saxon , Old High German , and the modern German , meaning .

==History==
Anthropologists disagree about whether warfare was common throughout human prehistory, or whether it was a more recent development, following the invention of agriculture or organised states. It is difficult to determine whether warfare occurred during the Paleolithic due to the sparseness of known remains. Some sources claim that most Middle and Upper Paleolithic societies were possibly fundamentally egalitarian and may have rarely or never engaged in organized violence between groups (i.e. war). Evidence of violent conflict appears to increase during the Mesolithic period, from around 10,000 years ago onwards. 

Raymond Case Kelly, a cultural anthropologist and ethnologist from the US, claimed that before 400,000 years ago, groups of people clashed like groups of chimpanzees, however, later they preferred &quot;positive and peaceful social relations between neighboring groups, such as joint hunting, trading, and courtship.&quot; In his book &quot;Warless Societies and the Origin of War&quot; he explores the origins of modern wars and states that high surplus product encourages conflict, so &quot;raiding often begins in the richest environments&quot;. 
In &quot;War Before Civilization&quot;, Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the University of Illinois, says approximately 90‚Äì95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare, and many fought constantly. Keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were used by primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers. Keeley explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants did not have any formal training. Scarcity of resources meant defensive works were not a cost-effective way to protect the society against enemy raids. William Rubinstein wrote &quot;Pre-literate societies, even those organized in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty.&#x27;&quot; 

Since the rise of the state some 5,000 years ago, military activity has continued over much of the globe. In Europe the oldest known battlefield is thought to date to 1250 BC. The Bronze Age has been described as a key period in the intensification of warfare, with the emergence of dedicated warriors and the development of metal weapons like swords. Two other commonly named periods of increase are the Axial Age and Modern Times. The invention of gunpowder, and its eventual use in warfare, together with the acceleration of technological advances have fomented major changes to war itself.

In &quot;Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990‚Äì1992&quot;, Charles Tilly, professor of history, sociology, and social science at the University of Michigan and the Columbia University, described as &quot;the founding father of 21st-century sociology&quot; argued that ‚ÄòWar made the state, and the state made war,‚Äô saying that wars have led to creation of states which in their turn perpetuate war. Tilly&#x27;s theory of state formation is considered dominant in the state formation literature. 

Since 1945, great power wars, interstate wars, territorial conquests and war declarations have declined in frequency. Wars have been increasingly regulated by international humanitarian law. Battle deaths and casualties have declined, in part due to advances in military medicine and despite advances in weapons. In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place, but no battle has taken place since 1945.

However, war in some aspects has not necessarily declined. Civil wars have increased in absolute terms since 1945. A distinctive feature of war since 1945 is that combat has largely been a matter of civil wars and insurgencies. The number of civil wars declined since 1991.

==Types of warfare==
* Asymmetric warfare is the methods used in conflicts between belligerents of drastically different levels of military capability or size.
* Biological warfare, or germ warfare, is the use of biological infectious agents or toxins such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi against people, plants, or animals. This can be conducted through sophisticated technologies, like cluster munitions, or with rudimentary techniques like catapulting an infected corpse behind enemy lines, and can include weaponized or non-weaponized pathogens.
* Chemical warfare involves the use of weaponized chemicals in combat. Poison gas as a chemical weapon was principally used during World War I, and resulted in over a million estimated casualties, including more than 100,000 civilians.
* Cold warfare is an intense international rivalry without direct military conflict, but with a sustained threat of it, including high levels of military preparations, expenditures, and development, and may involve active conflicts by indirect means, such as economic warfare, political warfare, covert operations, espionage, cyberwarfare, or proxy wars.
* Conventional warfare is a form of warfare between states in which nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons are not used or see limited deployment.
* Cyberwarfare involves the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation&#x27;s information systems.
* Insurgency is a rebellion against authority, where irregular forces take up arms to change an existing political order. An insurgency can be fought via counterinsurgency, and may also be opposed by measures to protect the population, and by political and economic actions of various kinds aimed at undermining the insurgents&#x27; claims against the incumbent regime.
* Information warfare is the application of destructive force on a large scale against information assets and systems, against the computers and networks that support the four critical infrastructures (the power grid, communications, financial, and transportation).
* Nuclear warfare is warfare in which nuclear weapons are the primary, or a major, method of achieving capitulation.
* Radiological warfare is any form of warfare involving deliberate radiation poisoning or contamination of an area with radiological sources.
* Total war is warfare by any means possible, disregarding the laws of war, placing no limits on legitimate military targets, using weapons and tactics resulting in significant civilian casualties, or demanding a war effort requiring significant sacrifices by the friendly civilian population.
* Unconventional warfare can be defined as &quot;military and quasi-military operations other than conventional warfare&quot; and may use covert forces or actions such as subversion, diversion, sabotage, espionage, biowarfare, sanctions, propaganda or guerrilla warfare.

==Aims==
Entities contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to end a war may formulate &quot;war aims&quot; as an evaluation/propaganda tool. War aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve.

=== Definition ===
Fried defines war aims as &quot;the desired territorial, economic, military or other benefits expected following successful conclusion of a war&quot;.

=== Classification ===

Tangible/intangible aims:
* Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of territory (as in the German goal of Lebensraum in the first half of the 20th century) or the recognition of economic concessions (as in the Anglo-Dutch Wars).
* Intangible war aims ‚Äì like the accumulation of credibility or reputation ‚Äì may have more tangible expression (&quot;conquest restores prestige, annexation increases power&quot;).

Explicit/implicit aims:
* Explicit war aims may involve published policy decisions.
* Implicit war aims can take the form of minutes of discussion, memoranda and instructions.

Positive/negative aims:
* &quot;Positive war aims&quot; cover tangible outcomes.
* &quot;Negative war aims&quot; forestall or prevent undesired outcomes.

War aims can change in the course of conflict and may eventually morph into &quot;peace conditions&quot; ‚Äì the minimal conditions under which a state may cease to wage a particular war.

==Effects==
=== Military and civilian casualties ===
Estimates for total deaths due to war vary widely. In one estimate, primitive warfare from 50,000 to 3000 BCE has been thought to have claimed 400million¬±133,000 victims based on the assumption that it accounted for the 15.1% of all deaths. Other scholars find the prehistoric percentage much lower, around 2%, similar to the Neanderthals and ancestors of apes and primates. For the period 3000 BCE until 1991, estimates range from 151million to 2billion.

===Largest wars by death toll===

The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is World War II, from 1939 to 1945, with 70‚Äì85¬†million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests at up to 60¬†million. As concerns a belligerent&#x27;s losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990. 

War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians. For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of the Byelorussian SSR in 1941, some 1.6¬†million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians). Another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict, and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers.

Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century. These are the two World Wars, followed by the Second Sino-Japanese War (which is sometimes considered part of World War II, or as overlapping). Most of the others involved China or neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being over 60¬†million, surpasses all other war-death-tolls.
===On military personnel===
Military personnel subject to combat in war often suffer mental and physical injuries, including depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, disease, injury, and death.

Swank and Marchand&#x27;s World War II study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.

Additionally, it has been estimated anywhere from 18% to 54% of Vietnam war veterans suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder. 

Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to 43 died in the American Civil War, including about 6% in the North and approximately 18% in the South. The war remains the deadliest conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 military personnel. United States military casualties of war since 1775 have totaled over two million. Of the 60¬†million European military personnel who were mobilized in World War I, 8¬†million were killed, 7¬†million were permanently disabled, and 15¬†million were seriously injured.
During Napoleon&#x27;s retreat from Moscow, more French military personnel died of typhus than were killed by the Russians. Of the 450,000 soldiers who crossed the Neman on 25 June 1812, less than 40,000 returned. More military personnel were killed from 1500 to 1914 by typhus than from military action. In addition, if it were not for modern medical advances there would be thousands more dead from disease and infection. For instance, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Royal Navy reported it conscripted 184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 (72%) died of disease or were &#x27;missing&#x27;. It is estimated that between 1985 and 1994, 378,000 people per year died due to war.

===On civilians===
Most wars have resulted in significant loss of life, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to famine, disease, and death in the civilian population). During the Thirty Years&#x27; War in Europe, the population of the Holy Roman Empire was reduced by 15 to 40 percent. Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as genocide, while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war. War also results in lower quality of life and worse health outcomes. A medium-sized conflict with about 2,500 battle deaths reduces civilian life expectancy by one year and increases infant mortality by 10% and malnutrition by 3.3%. Additionally, about 1.8% of the population loses access to drinking water.

Most estimates of World War II casualties indicate around 60¬†million people died, 40¬†million of whom were civilians. Deaths in the Soviet Union were around 27million. Since a high proportion of those killed were young men who had not yet fathered any children, population growth in the postwar Soviet Union was much lower than it otherwise would have been.

===Economic===

Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay war reparations to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of Alsace-Lorraine has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.

Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons. The common view among economic historians is that the Great Depression ended with the advent of World War II. Many economists believe that government spending on the war caused or at least accelerated recovery from the Great Depression, though some consider that it did not play a very large role in the recovery, though it did help in reducing unemployment. In most cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the Franco-Prussian War, and World War I, warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia&#x27;s involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the Russian Revolution of 1917.

====World War II====

World War II was the most financially costly conflict in history; its belligerents cumulatively spent about a trillion U.S. dollars on the war effort (as adjusted to 1940 prices).
The Great Depression of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials.

By the end of the war, 70% of European industrial infrastructure was destroyed. Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the Axis invasion was estimated at a value of 679¬†billion rubles. The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries.

==Theories of motivation==
There are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus about which are most common. Military theorist Carl von Clausewitz said, &quot;Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.&quot;

===Psychoanalytic===
Dutch psychoanalyst Joost Meerloo held that, &quot;War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction.&quot; Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and John Bowlby have argued human beings are inherently violent. This aggressiveness is fueled by displacement and projection where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other races, religions, nations or ideologies. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.

The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of Melanie Klein, thought war was the paranoid or projective &quot;elaboration&quot; of mourning. Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our &quot;love need&quot;: our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.

Despite Fornari&#x27;s theory that man&#x27;s altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace. Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh. He argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek war such as Napoleon and Hitler. Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.

===Evolutionary===
Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and competition over resources; the other sees human warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition.

The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as chimpanzees, as well as in many ant species, group conflict may be a general feature of animal social behavior. Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social organization such as weaponry and states.

Psychologist and linguist Steven Pinker argued that war-related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of victory. He also argued that in order to have credible deterrence against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for revenge as well as for protecting a group&#x27;s (or an individual&#x27;s) reputation (&quot;honor&quot;).
Crofoot and Wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which &quot;coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups&quot;, is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking &quot;tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors&quot;.

Ashley Montagu strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies. Montagu&#x27;s argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g. the Chewong and Semai of the Malay peninsula. Bobbi S. Low has observed correlation between warfare and education, noting societies where warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more aggressive.

===Economic===
War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for natural resources and for wealth. War has also been linked to economic development by economic historians and development economists studying state-building and fiscal capacity. While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme right of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force. Some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including Presidents of the United States and U.S. Generals, expressed support for an economic view of war.
===Marxist===

The Marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great (imperialist) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of capitalism. Marxist economists Karl Kautsky, Rosa Luxemburg, Rudolf Hilferding and Vladimir Lenin theorized that imperialism was the result of capitalist countries needing new markets. Expansion of the means of production is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in consumer demand. Since the workers in a capitalist economy would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.

===Demographic===
Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian and youth bulge theories:

====Malthusian====

Malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict. Pope Urban II in 1095, on the eve of the First Crusade, advocating Crusade as a solution to European overpopulation, said:
This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. Thomas Malthus (1766‚Äì1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or famine. The violent herder‚Äìfarmer conflicts in Nigeria, Mali, Sudan and other countries in the Sahel region have been exacerbated by land degradation and population growth.

====Youth bulge====
According to Heinsohn, who proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the &quot;fighting age&quot; cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with total fertility rates as high as 4‚Äì8 children per woman with a 15‚Äì29-year delay. Heinsohn saw both past &quot;Christianist&quot; European colonialism and imperialism, as well as today&#x27;s Islamist civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges. 

Among prominent historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges are the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including the French Revolution of 1789, and the effect of economic depression upon the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s. The 1994 Rwandan genocide has also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge. Youth bulge theory has been subjected to statistical analysis by the World Bank, Population Action International, and the Berlin Institute for Population and Development. Youth bulge theories have been criticized as leading to racial, gender and age discrimination.
===Cultural===
Geoffrey Parker argues that what distinguishes the &quot;Western way of war&quot; based in Western Europe chiefly allows historians to explain its extraordinary success in conquering most of the world after 1500: The Western way of war rests upon five principal foundations: technology, discipline, a highly aggressive military tradition, a remarkable capacity to innovate and to respond rapidly to the innovation of others andfrom about 1500 onwarda unique system of war finance. The combination of all five provided a formula for military success...The outcome of wars has been determined less by technology, then by better war plans, the achievement of surprise, greater economic strength, and above all superior discipline.

Parker argues that Western armies were stronger because they emphasized discipline, that is, &quot;the ability of a formation to stand fast in the face of the enemy, where they&#x27;re attacking or being attacked, without giving way to the natural impulse of fear and panic.&quot; Discipline came from drills and marching in formation, target practice, and creating small &quot;artificial kinship groups: such as the company and the platoon, to enhance psychological cohesion and combat efficiency.

===Rationalist===

Rationalism is an international relations theory or framework. Rationalism (and Neorealism (international relations)) operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war. Under one game theory approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. Under another rationalist game theory without bargaining, the peace war game, optimal strategies can still be found that depend upon number of iterations played. In &quot;Rationalist Explanations for War&quot;, James Fearon examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war:
* Issue indivisibilities
* Incentives to misrepresent or information asymmetry
* Commitment problems

&quot;Issue indivisibility&quot; occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other. &quot;Information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent&quot; occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state&#x27;s victory or loss. For instance, Geoffrey Blainey argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples of war and demonstrates, &quot;war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power.&quot; Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states&#x27; inability to make credible commitments.

Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of cognitive bias, but are still &quot;as rational as you and me&quot;. According to philosopher Iain King, &quot;Most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of injury...&quot; King asserts that &quot;Most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in groupthink&quot; which is faulty, but still rational. The rationalist theory focused around bargaining, which is currently under debate. The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars.

===Political science===
The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson following World War I. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal, and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first proposed by Kenneth Waltz in &quot;Man, the State, and War&quot; and has been often used by political scientists since then.

====System-level====

There are several different international relations theory schools. Supporters of realism in international relations argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise from the inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called the security dilemma.

Within the realist school as represented by scholars such as Henry Kissinger and Hans Morgenthau, and the neorealist school represented by scholars such as Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer, two main sub-theories are:
# Balance of power theory: States have the goal of preventing a single state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the would-be hegemon&#x27;s persistent attempts at power acquisition. In this view, an international system with more equal distribution of power is more stable, and &quot;movements toward unipolarity are destabilizing.&quot; However, evidence has shown power polarity is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of wars.
# Power transition theory: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on the world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to pre-emptively suppress them. On this view, unlike for balance-of-power theory, wars become &quot;more&quot; probable when power is more equally distributed. This &quot;power preponderance&quot; hypothesis has empirical support.
The two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain disparate events according to the circumstance. Liberalism as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage economic relations. Critics respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits, especially historically if not as much today. Furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency may escalate tensions and lead to conflict. Empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence suggests countries at war do not necessarily trade less with each other.

====Societal-level====
* Diversionary theory, also known as the &quot;scapegoat hypothesis&quot;, suggests the politically powerful may use war to as a diversion or to rally domestic popular support. This is supported by literature showing out-group hostility enhances in-group bonding, and a significant domestic &quot;rally effect&quot; has been demonstrated when conflicts begin. However, studies examining the increased use of force as a function of need for internal political support are more mixed. U.S. war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent U.S. leaders have supported diversionary theory.

====Individual-level====

These theories suggest differences in people&#x27;s personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand. For instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by bounded rationality and various cognitive biases, such as prospect theory.

==Ethics==
The morality of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of years.

The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the just war theory, are &quot;jus ad bellum&quot; and &quot;jus in bello&quot;.

&quot;Jus ad bellum&quot; (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions ‚Äì namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used.

&quot;Jus in bello&quot; (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting war. The two main principles are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered. The principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not. Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent.

The just war theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations and in international law&#x27;s regulations on legitimate war.

Lewis Coser, an American conflict theorist and sociologist, argued that conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new equilibriums are created. Thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society.

==Limiting and stopping==

Religious groups have long formally opposed or sought to limit war as in the Second Vatican Council document &quot;Gaudiem et Spes&quot;: &quot;Any act of war aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas along with their population is a crime against God and man himself. It merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation.&quot;

Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War. In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred in response to the United States invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. Protests opposing the War in Afghanistan occurred in Europe, Asia, and the United States.

== Pauses ==
During a war, the parties may agree to pauses. A ceasefire is a stoppage of a war in which each side agrees with the other to suspend aggressive actions often due to mediation by a third party. Ceasefires may be declared as part of a formal treaty but also as part of an informal understanding between opposing forces. A ceasefire can be temporary with an intended end date or may be intended to last indefinitely. A ceasefire is distinct from an armistice in that the armistice is a formal end to a war whereas a ceasefire may be a temporary stoppage.

The immediate goal of a ceasefire is to stop violence but the underlying purposes of ceasefires vary. Ceasefires may be intended to meet short-term limited needs (such as providing humanitarian aid), manage a conflict to make it less devastating, or advance efforts to peacefully resolve a dispute. An actor may not always intend for a ceasefire to advance the peaceful resolution of a conflict but instead give the actor an upper hand in the conflict (for example, by re-arming and repositioning forces or attacking an unsuspecting adversary), which creates bargaining problems that may make ceasefires less likely to be implemented and less likely to be durable if implemented.

The durability of ceasefire agreements is affected by several factors, such as demilitarized zones, withdrawal of troops and third-party guarantees and monitoring (e.g. peacekeeping). Ceasefire agreements are more likely to be durable when they reduce incentives to attack, reduce uncertainty about the adversary&#x27;s intentions, and when mechanisms are put in place to prevent accidents from spiraling into conflict.

<doc id="33161" wikidata="Q7637" url="?curid=33161" title="Ward Cunningham">
<text>Howard G. Cunningham (born May 26, 1949) is an American computer programmer who developed the first wiki and was a co-author of the &quot;Manifesto for Agile Software Development&quot;. Termed a pioneer, and innovator, he also helped create both software design patterns and extreme programming. He began coding the WikiWikiWeb in 1994, and installed it on c2.com (the website of his software consulting firm) on March 25, 1995, as an add-on to the Portland Pattern Repository. He co-authored (with Bo Leuf) a book about wikis, entitled &quot;The Wiki Way&quot;, and invented the Framework for Integrated Test.

Cunningham was a keynote speaker at the first three instances of the WikiSym conference series on wiki research and practice, and also at the Wikimedia Developer Summit 2017. He was a keynote speaker at the MediaWiki Users and Developers Conference, Spring 2024.

==Early life and career==
Cunningham was born in Michigan City, Indiana, on May 26, 1949. He grew up in Highland, Indiana, where he completed high school. 

Cunningham received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in interdisciplinary engineering (electrical engineering and computer science) and his master&#x27;s degree in computer science from Purdue University, graduating in 1978. He is a co-founder of Cunningham &amp; Cunningham, a software consultancy he started with his wife. 

Cunningham has also served as Director of R&amp;D at Wyatt Software and as Principal Engineer in the Tektronix Computer Research Laboratory. He is founder of The Hillside Group and has served as program chair of the Pattern Languages of Programming conference which it sponsors. 

Cunningham was part of the Smalltalk community.

From December 2003 until October 2005, Cunningham worked for Microsoft in the &quot;Patterns &amp; Practices&quot; group. From October 2005 to May 2007, he held the position of Director of Committer Community Development at the Eclipse Foundation. In May 2009, he joined AboutUs as its chief technology officer. On March 24, 2011 &quot;The Oregonian&quot; reported that Cunningham had departed AboutUs to join the Venice Beach-based CitizenGlobal, a startup working on crowd-sourced video content, as their chief technology officer and the Co-Creation Czar. He remains &quot;an adviser&quot; with AboutUs. In April 2013, Cunningham left CitizenGlobal to work as a programmer at New Relic.

==Ideas and inventions==
Cunningham is well known for a few widely disseminated ideas which he originated and developed. The most famous among these are the wiki and many ideas in the field of software design patterns, made popular by the Gang of Four (GoF). He owns the company Cunningham &amp; Cunningham Inc., a consultancy that has specialized in object-oriented programming. He coined the concept of technical debt and expanded on the idea in 1992.
He created the site (and software) WikiWikiWeb, the first internet wiki, in 1995.

In 2001, he signed the Manifesto for Agile Software Development as a co-author.

When asked in a 2006 interview with internetnews.com whether he considered patenting the wiki concept, he explained that he thought the idea &quot;just sounded like something that no one would want to pay money for.&quot;
Cunningham is interested in tracking the number and location of wiki page edits as a sociological experiment and may even consider the degradation of a wiki page as part of its process to stability. &quot;There are those who give and those who take. You can tell by reading what they write.&quot;

In 2011, Cunningham created Smallest Federated Wiki, a tool for wiki federation, which applies aspects of software development such as forking to wiki pages. 

Cunningham has contributed to the practice of object-oriented programming, in particular the use of pattern languages and (with Kent Beck) the class-responsibility-collaboration cards. He also contributes to the extreme programming software development methodology. Much of this work was done collaboratively on the first wiki site.
===&quot;Cunningham&#x27;s Law&quot;===
Cunningham is credited with the idea: &quot;The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question; it&#x27;s to post the wrong answer.&quot; This refers to the observation that people are quicker to correct a wrong answer than to answer a question. According to Steven McGeady, Cunningham advised him of this on a whim in the early 1980s, and McGeady dubbed this Cunningham&#x27;s Law. Although originally referring to interactions on Usenet, the law has been used to describe how other online communities work, such as Wikipedia. Cunningham relativises his ownership of the law, calling it a &quot;misquote that disproves itself by propagating through the internet&quot; and by saying that he &quot;never suggested asking questions by posting wrong answers&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cunningham lives in Beaverton, Oregon. He holds an amateur radio extra class license issued by the Federal Communications Commission. His call sign is K9OX.

Cunningham is Nike&#x27;s first &quot;Code for a Better World&quot; Fellow.

<doc id="33163" wikidata="Q254" url="?curid=33163" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart">
<text>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 ‚Äì 5 December 1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period. Despite his short life, his rapid pace of composition and proficiency from an early age resulted in more than 800 works representing virtually every Western classical genre of his time. Many of these compositions are acknowledged as pinnacles of the symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral repertoires. Mozart is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music, with his music admired for its &quot;melodic beauty, its formal elegance and its richness of harmony and texture&quot;.

Born in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. At age five, he was already competent on keyboard and violin, had begun to compose, and performed before European royalty. His father took him on a grand tour of Europe and then three trips to Italy. At 17, he was a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position. Mozart&#x27;s search for employment led to positions in Paris, Mannheim, Munich, and again in Salzburg, during which he wrote his five violin concertos, Sinfonia Concertante, and Concerto for Flute and Harp, as well as sacred pieces and masses, the motet¬†&quot;Exsultate Jubilate&quot;, and the opera &quot;Idomeneo,&quot; among other works.

While visiting Vienna in 1781, Mozart was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He stayed in Vienna, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During Mozart&#x27;s early years in Vienna, he produced several notable works, such as the opera &quot;Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail&quot;, the &quot;Great Mass in C minor&quot;, the &quot;Haydn&quot; Quartets and a number of symphonies. Throughout his Vienna years, Mozart composed over a dozen piano concertos, many considered some of his greatest achievements. In the final years of his life, Mozart wrote many of his best-known works, including his last three symphonies, culminating in the &quot;Jupiter&quot; Symphony, the serenade &quot;Eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot;, his Clarinet Concerto, the operas &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, &quot;Cos√¨ fan tutte&quot; and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; and his Requiem. The Requiem was largely unfinished at the time of his death at age 35, the circumstances of which are uncertain and much mythologised.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
====Family and childhood====

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born on 27 January 1756 to Leopold Mozart and Anna Maria, n√©e Pertl, at Getreidegasse 9 in Salzburg. Salzburg was the capital of the Archbishopric of Salzburg, an ecclesiastic principality in the Holy Roman Empire (today in Austria). He was the youngest of seven children, five of whom died in infancy. His elder sister was Maria Anna Mozart, nicknamed &quot;Nannerl&quot;. Mozart was baptised the day after his birth, at St. Rupert&#x27;s Cathedral in Salzburg. The baptismal record gives his name in Latinised form, as &quot;Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart&quot;. He generally called himself &quot;Wolfgang Amad√® Mozart&quot; as an adult, but his name had many variants.

Leopold Mozart, a native of Augsburg, then an Imperial Free City in the Holy Roman Empire, was a minor composer and an experienced teacher. In 1743, he was appointed as the fourth violinist in the musical establishment of Count Leopold Anton von Firmian, the ruling Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. Four years later, he married Anna Maria in Salzburg. Leopold became the orchestra&#x27;s deputy Kapellmeister in 1763. During the year of his son&#x27;s birth, Leopold published a violin textbook, &quot;Versuch einer gr√ºndlichen Violinschule&quot;, which achieved success.

When Nannerl was seven, she began keyboard lessons with her father, while her three-year-old brother looked on. Years later, after her brother&#x27;s death, she reminisced:
He often spent much time at the clavier, picking out thirds, which he was ever striking, and his pleasure showed that it sounded good... In the fourth year of his age his father, for a game as it were, began to teach him a few minuets and pieces at the clavier... He could play it faultlessly and with the greatest delicacy, and keeping exactly in time... At the age of five, he was already composing little pieces, which he played to his father who wrote them down.
These early pieces, K. 1‚Äì5, were recorded in the &quot;Nannerl Notenbuch&quot;. There is some scholarly debate about whether Mozart was four or five years old when he created his first musical compositions, though there is little doubt that Mozart composed his first three pieces of music within a few weeks of each other: K. 1a, 1b, and 1c.

In his early years, Wolfgang&#x27;s father was his only teacher. Along with music, he taught his children languages and academic subjects. Biographer Solomon notes that, while Leopold was a devoted teacher to his children, there is evidence that Mozart was keen to progress beyond what he was taught. His first ink-spattered composition and his precocious efforts with the violin were of his initiative and came as a surprise to Leopold, who eventually gave up composing when his son&#x27;s musical talents became evident.

====1762‚Äì73: Travel====
While Wolfgang was young, his family made several European journeys in which he and Nannerl performed as child prodigies. These began with an exhibition in 1762 at the court of Prince-elector Maximilian III of Bavaria in Munich, and at the Imperial Courts in Vienna and Prague. A long concert tour followed, spanning three and a half years, taking the family to the courts of Munich, Mannheim, Paris, London, Dover, The Hague, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Mechelen and again to Paris, and back home via Z√ºrich, Donaueschingen, and Munich. During this trip, Wolfgang met many musicians and acquainted himself with the works of other composers. A particularly significant influence was Johann Christian Bach, whom he visited in London in 1764 and 1765. When he was eight years old, Mozart wrote his first symphony, most of which was probably transcribed by his father.


The family trips were often challenging, and travel conditions were primitive. They had to wait for invitations and reimbursement from the nobility, and they endured long, near-fatal illnesses far from home: first Leopold (London, summer 1764), then both children (The Hague, autumn 1765). The family again went to Vienna in late 1767 and remained there until December 1768.

After one year in Salzburg, Leopold and Wolfgang set off for Italy, leaving Anna Maria and Nannerl at home. This tour lasted from December 1769 to March 1771. As with earlier journeys, Leopold wanted to display his son&#x27;s abilities as a performer and a rapidly maturing composer. Wolfgang met Josef Mysliveƒçek and Giovanni Battista Martini in Bologna and was accepted as a member of the famous Accademia Filarmonica. There exists a myth, according to which, while in Rome, he heard Gregorio Allegri&#x27;s &quot;Miserere&quot; twice in performance in the Sistine Chapel. Allegedly, he subsequently wrote it out from memory, thus producing the &quot;first unauthorised copy of this closely guarded property of the Vatican&quot;. However, both the origin and plausibility of this account are disputed.

In Milan, Mozart wrote the opera &quot;Mitridate, re di Ponto&quot; (1770), which was performed with success. This led to further opera commissions. He returned with his father twice to Milan (August‚ÄìDecember 1771; October 1772March 1773) for the composition and premieres of &quot;Ascanio in Alba&quot; (1771) and &quot;Lucio Silla&quot; (1772). Leopold hoped these visits would result in a professional appointment for his son, and indeed ruling Archduke Ferdinand contemplated hiring Mozart, but owing to his mother Empress Maria Theresa&#x27;s reluctance to employ &quot;useless people&quot;, the matter was dropped and Leopold&#x27;s hopes were never realised. Toward the end of the journey, Mozart wrote the solo motet &quot;Exsultate, jubilate&quot;, K.165.

===1773‚Äì77: Employment at the Salzburg court===

After finally returning with his father from Italy on 13 March 1773, Mozart was employed as a court musician by the ruler of Salzburg, Prince-Archbishop Hieronymus Colloredo. The composer had many friends and admirers in Salzburg and had the opportunity to work in many genres, including symphonies, sonatas, string quartets, masses, serenades, and a few minor operas. Between April and December 1775, Mozart developed an enthusiasm for violin concertos, producing a series of five (the only ones he ever wrote), which steadily increased in their musical sophistication. The last three‚ÄîK.¬†216, K.¬†218, K.¬†219‚Äîare now staples of the repertoire. In 1776, he turned his efforts to piano concertos, culminating in the E concerto K.¬†271 of early 1777, considered by critics to be a breakthrough work.

Despite these artistic successes, Mozart grew increasingly discontented with Salzburg and redoubled his efforts to find a position elsewhere. One reason was his low salary, 150 florins a year; Mozart longed to compose operas, and Salzburg provided only rare occasions for these. The situation worsened in 1775 when the court theatre was closed, especially since the other theatre in Salzburg was primarily reserved for visiting troupes.

Two long expeditions in search of work interrupted this long Salzburg stay. Mozart and his father visited Vienna from 14 July to 26 September 1773, and Munich from 6December 1774 to March 1775. Neither visit was successful, though the Munich journey resulted in a popular success with the premiere of Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;La finta giardiniera&quot;.

===1777‚Äì78: Journey to Paris===
In August 1777, Mozart resigned his position at Salzburg and on 23 September ventured out once more in search of employment, with visits to Augsburg, Mannheim, Paris, and Munich.

Mozart became acquainted with members of the famous orchestra in Mannheim, the best in Europe at the time. He also fell in love with Aloysia Weber, one of four daughters of a musical family. There were prospects of employment in Mannheim, but they came to nothing, and Mozart left for Paris on 14 March 1778 to continue his search. One of his letters from Paris hints at a possible post as an organist at Versailles, but Mozart was not interested in such an appointment. He fell into debt and took to pawning valuables. The nadir of the visit occurred when Mozart&#x27;s mother was taken ill and died on 3July 1778. There had been delays in calling a doctor‚Äîprobably, according to Halliwell, because of a lack of funds. Mozart stayed with Melchior Grimm at Marquise d&#x27;√âpinay&#x27;s residence, 5 rue de la Chauss√©e-d&#x27;Antin.

While Mozart was in Paris, his father was pursuing opportunities of employment for him in Salzburg. With the support of the local nobility, Mozart was offered a post as court organist and concertmaster. The annual salary was 450 florins, but he was reluctant to accept. By that time, relations between Grimm and Mozart had cooled, and Mozart moved out. After leaving Paris in September 1778 for Strasbourg, he lingered in Mannheim and Munich, still hoping to obtain an appointment outside Salzburg. In Munich, he again encountered Aloysia, now a very successful singer, but she was no longer interested in him. Mozart finally returned to Salzburg on 15 January 1779 and took up his new appointment, but his discontent with Salzburg remained undiminished.

Among the better-known works which Mozart wrote on the Paris journey are the A minor piano sonata, K.¬†310/300d, the &quot;Paris&quot; Symphony (No.¬†31), which were performed in Paris on 12 and 18 June 1778; and the Concerto for Flute and Harp in C major, K. 299/297c.

===Vienna===
====1781: Departure====
In January 1781, Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Idomeneo&quot; premiered with &quot;considerable success&quot; in Munich. The following March, Mozart was summoned to Vienna, where his employer, Archbishop Colloredo, was attending the celebrations for the accession of Joseph II to the Austrian throne. For Colloredo, this was simply a matter of wanting his musical servant to be at hand (Mozart indeed was required to dine in Colloredo&#x27;s establishment with the valets and cooks). He planned a bigger career as he continued in the archbishop&#x27;s service; for example, he wrote to his father:
My main goal right now is to meet the emperor in some agreeable fashion, I am absolutely determined he . I would be so happy if I could whip through my opera for him and then play a fugue or two, for that&#x27;s what he likes.

Mozart did indeed soon meet the Emperor, who eventually was to support his career substantially with commissions and a part-time position.

In the same letter to his father just quoted, Mozart outlined his plans to participate as a soloist in the concerts of the &quot;Tonk√ºnstler-Societ√§t&quot;, a prominent benefit concert series; this plan as well came to pass after the local nobility prevailed on Colloredo to drop his opposition.

Colloredo&#x27;s wish to prevent Mozart from performing outside his establishment was in other cases carried through, raising the composer&#x27;s anger; one example was a chance to perform before the Emperor at Countess Thun&#x27;s for a fee equal to half of his yearly Salzburg salary.

The quarrel with the archbishop came to a head in May: Mozart attempted to resign and was refused. The following month, permission was granted, but in a grossly insulting way: the composer was dismissed literally &quot;with a kick in the arse&quot;, administered by the archbishop&#x27;s steward, Count Arco. Mozart decided to settle in Vienna as a freelance performer and composer.

The quarrel with Colloredo was more difficult for Mozart because his father sided against him. Hoping fervently that he would obediently follow Colloredo back to Salzburg, Mozart&#x27;s father exchanged intense letters with his son, urging him to be reconciled with their employer. Mozart passionately defended his intention to pursue an independent career in Vienna. The debate ended when Mozart was dismissed by the archbishop, freeing himself both of his employer and of his father&#x27;s demands to return. Solomon characterizes Mozart&#x27;s resignation as a &quot;revolutionary step&quot; that significantly altered the course of his life.

====Early years====

Mozart&#x27;s new career in Vienna began well. He often performed as a pianist, notably in a competition before the Emperor with Muzio Clementi on 24 December 1781, and he soon &quot;had established himself as the finest keyboard player in Vienna&quot;. He also prospered as a composer, and in 1782 completed the opera &quot;Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail&quot; (&quot;The Abduction from the Seraglio&quot;), which premiered on 16 July 1782 and achieved considerable success. The work was soon being performed &quot;throughout German-speaking Europe&quot;, and thoroughly established Mozart&#x27;s reputation as a composer.
Near the height of his quarrels with Colloredo, Mozart moved in with the Weber family, who had moved to Vienna from Mannheim. The family&#x27;s father, Fridolin, had died, and the Webers were now taking in lodgers to make ends meet.

====Marriage and children====

After failing to win the hand of Aloysia Weber, who was now married to the actor and artist Joseph Lange, Mozart&#x27;s interest shifted to the third daughter of the family, Constanze.

The courtship did not go entirely smoothly; surviving correspondence indicates that Mozart and Constanze briefly broke up in April 1782, over an episode involving jealousy (Constanze had permitted another young man to measure her calves in a parlour game). Mozart also faced a very difficult task getting permission for the marriage from his father, Leopold.

The marriage took place in an atmosphere of crisis. Daniel Heartz suggests that eventually, Constanze moved in with Mozart, which would have placed her in disgrace by the mores of the time. Mozart wrote to Leopold on 31 July 1782, &quot;All the good and well-intentioned advice you have sent fails to address the case of a man who has already gone so far with a maiden. Further postponement is out of the question.&quot; Heartz relates, &quot;Constanze&#x27;s sister Sophie had tearfully declared that her mother would send the police after Constanze if she did not return home [presumably from Mozart&#x27;s apartment].&quot; On 4 August, Mozart wrote to Baroness von Waldst√§tten, asking: &quot;Can the police here enter anyone&#x27;s house in this way? Perhaps it is only a ruse of Madame Weber to get her daughter back. If not, I know no better remedy than to marry Constanze tomorrow morning or if possible today.&quot;

The couple were finally married on 4August 1782 in St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, the day before his father&#x27;s consenting letter arrived in the mail. In the marriage contract, Constanze &quot;assigns to her bridegroom five hundred gulden which ... the latter has promised to augment with one thousand gulden&quot;, with the total &quot;to pass to the survivor&quot;. Further, all joint acquisitions during the marriage were to remain the common property of both. 

The couple had six children, of whom only two survived infancy:
* Raimund Leopold (17 June19 August 1783)
* Karl Thomas Mozart (21 September 178431 October 1858)
* Johann Thomas Leopold (18 October15 November 1786)
* Theresia Constanzia Adelheid Friedericke Maria Anna (27 December 178729 June 1788)
* Anna Maria (died soon after birth, 16 November 1789)
* Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart (26 July 179129 July 1844)

===1782‚Äì87===

In 1782 and 1783, Mozart became intimately acquainted with the work of Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel as a result of the influence of Gottfried van Swieten, who owned many manuscripts of the Baroque masters. Mozart&#x27;s study of these scores inspired compositions in the Baroque style and later influenced his musical language, for example in fugal passages in &quot;Die Zauberfl√∂te&quot; (&quot;The Magic Flute&quot;) and the finale of Symphony No.¬†41.

In 1783, Mozart and his wife visited his family in Salzburg. His father and sister were cordially polite to Constanze, but the visit prompted the composition of one of Mozart&#x27;s great liturgical pieces, the Mass in C minor. Though not completed, it was premiered in Salzburg, with Constanze singing a solo part.

Mozart met Joseph Haydn in Vienna around 1784, and the two composers became friends. When Haydn visited Vienna, they sometimes played together in an impromptu string quartet. Mozart&#x27;s six quartets dedicated to Haydn (K.¬†387, K.¬†421, K.¬†428, K.¬†458, K.¬†464, and K.¬†465) date from the period 1782 to 1785, and are judged to be a response to Haydn&#x27;s Opus 33 set from 1781. Haydn wrote, &quot;posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years&quot; and in 1785 told Mozart&#x27;s father: &quot;I tell you before God, and as an honest man, your son is the greatest composer known to me by person and repute, he has taste and what is more the greatest skill in composition.&quot;

From 1782 to 1785 Mozart mounted concerts with himself as a soloist, presenting three or four new piano concertos in each season. Since space in the theatres was scarce, he booked unconventional venues: a large room in the Trattnerhof apartment building, and the ballroom of the Mehlgrube restaurant. The concerts were very popular, and his concertos premiered there are still firm fixtures in the repertoire. Solomon writes that during this period, Mozart created &quot;a harmonious connection between an eager composer-performer and a delighted audience, which was given the opportunity of witnessing the transformation and perfection of a major musical genre&quot;.

With substantial returns from his concerts and elsewhere, Mozart and his wife adopted a more luxurious lifestyle. They moved to an expensive apartment, with a yearly rent of 460 florins. Mozart bought a fine fortepiano from Anton Walter for about 900 florins, and a billiard table for about 300. The Mozarts sent their son Karl Thomas to an expensive boarding school and kept servants. During this period Mozart saved little of his income.

On 14 December 1784, Mozart became a Freemason, admitted to the lodge Zur Wohlt√§tigkeit (&quot;Beneficence&quot;). Freemasonry played an essential role in the remainder of Mozart&#x27;s life: he attended meetings, a number of his friends were Masons, and on various occasions, he composed Masonic music, e.g. the Maurerische Trauermusik.

====1786‚Äì87: Return to opera====

Despite the great success of &quot;Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail&quot;, Mozart did little operatic writing for the next four years, producing only two unfinished works and the one-act &quot;Der Schauspieldirektor&quot;. He focused instead on his career as a piano soloist and writer of concertos. Around the end of 1785, Mozart moved away from keyboard writing and began his famous operatic collaboration with the librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte. The year 1786 saw the successful premiere of &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; in Vienna. Its reception in Prague later in the year was even warmer, and this led to a second collaboration with Da Ponte: the opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, which premiered in October 1787 to acclaim in Prague, but less success in Vienna during 1788. The two are among Mozart&#x27;s most famous works and are mainstays of operatic repertoire today, though at their premieres their musical complexity caused difficulty both for listeners and for performers. These developments were not witnessed by Mozart&#x27;s father, who had died on 28 May 1787.

In December 1787, Mozart finally obtained a steady post under aristocratic patronage. Emperor Joseph II appointed him as his &quot;chamber composer&quot;, a post that had fallen vacant the previous month on the death of Gluck. It was a part-time appointment, paying just 800 florins per year, and required Mozart only to compose dances for the annual balls in the Redoutensaal (see &quot;Mozart and dance&quot;). This modest income became important to Mozart when hard times arrived. Court records show that Joseph aimed to keep the esteemed composer from leaving Vienna in pursuit of better prospects.

In 1787, the young Ludwig van Beethoven spent several weeks in Vienna, hoping to study with Mozart. No reliable records survive to indicate whether the two composers ever met.

===Later years===
====1788‚Äì90====


Toward the end of the decade, Mozart&#x27;s circumstances worsened. Around 1786, he ceased to appear frequently in public concerts, and his income shrank. This was a difficult time for musicians in Vienna because of the Austro-Turkish War: both the general level of prosperity and the ability of the aristocracy to support music had declined. In 1788, Mozart saw a 66% decline in his income compared to his best years in 1781.

By mid-1788, Mozart and his family had moved from central Vienna to the suburb of Alsergrund. Although it has been suggested that Mozart aimed to reduce his rental expenses by moving to a suburb, as he wrote in his letter to Michael von Puchberg, Mozart had not reduced his expenses but merely increased the housing space at his disposal. Mozart began to borrow money, most often from his friend and fellow mason Puchberg; &quot;a pitiful sequence of letters pleading for loans&quot; survives. Maynard Solomon and others have suggested that Mozart was suffering from depression, and it seems his musical output slowed. Major works of the period include the last three symphonies (Nos.¬†39, 40, and 41, all from 1788), and the last of the three Da Ponte operas, &quot;Cos√¨ fan tutte&quot;, premiered in 1790.

Around this time, Mozart made some long journeys hoping to improve his fortunes, visiting Leipzig, Dresden, and Berlin in the spring of 1789, and Frankfurt, Mannheim, and other German cities in 1790.

====1791====

Mozart&#x27;s last year was, until his final illness struck, a time of high productivity‚Äîand by some accounts, one of personal recovery. He composed a great deal, including some of his most admired works: the opera &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;; the final piano concerto (K.¬†595 in B); the Clarinet Concerto K.¬†622; the last in his series of string quintets (K.¬†614 in E); the motet Ave verum corpus K.¬†618; and the unfinished Requiem K.¬†626.

Mozart&#x27;s financial situation, a source of anxiety in 1790, finally began to improve. Although the evidence is inconclusive, it appears that wealthy patrons in Hungary and Amsterdam pledged annuities to Mozart in return for the occasional composition. He is thought to have benefited from the sale of dance music written in his role as Imperial chamber composer. Mozart no longer borrowed large sums from Puchberg and began to pay off his debts.

He experienced great satisfaction in the public success of some of his works, notably &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (which was performed several times in the short period between its premiere and Mozart&#x27;s death) and the Little Masonic Cantata K.¬†623, premiered on 17 November 1791.

====Final illness and death====

Mozart fell ill while in Prague for the premiere, on 6September 1791, of his opera &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;, which was written in that same year on commission for Emperor Leopold II&#x27;s coronation festivities. He continued his professional functions for some time and conducted the premiere of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; on 30 September. His health deteriorated on 20 November, at which point he became bedridden, suffering from swelling, pain, and vomiting.

Mozart was nursed in his final days by his wife and her youngest sister and was attended by the family doctor, Thomas Franz Closset. He was mentally occupied with the task of finishing his Requiem, but the evidence that he dictated passages to his student Franz Xaver S√ºssmayr is minimal.

Mozart died in his home on at 12:55 am. The &quot;New Grove&quot; describes his funeral:
Mozart was interred in a common grave, in accordance with contemporary Viennese custom, at the St. Marx Cemetery outside the city on 7December. If, as later reports say, no mourners attended, that too is consistent with Viennese burial customs at the time; later Otto Jahn (1856) wrote that Salieri, S√ºssmayr, van Swieten and two other musicians were present. The tale of a storm and snow is false; the day was calm and mild.

The expression &quot;common grave&quot; refers to neither a communal grave nor a pauper&#x27;s grave, but an individual grave for a member of the common people (i.e., not the aristocracy). Common graves were subject to excavation after ten years; the graves of aristocrats were not.

The cause of Mozart&#x27;s death is not known with certainty. The official record of &quot;hitziges Frieselfieber&quot; (&quot;severe miliary fever&quot;, referring to a rash that looks like millet seeds) is more a symptomatic description than a diagnosis. Researchers have suggested more than a hundred causes of death, including acute rheumatic fever, streptococcal infection, trichinosis, influenza, mercury poisoning, and a rare kidney ailment.

Mozart&#x27;s modest funeral did not reflect his standing with the public as a composer; memorial services and concerts in Vienna and Prague were well attended. Indeed, in the period immediately after his death, his reputation rose substantially. Solomon describes an &quot;unprecedented wave of enthusiasm&quot; for his work; biographies were written first by Schlichtegroll, Niemetschek, and Nissen, and publishers vied to produce complete editions of his works.

==Appearance and character==
Mozart&#x27;s physical appearance was described by tenor Michael Kelly in his &quot;Reminiscences&quot;: &quot;a remarkably small man, very thin and pale, with a profusion of fine, fair hair of which he was rather vain&quot;. His early biographer Niemetschek wrote, &quot;there was nothing special about [his] physique... He was small and his countenance, except for his large intense eyes, gave no signs of his genius.&quot; His facial complexion was pitted, a reminder of his childhood case of smallpox. Of his voice, his wife later wrote that it &quot;was a tenor, rather soft in speaking and delicate in singing, but when anything excited him, or it became necessary to exert it, it was both powerful and energetic.&quot;

He loved elegant clothing. Kelly remembered him at a rehearsal: was on the stage with his crimson pelisse and gold-laced cocked hat, giving the time of the music to the orchestra.&quot; Based on paintings that researchers were able to find of Mozart, he seemed to wear a white wig for most of his formal occasions‚Äîresearchers of the Salzburg Mozarteum declared that only one of his fourteen portraits they had found showed him without his wig.

Mozart usually worked long and hard, finishing compositions at a tremendous pace as deadlines approached. He often made sketches and drafts; unlike Beethoven&#x27;s, these are mostly not preserved, as his wife sought to destroy them after his death.

Mozart lived at the centre of the Viennese musical world and knew a significant number and variety of people: fellow musicians, theatrical performers, fellow Salzburgers, and aristocrats, including some acquaintance with Emperor Joseph II. Solomon considers his three closest friends to have been Gottfried von Jacquin, Count August Hatzfeld, and Sigmund Barisani; others included his elder colleague Joseph Haydn, singers Franz Xaver Gerl and Benedikt Schack, and the horn player Joseph Leutgeb. Leutgeb and Mozart carried on a kind of friendly mockery, often with Leutgeb as the butt of Mozart&#x27;s practical jokes.

He enjoyed billiards, dancing, and kept pets, including a canary, a starling, a dog, and a horse for recreational riding. He had a startling fondness for scatological humour, which is preserved in his surviving letters, notably those written to his cousin Maria Anna Thekla Mozart around 1777‚Äì1778, and in his correspondence with his sister and parents. Mozart also wrote scatological music, a series of canons that he sang with his friends. He had an ear for languages, and having travelled all over Europe as a boy, was fluent in Latin, Italian, and French in addition to his native Salzburg dialect of German. He possibly also understood and spoke some English, having jokingly written &quot;You are an ass&quot; after his 19-year-old student Thomas Attwood made a thoughtless mistake on his exercise papers.

Mozart was raised a Catholic and remained a devout member of the Church throughout his life. He embraced the teachings of Freemasonry in 1784.

==Works, musical style, and innovations==

===Style===
Mozart&#x27;s music, like Haydn&#x27;s, stands as an archetype of the Classical style. At the time he began composing, European music was dominated by the &quot;style galant&quot;, a reaction against the highly evolved intricacy of the Baroque. Progressively, and in large part at the hands of Mozart himself, the contrapuntal complexities of the late Baroque emerged once more, moderated and disciplined by new forms, and adapted to a new aesthetic and social milieu. Mozart was a versatile composer, and wrote in every major genre, including symphony, opera, the solo concerto, chamber music including string quartet and string quintet, and the piano sonata. These forms were not new, but Mozart advanced their technical sophistication and emotional reach. He almost single-handedly developed and popularised the Classical piano concerto. He wrote a great deal of religious music, including large-scale masses, as well as dances, divertimenti, serenades, and other forms of light entertainment.

The central traits of the Classical style are all present in Mozart&#x27;s music. Clarity, balance, and transparency are the hallmarks of his work, but simplistic notions of its delicacy mask the exceptional power of his finest masterpieces, such as the Piano Concerto No. 24 in C minor, K.¬†491; the Symphony No.¬†40 in G minor, K.¬†550; and the opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. Charles Rosen makes the point forcefully:

It is only through recognising the violence and sensuality at the centre of Mozart&#x27;s work that we can make a start towards a comprehension of his structures and an insight into his magnificence. In a paradoxical way, Schumann&#x27;s superficial characterisation of the G minor Symphony can help us to see Mozart&#x27;s daemon more steadily. In all of Mozart&#x27;s supreme expressions of suffering and terror, there is something shockingly voluptuous.

During his last decade, Mozart frequently exploited chromatic harmony. A notable instance is his &quot;String Quartet in C major&quot;, K.¬†465 (1785), whose introduction abounds in chromatic suspensions, giving rise to the work&#x27;s nickname, the &quot;Dissonance&quot; quartet.

Mozart had a gift for absorbing and adapting the valuable features of others&#x27; music. His travels helped in the forging of a unique compositional language. In London as a child, he met J.¬†C. Bach and heard his music. In Paris, Mannheim, and Vienna he met with other compositional influences, as well as the avant-garde capabilities of the Mannheim orchestra. In Italy, he encountered the Italian overture and opera buffa, both of which deeply affected the evolution of his practice. In London and Italy, the galant style was in the ascendent: simple, light music with a mania for cadencing; an emphasis on tonic, dominant, and subdominant to the exclusion of other harmonies; symmetrical phrases; and clearly articulated partitions in the overall form of movements. Some of Mozart&#x27;s early symphonies are Italian overtures, with three movements running into each other; many are homotonal (all three movements having the same key signature, with the slow middle movement being in the relative minor). Others mimic the works of J.¬†C. Bach, and others show the simple rounded binary forms turned out by Viennese composers.
As Mozart matured, he progressively incorporated more features adapted from the Baroque. For example, the Symphony No.¬†29 in A major K.¬†201 has a contrapuntal main theme in its first movement, and experimentation with irregular phrase lengths. Some of his quartets from 1773 have fugal finales, probably influenced by Haydn, who had included three such finales in his recently published Opus¬†20 set. The influence of the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; (&quot;Storm and Stress&quot;) period in music, with its brief foreshadowing of the Romantic era, is evident in the music of both composers at that time. Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No.¬†25 in G minor K.¬†183 is another excellent example.

Mozart would sometimes switch his focus between operas and instrumental music. He produced operas in each of the prevailing styles: opera buffa, such as &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, and &quot;Cos√¨ fan tutte&quot;; opera seria, such as &quot;Idomeneo&quot;; and Singspiel, of which &quot;Die Zauberfl√∂te&quot; is the most famous example by any composer. In his later operas, he employed subtle changes in instrumentation, orchestral texture, and tone colour, for emotional depth and to mark dramatic shifts. Here, his advances in opera and instrumental composing interacted: his increasingly sophisticated use of the orchestra in the symphonies and concertos influenced his operatic orchestration, and his developing subtlety in using the orchestra to psychological effect in his operas was in turn reflected in his later non-operatic compositions.

===K√∂chel catalogue===
For unambiguous identification of works by Mozart, a &quot;K√∂chel catalogue number&quot; is used. This is a unique number assigned, in regular chronological order, to every one of his known works. A work is referenced by the abbreviation &quot;K.&quot; or &quot;KV&quot; followed by this number. The first edition of the catalogue was completed in 1862 by Ludwig von K√∂chel. It has since been repeatedly updated, as scholarly research improves knowledge of the dates and authenticity of individual works.

===Instruments===
Although some of Mozart&#x27;s early pieces were written for harpsichord, he also became acquainted in his early years with fortepianos made by Regensburg builder Franz Jakob Sp√§th. Later when Mozart was visiting Augsburg, he was impressed by Stein fortepianos and shared this in a letter to his father. On 22 October 1777, Mozart had premiered his triple-piano concerto, K. 242, on instruments provided by Stein. The Augsburg Cathedral organist Demmler was playing the first, Mozart the second and Stein the third part. In 1783, when living in Vienna he purchased an instrument by Walter. Leopold Mozart confirmed the attachment which Mozart had with his Walter fortepiano: &quot;It is impossible to describe the hustle and bustle. Your brother&#x27;s pianoforte has been moved at least twelve times from his house to the theatre or to someone else&#x27;s house.&quot;

==Influence==
His most famous pupil was Johann Nepomuk Hummel, a transitional figure between the Classical and Romantic eras whom the Mozarts took into their Vienna home for two years as a child. More important is the influence Mozart had on composers of later generations. Ever since the surge in his reputation after his death, studying his scores has been a standard part of a classical musician&#x27;s training.

Ludwig van Beethoven, Mozart&#x27;s junior by fifteen years, was deeply influenced by his work, with which he was acquainted as a teenager. He is thought to have performed Mozart&#x27;s operas while playing in the court orchestra at Bonn and travelled to Vienna in 1787 hoping to study with the older composer. Some of Beethoven&#x27;s works have direct models in comparable works by Mozart, and he wrote cadenzas (WoO¬†58) to Mozart&#x27;s D minor piano concerto K.¬†466.

Composers have paid homage to Mozart by writing sets of variations on his themes. Beethoven wrote four such sets (Op.¬†66, WoO¬†28, WoO¬†40, WoO¬†46). Others include Fernando Sor&#x27;s Introduction and Variations on a Theme by Mozart (1821), Mikhail Glinka&#x27;s Variations on a Theme from Mozart&#x27;s Opera &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (1822), Fr√©d√©ric Chopin&#x27;s Variations on &quot;L√† ci darem la mano&quot; from &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (1827), and Max Reger&#x27;s Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart (1914), based on the variation theme in the piano sonata K.¬†331. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who revered Mozart, wrote his Orchestral Suite No.¬†4 in G, &quot;Mozartiana&quot; (1887), as a tribute to him.

<text>Wiki software (also known as a wiki engine or a wiki application) is collaborative software that runs a wiki, which allows the users to create and collaboratively edit pages or entries via a web browser. A wiki system is usually a web application that runs on one or more web servers. The content, including previous revisions, is usually stored in either a file system or a database. Wikis are a type of web content management system, and the most commonly supported off-the-shelf software that web hosting facilities offer.

There are dozens of actively maintained wiki engines. They vary in the platforms they run on, the programming language they were developed in, whether they are open-source or proprietary, their support for natural language characters and conventions, and their assumptions about technical versus social control of editing.

== History ==
The first generally recognized &quot;wiki&quot; application, WikiWikiWeb, was created by American computer programmer Ward Cunningham, and launched on c2.com in 1995. &quot;WikiWikiWeb&quot; was also the name of the wiki that ran on the software, and in the first years of wikis&#x27; existence there was no great distinction made between the contents of wikis and the software they ran on, possibly because almost every wiki ran on its own customized software.

Wiki software originated from older version control systems used for documentation and software in the 1980s. By the mid-1990s these generally had web browser interfaces. However, they lacked the ability to easily create links between internal pages without writing HTML code. For WikiWikiWeb, the CamelCase naming convention was used to indicate internal links, without requiring HTML code.

By the time MediaWiki appeared, this convention had been largely abandoned in favor of explicitly marking links in edited source code with double square brackets. Page names thus did not interrupt the flow of English and could follow the standard English capitalization convention. Case insensitivity on the first letter but not subsequent letters supported standard English capitalization conventions and let writers author their pages in ordinary English, with the linking of particular words and phrases afterward. This proved to be the critical change that allowed ordinary authors of English to write wiki pages, and non-technical users to read them. This policy was extended to other natural languages, avoiding the use of unusual-looking text or awkward capitalization that violates the language&#x27;s own rules.

Over the next 10 years, many more wiki applications were written, in a variety of programming languages. After 2005, there began to be a move toward increasing consolidation and standardization: many less-popular wiki applications were gradually abandoned, and fewer new applications were created. Relatively few of the wiki engines currently in use were created after 2006.

Some content management systems, such as Microsoft SharePoint, have also adopted wiki-like functionality.

== Data compatibility ==

In general new wiki engines have not followed the data formats (wiki markup languages) of the existing engines, making them of limited use for those who have already invested in large knowledge bases in existing software. As a rule newer wiki projects have not succeeded in attracting large numbers of users from the existing wiki software base.

The most well-known data format arguably is MediaWiki&#x27;s, and correspondingly has been reimplemented in other wikis:
* WordPress has extensions to display and edit MediaWiki-format pages, and to frame MediaWiki.
* Jamwiki is a MediaWiki clone in Java, that supports MediaWiki-format pages but not extensions.
* Other commercial projects or clones often (or have in the past) follow the MediaWiki format. BlueSpice MediaWiki is the only such software with a free version available.

None of these alternatives support the extensions available under standard MediaWiki, some of which extend or alter its data format.

In 2007 a project named (Wiki)Creole to create a standardized markup language for wikis was completed. As of 2022, the effort has had significant technical success, gaining support through implementation in many engines, but limited social success as it is still relatively unused and unknown, has few cross-markup conversion tools for migrating existing knowledge bases to it and no major engines use it as their native markup syntax.

== Types of usage ==

There are essentially three types of usage for wiki software: public-facing wikis with a potentially large community of readers and editors, private enterprise wikis for data management by corporations and other organizations, and personal wikis, meant to be used by a single person to manage notes, and usually run on a desktop. Some wiki software is specifically geared for one of the usage types, while other software can be used for all three, but contains functionality, either in its core or through plugins, that help with one or more of the usage types.

=== Public wikis ===

Public wikis are usually open to the public to read, edit and comment on some or all of the article space of each wiki. Many offer registration to offer further access and controls to each user and a few have, in-part commercialised aspects or further access, such as the popular wiki farm, Fandom.

MediaWiki is by far the most dominant software as it powers Wikipedia, consistently and by a large margin, the most visited public wiki, it also powers many other public wikis as well. Other wiki engines used regularly for public wikis include MoinMoin and PmWiki, along with many others.

Other Internet websites, based on wiki software, include encyclopedias such as Sensei&#x27;s Library, Parlia, and WikiTree.

=== Enterprise wikis ===

Enterprise wiki software is software intended to be used in a corporate (or organizational) context, especially to enhance internal knowledge sharing. It tends to have a greater emphasis on features like access control, integration with other software, and document management. Most proprietary wiki applications specifically market themselves as enterprise solutions, including Socialtext, Jive, Traction TeamPage and Notion.

Increasingly offerings appear which use the name &#x27;wiki&#x27; but do not offer basic elements common to established wikis, like Wiki Markup and Link-first workflow as in Confluence (since 2018), Full Text Search as in Microsoft Teams, or Version Control.

In addition, some open source wiki applications also describe themselves as enterprise solutions, including XWiki, Foswiki, TWiki, and BlueSpice. Some open-source wiki applications, though they do not specifically bill themselves as enterprise solutions, have marketing materials geared for enterprise users, like Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware and MediaWiki. Many other wiki applications have also been used within enterprises.

Among the many companies and government organizations that use wikis internally are Adobe Systems, Amazon.com, Intel, Microsoft, and the United States intelligence community.

Within organizations, wikis may either add to or replace centrally managed content management systems. Their decentralized nature allows them, in principle, to disseminate needed information across an organization more rapidly and more cheaply than a centrally controlled knowledge repository. Wikis can also be used for document management, project management, customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning, and many other kinds of data management.

Features of wikis which can serve an enterprise include:
* Entering information into quick and easy-to-create pages, including hyperlinks to other corporate information systems like people directories, CMS, applications, and thus to facilitate the buildup of useful knowledge bases.
* Reduces e-mail overload. Wikis allow all relevant information to be shared by people working on a given project. Conversely, only the wiki users interested in a given project need look at its associated wiki pages, in contrast to high-traffic mailing lists which may burden subscribers with many messages, regardless of their relevance. It is also very useful for the project manager to have all the communication stored in one place, which allows them to link the responsibility for every action taken to a particular team member.
* Organizes information. Wikis help users structure information into discoverable and searchable categories. These may arise from users in a bottom-up way. Users can create lists, tables, timelines and other ways of expressing order.
* Builds consensus. Wikis allow structuring the expression of views, on a topic being considered by authors, on the same page. This feature is very useful when writing documentation, preparing presentations, when author opinions differ, and so on.
* Access levels by rights and roles. Users can be denied access to view and/or edit given pages, depending upon their department or role within the organization.
* Knowledge management with comprehensive searches. This includes document management, project management, and knowledge repositories useful during times of employee turnover or retirement.

=== Personal wikis ===
Software that is specifically designed for running personal wikis includes Tomboy, PmWiki, and ConnectedText (now discontinued). Other, more general, wiki applications have components geared for individual users, including MoinMoin (which offers a &quot;DesktopEdition&quot;), and TiddlyWiki.

== Editing ==

Most wiki software uses a special syntax, known as wiki markup, for users to format the text, instead of requiring them to enter in HTML. Some wiki applications also include a WYSIWYG editor, either instead of or in addition to the wiki markup editing.

Based on the atomic property of database systems, any edit should be traced. On wiki software, the chronology of edits (e.g. published by Internet users) in any given article may be locally saved with a common .xml file extension by people having administrator rights.

== Hosted application ==

There are a variety of wiki hosting services, otherwise known as wiki farms, that host users&#x27; wikis on a server. Some wiki software is only available in hosted form: PBworks, Wetpaint and Wikispaces are all examples of wiki hosting services that run on code that is only available on those sites. Other wiki software is available in both hosted and downloadable form, including Confluence, Socialtext, MediaWiki and XWiki.

== Additional features ==

=== Content-management features ===

Wiki software can include features that come with traditional content management systems, such as calendars, to-do lists, blogs and discussion forums. All of these can either be stored via versioned wiki pages, or simply be a separate piece of functionality. Software that supports blogs with wiki-style editing and versioning is sometimes known as &quot;bliki&quot; software.

Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware is an example of wiki software that is designed to support such features at its core. Many of the enterprise wiki applications, such as TWiki, Confluence and SharePoint, also support such features, as do open-source applications like MediaWiki and XWiki, via plugins.

=== Scripting ===

Some wiki applications let users embed scripting-style calls into wiki pages, which are processed by the wiki&#x27;s parser and run either when the page is saved or when it is displayed. XWiki and MediaWiki are examples of such applications.

Specifically XWiki offers support for the following scripting languages: Groovy, Velocity, Ruby, Python, PHP or more generally any JSR223 scripting language.

=== Semantic annotation ===

Wiki software can let users store data via the wiki, in a way that can be exported via the Semantic Web, or queried internally within the wiki. A wiki that allows such annotation is known as a semantic wiki. The current best-known semantic wiki software is Semantic MediaWiki, a plugin to MediaWiki.

=== Mobile access ===

Some wiki software have special handling for accessing by mobile devices, such as mobile phones. This is usually done by displaying conservative HTML coding.

=== Offline viewing and editing ===

Various approaches to providing wiki functionality when the user is not online have been tried. For users who need to simply read the wiki&#x27;s content when offline, a copy of the content can often be made easily; in the case of Wikipedia, CD-ROMs and printed versions have been made of parts of Wikipedia&#x27;s content.

Allowing offline editing, however (where the changes are synchronized when the user is back online), is a much more difficult process. One approach to doing this is using a distributed revision control system as a backend of the wiki, in peer-to-peer style. With this approach, there is no central store of the wiki&#x27;s content; instead, every user keeps a complete copy of the wiki locally, and the software handles merging and propagating of changes when they are made. This is the approach taken by the ikiwiki engine (which can use the distributed revision control system Git as its back-end), and Code Co-op (a distributed revision control system that includes a wiki component). 

=== Distributing and decentralizing ===

Wiki software can be distributed. XWiki is able to function in this way. Smallest Federated Wiki promotes a federation of wiki servers,

There has also been research done on allowing Wikipedia to be run as a decentralized wiki.

<text>Westphalia (; ; ) is a region of northwestern Germany and one of the three historic parts of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It has an area of and 7.9¬†million inhabitants.

The territory of the region is almost identical with the historic Province of Westphalia, which was a part of the Kingdom of Prussia from 1815 to 1918 and the Free State of Prussia from 1918 to 1946. In 1946, Westphalia merged with North Rhine, another former part of Prussia, to form the newly created state of North Rhine-Westphalia. In 1947, the state with its two historic parts was joined by a third one: Lippe, a former principality and free state.

The seventeen districts and nine independent cities of Westphalia and the single district of Lippe are members of the Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association (&quot;Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe&quot;).

Previous to the formation of Westphalia as a province of Prussia and later state part of North Rhine-Westphalia, the term &quot;Westphalia&quot; was applied to different territories of different sizes such as the western part of the ancient Duchy of Saxony, the Duchy of Westphalia or the Kingdom of Westphalia. The Westphalian language, a variant of the Low German language, is spoken beyond modern Westphalia&#x27;s borders in neighbouring southwestern Lower Saxony and northwestern Hesse.

==Geography==

===Landscapes===
Being a part of the North German Plain, most of Westphalia&#x27;s north is flat. In the south the German Central Uplands emerge. Westphalia is divided into the following landscapes.

Flat to hilly &quot;( and under):&quot; East Westphalia, M√ºnsterland, eastern Ruhr Metropolitan Area, Tecklenburg Land, Westphalian Hellweg

Hilly to mountainous &quot;(up to ):&quot; Westphalian part of the Sauerland, Siegerland, Wittgenstein

===Largest cities===

===Rivers===
Westphalia is roughly the region in between the rivers Rhine and Weser, located both north and south of the Ruhr River. Other important rivers are the Ems and the Lippe.

===Mountains===
The Langenberg () and the Kahler Asten () in the Sauerland part of the Rothaar Mountains are Westphalia&#x27;s and also North Rhine-Westphalia&#x27;s highest mountains.

===Westphalia and Eastphalia===
The term &quot;Westphalia&quot; contrasts with the much less used term &quot;Eastphalia&quot;, which roughly covers the southeastern part of the present-day state of Lower Saxony, western Saxony-Anhalt and northern Thuringia.

===Division===
Westphalia is divided into three governmental districts. These are subdivided into further districts and independent cities.

All districts and independent cities of the governmental districts of Arnsberg and M√ºnster are considered to be a part of Westphalia as a historic region. The District of Lippe as successor of the Free State of Lippe in the Governmental District of Detmold is rather considered to be a separate historic region.

==Symbols==
===Coat of arms===

====Current use====
The traditional symbol of Westphalia is the Westphalian Steed: a white horse on a red field. It is derived from the Saxon Steed in the coat of arms of the medieval Duchy of Saxony which most of today&#x27;s Westphalia was part of. In official contexts the coat of arms of Westphalia is being used by the Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association, which represents these two historic parts of North Rhine-Westphalia.

The coat of arms of North Rhine-Westphalia uses the Westphalian Steed to represent Westphalia as one of its parts alongside the Lippish Rose representing Lippe and the Rhine River representing the Northern Rhineland.

====Previous use====
Prussia already used the Westphalian Steed in the coat of arms of its Province of Westphalia.

====Similar versions====
The coat of arms of Lower Saxony uses a different version of the Saxon Steed since the state also covers large parts of the Old Saxons&#x27; duchy.

===Flag===

====Current use====
The colours of Westphalia are white and red. The flag of the Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association uses these colours with the Westphalian coat of arms in its centre.

The flag of North Rhine-Westphalia is a combination of the Northern Rhineland&#x27;s colours green/white and the Westphalian white/red.

====Previous use====
The flag of the Prussian Province of Westphalia already displayed the colours white and red.

====Similar versions====
The flag of Lower Saxony shows the colours of Germany and the Saxon Steed.

===Anthem===
Composed in Iserlohn in 1886 by Emil Rittershaus, the &quot;Westfalenlied&quot; is an unofficial anthem of Westphalia.

==Identity==
While the Northern Rhineland, Westphalia and Lippe are different historic territories of today&#x27;s North Rhine-Westphalia, the old border between the former Rhine Province and the Province of Westphalia is also a language border. While in Westphalia and Lippe, people tend to speak West Low German dialects and especially the Westphalian variant of the Low German language, Central German and Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the Northern Rhineland.

These different regional identities are often being emphasized by different majorities of denomination between Roman Catholics and Lutheran Protestants. The different majorities date back to the days of the territorial fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire (of the German Nation) which existed until 1806. The M√ºnsterland and the region around Paderborn for instance are still mainly Catholic regions because of the former existence of the prince-bishoprics of M√ºnster and Paderborn. The mainly Reformed Lippe was even able to retain its independence as a small state within Germany in the form of a principality until 1918 and as a free state until 1946. This continues to influence the identity of its people who often distinguish themselves from neighbouring regions such as East Westphalia.

In addition to these historic, lingual and religious aspects, there are some regional differences in culture and mentality. That is why many of the citizens of North Rhine-Westphalia rather see themselves either as &quot;Rhinelanders&quot;, &quot;Westphalians&quot; or &quot;Lippers&quot; rather than as &quot;North Rhine-Westphalians&quot;.

==History==

Westphalia is known for the 1648 Peace of Westphalia which ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War, as the two treaties were signed in M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck.

It is one of the regions that were part of all incarnations of the German state since the Early Middle Ages: the Holy Roman Empire, the Confederation of the Rhine, the German Confederation, the North German Confederation, the German Empire, the Weimar Republic and National Socialist Germany. After World War II it was a part of the British occupation zone which merged with the American zone to become the Bizone in 1947 and again merged with the French zone to become the Trizone in 1948. The current Federal Republic of Germany was founded on these territories making Westphalia a part of West Germany. It is a part of united Germany since 1990.

===Roman incursion===
Around AD 1 there were numerous incursions through Westphalia and perhaps even some permanent Roman or Romanized settlements. The Battle of the Teutoburg Forest took place near Osnabr√ºck, which at this time was a place of settlement of the Westphalians, who were a part of the Germanic tribe of the Saxons. Some of the tribes who fought at this battle came from the area of Westphalia.

===Charlemagne===
Charlemagne is thought to have spent considerable time in Paderborn and nearby parts. His Saxon Wars also partly took place in what is thought of as Westphalia today. Popular legends link his adversary Widukind to places near Detmold, Bielefeld, Lemgo, Osnabr√ºck and other places in Westphalia. Widukind was buried in Enger, which is also a subject of a legend.

===Middle Ages===

Along with Eastphalia, Angria and Nordalbingia, Westphalia &quot;(Westfalahi)&quot; was originally a district of the Duchy of Saxony. At the time, large portions of its territory in the north lay in what today is Lower Saxony. Following the deposition of the Saxon duke Henry the Lion in 1180 and the subsequent belittlement of the duchy, Westphalia was elevated to a duchy in its own right by Emperor Barbarossa. The Duchy of Westphalia comprised only a small area south of the Lippe River.

Modern Westphalia was a part of the Lower Rhenish‚ÄìWestphalian Circle of the Holy Roman Empire, which comprised territories of Lower Lorraine, Frisia and parts of the former Duchy of Saxony.

===Early modern era===

As a result of the Protestant Reformation, there was no dominant religion in Westphalia. Roman Catholicism and Lutheranism were on a relatively equal footing. Lutheranism was strong in the eastern and northern parts with numerous free churches. M√ºnster and especially Paderborn were considered to be Catholic. Osnabr√ºck was divided almost equally between Catholicism and Protestantism.

Parts of Westphalia came under Brandenburg-Prussian control during the 17th and 18th centuries, but most of it remained divided by duchies and other areas of feudal power. The Peace of Westphalia of 1648, signed in M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck, ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The concept of nation-state sovereignty resulting from the treaty became known as &quot;Westphalian sovereignty&quot;.

===Prussia===

After the defeat of the Prussian Army by the French at the Battle of Jena‚ÄìAuerstedt, the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 made the easternmost portion of today&#x27;s Westphalia part of the French client Kingdom of Westphalia until 1813, when the kingdom was dissolved by the Russians. While this state shared its name with the historical region, it only contained a relatively small part of Westphalia, rather consisting of mostly Hessian and Eastphalian regions.

Following to the Congress of Vienna, Prussia received a large amount of territories in the Westphalian region and created the Province of Westphalia in 1815. After in 1816, the former Duchy of Westphalia and the counties of Wittgenstein and in 1851 the condominium of Lippstadt had joined the province, Westphalia had received its modern territorial shape.

In 1816, the governmental districts of Arnsberg, Minden and M√ºnster were created.

===Modern Westphalia===
After World War II in 1946, the present state of North Rhine-Westphalia was created by the British military government from the former Prussian Province of Westphalia and the northern half of the former Prussian Rhine Province. The old governmental districts of 1816 stayed in place. When in 1947 the former Free State of Lippe with its capital Detmold joined North Rhine-Westphalia, the &quot;Governmental District of Minden&quot; was enlarged by this territory and renamed &quot;Governmental District of Detmold&quot;. In total, North Rhine-Westphalia is subdivided into five governmental districts &quot;(Regierungsbezirke)&quot;. Westphalia today consists of the old governmental districts of Arnsberg and M√ºnster and of Detmold (including the District of Lippe, which is a separate historical region). Inhabitants of the region call themselves Westphalians and their home region Westphalia even though there is no administrative division by that name.

==Economy==
Westphalia is home to the headquarters of Westfalia-Werke, the contractor that built the Volkswagen Westfalia Campers.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Candide:&quot; The protagonist of Voltaire&#x27;s novella of the same name, resides in Westphalia in the beginning of the story.

<text>West Germany is the common English name for the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] from its formation on 23 May 1949 until its reunification with East Germany on 3 October 1990. It is sometimes known as the Bonn Republic () after its capital city of Bonn. During the Cold War, the western portion of Germany and the associated territory of West Berlin were parts of the Western Bloc. West Germany was formed as a political entity during the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II, established from 12 states formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. 

At the onset of the Cold War, Europe was divided between the Western and Eastern blocs. Germany was divided into the two countries. Initially, West Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany, representing itself as the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871‚Äì1945 German Reich.

Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form Baden-W√ºrttemberg in 1952, and the Saarland joined West Germany as a state in 1957 after it had been separated as the Saar Protectorate from Allied-occupied Germany by France (the separation had been not legal as it had not been recognized by the Allied Control Council). In addition to the resulting ten states, West Berlin was considered an unofficial eleventh state. While &quot;de jure&quot; not part of West Germany, for Berlin was under the control of the Allied Control Council (ACC), West Berlin politically aligned itself with West Germany and was directly or indirectly represented in its federal institutions.

The foundation for the influential position held by Germany today was laid during the economic miracle of the 1950s (), when West Germany rose from the enormous destruction wrought by World War II to become the world&#x27;s second-largest economy. The first chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who remained in office until 1963, worked for a full alignment with the NATO rather than neutrality, and secured membership in the military alliance. Adenauer was also a proponent of agreements that developed into the present-day European Union. When the G6 was established in 1975, there was no serious debate as to whether West Germany would become a member.

Following the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, symbolised by the opening of the Berlin Wall, both states took action to achieve German reunification. East Germany voted to dissolve and accede to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1990. The five post-war states () were reconstituted, along with the reunited Berlin, which ended its special status and formed an additional . They formally joined the federal republic on 3 October 1990, raising the total number of states from ten to sixteen, and ending the division of Germany. The reunited Germany is the direct continuation of the state previously informally called West Germany and not a new state, as the process was essentially a voluntary act of accession: the Federal Republic of Germany was enlarged to include the additional six states of the German Democratic Republic. The expanded Federal Republic retained West Germany&#x27;s political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances such as the United Nations, NATO, OECD, and the European Economic Community.

==Naming conventions==
Before reunification, Germany was divided between the (Federal Republic of Germany; commonly known as West Germany) and the (DDR; German Democratic Republic; commonly known as East Germany). Reunification was achieved by accession () of the German Democratic Republic to the Federal Republic of Germany, so became the official name of reunified Germany.

In East Germany, the terms (West Germany) or (West German Federal Republic) were preferred during the 1950s and 1960s. This changed under its constitutional amendment in 1974, when the idea of a single German nation was abandoned by East Germany. As a result, it officially considered West Germans and West Berliners as foreigners. The initialism &quot;BRD&quot; (FRG in English) began to prevail in East German usage in the early 1970s, beginning in the newspaper . Other Eastern Bloc nations soon followed suit.

In 1965, the West German Federal Minister of All-German Affairs, Erich Mende, had issued the &quot;Directives for the Appellation of Germany&quot;, recommending avoiding the initialism BRD. On 31 May 1974, the heads of West German federal and state governments recommended always using the full name in official publications. From then on, West German sources avoided the abbreviated form, with the exception of left-leaning organizations which embraced it. In November 1979, the federal government informed the Bundestag that the West German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF had agreed to refuse to use the initialism.

The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code of West Germany was DE (for &quot;Deutschland&quot;, Germany), which has remained the country code of Germany after reunification. ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are the most widely used country codes, and the DE code is notably used as a country identifier, extending the postal code and as the Internet&#x27;s country code top-level domain .de. The less widely used ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code of West Germany was DEU, which has remained the country code of reunified Germany. The now deleted codes for East Germany, on the other hand, were DD in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and DDR in ISO 3166-1 alpha-3.

The colloquial term &quot;West Germany&quot; or its equivalent was used in many languages. was also a widespread colloquial form used in German-speaking countries, usually without political overtones.

==History==

On 4‚Äì11 February 1945 leaders from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union held the Yalta Conference where future arrangements regarding post-war Europe and Allied strategy against Japan in the Pacific were negotiated. They agreed that the boundaries of Germany as at 31 December 1937 would be chosen as demarcating German national territory from German-occupied territory; all German annexations after 1937 were automatically null. Subsequently, and into the 1970s, the West German state was to maintain that these 1937 boundaries continued to be &#x27;valid in international law&#x27;, although the Allies had already agreed amongst themselves that the territories east of the Oder-Neisse line must be transferred to Poland and the Soviet Union in any peace agreement. The conference agreed that post-war Germany, minus these transfers, would be divided into four occupation zones: a French Zone in the far west; a British Zone in the northwest; an American Zone in the south; and a Soviet Zone in the East. Berlin was separately divided into four zones. These divisions were not intended to dismember Germany, only to designate zones of administration.

By the subsequent Potsdam Agreement, the four Allied Powers asserted joint sovereignty over &quot;Germany as a whole&quot;, defined as the totality of the territory within the occupation zones. Former German areas east of the rivers Oder and Neisse and outside of &#x27;Germany as a whole&#x27; were officially separated from German sovereignty in August 1945 and transferred from Soviet military occupation to Polish and Soviet (in the case of the territory of Kaliningrad) civil administration, their Polish and Soviet status to be confirmed at a final Peace Treaty. Following wartime commitments by the Allies to the governments-in-exile of Czechoslovakia and Poland, the Potsdam Protocols also agreed to the &#x27;orderly and humane&#x27; transfer to Germany as a whole of the ethnic German populations in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Eight million German expellees and refugees eventually settled in West Germany. Between 1946 and 1949, three of the occupation zones began to merge. First, the British and American zones were combined into the quasi-state of Bizonia. Soon afterwards, the French zone was included into Trizonia. Conversely, the Soviet zone became East Germany. At the same time, new federal states () were formed in the Allied zones; replacing the geography of pre-Nazi German states such as the Free State of Prussia and the Republic of Baden, which had derived ultimately from former independent German kingdoms and principalities.

In the dominant post-war narrative of West Germany, the Nazi regime was characterised as having been a &#x27;criminal&#x27; state, illegal and illegitimate from the outset; while the Weimar Republic was characterised as having been a &#x27;failed&#x27; state, whose inherent institutional and constitutional flaws had been exploited by Hitler in his illegal seizure of dictatorial powers. Consequently, following the death of Hitler in 1945 and the subsequent capitulation of the German Armed Forces, the national political, judicial, administrative, and constitutional instruments of both Nazi Germany and the Weimar Republic were understood as entirely defunct, such that a new West Germany could be established in a condition of constitutional nullity. Nevertheless, the new West Germany asserted its fundamental continuity with the &#x27;overall&#x27; German state that was held to have embodied the unified German people since the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848, and which from 1871 had been represented within the German Reich; albeit that this overall state had become effectively dormant long before 8 May 1945.

In 1949 with the continuation and aggravation of the Cold War (for example, the Berlin Airlift of 1948‚Äì49), the two German states that had originated in the Western Allied and the Soviet Zones respectively became known internationally as West Germany and East Germany. Commonly known in English as East Germany, the former Soviet occupation zone in Germany, eventually became the &quot;German Democratic Republic&quot; or &quot;GDR&quot;. In 1990 West Germany and East Germany jointly signed the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany (also known as the &quot;Two-plus-Four Agreement&quot;); by which transitional status of Germany following World War II was definitively ended and the Four Allied powers relinquished their joint residual sovereign authority for Germany as a whole including the area of West Berlin which had officially remained under Allied occupation for the purposes of international and GDR law (a status that the Western countries applied to Berlin as a whole despite the Soviets declaring the end of occupation of East Berlin unilaterally many decades before). The Two-plus-Four Agreement also saw the two parts of Germany confirm their post-war external boundaries as final and irreversible (including the 1945 transfer of former German lands east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line), and the Allied Powers confirmed their consent to German Reunification. From 3 October 1990, after the reformation of the GDR&#x27;s , the East German states and East Berlin joined the Federal Republic.

===NATO membership===
With territories and frontiers that coincided largely with the ones of old Middle Ages East Francia and the 19th-century Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded on 23 May 1949 under the terms of the Bonn‚ÄìParis conventions, whereby it obtained &quot;the full authority of a sovereign state&quot; on 5 May 1955 (although &quot;full sovereignty&quot; was not obtained until the Two Plus Four Agreement in 1990). The former occupying Western troops remained on the ground, now as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which West Germany joined on 9 May 1955, promising to rearm itself soon.

West Germany became a focus of the Cold War with its juxtaposition to East Germany, a member of the subsequently founded Warsaw Pact. The former capital, Berlin, had been divided into four sectors, with the Western Allies joining their sectors to form West Berlin, while the Soviets held East Berlin. West Berlin was completely surrounded by East German territory and had suffered a Soviet blockade in 1948‚Äì49, which was overcome by the Berlin airlift.

The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 led to U.S. calls to rearm West Germany to help defend Western Europe from the perceived Soviet threat. Germany&#x27;s partners in the European Coal and Steel Community proposed to establish a European Defence Community (EDC), with an integrated army, navy and air force, composed of the armed forces of its member states. The West German military would be subject to complete EDC control, but the other EDC member states (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) would cooperate in the EDC while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces.

Though the EDC treaty was signed (May 1952), it never entered into force. France&#x27;s Gaullists rejected it on the grounds that it threatened national sovereignty, and when the French National Assembly refused to ratify it (August 1954), the treaty died. The French Gaullists and communists had killed the French government&#x27;s proposal. Then other means had to be found to allow West German rearmament. In response, at the London and Paris Conferences, the Brussels Treaty was modified to include West Germany, and to form the Western European Union (WEU). West Germany was to be permitted to rearm (an idea many Germans rejected), and have full sovereign control of its military, called the . The WEU, however, would regulate the size of the armed forces permitted to each of its member states. Also, the German constitution prohibited any military action, except in the case of an external attack against Germany or its allies (). Also, Germans could reject military service on grounds of conscience, and serve for civil purposes instead.

The three Western Allies retained occupation powers in Berlin and certain responsibilities for Germany as a whole. Under the new arrangements, the Allies stationed troops within West Germany for NATO defense, pursuant to stationing and status-of-forces agreements. With the exception of 55,000 French troops, Allied forces were under NATO&#x27;s joint defense command. (France withdrew from the collective military command structure of NATO in 1966.)

===Reforms during the 1960s===
Konrad Adenauer was 73 years old when he became chancellor in 1949, and for this reason he was initially reckoned as a caretaker. However, he ruled for 14 years. The grand statesman of German postwar politics had to be dragged‚Äîalmost literally‚Äîout of office in 1963.
In October 1962 the weekly news magazine published an analysis of the West German military defence. The conclusion was that there were several weaknesses in the system. Ten days after publication, the offices of in Hamburg were raided by the police and quantities of documents were seized. Chancellor Adenauer proclaimed in the that the article was tantamount to high treason and that the authors would be prosecuted. The editor/owner of the magazine, Rudolf Augstein spent some time in jail before the public outcry over the breaking of laws on freedom of the press became too loud to be ignored. The FDP members of Adenauer&#x27;s cabinet resigned from the government, demanding the resignation of Franz Josef Strauss, Defence Minister, who had decidedly overstepped his competence during the crisis. Adenauer was still wounded by his brief run for president, and this episode damaged his reputation even further. He announced that he would step down in the fall of 1963. His successor was to be Ludwig Erhard.

In the early 1960s, the rate of economic growth slowed down significantly. In 1962 growth rate was 4.7% and the following year, 2.0%. After a brief recovery, the growth rate slowed again into a recession, with no growth in 1967.

A new coalition was formed to deal with this problem. Erhard stepped down in 1966 and was succeeded by Kurt Georg Kiesinger. He led a grand coalition between West Germany&#x27;s two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new emergency acts: the grand coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required for their ratification. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a state of emergency.
During the time leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the Free Democratic Party, the rising West German student movement, a group calling itself (&quot;Democracy in Crisis&quot;) and members of the Campaign against Nuclear Armament. A key event in the development of open democratic debate occurred in 1967, when the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, visited West Berlin. Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the Opera House where he was to attend a special performance. Supporters of the Shah (later known as ), armed with staves and bricks attacked the protesters while the police stood by and watched. A demonstration in the centre was being forcibly dispersed when a bystander named Benno Ohnesorg was shot in the head and killed by a plainclothes policeman. (It has now been established that the policeman, Kurras, was a paid spy of the East German security forces.) Protest demonstrations continued, and calls for more active opposition by some groups of students were made, which was declared by the press, especially the tabloid newspaper, as a massive disruption to life in Berlin, in a massive campaign against the protesters. Protests against the US intervention in Vietnam, mingled with anger over the vigour with which demonstrations were repressed led to mounting militance among the students at the universities in Berlin. One of the most prominent campaigners was a young man from East Germany called Rudi Dutschke who also criticised the forms of capitalism that were to be seen in West Berlin. Just before Easter 1968, a young man tried to kill Dutschke as he bicycled to the student union, seriously injuring him. All over West Germany, thousands demonstrated against the Springer newspapers which were seen as the prime cause of the violence against students. Trucks carrying newspapers were set on fire and windows in office buildings broken.

In the wakes of these demonstrations, in which the question of America&#x27;s role in Vietnam began to play a bigger role, came a desire among the students to find out more about the role of the parent-generation in the Nazi era. The proceedings of the War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg had been widely publicised in Germany but until a new generation of teachers, educated with the findings of historical studies, could begin to reveal the truth about the war and the crimes committed in the name of the German people, one courageous attorney, Fritz Bauer patiently gathered evidence on the guards of the concentration camp and about twenty were put on trial in Frankfurt in 1963. Daily newspaper reports and visits by school classes to the proceedings revealed to the German public the nature of the concentration camp system and it became evident that the was of vastly greater dimensions than the German population had believed. (The term &quot;Holocaust&quot; for the systematic mass-murder of Jews first came into use in 1979, when a 1978 American mini-series with that name was shown on West German television.) The processes set in motion by the Auschwitz trial reverberated decades later.

The calling in question of the actions and policies of government led to a new climate of debate. The issues of emancipation, colonialism, environmentalism and grass roots democracy were discussed at all levels of society. In 1979 the environmental party, the Greens, reached the 5% limit required to obtain parliamentary seats in the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen provincial election. Also of great significance was the steady growth of a feminist movement in which women demonstrated for equal rights. Until 1977, a married woman had to have the permission of her husband if she wanted to take on a job or open a bank account. Further reforms in 1979 to parental rights law gave equal legal rights to the mother and the father, abolishing the legal authority of the father. Parallel to this, a gay movement began to grow in the larger cities, especially in West Berlin, where homosexuality had been widely accepted during the twenties in the Weimar Republic.

Anger over the treatment of demonstrators following the death of Benno Ohnesorg and the attack on Rudi Dutschke, coupled with growing frustration over the lack of success in achieving their aims led to growing militance among students and their supporters. In May 1968, three young people set fire to two department stores in Frankfurt; they were brought to trial and made very clear to the court that they regarded their action as a legitimate act in what they described as the &quot;struggle against imperialism&quot;. The student movement began to split into different factions, ranging from the unattached liberals to the Maoists and supporters of direct action in every form‚Äîthe anarchists. Several groups set as their objective the aim of radicalising the industrial workers and taking an example from activities in Italy of the Red Brigades (), many students went to work in the factories, but with little or no success. The most notorious of the underground groups was the Red Army Faction which began by making bank raids to finance their activities and eventually went underground having killed a number of policemen, several bystanders and eventually two prominent West Germans, whom they had taken captive in order to force the release of prisoners sympathetic to their ideas. In the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name &quot;RAF&quot;. The last action took place in 1993 and the group announced it was giving up its activities in 1998. Evidence that the groups had been infiltrated by German Intelligence undercover agents has since emerged, partly through the insistence of the son of one of their prominent victims, the State Counsel Siegfried Buback.

===Willy Brandt===

In October 1969 Willy Brandt became chancellor. He maintained West Germany&#x27;s close alignment with the United States and focused on strengthening European integration in western Europe, while launching the new policy of &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; aimed at improving relations with Eastern Europe. Brandt was controversial on both the right wing, for his &quot;Ostpolitik&quot;, and on the left wing, for his support of American policies, including the Vietnam War, and right-wing authoritarian regimes. The Brandt Report became a recognised measure for describing the general North-South divide in world economics and politics between an affluent North and a poor South. Brandt was also known for his fierce anti-communist policies at the domestic level, culminating in the &quot;Radikalenerlass&quot; (Anti-Radical Decree) in 1972. In 1970, while visiting a memorial to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising crushed by the Germans, Brandt unexpectedly knelt and meditated in silence, a moment remembered as the Kniefall von Warschau.

Brandt resigned as chancellor in 1974, after G√ºnter Guillaume, one of his closest aides, was exposed as an agent of the Stasi, the East German secret service.

===Helmut Schmidt===
Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt (SPD) formed a coalition and he served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leading FDP official, became Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister. Schmidt, a strong supporter of the European Community (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to &quot;the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA&quot;. Mounting external problems forced Schmidt to concentrate on foreign policy and limited the domestic reforms that he could carry out. The USSR upgraded its intermediate-range missiles, which Schmidt complained was an unacceptable threat to the balance of nuclear power, because it increased the likelihood of political coercion and required a western response. NATO responded in the form of its twin-track policy. The domestic reverberations were serious inside the SPD, and undermined its coalition with the FDP. One of his major successes, in collaboration with French President Val√©ry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, was the launching of the European Monetary System (EMS) in April 1978.

===Helmut Kohl===
In October 1982 the SPD‚ÄìFDP coalition fell apart when the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU Chairman Helmut Kohl as Chancellor in a constructive vote of no confidence. Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, due to the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens, who received 5.6% of the vote.

In January 1987 the Kohl‚ÄìGenscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. Kohl&#x27;s CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, slipped from 48.8% of the vote in 1983 to 44.3%. The SPD fell to 37%; long-time SPD Chairman Brandt subsequently resigned in April 1987 and was succeeded by Hans-Jochen Vogel. The FDP&#x27;s share rose from 7% to 9.1%, its best showing since 1980. The Greens&#x27; share rose to 8.3% from their 1983 share of 5.6%.

===Reunification===
With the collapse of eastern bloc in 1989, symbolised by the opening of the Berlin Wall, there was a rapid move towards German reunification; and a final settlement of the post-war special status of Germany. Following democratic elections, East Germany declared its accession to the Federal Republic subject to the terms of the Unification Treaty between the two states; and then both West Germany and East Germany radically amended their respective constitutions in accordance with that Treaty&#x27;s provisions. East Germany then dissolved itself, and its five post-war states () were reconstituted, along with the reunited Berlin which ended its special status and formed an additional . They formally joined the Federal Republic on 3 October 1990, raising the number of states from 10 to 16, ending the division of Germany. The expanded Federal Republic retained West Germany&#x27;s political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances like NATO and the European Union.

The official German reunification ceremony on 3 October 1990 was held at the building, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President Richard von Weizs√§cker, former Chancellor Willy Brandt and many others. One day later, the parliament of the united Germany would assemble in an act of symbolism in the Reichstag building.

However, at that time, the role of Berlin had not yet been decided upon. Only after a fierce debate, considered by many as one of the most memorable sessions of parliament, the concluded on 20 June 1991, with quite a slim majority, that both government and parliament should move to Berlin from Bonn.

==Government and politics==
Political life in West Germany was remarkably stable and orderly. The Adenauer era (1949‚Äì63) was followed by a brief period under Ludwig Erhard (1963‚Äì66) who, in turn, was replaced by Kurt Georg Kiesinger (1966‚Äì69). All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by the united caucus of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), either alone or in coalition with the smaller Free Democratic Party (FDP) or other right-wing parties.
Kiesinger&#x27;s 1966‚Äì69 &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; was between West Germany&#x27;s two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new emergency acts‚Äîthe Grand Coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required to see them in. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a state of emergency.

Leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the FDP, the rising German student movement, a group calling itself (&quot;Democracy in a State of Emergency&quot;) and the labour unions. Demonstrations and protests grew in number, and in 1967 the student Benno Ohnesorg was shot in the head by a policeman. The press, especially the tabloid newspaper, launched a campaign against the protesters.

By 1968, a stronger desire to confront the Nazi past had come into being. In the 1970s environmentalism and anti-nationalism became fundamental values among left-wing Germans. As a result, in 1979 the Greens were able to reach the 5% minimum required to obtain parliamentary seats in the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen state election, and with the foundation of the national party in 1980 developed into one of the most politically successful green movements in the world.

Another result of the unrest in the 1960s was the founding of the Red Army Faction (RAF). The RAF was active from 1968, carrying out a succession of terrorist attacks in West Germany during the 1970s. Even in the 1990s, attacks were still being committed under the name &quot;RAF&quot;. The last action took place in 1993, and in 1998 the group announced it was ceasing activities.

In the 1969 election, the SPD gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP. SPD leader and Chancellor Willy Brandt remained head of government until May 1974, when he resigned after the Guillaume affair, in which a senior member of his staff was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the . However, the affair is widely considered to have been merely a trigger for Brandt&#x27;s resignation, not a fundamental cause. Instead, Brandt, dogged by scandal relating to alcohol and depression as well as the economic fallout of the 1973 oil crisis, almost seems simply to have had enough. As Brandt himself later said, &quot;I was exhausted, for reasons which had nothing to do with the process going on at the time&quot;.

Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt (SPD) then formed a government, continuing the SPD‚ÄìFDP coalition. He served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leading FDP official, was Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister in the same years. Schmidt, a strong supporter of the European Community (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to &quot;the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA&quot;.

The goals of SPD and FDP however drifted apart in the late 1970s and early 1980s. On 1 October 1982 the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU Chairman Helmut Kohl as Chancellor in a constructive vote of no confidence. Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, because of the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens, who received 5.6% of the vote.

In January 1987 the Kohl‚ÄìGenscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. The Social Democrats concluded that not only were the Greens unlikely to form a coalition, but also that such a coalition would be far from a majority. Neither condition changed until 1998.

===Denazification===

Denazification was an Allied initiative to rid German politics, judiciary, society, culture, press and economy of Nazi ideology and personnel following the Second World War. It was carried out by removing those who had been Nazi Party or SS members from positions of power and influence, by disbanding the organizations associated with Nazism, and by trying prominent Nazis for war crimes. The program was hugely unpopular in West Germany and was opposed by the new government of Konrad Adenauer. In 1951, several laws were passed granting amnesties and ending denazification. As a result, many people with a former Nazi past ended up again in the political apparatus of West Germany.

Between 1951 and 1953, there was even an effort by a clandestine group of former Nazi functionaries, known as the Naumann Circle, to infiltrate the Free Democratic Party (FDP) in order to lay the groundwork for an eventual return to power. Although this effort was exposed and disrupted, many former Nazis still attained positions of power and influence in the political system. West German President (1974‚Äì1979) Walter Scheel and Chancellor (1966‚Äì1969) Kurt Georg Kiesinger were both former members of the Nazi Party. Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s State Secretary Hans Globke had played a major role in drafting the antisemitic Nuremberg Race Laws in Nazi Germany. In 1957, 77% of the West German Ministry of Justice&#x27;s senior officials were former Nazi Party members.

===Geographical distribution of government===
In West Germany, most of the political agencies and buildings were located in Bonn, while the German Stock Market was located in Frankfurt which became the economic center. The judicial branch of both the German Federal Constitutional Court () and the highest Court of Appeals, were located in Karlsruhe.

The West German government was known to be much more decentralised than its state socialist East German counterpart, the former being a federal state and the latter a unitary one. Whilst East Germany was divided into 15 administrative districts (), which were merely local branches of the national government, West Germany was divided into states () with independently elected state parliaments and control of the , the second legislative chamber of the Federal Government.

===Foreign relations===
====Position towards East Germany====

The official position of West Germany concerning East Germany at the outset was that the West German government was the only democratically elected, and therefore the only legitimate, representative of the German people. According to the Hallstein Doctrine, any country (with the exception of the USSR) that recognised the authorities of the German Democratic Republic would not have diplomatic relations with West Germany.

In the early 1970s, Willy Brandt&#x27;s policy of &quot;&quot; led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany. The Treaty of Moscow (August 1970), the Treaty of Warsaw (December 1970), the Four Power Agreement on Berlin (September 1971), the Transit Agreement (May 1972), and the Basic Treaty (December 1972) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both German states joining the United Nations. The Hallstein Doctrine was relinquished, and West Germany ceased to claim an exclusive mandate for Germany as a whole.

Following the Ostpolitik, the West German view was that East Germany was a &quot;de facto&quot; government within a single German nation and a &quot;de jure&quot; state organisation of parts of Germany outside the Federal Republic. The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognise the GDR &quot;de jure&quot; as a sovereign state under international law; while at the same time acknowledging that, within the structures of international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state. By distinction, West Germany then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries, not only the &quot;de facto&quot; and &quot;de jure&quot; government, but also the sole &quot;de jure&quot; legitimate representative of a dormant &quot;Germany as whole&quot;. The two Germanies relinquished any claim to represent the other internationally, which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of each other as both capable of representing their own populations &quot;de jure&quot; in participating in international bodies and agreements, such as the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act.

This assessment of the Basic Treaty was confirmed in a decision of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1973;
: &quot;... the German Democratic Republic is in the international-law sense a State and as such a subject of international law. This finding is independent of recognition in international law of the German Democratic Republic by the Federal Republic of Germany. Such recognition has not only never been formally pronounced by the Federal Republic of Germany but on the contrary repeatedly explicitly rejected. If the conduct of the Federal Republic of Germany towards the German Democratic Republic is assessed in the light of its d√©tente policy, in particular the conclusion of the Treaty as de facto recognition, then it can only be understood as de facto recognition of a special kind. The special feature of this Treaty is that while it is a bilateral Treaty between two States, to which the rules of international law apply and which like any other international treaty possesses validity, it is between two States that are parts of a still existing, albeit incapable of action as not being reorganized, comprehensive State of the Whole of Germany with a single body politic.&quot;

The West German Constitution (, &quot;Basic Law&quot;) provided two articles for the unification with other parts of Germany:

* Article 23 provided the possibility for other parts of Germany to join the Federal Republic (under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany).
* Article 146 provided the possibility for unification of all parts of Germany under a new constitution.

After the peaceful revolution of 1989 in East Germany, the Volkskammer of the GDR on 23 August 1990 declared the accession of East Germany to the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law and thus initiated the process of reunification, to come into effect on 3 October 1990. Nevertheless, the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms and conditions; including fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former GDR and the Federal Republic now recognising each another as separate sovereign states in international law. This treaty was then voted into effect on 20 September 1990 by both the Volkskammer and the Bundestag by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR and the re-establishment of on the territory of East Germany; and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic. Amongst these amendments was the repeal of the very Article 23 in respect of which the GDR had nominally declared its postdated accession to the Federal Republic.

The two German states entered into a currency and customs union in July 1990, and on 3 October 1990, the German Democratic Republic dissolved and the re-established five East German (as well as a unified Berlin) joined the Federal Republic of Germany, bringing an end to the East‚ÄìWest divide.

==Economy==
===Economic miracle===
The West German (&quot;economic miracle&quot;, coined by &quot;The Times&quot;) began in 1950. This improvement was sustained by the currency reform of 1948 which replaced the with the and halted rampant inflation. The Allied dismantling of the West German coal and steel industry finally ended in 1950.

As demand for consumer goods increased after World War II, the resulting shortage helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of German products. At the time Germany had a large pool of skilled and cheap labour, partly as a result of the flight and expulsion of Germans from Central and Eastern Europe, which affected up to 16.5 million Germans. This helped Germany to more than double the value of its exports during the war. Apart from these factors, hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population and in the late 1950s and 1960s extra labour supplied by thousands of (&quot;guest workers&quot;) provided a vital base for the economic upturn. This would have implications later on for successive German governments as they tried to assimilate this group of workers.

With the dropping of Allied reparations, the freeing of German intellectual property and the impact of the Marshall Plan stimulus, West Germany developed one of the strongest economies in the world, almost as strong as before the Second World War. The East German economy showed a certain growth, but not as much as in West Germany, partly because of continued reparations to the USSR.

In 1952, West Germany became part of the European Coal and Steel Community, which would later evolve into the European Union. On 5 May 1955 West Germany was declared to have the &quot;authority of a sovereign state&quot;. The British, French and U.S. militaries remained in the country, just as the Soviet Army remained in East Germany. Four days after obtaining the &quot;authority of a sovereign state&quot; in 1955, West Germany joined NATO. The UK and the USA retained an especially strong presence in West Germany, acting as a deterrent in case of a Soviet invasion. In 1976 West Germany became one of the founding nations of the Group of Six (G6). In 1973, West Germany‚Äîhome to roughly 1.26% of the world&#x27;s population‚Äîfeatured the world&#x27;s fourth largest GDP of 944 billion (5.9% of the world total). In 1987 the FRG held a 7.4% share of total world production.

==Demographics==

===Population and vital statistics===
Total population of West Germany from 1950 to 1990, as collected by the .

===Religion===

Religious affiliation in West Germany decreased from the 1960s onward. Religious affiliation declined faster among Protestants than among Catholics, causing the Roman Catholic Church to overtake the EKD as the largest denomination in the country during the 1970s.


==Culture==

In many aspects, German culture continued in spite of the dictatorship and wartime. Old and new forms coexisted next to each other, and the American influence, already strong in the 1920s, grew.

===Literary scene===
Besides the interest in the older generation of writers, new authors emerged on the background of the experiences of war and after war period. Wolfgang Borchert, a former soldier who died young in 1947, is one of the best known representatives of the . Heinrich B√∂ll is considered an observer of the young Federal Republic from the 1950s to the 1970s, and caused some political controversies because of his increasingly critical view on society. The Frankfurt Book Fair (and its Peace Prize of the German Book Trade) soon developed into a regarded institution. Exemplary for West Germany&#x27;s literature are ‚Äì among others ‚Äì Siegfried Lenz (with &quot;The German Lesson&quot;) and G√ºnter Grass (with &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; and &quot;The Flounder&quot;).

===Sport===
In the 20th century, association football became the largest sport in Germany. The Germany national football team, established in 1900, continued its tradition based in the Federal Republic of Germany, winning the 1954 FIFA World Cup in a stunning upset dubbed the miracle of Bern. Earlier, the German team was not considered part of the international top. The 1974 FIFA World Cup was held in West German cities and West Berlin. After having been beaten by their East German counterparts in the first round, the team of the German Football Association won the cup again, defeating the Netherlands 2‚Äì1 in the final. With the process of unification in full swing in the summer of 1990, the Germans won a third World Cup, with players that had been capped for East Germany not yet permitted to contribute. European championships have been won too, in 1972 and 1980.

After both Olympic Games of 1936 had been held in Germany, Munich was selected to host the 1972 Summer Olympics. These were also the first summer games in which the East Germans showed up with the separate flag and anthem of the GDR. Since the 1950s, Germany at the Olympics had been represented by a united team led by the pre-war German NOC officials as the IOC had denied East German demands for a separate team. At the 1956 Summer Olympics, the Olympic teams of West Germany, East Germany, and Saarland were merged to represent Germany together. Four years earlier Saarland had attended as separate teams while East Germany had not attended. After 1956, 1962, and 1964; East Germany competed in the Summer Olympics as a separate member of the IOC.

The 800-page &quot;Doping in Germany from 1950 to today&quot; study details how the West German government helped fund a wide-scale doping programme. West Germany encouraged and covered up a culture of doping across many sports for decades. 

As in 1957, when the Saarland acceded, East German sport organisations ceased to exist in late 1990 as their subdivisions and their members joined their Western counterparts. Thus, the present German organisations and teams in football, Olympics and elsewhere are identical to those that had been informally called &quot;West German&quot; before 1991. The only differences were a larger membership and a different name used by some foreigners. These organisations and teams in turn mostly continued the traditions of those that represented Germany before the Second World War, and even the First World War, thus providing a century-old continuity despite political changes. On the other hand, the separate East German teams and organisations were founded in the 1950s; they were an episode lasting less than four decades, yet quite successful in that time.

West Germany played 43 matches at the European Championships, more than any other national team.

<text>West Berlin ( or , ) was a political enclave which comprised the western part of Berlin from 1948 until 1990, during the Cold War. Although West Berlin lacked any sovereignty and was under military occupation until German reunification in 1990, the territory was claimed by the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG or West Germany), despite being entirely surrounded by the German Democratic Republic (GDR or East Germany). The legality of this claim was contested by the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries. However, West Berlin de facto aligned itself politically with the FRG from May 1949 and was thereafter treated as a &quot;de facto&quot; city-state of that country. After 1949, it was directly or indirectly represented in the institutions of the FRG, and most of its residents were citizens of the FRG.

West Berlin was formally controlled by the Western Allies and entirely surrounded by East Berlin and East Germany. West Berlin had great symbolic significance during the Cold War, as it was widely considered by westerners an &quot;island of freedom.&quot; It was heavily subsidized by West Germany as a &quot;showcase of the West.&quot; A wealthy city, West Berlin was noted for its distinctly cosmopolitan character, and as a centre of education, research and culture. With about two million inhabitants, West Berlin had the largest population of any city in Germany during the Cold War era.

West Berlin was east and north of the inner German border and only accessible by land from West Germany by narrow rail and highway corridors. It consisted of the American, British, and French occupation sectors established in 1945. The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, physically separated West Berlin from its East Berlin and East German surroundings until it fell in 1989. On 3 October 1990, the day Germany was officially reunified, East and West Berlin united, joined the Federal Republic as a Stadtstaat (city-state) and eventually became the capital of Germany again.

==Origins==
The London Protocol of 1944 and the Potsdam Agreement established the legal framework for the occupation of Germany in the wake of World War II. According to these agreements, Germany would be formally under the administration of four Allies (the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France) until a German government &quot;acceptable to all parties&quot; could be established. The territory of Germany, as it existed in 1937, would be reduced by most of &quot;Eastern Germany&quot; thus creating the former eastern territories of Germany. The remaining territory would be divided into four zones, each administered by one of the four allied countries. Berlin, which was surrounded by the Soviet zone of occupation‚Äînewly established in most of Middle Germany‚Äîwould be similarly divided, with the Western Allies occupying an enclave consisting of the western parts of the city. According to the agreement, the occupation of Berlin could end only as a result of a agreement. The Western Allies were guaranteed three air corridors to their sectors of Berlin, and the Soviets also informally allowed road and rail access between West Berlin and the western parts of Germany.

At first, this arrangement was intended to be of a temporary administrative nature, with all parties declaring that Germany and Berlin would soon be reunited. However, as the relations between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union soured and the Cold War began, the joint administration of Germany and Berlin broke down. Soon, Soviet-occupied Berlin and western-occupied Berlin had separate city administrations. In 1948, the Soviets tried to force the Western Allies out of Berlin by imposing a land blockade on the western sectors‚Äîthe Berlin Blockade. The West responded by using its air corridors for supplying their part of the city with food and other goods through the Berlin Airlift. In May 1949, the Soviets lifted the blockade, and West Berlin as a separate city with its own jurisdiction was maintained.

Following the Berlin Blockade, normal contacts between East and West Berlin resumed. This was temporary until talks were resumed. In 1952, the East German government began sealing its borders, further isolating West Berlin. As a direct result, electrical grids were separated and phone lines were cut. The Volkspolizei and Soviet military personnel also continued the process of blocking all the roads leading away from the city, resulting in several armed standoffs and at least one skirmish with the French Gendarmerie and the Bundesgrenzschutz that June. However, the culmination of the schism did not occur until 1961 with the construction of the Berlin Wall.

==Legal status==
From the legal theory followed by the Western Allies, the occupation of most of Germany ended in 1949 with the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) on 23 May and of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) on 7 October. Under Article 127 of the Basic Law (or constitution) of the Federal Republic, provision was made for federal laws to be extended to Greater Berlin (as Berlin was called during the 1920 expansion of its municipal boundaries) as well as Baden, Rhineland-Palatinate and W√ºrttemberg-Hohenzollern within one year of its promulgation. However, because the occupation of Berlin could be ended only by a quadripartite agreement, Berlin remained an occupied territory under the formal sovereignty of the allies. Hence, the Basic Law was not fully applicable to West Berlin.

On 4 August 1950, the House of Representatives, the city&#x27;s legislature, passed a new constitution, declaring Berlin to be a state of the Federal Republic and the provisions of the Basic Law as binding law superior to Berlin state law (Article 1, clauses 2 and 3). However, that became statutory law only on 1 September and only with the inclusion of the western Allied provision according to which Art. 1, clauses 2 and 3, were deferred for the time being; the clauses became valid law only on 3 October 1990 (the day of Germany&#x27;s unification). It stated:

Article 87 is interpreted as meaning that during the transitional period Berlin shall possess none of the attributes of a twelfth Land. The provision of this Article concerning the Basic Law will only apply to the extent necessary to prevent a conflict between this Law and the Berlin Constitution...

Thus, civic liberties and personal rights (except for the privacy of telecommunications) guaranteed by the Basic Law were also valid in West Berlin.

In addition, West German federal statutes could only take effect in West Berlin with the approval of the city&#x27;s legislature.
The ambiguous legal status of the city, then still legally styled as Greater Berlin (although technically only comprising the western sectors), meant that West Berliners were not eligible to vote in federal elections. In their notification of permission of 12 May 1949 the three western military governors for Germany explained their proviso in No. 4, as follows:

A third reservation concerns the participation of Greater Berlin in the Federation. We interpret the effect of Articles 23 and 144 (2) of the Basic Law as constituting acceptance of our previous request that while Berlin may not be accorded voting membership in the Bundestag or Bundesrat nor be governed by the Federation she may, nevertheless, designate a small number of representatives to the meetings of those legislative bodies.

Consequently, West Berliners were indirectly represented in the Bundestag in Bonn by 22 non-voting delegates chosen by the House of Representatives. Similarly, the Senate (the city&#x27;s executive) sent four non-voting delegates to the Bundesrat. In addition, when the first direct elections to the European Parliament were held in 1979, West Berlin&#x27;s three members were instead indirectly elected by the House of Representatives.

However, as West German citizens, West Berliners were able to stand for election in West Germany. For example, Social Democrat Willy Brandt, who eventually became Chancellor, was elected via his party&#x27;s list of candidates. The West German government considered all West Berliners as well as all citizens of the GDR to be citizens of West Germany. Male residents of West Berlin were exempt from the Federal Republic&#x27;s compulsory military service. This exemption made the city a popular destination for West German young people, which resulted in a flourishing counterculture, which in turn became one of the defining features of the city.

The Western Allies remained the ultimate political authorities in West Berlin. All legislation of the House of Representatives, whether of the West Berlin legislature or adopted federal law, only applied under the proviso of confirmation by the three Western Allied commanders-in-chief. If they approved a bill, it was enacted as part of West Berlin&#x27;s statutory law. If the commanders-in-chief rejected a bill, it did not become law in West Berlin; this, for example, was the case with West German laws on military duty. West Berlin was run by the elected Governing Mayor and Senate seated at Rathaus Sch√∂neberg. The Governing Mayor and Senators (ministers) had to be approved by the Western Allies and thus derived their authority from the occupying forces, not from their electoral mandate.

The Soviets unilaterally declared the occupation of East Berlin at an end along with the rest of East Germany. This move was, however, not recognised by the Western Allies, who continued to view all of Berlin as a jointly occupied territory belonging to neither of the two German states. This view was supported by the continued practice of patrols of all four sectors by soldiers of all four occupying powers. Thus, occasionally Western Allied soldiers were on patrol in East Berlin as were Soviet soldiers in West Berlin. After the Wall was built, East Germany wanted to control Western Allied patrols upon entering or leaving East Berlin, a practice that the Western Allies regarded as unacceptable. After protests to the Soviets, the patrols continued uncontrolled on both sides, with the tacit agreement that the western Allies would not use their patrolling privileges for helping Easterners to flee to the West.

In many ways, West Berlin functioned as the &quot;de facto&quot; 11th state of West Germany and was depicted on maps published in the West as being a part of West Germany. There was freedom of movement (to the extent allowed by geography) between West Berlin and West Germany. There were no separate immigration regulations for West Berlin, all immigration rules for West Germany being followed in West Berlin. West German entry visas issued to visitors were stamped with &quot;for the Federal Republic of Germany, including the State of Berlin&quot; (), prompting complaints from the Soviet Union. However, this wording remained on the visas throughout the rest of the entire period of West Berlin&#x27;s existence.

West Berlin remained under military occupation until 3 October 1990, the day of unification of East Germany, East and West Berlin with the Federal Republic of Germany. The West German Federal Government, as well as the governments of most western nations, considered East Berlin to be a &quot;separate entity&quot; from East Germany, and while the Western Allies later opened embassies in East Berlin, they recognised the city only as the &quot;seat of government&quot; of the GDR, not as its &quot;capital&quot;.

Communist countries, however, did not recognise West Berlin as part of West Germany and usually described it as a &quot;third&quot; German jurisdiction, called an &quot;independent political unit&quot; (). On maps of East Berlin, West Berlin often did not appear as an adjacent urban area but as a monochrome terra incognita, sometimes showing the letters WB, meaning &quot;Westberlin&quot; () or overlaid with a legend or pictures. It was often labelled &quot;Westberlin special political area&quot; ().

==Immigration==
The Federal Republic of Germany issued West German passports to West Berliners on request that showed West Berlin as their place of residence. However, West Berliners could not use their passports for crossing East German borders and were denied entrance by any country of the Eastern Bloc, since governments of these countries held the view that West Germany was not authorized to issue legal papers for West Berliners. 

Since West Berlin was not a sovereign state, it did not issue passports. Instead, West Berliners were issued with &quot;auxiliary identity cards&quot; by the West Berlin authorities. These differed visually from the regular West German identity cards, with green bindings instead of the grey standard, they did not show the &quot;Federal Eagle&quot; or coat of arms, and contained no indications as to the issuing State. However, they did have a statement that the holder of the document was a German citizen. From 11 June 1968, East Germany made it mandatory that West Berlin and West German &quot;transit passengers&quot; obtain a transit visa, issued upon entering East Germany, because under its second constitution East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners foreigners. Since identity cards had no pages to stamp visas, issuers of East German visas stamped their visas onto separate leaflets which were loosely stuck into the identity cards, which, until the mid-1980s, were little booklets. Although the West German government subsidized visa fees, they were still payable by individual travellers.

In order to enter visa-requiring Western countries, such as the US, West Berliners commonly used West German passports. However, for countries which did not require stamped visas for entry, including Switzerland, Austria, and many members of the then European Economic Community, including the United Kingdom, West Berlin identity cards were also acceptable for entry.

Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Berlin was home to at least 178,000 Turkish and Turkish German residents, making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.

West Berlin was also a destination for many people fleeing East Germany both before and after the construction of the Berlin Wall. As many immigrants from East Germany did not intend to stay in Berlin, flights ‚Äì the only option for those people to reach West Germany without coming into contact with East German authorities ‚Äì were subsidized by the West German government despite being operated only by companies registered in and owned by nationals of the western occupying powers.

==Naming conventions==
Most Westerners called the Western sectors &quot;Berlin&quot; unless further distinction was necessary. The West German Federal government officially called West Berlin , although it also used the hyphenated , whereas the East German government commonly referred to it as . Starting from 31 May 1961, East Berlin was officially called (&#x27;Berlin, Capital of the GDR&#x27;), replacing the formerly used term (&#x27;Democratic Berlin&#x27;), or simply , by East Germany, and by the West German Federal government. Other names used by West German media included , , or . These different naming conventions for the divided parts of Berlin, when followed by individuals, governments, or media, commonly indicated their political leanings, with the centre-right using and the centre-left using .

==Period following the building of the Berlin Wall==

After the Berlin Wall was constructed in 1961, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer suggested to U.S. President John F. Kennedy that the United States propose a swap of West Berlin with Thuringia and parts of Saxony and Mecklenburg; the city&#x27;s population would have been relocated to West Germany. Adenauer did not believe that the Soviets would accept the offer because East Germany would lose important industry, but hoped that making the proposal would reduce tensions between the western and eastern blocs, and perhaps hurt relations between the USSR and East Germany if they disagreed on accepting the offer. While the Kennedy administration seriously considered the idea, it did not make the proposal to the Soviet Union.

NATO also took an increased interest in the specific issue related to West Berlin, and drafted plans to ensure to defend the city against an eventual attack from the East. A tripartite planning group known as LIVE OAK, working together with NATO, was entrusted with potential military responses to any crisis.

On 26 June 1963, President Kennedy visited West Berlin. On his triumphant tour, cheered by hundred of thousands of West Berliners in the streets, he stopped at the Congress Hall, near the Brandenburg Gate, and at Checkpoint Charlie, before delivering at West Berlin&#x27;s city hall a speech, which became famous for its phrase &quot;&quot; and a hallmark of America&#x27;s solidarity with the city.

The Four Power Agreement on Berlin (September 1971) and the Transit Agreement (May 1972) helped to significantly ease tensions over the status of West Berlin. While many restrictions remained in place, it also made it easier for West Berliners to travel to East Germany and it simplified the regulations for Germans travelling along the autobahn transit routes.

At the Brandenburg Gate in 1987, U.S. President Ronald Reagan provided a challenge to the then Soviet leader:
General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!

On 9 November 1989, the Wall was opened, and the two parts of the city were once again physically‚Äîthough at this point not legally‚Äîunited. The Two Plus Four Treaty, signed by the two German states and the four wartime allies, paved the way for German reunification and an end to the Western Allies&#x27; occupation of West Berlin. On 3 October 1990‚Äîthe day Germany was officially reunified‚ÄîEast and West Berlin formally reunited as the city of Berlin, which then joined the enlarged Federal Republic as a city-state along the lines of the existing West German city-states of Bremen and Hamburg. Walter Momper, the mayor of West Berlin, became the first mayor of the reunified city in the interim. City-wide elections in December 1990 resulted in the first &quot;all Berlin&quot; mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West Berlin expiring by that time, and Eberhard Diepgen (a former mayor of West Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin.

==Boroughs==

West Berlin comprised the following boroughs ():

In the American sector:
*Neuk√∂lln
*Kreuzberg
*Sch√∂neberg
*Steglitz
*Tempelhof
*Zehlendorf

In the British sector:
*Charlottenburg
*Tiergarten
*Wilmersdorf
*Spandau

In the French sector:
*Reinickendorf
*Wedding

==Exclaves==

 West Berlin&#x27;s border was identical to the municipal boundary of Berlin as defined in the Greater Berlin Act of 1920 and amended in 1938, and the border between the Soviet sector and the French, British, and American sectors respectively, which followed the boundaries of Berlin administrative boroughs as defined in the same years. Another amendment was added in 1945 at the border between the British sector of Berlin (ceding West-Staaken) and the Soviet zone (ceding the Seeburg Salient) so that the Wehrmacht airfield at Berlin-Gatow became part of the British sector and the airfield at Berlin-Staaken became part of the Soviet sector. The resulting borderline was further complicated with a lot of geographical oddities, including a number of exclaves and enclaves that Greater Berlin had inside some neighbouring municipalities since 1920, all of which happened to become part of the British or American sectors after 1945, so that parts of West Berlin came to be surrounded by East Germany

Furthermore, the Gatow/Staaken exchange in August 1945 resulted in the geographically western half of Berlin-Staaken, which was located in the western outskirts of the city, becoming &quot;de jure&quot; Soviet occupied. However, the &quot;de facto&quot; administration remained with the Borough of Spandau in the British sector. Therefore, all inhabitants of Staaken could vote in West Berlin&#x27;s city state elections in 1948 and 1950. On 1 February 1951, East German Volkspolizei surprised the people of western Staaken by occupying the area and ended its administration by the Spandau Borough; instead, western Staaken became an exclave of the Soviet occupied borough Berlin-Mitte in the city centre. However, on 1 June 1952, western Staaken&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; administration was placed with neighbouring East German Falkensee in the East German district Nauen.

==Post and telecommunications==
West Berlin had its own postal administration first called (1947‚Äì1955) and then , separate from West Germany&#x27;s , and issuing its own postage stamps until 1990. However, the separation was merely symbolic; in reality, West Berlin&#x27;s postal service was completely integrated with West Germany&#x27;s, using the same postal code system.

West Berlin was also integrated into the West German telephone network, using the same international dialling code as West Germany, +49, with the area code 0311, later changed to 030. Unlike West Germany, from where calls to East Berlin were made using the prefix 00372 (international access code 00, East German country code 37, area code 2), calls from West Berlin required only the short code 0372. Conversely, those made to West Berlin from East Berlin only required the short code 849.

In order to reduce eastern wiretapping of telecommunications between West Berlin and West Germany, microwave radio relay connections were built, which transmitted telephone calls between antenna towers in West Germany and West Berlin by radio. Two such towers were built, one antenna in Berlin-Wannsee and later a second in Berlin-Frohnau, finished on 16 May 1980 with a height of . This tower was demolished on 8 February 2009.

==Transport and transit travel==
West Berliners could travel to West Germany and all Western and non-aligned states at all times, except during the Berlin Blockade by the Soviet Union (24 June 1948 to 12 May 1949) when there were restrictions on passenger flight capacity imposed by the airlift.

Travelling to and from West Berlin by road or train always required passing through East German border checks, since West Berlin was an enclave surrounded by East Germany and East Berlin. On 2 October 1967, six years after the Wall was constructed, tram tracks in West Berlin were removed because the authorities wanted to promote car usage, meaning that the tram system remaining today runs almost entirely within the former East Berlin.

===Road traffic===
As there were no dedicated walled-off-road corridors between West Germany and West Berlin under West German jurisdiction, travellers needed to pass through East Germany. A valid passport was required for citizens of West Germany and other western nationals to be produced at East German border checks. West Berliners could get admission only through their identity cards (see above). For travel from West Berlin to Denmark, Sweden and West Germany via dedicated East German transit routes (), East German border guards issued a &quot;transit visa&quot; for a fee of 5 Western Deutsche Mark. For journeys between West Berlin and Poland or Czechoslovakia through East Germany, each traveller was also required to present a valid visa for the destination country.

The transit routes for road travel connecting West Berlin to other destinations usually consisted of autobahns and other highways, marked by &quot;Transit&quot; signs. &quot;Transit travellers&quot; () were prohibited to leave the transit routes, and occasional traffic checkpoints would check for violators.

There were four transit routes between West Berlin and West Germany:
*One between West Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Heerstra√üe&quot; with the East German checkpoint in Dallgow until 1951, then replaced by Staaken for destinations in Northern Germany (originally via highway &quot;F 5&quot;) at the Eastern checkpoint in Horst (a part of today&#x27;s Nostorf) and the Western Lauenburg upon Elbe. These were replaced on 20 November 1982 by a new autobahn crossing at Zarrentin (E)/Gudow (W). On 1 January 1988, the new Stolpe checkpoint opened on this route to West Berlin. This is part of today&#x27;s Hohen Neuendorf (E)/Berlin-Heiligensee (W).
*A second transit route led to Northwestern and Western Germany ‚Äì following today&#x27;s A 2 ‚Äì crossing the inner German border at Marienborn (E)/Helmstedt (W), also called &quot;Checkpoint Alpha&quot;.
*A third route to Southwestern Germany consisted of today&#x27;s A 9 and A 4 with border crossing at Wartha (E)/Herleshausen (W).
*A fourth (via today&#x27;s A 9) to Southern Germany had border crossings originally at Mount Juchh√∂h (E)/T√∂pen (W) and later at Hirschberg upon Saale (E)/ Rudolphstein (a part of today&#x27;s Berg in Upper Franconia) (W).
The latter three routes used autobahns built during the Nazi era. They left West Berlin at &quot;Checkpoint Dreilinden&quot;, also called Checkpoint Bravo (W)/Potsdam-Drewitz (E). Transit routes to Poland were via today&#x27;s A 11 to Nadrensee-Pomellen (East Germany, GDR)/Ko≈Çbaskowo (Kolbitzow) (PL), eastwards via today&#x27;s A 12 to Frankfurt upon Oder (GDR)/S≈Çubice (PL), or southeastwards via today&#x27;s A 13 and A 15 to Forst in Lusatia/Bar≈°ƒá (GDR)/Zasieki (Berge) (PL). Additional routes led to Denmark and Sweden by ferry between Warnem√ºnde (GDR) and Gedser (DK) and by ferry between Sassnitz (GDR) and R√∏nne (DK) or Trelleborg (S). Routes to Czechoslovakia were via Schmilka (GDR)/H≈ôensko (Herrnskretschen) (ƒåSSR) and via F√ºrstenau (a part of today&#x27;s Geising) (GDR)/C√≠novec (Cinvald/B√∂hmisch Zinnwald) (ƒåSSR).

The transit routes were also used for East German domestic traffic. This meant that transit passengers could potentially meet with East Germans and East Berliners at restaurants at motorway rest stops. Since such meetings were deemed illegal by the East German government, border guards would calculate the travel duration from the time of entry and exit of the transit route. Excessive time spent for transit travel could arouse their suspicion and prompt questioning or additional checking by the border guards. Western coaches could stop only at dedicated service areas since the East German government was concerned that East Germans might potentially use coaches to escape into the West.

On 1 September 1951, East Germany, because of a shortage in foreign currencies, started to levy road tolls on cars using the transit routes. At first, the toll amounted to 10 Ostmark per passenger car and 10 to 50 for trucks, depending on size. Ostmarks had to be exchanged into Deutsche Mark at a rate of 1:1. On 30 March 1955, East Germany raised the toll for passenger cars to 30 Deutsche Marks, but after West German protests, in June of the same year, it changed it back to the previous rate.

===Railway===
Four transit train connections‚Äîearlier also called &quot;interzonal train&quot; ()‚Äîconnected West Berlin with Hamburg via Schwanheide (E)/B√ºchen (W) in the North, with Hanover via Marienborn (E)/Helmstedt (W) in the West, with Frankfurt am Main via Gerstungen (E)/H√∂nebach (W) in the Southwest, and with Nuremberg via Probstzella (E)/Ludwigsstadt (W) in the South of West Germany. These transit trains did not service domestic passengers of East Germany and made stops in East Germany almost exclusively for East German border guards upon entering and leaving the country. Until the construction of the Berlin Wall, &quot;interzonal trains&quot; would also stop once on their way within East Germany for travellers having a visa for entering or leaving East Germany. Train travel from West Berlin to Czechoslovakia, Denmark (by ferry), Poland and Sweden (by ferry) required a visa to enter East Berlin or East Germany to allow transfer to an international train‚Äîwhich also carried domestic passengers‚Äîbound for an international destination. One railway connection between West Berlin and Oebisfelde (E)/Wolfsburg (W) was reserved for freight trains only.

In July and August 1945, the three Western Allies and the Soviet Union decided that the railways, previously serviced by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (German Reich Railways), should continue to be operated by one railway administration to service all four sectors. West Berlin had ‚Äì with the exception of a few small private railway lines ‚Äì no separate railway administration. Furthermore, the operation of the Reichsbahn&#x27;s Berlin S-Bahn electric metropolitan transport network, consisting of commuter trains, was also maintained. After the founding of East Germany on 7 October 1949 it gained responsibility for the Reichsbahn in its territory. East Germany continued to run its railways under the official name Deutsche Reichsbahn, which thus maintained responsibility for almost all railway transport in all four sectors of Berlin. The GDR-controlled &#x27;Bahnpolizei&#x27;, the Reichsbahn&#x27;s railway police, were authorised to patrol station premises and other railway property in the whole city including West Berlin. The legal necessity of keeping the term &#x27;Deutsche Reichsbahn&#x27; explains the surprising use of the word &#x27;Reich&#x27; (with its Imperial and Nazi connotations) in the name of an official organisation of the communist GDR.

After the Berlin Blockade &quot;transit trains&quot; () would leave and enter West Berlin only via one line through Berlin-Wannsee railway station (W) and Potsdam Griebnitzsee railway station (E). All transit trains would start or end in East Berlin, passing through West Berlin with only one stop in the Western Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station, which became West Berlin&#x27;s main railway station. Until 1952, the Reichsbahn also permitted stops at other stations on the way through the Western sectors.

Many Reichsbahn employees working in West Berlin were West Berliners. Their East German employer, whose proceeds from ticket sales for Western Deutsche Marks contributed to East Germany&#x27;s foreign revenues, tried to hold down wage social security contributions in Western Deutsche Mark. Therefore, West Berlin employees of the Reichsbahn were paid partly in Eastern German currency. They could spend this money in East Germany and take their purchases to West Berlin, which other Westerners could not do to the same extent. West Berlin employees were trained in East Germany and employed under East German labour laws. West Berliners employed by the Reichsbahn were not included in the Western health insurance system either. The Reichsbahn ran its own hospital for them in West Berlin, the building of which is now used as the headquarters of Bombardier Transportation. For certain patients, the Reichsbahn would facilitate treatment in a hospital in East Berlin. In medical emergencies, the employees could use West Berlin doctors and hospitals, which would then be paid for by the Reichsbahn.

The GDR used the western stations to distribute propaganda and display posters with slogans like &quot;Americans Go Home.&quot; On 1 May, May Day, a state holiday in East and West, S-Bahn trains were sometimes decorated with the East German banner and a red flag.

===Waterways===
Two waterways via the rivers and canals Havel and Mittellandkanal were open for inland navigation, but only freight vessels were allowed to cross from West Berlin into East German waters. The Havel crossed at the East German border in Nedlitz (a part of Potsdam-Bornstedt), continuing through the Elbe-Havel Canal and then either taking the Elbe northwestwards crossing the border again at Cumlosen (E)/Schnackenburg (W) or westwards following the Mittellandkanal to Buchhorst (Oebisfelde) (E)/R√ºhen (W). Western freight vessels could stop only at dedicated service areas, because the East German government wanted to prevent any East Germans from boarding them.

In July and August 1945, the Western Allies and the Soviet Union decided that the operation and maintenance of the waterways and locks, which were previously run by the national German directorate for inland navigation (), should be continued and reconstructed in all four sectors. Except for the originally city-owned Neuk√∂lln Ship Canal and some canals built later (e.g. Westhafen Canal) and locks, West Berlin had no separate inland navigation authority, but the East Berlin-based authority operated most waterways and locks, their lockmasters employed by the East. Because of their negligent maintenance, the western Allies later transferred their control to the Senate of Berlin (West).

The western entrance to the Teltowkanal, connecting several industrial areas of West Berlin for heavy freight transport, was blocked by East Germany in Potsdam-Klein Glienicke. Therefore, vessels going to the Teltowkanal had to take a detour via the river Spree through West and East Berlin&#x27;s city centre to enter the canal from the East. On 20 November 1981, East Germany reopened the western entrance, which required two more vessel border checkpoints ‚Äì Dreilinden and Kleinmachnow ‚Äì because the waterway crossed the border between East Germany and West Berlin four times.

===Air traffic===
Air traffic was the only connection between West Berlin and the Western world that was not directly under East German control. On 4 July 1948, British European Airways opened the first regular service for civilians between West Berlin and Hamburg. Tickets were originally sold for pounds sterling only. West Berliners and West Germans who had earlier fled East Germany or East Berlin, and thus could face imprisonment on entering East Germany or East Berlin, could only take flights for travel to and from West Berlin. To enable individuals threatened by East German imprisonment to fly to and from West Berlin the West German government subsidised the flights.

Flights between West Germany and West Berlin were under Allied control by the quadripartite Berlin Air Safety Centre. According to permanent agreements, three air corridors to West Germany were provided, which were open only for British, French, or U.S. military planes or civilian planes registered with companies in those countries.

The airspace controlled by the &quot;Berlin Air Safety Center&quot; comprised a radius of around the seat of the center in the Kammergericht building in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg ‚Äì thus covering most of East and West Berlin and the three corridors, of the same width ‚Äì one northwestwards to Hamburg (Fuhlsb√ºttel Airport), one westwards to Hanover, and one southwestwards to Frankfurt upon Main (Rhein-Main Air Base).

The West German airline Lufthansa and most other international airlines were not permitted to fly to West Berlin. Flights by Lufthansa or the East German airline Interflug servicing connections between East and West Germany (such as between D√ºsseldorf and Hamburg in West Germany and the East German city of Leipzig) began in August 1989, but these routes had to go through Czechoslovak or Danish airspace.

===Traffic between West Berlin and East Germany===
Until 1953, travelling from West Berlin into East Germany (German Democratic Republic (GDR)) fell under Interzonal traffic regulations overseen by the three Allied military governments (the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SVAG), the Control Commission for Germany ‚Äì British Element, and the Office of Military Government/United States (OMGUS)). On 27 May 1952, East Germany closed its border with West Germany and its -long border with West Berlin. From then on West Berliners required a permit to enter East Germany. East German border checkpoints were established in East German suburbs of West Berlin, and most streets were gradually closed for interzonal travel into East Germany. The last checkpoint to remain open was located at the Glienicker Br√ºcke near Potsdam, until it was also closed by East Germany on 3 July 1953. The checkpoint at Staaken&#x27;s Heerstra√üe remained open only for transit traffic to West Germany.
This caused hardship for many West Berlin residents, especially those who had friends and family in East Germany. However, East Germans could still enter West Berlin. A number of cemeteries located in East Germany were also affected by the closure. Many church congregations in Berlin owned cemeteries outside the city, so many West Berlin congregations had cemeteries that were located in East Germany. For example, the &quot;Friedhof vor Charlottenburg&quot; (in &quot;Cemetery in front/outside of Charlottenburg&quot;) was located in the East German suburb of Dallgow, yet belonged to Catholic congregations in Berlin-Charlottenburg. Many West Berliners wishing to visit the grave of a relative or friend on cemeteries located in East Germany were now unable to do so. Until 1961, East Germany occasionally issued permits to West Berliners to visit the cemeteries on the Catholic feast of &quot;All Saints&quot; on 1 November and on the Protestant Day of Repentance and Prayer.

In 1948‚Äì1952, the Reichsbahn connected the western suburbs of West Berlin to its S-Bahn network. Train routes servicing these suburbs formerly went through West Berlin stations, but ceased to make stops in the western stations or terminated service before entering West Berlin. Private West Berlin railway lines like the Neuk√∂lln‚ÄìMittenwalde railway (Neuk√∂lln-Mittenwalder Eisenbahn, NME), connecting the East German Mittenwalde with West Berlin-Neuk√∂lln and the &quot;B√∂tzowbahn&quot; between West Berlin-Spandau and East German Hennigsdorf, were disrupted at the border between West Berlin and East Germany on 26 October 1948 and August 1950, respectively.

Tramways and bus routes that connected West Berlin with its East German suburbs and were operated by West Berlin&#x27;s public transport operator Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe Gesellschaft (&quot;BVG&quot; West) ceased operation on 14 October 1950, after West Berlin tram and bus drivers had been repeatedly stopped and arrested by East German police for having western currency on them, considered a crime in the East. The BVG (West) terminated route sections that extended into East Germany, like the southern end of tram line 47 to Sch√∂nefeld, the southwestern end of tram line 96 to Kleinmachnow, as well as two bus lines to Glienicke at the Nordbahn, north, and to Falkensee, northwest of West Berlin. The East German section of tram line 96 continued operating with eastern personnel and cars, obliging the eastern passengers ‚Äì rarely westerners who needed special permits to enter East Germany ‚Äì to change from eastern into western trains crossing the border by foot, until it was closed by the Wall.

The Reichsbahn shut down all of its West Berlin terminal stations and redirected its trains to stations in East Berlin, starting with Berlin G√∂rlitzer Bahnhof ‚Äì closed on 29 April 1951 ‚Äì before serving rail traffic with G√∂rlitz and the southeast of East Germany. On 28 August 1951, trains usually serving Berlin Lehrter Bahnhof were redirected to stations in East Berlin, while trains from West Germany were redirected to the Western &quot;Berlin Zoologischer Garten&quot;. The Reichsbahn also closed down both Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof and Berlin Nordbahnhof, on 18 May 1952.

On 28 August 1951, the Reichsbahn opened a new connection ‚Äì from Spandau via Berlin Jungfernheide station ‚Äì for the S-Bahn lines connecting East German suburbs to the west of West Berlin (namely Falkensee, Staaken) with East Berlin, thus circumventing the centre of West Berlin. In June 1953, the Reichsbahn further cut off West Berlin from its East German suburbs by the introduction of additional &quot;express S-Bahn trains&quot; (). These routes originated from several East German suburbs bordering West Berlin (such as Falkensee, Potsdam, Oranienburg, Staaken, and Velten), crossing West Berlin non-stop until reaching its destinations in East Berlin. However, the regular S-Bahn connections with West Berlin&#x27;s East German suburbs, stopping at every Western station, continued. From 17 June to 9 July 1953, East Germany blocked off all traffic between East and West due to the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany.

From 4 October 1953, all S-Bahn trains crossing the border between East Germany and Berlin had to pass a border checkpoint in East Germany. Travellers from East Germany were checked before entering any part of Berlin, to identify individuals intending to escape into West Berlin or smuggling rationed or rare goods into West Berlin. S-Bahn trains were checked at Hoppegarten, Mahlow, and Zepernick in East Germany bordering East Berlin and in Hohen Neuendorf, Potsdam-Griebnitzsee, and Staaken-Albrechtshof in East Germany bordering West Berlin. On 4 June 1954, the &quot;Bahnhof Hennigsdorf S√ºd&quot; station located next to West Berlin was opened solely for border controls, also to monitor West Berliners entering or leaving East Berlin, which they could still do freely, while they were not allowed to cross into East Germany proper without a special permit.

In 1951, the Reichsbahn began construction work on the Berlin outer-circle railway line. This circular line connected all train routes heading for West Berlin and accommodated all domestic GDR traffic, thus directing railway traffic into East Berlin while by-passing West Berlin. Commuters in the East German suburbs around West Berlin now boarded &quot;Sputnik&quot; express trains, which took them into East Berlin without crossing any western sectors. With the completion of the outer-circle railway, there was no further need for express S-Bahn trains crossing the West Berlin border and thus their service ended on 4 May 1958, while stopping S-Bahn trains continued service. However, while East Germans could get off in West Berlin, West Berliners needed the hard-to get permits to enter East Germany by S-Bahn. With the construction of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, all remaining railway traffic between West Berlin and its East German suburbs ended. Rail traffic between East and West Berlin was sharply reduced and restricted to a small number of checkpoints under GDR control. East Berliners and East Germans were then unable to freely enter and leave West Berlin. However, international visitors could obtain visas for East Berlin upon crossing one of the checkpoints at the Wall.

Following the policy of d√©tente of the &quot;Federal Government&quot; under Chancellor Willy Brandt, West Berliners could again apply for visas to visit East Germany, which were granted more freely than in the period until 1961. On 4 June 1972, West Berlin&#x27;s public transport operator &quot;BVG&quot; could open its first bus line into the East German suburbs since 1950 (line E to Potsdam via &quot;Checkpoint Bravo&quot; as it was known to the US military). This route was open only to persons bearing all the necessary East German permits and visas. For visits to East Germany, West Berliners could use four checkpoints along the East German border around West Berlin: The two road transit checkpoints Dreilinden (W)/Drewitz (E) and Berlin-Heiligensee (W)/Stolpe (E) as well as the old transit checkpoint at Heerstra√üe (W)/Staaken (E) and the checkpoint at Waltersdorfer Chaussee (W)/Sch√∂nefeld (E), which was also open for travellers boarding international flights at Sch√∂nefeld Airport.

===Traffic between East and West Berlin===
While East and West Berlin became formally separate jurisdictions in September 1948, and while there were travel restrictions in all other directions for more than a decade, freedom of movement existed between the western sectors and the eastern sector of the city. However, time and again Soviet and later East German authorities imposed temporary restrictions for certain persons, certain routes, and certain means of transport. Gradually the eastern authorities disconnected and separated the two parts of the city.

While the Soviets blocked all transport to West Berlin (Berlin Blockade between 24 June 1948 to 12 May 1949), they increased food supplies in East Berlin in order to gain the compliance of West Berliners who at that time still had free access to East Berlin. West Berliners buying food in East Berlin were regarded as approving of the Soviet attempt to get rid of the Western Allies in West Berlin. This was seen as support by the communists and as treason by most Westerners. Until that time all over Germany food and other necessary supplies had been available only with ration stamps issued by one&#x27;s municipality. This was the case in East Berlin until the Communist putsch in Berlin&#x27;s city government in September 1948 ‚Äì the unitary City Council of Greater Berlin () for East and West.

By July 1948 a mere 19,000 West Berliners out of a total of almost 2¬†million covered their food requirements in East Berlin. Thus, 99% of West Berliners preferred to live on shorter supplies than before the Blockade, to show support for the Western Allies&#x27; position. In West Germany rationing of most products ended with the introduction of the Western Deutsche Mark on 21 June 1948. The new currency was also introduced in West Berlin on 24 June and this, at least officially, was the justification for the Soviet Blockade due to which rationing in West Berlin had to continue. However, in the course of the Berlin Air Lift some supplies were increased beyond the pre-Blockade level and therefore rationing of certain goods in West Berlin was stopped.

While West Berliners were officially welcome to buy food in East Berlin, the Soviets tried to prevent them from buying other essential supplies, particularly coal and other fuel. For this reason, on 9 November 1948, they opened checkpoints on 70 streets entering West Berlin and closed the others for horse carriages, lorries and cars, later (16 March 1949) the Soviets erected roadblocks on the closed streets. From 15 November 1948, West Berlin ration stamps were no longer accepted in East Berlin. All the same, the Soviets started a campaign with the slogan &quot;The smart West Berliner buys at the HO&quot; (), the HO being the Soviet zone chain of shops. They also opened so-called &quot;Free Shops&quot; in the Eastern Sector, offering supplies without ration stamps, but denominated at extremely high prices in Eastern Deutsche Marks. Ordinary East and West Berliners could only afford to buy there if they had income in Western Deutsche Mark and bartered the needed Eastern Deutsche Mark on the spontaneous currency markets, which developed in the British sector at the Zoo station. Their demand and supply determined a barter ratio in favour of the Western Deutsche Mark with more than 2 Eastern Deutsche Marks offered for one Western Deutsche Mark. After the Blockade, when holders of Western Deutsche Marks could buy as much they could afford, up to five and six east marks were offered for one west mark. In the East, however, the Soviets had arbitrarily decreed a rate of 1 for 1 and exchanging at other rates was criminalised.

On 12 May 1949, the Blockade ended and all roadblocks and checkpoints between East and West Berlin were removed. The Berlin Airlift, however, continued until 30 September 1949 in order to build up supplies in West Berlin (the so-called Senate Reserve), in readiness for another possible blockade, thus ensuring that an airlift could then be restarted with ease. On 2 May 1949, power stations in East Berlin started again to supply West Berlin with sufficient electricity. Before then, electrical supply had been reduced to just a few hours a day after the normal supplies had been interrupted at the start of the Blockade. However, the Western Allies and the West Berlin City Council decided to be self-sufficient in terms of electricity generation capacity, to be independent of Eastern supplies and not to be held to ransom by the eastern authorities. On 1 December 1949 the new &quot;power station West&quot; (, in 1953 renamed after the former Governing Mayor of West Berlin into ) went online and West Berlin&#x27;s electricity board declared independence from Eastern supplies. However, for a time Eastern electricity continued to be supplied albeit intermittently. Supply was interrupted from 1 July until the end of 1950 and then started again until 4 March 1952, when the East finally switched it off. From then on West Berlin turned into an &#x27;electricity island&#x27; within a pan-European electricity grid that had developed from the 1920s, because electricity transfers between East and West Germany never fully ceased.

In 1952, West Berliners were restricted entry to East Germany proper by means of a hard-to-obtain East German permit. Free entry to East Berlin remained possible until 1961 and the building of the Wall. Berlin&#x27;s underground () and Berlin&#x27;s S-Bahn (a metropolitan public transit network), rebuilt after the war, continued to span all occupation sectors. Many people lived in one half of the city and had family, friends, and jobs in the other. However, the East continuously reduced the means of public transport between East and West, with private cars being a very rare privilege in the East and still a luxury in the West.

Starting on 15 January 1953 the tram network was interrupted. East Berlin&#x27;s public transport operator (&quot;BVG&quot;-East, &quot;BVB&quot; as of 1 January 1969) staffed all trams, whose lines crossed the sectorial border, with women drivers, who were not permitted as drivers by the &quot;BVG&quot; (West), West Berlin&#x27;s public transport operator. Instead of changing the Western rules, so that the Easterly intended interruption of the cross-border tram traffic would not happen, the &quot;BVG&quot; (West) insisted on male drivers. Cross-border tram traffic ended on 16 January. In East German propaganda this was a point for the East, arguing that the West did not allow drivers coming with their trams from the East to continue along their line into the West, but remaining silent on the fact that the end of cross-border tram traffic was most welcome to the East. The underground and the S-Bahn networks, except the above-mentioned &quot;traverse S-Bahn trains&quot;, continued to provide services between East and West Berlin. However, occasionally the East Berlin police ‚Äì in the streets and on cross-border trains in East Berlin ‚Äì identified suspicious behaviour (such as carrying heavy loads westwards) and watched out for unwelcome Westerners.

Occasionally, West Germans were banned from entering East Berlin. This was the case between 29 August and 1 September 1960, when ex-prisoners of war and deportees, &quot;homecomers&quot; (), from all around West Germany and West Berlin met for a convention in that city. The &quot;homecomers&quot; released mostly from a long detention in the Soviet Union were unwelcome in East Berlin. As they could not be recognised through their identification papers, all West Germans were banned from East Berlin during those days. West Berliners were allowed, since the quadripartite Allied status quo provided for their free movement around all four sectors. From 8 September 1960 on, the East subjected all West Germans to apply for a permit before entering East Berlin.

As the communist government in the East gained tighter control, and the economic recovery in the West significantly outperformed the East, more than a hundred thousand East Germans and East Berliners left East Germany and East Berlin for the West every year. East Germany closed the borders between East and West Germany and sealed off the border with West Berlin in 1952; but because of the quadripartite Allied status of the city, the -long sectorial border between East and West Berlin remained open.

To stop this drain of people defecting, the East German government built the Berlin Wall, thus physically closing off West Berlin from East Berlin and East Germany, on 13 August 1961. All Eastern streets, bridges, paths, windows, doors, gates, and sewers opening to West Berlin were systematically sealed off by walls, concrete barriers, barbed wire, and/or bars. The Wall was directed against the Easterners, who by its construction were no longer allowed to leave the East, except with an Eastern permit, not usually granted.
Westerners were still granted visas on entering East Berlin. Initially eight street checkpoints were opened, and one checkpoint in the Berlin Friedrichstra√üe railway station, which was reached by one line of the Western underground (today&#x27;s U 6), two Western S-Bahn lines, one under and one above ground (approximately today&#x27;s S 2 and S 3, however, lines changed significantly from 1990 onwards), and &quot;transit trains&quot; between West Germany and West Berlin started and ended there.

The eight street checkpoints were ‚Äì from North to South along the Wall ‚Äì on Bornholmer Stra√üe, Chausseestra√üe, Invalidenstra√üe, Berlin Friedrichstra√üe station, Friedrichstra√üe (Checkpoint Charlie in US military denomination, since this crossing was to their sector), Heinrich-Heine-Stra√üe, Oberbaumbr√ºcke, and Sonnenallee.
When the construction of the Wall started after midnight early on 13 August, West Berlin&#x27;s Governing Mayor Willy Brandt was on a West German federal election campaigning tour in West Germany. Arriving by train in Hanover at he was informed about the Wall and flew to West Berlin&#x27;s Tempelhof Central Airport.

Over the course of the day he protested along with many other West Berliners on Potsdamer Platz and at the Brandenburg Gate. On 14 August, under the pretext that Western demonstrations necessitated it, the East closed the checkpoint at the Brandenburg Gate &#x27;until further notice&#x27;, a situation that was to last until 22 December 1989, when it was finally reopened.

On 26 August 1961, East Germany generally banned West Berliners from entering the Eastern sector. West Germans and other nationals, however, could still get visas on entering East Berlin. Since intra-city phone lines had been cut by the East already in May 1952 (see below) the only remaining way of communication with family or friends on the other side was by mail or at meeting in a motorway restaurant on a &quot;transit route&quot;, because the &quot;transit traffic&quot; remained unaffected throughout.

On 18 May 1962 East Germany opened the so-called Tr√§nenpalast checkpoint hall (&quot;Palace of Tears&quot;) at Berlin Friedrichstra√üe station, where Easterners had to say a sometimes tearful farewell to returning Westerners as well as the few Easterners who had managed to get a permit to visit the West. Until June 1963 the East deepened its border zone around West Berlin in East Germany and East Berlin by clearing existing buildings and vegetation to create an open field of view, sealed off by the Berlin Wall towards the West and a second wall or fence of similar characteristics to the East, observed by armed men in towers, with orders to shoot at escapees.
Finally, in 1963, West Berliners were again allowed to visit East Berlin. On this occasion a further checkpoint for pedestrians only was opened on the Oberbaumbr√ºcke. West Berliners were granted visas for a one-day visit between 17 December 1963 and 5 January the following year. 1.2¬†million out of a total 1.9¬†million West Berliners visited East Berlin during this period. In 1964, 1965, and 1966 East Berlin was opened again to West Berliners, but each time only for a limited period.

East Germany assigned different legal statuses to East Germans, East Berliners, West Germans, and West Berliners, as well as citizens from other countries in the world. Until 1990 East Germany designated each Border crossings in East Berlin for certain categories of persons, with only one street checkpoint being open simultaneously for West Berliners and West Germans (Bornholmer Stra√üe) and &quot;Berlin Friedrichstra√üe railway station&quot; being open for all travellers.

On 9 September 1964, the East German Council of Ministers (government) decided to allow Eastern pensioners to visit family in West Germany or West Berlin. According to the specified regulations valid from 2 November on Eastern pensioners could apply and were usually allowed, to travel into the West to visit relatives once a year for a maximum of four weeks. If pensioners decided not to return, the government did not miss them as manpower, unlike younger Easterners, who were subject to a system of labour and employment, which demanded that almost everybody work in the Eastern command production system.

On 2 December 1964 East Germany, always short of hard currency, decreed that every Western visitor had to buy a minimum of 5 Eastern &quot;Mark der Deutschen Notenbank&quot; per day (MDN, 1964‚Äì1968 the official name of the East German mark, to distinguish it from the West Deutsche Mark) at the still held arbitrary compulsory rate of 1:1. The 5 marks had to be spent, as exporting Eastern currency was illegal, which is why importing it after having bargained for it at the currency market at Zoo station was also illegal. Western pensioners and children were spared from the compulsory exchange (officially in , i.e. &quot;minimum exchange&quot;). Not long after East Germany held the first cash harvest from the new compulsory exchange rules by allowing West Berliners to visit East Berlin once more for a day during the Christmas season. The following year, 1965, East Germany opened the travelling season for West Berliners on 18 December. In 1966 it opened for a second harvest of Western money between the Easter (10 April) and Pentecost (29 May) holidays and later again at Christmas.

The situation only changed fundamentally after 11 December 1971 when, representing the two German states, Egon Bahr from the West and Michael Kohl from the East signed the Transit Agreement. This was followed by a similar agreement for West Berliners, once more allowing regular visits to East Germany and East Berlin.

After ratification of the Agreement and specifying the relevant regulations, West Berliners could apply for the first time again for visas for any chosen date to East Berlin or East Germany from 3 October 1972 onwards. If granted, a one-day-visa entitled West Berliners to travel to the East until 2¬†am the following day. The visitors were now spared the visa fee of 5 Western Deutsche Marks, not to be confused with the compulsory exchange amounting to the same sum, but yielding in return 5 Eastern marks. This financial relief did not last long, because on 15 November 1973 East Germany doubled the compulsory exchange to 10 Eastern marks, payable in West German Deutsche Marks at par.
One-day visas for East Berlin were now issued in a quickened procedure; visas for longer stays and visas for East Germany proper needed a prior application, which could be a lengthy procedure. To facilitate applications for West Berliners seeking such Eastern visas, the GDR Foreign Ministry was later allowed to open &quot;Offices for the Affairs of Visits and Travelling&quot; () in West Berlin, which were not allowed to show any official symbols of East Germany. The Eastern officials working commuted every morning and evening between East and West Berlin. Their uniforms showed no official symbols except the name . They accepted visa applications and handed out confirmed visas issued in the East to the West Berlin applicants. A shed formerly housing one such can be found on Waterlooufer 5‚Äì7 in Berlin-Kreuzberg, close to Hallesches Tor underground station.

Another form of traffic between East and West Berlin was the transfer of West Berlin&#x27;s sewage into East Berlin and East Germany through the sewer pipes built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The sewage flowed into the East because most of the pre-war sewage treatment facilities, mostly sewage farms, happened to be in the East after the division of the city. Sewer pipes, however, once discovered as a way to flee the East, were blocked by bars. West Berlin paid for the treatment of its sewage in Western Deutsche Marks which were desperately needed by the East German government. Since the methods used in the East did not meet Western standards, West Berlin increased the capacity of modern sewage treatment within its own territory, such that the amount of its sewage treated in the East had been considerably reduced by the time the Wall came down.

The situation with refuse was similar. The removal, burning or disposal of the ever-growing amount of West Berlin&#x27;s rubbish became a costly problem, but here too an agreement was found since West Berlin would pay in Western Deutsche Marks. On 11 December 1974 East Germany and West Berlin&#x27;s garbage utility company &quot;BSR&quot; signed a contract to dispose of refuse on a dump right beside the Wall in East German Gro√ü-Ziethen (today a part of Sch√∂nefeld). An extra checkpoint, solely open for Western bin lorries (garbage trucks), was opened there. Later on, a second dump, further away, was opened in Vorketzin, a part of Ketzin.

As for the S-Bahn, operated throughout Berlin by the East German Reichsbahn, the construction of the Wall meant a serious disruption of its integrated network, especially of the Berlin&#x27;s circular S-Bahn line around all of the Western and Eastern inner city. The lines were separated and those mostly located in West Berlin were continued, but only accessible from West Berlin with all access in East Berlin closed. However, even before the Wall had been built, West Berliners increasingly refrained from using the S-Bahn, since boycotts against it were issued, the argument being that every S-Bahn ticket bought provided the GDR government with valuable Western Deutsche Marks.
Usage dropped further as the Western public transport operator &quot;BVG&quot; (West) offered parallel bus lines and expanded its network of underground lines. After the construction of the Wall, ridership fell so much that running the S-Bahn lines in West Berlin turned into a loss-making exercise: wages and maintenance ‚Äì however badly it was carried out ‚Äì cost more than income from ticket sales. Finally, the Reichsbahn agreed to surrender operation of the S-Bahn in West Berlin, as had been determined by all Allies in 1945, and on 29 December 1983 the Allies, the Senate of Berlin (West; i.e. the city state government) and the Reichsbahn signed an agreement to change the operator from Reichsbahn to &quot;BVG&quot; (West) which took effect on 9 January 1984.

On 9 November 1989 East Germany opened the borders for East Germans and East Berliners, who could then freely enter West Berlin. West Berlin itself had never restricted their entry. For West Berliners and West Germans the opening of the border for free entry lasted longer. The regulation concerning one-day-visas on entering the East and the compulsory minimum exchange of 25 Western Deutsche Marks by 1989, continued. However, more checkpoints were opened. Finally, on 22 December 1989, East Germany granted West Berliners and West Germans free entry without charge at the existing checkpoints, demanding only valid papers. Eastern controls were slowly eased into spot checks and finally abolished on 30 June 1990, the day East and West introduced the &quot;union concerning currency, economy and social security&quot; ().

===Traffic between different parts of West Berlin crossing the East===
When the Wall was built in 1961, three metro lines starting in northern parts of West Berlin passed through tunnels under the Eastern city centre and ended again in southern parts of West Berlin. The lines concerned were today&#x27;s underground lines U 6 and U 8 and the S-Bahn line S 2 (today partly also used by other lines). On the sealing off of West Berlin from East Berlin by the Berlin Wall the entrances of the stations on these lines located in East Berlin were shut. However, western trains were allowed to continue to pass through without stopping. Passengers of these trains experienced the empty and barely lit ghost stations where time had stood still since 13 August 1961. West Berlin&#x27;s public transport operator &quot;BVG&quot; (West) paid the east an annual charge in Western Deutsche Marks for its underground lines to use the tunnels under East Berlin. U 6 and S 2 also had one subterranean stop at the Eastern Berlin Friedrichstra√üe railway station, the only station beneath East Berlin where western U Bahn trains were still allowed to stop. Passengers could change there between U 6, S 2 and the elevated S 3 (then starting and ending in Friedrichstra√üe) or for the transit trains to West Germany, buy duty-free tobacco and liquor for Western marks in GDR-run Intershop kiosks, or enter East Berlin through a checkpoint right in the station.
