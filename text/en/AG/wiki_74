<text>USS &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; (CV-63), formerly CVA-63, was a United States Navy supercarrier. She was the second naval ship named after Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the site of the Wright brothers&#x27; first powered airplane flight. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was the first of the three s to be commissioned and the last to be decommissioned.

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, on 27 December 1956. The ship was launched on 21 May 1960, sponsored by Mrs. Camilla F. McElroy, wife of Defense Secretary Neil H. McElroy. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was launched by flooding her drydock; the conventional slide-down method was ruled out because of her mass and the risk that she might hit the Philadelphia shore on the far side of the Delaware River.

The ship was commissioned 29 April 1961, at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Captain William F. Bringle in command.

With the decommissioning of on 30 September 1998, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; became the United States warship with the second-longest active status, after the sailing ship ( passed her in 2012; these two aircraft carriers were two of the three carriers to fly the First Navy Jack).

For ten years, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was the forward-deployed carrier at Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka, Japan. In October 2008, she was replaced in this role by . &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; returned to the United States and had her decommissioning ceremony on 31 January 2009. She was officially decommissioned on 12 May 2009 after 48 years of service. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was replaced by . She was stricken from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; on 20 October 2017, and was designated for disposal by dismantling a few days later. On 15 January 2022 &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; left Puget Sound Naval Shipyard under tow en route to Brownsville, Texas, for scrapping, arriving there on 31 May 2022.

==Service history==

===1961 to 1964===
Following shakedown in the Western Atlantic, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; departed Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia on 11 August 1961. After a brief stop at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she embarked the Secretary of the Brazilian Navy for a demonstration during an exercise at sea with five Brazilian destroyers, the attack carrier rounded Cape Horn on 1 October. She steamed into Valparaíso, Chile, on 13 October and then sailed two days later for Peru, arriving in Callao on 20 October where she entertained the President of Peru. At San Diego, Admiral George W. Anderson, Chief of Naval Operations, landed on her deck 18 November to witness antisubmarine demonstrations by and , a Terrier missile demonstration by and air demonstrations by &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;.

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; entered San Francisco Naval Shipyard on 23 November 1961 for alterations. Following operations out of San Diego, she sailed from San Francisco on 13 September 1962. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; joined the United States Seventh Fleet on 7 October 1962, relieving as the flagship.

After participating in the Philippine Republic Aviation Week Air Show, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; steamed out of Manila Harbor on 30 November 1962 and welcomed Admiral Harry D. Felt, Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, for a demonstration of modern naval weapons on 3 December. The ship visited Hong Kong early in December and returned to Japan, arriving at Yokosuka on 2 January 1963.

In conjunction with Commander, Carrier Division Seven, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; carried out several exercises in January and February 1963. On 4 January 1963, Operation Checkertail saw &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and three other attack aircraft carriers launch practice airstrikes against the Okinawa Air Defense Command. From 27 January – 2 February 1963, &#x27;Picture Window III&#x27; saw &#x27;foreign aircraft&#x27; intercepted and visually identified in the Northern Japan area. Though the official ship&#x27;s papers released in 2011 do not identify the nationality, the &#x27;foreign aircraft&#x27; in question were likely from the Soviet Far Eastern Military District or Soviet Naval Aviation. From 16–19 February 1963, Exercise &#x27;Red Wheel&#x27; was conducted around Southern Japan also under the direction of Commander, Carrier Division Seven. It aimed to improve the United States Seventh Fleet&#x27;s ability to conduct conventional and nuclear warfare while maintaining defense against air and submarine attack. It also aimed to evaluate the capability of &#x27;the HUK [Hunter-Killer] Group&#x27; to protect two CVA Task Groups. During these exercises, the ship visited Kobe, Beppu, and Iwakuni before returning to San Diego on 2 April 1963.
On 6 June 1963, President John F. Kennedy, with top civilian and military leaders, boarded &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; to witness a carrier task force weapons demonstration off the California coast. Addressing the men of the task group from &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;, President Kennedy told them that, as in the past, control of the seas still means security, peace, and ultimate victory. He later wrote to president and Madame Chiang Kai-shek who had witnessed a similar demonstration onboard : &quot;I hope you were impressed as I was, on my visit to &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;, with the great force for peace or war, which these mighty carriers and their accompanying escorts provide, helping to preserve the freedom of distant nations in all parts of the world.&quot;

An F-4B Phantom II, aircraft no.401, while assigned to VF-114, made the ship&#x27;s 16,000th trap on 17 August 1963.

Film director John Frankenheimer filmed shots for the movie &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; on board the vessel in 1963.

Following a series of strike exercises and tactics reaching along the California coast and off Hawaii, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; again sailed for the Far East. While approaching Japan, she learned an assassin had shot President Kennedy. Flags were at half-mast as she entered Sasebo Harbor on 25 November 1963, the day of the President&#x27;s funeral, and, as senior ship present, she had the sad honor of firing memorial salutes. After cruising the South China Sea and ranging to the Philippines in readiness operations with the 7th Fleet, she returned to San Diego on 20 July 1964.

===1965 to 1972===

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was overhauled in Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, then trained along the western seaboard. She sailed from San Diego on 19 October 1965, for Hawaii thence to Subic Bay, Philippines, where she prepared for combat operations off the coast of Vietnam.

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; returned to San Diego in June 1966 for overhaul and training until 4 November 1966, when she again deployed to serve in waters of Southeast Asia. Scenes from the 1966 Walt Disney comedy &quot;Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.&quot; were filmed aboard the warship.

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; arrived at Yokosuka, Japan on 19 November to relieve &quot;Constellation&quot; as flagship for Rear Admiral David C. Richardson, Commander Task Force 77. On 26 November, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; departed Yokosuka for Yankee Station via Subic Bay. On 5 December, aircraft from &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; began their around-the-clock missions over North Vietnam. About this time &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; — already accustomed to celebrities as guests – entertained several prominent visitors: William Randolph Hearst Jr.; Bob Considine; Dr. Billy Graham; Nancy Sinatra and John Steinbeck, among others. She remained in the Far East, supporting the U.S. in Southeast Asia until departing Subic Bay on 28 May 1968. Steaming via Japan, the carrier reached San Diego on 19 June and a week later entered the naval shipyard at Long Beach for maintenance. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; returned to San Diego on 25 August and began a rigorous training program to prepare her for future action.

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for exceptionally meritorious and heroic service from 23 December 1967 to 1 June 1968, which included the Tet Offensive, while participating in combat operations in Southeast Asia, and the Navy Unit Meritorious Commendation for exceptionally meritorious service from 15 January 1969 to 27 August 1969 while participating in combat operations in Southeast Asia and contingency operations in Northeast Asia. Both awards noted that the officers and men of the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; displayed undaunted spirit, courage, professionalism, and dedication to maintain their ship as a fighting unit under the most arduous operating conditions to enable her pilots to destroy vital military targets in North Vietnam despite intense opposition and extremely adverse weather conditions.

While on deployment from November 1967 to June 1968, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; experienced a fire in while in port at Subic Bay and went to general quarters for 51 hours. On 16 January 1968 year, a C-1A Trader swerved off the wet deck. Four personnel aboard were lost along with the aircraft and could not be recovered. After a deployment from November 1968 to June 1969, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; returned to San Diego for a month and then went to Puget Sound shipyard in September 1969 for dry dock.

On 12 October 1972 during the Vietnam War, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was en route to her station in the Gulf of Tonkin when a race riot involving more than 200 sailors broke out. Nearly 50 sailors were injured in this widely publicized incident. This incident spread racial violence to other US Navy ships, such as the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Constellation&quot; and the replenishment ship USS &quot;Hassayampa&quot;. Tensions among the crews resulted in a Congressional inquiry into discipline in the Navy.

===1973 to 1977===
From January through July 1973, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; changed home ports from San Diego to San Francisco. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; moved into dry dock on 14 January 1973. Work began to convert the ship from an attack (CVA) to a multi-mission carrier (CV). The &quot;CV&quot; designation indicated that &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was no longer strictly an attack carrier, in that anti-submarine warfare would also become a major role. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; became the first Pacific Fleet carrier to carry the multi-purpose &quot;CV&quot; designation. The conversion consisted of adding ten new helicopter calibrating stations, installing sonar/sonobuoy readout and analysis center and associated equipment, and changing a large portion of the ship&#x27;s operating procedures. One of the significant equipment/space changes in the conversion was the addition of the Anti-Submarine Classification and Analysis Center (ASCAC) in the CIC area. ASCAC worked in close conjunction with the anti-submarine warfare aircraft assigned aboard Carrier Air Wing 11. The Engineering Department underwent a significant change in its propulsion plant during the yard period. The Navy Standard Oil (black oil) fuel system was completely converted to Navy Distillate Fuel. The Air Department added several significant changes to the flight deck, including enlarging the jet blast deflectors (JBD) and installing more powerful catapults to handle the new Grumman F-14 Tomcat, which &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was due to receive for its next deployment. Enlarging JBD#1 meant the No. 1 Aircraft Elevator had to be redesigned, making &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; the only carrier at the time having an aircraft elevator that tracked from the hangar deck to the flight deck angling out 6°. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; moved out of dry dock on 28 April 1973, and the next day, on her 12th birthday, she was named a Multi-Purpose Aircraft Carrier (CV).
After much-needed upgrades and modifications to &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;″s systems, she departed Hunters Point navy shipyards in San Francisco to begin &quot;sea trial&quot; exercises and then made a short three-day layover in Pearl Harbor for some crew R&amp;R. She then departed for the South China Sea. However, while en route, during routine maintenance to the ship&#x27;s fuel oil systems in the No. 1 machinery room on 11 December 1973, a flange gasket failed in one of the fuel transfer tubes of JP5 jet fuel that pass through Number 1 engine room. Jet fuel was sprayed, atomized, and ignited, and the ship went to General Quarters for nearly 38 hours. Due to the massive amounts of thick black smoke, the crew was ordered topside to the flight deck until the fire could be controlled and the smoke cleared. Because two and then three of the ship&#x27;s four propulsion systems had to be shut down during the fire, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; began to list about 7 degrees portside. As a result, many of the aircraft were moved starboard to balance the ship until the fire was finally brought under control and two propulsion systems restored. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; then headed toward the Philippines, where she ported in Subic Bay until the ship&#x27;s damage could be assessed, and repairs could be made, but there would be three days of waiting before reaching port. Six enlisted sailors died in the fire: FR Michael Deverich, FR Linn Schambers, FR Kevin Johnson, FA Alan Champine, Samuel Cardenas, and FA Joseph Tulipana. Thirty-four sailors were treated for smoke inhalation and several minor injuries, and one sailor for a broken wrist reported. The bodies of those men who died in the fire were escorted home by members of their respective Divisions for burial.

As a result of the deaths of the six crew members, on 10 January 1974, an investigation was ordered by Rear Admiral Donald C. Davis, Commander of Carrier Group 1 and Senior Officer onboard &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; designated as his flagship. Although initial reports lay blame to one of the six men who perished in the tragic fire, upon conclusion of the investigation filed by the Department of the Navy, Commander Seventh Fleet, several opinions on causes were noted within the investigation, which included but were not limited to the Fourth Endorsement on Captain Kenneth L. Shugart, USN. The investigative report of 10 January 1974, section 3, paragraph 3 stated, &quot;The replacement of the defective gasket in the strainer cover assembly by Fireman Apprentice Kevin W. Johnson (deceased) reflected, in the words of the investigating officer, poor judgment and unsound maintenance practices.&quot; Further, &quot;Fireman Apprentice Johnson was therefore negligent in the performance of his duties.&quot; However, in consonance with the investigating officer, the opinion is expressed that under the circumstances, the maintenance deficiencies noted herein constitute simple, rather than culpable, negligence.&quot;

In light of the efforts made by all six navy personnel, FA Cardenas, Champine and Tulipana, and FR Deverich, Schambers and Johnson assigned to the machinery room on 11 December 1973, who all died during the suppression efforts, &quot;It has administratively been determined each were posthumously awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for their heroic devotion to duty in fighting the fire which is the subject of this investigative report.&quot;

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; stayed busy throughout the mid-1970s with numerous deployments to the Western Pacific and involvement in a large number of exercises, including RIMPAC in 1973 and 1975. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; departed San Diego on 8 March 1976, and on 12 March entered dry dock at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, to commence a US$100 million complex overhaul, scheduled to last just more than 12 months. This overhaul configured &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; to operate with the F-14 and S-3A &quot;Viking&quot; aircraft in a total CV sea control mode. This included adding spaces for storage, ordnance handling, and maintenance facilities for the two aircraft. Also included in the work package were more efficient work areas for airframes and a repair facility for ground support equipment, and the addition of avionics support capability for the S-3. The ship also replaced the Terrier Surface-to-Air missile system with the NATO Sea Sparrow system and added elevators and modified weapons magazines to provide an increased capability for handling and stowing the newer, larger air-launched weapons. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; completed the overhaul in March 1977 and departed the shipyard on 1 April of that year to return to San Diego. After a six-month pre-deployment workup, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; departed NAS North Island 25 October 1977 for another Western Pacific Ocean deployment and returned 15 May 1978.

===1979 to 1998===
In May 1979, the ship teamed up with Carrier Air Wing 15 (CVW-15) for another Western Pacific deployment. Her duties included search and assistance operations to aid refugees in small boats fleeing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

During that deployment, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; also offered contingency support off the coast of Korea following the assassination of Republic of Korea President Park Chung Hee. The deployment was then extended months to support contingency operations in the North Arabian Sea during the Iran hostage crisis. For their actions in the region, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and CVW-15 were awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal.

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; had a cameo appearance in the 1980 movie &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;, standing in for . On her way home from her Western Pacific deployment, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was filmed entering Pearl Harbor with the crew manning the rails as the ship passed the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial. (At the time of the filming, &quot;Nimitz&quot; was still an Atlantic Fleet, vice Pacific Fleet, aircraft carrier.) &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; returned to San Diego in late February 1980 and was also awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation and the Naval Air Force Pacific Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; Award as the best carrier in the Pacific Fleet.

In April 1981, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; left San Diego for her thirteenth deployment to the Western Pacific. Following the cruise, the crew was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal and the Humanitarian Service Medal for the rescue of Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea.

In January 1982, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; returned to Bremerton for another year-long overhaul. Following the comprehensive upgrade and a vigorous training period with Carrier Air Wing 2, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; deployed in 1984 as the flagship for Battle Group Bravo. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; logged more than on this deployment and remained at &quot;Station Gonzo&quot; in the north Arabian Sea for more than 60 consecutive days.

In March 1984, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; participated in &quot;Team Spirit&quot; exercises in the Sea of Japan. The Soviet Victor-class nuclear attack submarine &quot;K-314&quot; shadowed the task group. On 21 March 1984, at the end of the Sea of Japan part of the exercise, &quot;K-314&quot; surfaced directly in front of &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;, time was 22:05, too dark and far too close for &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; to see and avoid the resulting collision, with minor damage to the aircraft carrier, and significant damage to the Soviet submarine. At the time of the accident, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; is estimated to have carried several dozen nuclear weapons, and &quot;K-314&quot; probably carried two nuclear torpedoes. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was thereafter considered the first antisubmarine carrier weapon and a red submarine was painted on her island near the bridge but was ordered removed upon return to home port North Island San Diego, CA.

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; went to the U.S. Naval Base at Subic Bay in the Philippines for repairs. A piece of one of &quot;K-314&quot;″s propellers was embedded in &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;″s bow, as were some chunks of the Soviet anechoic coating, from scraping along the side of the submarine. The result was an &quot;accidental&quot; intelligence coup for the U.S. Navy.

The ship returned to San Diego on 1 August 1984. Seven months later, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was awarded another Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; Award.

In July 1985, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and CVW-9 deployed again as flagship for Battle Group Bravo. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and CVW-9 combined to set a standard for operations, completing their second consecutive fatality-free deployment.

In August 1985, People Magazine printed an article stating that Kitty Hawk&#x27;s missiles and jet parts were illegally smuggled into Iran, at that time considered a hostile nation, as revealed by Kitty Hawk&#x27;s Petty Officer Robert W Jackson. Later, the FBI arrested seven suspects involved in this smuggling scheme, an event related to what was later known as the Iran-Contra scandal.

CVW-9 crews logged more than 18,000 flight hours and 7,300 arrested landings. At the same time &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; maintained her catapults and arresting gear at 100 percent availability.

In 1986, during pre-cruise exercises, one Airman was killed during flight operations when he was struck by an aircraft while checking &quot;elongs&quot; during a launch.

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; bid farewell to San Diego on 3 January 1987, as the ship departed her home port of 25 years and set out on a six-month world cruise. During the circumnavigation, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and CVW-9 again showed their commitment to safety by conducting a third fatality-free deployment. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; spent 106 consecutive days on station in the Indian Ocean and was again awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal and the Meritorious Unit Commendation for its service. The world cruise ended at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 3 July. Six months later, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; began a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) overhaul. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; emerged from the yards on 2 August 1990. The overhaul was estimated to have added 20 years of service to the ship. The Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department was also awarded the Air Forces, US Pacific Fleet Departmental Excellence Award, the Black &quot;E&quot; for this deployment.

With the return of CVW-15 to its decks, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; began its second deployment around &quot;the Horn&quot; of South America to her original home port of San Diego on 11 December 1991, performing Gringo-Gaucho with the Argentine Naval Aviation and paying a visit to Mar del Plata during the transit.

On 1 August 1992, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was appointed as Naval Air Force Pacific&#x27;s &quot;ready carrier&quot;. The ship embarked Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 5; Commander, Destroyer Squadron 17 and CVW-15 for three months of work-ups before deploying to the Western Pacific on 3 November 1992. While on deployment, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; spent nine days off the coast of Somalia supporting U.S. Marines and coalition forces involved in Operation Restore Hope. In response to increasing Iraqi violations of United Nations sanctions, the ship rushed to the Persian Gulf on 27 December 1992. Just 17 days later, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; led a joint coalition offensive strike against designated targets in southern Iraq.

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; set sail on her 17th deployment 24 June 1994, to provide a stabilizing influence operating in the Western Pacific during a time of great tension in the Far East, particularly concerning North Korea. This would be the last cruise for VA-52 flying the A-6E SWIP Intruder. During the cruise, the Carrier led the first ASW persecution of both the Han Class and Oscar II Class Submarine(Most likely the Oscar II was K-442). During the ASW hunt of the Han Class Submarine of the PLA Navy, a standoff ensued between the United States and PRC leading to several PLAAF fighter aircraft flying near Kitty Hawk&#x27;s S-3 Viking ASW aircraft from VS-37. Eventually, both sides backed down.

In 1995, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; embarked airwing transitioned to CVW-11, marking a change to a single F-14 squadron, and 3 F/A-18 squadrons.

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; began her 18th deployment, this time with CVW-11, in October 1996. During the six-month underway period, the ship visited ports in the Persian Gulf and Western Pacific. The carrier made a rare visit to Hobart, Tasmania as well as being only the second carrier to ever stop in Manama, Bahrain. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; returned to San Diego 11 April 1997, immediately beginning a 15-month, $110 million overhaul, including three months in dry dock in Bremerton, from January to March 1998.

===1998 to 2008===

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; departed San Diego on 6 July 1998, to assume new duties as America&#x27;s only permanently forward-deployed aircraft carrier from . &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; also welcomed aboard Carrier Air Wing 5, operating from Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; arrived at her new operating location of U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Japan, on 11 August 1998.

With the decommissioning of &quot;Independence&quot; on 30 September 1998, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; became the second-oldest active warship in the US Navy and was authorized to fly the First Navy Jack.

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; set sail for a planned three-month underway period on 2 March 1999, which included Exercise Tandem Thrust off Guam. Following the exercise, the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;/CVW-5 team was ordered to the Persian Gulf to enforce the No-Fly Zone over Southern Iraq. CVW-5 pilots flew more than 8,800 sorties in 116 days, including 1,300 combat sorties, dropping more than 20 tons of ordnance. On the return trip to Japan, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; made port visits to Perth, Western Australia, and Pattaya, Thailand. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; returned to Yokosuka on 25 August 1999. She was again underway to the Sea of Japan on 22 October to participate in Exercises Foal Eagle and AnnualEx 11G.

On 11 April 2000, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; departed Yokosuka, Japan, for routine local area operations and participated in Exercise Cobra Gold with the navies of Singapore and Thailand. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; participated in Exercise Foal Eagle in Fall 2000 and deployed again in March 2001 for a Spring underway period with a historic stop. On 22 March, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; became the first aircraft carrier to ever moor pier-side in Singapore, as the ship visited the brand new Changi Pier, located at the Republic of Singapore Navy&#x27;s Changi Naval Base. On 29 April, shortly after a visit to Guam, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; celebrated 40 years of active service as the ship and crew sailed south to participate in Exercise Tandem Thrust 2001 with the Australian and Canadian navies. The ship returned to Yokosuka on 11 June 2001.

On 17 October 2000, and again on 9 November 2000, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was buzzed by a group of Russian warplanes in the Sea of Japan, which proceeded to take pictures of the reaction on deck. General Anatoly Kornukov, then Russian air force&#x27;s commander in chief, stated that the Russian warplanes managed to evade &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;″s antiaircraft defense system and that &quot;In the pictures, you can clearly see the panic on deck.&quot;

In October 2001, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; deployed to the North Arabian Sea for the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom. The ship served as an afloat forward staging base for the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, with a reduced air wing.

In April 2002, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was underway for her scheduled spring training. Along with a Guam port call, the spring underway included port visits to Singapore and Hong Kong, where the crew celebrated &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;″s 41st birthday. In the fall of 2002, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was training in the Western Pacific. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and her battle group combined with U.S. Air Force units and elements of the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force to conduct AnnualEx 14G in the waters surrounding Japan. Later, the ship and her crew made a port visit to Hong Kong.

On 11 September 2002, all US Navy ships were ordered to fly the First Navy Jack. The ship once again departed Yokosuka on 23 January 2003 for a routine training mission, but a short time later, orders were received to transit to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility to support the Global War on Terrorism and to prepare for future contingencies. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was soon involved in Operations Southern Watch and Iraqi Freedom in the North Persian Gulf. Although the cruise was originally intended to be short, the ship served 110 continuous days at sea. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; returned to Yokosuka on 6 May 2003, immediately entering an extensive drydock period, or drydocking ship&#x27;s restricted availability (DSRA), that lasted until October of that year.

In 2005 &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; participated in the inaugural edititon of Exercise Talisman Saber. In October 2006, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and her escort warships were undergoing exercises near Okinawa, and a Chinese &quot;Song&quot;-class submarine shadowed the group then surfaced within of the group on 26 October 2006. It was considered to be quite rare for Chinese subs to operate that far from their home ports on the mainland, though with this incident that may be changing. Reports claim that the submarine had been undetected until it surfaced. In 2009, Timothy J. Keating, commander of the United States Pacific Command, commented on the issue, stating that the carrier was &quot;in a very relaxed posture. If there were some heightened state of tension, we would, believe me, we would not let them get that close.&quot;

On 11 January 2007, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; entered a scheduled period of maintenance in Yokosuka, her place being taken by which made an unscheduled deployment three weeks later. This refit is &quot;smaller than the one the ship completed [in 2006]&quot;, which took six months.

On 5 July 2007, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; arrived at Sydney, Australia, for six days of shore leave after participating in Exercise Talisman Sabre.

On 21 September 2007, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; pulled into Yokosuka, Japan, after a four-month summer deployment.

In November 2007, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and other US Navy ships participated in the joint military exercise Malabar, in the Bay of Bengal. Other nations that took part were Australia, Japan, Singapore and host nation India. Later that month, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was scheduled to dock at Hong Kong for Thanksgiving. However, China denied entry to &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and the rest of her carrier group. China then reversed its position based on humanitarian grounds but by that time, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was too far away to dock in time for the holiday. The cause of the Chinese refusal remains unclear.

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was deployed off the coast of China along with two other ships during the Taiwan election on 20 March 2008. After the elections, she entered Hong Kong for the last time.

On 28 May 2008, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; departed Japan for the last time, to be replaced in Japan by &quot;George Washington&quot;. However, during &quot;George Washington&quot;″s transit of the Pacific Coast of South America en route to the planned turnover with &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; in Hawaii, a major fire broke out that led to &quot;Washington&quot; diverting to San Diego for repairs. This led to the US Navy retaining &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; in Hawaii to take part in the RIMPAC 2008 exercises in June and July. On 7 August 2008, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; arrived at NAS North Island.

===Retirement===
On 1 December 2005, the United States Navy announced that &quot;George Washington&quot; would replace &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; in 2008 as the forward-deployed carrier in Japan and it would also assume host carrier duties for forward-deployed Carrier Air Wing 5.

In March 2007, the Navy announced that Captain Todd Zecchin, the captain responsible during the decommissioning of , had been tasked with overseeing the decommissioning of &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;.

&quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; left Yokosuka on 28 May 2008 to begin the decommissioning process. However, on 22 May, a fire seriously damaged &quot;George Washington&quot;, causing the ship to go to San Diego for repairs. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; participated in the RIMPAC exercise near Hawaii in &quot;George Washington&quot;″s place. The turnover between the two carriers was postponed and took place in August. After the turnover, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; arrived at Bremerton, Washington in September and was informally retired on 31 January 2009. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;, the USN&#x27;s last diesel-fueled aircraft carrier, was finally decommissioned on 12 May 2009.

==Post decommissioning==
As the last conventional American aircraft carriers to be decommissioned, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and were the last two carriers suitable for conversion into museum ships. Nuclear carriers, such as and the , require extensive disassembly to remove their nuclear reactors during decommissioning, leaving them in an unsuitable condition for donation.

After &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was decommissioned, groups based in Wilmington, North Carolina and Pensacola, Florida lobbied to acquire the ship after her release from the Navy Inactive Ships Program.

By March 2017, the USS &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; Veterans Association had raised $5 million in pledges to preserve the aircraft carrier as a museum ship. Members sought to donate $15,000 in memorabilia for display if it came to fruition.

After President Donald Trump gave a speech on board and promised to build a 12-carrier navy, US Navy officials extended &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;″s stay in the reserve inactive fleet and considered the possibility of recommissioning her to help with the buildup.

On 20 October 2017, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, and on 25 October 2017, the Navy announced its intentions to dispose of her by scrapping.

On 9 March 2021, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; arrived at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to be put in dry dock and have the hull scraped of marine life before being towed to her final destination.

On 6 October 2021, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; were sold for one cent each to International Shipbreaking Limited.

On 15 January 2022, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; left the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, under tow, en-route to Brownsville, Texas, for scrapping. As she is too big to transit the Panama Canal, she went instead by way of the Straits of Magellan.

On 31 May 2022, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; arrived in Brownsville, Texas, for scrapping. Scrapping was mostly complete by early 2024, as shown by aerial footage posted online.

It was also announced that the Air Zoo in Kalamazoo, Michigan was donated the 60,000 pound anchor from the USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) and several pieces of the carrier deck for outside display. This will go on display in June 2024 with help of the USS Kitty Hawk Veterans Association.

<text>UTF-8 is a character encoding standard used for electronic communication. Defined by the Unicode Standard, the name is derived from &quot;Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit&quot;. Almost every webpage is stored in UTF-8.

UTF-8 supports all 1,112,064 valid code points using a variable-width encoding of one to four one-byte (8-bit) code units.

Code points with lower numerical values, which tend to occur more frequently, are encoded using fewer bytes. It was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII: the first 128 characters of Unicode, which correspond one-to-one with ASCII, are encoded using a single byte with the same binary value as ASCII, so that a UTF-8-encoded file using only those characters is identical to an ASCII file. Most software designed for any extended ASCII can read and write UTF-8 (including on Microsoft Windows) and this results in fewer internationalization issues than any alternative text encoding.

UTF-8 is dominant for all countries/languages on the internet, with 99% global average use, is used in most standards, often the only allowed encoding, and is supported by all modern operating systems and programming languages.

== History ==
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) set out to compose a universal multi-byte character set in 1989. The draft ISO 10646 standard contained a non-required annex called UTF-1 that provided a byte stream encoding of its 32-bit code points. This encoding was not satisfactory on performance grounds, among other problems, and the biggest problem was probably that it did not have a clear separation between ASCII and non-ASCII: new UTF-1 tools would be backward compatible with ASCII-encoded text, but UTF-1-encoded text could confuse existing code expecting ASCII (or extended ASCII), because it could contain continuation bytes in the range – that meant something else in ASCII, e.g., for codice_1, the Unix path directory separator.

In July 1992, the X/Open committee XoJIG was looking for a better encoding. Dave Prosser of Unix System Laboratories submitted a proposal for one that had faster implementation characteristics and introduced the improvement that 7-bit ASCII characters would &quot;only&quot; represent themselves; multi-byte sequences would only include bytes with the high bit set. The name &quot;File System Safe UCS Transformation Format&quot; (&quot;FSS-UTF&quot;) and most of the text of this proposal were later preserved in the final specification. In August 1992, this proposal was circulated by an IBM X/Open representative to interested parties. A modification by Ken Thompson of the Plan 9 operating system group at Bell Labs made it self-synchronizing, letting a reader start anywhere and immediately detect character boundaries, at the cost of being somewhat less bit-efficient than the previous proposal. It also abandoned the use of biases that prevented overlong encodings. Thompson&#x27;s design was outlined on September 2, 1992, on a placemat in a New Jersey diner with Rob Pike. In the following days, Pike and Thompson implemented it and updated Plan 9 to use it throughout, and then communicated their success back to X/Open, which accepted it as the specification for FSS-UTF.

UTF-8 was first officially presented at the USENIX conference in San Diego, from January 25 to 29, 1993. The Internet Engineering Task Force adopted UTF-8 in its Policy on Character Sets and Languages in RFC 2277 (BCP 18) for future internet standards work in January 1998, replacing Single Byte Character Sets such as Latin-1 in older RFCs.

In November 2003, UTF-8 was restricted by to match the constraints of the UTF-16 character encoding: explicitly prohibiting code points corresponding to the high and low surrogate characters removed more than 3% of the three-byte sequences, and ending at removed more than 48% of the four-byte sequences and all five- and six-byte sequences.

== Description ==

UTF-8 encodes code points in one to four bytes, depending on the value of the code point. In the following table, the characters to are replaced by the bits of the code point, from the positions :

The first 128 code points (ASCII) need 1 byte. The next 1,920 code points need two bytes to encode, which covers the remainder of almost all Latin-script alphabets, and also IPA extensions, Greek, Cyrillic, Coptic, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Thaana and N&#x27;Ko alphabets, as well as Combining Diacritical Marks. Three bytes are needed for the remaining 61,440 codepoints of the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), including most Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters. Four bytes are needed for the 1,048,576 non-BMP code points, which include emoji, less common CJK characters, and other useful characters.

UTF-8 is a &quot;prefix code&quot; and it is unnecessary to read past the last byte of a code point to decode it. Unlike many earlier multi-byte text encodings such as Shift-JIS, it is &quot;self-synchronizing&quot; so searches for short strings or characters are possible and that the start of a code point can be found from a random position by backing up at most 3 bytes. The values chosen for the lead bytes means sorting a list of UTF-8 strings puts them in the same order as sorting UTF-32 strings.

=== Overlong encodings ===
Using a row in the above table to encode a code point less than &quot;First code point&quot; (thus using more bytes than necessary) is termed an &quot;overlong encoding&quot;. These are a security problem because they allow the same code point to be encoded in multiple ways. Overlong encodings (of for example) have been used to bypass security validations in high-profile products including Microsoft&#x27;s IIS web server and Apache&#x27;s Tomcat servlet container. Overlong encodings should therefore be considered an error and never decoded. Modified UTF-8 allows an overlong encoding of .

=== Byte map ===

The chart below gives the detailed meaning of each byte in a stream encoded in UTF-8.
=== Error handling ===

Not all sequences of bytes are valid UTF-8. A UTF-8 decoder should be prepared for:

* Bytes that never appear in UTF-8: , , 
* A &quot;continuation byte&quot; () at the start of a character
* A non-continuation byte (or the string ending) before the end of a character
* An overlong encoding ( followed by less than , or followed by less than )
* A 4-byte sequence that decodes to a value greater than ( followed by or greater)

Many of the first UTF-8 decoders would decode these, ignoring incorrect bits. Carefully crafted invalid UTF-8 could make them either skip or create ASCII characters such as , slash, or quotes, leading to security vulnerabilities. It is also common to throw an exception or truncate the string at an error but this turns what would otherwise be harmless errors (i.e. &quot;file not found&quot;) into a denial of service, for instance early versions of Python 3.0 would exit immediately if the command line or environment variables contained invalid UTF-8.

 states &quot;Implementations of the decoding algorithm MUST protect against decoding invalid sequences.&quot; &quot;The Unicode Standard&quot; requires decoders to: &quot;... treat any ill-formed code unit sequence as an error condition. This guarantees that it will neither interpret nor emit an ill-formed code unit sequence.&quot; The standard now recommends replacing each error with the replacement character &quot;�&quot; () and continue decoding.

Some decoders consider the sequence (a truncated 3-byte code followed by a space) as a single error. This is not a good idea as a search for a space character would find the one hidden in the error. Since Unicode 6 (October 2010) the standard (chapter 3) has recommended a &quot;best practice&quot; where the error is either one continuation byte, or ends at the first byte that is disallowed, so is a two-byte error followed by a space. This means an error is no more than three bytes long and never contains the start of a valid character, and there are  different possible errors. Technically this makes UTF-8 no longer a prefix code (you have to read one byte past some errors to figure out they are an error), but searching still works if the searched-for string does not contain any errors.

Making each byte be an error, in which case is &quot;two&quot; errors followed by a space, also still allows searching for a valid string. This means there are only 128 different errors which makes it practical to store the errors in the output string, or replace them with characters from a legacy encoding.

Only a small subset of possible byte strings are error-free UTF-8: several bytes cannot appear; a byte with the high bit set cannot be alone; and in a truly random string a byte with a high bit set has only a chance of starting a valid UTF-8 character. This has the (possibly unintended) consequence of making it easy to detect if a legacy text encoding is accidentally used instead of UTF-8, making conversion of a system to UTF-8 easier and avoiding the need to require a Byte Order Mark or any other metadata.

=== Surrogates ===

Since RFC 3629 (November 2003), the high and low surrogates used by UTF-16 ( through ) are not legal Unicode values, and their UTF-8 encodings must be treated as an invalid byte sequence. These encodings all start with followed by or higher. This rule is often ignored as surrogates are allowed in Windows filenames and this means there must be a way to store them in a string. UTF-8 that allows these surrogate halves has been (informally) called &quot;&quot;, while another variation that also encodes all non-BMP characters as two surrogates (6 bytes instead of 4) is called &quot;CESU-8&quot;.

=== Byte-order mark ===

If the Unicode byte-order mark is at the start of a UTF-8 file, the first three bytes will be , , .

The Unicode Standard neither requires nor recommends the use of the BOM for UTF-8, but warns that it may be encountered at the start of a file trans-coded from another encoding. While ASCII text encoded using UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII, this is not true when Unicode Standard recommendations are ignored and a BOM is added. A BOM can confuse software that isn&#x27;t prepared for it but can otherwise accept UTF-8, e.g. programming languages that permit non-ASCII bytes in string literals but not at the start of the file. Nevertheless, there was and still is software that always inserts a BOM when writing UTF-8, and refuses to correctly interpret UTF-8 unless the first character is a BOM (or the file only contains ASCII).

== Comparison to UTF-16 ==

For a long time there was considerable argument as to whether it was better to process text in UTF-16 or in UTF-8.

The primary advantage of UTF-16 is that the Windows API required it to be used to get access to all Unicode characters (only recently has this been fixed). This caused several libraries such as Qt to also use UTF-16 strings which propagates this requirement to non-Windows platforms.

In the early days of Unicode there were no characters greater than and combining characters were rarely used, so the 16-bit encoding was effectively fixed-size. Some believed fixed-size encoding could make processing more efficient, but any such advantages were lost as soon as UTF-16 became variable width as well.

The code points take 3 bytes in UTF-8 but only 2 in UTF-16. This led to the idea that text in Chinese and other languages would take more space in UTF-8. However, text is only larger if there are more of these code points than 1-byte ASCII code points, and this rarely happens in the real-world documents due to spaces, newlines, digits, punctuation, English words, and (depending on document format) markup.

UTF-8 has the advantages of being trivial to retrofit to any system that could handle an extended ASCII, not having byte-order problems, and taking about half the space for any language using mostly Latin letters.

== Implementations and adoption ==

UTF-8 has been the most common encoding for the World Wide Web since 2008. , UTF-8 is used by 98.5% of surveyed web sites. Although many pages only use ASCII characters to display content, very few websites now declare their encoding to only be ASCII instead of UTF-8. Virtually all countries and languages have 95% or more use of UTF-8 encodings on the web. 

Many standards only support UTF-8, e.g. JSON exchange requires it (without a byte-order mark (BOM)). UTF-8 is also the recommendation from the WHATWG for HTML and DOM specifications, and stating &quot;UTF-8 encoding is the most appropriate encoding for interchange of Unicode&quot; and the Internet Mail Consortium recommends that all e‑mail programs be able to display and create mail using UTF-8. The World Wide Web Consortium recommends UTF-8 as the default encoding in XML and HTML (and not just using UTF-8, also declaring it in metadata), &quot;even when all characters are in the ASCII range ... Using non-UTF-8 encodings can have unexpected results&quot;.

Lots of software has the ability to read/write UTF-8. It may though require the user to change options from the normal settings, or may require a BOM (byte-order mark) as the first character to read the file. Examples of software supporting UTF-8 include Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel (2016 and later), Google Drive, LibreOffice and most databases.

Software that &quot;defaults&quot; to UTF-8 (meaning it writes it without the user changing settings, and it reads it without a BOM) has become more common since 2010. Windows Notepad, in all currently supported versions of Windows, defaults to writing UTF-8 without a BOM (a change from &quot;Notepad&quot;), bringing it into line with most other text editors. Some system files on Windows 11 require UTF-8 with no requirement for a BOM, and almost all files on macOS and Linux are required to be UTF-8 without a BOM. Programming languages that default to UTF-8 for I/O include Ruby 3.0, R 4.2.2, Raku and Java 18. Although the current version of Python requires an option to codice_2 to read/write UTF-8, plans exist to make UTF-8 I/O the default in Python 3.15. C++23 adopts UTF-8 as the only portable source code file format.

Backwards compatibility is a serious impediment to changing code and APIs using UTF-16 to use UTF-8, but this is happening. , Microsoft added the capability for an application to set UTF-8 as the &quot;code page&quot; for the Windows API, removing the need to use UTF-16; and more recently has recommended programmers use UTF-8, and even states &quot;UTF-16 [...] is a unique burden that Windows places on code that targets multiple platforms&quot;.
The default string primitive in Go,
Julia, Rust, Swift (since version 5), and PyPy uses UTF-8 internally in all cases. Python (since version 3.3) uses UTF-8 internally for Python C API extensions and sometimes for strings and a future version of Python is planned to store strings as UTF-8 by default. Modern versions of Microsoft Visual Studio use UTF-8 internally. Microsoft&#x27;s SQL Server 2019 added support for UTF-8, and using it results in a 35% speed increase, and &quot;nearly 50% reduction in storage requirements.&quot;
Java internally uses &quot;Modified UTF-8&quot; (MUTF-8), in which the null character uses the two-byte overlong encoding , , instead of just . Modified UTF-8 strings never contain any actual null bytes but can contain all Unicode code points including , which allows such strings (with a null byte appended) to be processed by traditional null-terminated string functions. Java reads and writes normal UTF-8 to files and streams, but it uses Modified UTF-8 for object serialization, for the Java Native Interface, and for embedding constant strings in class files. The dex format defined by Dalvik also uses the same modified UTF-8 to represent string values. Tcl also uses the same modified UTF-8 as Java for internal representation of Unicode data, but uses strict CESU-8 for external data. All known Modified UTF-8 implementations also treat the surrogate pairs as in CESU-8.

Raku programming language (formerly Perl 6) uses codice_3 encoding by default for I/O (Perl 5 also supports it); though that choice in Raku also implies &quot;normalization into Unicode NFC (normalization form canonical). In some cases you may want to ensure no normalization is done; for this you can use codice_4&quot;. That &quot;UTF-8 Clean-8&quot; variant, implemented by Raku, is an encoder/decoder that preserves bytes as is (even illegal UTF-8 sequences) and allows for Normal Form Grapheme synthetics.

Version 3 of the Python programming language treats each byte of an invalid UTF-8 bytestream as an error (see also changes with new UTF-8 mode in Python 3.7); this gives 128 different possible errors. Extensions have been created to allow any byte sequence that is assumed to be UTF-8 to be losslessly transformed to UTF-16 or UTF-32, by translating the 128 possible error bytes to 128 reserved code points, and transforming those code points back to error bytes to output UTF-8. The most common approach is to translate the codes to ... which are low (trailing) surrogate values and thus &quot;invalid&quot; UTF-16, as used by Python&#x27;s PEP 383 (or &quot;surrogateescape&quot;) approach. Another encoding called MirBSD OPTU-8/16 converts them to ... in a Private Use Area. In either approach, the byte value is encoded in the low eight bits of the output code point. These encodings are needed if invalid UTF-8 is to survive translation to and then back from the UTF-16 used internally by Python, and as Unix filenames can contain invalid UTF-8 it is necessary for this to work.

== Standards ==

The official name for the encoding is , the spelling used in all Unicode Consortium documents. The hyphen-minus is required and no spaces are allowed. Some other names used are:

* Most standards are also case-insensitive and codice_3 is often used.
* Web standards (which include CSS, HTML, XML, and HTTP headers) also allow and many other aliases.
* The official Internet Assigned Numbers Authority lists as the only alias, which is rarely used.
* In some locales means UTF-8 &quot;without&quot; a byte-order mark (BOM), and in this case &quot;may&quot; imply there &quot;is&quot; a BOM.
* In Windows, UTF-8 is codepage codice_6 with the symbolic name codice_7 in source code.
* In MySQL, UTF-8 is called codice_8, while and refer to the obsolete CESU-8 variant.
* In Oracle Database (since version 9.0), codice_9 means UTF-8, while means CESU-8.
* In HP PCL, the Symbol-ID for UTF-8 is codice_10.

There are several current definitions of UTF-8 in various standards documents:

* / STD 63 (2003), which establishes UTF-8 as a standard internet protocol element
* defines UTF-8 NFC for Network Interchange (2008)
* ISO/IEC 10646:2020/Amd 1:2023
* &quot;The Unicode Standard, Version 16.0.0&quot; (2024)

They supersede the definitions given in the following obsolete works:

* &quot;The Unicode Standard, Version 2.0&quot;, Appendix A (1996)
* ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993 Amendment 2 / Annex R (1996)
* (1996)
* (1998)
* &quot;The Unicode Standard, Version 3.0&quot;, §2.3 (2000) plus Corrigendum #1 : UTF-8 Shortest Form (2000)
* &quot;Unicode Standard Annex #27: Unicode 3.1&quot; (2001)
* &quot;The Unicode Standard, Version 5.0&quot; (2006)
* &quot;The Unicode Standard, Version 6.0&quot; (2010)

They are all the same in their general mechanics, with the main differences being on issues such as allowed range of code point values and safe handling of invalid input.

<text>The Underground Railroad was an organized network of secret routes and safe houses used by freedom seekers to escape to the abolitionist Northern United States. Enslaved Africans and African Americans escaped from slavery as early as the 16th century and many of their escapes were unaided, but a network of safe houses generally known as the Underground Railroad began to organize in the 1780s among Abolitionistc Societies in the North. It ran north and grew steadily until the Emancipation Proclamation was signed in 1863 by President Abraham Lincoln. The escapees sought primarily to escape into free states, and potentially from there to Canada.

The network, primarily the work of free and enslaved African Americans, was assisted by abolitionists and others sympathetic to the cause of the escapees. The enslaved people who risked capture and those who aided them are also collectively referred to as the passengers and conductors of the Railroad, respectively. Various other routes led to Mexico, where slavery had been abolished, and to islands in the Caribbean that were not part of the slave trade. An earlier escape route running south toward Florida, then a Spanish possession (except 1763–1783), existed from the late 17th century until approximately 1790. During the American Civil War, freedom seekers escaped to Union lines in the South to obtain their freedom. One estimate suggests that, by 1850, approximately 100,000 slaves had escaped to freedom via the network. According to former professor of Pan-African studies, J. Blaine Hudson, who was dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Louisville, by the end of the American Civil War 500,000 or more African Americans self-emancipated from slavery on the Underground Railroad.

==Origin of the name==
Eric Foner wrote that the term &quot;was perhaps first used by a Washington newspaper in 1839, quoting a young slave hoping to escape bondage via a railroad that &#x27;went underground all the way to Boston&#x27;&quot;. Dr. Robert Clemens Smedley wrote that following slave catchers&#x27; failed searches and lost traces of fugitives as far north as Columbia, Pennsylvania, they declared in bewilderment that &quot;there must be an underground railroad somewhere,&quot; giving origin to the term. Scott Shane wrote that the first documented use of the term was in an article written by Thomas Smallwood in the August 10, 1842, edition of &quot;Tocsin of Liberty&quot;, an abolitionist newspaper published in Albany. He also wrote that the 1879 book &quot;Sketches in the History of the Underground Railroad&quot; said the phrase was mentioned in an 1839 Washington newspaper article and that the book&#x27;s author said 40 years later that he had quoted the article from memory as closely as he could.

===Terminology===

Members of the Underground Railroad often used specific terms, based on the metaphor of the railway. For example:

* People who helped fugitive slaves find the railroad were &quot;agents&quot;
* Guides were known as &quot;conductors&quot;
* Hiding places were &quot;stations&quot; or &quot;way stations&quot;
* &quot;Station masters&quot; hid escaping slaves in their homes
* People escaping slavery were referred to as &quot;passengers&quot; or &quot;cargo&quot;
* Fugitive slaves would obtain a &quot;ticket&quot;
* Similar to common gospel lore, the &quot;wheels would keep on turning&quot;
* Financial benefactors of the Railroad were known as &quot;stockholders&quot;
* Promised Land – code word for Canada
* River Jordan – code word for Ohio River
* Heaven – code for freedom or Canada
The Big Dipper (whose &quot;bowl&quot; points to the North Star) was known as the drinkin&#x27; gourd. The Railroad was often known as the &quot;freedom train&quot; or &quot;Gospel train&quot;, which headed towards &quot;Heaven&quot; or &quot;the Promised Land&quot;, i.e., Canada.

==Political background==

For the fugitive slaves who &quot;rode&quot; the Underground Railroad, many of them considered Canada their final destination. An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 of them settled in Canada, half of whom came between 1850 and 1860. Others settled in free states in the north. Thousands of court cases for fugitive slaves were recorded between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War. Under the original Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, officials from free states were required to assist slaveholders or their agents who recaptured fugitives, but some state legislatures prohibited this. The law made it easier for slaveholders and slave catchers to capture African Americans and return them to slavery, and in some cases allowed them to enslave free blacks. It also created an eagerness among abolitionists to help enslaved people, resulting in the growth of anti-slavery societies and the Underground Railroad.

With heavy lobbying by Southern politicians, the Compromise of 1850 was passed by Congress after the Mexican–American War. It included a more stringent Fugitive Slave Law; ostensibly, the compromise addressed regional problems by compelling officials of free states to assist slave catchers, granting them immunity to operate in free states. Because the law required sparse documentation to claim a person was a fugitive, slave catchers also kidnapped free blacks, especially children, and sold them into slavery. Southern politicians often exaggerated the number of escaped slaves and often blamed these escapes on Northerners interfering with Southern property rights. The law deprived people suspected of being slaves of the right to defend themselves in court, making it difficult to prove free status. Some Northern states enacted personal liberty laws that made it illegal for public officials to capture or imprison former slaves. The perception that Northern states ignored the fugitive slave laws and regulations was a major justification offered for secession.

==Routes and methods of escape==

Underground Railroad routes went north to free states and Canada, to the Caribbean, to United States western territories, and to Indian territories. Some fugitive slaves traveled south into Mexico for their freedom. Many escaped by sea, including Ona Judge, who had been enslaved by President George Washington. Some historians view the waterways of the South as an important component for freedom seekers to escape as water sources were pathways to freedom. In addition, historians of the Underground Railroad found 200,000 runaway slave advertisements in North American newspapers from the middle of the 1700s until the end of the American Civil War. Freedom seekers in Alabama hid on steamboats heading to Mobile, Alabama in hopes of blending in among the city&#x27;s free Black community, and also hid on other steamboats leaving Alabama that were headed further northward into free territories and free states. In 1852, a law was passed by the Alabama legislature to reduce the number of freedom seekers escaping on boats. The law penalized slaveholders and captains of vessels if they allowed enslaved people on board without a pass. Alabama freedom seekers also made canoes to escape. Freedom seekers escaped from their enslavers in Panama on boats heading for California by way of the Panama route. Slaveholders used the Panama route to reach California. In Panama slavery was illegal and Black Panamanians encouraged enslaved people from the United States to escape into the local city of Panama.

Freedom seekers created methods to throw off the slave catchers&#x27; bloodhounds from tracking their scent. One method was using a combination of hot pepper, lard, and vinegar on their shoes. In North Carolina freedom seekers put turpentine on their shoes to prevent slave catchers&#x27; dogs from tracking their scents, in Texas escapees used paste made from a charred bullfrog. Other runaways escaped into the swamps to wash off their scent. Most escapes occurred at night when the runaways could hide under the cover of darkness.

Another method freedom seekers used to prevent capture was carrying forged free passes. During slavery, free Blacks showed proof of their freedom by carrying a pass that proved they were free. Free Blacks and enslaved people created forged free passes for freedom seekers as they traveled through slave states.

===North to free states and Canada===

====Structure====


Despite the thoroughfare&#x27;s name, the escape network was neither literally underground nor a railroad. (The first literal underground railroad did not exist until 1863.) According to John Rankin, &quot;It was so called because they who took passage on it disappeared from public view as really as if they had gone into the ground. After the fugitive slaves entered a depot on that road no trace of them could be found. They were secretly passed from one depot to another until they arrived at a destination where they were able to remain free.&quot; It was known as a railroad, using rail terminology such as stations and conductors, because that was the transportation system in use at the time.

The Underground Railroad did not have a headquarters or governing body, nor were there published guides, maps, pamphlets, or even newspaper articles. It consisted of meeting points, secret routes, transportation, and safe houses, all of them maintained by abolitionist sympathizers and communicated by word of mouth, although there is also a report of a numeric code used to encrypt messages. Participants generally organized in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy. People escaping enslavement would move north along the route from one way station to the next. &quot;Conductors&quot; on the railroad came from various backgrounds and included free-born blacks, white abolitionists, the formerly enslaved (either escaped or manumitted), and Native Americans. Believing that slavery was &quot;contrary to the ethics of Jesus&quot;, Christian congregations and clergy played a role, especially the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), Congregationalists, Wesleyan Methodists, and Reformed Presbyterians, as well as the anti-slavery branches of mainstream denominations which entered into schism over the issue, such as the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Baptists. The role of free blacks was crucial; without it, there would have been almost no chance for fugitives from slavery to reach freedom safely. The groups of underground railroad &quot;agents&quot; worked in organizations known as vigilance committees.

Free Black communities in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and New York helped freedom seekers escape from slavery. Black Churches were stations on the Underground Railroad, and Black communities in the North hid freedom seekers in their churches and homes. Historian Cheryl Janifer Laroche explained in her book, &quot;Free Black Communities and the Underground Railroad The Geography of Resistance&quot; that: &quot;Blacks, enslaved and free, operated as the main actors in the central drama that was the Underground Railroad.&quot; Laroche further explained how some authors center white abolitionists and white people involved in the antislavery movement as the main factors for freedom seekers escapes and overlook the important role of free Black communities. In addition, author Diane Miller states: &quot;Traditionally, historians have overlooked the agency of African Americans in their own quest for freedom by portraying the Underground Railroad as an organized effort by white religious groups, often Quakers, to aid &#x27;helpless&#x27; slaves.&quot; Historian Larry Gara argues that many of the stories of the Underground Railroad belong in folklore and not history. The actions of real historical figures such as Harriet Tubman, Thomas Garrett, and Levi Coffin are exaggerated, and Northern abolitionists who guided the enslaved to Canada are hailed as the heroes of the Underground Railroad. This narrative minimizes the intelligence and agency of enslaved Black people who liberated themselves, and implies that freedom seekers needed the help of Northerners to escape.

====Geography====

The Underground Railroad benefited greatly from the geography of the U.S.–Canada border: Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and most of New York were separated from Canada by water, over which transport was usually easy to arrange and relatively safe. The main route for freedom seekers from the South led up the Appalachians, Harriet Tubman going via Harpers Ferry, through the highly anti-slavery Western Reserve region of northeastern Ohio to the vast shore of Lake Erie, and then to Canada by boat. A smaller number, traveling by way of New York or New England, went via Syracuse (home of Samuel May) and Rochester, New York (home of Frederick Douglass), crossing the Niagara River or Lake Ontario into Canada. By 1848 the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge had been built—it crossed the Niagara River and connected New York to Canada. Enslaved runaways used the bridge to escape their bondage, and Harriet Tubman used the bridge to take freedom seekers into Canada. Those traveling via the New York Adirondacks, sometimes via Black communities like Timbuctoo, New York, entered Canada via Ogdensburg, on the St. Lawrence River, or on Lake Champlain (Joshua Young assisted). The western route, used by John Brown among others, led from Missouri west to free Kansas and north to free Iowa, then east via Chicago to the Detroit River.

Thomas Downing was a free Black man in New York and operated his Oyster restaurant as a stop on the Underground Railroad. Freedom seekers (runaway slaves) escaping slavery and seeking freedom hid in the basement of Downing&#x27;s restaurant. Enslaved people helped freedom seekers escape from slavery. Arnold Gragstone was enslaved and helped runaways escape from slavery by guiding them across the Ohio River for their freedom.

William Still, sometimes called &quot;The Father of the Underground Railroad&quot;, helped hundreds of slaves escape (as many as 60 a month), sometimes hiding them in his Philadelphia home. He kept careful records, including short biographies of the people, that contained frequent railway metaphors. He maintained correspondence with many of them, often acting as a middleman in communications between people who had escaped slavery and those left behind. He later published these accounts in the book &quot;The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts&quot; (1872), a valuable resource for historians to understand how the system worked and learn about individual ingenuity in escapes.

According to Still, messages were often encoded so that they could be understood only by those active in the railroad. For example, the following message, &quot;I have sent via at two o&#x27;clock four large hams and two small hams&quot;, indicated that four adults and two children were sent by train from Harrisburg to Philadelphia. The additional word &quot;via&quot; indicated that the &quot;passengers&quot; were not sent on the usual train, but rather via Reading, Pennsylvania. In this case, the authorities were tricked into going to the regular location (station) in an attempt to intercept the runaways, while Still met them at the correct station and guided them to safety. They eventually escaped either further north or to Canada, where slavery had been abolished during the 1830s.

To reduce the risk of infiltration, many people associated with the Underground Railroad knew only their part of the operation and not of the whole scheme. &quot;Conductors&quot; led or transported the &quot;passengers&quot; from station to station. A conductor sometimes pretended to be enslaved to enter a plantation. Once a part of a plantation, the conductor would direct the runaways to the North. Enslaved people traveled at night, about to each station. They rested, and then a message was sent to the next station to let the station master know the escapees were on their way. They would stop at the so-called &quot;stations&quot; or &quot;depots&quot; during the day and rest. The stations were often located in basements, barns, churches, or in hiding places in caves.

The resting spots where the freedom seekers could sleep and eat were given the code names &quot;stations&quot; and &quot;depots&quot;, which were held by &quot;station masters&quot;. &quot;Stockholders&quot; gave money or supplies for assistance. Using biblical references, fugitives referred to Canada as the &quot;Promised Land&quot; or &quot;Heaven&quot; and the Ohio River, which marked the boundary between slave states and free states, as the &quot;River Jordan&quot;.

====Traveling conditions====

Although the freedom seekers sometimes traveled on boat or train, they usually traveled on foot or by wagon, sometimes lying down, covered with hay or similar products, in groups of one to three escapees. Some groups were considerably larger. Abolitionist Charles Turner Torrey and his colleagues rented horses and wagons and often transported as many as 15 or 20 people at a time. Free and enslaved black men occupied as mariners (sailors) helped enslaved people escape from slavery by providing a ride on their ship, providing information on the safest and best escape routes, and safe locations on land, and locations of trusted people for assistance. Enslaved African-American mariners had information about slave revolts occurring in the Caribbean, and relayed this news to enslaved people they had contact with in American ports. Free and enslaved African-American mariners assisted Harriet Tubman in her rescue missions. Black mariners provided to her information about the best escape routes and helped her on her rescue missions. In New Bedford, Massachusetts, freedom seekers stowed away on ships leaving the docks with the assistance of Black and white crewmembers and hid in the ships&#x27; cargoes during their journey to freedom.

Enslaved people living near rivers escaped on boats and canoes. In 1855, Mary Meachum, a free Black woman, attempted to help eight or nine slaves escape from slavery on the Mississippi River near St. Louis, Missouri to the free state of Illinois. To assist with the escape were white antislavery activists and an African American guide from Illinois named &quot;Freeman.&quot; However, the escape was not successful because word of the escape reached police agents and slave catchers who waited across the river on the Illinois shore. Breckenridge, Burrows and Meachum were arrested. Prior to this escape attempt, Mary Meachum and her husband John, a former slave, were agents on the Underground Railroad and helped other slaves escape from slavery crossing the Mississippi River.

Routes were often purposely indirect to confuse pursuers. Most escapes were by individuals or small groups; occasionally, there were mass escapes, such as with the &quot;Pearl&quot; incident. The journey was often considered particularly difficult and dangerous for women or children. Children were sometimes hard to keep quiet or were unable to keep up with a group. In addition, enslaved women were rarely allowed to leave the plantation, making it harder for them to escape in the same ways that men could. Although escaping was harder for women, some women were successful. One of the most famous and successful conductors (people who secretly traveled into slave states to rescue those seeking freedom) was Harriet Tubman, a woman who escaped slavery.

Due to the risk of discovery, information about routes and safe havens was passed along by word of mouth, although in 1896 there is a reference to a numerical code used to encrypt messages. Southern newspapers of the day were often filled with pages of notices soliciting information about fugitive slaves and offering sizable rewards for their capture and return. Federal marshals and professional bounty hunters known as slave catchers pursued freedom seekers as far as the Canada–U.S. border.

Freedom seekers (runaway slaves) foraged, fished, and hunted for food on their journey to freedom on the Underground Railroad. With these ingredients, they prepared one-pot meals (stews), a West African cooking method. Enslaved and free Black people left food outside their front doors to provide nourishment to the freedom seekers. The meals created on the Underground Railroad became a part of the foodways of Black Americans called soul food.

===Maroons===

The majority of freedom seekers that escaped from slavery did not have help from an abolitionist. Although there are stories of black and white abolitionists helping freedom seekers escape from slavery, many escapes were unaided.
Other Underground Railroad escape routes for freedom seekers were maroon communities. Maroon communities were hidden places, such as wetlands or marshes, where escaped slaves established their own independent communities. Examples of maroon communities in the United States include the Black Seminole communities in Florida, as well as groups that lived in the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia and in the Okefenokee swamp of Georgia and Florida, among others. In the 1780s, Louisiana had a maroon community in the bayous of Saint Malo. The leader of the Saint Malo maroon community was Jean Saint Malo, a freedom seeker who escaped to live among other runaways in the swamps and bayous of Saint Malo. The population of maroons was fifty and the Spanish colonial government broke up the community and on June 19, 1784, Jean Saint Malo was executed. Colonial South Carolina had a number of maroon settlements in its marshland regions in the Lowcountry and near rivers. Maroons in South Carolina fought to maintain their freedom and prevent enslavement in Ashepoo in 1816, Williamsburg County in 1819, Georgetown in 1820, Jacksonborough in 1822, and near Marion in 1861. Historian Herbert Aptheker found evidence that fifty maroon communities existed in the United States between 1672 and 1864. The history of maroons showed how the enslaved resisted enslavement by living in free independent settlements. Historical archeologist Dan Sayer says that historians downplay the importance of maroon settlements and place valor in white involvement in the Underground Railroad, which he argues shows a racial bias, indicating a &quot;...reluctance to acknowledge the strength of black resistance and initiative.&quot;

===Freedom routes into Native American lands===

From colonial America into the 19th century, Indigenous peoples of North America assisted and protected enslaved Africans journey to freedom. However, not all Indigenous communities were accepting of freedom seekers, some of whom they enslaved themselves or returned to their former enslavers. The earliest accounts of escape are from the 16th century. In 1526, Spaniards established the first European colony in the continental United States in South Carolina called San Miguel de Gualdape. The enslaved Africans revolted and historians suggest they escaped to Shakori Indigenous communities. As early as 1689, enslaved Africans fled from the South Carolina Lowcountry to Spanish Florida seeking freedom. The Seminole Nation accepted Gullah runaways (today called Black Seminoles) into their lands. This was a southern route on the Underground Railroad into Seminole Indian lands that went from Georgia and the Carolinas into Florida. In Northwest Ohio in the 18th and 19th centuries, three Indigenous/Native American nations, the Shawnee, Ottawa, and Wyandot assisted freedom seekers escape from slavery. The Ottawa people accepted and protected runaways in their villages. Other escapees were taken to Fort Malden by the Ottawa. In Upper Sandusky, Wyandot people allowed a maroon community of freedom seekers in their lands called Negro Town for four decades.

In the 18th and 19th centuries in areas around the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware, Nanticoke people hid freedom seekers in their villages. The Nanticoke people lived in small villages near the Pocomoke River; the river rises in several forks in the Great Cypress Swamp in southern Sussex County, Delaware. African Americans escaping slavery were able to hide in swamps, and the water washed off the scent of enslaved runaways making it difficult for dogs to track their scent. As early as the 18th centuries, mixed blood communities formed. In Maryland, freedom seekers escaped to Shawnee villages located along the Potomac River. Slaveholders in Virginia and Maryland filed numerous complaints and court petitions against the Shawnee and Nanticoke for hiding freedom seekers in their villages. Odawa people also accepted freedom seekers into their villages. The Odawa transferred the runaways to the Ojibwe who escorted them to Canada. Some enslaved people who escaped slavery and fled to Native American villages stayed in their communities. White pioneers who traveled to Kentucky and the Ohio Territory saw &quot;Black Shawnees&quot; living with Indigenous people in the trans-Appalachian west. During the colonial era in New Spain and in the Seminole Nation in Florida, African Americans and Indigenous marriages occurred.

===South to Florida and Mexico===

====Background====
Beginning in the 16th century, Spaniards brought enslaved Africans to New Spain, including Mission Nombre de Dios in what would become the city of St. Augustine in Spanish Florida. Over time, free Afro-Spaniards took up various trades and occupations and served in the colonial militia. After King Charles II of Spain proclaimed Spanish Florida a safe haven for escaped slaves from British North America, they began escaping to Florida by the hundreds from as far north as New York. The Spanish established Fort Mose for free Blacks in the St. Augustine area in 1738.

In 1806, enslaved people arrived at the Stone Fort in Nacogdoches, Texas seeking freedom. They arrived with a forged passport from a Kentucky judge. The Spanish refused to return them back to the United States. More freedom seekers traveled through Texas the following year.

Enslaved people were emancipated by crossing the border from the United States into Mexico, which was a Spanish colony into the nineteenth century. In the United States, enslaved people were considered property. That meant that they did not have rights to marry and they could be sold away from their partners. They also did not have rights to fight inhumane and cruel punishment. In New Spain, fugitive slaves were recognized as humans. They were allowed to join the Catholic Church and marry. They also were protected from inhumane and cruel punishment.

During the War of 1812, U.S. Army general Andrew Jackson invaded Spanish Florida in part because enslaved people had run away from plantations in the Carolinas and Georgia to Florida. Some of the runaways joined the Black Seminoles who later moved to Mexico. However, Mexico sent mixed signals on its position against slavery. Sometimes it allowed enslaved people to be returned to slavery and it allowed Americans to move into Spanish territorial property in order to populate the North, where the Americans would then establish cotton plantations, bringing enslaved people to work the land.

In 1829, Mexican president Vicente Guerrero (who was a mixed race black man) formally abolished slavery in Mexico. Freedom seekers from Southern plantations in the Deep South, particularly from Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, escaped slavery and headed for Mexico. At that time, Texas was part of Mexico. The Texas Revolution, initiated in part to legalize slavery, resulted in the formation of the Republic of Texas in 1836. Following the Battle of San Jacinto, there were some enslaved people who withdrew from the Houston area with the Mexican army, seeing the troops as a means to escape slavery. When Texas joined the Union in 1845, it was a slave state and the Rio Grande became the international border with Mexico.

Pressure between free and slave states deepened as Mexico abolished slavery and western states joined the Union as free states. As more free states were added to the Union, the lesser the influence of slave state representatives in Congress.

====Slave states and slave hunters====
The Southern Underground Railroad went through slave states, lacking the abolitionist societies and the organized system of the north. People who spoke out against slavery were subject to mobs, physical assault, and being hanged. There were slave catchers who looked for runaway slaves. There were never more than a few hundred free blacks in Texas, which meant that free blacks did not feel safe in the state. The network to freedom was informal, random, and dangerous.

U.S. military forts, established along the Rio Grande border during the Mexican–American War of the 1840s, captured and returned fleeing enslaved people to their slaveholders.

The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 made it a criminal act to aid fleeing escaping enslaved people in free states. Similarly, the United States government wanted to enact a treaty with Mexico so that they would help capture and return bonds-people. Mexico, however, continued their practice to allow anyone that crossed their borders to be free. Slave catchers continued to cross the southern border into Mexico and illegally capture black people and return them to slavery. A group of slave hunters became the Texas Rangers.

====Routes====

Thousands of freedom seekers traveled along a network from the southern United States to Texas and ultimately Mexico. Southern enslaved people generally traveled across &quot;unforgiving country&quot; on foot or horseback while pursued by lawmen and slave hunters. Some stowed away on ferries bound for a Mexican port from New Orleans, Louisiana and Galveston, Texas. There were some who transported cotton to Brownsville, Texas on wagons and then crossed into Mexico at Matamoros.
Many traveled through North Carolina, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, or Mississippi toward Texas and ultimately Mexico. People fled slavery from Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). Black Seminoles traveled on a southwestern route from Florida into Mexico.

Going overland meant that the last 150 miles or so were traversed through the difficult and extremely hot terrain of the Nueces Strip located between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande. There was little shade and a lack of potable water in this brush country. Escapees were more likely to survive the trip if they had a horse and a gun.

The National Park Service identified a route from Natchitoches, Louisiana to Monclova, Mexico in 2010 that is roughly the southern Underground Railroad path. It is also believed that &quot;El Camino Real de los Tejas&quot; was a path for freedom. It was made a National Historic Trail by President George W. Bush in 2004.

====Assistance====
Some journeyed on their own without assistance, and others were helped by people along the southern Underground Railroad. Assistance included guidance, directions, shelter, and supplies.

Black people, black and white couples, and anti-slavery German immigrants provided support, but most of the help came from Mexican laborers. So much so that enslavers came to distrust any Mexican, and a law was enacted in Texas that forbade Mexicans from talking to enslaved people. Mexican migrant workers developed relationships with enslaved black workers whom they worked with. They offered guidance, such as what it would be like to cross the border, and empathy. Having realized the ways in which Mexicans were helping enslaved people to escape, slaveholders and residents of Texan towns pushed people out of the town, whipped them in public, or lynched them.

Some border officials helped enslaved people crossing into Mexico. In Monclova, Mexico a border official took up a collection in the town for a family in need of food, clothing, and money to continue on their journey south and out of reach of slave hunters. Once they crossed the border, some Mexican authorities helped former enslaved people from being returned to the United States by slave hunters.

Freedom seekers that were taken on ferries to Mexican ports were aided by Mexican ship captains, one of whom was caught in Louisiana and indicted for helping enslaved people escape.

Knowing the repercussions of running away or being caught helping someone runaway, people were careful to cover their tracks, and public and personal records about fugitive slaves are scarce. In greater supply are records by people who promoted slavery or attempted to catch fugitive slaves. More than 2,500 escapes are documented by the Texas Runaway Slave Project at Stephen F. Austin State University.

====Southern freedom seekers====
Advertisements were placed in newspapers offering rewards for the return of their &quot;property&quot;. Slave catchers traveled through Mexico. There were Black Seminoles, or &quot;Los Mascogos&quot; who lived in northern Mexico who provided armed resistance.

Sam Houston, president of the Republic of Texas, was the slaveholder to Tom who ran away. He headed to Texas and once there he enlisted in the Mexican military.

One enslaved man was branded with the letter &quot;R&quot; on each side of his cheek after a failed attempt to escape slavery. He tried again in the winter of 1819, leaving the cotton plantation of his enslaver on horseback. With four others, they traveled southwest to Mexico at the risk of being attacked by hostile Native Americans, apprehended by slave catchers, or attacked by &quot;horse-eating alligators&quot;.

Many people did not make it to Mexico. In 1842, a Mexican man and a black woman left Jackson County, Texas on two horses, but they were caught at the Lavaca River. The wife, an enslaved woman, was valuable to her owner so she was returned to slavery. Her husband, possibly a farm laborer or an indentured servant, was immediately lynched.

Fugitive slaves changed their names in Mexico. They married into Mexican families and relocated further south of the American-Mexican border. All of these factors makes it hard to trace the whereabouts of the formerly enslaved people. A database at Stephen F. Austin State University has a database of runaway slave advertisements as part of The Texas Runaway Slave Project. The Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression initiated a Federal Writers&#x27; Project to document slave narratives, including those who settled in Mexico. One of them was Felix Haywood, who found freedom when he crossed the Rio Grande.

====Rio Grande stations====
Two families, the Webbers and the Jacksons, lived along the Rio Grande and helped people escape slavery. The husbands were white and the wives were black women who had been formerly enslaved. It is not known if Nathaniel Jackson purchased the freedom of Matilda Hicks and her family, but in the early 1860s they moved to Hidalgo county, where they settled and lived as a family. He was a white southerner and she was an enslaved woman, who had been childhood sweethearts in Alabama. He was the son of her slaveholder, who helped a group of seven families in 1857 and others cross into Mexico.

Silvia Hector Webber was born enslaved in West Florida and in 1819 was sold to a slaveholder in Clark County, Arkansas. The slaveholders&#x27;s son, John Cryer, illegally brought Silvia to Mexican Texas in 1828, four years after Mexico had deemed the slave trade into Mexican territory against the law. Silvia, however, with the help of John Webber secured her and her 3 children&#x27;s freedom papers in 1834. Together Silvia and John lived an antislavery life and often harbored fugitives from slavery in their ranch and house. Silvia was known to transport freedom seekers, on a ferry she licensed at her ranch, onto freedom in Mexico.

John Ferdinand Webber, born in Vermont, lived along the Rio Grande with his wife, Silvia Hector Webber, and together were known to have helped enslaved people cross the Rio Grande. The Jacksons and Webbers, who both owned licensed ferry service, were well known among runaways.

====Arrival in Mexico====
Fugitive slaves who made it to Mexico lived with the knowledge that they could be illegally kidnapped by slave catchers or blackbirders. Slave hunters who tried to kidnap former slaves from Mexico could be taken to court or shot.

There was little support from their new communities and few opportunities for employment. They did not have official paperwork that stated that they were free. They were, though, able to enter into indentured servitude contracts and join military colonies.

Some people, after they settled in Mexico, returned to the United States to help family members escape and to guide them to Mexico.

====Colonies====
There were abolitionists from the north who petitioned the Mexican government to establish colonies for free and runaway blacks. Benjamin Lundy, a Quaker, lobbied for a colony to be established in what is now Texas during the early 1830s, but he was unable to do so when Texas legalized slavery when it separated from Mexico and became the Republic of Texas (1836). Black Seminoles successfully petitioned for land and established a colony in 1852. The land is still owned by their descendants.

====Scholarship====
The Texas Runaway Slave Project, located in Nacogdoches at the Stephen F. Austin State University, has researched runaway advertisements that appeared in 19,000 editions of newspapers from the mid-19th century.

Alice L. Baumgartner has studied the prevalence of people who fled slavery from the Southern states to Mexico. She published &quot;South to Freedom: Runaway Slaves to Mexico and the Road to the Civil War&quot;. Thomas Mareite completed a doctoral dissertation at Leiden University on the social and political experiences of enslaved people who escaped from the U.S. South to Mexico, titled &quot;Conditional Freedom: Free Soil and Fugitive Slaves from the U.S. South to Mexico&#x27;s Northeast, 1803–1861&quot;. Roseann Bacha-Garza, of the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, has managed historical archeology projects and has researched the incidence of enslaved people who fled to Mexico. Mekala Audain has also published a chapter titled &quot;A Scheme to Desert: The Louisiana Purchase and Freedom Seekers in the Louisiana-Texas Borderlands, 1804–1806&quot; in the edited volume &quot;In Search of Liberty: African American Internationalism in the Nineteenth-Century Atlantic World.&quot; Maria Esther Hammack completed her doctoral dissertation on the subject in 2021 at the University of Texas at Austin.

===&quot;Reverse Underground Railroad&quot;===
Freedom seekers were not the only black people at risk from slave catchers. With demand for slaves high in the Deep South as cotton was planted, strong, healthy blacks in their prime working and reproductive years were seen and treated as highly valuable commodities. Both former slaves and free blacks were sometimes kidnapped and sold into slavery, as in the well-documented case of Solomon Northup, a New York-born free black who was kidnapped by Southern slavers while visiting Washington, DC. &quot;Certificates of freedom&quot;, also known as &quot;free papers&quot;, were signed and statements attesting to the free status of individual Blacks. They could easily be destroyed or stolen, so they provided little protection.

Some buildings, such as the Crenshaw House in far-southeastern Illinois, are known sites where free blacks were sold into slavery, known as the &quot;Reverse Underground Railroad&quot;.

===American Revolutionary War routes (1775 to 1783)===


During the American Revolutionary War, enslaved people escaped from bondage and fled to British forces, Canada, Florida, and Native American lands. The last Royal Governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, planned to weaken American colonists by issuing a proclamation in 1775 that gave freedom to the enslaved who escaped their American colonial masters and joined the British. According to a PBS and National Park Service article this proclamation resulted in an estimated 100,000 freedom seekers escaping during the war. American colonial officers received numerous requests for the return of escaped slaves. In November of 1775, Dunmore started a military unit of 300 freedom seekers in North Carolina called &quot;the Ethiopian Regiment.&quot; In Virginia 800 freedom seekers joined the regiment. American colonists tried to deter freedom seekers from joining the British by sending slave patrols to stop runaways, and published newspapers and editorials stating the British will not act on their promise of granting freedom to runaway slaves. Thousands of free and enslaved Black people fought with the British in hopes to gain their freedom were called Black Loyalists. Black Loyalists who served with the British for one year received Certificates of Freedom and were taken to Caribbean British colonies to live as free people in the Bahamas and Jamaica, and others were taken north to Canada. Between 1783 and 1785, 3,000 enslaved and free Black Americans settled in the British colony of Nova Scotia, Canada. Other enslaved people ran away to join the Continental Army or Patriot militias. Black Americans who fought in the Continental Army were called Black Patriots, and some did earn their freedom through their military service. Some enslaved runaways took the war as an opportunity to escape using their enslaver&#x27;s horse.

===War of 1812 routes===

During the War of 1812, 700 enslaved people in Maryland escaped from slavery. Before the war, freedom seekers escaped to the Michigan Territory by crossing the Detroit River. Over the years the numbers of escaped African Americans grew in the territory. Territorial governor William Hull offered Peter Denison, an enslaved man, &quot;a written license&quot; allowing him to form a militia company of free Blacks and escaped slaves. The men were armed and trained but Hull disbanded the militia. Some of the Black men in the militia escaped from slavery in British Canada. In the 18th century, slavery was practiced in Canada, and by 1793 it was phased out, but some Black Canadians remained enslaved. During the late 18th century and early 19th century, the route of freedom seekers went south beginning in British Canada to their final destination in free American territories in the Old Northwest. By the War of 1812, slave laws in British Canada prohibited the continuation of slavery. This changed the final destinations of freedom seekers in the United States to look north to Canada to obtain their freedom. In the summer of 1812, Hull declared that enslaved runaways and free Blacks in the Michigan Territory were free citizens, and when war broke out with Britain, Black citizens of Michigan were armed to fight against the British. After his military service, Peter Denison and his family left Michigan and relocated north to Canada.

====Black Refugees====

In April of 1814, the British Army promised freedom to enslaved Black Americans who joined the British military or who choose freedom in British colonies. In the Chesapeake Region of Virginia and Maryland and coastal areas of Georgia, about 4,000 enslaved Black Americans escaped from slavery. Within the number of 4,000 freedom seekers who escaped, 2,000 sailed to Nova Scotia between September 1813 and August 1816 on naval vessels and private ships chartered by the British and were taken to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, Canada and 400 freedom seekers were taken to Trinidad in the Caribbean. The Black people who settled in British Canada are known as Black refugees who escaped slavery in the United States and sided with the British during the War of 1812.

====Merikens====

The Merikins were formerly enslaved Black Americans that escaped slavery and joined the British military&#x27;s all-Black unit of Colonial Marines during the War of 1812. When the war ended, they were taken to numerous British colonies to live as free people. About 700 Colonial Marines were taken to Trinidad in the Caribbean. Although slavery was legal in Trinidad, they were guaranteed protection under commander Robert Mitchell. The formerly Black Americans called themselves Merikens, &quot;an abbreviated word for &#x27;Americans&#x27;&quot; and started new lives in Trinidad in six Company Villages in the southern part of the island. The Trinidadian government provided the Merikens with food, rations, clothing, and tools needed to build their homes, and they grew their own food of corn, pumpkin, plantain, and rice.

===The &quot;Saltwater Railroad&quot; freedom route===

From 1821 to 1861, freedom seekers escaped from the Southeastern slave states of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida to the Bahamas on a secret route called the &quot;Saltwater Railroad.&quot; Prior to 1821, Florida was a Spanish colony called by historians, Spanish Florida, where enslaved runaways were declared free under Spanish laws. However, by 1821 Florida was under the control of the United States. Free Blacks in Florida feared they might be re-enslaved under American laws and hundreds of free people escaped to the Bahamas. From 1821 to 1825, the Southern beaches of Florida provided a safe haven for freedom seekers looking to escape on boats that departed from Florida going to the island. Other freedom seekers escaped by making their own canoes and boats and sailed to the Bahamas unaided.

By 1825, the construction of the Cape Florida Lighthouse (in present-day Miami-Dade County) was a setback to enslaved runaways looking to escape at night on boats off the Florida coast due to the bright light that was helpful to guide sailors off the Florida Reef. The Bahamas attracted enslaved people because there was a community of Black Seminoles and other escapees. The Bahamas was a British controlled island where under local imperial practices Black people owned land, had access to education, and were legally married. In addition, in 1825, Britain declared that any escapees reaching British controlled lands were free. This declaration resulted in hundreds of more slaves in the United States to escape to the island. By the 1830s, historians estimate that at least 6,000 freedom seekers made their way to the Bahamas, and by the 1840s, the Bahamas had more enslaved runaways than any British colony in the Caribbean. The actions of Britain to liberate enslaved Americans strained political relationships with the United States. In 1841 on the slave ship, &quot;Creole&quot;, a slave revolt occurred. The Creole departed from Virginia with over one hundred enslaved people heading to New Orleans, Louisiana. The enslaved revolted and took control of the ship and sailed it to Nassau in the Bahamas. This revolt sparked international attention; the escapees were charged but later released.

===Fugitive Slave Act of 1850===

Under the terms of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, when suspected fugitives were seized and brought to a special magistrate known as a commissioner, they had no right to a jury trial and could not testify on their own behalf. Between 1850 and 1860, 343 freedom seekers were taken before a commissioner and 332 were returned to slavery. Commissioners received ten dollars when they ruled in favor of a slaveholder and received five dollars if they ruled in a slave&#x27;s favor. Technically, they were not accused of a crime. The marshal or private slave-catcher needed only to swear an oath to acquire a writ of &quot;replevin&quot; for the return of property. A fine of 1,000 dollars was charged to individuals who assisted a freedom seeker&#x27;s escape.

Congress was dominated by Southern congressmen because the population of their states was bolstered by the inclusion of three-fifths of the number of slaves in population totals. They passed the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 because of frustration at having fugitives from slavery helped by the public and even official institutions outside the South. In some parts of the North, slave catchers needed police protection.

According to author Andrew Delbanco, &quot;Northerners began to realize slavery wasn&#x27;t just a Southern issue after the passage of the 1850 law.&quot; Prior to the American Civil War, the nation was divided on how to deal with enslaved runaways. The Fugitive Slave Act further divided the nation as Southern slaveholders now had political power to return freedom seekers who escaped to the North and return them to the South, and Northerners were required by law to assist in the return of runaways.

Some freedom seekers were arrested under the fugitive slave law; they were, Anthony Burns, John Price, Shadrach Minkins, Stephen Pembroke and his two sons, and others. Abolitionists used these cases to push the question of slavery at the center of national politics; they argued that enslaved people&#x27;s resistance to enslavement through numerous escapes advocates the abolition of slavery.

A few weeks after the fugitive slave law passed, Black populations in Northern cities declined due to formerly enslaved African Americans migrating to Canada in fear they might be captured and re-enslaved. On August 1, 1834, Britain abolished slavery in Canada and throughout the British Empire, making Canada a safer choice for American slaves and free Blacks seeking freedom. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania most of the Black waiters working in the city&#x27;s hotel fled to Canada. Columbia, Pennsylvania&#x27;s Black population decreased by half. Between mid-February and early March of 1851, one hundred free African Americans and fugitives fled the city of Boston. Abolitionists in Detroit, Michigan guided 1,200 free people to Canada. By December of 1850, it is estimated that 3,000 African Americans took refuge in Canada.

===American Civil War routes (1861 to 1865)===

During the American Civil War, the Union Army captured Southern towns in Beaufort, South Carolina, St. Simons Island, Georgia, and other areas and setup encampments. As a result, enslaved people on nearby plantations escaped from slavery and ran to Union lines for freedom and to sign up to fight in the Union Army. American historian Eric Foner explains in his book, &quot;Gateway to Freedom: The Hidden History of the Underground Railroad,&quot; that: &quot;...the Civil War fundamentally transformed the opportunities available for slaves seeking freedom. As soon as federal troops which in Maryland meant the very beginning of the war, slaves sought refuge with the Union...&quot; Susie King Taylor was born enslaved in Liberty County, Georgia and escaped from slavery with her family to Union lines in St. Catherine&#x27;s Island, Georgia with the help of her uncle who put her on a federal gunboat plying the waters near Confederate-held Fort Pulaski. In addition, thousands of enslaved Black Americans escaped slavery and fled to Union lines in the South Carolina Sea Islands. In 1861, Jarvis Harvey escaped from slavery and sailed to Union lines at Fortress Monroe, Virginia. Robert Sutton was born enslaved in Alberti Plantation along Florida&#x27;s northeastern boundary with Georgia, and during the Civil War he escaped from slavery by making a canoe and sailed out to Port Royal, South Carolina where Black Americans were freed from slavey after the Battle of Port Royal and signed up to fight in the 1st South Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Prince Rivers escaped from slavery and found freedom in Union lines in Port Royal, South Carolina after his enslaver fled Beaufort upon arrival of the Union Navy and Army. Rivers later signed up to fight in the 1st South Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment. On May 12, 1862, Robert Smalls and sixteen enslaved people escaped from slavery during the Civil War on a Confederate ship and sailed it out the Charleston Harbor to a Union blockade in South Carolina.

Underground Railroad agents shifted their efforts and escape plans around Union encampments because large numbers of freedom seekers escaped to Union occupied territories and not the North for their freedom. For example, the Kansas territory became a state in 1861, and slavery was prohibited in the state of Kansas. During the Civil War, abolitionists, free staters, and Jayhawkers helped to emancipate freedom seekers who escaped slavery from Missouri (a slave state that bordered Kansas) and brought them back to Kansas as contraband of war. An article from the National Park Service explains how the Civil War shifted the escape routes and final destinations of freedom seekers: &quot;But, no sooner had Union troops appeared in the border states, on the islands off the Atlantic coast, and in the lower Mississippi Valley, than thousands of blacks took the opportunity to liberate themselves by absconding to the Yankee (Union) camps. A first effort to send them back to their masters was soon abandoned. The runaways became &#x27;contraband,&#x27; or confiscated property of war. Many of them quickly found work within the Union lines and members of their families began to join them.&quot;

The word contraband was given to enslaved runaways by Union General Benjamin Butler. In 1861, three enslaved men in Norfolk, Virginia, Shepard Mallory, Frank Baker, and James Townsend, escaped from slavery and fled to Union lines at Fort Monroe. Butler refused to act on the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 that required the return of escaped slaves to their enslavers. Instead, Butler kept the three men because they were &quot;property&quot; of the Confederate States and not the United States where the Fugitive Slave Act was passed and enforced. An article from the National Trust for Historical Preservation explains: &quot;...Butler realized the absurdity of honoring the Fugitive Slave Law, which dictated that he return the three runaways to their owner. They had been helping to construct a Confederate battery that threatened his fort. Why send them back and bolster that effort? So the general struck upon a politically expedient solution: Because Virginia had seceded from the Union, he argued, he no longer had a constitutional obligation to return the runaways. Rather, in keeping with military law governing war between nations, he would seize the three runaways as contraband—property to be used by the enemy against the Union.&quot;

As the Civil War continued, areas of the South and border states became refugee camps for freedom seekers. Washington D.C. was a large refugee area during the war. On April 16, 1862, Congress passed the Compensated Emancipation Act that abolished slavery in the District of Columbia. After the passage of this act, freedom seekers from Virginia and Maryland escaped and found freedom in the District of Columbia, and by 1863, there were 10,000 refugees (former runaway slaves) in the city and their numbers doubled the Black population in Washington, D.C. During the war, enslaved people living near Beaufort County, South Carolina escaped from slavery and fled to Union lines in Beaufort because African Americans in the county were freed from slavery after the Battle of Port Royal on November 7, 1861 when the plantation owners fled the area after the arrival of the Union Navy and Army. As a result, a refugee camp was started to provide safety and protection to freedom seekers. In the beginning there were sixty to seventy runaways, but as time progressed the numbers of refugees grew to 320. The Union Army did not have enough food rations and clothes to take care of them. Free men, women, and children in Beaufort&#x27;s refugee camp were paid to work for the Union as cooks, laundress, servants, and carpenters. Union forces occupied Corinth, Mississippi and slaves from nearby plantations escaped to Union lines. To accommodate the freedom seekers, general Grenville M. Dodge established the Corinth Contraband Camp with homes, schools, hospitals, churches, and paid employment for African Americans. It was estimated that Corinth Contraband Camp provided a new life for 6,000 former slaves.

====Union Navy and Emancipation====

The Secretary of the Navy during the Civil War was Gideon Welles and in September of 1861 Welles declared that enslaved and free African Americans could enlist at the lowest rating of &quot;Boy&quot; in the Union Navy. Union vessels located in Southern ports received numbers of runaways who fled slavery by way of small boats to vessels docked in Union controlled territories. Benjamin Gould recorded in his journal that by September 22, 1862, eight freedom seekers had arrived at the USS &quot;Cambridge&quot; and that 20 more runaways arrived two weeks later. One of the escaped freedom seekers listed was William Gould, who later joined the Union (U.S.) Navy and fought against the Confederacy from 1862 to 1865. The Union vessel USS Harftford helped to liberate enslaved people while going up the Mississippi River. Bartholomew Diggins, who served aboard the vessel, recalled the events of liberating the enslaved. He said: &quot;we picked [up] many negroes [sic] slaves who would come out to the ships in small boats at every place we anchored.&quot; Other Union vessels that helped to liberate the enslaved were the USS Essex and USS Iroquois. A few Union soldiers and sailors returned escaped slaves back to their enslavers. By the end of the war, 179,000 formerly enslaved and free Black Americans had fought in the Union Army, and 21,000 had fought in the Union Navy. 

From the American Revolutionary War, through the War of 1812, and then the American Civil War, the Underground Railroad contributed to hundreds and sometimes thousands of escapes by African Americans.

====Legal and political====
When frictions between North and South culminated in the Civil War, many Black people, both enslaved and free, fought for the Union Army. Following Union victory in the Civil War, on December 6, 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution outlawed slavery except as punishment for a crime. Following its passage, in some cases the Underground Railroad operated in the opposite direction, as people who had escaped to Canada returned to the United States.

====Criticism====
Frederick Douglass was a writer and orator who had escaped slavery. He wrote critically of the attention drawn to the ostensibly secret Underground Railroad in his first autobiography, &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave&quot; (1845):

He went on to say that, although he honored the movement, he felt that the efforts at publicity served more to enlighten the slave-owners than the slaves, making them more watchful and making it more difficult for future slaves to escape.

===Arrival in Canada===


British North America (present-day Canada) was a desirable destination, as its long border gave many points of access, it was farther from slave catchers, and it was beyond the reach of the United States&#x27; Fugitive Slave Acts. Further, slavery ended decades earlier in Canada than in the United States. Britain banned the institution of slavery in present-day Canada (and in most British colonies) in 1833, though the practice of slavery in Canada had effectively ended already early in the 19th century through case law, due to court decisions resulting from litigation on behalf of slaves seeking manumission.

Most former enslaved, reaching Canada by boat across Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, settled in Ontario. More than 30,000 people were said to have escaped there via the network during its 20-year peak period, although U.S. census figures account for only 6,000. Numerous fugitives&#x27; stories are documented in the 1872 book &quot;The Underground Railroad Records&quot; by William Still, an abolitionist who then headed the Philadelphia Vigilance Committee.

Estimates vary widely, but at least 30,000 slaves, and potentially more than 100,000, escaped to Canada via the Underground Railroad. The largest group settled in Upper Canada (Ontario), called Canada West from 1841. Numerous Black Canadian communities developed in Southern Ontario. These were generally in the triangular region bounded by Niagara Falls, Toronto, and Windsor. Several rural villages made up mostly of people freed from slavery were established in Kent and Essex counties in Ontario.

Fort Malden, in Amherstburg, Ontario, was deemed the &quot;chief place of entry&quot; for escaped slaves seeking to enter Canada. The abolitionist Levi Coffin, who was known for aiding over 2,000 fugitives to safety, supported this choice. He described Fort Malden as &quot;the great landing place, the principle terminus of the underground railroad of the west.&quot; After 1850, approximately thirty people a day were crossing over to Fort Malden by steamboat. The &quot;Sultana&quot; was one of the ships, making &quot;frequent round trips&quot; between Great Lakes ports. Its captain, C.W. Appleby, a celebrated mariner, facilitated the conveyance of several fugitives from various Lake Erie ports to Fort Malden. Other fugitives at Fort Malden had been assisted by William Wells Brown, himself someone who had escaped slavery. He found employment on a Lake Erie steamer and transported numerous fugitives from Cleveland to Ontario by way of Buffalo or Detroit. &quot;It is well known,&quot; he tells us, &quot;that a great number of fugitives make their escape to Canada, by way of Cleaveland. &quot;[sic]&quot; ...The friends of the slave, knowing that I would transport them without charge, never failed to have a delegation when the boat arrived at Cleaveland. &quot;[sic]&quot; I have sometimes had four or five on board at one time.&quot;

Another important destination was Nova Scotia, which was first settled by Black Loyalists during the American Revolution and then by Black Refugees during the War of 1812 (&quot;see Black Nova Scotians&quot;). Important Black settlements also developed in other parts of British North America (now parts of Canada). These included Lower Canada (present-day Quebec) and Vancouver Island, where Governor James Douglas encouraged Black immigration because of his opposition to slavery. He also hoped a significant Black community would form a bulwark against those who wished to unite the island with the United States.

Upon arriving at their destinations, many freedom seekers were disappointed, as life in Canada was difficult. While not at risk from slave catchers due to being in a different country, racial discrimination was still widespread. Many of the new arrivals had to compete with mass European immigration for jobs, and overt racism was common. For example, in reaction to Black Loyalists being settled in eastern Canada by the Crown, the city of Saint John, New Brunswick, amended its charter in 1785 specifically to exclude Blacks from practicing a trade, selling goods, fishing in the harbor, or becoming freemen; these provisions stood until 1870.

With the outbreak of the Civil War in the U.S., many black refugees left Canada to enlist in the Union Army. While some later returned to Canada, many remained in the United States. Thousands of others returned to the American South after the war ended. The desire to reconnect with friends and family was strong, and most were hopeful about the changes emancipation and Reconstruction would bring.

===Folklore===
Since the 1980s, claims have arisen that quilt designs were used to signal and direct enslaved people to escape routes and assistance. According to advocates of the quilt theory, ten quilt patterns were used to direct enslaved people to take particular actions. The quilts were placed one at a time on a fence as a means of nonverbal communication to alert escaping slaves. The code had a dual meaning: first to signal enslaved people to prepare to escape, and second to give clues and indicate directions on the journey.

The quilt design theory is disputed. The first published work documenting an oral history source was in 1999, and the first publication of this theory is believed to be a 1980 children&#x27;s book. Quilt historians and scholars of pre-Civil War (1820–1860) America have disputed this legend. There is no contemporary evidence of any sort of quilt code, and quilt historians such as Pat Cummings and Barbara Brackman have raised serious questions about the idea. In addition, Underground Railroad historian Giles Wright has published a pamphlet debunking the quilt code.

Similarly, some popular, nonacademic sources claim that spirituals and other songs, such as &quot;Steal Away&quot; or &quot;Follow the Drinking Gourd&quot;, contained coded information and helped individuals navigate the railroad. They have offered little evidence to support their claims. Scholars tend to believe that while the slave songs may certainly have expressed hope for deliverance from the sorrows of this world, these songs did not present literal help for runaway slaves.

The Underground Railroad inspired cultural works. For example, &quot;Song of the Free&quot;, written in 1860 about a man fleeing slavery in Tennessee by escaping to Canada, was composed to the tune of &quot;Oh! Susanna&quot;. Every stanza ends with a reference to Canada as the land &quot;where colored men are free&quot;. Slavery in Upper Canada (now Ontario) was outlawed in 1793; in 1819, John Robinson, the Attorney General of Upper Canada, declared that by residing in Canada, black residents were set free, and that Canadian courts would protect their freedom. Slavery in Canada as a whole had been in rapid decline after an 1803 court ruling, and was finally abolished outright in 1834.

==National Underground Railroad Network==

Following upon legislation passed in 1990 for the National Park Service to perform a special resource study of the Underground Railroad, in 1997, the 105th Congress introduced and subsequently passed H.R. 1635 – National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act of 1998, which President Bill Clinton signed into law that year. This act authorized the United States National Park Service to establish the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program to identify associated sites, as well as preserve them and popularize the Underground Railroad and stories of people involved in it. The National Park Service has designated many sites within the network, posted stories about people and places, sponsors an essay contest, and holds a national conference about the Underground Railroad in May or June each year.

The Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park, which includes Underground Railroad routes in three counties of Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore and Harriet Tubman&#x27;s birthplace, was created by President Barack Obama under the Antiquities Act on March 25, 2013. Its sister park, the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park in Auburn, New York, was established on January 10, 2017, and focuses on the later years of Tubman&#x27;s life as well as her involvement with the Underground Railroad and the abolition movement.

==International Underground Railroad Month==

The month of September was designated International Underground Railroad Month, because September was the month Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass escaped from slavery.

<doc id="32191" wikidata="Q221689" url="?curid=32191" title="Patriot Act">
<text>The USA PATRIOT Act (commonly known as the Patriot Act) was a landmark Act of the United States Congress, signed into law by President George W. Bush. The formal name of the statute is the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001, and the commonly used short name is a contrived acronym that is embedded in the name set forth in the statute.

The Patriot Act was enacted following the September 11 attacks and the 2001 anthrax attacks with the stated goal of tightening U.S. national security, particularly as it related to foreign terrorism. In general, the act included three main provisions:

* Expanded surveillance abilities of law enforcement, including by tapping domestic and international phones;
* Easier interagency communication to allow federal agencies to more effectively use all available resources in counterterrorism efforts; and
* Increased penalties for terrorism crimes and an expanded list of activities which would qualify for terrorism charges.

The law is extremely controversial due to its authorization of indefinite detention without trial of immigrants, and due to the permission given to law enforcement to search property and records without the owner&#x27;s consent or knowledge. Since its passage, several legal challenges have been brought against the act, and federal courts have ruled that a number of provisions are unconstitutional.

It contains many sunset provisions beginning December 31, 2005, approximately four years after its passage. Before the sunset date, an extension was passed for four years which kept most of the law intact. In May 2011, President Barack Obama signed the PATRIOT Sunset Extensions Act of 2011, which extended three provisions. These provisions were modified and extended until 2019 by the USA Freedom Act, passed in 2015. In 2020, efforts to extend the provisions were not passed by the House of Representatives, and as such, the law has expired.

== History ==

The Patriot Act was enacted in direct response to the September 11 attacks on the United States, and the 2001 anthrax attacks, with the stated goal of dramatically strengthening national security. On October 23, 2001, U.S. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) introduced House bill H.R. 3162, which incorporated provisions from a previously-sponsored House bill, and a Senate bill introduced earlier in the month. The next day, October 24, the Act passed the House by a vote of 357–66, with Democrats comprising the overwhelming majority of &quot;no&quot;-votes. The three Republicans voting &quot;no&quot; were Robert Ney of Ohio, Butch Otter of Idaho, and Ron Paul of Texas. On October 25, the Act passed the Senate with a vote of 98–1. Russ Feingold (D-WI) voted &quot;no&quot;. On October 26, then US President George Bush signed the Patriot Act into law.

Opponents of the law have criticized its provision for indefinite detention of immigrants; permission to law enforcement to search a home or business without the owner&#x27;s or the occupant&#x27;s consent or knowledge under certain circumstances; the expanded use of National Security Letters, which allows the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to search telephone, email, and financial records without a court order; and the expanded access of law enforcement agencies to business records, including library and financial records. Since its passage, several court challenges have been brought against the act, and federal courts have ruled that a number of provisions are unconstitutional.

Many of the act&#x27;s provisions were set to expire on December 31, 2005, approximately four years after its enactment. In the months preceding the sunset date, supporters of the act pushed to make those provisions permanent, while critics sought to revise various sections to enhance civil liberties protections. In July 2005, the U.S. Senate passed a reauthorization bill with substantial changes to several of the act&#x27;s sections, while the House reauthorization bill kept most of the act&#x27;s original language. The two bills were then reconciled in a conference committee criticized by senators from both the Republican and Democratic parties for ignoring civil liberty concerns.

The bill, which removed most of the changes from the Senate version, passed Congress on March 2, 2006, and was signed by President Bush on March 9 and 10 of that year.

On May 11, 2012, President Barack Obama signed the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, a four-year extension of three key provisions in the Act: roving wiretaps, searches of business records, and conducting surveillance of &quot;lone wolves&quot; (individuals suspected of terrorist-related activities not linked to terrorist groups).

After reauthorization bills failed to pass Congress, parts of the Patriot Act expired on June 1, 2015. The USA Freedom Act, which became law on June 2, 2015, reenacted these expired sections through 2019. However, Section 215 of the law was amended to disallow the National Security Agency (NSA) to continue its mass phone data collection program. Instead, phone companies will retain the data and the NSA can obtain information about targeted individuals with a federal search warrant.

In November 2019, the renewal of the Patriot Act was included in the stop-gap government funding bill. The expired provisions required renewal by March 15, 2020. The Senate passed a 77-day extension in March 2020, but the House of Representatives did not pass the legislation before departing for recess on March 27, 2020. Instead, the Patriot Act was split into two measures as a means of explaining to the public that the Patriot Act would no longer openly be in effect.

==Legislative history==
Final House vote:
Final Senate vote:
== Titles ==
=== Title I: Enhancing domestic security against terrorism ===

Title I of the Patriot Act authorizes measures to enhance the ability of domestic security services to prevent terrorism. The title established a fund for counter-terrorist activities and increased funding for the Terrorist Screening Center which is administered by the FBI. The military was authorized to provide assistance in some situations that involve weapons of mass destruction when so requested by the Attorney General. The National Electronic Crime Task Force was expanded, along with the President&#x27;s authority and abilities in cases of terrorism. The title also condemned the discrimination against Arab and Muslim Americans that happened soon after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The impetus for many of the provisions came from earlier bills, for instance the condemnation of discrimination was originally proposed by Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) in an amendment to the &quot;Combatting Terrorism Act of 2001&quot;, though in a different form. It originally included &quot;the prayer of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the Archbishop of Washington in a Mass on September 12, 2001 for our Nation and the victims in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist hijackings and attacks in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania reminds all Americans that &#x27;We must seek the guilty and not strike out against the innocent or we become like them who are without moral guidance or proper direction.&#x27;&quot; Further condemnation of racial vilification and violence is also spelled out in Title X, where there was condemnation of such activities against Sikh Americans, who were mistaken for Muslims after the September 11 terrorist attack.

=== Title II: Enhanced surveillance procedures ===

Title II is titled &quot;Enhanced Surveillance Procedures&quot; and covers all aspects of the surveillance of suspected terrorists, those suspected of engaging in computer fraud or abuse, and agents of a foreign power who are engaged in clandestine activities. It primarily made amendments to FISA and the ECPA; furthermore, many of the most controversial aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act reside in this title. In particular, the title allows government agencies to gather &quot;foreign intelligence information&quot; from both U.S. and non-U.S. citizens and changed FISA to make gaining foreign intelligence information the significant purpose of FISA-based surveillance, where previously it had been the primary purpose. The change in definition was meant to remove a legal &quot;wall&quot; between criminal investigations and surveillance for the purposes of gathering foreign intelligence, which hampered investigations when criminal and foreign surveillance overlapped. However, that this wall even existed was found by the Federal Surveillance Court of Review to have actually been a long-held misinterpretation by government agencies. Also removed was the statutory requirement that the government prove a surveillance target under FISA is a non-U.S. citizen and agent of a foreign power, though it did require that any investigations must not be undertaken on citizens who are carrying out activities protected by the First Amendment. The title also expanded the duration of FISA physical search and surveillance orders, and gave authorities the ability to share information gathered before a federal grand jury with other agencies.

The scope and availability of wiretapping and surveillance orders were expanded under Title II. Wiretaps were expanded to include addressing and routing information to allow surveillance of packet switched networks—the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) objected to this, arguing that it does not take into account email or web addresses, which often contain content in the address information. The Act allowed any district court judge in the United States to issue such surveillance orders and search warrants for terrorism investigations. Search warrants were also expanded, with the Act amending Title III of the &quot;Stored Communications Access Act&quot; to allow the FBI to gain access to stored voicemail through a search warrant, rather than through the more stringent wiretap laws.

Various provisions allowed for the disclosure of electronic communications to law enforcement agencies. Those who operate or own a &quot;protected computer&quot; can give permission for authorities to intercept communications carried out on the machine, thus bypassing the requirements of the Wiretap statute. The definition of a &quot;protected computer&quot; is defined in and broadly encompasses those computers used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including ones located outside the United States. The law governing obligatory and voluntary disclosure of customer communications by cable companies was altered to allow agencies to demand such communications under U.S.C. Title 18 provisions relating to the disclosure of electronic communications (chapter 119), pen registers and trap and trace devices (chapter 206) and stored communications (121), though it excluded the disclosure of cable subscriber viewing habits. Subpoenas issued to Internet Service Providers were expanded to include not only &quot;the name, address, local and long distance telephone toll billing records, telephone number or other subscriber number or identity, and length of service of a subscriber&quot; but also session times and durations, types of services used, communication device address information (e.g. IP addresses), payment method and bank account and credit card numbers. Communication providers are also allowed to disclose customer records or communications if they suspect there is a danger to &quot;life and limb&quot;.

Title II established three very controversial provisions: &quot;sneak and peek&quot; warrants, roving wiretaps and the ability of the FBI to gain access to documents that reveal the patterns of U.S. citizens. The so-called &quot;sneak and peek&quot; law allowed for delayed notification of the execution of search warrants. The period before which the FBI must notify the recipients of the order was unspecified in the Act—the FBI field manual says that it is a &quot;flexible standard&quot;—and it may be extended at the court&#x27;s discretion. These sneak and peek provisions were struck down by judge Ann Aiken on September 26, 2007, after a Portland attorney, Brandon Mayfield, was wrongly jailed because of the searches. The court found the searches to violate the provision that prohibits unreasonable searches in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Roving wiretaps are wiretap orders that do not need to specify all common carriers and third parties in a surveillance court order. These are seen as important by the Department of Justice because they believe that terrorists can exploit wiretap orders by rapidly changing locations and communication devices such as cell phones, while opponents see it as violating the particularity clause of the Fourth Amendment. Another highly controversial provision is one that allows the FBI to make an order &quot;requiring the production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other items) for an investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities, provided that such investigation of a United States person is not conducted solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution.&quot; Though it was not targeted directly at libraries, the American Library Association (ALA), in particular, opposed this provision. In a resolution passed on June 29, 2005, they stated that &quot;Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows the government to secretly request and obtain library records for large numbers of individuals without any reason to believe they are involved in illegal activity.&quot;

The title also covers a number of other miscellaneous provisions, including the expansion of the number of FISC judges from seven to eleven (three of which must reside within of the District of Columbia), trade Sanctions against North Korea and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and the employment of translators by the FBI.

At the insistence of Republican Representative Richard Armey, the Act had a number of sunset provisions built in, which were originally set to expire on December 31, 2005. The sunset provision of the Act also took into account any ongoing foreign intelligence investigations and allowed them to continue once the sections had expired.
The provisions that were to expire are below.

=== Title III: Anti-money-laundering to prevent terrorism ===

Title III of the Act, titled &quot;International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001,&quot; is intended to facilitate the prevention, detection, and prosecution of international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It primarily amends portions of the &quot;Money Laundering Control Act of 1986&quot; (MLCA) and the &quot;Bank Secrecy Act of 1970&quot; (BSA). It was divided into three subtitles. The first subtitle deals primarily with strengthening banking rules against money laundering, especially on the international stage. The second subtitle attempts to improve communication between law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as expanding recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The third subtitle deals with currency smuggling and counterfeiting, including quadrupling the maximum penalty for counterfeiting foreign currency.

The first subtitle also tightened the recordkeeping requirements for financial institutions, making them record the aggregate amounts of transactions processed from areas of the world where money laundering is a concern to the U.S. government. It even made institutions put into place reasonable steps to identify beneficial owners of bank accounts and those who are authorized to use or route funds through payable-through accounts.
The U.S. Department of Treasury was charged with formulating regulations intended to foster information sharing between financial institutions to prevent money-laundering.
Along with expanding record keeping requirements, it put new regulations into place to make it easier for authorities to identify money laundering activities and to make it harder for money launderers to mask their identities.
If money laundering was uncovered, the subtitle legislated for the forfeiture of assets of those suspected of doing the money laundering.
In an effort to encourage institutions to take steps that would reduce money laundering, the Treasury was given authority to block mergers of bank holding companies and banks with other banks and bank holding companies that had a bad history of preventing money laundering. Similarly, mergers between insured depository institutions and non-insured depository institutions that have a bad track record in combating money-laundering could be blocked.

Restrictions were placed on accounts and foreign banks. It prohibited shell banks that are not an affiliate of a bank that has a physical presence in the U.S. or that are not subject to supervision by a banking authority in a non-U.S. country. It also prohibits or restricts the use of certain accounts held at financial institutions.
Financial institutions must now undertake steps to identify the owners of any privately owned bank outside the U.S. who have a correspondent account with them, along with the interests of each of the owners in the bank. It is expected that additional scrutiny will be applied by the U.S. institution to such banks to make sure they are not engaging in money laundering. Banks must identify all the nominal and beneficial owners of any private bank account opened and maintained in the U.S. by non-U.S. citizens. There is also an expectation that they must undertake enhanced scrutiny of the account if it is owned by, or is being maintained on behalf of, any senior political figure where there is reasonable suspicion of corruption.
Any deposits made from within the U.S. into foreign banks are now deemed to have been deposited into any interbank account the foreign bank may have in the U.S. Thus any restraining order, seizure warrant or arrest warrant may be made against the funds in the interbank account held at a U.S. financial institution, up to the amount deposited in the account at the foreign bank.
Restrictions were placed on the use of internal bank concentration accounts because such accounts do not provide an effective audit trail for transactions, and this may be used to facilitate money laundering. Financial institutions are prohibited from allowing clients to specifically direct them to move funds into, out of, or through a concentration account, and they are also prohibited from informing their clients about the existence of such accounts. Financial institutions are not allowed to provide any information to clients that may identify such internal accounts.
Financial institutions are required to document and follow methods of identifying where the funds are for each customer in a concentration account that co-mingles funds belonging to one or more customers.

The definition of money laundering was expanded to include making a financial transaction in the U.S. in order to commit a violent crime; the bribery of public officials and fraudulent dealing with public funds; the smuggling or illegal export of controlled munition and the importation or bringing in of any firearm or ammunition not authorized by the U.S. Attorney General and the smuggling of any item controlled under the Export Administration Regulations.
It also includes any offense where the U.S. would be obligated under a mutual treaty with a foreign nation to extradite a person, or where the U.S. would need to submit a case against a person for prosecution because of the treaty; the import of falsely classified goods; computer crime; and any felony violation of the &quot;Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938&quot;.
It also allows the forfeiture of any property within the jurisdiction of the United States that was gained as the result of an offense against a foreign nation that involves the manufacture, importation, sale, or distribution of a controlled substance.
Foreign nations may now seek to have a forfeiture or judgment notification enforced by a district court of the United States.
This is done through new legislation that specifies how the U.S. government may apply for a restraining order to preserve the availability of property which is subject to a foreign forfeiture or confiscation judgement.
In taking into consideration such an application, emphasis is placed on the ability of a foreign court to follow due process. The Act also requires the Secretary of Treasury to take all reasonable steps to encourage foreign governments make it a requirement to include the name of the originator in wire transfer instructions sent to the United States and other countries, with the information to remain with the transfer from its origination until the point of disbursement.
The Secretary was also ordered to encourage international cooperation in investigations of money laundering, financial crimes, and the finances of terrorist groups.

The Act also introduced criminal penalties for corrupt officialdom. An official or employee of the government who acts corruptly—as well as the person who induces the corrupt act—in the carrying out of their official duties will be fined by an amount that is not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the bribe in question. Alternatively they may be imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or they may be fined and imprisoned. Penalties apply to financial institutions who do not comply with an order to terminate any corresponding accounts within 10 days of being so ordered by the Attorney General or the Secretary of Treasury. The financial institution can be fined $US10,000 for each day the account remains open after the 10-day limit has expired.

The second annotation made a number of modifications to the BSA in an attempt to make it harder for money launderers to operate and easier for law enforcement and regulatory agencies to police money laundering operations. One amendment made to the BSA was to allow the designated officer or agency who receives suspicious activity reports to notify U.S. intelligence agencies.
A number of amendments were made to address issues related to record keeping and financial reporting. One measure was a new requirement that anyone who does business file a report for any coin and foreign currency receipts that are over US$10,000 and made it illegal to structure transactions in a manner that evades the BSA&#x27;s reporting requirements.
To make it easier for authorities to regulate and investigate anti-money laundering operations Money Services Businesses (MSBs)—those who operate informal value transfer systems outside of the mainstream financial system—were included in the definition of a financial institution. The BSA was amended to make it mandatory to report suspicious transactions and an attempt was made to make such reporting easier for financial institutions.
FinCEN was made a bureau of the United States Department of Treasury and the creation of a secure network to be used by financial institutions to report suspicious transactions and to provide alerts of relevant suspicious activities was ordered. Along with these reporting requirements, a considerable number of provisions relate to the prevention and prosecution of money-laundering. Financial institutions were ordered to establish anti-money laundering programs and the BSA was amended to better define anti-money laundering strategy. Also increased were civil and criminal penalties for money laundering and the introduction of penalties for violations of geographic targeting orders and certain record-keeping requirements. A number of other amendments to the BSA were made through subtitle B, including granting the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System power to authorize personnel to act as law enforcement officers to protect the premises, grounds, property and personnel of any U.S. National reserve bank and allowing the Board to delegate this authority to U.S. Federal reserve bank. Another measure instructed United States Executive Directors of international financial institutions to use their voice and vote to support any country that has taken action to support the U.S.&#x27;s War on Terrorism. Executive Directors are now required to provide ongoing auditing of disbursements made from their institutions to ensure that no funds are paid to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism.

The third subtitle deals with currency crimes. Largely because of the effectiveness of the BSA, money launders had been avoiding traditional financial institutions to launder money and were using cash-based businesses to avoid them. A new effort was made to stop the laundering of money through bulk currency movements, mainly focusing on the confiscation of criminal proceeds and the increase in penalties for money laundering. Congress found that a criminal offense of merely evading the reporting of money transfers was insufficient and decided that it would be better if the smuggling of the bulk currency itself was the offense. Therefore, the BSA was amended to make it a criminal offense to evade currency reporting by concealing more than US$10,000 on any person or through any luggage, merchandise or other container that moves into or out of the U.S. The penalty for such an offense is up to 5 years&#x27; imprisonment and the forfeiture of any property up to the amount that was being smuggled. It also made the civil and criminal penalty violations of currency reporting cases be the forfeiture of all a defendant&#x27;s property that was involved in the offense, and any property traceable to the defendant. The Act prohibits and penalizes those who run unlicensed money transmitting businesses. In 2005, this provision of the USA PATRIOT Act was used to prosecute Yehuda Abraham for helping to arrange money transfers for British arms dealer Hemant Lakhani, who was arrested in August 2003 after being caught in a government sting. Lakhani had tried to sell a missile to an FBI agent posing as a Somali militant. The definition of counterfeiting was expanded to encompass analog, digital or electronic image reproductions, and it was made an offense to own such a reproduction device. Penalties were increased to 20 years&#x27; imprisonment. Money laundering &quot;unlawful activities&quot; was expanded to include the provision of material support or resources to designated foreign terrorist organizations. The Act specifies that anyone who commits or conspires to undertake a fraudulent activity outside the jurisdiction of the United States, and which would be an offense in the U.S., will be prosecuted under , which deals with fraud and related activity in connection with access devices.

=== Title IV: Border security ===

Title IV of the Patriot Act amends the &quot;Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952&quot; to give more law enforcement and investigative power to the U.S. Attorney General and to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The Attorney General was authorized to waive any cap on the number of full-time employees (FTEs) assigned to the INS on the Northern border of the United States. Enough funds were set aside to triple the maximum number of U.S. Border Patrol personnel, Customs Service personnel and INS inspectors along with an additional US$50,000,000 funding for the INS and the U.S. Customs Service to improve technology for monitoring the Northern Border and acquiring additional equipment at the Canadian northern border. The INS was also given the authority to authorize overtime payments of up to an extra US$30,000 a year to INS employees. Access was given to the U.S. State Department and the INS to criminal background information contained in the National Crime Information Center&#x27;s Interstate Identification Index (NCIC-III), Wanted Persons File and any other files maintained by the National Crime Information Center to determine whether visa applicants and applicants could be admitted to the U.S. The U.S. Department of State was required to form final regulations governing the procedures for taking fingerprints and the conditions with which the department was allowed to use this information. Additionally, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was ordered to develop a technology standard to verify the identity of persons applying for a United States visa. The reason was to make the standard the technology basis for a cross-agency, the cross-platform electronic system used for conducting background checks, confirming identities and ensuring that people have not received visas under different names. This report was released on November 13, 2002; however, according to NIST, this was later &quot;determined that the fingerprint system used was not as accurate as current state-of-the-art fingerprint systems and is approximately equivalent to commercial fingerprint systems available in 1998.&quot; This report was later superseded by section 303(a) of the &quot;Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002&quot;.

Under Subtitle B, various definitions relating to terrorism were altered and expanded. The INA was retroactively amended to disallow aliens who are part of or representatives of a foreign organization or any group who endorses acts of terrorism from entering the U.S. This restriction also included the family of such aliens. The definition of &quot;terrorist activity&quot; was strengthened to include actions involving the use of any dangerous device (and not just explosives and firearms). To &quot;engage in terrorist activity&quot; is defined as committing, inciting to commit or planning and preparing to undertake an act of terrorism. Included in this definition is the gathering of intelligence information on potential terrorist targets, the solicitation of funds for a terrorist organization or the solicitation of others to undertake acts of terrorism. Those who provide knowing assistance to a person who is planning to perform such activities are defined as undertaking terrorist activities. Such assistance includes affording material support, including a safe house, transportation, communications, funds, transfer of funds or other material financial benefit, false documentation or identification, weapons (including chemical, biological, or radiological weapons), explosives, or training to perform the terrorist act. The INA criteria for making a decision to designate an organization as a terrorist organization was amended to include the definition of a terrorist act. Though the amendments to these definitions are retroactive, it does not mean that it can be applied to members who joined an organization, but since left, before it was designated to be a terrorist organization under by the Secretary of State.

The Act amended the INA to add new provisions enforcing mandatory detention laws. These apply to any alien who is engaged in terrorism, or who is engaged in an activity that endangers U.S. national security. It also applies to those who are inadmissible or who must be deported because it is certified they are attempting to enter to undertake illegal espionage; are exporting goods, technology, or sensitive information illegally; or are attempting to control or overthrow the government; or have, or will have, engaged in terrorist activities. The Attorney General or the Attorney General&#x27;s deputy may maintain custody of such aliens until they are removed from the U.S. unless it is no longer deemed they should be removed, in which case they are released. The alien can be detained for up to 90 days but can be held up to six months after it is deemed that they are a national security threat. However, the alien must be charged with a crime or removal proceedings start no longer than seven days after the alien&#x27;s detention, otherwise the alien will be released. However, such detentions must be reviewed every six months by the Attorney General, who can then decide to revoke it, unless prevented from doing so by law. Every six months the alien may apply, in writing, for the certification to be reconsidered. Judicial review of any action or decision relating to this section, including judicial review of the merits of a certification, can be held under habeas corpus proceedings. Such proceedings can be initiated by an application filed with the United States Supreme Court, by any justice of the Supreme Court, by any circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, or by any district court otherwise having jurisdiction to entertain the application. The final order is subject to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Provisions were also made for a report to be required every six months of such decisions from the U.S. Attorney General to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate.

A sense of Congress was given that the U.S. Secretary of State should expedite the full implementation of the integrated entry and exit data system for airports, seaports, and land border ports of entry specified in the &quot;Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996&quot; (IIRIRA). They also found that the U.S. Attorney General should immediately start the Integrated Entry and Exit Data System Task Force specified in section 3 of the &quot;Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000&quot;. Congress wanted the primary focus of development of the entry-exit data system was to be on the utilization of biometric technology and the development of tamper-resistant documents readable at ports of entry. They also wanted the system to be able to interface with existing law enforcement databases. The Attorney General was ordered to implement and expand the foreign student monitoring program that was established under section 641(a) of the IIRIRA. which records the date and port of entry of each foreign student. The program was expanded to include other approved educational institutions, including air flight schools, language training schools or vocational schools that are approved by the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of State. US$36,800,000 was appropriated for the Department of Justice to spend on implementing the program.

The Secretary of State was ordered to audit and report back to Congress on the Visa waiver program specified under for each fiscal year until September 30, 2007. The Secretary was also ordered to check for the implementation of precautionary measures to prevent the counterfeiting and theft of passports as well as ascertain that countries designated under the visa waiver program have established a program to develop tamper-resistant passports. The Secretary was also ordered to report back to Congress on whether consulate shopping was a problem.

The last subtitle, which was introduced by Senators John Conyers and Patrick Leahy, allows for the preservation of immigration benefits for victims of terrorism, and the families of victims of terrorism. They recognized that some families, through no fault of their own, would either be ineligible for permanent residence in the United States because of being unable to make important deadlines because of the September 11 terrorist attacks, or had become ineligible to apply for special immigration status because their loved one died in the attacks.

=== Title V: Removing obstacles to investigating terrorism ===
Title V allows the U.S. Attorney General to pay rewards pursuant of advertisements for assistance to the Department of Justice to combat terrorism and prevent terrorist acts, though amounts over $US250,000 may not be made or offered without the personal approval of the Attorney General or President, and once the award is approved the Attorney General must give written notice to the Chairman and ranking minority members of the Committee on Appropriations and the Judiciary of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. The &quot;State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956&quot; was amended to allow the U.S. State Department to offer rewards, in consultation with the Attorney General, for the full or significant dismantling of any terrorist organization and to identify any key leaders of terrorist organizations. The U.S. Secretary of State was given authority to pay greater than $US5 million if he so determines it would prevent terrorist actions against the United States and Canada. The &quot;DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act&quot; was amended to include terrorism or crimes of violence in the list of qualifying Federal offenses. Another perceived obstacle was to allow federal agencies to share information with federal law enforcement agencies. Thus, the act now allows federal officers who acquire information through electronic surveillance or physical searches to consult with federal law enforcement officers to coordinate efforts to investigate or protect against potential or actual attacks, sabotage or international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power.

U.S. Secret Service jurisdiction was extended to investigate computer fraud, access device frauds, false identification documents or devices, or any fraudulent activities against U.S. financial institutions. The &quot;General Education Provisions Act&quot; was amended to allow the U.S. Attorney General or Assistant Attorney General to collect and retain educational records relevant to an authorized investigation or prosecution of an offense that is defined as a Federal crime of terrorism and which an educational agency or institution possesses. The Attorney General or Assistant Attorney General must &quot;certify that there are specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe that the education records are likely to contain information [that a Federal crime of terrorism may be being committed].&quot; An education institution that produces education records in response to such a request is given legal immunity from any liability that rises from such a production of records.

One of the most controversial aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act is in Title V, and relates to National Security Letters (NSLs). An NSL is a form of administrative subpoena used by the FBI, and reportedly by other U.S. government agencies including the CIA and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). It is a demand letter issued to a particular entity or organization to turn over various records and data pertaining to individuals. They require no probable cause or judicial oversight and also contain a gag order, preventing the recipient of the letter from disclosing that the letter was ever issued. Title V allowed the use of NSLs to be made by a Special Agent in charge of a Bureau field office, where previously only the director or the deputy assistant director of the FBI were able to certify such requests. This provision of the Act was challenged by the ACLU on behalf of an unknown party against the U.S. government on the grounds that NSLs violate the First and Fourth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution because there is no way to legally oppose an NSL subpoena in court, and that it was unconstitutional not to allow a client to inform their Attorney as to the order because of the gag provision of the letters. The court&#x27;s judgement found in favour of the ACLU&#x27;s case, and they declared the law unconstitutional. Later, the USA PATRIOT Act was reauthorized and amendments were made to specify a process of judicial review of NSLs and to allow the recipient of an NSL to disclose receipt of the letter to an attorney or others necessary to comply with or challenge the order.
However, in 2007, the U.S. District Court struck down even the reauthorized NSLs because the gag power was unconstitutional as courts could still not engage in a meaningful judicial review of these gags. On August 28, 2015, Judge Victor Marrero of the federal district court in Manhattan ruled the gag order of Nicholas Merrill was unjustified. In his decision, Judge Marrero described the FBI&#x27;s position as, &quot;extreme and overly broad,&quot; affirming that &quot;courts cannot, consistent with the First Amendment, simply accept the Government&#x27;s assertions that disclosure would implicate and create a risk.&quot; He also found that the FBI&#x27;s gag order on Mr. Merrill &quot;implicates serious issues, both with respect to the First Amendment and accountability of the government to the people.&quot; Initially, the ruling was released in redaction by Judge Marrero. The FBI was given 90 days to pursue any other alternative course of action but elected not to do so. Upon release of the unredacted ruling on November 30, 2015, it was revealed for the first time the extent to which the FBI&#x27;s NSL accompanied by a gag order sought to collect information. Through the court documents, it was revealed for the first time that through an NSL, the FBI believes it can legally obtain information including an individual&#x27;s complete web browsing history, the IP addresses of everyone a person has corresponded with, and all the records of all online purchases within the last 180 days. The FBI also claims via the extension of an NSL, it can obtain cell site location information. In the landmark case of Nicholas Merrill the FBI in specific sought to seek the following information on an account: DSL account information, radius log, subscriber name and related subscriber information, account number, date the account opened or closed, addresses associated with the account, subscriber day/evening telephone numbers, screen names or other on-line names associated with the account, order forms, records relating to merchandise orders/shipping information for the last 180 days, all billing related to the account, internet service provider (ISP), all email addresses associated with the account, internet protocol address assigned to the account, all website information registered to the account, uniform resource locator address assigned to the account, any other information which you consider to be an electronic communication transactional record. This was the first time it was revealed the extent to which an NSL under the Patriot Act could request communication information.

=== Title VI: Victims and families of victims of terrorism ===

Title VI amended the &quot;Victims of Crime Act of 1984&quot; (VOCA) to change how the U.S. Victims of Crime Fund was managed and funded, improving the speedy provision of aid to families of public safety officers by expedited payments to officers or the families of officers injured or killed in the line of duty. Payments must be made no later than 30 days later. The Assistant Attorney General was given expanded authority under Section 614 of the USA PATRIOT Act to make grants to any organization that administers any Office of Justice Programs, which includes the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program. Further changes to the Victims of Crime Fund increased the amount of money in the Fund and changed the way that funds were distributed. The amount available for grants made through the Crime Victim Fund to eligible crime victim compensation programs were increased from 40 percent to 60 percent of the total in the Fund. A program can provide compensation to U.S. citizens who were adversely affected overseas. Means testing was also waived for those who apply for compensation. Under VOCA, the director may make an annual grant from the Crime Victims Fund to support crime victim assistance programs. An amendment was made to VOCA to include offers of assistance to crime victims in Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or any other U.S. territory. VOCA also provides for compensation and assistance to victims of terrorism or mass violence. This was amended to allow the director to make supplemental grants to States for eligible crime victim compensation and assistance programs, and to victim service organizations, public agencies (including Federal, State, or local governments) and non-governmental organizations that provide assistance to victims of crime. The funds could be used to provide emergency relief, including crisis response efforts, assistance, compensation, training and technical assistance for investigations and prosecutions of terrorism.

=== Title VII: Increased information sharing for critical infrastructure protection ===

Title VII has one section. The purpose of this title is to increase the ability of U.S. law enforcement to counter terrorist activity that crosses jurisdictional boundaries. It does this by amending the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include terrorism as a criminal activity.

=== Title VIII: Terrorism criminal law ===

Title VIII alters the definitions of terrorism and establishes or re-defines rules with which to deal with it. It redefined the term &quot;domestic terrorism&quot; to broadly include mass destruction as well as assassination or kidnapping as a terrorist activity. The definition also encompasses activities that are &quot;dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State&quot; and are intended to &quot;intimidate or coerce a civilian population,&quot; &quot;influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion,&quot; or are undertaken &quot;to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping&quot; while in the jurisdiction of the United States.
Terrorism is also included in the definition of racketeering.
Terms relating to cyber-terrorism are also redefined, including the term &quot;protected computer,&quot; &quot;damage,&quot; &quot;conviction,&quot; &quot;person,&quot; and &quot;loss.&quot;

New penalties were created to convict those who attack mass transportation systems. If the offender committed such an attack while no passenger was on board, they are fined and imprisoned for a maximum of 20 years. However, if the activity was undertaken while the mass transportation vehicle or ferry was carrying a passenger at the time of the offense, or the offense resulted in the death of any person, then the punishment is a fine and life imprisonment.
The title amends the biological weapons statute to define the use of a biological agent, toxin, or delivery system as a weapon, other than when it is used for &quot;prophylactic, protective, bona fide research, or other peaceful purposes.&quot; Penalties for anyone who cannot prove reasonably that they are using a biological agent, toxin or delivery system for these purposes are 10 years&#x27; imprisonment, a fine or both.

A number of measures were introduced in an attempt to prevent and penalize activities that are deemed to support terrorism. It was made a crime to harbor or conceal terrorists, and those who do are subject to a fine or imprisonment of up to 10 years, or both.
U.S. forfeiture law was also amended to allow authorities to seize all foreign and domestic assets from any group or individual that is caught planning to commit acts of terrorism against the U.S. or U.S. citizens. Assets may also be seized if they have been acquired or maintained by an individual or organization for the purposes of further terrorist activities.
One section of the Act (section 805) prohibited &quot;material support&quot; for terrorists, and in particular included &quot;expert advice or assistance.&quot;
In 2004, after the Humanitarian Law Project filed a civil action against the U.S. government, a Federal District Court struck this down as unconstitutionally vague; but in 2010 the Supreme Court upheld it.
Congress later improved the law by defining the definitions of the &quot;material support or resources,&quot; &quot;training,&quot; and &quot;expert advise or resources.&quot;

Cyberterrorism was dealt with in various ways. Penalties apply to those who either damage or gain unauthorized access to a protected computer and then commit a number of offenses. These offenses include causing a person to lose an aggregate amount greater than US$5,000, as well as adversely affecting someone&#x27;s medical examination, diagnosis or treatment. It also encompasses actions that cause a person to be injured, a threat to public health or safety, or damage to a governmental computer that is used as a tool to administer justice, national defense or national security. Also prohibited was extortion undertaken via a protected computer. The penalty for attempting to damage protected computers through the use of viruses or other software mechanism was set to imprisonment for up to 10 years, while the penalty for unauthorized access and subsequent damage to a protected computer was increased to more than five years&#x27; imprisonment. However, should the offense occur a second time, the penalty increases up to 20 years&#x27; imprisonment.
The act also specified the development and support of cybersecurity forensic capabilities. It directs the Attorney General to establish regional computer forensic laboratories that have the capability of performing forensic examinations of intercepted computer evidence relating to criminal activity and cyberterrorism, and that have the capability of training and educating Federal, State, and local law enforcement personnel and prosecutors in computer crime, and to &quot;facilitate and promote the sharing of Federal law enforcement expertise and information about the investigation, analysis, and prosecution of computer-related crime with State and local law enforcement personnel and prosecutors, including the use of multijurisdictional task forces.&quot; The sum of $50,000,000 was authorized for establishing such labs.

=== Title IX: Improved intelligence ===

Title IX amends the &quot;National Security Act of 1947&quot; to require the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to establish requirements and priorities for foreign intelligence collected under FISA and to provide assistance to the U.S. Attorney General to ensure that information derived from electronic surveillance or physical searches is disseminated for efficient and effective foreign intelligence purposes. With the exception of information that might jeopardize an ongoing law enforcement investigation, it was made a requirement that the Attorney General, or the head of any other department or agency of the Federal Government with law enforcement responsibilities, disclose to the director any foreign intelligence acquired by the U.S. Department of Justice. The U.S. Attorney General and Director of Central Intelligence both were directed to develop procedures for the Attorney General to follow in order to inform the director, in a timely manner, of any intention of investigating criminal activity of a foreign intelligence source or potential foreign intelligence source based on the intelligence tip-off of a member of the intelligence community. The Attorney General was also directed to develop procedures on how to best administer these matters. International terrorist activities were made to fall within the scope of foreign intelligence under the &quot;National Security Act&quot;.

A number of reports were commissioned relating to various intelligence-related government centers. One was commissioned into the best way of setting up the National Virtual Translation Center, with the goal of developing automated translation facilities to assist with the timely and accurate translation of foreign intelligence information for elements of the U.S. intelligence community. The USA PATRIOT Act required this to be provided on February 1, 2002; however, the report, entitled &quot;Director of Central Intelligence Report on the National Virtual Translation Center: A Concept Plan to Enhance the Intelligence Community&#x27;s Foreign Language Capabilities, April 29, 2002&quot; was received more than two months late, which the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reported was &quot;a delay which, in addition to contravening the explicit words of the statute, deprived the Committee of timely and valuable input into its efforts to craft this legislation.&quot; Another report was commissioned on the feasibility and desirability of reconfiguring the Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury. It was due by February 1, 2002; however, it was never written. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence later complained that &quot;[t]he Director of Central Intelligence and the Secretary of the Treasury failed to provide a report, this time in direct contravention of a section of the USA PATRIOT Act&quot; and they further directed &quot;that the statutorily-directed report be completed immediately, and that it should include a section describing the circumstances which led to the Director&#x27;s failure to comply with lawful reporting requirements.&quot;

Other measures allowed certain reports on intelligence and intelligence-related matters to be deferred until at least February 1, 2002, if the official involved certified that preparation and submission on February 1, 2002, would impede the work of officers or employees engaged in counterterrorism activities. Any such deferral required congressional notification before it was authorized. The Attorney General was charged with training officials in identifying and utilizing foreign intelligence information properly in the course of their duties. The government officials include those in the Federal Government who do not normally encounter or disseminate foreign intelligence in the performance of their duties, and State and local government officials who encounter, or potentially may encounter in the course of a terrorist event, foreign intelligence in the performance of their duties. A sense of Congress was expressed that officers and employees of the intelligence community should be encouraged to make every effort to establish and maintain intelligence relationships with any person, entity, or group while they conduct lawful intelligence activities.

=== Title X: Miscellaneous ===
Title X created or altered a number of miscellaneous laws that did not fit into any other section of the USA PATRIOT Act. Hazmat licenses were limited to drivers who pass background checks and who can demonstrate they can handle the materials.
The Inspector General of the Department of Justice was directed to appoint an official to monitor, review and report back to Congress all allegations of civil rights abuses against the DoJ. It amended the definition of &quot;electronic surveillance&quot; to exclude the interception of communications done through or from a protected computer where the owner allows the interception, or is lawfully involved in an investigation.
Money laundering cases may now be brought in the district where the money laundering was committed or where a money laundering transfer started from.
Aliens who committed money laundering were also prohibited from entering the U.S.
Grants were provided to first responders to assist them in responding to and preventing terrorism. US$5,000,000 was authorized to be provided to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to train police in South and East Asia.
The Attorney General was directed to commission a study on the feasibility of using biometric identifiers to identify people as they attempt to enter the United States, and which would be connected to the FBI&#x27;s database to flag suspected criminals. Another study was also commissioned to determine the feasibility of providing airlines names of suspected terrorists before they boarded flights. The Department of Defense was given temporary authority to use their funding for private contracts for security purposes.
The last title also created a new Act called the &quot;Crimes Against Charitable Americans Act&quot; which amended the &quot;Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act&quot; to require telemarketers who call on behalf of charities to disclose the purpose and other information, including the name and mailing address of the charity the telemarketer is representing.
It also increased the penalties from one year&#x27;s imprisonment to five years&#x27; imprisonment for those committing fraud by impersonating a Red Cross member.

#FIXME LEGEND NEEDED

== Controversy ==
The USA PATRIOT Act has generated a great deal of controversy since its enactment.

Opponents of the Act have been quite vocal in asserting that it was passed opportunistically after the September 11 attacks, believing that there would have been little debate. They view the Act as one that was hurried through the Senate with little change before it was passed (senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Russ Feingold (D-WI) proposed amendments to modify the final revision).

The sheer magnitude of the Act itself was noted by Michael Moore in his controversial film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;. In one of the scenes of the movie, he records Congressperson Jim McDermott (D-WA) alleging that no Senator had read the bill and John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI) as saying, &quot;We don&#x27;t read most of the bills. Do you really know what that would entail if we read every bill that we passed?&quot; Congressperson Conyers answers his own question, saying that if they did read every bill, it would &quot;slow down the legislative process&quot;. As a dramatic device, Moore then hired an ice-cream van and drove around Washington, D.C., with a loudspeaker, reading out the Act to puzzled passers-by, including a few senators.

Moore was not the only commentator to notice that not many people had read the Act. When Dahlia Lithwick and Julia Turne for &quot;Slate&quot; asked, &quot;How bad is PATRIOT, anyway?&quot;, they decided that it was &quot;hard to tell&quot; and stated:

One prime example of how the Patriot Act has stirred controversy is the case of Susan Lindauer. Lindauer is a former Congressional staffer and antiwar activist who was charged under the Patriot Act with &quot;acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government,&quot; then ruled by a court mentally unfit to stand trial. Lindauer has emphatically denied both on many occasions, saying that she in fact had been a CIA agent serving as a link between the U.S. and Iraqi governments. In 2010 she wrote a book called &quot;Extreme Prejudice: The Terrifying Story of the Patriot Act and the Cover-Ups of 9/11 and Iraq&quot; to that effect. The charges were dropped in 2009.

Another example of controversy in the Patriot Act is the 2012 court case &quot;United States v. Antoine Jones&quot;. A nightclub owner was linked to a drug trafficking stash house via a law enforcement GPS tracking device attached to his car. It was placed there without a warrant, which caused a serious conviction obstacle for federal prosecutors in court. The case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court, where the conviction was overturned. The court found that increased monitoring of suspects caused by such legislation like the Patriot Act violated the defendant&#x27;s constitutional rights.

The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) has criticized the law as unconstitutional, especially when &quot;the private communications of law-abiding American citizens might be intercepted incidentally&quot;, while the Electronic Frontier Foundation held that the lower standard applied to wiretaps &quot;gives the FBI a &#x27;blank check&#x27; to violate the communications privacy of countless innocent Americans&quot;. Others do not find the roving wiretap legislation to be as concerning. Professor David D. Cole of the Georgetown University Law Center, a critic of many of the provisions of the Act, found that though they come at a cost to privacy are a sensible measure while Paul Rosenzweig, a Senior Legal Research Fellow in the Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at The Heritage Foundation, argues that roving wiretaps are just a response to rapidly changing communication technology that is not necessarily fixed to a specific location or device.

The Act also allows access to voicemail through a search warrant rather than through a title III wiretap order. James Dempsey, of the CDT, believes that it unnecessarily overlooks the importance of notice under the Fourth Amendment and under a Title III wiretap, and the EFF criticizes the provision&#x27;s lack of notice. However, the EFF&#x27;s criticism is more extensive—they believe that the amendment &quot;is in possible violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution&quot; because previously if the FBI listened to voicemail illegally, it could not use the messages in evidence against the defendant. Others disagree with these assessments. Legal Scholar Orin Kerr believes that the ECPA &quot;adopted a rather strange rule to regulate voicemail stored with service providers&quot; because &quot;under ECPA, if the government knew that there was one copy of an unopened private message in a person&#x27;s bedroom and another copy on their remotely stored voicemail, it was illegal for the FBI to simply obtain the voicemail; the law actually compelled the police to invade the home and rifle through people&#x27;s bedrooms so as not to disturb the more private voicemail.&quot; In Professor Kerr&#x27;s opinion, this made little sense and the amendment that was made by the USA PATRIOT Act was reasonable and sensible.

The Patriot Act&#x27;s expansion of court jurisdiction to allow the nationwide service of search warrants proved controversial for the EFF. They believe that agencies will be able to &quot;&#x27;shop&#x27; for judges that have demonstrated a strong bias toward law enforcement with regard to search warrants, using only those judges least likely to say no—even if the warrant doesn&#x27;t satisfy the strict requirements of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution&quot;, and that it reduces the likelihood that smaller ISPs or phone companies will try to protect the privacy of their clients by challenging the warrant in court—their reasoning is that &quot;a small San Francisco ISP served with such a warrant is unlikely to have the resources to appear before the New York court that issued it.&quot; They believe that this is bad because only the communications provider will be able to challenge the warrant as only they will know about it—many warrants are issued &quot;ex parte&quot;, which means that the target of the order is not present when the order is issued.

For a time, the USA PATRIOT Act allowed for agents to undertake &quot;sneak and peek&quot; searches.
Critics such as EPIC and the ACLU strongly criticized the law for violating the Fourth Amendment, with the ACLU going so far as to release an advertisement condemning it and calling for it to be repealed.

In 2004, FBI agents used this provision to search and secretly examine the home of Brandon Mayfield, who was wrongfully jailed for two weeks on suspicion of involvement in the Madrid train bombings. While the U.S. Government did publicly apologize to Mayfield and his family, Mayfield took it further through the courts. On September 26, 2007, Judge Ann Aiken found the law was, in fact, unconstitutional as the search was an unreasonable imposition on Mayfield and thus violated the Fourth Amendment.

Laws governing the material support of terrorism proved contentious. It was criticized by the EFF for infringement of freedom of association. The EFF argues that had this law been enacted during Apartheid, U.S. citizens would not have been able to support the African National Congress (ANC) as the EFF believes the ANC would have been classed as a terrorist organization. They also used the example of a humanitarian social worker being unable to train Hamas members how to care for civilian children orphaned in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, a lawyer being unable to teach IRA members about international law, and peace workers being unable to offer training in effective peace negotiations or how to petition the United Nations regarding human rights abuses.

Another group, the Humanitarian Law Project, also objected to the provision prohibiting &quot;expert advise and assistance&quot; to terrorists and filed a suit against the U.S. government to have it declared unconstitutional. In 2004 a Federal District Court struck the provision down as unconstitutionally vague, but in 2010 the Supreme Court reversed that decision.

Perhaps one of the biggest controversies involved the use of National Security Letters (NSLs) by the FBI. Because they allow the FBI to search telephone, email, and financial records without a court order, they were criticized by many parties, including the American Civil Liberties Union. Although FBI officials have a series of internal &quot;checks and balances&quot; that must be met before the issue of an NSL, Federal Judge Victor Marrero ruled the NSL provisions unconstitutional. In November 2005, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; reported that the FBI had issued tens of thousands of NSLs and had obtained one million financial, credit, employment, and in some cases, health records from the customers of targeted Las Vegas businesses. Selected businesses included casinos, storage warehouses and car rental agencies. An anonymous Justice official claimed that such requests were permitted under section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Act and despite the volume of requests insisted &quot;We are not inclined to ask courts to endorse fishing expeditions&quot;. Before this was revealed, however, the ACLU challenged the constitutionality of NSLs in court. In April 2004, they filed suit against the government on behalf of an unknown internet service provider who had been issued an NSL, for reasons unknown. In &quot;ACLU v. DoJ&quot;, the ACLU argued that the NSL violated the First and Fourth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution because the USA PATRIOT Act failed to spell out any legal process whereby a telephone or Internet company could try to oppose an NSL subpoena in court. The court agreed, and found that because the recipient of the subpoena could not challenge it in court it was unconstitutional. Congress later tried to remedy this in a reauthorization Act, but because they did not remove the non-disclosure provision a Federal court again found NSLs to be unconstitutional because they prevented courts from engaging in meaningful judicial review.
Another provision of the USA PATRIOT Act has caused a great deal of consternation among librarians. Section 215 allows the FBI to apply for an order to produce materials that assist in an investigation undertaken to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. Among the &quot;tangible things&quot; that could be targeted, it includes &quot;books, records, papers, documents, and other items&quot;.

Supporters of the provision point out that these records are held by third parties, and therefore are exempt from a citizen&#x27;s reasonable expectations of privacy and also maintain that the FBI has not abused the provision. As proof, then Attorney General John Ashcroft released information in 2003 that showed that section 215 orders had never been used.

However, the American Library Association strongly objected to the provision, believing that library records are fundamentally different from ordinary business records, and that the provision would have a chilling effect on free speech. The association became so concerned that it adopted a resolution condemning the USA PATRIOT Act and urging members to defend free speech and protect patrons&#x27; privacy.

The association urged librarians to seek legal advice before complying with a search order, and advised its members to keep records only for as long as was legally required. Consequently, reports started filtering in that librarians were shredding records to avoid having to comply with such orders.

In 2005, Library Connection, a nonprofit consortium of 27 libraries in Connecticut, known as the Connecticut Four worked with the ACLU to lift a gag order for library records, challenging the government&#x27;s power under Section 505 to silence four citizens who wished to contribute to public debate on the PATRIOT Act. This case became known as Doe v. Gonzales. In May 2006, the government finally gave up its legal battle to maintain the gag order. In a summary of the actions of the Connecticut Four and their challenge to the USA PATRIOT Act, Jones (2009: 223) notes: &quot;Librarians need to understand their country&#x27;s legal balance between the protection of freedom of expression and the protection of national security. Many librarians believe that the interests of national security, important as they are, have become an excuse for chilling the freedom to read.&quot;

Another controversial aspect of the USA PATRIOT Act is the immigration provisions that allow for the indefinite detention of any alien who the Attorney General believes may cause a terrorist act. Before the USA PATRIOT Act was passed, Anita Ramasastry, an associate professor of law and a director of the Shidler Center for Law, Commerce, &amp; Technology at the University of Washington School of Law in Seattle, Washington, accused the Act of depriving basic rights for immigrants to America, including legal permanent residents. She warned that &quot;Indefinite detention upon secret evidence—which the USA PATRIOT Act allows—sounds more like Taliban justice than ours. Our claim that we are attempting to build an international coalition against terrorism will be severely undermined if we pass legislation allowing even citizens of our allies to be incarcerated without basic U.S. guarantees of fairness and justice.&quot;
Many other parties have also been strongly critical of the provision. Russell Feingold, in a Senate floor statement, claimed that the provision &quot;falls short of meeting even basic constitutional standards of due process and fairness [as it] continues to allow the Attorney General to detain persons based on mere suspicion&quot;.
The University of California passed a resolution condemning (among other things) the indefinite detention provisions of the Act, while the ACLU has accused the Act of giving the Attorney General &quot;unprecedented new power to determine the fate of immigrants ... Worse, if the foreigner does not have a country that will accept them, they can be detained indefinitely without trial.&quot;

Another controversial aspect of the USA PATRIOT Act is its effect on the privacy of Canadians living in the province of British Columbia (B.C.). British Columbia&#x27;s privacy commissioner raises concerns that the USA PATRIOT Act will allow the United States government to access Canadians&#x27; private information, such as personal medical records, that are outsourced to American companies. Although the government of B.C. has taken measures to prevent United States authorities from obtaining information, the widespread powers of the USA PATRIOT Act could overcome legislation that is passed in Canada. B.C. Privacy Commissioner David Loukidelis stated in a report on the consequences of the USA PATRIOT Act, &quot;once information is sent across borders, it&#x27;s difficult, if not impossible, to control&quot;.

In an effort to maintain their privacy, British Columbia placed amendments on the &quot;Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act&quot; (FOIPPA), which was enacted as law on October 21, 2004. These amendments aim to place more firm limitations on &quot;storing, accessing, and disclosing of B.C. public sector data by service providers.&quot; These laws only pertain to public sector data and do not cover trans-border or private sector data in Canada. The public sector establishments include an estimated 2,000 &quot;government ministries, hospitals, boards of health, universities and colleges, school boards, municipal governments and certain Crown corporations and agencies.&quot; In response to these laws, many companies are now specifically opting to host their sensitive data outside the United States.

Legal action has been taken in Nova Scotia to protect the province from the USA PATRIOT Act&#x27;s data collecting methods. On November 15, 2007, the government of Nova Scotia passed legislation aimed to protect Nova Scotians&#x27; personal information from being brought forward by the USA PATRIOT Act. The act was entitled &quot;The new &quot;Personal Information International Disclosure Protection Act&quot;&quot;. The goal of the act is to establish requirements to protect personal information from being revealed, as well as punishments for failing to do so. Justice Minister Murray Scott stated, &quot;This legislation will help ensure that Nova Scotians&#x27; personal information will be protected. The act outlines the responsibilities of public bodies, municipalities and service providers and the consequences if these responsibilities are not fulfilled.&quot; In the 1980s, the Bank of Nova Scotia was the center of an early, pre-Internet data-access case that led to the disclosure of banking records.

After suspected abuses of the USA PATRIOT Act were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds. He released a statement saying &quot;While I believe the Patriot Act appropriately balanced national security concerns and civil rights, I have always worried about potential abuses.&quot; He added: &quot;Seizing phone records of millions of innocent people is excessive and un-American.&quot;

=== Sami Al-Arian ===

Sami Al-Arian was a Palestinian-American tenured computer engineering professor at the University of South Florida, who also actively promoted dialogue between the West and the Middle East, especially about the plight of Palestinians. He was indicted in February 2003 on 17 counts under the Patriot Act. A jury acquitted him on 8 counts and deadlocked on the remaining 9 counts. He later struck a plea bargain and admitted to one of the remaining charges in exchange for being released and deported by April 2007. However, instead of being released, he was held under house arrest in Northern Virginia from 2008 until 2014 when federal prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss charges against him. He was deported to Turkey on February 4, 2015.

== Reauthorizations ==
The USA PATRIOT Act was reauthorized by three bills. The first, the &quot;USA PATRIOT and Terrorism Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2005&quot;, was passed by Congress in July 2005. This bill reauthorized some, but not all, provisions of the original &quot;USA PATRIOT Act&quot;, as well as the newer &quot;Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004&quot;. It created new provisions relating to the death penalty for terrorists, enhancing security at seaports, new measures to combat the financing of terrorism, new powers for the Secret Service, anti-methamphetamine initiatives and a number of other miscellaneous provisions. The second reauthorization act, the &quot;USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006&quot;, amended the first and was passed in February 2006.

The first act reauthorized all but two Title II provisions. Two sections were changed to sunset on December 31, 2009: section 206—the roving wiretap provision—and section 215, which allowed access to business records under FISA. Section 215 was amended further to give greater judicial oversight and review. Such orders were also restricted to be authorized by only the FBI Director, the FBI Deputy Director, or the Executive Assistant Director for National Security, and minimization procedures were specified to limit the dissemination and collection of such information. Section 215 also had a &quot;gag&quot; provision, which was changed to allow the defendant to contact their attorney. However, the change meant that the defendant was also required to tell the FBI who they were disclosing the order to; this requirement was removed by the &quot;USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act&quot;.

On Saturday, February 27, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law legislation that would temporarily extend, for one year, three controversial provisions of the Patriot Act that had been set to expire:
* Authorize court-approved roving wiretaps that permit surveillance on multiple phones.
* Allow court-approved seizure of records and property in anti-terrorism operations.
* Permit surveillance against a so-called lone wolf (a non-U.S. citizen engaged in terrorism who may not be part of a recognized terrorist group).

In a vote on February 8, 2011, the House of Representatives considered a further extension of the Act through the end of 2011. House leadership moved the extension bill under suspension of the rules, which is intended for noncontroversial legislation and requires two-thirds majority to pass. After the vote, the extension bill did not pass; 277 members voted in favor, which was less than the 290 votes needed to pass the bill under suspension of the rules. Without an extension, the Act was set to expire on February 28, 2011. However, it eventually passed, 275–144. The FISA Sunsets Extension Act of 2011 was signed into law February 25, 2011.

On May 26, 2011, President Barack Obama used an Autopen to sign the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, a four-year extension of three key provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act while he was in France: roving wiretaps, searches of business records (the &quot;library records provision&quot;), and conducting surveillance of &quot;lone wolves&quot;—individuals suspected of terrorist-related activities not linked to terrorist groups. Republican leaders questioned if the use of the Autopen met the constitutional requirements for signing a bill into law.

As NSL provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act had been struck by the courts the reauthorization Act amended the law in an attempt to make them lawful. It provided for judicial review and the legal right of a recipient to challenge the validity of the letter. The reauthorization act still allowed NSLs to be closed and all evidence to be presented &quot;in camera&quot; and &quot;ex parte&quot;. Gag provisions were maintained but were not automatic. They only occurred when the deputy assistant director of the FBI or a special agent in charge in a bureau field office certified that disclosure would result in &quot;a danger to the national security of the United States, interference with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interference with diplomatic relations, or danger to the life or physical safety of any person&quot;. However, should there be no non-disclosure order, the defendant can disclose the fact of the NSL to anyone who can render them assistance in carrying out the letter, or to an attorney for legal advice. Again, however, the recipient was ordered to inform the FBI of such a disclosure. Because of the concern over the chilling effects of such a requirement, the &quot;Additional Reauthorization Amendments Act&quot; removed the requirement to inform the FBI that the recipient spoke about the NSL to their Attorney. Later, the &quot;Additional Reauthorization Amendments Act&quot; excluded libraries from receiving NSLs, except where they provide electronic communications services. The reauthorization Act also ordered the Attorney General submit a report semi-annually to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on all NSL request made under the &quot;Fair Credit Reporting Act&quot;.

Changes were made to the roving wiretap provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. Applications and orders for such wiretaps must describe the specific target of the electronic surveillance if the identity of the target is not known. If the nature and location of each of the facilities or places targeted for surveillance is not known, then after 10 days the agency must provide notice to the court. The notice must include the nature and location of each new facility or place at which the electronic surveillance was directed. It must also describe the facts and circumstances relied upon by the applicant to justify the applicant&#x27;s belief that each new surveillance place or facility under surveillance is or was being used by the target of the surveillance. The applicant must also provide a statement detailing any proposed minimization procedures that differ from those contained in the original application or order, that may be necessitated by a change in the facility or place at which the electronic surveillance is directed. Applicants must detail the total number of electronic surveillances that have been or are being conducted under the authority of the order.

Section 213 of the USA PATRIOT Act was modified. Previously it stated that delayed notifications would be made to recipients of &quot;sneak and peek&quot; searches in a &quot;reasonable period&quot;. This was seen as unreasonable, as it was undefined and could potentially be used indefinitely. Thus, the reauthorization act changed this to a period not exceeding 30 days after the date of the execution of the search warrant. Courts were given the opportunity to extend this period if they were provided good cause to do so. Section 213 states that delayed notifications could be issued if there is &quot;reasonable cause to believe that providing immediate notification of the execution of the warrant may have an adverse result&quot;. This was criticized, particularly by the ACLU, for allowing potential abuse by law enforcement agencies and was later amended to prevent a delayed notification &quot;if the adverse results consist only of unduly delaying a trial&quot;. In September 2007 an Oregon US District Court struck down the Sneak and Peak provisions of the USA PATRIOT ACT, but in December 2009 the Ninth Circuit overturned this decision.

The reauthorization act also legislates increased congressional oversight for emergency disclosures by communication providers undertaken under section 212 of the USA PATRIOT Act. The duration of FISA surveillance and physical search orders were increased. Surveillance performed against &quot;lone wolf terrorists&quot; under section 207 of the USA PATRIOT Act were increased to 120 days for an initial order, while pen registers and trap and trace device extensions under FISA were increased from 90 days to a year. The reauthorization act also increased congressional oversight, requiring a semi-annual report into physical searches and the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices under FISA. The &quot;lone wolf terrorist&quot; provision (Section 207) was a sunset provision that also was to have expired; however, this was enhanced by the &quot;Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004&quot;. The reauthorization act extended the expiration date to December 31, 2009. The amendment to material support law done in the &quot;Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act&quot; was also made permanent. The definition of terrorism was further expanded to include receiving military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization and narcoterrorism. Other provisions of the reauthorization act was to merge the law outlawing train wrecking () and the law outlawing attacks on mass transportation systems () into a new section of Title 18 of the U.S. Code () and also to criminalize the act of planning a terrorist attack against a mass transport system. Forfeiture law was further changed and now assets within U.S. jurisdiction will be seized for illegally trafficking in nuclear, chemical, biological or radiological weapons technology or material, if such offense is punishable under foreign law by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. Alternatively, this applies if similar punishment would be so punishable if committed within the U.S. A sense of Congress was further expressed that victims of terrorism should be entitled to the forfeited assets of terrorists.

The Trump administration delivered a letter to Congress in August 2019 urging them to make permanent three surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act. The provisions included section 215, which enables domestic call-record collection as well as the collection of other types of business records.

In November 2019, the House approved a three-month extension of the Patriot Act which would have expired on December 15, 2019. It was included as part of a bigger stop-gap spending bill aimed at preventing government shutdown which was approved by a vote of 231–192. The vote was mostly along party lines with Democrats voting in favor and Republicans voting against. Republican opposition was largely due to the bill&#x27;s failure to include $5 billion for border security. Ten Democrats voted against the bill. This group included a number of progressive Democrats who urged their colleagues to oppose the bill over the measure to extend surveillance. Representative Justin Amash (Independent) submitted an amendment to remove the Patriot Act provisions, but it was defeated by the House Rules committee.

On March 10, 2020, Jerry Nadler proposed a bill to reauthorize the Patriot Act, and it was then approved by the majority of US House of Representatives after 152 Democrats joined the GOP in supporting the extension. The surveillance powers of the Patriot Act needed renewal by March 15, 2020, and after it expired, the U.S. Senate approved an amended version of the bill. After President Donald Trump threatened to veto the bill, the House of Representatives issued an indefinite postponement of the vote to pass the Senate version of the bill; , the Patriot Act remains expired.

<text>Unreal is a first-person shooter video game developed by Epic MegaGames and Digital Extremes and published by GT Interactive for Microsoft Windows in May 1998. It was powered by Unreal Engine, an original game engine. The game reached sales of 1.5 million units by 2002.

Since the release of &quot;Unreal&quot;, the franchise has had one sequel and two different series based on the &quot;Unreal&quot; universe. One official bonus pack, the Epic-released Fusion Map Pack, can be downloaded free of charge. &quot;Unreal Mission Pack I: Return to Na Pali&quot;, developed by Legend Entertainment, was released in June 1999, and added 17 new missions to the single-player campaign of &quot;Unreal&quot;. &quot;Unreal&quot; and &quot;Return to Na Pali&quot; would later be bundled together as &quot;Unreal Gold&quot;. Additionally, the games were updated to run on the &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; version of the game engine.

&quot;Unreal&quot; became free to download in November 2024.

==Plot==
The player takes on the role of Prisoner 849, aboard the prison spacecraft &quot;Vortex Rikers&quot;. During transport to a moon-based prison, the ship is pulled to an uncharted planet, before reaching its destination. The ship crash-lands on the lip of a canyon on the planet Na Pali, home of the Nali, a primitive tribal race of four-armed humanoids. The Nali and their planet have been subjugated by the Skaarj, a race of savage yet technologically advanced reptilian humanoids, who also have an army of genetically engineered Brutes and an enslaved race of warriors, known as the Krall. Skaarj troops board the downed &quot;Vortex Rikers&quot; and kill the remaining survivors, except for Prisoner 849, who manages to find a weapon and escape from the ship.

The planet Na Pali is rich in &quot;Tarydium&quot;, a mineral that is found as light blue crystals, possessing a high energy yield and are the reason the Skaarj have invaded. The Vortex Rikers had crashed near one of the many mines and processing facilities that the Skaarj have built. Prisoner 849 travels through the mines, meeting Nali slaves along the way and eventually reaching the ruins of Nali temples, villages and cities, where the extent of the Nali&#x27;s suffering and exploitation become clear. The player passes through a water temple and a massive arena, where the player must kill a giant beast called a Titan.

Throughout the game, the player stumbles upon the remains of other humans, often with electronic journals that detail their last days and hint toward the cause of their demise. Usually, these tales are of desperate struggles to hide from the Skaarj, or other bloodthirsty inhabitants of the planet. The player never meets another live human, aside from a wounded crew member on the bridge of the prison ship, who gasps and dies immediately. Prisoner 849 is likely the only human alive on the planet Na Pali throughout the duration of the game.

Prisoner 849 continues to make their way through a series of alien installations, a second crashed human spaceship and ancient Nali temples infested with Skaarj troops and their minions, before eventually arriving at the Nali Castle. Inside the castle, the prisoner locates a teleporter that leads to the Skaarj Mothership. The mothership proves to be a vast labyrinth, but Prisoner 849 manages to find and destroy the ship&#x27;s reactor, whilst fighting their way through hordes of Skaarj. The reactor&#x27;s destruction plunges the vessel into darkness and after navigating the ship&#x27;s corridors in the dark, the player finally arrives at the Skaarj Queen&#x27;s chamber, where they fight and ultimately, kill the Queen. Prisoner 849 jumps into the Queen&#x27;s personal escape pod as the mothership disintegrates. Although the prisoner survives the horrors of Na Pali, their escape pod is left to drift in space, with only a slim hope of being found.

===Expansion plot===
The expansion, Return to Na Pali, developed by Legend Entertainment, picks up not long after &quot;Unreal&quot;″s ending; Prisoner 849 is found by a human warship, the UMS &quot;Bodega Bay&quot;. The Unified Military Services (UMS) conscript the prisoner into service, upon learning their identity, forcing Prisoner 849 to return to Na Pali in order to locate the downed ship UMS &quot;Prometheus&quot;. There, the prisoner is ordered to retrieve some weapons research. In return, the prisoner will receive a full pardon and transportation back to Earth, though the real plan is revealed to be maintaining the secrecy of the mission, by killing the prisoner immediately after the information is secured.

Upon arriving at the &quot;Prometheus&quot;, Prisoner 849 finds the secret weapons log, but soon after, they find a working radio communicator nearby. The prisoner listens to a recently recorded and archived conversation between the &quot;Bodega Bay&quot; and a nearby space station, the UMS &quot;Starlight&quot;, exposing the military&#x27;s treachery. As Prisoner 849 transmits the research log, a squad of marines beam on board &quot;Prometheus&quot;, intending to eliminate the prisoner who manages to escape into a nearby mine system.

Once again, Prisoner 849 is forced to traverse a series of alien facilities and Nali temples, in an attempt to locate another way off the planet. Eventually, the prisoner ends up at another Nali Castle, where a small space shuttle is stored. After fighting through Skaarj, Krall and other monsters, the prisoner battles the final opponent, a Skaarj Warlord, before killing it and managing to take off in the spacecraft. &quot;Bodega Bay&quot;, however, is waiting in orbit and launches a missile at the prisoner&#x27;s ship. The prisoner outmanoeuvres the missile, and leads it back to &quot;Bodega Bay&quot; on a collision course. The large ship is disabled by the ensuing blast, and Prisoner 849 escapes into space.

==Development==
&quot;Unreal&quot; was jointly developed by Epic MegaGames and Digital Extremes and mostly funded with the proceeds from &quot;Epic Pinball&quot;, Epic&#x27;s best selling shareware game. In the February 1997 issue of &quot;Next Generation&quot;, lead designer James Schmalz recalled how it started:

While the team still had only the outdoor terrain and the dragon in place, Intel invited Epic MegaGames to demonstrate &quot;Unreal&quot; to them. Following the demonstration, Intel told them about their upcoming MMX instruction set. Sweeney was immediately excited by the possibilities MMX presented, and put together a working MMX version of the rendering code before Epic had even received a chip with MMX.

Originally, &quot;Unreal&quot; was going to feature a large status bar and centered weapons, similar to &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;. As development progressed, various levels were cut from development. A few of these levels reappeared in the &quot;Return to Na Pali&quot; expansion pack. A number of enemies from early versions are present in the released software, but with variations and improvements to their look. One monster that didn&#x27;t make the cut was a dragon. One of the weapons shown in early screenshots was the &quot;Quadshot&quot; - a four-barreled shotgun; the model remains in-game, while there is no code for the weapon to function (several user-made modifications bring the weapon back in the game). Another weapon shown was a different pistol, but this may have just been an early version of the Automag. At one point, the rifle could fire three shots at once, which is wrongly stated as the alternate fire in the &quot;Unreal&quot; manual that comes with &quot;Unreal Anthology&quot;.
Initially the game&#x27;s player character was to be female, but as the number of games with female playable characters increased, the team decided to allow the player to select from a male character and a female character.

In late 1996 GT Interactive secured exclusive global publishing rights to &quot;Unreal&quot;.

With the game still in development, Epic MegaGames started work on a port for the Nintendo 64DD. Mark Rein revealed that while a port for the standalone Nintendo 64 was possible, the limited storage space of the cartridge format would have necessitated heavy compromises to the details on the monsters and the number of unique textures. A Dreamcast port was also planned, and was in fact demoed for the system&#x27;s capabilities early on its lifecycle, but was canceled when GT Interactive entered financial struggles (one of the reasons they would be purchased by Infogrames in 1999), and a port of &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; would take its place in 2001.

Since &quot;Unreal&quot; came packaged with its own scripting language called UnrealScript, it soon developed a large community on the Internet which was able to add new modifications, or mods, in order to change or enhance gameplay. This feature greatly added to the overall longevity of the product and provided an incentive for new development. A map editor and overall complete modification program called UnrealEd also came with the package.

&quot;Unreal&quot;″s method of creating maps differs in major ways from that of &quot;Quake&quot;. The bundled UnrealEd map editor uses the &quot;Unreal&quot; engine to render scenes exactly as they appear in-game, as opposed to external editors like Worldcraft attempting to recreate it with different methods. Whereas &quot;Quake&quot; maps are compiled from a variety of different components, &quot;Unreal&quot; maps are inherently editable on the fly. This allows anybody to edit any map that is created, including the maps included with the game.

===Graphics===
The &quot;Unreal&quot; engine brought a host of graphical improvements rarely seen at that time. &quot;Unreal&quot;″s software renderer allowed software features as rich as the hardware renderers of the time, including colored lighting and even a limited form of texture filtering referred to by Sweeney as an ordered &quot;texture coordinate space&quot; dither. Early pre-release versions of &quot;Unreal&quot; were based entirely on software rendering.

&quot;Unreal&quot; was one of the first games to utilize detail texturing. This type of multiple texturing enhances the surfaces of objects with a second texture that shows material detail. When the player stands within a small distance from most surfaces, the detail texture will fade in and make the surface appear much more complex (high-resolution) instead of becoming increasingly blurry. Notable surfaces with these special detail textures included computer monitors, pitted metal surfaces aboard the prison ship, golden metal doors, and stone surfaces within Nali temples. This extra texture layer was not applied to character models. The resulting simulation of material detail on game objects was intended to aid the player&#x27;s suspension of disbelief. For many years after &quot;Unreal&quot;″s release (and &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;″s release), detail texturing only worked well with the S3 MeTaL and Glide renderer. It was, in fact, disabled in the Direct3D renderer by default (but could be re-enabled in the &quot;Unreal.ini&quot; file) due to performance and quality issues caused by the driver, while it was present even on hardware many times more powerful than the original S3 Savage3D and 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics.

Because of &quot;Unreal&quot;″s long development time, the course of development occurred during the emergence and rapid progression of hardware 3D accelerators. Along with the advanced software 3D renderer, &quot;Unreal&quot; was built to take advantage of the 3Dfx Glide API, which emerged as the dominant interface towards the end of the game&#x27;s development. When &quot;Unreal&quot; was finally released, Microsoft&#x27;s Direct3D API was growing rapidly in popularity and Epic was fairly quick to develop a renderer for their game engine. Direct3D renderer, however, released initially to support the new Matrox G200, was less capable and slower than the Glide support, especially in the beginning when it was unstable, slow, and had many graphics quality issues. &quot;Unreal&quot; also had official OpenGL support.

===Audio===

While many game companies went from FM synthesis or General MIDI in the early 1990s to enhanced CD audio and pre-rendered audio, many of the Epic Games used the less common system of module music, composed with a tracker, which used stored PCM sound samples of musical instruments sequenced together to produce music. Epic had been using this technology for other games such as &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot; and &quot;One Must Fall: 2097&quot;, which allowed relatively rich music to be stored in files usually smaller than one megabyte. This technology allowed easy implementation of dynamic music for mood changes in &quot;Unreal&quot;. The &quot;Unreal&quot; soundtrack was written by MOD music authors Alexander Brandon and Michiel van den Bos with a few selected tracks by Dan Gardopée and Andrew Sega (Straylight Productions). &quot;Unreal&quot;″s music engine also supports CD audio tracks. The game also made use of the Aureal 3D technology.

===Community patch support===
In July 2000 the official support ended with patch 2.26f by Epic MegaGames. Therefore, with the awareness and permission of Epic, the fan community started the &quot;OldUnreal&quot; Community patch project based on the original source code in 2008. The latest patch iteration, 2.27j, released on June 23, 2022, includes new graphics rendering like DirectX 9, updated OpenGL, new sound rendering based on OpenAL and fixes many incompatibilities with modern operating systems and hardware.

===Mac OS===
The Mac version was released in parallel with the PC version. It supported RAVE hardware acceleration as well as 3DFX&#x27;s Voodoo, built-in software rendering and, later on, OpenGL rendering. RAVE acceleration support allowed the game to support hardware 3D acceleration with just about every Mac that included it. It also supported Apple&#x27;s Game Sprockets.

The last update for the Mac OS port was version 224b, which breaks network compatibility between it and the PC version, as well as lacking support for some user-created content made for 225 and 226f. Westlake Interactive, the company responsible for the port, claimed that previous patches were produced voluntarily in their free time, beyond their contractual obligations. They also stated that they did not receive the code for the 225 patch and that it had become unavailable due to Epic moving on to develop version 226.

===Linux===
An unofficial content port of the single-player maps to Linux was created by several users of icculus.org, which allowed the &quot;Unreal&quot; single-player game content to be run as a modification for &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;. The online retailer Tux Games at one point sold a box set including the Linux version. The 227 community patch contains a full Linux port for Unreal.

===Sega Saturn===
In 2023, one fan has ported the entire first two levels of the game to the Sega Saturn as a tech demo, with plans to port more portions of the game down the line.

==Books==
Two novels titled &quot;Hard Crash&quot; and &quot;Prophet&#x27;s Power&quot; were published, expanding on the premise and story first introduced in &quot;Unreal&quot;. &quot;Prophet&#x27;s Power&quot;, numbered as the second book in the series, is actually a prequel to the first, &quot;Hard Crash&quot;, thus it is harder for readers to understand what happened in the story. A book called &quot;Escape to Na Pali: A Journey to the Unreal&quot; was published on June 23, 2014, written by Kaitlin Tremblay and Alan Williamson.

== Reception ==
===Sales===
In the United States, &quot;Unreal&quot; debuted in third place on PC Data&#x27;s computer game sales chart for the week ending May 23, 1998, at an average retail price (ARP) of $50. It climbed to first place the following week, while its ARP dropped to $40. Finishing May as the country&#x27;s second-highest computer game seller of the month, behind &quot;StarCraft&quot;, &quot;Unreal&quot; proceeded to alternate with &quot;StarCraft&quot; between positions 1 and 2 on the weekly charts through the May 31 – June 27 period. Jason Ocampo of &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; characterized the games&#x27; competition for first place as a &quot;tug-of-war&quot;. &quot;Unreal&quot; ultimately held at #2 behind &quot;StarCraft&quot; on the monthly chart for June as a whole, and became the United States&#x27; 15th-best-selling computer game of 1998&#x27;s first half.

&quot;Unreal&quot; maintained a position in PC Data&#x27;s weekly top 10 from June 28 through August 1. It continued its streak at second place for July overall, and totaled sales in excess of 120,000 copies in the United States by the end of that month, according to PC Data. &quot;IGN&quot; described this performance as &quot;a huge hit&quot;. In early August, GT Interactive reported that global sales of &quot;Unreal&quot; had topped 500,000 copies, which contributed to growth at the publisher. The game went on to appear in PC Data&#x27;s weekly top 10 from August 2 through the week ending September 12, when it fell to #10, and in the monthly top 10 for both August and September. After falling to 19th place for October in total, it exited the monthly top 20. Ultimately, PC Data declared &quot;Unreal&quot; the United States&#x27; 11th-best-selling computer game during the January–November 1998 period.

In the United States, &quot;Unreal&quot; finished 1998 as the year&#x27;s 13th-biggest computer game seller, with sales of 291,300 units and revenues of $10.96 million. Its ARP for the year was $38. According to &quot;GameDaily&quot;, the game&#x27;s sales in the United States reached 350,000 units by January 1999. Worldwide sales surpassed one million units by September 1999, and reached 1.5 million copies by November 2002.

===Critical response===

&quot;Unreal&quot; received positive reviews upon release. Critics praised the graphics, gameplay, music, atmosphere, enemy behavior, and bot support in multiplayer mode, but criticized the lag-ridden online multiplayer mode.

&quot;Macworld&quot;″s Michael Gowan wrote: &quot;This 3-D shoot-&#x27;em-up reinvigorates a tired genre. Plot, atmosphere, and exploration mix with ferocious enemies to make this game stand out from the pack&quot;.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; gave five stars out of five for the PC version of the game, and called it the best action game for the platform. In 2018 &quot;CNET&quot; praised the game at its 20th anniversary.

===Accolades===
In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; declared &quot;Unreal&quot; the 13th-best computer game ever released.

<text>USS &quot;Monitor&quot; was an ironclad warship built for the United States Navy during the American Civil War and completed in early 1862, the first such ship commissioned by the Navy. &quot;Monitor&quot; played a central role in the Battle of Hampton Roads on 9 March under the command of Lieutenant John L. Worden, where she fought the casemate ironclad (built on the hull of the scuttled steam frigate ) to a stalemate. The design of the ship was distinguished by its revolving turret, which was designed by American inventor Theodore Timby; it was quickly duplicated and established the monitor class and type of armored warship built for the American Navy over the next several decades.

The remainder of the ship was designed by Swedish-born engineer and inventor John Ericsson, and built in only 101 days in Brooklyn, New York, on the East River beginning in late 1861. &quot;Monitor&quot; presented a new concept in ship design and employed a variety of new inventions and innovations in ship building that caught the attention of the world. The impetus to build &quot;Monitor&quot; was prompted by the news that the Confederates had raised the scuttled &quot;Merrimack&quot; and were building an iron-plated armored vessel named the &quot;Virginia&quot; on her hull in the old Federal naval shipyard at Gosport, near Norfolk, that could effectively engage the Union ships blockading Hampton Roads harbor and the James River leading northwest to Richmond (capital of the Confederacy). They could ultimately advance unchallenged on Washington, D.C., up the Potomac River and other seacoast cities. Before &quot;Monitor&quot; could reach Hampton Roads, the Confederate ironclad had already destroyed the sail frigates and and had run the steam frigate aground. That night, &quot;Monitor&quot; arrived and, just as &quot;Virginia&quot; set to finish off &quot;Minnesota&quot; and &quot;St. Lawrence&quot; on the second day, the new Union ironclad confronted the Confederate ship, preventing her from wreaking further destruction on the wooden Union ships. A four-hour battle ensued, each ship pounding the other with close-range cannon fire, although neither ship could destroy or seriously damage the other. This was the first battle fought between armored warships and marked a turning point in naval warfare.

The Confederates were forced to scuttle and destroy &quot;Virginia&quot; as they withdrew in early May 1862 from Norfolk and its naval shipyard, while &quot;Monitor&quot; sailed up the James River to support the Union Army during the Peninsula Campaign under General-in-Chief George B. McClellan. The ship participated in the Battle of Drewry&#x27;s Bluff later that month, and remained in the area giving support to General McClellan&#x27;s forces on land until she was ordered to join the Union Navy blockaders off North Carolina in December. On her way there, she foundered while under tow during a storm off Cape Hatteras on the last day of the year. &quot;Monitor&quot;″s wreck was discovered in 1973 and has been partially salvaged. Her guns, gun turret, engine, and other relics are on display at the Mariners&#x27; Museum in Newport News, Virginia, a few miles from the site of her most important military action.

== Conception ==

While the concept of ships protected by armor existed before the advent of the ironclad &quot;Monitor&quot;, the need for iron plating on ship arose only after the explosive shell-firing Paixhans gun was introduced to naval warfare in the 1820s. The use of heavy iron plating on the sides of warships was not practical until steam propulsion matured enough to carry its great weight. Developments in gun technology had progressed by the 1840s so that no practical thickness of wood could withstand the power of a shell. In response, the United States began construction in 1854 of a steam-powered ironclad warship, &quot;Stevens Battery&quot;, but work was delayed and the designer, Robert Stevens, died in 1856, stalling further work. Since there was no pressing need for such a ship at the time, there was little demand to continue work on the unfinished vessel. It was France that introduced the first operational armored ships as well as the first shell guns and rifled cannons. Experience during the Crimean War of 1854–1855 showed that armored ships could withstand repeated hits without significant damage when French ironclad floating batteries defeated Russian coastal fortifications during the Battle of Kinburn. Ericsson claimed to have sent the French Emperor Napoléon III a proposal for a monitor-type design, with a gun turret, in September 1854, but no record of any such submission could be found in the archives of the French Ministry of the Navy (&quot;Ministre de la Marine&quot;) when they were searched by naval historian James Phinney Baxter III. The French followed those ships with the first ocean-going ironclad, the armored frigate in 1859, and the British responded with .

The Union Navy&#x27;s attitude towards ironclads changed quickly when it was learned that the Confederates were converting the captured to an ironclad at the naval shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia. Subsequently, the urgency of &quot;Monitor&quot;″s completion and deployment to Hampton Roads was driven by fears of what the Confederate ironclad, now renamed &quot;Virginia&quot;, would be capable of doing, not only to Union ships but to cities along the coast and riverfronts. Northern newspapers published daily accounts of the Confederates&#x27; progress in converting the &quot;Merrimack&quot; to an ironclad; this prompted the Union Navy to complete and deploy &quot;Monitor&quot; as soon as possible.

Word of &quot;Merrimack&quot;″s reconstruction and conversion was confirmed in the North in late February 1862 when Mary Louvestre of Norfolk, a freed slave who worked as a housekeeper for one of the Confederate engineers working on &quot;Merrimack&quot;, made her way through Confederate lines with news that the Confederates were building an ironclad warship. Concealed in her dress was a message from a Union sympathizer who worked in the Navy Yard warning that the former &quot;Merrimack&quot;, renamed &quot;Virginia&quot; by the Confederates, was nearing completion. Upon her arrival in Washington Louvestre managed to meet with Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles and informed him that the Confederates were nearing the completion of their ironclad, which surprised Welles. Convinced by the papers Louvestre was carrying, he had production of &quot;Monitor&quot; sped up. Welles later recorded in his memoirs that &quot;Mrs. Louvestre encountered no small risk in bringing this information ...&quot;.

==Approval==

After the United States received word of the construction of &quot;Virginia&quot;, Congress appropriated $1.5 million on 3 August 1861 to build one or more armored steamships. It also ordered the creation of a board to inquire into the various designs proposed for armored ships. The Union Navy advertised for proposals for &quot;iron-clad steam vessels of war&quot; on 7 August and Welles appointed three senior officers as the Ironclad Board the following day. Their task was to &quot;examine plans for the completion of iron-clad vessels&quot; and consider its costs.

Ericsson originally made no submission to the board, but became involved when Cornelius Bushnell, the sponsor of the proposal that became the armored sloop , needed to have his design reviewed by a naval constructor. The board required a guarantee from Bushnell that his ship would float despite the weight of its armor and Cornelius H. DeLamater of New York City recommended that Bushnell consult with his friend Ericsson. The two first met on 9 September and again on the following day, after Ericsson had time to evaluate &quot;Galena&quot; design. During this second meeting, Ericsson showed Bushnell a model of his own design, the future &quot;Monitor&quot;, derived from his 1854 design. Bushnell got Ericsson&#x27;s permission to show the model to Welles, who told Bushnell to show it to the board. Upon review of Ericsson&#x27;s unusual design, the board was skeptical, concerned that such a vessel would not float, especially in rough seas, and rejected the proposal of a completely iron laden ship. President Lincoln, who had also examined the design, overruled them. Ericsson assured the board his ship would float exclaiming, &quot;The sea shall ride over her and she shall live in it like a duck&quot;. On 15 September, after further deliberations, the board accepted Ericsson&#x27;s proposal. The Ironclad Board evaluated 17 different designs, but recommended only three for procurement on 16 September, including Ericsson&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; design.

The three ironclad ships selected differed substantially in design and degree of risk. &quot;Monitor&quot; was the most innovative design by virtue of its low freeboard, shallow-draft iron hull, and total dependence on steam power. The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret, something that had not previously been tested by any navy. Ericsson&#x27;s guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved.

==Design and description==

&quot;Monitor&quot; was an unusual vessel in almost every respect and was sometimes sarcastically described by the press and other critics as &quot;Ericsson&#x27;s folly&quot;, &quot;cheesebox on a raft&quot; and the &quot;Yankee cheesebox&quot;. The most prominent feature on the vessel was a large cylindrical gun turret mounted amidships above the low-freeboard upper hull, also called the &quot;raft&quot;. This extended well past the sides of the lower, more traditionally shaped hull. A small armored pilot house was fitted on the upper deck towards the bow, however, its position prevented &quot;Monitor&quot; from firing her guns straight forward. One of Ericsson&#x27;s prime goals in designing the ship was to present the smallest possible target to enemy gunfire. The ship was long overall, had a beam of and had a maximum draft of . &quot;Monitor&quot; had a tonnage of 776 tons burthen and displaced . Her crew consisted of 49 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by a single-cylinder horizontal vibrating-lever steam engine, also designed by Ericsson, which drove a propeller, whose shaft was nine inches in diameter. The engine used steam generated by two horizontal fire-tube boilers at a maximum pressure of . The engine was designed to give the ship a top speed of , but &quot;Monitor&quot; was slower in service. The engine had a bore of and a stroke of . The ship carried of coal. Ventilation for the vessel was supplied by two centrifugal blowers near the stern, each of which was powered by a steam engine. One fan circulated air throughout the ship, but the other one forced air through the boilers, which depended on this forced draught. Leather belts connected the blowers to their engines and they would stretch when wet, often disabling the fans and boilers. The ship&#x27;s pumps were steam operated and water would accumulate in the ship if the pumps could not get enough steam to work.

&quot;Monitor&quot;″s turret measured in diameter and high, constructed with of armor (11 inches in front at the gun ports) rendering the overall vessel somewhat top heavy. Its rounded shape helped to deflect cannon shot. A pair of steam-powered donkey engines rotated the turret through a set of gears; a full rotation was made in 22.5 seconds during testing on 9 February 1862. Fine control of the turret proved to be difficult; as there was no brake the steam engines would have to be placed in reverse if the turret overshot its mark, or another full rotation would have to be made. The only way to see out of the turret was through the gun ports; when the guns were not in use, or withdrawn for reloading during battle, heavy iron port stoppers would swing down into place to close the gunports. Including the guns, the turret weighed approximately ; the entire weight rested on an iron spindle that had to be jacked up using a wedge before the turret could rotate. The spindle was in diameter which gave it ten times the strength needed in preventing the turret from sliding sideways. When not in use, the turret rested on a brass ring on the deck that was intended to form a watertight seal. In service, however, this proved to leak heavily, despite caulking by the crew. The gap between the turret and the deck proved to be a problem as debris and shell fragments entered the gap and jammed the turrets of several s, which used the same turret design, during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863. Direct hits on the turret with heavy shot could bend the spindle, which could also jam the turret. To gain access to the turret from below, or to hoist up powder and shot during battle, the turret had to rotate to face starboard, which would line up the entry hatch in the floor of the turret with an opening in the deck below. The roof of the turret was lightly built to facilitate any needed exchange of the ship&#x27;s guns and to improve ventilation, with only gravity holding the roof plates in place.
The turret was intended to mount a pair of smoothbore Dahlgren guns, but they were not ready in time and guns were substituted, weighing approximately each. &quot;Monitor&quot;″s guns used the standard propellant charge of specified by the 1860 ordnance for targets &quot;distant&quot;, &quot;near&quot;, and &quot;ordinary&quot;, established by the gun&#x27;s designer Dahlgren himself. They could fire a round shot or shell up to a range of at an elevation of +15°.

The top of the armored deck was only about above the waterline. It was protected by two layers of wrought iron armor. The sides of the &quot;raft&quot; consisted of three to five layers of iron plates, backed by about of pine and oak. Three of the plates extended the full height of the side, but the two innermost plates did not extend all the way down. Ericsson originally intended to use either six 1-inch plates or a single outer plate backed by three plates, but the thicker plate required too much time to roll. The two innermost plates were riveted together while the outer plates were bolted to the inner ones. A ninth plate, only thick and wide, was bolted over the butt joints of the innermost layer of armor. Glass portholes in the deck provided natural light for the interior of the ship; in action these were covered by iron plates.

After the duel between the two ironclads at Hampton Roads there was concern by some Navy officials who witnessed the battle that &quot;Monitor&quot;″s design might allow for easy boarding by the Confederates. In a letter dated 27 April 1862 Lieutenant Commander O.C. Badger wrote to Lieutenant H. A. Wise, Assistant Inspector of Ordnance, advising the use of &quot;liquid fire&quot;, scalding water from the boiler through hoses and pipes, sprayed out via the vents and pilothouse window, to repel enemy boarders. Wise who was aboard and inspected &quot;Monitor&quot; after the battle responded in a letter of 30 April 1862: &quot;With reference to the Monitor, the moment I jumped on board of her after the fight I saw that a steam tug with twenty men could have taken the upper part of her in as many seconds ... I hear that hot water pipes are arranged so as to scald the assailants when they may dare to set foot on her.&quot; The chance to employ such a tactic never arose. There are conflicting accounts as to whether such an anti-personnel provision was installed.

==Construction==

Commodore Joseph Smith, Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, sent Ericsson formal notice of the acceptance of his proposal on 21 September 1861. Six days later, Ericsson signed a contract with Bushnell, John F. Winslow and John A. Griswold which stated that the four partners would equally share in the profits or the losses incurred by the construction of the ironclad. There was one major delay, however, over the signing of the actual contract with the government. Welles insisted that if &quot;Monitor&quot; did not prove to be a &quot;complete success&quot;, the builders would have to refund every cent to the government. Winslow balked at this draconian provision and had to be persuaded by his partners to sign after the Navy rejected his attempt to amend the contract. The contract was finally signed on 4 October for a price of $275,000 to be paid in installments as work progressed.

Preliminary work had begun well before that date, however, and Ericsson&#x27;s consortium contracted with Thomas F. Rowland of the Continental Iron Works at Bushwick Inlet (in modern-day Greenpoint, Brooklyn) on 25 October for construction of &quot;Monitor&quot;″s hull. Her keel was laid the same day. The turret was built and assembled at the Novelty Iron Works in Manhattan, disassembled and shipped to Bushwick Inlet where it was reassembled. The ship&#x27;s steam engines and machinery were constructed at the DeLamater Iron Works, also in Manhattan. Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers, who once served aboard &quot;Merrimack&quot;, was appointed Superintendent of the ship while she was undergoing construction. Although never formally assigned to the crew, he remained aboard her as an inspector during her maiden voyage and battle.

Construction progressed in fits and starts, plagued by a number of short delays in the delivery of iron and occasional shortages of cash, but they did not delay the ship&#x27;s progress by more than a few weeks. The hundred days allotted for her construction passed on 12 January, but the Navy chose not to penalize the consortium. The name &quot;Monitor&quot;, meaning &quot;one who admonishes and corrects wrongdoers&quot;, was proposed by Ericsson on 20 January 1862 and approved by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Fox. While Ericsson stood on its deck in defiance of all his critics who thought she would never float, &quot;Monitor&quot; was launched on 30 January 1862 to the cheers of the watching crowd, even those who had bet that the ship would sink straight to the bottom, and commissioned on 25 February.

Even before &quot;Monitor&quot; was commissioned, she ran an unsuccessful set of sea trials on 19 February. Valve problems with the main engine and one of the fan engines prevented her from reaching the Brooklyn Navy Yard from Bushwick Inlet and she had to be towed there the next day. These issues were easily fixed and &quot;Monitor&quot; was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February, but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition. On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the East River preparatory to leaving New York, but proved to be all but unsteerable and had to be towed back to the navy yard. Upon examination, the steering gear controlling the rudder had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign the rudder, which he estimated to take only a day. Ericsson, however, preferred to revise the steering gear by adding an extra set of pulleys as he believed it would take less time. His modification proved to be successful during trials on 4 March. Gunnery trials were successfully performed the previous day, although Stimers twice nearly caused disasters as he did not understand how the recoil mechanism worked on Ericsson&#x27;s carriage for the 11-inch guns. Instead of tightening them to reduce the recoil upon firing, he loosened them so that both guns struck the back of the turret, fortunately without hurting anybody or damaging the guns.

&quot;Monitor&quot; employed over forty patented inventions and marked a significant departure from the dominant naval vessels of the time. Ericsson&#x27;s innovative turret design, although not without flaws, facilitated the widespread adoption of rotating guns on warships in navies worldwide. Because &quot;Monitor&quot; was an experimental craft, urgently needed, hurriedly constructed, and almost immediately put to sea, a number of problems were discovered during her maiden voyage to Hampton Roads and during the battle there. Yet she was still able to challenge &quot;Virginia&quot; and prevent her from further destroying the remaining ships in the Union flotilla blockading Hampton Roads.

During the &quot;boom time&quot; of the Civil War, Ericsson could have made a fortune with his inventions used in &quot;Monitor&quot;, but instead gave the U.S. government all his &quot;Monitor&quot; patent rights saying it was his &quot;contribution to the glorious Union cause&quot;.

==Crew==
The original officers at the time of &quot;Monitor&quot;″s commissioning were:


&quot;Monitor&quot; crew were all volunteers and totaled 49 officers and enlisted men. The ship required ten officers: a commander, an executive officer, four engineers, one medical officer, two masters and a paymaster. Before Worden was allowed to select, assemble, and commit a crew to &quot;Monitor&quot;, the vessel had to be completed.

Four of the officers were line officers and responsible for the handling of the vessel and operation of guns during battle, while the engineering officers were considered a class unto themselves. In &quot;Monitor&quot; turret, Greene and Stodder supervised loading and firing of the two Dahlgrens. Each gun was crewed by eight men. In Worden&#x27;s report of 27 January 1862 to Welles, he stated he believed 17 men and 2 officers would be the maximum number in the turret that allowed the crew to work without getting in each other&#x27;s way.

&quot;Monitor&quot; also required petty officers: among them was Daniel Toffey, Worden&#x27;s nephew. Worden had selected Toffey to serve as his captain&#x27;s clerk. Two black Americans were also among the enlisted men in the crew.

Living quarters for the senior officers consisted of eight separate well-furnished cabins, each provided with a small oak table and chair, an oil lamp, shelves and drawers and a canvas floor covering covered with a rug. The entire crew were given goat-skin mats to sleep on. Lighting for each living area was provided by small skylights in the deck above, which were covered by an iron hatch during battle. The officer&#x27;s wardroom was located forward of the berth deck where officers would eat their meals, hold meetings or socialize during what little spare time they had. It was well furnished with an oriental rug, a large oak table and other such items. Ericsson had personally paid for the costs of all the officer&#x27;s furnishings.

Many details of &quot;Monitor&quot;″s history and insights of everyday crew life have been discovered from correspondence sent from the various crew members to family and friends while serving aboard the ironclad. In particular the correspondence of George S. Geer, who sent more than 80 letters, often referred to as &quot;The Monitor Chronicles&quot;, to his wife Martha during the entire time of &quot;Monitor&quot;″s service provide many details and insights into every chapter of the ironclad&#x27;s short-lived history, offering a rare perspective of a sailor&#x27;s experience on the naval front during the Civil War. The letters of Acting Paymaster William F. Keeler to his wife Anna also corroborate many of the accounts of affairs that took place aboard &quot;Monitor&quot;. The letters of Geer and Keeler are available for viewing and are housed at the Mariners&#x27; Museum in Virginia. Other crew members were interviewed later in life, like Louis N. Stodder, one of the last crew members to abandon &quot;Monitor&quot; minutes before she sank in a storm at sea, who was the last surviving crew member of &quot;Monitor&quot; and lived well into the 20th century.

==Service==
On 6 March 1862, the ship departed New York bound for Fort Monroe, Virginia, towed by the ocean-going tug &quot;Seth Low&quot; and accompanied by the gunboats and . Worden, not trusting the seal between the turret and the hull, and ignoring Ericsson&#x27;s advice, wedged the former in the up position and stuffed oakum and sail cloth in the gap. Rising seas that night washed the oakum away and water poured underneath the turret, as well as through the hawsepipe, various hatches, ventilation pipes, and the two funnels, so that the belts for the ventilation and boiler fans loosened and fell off and the fires in the boilers were nearly extinguished over the course of the next day; this created a toxic atmosphere in the engine room that knocked out most of the engine-room crew. First Assistant Engineer Isaac Newton ordered the engine room abandoned and had the able-bodied crew drag the afflicted engine room hands to the top of the turret where the fresh air could revive them. Both Newton and Stimers worked desperately to get the blowers to work, but they too succumbed to the noxious fumes and were taken above. One fireman was able to punch a hole in the fan box, drain the water, and restart the fan. Later that night, the wheel ropes controlling the ship&#x27;s rudder jammed, making it nearly impossible to control the ship&#x27;s heading in the rough seas. &quot;Monitor&quot; was now in danger of foundering, so Worden signaled &quot;Seth Low&quot; for help and had &quot;Monitor&quot; towed to calmer waters closer to shore so she was able to restart her engines later that evening. She rounded Cape Charles around 3:00 pm on 8 March and entered Chesapeake Bay, reaching Hampton Roads at 9:00 pm, well after the first day&#x27;s fighting in the Battle of Hampton Roads had concluded.

===Battle of Hampton Roads===

On 8 March 1862, &quot;Virginia&quot;, commanded by Commander Franklin Buchanan, was ready to engage the Union flotilla blockading the James River. &quot;Virginia&quot; was powered by &quot;Merrimack&quot;″s original engines, which had been condemned by the US Navy before her capture. The ship&#x27;s chief engineer, H. Ashton Ramsay, served in &quot;Merrimack&quot; before the Civil War broke out and knew of the engines&#x27; unreliability, but Buchanan pushed forward undaunted.

The slow-moving &quot;Virginia&quot; attacked the Union blockading squadron in Hampton Roads, Virginia, destroying the sail frigates &quot;Cumberland&quot; and &quot;Congress&quot;. Early in the battle, the steam frigate ran aground while attempting to engage &quot;Virginia&quot;, and remained stranded throughout the battle. &quot;Virginia&quot;, however, was unable to attack &quot;Minnesota&quot; before daylight faded. That day Buchanan was severely wounded in the leg and was relieved of command by Catesby ap Roger Jones.

Days before the battle a telegraph cable was laid between Fortress Monroe, which overlooked Hampton Roads, and Washington. Washington was immediately informed of the dire situation after the initial battle. Many were now concerned &quot;Virginia&quot; would put to sea and begin bombarding cities such as New York while others feared she would ascend the Potomac River and attack Washington. In an emergency meeting among President Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary Welles and other senior naval officers, inquiries were made about &quot;Monitor&quot;″s ability to stop &quot;Virginia&quot;″s prospect of further destruction. When the temperamental Stanton learned that &quot;Monitor&quot; had only two guns, he expressed contempt and rage as he paced back and forth, further increasing the anxiety and despair among attendees of the meeting. Assurances from Admiral Dahlgren and other officers that &quot;Virginia&quot; was too massive to effectively approach Washington and that &quot;Monitor&quot; was capable of meeting the challenge gave him no consolation. After further deliberation, Lincoln was finally assured, but Stanton remained almost in a state of terror and sent telegrams to various governors and mayors of the coastal states warning them of the danger. Subsequently, Stanton approved a plan to load some sixty canal boats with stone and gravel and sink them in the Potomac, but Welles was able to convince Lincoln at the last moment that such a plan would only prevent &quot;Monitor&quot; and other Union ships from reaching Washington and that the barges should only be sunk only if &quot;Virginia&quot; was able to make her way up the Potomac.

About 9:00 pm, &quot;Monitor&quot; finally arrived on the scene, only to discover the destruction that &quot;Virginia&quot; had already wrought on the Union fleet. Worden was ordered upon reaching Hampton Roads to anchor alongside and report to Captain John Marston; Worden was briefed on the situation and received further orders to protect the grounded &quot;Minnesota&quot;. By midnight, under the cover of darkness, &quot;Monitor&quot; quietly pulled up alongside and behind the &quot;Minnesota&quot; and waited.

====Duel of the ironclads====
The next morning at about 6:00 am &quot;Virginia&quot;, accompanied by , and , got underway from Sewell&#x27;s Point to finish off &quot;Minnesota&quot; and the rest of the blockaders, but were delayed from reaching Hampton Roads because of heavy fog until about 8:00 am. In &quot;Monitor&quot; Worden was already at his station in the pilot house while Greene took command of the turret. Samuel Howard, Acting Master of &quot;Minnesota&quot;, who was familiar with Hampton Roads with its varying depths and shallow areas, had volunteered to be the pilot the night before and thus was accepted, while Quarter Master Peter Williams steered the vessel throughout the battle (Williams was later awarded the Medal of Honor for this act). The speaking tube used to communicate between the pilothouse and the turret broke early in the action, so Keeler and Toffey had to relay commands from Worden to Greene. As &quot;Virginia&quot; approached, she began firing at &quot;Minnesota&quot; from more than a mile away, a few of her shells hitting the vessel. When the firing was heard in the distance, Greene sent Keeler to the pilot house for permission to open fire as soon as possible; Worden ordered, &quot;Tell Mr. Greene not to fire till I give the word, to be cool and deliberate, to take sure aim and not waste a shot.&quot;

&quot;Monitor&quot;, to the surprise of &quot;Virginia&quot;″s crew, emerged from behind &quot;Minnesota&quot; and positioned herself between her and the grounded ship, preventing the Confederate ironclad from further engaging the vulnerable wooden ship at close range. At 8:45 am Worden gave the order to fire; Greene fired the first shots of the battle between the two ironclads, which harmlessly deflected off the Confederate ironclad. During the battle &quot;Monitor&quot; fired solid shot, about once every eight minutes, while &quot;Virginia&quot; fired shell exclusively. The ironclads fought, generally at close range, for about four hours, ending at 12:15 pm, ranging from a few yards to more than a hundred. Both ships were constantly in motion, maintaining a circular pattern. Because of &quot;Virginia&quot;″s weak engines, great size and weight, and a draft of , she was slow and difficult to maneuver, taking her half an hour to complete a 180-degree turn.

During the engagement, the controls of the machinery driving &quot;Monitor&quot;″s turret spindle began to malfunction, making it extremely difficult to turn and stop the turret itself at a given position, so the crew simply let the turret continuously turn and fired their guns &quot;on the fly&quot; as they bore on &quot;Virginia&quot;. &quot;Monitor&quot; received several direct hits on the turret, causing some bolts to violently shear off and ricochet around inside. The deafening sound of the impact stunned some of the crew, causing bleeding from noses and ears. However, neither vessel was able to sink or seriously damage the other. At one point, &quot;Virginia&quot; attempted to ram, but only struck &quot;Monitor&quot; a glancing blow and did no damage. The collision did, however, aggravate the damage to &quot;Virginia&quot;″s bow from when she had previously rammed &quot;Cumberland&quot;. &quot;Monitor&quot; was also unable to do significant damage to &quot;Virginia&quot;, possibly because her guns were firing with reduced charges, on advice from Commander John Dahlgren, the gun&#x27;s designer, who lacked the &quot;preliminary information&quot; needed to determine what amount of charge was needed to &quot;pierce, dislocate or dislodge iron plates&quot; of various thicknesses and configurations. During the battle Stodder was stationed at the wheel that controlled the turning of the turret, but at one point when he was leaning against its side the turret received a direct hit directly opposite to him which knocked him clear across the inside, rendering him unconscious. He was taken below to recover and relieved by Stimers.

The two vessels were at such close range that they collided five times. By 11:00 am &quot;Monitor&quot;″s supply of shot in the turret had been exhausted. With one of the gun port covers jammed shut, she hauled off to shallow waters to resupply the turret and repair the damaged hatch, which could not be fixed. During the lull in the battle, Worden climbed through the gun port out onto the deck to get a better view of the overall situation. &quot;Virginia&quot;, seeing &quot;Monitor&quot; turn away, turned her attention to &quot;Minnesota&quot; and fired shots that set the wooden vessel ablaze, also destroying the nearby tugboat &quot;Dragon&quot;. When the turret was resupplied with ammunition, Worden returned to battle with only one gun able to fire.

Towards the end of the engagement, Worden directed Williams to steer &quot;Monitor&quot; around the stern of the Confederate ironclad; Lieutenant Wood fired &quot;Virginia&quot;″s 7-inch Brooke gun at &quot;Monitor&quot;″s pilothouse, striking the forward side directly beneath the sight hold, cracking the structural &quot;iron log&quot; along the base of the narrow opening just as Worden was peering out. Worden was heard to cry out, &quot;My eyes—I am blind!&quot; Others in the pilothouse had also been hit with fragments and were also bleeding. Temporarily blinded by shell fragments and gunpowder residue from the explosion, and believing the pilothouse to be severely damaged, Worden ordered Williams to sheer off into shallow water, where &quot;Virginia&quot; with her deep draft could not follow. There &quot;Monitor&quot; drifted idly for about twenty minutes. At the time the pilothouse was struck, Worden&#x27;s injury was only known to those in the pilothouse and immediately nearby. With Worden severely wounded, command passed to the executive officer, Samuel Greene. Taken by surprise, he was briefly undecided as to what action to take next, but after assessing the damage, soon ordered &quot;Monitor&quot; to return to the battle.

Shortly after &quot;Monitor&quot; withdrew, &quot;Virginia&quot; ran aground, at which time Jones came down from the spar deck to find the gun crews not returning fire. Jones demanded to know why and was briefed by Lieutenant Eggleston that powder was low and precious, and given &quot;Monitor&quot;″s resistance to shot after two hours of battle, maintained that continued firing at that point would be a waste of ammunition. &quot;Virginia&quot; soon managed to break away and headed back towards Norfolk for needed repairs, believing that &quot;Monitor&quot; had withdrawn from battle. Greene did not pursue; like Worden, he was under orders to stay with and protect &quot;Minnesota&quot;, an action for which he was later criticized.

As a result of the duel between the two ironclads, &quot;Monitor&quot; was struck 22 times, including nine hits to the turret and two to the pilothouse. She had managed to fire 41 shots from her pair of Dahlgren guns. &quot;Virginia&quot; sustained 97 indentations to her armor from the fire of &quot;Monitor&quot; and other ships. Neither ship sustained any significant damage. In the opinion of &quot;Virginia&quot;″s commander Jones and her other officers, &quot;Monitor&quot; could have sunk their ship had she hit the vessel at the waterline.

Strategically, the battle between these two ships was considered the most definitive naval battle of the Civil War. The battle itself was largely considered a draw, though it could be argued &quot;Virginia&quot; did slightly more damage. &quot;Monitor&quot; did successfully defend &quot;Minnesota&quot; and the rest of the Union blockading force, while &quot;Virginia&quot; was unable to complete the destruction she started the previous day. The battle marked a turning point in the way naval warfare would be fought in the future. Strategically, nothing had changed: the Union still controlled Hampton Roads and the Confederates still held several rivers and Norfolk, making it a strategic victory for the North. The battle of the ironclads led to what was referred to as &quot;Monitor fever&quot; in the North. During the course of the war, improved designs based on &quot;Monitor&quot; emerged; 60 ironclads were built.

====Events after the battle====

Immediately following the battle Stimers telegraphed Ericsson, congratulating and thanking him for making it possible to confront the Confederate ironclad and for &quot;saving the day&quot;. No sooner than &quot;Monitor&quot; had weighed anchor, numerous small boats and spectators on shore flocked around the ship to congratulate the crew for what they regarded as their victory over &quot;Virginia&quot;. Assistant Secretary Fox, who observed the entire battle from aboard &quot;Minnesota&quot;, came aboard &quot;Monitor&quot; and jokingly told her officers, &quot;Well gentlemen, you don&#x27;t look as though you just went through one of the greatest naval conflicts on record&quot;. A small tug soon came alongside and the blinded Worden was brought up from his cabin while crew members and spectators cheered. He was taken to Fort Monroe for preliminary treatment, then to a hospital in Washington.

Stimers and Newton soon began repairing the damage to the pilot house, and reconfigured the sides from an upright position to a slope of thirty degrees to deflect shot. During this time, Mrs. Worden personally brought news of her husband&#x27;s progress and recovery and was optimistic, informing the crew his eyesight would soon return but he would be laid up for some time. She also informed them President Lincoln had personally paid Worden a visit extending his gratitude. Worden was later taken to his summer home in New York and remained unconscious for three months. He returned to Naval service in 1862 as captain of , another &quot;Monitor&quot;-type ironclad.

The Confederates were also celebrating what they considered a victory, as crowds of spectators gathered along the banks of the Elizabeth River, cheering and waving flags, handkerchiefs and hats as &quot;Virginia&quot;, displaying the captured ensign of &quot;Congress&quot;, passed along up the river. The Confederate government was ecstatic and immediately promoted Buchanan to Admiral.

Both the Union and Confederacy soon came up with plans for defeating the other&#x27;s ironclad. Oddly, these did not depend on their own ironclads. The Union Navy chartered a large ship (the sidewheeler ) and reinforced her bow with steel specifically to be used as a naval ram, provided &quot;Virginia&quot; steamed far enough out into Hampton Roads.

On 11 April, &quot;Virginia&quot;, accompanied by a number of gunboats, steamed into Hampton Roads to Sewell&#x27;s Point at the southeast edge, almost over to Newport News, in a challenge to lure &quot;Monitor&quot; into battle. &quot;Virginia&quot; fired a few shots ineffectively at very long range while &quot;Monitor&quot; returned fire, remaining near Fort Monroe, ready to fight if &quot;Virginia&quot; came to attack the Federal force congregated there. Furthermore, &quot;Vanderbilt&quot; was in position to ram &quot;Virginia&quot; if she approached the fort, but &quot;Virginia&quot; did not take the bait. In a further attempt to entice &quot;Monitor&quot; closer to the Confederate side so she could be boarded, the James River Squadron moved in and captured three merchant ships, the brigs &quot;Marcus&quot; and &quot;Sabout&quot;, and the schooner &quot;Catherine T. Dix&quot;. These had been grounded and abandoned when they sighted &quot;Virginia&quot; entering the Roads. Their flags were then hoisted &quot;Union-side down&quot; to taunt &quot;Monitor&quot; into a fight as they were towed back to Norfolk. In the end, both sides had failed to provoke a fight on their terms.

The Confederate Navy originally had devised a plan by which the James River Squadron would swarm &quot;Monitor&quot; with a party of men to board and capture the vessel, and disable her by using heavy hammers to drive iron wedges under and disable the turret, and by covering the pilothouse with a wet sail effectively blinding the pilot. Others would throw combustibles down the ventilation openings and smoke holes. At one point Jones made such an attempt to board the vessel, but she managed to slip away around the stern of &quot;Virginia&quot; in time.

There was a second confrontation on 8 May, when &quot;Virginia&quot; came out while &quot;Monitor&quot; and four other Federal ships bombarded Confederate batteries at Sewell&#x27;s Point. The Federal ships retired slowly to Fort Monroe, hoping to lure &quot;Virginia&quot; into the Roads. She did not follow, however, and after firing a gun to windward as a sign of contempt, anchored off Sewell&#x27;s Point. Later, when Confederate forces abandoned Norfolk on 11 May 1862, they were forced to destroy &quot;Virginia&quot;.
===Battle of Drewry&#x27;s Bluff===
After the destruction of &quot;Virginia&quot;, &quot;Monitor&quot; was free to assist the Union Army and General McClellan&#x27;s campaign against Richmond. As the Navy always gave command to officers based on seniority, Greene was replaced with Lieutenant Thomas O. Selfridge the day after the battle. Two days later, Selfridge was in turn relieved by Lieutenant William Nicholson Jeffers on 15 May 1862. &quot;Monitor&quot; was now part of a flotilla under the command of Admiral John Rodgers aboard &quot;Galena&quot;, and, along with three other gunboats, steamed up the James River and engaged the Confederate batteries at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff. The force had instructions to coordinate their efforts with McClellan&#x27;s forces on land and push on towards Richmond to bombard the city into surrender if possible. Without any assistance, the task force got within of the Confederate capital but could not proceed further because of sunken vessels and debris placed in the river that blocked further passage. There were also artillery batteries at Fort Darling overlooking and guarding the approach, along with other heavy guns and sharpshooters positioned along the river banks. The fort was strategically situated on the west bank of the James River atop of a bluff some above and overlooking the bend in the river. &quot;Monitor&quot; was of little help in the assault because the confinement and small gun ports of her turret would not allow her to elevate her guns sufficiently to engage the Confederate batteries at close range, so she had to fall back and fire at a greater distance, while the other gunboats were unable to overcome the fortifications on their own. After &quot;Monitor&quot; received only a few hits, without incurring any damage, the Confederates, many of whom were former crew members of &quot;Virginia&quot; well aware of her ability to withstand cannon shot even at close range, concentrated their guns on the other ships, especially &quot;Galena&quot;, which sustained considerable damage and moderate casualties. After a near four-hour artillery duel and sustaining numerous hits overall, the flotilla was unable to neutralize the fortification and had to turn back. Not a single Union ship reached Richmond until near the end of the war, when the city was finally evacuated by the Confederates.
After the battle at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff &quot;Monitor&quot; remained on the James River providing support, along with the &quot;Galena&quot; and other gunboats, to McClellan&#x27;s troops at various points along the river including Harrison&#x27;s Landing
 which ended in August. However most of the time spent on the river was marked with inactivity and hot weather which had a negative effect on the morale of &quot;Monitor&quot;″s crew. During the long, hot, summer, several crew members became sick and were transferred to Hampton Roads while various officers were replaced including Newton, while Jeffers was replaced by Commander Thomas H. Stevens, Jr. on 15 August. By the end of August, &quot;Monitor&quot; was ordered back to Hampton Roads and dropped anchor nearby the sunken &quot;Cumberland&quot; at Newport News Point on 30 August, much to the approval of the crew. &quot;Monitor&quot;″s sole purpose now was to blockade the James River from any advances made by the newly constructed , an ironclad ram.

===Repairs and refit===

In September Captain John P. Bankhead received orders to take command of &quot;Monitor&quot;, relieving Stevens, and was sent to Hampton Roads to take charge of the vessel. Shortly after Bankhead assumed command, &quot;Monitor&quot;″s engines and boilers were condemned by a board of survey which recommended that they be overhauled completely. On 30 September the ironclad was sent to the Washington Navy Yard for repairs arriving there on 3 October.

Upon arrival at Washington &quot;Monitor&quot; and her crew were greeted by a crowd of thousands of cheering admirers who came to see the ship that &quot;saved the nation&quot;. &quot;Monitor&quot; was now a premier tourist attraction and the crowd was soon allowed on board to tour the vessel. During this time the vessel was picked clean of artifacts for souvenirs by the touring civilians that came aboard. When Stodder and others came to close up the dock and ship one evening Stodder noted, &quot;When we came up to clean that night there was not a key, doorknob, escutcheon – there wasn&#x27;t a thing that hadn&#x27;t been carried away.&quot;

Before &quot;Monitor&quot; was put into dry dock for repairs, Lincoln, Fox, various officials and a few of Worden&#x27;s close friends arrived to ceremoniously review the vessel and pay respect to the crew and former commander Worden, who after a long and partial recovery arrived for the occasion. Entire army regiments were also directed to come by the navy yard and review the ship and honor the crew. &quot;Monitor&quot;″s crew assembled on deck in formation with their officers in front, while Lincoln, Fox and other guests stood near the turret. When Worden, with part of his face blackened from the wounds he received at Hampton Roads, came aboard, the heavy guns in the navy yard were fired in salute. Lincoln came forward and greeted Worden and then introduced him to some of the others. After his formal greeting the crew swarmed around Worden and embraced and shook hands with their former commander and thanked God for his recovery and return. Worden called each of them by name and spoke friendly to and complimented each of them personally. When order was restored the President gave a short speech about Worden&#x27;s career. At Fox&#x27;s request, Worden gave a speech to the gathering about his voyage from New York to Hampton Roads, the trials they were faced with along the way and of the great battle between &quot;Monitor&quot; and &quot;Virginia&quot;, while paying tribute to many of the officers and men involved. In closing he gave special thanks to Ericsson, Lincoln, Welles and all who made construction of &quot;Monitor&quot; possible.

While &quot;Monitor&quot; was undergoing repairs her crew was put aboard and were eventually granted a furlough by Bankhead who himself went on leave. For approximately six weeks the vessel remained in dry dock while her bottom was scraped clean, the engines and boilers were overhauled, the entire vessel was cleaned and painted, and a number of improvements made, including an iron shield around the top of the turret. To make the vessel more seaworthy, a funnel-shaped smokestack was placed over the smoke outlet while taller fresh air vents were installed. The berth deck below was also enlarged and raised by removing some of the side storerooms and placing them below, thus reducing the height of the interior which now barely allowed the crew to stand upright. Several cranes were also added while interior improvements were made making the confining environment more livable. A large blower that operated with its own engine was installed which drew fresh air down through the pilothouse. During this time the two Dahlgren guns were each engraved with large letters, &quot;MONITOR &amp; MERRIMAC – WORDEN&quot; and &quot;MONITOR &amp; MERRIMAC – ERICSSON&quot;, respectively. Additional iron plates were installed covering the dents from the previous battles. Each plate was inscribed with the name of the source from where the shell causing the dent was made. i.e. &quot;Merrimack, Fort Darling&quot;, etc. Stanchions were also installed around the perimeter of the freeboard with a rope strung through each making it safer to walk about the deck amid stormy weather and rough seas. &quot;Monitor&quot; was finally taken out of dry dock on 26 October. By November the ship was fully repaired and ready to return to service.

=== Final voyage ===
On 24 December 1862, orders were issued directing &quot;Monitor&quot; to Beaufort, North Carolina to join and for a joint Army-Navy expedition against Wilmington, North Carolina, where she would join the blockade off Charleston. The orders were received by the crew on Christmas Day, some of whom had been aboard &quot;Monitor&quot; on her harrowing journey from New York to Hampton Roads in March and were not pleased with the prospect of taking to the high seas once again. Dana Greene remarked, &quot;I do not consider this steamer a sea going vessel&quot;.

The crew celebrated Christmas aboard &quot;Monitor&quot; while berthed at Hampton Roads in what was described as a most merry fashion, while many other celebrations were occurring along the shore. The ship&#x27;s cook was paid one dollar to prepare a meal for the crew befitting the day; it was received with mixed opinion. That day, &quot;Monitor&quot; was made ready for sea, her crew under strict orders not to discuss the impending voyage with anyone, but bad weather delayed her departure until 29 December.

While the design of &quot;Monitor&quot; was well-suited for river combat, her low freeboard and heavy turret made her highly unseaworthy in rough waters. Under the command of John P. Bankhead, &quot;Monitor&quot; put to sea on 31 December, under tow from the steamship , as a heavy storm developed off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Using chalk and a blackboard, Bankhead wrote messages alerting &quot;Rhode Island&quot; that if &quot;Monitor&quot; needed help she would signal with a red lantern.

&quot;Monitor&quot; was soon in trouble as the storm increased in ferocity. Large waves were splashing over and completely covering the deck and pilot house so the crew temporarily rigged the wheel atop the turret which was manned by helmsman Francis Butts. Water continued flooding into the vents and ports and the ship began rolling uncontrollably in the high seas. Sometimes she would drop into a wave with such force the entire hull would tremble. Leaks were beginning to appear everywhere. Bankhead ordered the engineers to start the Worthington pumps, which temporarily stemmed the rising waters, but soon &quot;Monitor&quot; was hit by a squall and a series of violent waves and water continued to work its way into the vessel. Right when the Worthington pump could no longer keep pace with the flooding, a call came from the engine room that water was gaining there. Realizing the ship was in serious trouble, Bankhead signaled &quot;Rhode Island&quot; for help and hoisted the red lantern next to &quot;Monitor&quot;″s white running light atop the turret. He then ordered the anchor dropped to stop the ship&#x27;s rolling and pitching with little effect, making it no easier for the rescue boats to get close enough to receive her crew. He then ordered the towline cut and called for volunteers, Stodder, along with crewmates John Stocking, and James Fenwick volunteered and climbed down from the turret, but eyewitnesses said that as soon as they were on the deck Fenwick and Stocking were quickly swept overboard and drowned. Stodder managed to hang onto the safety lines around the deck and finally cut through the towline with a hatchet. At 11:30 pm. Bankhead ordered the engineers to stop engines and divert all available steam to the large Adams centrifugal steam pump; but with reduced steam output from a boiler being fed wet coal, it too was unable to stem the rapidly rising water. After all of the steam pumps had failed, Bankhead ordered some of the crew to man the hand pumps and organized a bucket brigade, but to no avail.

Greene and Stodder were among the last men to abandon ship and remained with Bankhead who was the last surviving man to abandon the sinking &quot;Monitor&quot;. In his official report of &quot;Monitor&quot; to the Navy Department, Bankhead praised Greene and Stodder for their heroic efforts and wrote, &quot;I would beg leave to call the attention of the Admiral and of the Department of the particularly good conduct of Lieutenant Greene and Acting Master Louis N. Stodder, who remained with me until the last, and by their example did much toward inspiring confidence and obedience on the part of the others.&quot;

After a frantic rescue effort, &quot;Monitor&quot; finally capsized and sank, stern first, approximately southeast off Cape Hatteras with the loss of sixteen men, including four officers, some of whom remained in the turret, which detached as the ship capsized. Forty-seven men were rescued by the life boats from &quot;Rhode Island&quot;. Bankhead, Greene and Stodder barely managed to get clear of the sinking vessel and survived the ordeal, but suffered from exposure from the icy winter sea. After his initial recovery, Bankhead filed his official report, as did the commanding officers of the &quot;Rhode Island&quot;, stating officers and men of both &quot;Monitor&quot; and &quot;Rhode Island&quot; did everything within their ability to keep &quot;Monitor&quot; from sinking. The Navy did not find it necessary to commission a board of inquiry to investigate the affair and took no action against Bankhead or any of his officers.

Some time later a controversy emerged over why &quot;Monitor&quot; sank. In the &quot;Army and Navy Journal&quot;, Ericsson accused the crew of drunkenness during the storm, being consequently unable to prevent the vessel from sinking. Stodder vigorously defended the crew and rebuked Ericsson&#x27;s characterization of the crew and events and wrote to Pierce that Ericsson &quot;covers up defects by blaming those that are now dead&quot;, pointing out that there were a number of unavoidable events and circumstances that led to the ship&#x27;s sinking, foremost being the overhang between the upper and lower hulls which came loose and partially separated during the storm from slamming into the violent waves. Stodder&#x27;s account was corroborated by other shipmates.

==Rediscovery==
The Navy tested an &quot;underwater locator&quot; in August 1949 by searching an area south of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse for the wreck of &quot;Monitor&quot;. It found a long object bulky enough to be a shipwreck, in of water that was thought to be &quot;Monitor&quot;, but powerful currents negated attempts by divers to investigate. Retired Rear Admiral Edward Ellsberg proposed using external pontoons to raise the wreck in 1951, the same method of marine salvage he had used on the sunken submarine , for the cost of $250,000. Four years later, Robert F. Marx claimed to have discovered the wreck based on the idea she had drifted into shallow water north of the lighthouse before sinking. Marx said he had dived on the wreck and placed a Coke bottle with his name on it in one of the gun barrels, although he never provided any proof of his story.

Interest in locating the ship revived in the early 1970s and Duke University, the National Geographic Society and the National Science Foundation sponsored an expedition in August 1973 to search for the wreck using a towed sonar system. The Duke team was led by John G. Newton (no known relation to the Isaac Newton that served on the &quot;Monitor&quot;). On 27 August, &quot;Monitor&quot; was discovered almost 111 years after sinking, near Cape Hatteras at depth at coordinates . They sent a camera down to photograph the wreck, but the pictures were so fuzzy as to be useless; on a second attempt the camera snagged something on the wreck and was lost. The sonar images did not match what they expected the wreck to look like until they realized that the sinking vessel had turned over while descending and was resting at the bottom upside down. The team announced their discovery on 8 March 1974. Another expedition was mounted that same month to confirm the discovery and the research submersible &quot;Alcoa Sea Probe&quot; was able to take still photos and video of the wreck that confirmed it was &quot;Monitor&quot;.

These photos revealed that the wreck was disintegrating and the discovery raised another issue. Since the Navy had formally abandoned the wreck in 1953, it could be exploited by divers and private salvage companies as it lay outside North Carolina&#x27;s territorial limits. To preserve the ship, the wreck, and everything around it, a radius was designated as the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary, the first U.S. marine sanctuary, on 30 January 1975. &quot;Monitor&quot; was also designated a National Historic Landmark on 23 June 1986.

In 1977, scientists were finally able to view the wreckage in person as the submersible &quot;Johnson Sea Link&quot; was used to inspect it. The &quot;Sea Link&quot; was able to ferry divers down to the sunken vessel and retrieve small artifacts. U.S. Navy interest in raising the entire ship ended in 1978 when Captain Willard F. Searle Jr. calculated the cost and possible damage expected from the operation: $20 million to stabilize the vessel in place, or as much as $50 million to bring all of it to the surface. Research continued and artifacts continued to be recovered, including the ship&#x27;s anchor in 1983. The growing number of relics required conservation and a proper home so the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in charge of all U.S. marine sanctuaries, selected the Mariners&#x27; Museum on 9 March 1987 after considering proposals from several other institutions.

===Recovery===

Initial efforts in 1995 by Navy and NOAA divers to raise the warship&#x27;s propeller were foiled by an abnormally stormy season off Cape Hatteras. Realizing that raising the whole wreck was impractical for financial reasons as well as the inability to bring up the wreck intact, NOAA developed a comprehensive plan to recover the most significant parts of the ship, namely her engine, propeller, guns, and turret. It estimated that the plan would cost over 20 million dollars to implement over four years. The Department of Defense Legacy Resource Management Program contributed $14.5 million. The Navy divers, mainly from its two Mobile Diving and Salvage Units, would perform the bulk of the work necessary in order to train in deep sea conditions and evaluate new equipment.

Another effort to raise &quot;Monitor&quot;″s propeller was successful on 8 June 1998, although the amount of effort required to work in the difficult conditions off Cape Hatteras was underestimated and the fewer than 30 divers used were nearly overwhelmed. The 1999 dive season was mostly research oriented as divers investigated the wreck in detail, planning how to recover the engine and determining if they could stabilize the hull so that it would not collapse onto the turret. In 2000, the divers shored up the port side of the hull with bags of grout, installed the engine recovery system, an external framework to which the engine would be attached, in preparation for the next season, and made over five times as many dives as they had the previous season.

The 2001 dive season concentrated on raising the ship&#x27;s steam engine and condenser. Hull plates had to be removed to access the engine compartment and both the engine and the condenser had to be separated from the ship, the surrounding wreckage and each other. A Mini Rover ROV was used to provide visibility of the wreck and divers to the support staff above water. The engine was raised on 16 July and the condenser three days later by the crane barge &quot;Wotan&quot;. Saturation diving was evaluated by the Navy that dive season on &quot;Monitor&quot; and proved to be very successful, allowing divers to maximize their time on the bottom. The surface-supplied divers evaluated the use of heliox due to the depth of the wreck. It also proved to be successful once the dive tables were adjusted.

Much like the previous year, the 2002 dive season was dedicated to lifting the turret to the surface. Around 160 divers were assigned to remove the parts of the hull, including the armor belt, that lay on top of the turret using chisels, exothermic cutting torches and hydroblasters. They removed as much of the debris from inside the turret as possible to reduce the weight to be lifted. This was usually concreted coal as one of the ship&#x27;s coal bunkers had ruptured and dumped most of its contents into the turret. The divers prepared the turret roof for the first stage of the lift by excavating underneath the turret and placed steel beams and angle irons to reinforce it for its move onto a lifting platform for the second stage. A large, eight-legged lifting frame, nicknamed the &quot;spider&quot;, was carefully positioned over the turret to move it onto the platform and the entire affair would be lifted by the crane mounted on the &quot;Wotan&quot;. The divers discovered one skeleton in the turret on 26 July before the lift and spent a week carefully chipping about half of it free of the concreted debris; the other half was inaccessible underneath the rear of one of the guns.

With Tropical Storm Cristobal bearing down on the recovery team, and time and money running out, the team made the decision to raise the turret on 5 August 2002, after 41 days of work, and the gun turret broke the surface at 5:30 pm to the cheers of everyone aboard &quot;Wotan&quot; and other recovery ships nearby. As archaeologists examined the contents of the turret after it had been landed aboard &quot;Wotan&quot;, they discovered a second skeleton, but removing it did not begin until the turret arrived at the Mariners&#x27; Museum for conservation. The remains of these sailors were transferred to the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, in the hope that they could be identified.

Only 16 of the crew were not rescued by &quot;Rhode Island&quot; before &quot;Monitor&quot; sank and the forensic anthropologists at JPAC were able to rule out the three missing black crewmen based on the shape of the femurs and skulls. Among the most promising of the 16 candidates were crew members Jacob Nicklis, Robert Williams and William Bryan, but a decade passed without their identities being discovered. On 8 March 2013 their remains were buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.

In 2003 NOAA divers and volunteers returned to the &quot;Monitor&quot; with the goal of obtaining overall video of the site to create a permanent record of the current conditions on the wreck after the turret recovery. Jeff Johnston of the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary (MNMS) also wanted a definitive image of the vessel&#x27;s pilothouse. During the dives, &quot;Monitor&quot;″s iron pilothouse was located near the bow of the vessel and documented for the first time by videographer Rick Allen, of Nautilus Productions, in its inverted position.

Conservation of the propeller was completed nearly three years after its recovery, and it is on display in the Monitor Center at the Mariners&#x27; Museum. As of 2013, conservation of the engine, its components, the turret and the guns continues. The Dahlgren guns were removed from the turret in September 2004 and placed in their own conservation tanks. Among some of the artifacts recovered from the sunken vessel was a red signal lantern, possibly the one used to send a distress signal to &quot;Rhode Island&quot; and the last thing to be seen before &quot;Monitor&quot; sank in 1862 – it was the first object recovered from the site in 1977. A gold wedding band was also recovered from the hand of the skeletal remains of one of &quot;Monitor&quot;″s crew members found in the turret.

Northrop Grumman Shipyard in Newport News constructed a full-scale non-seaworthy static replica of &quot;Monitor&quot;. The replica was laid down in February 2005 and completed just two months later on the grounds of the Mariners&#x27; Museum. The Monitor National Marine Sanctuary conducts occasional dives on the wreck to monitor and record any changes in its condition and its environment.

==Memorials==

The Greenpoint &quot;Monitor Monument&quot; in McGolrick Park, Brooklyn, depicts a sailor from &quot;Monitor&quot; pulling on a capstan. The sculptor Antonio de Filippo was commissioned by the State of New York in the 1930s for a bronze statue to commemorate the Battle of Hampton Roads, John Ericsson, and the crew of the ship. It was dedicated on 6 November 1938. A vandal doused it with white paint on 7 January 2013.

In 1995 the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating USS &quot;Monitor&quot; and CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; depicting the two ships while engaged in their famous battle at Hampton Roads. For an image of the stamp, see footnote link.

The 150th anniversary of the ship&#x27;s loss prompted several events in commemoration. A memorial to &quot;Monitor&quot; and her lost crew members was erected in the Civil War section of Hampton National Cemetery by NOAA&#x27;s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, together with the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and dedicated on 29 December 2012. The Greenpoint Monitor Museum commemorated the ship and her crew with an event on 12 January 2013 at the grave sites of those &quot;Monitor&quot; crew members buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, followed by a service in the cemetery&#x27;s chapel.

New Jersey–based indie rock band Titus Andronicus named their critically acclaimed second album, 2010&#x27;s &quot;The Monitor&quot;, for the ship. Featured on the album&#x27;s sleeve are the crewmen of &quot;Monitor&quot;, taken from a tintype portrait. The album&#x27;s interwoven references to the Civil War include speeches and writings from the period, as well as the side-long closing track &quot;The Battle of Hampton Roads&quot;. The latter refers to the &quot;Monitor&quot;″s encounter with CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; in prominent detail. Singer/guitarist Patrick Stickles commented while making the album that he was inspired by Ken Burns&#x27;s &quot;The Civil War&quot; and the ship itself so much that he decided to name Titus Andronicus&#x27;s second album in its honor.

==Legacy==

&quot;Monitor&quot; gave her name to a new type of mastless, low-freeboard warship that mounted its armament in turrets. Many more were built, including river monitors, and they played key roles in Civil War battles on the Mississippi and James Rivers. The breastwork monitor was developed during the 1860s by Sir Edward Reed, Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy, as an improvement of the basic Monitor design. Reed gave these ships a superstructure to increase seaworthiness and raise the freeboard of the gun turrets so they could be worked in all weathers. The superstructure was armored to protect the bases of the turrets, the funnels and the ventilator ducts in what he termed a breastwork. The ships were conceived as harbor defense ships with little need to leave port. Reed took advantage of the lack of masts and designed the ships with one twin-gun turret at each end of the superstructure, each able to turn and fire in a 270° arc. These ships were described by Admiral George Alexander Ballard as being like &quot;full-armoured knights riding on donkeys, easy to avoid but bad to close with&quot;. Reed later developed the design into the , the first ocean-going turret ships without masts, the direct ancestors of the pre-dreadnought battleships and the dreadnoughts.

==In popular culture==
The battle between the &quot;Monitor&quot; and the Confederate ironclad CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; was reenacted using scale models in the 1936 film &quot;Hearts in Bondage&quot; from Republic Pictures. The battle was also dramatized in the 1991 made-for-television movie &quot;Ironclads&quot;, produced by Ted Turner.

<text>The Office of State Protection (Polish: &quot;Urząd Ochrony Państwa&quot; (, UOP)) was the intelligence agency of Poland from 1990 to 2002, when it was split into two new agencies.

==Foundation==
The UOP was founded on 6 April 1990 as a department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Krzysztof Kozłowski served as the UOP&#x27;s first chief from 1990 to 1992. In 1996 UOP was transformed into a separate government agency under the supervision of the prime minister. It was responsible for intelligence, counter-intelligence and government electronic security, including telephone wiretaps.

==Reasons for formation==
The UOP replaced the communist-era Służba Bezpieczeństwa (SB), I Departament People&#x27;s Republic of Poland Ministry of Internal Affairs – intelligence, II Departament People&#x27;s Republic of Poland Ministry of Internal Affairs – counter-intelligence, whose responsibilities had additionally included the suppression of opposition to the government prior to 1989.

==Agency split==
In June 2002, the agency was split into two separate entities – Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego (&quot;Internal Security Agency&quot;), which deals with internal security of the country, and Agencja Wywiadu (&quot;Intelligence Agency&quot;), which deals with foreign intelligence.

<text>USS &quot;Peleliu&quot; (LHA-5) is a of the United States Navy, named for the Battle of Peleliu of World War II. Entering service in 1980, she has been deployed to the Persian Gulf on several occasions, performed an evacuation of U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, operated with the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce, participated in Pacific Partnership deployments, and provided assistance following the massive floods in Pakistan in 2010. She was decommissioned in San Diego, California on 31 March 2015. She currently rests, out of commission and in reserve, at NAVSEA Inactive Ships On-site Maintenance Office, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in the inactive reserve in case of further need.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Peleliu&quot; was originally going to be named USS &quot;Khe Sanh&quot;, and then USS &quot;Da Nang&quot;. &quot;Peleliu&quot;″s keel was laid down in 1976 at the Litton Industries Ingalls Shipbuilding company in Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was launched on 25 November 1978, sponsored by Peggy Hayward, the wife of the Chief of Naval Operations at that time, Admiral Thomas B. Hayward. &quot;Peleliu&quot; was commissioned on 3 May 1980.

==Operational history==
===1980s===
&quot;Peleliu&quot; immediately steamed southwards and transited the Panama Canal to the Pacific Ocean. She crossed the Equator for the first time on 27 May 1980, setting a new record for time between an American warship&#x27;s commissioning and her crossing over into the Southern Hemisphere. &quot;Peleliu&quot; then steamed to the seaport of Long Beach, California.

Following the 17 October 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, &quot;Peleliu&quot; was one of the 24 U.S. Navy and Military Sealift Command ships that rendered assistance. &quot;Peleliu&quot; provided shelter for 300 victims and provided helicopter support.

===1990s===
&quot;Peleliu&quot; deployed again to the Western Pacific in January 1990. The ship, along with her Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), participated in multinational exercises including Exercise Team Spirit with forces from the Republic of Korea, and Exercise Cobra Gold, in Thailand. &quot;Peleliu&quot; returned home to Naval Station Long Beach in July and later that summer entered the shipyard for an availability period that was scheduled to last nearly a year. The U.S. response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 curtailed the shipyard availability and forced &quot;Peleliu&quot; into an accelerated schedule of pre-deployment training, but she did not deploy for Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm. She eventually departed Long Beach in May 1991, in support of ongoing U.S. operations in the Middle East. In June 1991, while en route to the Persian Gulf, she was diverted from a scheduled port call in Hong Kong to the Philippines, where she participated in the evacuation of the Americans from the Naval Base Subic Bay following the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo. This evacuation included taking most of the patients from the maternity ward at the Subic Bay naval hospital, and hence there were several births on board. This eruption was one of the largest of the past 100 years and covered a large region of the Philippines in volcanic ash and caused extensive damage to American military bases in the area, including Naval Station Subic Bay, Naval Air Station Cubi Point, and Clark Air Force Base.

On returning to her home port at Long Beach Naval Shipyard, &quot;Peleliu&quot; went through an extensive shipyard rehabilitation, including time in the dry dock. She was again underway by May 1992 and going through workups and inspections for her next Western Pacific (WESTPAC) deployment on 21 January 1994. She changed home ports to Naval Station San Diego during this time period. On deploying with the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, and following stops in Pearl Harbor and Singapore, she steamed for Mogadishu, Somalia to participate in Operation Continue Hope and Operation Quick Draw. She arrived on station around 3 March 1994 and spent the next three months supporting operations in the area. VIP visits included Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General John Shalikashvili, COMPHIBGRU THREE, Rear Admiral James B. Perkins III, and CJTF Major General Thomas M. Montgomery, U.S. Army and Brig. General Vercauteren, USMC. While off the coast of Mombasa, she participated in Operation Distant Runner at the border of Rwanda and Burundi. Medical and Dental Civic Action Programs(MEDCAP, DENCAP) were performed in the villages of Kipini and Witu, Kenya, providing medical and dental services to local civilians. Leaving Somalia on 4 June 1994, she steamed to Perth, Australia for a port visit. On 30 June 1994, &quot;Peleliu&quot; slowed her pace home and along with ship&#x27;s company, Marines of 2nd Battalion 5th Marines, paused to honor the fallen off the coast of her name sake Peleliu, where 50 years earlier the Marines of the 1st Marine Division suffered 6,526 casualties with 1,256 killed in action against 10,138 Japanese defenders of which very few were taken alive in the Battle of Peleliu.

&quot;Peleliu&quot; again deployed to the Western Pacifice and to the Persian Gulf in November 1995. The 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit/Special Operations Capable, partially comprising aviation units from the Third Marine Aircraft Wing, (HMM-268 REIN) embarked on board &quot;Peleliu&quot;. The ship eventually arrived in the Persian Gulf in support Operation Southern Watch. &quot;Peleliu&quot; made port calls at Pearl Harbor, Okinawa, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Phuket.

&quot;Peleliu&quot; was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping task force from 26 October to 27 November 1999.

===2000s===

&quot;Peleliu&quot; departed from San Diego in August 2001 with the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit on board for a six-month deployment in the Western Pacific. She was in the port of Darwin, Australia during the September 11 attacks. Following those attacks, &quot;Peleliu&quot; was sent to the North Arabian Sea and, on 26 November 2001, she took the first U.S. Marines to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. After the American Taliban John Walker Lindh was captured in Afghanistan, he was taken aboard &quot;Peleliu&quot; on 14 December 2001. There he was interrogated by a U.S. Marine Corps intelligence team. While he was on board, Lindh signed confessions and he told his interrogators that he was not merely a member of the Taliban, but a full member of Al Qaeda.

Lindh received surgery by the senior surgeon of &quot;Peleliu&quot; to remove a bullet in his leg, and he was also treated for frostbite on his toes.

While on deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, in 2004, and as flagship of Expeditionary Strike Group One, a hostile boat was intercepted by warships at sea in the Indian Ocean, and 15 people were detained. An estimated of hashish was seized by American and Australian warships after the interception of the boat in the North Arabian Sea. During this deployment Peleliu was deployed for nine months and supported air strikes into Iraq. Marines from the embarked Marine Expeditionary Unit participated in ground operations in southern Iraq.

&quot;Peleliu&quot; steamed to support of the Pacific Partnership mission from 23 May through 20 September 2007. This mission included medical, dental, construction, and other humanitarian assistance programs on shore and afloat in the Philippines, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Marshall Islands. The medical personnel on board &quot;Peleliu&quot; included teams from the U.S. Navy and ten other countries, and also from three private assistance organizations.

In 2008, &quot;Peleliu&quot; was sent to the Indian Ocean to support Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and antipiracy operations. On 10 August 2008, &quot;Peleliu&quot; responded to a distress call from a merchant ship, &quot;Gem of Kilakari&quot;, that was being attacked by armed pirates in the Gulf of Aden. That pirate attack was suppressed with no injuries.

===2010s===
In August 2010, &quot;Peleliu&quot; was sent to Port of Karachi, Pakistan, to use 19 of her helicopters for rescue during the massive floods in southern Pakistan, which were the worst in the recorded history of Pakistan up to that point.

During this deployment, &quot;Peleliu&quot;″s commanding officer was relieved of command and reassigned for being &quot;unduly familiar&quot; with several crewmembers. The chief of staff for Expeditionary Strike Group 3, was then assigned as the commanding officer of &quot;Peleliu&quot;.

On 24 November 2010, &quot;Peleliu&quot; returned full circle and she was berthed in the Subic Bay Freeport Zone on her first visit there since the evacuation by the Navy in 1991. That deployment also included port visits to: Naval Base Guam, Apra Harbor, Guam; Darwin, Australia; Dubai, UAE; Phuket, Thailand; and Pearl Harbor, Hawai&#x27;i before returning to her home port in San Diego, California on 18 Dec 2010.

On 17 September 2012, &quot;Peleliu&quot; deployed to the C5F AOR. On 14 May 2013, &quot;Peleliu&quot; returned to her homeport after an eight-month deployment, accompanied by the and the .

In February 2014, the United States Pacific Fleet announced that would be forward deployed to replace the decommissioned in Japan. &quot;Peleliu&quot; deployed to the Western Pacific to mitigate the gap in amphibious presence. The ship visited numerous ports including, Apra Harbor, Guam; Sasebo and Okinawa, Japan; Subic Bay, Philippines and Singapore. During the visits, &quot;Peleliu&quot; competed against partner nation teams during various sporting events and participated in community relations projects.

Over the course of deployment, &quot;Peleliu&quot; transited more than , conducted the safe launch and recovery of more than 50 Landing Craft Utility, 30 Landing Craft Air Cushion, and 25 Amphibious Assault Vehicle ship to shore movements, as well as carrier and deck landing qualifications and operations for U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft squadrons, U.S. Army 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) and foreign aircraft from Colombia, Peru, Mexico and Argentina.

Upon assignment to Seventh Fleet, the ship embarked Commander, Amphibious Force Seventh Fleet, Commander, Amphibious Squadron 11 and 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit and joined to form the &quot;Peleliu&quot; Amphibious Readiness Group (ARG). While deployed, the ARG conducted security and stability operations and exercises throughout the Indo-Asia-Pacific region to include Amphibious Landing Exercise (PHIBLEX) 15 and other maritime cooperation exercises with partner nations.

From June to August 2014, &quot;Peleliu&quot;, with Amphibious Squadron Three, Special Purpose Marine Task Force Three and Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 21 embarked, participated in Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2014 as part of the Third Fleet.

==Decommissioning==
&quot;Peleliu&quot; returned to Naval Base San Diego on 24 December 2014 from her final six-month deployment to the Western Pacific. Upon return, the ship made preparations to decommission in March 2015 after 34 years of service, 17 deployments and more than transited.

&quot;Peleliu&quot; was decommissioned on 31 March 2015 in San Diego. Following her decommissioning, the 820 ft-long vessel was moved to Pearl Harbor to join the reserve fleet. &quot;Peleliu&quot; was placed in an inactive reserve status and moored alongside her sister ship . Peleliu was struck April 30, 2024 and sits moored at NAVSEA Inactive Ships On-site Maintenance Office, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii pending final disposal.

==Ship&#x27;s coat of arms==
The stars across the top of the shield represent the eight Medal of Honor recipients from the Battle of Peleliu Island in 1944. Centered is the large Roman numeral &quot;V&quot;, which represents the hull number of the ship, LHA-5. The four-point star in the &quot;V&quot; identifies the four functions of the landing force, and sustain their operations ashore. In the lower left-hand side of the shield is a ring, which by tradition of heraldry, symbolizes the fifth born. The 1st Marine Division emblem is the constellation Southern Cross with the numeral &#x27;1&#x27; superimposed.

<text>The UIC Franc (code: XFU) was a virtual currency unit used by the International Union of Railways (UIC). It was introduced in 1976 after the Gold Franc was abandoned for this purpose due to instability of the international monetary system, and was replaced by the European Currency Unit on 1 January 1990.

The code XFU was not withdrawn from the ISO-4217 currency list until 2013, despite the UIC franc having long fallen out of use.

<doc id="32210" wikidata="Q863694" url="?curid=32210" title="Subcommittee on International Organizations of the Committee on International Relations">
<text>The Subcommittee on International Organizations of the Committee on International Relations (also known as the Fraser Committee) was a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives which met in 1976 and 1977 and conducted an investigation into the &quot;Koreagate&quot; scandal. It was chaired by Representative Donald M. Fraser of Minnesota. The committee&#x27;s 447-page report, made public on November 29, 1977, reported on plans by the National Intelligence Service (South Korea) (KCIA) to manipulate American institutions to the advantage of South Korean government policies, overtly and covertly.

== Hearings ==
The committee conducted an extensive investigation into South Korea–United States relations, and held a series of hearings. The committee&#x27;s hearings were highly publicized, and the term &quot;Koreagate&quot; began to be used by American news media outlets at the time.

During these hearings, former KCIA director Kim Hyong-uk testified that he had offered favors to Pak Tong-sun in exchange for the latter&#x27;s efforts to lobby in Washington, D.C. Kim also testified that a month before the hearings, South Korean president Park Chung Hee had attempted to dissuade him from testifying, and had ordered his kidnapping or assassination if he proceeded to testify.

Various members of the Unification Church of the United States testified that churchmembers had been involved in attempts to lobby congress. Dan Fefferman, a leader in the Unification Church of the United States, refused to cooperate fully during the hearings.

== Fraser Report ==
The committee made its findings public in what became known as the &quot;Fraser report&quot;. The committee&#x27;s report that there were South Korean plans to plant an intelligence network in the White House and to influence the United States Congress, newsmedia, clergy, and educators. The report found that Korean businessman Tongsun Park had begun lobbying for in 1970, immediately after Nixon withdrew the U.S. Seventh Army division from South Korea.

The committee found that the KCIA was working with Sun Myung Moon, founder of the Unification Church of the United States, and that some church members worked as volunteers in congressional offices. Together they founded the Korean Culture and Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit organization which undertook a public diplomacy campaign for the Republic of Korea. The committee also investigated possible KCIA influence on the Unification movement&#x27;s campaign in support of Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal.

The report of the committee also found that the KCIA planned to grant money to American universities in order to attempt to influence them for political purposes. It also said that the KCIA had harassed and intimidated Korean people living in the United States if they protested against Republic of Korea government policies.

== Aftermath ==
In response to the investigation, the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct filed and heard charges against members of the United States House of Representatives. Congressman Richard T. Hanna was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the United States Government, and was sentenced to serve between 6 and 30 months in prison.

The ethics committee censured Edward R. Roybal for failing to report that he had received a $1,000 gift from Park. Two other congressmen, Charles H. Wilson and John J. McFall were reprimanded. A fourth congressman, Edward J. Patten, was found not guilty. The committee investigated claims that Edward Derwinski had leaked confidential information to South Korean officials, but the inquiry ended inconclusively.

Kim Hyong-uk disappeared in October 1979, and was reportedly assassinated on the orders of Kim Jae-kyu, then-director of the KCIA.

<text>The United States Code (formally The Code of Laws of the United States of America) is the official codification of the general and permanent federal statutes of the United States. It contains 53 titles, which are organized into numbered sections. 

The U.S. Code is published by the U.S. House of Representatives&#x27; Office of the Law Revision Counsel. New editions are published every six years, with cumulative supplements issued each year. The official version of these laws appears in the &quot;United States Statutes at Large&quot;, a chronological, uncodified compilation.

==Codification==

===Process===
The official text of an Act of Congress is that of the &quot;enrolled bill&quot; (traditionally printed on parchment) presented to the President for his signature or disapproval. Upon enactment of a law, the original bill is delivered to the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) within the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). After authorization from the OFR, copies are distributed as &quot;slip laws&quot; (as unbound, individually paginated pamphlets) by the Government Publishing Office (GPO). The OFR assembles annual volumes of the enacted laws and publishes them as the &quot;United States Statutes at Large.&quot; By law, the text of the &quot;Statutes at Large&quot; is &quot;legal evidence&quot; of the laws enacted by Congress. Slip laws are also competent evidence.

The &quot;Statutes at Large&quot;, however, is not a convenient tool for legal research. It is arranged strictly in chronological order; statutes addressing related topics may be scattered across many volumes, and are not consolidated with later amendments. Statutes often repeal or amend earlier laws, and extensive cross-referencing is required to determine what laws are in force at any given time.

The United States Code is the result of an effort to make finding relevant and effective statutes simpler by reorganizing them by subject matter, and eliminating expired and amended sections. The Code is maintained by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel (LRC) of the U.S. House of Representatives. The LRC determines which statutes in the United States Statutes at Large should be codified, and which existing statutes are affected by amendments or repeals, or have simply expired by their own terms. The LRC updates the Code accordingly.

Because of this codification approach, a single named statute (like the Taft–Hartley Act or the Embargo Act) may or may not appear in a single place in the Code. Often, complex legislation bundles a series of provisions together as a means of addressing a social or governmental problem; those provisions often fall in different logical areas of the Code. For example, an Act providing relief for family farms might affect items in Title 7 (Agriculture), Title 26 (Tax), and Title 43 (Public Lands). When the Act is codified, its various provisions might well be placed in different parts of those various Titles. Traces of this process are generally found in the Notes accompanying the &quot;lead section&quot; associated with the popular name, and in cross-reference tables that identify Code sections corresponding to particular Acts of Congress.

Usually, the individual sections of a statute are incorporated into the Code exactly as enacted; however, sometimes editorial changes are made by the LRC (for instance, the phrase &quot;the date of enactment of this Act&quot; is replaced by the actual date). Though authorized by statute, these changes do not constitute positive law.

===Legal status===
The authority for the material in the United States Code comes from its enactment through the legislative process and not from its presentation in the Code. For example, the United States Code omitted for decades, apparently because it was thought to have been repealed. In its 1993 ruling in &quot;U.S. National Bank of Oregon v. Independent Insurance Agents of America&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that 12 U.S.C. § 92 was still valid law.

A positive law title is a title that is itself a federal statute, that is to say that it is one that has been enacted and codified into law by the United States Congress. The title itself has been enacted. By contrast, a non-positive law title is a title that has not been codified into federal law, and is instead merely an editorial compilation of individually enacted federal statutes. 

By law, those titles of the United States Code that have not been enacted into positive law are &quot;&quot;prima facie&quot; evidence&quot; of the law in effect. The &quot;United States Statutes at Large&quot; remains the ultimate authority. If a dispute arises as to the accuracy or completeness of the codification of an unenacted title, the courts will turn to the language in the United States Statutes at Large. In case of a conflict between the text of the Statutes at Large and the text of a provision of the United States Code that has not been enacted as positive law, the text of the Statutes at Large takes precedence.

In contrast, if Congress enacts a particular title (or other component) of the Code into positive law, the enactment repeals all of the previous Acts of Congress from which that title of the Code derives; in their place, Congress gives the title of the Code itself the force of law. This process makes that title of the United States Code &quot;legal evidence&quot; of the law in force. Where a title has been enacted into positive law, a court may neither permit nor require proof of the underlying original Acts of Congress.

The distinction between enacted and unenacted titles is largely academic because the Code is nearly always accurate. The United States Code is routinely cited by the Supreme Court and other federal courts without mentioning this theoretical caveat. On a day-to-day basis, very few lawyers cross-reference the Code to the &quot;Statutes at Large&quot;. Attempting to capitalize on the possibility that the text of the United States Code can differ from the &quot;United States Statutes at Large&quot;, Bancroft-Whitney for many years published a series of volumes known as United States Code Service (USCS), which used the actual text of the &quot;United States Statutes at Large&quot;; the series is now published by the Michie Company after Bancroft-Whitney parent Thomson Corporation divested the title as a condition of acquiring West.

===Uncodified statutes===
Only &quot;general and permanent&quot; laws are codified in the United States Code; the Code does not usually include provisions that apply only to a limited number of people (a private law) or for a limited time, such as most appropriation acts or budget laws, which apply only for a single fiscal year. If these limited provisions are significant, however, they may be printed as &quot;notes&quot; underneath related sections of the Code. The codification is based on the content of the laws, however, not the vehicle by which they are adopted; so, for instance, if an appropriations act contains substantive, permanent provisions (as is sometimes the case), these provisions will be incorporated into the Code even though they were adopted as part of a non-permanent enactment.

==Versions and history==

===Early compilations===

Early efforts at codifying the Acts of Congress were undertaken by private publishers; these were useful shortcuts for research purposes, but had no official status. Congress undertook an official codification called the &quot;Revised Statutes of the United States&quot; approved June 22, 1874, for the laws in effect as of December 1, 1873. Congress re-enacted a corrected version in 1878. The 1874 version of the Revised Statutes were enacted as positive law, but the 1878 version was not and subsequent enactments of Congress were not incorporated into the official code, so that over time researchers once again had to delve through many volumes of the &quot;Statutes at Large&quot;.

According to the preface to the Code, &quot;From 1897 to 1907 a commission was engaged in an effort to codify the great mass of accumulating legislation. The work of the commission involved an expenditure of over $300,000, but was never carried to completion.&quot; Only the Criminal Code of 1909 and the Judicial Code of 1911 were enacted. In the absence of a comprehensive official code, private publishers once again collected the more recent statutes into unofficial codes. The first edition of the &quot;United States Code&quot; (published as Statutes at Large Volume 44, Part 1) includes cross-reference tables between the USC and two of these unofficial codes, &quot;United States Compiled Statutes Annotated&quot; by West Publishing Co. and &quot;Federal Statutes Annotated&quot; by Edward Thompson Co.

===Official code===
During the 1920s, some members of Congress revived the codification project, resulting in the approval of the United States Code by Congress in 1926.

The official version of the Code is published by the LRC (Office of the Law Revision Counsel) as a series of paper volumes. The first edition of the Code was contained in a single bound volume; today, it spans several large volumes. Normally, a new edition of the Code is issued every six years, with annual cumulative supplements identifying the changes made by Congress since the last &quot;main edition&quot; was published.

The official code was last printed in 2018.

===Digital and Internet versions===
Both the LRC and the GPO offer electronic versions of the Code to the public. The LRC electronic version used to be as much as 18 months behind current legislation, but as of 2014 it is one of the most current versions available online. The United States Code is available from the LRC at uscode.house.gov in both HTML and XML bulk formats. The &quot;United States Legislative Markup&quot; (USLM) schema of the XML was designed to be consistent with the Akoma Ntoso project (from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs) XML schema, and the OASIS &quot;LegalDocML&quot; technical committee standard will be based upon Akoma Ntoso.

A number of other online versions are freely available, such as Cornell&#x27;s Legal Information Institute.

===Annotated codes===
Practicing lawyers who can afford them almost always use an annotated version of the Code from a private company. The two leading annotated versions are the &quot;United States Code Annotated&quot;, abbreviated as USCA, and the &quot;United States Code Service&quot;, abbreviated as USCS. The USCA is published by West (part of Thomson Reuters), and USCS is published by LexisNexis (part of Reed Elsevier), which purchased the publication from the Lawyers Co-operative Publishing Co. in 1997 as a result of an antitrust settlement when the parent of Lawyers Co-operative Publishing acquired West. These annotated versions contain notes following each section of the law, which organize and summarize court decisions, law review articles, and other authorities that pertain to the code section, and may also include uncodified provisions that are part of the Public Laws. The publishers of these versions frequently issue supplements (in hard copy format as pocket parts) that contain newly enacted laws, which may not yet have appeared in an official published version of the Code, as well as updated secondary materials such as new court decisions on the subject. When an attorney is viewing an annotated code on an online service, such as Westlaw or LexisNexis, all the citations in the annotations are hyperlinked to the referenced court opinions and other documents.

==Organization==
===Divisions===
The Code is divided into 53 titles (listed below), which deal with broad, logically organized areas of legislation. Titles may optionally be divided into subtitles, parts, subparts, chapters, and subchapters. All titles have sections (represented by a §) as their basic coherent units, and sections are numbered sequentially across the entire title without regard to the previously-mentioned divisions of titles. Sections are often divided into (from largest to smallest) subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, clauses, subclauses, items, and subitems. Congress, by convention, names a particular subdivision of a section according to its largest element. For example, &quot;subsection (c)(3)(B)(iv)&quot; is not a subsection but a clause, namely clause (iv) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) of subsection (c); if the identity of the subsection and paragraph were clear from the context, one would refer to the clause as &quot;subparagraph (B)(iv)&quot;.

Not all titles use the same series of subdivisions above the section level, and they may arrange them in different order. For example, in Title 26 (the tax code), the order of subdivision runs: Title – Subtitle – Chapter – Subchapter – Part – Subpart – Section – Subsection – Paragraph – Subparagraph – Clause – Subclause – Item – Subitem.

The &quot;Section&quot; division is the core organizational component of the Code, and the &quot;Title&quot; division is always the largest division of the Code. Which intermediate levels between Title and Section appear, if any, varies from Title to Title. For example, in Title 38 (Veteran&#x27;s Benefits), the order runs Title – Part – Chapter – Subchapter – Section.

The word &quot;title&quot; in this context is roughly akin to a printed &quot;volume&quot;, although many of the larger titles span multiple volumes. Similarly, no particular size or length is associated with other subdivisions; a section might run several pages in print, or just a sentence or two. Some subdivisions within particular titles acquire meaning of their own; for example, it is common for lawyers to refer to a &quot;Chapter 11 bankruptcy&quot; or a &quot;Subchapter S corporation&quot; (often shortened to &quot;S corporation&quot;).

In the context of federal statutes, the word &quot;title&quot; has two slightly different meanings. It can refer to the highest subdivision of the Code itself, but it can also refer to the highest subdivision of an Act of Congress which subsequently becomes part of an existing title of the Code. For example, when Americans refer to Title VII, they are usually referring to the seventh title of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That Act is actually codified in Title 42 of the United States Code, not Title 7.

The intermediate subdivisions between title and section are helpful for reading the Code (since Congress uses them to group together related sections), but they are not needed to cite a section in the Code. To cite any particular section, it is enough to know its title and section numbers. According to one legal style manual, a sample citation would be &quot;Privacy Act of 1974, (2006)&quot;, read aloud as &quot;Title five, United States Code, section five fifty-two A&quot; or simply &quot;five USC five fifty-two A&quot;.

Some section numbers consist of awkward-sounding combinations of letters, hyphens, and numerals. They are especially prevalent in Title 42. A typical example is the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), which is codified in Chapter 21B of Title 42 at through . In the case of RFRA, Congress was trying to squeeze a new act into Title 42 between Chapter 21A (ending at ) and Chapter 22 (beginning at ). The underlying problem is that the original drafters of the Code in 1926 failed to foresee the explosive growth of federal legislation directed to &quot;The Public Health and Welfare&quot; (as Title 42 is literally titled) and did not fashion statutory classifications and section numbering schemes that could readily accommodate such expansion. Title 42 grew in size from 6 chapters and 106 sections in 1926 to over 160 chapters and 7,000 sections as of 1999.

===Titles===

Titles that have been enacted into positive law are indicated by blue shading below with the year of last enactment. 

===Proposed titles===
The Office of Law Revision Counsel (LRC) has produced draft text for three additional titles of federal law. The subject matter of these proposed titles exists today in one or several existing titles.
The LRC announced an &quot;editorial reclassification&quot; of the federal laws governing voting and elections that went into effect on September 1, 2014. This reclassification involved moving various laws previously classified in Titles 2 and 42 into a new Title 52, which has not been enacted into positive law.

===Treatment of repealed laws===
When sections are repealed, their text is deleted and replaced by a note summarizing what used to be there. This is so that lawyers reading old cases can understand what the cases are talking about. As a result, some portions of the Code consist entirely of empty chapters full of historical notes. For example, Title 8, Chapter 7 is labeled &quot;Exclusion of Chinese&quot;. This contains historical notes relating to the Chinese Exclusion Act, which is no longer in effect.

==Number and growth of federal crimes==
There are conflicting opinions on the number of federal crimes, but many have argued that there has been explosive growth and it has become overwhelming. In 1982, the U.S. Department of Justice could not come up with a number, but estimated 3,000 crimes in the United States Code. In 1998, the American Bar Association said that it was likely much higher than 3,000, but did not give a specific estimate. In 2008, the Heritage Foundation published a report that put the number at a minimum of 4,450. When staff for a task force of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee asked the Congressional Research Service (CRS) to update its 2008 calculation of criminal offenses in the USC in 2013, the CRS responded that they lack the manpower and resources to accomplish the task.

==Related codifications==
The Code generally contains only those Acts of Congress, or statutes, designated as public laws. The Code itself does not include Executive Orders or other executive-branch documents related to the statutes, or rules promulgated by the courts. However, such related material is sometimes contained in notes to relevant statutory sections or in appendices. The Code does not include statutes designated at enactment as private laws, nor statutes that are considered temporary in nature, such as appropriations. These laws are included in the &quot;Statutes at Large&quot; for the year of enactment.

Regulations promulgated by executive agencies through the rulemaking process set out in the Administrative Procedure Act are published chronologically in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; and then codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Similarly, state statutes and regulations are often codified into state-specific codes.

<text>The United States Armed Forces are the military forces of the United States. There are six &quot;armed forces&quot; - military branches - the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, and Coast Guard listed in U.S. Federal law (United States Code). The armed forces are part of the federal government of the United States. Also, they are part of the eight uniformed services of the United States, along with the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps.
Each of the different military services is assigned a role and domain. The Army conducts land operations. The Navy and Marine Corps conduct maritime operations, the Marine Corps specializing in amphibious and maritime littoral operations primarily for supporting the Navy. The Air Force conducts air operations. The Space Force conducts space operations. The Coast Guard is unique in that it specializes in maritime operations and is also a law enforcement agency.

From their inception during the American Revolutionary War, the Army and the Navy, and later the other services, have played a decisive role in the country&#x27;s history. They helped forge a sense of national unity and identity through victories in the early-19th-century First and Second Barbary Wars. They played a critical role in the territorial evolution of the U.S., including the American Civil War. The National Security Act of 1947 created the Department of Defense or DoD, after a short period being called the National Military Establishment) headed by the secretary of defense, superior to the service secretaries. It also created both the U.S. Air Force and National Security Council; in 1949, an amendment to the act merged the cabinet-level departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force into the DoD.

The president of the U.S. is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and forms military policy with the DoD and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), both federal executive departments, acting as the principal organs by which military policy is carried out.

The personnel size of the six armed forces together ranks them among the world&#x27;s largest state armed forces. They draw their personnel from a large pool of professional volunteers. The U.S. has used military conscription, but not since 1973. The Selective Service System retains the power to conscript males, requiring the registration of all male citizens and residents of the U.S. between the ages of 18 and 25.

The U.S. Armed Forces are considered the world&#x27;s most powerful military, especially since the end of the Cold War. The military expenditure of the U.S. was US$916 billion in 2023, the highest in the world, accounting for 37% of the world&#x27;s defense expenditures. The U.S. Armed Forces has significant capabilities in both defense and power projection due to its large budget, resulting in advanced and powerful technologies which enable widespread deployment of the force around the world, including around 800 military bases outside the U.S. 

The U.S. Air Force is the world&#x27;s largest air force, followed by the U.S. Army Aviation Branch. The U.S. Naval Air Forces is the fourth-largest air arm in the world and is the largest naval aviation service, while U.S. Marine Corps Aviation is the world&#x27;s seventh-largest air arm. The U.S. Navy is the world&#x27;s largest navy by tonnage. The U.S. Coast Guard is the world&#x27;s 12th-largest maritime force.

==History==
The history of the U.S. Armed Forces dates back to 14 June 1775, with the creation of the Continental Army, even before the Declaration of Independence marked the establishment of the United States. The Continental Navy, established on 13 October 1775, and Continental Marines, established on 10 November 1775, were created in close succession by the Second Continental Congress in order to defend the new nation against the British Empire in the American Revolutionary War.

These forces demobilized in 1784 after the Treaty of Paris ended the Revolutionary War. The Congress of the Confederation created the current United States Army on 3 June 1784. The United States Congress created the current United States Navy on 27 March 1794 and the current United States Marine Corps on 11 July 1798. All three services trace their origins to their respective Continental predecessors. The 1787 adoption of the Constitution gave Congress the power to &quot;raise and support armies,&quot; to &quot;provide and maintain a navy&quot;, and to &quot;make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces&quot;, as well as the power to declare war. The President of the United States is the United States Armed Forces&#x27; commander-in-chief.

The United States Coast Guard traces its origin to the formation of the Revenue Cutter Service on 4 August 1790, which merged with the United States Life-Saving Service on 28 January 1915 to establish the Coast Guard. The United States Air Force was established as an independent service on 18 September 1947; it traces its origin to the formation of the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps, which was formed 1 August 1907 and was part of the Army Air Forces before being recognized as an independent service in the National Security Act of 1947. 

The United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps was formerly considered to be a branch of the United States Armed Forces from 29 July 1945 until 3 July 1952, and is now one of the eight uniformed services of the United States. Should it be called into active duty again, it would constitute a seventh branch of the Armed Forces.

The United States Space Force was established as an independent service on 20 December 2019. It is the sixth branch of the U.S. military and the first new branch in 72 years. The origin of the Space Force can be traced back to the Air Force Space Command, which was formed 1 September 1982 and was a major command of the United States Air Force.

The U.S. Congressional Research Office annually publishes a &quot;List of Notable Deployments of U.S. Military Forces Overseas&quot; since 1798.

==Structure==
Presidential command over the U.S. Armed Forces is established in Article II in the Constitution whereby the president is named as the &quot;Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States.&quot; The United States Armed Forces are split between two cabinet departments, with the Department of Defense serving as the primary cabinet department for military affairs and the Department of Homeland Security responsible for administering the United States Coast Guard.

The military chain of command flows from the President of the United States to the secretary of defense (for services under the Defense Department) or secretary of homeland security (for services under the Department of Homeland Security), ensuring civilian control of the military. Within the Department of Defense, the military departments (Department of the Army, United States Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force) are civilian led entities that oversee the coequal military service branches organized within each department. The military departments and services are responsible for organizing, training, and equipping forces, with the actual chain of command flowing through the unified combatant commands.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff, although outside the operational chain of command, is the senior-most military body of the Department of Defense. It is led by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is the military head of the armed forces and principal advisor to the president and secretary of defense on military matters. Their deputy is the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Other members include the chief of staff of the Army, commandant of the Marine Corps, chief of naval operations, chief of staff of the Air Force, chief of space operations, and the chief of the National Guard Bureau. The commandant of the Coast Guard is not an official member of the Joint Chiefs, but sometimes attends meetings as one of the military service chiefs. The senior enlisted advisor to the chairman is the most senior enlisted member in the United States Armed Forces.

The president of the United States, the secretary of defense, the secretary of Homeland Security and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are members of the United States National Security Council, which advises the president on national security, military, and foreign policy matters. The national security advisor, the homeland security advisor, and the deputy national security advisor may also be members of the United States Armed Forces. The National Security Council Deputies Committee also includes the deputy secretary of defense, deputy secretary of homeland security, and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Military leadership, including the secretary of defense, the secretary of Homeland Security, and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also sit on the National Space Council.

===Unified combatant commands===
Unified combatant commands are joint military commands consisting of forces from multiple military departments, with their chain of command flowing from the president, to the secretary of defense, to the commanders of the combatant commands. Each service organizes, trains, and equips forces that are then presented to the unified combatant commands through service component commands. Special Operations Command and Cyber Command also present theater special operations commands or joint force headquarters – cyber to other combatant commanders. Army components are typically dual-hatted as the joint force land component, Navy components are typically dual-hatted as the joint force maritime component, and Air Force components are typically dual-hatted as the joint force air component, with the theater special operations command dual-hatted as the joint force special operations component, and Space Force component typically dual-hatted as the joint force space component.

===Combat support agencies===

Combat support agencies are Department of Defense agencies with combat support missions that service operating forces planning or conducting military operations. This includes support during conflict or in the conduct of other military activities related to countering threats to U.S. national security. This mission is focused on providing support to echelons at the CCMD level and below and may not encompass the full scope of the CSA&#x27;s mission.

==Service branches==
The United States Armed Forces is composed of six coequal military service branches. Five of the branches, the United States Army, United States Marine Corps, United States Navy, United States Air Force, and United States Space Force, are part of the Department of Defense. 

The United States Coast Guard is normally under the Department of Homeland Security, but may be transferred to the Department of Defense&#x27;s Department of the Navy (which is the civilian entity that oversees the coequal U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy) at the direction of the President or Congress. 

With the exception of the Coast Guard, the military services only organize, train, and equip forces. The unified combatant commands are responsible for operational control of non-service retained forces.

Each of the different military services is assigned a role and domain. The U.S. Army conducts land operations, while the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps conduct maritime operations, with the Marine Corps specializing in amphibious and maritime littoral operations in support of the Navy. The U.S. Air Force conducts air operations, while the U.S. Space Force conducts space operations. 

The U.S. Coast Guard is unique in that it is a military branch specializing in maritime operations and also a law enforcement agency.

===U.S. Army===

The United States Army (USA) is the United States Armed Forces&#x27; land force and is the largest and oldest service. Originally established in 1775 as the Continental Army, it consists of one million soldiers across the Regular Army, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard. The Army serves as the Armed Forces principal land service, responsible for conducting land warfare operations.

The U.S. Army is organized under the Department of the Army, which is a military department under the leadership of the secretary of the Army and under secretary of the Army. The U.S. Army itself is led by the chief of staff of the Army and vice chief of staff of the Army, both generals who are advised by the sergeant major of the Army.

The Army&#x27;s primary responsibility is to conduct prompt and sustained land combat as part of the joint force. Army landpower focuses on destroying an enemy&#x27;s armed forces, occupying its territory, and breaking the will of an adversary.

The five core competencies of the Army are:
* Prompt and sustained land combat
* Combined arms operations:
** Combined arms maneuver and wide area security
** Armored and mechanized operations
** Airborne and air assault operations
* Special operations
* Set and sustain the theater for the joint force
* Integrate national, multinational, and joint power on land

The thirteen specified functions of the Army are:
#Conduct prompt and sustained combined arms combat operations on land in all environments and types of terrain, to include complex urban environments, in order to defeat enemy ground forces, and seize, occupy, and defend land areas.
#Conduct air and missile defense to support joint campaigns and assist in achieving air superiority. This is conducted by the Army&#x27;s Air Defense Artillery Branch, specifically by the 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, 32nd Army Air and Missile Defense Command, 94th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, 263rd Army Air and Missile Defense Command, and Army Space and Missile Defense Command.
#Conduct airborne and air assault, and amphibious operations. The Army has primary responsibility for the development of airborne doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Army airborne and air assault operations are conducted by the XVIII Airborne Corps, 11th Airborne Division, 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division, and the 173rd Airborne Brigade.
#Conduct civil affairs operations. Civil affairs operations are conducted by the United States Army Special Operations Command, predominantly under United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command and the 95th Civil Affairs Brigade.
#Conduct riverine operations.
#Occupy territories abroad and provide for the initial establishment of a military government pending transfer of this responsibility to other authorities.
#Interdict enemy sea power, space power, air power, and communications through operations on and from the land.
#Provide logistics to joint operations and campaigns, including joint over-the-shore and intra-theater transport of time-sensitive, mission-critical personnel and materiel. This is primarily conducted through the Army Logistics Branch, including the Quartermaster Corps, Ordnance Corps, Transportation Corps, and through Army Materiel Command&#x27;s Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command.
#Provide support to space operations to enhance joint campaigns, in coordination with the other military services (primarily the United States Space Force), combatant commands (primarily United States Space Command), and other U.S. government departments and agencies. Army space operations are conducted by Army Space and Missile Defense Command.
#Conduct authorized civil works programs, to include projects for the improvement of navigation, flood control, beach erosion control, and other water resource developments in the United States, its territories, and its possessions, and conduct other civil activities prescribed by law. These are conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers.
#Provide intra-theater aeromedical evacuation. These missions are flown by the Army Medical Service Corps and Army Aviation Branch.
#Conduct reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition.
#Operate land lines of communication. This is primarily conducted through the Transportation Corps and Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command.

====Infantry====

The Infantry Branch forms the core of the service&#x27;s land combat power. U.S. Army infantry are generally equipped with the M4 carbine and M249 light machine gun, which will be replaced by the XM7 rifle and XM250.

Infantry is a core part of the Army&#x27;s Brigade Combat Teams. The most numerous variant, the Infantry Brigade Combat Team, comprises light infantry battalions who fight on foot. Infantry Brigade Combat Teams of the 82nd Airborne Division are air assault capable, with infantry soldiers being transported by U.S. Army Aviation UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47 Chinook helicopters. Infantry Brigade Combat Teams of the 11th Airborne Division, 82nd Airborne Division, and 173rd Airborne Brigade are capable of airborne operations, in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s transport aircraft. Finally, Infantry Brigade Combat Teams assigned to the 10th Mountain Division specialize in mountain warfare. Standard Infantry Brigade Combat Teams are assigned to the 25th Infantry Division, which offers additional training in jungle warfare.

Armored Brigade Combat Teams comprise mechanized infantry battalions mounted in the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. Divisions with Armored Brigade Combat Teams include the 1st Infantry Division, 3rd Infantry Division, 4th Infantry Division, 1st Armored Division, and 1st Cavalry Division. Stryker Brigade Combat Teams are centered around Stryker infantry battalions operating out of the Stryker. Divisions with Stryker Brigade Combat Teams include the 2nd Infantry Division, 4th Infantry Division, 11th Airborne Division, 2nd Cavalry Regiment, and 3rd Cavalry Regiment.

United States Army Rangers with the 75th Ranger Regiment are an elite special operations infantry force in the United States Army Special Operations Command, specializing in air assault and airborne infiltration methods. The three primary missions of the 75th Ranger Regiment are special operations raids, forcible entry operations, such as an airfield seizure to enable the Air Force to bring in more forces, and special reconnaissance. As a special operations force, Army Rangers are generally better equipped than standard infantry, utilizing the FN SCAR rifle.

====Army Special Forces====

Army Special Forces, commonly known as Green Berets after their iconic headgear, are among the most elite soldiers in the Army. Special Forces conduct:

*counterinsurgency distinguishing between civilians and enemy combatants while assisting with the stabilization, defense, and training of developing countries facing insurgent threats.
*direct action seizing, capturing, recovering, or destroying enemy material; or utilizing quick strikes to recover personnel.
*foreign internal defense training and equipping foreign allied military forces to defend against insurgency, subversion, terrorism, and other security threats.
*special reconnaissance executing surveillance in hostile, denied, or diplomatically- or politically-sensitive environments to collect or verify information of strategic significance.
*unconventional warfare enabling a resistance movement or insurgency to coerce, disrupt, or overthrow a government or occupying power by operating through or with an underground force in a denied area.
Army Special Forces are trained in military free-fall parachuting and combat diver skillsets. They are considered the most versatile special operations force in the entire world, operating as a multi-purpose force since 1952.

====Armor and Cavalry====

The Armor Branch traces its history back to the United States Cavalry and are responsible for tank and cavalry reconnaissance operations.

The U.S. Army fields the M1 Abrams main battle tank in Armored Battalions as part of Armored Brigade Combat Teams across the 1st Armored Division, 1st Cavalry Division, 1st Infantry Division, 3rd Infantry Division, and the 4th Infantry Division. Each Armored Brigade Combat Team also possesses a cavalry squadron equipped with M2 Bradleys for scouting and security. Stryker Brigade Combat Teams from the 2nd Infantry Division, 4th Infantry Division, 11th Airborne Division, 2nd Cavalry Regiment, and 3rd Cavalry Regiment have a cavalry squadron equipped with Strykers. Infantry Brigade Combat Teams from the 10th Mountain Division, 11th Airborne Division, 25th Infantry Division, 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division, and 173rd Airborne Brigade have a cavalry squadron equipped with the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle.

====Field Artillery====

The Field Artillery&#x27;s mission is to destroy, suppress or neutralize the enemy by cannon, rocket or missile fire. Rocket systems include the M142 HIMARS and M270 multiple launch rocket system, which are corps-level assets found in field artillery brigades. Towed artillery includes the M119 howitzer in infantry brigade combat teams and the M777 howitzer found in both infantry and Stryker brigade combat teams. The M109 self-propelled howitzer is utilized in armored brigade combat teams.

During the Cold War, Army field artillery was responsible for the service&#x27;s ballistic missile programs, including the PGM-11 Redstone, which was the first large ballistic missile in the U.S. arsenal, the MGM-31 Pershing, and the Pershing II. In 2023, the Army is intending to field the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon and has reestablished larger artillery formations like the 56th Artillery Command.

====Air Defense Artillery====

The Air Defense Artillery is responsible for defending geopolitical assets and providing maneuver forces with the freedom to move on the battlefield by deterring the enemy and destroying aerial threats, missile attacks, and surveillance platforms. Weapons employed by Air Defense Artillery include the FIM-92 Stinger man-portable air-defense system, AN/TWQ-1 Avenger for short range air defense, and the counter rocket, artillery, and mortar 20mm gun system. The Iron Dome provides air defense against rockets, artillery, mortars, missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The MIM-104 Patriot is capable of defeating a wide range of threats including aircraft, helicopters, UAVs, ballistic and cruise missiles, and Weapons of Mass Destruction.

The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense protects strategic critical assets by conducting long-range endo-and-exo-atmospheric engagements of ballistic missiles using the world&#x27;s largest air-transportable X-band radar. The Ground-Based Midcourse Defense is an anti-ballistic missile system operated by Army Space and Missile Defense Command to defend the United States homeland against an intercontinental ballistic missile attack. Major Air Defense Artillery units include the 32nd Army Air and Missile Defense Command and Army Space and Missile Defense Command&#x27;s 100th Missile Defense Brigade.

Air Defense Artillery has an extremely close relationship with the Air Force through its Air and Missile Defense Commands and the Space Force through Army Space and Missile Defense Command, given their shared missile defense and space roles. In 1962, Air Defense Artillery achieved the first intercept of a ballistic missile with a nuclear-tipped Nike Zeus and operated the Nike Zeus as an anti-satellite weapon after completing a successful intercept in 1963.

====Army Aviation====

Army Aviation, distinct from the U.S. Air Force and its predecessors, began as part of the field artillery in 1942. Small spotter planes were used to spot for artillery and naval bombardment, as well as to perform observation. These few aircraft formed the core of Army Aviation once the U.S. Air Force gained independence. In 1983, the Army created the Aviation Branch, for the first time since the Air Force&#x27;s independence consolidating aviation under a single organization.

The mission of Army Aviation is to find, fix and destroy any enemy through fire and maneuver and to provide combat support and combat service support in coordinated operations as an integral member of the combined arms team. Major aircraft include the AH-64 Apache, which serves as the Army&#x27;s attack helicopter, the UH-60 Black Hawk, and the CH-47 Chinook for troop and cargo transport. Army Aviation also flies the MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone.

A specialized unit within Army Aviation, the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) serves as a special operations unit and operates modified variants of the MH-60 Black Hawk, MH-47 Chinook, and the MH-6 Little Bird.

====Army commands====
The U.S. Army is organized into four major Army Commands, nine Army Service Component Commands which serve as the Army component and joint force land component commanders for the unified combatant commands, and thirteen direct reporting units.

===U.S. Marine Corps===

The United States Marine Corps (USMC) serves as the U.S. Armed Forces&#x27; naval land force, responsible for executing amphibious warfare and operating in the maritime littorals in support of the U.S. Navy. Originally established in 1775 as the Continental Marines, the Marine Corps consists of the Regular Marine Corps and the Marine Corps Reserve. The Marine Corps maintains a very close relationship with the U.S. Navy, its sister service in the Department of the Navy. Although the Marine Corps has previously operated as an independent land force alongside the Army, its primary purpose is to serve as part of a unified naval service alongside the Navy in the maritime domain.

The U.S. Marine Corps is organized under the Department of the Navy, which is a military department under the leadership of the secretary of the Navy and the under secretary of the Navy. The U.S. Marine Corps itself is led by the commandant of the Marine Corps and the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, both generals who are advised by the sergeant major of the Marine Corps.

The Marine Corps statutory mission is outlined in and as originally introduced under the National Security Act of 1947, with its three primary areas of responsibility including:
* Seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and other land operations to support naval campaigns;
* Development of tactics, technique, and equipment used by amphibious landing forces in coordination with the Army and Air Force; and
* Such other duties as the president or Department of Defense may direct.

The seven specified functions of the Marine Corps are:
#Seize and defend advanced naval bases or lodgments to facilitate subsequent joint operations.
#Provide close air support for ground forces.
#Conduct land and air operations essential to the prosecution of a naval campaign or as directed.
#Conduct complex expeditionary operations in the urban littorals and other challenging environments.
#Conduct amphibious operations, including engagement, crisis response, and power projection operations to assure access. The Marine Corps has primary responsibility for the development of amphibious doctrine, tactics, techniques, and equipment.
#Conduct security and stability operations and assist with the initial establishment of a military government pending transfer of responsibility to other authorities.
#Provide security detachments and units for service on armed vessels of the Navy, provide protection of naval property at naval stations and bases, provide security at designated U.S. embassies and consulates, and perform other such duties as the president or secretary of defense may direct. These additional duties may not detract from or interfere with the operations for which the Marine Corps is primarily organized.

Marine Corps Security Force Regiment is responsible for supporting the Navy with Marine security operations, while the Marine Security Guard protects embassies and consulates of the United States Department of State.

====Fleet Marine Force====

The combat power of the Marine Corps is centralized in the Fleet Marine Force (FMF), which itself is organized into Fleet Marine Force Atlantic, to support the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Fleet Forces Command, and Fleet Marine Force Pacific, which supports the U.S. Navy&#x27;s U.S. Pacific Fleet.

The basic Marine Corps unit for conducting operations is the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), which combines Marine Corps and Navy land, air, sea, and cyberspace capabilities into a single command. There are three size variants of a Marine Air-Ground Task Force, but each consists of a command element, ground combat element, aviation combat element, and logistics combat element.

A Marine ground combat element (GCE) is centered around Marine infantry, typically armed with a M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle. Unlike the Army, the Marine Corps does not train its own combat medics, relying on the Navy to provide hospital corpsmen. These infantry units are supported by Marine Corps combat engineers, who conduct engineer reconnaissance, obstacle system emplacement, and breaching operations; and Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance teams. While the Marine Corps no longer operates its own tanks, opting to request support from the Army if needed, it maintains Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalions which operate the LAV-25 amphibious armored reconnaissance vehicle. Assault Amphibian Battalions operate the Assault Amphibious Vehicle and Amphibious Combat Vehicle, which enable the ground combat element to conduct amphibious landing operations. Marine Corps artillery operates the M777 howitzer and the M142 HIMARS, both supporting the ground combat element and the Navy at sea by striking enemy ships.

The Marine aviation combat element (ACE) is the operational arm of Marine Corps Aviation, working to support the ground combat element. The F-35B Lightning II and AV-8B Harrier II are flown off Navy amphibious assault ships, while the F-35C Lightning II and F/A-18 Hornet are flown off Navy carriers by Marine Corps pilots. The Marine Corps also operates the KC-130J to serve as a tanker and tactical airlift platform. The UH-1Y Venom helicopter provides the Marine Corps with light transport and attack, while the AH-1Z Viper is a dedicated attack helicopter. Medium-lift squadrons fly the MV-22 Osprey, while heavy-lift squadrons use the CH-53K King Stallion. The Marine Corps has also begun flying unmanned aerial vehicles, such as the MQ-9 Reaper and MQ-8 Fire Scout. Notably, the aviation combat element also includes Low-Altitude Air Defense Battalions, which employ the FIM-92 Stinger surface-to-air missile.

The smallest MAGTF is the Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), which is typically forward deployed on a Navy ship. Commanded by a colonel, a Marine Expeditionary Unit consist of 2,200 marines split across a battalion landing team (ground combat element), a composite helicopter squadron (aviation combat element), and a combat logistics element (logistics element). Marine Expeditionary Units are supplied for 15 days. Forward deployed Marine Expeditionary Units are often embarked on Navy amphibious assault ships as part of an amphibious ready group.

The mid-sized MAGTF is the Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), which is organized for specific missions. Commanded by a brigadier general, Marine Expeditionary Brigades consist of 4,000 to 16,000 marines across a Regimental-sized ground combat element, a Marine Aircraft Group, and a Combat Logistics Regiment. Marine Expeditionary Brigades are supplied for 30 days and offer increased firepower and airpower over the Marine Expeditionary Unit.

The largest MAGTF is the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), which is the primary warfighting force for larger operations. A Marine Expeditionary Force is commanded by a lieutenant general and consists of 46,000 to 90,000 marines. Currently there are only three Marine Expeditionary Forces, each with its own Marine Division, Marine Aircraft Wing, Marine Logistics Group, and Marine Expeditionary Force Information Group. Marine Expeditionary Forces are supplied for 60 days. Certain elements are held at the Marine Expeditionary Force level, such as Force Reconnaissance. The MEF Information Group (MIG) also provides a number of functions such as the intelligence battalion; radio battalion which conducts signals intelligence, electronic warfare, and cyberspace operations; communications battalion; the MEF support battalion; and the Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company.

While not a MAGTF, the Marine Corps has begun to reorganize some of its regiments into Marine Littoral Regiments (MRL), which are similar in size to a Marine Expeditionary Unit. A Marine Littoral Regiment is a self-deployable force, designed to be naval in nature and operate in the littoral region. A Marine Littoral Regiment consists of a littoral combat team, a littoral anti-air battalion, and a combat logistics battalion. Notably, the Marine Littoral Regiment has no aviation combat element, unlike a Marine Expeditionary Unit.

Another Marine Corps element that does not function as part of the MAGTF is the Marine Raider Regiment, functioning under United States Marine Forces Special Operations Command. Marine Raiders specialize in direct action, unconventional warfare, maritime interdiction, special reconnaissance, foreign internal defense, counterterrorism, and counterinsurgency missions.

====Marine Corps commands====
Under Headquarters Marine Corps, the Marine Corps is organized into the Fleet Marine Force, multiple commands, and Marine Corps service components to the unified combatant commands.

===U.S. Navy===

The United States Navy (USN) is the United States Armed Forces&#x27; maritime force. Originally established in 1775 as the Continental Navy, the U.S. Navy consists of the Regular Navy and the Navy Reserve. The Navy is the United States&#x27; principal maritime service, responsible for maritime warfare operations.

The U.S. Navy is organized under the Department of the Navy, which is a military department under the leadership of the secretary of the Navy and the under secretary of the Navy. The U.S. Navy itself is led by the chief of naval operations and the vice chief of naval operations, both admirals who are advised by the master chief petty officer of the Navy.

The five enduring functions of the Navy are:
*Sea control
*Power projection
*Deterrence
*Maritime security
*Sealift
The nine specified tasks of the Navy are:
#Conduct offensive and defensive operations associated with the maritime domain including achieving and maintaining sea control, to include subsurface, surface, land, air, space, and cyberspace.
#Provide power projection through sea-based global strike, to include nuclear and conventional capabilities; interdiction and interception capabilities; maritime and littoral fires, to include naval surface fires; and close air support for ground forces.
#Conduct ballistic missile defense. This is executed through the Navy&#x27;s Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System.
#Conduct ocean, hydro, and river survey and reconstruction.
#Conduct riverine operations. This is conducted by the Maritime Expeditionary Security Force and Naval Special Warfare Command.
#Establish, maintain, and defend sea bases in support of naval, amphibious, land, air, or other joint operations as directed.
#Provide naval expeditionary logistics to enhance the deployment, sustainment, and redeployment of naval forces and other forces operating within the maritime domain, to include joint sea bases, and provide sea transport for the Armed Forces other than which is organic to the individual military services, United States Special Operations Command, and United States Cyber Command. This is conducted by the Navy Expeditionary Logistics Support Group and Military Sealift Command.
#Provide support for joint space operations to enhance naval operations, in coordination with the other military services (primarily the United States Space Force), combatant commands (primarily United States Space Command), and other U.S. government departments and agencies. U.S. Navy space operations are conducted by Navy Space Command.
#Conduct nuclear operations in support of strategic deterrence, to include providing and maintaining nuclear surety and capabilities.

====Naval Surface Forces====

The Naval Surface Forces (NAVSURFOR) is the backbone of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s combat power, conducting surface warfare operations and operating its fleet of combat surface ships.

The Naval Surface Forces operates eleven nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (CVN), split between the &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class and the newer &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class. Aircraft carriers are the centerpiece of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s combat power, forming the nucleus of its eleven carrier strike groups (CSG). Each aircraft carrier has an embarked carrier air wing from the Naval Air Forces.

The Naval Surface Forces also operate 116 surface combatants. These include the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class guided-missile cruisers, &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; guided-missile destroyers (DDG) and &quot;Zumwalt-class&quot; stealth guided-missile destroyers. Cruisers and destroyers often operate as part of larger formations, where they serve as escorts for anti-aircraft and anti-submarine operations. However, they also are able to conduct sea control and striker operations ashore with their tomahawk cruise missiles. The Navy also operates a complement of smaller &quot;Freedom&quot;-class and &quot;Independence&quot;-class littoral combat ships (LCS) that can be modularly reconfigured for specific mission sets. Having lacked a frigate since the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class was decommissioned, the Navy is in the process of acquiring the new &quot;Constellation&quot;-class guided-missile frigates (FFG).

Finally, the Naval Surface Forces operate 31 amphibious warfare ships to support the Fleet Marine Force and its embarked Marine Air-Ground Task Forces as part of an amphibious ready group or expeditionary strike group. This includes the &quot;America-class&quot; landing helicopter assault (LHA) ships which can carry U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II fighters and helicopters; and &quot;Wasp-class&quot; landing helicopter dock (LHD) ships, which can carry both F-35B fighters, helicopters, and landing craft. These are in addition to the San Antonio-class amphibious transport docks (LPD), and the Whidbey Island-class and &quot;Harpers Ferry&quot;-class dock landing ships.

====Naval Submarine Forces====

The Naval Submarine Forces (NAVSUBFOR) is often referred to as the &quot;silent service&quot;, consisting of 68 commissioned submarines.

&quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class, &quot;Seawolf&quot;-class, and &quot;Virginia&quot;-class nuclear-powered attack submarines are capable of performing sea control missions by destroying enemy submarines and surface ships, conducting surveillance and reconnaissance, performing irregular warfare, covert troop insertion, mine and anti-mine operations, and land attack missions with tomahawk cruise missiles.

&quot;Ohio&quot;-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBN) have the sole mission of being launch platforms for the nuclear submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). Each carries 20 UGM-133 Trident II SLBMs. The Navy is currently in the process of procuring the &quot;Columbia&quot;-class SSBNs to replace the &quot;Ohio&quot;-class. Some &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarines have been converted to cruise-missile submarines (SSGN), capable of carrying 154 tomahawk cruise missiles and deploying 66 special operations forces personnel, such as Navy SEALs.

====Naval Air Forces====

The Naval Air Forces (NAVAIRFOR) is the Navy&#x27;s naval aviation arm, centered around the carrier air wing. The core of the carrier air wing are the Naval Air Forces strike fighter squadrons (VFA), which fly the F-35C Lightning II stealth fighter and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. A variant of the F/A-18, the EA-18G Growler is an electronic-warfare aircraft flown by electronic attack squadrons (VAQ) off of carriers or land bases. The E-2 Hawkeye provides carriers with airborne early warning and command-and-control, while the C-2A Greyhound keeps carriers supplied. The CMV-22B Osprey is currently in the process of replacing the C-2 Greyhound for carrier resupply.

The Naval Air Forces also operate the MH-60 Seahawk for anti-submarine warfare, anti-ship warfare, and search and rescue operations. The MH-53E is primarily used for anti-mine warfare but can also be used for assault support.

Although primarily centered on carriers, the Naval Air Forces do operate a small number of land-based aircraft. These include the P-3C Orion and P-8A Poseidon, which conduct anti-submarine warfare operations and serve as maritime patrol aircraft, alongside the unmanned MQ-4C Triton. The E-6 Mercury is also flown by the Navy to communicate instructions to U.S. strategic forces.

====Navy commands====
The U.S. Navy is organized into eight navy component commands, which command operational forces and serve as joint force maritime component commands; fifteen shore commands, which support the fleets&#x27; operating forces; five systems commands, which oversee the technical requirements of the Navy; and nine type commands, which administratively manage units of a certain type.

===U.S. Air Force===
The United States Air Force (USAF) is the United States Armed Forces&#x27; air force. Originally established in 1947 when it gained independence from the U.S. Army, it traces its history back through the United States Army Air Forces, United States Army Air Corps, United States Army Air Service, the Division of Military Aeronautics, Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps, to the birth of Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps on 1 August 1907. The U.S. Air Force serves as the principal air service, responsible for aerial warfare operations. The U.S. Air Force is composed of the Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard.

The U.S. Air Force is organized under the Department of the Air Force, which is a military department under the leadership of the secretary of the Air Force and under secretary of the Air Force. The U.S. Air Force itself is led by the chief of staff of the Air Force and vice chief of staff of the Air Force, both generals who are advised by the chief master sergeant of the Air Force.

The five core missions of the Air Force are:
*Air superiority
*Global integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
*Rapid global mobility
*Global strike
*Command and control
The eight specified functions of the Air Force are:
# Conduct nuclear operations in support of strategic deterrence, to include providing and maintaining nuclear surety and capabilities.
# Conduct offensive and defensive operations, to include appropriate air and missile defense, to gain and maintain air superiority and air supremacy as required, to enable the conduct of operations by U.S. and allied land, sea, air, space, and special operations forces.
#Conduct global precision attack, to include strategic attack, interdiction, close air support, and prompt global strike.
# Provide timely, globally integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capability and capacity from forward deployed locations and globally distributed centers to support world-wide operations.
# Provide rapid global mobility to employ and sustain organic air and space forces and other military service and U. S. Special Operations Command forces, as directed, to include airlift forces for airborne operations, air logistical support, tanker forces for in-flight refueling, and assets for aeromedical evacuation. 
# Provide agile combat support to enhance the air and space campaign and the deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of air and space forces and other forces operating within the air and space domains, to include joint air and space bases, and for the Armed Forces other than which is organic to the individual military services and U.S. Special Operations Command in coordination with the other military services, combatant commands, and U.S. Government departments and agencies.
# Conduct global personnel recovery operations including theater-wide combat and civil search and rescue in coordination with the other military services, combatant commands, and DoD components.
# Conduct globally integrated command and control for air and space operations.

====Combat Air Force====
The Combat Air Force (CAF) comprises the majority of the Air Force&#x27;s combat power, consisting of its fighter, bomber, intercontinental ballistic missile, and special operations forces.

The Air Force&#x27;s fighter forces are led by Air Combat Command&#x27;s Fifteenth Air Force, with other fighter units under Pacific Air Forces and United States Air Forces in Europe. Air Force fighters are predominantly used to achieve air superiority and strike enemy ground and naval forces. The Air Force operates an expanding force of fifth-generation fighters. The F-22A Raptor stealth fighter is designed to replace the F-15C in air superiority operations carrying two AIM-9 Sidewinder and six AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles. It also has a significant air-to-ground mission, carrying two GBU-32 Joint Direct Attack Munition bombs, in addition to two AIM-9 and two AIM-120 missiles. Ultimately, the F-22 is intended to be replaced by the sixth-generation fighter, Next Generation Air Dominance program. The F-22 is complemented by the more numerous F-35A Lightning II multi-role stealth fighters, which are in the process of replacing the F-16C fighters and A-10 attack aircraft in air superiority and ground attack roles, to include the nuclear strike mission.

The Air Force still operates an extremely sizable force of fourth-generation fighters. The F-15C Eagle is a dedicated air superiority fighter, while the F-15E Strike Eagle has been modified to be a dual-role strike fighter, carrying both conventional and nuclear weapons. The F-15C Eagle and F-15E Strike Eagle are both being replaced by the F-15EX Eagle II, which is significantly more advanced. The F-16C Fighting Falcon is a multirole fighter that has served as the primary Air Force fighter for decades, including as a dual-capable tactical nuclear strike fighter. The A-10C Thunderbolt II attack aircraft has been the first Air Force fighter specifically designed for close air support missions, operating against enemy ground forces and light naval ships with its GAU-8 Avenger gatling cannon and array of air-to-ground munitions.
The Air Force&#x27;s bomber forces are organized under Air Force Global Strike Command&#x27;s Eighth Air Force, executing long-range strike operations. The B-2A Spirit stealth bomber is capable of conducting both conventional and nuclear strike operations flying through air defenses. The B-1B Lancer, in contrast, is a supersonic bomber that carries only conventional munitions and serves as the backbone of the bomber force. Both the B-2A Spirit and the B-1B Lancer are being replaced by the B-21 Raider stealth bomber, which can be equipped with both conventional and nuclear munitions. The B-52H Stratofortress is a long-range, heavy bomber that the Air Force has flown since the 1950s and operates a variety of conventional and nuclear munitions, including the AGM-86 air-launched cruise missile.

The Air Force&#x27;s intercontinental ballistic missile forces are organized under Air Force Global Strike Command&#x27;s Twentieth Air Force, serving as the land component of the nuclear triad. The LGM-30G Minuteman III serves as the only ballistic missile operated by the Air Force, with 400 stationed in hardened silos. The LGM-30G will be replaced by the LGM-35A Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile.

The Air Force&#x27;s special operations forces are organized under Air Force Special Operations Command, consisting of both special operations aviation and Air Force special tactics airmen on the ground. The AC-130J Ghostrider gunships have the primary mission of close air support and air interdiction, using cannons and precision guided munitions. The MC-130J Commando II, also a variant of the C-130 Hercules, fly exfiltration and resupply operations for special operations forces, along with conducting air-to-air refueling for helicopters. The CV-22 Osprey is a tiltrotor aircraft used for the infiltration and exfiltration of special operations forces. While not under Air Force Special Operations Command, rescue operations are supported by the HC-130J Combat King II and HH-60W Jolly Green II combat rescue aircraft. The MQ-9 Reaper also serves as a remotely piloted intelligence and strike aircraft, serving under Air Force Special Operations Command and Air Combat Command.

Air Force Special Tactics are the ground special warfare force of the U.S. Air Force, integrating air-ground operations. Special Tactics conduct four core missions. Global access teams assess and open airfields, ranging from international airports to dirt strips, in permissive or hostile locations to facilitate the landing and operation of air forces. Precision strike teams are trained to direct aircraft and other forces to conduct kinetic and non-kinetic strikes, as well as humanitarian aid drops. Special Tactics teams also conduct personnel recovery missions, possessing significant medical and rescue experience. Finally, Special Operations Surgical Teams conduct surgery and medical operations in battlefield operations in support of special operations.

The Air Force also operates a wide array of reconnaissance aircraft under Air Combat Command&#x27;s Sixteenth Air Force, including the RQ-4 Global Hawk drone, U-2 Dragon Lady, and RC-135 Rivet Joint. Air Force operations are typically supported by command and control aircraft, such as the E-3 Sentry airborne warning and control system. The E-3 Sentry is in the process of being replaced by the E-7A Wedgetail.

====Mobility Air Force====


The Mobility Air Force (MAF) is organized under Air Mobility Command and comprises the Air Force&#x27;s airlift, air refueling, and aeromedical evacuation forces.

The airlift forces operate three different major aircraft. The C-5M Super Galaxy is the largest aircraft in the Air Force, serving as a strategic transport aircraft. The C-17A Globemaster III is the airlift force&#x27;s most flexible aircraft, conducting both strategic and tactical airlift operations. It is also capable of conducting airborne operations for the Army and aerial resupply through airdropping cargo. Finally, the C-130J Super Hercules is a tactical airlifter, conducting both cargo airlift and supporting Army airborne operations. Other major airlift platforms include the VC-25, which serves as the personal plane of the president of the United States, better known as Air Force One.

The Air Force also operates three major aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Pegasus is its most modern tanker, replacing the aging KC-10A Extenders. The remaining tanker is the KC-135 Stratotanker, which has flown since the 1950s. Tankers are also capable of conducting limited airlift operations.

====Air Force commands====
The U.S. Air Force is organized into nine major commands, which conduct the majority of the service&#x27;s organize, train, and equip functions. It commands forces attached to the combatant commands as joint force air component commands.
===U.S. Space Force===

The United States Space Force (USSF) is the United States Armed Forces&#x27; space force and is the newest military branch. Originally established in 2019, it traces its history through Air Force Space Command and the Western Development Division to 1954. The United States Space Force is the principal space service, responsible for space warfare operations. The U.S. Space Force is composed of the Regular Space Force, not yet having organized a reserve component outside of the Air Force.

The U.S. Space Force is organized under the Department of the Air Force, which is a military department under the leadership of the secretary of the Air Force and under secretary of the Air Force. The U.S. Space Force itself is led by the chief of space operations and vice chief of space operations, both generals who are advised by the chief master sergeant of the Space Force.
The five core competencies of the Space Force are:
*Space security
*Combat power projection
*Space mobility and logistics
*Information mobility
*Space domain awareness
The five specified functions of the Space Force are:
#Provide freedom of operation for the United States in, from, and to space.
#Provide prompt and sustained space operations.
#Protect the interests of the United States in space.
#Deter aggression in, from, and to space.
#Conduct space operations.

====Orbital warfare and space electromagnetic warfare====

The Space Force&#x27;s combat power is centered around Space Delta 3, which conducts space electromagnetic warfare and Space Delta 9, which conducts orbital warfare.

Combat power projection operations ensure freedom of action in space for the U.S. and its allies and denies an adversary freedom of action in space. These are divided into offensive and defensive space operations. Defensive operations preserve and protect U.S. and allied space capabilities, which are further sub-divided into active and passive actions. Offensive operations target a U.S. adversary&#x27;s space and counterspace capabilities, achieving space superiority.

Orbital warfare forces conduct protect-and-defend operations and provide U.S. national decision authorities with response options to deter and, when necessary, defeat orbital threats. The space electromagnetic warfare forces conduct offensive and defensive space control operations. Space Force cyber forces conduct defensive cyber operations to protect space assets.

====Cyber operations and Satellite Control Network====
Although the U.S. Space Force is not a cyber force, it does conduct extensive cyber operations under Space Delta 6. The primary focus of Space Force cyber operations is defending U.S. Space Force networks and ensuring the operations of its spacecraft, which are controlled remotely from ground stations. All space operations units have cyber squadrons assigned to defend them and incorporate offensive cyber operations.

Additionally, Space Delta 6 is responsible for managing the Satellite Control Network, a global network of antennas used to communicate with the service&#x27;s spacecraft. The 22nd Space Operations Squadron is responsible for overall operations, with the 21st Space Operations Squadron and 23rd Space Operations Squadron managing the ground station sites at Vandenberg Space Force Base, New Boston Space Force Station, Kaena Point Space Force Station, Diego Garcia, Guam, Greenland, and the United Kingdom.

====Space domain awareness====
The Space Force&#x27;s Space Delta 2 operates the United States Space Surveillance Network, tracking 47,000 objects in space as of 2022. Space domain awareness encompasses the identification, characterization, and understanding of any factor associated with the space domain that could affect space operations.

Space Delta 2 sensors include the AN/FPS-85 phased array radar at Eglin Air Force Base and the Space Fence radar at Kwajalein Atoll operated by the 20th Space Surveillance Squadron; and a global network of three Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance telescopes operated by the 15th Space Surveillance Squadron.

The 18th Space Defense Squadron, collocated with the Combined Space Operations Center, executes command and control of the Space Surveillance Network and manages the Space Catalog of all objects in Earth orbit. The 19th Space Defense Squadron focuses on objects further in cislunar space, beyond geosynchronous orbit, with a specific focus on supporting NASA&#x27;s Artemis program and other human spaceflight operations.

====Missile warning====

The Space Force&#x27;s Space Delta 4 uses orbital spacecraft and ground-based radars to conduct theater and strategic missile warnings for the United States and its international partners. This includes the network of Upgraded Early Warning Radars at Beale Air Force Base, Clear Space Force Station, Cape Cod Space Force Station, Pituffik Space Base, and RAF Fylingdales, along with the AN/FPQ-16 PARCS radar at Cavalier Space Force Station. Currently, the Space Force is working with the Missile Defense Agency to acquire the Long Range Discrimination Radar at Clear Space Force Station in Alaska. These ground-based radars also contribute to the Space Surveillance Network.

Space-based missile warning systems include the Defense Support Program and Space-Based Infrared System (SIBRS) spacecraft, which use infrared sensors to conduct missile defense and missile warning. SIBRS also has a battlespace awareness and technical intelligence mission. The Defense Support Program spacecraft are also capable of detecting nuclear detonations, in addition to space and missile launches.

====Global Positioning System and military satellite communications====
The Space Force&#x27;s Space Delta 8 is the operator of the Global Positioning System and the military&#x27;s array of communications spacecraft.

The Global Positioning System is operated by the 2nd Space Operations Squadron, providing positioning, navigation, and timing information for civilian and military users across the entire world. The Space Force&#x27;s GPS system has become an integral element of the global information infrastructure, being used in virtually all sectors of the economy, including agriculture, aviation, marine transportation, surveying and mapping, and transit navigation. Its timing signal is used to synchronize global communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The Global Positioning System also has a secondary mission of carrying nuclear detonation detection sensors.

Military satellite communication systems include the Fleet Satellite Communications System, UHF Follow-On satellite, and Mobile User Objective System, operated by the 10th Space Operations Squadron and inherited from the U.S. Navy. The payloads on the Wideband Global SATCOM and Defense Satellite Communications System are operated by the 53rd Space Operations Squadron, a role inherited from the U.S. Army. Finally, spacecraft operations for the Wideband Global SATCOM and Defense Satellite Communications System are conducted by the 4th Space Operations Squadron, in addition to the Milstar and Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellites, which both additionally support command and control of strategic nuclear forces.

====Space launch====
The Space Force&#x27;s space launch enterprise is organized under Space Systems Command, with Space Launch Delta 30 managing the Western Range from Vandenberg Space Force Base and Space Launch Delta 45 managing the Eastern Range from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.

The Space Force does not just manage military space launches, but also supports NASA and commercial space launches. Major space launch vehicles flown or scheduled to fly off of Space Force launch ranges include NASA&#x27;s Space Launch System, SpaceX&#x27;s Starship, Falcon Heavy, and Falcon 9, and United Launch Alliance&#x27;s Vulcan, which will replace the Atlas V and Delta IV Heavy. Currently, vehicles for the National Security Space Launch program include the Vulcan, Atlas V, Falcon Heavy, and Falcon 9 rockets.

An experimental Air Force Research Laboratory vanguard program that the Space Force leads, Rocket Cargo, is exploring using rockets to supplement naval and air transport to rapidly deliver supplies to forces across the Earth. The SpaceX Starship rocket is one such system currently being explored.

====Space Force commands====
The Space Force is organized into three field commands and multiple component field commands, which serve as joint force space component commands for the unified combatant commands.

===U.S. Coast Guard===

The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is the United States Armed Forces&#x27; maritime security, maritime search and rescue, and maritime law enforcement force. It was first established in 1790 as the United States Revenue-Marine and consists of the Regular Coast Guard and the Coast Guard Reserve.

Although it has always been one of the six military branches, the Coast Guard is organized under the Department of Homeland Security under the leadership of the secretary of Homeland Security and the deputy secretary of Homeland Security. During times of war, the U.S. Coast Guard can be transferred to the Department of the Navy The Coast Guard itself is led by the commandant of the Coast Guard and vice commandant of the Coast Guard, both admirals advised by the master chief petty officer of the Coast Guard.

The Coast Guard has six major operational mission programs, through which it executes its 11 statutory missions:
* Maritime law enforcement
* Maritime response
* Maritime prevention
* Maritime transport system management
* Maritime security operations
* Defense operations

Maritime law enforcement operations focus on protecting the United States maritime borders and assuring its maritime sovereignty. The Coast Guard conducts operations to suppress violations of U.S. law at sea, including counter-illegal migration and transnational organized crime operations. Codified missions executed under the maritime law enforcement program include drug interdiction, migrant interdiction, living marine resources, and other law enforcement.

Maritime response operations see the Coast Guard conducting search-and-rescue operations and rescuing mariners responding to maritime disasters. Codified missions include search and rescue and marine environmental protection (response activities).

Maritime prevention operations prevent marine casualties and property losses, minimize security risks, and protect the marine environment. The Coast Guard does so by developing and enforcing federal regulations, conducting safety and security inspections, and analyzing port security risk assessments. Codified missions include ports, waterways, and coastal security, marine safety, and marine environmental protection (protection activities).

Maritime transport system management ensures a safe, secure, and environmentally sound waterways system. Codified missions include maintaining aids to navigation and ice operations.

Maritime security operations include activities to detect, deter, prevent, and disrupt terrorist attacks, and other criminal acts in the U.S. maritime domain. This includes the execution of anti-terrorism, response, and select recovery operations. This mission performs the operational element of the Coast Guard&#x27;s Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security mission and complements its Maritime Response and Prevention efforts. Codified missions include ports, waterways, and coastal security (response activities).

Coast Guard Defense Operations deploy the Coast Guard globally under the Department of Defense&#x27;s unified combatant commands, where it operates under the joint force maritime component commands. Codified missions include defense readiness.

====Coast Guard commands====
The U.S. Coast Guard is organized into two area commands that cover the entire globe.

==Modernization and budget==
===Budget===

The United States manages the world&#x27;s largest military budget, followed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, India, United Kingdom, and Russia.

The James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 established the topline defense budget as $857.9 billion, with the Department of Defense receiving $816.7 billion and the Department of Energy&#x27;s national security programs receiving $30.3 billion, an 8% increase from Fiscal Year 2022.

The Department of the Air Force budget, unlike the Department of the Army or Department of the Navy has a sizable portion of &quot;pass-through.&quot; This is money not controlled or used by the Air Force, but is instead passed to other Department of Defense agencies and can be up to 17% of the department&#x27;s budget. This pass-through allocation gives the impression that the Air Force is the highest funded military department. It is actually the least funded.

===Army modernization===

The Army&#x27;s modernization efforts, led by Army Futures Command, are centralized into six priorities. Each priority is led by a Cross Functional Team.

Long Range Precision Fires is the land service&#x27;s top modernization priority, focusing on rebuilding its Field Artillery Branch in response to longer range Russian and Chinese artillery systems. The Extended Range Cannon Artillery program is developing a cannon artillery piece that can accurately fire at targets 70 kilometers away, an increase from the 30 kilometer distance of current cannon artillery. The Precision Strike Missile is a surface-to-surface guided missile intended to be fired from the current M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System and M142 HIMARS, replacing their current missiles and doubling the rate of fire. The Army is also working with the Missile Defense Agency, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force to develop a common hypersonic glide body, which the Army will employ as part of the mobile ground launched Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon program. Finally, the Army is working to modify the U.S. Navy&#x27;s RIM-174 Standard ERAM and UGM-109 Tomahawk land attack cruise missile for ground launch to provide the Army with mid-range artillery capability.

The Next Generation Combat Vehicle program is developing a family of fighting vehicles for the Armor Branch to increase firepower, speed, and survivability. The Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle is intended to replace the M2 Bradley, while the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle will replace the M113 armored personnel carriers, which have been used since the Vietnam War. The three variants of the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle are general purpose, mission command, and medical treatment. The Mobile Protected Firepower is designed to be a light tank for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams. Finally, the Robotic Combat Vehicles are intended to come in light, medium, and heavy variants that will serve as scouts and escorts for crewed combat vehicles.
The Future Vertical Lift program is intended to replace the current helicopter fleet flown by the Army Aviation Branch.

The Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft is intended to replace the UH-60 Black Hawk and the Marine Corps UH-1Y Venom, with the Army selecting the Bell V-280 Valor tiltrotor aircraft as the winner. The Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft is intended to replace the AH-64 Apache in the attack and reconnaissance roles.

The Army is working to modernize its communication networks for the Army Signal Corps, including developing a Unified Network consisting of an integrated tactical network, an integrated enterprise network, and unified network-enabling capabilities. Other sub-efforts include developing a common operating environment, ensuring the network is interoperable with the other services and allied countries, and increasing the mobility and reducing the signature of its command posts. Efforts also include modernizing Global Positioning System technology to provide assured positioning, navigation, and timing, and working with the United States Intelligence Community and commercial space companies to increase the Army&#x27;s access to space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities.

Recognizing that the United States is unlikely to have uncontested air superiority, the Army is undergoing a mass revitalization of its air and missile defense enterprise through the Air Defense Artillery Branch.

The first layer of defense is the Ballistic Low-Altitude Drone Engagement, which will be mounted on the Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station and is designed to engage small unmanned aerial vehicles. The second layer is the Multi-Mission High Energy Laser, which will intercept small drones and munitions. The third and fourth layers comprise the Maneuver Air Defense Technology and Next-Generation Fires Radar, which will be integrated into short range air defense systems. The fifth layer puts a High-Energy Laser Tactical Vehicle Demonstrator onto a Medium Tactical Vehicle, while the sixth layer encompasses the Low-Cost Extended-Range Air Defense to supplement the MIM-104 Patriot missiles.

Finally, the Army is looking to improve the equipment of its soldiers in the Infantry Branch with the Next Generation Squad Weapon, the Integrated Visual Augmentation System, and the Synthetic Training Environment. In 2022, the Army selected the SIG Sauer&#x27;s XM7 rifle and XM250 light machine gun to replace the M4 carbine and the M249 light machine gun through the Next Generation Squad Weapon program.

===Marine Corps modernization===
The Marine Corps modernization is being executed under the aegis of Force Design 2030, which is intended to return the service to its naval and amphibious roots serving as a &quot;stand-in&quot; force within contested areas of the maritime littorals. As part of this effort, the Marine Corps has begun establishing naval-focused Marine Littoral Regiments, consisting of a Littoral Combat Team, Littoral Anti-Air Battalion, and a Combat Logistics Battalion. The Littoral Combat Team is organized around an infantry battalion with an anti-ship missile battery, focused on conducting sea denial operations in support of the Navy.

The Marine Corps is in the process of acquiring the Amphibious Combat Vehicle, which is slated to replace the aging Assault Amphibious Vehicle. The Amphibious Combat Vehicle is intended to support the Marines during amphibious assaults and once they have reached shore. The Marine Corps has also adopted the Naval Strike Missile which is fielded from a modified Joint Light Tactical Vehicle as part of the Marines&#x27; artillery battalions. The concept is that small mobile units of Marines would move around different islands and shorelines with these weapons to fire on adversary ships.

Marine Corps aviation is also in the process of acquiring the CH-53K King Stallion helicopter for heavy lift, replacing the current CH-53E Super Stallion in the role. The Marine Corps is also looking to replace its UH-1Y Venom helicopters through the Future Vertical Lift program and is in the process of acquiring a significant number of unmanned aerial vehicles, such as the MQ-9 Reaper.

===Navy modernization===

Like the Marine Corps, the Navy is in the process of overhauling and modernizing its fleet with a renewed focus. While the Navy is continuing to purchase &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers, it is embarking on the DDG(X) program of guided missile destroyers to replace them and the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers. The DDG(X) will include directed energy weapons and potentially hypersonic weapons.

The &quot;Constellation&quot;-class frigates will be the first frigates in the U.S. Navy since the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates were retired. The &quot;Constellation&quot;-class frigates are based on the Italian FREMM multipurpose frigates and will replace the littoral combat ships.
The Navy is starting development on the SSN(X) attack submarines, intended to replace the &quot;Virginia&quot;-class and &quot;Seawolf&quot;-class submarines. The &quot;Columbia&quot;-class submarines will begin replacing the &quot;Ohio&quot;-class ballistic missile submarines. The acquisition of the &quot;Columbia&quot;-class submarines is the first priority of the Navy.

With Naval Aviation, the service is continuing to procure additional &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class aircraft carriers and F-35C Lightning II stealth fighters. Ultimately, the F/A-XX program is intended to produce a sixth-generation fighter to replace the legacy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets as part of the Carrier Air Wing and is using the Future Vertical Lift program to replace its fleet of SH-60 Seahawk helicopters.

The service is also investing heavily in unmanned platforms, such as unmanned surface vehicles, using the Ghost Fleet Overlord to test the concept. It is also fielding unmanned aerial vehicles, such as the land-based MQ-4C Triton for maritime patrol and the carrier-based MQ-25A Stingray for aerial refueling, replacing the F/A-18F in the role.

===Air Force modernization===

The B-21 Raider stealth bomber is the first new Air Force bomber since the B-2A Spirit. The B-21 will replace the B-2 and the B-1B Lancer, flying alongside the B-52 Stratofortress. The development of the B-21 Raider was led by the Department of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. The service is also developing the LGM-35 Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile to replace the LGM-30G Minuteman IIIs.

The U.S. Air Force is also in the process of developing the Next Generation Air Dominance program, which will produce a sixth generation fighter to replace the F-22 Raptor. The service is also procuring the fourth generation F-15EX Eagle II to replace the aging F-15C Eagle and F-15E Strike Eagle. It is procuring the T-7A Red Hawk trainer jet to replace the 1950s-era T-38 Talon.

While not an aircraft, the Air Force is investing in developing the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile to replace or supplement the AIM-120 AMRAAM for its fighter forces. It is also procuring the AGM-181 Long Range Stand Off Weapon to replace the AGM-86 ALCM as a nuclear air-launched cruise missile for the B-21 Raider and the B-52 Stratofortress. The air service is investing in hypersonic weapons, with the AGM-183 Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept, and the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile in development.

===Space Force modernization===
The U.S. Space Force is undergoing intensive modernization efforts. The Deep Space Advanced Radar Capability (DARC) is intended to track objects in geosynchronous orbit with three sites, one in the United States, one in the Indo-Pacific, and one in Europe.
Oracle, a spacecraft developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory for the Space Force, will demonstrate technologies that the space service needs for cislunar domain awareness – tracking objects outside of geosynchronous orbit and between Earth and the Moon. The spacecraft itself will launch to an area of gravitational stability between the Earth and the Moon to conduct operations, using a wide-field sensor and a more sensitive narrow-field sensor to discover and maintain custody of objects operating in this region. Oracle will directly support NASA&#x27;s Artemis program as it returns to the Moon and track potentially hazardous near-Earth objects in support of planetary defense operations.

Also an Air Force Research Laboratory program for the Space Force, Arachne is the keystone experiment in the Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research Project, which aims to prove and mature essential technologies for a prototype space-based solar power transmission system capable of powering a forward operating base. Arachne will specifically demonstrate and mature technologies related to more efficient energy generation, radio frequency forming, and radio frequency beaming. Current forward operation bases rely on significant logistics convoys to transport fuel for power – space-based solar power would move these supply lines to space, where they cannot be easily attacked. Space Force provided space-based solar power may transition to civilian use in the same vein as GPS. Other space-based power beaming demonstrations include the Space Power InfraRed Regulation and Analysis of Lifetime (SPIRRAL) and Space Power INcremental DepLoyable Experiment (SPINDLE) experiments.
The Navigation Technology Satellite-3 (NTS-3), building on the Space Force&#x27;s Global Positioning System constellation, is an Air Force Research Laboratory spacecraft that will operate in geosynchronous orbit to test advanced techniques and technologies to detect and mitigate interference to positioning, navigation, and timing capabilities and increase system resiliency for military, civil, and commercial users. NTS-3 is a Vanguard program, described as aiming to deliver potentially game changing capabilities.

The Space Force&#x27;s Rocket Cargo program is another Air Force Research Laboratory Vanguard program, focused on leasing space launch services to quickly transport military materiel to ports across the globe. If proven viable, the Space Force&#x27;s Space Systems Command will be responsible for transitioning it to a program of record. United States Transportation Command would be the primary user of this capability, rapidly launching up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere in the world.

==Personnel==

The U.S. Armed Forces is the world&#x27;s third largest military by active personnel, after the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army and the Indian Armed Forces, consisting of 1,359,685 servicemembers in the regular armed forces with an additional 799,845 servicemembers in the reserves as of 28 February 2019.

While the United States Armed Forces is an all-volunteer military, conscription through the Selective Service System can be enacted at the president&#x27;s request and Congress&#x27; approval, with all males ages 18 through 25 living in the United States required to register with the Selective Service. Although the constitutionality of registering only males for Selective Service was challenged by federal district court in 2019, its legality was upheld by a federal appeals court in 2020.

As in most militaries, members of the U.S. Armed Forces hold a rank, either that of officer, warrant officer or enlisted, to determine seniority and eligibility for promotion. Those who have served are known as veterans. 

Rank names may be different between services, but they are matched to each other by their corresponding paygrade. Officers who hold the same rank or paygrade are distinguished by their date of rank to determine seniority. Officers who serve in certain positions of office of importance set by law, outrank all other officers on active duty of the same rank and paygrade, regardless of their date of rank.

===Personnel by service===

Total number of authorized personnel in FY23. 

===Rank structure===
Rank in the United States Armed Forces is split into three distinct categories: officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel. 

Officers are the leadership of the military, holding commissions from the president of the United States and confirmed to their rank by the Senate. 

Warrant officers hold a warrant from the secretaries of the military departments, serving as specialists in certain military technologies and capabilities. Upon promotion to chief warrant officer 2, they gain a commission from the president of the United States. 

Enlisted personnel constitute the majority of the armed forces, serving as specialists and tactical-level leaders until they become senior non-commissioned officers or senior petty officers. 

Military ranks across the services can be compared by U.S. Uniformed Services pay grade or NATO rank code.

====Officer corps====


Officers represent the top 18% of the armed forces, serving in leadership and command roles. Officers are divided into three categories:
*O-1 to O-3: Company grade officers in the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force or junior officers in the Navy and the Coast Guard.
*O-4 to O-6: Field grade officers in the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force or mid-grade officers in the Navy and Coast Guard.
*O-7 to O-10: General officers in the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force or flag officers in the Navy and Coast Guard.
Officers are typically commissioned as second lieutenants or ensigns with a bachelor&#x27;s degree after several years of training and education or directly commissioned from civilian life into a specific specialty, such as a medical professional, lawyer, chaplain, or cyber specialist.

Officers are commissioned through the United States service academies, Reserve Officer Training Corps programs, and the Officer Candidate and Officer Training Schools. During a time of war, officers may be promoted to five-star ranks, with general of the Army, fleet admiral, and general of the Air Force the only five-star ranks currently authorized.

====Warrant officer corps====


Warrant officers are specialists, accounting for only 8% of the officer corps. Warrant officers hold warrants from their service secretary and are specialists and experts in certain military technologies or capabilities. The lowest-ranking warrant officers serve under a warrant, but they receive commissions from the president upon promotion to chief warrant officer 2. They derive their authority from the same source as commissioned officers but remain specialists, in contrast to commissioned officers, who are generalists. There are no warrant officers in the Air Force or Space Force.

Warrant officers are typically non-commissioned officers before being selected, with the exception of Army Aviation where any enlisted grade can apply for a warrant. Army warrant officers attend the Army Warrant Officer Candidate School.

====Enlisted corps====


Enlisted personnel comprise 82% of the armed forces, serving as specialists and tactical leaders. Enlisted personnel are divided into three categories:
* E-1 to E-3/4: Junior enlisted personnel are usually in initial training or at their first assignment. E-1 to E-3 in the Marine Corps, Navy, and Coast Guard, and E-1 to E-4 in the Army, Air Force, and Space Force. In the Army, specialists (E-4) are considered to be junior enlisted, while corporals (E-4) are non-commissioned officers.
* E-4/5 to E-6: Non-commissioned officers in the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force and petty officers in the Navy and Coast Guard. In the Air Force and Space Force, E-5 is the first non-commissioned officer rank. Non-commissioned officers and petty officers are responsible for tactical leadership.
* E-7 to E-9: Senior non-commissioned officers in the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force and chief petty officers in the Navy and Coast Guard. Serve as senior enlisted advisors to officers.

The rank of senior enlisted advisor is the highest rank in each service, serving as the primary advisor to its service secretary and service chief on enlisted matters.

Prior to entering service, enlisted personnel must complete their service&#x27;s basic training. In the Army, after completing Basic Combat Training, recruits then go to advanced individual training for their military occupational specialty. Upon completion of Marine Corps Recruit Training, Infantry Marines attend the School of Infantry. Non-infantry Marines complete Marine Combat Training before advancing to technical schools for their Military Occupational Specialty. In the Navy, after completing Recruit Training, sailors advance to their &quot;A&quot; schools to complete training for their rating. In the Air Force and Space Force, recruits complete combined Basic Military Training before going to technical training for their Air Force Specialty Codes. In the Coast Guard, after completing Recruit Training, sailors advance to their &quot;A&quot; schools to complete training for their rating.

===Women in the armed forces===


Women such as Deborah Sampson disguised themselves as men to join the military during the Revolutionary War and War of 1812. Some historians estimate that as many as 400 women disguised themselves as men to enlist during the Civil War. The first woman doctor in the Army, Mary Edwards Walker, was commissioned in 1864. In 1901, the United States Army Nurse Corps was established as a quasi-military auxiliary, followed by the United States Navy Nurse Corps in 1908.

Women were not accepted in the armed forces outside of medical roles until World War I, when they were allowed to enlist to perform clerical roles. Women were accepted into the Naval Reserve Force in 1917, and the Marine Corps Reserves and Coast Guard in 1918. The War Department forbid Army and National Guard posts from employing any women except as nurses, but the need for telephone operators overseas during World War I became urgent and hundreds of &quot;Hello Girls&quot; were recruited. These members of the Army Signal Corps wore military uniforms and took the Army oath, but were classified as civilian employees until 1977 when their military service was officially recognized.

After the Armistice of 11 November 1918 was signed, enlisted women were demobilized and the nurse corps returned to peacetime strength. The Naval Reserve Act of 1916, which authorized the Navy to enlist &quot;citizens&quot;, was changed in 1925 to specify &quot;male citizens&quot;.

During World War II, all branches of the U.S. military enlisted women. The Woman&#x27;s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) was established by the Army in 1942 with auxiliary status, and converted to the Women&#x27;s Army Corps (WAC) in June, 1943. Also formed during this time were the Women&#x27;s Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs), the Navy&#x27;s Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Services (WAVES), the Marine Corps Women&#x27;s Reserve, and the Coast Guard Women&#x27;s Reserve (SPARS). 

Women experienced combat as nurses in the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, before the U.S. officially entered the war. In 1944, WACs arrived in the Pacific and in Normandy. During the war, 67 Army nurses and 16 Navy nurses were captured and spent three years as Japanese prisoners of war. There were 350,000 American women who served during World War II, and 432 were killed in the line of service. In total, they gained over 1,500 medals, citations, and commendations.

After World War II, demobilization led to the vast majority of serving women being returned to civilian life. By 1946, the Coast Guard had demobilized all of its women members, while the other branches retained some. Law 625, The Women&#x27;s Armed Services Act of 1948, was signed by President Harry S. Truman, allowing women to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces in fully integrated units during peace time, albeit with limits that did not apply to men. The intent of Congress was that women should be noncombatants only, but because of the difficulty in defining restrictions for the Army in the law, it was left up to the service secretaries to comply with that intent, although the law did prohibit women from serving aboard ships and on aircraft that engaged in combat missions. The Army retained a separate corps for women (WAC), while the other services integrated women into their organizational structure. In 1951, Executive Order 10240 was issued, authorizing the services to discharge women who became pregnant or had minor children in the home (including stepchildren, foster children, and siblings). 

During the Korean War of 1950–1953, many women served in the Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals. A recruiting project started in 1951 aimed to increase the number of women in the military from 40,000 to 112,000 by July 1952, but it only achieved 46,000. Some of the reasons were the lack of public support for involvement in Korea; public disapproval of women in the military; fewer women in the right age group due to the low birthrate during the Depression; and the higher standards required for women enlistees.

In the 1960s, recruiting and training focused on the attractiveness and femininity of women enlistees. Outside of the medical fields, women were mostly assigned to clerical, administrative, and protocol-related jobs. Women who were previously in technical positions were retrained for the few jobs now permitted for women. Of the 61 non-combat occupational groups, only 36 were open to women by 1965. Beginning in 1965, efforts to increase the number of women in the armed forces accompanied concern about the expiration of the Selective Service Act and reduction in enlistment standards to ensure sufficient troops to support the Vietnam War. Public Law 90-130, signed on 8 November 1967, removed the restrictions on female officers in the armed forces and in 1970, two women Army officers were promoted to brigadier general.

During the Vietnam War, 600 women served in the country as part of the Air Force, along with 500 members of the WAC and over 6,000 medical personnel and support staff. 

The end of conscription in the early 1970s was a major driver of the expansion of the roles of women in the armed forces. The number of enlisted and commissioned women in the military hit 110,000 by June 1977. The Army Ordnance Corps began accepting female missile technicians in 1974. Female crewmembers and officers were accepted into Field Artillery missile units. The services opened up their Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) programs to women, and in 1976, women were admitted to the service academies. 

In 1974, the first six female naval aviators earned their wings as Navy pilots. The Combat Exclusion Policy that prohibited women in combat placed limitations on the pilots&#x27; advancement, but at least two retired as captains. 

The role of women in the U.S. Armed Forces received global media attention during the 1991 Gulf War, though their perception in media was skewed during this time period as little media attention was given to the situations where women faced combat.

In 1991, women were permitted to fly military aircraft. Since 1994, women have been permitted to serve on U.S. combat ships. In 2010, the ban on women serving on submarines was lifted.

On 3 December 2015, U.S. defense secretary Ashton Carter announced that all military combat positions would become available to women. This gave women access to the roughly 10% of military jobs which were previously closed to them. The various military services were given until January 2016 to provide plans on how they would enforce the policy change. Many women believed this would allow them to improve their positions in the military, since most high-ranking officers start in combat positions. 

Draft registration for females was recommended by the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service and has been proposed, but never implemented.

No woman has ever become a Navy SEAL. However, in July 2021, the first woman graduated from the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) training program to become a Special Warfare Combatant craft Crewman (SWCC). The SWCC directly supports the SEALs and other special forces units, and are experts in covert insertion and extraction special operation tactics.

Despite concerns of a gender gap, all personnel both men and women, at the same rank and time of service, are compensated the same across all branches. On 1 June 2022, ADM Linda L. Fagan assumed command of the U.S. Coast Guard, becoming not only the first woman to serve as Commandant of the Coast Guard, but also the first woman in American history to serve as a service chief in the U.S. Military.

A study conducted by the RAND Corporation suggests that women who make the military their careers experience improved rates of promotion.

As per the DoD&#x27;s report on sexual assault within the U.S. Army for fiscal year 2019, 7,825 cases had been reported. This represented a 3% increase relative to the 2018 report.

As of 2022, there are 228,966 women in the military, representing 17.5% of the total active duty force. Since 2021, the percentage of women on active duty service has increased slightly, by 0.3%. Since 2005, the population of active duty women has increased by 2.9%.

===Restrictions on political activity===
It has been a long-standing policy in the armed forces to limit the political activity by active duty members to voting and making personal campaign donations. However, all other political activities, such as campaigning for a candidate (even outside military facilities), endorsing candidates, soliciting contributions, wearing/displaying political preferences, marching in a partisan parade or wearing the uniform to a partisan event, are prohibited.

==Order of precedence==

Under Department of Defense regulation, the various components of the U.S. Armed Forces have a set order of precedence that is based on founding dates. This order is used for the display of service flags as well as the placement of soldiers, marines, sailors, airmen, guardians, and coast guardsmen in formations and parades.

# Cadets, U.S. Military Academy
# Midshipmen, U.S. Naval Academy
# Cadets, U.S. Air Force Academy
# Cadets, U.S. Coast Guard Academy
# Midshipmen, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy
# United States Army
# United States Marine Corps
# United States Navy
# United States Air Force
# United States Space Force
# United States Coast Guard
# Army National Guard
# United States Army Reserve
# United States Marine Corps Reserve
# United States Navy Reserve
# Air National Guard
# United States Air Force Reserve
# United States Coast Guard Reserve
# Other training and auxiliary organizations of the Army, Marine Corps, Merchant Marine, Civil Air Patrol, and Coast Guard Auxiliary, as in the preceding order.

While the original founding date of a U.S. Navy was earlier than that of the Marine Corps, the Marine Corps takes precedence due to previous inconsistencies in the Navy&#x27;s birth date. The Marine Corps has recognized its observed birth date on a more consistent basis. The Second Continental Congress is considered to have established the Navy on 13 October 1775 by authorizing the purchase of ships, but the &quot;Rules for the Regulation of the Navy of the United Colonies&quot; were not established until 27 November 1775, and the Navy also lost funding and was temporarily discontinued in 1785. The Marine Corps was established by an act of the Second Continental Congress on 10 November 1775. The Navy did not officially recognize 13 October 1775 as its birth date until 1972, when then–chief of naval operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt authorized it to be observed as such.

The Coast Guard is normally situated after the Space Force, but if it is moved to the Department of the Navy, then its place in the order of precedence would change to being situated after the Navy and before the Air Force.

<text>The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is the maritime security, search and rescue, and law enforcement service branch of the armed forces of the United States. It is one the country&#x27;s eight uniformed services. The service is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the United States military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its duties. It is the largest coast guard in the world, rivaling the capabilities and size of most navies.

The U.S. Coast Guard protects the United States&#x27; borders and economic and security interests abroad; and defends its sovereignty by safeguarding sea lines of communication and commerce across U.S. territorial waters and its Exclusive Economic Zone. Due to ever-expanding risk imposed by transnational threats through the maritime and cyber domains, the U.S. Coast Guard is at any given time deployed to and operating on all seven continents and in cyberspace to enforce its mission. Like its United States Navy sibling, the U.S. Coast Guard maintains a global presence with permanently-assigned personnel throughout the world and forces routinely deploying to both littoral and blue-water regions. The U.S. Coast Guard&#x27;s adaptive, multi-mission &quot;white hull&quot; fleet is leveraged as a force of both diplomatic soft power and humanitarian and security assistance over the more overtly confrontational nature of &quot;gray hulled&quot; warships. As a humanitarian service, it saves tens of thousands of lives a year at sea and in U.S. waters, and provides emergency response and disaster management for a wide range of human-made and natural catastrophic incidents in the U.S. and throughout the world.

The U.S. Coast Guard operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime. During times of war, it can be transferred in whole or in part to the U.S. Department of the Navy under the Department of Defense by order of the U.S. president or by act of Congress. Prior to its transfer to Homeland Security, it operated under the Department of Transportation from 1967 to 2003 and the Department of the Treasury from its inception until 1967. A congressional authority transfer to the Navy has only happened once: in 1917, during World War I. By the time the U.S. entered World War II in December 1941, the U.S. Coast Guard had already been transferred to the Navy by President Franklin Roosevelt.

Created by Congress as the Revenue-Marine on 4 August 1790 at the request of Alexander Hamilton, it is the oldest continuously operating naval service of the United States. As secretary of the treasury, Hamilton headed the Revenue-Marine, whose original purpose was collecting customs duties at U.S. seaports. By the 1860s, the service was known as the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the term Revenue-Marine gradually fell into disuse.

The modern U.S. Coast Guard was formed by a merger of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Life-Saving Service on 28 January 1915, under the Department of the Treasury. In 1939, the U.S. Lighthouse Service was also merged into the U.S. Coast Guard. As one of the country&#x27;s six armed services, the U.S. Coast Guard and its predecessor have participated in every major U.S. war since 1790, from the Quasi-War with France to the Global War on Terrorism.

As of December 2021, the U.S. Coast Guard&#x27;s authorized force strength is 44,500 active duty personnel and 7,000 reservists. The service&#x27;s force strength also includes 8,577 full-time civilian federal employees and 21,000 uniformed civilian volunteers of the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary. The service maintains an extensive fleet of roughly 250 coastal and ocean-going cutters, patrol ships, buoy tenders, tugs, and icebreakers; as well as nearly 2,000 small boats and specialized craft. It also maintains an aviation division consisting of more than 200 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. While the U.S. Coast Guard is the second smallest of the U.S. military service branches in terms of membership, the service by itself is the world&#x27;s 12th largest naval force.

==Mission==
===Role===
The Coast Guard carries out three basic roles, which are further subdivided into eleven statutory missions. The three roles are:
* Maritime safety
* Maritime security
* Maritime stewardship

With a decentralized organization and much responsibility placed on even the most junior personnel, the Coast Guard is frequently lauded for its quick responsiveness and adaptability in a broad range of emergencies. In a 2005 article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine following Hurricane Katrina, the author wrote, &quot;the Coast Guard&#x27;s most valuable contribution to [a military effort when catastrophe hits] may be as a model of flexibility, and most of all, spirit.&quot; Wil Milam, a rescue swimmer from Alaska told the magazine, &quot;In the Navy, it was all about the mission. Practicing for war, training for war. In the Coast Guard, it was, take care of our people and the mission will take care of itself.&quot;

===Missions===
The eleven statutory missions as defined by law are divided into homeland security missions and non-homeland security missions:

====Non-homeland security missions====
* Ice operations, including the International Ice Patrol
* Living marine resources (fisheries law enforcement)
* Marine environmental protection
* Marine safety
* Aids to navigation
* Search and rescue

====Homeland security missions====
* Defense readiness
* Maritime law enforcement
* Migrant interdiction
* Ports, waterways and coastal security (PWCS)
* Drug interdiction

===Search and rescue===

The U.S. Coast Guard Search and Rescue (CG-SAR) is one of the Coast Guard&#x27;s best-known operations. The &quot;National Search and Rescue Plan&quot; designates the Coast Guard as the federal agency responsible for maritime SAR operations, and the United States Air Force as the federal agency responsible for inland SAR. Both agencies maintain rescue coordination centers to coordinate this effort, and have responsibility for both military and civilian search and rescue. The two services jointly provide instructor staff for the National Search and Rescue School that trains SAR mission planners and coordinators. Previously located on Governors Island, New York, the school is now located at Coast Guard Training Center Yorktown at Yorktown, Virginia.

===National Response Center===
Operated by the Coast Guard, the National Response Center (NRC) is the sole U.S. Government point of contact for reporting all oil, chemical, radiological, biological, and etiological spills and discharges into the environment, anywhere in the United States and its territories. In addition to gathering and distributing spill/incident information for Federal On Scene Coordinators and serving as the communications and operations center for the National Response Team, the NRC maintains agreements with a variety of federal entities to make additional notifications regarding incidents meeting established trigger criteria. The NRC also takes Maritime Suspicious Activity and Security Breach Reports. Details on the NRC organization and specific responsibilities can be found in the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan. The Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE) database system is managed and used by the Coast Guard for tracking pollution and safety incidents in the nation&#x27;s ports.

===National Maritime Center===
The National Maritime Center (NMC) is the merchant mariner credentialing authority for the USCG under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security. To ensure a safe, secure, and environmentally sound marine transportation system, the mission of the NMC is to issue credentials to fully qualified mariners in the United States maritime jurisdiction.

===Authority as an armed service===
Title 10 of the U.S. Code says that &quot;[t]he term &quot;armed forces&quot; means the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, and Coast Guard.&quot;
The Coast Guard is further defined by Title 14 of the United States Code: &quot;The Coast Guard as established , shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times. The Coast Guard shall be a service in the Department of Homeland Security, except when operating as a service in the Navy.&quot;
Coast Guard organization and operation is as set forth in Title 33 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

On 25 November 2002, the Homeland Security Act was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush, designating the Coast Guard to be placed under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The transfer of administrative control from the U.S. Department of Transportation to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was completed the following year, on 1 March 2003.

The U.S. Coast Guard reports directly to the civilian secretary of homeland security. However, under as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when Congress so directs in the declaration, or when the President directs, the Coast Guard operates under the Department of Defense as a service in the Department of the Navy.

As members of the military, coast guardsmen on active and reserve service are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and receive the same pay and allowances as members of the same pay grades in the other uniformed services.

The service has participated in every major U.S. conflict from 1790 through today, including landing troops on D-Day and on the Pacific Islands in World War II, in extensive patrols and shore bombardment during the Vietnam War, and multiple roles in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Maritime interception operations, coastal security, transportation security, and law enforcement detachments have been its major roles in recent conflicts in Iraq.

On 17 October 2007, the Coast Guard joined with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps to adopt a new maritime strategy called &quot;A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower&quot; that raised the notion of prevention of war to the same philosophical level as the conduct of war. This new strategy charted a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent regional crises, man-made or natural, from occurring, or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impacts to the United States. During the launch of the new U.S. maritime strategy at the International Seapower Symposium at the U.S. Naval War College in 2007, Coast Guard commandant admiral Thad Allen said the new maritime strategy reinforced the time-honored missions the service has carried out in the United States since 1790. &quot;It reinforces the Coast Guard maritime strategy of safety, security and stewardship, and it reflects not only the global reach of our maritime services but the need to integrate and synchronize and act with our coalition and international partners to not only win wars ... but to prevent wars,&quot; Allen said.

===Authority as a law enforcement agency===
Title 14 USC, section 2 authorizes the Coast Guard to enforce U.S. federal laws. This authority is further defined in , which gives law enforcement powers to all Coast Guard commissioned officers, warrant officers, and petty officers. Unlike the other armed forces branches, which are prevented from acting in a law enforcement capacity by , the Posse Comitatus Act, and Department of Defense policy, the Coast Guard is exempt from and not subject to the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act.

Further law enforcement authority is given by and , which empower U.S. Coast Guard active and reserve commissioned officers, warrant officers, and petty officers as federal customs officers. This places them under , which grants customs officers general federal law enforcement authority, including the authority to:
The U.S. Government Accountability Office Report to the House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary on its 2006 Survey of Federal Civilian Law Enforcement Functions and Authorities, identified the Coast Guard as one of 104 federal components that employed law enforcement officers. The report also included a summary table of the authorities of the Coast Guard&#x27;s 192 special agents and 3,780 maritime law enforcement boarding officers.

Coast Guardsmen have the legal authority to carry their service-issued firearms on and off base. This is rarely done in practice, however; at many Coast Guard stations, commanders prefer to have all service-issued weapons in armories when not in use. Still, one court has held in the case of &quot;People v. Booth&quot; that Coast Guard boarding officers are qualified law enforcement officers authorized to carry personal firearms off-duty for self-defense.

==History==
The Coast Guard traced its roots to the small fleet of vessels maintained by the United States Department of the Treasury beginning in the 1790s to enforce tariffs (an important source of revenue for the new nation). Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton lobbied Congress to fund the construction of ten cutters, which it did on 4 August 1790 (now celebrated as the Coast Guard&#x27;s official birthday). Until the re-establishment of the Navy in 1798, these &quot;revenue cutters&quot; were the only naval force of the early United States. As such, the cutters and their crews frequently took on additional duties, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail. Initially not an organized federal agency at all, merely a &quot;system of cutters,&quot; each ship operated under the direction of the customs officials in the port to which it was assigned. Several names, including &quot;Revenue-Marine,&quot; were used as the service gradually becoming more organized. Eventually it was officially organized as the United States Revenue Cutter Service. In addition to its regular law enforcement and customs duties, revenue cutters and their crews were used to support and supplement the Navy in various armed conflicts including the American Civil War.

A separate federal agency, the U.S. Life-Saving Service, developed alongside the Revenue-Marine. Prior to 1848, there were various charitable efforts at creating systems to provide assistance to shipwrecked mariners from shore-based stations, notably by the Massachusetts Humane Society. The federal government began funding lifesaving stations in 1848 but funding was inconsistent and the system still relied on all-volunteer crews. In 1871, Sumner Increase Kimball was appointed chief of the Treasury Department&#x27;s newly created Revenue Marine Division, and began the process of organizing the Revenue-Marine cutters into a centralized agency. Kimball also pushed for more funding lifesaving stations and eventually secured approval to create the Lifesaving Service as a separate federal agency, also within the Treasury Department, with fulltime paid crews.

In 1915 these two agencies, the Revenue Cutter Service and the Lifesaving Service, were merged to create the modern United States Coast Guard. The Lighthouse Service and the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation were absorbed by the Coast Guard 1939 and 1942 respectively.
In 1967, the Coast Guard moved from the U.S. Department of the Treasury to the newly formed U.S. Department of Transportation, an arrangement that lasted until it was placed under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in 2003 as part of legislation designed to more efficiently protect American interests following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.

In times of war, the Coast Guard or individual components of it can operate as a service of the Department of the Navy. This arrangement has a broad historical basis, as the Coast Guard has been involved in wars as diverse as the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War, and the American Civil War, in which the cutter &quot;Harriet Lane&quot; fired the first naval shots attempting to relieve besieged Fort Sumter. The last time the Coast Guard operated as a whole within the Navy was in World War II, in all some 250,000 served in the Coast Guard during World War II.

Coast Guard Squadron One, was a combat unit formed by the United States Coast Guard in 1965 for service during the Vietnam War. Placed under the operational control of the United States Navy, it was assigned duties in Operation Market Time. Its formation marked the first time since World War II that Coast Guard personnel were used extensively in a combat environment. The squadron operated divisions in three separate areas during the period of 1965 to 1970. Twenty-six Point-class cutters with their crews and a squadron support staff were assigned to the U.S. Navy with the mission of interdicting the movement of arms and supplies from the South China Sea into South Vietnam by Viet Cong and North Vietnam junk and trawler operators. The squadron also provided 81mm mortar naval gunfire support to nearby friendly units operating along the South Vietnamese coastline and assisted the U.S. Navy during Operation Sealords.

Coast Guard Squadron Three, was a combat unit formed by the United States Coast Guard in 1967 for service during the Vietnam War. Placed under the operational control of the United States Navy and based in Pearl Harbor. It consisted of five USCG High Endurance Cutters operating on revolving six-month deployments. A total of 35 High Endurance Cutters took part in operations from May 1967 to December 1971, most notably using their 5-inch guns to provide naval gunfire support missions.

Often units within the Coast Guard operate under Department of the Navy operational control while other Coast Guard units remain under the Department of Homeland Security.

===Deployable Operations Group/Deployable Specialized Forces===
The Deployable Operations Group (DOG) was a Coast Guard command established in July 2007. The DOG established a single command authority to rapidly provide the Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department of Justice and other interagency operational commanders adaptive force packages drawn from the Coast Guard&#x27;s deployable specialized force units. The DOG was disestablished on 22 April 2013 and reorganized into Deployable Specialized Forces (DSF) units were placed under the control of the Atlantic and Pacific Area Commanders.

The planning for the unit began after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, and culminated with its formation on 20 July 2007. Its missions included maritime law enforcement, anti-terrorism, port security, pollution response, and diving operations.

There were over 25 specialized units within the Deployable Operations Group including the Maritime Security Response Team, Maritime Safety and Security Teams, Law Enforcement Detachments, Port Security Units, the National Strike Force, and Regional Dive Lockers. The DOG also managed Coast Guard personnel assigned to the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command and was involved in the selection of Coast Guard candidates to attend Navy BUD/S and serve with Navy SEAL Teams.

==Organization==
The new Department of Homeland Security headquarters complex is on the grounds of the former St. Elizabeths Hospital in the Anacostia section of Southeast Washington, across the Anacostia River from former Coast Guard headquarters.

The fiscal year 2016 budget request for the U.S. Coast Guard was $9.96 billion.
===Districts and units===

The Coast Guard&#x27;s current district organization is divided into 9 districts. Their designations, district office and area of responsibility are as follows:

===Shore establishments===
Shore establishment commands exist to support and facilitate the mission of the sea and air assets and Coastal Defense. U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters is located in Southeast Washington, D.C. Examples of other shore establishment types are Coast Guard Sectors (which may include Coast Guard Bases), Surface Forces Logistics Center (SFLC), Coast Guard Stations, Coast Guard Air Stations, and the United States Coast Guard Yard. Training centers are included in the shore establishment commands. The military college for the USCG is called the United States Coast Guard Academy which trains both new officers through a four year program and enlisted personnel joining the ranks of officers through a 17 week program called Officer Candidate School (OCS). Abbreviated TRACEN, the other Training Centers include Training Center Cape May for enlisted bootcamp, Training Center Petaluma and Training Center Yorktown for enlisted &quot;A&quot; schools and &quot;C&quot; schools, and Coast Guard Aviation Technical Training Center and Coast Guard Aviation Training Center Mobile for aviation enlisted &quot;A&quot; school, &quot;C&quot; schools, and pilot officer training.

==Personnel==
The Coast Guard has a total workforce of 87,569. The formal name for a uniformed member of the Coast Guard is &quot;coast guardsman&quot;, irrespective of gender. &quot;Coastie&quot; is an informal term commonly used to refer to current or former Coast Guard personnel. In 2008, the term &quot;guardian&quot; was introduced as an alternative but was later dropped. Admiral Robert J. Papp Jr. stated that it was his belief that no Commandant had the authority to change what members of the Coast Guard are called as the term coast guardsman is found in Title 14 USC which established the Coast Guard in 1915. &quot;Team Coast Guard&quot; refers to the four components of the Coast Guard as a whole: Regular, Reserve, Auxiliary, and Coast Guard civilian employees.

===Commissioned officers===

Commissioned officers in the Coast Guard hold pay grades ranging from O-1 to O-10 and have the same rank structure as the Navy. Officers holding the rank of ensign (O-1) through lieutenant commander (O-4) are considered junior officers, commanders (O-5) and captains (O-6) are considered senior officers, and rear admirals (O-7) through admirals (O-10) are considered flag officers. The commandant of the Coast Guard and the vice commandant of the Coast Guard are the only members of the Coast Guard authorized to hold the rank of admiral.

The Coast Guard does not have medical officers or chaplains of its own. Instead, chaplains from the U.S. Navy, as well as officers from the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps are assigned to the Coast Guard to perform chaplain-related functions and medical-related functions, respectively. These officers wear Coast Guard uniforms but replace the Coast Guard insignia with that of their own service.

The Navy and Coast Guard share identical officer rank insignia except that Coast Guard officers wear a gold Coast Guard Shield in lieu of a line star or staff corps officer insignia.

===Warrant officers===
Highly qualified enlisted personnel in pay grades E-6 through E-9 with a minimum of eight years&#x27; experience can compete each year for appointment as warrant officers (WO). Successful candidates are chosen by a board and then commissioned as chief warrant officer two (CWO2) in one of twenty-one specialties. Over time, chief warrant officers may be promoted to chief warrant officer three (CWO3) and chief warrant officer four (CWO4). The ranks of warrant officer (WO1) and chief warrant officer five (CWO5) are not currently used in the Coast Guard. Chief warrant officers may also compete for the Chief Warrant Officer to Lieutenant Program. If selected, the warrant officer will be promoted to lieutenant (O-3E). The &quot;E&quot; designates over four years&#x27; active duty service as a warrant officer or enlisted member and entitles the member to a higher rate of pay than other lieutenants.

===Enlisted personnel===

Enlisted members of the Coast Guard have pay grades from E-1 to E-9 and also follow the same rank structure as the Navy. Enlisted members in pay grades of E-4 and higher are considered &quot;petty officers&quot; and follow career development paths very similar to those of Navy petty officers.

Petty officers in pay grade E-7 and higher are &quot;chief petty officers&quot; and must attend the Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Academy, or an equivalent Department of Defense school, in order to be advanced to pay grade E-8. The basic themes of the school are:
* Professionalism
* Leadership
* Communications
* Systems thinking and lifelong learning

Enlisted rank insignia is also nearly identical to Navy enlisted insignia. The Coast Guard shield replacing the petty officer&#x27;s eagle on collar and cap devices for petty officers or enlisted rating insignia for seamen qualified as a &quot;designated striker&quot;. Group Rate marks (stripes) for junior enlisted members (E-3 and below) also follow Navy convention with white for seaman, red for fireman, and green for airman. In a departure from the Navy conventions, all petty officers E-6 and below wear red chevrons and all chief petty officers wear gold.

===Training===

====Officer training====
The U.S. Coast Guard Academy is a four-year service academy located in New London, Connecticut. Approximately 200 cadets graduate each year, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree and a commission as an ensign in the Coast Guard. Graduates are obligated to serve a minimum of five years on active duty. Most graduates are assigned to duty aboard Coast Guard cutters immediately after graduation, either as Deck Watch Officers (DWOs) or as Engineer Officers in Training (EOITs). Smaller numbers are assigned directly to flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida or to shore duty at Coast Guard Sector, District, or Area headquarters units.

In addition to the Academy, prospective officers, who already hold a college degree, may enter the Coast Guard through Officer Candidate School (OCS), also located at the Coast Guard Academy. OCS is a 17-week course of instruction that prepares candidates to serve effectively as officers in the Coast Guard. In addition to indoctrinating students into a military lifestyle, OCS provides a wide range of highly technical information necessary to perform the duties of a Coast Guard officer.

Graduates of OCS are usually commissioned as ensigns, but some with advanced graduate degrees may enter as lieutenants (junior grade) or lieutenants. Graduating OCS officers entering active duty are required to serve a minimum of three years, while graduating reserve officers are required to serve four years. Graduates may be assigned to a cutter, flight training, a staff job, or an operations ashore billet. OCS is the primary channel through which the Coast Guard enlisted grades ascend to the commissioned officer corps. Unlike the other military services, the Coast Guard does not have a Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) program. However, the Coast Guard does have the Select Reserve Direct Commission, an officer program for prospective candidates interested serving as a Coast Guard Reserve Officer.

Lawyers, engineers, intelligence officers, military aviators holding commissions in other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces requesting interservice transfers to the Coast Guard, graduates of maritime academies, and certain other individuals may also receive an officer&#x27;s commission in the Coast Guard through the Direct Commission Officer (DCO) program. Depending on the specific program and the background of the individual, the course is three, four or five weeks long. The first week of the five-week course is an indoctrination week. The DCO program is designed to commission officers with highly specialized professional training or certain kinds of previous military experience.

====Recruit training====

Newly enlisted personnel are sent to eight weeks of recruit training at Coast Guard Training Center Cape May in Cape May, New Jersey. New recruits arrive at Sexton Hall and remain there for three days of initial processing which includes haircuts, vaccinations, uniform issue, and other necessary entrance procedures. During this initial processing period, the new recruits are led by temporary company commanders. These temporary company commanders are tasked with teaching the new recruits how to march and preparing them to enter into their designated company. The temporary company commanders typically do not enforce any physical activity such as push ups or crunches. When the initial processing is complete, the new seaman recruits are introduced to their permanent company commanders who will remain with them until the end of training. There is typically a designated lead company commander and two support company commanders. The balance of the eight-week boot camp is spent in learning teamwork and developing physical skills. An introduction of how the Coast Guard operates with special emphasis on the Coast Guard&#x27;s core values is an important part of the training.

The current nine Recruit Training Objectives are:
* Self-discipline
* Military skills
* Marksmanship
* Vocational skills and academics
* Military bearing
* Physical fitness and wellness
* Water survival and swim qualifications
* Esprit de corps
* Core values (Honor, Respect, and Devotion to Duty)

====Service schools====
Following graduation from recruit training, most members are sent to their first unit while they await orders to attend advanced training in Class &quot;A&quot; Schools. At &quot;A&quot; schools, Coast Guard enlisted personnel are trained in their chosen rating; rating is a Coast Guard and Navy term for enlisted skills synonymous with the Army&#x27;s and Marine Corps&#x27; military occupation codes (MOS) and Air Force&#x27;s Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). Members who earned high ASVAB scores or who were otherwise guaranteed an &quot;A&quot; School of choice while enlisting may go directly to their &quot;A&quot; School upon graduation from Boot Camp.

===Civilian personnel===
The Coast Guard employs over 8,577 civilians in over two hundred different job types including Coast Guard Investigative Service special agents, lawyers, engineers, technicians, administrative personnel, tradesmen, and federal firefighters. Civilian employees work at various levels in the Coast Guard to support its various missions.

==Equipment==
===Cutters===

The Coast Guard operates 243 cutters, defined as any vessel more than long, that has a permanently assigned crew and accommodations for the extended support of that crew.
* National Security Cutter (WMSL): Also known as the Legend-class, these are the Coast Guard&#x27;s latest class of cutter. At 418 ft. these are the largest USCG military cutters in active service. One-for-one, Legend-class ships have replaced individually decommissioned 1960s s, (also known as the High Endurance Cutter (WHEC)). A total of eleven were authorized and budgeted; as of 2021 eight are in service, and two are under construction.
* Medium Endurance Cutter (WMEC): These are mostly the &quot;Reliance&quot;-class, and the Famous-class cutters, although the also falls into this category. Primary missions are law enforcement, search and rescue, and military defense. Heritage-class cutters are expected to eventually replace the &quot;Reliance&quot;- and Famous-class cutters as they are completed.

===Aircraft===

The Coast Guard operates approximately 201 fixed and rotary wing aircraft from 24 Coast Guard Air Stations throughout the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Most of these air stations are tenant activities at civilian airports, several of which are former Air Force Bases and Naval Air Stations, although several are also independent military facilities. Coast Guard Air Stations are also located on active Naval Air Stations, Air National Guard bases, and Army Air Fields.

Coast Guard aviators receive Primary (fixed-wing) and Advanced (fixed or rotary-wing) flight training with their Navy and Marine Corps counterparts at NAS Whiting Field, Florida, and NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, and are considered Naval Aviators. After receiving Naval Aviator Wings, Coast Guard pilots, with the exception of those slated to fly the HC-130, report to U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Training Center, Mobile, Alabama to receive 6–12 weeks of specialized training in the Coast Guard fleet aircraft they will operate. HC-130 pilots report to Little Rock AFB, Arkansas, for joint C-130 training under the auspices of the 314th Airlift Wing of the U.S. Air Force.

Fixed-wing aircraft operate from Air Stations on long-duration missions. Helicopters operate from Air Stations and can deploy on a number of different cutters. Helicopters can rescue people or intercept vessels smuggling migrants or narcotics. Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the Coast Guard has developed a more prominent role in national security and now has armed helicopters operating in high-risk areas for the purpose of maritime law enforcement and anti-terrorism.

The Coast Guard is now developing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) program that will utilize the MQ-9 Reaper platform for homeland security and search/rescue operations. To support this endeavor, the Coast Guard has partnered with the Navy and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to study existing/emerging unmanned aerial system (UAS) capabilities within their respective organizations. As these systems mature, research and operational experience gleaned from this joint effort will enable the Coast Guard to develop its own cutter and land-based UAS capabilities.

===Weapons===
====Naval guns====
Most Coast Guard Cutters have one or more naval gun systems installed, including:

*The Oto Melara 76 mm, a radar-guided computer controlled gun system that is used on Medium Endurance Cutters. The 3-inch gun&#x27;s high rate of fire and availability of specialized ammunition make it a multi-purpose gun capable of anti-shipping, anti-aircraft, ground support, and short-range anti-missile defense.
*The MK 110 57 mm gun, a radar-guided computer controlled variant of the Bofors 57 mm gun. It is used on the Legend-class cutter, also known as the National Security Cutter (NSC). It is a multi-purpose gun capable of anti-shipping, anti-aircraft, and short-range anti-missile defense. The stealth mount has a reduced radar profile. Also, the gun has a small radar mounted on the gun barrel to measure muzzle velocity for fire control purposes and can change ammunition types instantly due to a dual-feed system. It can also be operated/fired manually using a joystick and video camera (mounted on gun).
*The Mk 38 Mod 0 weapons system consists of an M242 Bushmaster 25mm chain gun and the Mk 88 Mod 0 machine gun mount. A manned system, its gyro-stabilization compensates for the pitching deck. It provides ships with defensive and offensive gunfire capability for the engagement of a variety of surface targets. Designed primarily as a close-range defensive measure, it provides protection against patrol boats, floating mines, and various shore-based targets.
*The Mk 38 Mod 2 weapons system is a remotely operated Mk 38 with an electronic optical sight, laser range-finder, FLIR, a more reliable feeding system, all of which enhance the weapon systems capabilities and accuracy.
*The Phalanx CIWS (pronounced &quot;sea-wiz&quot;) is a close-in weapon system for defense against aircraft and anti-ship missiles. it can also be used against a variety of surface targets. Consisting of a radar-guided 20 mm 6-barreled M61 Vulcan cannon mounted on a swiveling base, it is used on the Coast Guard&#x27;s National Security Cutters. This system can operate autonomously against airborne threats or may be manually operated with the use of electronic optical sight, laser range-finder and FLIR systems against surface targets.
*The Sea PROTECTOR MK50 is a remotely controlled gyro-stabilized M2 .50 caliber heavy machine gun. The sight package includes a daylight video camera, a thermal camera and an eye-safe laser rangefinder operated by a joystick. It is also furnished with a fully integrated fire control system that provides ballistic correction. The Mk50s are used on only four Marine Protector-class Cutters, the , , and 

====Small arms and light weapons====
The U.S. Coast Guard uses a wide variety of small arms and light weapons. Handguns, shotguns, and rifles are used to arm boat crew and boarding team members and machine guns are mounted aboard cutters, boats, and helicopters.

Small arms and light weapons arms include:
* Glock 19 Gen 5 MOS
* SIG Sauer P229R DAK .40 S&amp;W pistol (currently being phased out in favor of the Glock 19 Gen5 MOS)
* Remington M870P 12 gauge shotgun
* M4 carbine
* Mk 18 carbine
* M14 Tactical rifle
* Mk 11 (KAC SR-25) 
* Mk 11 Mod 2 precision rifle
* FN M240 machine gun
* M2 .50 caliber heavy machine gun
* Mk 19 40mm grenade launcher
* Barrett M107 .50-caliber rifle, used by marksmen from the Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron and Law Enforcement Detachments to disable the engines on fleeing boats.
* Colt Gold Match M1911 (EIC Competition use)
* Colt M16A4 with precision upper receiver (EIC Competition use)

==Symbols==
===Core values===
The Coast Guard, like the other armed services of the United States, has a set of core values that serve as basic ethical guidelines for all Coast Guard active duty, reservists, auxiliarists, and civilians. The Coast Guard Core Values are:

===The Guardian Ethos===
In 2008, the Coast Guard introduced the Guardian Ethos. As the commandant, Admiral Allen noted in a message to all members of the Coast Guard: [The Ethos] &quot;defines the essence of the Coast Guard,&quot; and is the &quot;contract the Coast Guard and its members make with the nation and its citizens.&quot;

===The Coast Guard Ethos===
In an ALCOAST message effective 1 December 2011 the Commandant, Admiral Papp, directed that the language of &quot;Guardian Ethos&quot; be superseded by the &quot;Coast Guard Ethos&quot; in an effort to use terminology that would help with the identity of personnel serving in the Coast Guard. The term &quot;coast guardsman&quot; is the correct form of address used in Title 14 USC and is the form that has been used historically. This changed the line in the Guardian Ethos &quot;I am a Guardian.&quot; to become &quot;I am a Coast Guardsman.&quot;

The Ethos is:
===Creed of the United States Coast Guardsman===

The &quot;Creed of the United States Coast Guardsman&quot; was written by Vice Admiral Harry G. Hamlet, who served as Commandant of the Coast Guard from 1932 to 1936.

===&quot;You have to go out, but you don&#x27;t have to come back!&quot;===
This unofficial motto of the Coast Guard dates to an 1899 United States Lifesaving Service regulation, which states in part: &quot;In attempting a rescue, ... he will not desist from his efforts until by actual trial, the impossibility of effecting a rescue is demonstrated. The statement of the keeper that he did not try to use the boat because the sea or surf was too heavy will not be accepted, unless attempts to launch it were actually made and failed.&quot;

===Coast Guard ensign===

The Coast Guard ensign (flag) was first flown by the Revenue Cutter Service in 1799 to distinguish revenue cutters from merchant ships. A 1 August 1799 order issued by Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott Jr. specified that the Ensign would be &quot;sixteen perpendicular stripes (for the number of states in the United States at the time), alternate red and white, the union of the ensign to be the arms of the United States in a dark blue on a white field.&quot;

This ensign became familiar in American waters and served as the sign of authority for the Revenue Cutter Service until the early 20th century. The ensign was originally intended to be flown only on revenue cutters and boats connected with the Customs Service but over the years it was found flying atop custom houses as well, and the practice became a requirement in 1874. On 7 June 1910, President William Howard Taft issued an executive order adding an emblem to (or &quot;defacing&quot;) the ensign flown by the Revenue cutters to distinguish it from what is now called the Customs Ensign flown from the custom houses. The emblem was changed to the official seal of the Coast Guard in 1927.

The purpose of the ensign is to allow ship captains to easily recognize those vessels having legal authority to stop and board them. It is flown only as a symbol of law enforcement authority and is never carried as a parade standard.

===Coast Guard standard===
The Coast Guard standard is used in parades and carries the battle honors of the Coast Guard. It was derived from the jack of the Coast Guard ensign which was flown by revenue cutters. The emblem is a blue eagle from the coat of arms of the United States on a white field. Above the eagle are the words &quot;United States Coast Guard&quot; below the eagle is the motto, &quot;Semper Paratus&quot; and the inscription &quot;1790.&quot;
===Service Mark (&quot;Racing Stripe&quot;)===

The Racing Stripe, officially known as the Service Mark, was designed in 1964 by the industrial design office of Raymond Loewy Associates to give the Coast Guard a distinctive, modern image. Loewy had designed the colors for the Air Force One fleet for Jackie Kennedy. President Kennedy was so impressed with his work, he suggested that the entire Federal Government needed his make-over and suggested that he start with the Coast Guard. The stripes are canted at a 64-degree angle, coincidentally the year the Racing Stripe was designed.

The racing stripe is borne by Coast Guard cutters, aircraft, and many boats. First used and placed into official usage as of 6 April 1967, it consists of a narrow blue stripe, a narrow white stripe between, and a broad CG red bar with the Coast Guard shield centered. Red-hulled icebreaker cutters and most HH-65/MH-65 helicopters (i.e., those with a red fuselage) bear a narrow blue stripe, a narrow empty stripe the color of the fuselage (an implied red stripe), and broad white bar, with the Coast Guard shield centered. Conversely, black-hulled cutters (such as buoy tenders and inland construction tenders) use the standard racing stripe. Auxiliary vessels maintained by the Coast Guard also carry the Racing Stripe, but in inverted colors (i.e., broad blue stripe with narrow white and CG red stripes) and the Auxiliary shield. Similar racing stripe designs have been adopted for the use of other coast guards and maritime authorities and many other law enforcement and rescue agencies.

==Uniforms==

For most of the Coast Guard&#x27;s history its uniforms largely mirrored the style of U.S. Navy uniforms, distinguishable only by their insignia. In 1974, under the leadership of Admiral Chester R. Bender, the initial versions of the current Coast Guard Service Dress Blue and Tropical uniforms were introduced. This represented a major departure from many common conventions in naval and maritime uniforms. Notably, &quot;Bender&#x27;s Blues&quot; were a common service dress uniform for all ranks, dispensing with the sailor suit and sailor cap formerly worn by enlisted members. Rank insignia remained consistent with the naval pattern and some distinctly-nautical items such as the pea coat, officer&#x27;s sword, and dress white uniforms remained.

Today, the Coast Guard&#x27;s uniforms remain among the simplest of any branch of the armed forces, with fewer total uniforms and uniform variants than the other armed services. There are only three uniforms that typically serve as standard uniforms of the day—the Operational Dress Uniform, Tropical Blue, and Service Dress Blue (Bravo).

==Coast Guard Reserve==

The United States Coast Guard Reserve is the reserve military force of the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard Reserve was founded on 19 February 1941. The Coast Guard has 8700 reservists who normally drill two days a month and an additional 12 days of active duty each year, although many perform additional drill and active duty periods, to include those mobilized to extended active duty. Coast Guard reservists possess the same training and qualifications as their active duty counterparts, and as such, can be found augmenting active duty Coast Guard units every day.

During the Vietnam War and shortly thereafter, the Coast Guard considered abandoning the reserve program, but the force was instead reoriented into force augmentation, where its principal focus was not just reserve operations, but to add to the readiness and mission execution of every-day active duty personnel.

Since 11 September 2001, reservists have been activated and served on tours of active duty, to include deployments to the Persian Gulf and also as parts of Department of Defense combatant commands such as the U.S. Northern and Central Commands. Coast Guard Port Security Units are entirely staffed with reservists, except for five to seven active duty personnel. Additionally, most of the staffing the Coast Guard provides to the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command are reservists.

The Reserve is managed by the Assistant Commandant for Reserve, Rear Admiral James M. Kelly, USCG.

==Women in the Coast Guard==


There have been women in the United States Coast Guard since 1918, and women continue to serve in it today.

During World War I, in January 1918, radio and telegraph operator Myrtle Hazard enlisted as an electrician. She was the only woman to serve during the war and she is the namesake of USCGC &quot;Myrtle Hazard&quot; . While some newspapers reported that twin sisters Genevieve and Lucille Baker were the first women to serve in the Coast Guard, their attempt to enlist was rejected.

==Coast Guard Auxiliary==

The United States Coast Guard Auxiliary is the uniformed, civilian volunteer component of the United States Coast Guard, created on 23 June 1939 by an act of Congress. Although it is a civilian organization, it was originally named the &quot;United States Coast Guard Reserve&quot; and was later re-named the &quot;United States Coast Guard Auxiliary&quot; on 19 February 1941 when a military reserve force for the Coast Guard was created. As part of &quot;Team Coast Guard&quot; (the term used to collectively describe all active, reserve, auxiliary, and civilian employees), the auxiliary carries out, or assists in, nearly all of the Coast Guard&#x27;s noncombatant and non-law enforcement missions. Auxiliarists are subject to direction from the commandant of the Coast Guard. As of 2022, there were approximately 26,000 members of the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary.

Coast Guard policy has assigned many of its duties related to recreational boating safety to the Auxiliary, including public boating safety education and outreach. This includes offering boating skills courses, liaising with marine-related businesses at the local level, and providing voluntary Vessel Safety Checks (formerly called Courtesy Examinations) to the public. Additionally, Auxiliarists use their own vessels, boats, and aircraft (once registered as Coast Guard facilities) to provide operational support to the Coast Guard by conducting safety patrols, assisting in search and rescue missions, inspecting aids to navigation, and performing other tasks on behalf of the Coast Guard.

Prior to 1997, Auxiliarists were largely limited to activities supporting recreational boating safety. In 1997, however, new legislation authorized the Auxiliary to participate in any and all Coast Guard missions except direct military and direct law enforcement. Auxiliarists may directly augment active duty Coast Guard personnel in non-combat, non-law enforcement roles (e.g. radio communications watch stander, interpreter, cook, etc.) and may assist active duty personnel in inspecting commercial vessels and maintaining aids-to-navigation. Auxiliarists may support the law enforcement and homeland security missions of the Coast Guard but may not directly participate (make arrests, etc.), and Auxiliarists are not permitted to carry a weapon while serving in any Auxiliary capacity.

==Medals and honors==

One coast guardsman, Douglas Albert Munro, has earned the Medal of Honor, the highest military award of the United States. Fifty-five coast guardsmen have earned the Navy Cross and numerous men and women have earned the Distinguished Flying Cross.

The highest peacetime decoration awarded within the Coast Guard is the Homeland Security Distinguished Service Medal; prior to the transfer of the Coast Guard to the Department of Homeland Security, the highest peacetime decoration was the Department of Transportation Distinguished Service Medal. The highest unit award available is the Presidential Unit Citation.

In wartime, members of the Coast Guard are eligible to receive the Navy version of the Medal of Honor. A Coast Guard Medal of Honor is authorized but has not yet been developed or issued.

In May 2006, at the Change of Command ceremony when Admiral Thad Allen took over as Commandant, President George W. Bush awarded the entire Coast Guard, including the Coast Guard Auxiliary, the Coast Guard Presidential Unit Citation with hurricane device, for its efforts during and after Hurricane Katrina and Tropical Storm Rita.

==Notable coast guardsmen==
Numerous celebrities have served in the Coast Guard including tennis player Jack Kramer, golfer Arnold Palmer, All Star baseball player Sid Gordon, boxer Jack Dempsey; surfer and inventor Tom Blake; musicians Kai Winding, Rudy Vallee, Derroll Adams, and Tom Waits; actors Buddy Ebsen, Sid Caesar, Victor Mature, Richard Cromwell, Alan Hale Jr., William Hopper, Beau Bridges, Jeff Bridges, Cesar Romero; author Alex Haley; and Senator Claiborne Pell.

Vice Admiral Thad Allen in 2005 was named Principal Federal Officer to oversee recovery efforts in the Gulf Region after Hurricane Katrina. After promotion to Admiral, on the eve of his retirement as Commandant, Allen again received national visibility after being named National Incident Commander overseeing the response efforts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Former Coast Guard officers have been appointed to numerous civilian government offices. After retiring as Commandant of the Coast Guard in 2002, Admiral James Loy went on to serve as United States deputy secretary of homeland security. After their respective Coast Guard careers, Carlton Skinner served as the first civilian governor of Guam; G. William Miller, 65th secretary of the treasury, and retired vice admiral Harvey E. Johnson Jr. served as Deputy Administrator and Chief Operating Officer of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under President George W. Bush. Rear Admiral Stephen W. Rochon was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve as the director of the executive residence and White House chief usher, beginning service on 12 March 2007, and continued to serve in the same capacity under President Barack Obama.

Two Coast Guard aviators, Commander Bruce E. Melnick and Captain Daniel C. Burbank, have served as NASA astronauts. Coast Guard Reserve commander Andre Douglas was selected in 2021 to join NASA Astronaut Group 23.

Signalman First Class Douglas Albert Munro was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously, and is the only coast guardsman to ever receive this honor.

==Organizations==

===Coast Guard Aviation Association===
Those who have piloted or flown in Coast Guard aircraft under official flight orders may join the Coast Guard Aviation Association which was formerly known as the &quot;Ancient Order of the Pterodactyl&quot; (&quot;Flying Since the World was Flat&quot;). The Ancient Albatross Award is presented to the active duty USCG member who qualified as an aviator earlier than any other person who is still serving. Separate enlisted and officer awards are given.

===Coast Guard CW Operators Association===
The Coast Guard CW Operators Association (CGCWOA) is a membership organization comprising primarily former members of the United States Coast Guard who held the enlisted rating of Radioman (RM) or Telecommunications Specialist (TC), and who employed International Morse Code (CW) in their routine communications duties on Coast Guard cutters and at shore stations.

===USCG Chief Petty Officers Association===
Members of this organization unite to assist members and dependents in need, assist with Coast Guard recruiting efforts, support the aims and goals of the Coast Guard Chief Petty Officers Academy, keep informed on Coast Guard matters, and assemble for social amenities; and include Chief, Senior Chief, and Master Chief Petty Officers, active, reserve and retired. Membership is also open to all Chief Warrant Officers and Officers who have served as a Chief Petty Officer.

===USCG Chief Warrant and Warrant Officers Association (CWOA)===
Established in 1929, the Chief Warrant and Warrant Officers Association, United States Coast Guard (CWOA) represents Coast Guard warrant and chief warrant officers (active, reserve and retired) to the Congress, White House and the Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, the association communicates with the Coast Guard leadership on matters of concern to Coast Guard chief warrant officers.

==In popular culture==
The U.S. Coast Guard maintains a Motion Picture and Television Office (MOPIC) in Hollywood, California, along with its sister services at the Department of Defense dedicated to enhancing public awareness and understanding of the Coast Guard, its people, and its missions through a cooperative effort with the entertainment industry.

<text>The United Religions Initiative (URI) is a global grassroots interfaith network.

It has local and global initiatives through more than 1100 member groups and organizations, called Cooperation Circles, to engage in community action such as conflict resolution and reconciliation, environmental sustainability, education, women&#x27;s and youth programs, and advocacy for human rights.

The organization was founded by William E. Swing, along with David Cooperrider and Diana Whitney. The URI Charter was signed by more than 200 people present, and hundreds more joining over the Internet, at a ceremony in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US, on June 26, 2000.

URI also holds consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

==Activities==

Before the formal charter signing in 2000, URI supporters around the world participated together in a project called &quot;72 Hours for Peace&quot;, in which more than 250 local organizations united in projects promoting peace and justice during the turn of the millennium.

Examples of global and member initiatives documented in the public record:

* The Acholi Religious Leaders Peace Initiative has played a key role in promoting peace in war-torn northern Uganda. The Ugandan groups are also participants in the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund supported by the World Bank.

<text>USS &quot;City of Corpus Christi&quot; (SSN-705), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Corpus Christi, Texas. The Navy originally planned to use the name &quot;USS &quot;Corpus Christi&quot;.&quot;

==Etymology==
The &quot;City of&quot; prefix was added before its 1983 commissioning to clarify that the ship is meant to honor the city, in response to Catholic politicians who protested against naming a warship using Latin words which translate to &quot;Body of Christ.&quot;

==History==
The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 31 October 1973 and her keel was laid down on 4 September 1979. She was launched on 25 April 1981 sponsored by Mrs. John Tower, and commissioned on 8 January 1983. The ship&#x27;s patch was chosen by the crew based on entries to an art contest sponsored by the Corpus Christi, Texas city government.

During the naval Exercise Malabar, between the navies of India, the United States and Japan, in a simulated battle, the Indian Navy&#x27;s reportedly scored a kill against &quot;City of Corpus Christi&quot;. &quot;Sindhudhvaj&quot; is a Soviet-built , but upgraded with the Indian USHUS sonar.

The ship is currently berthed at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, having moved there after being deactivated on 30 May 2016.

<doc id="32231" wikidata="Q1617" url="?curid=32231" title="Urdu">
<text>Urdu (; , , ) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken chiefly in South Asia. It is the national language and &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Pakistan. In India, it is an Eighth Schedule language, the status and cultural heritage of which are recognised by the Constitution of India. It also has an official status in several Indian states. 

Urdu and Hindi share a common, predominantly Sanskrit- and Prakrit-derived, vocabulary base, phonology, syntax, and grammar, making them mutually intelligible during colloquial communication. The common base of the two languages is sometimes referred to as the Hindustani language, or Hindi-Urdu, and Urdu has been described as a Persianised standard register of the Hindustani language. While formal Urdu draws literary, political, and technical vocabulary from Persian, formal Hindi draws these aspects from Sanskrit; consequently, the two languages&#x27; mutual intelligibility effectively decreases as the factor of formality increases.

Urdu originated in what is today the Meerut division of Western Uttar Pradesh, a region adjoining Old Delhi and geographically in the upper Ganga-Jumna doab, or the interfluve between the Yamuna and Ganges rivers in India; significant development of the language also occurred in the Deccan Plateau. In 1837, Urdu became an official language of the British East India Company, replacing Persian across northern India during Company rule; Persian had until this point served as the court language of various Indo-Islamic empires. Religious, social, and political factors arose during the European colonial period that advocated a distinction between Urdu and Hindi, leading to the Hindi–Urdu controversy.

According to 2022 estimates by &quot;Ethnologue&quot; and &quot;The World Factbook&quot;, produced by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Urdu is the 10th-most widely spoken language in the world, with million total speakers, including those who speak it as a second language.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Urdu&quot; was first used by the poet Ghulam Hamadani Mushafi around 1780 for Hindustani language, even though he himself also used &quot;Hindavi&quot; term in his poetry to define the language. &quot;Ordu&quot; means army in the Turkic languages. In late 18th century, it was known as &quot;Zaban-e-Urdu-e-Mualla&quot; &quot;&quot; means &quot;language of the exalted camp&quot;. Earlier it was known as Hindvi, Hindi and Hindustani.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

Urdu, like Hindi, is a form of Hindustani language. Some linguists have suggested that the earliest forms of Urdu evolved from the medieval (6th to 13th century) Apabhraṃśa register of the preceding Shauraseni language, a Middle Indo-Aryan language that is also the ancestor of other modern Indo-Aryan languages. In the Delhi region of India the native language was Khariboli, whose earliest form is known as Old Hindi (or Hindavi). It belongs to the Western Hindi group of the Central Indo-Aryan languages. The contact of Hindu and Muslim cultures during the period of Islamic conquests in the Indian subcontinent (12th to 16th centuries) led to the development of Hindustani as a product of a composite Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb.

In cities such as Delhi, the ancient language Old Hindi began to acquire many Persian loanwords and continued to be called &quot;Hindi&quot; and later, also &quot;Hindustani&quot;. An early literary tradition of Hindavi was founded by Amir Khusrau in the late 13th century, who has been called &quot;the father of Urdu literature&quot;. After the conquest of the Deccan, and a subsequent immigration of noble Muslim families into the south, a form of the language flourished in medieval India as a vehicle of poetry, (especially under the Bahmanids), and is known as Dakhini, which contains loanwords from Telugu and Marathi.

From the 13th century until the end of the 18th century; the language now known as Urdu was called &quot;Hindi&quot;, &quot;Hindavi&quot;, &quot;Hindustani&quot;, &quot;Dehlavi&quot;, &quot;Dihlawi&quot;, &quot;Lahori&quot;, and &quot;Lashkari&quot;. The Delhi Sultanate established Persian as its official language in India, a policy continued by the Mughal Empire, which extended over most of northern South Asia from the 16th to 18th centuries and cemented Persian influence on Hindustani. Urdu was patronised by the Nawab of Awadh and in Lucknow, the language was refined, being not only spoken in the court, but by the common people in the city—both Hindus and Muslims; the city of Lucknow gave birth to Urdu prose literature, with a notable novel being &quot;Umrao Jaan Ada&quot;.
According to the Navadirul Alfaz by Khan-i Arzu, the &quot;Zaban-e Urdu-e Shahi&quot; [language of the Imperial Camp] had attained special importance in the time of Alamgir&quot;. By the end of the reign of Aurangzeb in the early 1700s, the common language around Delhi began to be referred to as &quot;Zaban-e-Urdu&quot;, a name derived from the Turkic word &quot;ordu&quot; (army) or &quot;orda&quot; and is said to have arisen as the &quot;language of the camp&quot;, or &quot;&quot;Zaban-i-Ordu&quot; means &quot;Language of High camps&quot;&quot; or natively &quot;&quot;Lashkari Zaban&quot; means &quot;Language&quot; &quot;of&quot; &quot;Army&quot;&quot; even though term Urdu held different meanings at that time. It is recorded that Aurangzeb spoke in Hindvi, which was most likely Persianized, as there are substantial evidence that Hindvi was written in the Persian script in this period.

During this time period Urdu was referred to as &quot;Moors&quot;, which simply meant Muslim, by European writers. John Ovington wrote in 1689:

The language of the Moors is different from that of the ancient original inhabitants of India but is obliged to these Gentiles for its characters. For though the &quot;Moors dialect&quot; is peculiar to themselves, yet it is destitute of Letters to express it; and therefore, in all their Writings in their Mother Tongue, they borrow their letters from the Heathens, or from the Persians, or other Nations.

In 1715, a complete literary Diwan in Rekhta was written by Nawab Sadruddin Khan. An Urdu-Persian dictionary was written by Khan-i Arzu in 1751 in the reign of Ahmad Shah Bahadur. The name &quot;Urdu&quot; was first introduced by the poet Ghulam Hamadani Mushafi around 1780. As a literary language, Urdu took shape in courtly, elite settings. While Urdu retained the grammar and core Indo-Aryan vocabulary of the local Indian dialect Khariboli, it adopted the Perso-Arab writing system, written in the Nastaleeq style. – which was developed as a style of Persian calligraphy.

=== Other historical names ===

Throughout the history of the language, Urdu has been referred to by several other names: Hindi, Hindavi, Rekhta, Urdu-e-Muallah, Dakhini, Moors and Dehlavi.

In 1773, the Swiss French soldier Antoine Polier notes that the English liked to use the name &quot;Moors&quot; for Urdu:
I have a deep knowledge [&quot;je possède à fond&quot;] of the common tongue of India, called &quot;Moors&quot; by the English, and &quot;Ourdouzebain&quot; by the natives of the land.

Several works of Sufi writers like Ashraf Jahangir Semnani used similar names for the Urdu language. Shah Abdul Qadir Raipuri was the first person who translated The Quran into Urdu.

During Shahjahan&#x27;s time, the Capital was relocated to Delhi and named Shahjahanabad and the Bazar of the town was named Urdu e Muallah.

In the Akbar era, the word Rekhta was used to describe Urdu for the first time. It was originally a Persian word that meant &quot;to create a mixture&quot;. Amir Khusrau was the first person to use the same word for Poetry.

=== Colonial period ===
Before the standardisation of Urdu into colonial administration, British officers often referred to the language as &quot;Moors&quot; or &quot;Moorish jargon&quot;. John Gilchrist was the first in British India to begin a systematic study on Urdu and began to use the term &quot;Hindustani&quot; what the majority of Europeans called &quot;Moors&quot;, authoring the book &quot;The Strangers&#x27;s East Indian Guide to the Hindoostanee or Grand Popular Language of India (improperly Called Moors)&quot;.

Urdu was then promoted in colonial India by British policies to counter the previous emphasis on Persian. In colonial India, &quot;ordinary Muslims and Hindus alike spoke the same language in the United Provinces in the nineteenth century, namely Hindustani, whether called by that name or whether called Hindi, Urdu, or one of the regional dialects such as Braj or Awadhi.&quot; Elites from Muslim communities, as well as a minority of Hindu elites, such as Munshis of Hindu origin, wrote the language in the Perso-Arabic script in courts and government offices, though Hindus continued to employ the Devanagari script in certain literary and religious contexts. Through the late 19th century, people did not view Urdu and Hindi as being two distinct languages, though in urban areas, the standardised Hindustani language was increasingly being referred to as Urdu and written in the Perso-Arabic script. Urdu and English replaced Persian as the official languages in northern parts of India in 1837. In colonial Indian Islamic schools, Muslims were taught Persian and Arabic as the languages of Indo-Islamic civilisation; the British, in order to promote literacy among Indian Muslims and attract them to attend government schools, started to teach Urdu written in the Perso-Arabic script in these governmental educational institutions and after this time, Urdu began to be seen by Indian Muslims as a symbol of their religious identity. Hindus in northwestern India, under the Arya Samaj agitated against the sole use of the Perso-Arabic script and argued that the language should be written in the native Devanagari script, which triggered a backlash against the use of Hindi written in Devanagari by the Anjuman-e-Islamia of Lahore. Hindi in the Devanagari script and Urdu written in the Perso-Arabic script established a sectarian divide of &quot;Urdu&quot; for Muslims and &quot;Hindi&quot; for Hindus, a divide that was formalised with the partition of colonial India into the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan after independence (though there are Hindu poets who continue to write in Urdu, including Gopi Chand Narang and Gulzar Dehlvi). The Hindi-Urdu controversy in 1867, highlighted the linguistic and cultural divide between Hindus and Muslims in British India, promoting Urdu as a symbol of Muslim identity. This division played an important role in the political movement of Muslims, eventually leading to the formation of the Muslim League in 1906, whose formation eventually resulted in the creation of Pakistan, as a separate Muslim state.

Urdu had been used as a literary medium for British colonial Indian writers from the Bombay, Bengal, Orissa, and Hyderabad State as well.

=== Post-Partition ===
Before independence, Muslim League leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah advocated the use of Urdu, which he used as a symbol of national cohesion in Pakistan. Like other Muslim religious and political leaders, The scholar and linguist Abdul Haq, who has been called &quot;Baba-e-Urdu&quot; (&quot;Father of Urdu&quot;) also demanded Urdu to be the national language of Pakistan. In the early years of Pakistan, the finance departments, bureaucracy, and other major institutions of the country were mostly managed by Urdu-speaking population of the country. After the Bengali language movement and the separation of former East Pakistan, Urdu was recognised as the sole national language of Pakistan in 1973, although English and regional languages were also granted official recognition. Following the 1979 Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan and subsequent arrival of millions of Afghan refugees who have lived in Pakistan for many decades, many Afghans, including those who moved back to Afghanistan, have also become fluent in Hindi-Urdu, an occurrence aided by exposure to the Indian media, chiefly Hindi-Urdu Bollywood films and songs.

There have been attempts to purge Urdu of native Prakrit and Sanskrit words, and Hindi of Persian loanwords – new vocabulary draws primarily from Persian and Arabic for Urdu and from Sanskrit for Hindi. English has exerted a heavy influence on both as a co-official language. According to Bruce (2021), Urdu has adapted English words since the eighteenth century. A movement towards the hyper-Persianisation of an Urdu emerged in Pakistan since its independence in 1947 which is &quot;as artificial as&quot; the hyper-Sanskritised Hindi that has emerged in India; hyper-Persianisation of Urdu was prompted in part by the increasing Sanskritisation of Hindi. However, the style of Urdu spoken on a day-to-day basis in Pakistan is akin to neutral Hindustani that serves as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the northern Indian subcontinent.

In India, since at least 1977, some commentators such as journalist Khushwant Singh have characterised Urdu as a &quot;dying language&quot;, though others, such as Indian poet and writer Gulzar (who is popular in both countries and both language communities, but writes only in Urdu (script) and has difficulties reading Devanagari, so he lets others &#x27;transcribe&#x27; his work) have disagreed with this assessment and state that Urdu &quot;is the most alive language and moving ahead with times&quot; in India. This phenomenon pertains to the decrease in relative and absolute numbers of native Urdu speakers as opposed to speakers of other languages; declining (advanced) knowledge of Urdu&#x27;s Perso-Arabic script, Urdu vocabulary and grammar; the role of translation and transliteration of literature from and into Urdu; the shifting cultural image of Urdu and socio-economic status associated with Urdu speakers (which negatively impacts especially their employment opportunities in both countries), the &quot;de jure&quot; legal status and &quot;de facto&quot; political status of Urdu, how much Urdu is used as language of instruction and chosen by students in higher education, and how the maintenance and development of Urdu is financially and institutionally supported by governments and NGOs. In India, although Urdu is not and never was used exclusively by Muslims (and Hindi never exclusively by Hindus), the ongoing Hindi–Urdu controversy and modern cultural association of each language with the two religions has led to fewer Hindus using Urdu. In the 20th century, Indian Muslims gradually began to collectively embrace Urdu (for example, &#x27;post-independence Muslim politics of Bihar saw a mobilisation around the Urdu language as tool of empowerment for minorities especially coming from weaker socio-economic backgrounds&#x27;), but in the early 21st century an increasing percentage of Indian Muslims began switching to Hindi due to socio-economic factors, such as Urdu being abandoned as the language of instruction in much of India, and having limited employment opportunities compared to Hindi, English and regional languages. The number of Urdu speakers in India fell 1.5% between 2001 and 2011 (then 5.08 million Urdu speakers), especially in the most Urdu-speaking states of Uttar Pradesh (c. 8% to 5%) and Bihar (c. 11.5% to 8.5%), even though the number of Muslims in these two states grew in the same period. Although Urdu is still very prominent in early 21st-century Indian pop culture, ranging from Bollywood to social media, knowledge of the Urdu script and the publication of books in Urdu have steadily declined, while policies of the Indian government do not actively support the preservation of Urdu in professional and official spaces. Because the Pakistani government proclaimed Urdu the national language at Partition, the Indian state and some religious nationalists began in part to regard Urdu as a &#x27;foreign&#x27; language, to be viewed with suspicion. Urdu advocates in India disagree whether it should be allowed to write Urdu in the Devanagari and Latin script (Roman Urdu) to allow its survival, or whether this will only hasten its demise and that the language can only be preserved if expressed in the Perso-Arabic script. Throughout India, various states have established an Urdu Academy to promote the use of Urdu and Urdu literature.

For Pakistan, Willoughby &amp; Aftab (2020) argued that Urdu originally had the image of a refined elite language of the Enlightenment, progress and emancipation, which contributed to the success of the independence movement. But after the 1947 Partition, when it was chosen as the national language of Pakistan to unite all inhabitants with one linguistic identity, it faced serious competition primarily from Bengali (spoken by 56% of the total population, mostly in East Pakistan until that attained independence in 1971 as Bangladesh), and after 1971 from English. Both pro-independence elites that formed the leadership of the Muslim League in Pakistan and the Hindu-dominated Congress Party in India had been educated in English during the British colonial period, and continued to operate in English and send their children to English-medium schools as they continued dominate both countries&#x27; post-Partition politics. Although the Anglicized elite in Pakistan has made attempts at Urduisation of education with varying degrees of success, no successful attempts were ever made to Urduise politics, the legal system, the army, or the economy, all of which remained solidly Anglophone. Even the regime of general Zia-ul-Haq (1977–1988), who came from a middle-class Punjabi family and initially fervently supported a rapid and complete Urduisation of Pakistani society (earning him the honorary title of the &#x27;Patron of Urdu&#x27; in 1981), failed to make significant achievements, and by 1987 had abandoned most of his efforts in favour of pro-English policies. Since the 1960s, the Urdu lobby and eventually the Urdu language in Pakistan has been associated with religious Islamism and political national conservatism (and eventually the lower and lower-middle classes, alongside regional languages such as Punjabi, Sindhi, and Balochi), while English has been associated with the internationally oriented secular and progressive left (and eventually the upper and upper-middle classes). Despite governmental attempts at Urduisation of Pakistan, the position and prestige of English only grew stronger in the meantime.

== Demographics and geographic distribution ==
There are over 100 million native speakers of Urdu in India and Pakistan together: there were 50.8 million Urdu speakers in India (4.34% of the total population) as per the 2011 census; and approximately 16 million in Pakistan in 2006. There are several hundred thousand in the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, United States, and Bangladesh. However, Hindustani, of which Urdu is one variety, is spoken much more widely, forming the third most commonly spoken language in the world, after Mandarin and English. The syntax (grammar), morphology, and the core vocabulary of Urdu and Hindi are essentially identical – thus linguists usually count them as one single language, while some contend that they are considered as two different languages for socio-political reasons.

Owing to interaction with other languages, Urdu has become localised wherever it is spoken, including in Pakistan. Urdu in Pakistan has undergone changes and has incorporated and borrowed many words from regional languages, thus allowing speakers of the language in Pakistan to distinguish themselves more easily and giving the language a decidedly Pakistani flavor. Similarly, the Urdu spoken in India can also be distinguished into many dialects such as the Standard Urdu of Lucknow and Delhi, as well as the Dakhni (Deccan) of South India. Because of Urdu&#x27;s similarity to Hindi, speakers of the two languages can easily understand one another if both sides refrain from using literary vocabulary.

=== Pakistan ===
Although Urdu is widely spoken and understood throughout all of Pakistan, only 9% of Pakistan&#x27;s population spoke Urdu according to the 2023 Pakistani census. Most of the nearly three million Afghan refugees of different ethnic origins (such as Pashtun, Tajik, Uzbek, Hazarvi, and Turkmen) who stayed in Pakistan for over twenty-five years have also become fluent in Urdu. Muhajirs since 1947 have historically formed the majority population in the city of Karachi, however. Many newspapers are published in Urdu in Pakistan, including the &quot;Daily Jang&quot;, &quot;Nawa-i-Waqt&quot;, and &quot;Millat&quot;.

No region in Pakistan uses Urdu as its mother tongue, though it is spoken as the first language of many people among the community known as Muhajirs (a multi-origin ethnic group of Pakistan), who left India after independence in 1947; these Muhajirs were from various parts of India, with Urdu speakers predominantly hailing from United Provinces (Uttar Pradesh), Delhi, Central Provinces (Madhya Pradesh), Bihar and Hyderabad. Other communities, most notably the Punjabi elite of Pakistan, have adopted Urdu as a mother tongue and identify with both an Urdu speaker as well as Punjabi identity. Urdu was chosen as a symbol of unity for the new state of Pakistan in 1947, because it had already served as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; among Muslims in north and northwest British India. It is written, spoken and used in all provinces/territories of Pakistan, and together with English as the main languages of instruction, although the people from differing provinces may have different native languages.

Urdu is taught as a compulsory subject up to higher secondary school in both English and Urdu medium school systems, which has produced millions of second-language Urdu speakers among people whose native language is one of the other languages of Pakistan – which in turn has led to the absorption of vocabulary from various regional Pakistani languages, while some Urdu vocabularies has also been assimilated by Pakistan&#x27;s regional languages. Some who are from a non-Urdu background now can read and write only Urdu. With such a large number of people(s) speaking Urdu, the language has acquired a peculiar regional flavor further distinguishing it from the Urdu spoken by native speakers, resulting in more diversity within the language.

=== India ===
In India, Urdu is spoken in places where there are large Muslim minorities or cities that were bases for Muslim empires in the past. These include parts of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra (Marathwada and Konkanis), Karnataka and cities such as Hyderabad, Lucknow, Delhi, Malerkotla, Bareilly, Meerut, Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Roorkee, Deoband, Moradabad, Azamgarh, Bijnor, Najibabad, Rampur, Aligarh, Allahabad, Gorakhpur, Agra, Firozabad, Kanpur, Badaun, Bhopal, Hyderabad, Aurangabad, Bangalore, Kolkata, Mysore, Patna, Darbhanga, Gaya, Madhubani, Samastipur, Siwan, Saharsa, Supaul, Muzaffarpur, Nalanda, Munger, Bhagalpur, Araria, Gulbarga, Parbhani, Nanded, Malegaon, Bidar, Ajmer, and Ahmedabad. In a very significant number among the nearly 800 districts of India, there is a small Urdu-speaking minority at least. In Araria district, Bihar, there is a plurality of Urdu speakers and near-plurality in Hyderabad district, Telangana (43.35% Telugu speakers and 43.24% Urdu speakers).

Some Indian Muslim schools (Madrasa) teach Urdu as a first language and have their own syllabi and exams. In fact, the language of Bollywood films tend to contain a large number of Persian and Arabic words and thus considered to be &quot;Urdu&quot; in a sense, especially in songs.

India has more than 3,000 Urdu publications, including 405 daily Urdu newspapers. Newspapers such as &quot;Neshat News Urdu&quot;, &quot;Sahara Urdu&quot;, &quot;Daily Salar&quot;, &quot;Hindustan Express&quot;, &quot;Daily Pasban&quot;, &quot;Siasat Daily&quot;, &quot;The Munsif Daily&quot; and &quot;Inqilab&quot; are published and distributed in Bangalore, Malegaon, Mysore, Hyderabad, and Mumbai.

=== Elsewhere ===
In Nepal, Urdu is a registered regional dialect and in South Africa, it is a protected language in the constitution. It is also spoken as a minority language in Afghanistan and Bangladesh, with no official status.

Outside South Asia, it is spoken by large numbers of migrant South Asian workers in the major urban centres of the Persian Gulf countries. Urdu is also spoken by large numbers of immigrants and their children in the major urban centres of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, and Australia. Along with Arabic, Urdu is among the immigrant languages with the most speakers in Catalonia.

== Cultural identity ==
=== Colonial India ===
Religious and social atmospheres in early nineteenth century India played a significant role in the development of the Urdu register. Hindi became the distinct register spoken by those who sought to construct a Hindu identity in the face of colonial rule. As Hindi separated from Hindustani to create a distinct spiritual identity, Urdu was employed to create a definitive Islamic identity for the Muslim population in India. Urdu&#x27;s use was not confined only to northern India – it had been used as a literary medium for Indian writers from the Bombay Presidency, Bengal, Orissa Province, and Tamil Nadu as well.

As Urdu and Hindi became means of religious and social construction for Muslims and Hindus respectively, each register developed its own script. According to Islamic tradition, Arabic, the language of Muhammad and the Qur&#x27;an, holds spiritual significance and power. Because Urdu was intentioned as means of unification for Muslims in Northern India and later Pakistan, it adopted a modified Perso-Arabic script.

=== Pakistan ===
Urdu continued its role in developing a national identity of the country, as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was established with the intent to construct a homeland for the Muslims of Colonial India. Several languages and dialects spoken throughout the regions of Pakistan produced an imminent need for a uniting language. Urdu was chosen as a symbol of unity for the new Dominion of Pakistan in 1947, because it had already served as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; among Muslims in north and northwest of British Indian Empire. Urdu is also seen as a repertory for the cultural and social heritage of Pakistan.

While Urdu and Islam together played important roles in developing the national identity of Pakistan, disputes in the 1950s (particularly those in East Pakistan, where Bengali was the dominant language), challenged the idea of Urdu as a national symbol and its practicality as the &quot;lingua franca&quot;. The significance of Urdu as a national symbol was downplayed by these disputes when English and Bengali were also accepted as official languages in the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).

== Official status ==
=== Pakistan ===
Urdu is the sole national, and one of the two official languages of Pakistan (along with English). It is spoken and understood throughout the country, whereas the state-by-state languages (languages spoken throughout various regions) are the provincial languages, although only 7.57% of Pakistanis speak Urdu as their first language. Its official status has meant that Urdu is understood and spoken widely throughout Pakistan as a second or third language. It is used in education, literature, office and court business, although in practice, English is used instead of Urdu in the higher echelons of government. Article 251(1) of the Pakistani Constitution mandates that Urdu be implemented as the sole language of government, though English continues to be the most widely used language at the higher echelons of Pakistani government.

=== India ===
Urdu is also one of the officially recognised languages in India and also has the status of &quot;additional official language&quot; in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Telangana and the national capital territory Delhi. Also as one of the five official languages of Jammu and Kashmir.

India established the governmental Bureau for the Promotion of Urdu in 1969, although the Central Hindi Directorate was established earlier in 1960, and the promotion of Hindi is better funded and more advanced, while the status of Urdu has been undermined by the promotion of Hindi. Private Indian organisations such as the Anjuman-e-Tariqqi Urdu, Deeni Talimi Council and Urdu Mushafiz Dasta promote the use and preservation of Urdu, with the Anjuman successfully launching a campaign that reintroduced Urdu as an official language of Bihar in the 1970s. In the former Jammu and Kashmir state, section 145 of the Kashmir Constitution stated: &quot;The official language of the State shall be Urdu but the English language shall unless the Legislature by law otherwise provides, continue to be used for all the official purposes of the State for which it was being used immediately before the commencement of the Constitution.&quot;

== Dialects ==
Urdu became a literary language in the 18th century and two similar standard forms came into existence in Delhi and Lucknow. Since the partition of India in 1947, a third standard has arisen in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Deccani, an older form used in southern India, became a court language of the Deccan sultanates by the 16th century.
Urdu has a few recognised dialects, including Dakhni, Dhakaiya, Rekhta, and Modern Vernacular Urdu (based on the Khariboli dialect of the Delhi region). Dakhni (also known as Dakani, Deccani, Desia, Mirgan) is spoken in Deccan region of southern India. It is distinct by its mixture of vocabulary from Marathi and Konkani, as well as some vocabulary from Arabic, Persian and Chagatai that are not found in the standard dialect of Urdu. Dakhini is widely spoken in all parts of Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Urdu is read and written as in other parts of India. A number of daily newspapers and several monthly magazines in Urdu are published in these states.

Dhakaiya Urdu is a dialect native to the city of Old Dhaka in Bangladesh, dating back to the Mughal era. However, its popularity, even among native speakers, has been gradually declining since the Bengali Language Movement in the 20th century. It is not officially recognised by the Government of Bangladesh. The Urdu spoken by Stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh is different from this dialect.

=== Code switching ===
Many bilingual or multi-lingual Urdu speakers, being familiar with both Urdu and English, display code-switching (referred to as &quot;Urdish&quot;) in certain localities and between certain social groups. On 14 August 2015, the Government of Pakistan launched the &quot;Ilm&quot; Pakistan movement, with a uniform curriculum in Urdish. Ahsan Iqbal, Federal Minister of Pakistan, said &quot;Now the government is working on a new curriculum to provide a new medium to the students which will be the combination of both Urdu and English and will name it Urdish.&quot;

== Comparison with Modern Standard Hindi ==

Standard Urdu is often compared with Standard Hindi. Both Urdu and Hindi, which are considered standard registers of the same language, Hindustani (or Hindi-Urdu), share a core vocabulary and grammar.

Apart from religious associations, the differences are largely restricted to the standard forms: Standard Urdu is conventionally written in the Nastaliq style of the Persian alphabet and relies heavily on Persian and Arabic as a source for technical and literary vocabulary, whereas Standard Hindi is conventionally written in Devanāgarī and draws on Sanskrit. However, both share a core vocabulary of native Sanskrit and Prakrit derived words and a significant number of Arabic and Persian loanwords, with a consensus of linguists considering them to be two standardised forms of the same language and consider the differences to be sociolinguistic; a few classify them separately. The two languages are often considered to be a single language (Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu) on a dialect continuum ranging from Persianised to Sanskritised vocabulary, but now they are more and more different in words due to politics. Old Urdu dictionaries also contain most of the Sanskrit words now present in Hindi.

Mutual intelligibility decreases in literary and specialised contexts that rely on academic or technical vocabulary. In a longer conversation, differences in formal vocabulary and pronunciation of some Urdu phonemes are noticeable, though many native Hindi speakers also pronounce these phonemes. At a phonological level, speakers of both languages are frequently aware of the Perso-Arabic or Sanskrit origins of their word choice, which affects the pronunciation of those words. Urdu speakers will often insert vowels to break up consonant clusters found in words of Sanskritic origin, but will pronounce them correctly in Arabic and Persian loanwords. As a result of religious nationalism since the partition of British India and continued communal tensions, native speakers of both Hindi and Urdu frequently assert that they are distinct languages.

The grammar of Hindi and Urdu is shared, though formal Urdu makes more use of the Persian &quot;-e-&quot; &quot;izafat&quot; grammatical construct (as in &quot;Hammam-e-Qadimi&quot;, or &quot;Nishan-e-Haider&quot;) than does Hindi.

== Vocabulary ==

Syed Ahmed Dehlavi, a 19th-century lexicographer who compiled the &quot;Farhang-e-Asifiya&quot; Urdu dictionary, estimated that 75% of Urdu words have their etymological roots in Sanskrit and Prakrit, and approximately 99% of Urdu verbs have their roots in Sanskrit and Prakrit. Urdu has borrowed words from Persian and to a lesser extent, Arabic through Persian, to the extent of about 25% to 30% of Urdu&#x27;s vocabulary. A table illustrated by the linguist Afroz Taj of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill likewise illustrates the number of Persian loanwords to native Sanskrit-derived words in literary Urdu as comprising a 1:4 ratio.

The &quot;trend towards Persianisation&quot; started in the 18th century by the Delhi school of Urdu poets, though other writers, such as Meeraji, wrote in a Sanskritised form of the language. There has been a move towards hyper Persianisation in Pakistan since 1947, which has been adopted by much of the country&#x27;s writers; as such, some Urdu texts can be composed of 70% Perso-Arabic loanwords just as some Persian texts can have 70% Arabic vocabulary. Some Pakistani Urdu speakers have incorporated Hindi vocabulary into their speech as a result of exposure to Indian entertainment. In India, Urdu has not diverged from Hindi as much as it has in Pakistan.

Most borrowed words in Urdu are nouns and adjectives. Many of the words of Arabic origin have been adopted through Persian, and have different pronunciations and nuances of meaning and usage than they do in Arabic. There are also a smaller number of borrowings from Portuguese. Some examples for Portuguese words borrowed into Urdu are &quot;chabi&quot; (&quot;chave&quot;: key), &quot;girja&quot; (&quot;igreja&quot;: church), &quot;kamra&quot; (&quot;cámara&quot;: room), &quot;qamīz&quot; (&quot;camisa&quot;: shirt).

Although the word &quot;&quot; is derived from the Turkic word &quot;&quot; (army) or orda, from which English &quot;&quot; is also derived, Turkic borrowings in Urdu are minimal and Urdu is also not genetically related to the Turkic languages. Urdu words originating from Chagatai and Arabic were borrowed through Persian and hence are Persianised versions of the original words. For instance, the Arabic &quot;ta&#x27; marbuta&quot; (  ) changes to &quot;he&quot; (  ) or &quot;te&quot; (  ). Nevertheless, contrary to popular belief, Urdu did not borrow from the Turkish language, but from Chagatai, a Turkic language from Central Asia. Urdu and Turkish both borrowed from Arabic and Persian, hence the similarity in pronunciation of many Urdu and Turkish words.

== Formality ==

Urdu in its less formalised register is known as &quot;rekhta&quot; (, ); the more formal register is sometimes referred to as () or (), referring to the Imperial army or simply &quot;Lashkari&quot;. The etymology of the word used in Urdu, for the most part, decides how polite or refined one&#x27;s speech is. For example, Urdu speakers distinguish between and , both meaning &quot;water&quot;. The former is used colloquially and has older Sanskrit origins; the latter is used formally and poetically, being of Persian origin.

If a word is of Persian or Arabic origin, the level of speech is considered to be more formal and grander. Similarly, if Persian or Arabic grammar constructs, such as the izafat, are used in Urdu, the level of speech is also considered more formal. If a word is inherited from Sanskrit, the level of speech is considered more colloquial and personal.

== Writing system ==

Urdu is written right-to left in an extension of the Persian alphabet, which is itself an extension of the Arabic alphabet. Urdu is associated with the Nastaʿlīq style of Persian calligraphy, whereas Arabic is generally written in the &quot;Naskh&quot; or &quot;Ruq&#x27;ah&quot; styles. Because of its thousands of ligatures, &quot;Nasta’liq&quot; is notoriously difficult to typeset, so Urdu newspapers were hand-written by masters of calligraphy, known as &quot;kātib&quot; or &quot;khush-nawīs&quot;, until the late 1980s. One handwritten Urdu newspaper, &quot;The Musalman&quot;, is still published daily in Chennai. InPage, a widely used desktop publishing tool for Urdu, has over 20,000 ligatures in its Nastaʿliq computer fonts.

A highly Persianised and technical form of Urdu was the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the law courts of the British administration in Bengal and the North-West Provinces &amp; Oudh. Until the late 19th century, all proceedings and court transactions in this register of Urdu were written officially in the Persian script. In 1880, Sir Ashley Eden, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal in colonial India abolished the use of the Persian alphabet in the law courts of Bengal and ordered the exclusive use of Kaithi, a popular script used for both Urdu and Hindi; in the Bihar Province, the court language was Urdu written in the Kaithi script. Kaithi&#x27;s association with Urdu and Hindi was ultimately eliminated by the political contest between these languages and their scripts, in which the Persian script was definitively linked to Urdu.

More recently in India, Urdu speakers have adopted Devanagari for publishing Urdu periodicals and have innovated new strategies to mark Urdu in Devanagari as distinct from Hindi in Devanagari. Such publishers have introduced new orthographic features into Devanagari for the purpose of representing the Perso-Arabic etymology of Urdu words. One example is the use of अ (Devanagari &quot;a&quot;) with vowel signs to mimic contexts of (&quot;‘ain&quot;), in violation of Hindi orthographic rules. For Urdu publishers, the use of Devanagari gives them a greater audience, whereas the orthographic changes help them preserve a distinct identity of Urdu.

Some poets from Bengal, namely Qazi Nazrul Islam, have historically used the Bengali script to write Urdu poetry like &quot;Prem Nagar Ka Thikana Karle&quot; and &quot;Mera Beti Ki Khela&quot;, as well as bilingual Bengali-Urdu poems like &quot;Alga Koro Go Khõpar Bãdhon&quot;, &quot;Juboker Chholona&quot; and &quot;Mera Dil Betab Kiya&quot;. Dhakaiya Urdu is a colloquial non-standard dialect of Urdu which was typically not written. However, organisations seeking to preserve the dialect have begun transcribing the dialect in the Bengali script.

<text>Ultramontanism is a clerical political conception within the Catholic Church that places strong emphasis on the prerogatives and powers of the Pope. It contrasts with Gallicanism, the belief that popular civil authority—often represented by the monarch&#x27;s or state&#x27;s authority—over the Church is comparable to that of the Pope.

==History==
The term descends from the Middle Ages, when a non-Italian pope was said to be &quot;papa ultramontano –&quot; a pope from beyond the mountains (the Alps). Foreign students at medieval Italian universities also were referred to as &quot;ultramontani&quot;.

After the Protestant Reformation in France, the concept was revived but with its directionality reversed to indicate the man &quot;beyond the mountains&quot; in Italy: the Pope. The term &quot;ultramontain&quot; was used to refer to Catholics who supported papal authority in French affairs &quot;–&quot; as opposed to the Gallican and Jansenist factions, who did not &quot;–&quot; and was intended as an insult implying lack of patriotism. From the 17th century, ultramontanism became closely associated with the Jesuits.

In the 18th century the term came to refer to supporters of the Church in any conflict between church and state. In Austria ultramontanists were opposed to Josephinism, and in Germany to Febronianism. In Great Britain and Ireland ultramontanists resisted Cisalpinism, which favored concessions to the Protestant state in order to achieve Catholic emancipation.

In eighteenth-century Spain, the Bourbon monarchs began implementing policies of regalism, which expanded the power of the monarchy and sought to bring the Catholic Church under its jurisdiction in all matters except the spiritual sphere. Charles III of Spain&#x27;s ministers, Count of Floridablanca and the Count of Campomanes rejected the arguments of the ultramontanists that the Church had inalienable rights in the secular sphere. The regalist reforms that the Spanish crown sought to implement were not completely successful, and the resistance to them were attributed to support for the Society of Jesus, which had been expelled from the Spanish Empire in 1767, but prior to that were educators.
In Canada, the majority of Catholic clergy despised the French Revolution and its anti-clerical bias and looked to Rome for both spiritual and political guidance. There were many laymen and laywomen who supported these ideals as key to preserving Canadian institutions and values. For this reason they were called ultramontanists. The ultramontanes distrusted both the Protestant anglophone and francophone politicians, but the Church found it easier to deal with British governors, who appreciated the role of the Church in containing dissent, than with the francophone liberal professionals who were secularists.

==First Vatican Council==
According to Catholic academic Jeffrey P. von Arx,

The response was a condemnation of Gallicanism as heretical:

The council also asserted papal primacy. In July 1870, it issued the Dogmatic constitution , defining four doctrines of the Catholic faith: the apostolic primacy conferred on Peter, the perpetuity of this primacy in the Roman pontiffs, the meaning and power of the papal primacy, and Papal infallibility.

Von Arx compares this to &quot;the great empires and national states of the 19th century, which used new means of communication and transportation to consolidate power, enforce unity and build bureaucracies&quot;. &quot;Cardinal Henry Edward Manning in Great Britain thought unity and discipline within the church were of the utmost importance in protecting the church and advancing its interests in a liberal, democratic state, and so he was one of the strongest advocates of the ultramontane position.&quot; The English bishops at the council were characterized by their ultramontanism and described as &quot;being more Catholic than the Pope himself&quot;.

===Reaction===
Other Christian groups outside the Catholic Church declared this as the triumph of what they termed &quot;the heresy of ultramontanism&quot;. It was specifically decried in the &quot;Declaration of the Catholic Congress at Munich&quot;, in the Theses of Bonn, and in the Declaration of Utrecht, which became the foundational documents of Old Catholics () who split with Rome over the declaration on infallibility and supremacy, joining the Old Episcopal Order Catholic See of Utrecht, which had been independent from Rome since 1723.

As with previous pronouncements by the pope, liberals across Europe were outraged by the doctrine of infallibility and many countries reacted with laws to counter the influence of the church. The term &quot;ultramontanism&quot; was revived during the French Third Republic (1870–1940) as a pejorative way to describe policies that went against , a concept rooted in the French Revolution. The French philosopher Jacques Maritain noted the distinction between the models found in France and the separation of church and state in the United States in the mid-twentieth century. He considered the US model of that time to be more amicable because it had both &quot;sharp distinction and actual cooperation&quot; between church and state, what he called &quot;an historical treasure&quot; and admonished the United States, &quot;Please to God that you keep it carefully, and do not let your concept of separation veer round to the European one.&quot;

After Italian Unification and the abrupt (and unofficial) end of the First Vatican Council in 1870 because of the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, the ultramontanist movement and the opposing conciliarism became obsolete to a large extent. However, some very extreme tendencies of a minority of adherents to ultramontanism – especially those attributing to the Roman pontiff, even in his private opinions, absolute infallibility even in matters beyond faith and morals, and impeccability – survived and were eagerly used by opponents of the Catholic Church and papacy before the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) for use in their propaganda. These extreme tendencies, however, were never supported by the First Vatican Council&#x27;s dogma of 1870 of papal infallibility and primacy, but were rather inspired by erroneous private opinions of some Catholic laymen who tend to identify themselves completely with the Holy See.

At the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church , the Catholic Church&#x27;s teaching on the authority of the pope, bishops and councils was further elaborated. The post-conciliar position of the Apostolic See did not deny any of the previous doctrines of papal infallibility or papal primacy; rather, it shifted emphasis from structural and organizational authority to doctrinal teaching authority (also known as the ). Papal , i.e. papal teaching authority, was defined in No. 25 and later codified in the 1983 revision of Canon Law.

==Controversy==
Some, such as the former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, have claimed the Catholic social teaching of subsidiarity can overrun ultramontanism and has the potential to decentralize the Catholic Church, whereas others defend it as merely a bureaucratic adjustment to give more pastoral responsibility to local bishops and priests of local parishes.

Challenges to ultramontanism have remained strong within and outside Roman jurisdiction. Ultramontanism has particularly overshadowed ecumenical work between the Catholic Church and both Lutherans and Anglicans. The joint Anglican-Roman Catholic International Consultation published &quot;The Gift of Authority&quot; in 1999, highlights agreements and differences on these issues.

==Position of other traditional churches==
Ultramontanism is distinct from the positions adopted by the other traditional churches, particularly the Anglican communion, Eastern Orthodox communion, the Oriental Orthodox communion, the Old Catholic Church, or the Church of the East. These churches regard the pope as having been &quot;primus inter pares&quot; when the churches were united in full communion, and generally still acknowledge that status today, albeit in an impaired form due to disunity; similarly they do not recognize the doctrines of infallibility or the pope&#x27;s alleged universal jurisdiction over patriarchates and autocephalous churches other than that of Rome itself, except insofar as this is part of the concept of &quot;primus inter pares&quot;.

In the joint agreed statement &quot;The Gift of Authority&quot; (1999) the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion were agreed on the collegial nature of the life and work of bishops. Similarly both churches acknowledged the role of episcopal primacy within the college of bishops. On the question of the universal primacy of the Pope, the joint report found common ground, and stated that a &quot;particular conclusion&quot; of their discussions had been &quot;that Anglicans be open to and desire a recovery and re-reception under certain clear conditions of the exercise of universal primacy by the Bishop of Rome&quot;; nonetheless a clear distinction remained between the Anglican view of a universal primacy exercised within a universal collegiality, and the Catholic view of a universal primacy with actual universal jurisdiction.

<text>Ural-Altaic, Uralo-Altaic, Uraltaic, or Turanic is a linguistic convergence zone and abandoned language-family proposal uniting the Uralic and the Altaic (in the narrow sense) languages. It is now generally agreed that even the Altaic languages do not share a common descent: the similarities between Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic are better explained by diffusion and borrowing. Just as in Altaic, the internal structure of the Uralic family has been debated since the family was first proposed. Doubts about the validity of most or all of the proposed higher-order Uralic branchings (grouping the nine undisputed families) are becoming more common. The term continues to be used for the central Eurasian typological, grammatical and lexical convergence zone.

Indeed, &quot;Ural-Altaic&quot; may be preferable to &quot;Altaic&quot; in this sense. For example, J. Janhunen states that &quot;speaking of &#x27;Altaic&#x27; instead of &#x27;Ural-Altaic&#x27; is a misconception, for there are no areal or typological features that are specific to &#x27;Altaic&#x27; without Uralic.&quot; Originally suggested in the 18th century, the genealogical and racial hypotheses remained debated into the mid-20th century, often with disagreements exacerbated by pan-nationalist agendas.

The Ural-Altaic hypothesis had many proponents in Britain. Since the 1960s, the proposed language family has been widely rejected. A relationship between the Altaic, Indo-European and Uralic families was revived in the context of the Nostratic hypothesis, which was popular for a time, with for example Allan Bomhard treating Uralic, Altaic and Indo-European as coordinate branches. However, Nostratic too is now rejected.

==History as a hypothesized language family==
The concept of a Ural-Altaic ethnic and language family goes back to the linguistic theories of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz; in his opinion there was no better method for specifying the relationship and origin of the various peoples of the Earth, than the comparison of their languages. In his &quot;Brevis designatio meditationum de originibus gentium ductis potissimum ex indicio linguarum&quot;, written in 1710, he originates every human language from one common ancestor language. Over time, this ancestor language split into two families; the Japhetic and the Aramaic. The Japhetic family split even further, into Scythian and Celtic branches. The members of the Scythian family were: the Greek language, the family of Sarmato-Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, Czech, Dalmatian, Bulgar, Slovene, Avar and Khazar), the family of Turkic languages (Turkish, Cuman, Kalmyk and Mongolian), the family of Finno-Ugric languages (Finnish, Saami, Hungarian, Estonian, Liv and Samoyed). Although his theory and grouping were far from perfect, they had a considerable effect on the development of linguistic research, especially in German-speaking countries.

In his book &quot;An historico-geographical description of the north and east parts of Europe and Asia&quot;, published in 1730, Philip Johan von Strahlenberg, Swedish prisoner-of-war and explorer of Siberia, who accompanied Daniel Gottlieb Messerschmidt on his expeditions, described Finno-Ugric, Turkic, Samoyedic, Mongolic, Tungusic and Caucasian peoples as sharing linguistic and cultural commonalities. 20th century scholarship has on several occasions incorrectly credited him with proposing a Ural-Altaic language family, though he does not claim linguistic affinity &quot;between&quot; any of the six groups.

Danish philologist Rasmus Christian Rask described what he called &quot;Scythian&quot; languages in 1834, which included Finno-Ugric, Turkic, Samoyedic, Eskimo, Caucasian, Basque and others.

The Ural-Altaic hypothesis was elaborated at least as early as 1836 by W. Schott and in 1838 by F. J. Wiedemann.

The &quot;Altaic&quot; hypothesis, as mentioned by Finnish linguist and explorer Matthias Castrén by 1844, included the Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic, grouped as &quot;Chudic&quot;, and Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic, grouped as &quot;Tataric&quot;. Subsequently, in the latter half of the 19th century, Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic came to be referred to as Altaic languages, whereas Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic were called Uralic. The similarities between these two families led to their retention in a common grouping, named Ural–Altaic.

Friedrich Max Müller, the German Orientalist and philologist, published and proposed a new grouping of the non-Aryan and non-Semitic Asian languages in 1855. In his work &quot;The Languages of the Seat of War in the East&quot;, he called these languages &quot;Turanian&quot;. Müller divided this group into two subgroups, the Southern Division, and the Northern Division. In the long run, his evolutionist theory about languages&#x27; structural development, tying growing grammatical refinement to socio-economic development, and grouping languages into &#x27;antediluvian&#x27;, &#x27;familial&#x27;, &#x27;nomadic&#x27;, and &#x27;political&#x27; developmental stages, proved unsound, but his Northern Division was renamed and re-classed as the &quot;Ural-Altaic languages&quot;.

Between the 1850s and 1870s, there were efforts by Frederick Roehrig to including some Native American languages in a &quot;Turanian&quot; or &quot;Ural-Altaic&quot; family, and between the 1870s and 1890s, there was speculation about links with Basque.

In Hungary, where the national language is Uralic but with heavy historical Turkic influence—a fact which by itself spurred the popularity of the &quot;Ural-Altaic&quot; hypothesis—the idea of the Ural–Altaic relationship remained widely implicitly accepted in the late 19th and the mid-20th century, though more out of pan-nationalist than linguistic reasons, and without much detailed research carried out. Elsewhere the notion had sooner fallen into discredit, with Ural–Altaic supporters elsewhere such as the Finnish Altaicist Martti Räsänen being in the minority. The contradiction between Hungarian linguists&#x27; convictions and the lack of clear evidence eventually provided motivation for scholars such as Aurélien Sauvageot and Denis Sinor to carry out more detailed investigation of the hypothesis, which so far has failed to yield generally accepted results. Nicholas Poppe in his article &quot;The Uralo-Altaic Theory in the Light of the Soviet Linguistics&quot; (1940) also attempted to refute Castrén&#x27;s views by showing that the common agglutinating features may have arisen independently.

Beginning in the 1960s, the hypothesis came to be seen even more controversial, due to the Altaic family itself also falling out universal acceptance. Today, the hypothesis that Uralic and Altaic are related more closely to one another than to any other family has almost no adherents. In his &quot;Altaic Etymological Dictionary&quot;, co-authored with Anna V. Dybo and Oleg A. Mudrak, Sergei Starostin characterized the Ural–Altaic hypothesis as &quot;an idea now completely discarded&quot;. There are, however, a number of hypotheses that propose a larger macrofamily including Uralic, Altaic and other families. None of these hypotheses has widespread support. In Starostin&#x27;s sketch of a &quot;Borean&quot; super-phylum, he puts Uralic and Altaic as daughters of an ancestral language of c. 9,000 years ago from which the Dravidian languages and the Paleo-Siberian languages, including Eskimo–Aleut, are also descended. He posits that this ancestral language, together with Indo-European and Kartvelian, descends from a &quot;Eurasiatic&quot; protolanguage some 12,000 years ago, which in turn would be descended from a &quot;Borean&quot; protolanguage via Nostratic.

In the 1980s, Russian linguist (Nikolai Dmitrievich Andreev) proposed a &quot;&quot; hypothesis linking the Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic (including Korean in his later papers) language families. Andreev also proposed 203 lexical roots for his hypothesized Boreal macrofamily. After Andreev&#x27;s death in 1997, the Boreal hypothesis was further expanded by Sorin Paliga (2003, 2007).

Angela Marcantonio (2002) argues that there is no sufficient evidence for a Finno-Ugric or Uralic group connecting the Finno-Permic and Ugric languages, and suggests that they are no more closely related to each other than either is to Turkic, thereby positing a grouping very similar to Ural–Altaic or indeed to Castrén&#x27;s original Altaic proposal. This thesis has been criticized by mainstream Uralic scholars.

==Typology==
There is general agreement on several typological similarities being widely found among the languages considered under Ural–Altaic:
* head-final and subject–object–verb word order
* in most of the languages, vowel harmony
* morphology that is predominantly agglutinative and suffixing
* zero copula
* non-finite clauses
* lack of grammatical gender
* lack of consonant clusters in word-initial position
* having a separate verb for existential clause which is different from ordinary possession verbs like &quot;to have&quot;
Such similarities do not constitute sufficient evidence of genetic relationship all on their own, as other explanations are possible. Juha Janhunen has argued that although Ural–Altaic is to be rejected as a genealogical relationship, it remains a viable concept as a well-defined language area, which in his view has formed through the historical interaction and convergence of four core language families (Uralic, Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic), and their influence on the more marginal Korean and Japonic.

Contrasting views on the typological situation have been presented by other researchers. Michael Fortescue has connected Uralic instead as a part of an Uralo-Siberian typological area (comprising Uralic, Yukaghir, Chukotko-Kamchatkan and Eskimo–Aleut), contrasting with a more narrowly defined Altaic typological area; while Anderson has outlined a specifically Siberian language area, including within Uralic only the Ob-Ugric and Samoyedic groups; within Altaic most of the Tungusic family as well as Siberian Turkic and Buryat (Mongolic); as well as Yukaghir, Chukotko-Kamchatkan, Eskimo–Aleut, Nivkh, and Yeniseian.

==Relationship between Uralic and Altaic==

The Altaic language family was generally accepted by linguists from the late 19th century up to the 1960s, but since then has been in dispute. For simplicity&#x27;s sake, the following discussion assumes the validity of the Altaic language family.

Two senses should be distinguished in which Uralic and Altaic might be related.

#Do Uralic and Altaic have a demonstrable genetic relationship?
#If they do have a demonstrable genetic relationship, do they form a valid linguistic taxon? For example, Germanic and Iranian have a genetic relationship via Proto-Indo-European, but they do not form a valid taxon within the Indo-European language family, whereas in contrast Iranian and Indo-Aryan do via Indo-Iranian, a daughter language of Proto-Indo-European that subsequently calved into Indo-Aryan and Iranian. 
In other words, showing a genetic relationship does not suffice to establish a language family, such as the proposed Ural–Altaic family; it is also necessary to consider whether other languages from outside the proposed family might not be at least as closely related to the languages in that family as the latter are to each other. This distinction is often overlooked but is fundamental to the genetic classification of languages. Some linguists indeed maintain that Uralic and Altaic are related through a larger family, such as Eurasiatic or Nostratic, within which Uralic and Altaic are no more closely related to each other than either is to any other member of the proposed family, for instance than Uralic or Altaic is to Indo-European (for example Greenberg).

===Shared vocabulary===
To demonstrate the existence of a language family, it is necessary to find cognate words that trace back to a common proto-language. Shared vocabulary alone does not show a relationship, as it may be loaned from one language to another or through the language of a third party.

There are shared words between, for example, Turkic and Ugric languages, or Tungusic and Samoyedic languages, which are explainable by borrowing. However, it has been difficult to find Ural–Altaic words shared across all involved language families. Such words should be found in all branches of the Uralic and Altaic trees and should follow regular sound changes from the proto-language to known modern languages, and regular sound changes from Proto-Ural–Altaic to give Proto-Uralic and Proto-Altaic words should be found to demonstrate the existence of a Ural–Altaic vocabulary. Instead, candidates for Ural–Altaic cognate sets can typically be supported by only one of the Altaic subfamilies. In contrast, about 200 Proto-Uralic word roots are known and universally accepted, and for the proto-languages of the Altaic subfamilies and the larger main groups of Uralic, on the order of 1000–2000 words can be recovered.

Some linguists point out strong similarities in the personal pronouns of Uralic and Altaic languages, although the similarities also exist with the Indo-European pronouns as well.

The basic numerals, unlike those among the Indo-European languages (compare Proto-Indo-European numerals), are particularly divergent between all three core Altaic families and Uralic, and to a lesser extent even within Uralic.

One alleged Ural-Altaic similarity among this data are the Hungarian (&quot;három&quot;) and Mongolian (&quot;ɣurban&quot;) numerals for &#x27;3&#x27;. According to Róna-Tas (1983), elevating this similarity to a hypothesis of common origin would still require several ancillary hypotheses:
* that this Finno-Ugric lexeme, and not the incompatible Samoyedic lexeme, is the original Uralic numeral;
* that this Mongolic lexeme, and not the incompatible Turkic and Tungusic lexemes, is the original Altaic numeral; 
* that the Hungarian form with &quot;-r-&quot;, and not the &quot;-l-&quot; seen in cognates such as in Finnish &quot;kolme&quot;, is more original;
* that &quot;-m&quot; in the Hungarian form is originally a suffix, since &quot;-bVn&quot;, found also in other Mongolian numerals, is also a suffix and not an original part of the word root;
* that the voiced spirant &quot;ɣ-&quot; in Mongolian can correspond to the voiceless stop &quot;*k-&quot; in Finno-Ugric (known to be the source of Hungarian &quot;h-&quot;).

===Sound correspondences===
The following consonant correspondences between Uralic and Altaic are asserted by Poppe (1983):
* Word-initial bilabial stop: Uralic *p- = Altaic *p- (&gt; Turkic and Mongolic *h-)
* Sibilants: Uralic *s, *š, *ś = Altaic *s
* Nasals: Uralic *n, *ń, *ŋ = Altaic *n, *ń, *ŋ (in Turkic word-initial *n-, *ń- &gt; *j-; in Mongolic *ń(V) &gt; *n(i))
* Liquids: Uralic *-l-, *-r- = Altaic *-l-, *r-

== As a convergence zone ==
Regardless of a possible common origin or lack thereof, Uralic-Altaic languages can be spoken of as a convergence zone. Although it has not yet been possible to demonstrate a genetic relationship or a significant amount of common vocabulary between the languages other than loanwords, according to the linguist Juha Jahunen, the languages must have had a common linguistic homeland. The Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic languages have been spoken in the Manchurian region, and there is little chance that a similar structural typology of Uralic languages could have emerged without close contact between them. The languages of Turkish and Finnish have many similar structures, such as vowel harmony and agglutination, and it has been suggested by Edward Vajda that Early Turkic may have loaned palatal harmony from Uralic.

Similarly, according to Janhunen, the common typology of the Altaic languages can be inferred as a result of mutual contacts in the past, perhaps from a few thousand years ago.
