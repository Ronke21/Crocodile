<text>Screaming Lord Sutch (born David Edward Sutch, 10 November 1940 – 16 June 1999) was an English musician and perennial parliamentary candidate.

He was the founder of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party and served as its leader from 1983 to 1999, during which time he stood in numerous parliamentary elections. He holds the record for contesting the most Parliamentary elections: 39 between 1963 and 1997.

As a singer, he variously worked with Keith Moon, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore, Charlie Watts, John Bonham, Noel Redding, Mitch Mitchell and Nicky Hopkins, and is known for his recordings with Joe Meek including &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; (1963).

== Early life ==
David Edward Sutch was born at New End Hospital in Hampstead, North London, and grew up in Harrow. His father, a policeman, was killed in a car crash in September 1941, when Sutch was ten months old. His mother was a fan of Charles Dickens&#x27; works, and christened Sutch &quot;David&quot; after David Copperfield. He and his mother lived in a flat in Kilburn for fifteen years, and in 1956, Sutch left home and worked as a window cleaner.

== Musical career ==
In the 1960s, inspired by Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins, he changed his stage name to &quot;Screaming Lord Sutch, 3rd Earl of Harrow&quot;, despite having no connection with the peerage. It later became customary for the UK press to refer to him as &quot;Screaming Lord Sutch&quot;, or simply &quot;Lord Sutch&quot;.

During the 1960s Screaming Lord Sutch was known for his horror-themed stage show, dressing as Jack the Ripper, pre-dating the shock rock antics of Arthur Brown and Alice Cooper. Accompanied by his band, the Savages, he started by coming out of a black coffin (once being trapped inside of it, an incident parodied in the film &quot;Slade in Flame&quot;). Other props included knives and daggers, skulls and &quot;bodies&quot;. Sutch booked themed tours, such as &#x27;Sutch and the Roman Empire&#x27;, where Sutch and the band members would be dressed up as Roman soldiers. Fellow musician Chas McDevitt has claimed that he gave the idea for a Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins-inspired act to Sutch&#x27;s manager Paul Lincoln after seeing Hawkins perform in New York in 1957, having already considered emulating Hawkins himself by starting his act by emerging from a silk-lined coffin but deciding that he &quot;(didn&#x27;t have) the personality to carry this off&quot;, stating that &quot;no one in this country had heard of Hawkins until the mid-60s&quot;.

Despite a self-confessed lack of vocal talent, Sutch released horror-themed singles during the early to mid-1960s, the most popular being &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;. His single &quot;The Cheat&quot; has been cited as a proto-psychedelic recording. Early works included recordings produced by audio pioneer Joe Meek.
In 1963 Sutch and his manager, Reginald Calvert, took over Shivering Sands Army Fort, a Maunsell Fort off Southend, and in 1964 started Radio Sutch, intending to compete with other pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline. Broadcasts consisted of music and Mandy Rice-Davies reading &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;. Sutch tired of the station, and sold it to Calvert, after which it was renamed Radio City and lasted until the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act came into force in 1967. In 1966 Calvert was shot dead by Oliver Smedley over a financial dispute. Smedley was acquitted on grounds of self-defence.

About this time Ritchie Blackmore left the band. Roger Warwick left to set up an R&amp;B big band for Freddie Mack.

Sutch&#x27;s album &quot;Lord Sutch and Heavy Friends&quot; was named in a 1998 BBC poll as the worst album of all time, a status it also held in Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;The Top 1000 Albums of All Time&quot;, despite the fact that Jimmy Page, John Bonham, Jeff Beck, Noel Redding and Nicky Hopkins performed on it and helped write it. 

For his follow-up, &quot;Hands of Jack the Ripper&quot;, Sutch assembled British rock celebrities for a concert at the Carshalton Park Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Festival. The show was recorded (though only Sutch knew), and it was released to the surprise of the musicians. Musicians on the record included Ritchie Blackmore (guitar); Matthew Fisher (keyboard); Carlo Little (drums); Keith Moon (drums); Noel Redding (bass) and Nick Simper (bass).

In 2017 his song &quot;Flashing Lights&quot; was featured in &quot;Logan Lucky&quot;, directed by Steven Soderbergh.

== Political activities ==
In the 1960s Sutch stood in parliamentary elections, often as representative of the National Teenage Party. His first was in 1963, when he contested the Stratford by-election caused by the resignation of John Profumo. He gained 208 votes. His next was at the 1966 general election when he stood in Harold Wilson&#x27;s Huyton constituency. Here he received 585 votes.

He founded the Official Monster Raving Loony Party on 16 June 1982 at the Golden Lion Hotel in Ashburton, Devon, and fought the 1983 Bermondsey by-election. In his career he contested over 40 elections. He was recognisable at election counts by his flamboyant clothes and top hat. In 1968 he officially added &quot;lord&quot; to his name by deed poll. In the mid 1980s, the deposit paid by candidates was raised from £150 to £500. This did little to deter Sutch, who increased the number of concerts he performed to pay for campaigns. He achieved his highest poll and vote share at Rotherham in 1994 with 1,114 votes and a 4.2 per cent vote share.

At the Bootle by-election in May 1990, he secured more votes than the candidate of the Continuing Social Democratic Party (SDP), led by former Foreign Secretary David Owen. Within days the SDP dissolved itself. In 1993, when the British National Party gained its first local councillor, Derek Beackon, Sutch pointed out that the Official Monster Raving Loony Party already had six. He contested 39 parliamentary elections – a record number – losing his deposit in all of them.

He appeared as himself in the first episode of ITV comedy &quot;The New Statesman&quot;, coming second ahead of Labour and the SDP, in the 1987 election which saw Alan B&#x27;Stard elected to Parliament.

Adverts in the 1990s for Heineken Pilsener boasted that &quot;Only Heineken can do this&quot;. One had Sutch at 10 Downing Street after becoming Prime Minister.

Sutch pulled out of the 1997 general election to take care of his sick mother in South Harrow. Later that year he contested his last two by-elections, in Uxbridge and Winchester.

In 1999 Sutch starred in a Coco Pops advert as a returning officer announcing the results of its renaming competition.

A number of Sutch&#x27;s Loony Party policies were later adopted by mainstream parties and became law. Specifically:
== Personal life ==
Sutch was friends with Cynthia Payne, and at one time lived at her house. 

Sutch had a history of depression, and killed himself by hanging on 16 June 1999 at his late mother&#x27;s house. At the inquest, his fiancée Yvonne Elwood said he had manic depression, now known as bipolar disorder. He is buried beside his mother, who died one day before the 1997 General Election. His mother&#x27;s death was one of the main factors in his deep depression. He is survived by a son, Tristan Lord Gwynne Sutch, born in 1975 to American model Thann Rendessy.

In 1991 his autobiography, &quot;Life as Sutch: The Official Autobiography of a Raving Loony&quot; (written with Peter Chippindale), was published. In 2005 Graham Sharpe, who had known him since the late 1960s, wrote the first biography, &quot;The Man Who Was Screaming Lord Sutch&quot;.

<text>Protein secondary structure is the local spatial conformation of the polypeptide backbone excluding the side chains. The two most common secondary structural elements are alpha helices and beta sheets, though beta turns and omega loops occur as well. Secondary structure elements typically spontaneously form as an intermediate before the protein folds into its three dimensional tertiary structure.

Secondary structure is formally defined by the pattern of hydrogen bonds between the amino hydrogen and carboxyl oxygen atoms in the peptide backbone. Secondary structure may alternatively be defined based on the regular pattern of backbone dihedral angles in a particular region of the Ramachandran plot regardless of whether it has the correct hydrogen bonds.

The concept of secondary structure was first introduced by Kaj Ulrik Linderstrøm-Lang at Stanford in 1952. Other types of biopolymers such as nucleic acids also possess characteristic secondary structures.

== Types ==
The most common secondary structures are alpha helices and beta sheets. Other helices, such as the 310 helix and π helix, are calculated to have energetically favorable hydrogen-bonding patterns but are rarely observed in natural proteins except at the ends of α helices due to unfavorable backbone packing in the center of the helix. Other extended structures such as the polyproline helix and alpha sheet are rare in native state proteins but are often hypothesized as important protein folding intermediates. Tight turns and loose, flexible loops link the more &quot;regular&quot; secondary structure elements. The random coil is not a true secondary structure, but is the class of conformations that indicate an absence of regular secondary structure.

Amino acids vary in their ability to form the various secondary structure elements. Proline and glycine are sometimes known as &quot;helix breakers&quot; because they disrupt the regularity of the α helical backbone conformation; however, both have unusual conformational abilities and are commonly found in turns. Amino acids that prefer to adopt helical conformations in proteins include methionine, alanine, leucine, glutamate and lysine (&quot;MALEK&quot; in amino-acid 1-letter codes); by contrast, the large aromatic residues (tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine) and Cβ-branched amino acids (isoleucine, valine, and threonine) prefer to adopt β-strand conformations. However, these preferences are not strong enough to produce a reliable method of predicting secondary structure from sequence alone.

Low frequency collective vibrations are thought to be sensitive to local rigidity within proteins, revealing beta structures to be generically more rigid than alpha or disordered proteins. Neutron scattering measurements have directly connected the spectral feature at ~1 THz to collective motions of the secondary structure of beta-barrel protein GFP.

Hydrogen bonding patterns in secondary structures may be significantly distorted, which makes automatic determination of secondary structure difficult. There are several methods for formally defining protein secondary structure (e.g., DSSP, DEFINE, STRIDE, ScrewFit, SST).

=== DSSP classification ===


The Dictionary of Protein Secondary Structure, in short DSSP, is commonly used to describe the protein secondary structure with single letter codes. The secondary structure is assigned based on hydrogen bonding patterns as those initially proposed by Pauling et al. in 1951 (before any protein structure had ever been experimentally determined). There are eight types of secondary structure that DSSP defines:

* G = 3-turn helix (310 helix). Min length 3 residues.
* H = 4-turn helix (α helix). Minimum length 4 residues.
* I = 5-turn helix (π helix). Minimum length 5 residues.
* T = hydrogen bonded turn (3, 4 or 5 turn)
* E = extended strand in parallel and/or anti-parallel β-sheet conformation. Min length 2 residues.
* B = residue in isolated β-bridge (single pair β-sheet hydrogen bond formation)
* S = bend (the only non-hydrogen-bond based assignment).
* C = coil (residues which are not in any of the above conformations).

&#x27;Coil&#x27; is often codified as &#x27; &#x27; (space), C (coil) or &#x27;–&#x27; (dash). The helices (G, H and I) and sheet conformations are all required to have a reasonable length. This means that 2 adjacent residues in the primary structure must form the same hydrogen bonding pattern. If the helix or sheet hydrogen bonding pattern is too short they are designated as T or B, respectively. Other protein secondary structure assignment categories exist (sharp turns, Omega loops, etc.), but they are less frequently used.

Secondary structure is defined by hydrogen bonding, so the exact definition of a hydrogen bond is critical. The standard hydrogen-bond definition for secondary structure is that of DSSP, which is a purely electrostatic model. It assigns charges of ±&quot;q&quot;1 ≈ 0.42&quot;e&quot; to the carbonyl carbon and oxygen, respectively, and charges of ±&quot;q&quot;2 ≈ 0.20&quot;e&quot; to the amide hydrogen and nitrogen, respectively. The electrostatic energy is

:formula_1

According to DSSP, a hydrogen-bond exists if and only if &quot;E&quot; is less than . Although the DSSP formula is a relatively crude approximation of the &quot;physical&quot; hydrogen-bond energy, it is generally accepted as a tool for defining secondary structure.

=== SST classification ===
SST is a Bayesian method to assign secondary structure to protein coordinate data using the Shannon information criterion of Minimum Message Length (MML) inference. SST treats any assignment of secondary structure as a potential hypothesis that attempts to explain (compress) given protein coordinate data. The core idea is that the best secondary structural assignment is the one that can explain (compress) the coordinates of a given protein coordinates in the most economical way, thus linking the inference of secondary structure to lossless data compression. SST accurately delineates any protein chain into regions associated with the following assignment types:

* E = (Extended) strand of a β-pleated sheet
* G = Right-handed 310 helix 
* H = Right-handed α-helix
* I = Right-handed π-helix
* g = Left-handed 310 helix 
* h = Left-handed α-helix
* i = Left-handed π-helix
* 3 = 310-like Turn 
* 4 = α-like Turn 
* 5 = π-like Turn 
* T = Unspecified Turn
* C = Coil
* - = Unassigned residue

SST detects π and 310 helical caps to standard α-helices, and automatically assembles the various extended strands into consistent β-pleated sheets. It provides a readable output of dissected secondary structural elements, and a corresponding PyMol-loadable script to visualize the assigned secondary structural elements individually.

== Experimental determination ==
The rough secondary-structure content of a biopolymer (e.g., &quot;this protein is 40% α-helix and 20% β-sheet.&quot;) can be estimated spectroscopically. For proteins, a common method is far-ultraviolet (far-UV, 170–250 nm) circular dichroism. A pronounced double minimum at 208 and 222 nm indicate α-helical structure, whereas a single minimum at 204 nm or 217 nm reflects random-coil or β-sheet structure, respectively. A less common method is infrared spectroscopy, which detects differences in the bond oscillations of amide groups due to hydrogen-bonding. Finally, secondary-structure contents may be estimated accurately using the chemical shifts of an initially unassigned NMR spectrum.

== Prediction ==
Predicting protein tertiary structure from only its amino sequence is a very challenging problem (see protein structure prediction), but using the simpler secondary structure definitions is more tractable.

Early methods of secondary-structure prediction were restricted to predicting the three predominate states: helix, sheet, or random coil. These methods were based on the helix- or sheet-forming propensities of individual amino acids, sometimes coupled with rules for estimating the free energy of forming secondary structure elements. The first widely used techniques to predict protein secondary structure from the amino acid sequence were the Chou–Fasman method and the GOR method. Although such methods claimed to achieve ~60% accurate in predicting which of the three states (helix/sheet/coil) a residue adopts, blind computing assessments later showed that the actual accuracy was much lower.

A significant increase in accuracy (to nearly ~80%) was made by exploiting multiple sequence alignment; knowing the full distribution of amino acids that occur at a position (and in its vicinity, typically ~7 residues on either side) throughout evolution provides a much better picture of the structural tendencies near that position. For illustration, a given protein might have a glycine at a given position, which by itself might suggest a random coil there. However, multiple sequence alignment might reveal that helix-favoring amino acids occur at that position (and nearby positions) in 95% of homologous proteins spanning nearly a billion years of evolution. Moreover, by examining the average hydrophobicity at that and nearby positions, the same alignment might also suggest a pattern of residue solvent accessibility consistent with an α-helix. Taken together, these factors would suggest that the glycine of the original protein adopts α-helical structure, rather than random coil. Several types of methods are used to combine all the available data to form a 3-state prediction, including neural networks, hidden Markov models and support vector machines. Modern prediction methods also provide a confidence score for their predictions at every position.

Secondary-structure prediction methods were evaluated by the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments and continuously benchmarked, e.g. by EVA (benchmark). Based on these tests, the most accurate methods were Psipred, SAM, PORTER, PROF, and SABLE. The chief area for improvement appears to be the prediction of β-strands; residues confidently predicted as β-strand are likely to be so, but the methods are apt to overlook some β-strand segments (false negatives). There is likely an upper limit of ~90% prediction accuracy overall, due to the idiosyncrasies of the standard method (DSSP) for assigning secondary-structure classes (helix/strand/coil) to PDB structures, against which the predictions are benchmarked.

Accurate secondary-structure prediction is a key element in the prediction of tertiary structure, in all but the simplest (homology modeling) cases. For example, a confidently predicted pattern of six secondary structure elements βαββαβ is the signature of a ferredoxin fold.

== Applications ==

Both protein and nucleic acid secondary structures can be used to aid in multiple sequence alignment. These alignments can be made more accurate by the inclusion of secondary structure information in addition to simple sequence information. This is sometimes less useful in RNA because base pairing is much more highly conserved than sequence. Distant relationships between proteins whose primary structures are unalignable can sometimes be found by secondary structure.

It has been shown that α-helices are more stable, robust to mutations, and designable than β-strands in natural proteins, thus designing functional all-α proteins is likely to be easier that designing proteins with both helices and strands; this has been recently confirmed experimentally.

<text>Sabermetrics (originally SABRmetrics) is the original or blanket term for sports analytics in the US, the empirical analysis of baseball, especially the development of advanced metrics based on baseball statistics that measure in-game activity. The term is derived from the movement&#x27;s progenitors, members of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), founded in 1971, and was coined by Bill James, 
(in 1980, according to SABR.org), who is one of its pioneers and considered its most prominent advocate and public face.

The term moneyball is used for the practice of using metrics to identify &quot;undervalued players&quot; and sign them to what ideally will become &quot;below market value&quot; contracts, which debuted in the efforts of small-market teams to compete with the much greater resources of big-market organizations.

== Early history ==
English-American sportswriter Henry Chadwick developed the box score in New York City in 1858. This was the first way statisticians were able to describe the sport of baseball by numerically tracking various aspects of game play. The creation of the box score has given baseball statisticians a summary of the individual and team performances for a given game.

What would become the earliest Sabermetrics research in the 1970s and 1980s began in the middle of the 20th century with the writings of Earnshaw Cook, one of the earliest baseball analysts. Cook&#x27;s 1964 book &quot;Percentage Baseball&quot; was one of the first of its kind. At first, most organized baseball teams and professionals dismissed Cook&#x27;s work as meaningless. The idea of a science of baseball statistics began to achieve legitimacy in 1977 when Bill James began releasing &quot;Baseball Abstracts&quot;, his annual compendium of baseball data. However, James&#x27;s ideas were slow to find widespread acceptance.

Bill James believed there was a widespread misunderstanding about how the game of baseball was played, claiming the sport was not defined by its rules but actually, as summarized by engineering professor Richard J. Puerzer, &quot;defined by the conditions under which the game is played – specifically, the ballparks but also the players, the ethics, the strategies, the equipment, and the expectations of the public.&quot; Early Sabermetricians – sometimes considered baseball statisticians – began trying to enhance such fundamental baseball statistics as batting average (simply hits divided by at-bats) with advanced mathematical formulations. The correlation between team batting average and runs scored was also examined, as runs – not hits – win ballgames. Thus, a good measure of a player&#x27;s worth would be his ability to help his team score runs, which was observed to be highly correlated with his number of times on base – leading to the development of a new stat, &quot;on-base percentage&quot;.

Before Bill James popularized sabermetrics, Davey Johnson, then a second baseman playing for the early 1970s Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball (MLB), used an IBM System/360 at team owner Jerold Hoffberger&#x27;s brewery to write a FORTRAN-based baseball computer simulation. In spite of his results, he was unable to persuade his manager Earl Weaver that he should bat second in the lineup. He wrote IBM BASIC programs to help him manage the Tidewater Tides, and after becoming manager of the New York Mets in 1984, he arranged for a team employee to write a dBASE II application to compile and store advanced metrics on team statistics. Craig R. Wright was another employee in MLB, working with the Texas Rangers in the early 1980s. During his time with the Rangers, he became known as the first front office employee in MLB history to work under the title &quot;sabermetrician&quot;.

David Smith founded Retrosheet in 1989, with the objective of computerizing the box score of every major league baseball game ever played, in order to more accurately collect and compare the statistics of the game.
The Oakland Athletics began to use a more quantitative approach to baseball by focusing on sabermetric principles in the 1990s. This initially began with Sandy Alderson as the general manager of the team when he used the principles toward obtaining relatively undervalued players. His ideas were continued when Billy Beane took over as general manager in 1997, a job he held until 2015, and hired his assistant Paul DePodesta. During the 2002 season, a noted &quot;moneyball&quot; Oakland A&#x27;s team went on to win 20 games in a row, a term (and approach to the game) which soon gained national recognition when Michael Lewis published &quot;&quot; (where &quot;unfair&quot; reflected the disparity in resources available to the big market teams versus the small) in 2003 to detail Beane&#x27;s use of advanced metrics. In 2011, a film based on Lewis&#x27; book – also called &quot;Moneyball –&quot; was released and gave broad exposure to the techniques used in the Oakland Athletics&#x27; front office.

== Traditional measurements ==
Sabermetrics reflected a desire by a handful of baseball enthusiasts to expand their understanding of the game by revealing new insights that may have been hidden in its traditional statistics. Their early efforts ultimately evolved into evaluating players in every aspect of the game, including batting, pitching, baserunning, and fielding. 

=== Batting measurements ===
A ballplayer&#x27;s batting average (BA) (simply hits divided by at-bats) was the historic measure of a player&#x27;s offensive performance, enhanced by slugging percentage (SA) which incorporated their ability to hit for power. 

Bill James, along with other early sabermetricians, was concerned that batting average did not incorporate other ways a batter can reach base besides a hit – as a batter on base can score runs, and runs, not hits, win ballgames. 

Even though slugging percentage and an early form of on-base percentage (OBP) – which takes into accounts base on balls (&quot;walks&quot;) and hit-by-pitches – date to at least 1941, pre-dating both Bill James (born 1949) and SABR (formed 1971), enhanced focus was put on the relationship of times on base and run scoring by early SABR-era baseball statistical pioneers. 

SA and OBP were combined to create the modern statistic on-base plus slugging (OPS). OPS is the sum of the on-base percentage and the slugging percentage. This modern statistic has become useful in comparing players and is a powerful method of predicting runs scored by any given player. An enhanced version of OPS, &quot;OPS+&quot;, incorporates OPS, historic statistics, ballpark considerations, and defensive position weightings to attempt to allow player performance from different eras to be compared.

Some other advanced metrics used to evaluate batting performance are weighted on-base average, secondary average, runs created, and equivalent average.

=== Pitching measurements ===

The traditional measure of pitching performance is the earned run average (ERA). It is calculated as earned runs allowed per nine innings. Earned run average does not separate the ability of the pitcher from the abilities of the fielders that he plays with. Another classic measure for pitching is a pitcher&#x27;s winning percentage. Winning percentage is calculated by dividing wins by the total number of decisions (wins plus losses). Winning percentage is also heavily dependent on the pitcher&#x27;s team, particularly on the number of runs it scores.

Sabermetricians have attempted to find different measures of pitching performance that exclude the performances of the fielders involved. One of the earliest developed, and one of the most popular in use, is walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP), which while not completely defense-independent, tends to indicate how many times a pitcher is likely to put a player on base (either via walk, hit-by-pitch, or base hit) and thus how effective batters are against a particular pitcher in reaching base.

A later development was the creation of defense independent pitching statistics (DIPS) system. Voros McCracken has been credited with the development of this system in 1999. Through his research, McCracken was able to show that there is little to no difference between pitchers in the number of hits they allow on balls put into play – regardless of their skill level. Some examples of these statistics are defense-independent ERA, fielding independent pitching, and defense-independent component ERA. Other sabermetricians have furthered the work in DIPS, such as Tom Tango who runs the &quot;Tango on Baseball&quot; sabermetrics website.

&quot;Baseball Prospectus&quot; created another statistics called the peripheral ERA. This measure of a pitcher&#x27;s performance takes hits, walks, home runs allowed, and strikeouts while adjusting for ballpark factors. Each ballpark has different dimensions when it comes to the outfield wall so a pitcher should not be measured the same for each of these parks.

Batting average on balls in play (BABIP) is another useful measurement for determining pitchers&#x27; performance. When a pitcher has a high BABIP, they will often show improvements in the following season, while a pitcher with low BABIP will often show a decline in the following season. This is based on the statistical concept of regression to the mean. Others have created various means of attempting to quantify individual pitches based on characteristics of the pitch, as opposed to runs earned or balls hit.

== Advanced methods ==
Value over replacement player (VORP) This statistic attempts to demonstrate how much a player contributes to his team in comparison to a hypothetical player performing at the minimum level needed to hold a roster position on a major league team. It was invented by Keith Woolner, a former writer for the sabermetric group/website &quot;Baseball Prospectus&quot;.

Wins above replacement (WAR) is another popular sabermetric statistic for evaluating a player&#x27;s contributions to his team. Similar to VORP, WAR compares a given player to a replacement-level player in order to determine the number of additional wins the player provides to his team relative to an average ballplayer at his position. WAR, like VORP a &quot;cumulative&quot; statistic, heavily reflects the amount of a player&#x27;s playing time.

&quot;Static&quot; statistics based on simple ratios of already accumulated data (like batting average) and accumulative tallies (such as pitching wins) do not fully reveal all aspects of the game represented in their numeric totals. Advanced metrics are increasingly developed and targeted to addressing &quot;in-game&quot; activities (such as when a team should attempt to steal a base, and when to bring closers in).

== Applications ==
Sabermetrics are commonly used for everything from sportswriting to baseball Hall of Fame consideration, selecting player match-ups and evaluating in-game strategic options. Advanced statistical measures may be utilized in determining in-season and end-of-the-season awards (such as Player of the Week and MVP). Those which are most useful in evaluating past performance and predicting future outcomes are valuable in determining a player&#x27;s contributions to his team, potential trades, contract negotiations, and arbitration.

Recently, sabermetrics has been expanded to examining ballplayer minor league performance in AA and AAA ball in a manner similar to evaluating it at the Major League level, known as Minor-League Equivalency. 

=== AI in sabermetrics===
Machine learning and other forms of artificial intelligence (AI) can be applied to predicting future outcomes in baseball modeling, in-game strategy, personnel handling, and roster-building and contract negotiations.

==Advancements from 1985–present ==
Bill James&#x27; two books, &quot;The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot; (1985) and &quot;Win Shares&quot; (2002) have continued to advance the field of sabermetrics. The work of his former assistant Rob Neyer, who later became a senior writer at ESPN.com and national baseball editor of SBNation, also contributed to popularizing sabermetrics since the mid-1980s.

Nate Silver, a former writer and managing partner of &quot;Baseball Prospectus&quot;, invented PECOTA (&quot;Player Empirical Comparison and Optimization Test Algorithm&quot;) in 2002–2003, introducing it to the public in the book &quot;Baseball Prospectus&quot; in 2003. It assumes that the careers of similar players will follow a similar trajectory.

Beginning in the 2007 baseball season, MLB started looking at technology to record detailed information regarding each pitch that is thrown in a game. This became known as the PITCHf/x system, which uses video cameras to record pitch speed at its release point and crossing the plate, location, and angle (if any) of a break. 

FanGraphs is a website that utilizes this information and other play-by-play data to publish advanced baseball statistics and graphics.

== In popular culture ==
* &quot;Moneyball&quot;, the 2011 film about Billy Beane&#x27;s use of sabermetrics to build the Oakland Athletics. The film is based on Michael Lewis&#x27;s .
* In the television show &quot;Numb3rs&quot;, the season 3 episode &quot;Hardball&quot; focuses on sabermetrics, and the season 1 episode &quot;Sacrifice&quot; also covers the subject.
* &quot;MoneyBART&quot;, the third episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ 22nd season, in which Lisa utilizes sabermetrics to coach Bart&#x27;s Little League Baseball team.

<doc id="28694" wikidata="Q384919" url="?curid=28694" title="Space Quest">
<text>Space Quest is a series of six comic science fiction adventure games released between 1986 and 1995. The games follow the adventures of a hapless janitor named Roger Wilco, who campaigns through the galaxy for &quot;truth, justice, and really clean floors&quot;. 

Initially created for Sierra On-Line by Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy (who called themselves the &quot;Two Guys from Andromeda&quot;), the games parodied both science fiction properties such as &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot; (the theme song itself is a parody of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; theme), as well as pop-culture phenomena from McDonald&#x27;s to Microsoft. The series featured a silly sense of humor heavily reliant on puns and wacky storylines. Roger Wilco, a perpetual loser, is often depicted as the underdog who repeatedly saves the universe (often by accident), only to be either ignored or punished for violating minor regulations in the process.

== Development ==
Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe, who had already worked together on the Sierra game &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, wanted to create a humorous science fiction adventure game. They also wanted it to star a janitor (a choice possibly inspired by the mop-wielding main character from Infocom&#x27;s humorous sci-fi text adventure &quot;Planetfall&quot;).

Murphy commented that &quot;Sierra was in a mindset where everything was medieval and it was all fairly serious. I wanted to do a game that was more fun. We even liked the idea of &#x27;fun death&#x27;! I mean, if the player is gonna die or fail, they should at least get a laugh out of it. So we came up with the idea of making death amusing. Let&#x27;s face it, most adventure games involve a good deal of frustration for the player. But we felt that if we made failure fun, to an extent, you might have players actually going back and looking for new ways to die, just to see what happens!&quot;

Crowe noted, &quot;We wanted to do two things for the player. One, we wanted him to feel as if he were in a movie, where he could just sort of kick back and enjoy the scenery. We also wanted the player to feel as if he really was the character on the screen.&quot;

Although skeptical, Ken Williams gave the idea a shot. Scott and Mark created a short demo, which ended up becoming the first four rooms of &quot;Space Quest I&quot;, at which point Williams gave the project the green light.

Both &quot;Space Quest I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; were developed in Adventure Game Interpreter, Sierra&#x27;s own programming language. &quot;Space Quest III&quot; was written in Sierra&#x27;s Creative Interpreter (SCI), which had 3-D capabilities. &quot;Space Quest IV&quot; marked an evolution in terms of graphics by increasing the number of colors from 16 to 256.

== Protagonist==
Roger Wilco is a fictional character and the protagonist of the &quot;Space Quest&quot; series, introduced in &quot;Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter&quot; in 1986. Roger is depicted as a bumbling but well-meaning everyman character. He is a spacefaring janitor who has a tendency to attract trouble and stumble into dangerous or interesting situations. Despite saving the universe on multiple occasions, he seems unable to gain any respect from society, and works as some type of &quot;sanitation engineer&quot; throughout the series.

The character&#x27;s name is a reference to voice procedure, one of many puns in the series (it means &quot;receiving you, will comply&quot;). The first two &quot;Space Quest&quot; games allowed the player to choose the character&#x27;s name, which defaulted to Roger Wilco if left blank. This feature was later removed in the remake of the first game.

Roger is originally a janitor from the planet Xenon of the Earnon system. He is first introduced as the janitor and sole survivor of the scientific research ship &quot;Arcada&quot;, which was overrun by the apparently hostile Sariens. After several extremely deadly adventures and a bit of janitorial work, he enters the StarCon Academy. Graduating in &quot;Space Quest V&quot;, he is promoted from a janitor to captain of the garbage scow &quot;SCS Eureka&quot;. He also meets Beatrice Creakworm Wankmeister, with whom he becomes romantically involved. In &quot;Space Quest 6&quot;, his spot in the limelight ends as he is busted back down to janitor and assigned to the backwoods of the cosmos.

According to &quot;Space Quest IV&quot;, Roger would eventually marry Beatrice and they would have a son (Roger Wilco Jr.) who would later travel back in time to save Roger&#x27;s life. Beatrice is absent from &quot;Space Quest 6&quot;, but she is mentioned in the game&#x27;s closing credits and by Roger himself. By the time of the fictional &quot;Space Quest XII&quot;, when Roger Jr. would be a young adult, Roger would be &quot;unavailable&quot; for some reason. The details are never disclosed.

While Roger retains his basic appearance and sustains no lasting damage from his swashbuckling and repeated near-mutilations, his hair begins the series brown and changes to blonde in the upgrade between parts &quot;III&quot; and &quot;IV&quot;. (The same has happened to fellow adventure protagonists Guybrush Threepwood and Devon Aidendale, in Devon&#x27;s case to the other direction.) While this retcon is never addressed in the game itself, it spawned a full-fledged fan game, &quot;Space Quest: The Lost Chapter&quot;.

Including him on the 2004 list of &quot;top ten working class heroes&quot;, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; opined that &quot;for a hero that Ken Williams (co-founder of Sierra) was initially unimpressed with, Roger Wilco has become a classic cult figure.&quot;

== Games ==

=== &quot;Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter&quot; ===
The original &quot;Space Quest&quot; game was released in October 1986 and quickly became a hit, selling in excess of 100,000 copies (sales are believed to be around 200,000 to date, not including the many compilations it has been included in). A remake was released in 1991 as &quot;Space Quest I: Roger Wilco in the Sarien Encounter&quot;.

=== &quot;Space Quest II: Vohaul&#x27;s Revenge&quot; ===
Released in 1987; Roger, with his newfound status of Hero, is transferred to the Xenon Orbital Station 4 and promoted to head (and only) janitor. All is quiet until he is abducted by Sludge Vohaul, who was behind the original Sarien attack of the &quot;Arcada&quot;. As Roger is being transported to the Labion labour mines as punishment for thwarting Sludge&#x27;s original plan, the prison ship crash-lands in a nearby jungle upon the planet. Our hero manages to escape his pursuers and the dangers of the Labion jungle and soon reaches Sludge&#x27;s asteroid base. Once again, it&#x27;s up to Roger alone to stop Vohaul&#x27;s evil plan: to eradicate sentient life from Xenon by launching millions of cloned insurance salesmen at the planet.

=== &quot;Space Quest III: The Pirates of Pestulon&quot; ===
Released in 1989; Roger&#x27;s escape pod from the end of &quot;Space Quest II&quot; is captured by an automated garbage freighter. He escapes the robot-controlled scow by repairing an old ship, the &quot;Aluminum Mallard&quot; (a play on Howard Hughes&#x27; &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;&#x27; &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;). He eventually discovers the sinister activities of a video game company known as ScumSoft run by the &quot;Pirates of Pestulon&quot;.

=== &quot;Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers&quot; ===
Released in 1991; in this installment, Roger embarks on a time-travel adventure through &quot;Space Quest&quot; games both real and fictional. A reborn Sludge Vohaul from the fictional &quot;Space Quest XII: Vohaul&#x27;s Revenge II&quot; chases Roger through time in an attempt to finally kill him. Roger also visits settings from the fictional &quot;Space Quest X: Latex Babes of Estros&quot; (whose title is a parody of Infocom&#x27;s game &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot;) and from &quot;Space Quest I&quot;; in the latter, the graphics and music revert to the style of the original game and Roger is threatened by a group of monochromatic bikers who consider Roger&#x27;s 256 colors to be pretentious (or comment on other graphics modes if played in EGA or monochrome).

The games &quot;Space Quest XII: Vohaul&#x27;s Revenge II&quot; and &quot;Space Quest X: Latex Babes of Estros&quot; were never actually developed or released as full games, they exist only internally in &quot;Space Quest IV&quot;.

=== &quot;Space Quest V: Roger Wilco – The Next Mutation&quot; ===
Released in 1993: in &quot;Space Quest V&quot;, Roger is now a cadet in the StarCon academy. He graduates (or rather, cheats through the final exam) and is appointed captain of his own spacecraft (actually a space garbage scow). The main plot is to stop a mutagenic disease that is spreading through the galaxy by discovering its source, and fighting everyone that got infected. In the end, the disease infected the crew members of the &quot;SCS Goliath&quot;, a powerful warship, whose commander, Raemes T. Quirk (a rather blatant spoof of Captain Kirk), subsequently attacks the &quot;Eureka&quot;. In the end, Roger sacrifices his ship to get rid of the plague – and suddenly, if temporarily, becomes the commander of the fleet&#x27;s flagship.

Roger&#x27;s cheating is, along with Raemes T. Quirk, a homage to William Shatner&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; character, who cheated on his own Starfleet exam by reprogramming a &quot;no-win&quot; scenario so that he could successfully complete it. In a typical twist of luck, however, Roger&#x27;s exam scores are still achieved by accident.

This entry was the first in the &quot;Space Quest&quot; series where only one of the two guys from andromeda, Mark Crowe, lead a &quot;Space Quest&quot; project, due to the fact that Scott Murphy was working on other projects.

=== &quot;Space Quest 6: Roger Wilco in The Spinal Frontier&quot; ===
Released in 1995, this game was the last to be released in the &quot;Space Quest&quot; series. Having defeated the diabolical pukoid mutants in &quot;Space Quest V&quot;, Captain Roger Wilco triumphantly returns to StarCon headquarters – only to be court-martialed due to breaking StarCon regulations while saving the galaxy. He&#x27;s busted down to Janitor Second Class, and assigned to the &quot;SCS DeepShip 86&quot; (a parody of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;), commanded by Commander Kielbasa, a Cowardly Lion look-alike whose name is taken from the Polish sausage as well as being a play on the names of both the feline Kilrathi from the video game series Wing Commander and of the character Mufasa from the animated motion picture The Lion King. His voice is a parody of Captain Jean-Luc Picard from Star Trek: The Next Generation. The main villain in the game is a wrinkly old lady named Sharpei, a pun on the dog Shar Pei, a wrinkly dog.

The game&#x27;s subtitle comes from the final portion, in which Roger has to undergo miniaturization and enter the body of a shipmate and romantic interest. (This segment also provided the game&#x27;s original subtitle, &quot;Where in Corpsman Santiago is Roger Wilco?&quot;, which was not used due to legal threats from the makers of the &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; products.)

Sadly, once again, only one of the Two Guys from Andromeda worked on this game. This time though, it was Scott Murphy who sat in the director&#x27;s chair, more or less. Scott was actually a co-director of &quot;Space Quest 6&quot; with another Sierra employee, Josh Mandel, who&#x27;d worked on many of the behind-the-scenes aspects of &quot;Space Quest IV&quot; and &quot;V&quot;, as well as helping create the SCI remake of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest I&quot;. Josh actually worked on and created the majority of &quot;Space Quest 6&quot;, and had to step out when the project was already near completion, and that&#x27;s when Scott Murphy just stepped in and did the rest.

=== &quot;Space Quest 6: The Spinal Frontier Interactive Demo&quot; ===
The demo for &quot;Space Quest 6&quot; is actually a short game unto itself. It uses the Space Quest 6 engine and takes place aboard the &quot;SCS DeepShip 86&quot; but is a stand-alone adventure. The ship is taken over by Borg-like invaders called the Bjorn, and Wilco must defeat them.

=== In-fiction future sequels ===
In &quot;Space Quest IV&quot;, Roger travels into both the past and future of the game&#x27;s timeline. Even in-game characters are conscious of living in a video game, and refer to eras with sequel numbers, not temporal units (such as years), even though specific years are named elsewhere in the &quot;Space Quest&quot; canon. Portions of the game took place in the time frames of the following &quot;sequels&quot;:
* &quot;Space Quest X: Latex Babes of Estros&quot; (a reference to Infocom&#x27;s &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot;): In this timeframe, Roger or his son, Roger Jr. had had an undetermined affair with Zondra of the Latex Babes, which he ended abruptly. This timeframe contains the planet Estros and the &quot;Galaxy Galleria&quot; space station mall.
* &quot;Space Quest XII: Vohaul&#x27;s Revenge II&quot;: In this timeframe, Vohaul&#x27;s consciousness has been uploaded in the Xenon Super Computer and infected it like a virus. He took over the planet and is sending his minions back in time to kill Roger Wilco. An underground resistance is formed against him, including his nemesis&#x27; son, Roger Wilco Jr.

These games were never actually created, and only exist within the plot of &quot;Space Quest IV&quot;. Scott Murphy has stated that he did intend to use these titles if the series had made it that far and the storyline still permitted it.

=== &quot;Roger Wilco&#x27;s Spaced Out Game Pack&quot; ===
Budget software including several mini-games taken from the &quot;Space Quest&quot; series. Including hoverspeeder, Monolith Burger maker, and Ms. Astro Chicken.

=== &quot;Planet Pinball&quot; ===
&quot;Planet Pinball&quot; is a series of three &quot;Space Quest IV&quot; themed pinball boards in Take a Break! Pinball. The boards include; Level One: Planet Xenon in the Beginning, Level Two: Spaced Travel, Level Three: Reformation Day.

=== &quot;Hoyle Book of Games&quot; ===
Roger Wilco appears as an opponent in &quot;Hoyle&#x27;s Official Book of Games, Volume I&quot;. He has conversations with the other opponents, talking about his adventures in the first three &quot;Space Quest&quot; games. Roger Wilco is trapped in the Hoyle game, and is trying to find a way to escape back to his game world.

Roger Wilco returns in &quot;Hoyle 3&quot;, along with bad guy characters, Arnoid and Vohaul, but the characters are limited to talking about the game itself.

Roger also appears as an opponent in &quot;Hoyle Classic Card Games&quot;, the fourth game in the series. Again, interaction is limited to the game only.

== Cancelled games ==

=== &quot;Space Quest VII: Return to Roman Numerals&quot; ===
Sierra tried on several occasions to revive the series for another episode, with a working subtitle of &quot;The Return to Roman Numerals&quot;, since the previous game was titled &quot;Space Quest 6&quot;, not &quot;Space Quest VI&quot;.

Development of &quot;Space Quest VII&quot; was underway in 1996 when Sierra released &quot;The Space Quest Collection&quot;, which consisted of &quot;Space Quest I&quot; through &quot;6&quot; and included a brief trailer of &quot;Space Quest VII&quot; (consisting of Roger strapping a giant rocket to his back and using it to push himself forward on roller skates in a scene reminiscent of Wile E. Coyote). Little was released regarding story line, interface, et cetera, although there was speculation that the game would introduce a multiplayer aspect. Scott Murphy said during development that &quot;Space Quest VII&quot; would contain some 3D elements, but would not require the use of a 3D accelerator card. Due to poor sales of &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;, a high-profile adventure game by LucasArts, there was a perception that humorous adventure games were no longer viable, so when Vivendi took over Sierra, &quot;Space Quest VII&quot; was cancelled.

This project was eventually restarted in 1999, and pitched to management, but ultimately did not have enough support to continue within the company. Few details are known about the &quot;SQVII&quot; relaunch, save that there was one very ardent supporter, who later left Vivendi.

=== &quot;Space Quest&quot; ===
Another &quot;Space Quest&quot; began development by Escape Factory for the Microsoft Xbox video game console in 2002, entitled simply &quot;Space Quest&quot;.

This attempt at creating a new &quot;Space Quest&quot; was announced on February 7, 2002. Development proceeded for almost a year and a half before the project was cancelled. According to &quot;Space Quest 6&quot; designer Josh Mandel, the &quot;SQVII&quot; designers were forbidden from using story elements from the original &quot;Space Quest&quot; games or from even playing the games. This is disputable, since other sources claimed the developers had played the games before. Website FYI.com, also claimed that this &quot;gutted&quot; &quot;SQVII&quot; would not have been an adventure game at all and would have been released only on game console platforms such as the Xbox rather than the PC. Since then, the Vivendi&#x27;s Product Manager Bruce Goodwill, has confirmed that the title was going to be released only on console platforms.

The game was planned as a departure from the main &quot;Space Quest&quot; series, rumors it starred a new character named &quot;Wilger&quot;, although Roger Wilco was playable (as seen in a production video). Though it would have maintained a comedic theme in space, no plan was made to connect it to the original series. It was cancelled around 2023.

* &quot;Inside Space Quest&quot;

=== Fall 2006 releases ===
Vivendi Universal has re-released the &quot;Space Quest Collection&quot; (originally named &quot;Space Quest Compilation&quot;) that is compatible with Windows XP. The collection was released September 15, 2006.

The &quot;Space Quest&quot; games were made compatible by the licensing of DOSBox, a free program that allows users to play old DOS games on Windows XP. The games were re-released as &quot;Space Quest Collection&quot; on July 23, 2009 on Steam. It is so far unavailable in Australia and New Zealand.

== Other media ==
&quot;Space Quest&quot; merchandise included the &quot;Space Quest III&quot; VHS tape and pin, &quot;Space Quest 6&quot; mug, calling card and patch and an autographed picture of Roger Wilco.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://frostbytei.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Two strategy guides were released that contained novelizations of the first five games from Roger Wilco&#x27;s perspective.

The first of these included &quot;The Space Quest Companion&quot; by Peter and Jeremy Spear. The book is similar to Peter Spear&#x27;s &quot;The King&#x27;s Quest Companion&quot; and &quot;The Official Uncensored Leisure Suit Larry Bedside Companion&quot;. The first edition covered the first four games (with a preview of SQ5), and the second added the fifth game. It was written from the perspective of Roger Wilco sending journals on disks back into the past, so that his adventures could be made into video games so that his great-grandparents (x-times removed) would have a chance to meet each other and fall in love through their mutual love of the games. Thus, by inspiring the game designers to create the games, he insured his own future existence. Each story began with Roger&#x27;s daydreams and his fantasies of marrying Cornucopia Agricorp and later Beatrice Wankmeister.

The other was &quot;The Official Guide To Roger Wilco&#x27;s Space Adventures&quot; by Jill Champion. It is similar to her &quot;The Official Book of Police Quest&quot;. It came in two editions as well. The book contains two interviews with Roger Wilco (one just after events of &quot;SQIV&quot;, and the other after &quot;SQV&quot;). The novels themselves are written as Roger&#x27;s running monologues during his adventures. The first edition covers &quot;SQ&quot; EGA to &quot;SQIV&quot;, and the second edition covers &quot;SQI&quot; remake up until &quot;SQV&quot;. The novel of SQ1 in the first edition is based on the original SQ1, and the version in the second edition is based on the remake of SQ1.

Adventure Comics (a division of Malibu Comics) released three issues in 1992 of a comic based on &quot;Space Quest I&quot; under the name &quot;The Adventures of Roger Wilco&quot;. The first was written by John Shaw and was in full colour. The other two were written by Paul O&#x27;Connor and were black and white. The print run was very small, and the books are very hard to find now.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Thy Dungeonman II&quot;, a text adventure game from the creators of Homestar Runner, uses cover art that depicts the title character holding a mop in the same way Roger Wilco does on the &quot;Space Quest&quot; box art. He is also described as a &quot;custodial knight&quot; and the mop is also used to defeat enemies in a maze portion of the game.

=== Fan-made games ===
The series has remained popular with Sierra fans, and several fan sites are still active and maintain a community dedicated to the games. There have been several attempts to create a &quot;Space Quest&quot; fan game, such as the now-canceled SQ7.org project, and several fan games have actually been released.

Games set in the &quot;Space Quest&quot; universe:
* &quot;Space Quest 0: Replicated&quot; – a prequel to &quot;Space Quest I&quot;.
* &quot;Space Quest: The Lost Chapter&quot; – set between the second and third games.
* &quot;Space Quest IV.5: Roger Wilco And The Voyage Home&quot; – set between the fourth and fifth game.
* &quot;Space Quest: Vohaul Strikes Back&quot; – an original hi-res installment set after &quot;Space Quest 6&quot;.
* &quot;Space Quest 2 Remake: Vohaul&#x27;s Revenge&quot; – a remake of &quot;Space Quest 2&quot; (which was originally in EGA and played with a text parser) in the style of &quot;Space Quest IV&quot;, developed by Infamous Adventures.
* &quot;Space Quest: Incinerations&quot; – another original hi-res installment, with a more action-oriented approach in the traditional adventure genre and with a modern sensibility. According to Rock, Paper, Shotgun, &quot;Incinerations&quot; &quot;completely re-imagines the whole &quot;Space Quest&quot; series as a sci-fi action thriller, focusing hard on character and drama while still managing to be just as tongue-in-cheek and funny as anything else that bears its name.&quot;
* &quot;Space Quest Minus 1: Decisions of the Elders&quot; – a hybrid combination of old-style AGI graphics with icon-driven interface.
* &quot;Space Quest: A Son of Xenon&quot; – a prequel to &quot;Space Quest I&quot;.
* &quot;Space Quest 3D&quot; - a remake of &quot;Space Quest 3&quot; with modern (even 3D) graphics and a point-and-click interface (while the original was in EGA and played with a text parser).

Games influenced by &quot;Space Quest&quot;:
* &quot;Cosmos Quest&quot; – Adventure game influenced by &quot;Space Quest&quot;.

=== &quot;SpaceVenture&quot; ===
On April 14, 2012, Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy announced they had reunited and were planning an original adventure game set in space. They established a new game development company called Two Guys from Andromeda for that purpose. Co-founder of the company Chris Pope (dubbed as &quot;Space Pope&quot; from fans) works to operate its marketing and interact directly with fans as well as Executive Producer. A Kickstarter project was launched to fund the development of the new game or &quot;SpaceVenture&quot;, with plans to feature the voice of Gary Owens (narrator of &quot;Space Quest IV&quot; and &quot;6&quot;), prior to his death in 2015.

On June 13, 2012, they achieved their goal of $500,000 eventually raising $539,768 from their Kickstarter campaign, and began work on the game. In September 2012, enough funding was achieved to enable them to translate the game into German, Spanish, French and Italian.

The game acts as a spiritual successor to the &quot;Space Quest&quot; series, including the use of a blue-collar worker (now a repairman rather than a janitor) as its protagonist. The hero in this case is named &quot;Ace Hardway&quot; after the home improvement chain Ace Hardware. Another character is &quot;Cluck Y&#x27;egger&quot;, after test pilot Chuck Yeager. He is a chicken superhero based on the Astro Chicken running gag in the &quot;Space Quest&quot; series. The game will be rendered in CGI, but a &quot;retro graphics&quot; feature has been proposed.

In June 2013, it was announced that there would be a playable Alpha demo at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con.

In January 2014, the game had a projected late 2015 release date. In October 2015, the &quot;Two Guys of Andromeda&quot; promised to continue development and to release the game in November 2016. On June 2, 2019, an update was released on the Two Guys from Andromeda Twitter and Kickstarter pages revealing the box art for the game.

On July 31, 2020, a complete beta was released to Kickstarter backers.

The game was finally released, over ten years since the project launched, on September 16, 2022. It was released initially to Kickstarter backers only. At launch, multiple softlocks were reported and the tutorial mode was described as &quot;broken&quot;. Overall, the game was said to be in a &quot;poor state&quot; and a &quot;mess&quot;. A December 2023 update stated that the developers were working on updates and that customers would receive a new build when it was complete.

<text>A mercy rule, slaughter rule, knockout rule, or skunk rule ends a two-competitor sports competition earlier than the scheduled endpoint if one competitor has a very large and presumably insurmountable scoring lead over the other. It is called the &quot;mercy&quot; rule because it spares further humiliation for the loser. It is common in youth sports in North America, where running up the score is considered unsporting. It is especially common in baseball and softball in which there is no game clock and a dominant team could in theory continue an inning endlessly.

The rules vary widely, depending on the level of competition, but nearly all youth sports leagues and high school sports associations and many college sports associations in the United States have mercy rules for sports including baseball, softball, American football and association football.

However, mercy rules usually do not take effect until a prescribed point in the game (like the second half of an association football game). Thus, one team, particularly if it is decidedly better than a weaker opponent, can still &quot;run up the score&quot; before the rule takes effect. For instance, in American football, one team could be ahead by 70 points with three minutes left in the first half; in baseball, the better team could have a 20-run lead in the second inning, but the game would still continue.

== American football ==

===Middle and high school football===
At the middle- or high-school level, 34 states use a mercy rule that may involve a &quot;continuous clock&quot; (the clock continues to operate on most plays when the clock would normally stop, such as an incomplete pass) once a team has a certain lead (for example, 35 points) during the second half (Louisiana adopted a rule in 2022 which states the running clock is invoked when the margin reaches 42 points at any time during the game). That greatly decreases the amount of time taken for a game to complete, which reduces the leading team&#x27;s chances to score more and the time that the trailing team must spend in facing an insurmountable deficit. In most states, the clock stops only for scores, timeouts (officials&#x27;, injury, or charged), or the end of the quarter. Plays that would normally stop the clock, such as penalties, incomplete passes, going out of bounds, or change of possession, would not stop the clock. The rule varies by state; for example, the clock does not stop upon a score in Colorado, Indiana, Kansas (regular-season games only), or Missouri (fourth quarter only).

In most states, once the point differential is reduced to below the mercy rule-invoking amount, normal timing procedures resume until either the end of the game or the mercy rule-invoking point differential is re-established; in Colorado, Georgia, Kansas and Louisiana, the clock continues to run even if the differential falls below the threshold. Most states that have mercy rules waive this rule for a championship game.

In some states, coaches and game officials may choose to end a game at their own discretion at any time during the second half if the continuous clock rule is in effect; that usually happens if a lopsided margin continues to increase or if threatening weather is imminent. Sometimes the coach of the team that is losing agrees to shorten the length of a quarter in addition to the continuous clock rule. Although it is rare, some states or high school conferences have rules in which the team with a very large lead may not run a certain play for the rest of the game, such as a deep pass or outside run.

In some states (where 8-man and 6-man football is widely used), the rules call for a game to end when one team is ahead by a certain score (like 45 or 50 points) at halftime or any time thereafter. In other states with 6- or 8-man football, continuous clock rules are used, and the rule may be modified; for instance, in Iowa, the rule goes into effect if the 35-point differential is reached at any time after the first quarter.

In a variant on the mercy rule used in Connecticut high school football from 2006 to 2016, the team&#x27;s coach was issued a one-game suspension (i.e., for the team&#x27;s next game) if at any point the team had a 50-point lead. In 2016 it was replaced with a running clock rule.

===College football===

The National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s mercy rule provides, &quot;Any time during the game, the playing time of any remaining period or periods and the intermission between halves may be shortened by mutual agreement of the opposing head coaches and the referee.&quot; (NCAA Football Rule 3-2-2-a) NCAA Football Approved Ruling 3-2-2-I cites an example: &quot;At halftime the score is 56–0. The coaches and the referee agree that the third and fourth quarters should be shortened to 12 minutes each. The coaches also request that the second half be played with a &#x27;running clock&#x27; i.e., that the game clock not be stopped.&quot; The NCAA Football Rules Committee determined, &quot;The remaining quarters may be shortened to 12 minutes each. However, the &#x27;running clock&#x27; is not allowed; normal clock rules apply for the entire game.&quot;

The most recent example of an NCAA football game shortened by invoking this rule occurred on September 13, 2024, when the South Alabama Jaguars played the Northwestern State Demons. After the third quarter, with the Jaguars leading the Demons 87–10, both coaches agreed to shorten the fourth quarter to six minutes, resulting in 51 minutes of play. This was the most points scored by a FBS team since 1991. The shortened game resulted in some sportsbooks voiding bets due to house rules requiring 55 minutes of play for the game to count.

On September 7, 2024, the Georgia Bulldogs led the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles 45–0 at the end of the third quarter. Both coaches agreed to shorten the fourth quarter to ten minutes. The final score was 48–3.

On August 29, 2024, the Arkansas Razorbacks led the Arkansas–Pine Bluff Golden Lions 49–0 at halftime. By mutual agreement, the coaches agreed on ten minute lengths for the third and fourth quarters. The final score was 70–0, and some sportsbooks voided bets due to an insufficient game length.

October 1, 2022, when the Syracuse Orange played the Wagner Seahawks. The mismatched Wagner team trailed the 4-0 Syracuse team 49–0 at halftime. In the second half coaches and the referee agreed to 10 minute quarters. Syracuse head coach Dino Babers made the controversial choice of leaving some of Syracuse&#x27;s starting players in late into the second half. The final score of the game was 59–0.

September 21, 2019, Ohio State was leading Miami (OH) 76–5 in Columbus, Ohio with 2:40 left in the 4th quarter when the game was temporarily suspended due to lightning. Both coaches agreed to end the game with the final score standing as is.

September 1, 2018, the rule was enacted during a game Georgia played against Austin Peay in Athens, Georgia.  With the score 45–0 in the 3rd quarter and a high heat index, the Austin Peay Coach Will Healy suggested to Georgia head coach Kirby Smart that they play a 10-minute fourth quarter instead of the typical 15 minute fourth quarter.  The coaches and referee agreed and the game was shortened.

September 24, 2016, the Missouri Tigers led Delaware State 58–0 at halftime. The coaches agreed to shorten the third and fourth quarters from 15 minutes to 10 minutes each, shortening the total game time from 60 minutes to 50 minutes. Missouri added three touchdowns in the abbreviated second half to make the final score 79–0, setting team records for the most points scored in a game (79), the greatest margin of victory (79), and the largest number of touchdowns scored (11).

Also in 2016, the game between Clemson and South Carolina State had both the third and fourth quarters shortened from 15 minutes to 12 as a result of Clemson leading the game at half 45–0. The final score of the game was 59–0.

Earlier in 2016, the game between Texas State and Arkansas saw the fourth quarter shortened to 10 minutes when severe thunderstorms were approaching Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium. Arkansas led 42–3 at the end of the third quarter, and the final period was scoreless. A similar scenario took place in 2017 in the game between TCU and Kansas, where the coaches agreed to a running clock for the final 12:49 of the game due to severe thunderstorms approaching Amon G. Carter Stadium.

In a 2013 game, Old Dominion University (ODU) was losing to the University of North Carolina (UNC) 80–20 when ODU coach Bobby Wilder asked for the fourth quarter to be shortened by five minutes, which UNC coach Larry Fedora agreed to. Fedora also directed his quarterback to take a knee on fourth and goal with 1:53 remaining to not run up the score.

In a 1988 game, Kansas Jayhawks coach Glen Mason asked if a running clock could be used after his team trailed 49–0 at halftime to the Auburn Tigers. Auburn coach Pat Dye and the officials agreed, and Auburn ended up a 56–7 winner.

In 2015, another shortened game occurred when the Boston College Eagles dominated the Howard Bison 62–0 by halftime. The coaches agreed to remove five minutes from each quarter of the second half of the game.

Despite the NCAA Football Rules Committee&#x27;s subsequent ruling (A.R. 3-2-2-I) that a &quot;running clock&quot; is not permitted, a continuous clock was used September 5, 2013, beginning in the fourth quarter when the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets had a 63–0 lead against the Elon Phoenix. That was at the request of Elon coach Jason Swepson and agreed upon by Georgia Tech coach Paul Johnson. Georgia Tech won the game 70–0.

However, in the Mississippi Association of Community and Junior Colleges, a running clock is allowed if the team is ahead by 38 points or more. This rule, unique only to the MACJC, was instituted in 2013.

==Soccer==

International Blind Sports Federation rules require that any time during a game in which one team has scored ten more goals than the other team that game is deemed completed. In U.S. high school soccer, most states use a mercy rule that ends the game if one team is ahead by 10 or more goals at any point from halftime onward. Youth soccer leagues use variations on the rule.

==Baseball and softball==

International competitions are sanctioned by the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC), formed by the 2013 merger of the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) and International Softball Federation (ISF).

In international baseball competition and the World Baseball Classic (WBC), games are ended when one team is ahead by 10 runs, once at least seven completed innings are played by the trailing team. In seven-inning contests (women&#x27;s competition and doubleheaders), the same applies after five innings of a seven-inning game.

The inaugural WBC in 2006 followed the IBAF mercy rule, with an additional rule stopping a game after five innings when a team is ahead by at least 15 runs. The mercy rules applied to the round-robin (now double-elimination) matches only, not to the semi-finals or final.

In a six-inning game such as Little League Baseball and Softball, rules call for the game to end if the winning team is ahead by 15 runs after three innings played or 10 runs after four innings played by the trailing team. In a seven-inning game at the intermediate level or higher, the corresponding run rule is applied for 15 runs after four innings, or 10 runs after five innings. Little League refers to this rule as the &quot;run rule&quot;, instead of the &quot;mercy rule&quot;.

Softball rules are different for fast/modified fast pitch and slow pitch. In WBSC-sanctioned competitions, the run-ahead rule (the WBSC terminology) is, for fast or modified fast pitch, 20 runs after three innings, 15 after four, or 8 after 5. In slow pitch, the margin is 20 runs after four innings or 15 after five. The NCAA has also adopted the rule.

In regular season or conference tournament NCAA and NAIA college baseball, the IBAF rule may be implemented. Most NCAA conferences limit the rule to the final day of a series, for travel reasons, or primarily during conference tournaments where four to five games are played in a day, in order to allow the next game to start. The rule is not allowed in NCAA tournament play (regionals, super regionals and Men&#x27;s College World Series), in which all games must be at least nine innings.

In NCAA softball (where the rule is called the &quot;run rule&quot;), the rule is invoked if one team is ahead by at least eight runs after five innings and, unlike with college baseball, applies in the NCAA tournament as well with the exception of the championship series. In American high school softball, most states use a mercy rule of 20 runs ahead in three innings or 10 in five innings. (In either case, if the home team is ahead by the requisite number of runs, the game will end after the top half of the inning.) In American softball, &quot;run-rule&quot; has become a verb, with the winning team in a game which ends due to this rule often said to have &quot;run-ruled&quot; its opponent (also expressed as the losing team having been &quot;run-ruled&quot;).

Most state high school associations (where games are seven innings) use the IBAF Women&#x27;s rule after five innings have been played by the trailing team; some associations further the rule by ending a game after either three or four innings if the lead is at least 15 runs. For softball, the rule is 12 after three innings and 10 after five. However, since the home team has the last at-bat, the rules usually allow visiting teams to score an unlimited number of runs in the top half of an inning. That can be prevented by invoking the rule only after the home team has completed its half of the inning.

In Baseball5, a WBSC variation of baseball and softball which is played to five innings, a team which leads by 15 runs after three innings or 10 after four innings automatically wins.

Due to the untimed nature of innings, some leagues either impose caps on the number of runs that can be scored in one inning (usually in the 4-8 range) or limit the number of plate appearances in an inning (typically, such a limit will consist of one rotation of the batting order). Such rules ensure that games will complete in a reasonable length of time, but it can also mean that a lead of a certain size becomes insurmountable by the cap, which can be prevented by not invoking the rule in such circumstances.

==Basketball==

In high school basketball, many states have a &quot;continuous clock&quot; rule, similar to American football, which takes effect in the second half after a lead grows to a prescribed point (in Iowa, 35 points or more; in Kansas, 30 points or more but only in the fourth quarter; in Louisiana, the rule is invoked at any time during the game when one team gains a 35-point lead). The clock stops only for charged, officials&#x27; or injury time-outs; or at the end of the third quarter. The clock would not stop when it would normally stop, such as for fouls, free throws, out-of-bounds plays or substitutions.

The rules vary when normal timing procedures take effect after a lead is diminished (such as because of the trailing team&#x27;s rally); for instance, in Iowa, normal timing procedures are enforced if the lead is lowered to 25 points but re-instituted once the lead grows back to 35 or more points. By comparison, in Kansas, if the running clock is triggered, it will not stop except for a timeout or an injury even if the differential is reduced to under 30 points. As with other sports, some states offer provisions to allow a team to end the game early by mutual decision of the coaches (for instance, if a large lead continues to grow and the talent disparity is obvious).

==Boxing==

In amateur boxing, if a boxer trails by more than 20 points, the referee stops the fight and the boxer that is leading automatically wins; bouts which end this way may be noted as &quot;RSC&quot; (referee stopped contest) with notations for an outclassed opponent (RSCO), outscored opponent (RSCOS), injury (RSCI) or head injury (RSCH).

While a boxer who loses on the mercy rule is scored RSCO and would be similar to a technical knockout in professional boxing, it is not scored a loss by knockout, and the 28-day suspension for losing on a knockout does not apply.

==Cricket==

Cricket does not have any rules that terminate a game early based on one team&#x27;s lead, since in most competitions, teams aim to win as big as possible in order to improve their net run rate, which helps them qualify if they tie with another team for the playoffs. However, first-class cricket has the follow-on rule, which allows the team that bats first, if they lead by a specified run margin after their opponents&#x27; first innings, to require the opposing team to bat their second innings next. The first team may still have a second innings if their opponents&#x27; combined innings&#x27; scores surpass their first innings&#x27; score. Also, the rules allow a declaration to be called by a team during their innings to end the innings before ten wickets have fallen (10 outs). Either action can be taken if a team believes it would help them more quickly complete the conditions necessary to win within the time limit (up to five days).

==Curling==

In curling, the losing team can concede at any time, except for international competitions, where they need to wait until the completion of the 6th end to do so (and 8th end in play-off games).

In curling conducted by Special Olympics Canada, games end if 6 ends have passed and one team leads by 10 points.

== Goalball ==

In the Paralympic team sport for the vision-impaired, goalball, a maximum goal difference is when &#x27;any time one team has scored ten goals more than the team it is playing&#x27;. The game ends immediately upon that goal. This rule commenced on 1 January 2002.

==Wrestling==
In American collegiate wrestling and high school wrestling, a wrestler wins by technical fall, and the match ends, if he builds a 15-point lead. If a wrestler gains a 15-point lead by having his opponent in a near-fall, the referee will allow the offensive wrestler the opportunity to win by fall without liability to be reversed and pinned. The bout ends when a fall is awarded or the near-fall ends.

In freestyle wrestling, a wrestler wins by technical fall if he builds a 10-point lead. In Greco-Roman, a wrestler wins by technical fall if he builds an 8-point lead.

<doc id="28696" wikidata="Q186367" url="?curid=28696" title="Sumbawa">
<text>Sumbawa, is an Indonesian island, located in the middle of the Lesser Sunda Islands chain, with Lombok to the west, Flores to the east, and Sumba further to the southeast. Along with Lombok, it forms the province of West Nusa Tenggara, but there have been plans (currently held in abeyance) by the Indonesian government to split the island off into a separate province. Traditionally, the island is known as the source of sappanwood, as well as honey and sandalwood. Its savanna-like climate and vast grasslands are used to breed horses and cattle, as well as to hunt deer.
Sumbawa has an area (including minor offshore islands) of (three times the size of Lombok) with a population (at the 2020 Census) of 1,561,461; the official estimate as at mid-2023 was 1,626,517. It marks the boundary between the islands to the west, which were influenced by religion and culture spreading from India, and the region to the east which was less influenced. In particular, this applies to both Hinduism and Islam. While the name &quot;Sumbawa&quot; is used by outsiders for the whole island, locally the term is only applied to the western half (Sumbawa and West Sumbawa Regencies), while the eastern half is referred to by inhabitants as &quot;Bima&quot; (meaning the city as well as Bima and Dompu Regencies), as the two parts of the island are divided by geography, culture and language.

==Etymology==
Sumbawa come from Portuguese Cumbava or Cimbava, assimilated from the locally used name &quot;Sambawa&quot; (still found as such in Makassarese, cf. also &quot;Semawa&quot; in the Sumbawa language). This name is probably derived from Sanskrit &quot;śāmbhawa&quot; (), meaning &#x27;related to &quot;Śambhu&quot; (= &#x27;the Benevolent&#x27;, a name for Shiva)&#x27;. 

==History==
The 14th-century Nagarakretagama mentioned several principalities identified to be on Sumbawa; Dompu, Bima, Sape, and one on the Sang Hyang Api island just off the coast of northeast Sumbawa. Four principalities in western Sumbawa were dependencies of the Majapahit Empire of eastern Java. Because of Sumbawa&#x27;s natural resources, it was regularly invaded by outside forces – from the Javanese, Balinese, and Makassar, to the Dutch and Japanese. The Dutch first arrived in 1605 but did not effectively rule Sumbawa until the early 20th century.

For a short period, the Balinese kingdom of Gelgel ruled a part of western Sumbawa. The eastern parts of the island were traditionally divided into four sultanates: Sumbawa, Sanggau, Dompo, and Bima, which had links to the Bugis and Makassar peoples of South Sulawesi. 

Historical evidence indicates that people on Sumbawa island were known in the East Indies for their honey, horses, sappanwood, which is used to make red dye, and sandalwood, which is used for incense and medications. The area was thought to be highly productive agriculturally. In the 18th century, the Dutch introduced coffee plantations on the western slopes of Mount Tambora, a volcano on the north side of Sumbawa, thus creating the Tambora coffee variant.

Tambora&#x27;s colossal eruption in 1815 was the most powerful in recorded history, ejecting of ash and debris into the atmosphere. The eruption killed up to 71,000 people and triggered a period of global cooling known as the &quot;Year Without a Summer&quot; in 1816. It also apparently destroyed a small culture of Papuan affinity, known to archaeologists as the &quot;Tambora culture&quot;.

==Administration==
Sumbawa is administratively divided into four regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and one kota (city). The regencies and cities are listed below with their administrative capitals, their areas, and their populations at the 2010 census and the 2020 census, together with the official estimates as of mid-2023.

Proposals have been under consideration since 2013 by the People&#x27;s Representative Council (&quot;Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat&quot; or DPR) to create a separate Sumbawa Island province; there is no information as to whether the remaining part of the present province (i.e. the districts comprising Lombok Island) would then be renamed. However, since 2013 the Indonesian Government have maintained a moratorium on the intended creation of new provinces, regencies and cities.

== Demographics ==
Islam, the dominant faith of the island, was introduced by the Makassarese of Sulawesi.

Sumbawa had, historically speaking, three major linguistic groups who spoke languages that were unintelligible to each other. The Sumbawa people centered on the western side of the island speak Basa Semawa (Indonesian: &quot;Bahasa Sumbawa&quot;) which is similar to the Sasak language from nearby Lombok; the Bima people in the east speak Nggahi Mbojo (&quot;Bahasa Bima&quot;), which is closer to the languages spoken on Flores and Sumba. They were once separated by the Tambora culture, which spoke a language related to neither. After the demise of Tambora due to the 1815 eruption, local kingdoms based in Sumbawa Besar and Bima became the two focal points of Sumbawa. This division of the island into two parts remains today; Sumbawa Besar and Bima are the two largest towns on the island (although the town of Dompu to the west of Bima has a greater urban area population than Sumbawa Besar), and are the centers of distinct cultural groups that share the island. The Don Donggo or &quot;Mountain People&quot; are a small minority ethnic group who occupy the cloudy highlands west of Bima Bay. 

The population of the island (including minor outlying islands) was 1.56 million at the latest decennial census in 2020, comprising 29.46% of the population of the entire Province of West Nusa Tenggara&#x27;s 5.32 million people; the official estimate as at mid-2023 was 1,626,517 - of whom 682,437 inhabit the western half and 944,080 the eastern half of the island.

Due to the lack of work opportunities on the island and its frequent droughts, many people on the island seek work in the Middle East as laborers or domestic servants; some 500,000 workers, or over 10% of the population of West Nusa Tenggara, have left the country to work overseas such as China and Singapore.

==Geography==

The island is bounded by bodies of water; to the west is Alas Strait, south is the Indian Ocean, Saleh Bay creates a major north-central indentation in the island, and the Flores Sea runs the length of the northern coastline. The Sape Strait lies to the east of the island and separates Sumbawa from Flores and the Komodo Islands, there are several bays and gulfs, most notably Bima Bay, Cempi Bay, and Waworada Bay.

Sumbawa&#x27;s most distinguishing features are Saleh Bay and the Sanggar Peninsula. On the latter stands Mount Tambora (8°14’41” S, 117°59’35” E), a large stratovolcano famous for its VEI 7 eruption in 1815, one of only a few eruptions of such magnitude in the last 2,000 years. The eruption obliterated most of Tambora&#x27;s summit, reducing its height by about a third and leaving a six-kilometer-wide caldera. Regardless, Tambora remains the highest point on the island. Highlands rise in four spots on the island, as well as on Sangeang Island. The large western lobe of Sumbawa is dominated by a large central highland, and Tambora, Dompu, and Bima each have more minor highlands.

There are several large surrounding islands, most notably Moyo Island, volcanically active Sangeang Island, and the tourist Komodo Islands (administered under Flores) to the east.

Sumbawa is part of the Lesser Sunda deciduous forests ecoregion.

==Economy==

Many of the island residents are at risk of starvation when crops fail due to lack of rainfall. The majority of the population works in agriculture. Tourism is just beginning, with a few surf spots renowned for being world-class, Jelenga and Supersuck Beaches near the mine, as well as Hu&#x27;u and Lakey Beach in the Gulf of Cempi.

===Newmont Mine===
A large gold and copper mine, Newmont Mining Corporation&#x27;s Batu Hijau mine began commercial operations in 2000, a decade after the copper and gold were discovered. Newmont holds a 45% stake in the operation through its shareholding in PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara. A local unit of Japan&#x27;s Sumitomo Corporation has a 35% share. The mine is located in southwest Sumbawa.

Due to the mine, Sumbawa Barat Regency along with other remote mining towns, and Jakarta, has the highest GDP per capita rates in Indonesia, Sumbawa Barat&#x27;s is 156.25 million rupiah (US$17,170) , Newmont and its partners have invested about $1.9 billion in the mine. The reserves are expected to last until 2034, making Batu Hijau one of the largest copper mines in the world.&lt;br&gt;
It is also one of the worst water-polluting mines, notably with at least three pipe breaks since its opening in 1999.

Another important deposit of gold and copper has been discovered in 2020 near Onto. PT Sumbawa Timur Mining (STM) hopes to start exploitation in 2030.

==Transport==
There is a road network in Sumbawa, but it is poorly maintained and has long portions of rough gravel. Frequent ferry service to Sumbawa (Poto Tano) from Lombok (Labuhan Lombok) exists; however, the ferry service to Flores from Sape is infrequent. Bima is the largest city on Sumbawa and has ferry and bus services directly to Java and Bali, though service breakdowns are common.

The most convenient way to reach Sumbawa is via air. Commercial flights connect the island&#x27;s main airport, the Bima Airport, to Denpasar and Makassar.

<text>Terence Alan &quot;Spike&quot; Milligan (16 April 1918 – 27 February 2002) was an Irish comedian, writer, musician, poet, playwright and actor. The son of an English mother and Irish father, he was born in British India, where he spent his childhood before relocating in 1931 to England, where he lived and worked for the majority of his life. Disliking his first name, he began to call himself &quot;Spike&quot; after hearing the band Spike Jones and his City Slickers on Radio Luxembourg.

Milligan was the co-creator, main writer, and a principal cast member of the British radio comedy programme &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, performing a range of roles including the characters Eccles and Minnie Bannister. He was the earliest-born and last surviving member of the Goons. He took his success with &quot;The Goon Show&quot; into television with &quot;Q5&quot;, a surreal sketch show credited as a major influence on the members of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. 

He wrote and edited many books, including &quot;Puckoon&quot; (1963) and a seven-volume autobiographical account of his time serving during the Second World War, beginning with &quot;Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall&quot; (1971). He also wrote comical verse, with much of his poetry written for children, including &quot;Silly Verse for Kids&quot; (1959).

==Early life==
Terence Alan Milligan was born in Ahmednagar, India on 16 April 1918 during the British Raj, the son of an Irish father, Leo Alphonso Milligan, MSM, RA (1890–1969), a regimental sergeant-major in the British Indian Army, and English mother, Florence Mary Winifred (née Kettleband; 1893–1990). He spent his childhood in Poona and later in Rangoon, capital of British Burma. He was educated at the Convent of Jesus and Mary, Poona, and later at St Paul&#x27;s High School, Rangoon. His father remained in the Indian Army after the end of the First World War, steadily promoted till &quot;the family&#x27;s lifestyle became almost lavish&quot;; Milligan considered that &quot;My old man lived the life of a gentleman on sergeant&#x27;s pay&quot;.

After Army cuts meant his father&#x27;s position was no longer required, Milligan travelled by sea, from India to England for the first time. He arrived on a winter&#x27;s morning and was bemused by the climate, so different from India&#x27;s, remembering the dock&#x27;s &quot;terrible noise, and everything so cold and grey.&quot; The Milligan family lived in England in somewhat straitened circumstances, Leo Milligan only being able to find &quot;a poorly paid job in the Associated Press photo library&quot;; Milligan recalled his mother being &quot;often tense and angry... a domestic tyrant&quot; due to having to manage on &quot;next to no income&quot;. After moving to Brockley, south east London from the age of 12 in 1931, Milligan attended Brownhill Road School (later to be renamed Catford Boys School) and St Saviours School, Lewisham High Road.

After leaving school, he worked as a clerk in the Woolwich Arsenal, played the cornet and discovered jazz. He also joined the Young Communist League to demonstrate his hatred of Oswald Mosley&#x27;s British Union of Fascists, who were gaining support near his home in South London.

==Second World War==

During most of the late 1930s and early 1940s, Milligan performed as an amateur jazz vocalist, guitarist, and trumpeter before, during and after being called up for military service joining the Royal Artillery, in the fight against Nazi Germany, but even then he wrote and performed comedy sketches as part of concerts to entertain troops. After his call-up, but before being sent abroad, he and fellow musician Harry Edgington (1919–1993) (whose nickname &#x27;Edge-ying-Tong&#x27;, inspired one of Milligan&#x27;s most memorable musical creations, the &quot;Ying Tong Song&quot;) would compose surreal stories, filled with puns and skewed logic, as a way of staving off the boredom of life in barracks. A biographer describes his early dance band work: &quot;He managed to croon like Bing Crosby and win a competition: he also played drums, guitar and trumpet, in which he was entirely self taught&quot;. Milligan acquired a double bass, on which he took lessons and would pluck in jazz sessions. He had perfect pitch.

During the Second World War, Milligan served as a signaller in D Battery (later 19 Battery), 56th Heavy Regiment, Royal Artillery, as Gunner Milligan, 954024. The unit was equipped with the obsolete First World War era BL 9.2-inch howitzer and based in Bexhill on the south coast of England. Milligan describes training with these guns in part two of &quot;Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall&quot;, claiming that, during training, gun crews resorted to shouting &quot;bang&quot; in unison as they had no shells with which to practise.

The unit was later re-equipped with the BL 7.2-inch howitzer and saw action as part of the First Army in the North African campaign and then in the succeeding Italian campaign. Milligan was appointed lance bombardier and was about to be promoted to bombardier, when he was wounded in action in the Italian theatre at the Battle of Monte Cassino. Subsequently, hospitalised for a mortar wound to the right leg and shell shock, he was demoted by an unsympathetic commanding officer (identified in his war diaries as Major Evan &quot;Jumbo&quot; Jenkins) back to Gunner. It was Milligan&#x27;s opinion that Major Jenkins did not like him, because Milligan constantly kept up the morale of his fellow soldiers, whereas Jenkins&#x27;s approach was to take an attitude towards the troops similar to that of Lord Kitchener. An incident also mentioned was when Jenkins had invited Gunners Milligan and Edgington to his bivouac to play some jazz with him, only to discover that the musicianship of the gunners was far superior to his own ability to play &quot;Whistling Rufus&quot;.

After hospitalisation, Milligan drifted through a number of rear-echelon military jobs in Italy, eventually becoming a full-time entertainer. He played the guitar with a jazz and comedy group called &quot;The Bill Hall Trio&quot;, in concert parties for the troops. After being demobilised, Milligan remained in Italy playing with the trio but returned to Britain soon after. While he was with the Central Pool of Artists (a group he described as composed &quot;of bomb-happy squaddies&quot;) he began to write parodies of their mainstream plays, which displayed many of the key elements of what would later become &quot;The Goon Show&quot; (originally called &quot;Crazy People&quot;) with Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine.

==Career==
===&quot;The Goon Show&quot;===
Milligan returned to jazz in the late 1940s and made a precarious living with the Hall trio and other musical comedy acts. He was also trying to break into the world of radio, as a performer or script writer. His first success in radio was as writer for comedian Derek Roy&#x27;s show. After a delayed start, Milligan, Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine joined forces in a relatively radical comedy project, &quot;The Goon Show&quot;. During its first season the BBC titled the show as &quot;Crazy People&quot;, or in full, &quot;The Junior Crazy Gang featuring those Crazy People, the Goons&quot;, an attempt to make the programme palatable to BBC officials, by connecting it with the popular group of theatre comedians known as The Crazy Gang.

The first episode was broadcast on 28 May 1951 on the BBC Home Service. Although he did not perform as much in the early shows, Milligan eventually became a lead performer in almost all of the &quot;Goon Show&quot; episodes, portraying a wide range of characters including Eccles, Minnie Bannister, Jim Spriggs and the nefarious Count Moriarty. He was also the primary author of most of the scripts, although he co-wrote many scripts with various collaborators, most notably Larry Stephens and Eric Sykes. Most of the early shows were co-written with Stephens (and edited by Jimmy Grafton) but this partnership faltered after Series 3. Milligan wrote most of Series 4 but from Series 5 (coinciding with the birth of the Milligans&#x27; second child, Seán) and through most of Series 6, he collaborated with Eric Sykes, a development that grew out of his contemporary business collaboration with Sykes in Associated London Scripts. Milligan and Stephens reunited during Series 6 but towards the end of Series 8 Stephens was sidelined by health problems and Milligan worked briefly with John Antrobus. The Milligan-Stephens partnership was finally ended by Stephens&#x27; death from a brain haemorrhage in January 1959; Milligan later downplayed and disparaged Stephens&#x27; contributions.

&quot;The Goon Show&quot; was recorded before a studio audience and during the audience warm-up session, Milligan would play the trumpet, while Peter Sellers played on the orchestra&#x27;s drums. For the first few years the shows were recorded live, direct to 16-inch transcription disc, which required the cast to adhere closely to the script but by Series 4, the BBC had adopted the use of magnetic tape. Milligan eagerly exploited the possibilities the new technology offered—the tapes could be edited, so the cast could now ad-lib freely and tape also enabled the creation of groundbreaking sound effects. Over the first three series, Milligan&#x27;s demands for increasingly complex sound effects (or &quot;grams&quot;, as they were then known) pushed technology and the skills of the BBC engineers to their limits—effects had to be created mechanically (Foley) or played back from discs, sometimes requiring the use of four or five turntables running simultaneously. With magnetic tape, these effects could be produced in advance and the BBC engineers were able to create highly complex, tightly edited effects &quot;stings&quot; that would have been very difficult (if not impossible) to perform using Foley or disc. In the later years of the series many Goon Show &quot;grams&quot; were produced for the series by members of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, a notable example being the &quot;Major Bloodnok&#x27;s Stomach&quot; effect, realised by Dick Mills.

Although the Goons elevated Milligan to national stardom, the demands of writing and performing the series took a heavy toll. During Series 3 he had the first of several serious mental breakdowns, which also marked the onset of a decades-long cycle of manic-depressive illness. In late 1952, possibly exacerbated by suppressed tensions between the Goons&#x27; stars, Milligan apparently became irrationally convinced that he had to kill Sellers but when he attempted to gain entry to Sellers&#x27;s neighbouring flat, armed with a potato knife, he accidentally walked straight through the plate-glass front door. He was hospitalised, heavily sedated for two weeks and spent almost two months recuperating; fortunately for the show, a backlog of scripts meant that his illness had little effect on production. Milligan later blamed the pressure of writing and performing &quot;The Goon Show&quot; for both his breakdown and the failure of his first marriage.

Milligan was also involved in the writers&#x27; agency Associated London Scripts. Milligan married for the first time and began a family. This reportedly distracted him from writing so much that he accepted an invitation from Eric Sykes to share his small office, leading to the creation of the co-operative agency.

===Television===

Milligan made several forays into television as a writer-performer, in addition to his many guest appearances on interview, variety and sketch comedy series from the 1950s to the 2000s. &quot;The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d&quot; (1956), starring Peter Sellers, was the first attempt to translate Goons humour to TV; it was followed by &quot;A Show Called Fred&quot; and &quot;Son of Fred&quot;, both made during 1956 and directed by Richard Lester, who went on to work with the Beatles. During a visit to Australia in 1958, a similar special was made for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, &quot;The Gladys Half-Hour&quot;, which also featured local actors Ray Barrett and John Bluthal, who would appear in several later Milligan projects. In 1961, Milligan co-wrote two episodes of the popular sitcom &quot;Sykes and a...&quot;, co-starring Sykes and Hattie Jacques and the one-off &quot;Spike Milligan Offers a Series of Unrelated Incidents at Current Market Value&quot;.

The 15-minute series &quot;The Telegoons&quot; (1963), was the next attempt to transplant the Goons to television, this time using puppet versions of the familiar characters. The initial intention was to &quot;visualise&quot; original recordings of 1950s Goon Show episodes but this proved difficult, because of the rapid-fire dialogue and was ultimately frustrated by the BBC&#x27;s refusal to allow the original audio to be used. Fifteen-minute adaptations of the original scripts by Maurice Wiltshire were used instead, with Milligan, Sellers and Secombe reuniting to provide the voices; according to a contemporary press report, they received the highest fees the BBC had ever paid for 15-minute shows. Two series were made in 1963 and 1964 and (presumably because it was shot on 35mm film rather than video) the entire series has reportedly been preserved in the BBC archives.

Milligan&#x27;s next major TV venture was the sketch comedy series &quot;The World of Beachcomber&quot; (1968), made in colour for BBC 2; it is believed all 19 episodes are lost. In the same year, the three Goons reunited for a televised re-staging of a vintage &quot;Goon Show&quot; for Thames Television, with John Cleese substituting for the late Wallace Greenslade.

In early 1969, Milligan starred in brownface in the situation comedy &quot;Curry and Chips&quot;, created and written by Johnny Speight and featuring Milligan&#x27;s old friend and colleague Eric Sykes. &quot;Curry and Chips&quot; set out to satirise racist attitudes in Britain in a similar vein to Speight&#x27;s earlier creation, the hugely successful &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, with Milligan &#x27;browning up&#x27; to play Kevin O&#x27;Grady, a half-Pakistani–half-Irish factory worker. The series generated numerous complaints, because of its frequent use of racist epithets and &#x27;bad language&#x27;—one viewer reportedly complained of counting 59 uses of the word &quot;bloody&quot; in one episode—and it was cancelled on the orders of the Independent Broadcasting Authority after only six episodes. Milligan was also involved in the ill-fated programme &quot;The Melting Pot&quot;.

Director John Goldschmidt&#x27;s film &quot;The Other Spike&quot; dramatised Milligan&#x27;s nervous breakdown in a film for Granada Television, for which Milligan wrote the screenplay and in which he played himself. Later that year, he was commissioned by the BBC to write and star in &quot;Q5&quot;, the first in the innovative &quot;Q...&quot; TV series, acknowledged as an important precursor to &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, which premiered several months later. There was a hiatus of several years, before the BBC commissioned &quot;Q6&quot; in 1975. &quot;Q7&quot; appeared in 1977, &quot;Q8&quot; in 1978, &quot;Q9&quot; in 1980 and &quot;There&#x27;s a Lot of It About&quot; in 1982. Milligan later complained of the BBC&#x27;s cold attitude towards the series and stated that he would have made more programmes, had he been given the opportunity. A number of episodes of the earlier &quot;Q&quot; series are missing, presumed wiped.

Milligan&#x27;s daughter, Laura, conceived and co-wrote an animated series called &quot;The Ratties&quot; (1987). Milligan narrated the 26 five-minute episodes. He later voiced the highly successful animated series &quot;Wolves, Witches and Giants&quot;, which aired on ITV from 1995 to 1998. The series was written by Ed Welch, who had previously appeared in the &quot;Q&quot; series, and collaborated with Spike on several audio productions produced and directed by Simon &amp; Sara Bor. &quot;Wolves, Witches and Giants&quot; was broadcast in more than 100 territories, including Britain and the United States.

===Poetry and other writings===
Milligan also wrote verse, considered to be within the genre of literary nonsense. For example: &quot;It&#x27;s due to pigeons that alight; on Nelson&#x27;s hat that makes it white.&quot; His poetry has been described by comedian Stephen Fry as &quot;absolutely immortal—greatly in the tradition of Lear.&quot; One of his poems, &quot;On the Ning Nang Nong&quot;, was voted the UK&#x27;s favourite comic poem in 1998 in a nationwide poll, ahead of other nonsense poets including Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. This nonsense verse, set to music, became a favourite Australia-wide, performed week after week by the ABC children&#x27;s programme &quot;Playschool&quot;. Milligan included it on his album &quot;No One&#x27;s Gonna Change Our World&quot; in 1969, to aid the World Wildlife Fund. In December 2007 it was reported that, according to OFSTED, it is among the ten most commonly taught poems in primary schools in the UK.

While depressed, he wrote serious poetry, much of which is compiled in &quot;Open Heart University&quot;. He also wrote a novel &quot;Puckoon&quot; and a series of war memoirs, including &quot;Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall&quot; (1971), &quot;&quot;Rommel?&quot; &quot;Gunner Who?&quot;: A Confrontation in the Desert&quot; (1974), &quot;&quot; (1976) and &quot;&quot; (1978). Milligan&#x27;s seven volumes of memoirs cover the years from 1939 to 1950 (his call-up, war service, first breakdown, time spent entertaining in Italy and return to the UK).

Milligan also wrote comedy songs, including &quot;Purple Aeroplane&quot;, which was a parody of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. In addition he wrote the lyric to saxophonist/composer Duncan Lamont&#x27;s &quot;English Folk Song,&quot; heard on jazz singer Tina May&#x27;s 2021 album, &quot;52nd Street (and Other Tales)&quot;. He was the narrator for Lamont&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes Suite&quot;, commissioned by the City of London to commemorate the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes in &quot;The Strand&quot; magazine.

===Theatre===
====&quot;Treasure Island&quot;====
Bernard Miles gave Milligan his first straight acting role, as Ben Gunn, in the Mermaid Theatre production of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. Miles described Milligan as:

&quot;Treasure Island&quot; played twice daily through the winter of 1961–62 and was an annual production at the Mermaid Theatre for some years. In the 1968 production, Barry Humphries played the role of Long John Silver, alongside William Rushton as Squire Trelawney and Milligan as Ben Gunn. To Humphries, Milligan&#x27;s &quot;best performance must surely have been as Ben Gunn ..., Milligan stole the show every night, in a makeup which took at least an hour to apply. His appearance on stage always brought a roar of delight from the kids in the audience and Spike had soon left the text far behind as he went off into a riff of sublime absurdity.&quot;

====&quot;The Bedsitting Room&quot;====
In 1961–62, during the long pauses between the matinee and the evening show of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, Milligan began talking to Miles about the idea he and John Antrobus were exploring, of a dramatised post-nuclear world. This became the one-act play &quot;The Bedsitting Room&quot;, which Milligan co-wrote with John Antrobus and which premiered at the Marlowe Theatre, Canterbury on 12 February 1962. It was adapted to a longer play and staged by Miles at London&#x27;s Mermaid Theatre, making its debut on 31 January 1963. It was a critical and commercial success and was revived in 1967 with a provincial tour before opening at London&#x27;s Saville Theatre on 3 May 1967. Richard Lester later directed a film version, released in 1969.

====&quot;Oblomov&quot;====

Tiring of comedic roles, Milligan sought out more serious material. He had read Ivan Goncharov&#x27;s &quot;Oblomov&quot; and felt a kinship with the title character, who declines to leave his bed to face the world. According to Scudamore&#x27;s biography:

The novel had been adapted for the stage by Italian writer Riccardo Aragno. Aragno&#x27;s script for &quot;Oblomov&quot; was bought by Milligan&#x27;s production company in early 1964. Milligan had long nurtured hopes of transitioning from comedy to serious drama. To this end, Milligan rehearsed for seven weeks with director Frank Dunlop and castmates Joan Greenwood, Bill Owen, and Valentine Dyall at the Lyric Hammersmith.

The first preview was on 6 October 1964. During this performance Milligan was struck by stage fright and forgot nearly all of his lines. He quickly began making up things to say to the cast, turning the drama into an impromptu improv session. Noticing that a drama critic who&#x27;d given rave reviews to Milligan&#x27;s other stage comedies was in the audience, Milligan ended the first performance by shouting &quot;Thank God, Milton Shulman&#x27;s in!&quot;

The play was savaged in the theatrical press. However, &quot;Oblomov&quot; producers had booked the play into the Lyric for three weeks. Anxious to recoup their investment by any means, they gave Milligan carte-blanche on stage. Milligan&#x27;s antics included starting the play while sitting with the audience, yelling for his castmates to entertain him. Another night he wore a false arm that fell out of his sleeve when co-star Ian Flintoff, playing Oblomov&#x27;s doctor, shook Milligan&#x27;s hand. When Flintoff complained to Bill Kerr, a longtime friend of Milligan, that Spike was making a mockery of their hard work Kerr replied: &quot;We have to put up with all the shit, mate, because it pays the rent.&quot;

Joan Greenwood, who played Olga, later recalled that her husband André Morell thought the first performance was so appalling that they should get Greenwood out of her contract. According to Scudamore:

The play continued running as an improv comedy. The decision soon caused it to break all box office records at the Lyric. After five weeks it was rechristened &quot;Son of Oblomov&quot; and moved on 2 December 1964 to the Comedy Theatre in the West End. It would run there for a total of 559 performances. As the play was substantially new each night it drew record numbers of repeat traffic.

On 22 April 1965, Queen Elizabeth and her family attended as part of her 39th birthday celebration. Just after the curtain rose, a group of four latecomers attempted to slink to their seats directly in front of the royal family. Milligan immediately shouted: &quot;Turn up the house lights! Start everything again!&quot; He pointed to the blushing foursome and cried: &quot;That&#x27;s cost you your knighthood!&quot;

Then, noticing that Peter Sellers was seated between Prince Charles and Princess Margaret, Milligan asked in a loud voice: &quot;Is there a Sellers in the house?&quot; Sellers immediately shouted, &quot;Yes!&quot; Milligan launched into a vaudeville routine about Prince Philip&#x27;s suspenders, with Sellers participating from his seat with the royals. This culminated in Milligan giving a high-kick, lobbing one of his bedroom slippers at Sellers, only just missing Prince Philip&#x27;s head. Once back in bed with co-star Joan Greenwood, Milligan spent the rest of the performance poking fun at the Queen for bringing her son to such a racy play. The play ended with Milligan unsheathing a katana on stage and asking the Queen to knight him for his efforts that night. She declined. The performance ran 45 minutes over its scheduled ending. Prince Charles reportedly saw the play five times.

In a 1988 interview with Bernard Braden, Milligan described theatre as being important to him:

===Ken Russell films===
In 1959 Ken Russell made a short 35 mm film about and with Milligan entitled &quot;Portrait of a Goon&quot;. The making of the film is detailed in Paul Sutton&#x27;s 2012 authorised biography &quot;Becoming Ken Russell&quot;. In 1971 Milligan played a humble village priest in Russell&#x27;s film &quot;The Devils&quot;. The scene was cut from the release print and is considered lost but photographs from the scene, together with Murray Melvin&#x27;s memory of that day&#x27;s filming, are included in Sutton&#x27;s 2014 book &quot;Six English Filmmakers&quot;.

===Ad-libbing===
As illustrated in the description of his involvement in theatre, Milligan often ad-libbed. He also did this on radio and television. One of his last screen appearances was in the BBC dramatisation of Mervyn Peake&#x27;s &quot;Gormenghast&quot; and he was (almost inevitably) noted as an ad-libber.

One of Milligan&#x27;s ad-lib incidents occurred during a visit to Australia in the late 1960s. He was interviewed live on air and remained in the studio for the news broadcast that followed (read by Rod McNeil), during which Milligan constantly interjected, adding his own name to news items. As a result, he was banned from making any further live appearances on the ABC. The ABC also changed its national policy so that guests had to leave the studio after interviews were complete. A tape of the bulletin survives and has been included in an ABC Radio audio compilation, and also on the BBC tribute CD, &quot;Vivat Milligna&quot;.

Film and television director Richard Lester recalls that the television series &quot;A Show Called Fred&quot; was broadcast live. &quot;I&#x27;ve seen very few moments of genius in my life but I witnessed one with Spike after the first show. He had brought around a silent cartoon&quot; and asked Lester if his P.A. took shorthand. &quot;She said she did. &#x27;Good, this needs a commentary.&#x27; It was a ten-minute cartoon and Spike could have seen it only once, if that. He ad-libbed the commentary for it and it was perfect. I was open-mouthed at the raw comedy creation in front of me.&quot;

===Cartoons and art===
Milligan contributed occasional cartoons to the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;. Most were visualisations of one-line jokes. For example, a young boy sees the Concorde and asks his father &quot;What&#x27;s that?&quot;. The reply is &quot;That&#x27;s a flying groundnut scheme, son.&quot; Milligan was a keen painter.

In 1967, applying a satirical angle to a fashion for the inclusion of Superman-inspired characters in British television commercials, Milligan dressed up in a &quot;Bat-Goons&quot; outfit, to appear in a series of television commercials for BP. A contemporary reporter found the TV commercials &quot;funny and effective&quot;. Milligan appeared with Peter Sellers in an advert for Benson &amp; Hedges in 1973. Milligan requested that his fee was paid to ASH: Action on Smoking and Health. When this was refused, he gave the money to charity instead. The advert was popular with the public and also won several industry awards. From 1980 to 1982, he advertised for the English Tourist Board, playing a Scotsman on a visit around the different regions of England.

Other advertising appearances included television commercials for Kellogg&#x27;s Corn Flakes, the Leyland Mini, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Planters nuts.

===Other contributions===
In the 1970s, Charles Allen compiled a series of stories from British people&#x27;s experiences of life in the British Raj, called &quot;Plain Tales from the Raj&quot;, and published in 1975. Milligan was the youngest contributor, describing his life in India when it was under British rule. In it he mentions the imperial parades there:

===Music composition===
In 1988, while visiting his mother in Woy Woy (on the shores of Brisbane Water), Milligan composed and orchestrated a &quot;Grand Waltz for Brisbane Water&quot; and gave it to the symphony orchestra of nearby Gosford. Symphony Central Coast has performed it occasionally since, including a 2020 YouTube video as a COVID-19 isolation project.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Milligan married his first wife, June (Marchinie) Marlow, in 1952; Peter Sellers was best man. They had three children, Laura, Seán and Síle, and divorced in 1960.

He married Patricia Ridgeway (also known as Paddy) in June 1962, with George Martin as best man and the marriage produced one child, Jane Milligan (b. 1966). The marriage ended with Patricia&#x27;s death from breast cancer in 1978.
He reportedly had two children by other mothers.

His last wife was Shelagh Sinclair, to whom he was married from 1983 until his death on 27 February 2002. Shelagh, who was 25 years younger than Milligan, died in June 2011. Upon marrying Shelagh, Milligan made a new will which left his entire estate to his wife. The children unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the will. A High Court judge ruled that Shelagh was entitled to his whole estate, and his children should receive only “what was surplus to requirements”.

Four of his children collaborated with documentary makers on a multi-platform programme called &quot;I Told You I Was Ill: The Life and Legacy of Spike Milligan&quot; (2005). 

In October 2008, an array of Milligan&#x27;s personal effects was sold at auction by Shelagh, who was moving into a smaller home. These included his vast legacy of books and memorabilia and a grand piano salvaged from a demolition and apparently played every morning by Paul McCartney, a neighbour in Rye in East Sussex. His children were distressed by the sale.

===Health===
He had bipolar disorder for most of his life, having a number of serious mental breakdowns, several lasting over a year. He spoke candidly about his condition and its effect on his life:

===Nationality===
Milligan was born in the British Empire to an English mother and felt that he was thus entitled to British citizenship, especially after having served in the British Army for six years. When British law related to Commonwealth-born residents (which had given him a secure place in the UK) changed, he applied for a British passport in 1960. The application was refused, partly because he would not swear an Oath of Allegiance. Through his Irish father, he avoided statelessness by becoming an Irish citizen in 1962 and remained so for the rest of his life; this status gave him almost the same rights as a British citizen.

===Religion===
Milligan was agnostic, saying that he &quot;sometimes prayed in moments of desperation on the off chance that somebody might be listening, but he always felt that he was talking to a void&quot;. Milligan was raised Catholic and expressed the view that &quot;someone raised a Catholic was always a Catholic&quot;, referring to himself as a Catholic throughout his life.

===Legal issues===
In 1974 Milligan was arrested for shooting a trespasser with an air rifle. He defended himself in court and was given a conditional discharge.

==Humour with the Prince of Wales==
Charles III (then the Prince of Wales) was a fan of Milligan. When Milligan received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the British Comedy Awards in 1994, the prince sent a congratulatory message to be read out on live television. The comedian interrupted the message to call the prince a &quot;little grovelling bastard&quot;. He later faxed the prince, saying: &quot;I suppose a knighthood is out of the question?&quot;

In reality, he and the prince were very close friends, and Milligan had already been made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1992 (honorary because of his Irish citizenship). He was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 2001.

On 23 July 1981, the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer were presented with a poem about the forthcoming Royal Wedding, delivered to Buckingham Palace on a 3-foot-9-inch parchment scroll, written under the pen name MacGoonical. A ridiculous verse written in the style of William McGonagall, the ode was commissioned by the Legal and General Assurance society as a &quot;mark of esteem and affection&quot;. The verse, titled &quot;Ode to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales on the occasion of his Weeding&quot;, begins:

==Campaigning==
He was a strident campaigner on environmental matters, particularly arguing against unnecessary noise, such as the use of &quot;muzak&quot;.

In 1971, Milligan caused controversy by attacking an art exhibition at the Hayward Gallery with a hammer. The artwork included catfish, oysters, and shrimp that were to be electrocuted. He was a staunch and outspoken opponent of the scourge of domestic violence, dedicating one of his books to Erin Pizzey.

==Death==

Even late in life, Milligan&#x27;s black humour had not deserted him. In 1980, during the funeral of Peter Sellers, he quipped to Harry Secombe, &quot;I&#x27;m hope you die before me, because I don&#x27;t want you to sing at my funeral.&quot; (A recording of Secombe singing was played at Milligan&#x27;s memorial service.) In 1990, he also wrote his own obituary, in which he stated repeatedly that he &quot;wrote the &quot;Goon Show&quot; and died&quot;.

Milligan died from kidney failure, at the age of 83, on 27 February 2002, at his home on Dumb Woman&#x27;s Lane near Rye, Sussex. On the day of his funeral, 8 March 2002, his coffin was carried to St Thomas Church in Winchelsea, East Sussex, and was draped in the flag of Ireland. He had once quipped that he wanted his headstone to bear the words: &quot;I told you I was ill.&quot; He was buried at St Thomas&#x27; churchyard but the Chichester diocese refused to allow this epitaph. A compromise was reached with the Gaelic translation of &quot;I told you I was ill&quot;, , and in English, &quot;Love, light, peace&quot;. The additional epitaph can be read as &quot;Great love for you Shelagh&quot;.

According to a letter published in the &quot;Rye and Battle Observer&quot; in 2011, Milligan&#x27;s headstone was removed from St Thomas&#x27; churchyard in Winchelsea and moved to be alongside the grave of his wife, but was later returned.

==Legacy==

From the 1960s, Milligan was a regular correspondent with Robert Graves. Milligan&#x27;s letters to Graves usually addressed a question to do with classical studies. The letters form part of Graves&#x27;s bequest to St John&#x27;s College, Oxford.

The film of &quot;Puckoon&quot;, starring Sean Hughes, including Milligan&#x27;s daughter, actress Jane Milligan, was released after his death.

Milligan lived for several years in Holden Road, Woodside Park, Finchley, at The Crescent, Barnet, and was a contributing founder and strong supporter of the Finchley Society. His old house in Woodside Park is now demolished but there is a blue plaque in his memory on the block of flats on the site.

A memorial bench featuring a bronze likeness of Milligan sits in his former home of Finchley. Over ten years the Finchley Society, led by friend and local resident Barbara Warren, raised funds—the Spike Milligan Statue Fund—to commission a statue of him by local sculptor John Somerville and erected in the grounds of Avenue House in East End Road. The memorial was unveiled on 4 September 2014 at a ceremony attended by a number of local dignitaries and showbusiness celebrities including Roy Hudd, Michael Parkinson, Maureen Lipman, Terry Gilliam, Kathy Lette, Denis Norden and Lynsey de Paul.

There is a campaign to erect a statue in the London Borough of Lewisham where he grew up. After coming to the UK from India in the 1930s, he lived at 50 Riseldine Road, Brockley and attended Brownhill Boys&#x27; School (later Catford Boys&#x27; School, which was demolished in 1994). There is a plaque and bench located at the Wadestown Library, Wellington, New Zealand, in an area called &quot;Spike Milligan Corner&quot;.

In a 2005 poll to find the &quot;Comedians&#x27; Comedian&quot;, he was voted among the top 50 comedy acts, by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. In a BBC poll in August 1999, Milligan was voted the &quot;funniest person of the last 1,000 years&quot;.

Milligan has been portrayed twice in films. In the adaptation of his novel &quot;Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall&quot;, he was played by Jim Dale, while Milligan played his father. He was portrayed by Edward Tudor-Pole in &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot; (2004). In a 2008 stage play, &quot;Surviving Spike&quot;, Milligan was played by Michael Barrymore.

On 9 June 2006, it was reported that Richard Wiseman had identified Milligan as the writer of the world&#x27;s funniest joke as decided by the Laughlab project. Wiseman said the joke contained all three elements of what makes a good gag: anxiety, a feeling of superiority and an element of surprise.

Eddie Izzard described Milligan as &quot;The Godfather of Alternative Comedy&quot;. &quot;From his unchained mind came forth ideas that just had no boundaries. And he influenced a new generation of comedians who came to be known as &#x27;alternative&#x27;.&quot;

Members of Monty Python greatly admired him. In one interview, which was widely quoted at the time, John Cleese stated &quot;Milligan is the Great God to all of us&quot;. The Pythons gave Milligan a cameo role in their 1979 film &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;, when Milligan happened to be holidaying in Tunisia, near where the film was being shot; he was re-visiting where he had been stationed during wartime. Graham Chapman gave him a minor part in &quot;Yellowbeard&quot;.

After their retirement, Milligan&#x27;s parents and his younger brother Desmond moved to Australia. His mother lived the rest of her long life in the coastal town of Woy Woy on the New South Wales Central Coast, just north of Sydney. As a result, he became a regular visitor to Australia and made a number of radio and TV programmes there, including &quot;The Idiot Weekly&quot; with Bobby Limb. He also wrote several books including &quot;Puckoon&quot; during a visit to his mother&#x27;s house in Woy Woy. Milligan named the town &quot;the largest above-ground cemetery in the world&quot; when visiting in the 1960s.

Milligan&#x27;s mother became an Australian citizen in 1985, partly in protest at the circumstances which led to her son&#x27;s ineligibility for British citizenship; Milligan himself was reportedly considering applying for Australian citizenship at the time as well. The suspension bridge on the cyclepath from Woy Woy to Gosford was renamed the Spike Milligan Bridge in his memory, and a meeting room in the Woy Woy Public Library is also named after him.

Unsure of his material, on the opening night he improvised a great deal, treating the audience as part of the plot almost, and he continued in this manner for the rest of the run, and on tour as &#x27;Son of Oblomov&#x27;. The show ran at the Comedy Theatre in London&#x27;s West End in 1965.
*&quot;Badjelly&#x27;s Bad Christmas&quot; was a play created and performed by the Chickenshed Theatre Company using the works of Spike Milligan and his characters.

<doc id="28699" wikidata="Q133054" url="?curid=28699" title="Sylvia Plath">
<text>Sylvia Plath (; October 27, 1932 – February 11, 1963) was an American poet and author. She is credited with advancing the genre of confessional poetry and is best known for &quot;The Colossus and Other Poems&quot; (1960), &quot;Ariel&quot; (1965), and &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, a semi-autobiographical novel published shortly before her suicide in 1963. &quot;The Collected Poems&quot; was published in 1981, which included previously unpublished works. For this collection Plath was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in Poetry in 1982, making her the fourth to receive this honor posthumously.

Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Plath graduated from Smith College in Massachusetts and the University of Cambridge, England, where she was a student at Newnham College. Plath later studied with Robert Lowell at Boston University, alongside poets Anne Sexton and George Starbuck. She married fellow poet Ted Hughes in 1956, and they lived together in the United States and then in England. Their relationship was tumultuous and, in her letters, Plath alleges abuse at his hands. They had two children before separating in 1962.

Plath was clinically depressed for most of her adult life and was treated multiple times with early versions of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). She took her own life in 1963.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Plath was born on October 27, 1932, in Boston, Massachusetts. Her mother, Aurelia Schober Plath (1906–1994), was the American-born daughter of Austrian immigrants, and her father, Otto Plath (1885–1940), was from Grabow, Germany. Plath&#x27;s father was an entomologist and a professor of biology at Boston University who wrote a book about bumblebees in 1934.

On April 27, 1935, Plath&#x27;s brother Warren was born. In 1936 the family moved from 24 Prince Street in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, to 92 Johnson Avenue, Winthrop, Massachusetts. Since 1920, Plath&#x27;s maternal grandparents, the Schobers, had lived in a section of Winthrop called Point Shirley, a location mentioned in Plath&#x27;s poetry.

Otto Plath died on November 5, 1940, a week and a half after Sylvia&#x27;s eighth birthday, of complications following the amputation of a foot due to untreated diabetes. He had become ill shortly after a close friend died of lung cancer. Comparing the similarities between his friend&#x27;s symptoms and his own, Otto became convinced that he, too, had lung cancer and did not seek treatment until his diabetes had progressed too far. Raised as a Unitarian, Plath experienced a loss of faith after her father&#x27;s death and remained ambivalent about religion throughout her life. Her father was buried in Winthrop Cemetery in Massachusetts. A visit to her father&#x27;s grave later prompted Plath to write the poem &quot;Electra on Azalea Path&quot;.

After Otto&#x27;s death, Aurelia moved her children and her parents to 26 Elmwood Road, Wellesley, Massachusetts, in 1942. Plath commented in &quot;Ocean 1212-W&quot;, one of her final works, that her first nine years &quot;sealed themselves off like a ship in a bottle—beautiful, inaccessible, obsolete, a fine, white flying myth&quot;.

Plath published her first poem at the age of eight in the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;″s children&#x27;s section. Over the next few years, Plath published multiple poems in regional magazines and newspapers. At age 11, Plath began keeping a journal. In addition to writing, she showed early promise as an artist, winning an award for her paintings from the Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards in 1947. &quot;Even in her youth, Plath was ambitiously driven to succeed.&quot;

Plath attended Bradford Senior High School, which is now Wellesley High School in Wellesley, Massachusetts, graduating in 1950. Just after graduating from high school, she had her first national publication in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor.&quot;

===College years and depression===

In 1950, Plath attended Smith College, a private women&#x27;s liberal arts college in Massachusetts, where she excelled academically. While at Smith, she lived in Lawrence House, and a plaque can be found outside her old room. She edited &quot;The Smith Review.&quot; After her third year of college, Plath was awarded a coveted position as a guest editor at &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; magazine, during which she spent a month in New York City. The experience was not what she had hoped for, and many of the events that took place during that summer were later used as inspiration for her novel &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;.

She was furious at not being at a meeting that &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; editor Cyrilly Abels had arranged with Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, a writer whose work she loved, according to one of her boyfriends, &quot;more than life itself&quot;. She loitered around the White Horse Tavern and the Chelsea Hotel for two days, hoping to meet Thomas, but he was already on his way home. A few weeks later, she slashed her legs &quot;to see if she had enough courage to kill herself.&quot; During this time, she was not accepted into a Harvard University writing seminar with author Frank O&#x27;Connor. Following ECT for depression, Plath made her first medically documented suicide attempt on August 24, 1953, by crawling under the front porch and taking her mother&#x27;s sleeping pills.

She survived this first suicide attempt, later writing that she &quot;blissfully succumbed to the whirling blackness that I honestly believed was eternal oblivion&quot;. She spent the next six months in psychiatric care, receiving more electric and insulin shock treatment under the care of Ruth Beuscher. Her stay at McLean Hospital and her Smith scholarship were paid for by the author Olive Higgins Prouty, who had also recovered from a mental breakdown. According to Plath&#x27;s biographer Andrew Wilson, Olive Higgins Prouty &quot;would take Dr Tillotson to task for the badly managed ECT, blaming him for Sylvia&#x27;s suicide attempt&quot;.
Plath seemed to make a good recovery and returned to college. In January 1955, she submitted her thesis &quot;The Magic Mirror: A Study of the Double in Two of Dostoyevsky&#x27;s Novels&quot;, and in June graduated from Smith with an A.B., &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. She was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society, and had an IQ of around 160.

She obtained a Fulbright Scholarship to study at Newnham College, one of the two women-only colleges of the University of Cambridge in England, where she continued actively writing poetry and publishing her work in the student newspaper &quot;Varsity&quot;. At Newnham, she studied with Dorothea Krook, whom she held in high regard. She spent her first-year winter and spring holidays traveling around Europe.

===Career and marriage===
Plath met poet Ted Hughes on February 25, 1956. In a 1961 BBC interview now held by the British Library Sound Archive, Plath describes how she met Hughes:
 Plath described Hughes as &quot;a singer, story-teller, lion and world-wanderer&quot; with &quot;a voice like the thunder of God&quot;.

The couple married on June 16, 1956, at St George&#x27;s, Bloomsbury, with Plath&#x27;s mother as the sole witness. They spent their honeymoon in Paris and Benidorm, Spain. Plath returned to Newnham in October to begin her second year. During this time, they both became deeply interested in astrology and the supernatural, using ouija boards.

In June 1957, Plath and Hughes moved to the United States; beginning in September, Plath taught at Smith College, her alma mater. She found it difficult to both teach and have enough time and energy to write, and in the middle of 1958, the couple moved to Boston. Plath took a job as a receptionist in the psychiatric unit of Massachusetts General Hospital and in the evenings sat in on creative writing seminars given by poet Robert Lowell (also attended by the writers Anne Sexton and George Starbuck).

Both Lowell and Sexton encouraged Plath to write from her personal experience. She openly discussed her depression with Lowell and her suicide attempt with Sexton, who led her to write from a more female perspective. Plath began to consider herself as a more serious, focused writer. At this time Plath and Hughes met the poet W.S. Merwin, who admired their work and was to remain a lifelong friend. Plath resumed psychoanalytic treatment in December, working with Ruth Beuscher.
Plath and Hughes traveled across Canada and the United States, staying at the Yaddo artist colony in Saratoga Springs, New York, in late 1959. Plath stated that at Yaddo she learned &quot;to be true to my own weirdnesses&quot;, but she remained anxious about writing confessionally, from deeply personal and private material.

The couple moved back to England in December 1959 and lived in London at 3 Chalcot Square, near the Primrose Hill area of Regent&#x27;s Park, where an English Heritage plaque records Plath&#x27;s residence. Their daughter Frieda was born on April 1, 1960, and in October, Plath published &quot;The Colossus&quot;, her first collection of poetry.

In February 1961, Plath&#x27;s second pregnancy ended in miscarriage; several of her poems, including &quot;Parliament Hill Fields&quot;, address this event. In a letter to her therapist, Plath wrote that Hughes beat her two days before the miscarriage. In August she finished her semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;; immediately afterwards, the family moved to Court Green in the small market town of North Tawton. Nicholas was born in January 1962. In mid-1962, Plath and Hughes began to keep bees, which would be the subject of many Plath poems.

In August 1961, the couple rented their flat at Chalcot Square to Assia (née Gutmann) Wevill and David Wevill. Hughes was immediately struck with Assia, as she was with him. In June 1962, Plath had a car accident, which she later described as a suicide attempt. In July 1962 Plath discovered Hughes was having an affair with Wevill; in September, Plath and Hughes separated.

Beginning in October 1962, Plath experienced a great burst of creativity and composed most of the poems on which her reputation now rests, writing at least 26 of the poems of her posthumous collection &quot;Ariel&quot; during the final months of her life. In December 1962, she returned alone to London with their children and rented, on a five-year lease, a flat at 23 Fitzroy Road—only a few streets from the Chalcot Square flat. William Butler Yeats once lived in the house, which bears an English Heritage blue plaque for the Irish poet. Plath was pleased by this fact and considered it a good omen.

The winter of 1962–1963 was one of the coldest on record in the UK; the pipes froze, the children—now two years old and nine months—were often sick, and the house had no telephone. Her depression returned but she completed the rest of her poetry collection, which would be published after her death (1965 in the UK, 1966 in the US). Her only novel, &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, was published in January 1963 under the pen name Victoria Lucas and was met with critical indifference.

===Final depressive episode and death===
Before her death, Plath tried at least twice to take her own life. On August 24, 1953, she overdosed on sleeping pills; then, in June 1962, she drove her car off the side of the road into a river, which she later characterized as a suicide attempt.

In January 1963, Plath spoke with John Horder, her general practitioner. She described the current depressive episode she was experiencing; it had been ongoing for six or seven months. While for most of the time she had been able to continue working, her depression had worsened and become severe, &quot;marked by constant agitation, suicidal thoughts and inability to cope with daily life.&quot; Plath struggled with insomnia, taking medication at night to induce sleep, and frequently woke up early. She had lost 20 pounds (9 kg) in a short time. However, she continued to take care of her physical appearance and did not outwardly speak of feeling guilty or unworthy.

Horder prescribed her an anti-depressant, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, a few days before her suicide. Knowing she was at risk with two young children, he made strenuous efforts to have her admitted to a hospital; when that failed, he arranged for a live-in nurse.

Hughes claimed in a hand-written note to the literary critic Keith Sagar, discovered in 2001, that the anti-depressants prescribed were a &quot;key factor&quot; in Plath&#x27;s suicide. He said Plath had previously had an adverse reaction to a prescription she had taken when they lived in the U.S. These pills were sold in England under a different name, and although Hughes did not name the pills explicitly, he claimed a new doctor had prescribed them to Plath without realizing she had taken them before with adverse effects. Several commentators have argued that because anti-depressants may take up to three weeks to take effect, her prescription from Horder would not have taken full effect prior to her death; however, others have pointed out that adverse effects of anti-depressants can begin immediately.

The live-in nurse was due to arrive at nine on the morning of February 11, 1963, to help Plath with the care of her children. Upon arrival, she could not get into the flat but eventually gained access with the help of a workman. They found Plath dead with her head in the oven, having sealed the rooms between her and her sleeping children with tape, towels, and cloths. She was 30years old.

Plath&#x27;s intentions have been debated. That morning, she asked her downstairs neighbor, art historian Trevor Thomas (1907–1993), what time he would be leaving. She also left a note reading &quot;Call Dr. Horder&quot;, including the doctor&#x27;s phone number. It is argued Plath turned on the gas at a time when Thomas would have been likely to see the note, but the escaping gas seeped downstairs and also rendered Thomas unconscious while he slept. However, in her biography &quot;Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath&quot;, Plath&#x27;s friend Jillian Becker wrote, &quot;According to Mr. Goodchild, a police officer attached to the coroner&#x27;s office... [Plath] had thrust her head far into the gas oven... [and] had really meant to die.&quot; Horder also believed her intention was clear. He stated that &quot;No one who saw the care with which the kitchen was prepared could have interpreted her action as anything but an irrational compulsion.&quot; Plath had described the quality of her despair as &quot;owl&#x27;s talons clenching my heart&quot;.

===Aftermath===
An inquest was held on February 15 and concluded that the cause of death was suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. Hughes was devastated; they had been separated for six months, due to his affair with Assia Wevill. In a letter to an old friend of Plath&#x27;s from Smith College, he wrote: &quot;That&#x27;s the end of my life. The rest is posthumous.&quot; Wevill also commited suicide, using a gas stove, six years later.

Plath&#x27;s gravestone in Heptonstall&#x27;s parish churchyard of St. Thomas the Apostle bears the inscription that Hughes chose for her: &quot;Even amidst fierce flames the golden lotus can be planted.&quot; Biographers have attributed the source of the quote either to the Hindu text &quot;The Bhagavad Gita&quot; or to the 16th-century Buddhist novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot; written by Wu Cheng&#x27;en.

Eight years after the death of Plath, Al Alvarez (a friend of Plath and Hughes between 1960 and 1963) wrote that Plath&#x27;s suicide was an unanswered cry for help. This prompted an angry response from Hughes who demanded that this claim be withdrawn from wider publication. In a BBC interview in March 2000, Alvarez spoke about his failure to recognize Plath&#x27;s depression, saying he regretted his inability to offer her emotional support.

Plath&#x27;s daughter Frieda Hughes is a writer and artist. On March 16, 2009, Plath&#x27;s son Nicholas Hughes committed suicide at his home in Fairbanks, Alaska, following a history of depression.

==Works==

Plath wrote poetry from the age of 8, her first poem appearing in the &quot;Boston Traveller&quot;. By the time she arrived at Smith College, she had written over 50 short stories, and her work had been published in numerous magazines. At Smith, she majored in English literature and won all the major prizes in writing and scholarship, including literary prizes for her poetry. Additionally, she received a summer editor position at the young women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;. On her graduation in 1955, she won the Glascock Prize for &quot;Two Lovers and a Beachcomber by the Real Sea&quot;. Later, at Cambridge, she wrote for the university publication &quot;Varsity&quot;.

===&quot;The Colossus&quot;===

By the time Heinemann published her first collection, &quot;The Colossus and Other Poems&quot; in the UK in late 1960, Plath had been short-listed several times in the Yale Younger Poets book competition and had her work printed in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot; and &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. All the poems in &quot;The Colossus&quot; had been printed in major U.S. and British journals, and she had a contract with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. It was, however, her 1965 collection &quot;Ariel&quot;, published posthumously, on which Plath&#x27;s reputation essentially rests. &quot;Often, her work is singled out for the intense coupling of its violent or disturbed imagery and its playful use of alliteration and rhyme.&quot;

&quot;The Colossus&quot; received largely positive UK reviews, highlighting Plath&#x27;s voice as new and strong, individual and American in tone. Peter Dickinson at &quot;Punch&quot; called the collection &quot;a real find&quot; and &quot;exhilarating to read&quot;, full of &quot;clean, easy verse&quot;. Bernard Bergonzi at the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; wrote the book was an &quot;outstanding technical accomplishment&quot; with a &quot;virtuoso quality&quot;. From the point of publication, she became a presence on the poetry scene. The book was published in America in 1962 to less-glowing reviews. While her craft was generally praised, her writing was viewed by some critics at the time as more derivative of other poets.

===&quot;The Bell Jar&quot;===

Plath&#x27;s semi-autobiographical novel—her mother wanted to block publication—was published in 1963 and in the US in 1971. Describing the compilation of the book to her mother, she wrote, &quot;What I&#x27;ve done is to throw together events from my own life, fictionalizing to add color—it&#x27;s a pot boiler really, but I think it will show how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a breakdown... I&#x27;ve tried to picture my world and the people in it as seen through the distorting lens of a bell jar&quot;. She described her novel as &quot;an autobiographical apprentice work which I had to write in order to free myself from the past&quot;. Plath dated a Yale senior named Dick Norton during her junior year. Norton, upon whom the character of Buddy in &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is based, contracted tuberculosis and was treated at the Ray Brook Sanatorium. While visiting Norton, Plath broke her leg skiing, an incident that was fictionalized in the novel. Plath also used the novel to highlight the issue of women in the workforce during the 1950s. She strongly believed in women&#x27;s abilities to be writers and editors while society forced them to fulfill secretarial roles: Now with me, writing is the first delight in life. I want time and money to write, both very necessary. I will not sacrifice my time to learn shorthand because I do not want any of the jobs which shorthand would open up, although those jobs are no doubt very interesting for girls who want them. I do not want the rigid hours of a magazine or publishing job. I do not want to type other people&#x27;s letters and read their manuscripts. I want to type my own and write my own. So secretarial training is out for me. That I know. (Sylvia Plath&#x27;s letter to her mother, 10 Feb 1955)

=== &quot;Double Exposure&quot; ===
In 1963, after &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; was published, Plath began working on another literary work, titled &quot;Double Exposure&quot;, which was never published. According to Ted Hughes in 1979, Plath left behind a typescript of &quot;some 130 pages&quot;, but in 1995 he spoke of just &quot;sixty, seventy pages&quot;. Olwyn Hughes wrote in 2003 that the typescript may have consisted of the first two chapters, and did not exceed sixty pages.

===&quot;Ariel&quot;===


The posthumous publication of &quot;Ariel&quot; in 1965 precipitated Plath&#x27;s rise to fame. The poems in &quot;Ariel&quot; mark a departure from her earlier work into a more personal arena of poetry. Robert Lowell&#x27;s poetry may have played a part in this shift as she cited Lowell&#x27;s 1959 book &quot;Life Studies&quot; as a significant influence, in an interview just before her death. The impact of &quot;Ariel&quot; was dramatic, with its dark and potentially autobiographical descriptions of mental illness in poems such as &quot;Tulips&quot;, &quot;Daddy&quot; and &quot;Lady Lazarus&quot;. Plath&#x27;s work is often held within the genre of confessional poetry and the style of her work compared to other contemporaries, such as Lowell and W.D. Snodgrass. Plath&#x27;s close friend Al Alvarez, who wrote about her extensively, said of her later work: &quot;Plath&#x27;s case is complicated by the fact that, in her mature work, she deliberately used the details of her everyday life as raw material for her art. A casual visitor or unexpected telephone call, a cut, a bruise, a kitchen bowl, a candlestick—everything became usable, charged with meaning, transformed. Her poems are full of references and images that seem impenetrable at this distance, but which could mostly be explained in footnotes by a scholar with full access to the details of her life.&quot; Many of Plath&#x27;s later poems deal with what one critic calls the &quot;domestic surreal&quot; in which Plath takes everyday elements of life and twists the images, giving them an almost nightmarish quality. Plath&#x27;s poem &quot;Morning Song&quot; from &quot;Ariel&quot; is regarded as one of her finest poems on &quot;freedom of expression&quot; of an artist.

Plath&#x27;s fellow confessional poet and friend Anne Sexton commented: &quot;Sylvia and I would talk at length about our first suicide, in detail and in depth—between the free potato chips. Suicide is, after all, the opposite of the poem. Sylvia and I often talked opposites. We talked death with burned-up intensity, both of us drawn to it like moths to an electric lightbulb, sucking on it. She told the story of her first suicide in sweet and loving detail, and her description in &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is just that same story.&quot; The confessional interpretation of Plath&#x27;s work has led to some dismissing certain aspects of her work as an exposition of sentimentalist melodrama; in 2010, for example, Theodore Dalrymple asserted that Plath had been the &quot;patron saint of self-dramatisation&quot; and of self-pity. Revisionist critics such as Tracy Brain have, however, argued against a tightly autobiographical interpretation of Plath&#x27;s material. On January 16, 2004, The Independent newspaper in London published an article that ranked &quot;Ariel&quot; as the 3rd best book of modern poetry among &#x27;The 10 Best Modern Poetry Books.&#x27;

===Other works===
In 1971, the volumes &quot;Winter Trees&quot; and &quot;Crossing the Water&quot; were published in the UK, including nine previously unseen poems from the original manuscript of &quot;Ariel&quot;. Writing in &quot;New Statesman&quot;, fellow poet Peter Porter wrote:
The &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, published in 1981, edited and introduced by Ted Hughes, contained poetry written from 1956 until her death. Plath posthumously was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. In 2006, Anna Journey, then a graduate student at Virginia Commonwealth University, discovered a previously unpublished sonnet written by Plath titled &quot;Ennui&quot;. The poem, composed during Plath&#x27;s early years at Smith College, was published in the online journal &quot;Blackbird&quot;.

===Journals and letters===
Plath&#x27;s letters were published in 1975, edited and selected by her mother Aurelia Plath. The collection &quot;Letters Home: Correspondence 1950–1963&quot; came out partly in response to the strong public reaction to the publication of &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; in America. Plath started writing in her diary on January 1, 1944, at the age of 11 and continued until her death by suicide in February 1963. Her early diaries remain unpublished and are currently at Indiana University Bloomington. Her adult diaries, starting from her first year at Smith College in 1950, were published in 1982 as &quot;The Journals of Sylvia Plath&quot;, edited by Frances McCullough, with Ted Hughes as consulting editor. In 1982, when Smith College acquired Plath&#x27;s remaining journals, Hughes sealed two of them until February 11, 2013, the 50th anniversary of Plath&#x27;s death.

During the last years of his life, Hughes began working on a fuller publication of Plath&#x27;s journals. In 1998, shortly before his death, he unsealed the two journals, and passed the project onto his children by Plath, Frieda and Nicholas, who passed it on to Karen V. Kukil, who finished her editing in December 1999. In 2000 Anchor Books published &quot;The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath&quot;. More than half of the new volume contained newly released material; the American author Joyce Carol Oates hailed the publication as a &quot;genuine literary event&quot;. Hughes faced criticism for his role in handling the journals: He claims to have destroyed Plath&#x27;s last journal, which contained entries from the winter of 1962 up to her death. In the foreword of the 1982 version, he writes &quot;I destroyed [the last of her journals] because I did not want her children to have to read it (in those days I regarded forgetfulness as an essential part of survival).&quot;

==Hughes controversies==
As Hughes and Plath were legally married at the time of her death, Hughes inherited the Plath estate, including all her written work. He has been condemned repeatedly for burning Plath&#x27;s last journal, saying he &quot;did not want her children to have to read it&quot;. Hughes lost another journal and an unfinished novel, and instructed that a collection of Plath&#x27;s papers and journals should not be released until 2013. He has been accused of attempting to control the estate for his own ends, although royalties from Plath&#x27;s poetry were placed into a trust account for their two children, Frieda and Nicholas.

Plath&#x27;s gravestone has been repeatedly vandalized by those aggrieved that &quot;Hughes&quot; is written on the stone; they have attempted to chisel it off, leaving only the name &quot;Sylvia Plath&quot;. When Hughes&#x27; mistress Assia Wevill died by suicide and killed their four-year-old daughter Shura in 1969, this practice intensified. After each defacement, Hughes had the damaged stone removed, sometimes leaving the site unmarked during repair. Outraged mourners accused Hughes in the media of dishonouring her name by removing the stone. Wevill&#x27;s death led to claims that Hughes had been abusive to both Plath and Wevill.

Radical feminist poet Robin Morgan published the poem &quot;Arraignment&quot;, in which she openly accused Hughes of the battery and murder of Plath. Her book &quot;Monster&quot; (1972) &quot;included a piece in which a gang of Plath aficionados are imagined castrating Hughes, stuffing his penis into his mouth and then blowing out his brains&quot;. Hughes threatened to sue Morgan. The book was withdrawn by the publisher Random House, but it remained in circulation among feminists. Other feminists threatened to kill Hughes in Plath&#x27;s name and pursue a conviction for murder. Plath&#x27;s poem &quot;The Jailor&quot;, in which the speaker condemns her husband&#x27;s brutality, was included in Morgan&#x27;s 1970 anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings from the Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement.&quot;

In 1989, with Hughes under public attack, a battle raged in the letters pages of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;. In &quot;The Guardian&quot; on April 20, 1989, Hughes wrote the article &quot;The Place Where Sylvia Plath Should Rest in Peace&quot;: &quot;In the years soon after [Plath&#x27;s] death, when scholars approached me, I tried to take their apparently serious concern for the truth about Sylvia Plath seriously. But I learned my lesson early...If I tried too hard to tell them exactly how something happened, in the hope of correcting some fantasy, I was quite likely to be accused of trying to suppress Free Speech. In general, my refusal to have anything to do with the Plath Fantasia has been regarded as an attempt to suppress Free Speech...The Fantasia about Sylvia Plath is more needed than the facts. Where that leaves respect for the truth of her life (and of mine), or for her memory, or for the literary tradition, I do not know.&quot;

Still the subject of speculation and opprobrium in 1998, Hughes published &quot;Birthday Letters&quot; that year, his own collection of 88 poems about his relationship with Plath. Hughes had published very little about his experience of the marriage and Plath&#x27;s suicide, and the book caused a sensation, being taken as his first explicit disclosure, and it topped bestseller charts. It was not known at the volume&#x27;s release that Hughes had terminal cancer and would die later that year. The book won the Forward Poetry Prize, the T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry, and the Whitbread Poetry Prize. The poems, written after Plath&#x27;s death, in some cases long after, try to find a reason why Plath took her own life.

In October 2015, the BBC Two documentary &quot;Ted Hughes: Stronger Than Death&quot; examined Hughes&#x27; life and work; it included audio recordings of Plath reciting her own poetry. Their daughter Frieda spoke for the first time about her mother and father.

==Themes and legacy==
Sylvia Plath&#x27;s early poems exhibit what became her typical imagery, using personal and nature-based depictions featuring, for example, the moon, blood, hospitals, fetuses, and skulls. They were mostly imitation exercises of poets she admired such as Dylan Thomas, W. B. Yeats and Marianne Moore. Late in 1959, when she and Hughes were at the Yaddo writers&#x27; colony in New York State, she wrote the seven-part &quot;Poem for a Birthday&quot;, echoing Theodore Roethke&#x27;s &quot;Lost Son&quot; sequence, though its theme is her own traumatic breakdown and suicide attempt at 21. After 1960 her work moved into a more surreal landscape darkened by a sense of imprisonment and looming death, overshadowed by her father. &quot;The Colossus&quot; is filled with themes of death, redemption and resurrection. After Hughes left, Plath produced, in less than two months, the 40 poems of rage, despair, love, and vengeance on which her reputation mostly rests.

Plath&#x27;s landscape poetry, which she wrote throughout her life, has been described as &quot;a rich and important area of her work that is often overlooked...some of the best of which was written about the Yorkshire moors&quot;. Her September 1961 poem &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; takes its title from the Emily Brontë novel, but its content and style is Plath&#x27;s own particular vision of the Pennine landscape.

It was the posthumous publication of &quot;Ariel&quot; in 1965 that precipitated Plath&#x27;s rise to fame and helped establish her reputation as one of the 20th century&#x27;s best poets. As soon as it was published, critics began to see the collection as the charting of Plath&#x27;s increasing desperation or death wish. Her dramatic death became her most famous aspect and remains so. &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; both reviewed the slim volume of &quot;Ariel&quot; in the wake of her death. The critic at &quot;Time&quot; said: &quot;Within a week of her death, intellectual London was hunched over copies of a strange and terrible poem she had written during her last sick slide toward suicide. &#x27;Daddy&#x27; was its title; its subject was her morbid love-hatred of her father; its style was as brutal as a truncheon. What is more, &#x27;Daddy&#x27; was merely the first jet of flame from a literary dragon who in the last months of her life breathed a burning river of bile across the literary landscape...In her most ferocious poems, &#x27;Daddy&#x27; and &#x27;Lady Lazarus&#x27;, fear, hate, love, death and the poet&#x27;s own identity become fused at black heat with the figure of her father, and through him, with the guilt of the German exterminators and the suffering of their Jewish victims. They are poems, as Robert Lowell says in his preface to &quot;Ariel&quot;, that &#x27;play Russian roulette with six cartridges in the cylinder&#x27;.&quot; On January 16, 2004, &quot;The Independent&quot; in London published an article which ranked &quot;Ariel&quot; as the third best book of modern poetry among its Ten Best Modern Poetry Books.The ten best modern poetry books

Some in the feminist movement saw Plath as speaking for their experience, as a &quot;symbol of blighted female genius&quot;. Writer Honor Moore describes &quot;Ariel&quot; as marking the beginning of a movement, Plath suddenly visible as &quot;a woman on paper&quot;, certain and audacious. Moore says: &quot;When Sylvia Plath&#x27;s &quot;Ariel&quot; was published in the United States in 1966, American women noticed. Not only women who ordinarily read poems, but housewives and mothers whose ambitions had awakened ... Here was a woman, superbly trained in her craft, whose final poems uncompromisingly charted female rage, ambivalence, and grief, in a voice with which many women identified.&quot;

Smith College, Plath&#x27;s alma mater, holds her literary papers in the Smith College Library.

The United States Postal Service introduced a postage stamp featuring Plath in 2012. An English Heritage plaque records Plath&#x27;s residence at 3 Chalcot Square, in London.

In 2013 a previously unseen draft of her poem &quot;Sheep in Fog&quot;, written two weeks before her death, revealed her disturbed state of mind.

In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an obituary for Plath as part of the Overlooked history project.

===Portrayals in media===
Plath&#x27;s voice is heard in a BBC documentary about her life, recorded in London in late 1962. Of the BBC recording Elizabeth Hardwick wrote:
Gwyneth Paltrow portrayed Plath in the biopic &quot;Sylvia&quot; (2003). Elizabeth Sigmund, who was friends with both Plath and Hughes, criticized the movie for depicting Sylvia as &quot;a permanent depressive and a possessive person&quot;, but she conceded that &quot;the film has an atmosphere towards the end of her life which is heartbreaking in its accuracy&quot;. Frieda Hughes, who was only two years old when she lost her mother, was angered by the making of entertainment featuring her parents&#x27; troubled marriage and her mother&#x27;s death. She accused the &quot;peanut crunching&quot; public of wanting to be titillated by her family&#x27;s tragedies. In 2003, Frieda reacted to the situation in the poem &quot;My Mother&quot;, first published in &quot;Tatler&quot;:

<text>Eilleen Regina &quot;Shania&quot; Twain ( ; ; born August 28, 1965) is a Canadian singer-songwriter. She has sold over 100 million records, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time and the best-selling female artist in country music history. Her success garnered her several titles, including the &quot;Queen of Country Pop&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; named her as the leader of the 1990s country-pop crossover stars.

Raised in Timmins, Ontario, Twain pursued singing and songwriting from a young age before signing with Mercury Nashville Records in the early 1990s. Her self-titled debut studio album was a commercial failure upon release in 1993. After collaborating with producer and later husband Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, she rose to fame with her second studio album, &quot;The Woman in Me&quot; (1995), which brought her widespread success. It sold over 20 million copies worldwide, spawned eight singles, including &quot;Any Man of Mine&quot; and earned her a Grammy Award. Twain&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Come On Over&quot; (1997), is recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the biggest-selling studio album by a female solo artist. It also became the best-selling country album, best-selling album by a Canadian, and one of the world&#x27;s best-selling albums of all time, selling over 40 million copies worldwide. &quot;Come On Over&quot; produced twelve singles, including &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot;, &quot;From This Moment On&quot;, &quot;That Don&#x27;t Impress Me Much&quot; and &quot;Man! I Feel Like a Woman!&quot; and earned her four Grammy Awards. Her fourth studio album, &quot;Up!&quot; (2002), spawned eight singles, including &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Getcha Good!&quot;, &quot;Ka-Ching!&quot; and &quot;Forever and for Always&quot;, selling over 20 million copies worldwide, also being certified Diamond in the United States.

In 2004, after releasing her &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, which produced three singles including &quot;Party for Two&quot;, Twain entered a hiatus, revealing years later that diagnoses with Lyme disease and dysphonia led to a severely weakened singing voice. She chronicled her vocal rehabilitation on the OWN miniseries &quot;Why Not? with Shania Twain&quot;, released her first single in six years in 2011, &quot;Today Is Your Day&quot;, and published an autobiography, &quot;From This Moment On&quot;. Twain returned to performing the following year with an exclusive concert residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace, &quot;&quot;, which ran until 2014. In 2015, she launched the North American Rock This Country Tour, which was billed as her farewell tour. Twain released her first studio album in 15 years in 2017, &quot;Now&quot;, and embarked on the Now Tour in 2018. In 2019, she started her second Las Vegas residency, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go!&quot; at the Zappos Theater. Her sixth studio album &quot;Queen of Me&quot; was released in 2023, and she embarked on the Queen of Me Tour in the same year.

Twain has received five Grammy Awards, two World Music Awards, 39 BMI Songwriter Awards, inductions to Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame and the Hollywood Walk of Fame, as well as the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. According to the RIAA, she is the only female artist in history to have three (consecutive) albums certified Diamond by the RIAA and is the seventh best-selling female artist in the United States. Altogether Twain is ranked as the 10th best-selling artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era. &quot;Billboard&quot; listed her as the 13th Greatest Music Video Female Solo Artist of all time (42nd overall). According to &quot;Billboard&quot; Boxscore, she is the highest-grossing female country touring artist with $421.1 million gross from her concert tours.

==Early life==
Twain was born Eilleen Regina Edwards in Windsor, Ontario, on August 28, 1965, to Sharon (née Morrison) and Clarence Edwards. She has two sisters, Jill and Carrie Ann. Her parents divorced when she was two and her mother moved to Timmins, Ontario, with her daughters. Sharon married Jerry Twain, an Ojibwa from the nearby Mattagami First Nation, and they had a son, Mark. Jerry adopted the girls and legally changed their surname to Twain. When Mark was a toddler, Jerry and Sharon adopted Jerry&#x27;s baby nephew Darryl when his mother died. Because of Twain&#x27;s connection to Jerry, the media have incorrectly reported that she is of Ojibwe descent. When questioned as to why she chose not to publicly acknowledge Edwards as her father for years she stated: My father [Jerry Twain] went out of his way to raise three daughters that weren&#x27;t even his. For me to acknowledge another man as my father, a man who was never there for me as a father, who wasn&#x27;t the one who struggled every day to put food on our table, would have hurt him terribly. We were a family. Step-father, step-brothers, we never used that vocabulary in our home. To have referred to him as my step-father would have been the worst slap across the face to him. She holds a status card and is on the official band membership list of the Temagami First Nation. In 1991 Twain was offered a recording contract in Nashville and applied for immigration status into the United States. At that time, by virtue of her stepfather Jerry Twain being a full-blooded Ojibwe and the rights guaranteed to indigenous Americans in the Jay Treaty (1795), she became legally registered as having 50 percent indigenous American blood.

Twain has said that as a child she was told by her mother that her biological father was part Cree, a claim his family denies. Her confirmed ancestry includes Irish and French roots. Through a maternal great-grandmother, she is a descendant of French carpenter Zacharie Cloutier. Her Irish maternal grandmother, Eileen Pearce, emigrated from Newbridge, County Kildare.

She has said she had a difficult childhood. Her parents earned little money, and food was often scarce in their household. She did not confide her situation to school authorities, fearing they might break up the family. Her mother and stepfather&#x27;s marriage was stormy at times, and from a young age she witnessed violence between them. Her mother struggled with bouts of depression. She eventually convinced her mother to take her and the children and run away to a homeless shelter in Toronto; however Sharon returned to Jerry with the children in 1981.

In Timmins, Shania started singing at bars at the age of eight to try to help pay her family&#x27;s bills; she often earned $20 between midnight and 1 a.m. performing for remaining customers after the bar had finished serving alcohol. Although she expressed a dislike for singing in those bars, she believes that this was her own kind of performing-arts school on the road. She has said of the ordeal, &quot;My deepest passion was music and it helped. There were moments when I thought, &#x27;I hate this.&#x27; I hated going into bars and being with drunks. But I loved the music and so I survived.&quot; She states that the art of creating, of actually writing songs, &quot;was very different from performing them and became progressively important&quot;.

At age 13, Twain was invited to perform on the CBC&#x27;s &quot;Tommy Hunter Show&quot;. While attending Timmins High and Vocational School, she was the singer for a local band called Longshot, which covered Top 40 music. In the early 1980s she spent some time working with her step-father&#x27;s reforestation business in northern Ontario, which employed some 75 Ojibwe and Cree workers. Although the work was demanding and the pay low, she said, 
==Career==
===1983–1992: Beginnings===

Twain graduated from Timmins High in June 1983 eager to expand her musical horizons. After Longshot&#x27;s demise she was approached by a cover band led by Diane Chase called Flirt and toured Ontario with them. She took singing lessons from Toronto-based coach Ian Garrett, often cleaning his house as payment. In the autumn of 1984 her talents were noticed by Toronto DJ Stan Campbell who wrote about her in a &quot;Country Music News&quot; article: &quot;Eilleen possesses a powerful voice with an impressive range. She has the necessary drive, ambition and positive attitude to achieve her goals&quot;. Campbell was making an album by Canadian musician (and present-day CKTB radio personality) Tim Denis at the time and she was featured on the backing vocals of the song &quot;Heavy on the Sunshine&quot;. Country singer Mary Bailey saw her perform in Sudbury, Ontario, saying &quot;I saw this little girl up on stage with a guitar and it absolutely blew me away. She performed Willie Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&quot; and Hank Williams&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot;. Her voice reminded me of Tanya Tucker, it had strength and character, a lot of feeling. She&#x27;s a star, she deserves an opportunity.&quot; Bailey later said &quot;She sang a few songs that she had written, and I thought to myself, this kid is like nineteen years old, where does she get this? This is from a person who&#x27;s lived sixty years&quot;. On November 1, 1987, her mother and stepfather died in a car accident approximately north of Wawa, Ontario. She moved back to Timmins to take care of her younger siblings and took them all to Huntsville, Ontario, where she supported them by earning money performing at the nearby Deerhurst Resort.

===1993–1994: &quot;Shania Twain&quot;===
Several years later, when Twain&#x27;s siblings moved out on their own, she assembled a demo tape of her songs and her Huntsville manager set up a showcase for her to present her material to record executives. She caught the attention of a few labels, including Mercury Nashville Records, who signed her within a few months. During this time, she changed her name to Shania, which was rumoured to be an Ojibwa word which means &quot;on my way&quot;. However, her biographer, Robin Eggar, writes: &quot;There is a continuing confusion about what &#x27;Shania&#x27; means and if indeed it is an Ojibwe word or phrase at all. There is no mispronounced or misheard phrase in either Ojibwe or Cree that comes close to meaning &#x27;on my way.&#x27; Yet the legend of her name continues to be repeated in the media to this day.&quot; Eggar was mistaken about there being no Ojibwe phrase that &quot;comes close&quot;, as &quot;Ani aya&#x27;aa&quot;, pronounced &quot;Ah-nih Eye-uh-ah&quot;, means &quot;someone on the way&quot; in Ojibwe. It is therefore possible that someone with an imperfect knowledge of the Ojibwe language created Shania with the incorrect idea it would mean &quot;she&#x27;s on the way&quot;.

Her self-titled debut album was released on April 20, 1993, in North America and garnered her audiences outside Canada. Shortly before its release, she sang backing vocals for other Mercury artists, including on Jeff Chance&#x27;s album &quot;Walk Softly on the Bridges&quot; (1992) and Sammy Kershaw&#x27;s album &quot;Haunted Heart&quot; (1993). &quot;Shania Twain&quot; reached No. 67 on the US Country Albums Chart and gained positive reviews from critics. The album failed to sell significant copies upon release, but her future success generated enough interest for the album to be certified platinum in 1999 by the RIAA, denoting sales of over 1 million copies. The album yielded two minor hit singles in the United States with &quot;What Made You Say That&quot; and &quot;Dance with the One That Brought You&quot;. The third and final single, &quot;You Lay a Whole Lot of Love on Me&quot;, failed to chart. All three singles had accompanying music videos. The album was more successful in Europe, where she won Country Music Television Europe&#x27;s &quot;Rising Video Star of the Year&quot; award. In her 2011 autobiography &quot;From This Moment On&quot; she expressed displeasure with her debut studio album, revealing that she had very little creative control and was frustrated with being unable to showcase her songwriting abilities. She did, however, co-write one song, &quot;God Ain&#x27;t Gonna Getcha for That&quot;, for the album.

===1995–1996: &quot;The Woman in Me&quot; and commercial success===
When rock producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange heard Twain&#x27;s original songs and singing from her debut album, he offered to produce and write songs with her. After many telephone conversations, they met at Nashville&#x27;s Fan Fair in June 1993. Twain and Lange became very close within weeks, culminating in their wedding on December 28, 1993. They co-wrote every song apart from one that featured on her second studio album, &quot;The Woman in Me&quot;. &quot;The Woman in Me&quot; was released on February 7, 1995. Of the twelve tracks on the album, eight were released as singles. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?&quot; went to No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Chart. This was followed by her first Country Top 10 and No.1 hit single, &quot;Any Man of Mine&quot;, which also cracked the Top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. She had further hits from the album, including the title track which peaked at No.14 and three additional No.1 hits: &quot;(If You&#x27;re Not in It for Love) I&#x27;m Outta Here!&quot;, &quot;You Win My Love&quot;, and &quot;No One Needs to Know&quot;, which was selected for the original soundtrack for the 1996 film &quot;Twister&quot;, a first for Twain. Plus minor country hit &quot;Home Ain&#x27;t Where His Heart Is (Anymore)&quot; and a re-recorded gospel version of the album track &quot;God Bless the Child&quot; with new lyrics. Meanwhile, in Australia, five of these singles: &quot;The Woman in Me&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Outta Here!&quot;, &quot;You Win My Love&quot;, &quot;No One Needs to Know&quot; and &quot;God Bless the Child&quot;, were remixed for the Australian pop market, with &quot;I&#x27;m Outta Here!&quot; becoming her breakthrough hit there, reaching No.5 on the ARIA charts.

As of 2007 the album had sold more than 12 million copies in the United States, being certified Diamond by the RIAA. The album was a quick breakthrough and because of this she performed selected international venues and television shows including two CMA Fan Fair performances with Nashville guitarists Randy Thomas (co-writer of the song &quot;Butterfly Kisses&quot;), and Dan Schafer. Mercury Nashville&#x27;s promotion of the album was based largely upon a series of music videos, which every single from the album had. During this period she made television appearances on shows such as two performances on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, Blockbuster Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards and the American Music Awards. &quot;The Woman in Me&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Country Album as well as the Academy of Country Music award for Album of the Year; the latter group also awarded her Best New Female Vocalist.

===1997–2001: &quot;Come On Over&quot;, international breakthrough, and Limelight Sessions===

In 1997 Twain released her follow-up album, &quot;Come On Over&quot;. It established her as a successful crossover singer. Of the sixteen tracks on the album, twelve were released as singles. Following the release of lead singles &quot;Love Gets Me Every Time&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)&quot;, which allowed her to make more appearances in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the album started selling. With the release of third single, &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot;, sales skyrocketed. &quot;From This Moment On&quot;, &quot;When&quot;, &quot;Honey, I&#x27;m Home&quot;, &quot;That Don&#x27;t Impress Me Much&quot;, &quot;Man! I Feel Like a Woman!&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Way&quot;, the title track, &quot;Rock This Country!&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Holdin&#x27; On to Love (To Save My Life)&quot; are the other nine songs that eventually saw release as singles. With the exception of &quot;I&#x27;m Holdin&#x27; On to Love&quot;, all of the singles had accompanying music videos. &quot;From This Moment On&quot; is a duet with singer Bryan White and there was a re-recorded solo pop version, which was used for its music video.

The album peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and stayed on the charts for the next two years, going on to sell 40 million copies worldwide, making it the biggest-selling album of all time by a female musician. She continued to break international boundaries for country music and female crossover artists. It is also the ninth highest-selling album by any type of artist in the US and the top selling country album in history. Songs from the album won four Grammy Awards during this time, including Best Country Song and Best Female Country Performance (for &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot; and &quot;Man! I Feel Like a Woman!&quot;) for her. Lange won Grammys for &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot; and &quot;Come On Over&quot;.

In 1998 following the pop release of &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot;, the &quot;Come On Over&quot; album was released in a remixed format for the European market as a pop album with less country instrumentation, and gave her the big breakthrough in Europe she and Lange were looking for. &quot;Come On Over&quot; went to No. 1 on the UK album charts for 11 weeks. It became the biggest selling album of the year in the UK and a bestseller in other big European markets as well, selling more than one million copies in Germany and nearly 4 million in the UK alone. Although &quot;You&#x27;re Still The One&quot; and the pop version of &quot;From This Moment On&quot; cracked the Top 10 of the UK charts and &quot;When&quot; had success in the Top 20, the songs that drew European attention to the album were the pop remixed singles of &quot;That Don&#x27;t Impress Me Much&quot;, which reached number 3 in the UK and cracked the Top 10 in Germany, and &quot;Man! I Feel Like a Woman!&quot;, which peaked at number 3 in both the UK and France. Additionally, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Way&quot; was remixed specifically for inclusion on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Notting Hill&quot;. Subsequently, a reissue of the international version of the album was released worldwide, including the US and Europe, containing three of these new remixes. Additionally, the album set the record for the longest ever stay in the Top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, remaining there for 99 weeks. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine declared Shania Twain the most played adult contemporary artist on US radio in 1999.

In 1998, she launched her first major concert tour, aided by her manager Jon Landau, a veteran of many large-scale tours with Bruce Springsteen. The Come On Over Tour shows were a success, winning the &quot;Country Tour of the Year&quot; in 1998 and 1999 by Pollstar Concert Industry Awards. In 2000, she was initially scheduled to release a Christmas album, but plans to release one were cancelled later in the year. As of 2004, &quot;Come on Over&quot; has sold over 20 million copies in the United States, being certified Double Diamond by the RIAA.

===2002–2004: &quot;Up!&quot;===
After a change in management – QPrime replaced Landau – and a two-year break, along with the birth of their son, Eja (pronounced &quot;Asia&quot;) D&#x27;Angelo, Twain and Lange returned to the studio. &quot;Up!&quot; was released on November 19, 2002. On January 26, 2003, she performed in the Super Bowl XXXVII halftime show. About a year later she kicked off the Up! Tour in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada on September 25, 2003. &quot;Up!&quot; was released with three different discs – country/acoustic (green CD), pop/rock (red CD), and world/dance (blue CD). &quot;Up!&quot; was given four out of five stars by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, and debuted at No.1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart, selling 874,000 in the first week alone. It remained at the top of the charts for five weeks. Her crossover appeal in the country, pop and dance genres, led &quot;Up!&quot; to reach 1 in Germany, 2 in Australia and the Top Five in the UK and France. In Germany, &quot;Up!&quot; was certified 4× platinum and stayed in the Top 100 for a year and a half. The international music disc was remixed with Indian-style orchestral and percussion parts recorded in Mumbai, India. The new versions were produced by Simon and Diamond Duggal, brothers from Birmingham, England. They were originally invited to contribute parts to the pop version of &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Getcha Good!&quot; which retained the Indian influence.

Her popularity in UK was reflected by numerous appearances on the long-running music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, performing singles from &quot;Come On Over&quot; from 1999. In 2002 an entire special show was dedicated to her on sister show &quot;TOTP2&quot;, in which she herself introduced some past performances of her greatest hits and singles from &quot;Up!&quot;. In November 2004 she appeared on the annual BBC charity telethon &quot;Children in Need&quot;. During the show, she performed &quot;Up!&quot;, and took part in a magic act in which she was sawn in half by magician Scott Penrose in an illusion called Clearly Impossible.

Eight of the tracks were released as singles in various markets. The first single from the album, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Getcha Good!&quot; became a top 10 country hit in the US, after debuting at No. 24 after only five days of airplay; but only made the Top 40 on the pop charts. The pop version hit 4 in the UK. In Australia, Germany and France, the song reached the Top 15 in each case. The follow-up single was the title track, which reached the Top 15 in the US country charts but only reached 63 on the pop charts. The second European single, and third single overall, became the mid-tempo song &quot;Ka-Ching!&quot; (which was never released as a single in North America) with lyrics where she was criticizing unchecked consumerism. The song eventually became another hit in the European markets, reaching 1 in Germany and Austria and other European countries, the UK Top 10 and the Top 15 in France.

The fourth single from the album was the most successful in the US, the romantic ballad &quot;Forever and for Always&quot;. It was released in April 2003 and peaked at 4 on the country chart, 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart and 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Forever and For Always&quot; reached the Top 10 in the UK and Germany. The other four singles from the album were &quot;Thank You Baby! (For Makin&#x27; Someday Come So Soon)&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Not Just a Pretty Face&quot;, &quot;When You Kiss Me&quot; and &quot;It Only Hurts When I&#x27;m Breathing&quot;. All eight singles had accompanying music videos. The title track &quot;Up!&quot;, and &quot;When You Kiss Me&quot; saw release in limited edition to European countries, such as Germany, in early 2004. By January 2008, &quot;Up!&quot; had sold 5.5 million copies in the US and was certified as 11× platinum (Diamond) by the RIAA. This made her the only female artist in history to have three consecutive albums certified Diamond by the RIAA.

===2004–2010: &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and delay of new album===
In 2004 Twain released the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, with three new tracks. As of 2012 it had sold over 4.15 million copies in the US. The first single, the multi-format duet &quot;Party for Two&quot;, made the country top ten with Billy Currington, while the pop version with Sugar Ray lead singer Mark McGrath made top ten in the United Kingdom and Germany. The follow-up singles, &quot;Don&#x27;t!&quot; and &quot;I Ain&#x27;t No Quitter&quot; did not fare as well. The former made Top 20 on Adult Contemporary, while the latter did not gain enough airplay to reach the Country Top 40. In August 2005 she released the single &quot;Shoes&quot; from the &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; soundtrack. In late 2006 Twain and Anne Murray recorded a duet version of Murray&#x27;s hit &quot;You Needed Me&quot; for her 2007 album, &quot;Anne Murray Duets: Friends &amp; Legends&quot;. This was her final recording with husband Lange as producer; on May 15, 2008, it was announced that she and Lange were separating. Their divorce was finalized in 2010. In June 2009 she explained the delays in the release of her next album, noting she had gone through personal pains and was focusing on raising her son Eja. In August 2009, at a conference in Timmins, Ontario, a spokesman for her label said a new record from Twain was still &quot;nowhere in sight&quot;.

===2011–2015: Return to music, residency, and tour===

In May 2011 Twain confirmed in an interview that she would release her first new single in six years, &quot;Today Is Your Day&quot;, after the finale of &quot;Why Not? with Shania Twain&quot;. She previewed the song in the first episode of the series. She worked with music producers David Foster and Nathan Chapman on the song. She published her autobiography with Atria Books, &quot;From This Moment On&quot;. The last episode of &quot;Why Not?&quot; features her and Lionel Richie recording &quot;Endless Love&quot; which would be the first single from his 2012 album &quot;Tuskegee&quot;. &quot;Today Is Your Day&quot; was officially released to iTunes and country radio on June 12, 2011. In addition to &quot;Today Is Your Day&quot;, she collaborated with Michael Bublé on his 2011 album &quot;Christmas&quot; (also produced by David Foster). She recorded &quot;White Christmas&quot; with Bublé, which was the first single from the album. On June 8, 2011, at a press conference at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, she announced that she would headline Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for two years. Her show, titled &quot;&quot;, ran from December 1, 2012, to December 13, 2014.

In July 2013 she announced on Facebook that she was working on her album over the summer during a break from &quot;Still the One&quot;. In October 2013 she sat down with Robin Roberts from &quot;Good Morning America&quot; as a featured artist on the Countdown to the CMA Awards. In the interview she said that a new album was coming, but she said that she was still in the process of finding the right producer.

Outside of her show at Caesars Palace, she performed two concerts at the Calgary Stampede in Calgary, Alberta, on July 9 and 10, 2014. In a series of interviews leading up to her Calgary Stampede shows she said she hoped to tour in 2015 and that it would lead to the release of a new album. Alongside her Calgary Stampede shows, she also headlined a show on Labour Day weekend at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada.

On March 4, 2015, she announced on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; she would be going on tour for the first time in eleven years, and would begin June 5 in Seattle, Washington, and end on October 11 in Toronto, Ontario. She also announced this would be her last tour before her fifth studio album, which she intends to release while she is 50. In an interview on Global Television Network&#x27;s &quot;The Morning Show&quot; on March 6 she confirmed that she is not retiring from her music career after the tour. In an interview with Radio.com published on March 5 she stated that she has found several producers for her upcoming album, describing it as &quot;soul music&quot;.

On August 24, 2015, she stated &quot;First, I have to finish my new album this winter. Six tracks are already completed. I&#x27;ve written 38 songs in total, and now the process is underway to narrow that down to another six or eight to finish recording&quot;. That same month, it was announced by several sources, that even though her current Rock This Country Tour is her final time touring, she is possibly planning on extending the tour overseas because the Rock This Country tour was only based in the United States and Canada. She also mentioned possibly returning to Las Vegas with a new residency show for possibly late 2016 or 2017. The new show would end up featuring music from her long-awaited new album as well as her hits.

===2016–2021: &quot;Now&quot;, second Las Vegas residency===
In October 2016 Twain confirmed to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that she had new music coming &quot;really soon.&quot; In December 2016 in an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, she spoke about her forthcoming album, describing the finished product as &quot;kind of schizophrenic musically&quot; maintaining &quot;She&#x27;s the glue&quot;. In February 2017 she again spoke to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; about the album; select song titles were confirmed as she detailed that she had not only hoped to release a single in March, but that she planned to release the album in May. In April 2017 &quot;Billboard&quot; announced that her new single, &quot;Life&#x27;s About to Get Good&quot;, would premiere in June, with the album projected for release in September. Twain headlined the 2017 Stagecoach Festival in Indio, California, where she previewed her new music for the first time. She performed on the &quot;Today Show&quot;″s &quot;Summer Concert Series&quot; on June 16, 2017. Her fifth studio album, &quot;Now&quot;, was released on September 29, 2017, and would debut at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming her second album to do so. In June 2017 she announced on ET Canada that she would tour with &quot;Now&quot;. She announced the Now Tour on her website on August 17, 2017. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Swingin&#x27; With My Eyes Closed&quot;, was released on August 18, 2017. She has also internationally released two other promotional singles off of &quot;Now&quot;, including &quot;Poor Me&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;ve Got Something They Don&#x27;t&quot;. In June 2019 she announced her second Las Vegas residency, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go!&quot;, which opened on December 6, 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic caused the postponement and cancellation of many dates. The residency ended on September 10, 2022.

===2022–present: &quot;Not Just a Girl&quot;, &quot;Queen of Me&quot;, and third Las Vegas residency===

In July 2022, a Netflix documentary spanning Twain&#x27;s career, entitled &quot;Not Just A Girl&quot;, was released. It was shortlisted for the Rose d&#x27;Or 2022 Awards in the Art category. The documentary released simultaneously with a companion compilation album, &quot;Not Just a Girl (The Highlights)&quot;, featuring seventeen previously released songs plus the new title track.

On September 23, 2022, Twain signed with Republic Nashville and released &quot;Waking Up Dreaming&quot; as the lead single from her sixth then-upcoming studio album, &quot;Queen of Me&quot;. On January 5, 2023, she released the second single off the album, Giddy Up!. &quot;Queen of Me&quot; was released on February 3, 2023. It was her first album release under her new label. The album debuted at number 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, earning 38,000 equivalent album units, with 34,000 of those being album sales, becoming her sixth top-ten album in the country. She joined Madonna as the only women with newly-charting &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 top 10s in the 1990s, 2000s, &#x27;10s and &#x27;20s (Madonna&#x27;s streak also includes the &#x27;80s). The album debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart at No. 2, earning her her seventh top-five entry on the chart. In Canada, Queen of Me debuted at number two on the Canadian Album Chart, becoming her sixth top-ten album on the chart and seventh overall in the country. In the United Kingdom, Queen of Me debuted atop the UK Albums Chart, becoming her third number one album in the country, after &quot;Come On Over&quot; (1998) and &quot;Now&quot; (2017).

On October 22, 2022, Twain announced Queen of Me Tour across North America and Europe to promote the album. It was her first tour in nearly five years, comprising 76 dates. She featured on the single &quot;Unhealthy&quot;, which was released on May 18, 2023, the title track from Anne-Marie&#x27;s third studio album. The song peaked at number 18 on the UK Singles Chart and became Twain&#x27;s first top-20 in the region since &quot;Party for Two&quot; in December 2004. On August 15, 2023, she announced her third Las Vegas residency, Shania Twain: Come On Over – The Las Vegas Residency – All The Hits! at Bakkt Theater (now PH Live), scheduled to run from May to December 2024. In March 2024, to commemorate the 65th anniversary of International Women&#x27;s Day, Twain was one of a number of female celebrities had their likeness turned into Barbie dolls. In June 2024, she performed in the traditional Sunday Legends slot at the Glastonbury Festival. On September 2, 2024, she announced she would be extending her Las Vegas residency, Shania Twain: Come On Over – The Las Vegas Residency – All The Hits! at PH Live at Planet Hollywood Las Vegas with nine final shows taking place in January and February 2025.

===TV and film career===
Twain&#x27;s mainstream pop acceptance was further helped by her appearance in the 1998 first edition of the &quot;VH1 Divas&quot; concert where she sang alongside Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Gloria Estefan, Carole King and Aretha Franklin, and also by VH1&#x27;s 1999 heavily aired &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, which concentrated on the tragic aspects of her early life as well as her physical attractiveness and Nashville&#x27;s early resistance to her bare-midriff music videos. After &quot;Divas&quot;, she sang background vocals with Lange for Dion&#x27;s songs, &quot;If Walls Could Talk&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&#x27;s (The Saddest Word)&quot;.

She appeared as herself in the 2004 feature film &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot;. On November 12, 2008, she made her first television appearance since her split from Lange, where she appeared as a surprise presenter at the 42nd CMA Awards. In 2009 she served as a guest judge on &quot;American Idol&quot;, for the show&#x27;s August 30 and 31 episodes, and in April 2010 she announced plans for her own TV show, titled &quot;Why Not? with Shania Twain&quot;. The show debuted on May 8, 2011, on OWN. She returned to &quot;American Idol&quot; as a guest mentor for a week where the top 6 contestants showcased her songs. After the conclusion of the ninth season she was very close to becoming a judge but ultimately it was Jennifer Lopez who got the job.

She guest starred as herself on the Comedy Central series &quot;Broad City&quot;, in a September 2017 episode titled &quot;Twaining Day&quot;, and appeared as a guest judge in the 25th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; during the show&#x27;s &quot;Movie Night&quot; on October 23, 2017, and performed her song &quot;Soldier&quot;. She also appeared as a guest judge on episode five of the 10th Season of &quot;Rupaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; in 2018.

She competed against singer Meghan Trainor in an episode of TBS&#x27;s &quot;Drop the Mic&quot; which aired in January 2018. She was guest of honour for a &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot; episode on Paramount Network pitting Derek Hough against Nicole Scherzinger that was dedicated to her and her music. The tribute episode aired June 21, 2018. In November 2018 she appeared in the reality talent show &quot;Real Country&quot;, as an executive producer and co-presenter with Jake Owen and Travis Tritt. In 2019 she appeared in the film &quot;Trading Paint&quot;, co-starring alongside John Travolta. In 2020 she played the role of the mother of singer Jeremy Camp in the biographical film &quot;I Still Believe&quot;. In 2023 she appeared on the panel for the second series of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Starstruck&quot;, a revived and reformatted version of &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot;. In 2023 she appeared in season four, episode seven of the reality series The Kardashians. In 2024 she appeared on the first episode of the Netflix series &quot;A Man in Full&quot;, a six-episode limited television series adaptation of the novel with Regina King as director and executive producer and David E. Kelley as showrunner. The miniseries was released on May 2, 2024. She guest starred in an episode of the ABC medical drama, &quot;Doctor Odyssey&quot; which aired on October 3rd, 2024. She appeared in Andrea Bocelli: 30 The Celebration Concert Film, which released in theaters on November 8th, 2024. Shania guest starred in &#x27;A Nonsense Christmas with &quot;Sabrina Carpenter&quot;&#x27; on December 6th 2024, as part of the &quot;Netflix&quot; special, Shania played Mrs Claus in a skit and performed &quot;Santa Baby&quot; with Sabrina Carpenter. In 2025, she will become a judge on the fifth season of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

==Artistry==
Twain possesses a contralto vocal range. In 1996, &quot;Newsweek&quot; defended her from detractors who attributed her refusal to tour at the time to her inability to replicate her studio singing live, describing it as &quot;a warm, languid alto sweetened with a wisp of bedroom allure&quot;. Admitting that her singing voice is not as strong as it was prior to her Lyme disease diagnosis, she had to learn how to navigate her new voice in order to continue performing. Prior to her diagnosis, several physicians with whom she consulted throughout the years primarily attribute the loss of her voice to emotional stress, from which she has since recovered after experimenting with various relaxation techniques and devoting a lot of time to vocal warmups. In 2018 she underwent laryngoplasty to have Gore-Tex stabilizers implanted in her throat to reduce the workload on her vocal muscles.

She did little writing on her self-titled debut album, but Lange noticed Twain &quot;had a distinctive voice as a songwriter&quot; he felt had been overlooked by other collaborators. Describing Twain and Lange as a &quot;versatile&quot; songwriting duo, Bob Paxman of Sounds Like Nashville observed that their songs explore several themes such as feminism and romantic longing, while &quot;Maclean&quot;&#x27;s journalist Brian D. Johnson said her songs &quot;range from domestic-bliss ballads to sassy rockers that taunt and tease.&quot; Alanna Nash of AARP observed that Twain crafted &quot;The Woman in Me&quot; around &quot;hooky melodies and clever wordplay&quot; from her point of view. During the 1990s record executives feared her lyrics were too &quot;male-threatening&quot;; both &quot;The Woman in Me&quot; and &quot;Come On Over&quot; contain feminist and anti-infidelity themes. Although she has become synonymous with singing songs about female empowerment that are &quot;full of attitude&quot;, her catalogue also consists of love songs. She believes female singers are often misunderstood for expressing &quot;feminist views&quot; or standing up for themselves, about which she often sings, explaining, &quot;that doesn&#x27;t mean that we don&#x27;t love the men in our lives, and that we don&#x27;t need the men in our lives.&quot; She tends to isolate herself when writing songs to avoid distractions, believing she is most productive in this manner. She claims to adapt melancholy experiences into happy songs. &quot;Now&quot; was the first album she wrote without Lange&#x27;s involvement, identifying the procedure as a very important songwriting experience because &quot;I needed to do it alone, to start ideas and finish them without relying on anybody else&#x27;s opinion and direction.&quot; Drawing from raw feelings of pain, she also used the album to process the demise of their relationship.

Her primary musical genre is considered to be country pop, with AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine declaring that she &quot;Skillfully fus[ed] mainstream, AOR rock production with country-pop&quot;. &quot;Up&quot; is considered to be her most straightforward pop album to-date. She maintains that she did not dress provocatively for fame, attention or &quot;shock value&quot; but simply because she enjoys her midriff, claiming to have no regrets about her past outfits. She defends contemporary pop stars who dress provocatively, explaining, &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too sexy now ...The boundaries are really up to the individual. And then it&#x27;s up to the viewer whether they like it or not.&quot; She cites Karen Carpenter, Dolly Parton, Mickey Guyton, Taylor Swift, The Chicks, Wynonna Judd, and Kelsea Ballerini as some of the female country artists who inspire her. She has also expressed admiration for country singers Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline, Tammy Wynette, Reba McEntire and LeAnn Rimes.

== Public image and reception ==
Despite her success, Twain has been a divisive figure within country music among purists who initially did not take kindly to her &quot;genre-blending&quot;. According to biographer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, most critics accused her of &quot;diluting country with bland, anthemic hard rock techniques and shamelessly selling her records with sexy videos.&quot; Some country music critics dismissed her music as not being country enough, which some fans theorize resulted in her breakthrough album &quot;The Woman in Me&quot; being snubbed at the 1995 Country Music Awards, despite its widespread success. Similar to Garth Brooks before her, she was initially branded an interloper whose modern production, presentation and songwriting &quot;disrupt[ed] the genre&#x27;s status quo&quot;. During the 1990s she often received backlash for her unconventionally liberated appearance as a country music singer. Despite the breakthrough success of &quot;The Woman in Me&quot;, early detractors did not take her seriously as an artist, with several music journalists questioning her lyrics, the &quot;manufactured&quot; production of her albums, and her singing ability. Such critics concurred that she had little to offer apart from her sex appeal and music videos, often focusing on her physical appearance instead of her music. Early in her career she found herself at odds with the conservative opinions of the country music industry at the time due to her assertive personality and proclivity for wearing revealing outfits that exposed her midriff. She was constantly deprecated for baring her midriff to the point where critics nicknamed it &quot;The most famous midriff in Nashville&quot;, while CMT banned the music video for her debut single &quot;What Made You Say That&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot;″s Roisin O&#x27;Connor believes &quot;Nashville hadn&#x27;t seen anything like Twain [before] – a leopard print-loving, midriff-exposing artist determined to be an international star.&quot; According to Kristin M. Hall of the Associated Press, since Twain had not yet begun touring, she used music videos to broaden her audience. Similarly, Erlewine considers her to be &quot;the first country artist to fully exploit MTV&#x27;s style&quot; by cultivating &quot;a sexy, video-oriented image ... that appealed&quot; to both country and pop audiences, largely without touring.

Her record label cautioned her that both men and women would dislike her independence and sexual expressiveness, respectively, but she did not believe them. Record executives warned her that women would feel threatened by her &quot;dressing too sexy&quot;. Refusing &quot;to conform to a single archetype of femininity&quot;, she recalled that she used music to communicate with like-minded women by alternating between heartbroken, comedic, vengeful, empowered, self-deprecating and lustful personas &quot;all on the same record.&quot; Country rock musician Steve Earle famously labelled her &quot;the world&#x27;s highest-paid lap-dancer.&quot; Despite these criticisms her music has largely been embraced by fans. In a 2015 profile on Twain, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; Sonya Bell theorized that Twain&#x27;s early critics would be shocked by her continued success, while &quot;American Songwriter&quot;″s Joe Vitagliano considers her a testament that &quot;critics and the &#x27;industry&#x27; aren&#x27;t quite the &#x27;be-all, end-all&#x27; that they think they are&quot;. Sarah Koo of &quot;Entertainment Tonight Canada&quot; wrote that, in hindsight, Twain&#x27;s image throughout the 1990s seems tame in comparison to the revealing outfits of artists who have since succeeded her.

At one point she was considered to be among the biggest music stars in the world. Journalist Brian D. Johnson wrote that, despite her girl next door image, Twain &quot;has the sort of star power that people expect from royalty&quot;, which he attributes to her Cinderella-esque life story. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Simon Hattenstone described her as &quot;sexy, empowering and funny. This was a woman who knew what she wanted – men, action, dancing, control.&quot; Calling her equally country, pop and rock star, Hattenstone went on to write that Twain is &quot;fancied by the straight boys, admired by the straight girls, adored by gay men as a camp icon and loved by lesbians who read what they wanted into Man! I Feel Like a Woman!.&quot; Claiming her stint hosting the 2003 Juno Awards was noticeably void of diva behaviour despite persistent rumours of outrageous antics and demands at the time, Brad Wheeler of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; described her as &quot;an international icon and Canada&#x27;s sweetheart&quot;, a sentiment with which Juno Awards producer John Brunton agreed. Instead Twain relied on her own security, band, production team and assistants.

== Legacy ==
BBC Online described her as &quot;the real Queen of Pop&quot;, citing her influence on subsequent successful female artists such as Meghan Trainor, Britney Spears, Taylor Swift and Haim. As one of country music&#x27;s first crossover stars, the website claims her success as a country-pop crossover artist demonstrates that &quot;she was doing the Taylor Swift thing before Taylor Swift even arrived.&quot; Justin Chandler of CBC credited her with making &quot;country-pop crossover its own genre&quot; and &quot;paving the way for artists sitting atop those same charts every year since.&quot; Her record-breaking album &quot;The Woman In Me&quot; is credited as the one that permanently changed country music as a whole.

Twain&#x27;s success in the music industry has earned her the honorific nickname the &quot;Queen of Country Pop&quot;. By 1998 &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; had named her &quot;the reigning queen of country music&quot;. &quot;American Songwriter&quot; contributor Joe Vitagliano named her one of the greatest artists of our time. &quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic Jon Caramanica named her &quot;Country&#x27;s Crossover Queen&quot;, writing that during her prime she &quot;was both a pop centrist and a country rebel, and many of the aesthetic moves she pioneered ended up, following a period of some resistance, as central to the sound of Nashville.&quot; In a ranking of Twain&#x27;s best songs, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that her catalogue of music &quot;ha[s] come to define an era in country music and paved the way for other genre-bending artists that followed.&quot; According to Kristin M. Hall of the Associated Press Twain&#x27;s global success &quot;changed country music for years to come.&quot; Nash credits her work on &quot;Come On Over&quot; with helping to redefine the future of country music. NPR&#x27;s Jewly Hight wrote that, despite initial derision, Twain eventually &quot;redefin[ed] what country superstardom looked, sounded and behaved like&quot;, ultimately influencing a generation of country artists &quot;in making flashier music videos, beefing up their backbeats and staging shows with the energy and theatricality of arena rock.&quot;

===Influence on other artists===
Taylor Swift credits Twain for her own pop crossover. Swift has cited her as one of her most prominent musical influences. Carrie Underwood states that Twain &quot;paved the way for a lot of us.&quot; Underwood believes all similar artists were influenced by Twain, whether or not they realize it. She has been cited as a major influence among Canadian country music artists such as Tenille Arts, Jess Moskaluke, Dean Brody, Lindi Ortega and Brett Kissel. Rapper Post Malone and singer Rihanna have cited her as an inspiration, with the former calling her his childhood crush. She covered Malone&#x27;s song &quot;Rockstar&quot; live during the American Music Awards. She has expressed interest in collaborating with Malone, claiming to have written a song for the two of them in 2019. Singer-songwriter and actor Harry Styles has mentioned her as his biggest influence both &quot;musically and in fashion&quot;. Her bold fashion statements also inspired multiple artists. Harry Styles revealed in an interview with &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; that in &quot;I think, both music and fashion,&quot; his &quot;main influence was probably Shania Twain.&quot; Halsey cited her as one of the artists she was inspired by in her music video &quot;You Should Be Sad&quot;.

==Endorsements==
In January 2005, Twain joined Scentstories by Febreze to create a limited edition scent disc with the proceeds going to Feeding America, formerly America&#x27;s Second Harvest. In late 2005 she partnered with Coty to produce her namesake fragrance &quot;Shania&quot; by Stetson. A second fragrance was released in September 2007 called &quot;Shania Starlight&quot;. On January 1, 2010, she carried the Olympic Torch through her hometown as part of the 2010 Winter Olympics torch relay.

==Personal life==
Twain met producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange after he heard her original songs and singing from her debut album; he offered to produce and write songs with her. Having spoken on the phone for many months, they met at Nashville&#x27;s Fan Fair in June 1993 and became close. They were married on December 28, 1993, and had a son, Eja (pronounced &quot;Asia&quot;), on August 12, 2001. On May 15, 2008, it was announced that they were separating after Lange had an affair with Twain&#x27;s best friend, Marie-Anne Thiébaud. Their divorce was finalized on June 9, 2010. On December 20, 2010, it was reported that Twain was engaged to Swiss Nestlé executive Frédéric Thiébaud, Marie-Anne&#x27;s former husband. They were married on January 1, 2011, in Rincón, Puerto Rico.

She is a vegetarian and a devotee of Sant Mat, an Eastern spiritual philosophy. In 2010 she created Shania Kids Can, a charity designed to address the needs of neglected children who are frequently overlooked by social assistance programs. Her autobiography, &quot;From This Moment On&quot;, was published on March 27, 2011. She is a long-time resident of Corseaux, Switzerland, where her son was born, and she also owns properties in Las Vegas and the Bahamas. When performing in North America, she will sometimes wear the jersey of the local National Hockey League team.

<text>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is a format for describing multimedia communication sessions for the purposes of announcement and invitation. Its predominant use is in support of streaming media applications, such as voice over IP (VoIP) and video conferencing. SDP does not deliver any media streams itself but is used between endpoints for negotiation of network metrics, media types, and other associated properties. The set of properties and parameters is called a &quot;session profile&quot;.

SDP is extensible for the support of new media types and formats. SDP was originally a component of the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP), but found other uses in conjunction with the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), the Real-time Streaming Protocol (RTSP), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and as a standalone protocol for describing multicast sessions.

The IETF published the original specification as a Proposed Standard in April 1998 (RFC 2327). Revised specifications were released in 2006 (RFC 4566), and in 2021 (RFC 8866). 

==Session description==
The Session Description Protocol describes a session as a group of fields in a text-based format, one field per line. The form of each field is as follows.

Where codice_1 is a single case-sensitive character and codice_2 is structured text in a format that depends on the character. Values are typically UTF-8 encoded. Whitespace is not allowed immediately to either side of the equal sign.

Session descriptions consist of three sections: session, timing, and media descriptions. Each description may contain multiple timing and media descriptions. Names are only unique within the associated syntactic construct.

Fields must appear in the order shown; optional fields are marked with an asterisk:
* &quot;Session description&quot;
 v= (protocol version number, currently only 0)
 o= (originator and session identifier : username, id, version number, network address)
 s= (session name : mandatory with at least one UTF-8-encoded character)
 i=* (session title or short information)
 u=* (URI of description)
 e=* (zero or more email address with optional name of contacts)
 p=* (zero or more phone number with optional name of contacts)
 c=* (connection information—not required if included in all media)
 b=* (zero or more bandwidth information lines)
 &quot;One or more time descriptions (&quot;t=&quot; and &quot;r=&quot; lines; see below)&quot;
 z=* (time zone adjustments)
 k=* (encryption key)
 a=* (zero or more session attribute lines)
 &quot;Zero or more Media descriptions (each one starting by an &quot;m=&quot; line; see below)&quot;

* &quot; (mandatory)
 t= (time the session is active)
 r=* (zero or more repeat times)

* &quot; (optional)
 m= (media name and transport address)
 i=* (media title or information field)
 c=* (connection information — optional if included at session level)
 b=* (zero or more bandwidth information lines)
 k=* (encryption key)
 a=* (zero or more media attribute lines — overriding the Session attribute lines)

Below is a sample session description from RFC 4566. This session is originated by the user &quot;jdoe&quot;, at IPv4 address 10.47.16.5. Its name is &quot;SDP Seminar&quot; and extended session information (&quot;A Seminar on the session description protocol&quot;) is included along with a link for additional information and an email address to contact the responsible party, Jane Doe. This session is specified to last for two hours using NTP timestamps, with a connection address (which indicates the address clients must connect to or — when a multicast address is provided, as it is here — subscribe to) specified as IPv4 224.2.17.12 with a TTL of 127. Recipients of this session description are instructed to only receive media. Two media descriptions are provided, both using RTP Audio Video Profile. The first is an audio stream on port 49170 using RTP/AVP payload type 0 (defined by RFC 3551 as PCMU), and the second is a video stream on port 51372 using RTP/AVP payload type 99 (defined as &quot;dynamic&quot;). Finally, an attribute is included which maps RTP/AVP payload type 99 to format h263-1998 with a 90 kHz clock rate. RTCP ports for the audio and video streams of 49171 and 51373, respectively, are implied.

 v=0
 o=jdoe 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 10.47.16.5
 s=SDP Seminar
 i=A Seminar on the session description protocol
 u=http://www.example.com/seminars/sdp.pdf
 e=j.doe@example.com (Jane Doe)
 c=IN IP4 224.2.17.12/127
 t=2873397496 2873404696
 a=recvonly
 m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 0
 m=video 51372 RTP/AVP 99
 a=rtpmap:99 h263-1998/90000

The SDP specification is purely a format for session description. It is intended to be distributed over different transport protocols as necessary, including SAP, SIP, and RTSP. SDP could even be transmitted by email or as an HTTP payload.

==Attributes==
SDP uses attributes to extend the core protocol. Attributes can appear within the Session or Media sections and are scoped accordingly as &quot;session-level&quot; or &quot;media-level&quot;. New attributes are added to the standard occasionally through registration with IANA.

Attributes are either properties or values:
*Property: a=&quot;flag&quot; conveys a Boolean property of the media or session.
*Value: a=&quot;attribute&quot;:&quot;value&quot; provides a named parameter.

Two of these attributes are specially defined:
* a=charset:&quot;encoding&quot; is used in the session or media sections to specify a different character encoding (as registered in the IANA registry) from the recommended default value (&quot;UTF-8&quot;) for standard protocol keys. These values contain a text that is intended to be displayed to a user.
* a=sdplang:&quot;code&quot; is used to specify the language of text. Alternate text in multiple languages may be carried in the session, and selected automatically by the user agent according to user preferences.
In both cases, text fields intended to be displayed to a user are interpreted as opaque strings, but rendered to the user or application with the values indicated in the last occurrence of the fields &quot;charset&quot; and &quot;sdplang&quot; in the current media section, or otherwise their last value in the session section.

The parameters &quot;v&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, and &quot;o&quot; are mandatory, must not be empty, and should be UTF-8-encoded. They are used as identifiers and are not intended to be displayed to users.

A few other attributes are also present in the example, either as a session-level attribute (such as the attribute in property form &quot;a=recvonly&quot;), or as a media-level attribute (such as the attribute in value form &quot;a=rtpmap:99 h263-1998/90000&quot; for the video in the example).

==Time formats and repetitions==
Absolute times are represented in Network Time Protocol (NTP) format (the number of seconds since 1900). If the stop time is 0 then the session is &quot;unbounded&quot;. If the start time is also zero then the session is considered &quot;permanent&quot;. Unbounded and permanent sessions are discouraged but not prohibited.
Intervals can be represented with NTP times or in typed time: a value and time units (days: &quot;d&quot;, hours: &quot;h&quot;, minutes: &quot;m&quot; and seconds: &quot;s&quot;) sequence.

Thus an hour meeting from 10 am UTC on 1 August 2010, with a single repeat time a week later at the same time can be represented as:
 t= 
 r=604800 3600 0

Or using typed time:
 t= 
 r=7d 1h 0

When repeat times are specified, the start time of each repetition may need to be adjusted to compensate for daylight saving time changes so that it will occur at the same local time in a specific time zone throughout the period between the start time and the stop time.

Instead of specifying this time zone and having to support a database of time zones for knowing when and where daylight adjustments will be needed, the repeat times are assumed to be all defined within the same time zone, and SDP supports the indication of NTP absolute times when a daylight offset (expressed in seconds or using a type time) will need to be applied to the repeated start time or end time falling at or after each daylight adjustment. All these offsets are relative to the start time, they are not cumulative. NTP supports this with field &quot;z&quot;, which indicates a series of pairs whose first item is the NTP absolute time when a daylight adjustment will occur, and the second item indicates the offset to apply relative to the absolute times computed with the field &quot;r&quot;.

For example, if a daylight adjustment will subtract 1 hour on 31 October 2010 at 3 am UTC (i.e. 60 days minus 7 hours after the start time on Sunday 1 August 2010 at 10am UTC), and this will be the only daylight adjustment to apply in the scheduled period which would occur between 1 August 2010 up to the 28 November 2010 at 10 am UTC (the stop time of the repeated 1-hour session which is repeated each week at the same local time, which occurs 88 days later), this can be specified as:
 t= 
 r=7d 1h 0
 z= -1h

If the weekly 1-hour session was repeated every Sunday for one full year, i.e. from Sunday 1 August 2010 3 am UTC to Sunday 26 June 2011 4 am UTC (stop time of the last repeat, i.e. 360 days plus 1 hour later, or 31107600 seconds later), so that it would include the transition back to Summer time on Sunday 27 March 2011 at 2 am (1 hour is added again to local time so that the second daylight transition would occur 209 days after the first start time):
 t= 
 r=7d 1h 0
 z= -1h 0

As SDP announcements for repeated sessions should not be made to cover very long periods exceeding a few years, the number of daylight adjustments to include in the z= parameter should remain small.

Sessions may be repeated irregularly over a week but scheduled the same way for all weeks in the period, by adding more tuples in the &quot;r&quot; parameter. For example, to schedule the same event also on Saturday (at the same time of the day) you would use:
 t= 
 r=7d 1h 0 6d
 z= -1h 0

The SDP protocol does not support repeating sessions monthly and yearly schedules with such simple repeat times, because they are irregularly spaced in time; instead, additional &quot;t&quot;/&quot;r&quot; tuples may be supplied for each month or year.

<text>The Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) is an experimental protocol for advertising multicast session information. SAP typically uses Session Description Protocol (SDP) as the format for Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) session descriptions. Announcement data is sent using IP multicast and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

Under SAP, senders periodically transmit SDP descriptions to a well-known multicast address and port number (9875). A listening application constructs a guide of all advertised multicast sessions.

SAP was published by the IETF as RFC 2974.

==Announcement interval==
The announcement interval is cooperatively modulated such that all SAP announcements in the multicast delivery scope, by default, consume 4000 bits per second. Regardless, the maximum announce interval is 300 seconds (5 minutes). Announcements automatically expire after 10 times the announcement interval or one hour, whichever is greater. Announcements may also be explicitly withdrawn by the original issuer.

==Authentication, encryption and compression==
SAP features separate methods for authenticating and encrypting announcements. Use of encryption is not recommended. Authentication prevents unauthorized modification and other DoS attacks. Authentication is optional. Two authentication schemes are supported:
*Pretty Good Privacy as defined in RFC 2440
*Cryptographic Message Syntax as defined in RFC 5652

The message body may optionally be compressed using the zlib format as defined in RFC 1950.

==Applications and implementations==
VLC media player monitors SAP announcements and presents the user a list of available streams.

SAP is one of the optional discovery and connection management techniques described in the AES67 audio-over-Ethernet interoperability standard.

<text>Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL ()) is a World Wide Web Consortium recommended Extensible Markup Language (XML) markup language to describe multimedia presentations. It defines markup for timing, layout, animations, visual transitions, and media embedding, among other things. SMIL allows presenting media items such as text, images, video, audio, links to other SMIL presentations, and files from multiple web servers. SMIL markup is written in XML, and has similarities to HTML.

Members of the World Wide Web Consortium (also known as the &quot;W3C&quot;) created SMIL for streaming media presentations, and published SMIL 1.0 in June 1998. Many of these W3C members helped author several versions of SMIL specifications between 1996 (when the first multimedia workshops were hosted by the W3C) and 2008 (when SMIL 3.0 was published). SMIL is an XML-based application, and is a part of many Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) applications. SMIL can be combined with other XML-based specifications such as with SVG (as has been done with SVG animation) and with XHTML (as done with HTML+TIME). 
== Version history ==
, the W3C Recommendation for SMIL is &quot;SMIL 3.0&quot;.

=== SMIL 1.0 ===
SMIL 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation on 15 June 1998.

=== SMIL 2.0 ===
&quot;SMIL 2.0&quot; became a W3C Recommendation on 9 August 2001. SMIL 2.0 introduced a modular language structure that facilitated integration of SMIL semantics into other XML-based languages. Basic animation and timing modules were integrated into Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and the SMIL modules formed a basis for Timed-Text. The modular structure made it possible to define the standard SMIL language profile and the XHTML+SMIL language profile with common syntax and standard semantics.

=== SMIL 2.1 ===
&quot;SMIL 2.1&quot; became a W3C Recommendation on 13 December 2005. SMIL 2.1 includes a small number of extensions based on practical experience gathered using SMIL in the Multimedia Messaging System on mobile phones.

=== SMIL 3.0 ===
&quot;SMIL 3.0&quot; became a W3C Recommendation in December 2008. It was first submitted as a W3C Working draft on December 21, 2006. The last draft revision was released on October 6, 2008.

== SMIL documents ==
A SMIL document is similar in structure to an HTML document in that they are typically divided between an optional codice_1 section and a required codice_2 section. The codice_1 section contains layout and metadata information. The codice_2 section contains the timing information, and is generally composed of combinations of three main tags—sequential (&quot;codice_5&quot;, simple playlists), parallel (&quot;codice_6&quot;, multi-zone/multi-layer playback) and exclusive (&quot;codice_7&quot;, event-triggered interrupts). SMIL refers to media objects by URLs, allowing them to be shared between presentations and stored on different servers for load balancing. The language can also associate different media objects with different bandwidth requirements.

For playback scheduling, SMIL supports ISO-8601 codice_8 date/time specification to define begin/end events for playlists.

SMIL files take either a codice_9 or codice_10 file extension. However, SAMI files and Macintosh self mounting images also use codice_9, which creates some ambiguity at first glance. As a result, SMIL files commonly use the codice_10 file extension to avoid confusion.

==Combination with other XML-based standards==
SMIL was created during a time when structured data using XML was very popular and during a time when Internet Explorer was very popular. Thus &quot;combining&quot; SMIL with other markup languages was considered one of the best current practices of the day.

===SMIL+SVG===


SMIL is one of three means by which SVG animation can be achieved (the others being JavaScript and CSS animations).

===SMIL+RSS or other web syndication methods===
While RSS and Atom are web syndication methods, with the former being more popular as a syndication method for podcasts, SMIL is potentially useful as a script or playlist that can tie sequential pieces of multimedia together and can then be syndicated through RSS or Atom. In addition, the combination of multimedia-laden .smil files with RSS or Atom syndication would be useful for accessibility to audio-enabled podcasts by the deaf through Timed Text closed captions, and can also turn multimedia into hypermedia that can be hyperlinked to other linkable audio and video multimedia.

===SMIL+VoiceXML and SMIL+MusicXML===
VoiceXML can be combined with SMIL to provide a sequential reading of several pre-provided pages or slides in a voice browser, while combining SMIL with MusicXML would allow for the creation of infinitely-recombinable sequences of music sheets. Combining SMIL+VoiceXML or SMIL+MusicXML with RSS or Atom could be useful in the creation of an audible pseudo-podcast with embedded hyperlinks, while combining SMIL+SVG with VoiceXML and/or MusicXML would be useful in the creation of an automatically audio-enabled vector graphics animation with embedded hyperlinks.

=== SMIL+TEI ===

SMIL is anticipated for use within Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) documents.

==Status of SMIL==
SMIL is being implemented on handheld and mobile devices and has also spawned the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) which is a video and picture equivalent of Short Message Service (SMS).

SMIL is also one of the underlying technologies used for &quot;Advanced Content&quot; in the (discontinued) HD DVD format for adding interactive content (menus etc.).

The field of Digital Signage is embracing SMIL as a means of controlling dynamic advertising in public areas.

Most commonly used web browsers have native support for SMIL, but it has not been implemented in Microsoft browsers. It was to be deprecated in Google Chrome, but it has now been decided to suspend that intent until alternatives are sufficiently developed. Other software that implement SMIL playback include:

* Adobe Media Player
* Amarok
* Garlic Player
* Helix Player
* QuickTime Player
* RealPlayer
* Totem
* Windows Media Player (Playlist Files)
* Zune (Playlist Files)

===Hardware===

* IAdea XMP-300 media player
* IAdea XMP-7300 media player (with limitations)
*Planar MP70 media player (with limitations)
* SpinetiX HMP400 / HMP350 / HMP300 Hyper Media Player (SMIL 3.0 support)
* Thomson/Grass Valley MediaEdge-3 player
* ViewSonic NMP-550 media player
* ViewSonic EP1020r wireless display+player (supporting a subset of SMIL)
* Innes DMC200 media player
* Innes DME204 media player with HD H264 encoder embedded

Media player boxes based on dedicated 1080p decoder chips such as the Sigma Designs 8634 processor are getting SMIL players embedded in them.

===Embedding SMIL files into XHTML web pages===

A SMIL file must be embedded, then opened using a plug-in such as Apple&#x27;s QuickTime or Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Media Player, to be viewed by a browser that doesn&#x27;t support SMIL.

<text>SECAM, also written SÉCAM (, &quot;Séquentiel de couleur à mémoire&quot;, French for &quot;color sequential with memory&quot;), is an analog color television system that was used in France, Russia and some other countries or territories of Europe and Africa. It was one of three major analog color television standards, the others being PAL and NTSC. Like PAL, a SECAM picture is also made up of 625 interlaced lines and is displayed at a rate of 25 frames per second (except SECAM-M). However, due to the way SECAM processes color information, it is not compatible with the PAL video format standard. SECAM video is composite video; the luminance (luma, monochrome image) and chrominance (chroma, color applied to the monochrome image) are transmitted together as one signal.

All the countries using SECAM have either converted to Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB), the new pan-European standard for digital television, or are currently in the process of conversion. SECAM remained a major standard into the 2000s.

== History ==
=== Invention ===
Development of SECAM predates PAL, and began in 1956 by a team led by Henri de France working at &quot;Compagnie Française de Télévision&quot; (later bought by Thomson, now Technicolor). NTSC was considered undesirable in Europe because of its tint problem, requiring an additional control, which SECAM (and PAL) solved.

Some have argued that the primary motivation for the development of SECAM in France was to protect French television equipment manufacturers. However, incompatibility had started with the earlier unusual decision to adopt positive video modulation for 819-line French broadcast signals (only the UK&#x27;s 405-line was similar; widely adopted 525- and 625-line systems used negative video).

The first proposed system was called SECAM I in 1961, followed by other studies to improve compatibility and image quality, but it was too soon for a wide introduction. A version of SECAM for the French 819-line television standard was devised and tested, but never introduced.

Following a pan-European agreement to introduce color TV only on 625-line broadcasts, France had to switch to that system, which happened in 1963 with the introduction of &quot;la deuxième chaîne ORTF&quot; France 2, the second national TV network.

Further improvements during 1963 and 1964 to the standard were called SECAM II and SECAM III, with the latter being presented at the 1965 CCIR General Assembly in Vienna, and adopted by France and the Soviet Union.

Soviet technicians were involved in a separate development of the standard, creating an incompatible variant called NIIR or SECAM IV, which was not deployed. The team was working in Moscow&#x27;s Telecentrum. The NIIR designation comes from the name of the &quot;Nautchno-Issledovatelskiy Institut Radio&quot; (&quot;NIIR&quot;, &quot;rus.&quot; Научно-Исследовательский Институт Радио), a Soviet research institute involved in the studies. Two standards were developed: &quot;Non-linear NIIR&quot;, in which a process analogous to gamma correction is used, and &quot;Linear NIIR&quot; or &quot;SECAM IV&quot; that omits this process. SECAM IV was proposed by France and USSR at the 1966 Oslo CCIR conference and demonstrated in London.

Further improvements were SECAM III A, followed by SECAM III B, the system adopted for general use in 1967.

=== Implementation ===
Tested until 1963 on the second French national network &quot;la deuxième chaîne ORTF&quot;, the SECAM standard was adopted in France and launched on 1 October 1967, now called France 2. A group of four suited men—a presenter (Georges Gorse, Minister of Information) and three contributors to the system&#x27;s development—were shown standing in a studio. Following a count from 10, at 2:15 pm the black-and-white image switched to color; the presenter then declared &quot;Et voici la couleur !&quot; (fr: And here is color!) In the same year of 1967, CLT of Lebanon became the third television station in the world, after France 2 in France and the Soviet Central Television in the Soviet Union, to broadcast in color utilizing the French SECAM technology.

The first color television sets cost 5000 francs. Color TV was not very popular initially; only about 1500 people watched the inaugural program in color. A year later in 1968, only 200,000 sets had been sold of an expected million. This pattern was similar to the earlier slow build-up of color television popularity in the US.

In March 1969, East Germany decided to adopt SECAM III B. The adoption of SECAM in Eastern Europe has been attributed to Cold War political machinations. According to this explanation, East German political authorities were well aware of West German television&#x27;s popularity and adopted SECAM rather than the PAL encoding used in West Germany. This did not hinder mutual reception in black and white, because the underlying TV standards remained essentially the same in both parts of Germany. However, East Germans responded by buying PAL decoders for their SECAM sets. Eventually, the government in East Berlin stopped paying attention to so-called &quot;Republikflucht via Fernsehen&quot;, or &quot;defection via television&quot;. Later East German–produced TV sets, such as the RFT Chromat, even included a dual standard PAL/SECAM decoder as an option.

Another explanation for the Eastern European adoption of SECAM, led by the Soviet Union, is that the Russians had extremely long distribution lines between broadcasting stations and transmitters. Long co-axial cables or microwave links can cause amplitude and phase variations, which do not affect SECAM signals.

Other countries, notably the United Kingdom and Italy, briefly experimented with SECAM before opting for PAL. SECAM was adopted by former French and Belgian colonies in Africa, as well as Greece, Cyprus, and Eastern Bloc countries (except for Romania) and some Middle Eastern countries.

European efforts during the 1980–90s towards the creation of a unified analog standard, resulting in the MAC standards, still used the sequential color transmission idea of SECAM, with only one of time-compressed U and V components being transmitted on a given line. The D2-MAC standard enjoyed some short real market deployment, particularly in northern European countries. To some extent, this idea is still present in 4:2:0 digital sampling format, which is used by most digital video media available to the public. In this case, however, color resolution is halved in both horizontal and vertical directions thus yielding a more symmetrical behavior.

=== Decline ===
With the fall of communism and following a period when multi-standard TV sets became a commodity in the early 2000s, many Eastern European countries decided to switch to the West German-developed PAL system. Yet SECAM remained in use in Russia, Belarus and the French-speaking African countries. In the late 2000s, SECAM started a process of being phased out and replaced by DVB.

Unlike some other manufacturers, the company where SECAM was invented, Technicolor (known as Thomson until 2010), still sold television sets worldwide under different brands until the company sold its Trademark Licensing operations in 2022; this may be due in part to the legacy of SECAM. Thomson bought the company that developed PAL, Telefunken, and even co-owned the RCA brand – RCA being the creator of NTSC. Thomson also co-authored the ATSC standards which are used for American high-definition television.

== Design ==
Just as with the other color standards adopted for broadcast usage over the world, SECAM is a standard that permits existing monochrome television receivers predating its introduction to continue to be operated as monochrome televisions. Because of this compatibility requirement, color standards added a second signal to the basic monochrome signal, which carries the color information. The color information is called chrominance or formula_1 for short, while the black-and-white information is called the luminance or formula_2 for short. Monochrome television receivers only display luminance, while color receivers process both signals. The YDbDr color space is used to encode the mentioned formula_2 (luminance) and formula_4 (red and blue color difference signals that make up chrominance) components.

Additionally, for compatibility, it is required to use no more bandwidth than the monochrome signal alone; the color signal has to be somehow inserted into the monochrome signal, without disturbing it. This insertion is possible because the bandwidth of the monochrome TV signal is generally not fully utilized; the high-frequency portions of the signal, corresponding to fine details in the image, were often not recorded by contemporary video equipment, or not visible on consumer televisions anyway, especially after transmission. This section of the spectrum was thus used to carry color information, at the cost of reducing the possible resolution.

European monochrome standards were not compatible when SECAM was first being considered. France had introduced an 819-line system that used 14 MHz of bandwidth (System E), much more than the 5 MHz standard used in the UK (System A) or the 6 MHz in the US (System M). The closest thing to a standard in Europe at the time was the 8 MHz 625-line system (System D), which had originated Germany and the Soviet Union and quickly became one of the most used systems. An effort to harmonize European broadcasts on the 625-line system started in the 1950s and was first implemented in Ireland in 1962 (System I).

SECAM thus had the added issue of having to be compatible both with their existing 819-line system as well as their future broadcasts on the 625-line system. As the latter used much less bandwidth, it was this standard that defined the amount of color information that could be carried. In the 8 MHz standard, the signal is split into two parts, the video signal, and the audio signal, each with its own carrier frequency. For any given channel, one carrier is located 1.25 MHz above the channel&#x27;s listed frequency and indicates the location of the luminance portion of the signal. A second carrier is located 6 MHz above the luma carrier, indicating the center of the audio signal.

To add color to the signal, SECAM adds another carrier located 4.4336... MHz above the luma carrier. The chroma signal is centered on this carrier, overlapping the upper part of the luma frequency range. Because the information of most scan lines differ little from their immediate neighbors, both luma and chroma signals are close to being periodic on the horizontal scan frequency, and thus their power spectra tends to be concentrated on multiples of such frequency. The specific color carrier frequency of SECAM results from carefully choosing it so that the higher-powered harmonics of the modulated chroma and luma signals are apart from each other and from the sound carrier, thereby minimizing crosstalk between the three signals.

The color space perceived by humans is three-dimensional because of the nature of their retinas, which include specific detectors for red, green and blue light. So in addition to luminance, which is already carried by the existing monochrome signal, color requires sending two additional signals. The human retina is more sensitive to green light than to red (3:1) or blue (9:1) light. Because of this, the red (formula_5) and blue (formula_6) signals are usually chosen to be sent along luma but with comparably less resolution, to be able to save bandwidth while impacting the perceived image quality the least. (Also, the green signal is on average more closely correlated to luma, making them a poor choice of signal to send separately). To minimize crosstalk with luma and increase compatibility with existing monochrome TV sets, the formula_5 and formula_6 signals are usually sent as differences from luma (formula_2): formula_10 and formula_11. This way, for an image that contains little color, its color difference signals tend to zero and its color-encoded signal converges to its equivalent monochrome signal.

=== Colorimetry ===
SECAM colorimetry was similar to PAL, as defined by the ITU on REC-BT.470. Yet the same document indicates that for existing (at the time of revision, 1998) SECAM sets, the following parameters (similar to the original 1953 color NTSC specification) could be allowed:

The assumed display gamma was also defined as 2.8.

Luma (formula_12) is derived from red, green, and blue (formula_13) gamma pre-corrected primary signals:
* formula_14

formula_15 and formula_16 are red and blue color difference signals, used to calculate chrominance: 
* formula_17
* formula_18

=== Comparison to PAL and NTSC ===
SECAM differs significantly from the other color systems by the way the color difference signals are carried. In NTSC and PAL, each line carries color difference signals encoded using quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). To demodulate such a signal, knowledge of the phase of the carrier signal is needed. This information is sent along the video signal at the start of every scan line in the form of a short burst of the color carrier itself, called a &quot;colorburst&quot;. A phase error during QAM demodulation produces crosstalk between the color difference signals. On NTSC this creates Hue and Saturation errors, manually corrected for with a &quot;tint&quot; control on the receiving TV set; while PAL only suffers from Saturation errors. SECAM is free of this problem.

SECAM uses frequency modulation (FM) to encode chrominance information on the color carrier, which does not require knowledge of the carrier phase to demodulate. However, the simple FM scheme used allows the transmission of only one signal, not the two required for color. To address this, SECAM broadcasts formula_10 and formula_11 separately on alternating scan lines. To produce full color, the color information on one scan line is briefly stored in an analog delay line adjusted so the signal exits the delay at the precise start of the next line. This allows the television to combine the formula_10 signal transmitted on one line with the formula_11 on the next and thereby produce a full color gamut on every line. Because SECAM transmits only one chrominance component at a time, it is free of the color artifacts (&quot;dot crawl&quot;) present in NTSC and PAL that result from the combined transmission of color difference signals.

This means that the vertical color resolution of a field is halved compared to NTSC. However, the color signals of all color TV systems of the time were encoded in a narrower band than their luma signals, so color information had lower horizontal resolution compared to luma in all systems. This matches the human retina, which has higher luminance resolution than color resolution. On SECAM, the loss of vertical color resolution makes the color resolution closer to uniform in both axes and has little visual effect. The idea of reducing the vertical color resolution comes from Henri de France, who observed that color information is approximately identical for two successive lines. Because the color information was designed to be a cheap, backwards compatible addition to the monochrome signal, the color signal has a lower bandwidth than the luminance signal, and hence lower horizontal resolution. Fortunately, the human visual system is similar in design: it perceives changes in luminance at a higher resolution than changes in chrominance, so this asymmetry has minimal visual impact. It was therefore also logical to reduce the vertical color resolution. A similar paradox applies to the vertical resolution in television in general: reducing the bandwidth of the video signal will preserve the vertical resolution, even if the image loses sharpness and is smudged in the horizontal direction. Hence, video could be sharper vertically than horizontally. Additionally, transmitting an image with too much vertical detail will cause annoying flicker on interlaced television screens, as small details will only appear on a single line (in one of the two interlaced fields), and hence be refreshed at half the frequency. (This is a consequence of interlaced scanning that is obviated by progressive scan.) Computer-generated text and inserts have to be carefully low-pass filtered to prevent this.

The color difference signals in SECAM are calculated in the YDbDr color space, which is a scaled version of the YUV color space. This encoding is better suited to the transmission of only one signal at a time. FM modulation of the color information allows SECAM to be completely free of the dot crawl problem commonly encountered with the other analog standards. SECAM transmissions are more robust over longer distances than NTSC or PAL. However, owing to their FM nature, the color signal remains present, although at reduced amplitude, even in monochrome portions of the image, thus being subject to stronger cross color even though color crawl of the PAL type does not exist. Though most of the pattern is removed from PAL and NTSC-encoded signals with a comb filter (designed to segregate the two signals where the luma spectrum may overlap into the spectral space used by the chroma) by modern displays, some can still be left in certain parts of the picture. Such parts are usually sharp edges on the picture, sudden color or brightness changes along the picture or certain repeating patterns, such as a checker board on clothing. FM SECAM is a continuous spectrum, so unlike PAL and NTSC even a perfect digital comb filter could not entirely separate SECAM colour and luminance signals.

=== Disadvantages ===
Unlike PAL or NTSC, analog SECAM programming cannot easily be edited in its native analog form. Because it uses frequency modulation, SECAM is not linear with respect to the input image (this is also what protects it against signal distortion), so electrically mixing two (synchronized) SECAM signals does not yield a valid SECAM signal, unlike with analog PAL or NTSC. For this reason, to mix two SECAM signals, they must be demodulated, the demodulated signals mixed, and are remodulated again. Hence, post-production is often done in PAL, or in component formats, with the result encoded or transcoded into SECAM at the point of transmission. Reducing the costs of running television stations is one reason for some countries&#x27; switchovers to PAL.

Most TVs currently sold in SECAM countries support both SECAM and PAL, and more recently composite video NTSC as well (though not usually broadcast NTSC, that is, they cannot accept a broadcast signal from an antenna). Although the older analog camcorders (VHS, VHS-C) were produced in SECAM versions, none of the 8 mm or Hi-band models (S-VHS, S-VHS-C, and Hi-8) recorded it directly. Camcorders and VCRs of these standards sold in SECAM countries are internally PAL. The result could be converted back to SECAM in some models; most people buying such expensive equipment would have a multistandard TV set and as such would not need a conversion. Digital camcorders or DVD players (with the exception of some early models) do not accept or output a SECAM analog signal. However, this is of dwindling importance: since 1980 most European domestic video equipment uses French-originated SCART connectors, allowing the transmission of RGB signals between devices. This eliminates the legacy of PAL, SECAM, and NTSC color sub carrier standards.

In general, modern professional equipment is now all-digital, and uses component-based digital interconnects such as CCIR 601 to eliminate the need for any analog processing prior to the final modulation of the analog signal for broadcast. However, large installed bases of analog professional equipment still exist, particularly in third world countries.

== Varieties ==
=== Broadcast systems L, B/G, D/K, H, K, M ===
There are six varieties of SECAM, according to each of the broadcast system it was used with:
* SECAM-L: Used only in France, Luxembourg (only RTL9 on channel 21 from Dudelange) and Télé Monte-Carlo transmitters in the south of France.
* SECAM-B/G: Used in parts of the Middle East, former East Germany, Greece and Cyprus
* SECAM-D/K: Used in the Commonwealth of Independent States and most parts of Central and Eastern Europe (this is simply SECAM used with the D and K monochrome TV transmission standards) although most Central and Eastern European countries have now migrated to other systems.
* SECAM-H: Around 1983–1984 a new color identification standard (&quot;Line SECAM or SECAM-H&quot;) was introduced in order to make more space available inside the signal for adding teletext information (originally according to the Antiope standard). Identification bursts were made per-line (like in PAL) rather than per-picture. Very old SECAM TV sets might not be able to display colour for today&#x27;s broadcasts, although sets manufactured after the mid-1970s should be able to receive either variant.
* SECAM-K: The standard used in France&#x27;s overseas possessions (as well as African countries that were once ruled by France) was slightly different from the SECAM used in Metropolitan France. The SECAM standard used in Metropolitan France used the SECAM-L and a variant of the channel information for VHF channels 2–10. French overseas possessions and many French-speaking African countries use the SECAM-K1 standard and a mutually incompatible variant of the channel information for VHF channels 4-9 (not channels 2–10).
* SECAM-M: Between 1970 and 1991, SECAM-M was used in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam (Hanoi and other northern cities).

=== MESECAM (home recording) ===
MESECAM is a method of recording SECAM color signals onto VHS or Betamax video tape. It should not be mistaken for a broadcast standard.

&quot;Native&quot; SECAM recording (marketing term: &quot;SECAM-West&quot;) was devised for machines sold for the French (and adjacent countries) market. At a later stage, countries where both PAL and SECAM signals were available developed a cheap method of converting PAL video machines to record SECAM signals, using only the PAL recording circuitry. Although being a workaround, MESECAM is much more widespread than &quot;native&quot; SECAM. It has been the only method of recording SECAM signals to VHS in almost all countries that used SECAM, including the Middle East and all countries in Eastern Europe.

A tape produced by this method is not compatible with &quot;native&quot; SECAM tapes as produced by VCRs in the French market. It will play in black and white only, the color is lost. Most VHS machines advertised as &quot;SECAM capable&quot; outside France can be expected to be of the MESECAM variety only.

==== Technical details ====
On VHS tapes, the luminance signal is recorded FM-encoded (on VHS with reduced bandwidth, on S-VHS with full bandwidth) but the PAL or NTSC chrominance signal is too sensitive to small changes in frequency caused by inevitable small variations in tape speed to be recorded directly. Instead, it is first shifted down to the lower frequency of 630 kHz, and the complex nature of the PAL or NTSC sub-carrier means that the down conversion must be done via heterodyning to ensure that information is not lost.

The SECAM sub-carriers, which consist of two simple FM signals at 4.41 MHz and 4.25 MHz, do not need this (actually simple) processing. The VHS specification for &quot;native&quot; SECAM recording specifies that they be divided by 4 on recording to give sub carriers of approximately 1.1 MHz and 1.06 MHz, and multiplied by 4 on playback. A true dual-standard PAL and SECAM video recorder therefore requires two color processing circuits, adding to complexity and expense. Since some countries in the Middle East use PAL and others use SECAM, the region has adopted a shortcut, and uses the PAL mixer-down converter approach for both PAL and SECAM, simplifying VCR design.

Many PAL VHS recorders have had their analog tuner modified in French-speaking western Switzerland (Switzerland used the PAL-B/G standard while the bordering France used SECAM-L). The original tuner in those PAL recorders allows only PAL-B/G reception. The Swiss importers added a circuit with a specific IC for the French SECAM-L standard, making the tuner multi-standard and allowing the VCR to record SECAM broadcasts in MESECAM. A stamp mentioning &quot;PAL+SECAM&quot; was added to these machines.

Video recorders like Panasonic NV-W1E (AG-W1-P for professional), AG-W3, NV-J700AM, Aiwa HV-MX100, HV-MX1U, Samsung SV-4000W and SV-7000W feature a digital standard conversion circuitry.

== Adoption ==
A legacy list of SECAM users in 1998 is available on &quot;Recommendation ITU-R BT.470-6 - Conventional Television Systems, Appendix 1 to Annex 1&quot;, and the list before many OIRT countries migrated to PAL can be found at &quot;CCIR Report 624-3 Characteristics of television systems, Annex I&quot;.

Below is an updated list of nations that currently authorize the use of the SECAM standard for television broadcasting. It is subject to ongoing changes as nations move to PAL and DVB-T. These migrations are listed separately.

=== Migration to other standards ===

==== PAL ====
; Europe
* (migrated in 1994–1996)
* (migrated in 1992–1994)
* (switchover on 31 December 1991 after German reunification in 1990)
* (switchover ended in November 1999 with ETV and Kanal 2)
* (migrated in 2000s)
* (migrated in 1992)
* (migrated in 1995–1996)
* (migrated in 1997–1999)
* (migrated in 2002)
* (migrated in 1993–1995)
* (migrated in 1992–1994, simulcast in SECAM until early 2010s)

Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and the Baltic countries also changed their underlying sound carrier standard on the UHF band from D/K to B/G which is used in most of Western Europe, to facilitate use of imported broadcast equipment, while leaving the D/K standard on VHF. This required viewers to purchase multistandard receivers though. The other countries mentioned kept their existing standards (B/G in the cases of East Germany and Greece, D/K for the rest).

; Africa
* (For a few years before was simulcast)

; Asia
* (migrated in the 1990s)
* (migrated in late 1980s)
* (migrated in 2001)
* (migrated in 1991–1992, from SECAM-M to PAL-B/G)
* (reverted in 1998 to PAL-B/G)
* (migrated in the 1990s from SECAM-M)
* (migrated in 1993)
* (simulcast in NTSC, SECAM and PAL—before switching to PAL entirely in the late 1990s or early 2000s)
* (brief simulcast in NTSC)

<text>Smelts are a family of small fish, the Osmeridae, found in the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans, as well as rivers, streams and lakes in Europe, North America and Northeast Asia. They are also known as freshwater smelts or typical smelts to distinguish them from the related Argentinidae (herring smelts or argentines), Bathylagidae (deep-sea smelts), and Retropinnidae (Australian and New Zealand smelts).

Some smelt species are common in the North American Great Lakes, and in the lakes and seas of the northern part of Europe, where they run in large schools along the saltwater coastline during spring migration to their spawning streams. In some western parts of the United States, smelt populations have greatly declined in recent decades, leading to their protection under the Endangered Species Act. The Delta smelt (&quot;Hypomesus transpacificus&quot;) found in the Sacramento Delta of California, and the eulachon (&quot;Thaleichthys pacificus&quot;) found in the Northeast Pacific and adjacent rivers, are both protected from harvest.

Some species of smelts are among the few fish that sportsmen have been allowed to net, using hand-held dip nets, either along the coastline or in streams. Some sportsmen also ice fish for smelt. They are often fried and eaten whole.

The earliest known fossil smelt is &quot;Enoplophthalmus&quot; from the Early Oligocene of Europe; &quot;Speirsaenigma&quot; from the Paleocene of Canada may be an even earlier representative, although some authors instead consider it a relative of the ayu.

==Description==
In size, most species rarely exceed , although some grow larger. Some females of European smelt can reach in length.

Like salmon, many species are anadromous, living most of their lives in the sea, but traveling into fresh water to breed. However, a few exceptions, such as the surf smelt, spend their entire lives at sea.

==Smelt dipping==

In the Canadian provinces and U.S. states around the Great Lakes, &quot;smelt dipping&quot; is a common group sport in the early spring and when stream waters reach around . Fish are spotted using a flashlight or headlamp and scooped out of the water using a dip net made of nylon or metal mesh. The smelt are cleaned by removing the head and the entrails. Fins, scales, and bones of all but the largest of smelts are cooked without removal.

On the Maine coast, smelts were also a sign of spring, with the run of these small fish up tiny tidal estuaries. Many of these streams were narrow enough for a person to straddle and get a good catch of smelts by dipping a bucket.

==Culinary use==
=== North America ===
Smelts are an important winter catch in the saltwater mouths of rivers in New England and the Maritime Provinces of Canada. Fishermen would historically go to customary locations over the ice using horses and sleighs. Smelt taken out of the cold saltwater were preferred to those taken in warm water. The fish did not command a high price on the market, but provided a source of supplemental income due to their abundance. The smelts were &quot;flash frozen&quot; simply by leaving them on the ice and then sold to fish buyers who came down the rivers.

In the present day, smelts are fished commercially using nets at sea, and for recreation by hand-netting, spearing or angling them through holes in river ice. They are often the target fish of small &#x27;fishing shack&#x27; villages that spring up along frozen rivers. Typical ways of preparing them include pan-frying in flour and butter, deep-frying in batter and cooking them, directly out of the water, over small stoves in the shacks.

==== Canada ====

Indigenous peoples in Canada native to the Great Lakes regions (Lake Huron, Lake Ontario, and Lake Superior), as well as nearby Lake Erie (which still is well known for its smelts today), were both familiar and partially dependent upon smelts as a dietary source of protein and omega fats that didn&#x27;t require a large effort or hunting party to obtain. Smelts are one of the best choices of freshwater and saltwater fish to eat, as one of the types of edible fish with the lowest amount of mercury.

Smelts can be found in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as in some freshwater lakes across Canada. Smelts were eaten by many different native peoples who had access to them. One popular way that First Nations of the Pacific coast made dried smelts more appealing was to serve it with oil. Eulachon, a type of smelt, contains so much oil during spawning that, once dried, it can literally be burned like a candle; hence its common nickname of the &quot;candlefish&quot;.

Today, there are numerous recipes and methods of preparing and cooking smelts. A popular First Nations recipe calls for the removal of all the fishes&#x27; bones, uses canola or peanut oil for frying, and has a breaded-like coating mixed with lemon juice and grated parmesan cheese (with a few other basic ingredients) to coat the smelts prior to frying them.

=== East Asia ===

Smelt is popular in Japan, as the species &quot;Sprinchus lanceolatus&quot;, and is generally served grilled, called &quot;shishamo&quot;, especially when full of eggs.

Smelt roe, specifically from capelin, called masago in Japanese, is yellow to orange in color and is often used in sushi.

Smelt is also served in Chinese &quot;dim sum&quot; restaurants where it is deep fried with the heads and tails attached, identified as &quot;duō chūn yú&quot; () or &quot;duō luǎn yú&quot; (), &quot;many egg fish&quot; or which loosely translates as &quot;fish with many eggs&quot;.

Smelt is one of the prime fish species eaten in Tamil Nadu as Nethili fry, Nethili karuvadu (dried fish), coastal Karnataka, especially in Mangalore and Udupi regions, usually fried with heads and tailed removed or in curries. They are called &#x27;Bolingei&#x27; (ಬೊಳಂಜೆ) in Kannada and Tulu and &#x27;MotiyaLe&#x27; in Konkani.

==Festivals==
In the city of Inje, South Korea (Gangwon Province), an Ice Fishing Festival is held annually from 30 January to 2 February on Soyang Lake, coinciding with the smelt&#x27;s yearly run into fresh water to spawn. They are locally known as &quot;bing-eo&quot; (빙어) and typically eaten alive or deep-fried.

In Finland, the province of Paltamo has yearly &quot;Norssikarnevaali&quot; festivals in the middle of May.

For some Italians, especially from the region of Calabria, fried smelts are a traditional part of the Christmas Eve dinner consisting of multiple courses of fish.

In 1956, the Chamber of Commerce in Kelso, Washington, declared Kelso, located on the Cowlitz River, as the &quot;Smelt Capital of the World&quot;. They erected billboards proclaiming this, and held festivals for the annual smelt runs until the runs dried up.

The village of Lewiston, New York, on the lower portion of the Niagara River, celebrates an annual two-day smelt festival the first weekend in May. During the festival, approximately of smelt are battered and fried at the Lewiston Waterfront. The smelt samples are free during the festival and donations are welcome, as they help support programs supported by the Niagara River Anglers. The festival has a motto, which is a play on words: &quot;Lewiston never smelt so good.&quot;

Lithuania celebrates an annual weekend smelt festival in Palanga &quot;Palangos Stinta&quot; early every January.

The American Legion Post 82, in Port Washington, Wisconsin, has been hosting its annual Smelt Fry since 1951. Located on the Western shore of Lake Michigan, north of Milwaukee, Port Washington has a long history as a fishing community with commercial and sports ventures. The Legion&#x27;s Smelt Fry happens every year in mid to late April. In mid-July, the quaint town hosts their Fish Day event, billed as &quot;The world&#x27;s largest, one-day, outdoor fish fry!&quot;

At the time of the smelt&#x27;s spring run in the Neva River at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea in Saint Petersburg, a (&quot;Prazdnik koryushki&quot;) is celebrated.

The Magic Smelt Puppet Troupe of Duluth, Minnesota has held an annual &quot;Run, Smelt, Run!&quot; puppet-based second line parade, smelt fry, and dance party since 2012. The troupe occasionally hosts other performances throughout the year.

<text>The stethoscope is a medical device for auscultation, or listening to internal sounds of an animal or human body. It typically has a small disc-shaped resonator that is placed against the skin, with either one or two tubes connected to two earpieces. A stethoscope can be used to listen to the sounds made by the heart, lungs or intestines, as well as blood flow in arteries and veins. In combination with a manual sphygmomanometer, it is commonly used when measuring blood pressure.

Less commonly, &quot;mechanic&#x27;s stethoscopes&quot;, equipped with rod shaped chestpieces, are used to listen to internal sounds made by machines (for example, sounds and vibrations emitted by worn ball bearings), such as diagnosing a malfunctioning automobile engine by listening to the sounds of its internal parts. Stethoscopes can also be used to check scientific vacuum chambers for leaks and for various other small-scale acoustic monitoring tasks.

A stethoscope that intensifies auscultatory sounds is called a phonendoscope.

==History==


The stethoscope was invented in France in 1816 by René Laennec at the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris. It consisted of a wooden tube and was monaural. Laennec invented the stethoscope because he was not comfortable placing his ear directly onto a woman&#x27;s chest in order to listen to her heart. He observed that a rolled piece of paper, placed between the individual&#x27;s chest and his ear, could amplify heart sounds without requiring physical contact. Laennec&#x27;s device was similar to the common ear trumpet, a historical form of hearing aid; indeed, his invention was almost indistinguishable in structure and function from the trumpet, which was commonly called a &quot;microphone&quot;. Laennec called his device the &quot;stethoscope&quot; (&quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, &quot;chest scope&quot;), and he called its use &quot; auscultation&quot;, because it was auscultation with a tool intermediate between the individual&#x27;s body and the physician&#x27;s ear. (Today the word &quot;auscultation&quot; denotes all such listening, mediate or not.) The first flexible stethoscope of any sort may have been a binaural instrument with articulated joints not very clearly described in 1829. In 1840, Golding Bird described a stethoscope he had been using with a flexible tube. Bird was the first to publish a description of such a stethoscope, but he noted in his paper the prior existence of an earlier design (which he thought was of little utility) which he described as the snake ear trumpet. Bird&#x27;s stethoscope had a single earpiece.

=== Binaural devices ===
In 1851, Irish physician Arthur Leared invented a binaural stethoscope, and in 1852, George Philip Cammann perfected the design of the stethoscope instrument (that used both ears) for commercial production, which has become the standard ever since. Cammann also wrote a major treatise on diagnosis by auscultation, which the refined binaural stethoscope made possible. By 1873, there were descriptions of a differential stethoscope that could connect to slightly different locations to create a slight stereo effect, though this did not become a standard tool in clinical practice.

Somerville Scott Alison described his invention of the stethophone at the Royal Society in 1858; the stethophone had two separate bells, allowing the user to hear and compare sounds derived from two discrete locations. This was used to do definitive studies on binaural hearing and auditory processing that advanced knowledge of sound localization and eventually led to an understanding of binaural fusion.

The medical historian Jacalyn Duffin has argued that the invention of the stethoscope marked a major step in the redefinition of disease from being a bundle of symptoms, to the current sense of a disease as a problem with an anatomical system even if there are no observable symptoms. This re-conceptualization occurred in part, Duffin argues, because prior to stethoscopes, there were no non-lethal instruments for exploring internal anatomy.

Rappaport and Sprague designed a new stethoscope in the 1940s, which became the standard by which other stethoscopes are measured, consisting of two sides, one of which is used for the respiratory system, the other for the cardiovascular system. The Rappaport-Sprague was later made by Hewlett-Packard. HP&#x27;s medical products division was spun off as part of Agilent Technologies, Inc., where it became Agilent Healthcare. Agilent Healthcare was purchased by Philips which became Philips Medical Systems, before the walnut-boxed, $300, original Rappaport-Sprague stethoscope was finally abandoned ca. 2004, along with Philips&#x27; brand (manufactured by Andromed, of Montreal, Canada) electronic stethoscope model. The Rappaport-Sprague model stethoscope was heavy and short () with an antiquated appearance recognizable by their two large independent latex rubber tubes connecting an exposed leaf-spring-joined pair of opposing F-shaped chrome-plated brass binaural ear tubes with a dual-head chest piece.

Several other minor refinements were made to stethoscopes until, in the early 1960s, David Littmann, a Harvard Medical School professor, created a new stethoscope that was lighter than previous models and had improved acoustics. In the late 1970s, 3M-Littmann introduced the tunable diaphragm: a very hard (G-10) glass-epoxy resin diaphragm member with an overmolded silicone flexible acoustic surround which permitted increased excursion of the diaphragm member in a Z-axis with respect to the plane of the sound collecting area. The left shift to a lower resonant frequency increases the volume of some low frequency sounds due to the longer waves propagated by the increased excursion of the hard diaphragm member suspended in the concentric accountic surround. Conversely, restricting excursion of the diaphragm by pressing the stethoscope diaphragm surface firmly against the anatomical area overlying the physiological sounds of interest, the acoustic surround could also be used to dampen excursion of the diaphragm in response to &quot;z&quot;-axis pressure against a concentric fret. This raises the frequency bias by shortening the wavelength to auscultate a higher range of physiological sounds.

In 1999, Richard Deslauriers patented the first external noise reducing stethoscope, the DRG Puretone. It featured two parallel lumens containing two steel coils which dissipated infiltrating noise as inaudible heat energy. The steel coil &quot;insulation&quot; added .30 lb to each stethoscope. In 2005, DRG&#x27;s diagnostics division was acquired by TRIMLINE Medical Products.

==Current practice==

Stethoscopes are a symbol of healthcare professionals. Healthcare providers are often seen or depicted wearing a stethoscope around the neck. A 2012 research paper claimed that the stethoscope, when compared to other medical equipment, had the highest positive impact on the perceived trustworthiness of the practitioner seen with it.

Prevailing opinions on the utility of the stethoscope in current clinical practice vary depending on the medical specialty. Studies have shown that auscultation skill (i.e., the ability to make a diagnosis based on what is heard through a stethoscope) has been in decline for some time, such that some medical educators are working to re-establish it.

In general practice, traditional blood pressure measurement using a mechanical sphygmomanometer with inflatable cuff and stethoscope is gradually being replaced with automated blood pressure monitors.

==Types==

===Acoustic===

Acoustic stethoscopes operate on the transmission of sound from the chest piece, via air-filled hollow tubes, to the listener&#x27;s ears. The chestpiece usually consists of two sides that can be placed against the patient for sensing sound: a diaphragm (plastic disc) or bell (hollow cup). If the diaphragm is placed on the patient, body sounds vibrate the diaphragm, creating acoustic pressure waves which travel up the tubing to the listener&#x27;s ears. If the bell is placed on the patient, the vibrations of the skin directly produce acoustic pressure waves traveling up to the listener&#x27;s ears. The bell transmits low frequency sounds, while the diaphragm transmits higher frequency sounds. To deliver the acoustic energy primarily to either the bell or diaphragm, the tube connecting into the chamber between bell and diaphragm is open on only one side and can rotate. The opening is visible when connected into the bell. Rotating the tube 180 degrees in the head connects it to the diaphragm. This two-sided stethoscope was invented by Rappaport and Sprague in the early part of the 20th century.

===Electronic===
An electronic stethoscope (or stethophone) overcomes the low sound levels by electronically amplifying body sounds. However, amplification of stethoscope contact artifacts, and component cutoffs (frequency response thresholds of electronic stethoscope microphones, pre-amps, amps, and speakers) limit electronically amplified stethoscopes&#x27; overall utility by amplifying mid-range sounds, while simultaneously attenuating high- and low- frequency range sounds. Currently, a number of companies offer electronic stethoscopes. Electronic stethoscopes require conversion of acoustic sound waves to electrical signals which can then be amplified and processed for optimal listening. Unlike acoustic stethoscopes, which are all based on the same physics, transducers in electronic stethoscopes vary widely. The simplest and least effective method of sound detection is achieved by placing a microphone in the chestpiece. This method suffers from ambient noise interference and has fallen out of favor. Another method, used in Welch-Allyn&#x27;s Meditron stethoscope, comprises placement of a piezoelectric crystal at the head of a metal shaft, the bottom of the shaft making contact with a diaphragm. 3M also uses a piezo-electric crystal placed within foam behind a thick rubber-like diaphragm. The Thinklabs&#x27; Rhythm 32 uses an electromagnetic diaphragm with a conductive inner surface to form a capacitive sensor. This diaphragm responds to sound waves, with changes in an electric field replacing changes in air pressure. The Eko Core enables wireless transmission of heart sounds to a smartphone or tablet. The Eko Duo can take electrocardiograms as well as echocardiograms. This enables clinicians to screen for conditions such as heart failure, which would not be possible with a traditional stethoscope. 

Because the sounds are transmitted electronically, an electronic stethoscope can be a wireless device, can be a recording device, and can provide noise reduction, signal enhancement, and both visual and audio output. Around 2001, Stethographics introduced PC-based software which enabled a phonocardiograph, graphic representation of cardiologic and pulmonologic sounds to be generated, and interpreted according to related algorithms. All of these features are helpful for purposes of telemedicine (remote diagnosis) and teaching.

Electronic stethoscopes are also used with computer-aided auscultation programs to analyze the recorded heart sounds pathological or innocent heart murmurs.

====Recording====

Some electronic stethoscopes feature direct audio output that can be used with an external recording device, such as a laptop or MP3 recorder. The same connection can be used to listen to the previously recorded auscultation through the stethoscope headphones, allowing for more detailed study for general research as well as evaluation and consultation regarding a particular patient&#x27;s condition and telemedicine, or remote diagnosis.

There are some smartphone apps that can use the phone as a stethoscope. At least one uses the phone&#x27;s own microphone to amplify sound, produce a visualization, and e-mail the results. These apps may be used for training purposes or as novelties, but have not yet gained acceptance for professional medical use.

The first stethoscope that could work with a smartphone application was introduced in 2015 

===Fetal===

A &quot;fetal stethoscope&quot; or &quot;fetoscope&quot; is an acoustic stethoscope shaped like a listening trumpet. It is placed against the abdomen of a pregnant woman to listen to the heart sounds of the fetus. The fetal stethoscope is also known as a Pinard horn after French obstetrician Adolphe Pinard (1844–1934).

A Doppler stethoscope is an electronic device that measures the Doppler effect of ultrasound waves reflected from organs within the body. Motion is detected by the change in frequency, due to the Doppler effect, of the reflected waves. Hence the Doppler stethoscope is particularly suited to deal with moving objects such as a beating heart.
It was recently demonstrated that continuous Doppler enables the auscultation of valvular movements and blood flow sounds that are undetected during cardiac examination with a stethoscope in adults. The Doppler auscultation presented a sensitivity of 84% for the detection of aortic regurgitations while classic stethoscope auscultation presented a sensitivity of 58%. Moreover, Doppler auscultation was superior in the detection of impaired ventricular relaxation. Since the physics of Doppler auscultation and classic auscultation are different, it has been suggested that both methods could complement each other.
A military noise-immune Doppler based stethoscope has recently been developed for auscultation of patients in loud sound environments (up to 110 dB).

===3D-printed===

A 3D-printed stethoscope is an open-source medical device meant for auscultation and manufactured via means of 3D printing. The 3D stethoscope was developed by Dr. Tarek Loubani and a team of medical and technology specialists. The 3D-stethoscope was developed as part of the Glia project, and its design is open source from the outset. The stethoscope gained widespread media coverage in Summer 2015.

The need for a 3D-stethoscope was borne out of a lack of stethoscopes and other vital medical equipment because of the blockade of the Gaza Strip, where Loubani, a Palestinian-Canadian, worked as an emergency physician during the 2012 conflict in Gaza. The 1960s-era &quot;Littmann Cardiology 3&quot; stethoscope became the basis for the 3D-printed stethoscope developed by Loubani.

===Esophageal===
Prior to the 1960s, the esophageal stethoscope was a part of the routine intraoperative monitoring.

==Earpieces==

Stethoscopes usually have rubber earpieces, which aid comfort and create a seal with the ear, improving the acoustic function of the device. Stethoscopes can be modified by replacing the standard earpieces with moulded versions, which improve comfort and transmission of sound. Moulded earpieces can be cast by an audiologist or made by the stethoscope user from a kit.

<doc id="28715" wikidata="Q45165" url="?curid=28715" title="System of a Down">
<text>System of a Down is an Armenian-American heavy metal band formed in Glendale, California, in 1994. Since 1997, the band has consisted of founding members Serj Tankian (lead vocals, keyboards); Daron Malakian (guitar, vocals); Shavo Odadjian (bass, backing vocals); along with John Dolmayan (drums), who replaced original drummer Andy Khachaturian in 1997.

The band achieved commercial success with the release of five studio albums, three of which debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. System of a Down has been nominated for four Grammy Awards, and their song &quot;B.Y.O.B.&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2006. The band went on hiatus in 2006 and reunited in 2010. Other than two new songs in 2020 (&quot;Protect the Land&quot; and &quot;Genocidal Humanoidz&quot;), System of a Down has not released any new material since the &quot;Mezmerize&quot; and &quot;Hypnotize&quot; albums in 2005. The band has sold over 12 million records worldwide, while two of their singles, &quot;Aerials&quot; and &quot;Hypnotize&quot;, reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Alternative Songs chart.

All members of System of a Down are of Armenian descent, either born to Armenian immigrants or immigrants themselves.

== History ==
=== Soil (1992–1994) ===
Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian attended Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School as children. Due to their eight-year age difference, they did not meet until 1992 while working on separate projects at the same recording studio. They formed a band named Soil with Tankian on vocals and keyboards, Malakian on vocals and guitar, Dave Hakopyan (who later played in the band The Apex Theory/Mt. Helium) on bass and Domingo &quot;Dingo&quot; Laranio on drums. The band hired Shavo Odadjian (another Rose and Alex Pilibos alumnus) as manager, although he eventually joined Soil on second guitar. In 1994, after only one live show at the Roxy and one jam session recording, Hakopyan and Laranio left the band.

=== Demo tapes and signing (1994–1997) ===
After Soil split up, Tankian, Odadjian, and Malakian formed a new band, System of a Down. The group took its name from a poem that Malakian had written titled &quot;Victims of a Down&quot;. The word &quot;victims&quot; was changed to &quot;system&quot; because Odadjian believed that it would appeal to a much wider audience and also because the group wanted their records to be alphabetically shelved closer to their musical heroes, Slayer. Odadjian switched from guitar to bass and passed on his managerial duties to Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group and its founder David &quot;Beno&quot; Benveniste. The band recruited drummer Ontronik &quot;Andy&quot; Khachaturian, an old school friend of Malakian and Odadjian who had played with Malakian in a band called Snowblind during their teens.

In early 1995, System of a Down performed under the name Soil at the Cafe Club Fais Do-Do, a nightclub in Los Angeles. Shortly after the event, System of a Down made what is known as &quot;Untitled 1995 Demo Tape&quot;, which was not commercially released, but eventually appeared on file-sharing networks around the time of the band&#x27;s success with &quot;Toxicity&quot; about six years later. &quot;Demo Tape 2&quot; was released in 1996. At the beginning of 1997, System of a Down recorded their final publicly released demo tape, &quot;Demo Tape 3&quot;. In mid-1997, drummer Khachaturian left the band because of a hand injury (he subsequently co-founded The Apex Theory, which included former Soil bassist Dave Hakopyan). Khachaturian was replaced by John Dolmayan.

The band&#x27;s first official and professionally recorded song was on a collection called &quot;Hay Enk&quot; (&quot;We&#x27;re Armenian&quot; in English), an Armenian genocide recognition compilation in 1997. After playing at notable Hollywood clubs such as the Whisky a Go Go and Viper Room, the band caught attention of producer Rick Rubin, who asked them to keep in touch. Showing great interest, the group recorded &quot;Demo Tape 4&quot; near the end of 1997, specifically to be sent to record companies. Rubin signed the group to his American/Columbia Records, with the band celebrating the signing with a performance at The Roxy Theatre with Human Waste Project on September 12, 1997. Afterward, System began laying down tracks that would eventually be released on their debut album with engineer Sylvia Massy. &quot;I loved them,&quot; Rubin recalled. &quot;They were my favorite band, but I didn&#x27;t think anyone was going to like them apart from a small, likeminded group of people like me who were crazy. No one was waiting for an Armenian heavy metal band. It had to be so good that it transcended all of that.&quot;

In 1997, the group won the Best Signed Band Award from the Rock City Awards.

=== Self-titled album (1998–2000) ===
In June 1998, System of a Down released their debut album, &quot;System of a Down&quot;. They enjoyed moderate success as their first singles &quot;Sugar&quot; and &quot;Spiders&quot; became radio favorites and the music videos for both songs were frequently aired on MTV. After the release of the album, the band toured extensively, opening for Slayer on the Diabolus in Musica tour, behind Clutch, before making their way to the second stage of Ozzfest. Following Ozzfest, they toured with Fear Factory and Incubus before headlining the Sno-Core Tour with Puya, Mr. Bungle, The Cat and Incubus providing support.

In November 1998, System of a Down appeared on &quot;South Park&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Chef Aid&quot; album, providing the music for the song &quot;Will They Die 4 You?&quot; Near the end of the song, Tankian can be heard saying, &quot;Why must we kill our own kind?&quot; a line that would later be used in the song &quot;Boom!&quot; Although System of a Down is credited on the album, &quot;South Park&quot; character Chef does not introduce them as he does most of the other artists featured on the record.

=== &quot;Toxicity&quot; and &quot;Steal This Album!&quot; (2001–2003) ===

On September 3, 2001, System of a Down planned to launch their second album at a free concert in Hollywood as a &quot;thank you&quot; to fans. To a parking lot built for 3,500 people, about 10,000 more came, prompting the fire marshal to cancel without notice at the last minute. Fans waited for more than an hour for the group to appear, but when a banner hanging at the back of the stage that read &quot;System of a Down&quot; was removed by security, the audience rushed the stage, destroying all the band&#x27;s touring gear (approximately $30,000 worth of equipment) and began to riot, throwing rocks at police, breaking windows, and knocking over portable toilets. The riot lasted six hours, during which six arrests were made. The band&#x27;s manager, David &quot;Beno&quot; Benveniste, later said that the riot could have been avoided if the group had been permitted to perform or had they been allowed to make a statement at the concert regarding the cancellation. System of a Down&#x27;s scheduled in-store performance the next day was cancelled to prevent a similar riot.

The group&#x27;s big break arrived when their second album, &quot;Toxicity&quot;, debuted at No. 1 on the American and Canadian charts. The album has eventually achieved 3x multi-platinum certification in the United States. It was still on top in America during the week of the 9/11 attacks and the political environment caused by the attacks added to the controversy surrounding the album&#x27;s hit single &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;; the song was taken off the radio as it contained politically sensitive lyrics according to the 2001 Clear Channel memorandum at the time such as &quot;I don&#x27;t think you trust in my self-righteous suicide&quot;. Regardless, the video gained constant play on MTV as did the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Toxicity&quot;. Even with the controversy surrounding &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; (which earned a Grammy nomination), System of a Down still received constant airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with &quot;Toxicity&quot; and &quot;Aerials&quot;. In May 2006, VH1 listed &quot;Toxicity&quot; in the number 14 slot in the &quot;40 Greatest Metal Songs&quot;.

In 2001, the band went on tour with Slipknot throughout the United States. Following a performance in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Odadjian was allegedly harassed, ethnically intimidated, and was physically assaulted by security guards backstage, who then dragged him out of the venue. Odadjian received medical attention from police and later filed a suit against the security company. Despite the incident, the tour was a success and System of a Down and Slipknot went on the Pledge of Allegiance Tour together with Rammstein in 2001.

In late 2001, unreleased tracks from the &quot;Toxicity&quot; sessions made their way onto the Internet. This collection of tracks was dubbed &quot;Toxicity II&quot; by fans. The group released a statement that the tracks were unfinished material and subsequently released the final versions of the songs as their third album, &quot;Steal This Album!&quot;, which was released in November 2002. &quot;Steal This Album!&quot; resembled a burnable CD that was marked with a felt-tip marker. About 50,000 special copies of the album with different CD designs were also released, each designed by a different member of the band. The name of the album is a reference to Abbie Hoffman&#x27;s counter-culture book, &quot;Steal This Book&quot;, as well as a message to those who leaked the songs onto the Internet. The song &quot;Innervision&quot; was released as a promo single and received constant airplay on alternative radio. A video for &quot;Boom!&quot; was filmed with director Michael Moore as a protest against the War in Iraq.

=== &quot;Mezmerize&quot;, &quot;Hypnotize&quot;, band hiatus and side projects (2004–2008) ===

In 2004, the group recorded the follow-up to &quot;Steal This Album!&quot; a double album, which they released in separate installments six months apart. The releases notably included album cover artwork by Malakian&#x27;s father, Vartan Malakian, and were designed to connect the two separate album covers. The first album, &quot;Mezmerize,&quot; was released on May 17, 2005, to favorable reviews by critics. It debuted at No. 1 in the United States, Canada, Australia and all around the world, making it System of a Down&#x27;s second No. 1 album. First-week sales exceeded 800,000 copies worldwide. The lead single &quot;B.Y.O.B.&quot;, which questions the integrity of military recruiting in America, worked its way up the Billboard Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts, and would go on to win the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. &quot;Question!&quot; was released as the next single, with Shavo Odadjian co-directing the music video. Following the album&#x27;s release, the band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada with The Mars Volta and Bad Acid Trip supporting.

The second part of the double album, &quot;Hypnotize,&quot; was released on November 22, 2005. Like &quot;Mezmerize&quot;, it debuted at No. 1 in the US. With this release, System of a Down joined The Beatles and rappers 2Pac and DMX as the fourth artist ever to have two studio albums debut at No. 1 in the same year. &quot;Hypnotize&quot; was released as the lead single and was followed by &quot;Lonely Day&quot; and &quot;Vicinity of Obscenity&quot;, all three of which were also released as EPs, including several B-sides from 1999 to 2000, such as a collaboration with the Wu-Tang Clan, titled &quot;Shame&quot;. &quot;Kill Rock &#x27;N Roll&quot; was released as the final promotional single.

Whereas on System of a Down&#x27;s previous albums, most of the lyrics were written and sung by Tankian and the music was co-written by Tankian and Malakian (and sometimes Odadjian), much of the music and lyrics on &quot;Mezmerize&quot;/&quot;Hypnotize&quot; were written by Malakian, who also took on a much more dominant role as vocalist on both albums, often leaving Tankian providing keyboards and backing vocals.

System of a Down&#x27;s song &quot;Lonely Day&quot; was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in the 49th Grammy Awards in 2007 but lost to &quot;Woman&quot; by Wolfmother.

A biography of the band entitled &quot;System of a Down: Right Here in Hollywood&quot;, written by Ben Myers, was published in May 2006, later being published in the U.S. in 2007 through The Disinformation Company. Additionally in 2006, concert footage and interviews with the band concerning the importance of helping create awareness and recognition of the Armenian genocide were featured in the film &quot;Screamers,&quot; directed by Carla Garapedian. An interview with Tankian&#x27;s grandfather, a survivor of the genocide, was also included in the film as well as Tankian&#x27;s and Dolmayan&#x27;s meeting with then-Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert during which the two musicians campaigned for the United States government&#x27;s official recognition of the genocide. Footage of Tankian and Dolmayan marching with protesters outside the Turkish embassy in Washington, D.C., was also used in &quot;Screamers&quot;.

In May 2006, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Malakian confirmed the break would probably last a few years, which Odadjian specified as a minimum of three years in an interview with &quot;Guitar&quot; magazine. He told MTV, &quot;We&#x27;re not breaking up. If that was the case, we wouldn&#x27;t be doing this Ozzfest. We&#x27;re going to take a very long break after Ozzfest and do our own things. We&#x27;ve done System for over ten years, and I think it&#x27;s healthy to take some rest.&quot; System of a Down&#x27;s final performance before their separation took place on August 13, 2006, in West Palm Beach, Florida. &quot;Tonight will be the last show we play for a long time together,&quot; Malakian told the crowd during Sunday&#x27;s last performance. &quot;We&#x27;ll be back. We just don&#x27;t know when.&quot;

The band members continued with their own projects; Malakian formed a band called Scars on Broadway, which was joined by Dolmayan. After one self-titled album, the project became dormant and Dolmayan left the band. It released the long-awaited sophomore album in 2018, titled &quot;Dictator&quot;, under the name &quot;Daron Malakian and Scars on Broadway&quot;. Dolmayan, alongside working with Scars on Broadway, formed his own band, Indicator. Dolmayan has also opened Torpedo Comics, an online comic bookstore. Odadjian pursued his project with RZA of Wu-Tang Clan, a hip-hop group named AcHoZeN, worked on his urSESSION website/record label and performed as a member of funk legend George Clinton&#x27;s backing band. Meanwhile, Tankian opted for a solo career and released his debut solo album &quot;Elect the Dead&quot; in the autumn of 2007. He has continued releasing solo albums, recording them almost entirely by himself even after System of a Down had begun to reunite for tours.

=== Reunion and touring (2010–2020) ===
On November 29, 2010, following several weeks of Internet rumors, System of a Down officially announced that they would be reuniting for a string of large European festival dates in June 2011. Among the announced tour dates included UK&#x27;s Download Festival, Switzerland&#x27;s Greenfield Festival, Germany&#x27;s Rock am Ring/Rock im Park, Sweden&#x27;s Metaltown, Austria&#x27;s Nova Rock Festival and Finland&#x27;s Provinssirock. The reunion tour commenced on May 10, 2011, in Edmonton, Alberta. System&#x27;s first tour through Mexico and South America began on September 28, 2011, in Mexico City, ending in Santiago, Chile on October 7, 2011. From late February to early March 2012, they headlined five dates at Soundwave festival. The band have continued playing around the world. On August 11 and 12, 2012, they played the Heavy MTL and Heavy T.O. music festivals in Montreal and Toronto respectively. In August 2013, System of a Down played at the UK&#x27;s Reading and Leeds Festivals, among other festivals and venues that year.

System of a Down played their only 2013 U.S. performance at the Hollywood Bowl on July 29; tickets sold out hours after going on sale on March 22. On November 23, 2014, System of a Down announced the Wake Up The Souls Tour to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. The tour included a free concert in Republic Square in Yerevan, Armenia, on April 23, 2015, their first show in the country.
In a November 2016 interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, drummer John Dolmayan revealed that System of a Down was working on more than a dozen songs for their follow-up to the &quot;Mezmerize&quot; and &quot;Hypnotize&quot; albums. Although he stated that the band does not know when the album will be released, he added that, &quot;I want everyone on board and feeling good about it. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re trying to accomplish right now. There&#x27;s a tremendous amount of pressure on us, though, because it&#x27;s been 11 years—at least 12 by the time it comes out.&quot;

In a video Q&amp;A session with fans on July 2, 2017, Shavo Odadjian was asked about the status of the next album and he responded, &quot;I&#x27;m waiting for a new album too. It&#x27;s not happening. I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;s gonna be. Not right now.&quot; In a December 2017 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Serj Tankian said that System of a Down wrote some new material but was uncertain of what to do with it. He then said that he doesn&#x27;t want to commit to a new album due to the lack of committing to longform touring.

Malakian singled Tankian out as the reason no new album had yet been released. Tankian detailed his view of the band&#x27;s past and present conflicts and their overall situation, saying, &quot;As we couldn&#x27;t see eye to eye on all these points we decided to put aside the idea of a record altogether for the time being.&quot; Dolmayan blamed all of the members due to the personal and creative differences that have been preventing them from recording a new studio album. Tankian also expressed uncertainty on whether the new album would be made or not but did not rule out the possibility. He went on to describe how he imagined the album sounding: &quot;It&#x27;s gotta be organic, it&#x27;s gotta feel right in every way.&quot;

Odadjian said that the band has material written from &quot;like the last 10, 12 years&quot;, but expressed uncertainty on if it would form into a System of a Down album or not. He also said that Malakian and Tankian have visual differences on what the album should sound like, and that the band&#x27;s inner tension had been building far longer than fans would be aware, despite having love and respect for one another nonetheless. He would later say that there was no extant conflict between the members, expressing confidence that System of a Down would eventually record a new album and claimed that they have material written that would be their best to date. Tankian denied any talk of the band recording a new album.

Malakian explained that there was a mixture between the matter of different creative perspectives for the band&#x27;s hesitation to record a new studio album and the lack of desire to tour. He did not dismiss a possible new album in the more distant future. He felt that the fans don&#x27;t care that the band wasn&#x27;t making an album, &quot;but I think a lot of the fans just want an album.&quot; He expressed hopes that the members would get together and record new music but was content with the direction of his band Scars on Broadway, noting the members&#x27; good friendship, &quot;But at the same time, I don&#x27;t see that happening anytime soon that we&#x27;re all going to get together and make a new System of a Down album.&quot; Malakian said that Tankian and the rest of the band members have been unable to come to an agreement over how to go about making new music, but insisted that there was no negativity between them.

Despite System of a Down&#x27;s ability to perform live, Odadjian expressed disappointment at their inability to record new music, explaining that there has been new material written by the other members in the form of a possible new album. Without Tankian&#x27;s presence, no recordings had been made. He questioned why the band still has not made an album, citing creative differences as the problem. With the lack of commitment to record new music, Tankian was open to releasing a collection of previously unreleased System of a Down songs from past recording sessions if his bandmates agreed.

Dolmayan had started in 2014 a Kickstarter to fund a cover project, titled &quot;These Grey Men&quot;, alongside friend James Hazley. In 2020, he released the first single, a cover of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Street Spirit&quot;, on January 23. Avenged Sevenfold singer M. Shadows contributes vocals to the track; Tom Morello contributes the guitar solo at the song&#x27;s close. The second single features System of a Down bandmate Serj Tankian in a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Starman&quot;. The album, titled &quot;These Grey Men&quot;, was released on February 28, 2020. It consists of covers/reimaginations of other songs by artists such as Radiohead, AFI, Madonna, and Talking Heads, among others.

With the differences concerning the band members, Dolmayan became uncertain in wanting to make new music anymore. Although he did not want to put Tankian and Malakian at fault for the band&#x27;s inability to record a new album, he said, &quot;It takes four people to make this band, and it takes four people to unmake it. I think that we&#x27;re all to blame. I could just blame Daron and Serj, because, quite frankly, they&#x27;re the primary songwriters, so it&#x27;s easy to blame them. But it&#x27;s not just their fault. A lot of it is their fault, but it&#x27;s not just their fault.&quot; In an interview, Dolmayan exclaimed that putting the band on hiatus was a grave mistake: &quot;I never wanted System to take a hiatus. I think it was a disastrous move for us because we never reached our peak.&quot; Dolmayan believed that the band could have risen through the charts if they had just kept going. On December 17, 2020, Serj Tankian announced in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview that he would release an EP by the name of &quot;Elasticity&quot; under his own name. Tankian had planned to release the EP in October. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he released it in February 2021 instead. In the interview, he explained that the EP contains songs he had written for System of a Down that the band ultimately opted not to record.

=== Artsakh benefit singles and possible sixth studio album (2020–present) ===
On November 5, 2020, in response to the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, System of a Down released their first songs in 15 years, &quot;Protect the Land&quot; and &quot;Genocidal Humanoidz&quot;, both of which &quot;speak of a dire and serious war being perpetrated upon our cultural homelands of Artsakh and Armenia.&quot; Music videos were made for both singles, and &quot;Protect the Land&quot; marks the band&#x27;s first music video in 14 years, since &quot;Lonely Day&quot;. Proceeds from the songs were to help Armenia Fund and for humanitarian needs of displaced families from the war.

As for a possible new album, Dolmayan told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;If it was up to me, we&#x27;d have a new album every three years. But things aren&#x27;t up to me. I&#x27;m at the mercy of my team, and although I fought for it for many years with band members, I&#x27;ve accepted that it is what it is. We do have five albums and [now] two songs. We&#x27;ve accomplished a lot in our careers. If it ends at that, so be it.&quot; In the same interview, Malakian claimed that &quot;Protect the Land&quot; and &quot;Genocidal Humanoidz&quot; were originally going to be released under his own band Scars on Broadway. As the conflict came to fruition, System of a Down came back to release them instead. Malakian also said he does not see the band making new music anytime soon, saying that the singles were a &quot;one-off kind of thing&quot;. Shavo Odadjian spoke with &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; in a follow-up interview discussing the conception of the songs, stating, &quot;It was amazing... Even though we have had our differences, when we&#x27;re in there it&#x27;s just like brothers making music together, like it all started.&quot; When asked if the two songs had inspired a new era of creativity for System of a Down, Tankian said to Triple J in December 2020, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, because right now we&#x27;re focused on what&#x27;s going on in Armenia. There&#x27;s a huge humanitarian catastrophe. We&#x27;re still focused on raising funds, raising awareness about this. Time will tell whether this leads to something else or not.&quot;

In January 2023, Dolmayan claimed that Tankian &quot;hasn&#x27;t really wanted to be in a band for a long time [...] and quite frankly, we probably should have parted ways around 2006. We tried to get together multiple times to make an album, but there were certain rules set in place that made it difficult to do so and maintain the integrity of what System of a Down stood for.&quot; Despite the major setback, he said the chemistry to play live together as a band is still great. On May 14 of the same year, System of a Down hosted their only live performance of 2023 as co-headliners of the Sick New World festival in Las Vegas.

In 2024, the band performed two gigs: in the former case, they made their second headline appearance in a row at Sick New World on April 27; in the latter one, they co-headlined (together with Deftones) a standalone concert at the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, making it the first-ever ticketed concert to take place at the venue.

In February 2025, Malakian gave his thoughts about making a new System of a Down album.

== Artistry ==
=== Lyrical themes ===
System of a Down&#x27;s lyrics are often oblique or dadaist and have discussed topics such as drug abuse, politics and suicide. &quot;Prison Song&quot; criticizes the War on Drugs whereas &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; describes &quot;Roulette&quot; as a &quot;scared, wounded love letter&quot;. &quot;Boom!&quot;, among the band&#x27;s most straightforward and unambiguous songs, lambasts globalization and spending on bombs and armament. Commenting on the track &quot;I-E-A-I-A-I-O&quot;, drummer John Dolmayan said it was inspired by an encounter he had with &quot;Knight Rider&quot;&#x27;s actor David Hasselhoff in a liquor store in Los Angeles when he was around 12. On &quot;Mezmerize&quot;, &quot;Cigaro&quot; makes explicit references to phallic imagery and bureaucracy while &quot;Violent Pornography&quot; harshly views television and degradation of women. System of a Down&#x27;s discontent toward the controversial Iraq War arises in &quot;B.Y.O.B.&quot;, which is a double entendre reference to beer and bombs, containing the forthright lyric &quot;Why don&#x27;t presidents fight the war? Why do they always send the poor?&quot;, &quot;Old School Hollywood&quot; describes a celebrity baseball game. On their album &quot;Hypnotize&quot;, &quot;Tentative&quot; describes war, &quot;Hypnotize&quot; refers to the Tiananmen Square events, and &quot;Lonely Day&quot; describes angst. The album title &quot;Steal This Album!&quot; is a play on the book &quot;Steal This Book&quot; by left-wing political activist Abbie Hoffman. System of a Down&#x27;s firm commitment for the Armenian genocide to be recognized appears in two songs: &quot;P.L.U.C.K.&quot; and &quot;Holy Mountains&quot;, which rank among the band&#x27;s most political songs.

=== Music ===
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated &quot;Like many late-&#x27;90s metal bands System of a Down struck a balance between &#x27;80s underground thrash metal and metallic early-&#x27;90s alternative rockers like Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot;. System of a Down&#x27;s music is influenced by elements of numerous styles, including alternative rock, art rock, classic rock, gothic rock, hip hop, jazz, various genres of metal including thrash metal and even Norwegian black metal, and Middle Eastern music. System of a Down&#x27;s music has variously been termed alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock, progressive metal, heavy metal, thrash metal, art rock, and avant-garde metal.
Malakian has stated that &quot;We don&#x27;t belong to any one scene&quot; and that &quot;I don&#x27;t like the nu-metal drop-A 7-string guitar sound; it is not my thing, at least not yet.&quot; In interview with Mike Lancaster, he also said, &quot;People always seem to feel the need to put us into a category, but we just don&#x27;t fit into any category.&quot; According to Tankian, &quot;As far as arrangement and everything, [our music] is pretty much pop. To me, System of a Down isn&#x27;t a progressive band. [...] But it&#x27;s not a typical pop project, obviously. We definitely pay attention to the music to make sure that it&#x27;s not something someone&#x27;s heard before.&quot; Malakian once described their music &quot;as if Slayer and the Beatles had a baby.&quot;

The band has used a wide range of instruments, such as electric mandolins, baritone electric guitars, acoustic guitars, ouds, sitars, and twelve string guitars. According to Malakian, he would often write songs in E♭ tuning, which would later be changed to drop C tuning in order to be performed by the band. Malakian states that &quot;For me, the drop-C tuning is right down the center. It has enough of the clarity and the crisp sound—most of our riffy stuff is done on the top two strings, anyway—but it&#x27;s also thicker and ballsier.&quot;

=== Influences and comparison to other artists ===
System of a Down&#x27;s influences include Middle Eastern music, Rush, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Def Leppard, Scorpions, Morbid Angel, Death, Obituary, Eazy-E, N.W.A, Run-DMC, Umm Kulthum, Abdel Halim Hafez, The Kinks, the Bee Gees, Grateful Dead, The Beatles, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Dead Kennedys, Bauhaus, Depeche Mode, New Order, Radiohead, Metallica, Miles Davis, Alice in Chains, Iron Maiden, Bad Brains, Slayer, Van Halen, and Kiss. One reviewer claimed that their music encompasses different sounds, from sounding like &quot;Fugazi playing Rush&quot; to sometimes &quot;tread[ing] close to Frank Zappa territory.&quot; Malakian has stated that &quot;I&#x27;m a fan of music. I&#x27;m not necessarily a fan of any one band.&quot; Dolmayan stated &quot;I don&#x27;t think we sound like anybody else. I consider us System of a Down.&quot; Odadjian stated &quot;You can compare us to whoever you want. I don&#x27;t care. Comparisons and labels have no effect on this band. Fact is fact: We are who we are and they are who they are.&quot;

== Legacy and influence ==

Sweden&#x27;s former Prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, revealed in an interview that she&#x27;s a fan of the band. The rapper, RZA from Wu Tang Clan selected their album &quot;Mezmerize&quot; in selection of favorite albums. In an interview with the Village Voice in 2012, Morrissey declared himself a fan, saying &quot;Lonely Day&quot; was the last song he absolutely loved. Jack Black covered Chop Suey on the Australian TV Channel V Australia in 2002. Tankian revealed in an interview (on covers of Chop Suey) with Stereogum: &quot;One of my favorite ones is Jack Black’s, when he just kind of makes shit up, and he’s so great. &quot; The Prime minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan is a personal friend of lead vocalist, Serj Tankian. Tankian appeared on the &quot;Broken Record&quot; podcast in 2024 and suggested he was happy if System of Down contiued with a new lead singer.

Kerrang would list their top twenty songs in 2020, with Chop Suey! from the 2001 album, Toxicity as number one. In 2021 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; listed ten bands who (in their view) wouldn&#x27;t exist without System of a Down: Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes, Maximum the Hormone, Portrayal of Guilt, Beartooth, Bad Acid Trip, AC×DC, American Standards, Avenged Sevenfold, Tesseract, and Viza. The British metal magazine, Metal Hammer voted Toxicity as the fourth best metal album in the 21st century going onto to say: &quot;It’s been a long time coming, but this second album is worth the wait. Its contents may sound as mad as a mongoose, but they’re totally moshable.”

In an interview with The Ringer in 2021, Malakian commented on their future:&quot;We are four of the most different people that you’ll find for each other. Even the musical tastes have changed. Where some people want to see the band go is not necessarily where other people want to see the band go, so there are a lot of artistic differences. But we’re still friends. Our differences are within the band, and that has made it a little difficult to move forward when it comes to writing or playing new material together.&quot; – Daron Malakian

<text>Smelting is a process of applying heat and a chemical reducing agent to an ore to extract a desired base metal product. It is a form of extractive metallurgy that is used to obtain many metals such as iron, copper, silver, tin, lead and zinc. Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal behind. The reducing agent is commonly a fossil-fuel source of carbon, such as carbon monoxide from incomplete combustion of coke—or, in earlier times, of charcoal. The oxygen in the ore binds to carbon at high temperatures, as the chemical potential energy of the bonds in carbon dioxide () is lower than that of the bonds in the ore.

Sulfide ores such as those commonly used to obtain copper, zinc or lead, are roasted before smelting in order to convert the sulfides to oxides, which are more readily reduced to the metal. Roasting heats the ore in the presence of oxygen from air, oxidizing the ore and liberating the sulfur as sulfur dioxide gas. 

Smelting most prominently takes place in a blast furnace to produce pig iron, which is converted into steel.

Plants for the electrolytic reduction of aluminium are referred to as aluminium smelters.

==Process==
Smelting involves more than just melting the metal out of its ore. Most ores are the chemical compound of the metal and other elements, such as oxygen (as an oxide), sulfur (as a sulfide), or carbon and oxygen together (as a carbonate). To extract the metal, workers must make these compounds undergo a chemical reaction. Smelting, therefore, consists of using suitable reducing substances that combine with those oxidizing elements to free the metal.

===Roasting===
In the case of sulfides and carbonates, a process called &quot;roasting&quot; removes the unwanted carbon or sulfur, leaving an oxide, which can be directly reduced. Roasting is usually carried out in an oxidizing environment. A few practical examples:

* Malachite, a common ore of copper is primarily copper carbonate hydroxide Cu2(CO3)(OH)2. This mineral undergoes thermal decomposition to 2CuO, CO2, and H2O in several stages between 250 °C and 350 °C. The carbon dioxide and water are expelled into the atmosphere, leaving copper(II) oxide, which can be directly reduced to copper as described in the following section titled &quot;Reduction&quot;.
* Galena, the most common mineral of lead, is primarily lead sulfide (PbS). The sulfide is oxidized to a sulfite (PbSO3), which thermally decomposes into lead oxide and sulfur dioxide gas (PbO and SO2). The sulfur dioxide is expelled (like the carbon dioxide in the previous example), and the lead oxide is reduced as below.

===Reduction===
Reduction is the final, high-temperature step in smelting, in which the oxide becomes the elemental metal. A reducing environment (often provided by carbon monoxide, made by incomplete combustion in an air-starved furnace) pulls the final oxygen atoms from the raw metal. The carbon source acts as a chemical reactant to remove oxygen from the ore, yielding the purified metal element as a product. The carbon source is oxidized in two stages. First, carbon (C) combusts with oxygen (O2) in the air to produce carbon monoxide (CO). Second, the carbon monoxide reacts with the ore (e.g. Fe2O3) and removes one of its oxygen atoms, releasing carbon dioxide (). After successive interactions with carbon monoxide, all of the oxygen in the ore will be removed, leaving the raw metal element (e.g. Fe). As most ores are impure, it is often necessary to use flux, such as limestone (or dolomite), to remove the accompanying rock gangue as slag. This calcination reaction emits carbon dioxide.

The required temperature varies both in absolute terms and in terms of the melting point of the base metal. Examples:

* Iron oxide becomes metallic iron at roughly 1250 °C (2282 °F or 1523 K), almost 300 degrees &quot;below&quot; iron&#x27;s melting point of 1538 °C (2800 °F or 1811 K).
* Mercuric oxide becomes vaporous mercury near 550 °C (1022 °F or 823 K), almost 600 degrees &quot;above&quot; mercury&#x27;s melting point of -38 °C (-36.4 °F or 235 K), and also above mercury&#x27;s &quot;boiling&quot; point.

===Fluxes===
Fluxes are materials added to the ore during smelting to catalyze the desired reactions and to chemically bind to unwanted impurities or reaction products. Calcium carbonate or calcium oxide in the form of lime are often used for this purpose, since they react with sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon impurities to allow them to be readily separated and discarded, in the form of slag. Fluxes may also serve to control the viscosity and neutralize unwanted acids.

Flux and slag can provide a secondary service after the reduction step is complete; they provide a molten cover on the purified metal, preventing contact with oxygen while still hot enough to readily oxidize. This prevents impurities from forming in the metal.

===Sulfide ores===
The ores of base metals are often sulfides. In recent centuries, reverberatory furnaces have been used to keep the charge being smelted separately from the fuel. Traditionally, they were used for the first step of smelting: forming two liquids, one an oxide slag containing most of the impurities, and the other a sulfide matte containing the valuable metal sulfide and some impurities. Such &quot;reverb&quot; furnaces are today about 40 meters long, 3 meters high, and 10 meters wide. Fuel is burned at one end to melt the dry sulfide concentrates (usually after partial roasting) which are fed through openings in the roof of the furnace. The slag floats over the heavier matte and is removed and discarded or recycled. The sulfide matte is then sent to the converter. The precise details of the process vary from one furnace to another depending on the mineralogy of the ore body.

While reverberatory furnaces produced slags containing very little copper, they were relatively energy inefficient and off-gassed a low concentration of sulfur dioxide that was difficult to capture; a new generation of copper smelting technologies has supplanted them. More recent furnaces exploit bath smelting, top-jetting lance smelting, flash smelting, and blast furnaces. Some examples of bath smelters include the Noranda furnace, the Isasmelt furnace, the Teniente reactor, the Vunyukov smelter, and the SKS technology. Top-jetting lance smelters include the Mitsubishi smelting reactor. Flash smelters account for over 50% of the world&#x27;s copper smelters. There are many more varieties of smelting processes, including the Kivset, Ausmelt, Tamano, EAF, and BF.

==History==
Of the seven metals known in antiquity, only gold regularly occurs in nature as a native metal. The others – copper, lead, silver, tin, iron, and mercury – occur primarily as minerals, although native copper is occasionally found in commercially significant quantities. These minerals are primarily carbonates, sulfides, or oxides of the metal, mixed with other components such as silica and alumina. Roasting the carbonate and sulfide minerals in the air converts them to oxides. The oxides, in turn, are smelted into the metal. Carbon monoxide was (and is) the reducing agent of choice for smelting. It is easily produced during the heating process, and as a gas comes into intimate contact with the ore.

In the Old World, humans learned to smelt metals in prehistoric times, more than 8000 years ago. The discovery and use of the &quot;useful&quot; metals – copper and bronze at first, then iron a few millennia later – had an enormous impact on human society. The impact was so pervasive that scholars traditionally divide ancient history into Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age.

In the Americas, pre-Inca civilizations of the central Andes in Peru had mastered the smelting of copper and silver at least six centuries before the first Europeans arrived in the 16th century, while never mastering the smelting of metals such as iron for use with weapon craft.

===Copper and bronze===

Copper was the first metal to be smelted. How the discovery came about is debated. Campfires are about 200 °C short of the temperature needed, so some propose that the first smelting of copper may have occurred in pottery kilns. (The development of copper smelting in the Andes, which is believed to have occurred independently of the Old World, may have occurred in the same way.)

The earliest current evidence of copper smelting, dating from between 5500 BC and 5000 BC, has been found in Pločnik and Belovode, Serbia. A mace head found in Turkey and dated to 5000 BC, once thought to be the oldest evidence, now appears to be hammered, native copper.

Combining copper with tin and/or arsenic in the right proportions produces bronze, an alloy that is significantly harder than copper. The first copper/arsenic bronzes date from 4200 BC from Asia Minor. The Inca bronze alloys were also of this type. Arsenic is often an impurity in copper ores, so the discovery could have been made by accident. Eventually, arsenic-bearing minerals were intentionally added during smelting.

Copper–tin bronzes, harder and more durable, were developed around 3500 BC, also in Asia Minor.

How smiths learned to produce copper/tin bronzes is unknown. The first such bronzes may have been a lucky accident from tin-contaminated copper ores. However, by 2000 BC, people were mining tin on purpose to produce bronze—which is remarkable as tin is a semi-rare metal, and even a rich cassiterite ore only has 5% tin.

The discovery of copper and bronze manufacture had a significant impact on the history of the Old World. Metals were hard enough to make weapons that were heavier, stronger, and more resistant to impact damage than wood, bone, or stone equivalents. For several millennia, bronze was the material of choice for weapons such as swords, daggers, battle axes, and spear and arrow points, as well as protective gear such as shields, helmets, greaves (metal shin guards), and other body armor. Bronze also supplanted stone, wood, and organic materials in tools and household utensils—such as chisels, saws, adzes, nails, blade shears, knives, sewing needles and pins, jugs, cooking pots and cauldrons, mirrors, and horse harnesses. Tin and copper also contributed to the establishment of trade networks that spanned large areas of Europe and Asia and had a major effect on the distribution of wealth among individuals and nations.

===Tin and lead===
The earliest known cast lead beads were thought to be in the Çatalhöyük site in Anatolia (Turkey), and dated from about 6500 BC. However, recent research has discovered that this was not lead, but rather cerussite and galena, minerals rich in, but distinct from, lead.

Since the discovery happened several millennia before the invention of writing, there is no written record of how it was made. However, tin and lead can be smelted by placing the ores in a wood fire, leaving the possibility that the discovery may have occurred by accident. Recent scholarship however has called this find into question.

Lead is a common metal, but its discovery had relatively little impact in the ancient world. It is too soft to use for structural elements or weapons, though its high density relative to other metals makes it ideal for sling projectiles. However, since it was easy to cast and shape, workers in the classical world of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome used it extensively to pipe and store water. They also used it as a mortar in stone buildings.

Tin was much less common than lead, is only marginally harder, and had even less impact by itself.

===Early iron smelting===
The earliest evidence for iron-making is a small number of iron fragments with the appropriate amounts of carbon admixture found in the Proto-Hittite layers at Kaman-Kalehöyük and dated to 2200–2000 BC. Souckova-Siegolová (2001) shows that iron implements were made in Central Anatolia in very limited quantities around 1800 BC and were in general use by elites, though not by commoners, during the New Hittite Empire (~1400–1200 BC).

Archaeologists have found indications of iron working in Ancient Egypt, somewhere between the Third Intermediate Period and 23rd Dynasty (ca. 1100–750 BC). Significantly though, they have found no evidence of iron ore smelting in any (pre-modern) period. In addition, very early instances of carbon steel were in production around 2000 years ago (around the first-century.) in northwest Tanzania, based on complex preheating principles. These discoveries are significant for the history of metallurgy.

Most early processes in Europe and Africa involved smelting iron ore in a bloomery, where the temperature is kept low enough so that the iron does not melt. This produces a spongy mass of iron called a bloom, which then must be consolidated with a hammer to produce wrought iron. Some of the earliest evidence to date for the bloomery smelting of iron is found at Tell Hammeh, Jordan, radiocarbon-dated to .

===Later iron smelting===

From the medieval period, an indirect process began to replace the direct reduction in bloomeries. This used a blast furnace to make pig iron, which then had to undergo a further process to make forgeable bar iron. Processes for the second stage include fining in a finery forge. In the 13th century during the High Middle Ages the blast furnace was introduced by China who had been using it since as early as 200 b.c during the Qin dynasty. Puddling was also introduced in the Industrial Revolution.

Both processes are now obsolete, and wrought iron is now rarely made. Instead, mild steel is produced from a Bessemer converter or by other means including smelting reduction processes such as the Corex Process.

==Environmental and occupational health impacts==
Smelting has serious effects on the environment, producing wastewater and slag and releasing such toxic metals as copper, silver, iron, cobalt, and selenium into the atmosphere. Smelters also release gaseous sulfur dioxide, contributing to acid rain, which acidifies soil and water.

The smelter in Flin Flon, Canada was one of the largest point sources of mercury in North America in the 20th century. Even after smelter releases were drastically reduced, landscape re-emission continued to be a major regional source of mercury. Lakes will likely receive mercury contamination from the smelter for decades, from both re-emissions returning as rainwater and leaching of metals from the soil.

===Air pollution===
Air pollutants generated by aluminium smelters include carbonyl sulfide, hydrogen fluoride, polycyclic compounds, lead, nickel, manganese, polychlorinated biphenyls, and mercury. Copper smelter emissions include arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, and nickel. Lead smelters typically emit arsenic, antimony, cadmium and various lead compounds.
===Wastewater===
Wastewater pollutants discharged by iron and steel mills includes gasification products such as benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, cyanide, ammonia, phenols and cresols, together with a range of more complex organic compounds known collectively as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Treatment technologies include recycling of wastewater; settling basins, clarifiers and filtration systems for solids removal; oil skimmers and filtration; chemical precipitation and filtration for dissolved metals; carbon adsorption and biological oxidation for organic pollutants; and evaporation.

Pollutants generated by other types of smelters varies with the base metal ore. For example, aluminum smelters typically generate fluoride, benzo(a)pyrene, antimony and nickel, as well as aluminum. Copper smelters typically discharge cadmium, lead, zinc, arsenic and nickel, in addition to copper. Lead smelters may discharge antimony, asbestos, cadmium, copper and zinc, in addition to lead.

===Health impacts===
Labourers working in the smelting industry have reported respiratory illnesses inhibiting their ability to perform the physical tasks demanded by their jobs.

===Regulations===
In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has published pollution control regulations for smelters.

<text>Amsterdam Airport Schiphol , known informally as Schiphol Airport (, ), is the main international airport of the Netherlands, and is one of the major hubs for the SkyTeam airline alliance. It is located southwest of Amsterdam, in the municipality of Haarlemmermeer in the province of North Holland. It was the world&#x27;s third busiest airport by international passenger traffic in 2023. With almost 72 million passengers in 2019, it is the third-busiest airport in Europe in terms of passenger volume and the busiest in Europe in terms of aircraft movements. With an annual cargo tonnage of 1.74 million, it is the 4th busiest in Europe. AMS covers a total area of of land. The airport is built on the single-terminal concept: one large terminal split into three departure halls.

Schiphol is the principal hub for KLM and its regional affiliate KLM Cityhopper as well as for Martinair. The airport also serves as an operating base for Corendon Dutch Airlines, easyJet, Transavia, TUI fly Netherlands, and Vueling.

Schiphol opened on 16 September 1916 as a military airbase. The end of the First World War also saw the beginning of civilian use of Schiphol Airport and the airport eventually lost its military role completely. By 1940, Schiphol had four asphalt runways at 45-degree angles. The airport was captured by the German military that same year and renamed &quot;Fliegerhorst Schiphol&quot;. The airport was destroyed through bombing but at the end of the war, the airfield was soon rebuilt. In 1949, it was decided that Schiphol was to become the primary airport of the Netherlands. Schiphol Airport was voted the Best Airport in Western Europe in 2020.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Sciphol&quot; appears in an official document from 1447. According to the airport&#x27;s media department, the name of Schiphol might have several origins, all contested:
# As graveyard of ships. The Haarlemmermeer was a big, wild water mass, where many ships found their demise.
# As ship-haul, where ships were transferred from one water to another. 
# As name of a coppice in marshy land. In the Gothic language, it indicated an area of low-lying wetland (&quot;hol&quot; or &quot;holl&quot;) where wood (scip) could be extracted. However, Gothic has never been spoken in the Netherlands.

==Description==
Schiphol Airport ranked as Europe&#x27;s third busiest and the world&#x27;s eleventh busiest by total passenger traffic in 2017 (12th in 2016, 14th in 2015, 2014 and 2013 and 16th in 2012). It also ranks as the world&#x27;s fifth busiest by international passenger traffic and the world&#x27;s sixteenth busiest for cargo tonnage. A record 71,706,999 passengers passed through the airport in 2019. Schiphol&#x27;s main competitors in terms of passenger traffic and cargo throughput are London Heathrow, Frankfurt, Madrid, Paris–Charles de Gaulle and Istanbul.
In 2019, 70.5% of passengers using the airport flew to and from Europe, 10.6% to and from North America and 10.1% to and from Asia; cargo volume was mainly between Schiphol and Asia (46.3%) and North America (17.6%). In 2019, 102 carriers provided a total of 332 destinations on a regular basis.

The airport is built as one large terminal (a single-terminal concept), split into three departure halls, which connect again once airside. The most recent of these was completed in 1994 and expanded in 2007 with a new section, called Terminal 4, although it is not considered a separate building. A new pier is to be opened in 2019 with a terminal extension planned to be operational by 2023. Plans for further terminal and gate expansion exist, including the construction of a separate new terminal between the Zwanenburgbaan and Polderbaan runways that would end the one-terminal concept.

Because of intense traffic and high landing fees (due to the limit of 500,000 flights a year), some low-cost carriers decided to move their flights to smaller airports, such as Rotterdam The Hague Airport and Eindhoven Airport. Many low-cost carriers, such as EasyJet and Ryanair, however, continue to operate at Schiphol, using the low-cost H pier. In 2015, Lelystad Airport was allowed to expand, aimed at accommodating some of the low-cost and leisure flights currently operating out of Schiphol, eventually taking up to 45,000 flights a year.

To combat complaints from the community in Schiphol, Amsterdam Airport is advocating the prohibition of private jets, with the aim of minimizing noise and environmental pollution. The airport also intends to restrict takeoffs between midnight and 6 a.m. and landings between midnight and 5 a.m.

==History==
===Early years===

Before 1852, the entire polder of Haarlemmermeer in which the airport lies was a large lake with some shallow areas. There are multiple stories of how the place got its name. The most popular story is that in the shallow waters, sudden violent storms could claim many ships. Winds were particularly strong in the Schiphol area since the prevailing wind direction is from the southwest, and Schiphol lies in the northeastern corner of the lake. In English, translates to &#x27;ship hole&#x27;, a reference to many ships supposedly lost in the lake. When the lake was reclaimed, however, no shipwrecks were found. Another possible origin of the name is the word . A is a ditch or small canal in which ships would be towed from one lake to another. A third explanation would be that the name is derived from the words . This is a low-lying area of land () from where wood would be obtained to build ships.

After the lake was dredged in the mid-1800s, a fortification named Fort Schiphol was built in the area which was part of the Stelling van Amsterdam defence works.

Schiphol opened on 16 September 1916 as a military airbase, with a few barracks and a field serving as platform and runways. When civil aircraft started to use the field (17 December 1920), it was often called . The Fokker aircraft manufacturer started a factory near Schiphol airport in 1919. The end of the First World War also saw the beginning of civilian use of Schiphol Airport and the airport eventually lost its military role completely.

By 1940, Schiphol had four asphalt runways at 45-degree angles, all or less. One was extended to become today&#x27;s runway 04/22; two others crossed that runway at . The airport was captured by the German military that same year and renamed . A large number of anti-aircraft defences were installed in the vicinity of the airport and fake decoy airfields were constructed in the vicinity near Bennebroek, Vijfhuizen, and Vogelenzang to try to confuse Allied bombers. A railway connection was also built. Despite these defences, the airfield was still bombed intensively; an exceptionally heavy attack on 13 December 1943 caused so much damage that it rendered the airfield unusable as an active base. After that, it served only as an emergency landing field, until the Germans themselves destroyed the remnants of the airfield at the start of Operation Market Garden. At the end of the war, the airfield was quickly restored: the first aircraft, a Douglas DC-3, landed on 8 July 1945.

A new terminal building was completed in 1949 and it was decided that Schiphol was to become the primary airport of the Netherlands. The expansion came at the cost of a small town called Rijk, which was demolished to make room for the growing airport. The name of this town is remembered in the name of the present Schiphol-Rijk industrial estate. In 1967, Schiphol expanded even further with a new terminal area at its current location. Most of the 1967 terminal is still in use today (Departure Halls 1 and 2), as are parts of the original piers (now called C, D, and E). Dutch designer Benno Wissing created signage for Schiphol Airport, well known for its clear writing and thorough colour-coding; to avoid confusion, he prohibited any other signage in the shades of yellow and green used. The new terminal building replaced the older facilities once located on what is now the east side of the airport. The A-pier (now C-pier) of the airport was modified in 1970 to allow Boeing 747 aircraft to use the boarding gates. A new pier (D, now called F) opened in 1977, dedicated to handling wide-body aircraft. The first railway station at the airport followed in 1978.

===Development since the 1990s===
The construction of a new Air Traffic Control tower was completed in 1991 as the existing tower could no longer oversee all of the airport as it was further expanded. Departure Hall 3 was added to the terminal in 1993, as was another pier, G-pier. New wayfinding signage was designed that year as well by Paul Mijksenaar. A sixth runway was completed at quite some distance west of the rest of airport in 2003 and was nicknamed the Polderbaan, with the connecting taxiway bridge crossing the A5 motorway. The distance of this runway means that taxiing to and from this runway can take between 10 and 20 minutes. It also required the construction of an additional Air Traffic Control tower as the primary tower is too far away to oversee this part of the airfield.

On 25 February 2005, a diamond robbery occurred at Schiphol&#x27;s cargo terminal. The robbers used a stolen KLM van to gain airside access. The estimated value of the stones was around 75 million euros, making it one of the largest diamond robberies ever.

Later in 2005, a fire broke out at the airport&#x27;s detention centre, killing 11 people and injuring 15. The complex was holding 350 people at the time of the incident. Results from the investigation almost one year later showed that fire safety precautions were not in force. A national outrage resulted in the resignation of Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner (CDA) and Mayor Hartog of Haarlemmermeer. Spatial Planning Minister Sybilla Dekker (VVD) resigned as well because she bore responsibility for safety failings cited in the report.

In the summer of 2022, the airport suffered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation. It experienced extraordinarily long delays and a large number of cancelled flights, which led to a recession of air traffic and subsequently to a shortage of security staff and a walkout of baggage handlers. Queues for security check-in were reported to last for 5 hours, and many passengers missed their flights. The CEO of Schiphol Group, Dick Benschop, was forced to resign.

==Infrastructure==
===Terminal===

Schiphol uses a one-terminal concept, where all facilities are located under a single roof, radiating from the central plaza, Schiphol Plaza. The terminal is divided into three sections or halls designated 1, 2 and 3. The piers and concourses of each hall are connected so that it is possible, on both sides of security or border inspection, to walk between piers and halls, although border control separates Schengen from non-Schengen areas. The exception to this is the low-cost pier M: once airside (past security), passengers cannot access any other areas.

Schiphol Airport has approximately 223 boarding gates including eighteen double jetway gates used for widebody aircraft. The airport adopted a distinctive design, with the second jetway extending over the aircraft wing hanging from a steel cantilever structure. Gradual refurbishments have seen these jetways replaced with a more conventional layout with the last two taken out of use in November 2024. Two gates feature a third jetway for handling of the Airbus A380. Emirates was the first airline to fly the A380 to Schiphol in August 2012, deploying the aircraft on its double daily Dubai–Amsterdam service. China Southern Airlines also used the A380 on its Beijing–Amsterdam route before removing the type from service at the end of 2022, leaving Emirates as the sole A380 operator at Schiphol Airport as of 2023.

Schiphol has large shopping areas, primarily on the ground floor, as a source of revenue and as an additional attraction for passengers. Schiphol Plaza not only connects the three terminal halls but also houses other facilities. This is a large pre-security shopping centre and the Schiphol Airport railway station. These facilities are also attracting general visitors.

The 1st floor hosts the luggage check-in lines, many of them automated, as well as various duty-free refund booths. Available seating is limited on this floor.

Notable public artworks in the airport include the Schiphol clock by Maarten Baas, in which a man behind a translucent screen appears to paint the minutes of an analog clock by hand.

====Departure Hall 1====
Departure Hall 1 consists of Piers B and C, both of which are dedicated Schengen areas and share D-pier with Departure Hall 2. Pier B has 14 gates and Pier C has 21 gates.

====Departure Hall 2====
Departure Hall 2 consists of Piers D and E.

Pier D is the largest pier and has two levels. The lower floor houses non-Schengen flights and the upper floor is used for Schengen flights. By using stairs, the same jetways are used to access the aircraft. Schengen gates are numbered beginning with D-59; non-Schengen gates are numbered from D-1 to D-57.

Pier E is a dedicated non-Schengen area and has fourteen gates. It is typically home to SkyTeam hub airlines Delta Air Lines and KLM, along with other members, such as China Airlines and China Southern Airlines. Other Middle Eastern and Asian airlines such as Air Astana, EVA Air, Etihad Airways and Iran Air also typically operate out of Pier E.

====Departure Hall 3====
Departure Hall 3 consists of three piers: F, G, and H/M. Pier F has eight gates and is typically dominated by SkyTeam members such as primary airline KLM, Kenya Airways, China Airlines, China Southern Airlines, and other members. Pier G has thirteen gates. Piers F and G are non-Schengen areas.

Piers H and M are physically one concourse consisting of seven shared gates and are home to low-cost airlines. Operating completely separately, H handles non-Schengen flights while M is dedicated to flights within the Schengen area.

====A380====
Gates G9, E18 and E24 (E24 refurbished in 2019) are equipped to handle daily Airbus A380 service by Emirates. China Southern Airlines also operated the type before withdrawing it from service at the end of 2022, leaving Emirates as the only A380 operator at Schiphol as of 2023.

====General aviation terminal====
A new general aviation terminal was opened in 2011 on the east side of the airport, operated as the &quot;KLM Jet Center&quot;. The new terminal building has a floorspace of ; for the actual terminal and lounges, for office space and for parking.

The centre and its activities were sold to the Swiss company Jet Aviation in October 2018 and was rebranded as Jet Aviation Amsterdam.

====Other facilities====
The Rijksmuseum operates an annex at the airport, offering a small overview of both classical and contemporary art. Admission to the exhibits is free, but requires a plane ticket as it is situated in the passenger transit zone.

In the summer of 2010, Schiphol Airport Library opened alongside the museum, providing passengers access to a collection of 1,200 books (translated into 29 languages) by Dutch authors on subjects relating to the country&#x27;s history and culture. The library offers e-books and music by Dutch artists and composers that can be downloaded free of charge to a laptop or mobile device.

For aviation enthusiasts, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol has a large rooftop viewing area, called the Panoramaterras. It is not accessible to connecting passengers unless they first exit the airport. Enthusiasts and the public can enter, free of charge, from the airport&#x27;s landside. Since June 2011, it is the location for a KLM Cityhopper Fokker 100, modified to be a viewing exhibit. Besides the Panoramaterras, Schiphol has other spotting sites, especially along the newest Polderbaan runway and at the McDonald&#x27;s restaurant at the north side of the airport.

Schiphol has its own mortuary, where the dead can be handled and kept before departure or after arrival.

Between October 2006 and 2019, people could also hold a wedding ceremony at Schiphol.

Schiphol also has a new state-of-the-art cube-shaped Hilton Amsterdam Airport Schiphol with 433 rooms, rounded corners and diamond-shaped windows. The spacious atrium has a ceiling made of glass and is in the heart of the building. A covered walkway connects the hotel directly to the terminal. The hotel was completed in 2015.

===Future expansions===
====Pier A====
In 2012, Schiphol Group announced an expansion of Schiphol, featuring a new pier. Pier A will be part of Departure Hall 1, which already has Pier B (14 gates) and Pier C (21 gates). The new Pier A will have five narrow-body gates and will initially have three wide-body gates, with two more planned for a later phase. The new Pier A is under construction to the southwest of Pier B, in an area formerly used as a freight platform. Pier A is planned to be mainly used for flights within Europe. The expansions were originally supposed to cost about 500 million Euro.

The first construction activities were originally expected to start in 2017 with an estimated opening in 2019. However, the construction of the new pier has been delayed several times and due to a conflict between the airport and the construction consortium, the construction was halted in November 2021. Schiphol was disappointed in the construction speed and the rising of the total cost, although insiders announced that a design flaw was made and the entire construction needed to be reinforced. A new tendering procedure was be started to find a new constructor in 2022, once found a new completion date will be announced.

====Fourth terminal hall====
To handle future growth in passengers, Schiphol will further expand by building a fourth terminal hall with facilities for both departures and arrivals. From this new building, direct access will be made to Schiphol Plaza, continuing the one-terminal concept. When finished in 2023, Schiphol will be able to handle over 70 million passengers. Due to rapid growth of Schengen passengers during 2016, Schiphol was however forced to rapidly build a temporary departure hall which opened in March 2017. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the construction of the fourth terminal hall has been postponed for at least two years.

====Uniform platform====
The airport has expanded the number of uniform platforms, and places to stow airplanes, in recent years in two phases. A third phase is planned to expand the number of wide-body platforms to a total of twelve, with planned completion in the period 2022–2026.

====Public transportation====
Schiphol, together with the public transport authority Amsterdam, is going to transform its train- and bus station. The train station will be getting more entrances and the bus station will be completely renewed with a planned opening date in 2025. A connection to the Amsterdam Metro network has been a subject of discussion and speculation since at least the 1990s. In preparation for this, a piece of land has been acquired from Chipshol. , the project had not moved past the proposal stage.

====Airlines====

Schiphol&#x27;s growth is hampered by slot restrictions from the government. For reasons of safety and noise reduction, Schiphol is allowed to have no more than 500,000 aircraft movements until the end of 2020. A proposal to increase the limit to 540,000 movements from 2021 onwards has been postponed until a new government is formed after the elections in March 2021. As Schiphol nearly approached the limit of 500,000 in the last few years, the slot restrictions have hindered airlines to settle at Schiphol. Among airlines that have expressed interest in flying at Schiphol are Atlantic Airways, Cyprus Airways, Somon Air and SpiceJet.

===Tower===
The Schiphol air traffic control tower, with a height of , was the tallest in the world when constructed in 1991. Schiphol is geographically one of the world&#x27;s lowest major commercial airports. The entire airport is below sea level. The lowest point sits at below sea level: below the Dutch Normaal Amsterdams Peil (NAP). The runways are around below NAP. It is one of only eleven airports worldwide below sea level, the fifth lowest with scheduled flights, and the third lowest with international flights.

===Runways===
Schiphol has six runways, one of which is used mainly by general aviation. The airport covers a total area of 6,887 acres (2,787 ha) of land.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 14 November 1946, a Douglas C-47 operated by KLM from London approached Schiphol during bad weather conditions. The first two attempts to land failed. During the third attempt, the pilot realized that the airplane was not lined up properly with the runway. The aircraft made a sharp left turn at low speed, causing the left wing to hit the ground. The airplane crashed and caught fire, killing all 26 people on board.
*On 4 October 1992, El Al Flight 1862, a Boeing 747-200F cargo jet en route to Tel Aviv, lost both right-wing engines (#3 and #4) just after taking off from Schiphol and crashed into an apartment building in the Bijlmer neighbourhood of Amsterdam while attempting to return to the airport. A total of 47 people were killed, including the plane&#x27;s crew of three and a non-revenue passenger. In addition to these fatalities, 11 people were seriously injured and 15 people received minor injuries.
*On 4 April 1994, KLM Cityhopper Flight 433, a Saab 340 to Cardiff, returned to Schiphol after setting the number two engine to flight idle because the crew mistakenly believed that the engine suffered from low oil pressure because of a faulty warning light. On final approach at a height of , the captain decided to go-around and gave full throttle on only the number one engine, leaving the other in flight idle. The airplane rolled to the right, pitched up, stalled and hit the ground at 80 degrees bank. Of the 24 people on board, three were killed, including the captain. Nine others were seriously injured.
*On 25 February 2009, Turkish Airlines Flight 1951, a Boeing 737-800 from Istanbul crashed on approach, just short of the airport&#x27;s Polderbaan runway. The plane carried 128 passengers and 7 crew on board. 9 people were killed and a further 86 were injured, including six with serious injuries. Four of the dead were employees of Boeing, involved in an advanced radar deal with Turkey. An initial report from the Dutch Safety Board revealed that the left radio altimeter had failed to provide the correct height above the ground and suddenly reported . As a result of this the autothrottle system closed the thrust levers to idle, as it is programmed to reduce thrust when below radio altitude. This eventually resulted in a dropping airspeed that was not acted upon until it was too late to recover, and the aircraft stalled and crashed in a field.
*On 23 February 2017, a Bombardier Dash-8 Q400 operated by Flybe suffered a collapse of its right landing gear after landing at the Oostbaan. The plane took off from Edinburgh after a 1.5-hour delay and had to battle storm Doris throughout the flight and during landing. None of the 59 passengers and four crew was injured in the incident, but the aircraft sustained significant damage.
*On 29 May 2024, an airport worker died after being ingested into the engine of an Embraer 190 operating as KLM Cityhopper Flight 1341. The incident occurred on the airport&#x27;s apron during pushback as the aircraft was preparing to depart for Billund. Investigators from the Dutch Safety Board determined that the worker intentionally jumped into the running engine to commit suicide.

<doc id="28722" wikidata="Q44306" url="?curid=28722" title="Salman Rushdie">
<text>Sir Ahmed Salman Rushdie ( ; born 19 June 1947) is an Indian-born British and American novelist. His work often combines magic realism with historical fiction and primarily deals with connections, disruptions, and migrations between Eastern and Western civilizations, typically set on the Indian subcontinent. Rushdie&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; (1981), won the Booker Prize in 1981 and was deemed to be &quot;the best novel of all winners&quot; on two occasions, marking the 25th and the 40th anniversary of the prize.

After his fourth novel, &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; (1988), Rushdie became the subject of several assassination attempts and death threats, including a &quot;fatwa&quot; calling for his death issued by Ruhollah Khomeini, the supreme leader of Iran; the book was banned in 20 countries. Numerous killings and bombings have been carried out by extremists who cite the book as motivation, sparking a debate about censorship and religiously motivated violence. In 2022, Rushdie survived a stabbing at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York that led to loss of his right eye and damage to his liver and hands.

In 1983, Rushdie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He was appointed a of France in 1999. Rushdie was knighted in 2007 for his services to literature. In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; ranked him 13th on its list of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945. Since 2000, Rushdie has lived in the United States. He was named Distinguished Writer in Residence at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute of New York University in 2015. Earlier, he taught at Emory University. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2012, he published &quot;Joseph Anton: A Memoir&quot;, an account of his life in the wake of the events following &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;. Rushdie was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in April 2023.

Rushdie&#x27;s personal life, including his five marriages and four divorces, has attracted notable media attention and controversies, particularly during his marriage to television personality, model, producer, author, businessperson, and activist Padma Lakshmi.

==Early life and education==
Rushdie was born in Bombay on 19 June 1947 in British India, into a Kashmiri Muslim family. He is the son of Anis Ahmed Rushdie, a Cambridge-educated lawyer-turned-businessman, and Negin Bhatt, a teacher. Rushdie&#x27;s father was dismissed from the Indian Civil Services (ICS) after it emerged that the birth certificate submitted by him had changes to make him appear younger than he was. Rushdie has three sisters. He wrote in his memoir, &quot;Joseph Anton,&quot; that his father adopted the name Rushdie in honour of Averroes (Ibn Rushd). He recalls his &quot;first literary influence&quot;: &quot;When I first saw &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; it made a writer of me.&quot; He recalls &quot;Every child in India in my day (and probably still) was obsessed with P. G. Wodehouse and Agatha Christie. I read mountains of books by both.&quot; He recalls that &quot;Alice captured my imagination as few other books did: both the books, not just &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; but &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; as well, and I can still recite the whole of &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; and &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter&quot; from memory. I also loved the &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; series by Arthur Ransome because of the unimaginable freedom those young people sailing in the Lake District were given by their families ... When I was 16, I read &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; and became obsessed, and can still recite the inscription on the Ruling Ring (&#x27;One ring to rule them all...&#x27;) in the dark language of Mordor. I read an astonishing amount of Golden Age science fiction, not just Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke and Kurt Vonnegut but more arcane writers like Clifford D. Simak, James Blish, Zenna Henderson and L. Sprague de Camp.&quot; He has written about his family following the Indian custom of kissing holy books if they were dropped on the floor. &quot;But we kissed everything. We kissed dictionaries and atlases. We kissed Enid Blyton novels and &quot;Superman&quot; comics. If I&#x27;d ever dropped the telephone directory I&#x27;d probably have kissed that, too.&quot;

Rushdie grew up in Bombay and was educated at the Cathedral and John Connon School in Fort in South Bombay, before moving to England in 1964 to attend Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire. He then attended the University of Cambridge as an undergraduate student at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History.

==Career==
===Copywriter===
Rushdie worked as a copywriter for the advertising agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather, where he came up with &quot;irresistibubble&quot; for Aero and &quot;Naughty but Nice&quot; for cream cakes, and for the agency Ayer Barker (until 1982), for whom he wrote the line &quot;That&#x27;ll do nicely&quot; for American Express. Collaborating with musician Ronnie Bond, Rushdie wrote the words for an advertising record on behalf of the now defunct Burnley Building Society that was recorded at Good Earth Studios, London. The song was called &quot;The Best Dreams&quot; and was sung by George Chandler. It was while at Ogilvy that Rushdie wrote &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot;, before becoming a full-time writer. Rushdie was a personal friend of Angela Carter&#x27;s, calling her &quot;the first great writer I ever met&quot;.

===Literary works===
==== Early works and literary breakthrough, 1975–1987 ====
Rushdie&#x27;s debut, the science fiction tale &quot;Grimus&quot; (1975), was generally ignored by the public and literary critics. His next novel, &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; (1981), put him on the map. It follows the life of Saleem Sinai, born at the stroke of midnight as India gained its independence, who is endowed with special powers and a connection to other children born at the birth of the modern nation of India. Sinai has been compared to Rushdie. However, Rushdie refuted the idea of having written any of his characters as autobiographical, stating, &quot;People assume that because certain things in the character are drawn from your own experience, it just becomes you. In that sense, I&#x27;ve never felt that I&#x27;ve written an autobiographical character.&quot; Rushdie writes of his &quot;debt to the oral narrative traditions of India and also to the great novelists Jane Austen and Charles Dickens—Austen for her portraits of brilliant women caged by the social convention of their time, women whose Indian counterparts I knew well; Dickens for his great, rotting, Bombay-like city, and his ability to root his larger-than-life characters and surrealist imagery in a sharply observed, almost hyperrealistic background.&quot;

Shortly after its publication, V. S. Pritchett wrote: &quot;In Salman Rushdie, the author of &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot;, India has produced a glittering novelist—one with startling imaginative and intellectual resources, a master of perpetual storytelling. Like García Marquez in &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;, he weaves a whole people&#x27;s capacity for carrying its inherited myths—and new ones that it goes on generating—into a kind of magic carpet. The human swarm swarms in every man and woman as they make their bid for life and vanish into the passion or hallucination that hangs about them like the smell of India itself. Yet at the same time there are strange Western echoes, of the irony of Sterne in &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;—that early nonlinear writer—in Rushdie&#x27;s readiness to tease by breaking off or digressing at the gravest moments. This is very odd in an Indian novel! The book is really about the mystery of being born and the puzzle of who one is.&quot; &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; won the 1981 Booker Prize and, in 1993 and 2008, the Best of the Bookers and Booker of Bookers special prizes.

After &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot;, Rushdie depicted the political turmoil in Pakistan with &quot;Shame&quot; (1983), basing his characters on Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. &quot;Shame&quot; won France&#x27;s &quot;Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger&quot; (Best Foreign Book) and was a close runner-up for the Booker Prize. Both these works of postcolonial literature are characterised by a style of magic realism and the immigrant outlook that Rushdie is very conscious of as a member of the Kashmiri diaspora.

Rushdie wrote a non-fiction book about Nicaragua in 1987 called &quot;The Jaguar Smile&quot;. This book has a political focus and is based on his first-hand experiences and research at the scene of Sandinista political experiments. He became interested in Nicaragua after he had been a neighbour of Madame Somoza, wife of the former Nicaraguan dictator, and his son Zafar was born around the time of the Nicaraguan revolution.

==== &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; and &quot;Haroun and the Sea of Stories&quot;, 1988–1990 ====
His most controversial work, &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, was published in 1988 and won the Whitbread Award. It was followed by &quot;Haroun and the Sea of Stories&quot; (1990). Written in the shadow of the fatwa, it is about the magic of story-telling and an allegorical defence of the power of stories over silence.

==== Further works, 1990s–2000s ====
In 1990, Rushdie reviewed Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;Vineland&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and offered some droll musings on the author&#x27;s reclusiveness: &quot;So he wants a private life and no photographs and nobody to know his home address. I can dig it, I can relate to that (but, like, he should try it when it&#x27;s compulsory instead of a free-choice option).&quot; Rushdie recalls: &quot;I was able to meet the famously invisible man. I had dinner with him at Sonny Mehta&#x27;s apartment in Manhattan and found him very satisfyingly Pynchonesque. At the end of dinner I thought, well, now we&#x27;re friends, and maybe we&#x27;ll see each other from time to time. He never called again.&quot;

Rushdie has published many short stories, including those collected in &quot;East, West&quot; (1994). His 1995 novel &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Last Sigh&quot;, a family saga spanning some 100 years of India&#x27;s history, won the Whitbread Award. &quot;The Ground Beneath Her Feet&quot; (1999) is a riff on the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, casting Orpheus and Eurydice as rock stars. The book features many original song lyrics; one was the basis for the U2 song &quot;The Ground Beneath Her Feet&quot;. Rushdie is credited as the lyricist.

Following &quot;Fury&quot; (2001), set mainly in New York and avoiding the previous sprawling narrative style that spans generations, periods and places, Rushdie&#x27;s novel &quot;Shalimar the Clown&quot; (2005), a story about love and betrayal set in Kashmir and Los Angeles, was hailed as a return to form by a number of critics.

In his 2002 non-fiction collection &quot;Step Across This Line&quot;, he professes his admiration for Italo Calvino and Pynchon, among others. His early influences included Jorge Luis Borges, Mikhail Bulgakov, Lewis Carroll and Günter Grass. When asked who his favorite novelist is, he says: &quot;There are days when it&#x27;s Kafka, in whose world we all live; others when it&#x27;s Dickens, for the sheer fecundity of his imagination and the beauty of his prose. But it&#x27;s probably Joyce on more days than anyone else.&quot;

2008 saw the publication of &quot;The Enchantress of Florence&quot;, one of Rushdie&#x27;s most challenging works that focuses on the past. It tells the story of a European&#x27;s visit to Akbar&#x27;s court, and his revelation that he is a lost relative of the Mughal emperor. The novel was praised by Ursula Le Guin in a review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;sumptuous mixture of history with fable&quot;. &quot;Luka and the Fire of Life&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Haroun and the Sea of Stories&quot;, was published in November 2010 to critical acclaim. Earlier that year, he announced that he was writing his memoir, &quot;Joseph Anton: A Memoir&quot;, which was published in September 2012.

In 2012, Rushdie became one of the first major authors to embrace Booktrack (a company that synchronises ebooks with customised soundtracks), when he published his short story &quot;In the South&quot; on the platform.

====Later works, novels, and essays, 2015–2024====
2015 saw the publication of &quot;Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights&quot;, a modern take on the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. Based on the conflict of scholar Ibn Rushd (from whom Rushdie&#x27;s family name derives), Rushdie explores themes of transnationalism and cosmopolitanism by depicting a war of the universe with a supernatural world of jinns. Ursula K. Le Guin wrote: &quot;Rushdie is our Scheherazade, inexhaustibly enfolding story within story and unfolding tale after tale with such irrepressible delight that it comes as a shock to remember that, like her, he has lived the life of a storyteller in immediate peril. Scheherazade told her 1,001 tales to put off a stupid, cruel threat of death; Rushdie found himself under similar threat for telling an unwelcome tale. So far, like her, he has succeeded in escaping. May he continue to do so.&quot;

In 2017, &quot;The Golden House&quot;, a satirical novel set in contemporary America, was published. 2019 saw the publication of &quot;Quichotte&quot;, a modern retelling of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. In 2021 &quot;Languages of Truth&quot;, a collection of essays written between 2003 and 2020, was published. Rushdie&#x27;s fifteenth novel &quot;Victory City&quot;, described as an epic tale of a woman who breathes a fantastical empire into existence, was published in February 2023. The book was Rushdie&#x27;s first released work after he was attacked and severely injured as he was about to give a public lecture in New York. In April 2024, his autobiographical book &quot;&quot;, in which Rushdie writes about the attack and his recovery, was published. It was longlisted for the 2024 National Book Award for Nonfiction.

===Critical reception===
Rushdie has had a string of commercially successful and critically acclaimed novels. His works have been shortlisted for the Booker Prize five times, in 1981 for &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot;, 1983 for &quot;Shame&quot;, 1988 for &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, 1995 for &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Last Sigh&quot;, and in 2019 for &quot;Quichotte&quot;. In 1981, he was awarded the prize. His 2005 novel &quot;Shalimar the Clown&quot; received the prestigious Hutch Crossword Book Award, and, in the UK, was a finalist for the Whitbread Book Awards. It was shortlisted for the 2007 International Dublin Literary Award. Rushdie&#x27;s works have spawned 30 book-length studies and more than 700 articles on his writing. He is frequently mentioned a favourite to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.

===Academic and other activities===
Rushdie has mentored younger Indian (and ethnic-Indian) writers, influenced an entire generation of Indo-Anglian writers, and is an influential writer in postcolonial literature in general. He opposed the British government&#x27;s introduction of the &quot;Racial and Religious Hatred Act&quot;, something he writes about in his contribution to &quot;Free Expression Is No Offence&quot;, a collection of essays by several writers, published by Penguin in November 2005.

Rushdie was the President of PEN American Center from 2004 to 2006 and founder of the PEN World Voices Festival. In 2007, he began a five-year term as Distinguished Writer in Residence at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, where he has also deposited his archives. In May 2008, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2014, he taught a seminar on British Literature and served as the 2015 keynote speaker In September 2015, he joined the New York University Journalism Faculty as a Distinguished Writer in Residence.

Rushdie is a member of the advisory board of The Lunchbox Fund, a non-profit organisation that provides daily meals to students of township schools in Soweto of South Africa. He is a member of the advisory board of the Secular Coalition for America, an advocacy group representing the interests of atheistic and humanistic Americans in Washington, D.C., and a patron of Humanists UK (formerly the British Humanist Association). He is a laureate of the International Academy of Humanism. In November 2010 he became a founding patron of Ralston College, a new liberal arts college that has adopted as its motto a Latin translation of a phrase (&quot;free speech is life itself&quot;) from an address he gave at Columbia University in 1991 to mark the 200th anniversary of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

===Film and television===
Though he enjoys writing, Rushdie says he would have become an actor if his writing career had not been successful. From early childhood, he dreamed of appearing in Hollywood films (which he later realised in his frequent cameo appearances).

Rushdie includes fictional television and movie characters in some of his writings. He had a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; based on the book of the same name, which is itself full of literary in-jokes. On 12 May 2006, Rushdie was a guest host on &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot;, where he interviewed Indo-Canadian filmmaker Deepa Mehta, whose 2005 film &quot;Water&quot; faced violent protests. He appears in the role of Helen Hunt&#x27;s obstetrician-gynaecologist in the film adaptation (Hunt&#x27;s directorial debut) of Elinor Lipman&#x27;s novel &quot;Then She Found Me&quot;. In September 2008, and again in March 2009, he appeared as a panellist on the HBO programme &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;. Rushdie has said that he was approached for a cameo in &quot;Talladega Nights&quot;: &quot;They had this idea, just one shot in which three very, very unlikely people were seen as NASCAR drivers. And I think they approached Julian Schnabel, Lou Reed, and me. We were all supposed to be wearing the uniforms and the helmet, walking in slow motion with the heat haze.&quot; In the end, their schedules did not allow for it.

In 2009, Rushdie signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.

Rushdie collaborated on the screenplay for the cinematic adaptation of his novel &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; with director Deepa Mehta. The film was also called &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot;. Seema Biswas, Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das, and Irrfan Khan participated in the film. Production began in September 2010; the film was released in 2012.

Rushdie announced in June 2011 that he had written the first draft of a script for a new television series for the US cable network Showtime, a project on which he will also serve as an executive producer. The new series, to be called &quot;The Next People&quot;, will be, according to Rushdie, &quot;a sort of paranoid science-fiction series, people disappearing and being replaced by other people.&quot; The idea of a television series was suggested by his US agents, said Rushdie, who felt that television would allow him more creative control than feature film. &quot;The Next People&quot; is being made by the British film production company Working Title, the firm behind projects including &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; and &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;.

In 2017, Rushdie appeared as himself in episode 3 of season 9 of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, sharing scenes with Larry David to offer advice on how Larry should deal with the &quot;fatwa&quot; that has been ordered against him.

==&quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; and the &quot;fatwa&quot;==
The publication of &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; by Viking Penguin Publishing in September 1988 caused immediate controversy in the Islamic world because of what was seen by some to be an irreverent depictions of Muhammad. The title refers to a disputed Muslim tradition that is referenced in the book. According to this tradition, Muhammad (Mahound in the book) added verses (&quot;Ayah&quot;) to the Quran accepting three Arabian pagan goddesses who were worshiped in Mecca as divine beings. According to the legend, Muhammad later revoked the verses, saying the devil tempted him to utter these lines to appease the Meccans (hence the &quot;Satanic&quot; verses). However, the narrator reveals to the reader that these disputed verses were actually from the mouth of the Archangel Gabriel. The book was banned in many countries with large Muslim communities, including India, Iran, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Thailand, Tanzania, Indonesia, Singapore, Venezuela, and Pakistan. In total, 20 countries banned the book.

In response to the protests, on 22 January 1989, Rushdie published a column in &quot;The Observer&quot; that called Muhammad &quot;one of the great geniuses of world history,&quot; but noted that Islamic doctrine holds Muhammad to be human, and in no way perfect. He held that the novel is not &quot;an anti-religious novel. It is, however, an attempt to write about migration, its stresses and transformations.&quot;

On 14 February 1989—Valentine&#x27;s Day, and also the day of his close friend Bruce Chatwin&#x27;s funeral—a &quot;fatwa&quot; ordering Rushdie&#x27;s execution was proclaimed on Radio Tehran by Ayatollah Khomeini, the Supreme leader of Iran at the time, calling the book &quot;blasphemous against Islam&quot;. Chapter IV of the book depicts the character of an Imam in exile who returns to incite revolt from the people of his country with no regard for their safety. According to Khomeini&#x27;s son, his father never read the book. A bounty was offered for Rushdie&#x27;s death, and he was thus forced to live under police protection for several years. On 7 March 1989, the United Kingdom and Iran broke diplomatic relations over the Rushdie controversy.

In 1989, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published &quot;Words For Salman Rushdie&quot;: &quot;28 distinguished writers born in 21 countries speak to him from their common land – the country of literature. For expressing their ideas publicly in the past many of these writers have suffered censorship, exile – forced or self-imposed – and imprisonment.&quot; Czesław Miłosz wrote: &quot;I have particular reasons to defend your rights, Mr. Rushdie. My books have been forbidden in many countries or have had whole passages censored out. I&#x27;m grateful to people who stood then by the principle of free expression, and I back you now in my turn.&quot; Ralph Ellison: &quot;You deserve the full and passionate solidarity of any man of dignity, but I am afraid this is too little. This story of a man alone against worldwide intolerance, and of a book alone against the craziness of the media, can become the story of many others. The bell tolls for all of us.&quot; Umberto Eco: &quot;Keep to your convictions. Try to protect yourself. A death sentence is a rather harsh review.&quot; Anita Desai: &quot;Silence, exile and cunning, yes. And courage.&quot;

Christopher Hitchens recalled: &quot;When the &quot;Washington Post&quot; telephoned me on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1989 to ask for my opinion about the Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s &quot;fatwah&quot;, I felt at once here was something that completely committed me. It was, if I can phrase it like this, a matter of everything I hated versus everything I loved. In the hate column: dictatorship, religion, stupidity, demagogy, censorship, bullying, and intimidation. In the love column: literature, irony, humour, the individual, and the defense of free expression. Plus, of course, friendship–although I&#x27;d like to think my response would have been the same even if I hadn&#x27;t known Salman at all. To re-state the premise of the argument again: the theocratic head of a foreign despotism offers money in his own name in order to suborn the murder of a civilian of another country, for the offense of writing a work of fiction. No more root-and-branch challenge to the values of the Enlightenment (on the bicentennial of the fall of the Bastille), or to the First Amendment to the Constitution, could be imagined.&quot; Rushdie wrote: &quot;I have often been asked if Christopher defended me because he was my close friend. The truth is that he became my close friend because he wanted to defend me ... He and I found ourselves describing our ideas, without conferring, in almost identical terms. I began to understand that while I had not chosen the battle it was at least the right battle, because in it everything that I loved and valued (literature, freedom, irreverence, freedom, irreligion, freedom) was ranged against everything I detested (fanaticism, violence, bigotry, humorlessness, philistinism, and the new offense culture of the age). Then I read Christopher using exactly the same everything-he-loved-versus-everything-he-hated trope, and felt … understood.&quot;

In 1993, 100 writers and intellectuals from the Muslim world, including Adonis, Mohammed Arkoun, Mahmoud Darwish, Amin Maalouf and Edward Said expressed solidarity in the collection &quot;For Rushdie&quot;. Naguib Mahfouz wrote: &quot;The veritable terrorism of which he is a target is unjustifiable, indefensible. One idea can only be opposed by other ideas. Even if the punishment is carried out, the idea as well as the book will remain.&quot; Tahar Ben Jelloun wrote that the fatwa was &quot;intolerable, inadmissible and has nothing to do with the tolerant Islam that I was taught&quot; and threatened &quot;the ability to create characters and develop them in the space and time chosen by the writer.&quot; Rabah Belamri wrote &quot;A society that refuses to question itself, that denies artists and thinkers the right to raise doubts, that dares not laugh at itself, has no hope of prospering.&quot; The composer Ahmed Essyad wrote a piece of music dedicated &quot;To Salman Rushdie, so that, as an artist, he can write what I disagree with.&quot; Rushdie expressed gratitude for &quot;anthology of blows struck in the fight against obscurantism and fanaticism&quot; by &quot;the most gifted, the most learned, the most important voices of the Muslim and Arab world, gathered together to subject my work and the furor surrounding it to so brilliant, so many-sided, so judicious an examination.&quot;

When, on BBC Radio 4, he was asked for a response to the threat, Rushdie said, &quot;Frankly, I wish I had written a more critical book,&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m very sad that it should have happened. It&#x27;s not true that this book is a blasphemy against Islam. I doubt very much that Khomeini or anyone else in Iran has read the book or more than selected extracts out of context.&quot; Later, he wrote that he was &quot;proud, then and always&quot;, of that statement; while he did not feel his book was especially critical of Islam, &quot;a religion whose leaders behaved in this way could probably use a little criticism.&quot;

The publication of the book and the &quot;fatwa&quot; sparked violence around the world, with bookstores firebombed. Muslim communities in several nations in the West held public rallies, burning copies of the book. Several people associated with translating or publishing the book were attacked, seriously injured, and even killed. Many more people died in riots in some countries. Despite the danger posed by the fatwa, Rushdie made a public appearance at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium on 11 August 1993, during a concert by U2. In 2010, U2 bassist Adam Clayton recalled that &quot;lead vocalist Bono had been calling Salman Rushdie from the stage every night on the Zoo TV tour. When we played Wembley, Salman showed up in person and the stadium erupted. You [could] tell from [drummer] Larry Mullen, Jr.&#x27;s face that we weren&#x27;t expecting it. Salman was a regular visitor after that. He had a backstage pass and he used it as often as possible. For a man who was supposed to be in hiding, it was remarkably easy to see him around the place.&quot;

On 24 September 1998, as a precondition to the restoration of diplomatic relations with the UK, the Iranian government, then headed by Mohammad Khatami, gave a public commitment that it would &quot;neither support nor hinder assassination operations on Rushdie.&quot;

Hardliners in Iran have continued to reaffirm the death sentence. In early 2005, Khomeini&#x27;s &quot;fatwa&quot; was reaffirmed by Iran&#x27;s current leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a message to Muslim pilgrims making the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Additionally, the Revolutionary Guards declared that the death sentence on him is still valid.

Rushdie has reported that he still receives a &quot;sort of Valentine&#x27;s card&quot; from Iran each year on 14 February letting him know the country has not forgotten the vow to kill him and has jokingly referred to it as &quot;my unfunny Valentine&quot;. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s reached the point where it&#x27;s a piece of rhetoric rather than a real threat.&quot; Despite the threats on Rushdie personally, he said that his family has never been threatened, and that his mother, who lived in Pakistan during the later years of her life, even received outpourings of support. Rushdie himself has been prevented from entering Pakistan, however.

A former bodyguard to Rushdie, Ron Evans, planned to publish a book recounting the behaviour of the author during the time he was in hiding. Evans said Rushdie tried to profit financially from the &quot;fatwa&quot; and was suicidal, but Rushdie dismissed the book as a &quot;bunch of lies&quot; and took legal action against Evans, his co-author and their publisher. On 26 August 2008, Rushdie received an apology at the High Court in London from all three parties. A memoir of his years of hiding, &quot;Joseph Anton&quot;, was released on 18 September 2012; &quot;Joseph Anton&quot; was Rushdie&#x27;s secret alias during the height of the controversy.

In February 1997, Ayatollah Hasan Sane&#x27;i, leader of the &quot;bonyad panzdah-e khordad&quot; (Fifteenth of Khordad Foundation),
reported that the blood money offered by the foundation for the assassination of Rushdie would be increased from $2 million to $2.5 million. Then a semi-official religious foundation in Iran increased the reward it had offered for the killing of Rushdie from $2.8 million to $3.3 million.

In November 2015, former Indian minister P. Chidambaram acknowledged that banning &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; was wrong. In 1998, Iran&#x27;s former president Mohammad Khatami proclaimed the fatwa &quot;finished&quot;; but it has never been officially lifted, and in fact has been reiterated several times by Ali Khamenei and other religious officials. Yet more money was added to the bounty in February 2016.

===Failed assassination attempt (1989)===
On 3 August 1989, while Mustafa Mahmoud Mazeh was priming a book bomb loaded with RDX explosives in a hotel in Paddington, Central London, the bomb exploded prematurely, destroying two floors of the hotel and killing Mazeh. A previously unknown Lebanese group, the Organization of the Mujahidin of Islam, said he died preparing an attack &quot;on the apostate Rushdie&quot;. There is a shrine in Tehran&#x27;s Behesht-e Zahra cemetery for Mustafa Mahmoud Mazeh that says he was &quot;Martyred in London, 3 August 1989. The first martyr to die on a mission to kill Salman Rushdie.&quot; Mazeh&#x27;s mother was invited to relocate to Iran, and the Islamic World Movement of Martyrs&#x27; Commemoration built his shrine in the cemetery that holds thousands of Iranian soldiers slain in the Iran–Iraq War.

===Translators Attacked ===
In 1991 an Italian translator of the book was stabbed but survived. Days later Hitoshi Igarashi, its Japanese translator and a convert to Islam, was stabbed to death. Two years later its Norwegian publisher, William Nygaard, was shot three times but survived.

=== Hezbollah&#x27;s comments (2006) ===
During the 2006 &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons controversy, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah declared that &quot;If there had been a Muslim to carry out Imam Khomeini&#x27;s &quot;fatwa&quot; against the renegade Salman Rushdie, this rabble who insult our Prophet Mohammed in Denmark, Norway and France would not have dared to do so. I am sure there are millions of Muslims who are ready to give their lives to defend our prophet&#x27;s honour and we have to be ready to do anything for that.&quot;

===&quot;International Guerillas&quot; (1990)===
In 1990, soon after the publication of &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, a Pakistani film entitled &quot;International Gorillay&quot; (&quot;International Guerillas&quot;) was released that depicted Rushdie as a &quot;James Bond-style villain&quot; plotting to cause the downfall of Pakistan by opening a chain of casinos and discos in the country; he is ultimately killed at the end of the movie. The film was popular with Pakistani audiences, and it &quot;presents Rushdie as a Rambo-like figure pursued by four Pakistani guerrillas&quot;. The British Board of Film Classification refused to allow it a certificate; &quot;it was felt that the portrayal of Rushdie might qualify as criminal libel, causing a breach of the peace as opposed to merely tarnishing his reputation.&quot; This effectively prevented the release of the film in the UK. Two months later, however, Rushdie himself wrote to the board, saying that while he thought the film &quot;a distorted, incompetent piece of trash&quot;, he would not sue if it were released. He later said, &quot;If that film had been banned, it would have become the hottest video in town: everyone would have seen it&quot;. While the film was a great hit in Pakistan, it went virtually unnoticed elsewhere.

===Al-Qaeda hit list (2010)===
In 2010, Anwar al-Awlaki published an Al-Qaeda hit list in &quot;Inspire&quot; magazine, including Rushdie along with other figures claimed to have insulted Islam, including Ayaan Hirsi Ali, cartoonist Lars Vilks, and three &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; staff members: Kurt Westergaard, Carsten Juste, and Flemming Rose. The list was later expanded to include Stéphane &quot;Charb&quot; Charbonnier, who was murdered in a terror attack on &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; in Paris, along with 11 other people. After the attack, Al-Qaeda called for more killings.

Rushdie expressed his support for &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot;, saying &quot;I stand with &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot;, as we all must, to defend the art of satire, which has always been a force for liberty and against tyranny, dishonesty and stupidity ... religious totalitarianism has caused a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam and we see the tragic consequences in Paris today.&quot; In response to the attack, Rushdie commented on what he perceived as victim-blaming in the media, stating: &quot;You can dislike &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot;... But the fact that you dislike them has nothing to do with their right to speak. The fact you dislike them certainly doesn&#x27;t in any way excuse their murder.&quot;

===Jaipur Literature Festival (2012)===

Rushdie was due to appear at the Jaipur Literature Festival in January 2012 in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. However, he later cancelled his event appearance, and a further tour of India at the time, citing a possible threat to his life as the primary reason. Several days after, he indicated that state police agencies had lied, in order to keep him away, when they informed him that paid assassins were being sent to Jaipur to kill him. Police contended that they were afraid Rushdie would read from the banned &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, and that the threat was real, considering imminent protests by Muslim organizations.

Meanwhile, Indian authors Ruchir Joshi, Jeet Thayil, Hari Kunzru and Amitava Kumar abruptly left the festival, and Jaipur, after reading excerpts from Rushdie&#x27;s banned novel at the festival. The four were urged to leave by organizers as there was a real possibility they would be arrested.

A proposed video link session between Rushdie and the Jaipur Literature Festival was also cancelled at the last minute after the government pressured the festival to stop it. Rushdie returned to India to address a conference in New Delhi on 16 March 2012.

===Chautauqua attack (2022)===

On 12 August 2022, while about to start a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York, Rushdie was attacked by a man who rushed onto the stage and stabbed him repeatedly, including in the face, neck and abdomen. The attacker was pulled away before being taken into custody by a state trooper; Rushdie was airlifted to UPMC Hamot, a tertiary trauma centre in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he underwent surgery before being put on a ventilator.

Security measures at UPMC Hamot were increased due to the potential threat of further attempts on his life. This included 24-hour protection with a security officer outside his room and searches being performed upon entry into the hospital. The suspect was identified as 24-year-old Hadi Matar of Fairview, New Jersey. Later in the day, Rushdie&#x27;s agent, Andrew Wylie, confirmed that Rushdie had received stab injuries to the liver and hand, and that he might lose an eye. A day later, Rushdie was taken off the ventilator and was able to speak.

On 23 October 2022, Wylie reported that Rushdie had lost sight in one eye and the use of one hand but survived the murder attempt. Rushdie&#x27;s memoir about the attack, &quot;&quot;, was published in April 2024. It hit number one in the Sunday Times Bestsellers List in the General hardbacks category. In the memoir, Rushdie engages in fictional conversations with the assailant, who is referred to as &#x27;A.&#x27;

The jury selection for the trial was originally scheduled to begin on 8 January 2024. However, Matar&#x27;s lawyer successfully petitioned to delay the trial, arguing that they are entitled to see the memoir and any related materials before Matar stands trial, as the documents constitute evidence.

Rushdie recalled experiencing a vivid dream of being stabbed in an ancient Roman amphitheatre two days before the actual stabbing occurred. The intensity of the dream caused him to consider canceling the event until he eventually decided on attending.

In February 2025, the attacker, Hadi Matar, was found guilty of attempted murder and assault in connection with the stabbing.

==Awards, honours, and recognition==
Salman Rushdie has received many plaudits for his writings, including the European Union&#x27;s Aristeion Prize for Literature, the Premio Grinzane Cavour (Italy), and the Writer of the Year Award in Germany, and many of literature&#x27;s highest honours.

Awards and honours include:

===Knighthood===

Rushdie was knighted for services to literature in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours on 16 June 2007. He remarked: &quot;I am thrilled and humbled to receive this great honour, and am very grateful that my work has been recognised in this way.&quot; In response to his knighthood, many nations with Muslim majorities protested. Parliamentarians of several of these countries condemned the action, and Iran and Pakistan called in their British envoys to protest formally. Controversial condemnation issued by Pakistan&#x27;s Religious Affairs Minister Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq was in turn rebuffed by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Several called publicly for his death. Some non-Muslims expressed disappointment at Rushdie&#x27;s knighthood, claiming that the writer did not merit such an honour and there were several other writers who deserved the knighthood more than Rushdie.

Al-Qaeda condemned the Rushdie honour. The group&#x27;s then-leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was quoted as saying in an audio recording that the UK&#x27;s award for Rushdie was &quot;an insult to Islam&quot;, and it was planning &quot;a very precise response.&quot;

When asked if the knighthood was an insult to Muslims, Christopher Hitchens answered &quot;&quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; did not just win the Booker, and Salman did not just later win the Booker of Bookers, &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; won the main literary award in Iran, people tend to forget. When the fatwa was issued against him by a senile theocratic dictator who had run his own country into beggary and bankruptcy and misery, every Arab and Muslim writer worthy of the name, all signed, and wrote in a book for Salman, we identify our cause with you, and your struggle with free expression in our culture. If you say that Muslims are being offended by this, and you lump them all together, you immediately grant that they are in fact represented by the most extreme, homicidal, fanatical, illiterate, intolerant people who not only haven&#x27;t read this book, but couldn&#x27;t read it. And that&#x27;s an insult to Islam!&quot;

Rushdie was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2022 Birthday Honours for services to literature.

==Religious and political beliefs==
===Religious background===
Rushdie came from a liberal Muslim family, but he is an atheist. In a 2006 interview with PBS, Rushdie called himself a &quot;hardline atheist&quot;.

In 1989, in an interview following the &quot;fatwa&quot;, Rushdie said that he was in a sense a lapsed Muslim, though &quot;shaped by Muslim culture more than any other,&quot; and a student of Islam. In another interview the same year, he said, &quot;My point of view is that of a secular human being. I do not believe in supernatural entities, whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim or Hindu.&quot;

In December 1990, Rushdie issued a statement reaffirming his Muslim faith, distancing himself from statements made by characters in &quot;Satanic Verses&quot; that cast aspersion on Islam or Prophet Mohammad, and opposing the release of the paperback editing of the novel. Later, in 1992, he cited the release of the statement as perhaps his lowest point, regretting its language, which he said he had not written.

Rushdie advocates the application of higher criticism, pioneered during the late 19th century. In a guest opinion piece printed in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; in mid-August 2005, Rushdie called for a reform in Islam.

Rushdie is a critic of moral and cultural relativism. In an interview with Point of Inquiry in 2006, he described his view as follows:

Rushdie is an advocate of religious satire. He condemned the Charlie Hebdo shooting and defended comedic criticism of religions in a comment originally posted on English PEN where he called religions a medieval form of unreason. Rushdie called the attack a consequence of &quot;religious totalitarianism&quot;, which according to him had caused &quot;a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam&quot;. He said:

When asked about reading and writing as a human right, Rushdie states: &quot;...there are the larger stories, the grand narratives that we live in, which are things like nation, and family, and clan, and so on. Those stories are considered to be treated reverentially. They need to be part of the way in which we conduct the discourse of our lives and to prevent people from doing something very damaging to human nature.&quot; Though Rushdie believes the freedoms of literature to be universal, the bulk of his fictions portrays the struggles of the marginally underrepresented. This can be seen in his portrayal of the role of women in his novel &quot;Shame&quot;. In this novel, Rushdie, &quot;suggests that it is women who suffer most from the injustices of the Pakistani social order.&quot; His support of feminism can also be seen in a 2015 interview with &quot;New York&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The Cut&quot;.

===Political background===
====UK politics====

In 2006, Rushdie stated that he supported comments by Jack Straw, then-Leader of the House of Commons from Labour, who criticized the wearing of the niqab (a veil that covers all of the face except the eyes). Rushdie stated that his three sisters would never wear the veil. He said, &quot;I think the battle against the veil has been a long and continuing battle against the limitation of women, so in that sense I&#x27;m completely on Straw&#x27;s side.&quot;

====US politics====

Rushdie supported the 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, leading historian Tariq Ali to label Rushdie part of what he considered to be &quot;warrior writers&quot; as &quot;the belligerati&quot;. He was supportive of the US-led campaign to remove the Taliban in Afghanistan, which began in 2001 but was a vocal critic of the 2003 war in Iraq. He stated that while there was a &quot;case to be made for the removal of Saddam Hussein&quot;, US unilateral military intervention was unjustifiable. Terry Eagleton, a former admirer of Rushdie&#x27;s work and Marxist literary critic, criticized him, saying he &quot;cheered on the Pentagon&#x27;s criminal ventures in Iraq and Afghanistan.&quot; Eagleton subsequently apologized for having misrepresented Rushdie&#x27;s views.

Rushdie supported the election of Barack Obama for the US presidency and has often criticized the Republican Party. He was involved in the Occupy Movement, both as a presence at Occupy Boston and as a founding member of Occupy Writers. Rushdie is a supporter of gun control, blaming a shooting at a Colorado cinema in July 2012 on the American right to keep and bear arms. He acquired American citizenship in 2016 and voted for Hillary Clinton in that year&#x27;s election.

Noting the rise of &quot;populist authoritarian demagoguery&quot; around the world, Rushdie said there was &quot;a willingness amongst at least some part of the [US] population to cease to value the democratic values enshrined in the first amendment. So I think the problem is, I would now say, political more than primarily religious&quot;.

====Against religious extremism====
In the wake of the &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons controversy in March 2006 Rushdie signed the manifesto &quot;Together Facing the New Totalitarianism&quot;, a statement warning of the dangers of religious extremism. The Manifesto was published in the left-leaning French weekly &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; in March 2006. When Amnesty International suspended human rights activist Gita Sahgal for saying to the press that she thought the organization should distance itself from Moazzam Begg and his organization, Rushdie said: Amnesty…has done its reputation incalculable damage by allying itself with Moazzam Begg and his group Cageprisoners, and holding them up as human rights advocates. It looks very much as if Amnesty&#x27;s leadership is suffering from a kind of moral bankruptcy, and has lost the ability to distinguish right from wrong. It has greatly compounded its error by suspending the redoubtable Gita Sahgal for the crime of going public with her concerns. Gita Sahgal is a woman of immense integrity and distinction. ... It is people like Gita Sahgal who are the true voices of the human rights movement; Amnesty and Begg have revealed, by their statements and actions, that they deserve our contempt.

In July 2020, Rushdie was one of the 153 signers of the &quot;Harper&#x27;s Letter&quot;, also known as &quot;A Letter on Justice and Open Debate&quot;, that expressed concern that &quot;the free exchange of information and ideas, the lifeblood of a liberal society, is daily becoming more constricted.&quot; In October 2023, Rushdie expressed his &quot;horror&quot; at both Hamas&#x27; attack on Israel and Israel&#x27;s retaliation in the Gaza Strip and called for a &quot;cessation in hostilities&quot;.

In May 2024, Rushdie argued that if a Palestinian state ever came into being, it would resemble a &quot;Taliban-like state&quot; and become a client state of Iran. He further stated, &quot;There&#x27;s an emotional reaction to the death in Gaza, and that&#x27;s absolutely right. But when it slides over towards antisemitism and sometimes to actual support of Hamas, then it&#x27;s very problematic.&quot; He voiced his puzzlement regarding the current support of progressive students for what he described as a &quot;fascist terrorist group&quot;.

====South Asian politics and Kashmir====
Rushdie has been critical of Pakistan&#x27;s former Prime Minister Imran Khan after Khan took personal jabs at him in a 2012 interview. Khan had called Rushdie &quot;unbalanced&quot;, saying he has the &quot;mindset of a small man&quot;, claiming they had &quot;never met&quot; and he would never &quot;want to meet him ever&quot;, despite the two being spotted together in public numerous times.

Rushdie has expressed his preference for India over Pakistan on numerous occasions in writing and on live television interviews. In one such interview in 2003, Rushdie claimed &quot;Pakistan sucks&quot; after being asked about why he felt more like an outsider there than in India or England. He cited India&#x27;s diversity, openness, and &quot;richness of life experience&quot; as his preference over Pakistan&#x27;s &quot;airlessness&quot;, resulting from a lack of personal freedom, widespread public corruption, and inter-ethnic tension.

In Indian politics, Rushdie has criticized the Bharatiya Janata Party and its chairperson, the incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In a 2006 interview about his novel &quot;Shalimar the Clown&quot;, Rushdie laments the division of Kashmir into zones of Indian and Pakistani administration as having cut his family down the middle. In August 2019, he criticized the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, tweeting: &quot;Even from seven thousand miles away it&#x27;s clear that what&#x27;s happening in Kashmir is an atrocity. Not much to celebrate this August 15th.&quot; He has previously referred to crackdowns in Indian-administered Kashmir as pretexts for the rise of jihadism in the region:The phrase of &quot;crackdown&quot; that the Indian army uses really is a euphemism of mass destruction. And rape. And brutalisation. That happens all the time. It&#x27;s still happening now. ... The decision to treat all Kashmiris as if they&#x27;re potential terrorists is what has unleashed this, the kind of &quot;holocaust&quot; against the Kashmiri people. And we know ourselves, from most recent events in Europe, how important it is to resist treating all Muslims as if they&#x27;re terrorists, but the Indian army has taken the decision to do the opposite of that, to actually decide that everybody is a potential combatant to treat them in that way. And the level of brutality is quite spectacular. And, frankly, without that the jihadists would have had very little response from the Kashmiri people who were not really traditionally interested in radical Islam. So now they&#x27;re caught between the devil and the deep blue sea, and that&#x27;s the tragedy of the place. ... And really what I was trying to do was say exactly that the attraction of the jihad in Kashmir arose out of the activities of the Indian army. 

==Personal life==
Rushdie has been married five times and has two children; his first four marriages ended in divorce. He was first married to Clarissa Luard, literature officer of the Arts Council of England, from 1976 to 1987. The couple had a son, Zafar, born in 1979, who is married to the London-based jazz singer Natalie Coyle. He left Clarissa Luard in the mid-1980s for the Australian writer Robyn Davidson, to whom he was introduced by their mutual friend Bruce Chatwin. Rushdie and Davidson never married, and they had split up by the time his divorce from Clarissa came through in 1987. Rushdie&#x27;s second wife was the American novelist Marianne Wiggins; they were married in 1988 and divorced in 1993. His third wife, from 1997 to 2004, was British editor and author Elizabeth West; they have a son, Milan, born in 1997. After a miscarriage, the couple ended their relationship in 2004.

In 2004, very shortly after his third divorce, Rushdie married Padma Lakshmi, an Indian-born actress, model, television personality, producer, author, businessperson, and activist. At the time of their first meeting in 1999, Lakshmi was 28, while Rushdie was 51. Rushdie stated that Lakshmi had asked for a divorce in January 2007, and later that year, in July, the couple filed it. Padma Lakshmi criticized Rushdie as insecure and spoiled, stating he constantly craved praise and demanded &quot;frequent sex.&quot; Rushdie derided her, calling her a &quot;bad investment.&quot; Lakshmi also stated that Rushdie was insensitive to her painful endometriosis.

Following his split from Lakshmi, Rushdie was frequently seen with various women, including Riya Sen, journalist Aita Ighodaro, and actresses Olivia Wilde and Rosario Dawson, among others. In 2009, actress Pia Glenn slammed him as &quot;cowardly, dysfunctional, and immature&quot; after he dumped her via email.

In 2021, Rushdie married American poet and novelist Rachel Eliza Griffiths.

In 1999, Rushdie had an operation to correct ptosis, a problem with the levator palpebrae superioris muscle that causes drooping of the upper eyelid. According to Rushdie, this condition made it increasingly difficult for him to open his eyes. He said: &quot;If I hadn&#x27;t had an operation, in a couple of years from now I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to open my eyes at all.&quot;

Since 2000, Rushdie has lived in the United States, mostly near Union Square in Lower Manhattan, New York City. He is a fan of the English football club Tottenham Hotspur. He has been a holder of the Person of Indian Origin Card, which grants certain rights to people of the Indian diaspora short of full citizenship.

<doc id="28724" wikidata="Q7498735" url="?curid=28724" title="Shirley Dean">
<text>Shirley Ann Dean (née Bryant; born 1935-36), considered moderate in Berkeley politics, is an American politician who served as the Mayor of Berkeley, California (1994-2002). Before serving two terms as Berkeley&#x27;s Mayor, Dean served on the Berkeley City Council for 15 years (1975–94) and was a leader of the Berkeley Democratic Club.

Shirley Dean grew up in a single parent family and graduated from Berkeley High School (1952). She was selected as a Distinguished Graduate in the Berkeley High School Hall of Fame and was the first in her family to attend college. She graduated with honors from UC Berkeley with a BA in Social Welfare in 1956.

During part of the time she served as Mayor, she worked half-time for UC Berkeley Undergraduate Admission and Relations with Schools and the Office of Admissions. Her responsibilities included writing the plan and supervising field work for the recruitment of minority students to the UC Berkeley campus and visiting high schools throughout California. She received two Distinguished Service Awards from UC Berkeley for her work before she retired in March 2000.

==Mayor==
Shirley Dean was first elected Mayor of Berkeley in 1994 after a close run-off race. Dean actually trailed in the November 1994 general election, with fellow council member Don Jelinek capturing 49.2% of the vote against Dean’s 45.5%. Under city law, that forced a runoff in December, which Dean won due to lower turnout in the college town.

She was re-elected by more than 56% of the vote in 1998. A month before her 1998 victory, her opponent, Don Jelinek, accused her of disguising her identity while visiting Wilmington College, the college attended by rival Council member and Jelinek supporter Kriss Worthington. Dean stated that she visited the school to read about Worthington in the college newspaper, a public record. She also stated she did not ask for non-public records and that upon the request of the college showed her California Driver License bearing her full name and address. There is no record that she used any material from the college newspaper.

During most of her two-term tenure as Mayor, she worked with divided City Council that had a 5-4 progressive majority. The position of mayor in the city of Berkeley is largely a symbolic post, carrying no more power than other council members. Dean compensated by working relentlessly on programs she thought were best for the city. For much of her career, Dean&#x27;s political base was the very active network of Berkeley neighborhood organizations; however, many of her critics and rivals found her to be too conservative. Dean and other members of the City Council were openly mocked at a city-sponsored art festival where a satirical mock City Council meeting was staged in which actors took over the Council Chambers and ridiculed Berkeley&#x27;s elected officials.

After September 11, when the progressive City Council majority voted to condemn the war in Afghanistan, Dean went on Fox News and reported that the Council’s actions were prompting a flood of letters and e-mails threatening an economic boycott of the City. On a television show regarding the issue, she called her Council colleagues who had voted for the measure “patriots” who had every right to protest.

Dean lost her bid for re-election in 2002 to fellow Democrat Tom Bates. The day before the election Tom Bates stole 1,000 copies of The Daily Californian because the paper had endorsed Dean. Bates was charged with the theft, pleaded guilty, was fined, and ordered to pay the paper restitution. Dean ran for Mayor against Bates once more in 2008, but was soundly defeated.

Dean&#x27;s accomplishments as Mayor include:
* Recognition for bringing the Arts and Theater District to life in Downtown Berkeley by establishing a public-private partnership with the Tony Award-winning Berkeley Repertory Theatre and bringing in the JazzSchool, Aurora Theater, and Nevo Center for the Performing Arts in one of Berkeley’s oldest buildings. The Arts and Theater District was showcased by the United States Conference of Mayors as an example of revitalization of a declining downtown area. It is estimated that over a 5-year period the city&#x27;s original investment of $5.5 million on Arts District projects generated over $150 million in public and private spending in the downtown area.
* Putting together the funding to build the Berkeley I-80 bridge a bicycle and pedestrian overpass that spans the multi-lane I-80 Freeway providing safe passage from the city to the Eastshore State Park and the Berkeley Marina.
* Development of a plan for City-sponsored housing assistance for people with AIDS to remain in their own homes based on the input of a task force she formed that included members of the AIDS community. The unanimously approved plan served as the precursor to the city obtaining federally sponsored supportive housing.
* Working to restore the landmark Marin Circle Fountain with private funds. The fountain is the largest public works gift ever given to the city of Berkeley.
* Working in partnership with Country Joe McDonald to honor veterans by bringing the “Wall that Heals”, a Vietnam War memorial, to Berkeley in honor of those who served, died and protested that war.
* Establish programs expanding and renovating the city&#x27;s library, constructing 800 new housing units including the Gaia Building downtown, and lowering crime.
* As Chair of the East Bay Public Safety Corridor, leading the East Bay regional effort to ban the sale of Saturday Night Specials, enact trigger lock ordinances, and impose special taxes on retailers who sell guns. This work was recognized by the United States Department of Justice and Attorney General Janet Reno as exemplary. She also secured private contributions to purchase an outdoor sculpture, “The Berkeley Peace Bell”, made from melted guns.

==Early political career==
Dean started her political career by organizing the Bonita-Berryman Neighborhood Association, which led to her appointment in 1971 to the city&#x27;s Planning Commission. In the early 70s, she worked with Urban Care to stop the development of a large shopping center on the waterfront. She also worked with Urban Care to achieve Council approval for what is recognized as one of the best Landmarks Preservation Ordinances in the Nation. In 1976, she was elected from a caucus in her congressional district as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in New York City pledged to Senator Frank Church.

Dean served on the Berkeley City Council for 15 years between 1975 and 1994. She was first elected to the City Council in 1975 as an at large member, she served on the council until 1982. When district elections were adopted in Berkeley in 1986 Dean was the first elected council member from District 5, she held the seat until 1994 when she was elected Mayor.

==Recent Community Involvement==
Since leaving the Mayor’s Office in 2002, Dean has been involved in several community and environmental organizations, serving on the boards of:

* Save Strawberry Canyon, an organization working to preserve the watershed and woodlands of Strawberry Canyon from proposed construction by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
* A Better Way, an East Bay social service and mental health agency that serves children and their families.
* Citizens for East Shore Parks (CESP), working to extend the waterfront park through Point Molate in Richmond, California.

In 2003, Dean was named Woman of the year by the Zonta Club of Berkeley/North Bay.
In 2009, Dean appeared in the documentary film &quot;Power Trip: Theatrically Berkeley&quot; about the controversial greening of Berkeley after the passage of Berkeley Proposition G.
Dean made headlines in 2007 when she, at age 71, city council member Betty Olds, 86, and noted environmentalist and co-founder of Save the Bay, Sylvia McLaughlin, 90, climbed a ladder to briefly join a tree-sit aimed at saving the Memorial Oak Grove outside the stadium of the University of California, Berkeley.
 After a 21-month protest, the oak trees were cut down.

<doc id="28728" wikidata="Q915682" url="?curid=28728" title="Superconducting magnetic energy storage">
<text>Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems store energy in the magnetic field created by the flow of direct current in a superconducting coil that has been cryogenically cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature. This use of superconducting coils to store magnetic energy was invented by M. Ferrier in 1970.

A typical SMES system includes three parts: superconducting coil, power conditioning system and cryogenically cooled refrigerator. Once the superconducting coil is energized, the current will not decay and the magnetic energy can be stored indefinitely.

The stored energy can be released back to the network by discharging the coil. The power conditioning system uses an inverter/rectifier to transform alternating current (AC) power to direct current or convert DC back to AC power. The inverter/rectifier accounts for about 2–3% energy loss in each direction. SMES loses the least amount of electricity in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy. SMES systems are highly efficient; the round-trip efficiency is greater than 95%.

Due to the energy requirements of refrigeration and the high cost of superconducting wire, SMES is currently used for short duration energy storage. Therefore, SMES is most commonly devoted to improving power quality.

== Advantages over other energy storage methods ==
There are several reasons for using superconducting magnetic energy storage instead of other energy storage methods. The most important advantage of SMES is that the time delay during charge and discharge is quite short. Power is available almost instantaneously and very high power output can be provided for a brief period of time. Other energy storage methods, such as pumped hydro or compressed air, have a substantial time delay associated with the energy conversion of stored mechanical energy back into electricity. Thus if demand is immediate, SMES is a viable option. Another advantage is that the loss of power is less than other storage methods because electric currents encounter almost no resistance. Additionally the main parts in a SMES are motionless, which results in high reliability.

== Current use ==
There are several small SMES units available for commercial use and several larger test bed projects. Several 1 MW·h units are used for power quality control in installations around the world, especially to provide power quality at manufacturing plants requiring ultra-clean power, such as microchip fabrication facilities.

These facilities have also been used to provide grid stability in distribution systems. SMES is also used in utility applications. In northern Wisconsin, a string of distributed SMES units were deployed to enhance stability of a transmission loop. The transmission line is subject to large, sudden load changes due to the operation of a paper mill, with the potential for uncontrolled fluctuations and voltage collapse.

The Engineering Test Model is a large SMES with a capacity of approximately 20 MW·h, capable of providing 40 MW of power for 30 minutes or 10 MW of power for 2 hours.

== System architecture ==
A SMES system typically consists of four parts

; Superconducting magnet and supporting structure :
This system includes the superconducting coil, a magnet and the coil protection. Here the energy is stored by disconnecting the coil from the larger system and then using electromagnetic induction from the magnet to induce a current in the superconducting coil. This coil then preserves the current until the coil is reconnected to the larger system, after which the coil partly or fully discharges.

; Refrigeration system :
The refrigeration system maintains the superconducting state of the coil by cooling the coil to the operating temperature.

; Power conditioning system :
The power conditioning system typically contains a power conversion system that converts DC to AC current and the other way around.

; Control system :
The control system monitors the power demand of the grid and controls the power flow from and to the coil. The control system also manages the condition of the SMES coil by controlling the refrigerator.

== Working principle ==
As a consequence of Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, any loop of wire that generates a changing magnetic field in time, also generates an electric field. This process takes energy out of the wire through the electromotive force (EMF). EMF is defined as electromagnetic work done on a unit charge when it has traveled one round of a conductive loop. The energy could now be seen as stored in the electric field. This process uses energy from the wire with power equal to the electric potential times the total charge divided by time. Where ℰ is the voltage or EMF. By defining the power we can calculate the work that is needed to create such an electric field. Due to energy conservation this amount of work also has to be equal to the energy stored in the field.
: formula_1

This formula can be rewritten in the easier to measure variable of electric current by the substitution.
: formula_2
where &quot;I&quot; is the electric current in Ampere. The EMF ℰ is an inductance and can thus be rewritten as:
: formula_3

Substitution now gives:
: formula_4
where &quot;L&quot; is just a linearity constant called the inductance measured in Henry. Now that the power is found, all that is left to do is fill in the work equation to find the work.
: formula_5

As said earlier the work has to be equal to the energy stored in the field. This entire calculation is based on a single looped wire. For wires that are looped multiple times the inductance &quot;L&quot; increases, as &quot;L&quot; is simply defined as the ratio between the voltage and rate of change of the current. In conclusion the stored energy in the coil is equal to:
: formula_6
where
* &quot;E&quot; = energy measured in joules
* &quot;L&quot; = inductance measured in henries
* &quot;I&quot; = current measured in amperes

Consider a cylindrical coil with conductors of a rectangular cross section. The mean radius of coil is &quot;R&quot;. &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are width and depth of the conductor. &quot;f&quot; is called form function, which is different for different shapes of coil. &quot;ξ&quot; (xi) and &quot;δ&quot; (delta) are two parameters to characterize the dimensions of the coil. We can therefore write the magnetic energy stored in such a cylindrical coil as shown below. This energy is a function of coil dimensions, number of turns and carrying current.
: formula_7
where
* &quot;E&quot; = energy measured in joules
* &quot;I&quot; = current measured in amperes
* &quot;f&quot;(&quot;ξ&quot;, &quot;δ&quot;) = form function, joules per ampere-meter
* &quot;N&quot; = number of turns of coil

== Solenoid versus toroid ==
Besides the properties of the wire, the configuration of the coil itself is an important issue from a mechanical engineering aspect. There are three factors that affect the design and the shape of the coil – they are: Inferior strain tolerance, thermal contraction upon cooling and Lorentz forces in an energized coil. Among them, the strain tolerance is crucial not because of any electrical effect, but because it determines how much structural material is needed to keep the SMES from breaking. For small SMES systems, the optimistic value of 0.3% strain tolerance is selected. Toroidal geometry can help to lessen the external magnetic forces and therefore reduces the size of mechanical support needed. Also, due to the low external magnetic field, toroidal SMES can be located near a utility or customer load.

For small SMES, solenoids are usually used because they are easy to coil and no pre-compression is needed. In toroidal SMES, the coil is always under compression by the outer hoops and two disks, one of which is on the top and the other is on the bottom to avoid breakage. Currently, there is little need for toroidal geometry for small SMES, but as the size increases, mechanical forces become more important and the toroidal coil is needed.

The older large SMES concepts usually featured a low aspect ratio solenoid approximately 100 m in diameter buried in earth. At the low extreme of size is the concept of micro-SMES solenoids, for energy storage range near 1 MJ.

== Low-temperature versus high-temperature superconductors ==
Under steady state conditions and in the superconducting state, the coil resistance is negligible. However, the refrigerator necessary to keep the superconductor cool requires electric power and this refrigeration energy must be considered when evaluating the efficiency of SMES as an energy storage device.

Although high-temperature superconductors (HTS) have higher critical temperature, flux lattice melting takes place in moderate magnetic fields around a temperature lower than this critical temperature. The heat loads that must be removed by the cooling system include conduction through the support system, radiation from warmer to colder surfaces, AC losses in the conductor (during charge and discharge), and losses from the cold–to-warm power leads that connect the cold coil to the power conditioning system. Conduction and radiation losses are minimized by proper design of thermal surfaces. Lead losses can be minimized by good design of the leads. AC losses depend on the design of the conductor, the duty cycle of the device and the power rating.

The refrigeration requirements for HTSC and low-temperature superconductor (LTSC) toroidal coils for the baseline temperatures of 77 K, 20 K, and 4.2 K, increases in that order. The refrigeration requirements here is defined as electrical power to operate the refrigeration system. As the stored energy increases by a factor of 100, refrigeration cost only goes up by a factor of 20. Also, the savings in refrigeration for an HTSC system is larger (by 60% to 70%) than for an LTSC systems.

== Cost ==

Whether HTSC or LTSC systems are more economical depends because there are other major components determining the cost of SMES: Conductor consisting of superconductor and copper stabilizer and cold support are major costs in themselves. They must be judged with the overall efficiency and cost of the device. Other components, such as vacuum vessel insulation, has been shown to be a small part compared to the large coil cost. The combined costs of conductors, structure and refrigerator for toroidal coils are dominated by the cost of the superconductor. The same trend is true for solenoid coils. HTSC coils cost more than LTSC coils by a factor of 2 to 4. HTSC was expected to be cheaper due to lower refrigeration requirements but this is not the case.

To gain some insight into costs consider a breakdown by major components of both HTSC and LTSC coils corresponding to three typical stored energy levels, 2, 20 and 200 MW·h. The conductor cost dominates the three costs for all HTSC cases and is particularly important at small sizes. The principal reason lies in the comparative current density of LTSC and HTSC materials. The critical current of HTSC wire is lower than LTSC wire generally in the operating magnetic field, about 5 to 10 teslas (T). Assume the wire costs are the same by weight. Because HTSC wire has lower (&quot;J&quot;c) value than LTSC wire, it will take much more wire to create the same inductance. Therefore, the cost of wire is much higher than LTSC wire. Also, as the SMES size goes up from 2 to 20 to 200 MW·h, the LTSC conductor cost also goes up about a factor of 10 at each step. The HTSC conductor cost rises a little slower but is still by far the costliest item.

The structure costs of either HTSC or LTSC go up uniformly (a factor of 10) with each step from 2 to 20 to 200 MW·h. But HTSC structure cost is higher because the strain tolerance of the HTSC (ceramics cannot carry much tensile load) is less than LTSC, such as Nb3Ti or Nb3Sn, which demands more structure materials. Thus, in the very large cases, the HTSC cost can not be offset by simply reducing the coil size at a higher magnetic field.

It is worth noting here that the refrigerator cost in all cases is so small that there is very little percentage savings associated with reduced refrigeration demands at high temperature. This means that if a HTSC, BSCCO for instance, works better at a low temperature, say 20K, it will certainly be operated there. For very small SMES, the reduced refrigerator cost will have a more significant positive impact. 
Clearly, the volume of superconducting coils increases with the stored energy. Also, we can see that the LTSC torus maximum diameter is always smaller for a HTSC magnet than LTSC due to higher magnetic field operation. In the case of solenoid coils, the height or length is also smaller for HTSC coils, but still much higher than in a toroidal geometry (due to low external magnetic field).

An increase in peak magnetic field yields a reduction in both volume (higher energy density) and cost (reduced conductor length). Smaller volume means higher energy density and cost is reduced due to the decrease of the conductor length. There is an optimum value of the peak magnetic field, about 7 T in this case. If the field is increased past the optimum, further volume reductions are possible with minimal increase in cost. The limit to which the field can be increased is usually not economic but physical and it relates to the impossibility of bringing the inner legs of the toroid any closer together and still leave room for the bucking cylinder.

The superconductor material is a key issue for SMES. Superconductor development efforts focus on increasing Jc and strain range and on reducing the wire manufacturing cost.

== Applications ==
The energy density, efficiency and the high discharge rate make SMES useful systems to incorporate into modern energy grids and green energy initiatives. The SMES system&#x27;s uses can be categorized into three categories: power supply systems, control systems and emergency/contingency systems.

; FACTS :
FACTS (flexible AC transmission system) devices are static devices that can be installed in electricity grids. These devices are used to enhance the controllability and power transfer capability of an electric power grid. The application of SMES in FACTS devices was the first application of SMES systems. The first realization of SMES using FACTS devices were installed by the Bonneville power authority in 1980. This system uses SMES systems to damp the low frequencies, which contributes to the stabilization of the power grid. In 2000, SMES based FACTS systems were introduced at key points in the northern Winston power grid to enhance the stability of the grid.

; Load leveling :
The use of electric power requires a stable energy supply that delivers a constant power. This stability is dependent on the amount of power used and the amount of power created. The power usage varies throughout the day, and also varies during the seasons. SMES systems can be used to store energy when the generated power is higher than the demand/Load, and release power when the load is higher than the generated power. Thereby compensating for power fluctuations. Using these systems makes it possible for conventional generating units to operate at a constant output that is more efficient and convenient. However, when the power imbalance between supply and demand lasts for a long time, the SMES may get completely discharged.

; Load frequency control :
When the load does not meet the generated power output, due to a load perturbation, this can cause the load to be larger than the rated power output of the generators. This for example can happen when wind generators don&#x27;t spin due to a sudden lack of wind. This load perturbation can cause a load-frequency control problem. This problem can be amplified in DFIG-based wind power generators. This load disparity can be compensated by power output from SMES systems that store energy when the generation is larger than the load. SMES based load frequency control systems have the advantage of a fast response when compared to contemporary control systems.

; Uninterruptible power supplies :
Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) are used to protect against power surges and shortfalls by supplying a continuous power supply. This compensation is done by switching from the failing power supply to a SMES systems that can almost instantaneously supply the necessary power to continue the operation of essential systems. The SMES based UPS are most useful in systems that need to be kept at certain critical loads.

; Circuit breaker reclosing :
When the power angle difference across a circuit breaker is too large, protective relays prevent the reclosing of the circuit breakers. SMES systems can be used in these situations to reduce the power angle difference across the circuit breaker. Thereby allowing the reclosing of the circuit breaker. These systems allow the quick restoration of system power after major transmission line outages.

; Spinning reserve :
Spinning reserve is the extra generating capacity that is available by increasing the power generation of systems that are connected to the grid. This capacity reserved by the system operator for the compensation of disruptions in the power grid. Due to the fast recharge times and fast alternating current to direct current conversion process of SMES systems, these systems can be used as a spinning reserve when a major grid of transmission line is out of service.

; SFCL :
Superconducting fault current limiters (SFCL) are used to limit current under a fault in the grid. In this system a superconductor is quenched (raised in temperature) when a fault in the gridline is detected. By quenching the superconductor the resistance rises and the current is diverted to other grid lines. This is done without interrupting the larger grid. Once the fault is cleared, the SFCL temperature is lowered and becomes invisible to the larger grid.

; Electromagnetic launchers :
Electromagnetic launchers are electric projectile weapons that use a magnetic field to accelerate projectiles to a very high velocity. These launchers require high power pulse sources in order to work. These launchers can be realised by the use of the quick release capability and the high power density of the SMES system.

== Future developments for SMES systems ==
Future developments in the components of SMES systems could make them more viable for other applications; specifically, superconductors with higher critical temperatures and critical current densities. These limits are the same faced in other industrial usage of superconductors. Recent development of HTS wire made of YBCO with a superconducting transition temperature of around 90 K shows promise.Typically, the higher the superconducting transition temperature, the higher the maximum current density the superconductor can sustain before Cooper pair breakdown. A substance with a high critical temperature will generally have a higher critical current at low temperature than a superconductor with a lower critical temperature. This higher critical current will raise the energy storage quadratically, which may make SMES and other industrial applications of superconductors cost-effective.

== Technical challenges ==
The energy content of current SMES systems is usually quite small. Methods to increase the energy stored in SMES often resort to large-scale storage units. As with other superconducting applications, cryogenics are a necessity. A robust mechanical structure is usually required to contain the very large Lorentz forces generated by and on the magnet coils. The dominant cost for SMES is the superconductor, followed by the cooling system and the rest of the mechanical structure.

; Mechanical support :
Needed because of large Lorentz forces generated by the strong magnetic field acting on the coil, and the strong magnetic field generated by the coil on the larger structure. 
; Size :
To achieve commercially useful levels of storage, around 5 GW·h (18 TJ), a SMES installation would need a loop of around 800 m. This is traditionally pictured as a circle, though in practice it could be more like a rounded rectangle. In either case it would require access to a significant amount of land to house the installation.
; Manufacturing :
here are two manufacturing issues around SMES. The first is the fabrication of bulk cable suitable to carry the current. The HTSC superconducting materials found to date are relatively delicate ceramics, making it difficult to use established techniques to draw extended lengths of superconducting wire. Much research has focused on layer deposit techniques, applying a thin film of material onto a stable substrate, but this is currently only suitable for small-scale electrical circuits.
; Infrastructure :
The second problem is the infrastructure required for an installation. Until room-temperature superconductors are found, the 800 m loop of wire would have to be contained within a vacuum flask of liquid nitrogen. This in turn would require stable support, most commonly envisioned by burying the installation.
; Critical magnetic field :
Above a certain field strength, known as the critical field, the superconducting state is destroyed. This means that there exists a maximum charging rate for the superconducting material, given that the magnitude of the magnetic field determines the flux captured by the superconducting coil.
; Critical current :
In general power systems look to maximize the current they are able to handle. This makes any losses due to inefficiencies in the system relatively insignificant. Unfortunately, large currents may generate magnetic fields greater than the critical field due to Ampere&#x27;s Law. Current materials struggle, therefore, to carry sufficient current to make a commercial storage facility economically viable.

Several issues at the onset of the technology have hindered its proliferation:
# Expensive refrigeration units and high power cost to maintain operating temperatures
# Existence and continued development of adequate technologies using normal conductors
These still pose problems for superconducting applications but are improving over time. Advances have been made in the performance of superconducting materials. Furthermore, the reliability and efficiency of refrigeration systems has improved significantly.

; Long precooling time :
At the moment it takes four months to cool the coil from room temperature to its operating temperature. This also means that the SMES takes equally long to return to operating temperature after maintenance and when restarting after operating failures.

; Protection :
Due to the large amount of energy stored, certain measures need to be taken to protect the coils from damage in the case of coil failure. The rapid release of energy in case of coil failure might damage surrounding systems. Some conceptual designs propose to incorporate a superconducting cable into the design with as goal the absorption of energy after coil failure. The system also needs to be kept in excellent electric isolation in order to prevent loss of energy.

<doc id="28729" wikidata="Q5447188" url="?curid=28729" title="Solution (chemistry)">
<text>In chemistry, a solution is defined by IUPAC as &quot;A liquid or solid phase containing more than one substance, when for convenience one (or more) substance, which is called the solvent, is treated differently from the other substances, which are called solutes. When, as is often but not necessarily the case, the sum of the mole fractions of solutes is small compared with unity, the solution is called a dilute solution. A superscript attached to the ∞ symbol for a property of a solution denotes the property in the limit of infinite dilution.&quot; One important parameter of a solution is the concentration, which is a measure of the amount of solute in a given amount of solution or solvent. The term &quot;aqueous solution&quot; is used when one of the solvents is water.

== Types ==
&quot;Homogeneous&quot; means that the components of the mixture form a single phase. &quot;Heterogeneous&quot; means that the components of the mixture are of different phase. The properties of the mixture (such as concentration, temperature, and density) can be uniformly distributed through the volume but only in absence of diffusion phenomena or after their completion. Usually, the substance present in the greatest amount is considered the solvent. Solvents can be gases, liquids, or solids. One or more components present in the solution other than the solvent are called solutes. The solution has the same physical state as the solvent.

=== Gaseous mixtures ===
If the solvent is a gas, only gases (non-condensable) or vapors (condensable) are dissolved under a given set of conditions. An example of a gaseous solution is air (oxygen and other gases dissolved in nitrogen). Since interactions between gaseous molecules play almost no role, non-condensable gases form rather trivial solutions. In the literature, they are not even classified as solutions, but simply addressed as homogeneous mixtures of gases. The Brownian motion and the permanent molecular agitation of gas molecules guarantee the homogeneity of the gaseous systems. Non-condensable gaseous mixtures (e.g., air/CO2, or air/xenon) do not spontaneously demix, nor sediment, as distinctly stratified and separate gas layers as a function of their relative density. Diffusion forces efficiently counteract gravitation forces under normal conditions prevailing on Earth. The case of condensable vapors is different: once the saturation vapor pressure at a given temperature is reached, vapor excess condenses into the liquid state.

=== Liquid solutions ===
Liquids dissolve gases, other liquids, and solids. An example of a dissolved gas is oxygen in water, which allows fish to breathe under water. An examples of a dissolved liquid is ethanol in water, as found in alcoholic beverages. An example of a dissolved solid is sugar water, which contains dissolved sucrose.

=== Solid solutions ===
If the solvent is a solid, then gases, liquids, and solids can be dissolved.
* Gas in solids:
** Hydrogen dissolves rather well in metals, especially in palladium; this is studied as a means of hydrogen storage.
* Liquid in solid:
** Mercury in gold, forming an amalgam
** Water in solid salt or sugar, forming moist solids
** Hexane in paraffin wax
** Polymers containing plasticizers such as phthalate (liquid) in PVC (solid)
* Solid in solid:
** Steel, basically a solution of carbon atoms in a crystalline matrix of iron atoms 
** Alloys like bronze and many others
** Radium sulfate dissolved in barium sulfate: a true solid solution of Ra in BaSO4

== Solubility ==

The ability of one compound to dissolve in another compound is called solubility. When a liquid can completely dissolve in another liquid the two liquids are &quot;miscible&quot;. Two substances that can never mix to form a solution are said to be &quot;immiscible&quot;.

All solutions have a positive entropy of mixing. The interactions between different molecules or ions may be energetically favored or not. If interactions are unfavorable, then the free energy decreases with increasing solute concentration. At some point, the energy loss outweighs the entropy gain, and no more solute particles can be dissolved; the solution is said to be saturated. However, the point at which a solution can become saturated can change significantly with different environmental factors, such as temperature, pressure, and contamination. For some solute-solvent combinations, a supersaturated solution can be prepared by raising the solubility (for example by increasing the temperature) to dissolve more solute and then lowering it (for example by cooling).

Usually, the greater the temperature of the solvent, the more of a given solid solute it can dissolve. However, most gases and some compounds exhibit solubilities that decrease with increased temperature. Such behavior is a result of an exothermic enthalpy of solution. Some surfactants exhibit this behaviour. The solubility of liquids in liquids is generally less temperature-sensitive than that of solids or gases.

== Properties ==

The physical properties of compounds such as melting point and boiling point change when other compounds are added. Together they are called colligative properties. There are several ways to quantify the amount of one compound dissolved in the other compounds collectively called concentration. Examples include molarity, volume fraction, and mole fraction.

The properties of ideal solutions can be calculated by the linear combination of the properties of its components. If both solute and solvent exist in equal quantities (such as in a 50% ethanol, 50% water solution), the concepts of &quot;solute&quot; and &quot;solvent&quot; become less relevant, but the substance that is more often used as a solvent is normally designated as the solvent (in this example, water).

== Liquid solution characteristics==

In principle, all types of liquids can behave as solvents: liquid noble gases, molten metals, molten salts, molten covalent networks, and molecular liquids. In the practice of chemistry and biochemistry, most solvents are molecular liquids. They can be classified into polar and non-polar, according to whether their molecules possess a permanent electric dipole moment. Another distinction is whether their molecules can form hydrogen bonds (protic and aprotic solvents). Water, the most commonly used solvent, is both polar and sustains hydrogen bonds.

Salts dissolve in polar solvents, forming positive and negative ions that are attracted to the negative and positive ends of the solvent molecule, respectively. If the solvent is water, hydration occurs when the charged solute ions become surrounded by water molecules. A standard example is aqueous saltwater. Such solutions are called electrolytes. Whenever salt dissolves in water ion association has to be taken into account.

Polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents, forming polar bonds or hydrogen bonds. As an example, all alcoholic beverages are aqueous solutions of ethanol. On the other hand, non-polar solutes dissolve better in non-polar solvents. Examples are hydrocarbons such as oil and grease that easily mix, while being incompatible with water.

An example of the immiscibility of oil and water is a leak of petroleum from a damaged tanker, that does not dissolve in the ocean water but rather floats on the surface.

<text>Security engineering is the process of incorporating security controls into an information system so that the controls become an integral part of the system&#x27;s operational capabilities. It is similar to other systems engineering activities in that its primary motivation is to support the delivery of engineering solutions that satisfy pre-defined functional and user requirements, but it has the added dimension of preventing misuse and malicious behavior. Those constraints and restrictions are often asserted as a security policy.

In one form or another, security engineering has existed as an informal field of study for several centuries. For example, the fields of locksmithing and security printing have been around for many years. The concerns for modern security engineering and computer systems were first solidified in a RAND paper from 1967, &quot;Security and Privacy in Computer Systems&quot; by Willis H. Ware. This paper, later expanded in 1979, provided many of the fundamental information security concepts, labelled today as Cybersecurity, that impact modern computer systems, from cloud implementations to embedded IoT.

Recent catastrophic events, most notably 9/11, have made security engineering quickly become a rapidly-growing field. In fact, in a report completed in 2006, it was estimated that the global security industry was valued at US $150 billion.

Security engineering involves aspects of social science, psychology (such as designing a system to &quot;fail well&quot;, instead of trying to eliminate all sources of error), and economics as well as physics, chemistry, mathematics, criminology architecture, and landscaping.
Some of the techniques used, such as fault tree analysis, are derived from safety engineering.

Other techniques such as cryptography were previously restricted to military applications. One of the pioneers of establishing security engineering as a formal field of study is Ross Anderson.

==Qualifications==
No single qualification exists to become a security engineer.

However, an undergraduate and/or graduate degree, often in computer science, computer engineering, or physical protection focused degrees such as Security Science, in combination with practical work experience (systems, network engineering, software development, physical protection system modelling etc.) most qualifies an individual to succeed in the field. Other degree qualifications with a security focus exist. Multiple certifications, such as the Certified Information Systems Security Professional, or Certified Physical Security Professional are available that may demonstrate expertise in the field. Regardless of the qualification, the course must include a knowledge base to diagnose the security system drivers, security theory and principles including defense in depth, protection in depth, situational crime prevention and crime prevention through environmental design to set the protection strategy (professional inference), and technical knowledge including physics and mathematics to design and commission the engineering treatment solution. A security engineer can also benefit from having knowledge in cyber security and information security. Any previous work experience related to privacy and computer science is also valued. 

All of this knowledge must be braced by professional attributes including strong communication skills and high levels of literacy for engineering report writing. Security engineering also goes by the label Security Science.

* Physical security
:*deter attackers from accessing a facility, resource, or information stored on physical media.
* Technical surveillance counter-measures
* Economics of security
:*the economic aspects of economics of privacy and computer security.

==Methodologies==
Technological advances, principally in the field of computers, have now allowed the creation of far more complex systems, with new and complex security problems. Because modern systems cut across many areas of human endeavor, security engineers not only need consider the mathematical and physical properties of systems; they also need to consider attacks on the people who use and form parts of those systems using social engineering attacks. Secure systems have to resist not only technical attacks, but also coercion, fraud, and deception by confidence tricksters.

===Web applications===

According to the &quot;Microsoft Developer Network&quot; the patterns and practices of security engineering consist of the following activities:
* Security Objectives
* Security Design Guidelines
* Security Modeling
* Security Architecture and Design Review
* Security Code Review
* Security Testing
* Security Tuning
* Security Deployment Review
These activities are designed to help meet security objectives in the software life cycle.

===Physical===
* Understanding of a &quot;typical&quot; threat and the usual risks to people and property.
* Understanding the incentives created both by the threat and the countermeasures.
* Understanding risk and threat analysis methodology and the benefits of an empirical study of the physical security of a facility.
* Understanding how to apply the methodology to buildings, critical infrastructure, ports, public transport and other facilities/compounds.
* Overview of common physical and technological methods of protection and understanding their roles in deterrence, detection and mitigation.
* Determining and prioritizing security needs and aligning them with the perceived threats and the available budget.
===Product===
Product security engineering is security engineering applied specifically to the products that an organization creates, distributes, and/or sells. Product security engineering is distinct from corporate/enterprise security, which focuses on securing corporate networks and systems that an organization uses to conduct business.

Product security includes security engineering applied to:
* Hardware devices such as cell phones, computers, Internet of things devices, and cameras.
* Software such as operating systems, applications, and firmware.

Such security engineers are often employed in separate teams from corporate security teams and work closely with product engineering teams.

====Target hardening====
Whatever the target, there are multiple ways of preventing penetration by unwanted or unauthorized persons. Methods include placing Jersey barriers, stairs or other sturdy obstacles outside tall or politically sensitive buildings to prevent car and truck bombings. Improving the method of visitor management and some new electronic locks take advantage of technologies such as fingerprint scanning, iris or retinal scanning, and voiceprint identification to authenticate users.

<doc id="28731" wikidata="Q1026648" url="?curid=28731" title="Stow-on-the-Wold">
<text>Stow-on-the-Wold is a market town and civil parish in Gloucestershire, England, on top of an 800-foot (244 m) hill at the junction of main roads through the Cotswolds, including the Fosse Way (A429), which is of Roman origin. The town was founded by Norman lords to absorb trade from the roads converging there. Fairs have been held by royal charter since 1330; a horse fair is still held on the edge of town nearest to Oddington in May and October each year.

==History==
===Early===
Stow-on-the-Wold, originally called Stow St Edward or Edwardstow after the town&#x27;s patron saint Edward, probably Edward the Martyr, is said to have originated as an Iron Age fort on this defensive position on a hill. There are other sites of similar forts in the area, and Stone Age and Bronze Age burial mounds are common throughout the area. It is likely that Maugersbury was the primary settlement of the parish before Stow was built as a marketplace on the hilltop nearer to the crossroads, to take advantage of passing trade. Originally the small settlement was controlled by abbots from the local abbey, and when the first weekly market was set up in 1107 by Henry I, he decreed that the proceeds go to Evesham Abbey.

In 1330, a royal charter by Edward III set up an annual 7-day market to be held in August. The royal charter granted a fair where sheep and horses were allowed to be sold. In 1476, Edward IV replaced that with two 5-day fairs, two days before and two days after the feast of St Philip and St James in May, and similarly in October on the feast of Edward the Confessor (the saint associated with the town). The aim of the annual charter fairs was to establish Stow as a place to trade and alleviate the unpredictability of the passing trade. These fairs were located in the square, which is still the town centre.

===Civil war===
Stow played a role in the English Civil War. A number of engagements took place in the area, the local church of St Edward being damaged in one skirmish. On 21 March 1646, the Royalists, commanded by Sir Jacob Astley, were defeated at the Battle of Stow-on-the-Wold, with hundreds of prisoners being confined for some time in St Edwards. This battle took place one mile north of Stow-on-the-Wold. After initial royalist success, the superiority of the parliamentary forces overwhelmed and routed the royalist forces. Fleeing the field, the royalists fought a running fight back into the streets of Stow, where the final action took place, culminating in surrender in the market square.

=== Modern ===
As the fairs grew in fame and importance, so did the town. Traders dealing in livestock added many handmade goods, and the wool trade was always prominent. Daniel Defoe reported in the 18th century that 20,000 sheep were sold in one day. Many alleys known as &#x27;tures&#x27; that run between buildings into the market square were used in herding sheep to be sold. From the mid-19th century, the Talbot Hotel was the venue for corn merchants carrying out their trade.

Most of the buildings around the market square dated from the 18th to 19th century including St Edward&#x27;s Hall (the present-day library).

As the wool trade declined, people began to trade in horses. The practice continues, although the fair has been moved from the square to a large field near the village of Maugersbury every May and October. It remains popular, with roads around Stow blocked by the extra traffic for many hours.

However, there has been controversy surrounding Stow Fair. The many visitors and traders have attracted more vendors not dealing in horses. Local businesses used to profit from the increased custom, but in recent years most pubs and shops close for 2–3 miles around due to the risks of theft or vandalism.

==Governance==
The town belongs to the Stow electoral ward, which covers the parishes of Stow-on-the-Wold, Maugersbury and Swell. In 2010 these parishes had a total population of 2,594. Stow ward is represented on Cotswold District Council by the Liberal Democrat Councillor Dilys Neill, who was first elected in the 2016 local elections. The Stow Division is represented on Gloucestershire County Council by the Conservative Councillor Mark Mackenzie-Charrington.

Stow-on-the-Wold also has a Parish Council with 10 members.

==Economy==
Scotts of Stow, a mail order company, also has two shops in the town.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Oxford and local relay transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Gloucestershire, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West and Cotswolds Radio, community based radio station 

The town is served by the local newspaper, Cotswold Journal.

==Popular culture==
* Given its exposed spot on the top of Stow Hill, the town is often referred to as &quot;Stow on the Wold, where the winds blow cold.&quot;
* Stow-on-the-Wold featured prominently in the eleventh episode of series 6 of &quot;Top Gear&quot;, when Jeremy Clarkson reviewed the Ford F-Series there. He chose it as a venue because it is a typical community in the English countryside, which Clarkson compares to the American countryside in the episode.
* The town, in the year 1067, is the setting of Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s short story &quot;The Unicorn Trap&quot;, published in the posthumous collection Armageddon in Retrospect.

==Transport==
The following roads pass through the town:
* The Fosse Way (A429) runs from the M4 motorway, just north of Chippenham, to the M40 motorway at Warwick
* The A424 links the town centre to the A44, near Bourton-on-the-Hill, which continues to Evesham
* The A436 connects Brockworth with Salford, Oxfordshire.

From 1881 until 1962, the town was served by Stow-on-the-Wold railway station on the Great Western Railway&#x27;s Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway. The nearest station is now at Moreton-in-Marsh, which is away, on the Cotswold Line between Hereford and London Paddington; services are provided by Great Western Railway. An alternative is at , away from Stow on the same line.

Local bus services are operated predominantly by Pulhams Coaches; key routes that serve the town lead to Moreton-in-Marsh, Hook Norton and Bourton-on-the-Water.

<doc id="28732" wikidata="Q1047561" url="?curid=28732" title="Spaghetti code">
<text>Spaghetti code is a pejorative phrase for difficult-to-maintain and unstructured computer source code. Code being developed with poor structure can be due to any of several factors, such as volatile project requirements, lack of programming style rules, and software engineers with insufficient ability or experience.

== Meaning ==
Code that overuses GOTO statements rather than structured programming constructs, resulting in convoluted and unmaintainable programs, is often called spaghetti code.
Such code has a complex and tangled control structure, resulting in a program flow that is conceptually like a bowl of spaghetti, twisted and tangled.

In a 1980 publication by the United States National Bureau of Standards, the phrase spaghetti program was used to describe older programs having &quot;fragmented and scattered files&quot;.

Spaghetti code can also describe an anti-pattern in which object-oriented code is written in a procedural style, such as by creating classes whose methods are overly long and messy, or forsaking object-oriented concepts like polymorphism. The presence of this form of spaghetti code can significantly reduce the comprehensibility of a system.

== History ==
It is not clear when the phrase spaghetti code came into common usage; however, several references appeared in 1977 including &quot;Macaroni is Better Than Spaghetti&quot; by Guy Steele. In the 1978 book &quot;A primer on disciplined programming using PL/I, PL/CS, and PL/CT&quot;, Richard Conway described programs that &quot;have the same clean logical structure as a plate of spaghetti&quot;, a phrase repeated in the 1979 book &quot;An Introduction to Programming&quot; he co-authored with David Gries. In the 1988 paper &quot;A spiral model of software development and enhancement&quot;, the term is used to describe the older practice of the &quot;code and fix model&quot;, which lacked planning and eventually led to the development of the waterfall model. In the 1979 book &quot;Structured programming for the COBOL programmer&quot;, author Paul Noll uses the phrases &quot;spaghetti code&quot; and &quot;rat&#x27;s nest&quot; as synonyms to describe poorly structured source code.

In the &quot;Ada – Europe &#x27;93&quot; conference, Ada was described as forcing the programmer to &quot;produce understandable, instead of spaghetti code&quot;, because of its restrictive exception propagation mechanism.

In a 1981 computer languages spoof in &quot;The Michigan Technic&quot; titled &quot;BASICally speaking...FORTRAN bytes!!&quot;, the author described FORTRAN stating that &quot;it consists entirely of spaghetti code&quot;.

Richard Hamming described in his lectures the etymology of the term in the context of early programming in binary codes:

== Related phrases ==
===Ravioli code===
Ravioli code is a term specific to object-oriented programming. It describes code that comprises well-structured classes that are easy to understand in isolation, but difficult to understand as a whole.

===Lasagna code===

Lasagna code refers to code whose layers are so complicated and intertwined that making a change in one layer would necessitate changes in all other layers.

== Examples ==
Here follows what would be considered a trivial example of spaghetti code in BASIC. The program prints each of the numbers 1 to 100 to the screen along with its square. Indentation is not used to differentiate the various actions performed by the code, and the program&#x27;s codice_1 statements create a reliance on line numbers. The flow of execution from one area to another is harder to predict. Real-world occurrences of spaghetti code are more complex and can add greatly to a program&#x27;s maintenance costs.
1 i=0
2 i=i+1
3 PRINT i;&quot;squared=&quot;;i*i
4 IF i&gt;=100 THEN GOTO 6
5 GOTO 2
6 PRINT &quot;Program Completed.&quot;
7 END
Here is the same code written in a structured programming style:
1 FOR i=1 TO 100
2 PRINT i;&quot;squared=&quot;;i*i
3 NEXT i
4 PRINT &quot;Program Completed.&quot;
5 END
The program jumps from one area to another, but this jumping is formal and more easily predictable, because for loops and functions provide flow control whereas the &quot;goto&quot; statement encourages arbitrary flow control. Though this example is small, real world programs are composed of many lines of code and are difficult to maintain when written in a spaghetti code fashion.

Here is another example of Spaghetti code with embedded GOTO statements.

 INPUT &quot;How many numbers should be sorted? &quot;; T
 DIM n(T)
 FOR i = 1 TO T
 PRINT &quot;NUMBER:&quot;; i
 INPUT n(i)
 NEXT i
 &#x27;Calculations:
 C = T
E180:
 C = INT(C / 2)
 IF C = 0 THEN GOTO C330
 D = T - C
 E = 1
I220:
 f = E
F230:
 g = f + C
 IF n(f) &gt; n(g) THEN SWAP n(f), n(g)
 f = f - C
 IF f &gt; 0 THEN GOTO F230
 E = E + 1
 IF E &gt; D THEN GOTO E180
 GOTO I220
C330:
 PRINT &quot;The sorted list is&quot;
 FOR i = 1 TO T
 PRINT n(i)
 NEXT i

<text>Steganography ( ) is the practice of representing information within another message or physical object, in such a manner that the presence of the concealed information would not be evident to an unsuspecting person&#x27;s examination. In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video. The word &quot;steganography&quot; comes from Greek &quot;steganographia&quot;, which combines the words &quot;steganós&quot; (), meaning &quot;covered or concealed&quot;, and &quot;-graphia&quot; () meaning &quot;writing&quot;.

The first recorded use of the term was in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius in his &quot;Steganographia&quot;, a treatise on cryptography and steganography, disguised as a book on magic. Generally, the hidden messages appear to be (or to be part of) something else: images, articles, shopping lists, or some other cover text. For example, the hidden message may be in invisible ink between the visible lines of a private letter. Some implementations of steganography that lack a formal shared secret are forms of security through obscurity, while key-dependent steganographic schemes try to adhere to Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle.

The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal. Whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned with concealing both the fact that a secret message is being sent &quot;and&quot; its contents.

Steganography includes the concealment of information within computer files. In digital steganography, electronic communications may include steganographic coding inside of a transport layer, such as a document file, image file, program, or protocol. Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of their large size. For example, a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of every hundredth pixel to correspond to a letter in the alphabet. The change is so subtle that someone who is not specifically looking for it is unlikely to notice the change.

==History==
The first recorded uses of steganography can be traced back to 440 BC in Greece, when Herodotus mentions two examples in his &quot;Histories&quot;. Histiaeus sent a message to his vassal, Aristagoras, by shaving the head of his most trusted servant, &quot;marking&quot; the message onto his scalp, then sending him on his way once his hair had regrown, with the instruction, &quot;When thou art come to Miletus, bid Aristagoras shave thy head, and look thereon.&quot; Additionally, Demaratus sent a warning about a forthcoming attack to Greece by writing it directly on the wooden backing of a wax tablet before applying its beeswax surface. Wax tablets were in common use then as reusable writing surfaces, sometimes used for shorthand.

In his work &quot;Polygraphiae,&quot; Johannes Trithemius developed his so-called &quot;Ave-Maria-Cipher&quot; that can hide information in a Latin praise of God. &quot;Auctor Sapientissimus Conseruans Angelica Deferat Nobis Charitas Potentissimi Creatoris&quot;, for example, contains the concealed word &quot;VICIPEDIA&quot;.

==Techniques==


Numerous techniques throughout history have been developed to embed a message within another medium.

===Physical===
Placing the message in a physical item has been widely used for centuries. Some notable examples include invisible ink on paper, writing a message in Morse code on yarn worn by a courier, microdots, or using a music cipher to hide messages as musical notes in sheet music.

==== Social steganography ====
In communities with social or government taboos or censorship, people use cultural steganography—hiding messages in idiom, pop culture references, and other messages they share publicly and assume are monitored. This relies on social context to make the underlying messages visible only to certain readers. Examples include:

* Hiding a message in the title and context of a shared video or image.
* Misspelling names or words that are popular in the media in a given week, to suggest an alternate meaning.
* Hiding a picture that can be traced by using Paint or any other drawing tool.

=== Digital messages ===


Since the dawn of computers, techniques have been developed to embed messages in digital cover mediums. The message to conceal is often encrypted, then used to overwrite part of a much larger block of encrypted data or a block of random data (an unbreakable cipher like the one-time pad generates ciphertexts that look perfectly random without the private key).

Examples of this include changing pixels in image or sound files, properties of digital text such as spacing and font choice, Chaffing and winnowing, Mimic functions, modifying the echo of a sound file (Echo Steganography)., and including data in ignored sections of a file.

=== Steganography in streaming media ===
Since the era of evolving network applications, steganography research has shifted from image steganography to steganography in streaming media such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).

In 2003, Giannoula et al. developed a data hiding technique leading to compressed forms of source video signals on a frame-by-frame basis.

In 2005, Dittmann et al. studied steganography and watermarking of multimedia contents such as VoIP.

In 2008, Yongfeng Huang and Shanyu Tang presented a novel approach to information hiding in low bit-rate VoIP speech stream, and their published work on steganography is the first-ever effort to improve the codebook partition by using Graph theory along with Quantization Index Modulation in low bit-rate streaming media.

In 2011 and 2012, Yongfeng Huang and Shanyu Tang devised new steganographic algorithms that use codec parameters as cover object to realise real-time covert VoIP steganography. Their findings were published in &quot;IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security&quot;.

In 2024, Cheddad &amp; Cheddad proposed a new framework for reconstructing lost or corrupted audio signals using a combination of machine learning techniques and latent information. The main idea of their paper is to enhance audio signal reconstruction by fusing steganography, halftoning (dithering), and state-of-the-art shallow and deep learning methods (e.g., RF, LSTM). This combination of steganography, halftoning, and machine learning for audio signal reconstruction may inspire further research in optimizing this approach or applying it to other domains, such as image reconstruction (i.e., inpainting).

=== Adaptive steganography ===
Adaptive steganography is a technique for concealing information within digital media by tailoring the embedding process to the specific features of the cover medium. An example of this approach is demonstrated in the work. Their method develops a skin tone detection algorithm, capable of identifying facial features, which is then applied to adaptive steganography. By incorporating face rotation into their approach, the technique aims to enhance its adaptivity to conceal information in a manner that is both less detectable and more robust across various facial orientations within images. This strategy can potentially improve the efficacy of information hiding in both static images and video content.

=== Cyber-physical systems/Internet of Things ===

Academic work since 2012 demonstrated the feasibility of steganography for cyber-physical systems (CPS)/the Internet of Things (IoT). Some techniques of CPS/IoT steganography overlap with network steganography, i.e. hiding data in communication protocols used in CPS/the IoT. However, specific techniques hide data in CPS components. For instance, data can be stored in unused registers of IoT/CPS components and in the states of IoT/CPS actuators.

===Printed===
Digital steganography output may be in the form of printed documents. A message, the &quot;plaintext&quot;, may be first encrypted by traditional means, producing a &quot;ciphertext&quot;. Then, an innocuous &quot;cover text&quot; is modified in some way so as to contain the ciphertext, resulting in the &quot;stegotext&quot;. For example, the letter size, spacing, typeface, or other characteristics of a cover text can be manipulated to carry the hidden message. Only a recipient who knows the technique used can recover the message and then decrypt it. Francis Bacon developed Bacon&#x27;s cipher as such a technique.

The ciphertext produced by most digital steganography methods, however, is not printable. Traditional digital methods rely on perturbing noise in the channel file to hide the message, and as such, the channel file must be transmitted to the recipient with no additional noise from the transmission. Printing introduces much noise in the ciphertext, generally rendering the message unrecoverable. There are techniques that address this limitation, one notable example being ASCII Art Steganography.
Although not classic steganography, some types of modern color laser printers integrate the model, serial number, and timestamps on each printout for traceability reasons using a dot-matrix code made of small, yellow dots not recognizable to the naked eye — see printer steganography for details.

=== Network ===
In 2015, a taxonomy of 109 network hiding methods was presented by Steffen Wendzel, Sebastian Zander et al. that summarized core concepts used in network steganography research. The taxonomy was developed further in recent years by several publications and authors and adjusted to new domains, such as CPS steganography.

In 1977, Kent concisely described the potential for covert channel signaling in general network communication protocols, even if the traffic is encrypted (in a footnote) in &quot;Encryption-Based Protection for Interactive User/Computer Communication,&quot; Proceedings of the Fifth Data Communications Symposium, September 1977.

In 1987, Girling first studied covert channels on a local area network (LAN), identified and realised three obvious covert channels (two storage channels and one timing channel), and his research paper entitled “Covert channels in LAN’s” published in &quot;IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering&quot;, vol. SE-13 of 2, in February 1987.

In 1989, Wolf implemented covert channels in LAN protocols, e.g. using the reserved fields, pad fields, and undefined fields in the TCP/IP protocol.

In 1997, Rowland used the IP identification field, the TCP initial sequence number and acknowledge sequence number fields in TCP/IP headers to build covert channels.

In 2002, Kamran Ahsan made an excellent summary of research on network steganography.

In 2005, Steven J. Murdoch and Stephen Lewis contributed a chapter entitled &quot;Embedding Covert Channels into TCP/IP&quot; in the &quot;Information Hiding&quot; book published by Springer.

All information hiding techniques that may be used to exchange steganograms in telecommunication networks can be classified under the general term of network steganography. This nomenclature was originally introduced by Krzysztof Szczypiorski in 2003. Contrary to typical steganographic methods that use digital media (images, audio and video files) to hide data, network steganography uses communication protocols&#x27; control elements and their intrinsic functionality. As a result, such methods can be harder to detect and eliminate.

Typical network steganography methods involve modification of the properties of a single network protocol. Such modification can be applied to the protocol data unit (PDU), to the time relations between the exchanged PDUs, or both (hybrid methods).

Moreover, it is feasible to utilize the relation between two or more different network protocols to enable secret communication. These applications fall under the term inter-protocol steganography. Alternatively, multiple network protocols can be used simultaneously to transfer hidden information and so-called control protocols can be embedded into steganographic communications to extend their capabilities, e.g. to allow dynamic overlay routing or the switching of utilized hiding methods and network protocols.

Network steganography covers a broad spectrum of techniques, which include, among others:
* Steganophony – the concealment of messages in Voice-over-IP conversations, e.g. the employment of delayed or corrupted packets that would normally be ignored by the receiver (this method is called LACK – Lost Audio Packets Steganography), or, alternatively, hiding information in unused header fields.
* WLAN Steganography – transmission of steganograms in Wireless Local Area Networks. A practical example of WLAN Steganography is the HICCUPS system (Hidden Communication System for Corrupted Networks)

==Additional terminology==

Discussions of steganography generally use terminology analogous to and consistent with conventional radio and communications technology. However, some terms appear specifically in software and are easily confused. These are the most relevant ones to digital steganographic systems:

The &quot;payload&quot; is the data covertly communicated. The &quot;carrier&quot; is the signal, stream, or data file that hides the payload, which differs from the &quot;channel&quot;, which typically means the type of input, such as a JPEG image. The resulting signal, stream, or data file with the encoded payload is sometimes called the &quot;package&quot;, &quot;stego file&quot;, or &quot;covert message&quot;. The proportion of bytes, samples, or other signal elements modified to encode the payload is called the &quot;encoding density&quot; and is typically expressed as a number between 0 and 1.

In a set of files, the files that are considered likely to contain a payload are &quot;suspects&quot;. A &quot;suspect&quot; identified through some type of statistical analysis can be referred to as a &quot;candidate&quot;.

==Countermeasures and detection==
Detecting physical steganography requires a careful physical examination, including the use of magnification, developer chemicals, and ultraviolet light. It is a time-consuming process with obvious resource implications, even in countries that employ many people to spy on other citizens. However, it is feasible to screen mail of certain suspected individuals or institutions, such as prisons or prisoner-of-war (POW) camps.

During World War II, prisoner of war camps gave prisoners specially-treated paper that would reveal invisible ink. An article in the 24 June 1948 issue of &quot;Paper Trade Journal&quot; by the Technical Director of the United States Government Printing Office had Morris S. Kantrowitz describe in general terms the development of this paper. Three prototype papers (&quot;Sensicoat&quot;, &quot;Anilith&quot;, and &quot;Coatalith&quot;) were used to manufacture postcards and stationery provided to German prisoners of war in the US and Canada. If POWs tried to write a hidden message, the special paper rendered it visible. The US granted at least two patents related to the technology, one to Kantrowitz, , &quot;Water-Detecting paper and Water-Detecting Coating Composition Therefor,&quot; patented 18 July 1950, and an earlier one, &quot;Moisture-Sensitive Paper and the Manufacture Thereof,&quot; , patented 20 July 1948. A similar strategy issues prisoners with writing paper ruled with a water-soluble ink that runs in contact with water-based invisible ink.

In computing, steganographically encoded package detection is called steganalysis. The simplest method to detect modified files, however, is to compare them to known originals. For example, to detect information being moved through the graphics on a website, an analyst can maintain known clean copies of the materials and then compare them against the current contents of the site. The differences, if the carrier is the same, comprise the payload. In general, using extremely high compression rates makes steganography difficult but not impossible. Compression errors provide a hiding place for data, but high compression reduces the amount of data available to hold the payload, raising the encoding density, which facilitates easier detection (in extreme cases, even by casual observation).

There are a variety of basic tests that can be done to identify whether or not a secret message exists. This process is not concerned with the extraction of the message, which is a different process and a separate step. The most basic approaches of steganalysis are visual or aural attacks, structural attacks, and statistical attacks. These approaches attempt to detect the steganographic algorithms that were used. These algorithms range from unsophisticated to very sophisticated, with early algorithms being much easier to detect due to statistical anomalies that were present. The size of the message that is being hidden is a factor in how difficult it is to detect. The overall size of the cover object also plays a factor as well. If the cover object is small and the message is large, this can distort the statistics and make it easier to detect. A larger cover object with a small message decreases the statistics and gives it a better chance of going unnoticed.

Steganalysis that targets a particular algorithm has much better success as it is able to key in on the anomalies that are left behind. This is because the analysis can perform a targeted search to discover known tendencies since it is aware of the behaviors that it commonly exhibits. When analyzing an image the least significant bits of many images are actually not random. The camera sensor, especially lower-end sensors are not the best quality and can introduce some random bits. This can also be affected by the file compression done on the image. Secret messages can be introduced into the least significant bits in an image and then hidden. A steganography tool can be used to camouflage the secret message in the least significant bits but it can introduce a random area that is too perfect. This area of perfect randomization stands out and can be detected by comparing the least significant bits to the next-to-least significant bits on an image that hasn&#x27;t been compressed.

Generally, though, there are many techniques known to be able to hide messages in data using steganographic techniques. None are, by definition, obvious when users employ standard applications, but some can be detected by specialist tools. Others, however, are resistant to detection—or rather it is not possible to reliably distinguish data containing a hidden message from data containing just noise—even when the most sophisticated analysis is performed. Steganography is being used to conceal and deliver more effective cyber attacks, referred to as &quot;Stegware&quot;. The term Stegware was first introduced in 2017 to describe any malicious operation involving steganography as a vehicle to conceal an attack. Detection of steganography is challenging, and because of that, not an adequate defence. Therefore, the only way of defeating the threat is to transform data in a way that destroys any hidden messages, a process called Content Threat Removal.

==Applications==
===Use in modern printers===

Some modern computer printers use steganography, including Hewlett-Packard and Xerox brand color laser printers. The printers add tiny yellow dots to each page. The barely-visible dots contain encoded printer serial numbers and date and time stamps.

===Example from modern practice===
The larger the cover message (in binary data, the number of bits) relative to the hidden message, the easier it is to hide the hidden message (as an analogy, the larger the &quot;haystack&quot;, the easier it is to hide a &quot;needle&quot;). So digital pictures, which contain much data, are sometimes used to hide messages on the Internet and on other digital communication media. It is not clear how common this practice actually is.

For example, a 24-bit bitmap uses 8 bits to represent each of the three color values (red, green, and blue) of each pixel. The blue alone has 28 different levels of blue intensity. The difference between 111111112 and 111111102 in the value for blue intensity is likely to be undetectable by the human eye. Therefore, the least significant bit can be used more or less undetectably for something else other than color information. If that is repeated for the green and the red elements of each pixel as well, it is possible to encode one letter of ASCII text for every three pixels.

Stated somewhat more formally, the objective for making steganographic encoding difficult to detect is to ensure that the changes to the carrier (the original signal) because of the injection of the payload (the signal to covertly embed) are visually (and ideally, statistically) negligible. The changes are indistinguishable from the noise floor of the carrier. All media can be a carrier, but media with a large amount of redundant or compressible information is better suited.

From an information theoretical point of view, that means that the channel must have more capacity than the &quot;surface&quot; signal requires. There must be redundancy. For a digital image, it may be noise from the imaging element; for digital audio, it may be noise from recording techniques or amplification equipment. In general, electronics that digitize an analog signal suffer from several noise sources, such as thermal noise, flicker noise, and shot noise. The noise provides enough variation in the captured digital information that it can be exploited as a noise cover for hidden data. In addition, lossy compression schemes (such as JPEG) always introduce some error to the decompressed data, and it is possible to exploit that for steganographic use, as well.

Although steganography and digital watermarking seem similar, they are not. In steganography, the hidden message should remain intact until it reaches its destination. Steganography can be used for digital watermarking in which a message (being simply an identifier) is hidden in an image so that its source can be tracked or verified (for example, Coded Anti-Piracy) or even just to identify an image (as in the EURion constellation). In such a case, the technique of hiding the message (here, the watermark) must be robust to prevent tampering. However, digital watermarking sometimes requires a brittle watermark, which can be modified easily, to check whether the image has been tampered with. That is the key difference between steganography and digital watermarking.

===Alleged use by intelligence services===
In 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation alleged that the Russian foreign intelligence service uses customized steganography software for embedding encrypted text messages inside image files for certain communications with &quot;illegal agents&quot; (agents without diplomatic cover) stationed abroad.

On 23 April 2019 the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment charging Xiaoqing Zheng, a Chinese businessman and former Principal Engineer at General Electric, with 14 counts of conspiring to steal intellectual property and trade secrets from General Electric. Zheng had allegedly used steganography to exfiltrate 20,000 documents from General Electric to Tianyi Aviation Technology Co. in Nanjing, China, a company the FBI accused him of starting with backing from the Chinese government.

===Distributed steganography===
There are distributed steganography methods, including methodologies that distribute the payload through multiple carrier files in diverse locations to make detection more difficult. For example, by cryptographer William Easttom (Chuck Easttom).

===Online challenge===
The puzzles that are presented by Cicada 3301 incorporate steganography with cryptography and other solving techniques since 2012. Puzzles involving steganography have also been featured in other alternate reality games.

The communications of The May Day mystery incorporate steganography and other solving techniques since 1981.

=== Computer malware ===

It is possible to steganographically hide computer malware into digital images, videos, audio and various other files in order to evade detection by antivirus software. This type of malware is called stegomalware. It can be activated by external code, which can be malicious or even non-malicious if some vulnerability in the software reading the file is exploited.

Stegomalware can be removed from certain files without knowing whether they contain stegomalware or not. This is done through content disarm and reconstruction (CDR) software, and it involves reprocessing the entire file or removing parts from it. Actually detecting stegomalware in a file can be difficult and may involve testing the file behaviour in virtual environments or deep learning analysis of the file.

== Steganalysis ==
=== Stegoanalytical algorithms ===
Stegoanalytical algorithms can be cataloged in different ways, highlighting: according to the available information and according to the purpose sought.

==== According to the information available ====
There is the possibility of cataloging these algorithms based on the information held by the stegoanalyst in terms of clear and encrypted messages. It is a technique similar to cryptography, however, they have several differences:

* Chosen stego attack: the stegoanalyst perceives the final target stego and the steganographic algorithm used.
* Known cover attack: the stegoanalyst comprises the initial conductive target and the final target stego.
* Known stego attack: the stegoanalyst knows the initial carrier target and the final target stego, in addition to the algorithm used.
* Stego only attack: the stegoanalyst perceives exclusively the stego target.
* Chosen message attack: the stegoanalyst, following a message selected by him, originates a stego target.
* Known message attack: the stegoanalyst owns the stego target and the hidden message, which is known to them.

==== According to the purpose sought ====
The principal purpose of steganography is to transfer information unnoticed, however, it is possible for an attacker to have two different pretensions:

* Passive steganalysis: does not alter the target stego, therefore, it examines the target stego in order to establish whether it carries hidden information and recovers the hidden message, the key used or both.
* Active steganalysis: changes the initial stego target, therefore, it seeks to suppress the transfer of information, if it exists.

<doc id="28736" wikidata="Q2111" url="?curid=28736" title="Speed of light">
<text>The speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted , is a universal physical constant that is exactly equal to ). It is exact because, by a 1983 international agreement, a metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of second. According to the special theory of relativity, is the upper limit for the speed at which conventional matter or energy (and thus any signal carrying information) can travel through space.

All forms of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, travel at the speed of light. For many practical purposes, light and other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. Much starlight viewed on Earth is from the distant past, allowing humans to study the history of the universe by viewing distant objects. When communicating with distant space probes, it can take minutes to hours for signals to travel. In computing, the speed of light fixes the ultimate minimum communication delay. The speed of light can be used in time of flight measurements to measure large distances to extremely high precision.

Ole Rømer first demonstrated in 1676 that light does not travel instantaneously by studying the apparent motion of Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io. Progressively more accurate measurements of its speed came over the following centuries. In a paper published in 1865, James Clerk Maxwell proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave and, therefore, travelled at speed . In 1905, Albert Einstein postulated that the speed of light with respect to any inertial frame of reference is a constant and is independent of the motion of the light source. He explored the consequences of that postulate by deriving the theory of relativity and, in doing so, showed that the parameter had relevance outside of the context of light and electromagnetism.

Massless particles and field perturbations, such as gravitational waves, also travel at speed in vacuum. Such particles and waves travel at regardless of the motion of the source or the inertial reference frame of the observer. Particles with nonzero rest mass can be accelerated to approach but can never reach it, regardless of the frame of reference in which their speed is measured. In the theory of relativity, interrelates space and time and appears in the famous mass–energy equivalence, .

In some cases, objects or waves may appear to travel faster than light (e.g., phase velocities of waves, the appearance of certain high-speed astronomical objects, and particular quantum effects). The expansion of the universe is understood to exceed the speed of light beyond a certain boundary.

The speed at which light propagates through transparent materials, such as glass or air, is less than ; similarly, the speed of electromagnetic waves in wire cables is slower than . The ratio between and the speed at which light travels in a material is called the refractive index of the material (). For example, for visible light, the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5, meaning that light in glass travels at ; the refractive index of air for visible light is about 1.0003, so the speed of light in air is about slower than .

== Numerical value, notation, and units ==
The speed of light in vacuum is usually denoted by a lowercase . The origin of the letter choice is unclear, with guesses including &quot;c&quot; for &quot;constant&quot; or the Latin (meaning &#x27;swiftness, celerity&#x27;). The &quot;c&quot; was used for &quot;celerity&quot; meaning a velocity in books by Leonhard Euler and others, but this velocity was not specifically for light; Isaac Asimov wrote a popular science article. &quot;C for Celeritas&quot;, but did not explain the origin. In 1856, Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch had used for a different constant that was later shown to equal times the speed of light in vacuum. Historically, the symbol &quot;V&quot; was used as an alternative symbol for the speed of light, introduced by James Clerk Maxwell in 1865. In 1903, Max Abraham used with its modern meaning in a widely read textbook on electromagnetism. Einstein used &quot;V&quot; in his original German-language papers on special relativity in 1905, but in 1907 he switched to , which by then had become the standard symbol for the speed of light.

Sometimes is used for the speed of waves in any material medium, and 0 for the speed of light in vacuum. This subscripted notation, which is endorsed in official SI literature, has the same form as related electromagnetic constants: namely, &quot;μ&quot;0 for the vacuum permeability or magnetic constant, &quot;ε&quot;0 for the vacuum permittivity or electric constant, and &quot;Z&quot;0 for the impedance of free space. This article uses exclusively for the speed of light in vacuum.

=== Use in unit systems ===

Since 1983, the constant has been defined in the International System of Units (SI) as &quot;exactly&quot; ; this relationship is used to define the metre as exactly the distance that light travels in vacuum in of a second. The second is, in turn, defined to be the length of time occupied by of the radiation emitted by a caesium-133 atom in a transition between two specified energy states. By using the value of , as well as an accurate measurement of the second, one can establish a standard for the metre. 

The particular value chosen for the speed of light provided a more accurate definition of the metre that still agreed as much as possible with the definition used before 1983.

As a dimensional physical constant, the numerical value of is different for different unit systems. For example, in imperial units, the speed of light is approximately miles per second, or roughly 1 foot per nanosecond.

In branches of physics in which appears often, such as in relativity, it is common to use systems of natural units of measurement or the geometrized unit system where . Using these units, does not appear explicitly because multiplication or division by1 does not affect the result. Its unit of light-second per second is still relevant, even if omitted.

== Fundamental role in physics ==
The speed at which light waves propagate in vacuum is independent both of the motion of the wave source and of the inertial frame of reference of the observer. This invariance of the speed of light was postulated by Einstein in 1905, after being motivated by Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electromagnetism and the lack of evidence for motion against the luminiferous aether. It has since been consistently confirmed by many experiments. It is only possible to verify experimentally that the two-way speed of light (for example, from a source to a mirror and back again) is frame-independent, because it is impossible to measure the one-way speed of light (for example, from a source to a distant detector) without some convention as to how clocks at the source and at the detector should be synchronized.

By adopting Einstein synchronization for the clocks, the one-way speed of light becomes equal to the two-way speed of light by definition. The special theory of relativity explores the consequences of this invariance of &quot;c&quot; with the assumption that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference. One consequence is that &quot;c&quot; is the speed at which all massless particles and waves, including light, must travel in vacuum.

Special relativity has many counterintuitive and experimentally verified implications. These include the equivalence of mass and energy , length contraction (moving objects shorten), and time dilation (moving clocks run more slowly). The factor &quot;γ&quot; by which lengths contract and times dilate is known as the Lorentz factor and is given by , where &quot;v&quot; is the speed of the object. The difference of &quot;γ&quot; from1 is negligible for speeds much slower than &quot;c&quot;, such as most everyday speedsin which case special relativity is closely approximated by Galilean relativitybut it increases at relativistic speeds and diverges to infinity as &quot;v&quot; approaches &quot;c&quot;. For example, a time dilation factor of &quot;γ&quot; = 2 occurs at a relative velocity of 86.6% of the speed of light (&quot;v&quot; = 0.866 &quot;c&quot;). Similarly, a time dilation factor of &quot;γ&quot; = 10 occurs at 99.5% the speed of light (&quot;v&quot; = 0.995 &quot;c&quot;).

The results of special relativity can be summarized by treating space and time as a unified structure known as spacetime (with &quot;c&quot; relating the units of space and time), and requiring that physical theories satisfy a special symmetry called Lorentz invariance, whose mathematical formulation contains the parameter &quot;c&quot;. Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for modern physical theories, such as quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics, the Standard Model of particle physics, and general relativity. As such, the parameter &quot;c&quot; is ubiquitous in modern physics, appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example, general relativity predicts that &quot;c&quot; is also the speed of gravity and of gravitational waves, and observations of gravitational waves have been consistent with this prediction. In non-inertial frames of reference (gravitationally curved spacetime or accelerated reference frames), the &quot;local&quot; speed of light is constant and equal to &quot;c&quot;, but the speed of light can differ from &quot;c&quot; when measured from a remote frame of reference, depending on how measurements are extrapolated to the region.

It is generally assumed that fundamental constants such as &quot;c&quot; have the same value throughout spacetime, meaning that they do not depend on location and do not vary with time. However, it has been suggested in various theories that the speed of light may have changed over time. No conclusive evidence for such changes has been found, but they remain the subject of ongoing research.

It is generally assumed that the two-way speed of light is isotropic, meaning that it has the same value regardless of the direction in which it is measured. Observations of the emissions from nuclear energy levels as a function of the orientation of the emitting nuclei in a magnetic field (see Hughes–Drever experiment), and of rotating optical resonators (see Resonator experiments) have put stringent limits on the possible two-way anisotropy.

=== Upper limit on speeds ===
According to special relativity, the energy of an object with rest mass &quot;m&quot; and speed &quot;v&quot; is given by , where &quot;γ&quot; is the Lorentz factor defined above. When &quot;v&quot; is zero, &quot;γ&quot; is equal to one, giving rise to the famous formula for mass–energy equivalence. The &quot;γ&quot; factor approaches infinity as &quot;v&quot; approaches &quot;c&quot;, and it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object with mass to the speed of light. The speed of light is the upper limit for the speeds of objects with positive rest mass, and individual photons cannot travel faster than the speed of light. This is experimentally established in many tests of relativistic energy and momentum.
More generally, it is impossible for signals or energy to travel faster than &quot;c&quot;. One argument for this follows from the counter-intuitive implication of special relativity known as the relativity of simultaneity. If the spatial distance between two events A and B is greater than the time interval between them multiplied by &quot;c&quot; then there are frames of reference in which A precedes B, others in which B precedes A, and others in which they are simultaneous. As a result, if something were travelling faster than &quot;c&quot; relative to an inertial frame of reference, it would be travelling backwards in time relative to another frame, and causality would be violated. In such a frame of reference, an &quot;effect&quot; could be observed before its &quot;cause&quot;. Such a violation of causality has never been recorded, and would lead to paradoxes such as the tachyonic antitelephone.

== Faster-than-light observations and experiments ==
There are situations in which it may seem that matter, energy, or information-carrying signal travels at speeds greater than &quot;c&quot;, but they do not. For example, as is discussed in the propagation of light in a medium section below, many wave velocities can exceed &quot;c&quot;. The phase velocity of X-rays through most glasses can routinely exceed &quot;c&quot;, but phase velocity does not determine the velocity at which waves convey information.

If a laser beam is swept quickly across a distant object, the spot of light can move faster than &quot;c&quot;, although the initial movement of the spot is delayed because of the time it takes light to get to the distant object at the speed &quot;c&quot;. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speed &quot;c&quot; from the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster than &quot;c&quot;, after a delay in time. In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.

The rate of change in the distance between two objects in a frame of reference with respect to which both are moving (their closing speed) may have a value in excess of &quot;c&quot;. However, this does not represent the speed of any single object as measured in a single inertial frame.

Certain quantum effects appear to be transmitted instantaneously and therefore faster than &quot;c&quot;, as in the EPR paradox. An example involves the quantum states of two particles that can be entangled. Until either of the particles is observed, they exist in a superposition of two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle&#x27;s quantum state is observed, the other particle&#x27;s quantum state is determined instantaneously. However, it is impossible to control which quantum state the first particle will take on when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.

Another quantum effect that predicts the occurrence of faster-than-light speeds is called the Hartman effect: under certain conditions the time needed for a virtual particle to tunnel through a barrier is constant, regardless of the thickness of the barrier. This could result in a virtual particle crossing a large gap faster than light. However, no information can be sent using this effect.

So-called superluminal motion is seen in certain astronomical objects, such as the relativistic jets of radio galaxies and quasars. However, these jets are not moving at speeds in excess of the speed of light: the apparent superluminal motion is a projection effect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took longer to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays were emitted.

A 2011 experiment where neutrinos were observed to travel faster than light turned out to be due to experimental error.

In models of the expanding universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. For example, galaxies far away from Earth are inferred to be moving away from the Earth with speeds proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the Hubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light.
These recession rates, defined as the increase in proper distance per cosmological time, are not velocities in a relativistic sense. Faster-than-light cosmological recession speeds are only a coordinate artifact.

== Propagation of light ==
In classical physics, light is described as a type of electromagnetic wave. The classical behaviour of the electromagnetic field is described by Maxwell&#x27;s equations, which predict that the speed &quot;c&quot; with which electromagnetic waves (such as light) propagate in vacuum is related to the distributed capacitance and inductance of vacuum, otherwise respectively known as the electric constant &quot;ε&quot;0 and the magnetic constant &quot;μ&quot;0, by the equation
: formula_1

In modern quantum physics, the electromagnetic field is described by the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED). In this theory, light is described by the fundamental excitations (or quanta) of the electromagnetic field, called photons. In QED, photons are massless particles and thus, according to special relativity, they travel at the speed of light in vacuum.

Extensions of QED in which the photon has a mass have been considered. In such a theory, its speed would depend on its frequency, and the invariant speed &quot;c&quot; of special relativity would then be the upper limit of the speed of light in vacuum. No variation of the speed of light with frequency has been observed in rigorous testing, putting stringent limits on the mass of the photon. The limit obtained depends on the model used: if the massive photon is described by Proca theory, the experimental upper bound for its mass is about 10−57 grams; if photon mass is generated by a Higgs mechanism, the experimental upper limit is less sharp,   (roughly 2 × 10−47 g).

Another reason for the speed of light to vary with its frequency would be the failure of special relativity to apply to arbitrarily small scales, as predicted by some proposed theories of quantum gravity. In 2009, the observation of gamma-ray burst GRB 090510 found no evidence for a dependence of photon speed on energy, supporting tight constraints in specific models of spacetime quantization on how this speed is affected by photon energy for energies approaching the Planck scale.

=== In a medium ===

In a medium, light usually does not propagate at a speed equal to &quot;c&quot;; further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a plane wave (a wave filling the whole space, with only one frequency) propagate is called the phase velocity &quot;v&quot;p. A physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The overall envelope of the pulse travels at the group velocity &quot;v&quot;g, and its earliest part travels at the front velocity &quot;v&quot;f.
The phase velocity is important in determining how a light wave travels through a material or from one material to another. It is often represented in terms of a &quot;refractive index&quot;. The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio of &quot;c&quot; to the phase velocity &quot;v&quot;p in the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light&#x27;s frequency, intensity, polarization, or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant. The refractive index of air is approximately 1.0003. Denser media, such as water, glass, and diamond, have refractive indexes of around 1.3, 1.5 and 2.4, respectively, for visible light.

In exotic materials like Bose–Einstein condensates near absolute zero, the effective speed of light may be only a few metres per second. However, this represents absorption and re-radiation delay between atoms, as do all slower-than-&quot;c&quot; speeds in material substances. As an extreme example of light &quot;slowing&quot; in matter, two independent teams of physicists claimed to bring light to a &quot;complete standstill&quot; by passing it through a Bose–Einstein condensate of the element rubidium. The popular description of light being &quot;stopped&quot; in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrarily later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had &quot;stopped&quot;, it had ceased to be light. This type of behaviour is generally microscopically true of all transparent media which &quot;slow&quot; the speed of light.

In transparent materials, the refractive index generally is greater than 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than &quot;c&quot;. In other materials, it is possible for the refractive index to become smaller than1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the wave will be absorbed quickly.

A pulse with different group and phase velocities (which occurs if the phase velocity is not the same for all the frequencies of the pulse) smears out over time, a process known as dispersion. Certain materials have an exceptionally low (or even zero) group velocity for light waves, a phenomenon called slow light.
The opposite, group velocities exceeding &quot;c&quot;, was proposed theoretically in 1993 and achieved experimentally in 2000. It should even be possible for the group velocity to become infinite or negative, with pulses travelling instantaneously or backwards in time.

None of these options allow information to be transmitted faster than &quot;c&quot;. It is impossible to transmit information with a light pulse any faster than the speed of the earliest part of the pulse (the front velocity). It can be shown that this is (under certain assumptions) always equal to &quot;c&quot;. 

It is possible for a particle to travel through a medium faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium (but still slower than &quot;c&quot;). When a charged particle does that in a dielectric material, the electromagnetic equivalent of a shock wave, known as Cherenkov radiation, is emitted.

== Practical effects of finiteness ==
The speed of light is of relevance to telecommunications: the one-way and round-trip delay time are greater than zero. This applies from small to astronomical scales. On the other hand, some techniques depend on the finite speed of light, for example in distance measurements.

=== Small scales ===
In computers, the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent between processors. If a processor operates at 1gigahertz, a signal can travel only a maximum of about in a single clock cycle – in practice, this distance is even shorter since the printed circuit board refracts and slows down signals. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other, as well as memory chips, to minimize communication latencies, and care must be exercised when routing wires between them to ensure signal integrity. If clock frequencies continue to increase, the speed of light may eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of single chips.

=== Large distances on Earth ===

Given that the equatorial circumference of the Earth is about and that &quot;c&quot; is about , the theoretical shortest time for a piece of information to travel half the globe along the surface is about 67 milliseconds. When light is traveling in optical fibre (a transparent material) the actual transit time is longer, in part because the speed of light is slower by about 35% in optical fibre, depending on its refractive index &quot;n&quot;. Straight lines are rare in global communications and the travel time increases when signals pass through electronic switches or signal regenerators.

Although this distance is largely irrelevant for most applications, latency becomes important in fields such as high-frequency trading, where traders seek to gain minute advantages by delivering their trades to exchanges fractions of a second ahead of other traders. For example, traders have been switching to microwave communications between trading hubs, because of the advantage which radio waves travelling at near to the speed of light through air have over comparatively slower fibre optic signals.

=== Spaceflight and astronomy ===

Similarly, communications between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There is a brief delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for communications between ground control and Apollo 8 when it became the first crewed spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least three seconds for the answer to arrive.

The communications delay between Earth and Mars can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot on the surface of Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until approximately later. It would then take a further for commands to travel from Earth to Mars.

Receiving light and other signals from distant astronomical sources takes much longer. For example, it takes 13 billion (13) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field images. Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they appeared 13 billion years ago, when the universe was less than a billion years old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.

Astronomical distances are sometimes expressed in light-years, especially in popular science publications and media. A light-year is the distance light travels in one Julian year, around 9461 billion kilometres, 5879 billion miles, or 0.3066 parsecs. In round figures, a light year is nearly 10 trillion kilometres or nearly 6 trillion miles. Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 light-years away.

=== Distance measurement ===

Radar systems measure the distance to a target by the time it takes a radio-wave pulse to return to the radar antenna after being reflected by the target: the distance to the target is half the round-trip transit time multiplied by the speed of light. A Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver measures its distance to GPS satellites based on how long it takes for a radio signal to arrive from each satellite, and from these distances calculates the receiver&#x27;s position. Because light travels about () in one second, these measurements of small fractions of a second must be very precise. The Lunar Laser Ranging experiment, radar astronomy and the Deep Space Network determine distances to the Moon, planets and spacecraft, respectively, by measuring round-trip transit times.

== Measurement ==

There are different ways to determine the value of &quot;c&quot;. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which can be done in various astronomical and Earth-based setups. It is also possible to determine &quot;c&quot; from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants &quot;ε&quot;0 and &quot;μ&quot;0 and using their relation to &quot;c&quot;. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling &quot;c&quot;. This is described in more detail in the &quot;Interferometry&quot; section below.

In 1983 the metre was defined as &quot;the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of of a second&quot;, fixing the value of the speed of light at by definition, as described below. Consequently, accurate measurements of the speed of light yield an accurate realization of the metre rather than an accurate value of &quot;c&quot;.

=== Astronomical measurements ===

Outer space is a convenient setting for measuring the speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect vacuum. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the Solar System, such as the radius of the Earth&#x27;s orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units.

Ole Rømer used an astronomical measurement to make the first quantitative estimate of the speed of light in the year 1676. When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The difference is small, but the cumulative time becomes significant when measured over months. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the diameter of the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon&#x27;s orbital period is caused by the difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for Jupiter&#x27;s innermost major moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth&#x27;s orbit.
Another method is to use the aberration of light, discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century. This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth&#x27;s velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 arcseconds) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth&#x27;s velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8 minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.

==== Astronomical unit ====
An astronomical unit (AU) is approximately the average distance between the Earth and Sun. It was redefined in 2012 as exactly . Previously the AU was not based on the International System of Units but in terms of the gravitational force exerted by the Sun in the framework of classical mechanics. The current definition uses the recommended value in metres for the previous definition of the astronomical unit, which was determined by measurement. This redefinition is analogous to that of the metre and likewise has the effect of fixing the speed of light to an exact value in astronomical units per second (via the exact speed of light in metres per second).

Previously, the inverse of  expressed in seconds per astronomical unit was measured by comparing the time for radio signals to reach different spacecraft in the Solar System, with their position calculated from the gravitational effects of the Sun and various planets. By combining many such measurements, a best fit value for the light time per unit distance could be obtained. For example, in 2009, the best estimate, as approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), was:
: light time for unit distance: &quot;t&quot;au = ,
: &quot;c&quot; =  = .
The relative uncertainty in these measurements is 0.02 parts per billion (), equivalent to the uncertainty in Earth-based measurements of length by interferometry. Since the metre is defined to be the length travelled by light in a certain time interval, the measurement of the light time in terms of the previous definition of the astronomical unit can also be interpreted as measuring the length of an AU (old definition) in metres.

=== Time of flight techniques ===

A method of measuring the speed of light is to measure the time needed for light to travel to a mirror at a known distance and back. This is the working principle behind experiments by Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault.

The setup as used by Fizeau consists of a beam of light directed at a mirror away. On the way from the source to the mirror, the beam passes through a rotating cogwheel. At a certain rate of rotation, the beam passes through one gap on the way out and another on the way back, but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the speed of light can be calculated.

The method of Foucault replaces the cogwheel with a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels to the distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it is on its way back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated. Foucault used this apparatus to measure the speed of light in air versus water, based on a suggestion by François Arago.

Today, using oscilloscopes with time resolutions of less than one nanosecond, the speed of light can be directly measured by timing the delay of a light pulse from a laser or an LED reflected from a mirror. This method is less precise (with errors of the order of 1%) than other modern techniques, but it is sometimes used as a laboratory experiment in college physics classes.

=== Electromagnetic constants ===
An option for deriving &quot;c&quot; that does not directly depend on a measurement of the propagation of electromagnetic waves is to use the relation between &quot;c&quot; and the vacuum permittivity &quot;ε&quot;0 and vacuum permeability &quot;μ&quot;0 established by Maxwell&#x27;s theory: &quot;c&quot;2 = 1/(&quot;ε&quot;0&quot;μ&quot;0). The vacuum permittivity may be determined by measuring the capacitance and dimensions of a capacitor, whereas the value of the vacuum permeability was historically fixed at exactly through the definition of the ampere. Rosa and Dorsey used this method in 1907 to find a value of . Their method depended upon having a standard unit of electrical resistance, the &quot;international ohm&quot;, and so its accuracy was limited by how this standard was defined.

=== Cavity resonance ===
Another way to measure the speed of light is to independently measure the frequency &quot;f&quot; and wavelength &quot;λ&quot; of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of &quot;c&quot; can then be found by using the relation &quot;c&quot; = &quot;fλ&quot;. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8 μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.

The Essen–Gordon-Smith result, , was substantially more precise than those found by optical techniques. By 1950, repeated measurements by Essen established a result of .

A household demonstration of this technique is possible, using a microwave oven and food such as marshmallows or margarine: if the turntable is removed so that the food does not move, it will cook the fastest at the antinodes (the points at which the wave amplitude is the greatest), where it will begin to melt. The distance between two such spots is half the wavelength of the microwaves; by measuring this distance and multiplying the wavelength by the microwave frequency (usually displayed on the back of the oven, typically 2450 MHz), the value of &quot;c&quot; can be calculated, &quot;often with less than 5% error&quot;.

=== Interferometry ===

Interferometry is another method to find the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light. A coherent beam of light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (&quot;f&quot;), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (&quot;λ&quot;) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equation &quot;c&quot; = &quot;λf&quot;.

Before the advent of laser technology, coherent radio sources were used for interferometry measurements of the speed of light. Interferometric determination of wavelength becomes less precise with wavelength and the experiments were thus limited in precision by the long wavelength (~) of the radiowaves. The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light.

One way around this problem is to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal. A laser can then be locked to the frequency, and its wavelength can be determined using interferometry. This technique was due to a group at the National Bureau of Standards (which later became the National Institute of Standards and Technology). They used it in 1972 to measure the speed of light in vacuum with a fractional uncertainty of .

== History ==
Until the early modern period, it was not known whether light travelled instantaneously or at a very fast finite speed. The first extant recorded examination of this subject was in ancient Greece. The ancient Greeks, Arabic scholars, and classical European scientists long debated this until Rømer provided the first calculation of the speed of light. Einstein&#x27;s theory of special relativity postulates that the speed of light is constant regardless of one&#x27;s frame of reference. Since then, scientists have provided increasingly accurate measurements.

=== Early history ===
Empedocles (c. 490–430 BCE) was the first to propose a theory of light and claimed that light has a finite speed. He maintained that light was something in motion, and therefore must take some time to travel. Aristotle argued, to the contrary, that &quot;light is due to the presence of something, but it is not a movement&quot;. Euclid and Ptolemy advanced Empedocles&#x27; emission theory of vision, where light is emitted from the eye, thus enabling sight. Based on that theory, Heron of Alexandria argued that the speed of light must be infinite because distant objects such as stars appear immediately upon opening the eyes.

Early Islamic philosophers initially agreed with the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the &quot;Book of Optics&quot;, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed, and that the speed of light is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from the senses. Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound.

In the 13th century, Roger Bacon argued that the speed of light in air was not infinite, using philosophical arguments backed by the writing of Alhazen and Aristotle. In the 1270s, Witelo considered the possibility of light travelling at infinite speed in vacuum, but slowing down in denser bodies.

In the early 17th century, Johannes Kepler believed that the speed of light was infinite since empty space presents no obstacle to it. René Descartes argued that if the speed of light were to be finite, the Sun, Earth, and Moon would be noticeably out of alignment during a lunar eclipse. Although this argument fails when aberration of light is taken into account, the latter was not recognized until the following century. Since such misalignment had not been observed, Descartes concluded the speed of light was infinite. Descartes speculated that if the speed of light were found to be finite, his whole system of philosophy might be demolished. Despite this, in his derivation of Snell&#x27;s law, Descartes assumed that some kind of motion associated with light was faster in denser media. Pierre de Fermat derived Snell&#x27;s law using the opposing assumption, the denser the medium the slower light travelled. Fermat also argued in support of a finite speed of light.

=== First measurement attempts ===

In 1629, Isaac Beeckman proposed an experiment in which a person observes the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6 km) away. In 1638, Galileo Galilei proposed an experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it were not, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid. In 1667, the Accademia del Cimento of Florence reported that it had performed Galileo&#x27;s experiment, with the lanterns separated by about one mile, but no delay was observed. The actual delay in this experiment would have been about 11 microseconds.
The first quantitative estimate of the speed of light was made in 1676 by Ole Rømer. From the observation that the periods of Jupiter&#x27;s innermost moon Io appeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth&#x27;s orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for the diameter of the Earth&#x27;s orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of , which is 27% lower than the actual value.

In his 1704 book &quot;Opticks&quot;, Isaac Newton reported Rømer&#x27;s calculations of the finite speed of light and gave a value of &quot;seven or eight minutes&quot; for the time taken for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth (the modern value is 8 minutes 19 seconds). Newton queried whether Rømer&#x27;s eclipse shadows were coloured. Hearing that they were not, he concluded the different colours travelled at the same speed. In 1729, James Bradley discovered stellar aberration. From this effect he determined that light must travel 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8 minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.

=== Connections with electromagnetism ===

In the 19th century Hippolyte Fizeau developed a method to determine the speed of light based on time-of-flight measurements on Earth and reported a value of . His method was improved upon by Léon Foucault who obtained a value of in 1862. In the year 1856, Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch measured the ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units of charge, 1/, by discharging a Leyden jar, and found that its numerical value was very close to the speed of light as measured directly by Fizeau. The following year Gustav Kirchhoff calculated that an electric signal in a resistanceless wire travels along the wire at this speed.

In the early 1860s, Maxwell showed that, according to the theory of electromagnetism he was working on, electromagnetic waves propagate in empty space at a speed equal to the above Weber/Kohlrausch ratio, and drawing attention to the numerical proximity of this value to the speed of light as measured by Fizeau, he proposed that light is in fact an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell backed up his claim with his own experiment published in the 1868 Philosophical Transactions which determined the ratio of the electrostatic and electromagnetic units of electricity.

=== &quot;Luminiferous aether&quot; ===

The wave properties of light were well known since Thomas Young. In the 19th century, physicists believed light was propagating in a medium called aether (or ether). But for electric force, it looks more like the gravitational force in Newton&#x27;s law. A transmitting medium was not required. After Maxwell theory unified light and electric and magnetic waves, it was favored that both light and electric magnetic waves propagate in the same aether medium (or called the luminiferous aether).

It was thought at the time that empty space was filled with a background medium called the luminiferous aether in which the electromagnetic field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as a preferred frame of reference for the propagation of light and therefore it should be possible to measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium, by measuring the isotropy of the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is the experiment performed by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887. The detected motion was found to always be nil (within observational error). Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of light is isotropic (the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per second.

Because of this experiment Hendrik Lorentz proposed that the motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to contract along its length in the direction of motion, and he further assumed that the time variable for moving systems must also be changed accordingly (&quot;local time&quot;), which led to the formulation of the Lorentz transformation. Based on Lorentz&#x27;s aether theory, Henri Poincaré (1900) showed that this local time (to first order in &quot;v&quot;/&quot;c&quot;) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz&#x27;s theory are all confirmed. In 1905, Poincaré brought Lorentz&#x27;s aether theory into full observational agreement with the principle of relativity.

=== Special relativity ===
In 1905 Einstein postulated from the outset that the speed of light in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the special theory of relativity, in which the speed of light in vacuum &quot;c&quot; featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.

=== Increased accuracy of &quot;c&quot; and redefinition of the metre and second ===
In the second half of the 20th century, much progress was made in increasing the accuracy of measurements of the speed of light, first by cavity resonance techniques and later by laser interferometer techniques. These were aided by new, more precise, definitions of the metre and second. In 1950, Louis Essen determined the speed as , using cavity resonance. This value was adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of a particular spectral line of krypton-86, and, in 1967, the second was redefined in terms of the hyperfine transition frequency of the ground state of caesium-133.

In 1972, using the laser interferometer method and the new definitions, a group at the US National Bureau of Standards in Boulder, Colorado determined the speed of light in vacuum to be &quot;c&quot; = . This was 100 times less uncertain than the previously accepted value. The remaining uncertainty was mainly related to the definition of the metre. As similar experiments found comparable results for &quot;c&quot;, the 15th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1975 recommended using the value for the speed of light.

=== Defined as an explicit constant ===
In 1983 the 17th meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) found that wavelengths from frequency measurements and a given value for the speed of light are more reproducible than the previous standard. They kept the 1967 definition of second, so the caesium hyperfine frequency would now determine both the second and the metre. To do this, they redefined the metre as &quot;the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/ of a second&quot;.

As a result of this definition, the value of the speed of light in vacuum is exactly and has become a defined constant in the SI system of units. Improved experimental techniques that, prior to 1983, would have measured the speed of light no longer affect the known value of the speed of light in SI units, but instead allow a more precise realization of the metre by more accurately measuring the wavelength of krypton-86 and other light sources.

In 2011, the CGPM stated its intention to redefine all seven SI base units using what it calls &quot;the explicit-constant formulation&quot;, where each &quot;unit is defined indirectly by specifying explicitly an exact value for a well-recognized fundamental constant&quot;, as was done for the speed of light. It proposed a new, but completely equivalent, wording of the metre&#x27;s definition: &quot;The metre, symbol m, is the unit of length; its magnitude is set by fixing the numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum to be equal to exactly when it is expressed in the SI unit .&quot; This was one of the changes that was incorporated in the 2019 revision of the SI, also termed the &quot;New SI&quot;.

<doc id="28738" wikidata="Q1058791" url="?curid=28738" title="Synchronization">
<text>Synchronization is the coordination of events to operate a system in unison. For example, the conductor of an orchestra keeps the orchestra synchronized or &quot;in time&quot;. Systems that operate with all parts in synchrony are said to be synchronous or &quot;in sync&quot;—and those that are not are &quot;asynchronous&quot;.

Today, time synchronization can occur between systems around the world through satellite navigation signals and other time and frequency transfer techniques.

== Navigation and railways ==
Time-keeping and synchronization of clocks is a critical problem in long-distance ocean navigation. Before radio navigation and satellite-based navigation, navigators required accurate time in conjunction with astronomical observations to determine how far east or west their vessel traveled. The invention of an accurate marine chronometer revolutionized marine navigation. By the end of the 19th century, important ports provided time signals in the form of a signal gun, flag, or dropping time ball so that mariners could check and correct their chronometers for error.

Synchronization was important in the operation of 19th-century railways, these being the first major means of transport fast enough for differences in local mean time between nearby towns to be noticeable. Each line handled the problem by synchronizing all its stations to headquarters as a standard railway time. In some territories, companies shared a single railroad track and needed to avoid collisions. The need for strict timekeeping led the companies to settle on one standard, and civil authorities eventually abandoned local mean time in favor of railway time.

== Communication ==

In electrical engineering terms, for digital logic and data transfer, a synchronous circuit requires a clock signal. A clock signal simply signals the start or end of some time period, often measured in microseconds or nanoseconds, that has an arbitrary relationship to any other system of measurement of the passage of minutes, hours, and days.

In a different sense, electronic systems are sometimes synchronized to make events at points far apart appear simultaneous or near-simultaneous from a certain perspective. Timekeeping technologies such as the GPS satellites and Network Time Protocol (NTP) provide real-time access to a close approximation to the UTC timescale and are used for many terrestrial synchronization applications of this kind.

In computer science (especially parallel computing), synchronization is the coordination of simultaneous threads or processes to complete a task with correct runtime order and no unexpected race conditions; see synchronization (computer science) for details.

Synchronization is also an important concept in the following fields:
* Cryptography
* Lip sync
* Multimedia
* Rhythm
* Neuroscience
* Photography
* Physics (The idea of simultaneity has many difficulties, both in practice and theory.)
* Synthesizers
* Telecommunication
** Frame synchronization
** Synchronization (video)

== Dynamical systems ==

Synchronization of multiple interacting dynamical systems can occur when the systems are autonomous oscillators. Poincaré phase oscillators are model systems that can interact and partially synchronize within random or regular networks. In the case of global synchronization of phase oscillators, an abrupt transition from unsynchronized to full synchronization takes place when the coupling strength exceeds a critical threshold. This is known as the Kuramoto model phase transition. Synchronization is an emergent property that occurs in a broad range of dynamical systems, including neural signaling, the beating of the heart and the synchronization of fire-fly light waves. A unified approach that quantifies synchronization in chaotic systems can be derived from the statistical analysis of measured data.

== Applications ==

=== Neuroscience ===

In cognitive neuroscience, (stimulus-dependent) (phase-)synchronous oscillations of neuron populations serve to solve the general binding problem. According to the so-called Binding-By-Synchrony (BBS) Hypothesis a precise temporal correlation between the impulses of neurons (&quot;cross-correlation analysis&quot;) and thus a stimulus-dependent temporal synchronization of the coherent activity of subpopulations of neurons emerges. Moreover, this synchronization mechanism circumvents the &quot;superposition problem&quot; by more effectively identifying the signature of synchronous neuronal signals as belonging together for subsequent (sub-)cortical information processing areas.

=== Cognitive science ===

In cognitive science, integrative (phase) synchronization mechanisms in cognitive neuroarchitectures of modern connectionism that include coupled oscillators (e.g.&quot;Oscillatory Networks&quot;) are used to solve the binding problem of cognitive neuroscience in perceptual cognition (&quot;feature binding&quot;) and in language cognition (&quot;variable binding&quot;).
=== Biological networks ===

There is a concept that the synchronization of biochemical reactions determines biological homeostasis. According to this theory, all reactions occurring in a living cell are synchronized in terms of quantities and timescales to maintain biological network functional.

== Human movement ==
Synchronization of movement is defined as similar movements between two or more people who are temporally aligned. This is different from mimicry, which occurs after a short delay. Line dance and military step are examples.

Muscular bonding is the idea that moving in time evokes particular emotions. This sparked some of the first research into movement synchronization and its effects on human emotion. In groups, synchronization of movement has been shown to increase conformity, cooperation and trust.

In dyads, groups of two people, synchronization has been demonstrated to increase affiliation, self-esteem, compassion and altruistic behaviour and increase rapport. During arguments, synchrony between the arguing pair has been noted to decrease; however, it is not clear whether this is due to the change in emotion or other factors. There is evidence to show that movement synchronization requires other people to cause its beneficial effects, as the effect on affiliation does not occur when one of the dyad is synchronizing their movements to something outside the dyad. This is known as interpersonal synchrony.

There has been dispute regarding the true effect of synchrony in these studies. Research in this area detailing the positive effects of synchrony, have attributed this to synchrony alone; however, many of the experiments incorporate a shared intention to achieve synchrony. Indeed, the Reinforcement of Cooperation Model suggests that perception of synchrony leads to reinforcement that cooperation is occurring, which leads to the pro-social effects of synchrony. More research is required to separate the effect of intentionality from the beneficial effect of synchrony.

== Uses ==
Synchronization is important in digital telephony, video and digital audio where streams of sampled data are manipulated. Synchronization of image and sound was an important technical problem in sound film. More sophisticated film, video, and audio applications use time code to synchronize audio and video. In movie and television production it is necessary to synchronize video frames from multiple cameras. In addition to enabling basic editing, synchronization can also be used for 3D reconstruction

In electric power systems, alternator synchronization is required when multiple generators are connected to an electrical grid.

Arbiters are needed in digital electronic systems such as microprocessors to deal with asynchronous inputs. There are also electronic digital circuits called &quot;synchronizers&quot; that attempt to perform arbitration in one clock cycle. Synchronizers, unlike arbiters, are prone to failure. (See metastability in electronics).

Encryption systems usually require some synchronization mechanism to ensure that the receiving cipher is decoding the right bits at the right time.

Automotive transmissions contain synchronizers that bring the toothed rotating parts (gears and splined shaft) to the same rotational velocity before engaging the teeth.

Flash synchronization synchronizes the flash with the shutter.

Some systems may be only approximately synchronized, or plesiochronous. Some applications require that relative offsets between events be determined. For others, only the order of the event is important.

<doc id="28739" wikidata="Q919191" url="?curid=28739" title="Sherwood Forest">
<text>Sherwood Forest is the remnants of an ancient royal forest in Nottinghamshire, England, having a historic association with the legend of Robin Hood.

The area has been wooded since the end of the Last Glacial Period (as attested by pollen sampling cores). Today, Sherwood Forest National Nature Reserve encompasses , surrounding the village of Edwinstowe and the site of Thoresby Hall. Its name is derived from its status as the &quot;shire (or sher) wood&quot; of Nottinghamshire, which extended into several neighbouring counties (shires), bordered to the west by the River Erewash and the Forest of East Derbyshire.

When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, the forest covered perhaps a quarter of Nottinghamshire (approximately 19,000 acres or 7,800 hectares) in woodland and heath subject to the forest laws. The forest gives its name to the Parliamentary constituency of Sherwood Forest (formerly Sherwood before the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies).

Mansfield anciently became the pre-eminent in importance among the towns of the Forest.

==History==
In 1066, in the invasion of England, King William the Conqueror made Sherwood Forest a Royal Hunting Forest. Sherwood Forest was frequently visited by the Mercian Kings.

The forest became popular with John, King of England and King Edward I of England. The remains of a hunting lodge can be found at Kings Clipstone named King John&#x27;s Palace.

After the dissolution of the monasteries by King Henry VIII of England in 1536, the land of Sherwood was sold and granted into private ownership which was converted into house estates. King James VI and I in the 1600s visited the forest, as did King Charles I of England. King Charles II of England brought back under control the management of Sherwood Forest.

In the 1700s large areas of Sherwood crown land were sold to private owners who built the estates of Thoresby Hall, Rufford Abbey, the former Clumber House Clumber Park, Welbeck Abbey and Worksop Manor. These estates became known as the Dukeries. Newstead Abbey was also built whilst in private ownership.

== Geology ==
Sherwood Forest is established over an area underlain by the Permian and Triassic age New Red Sandstone. The larger part of the Forest is found across the outcrop of pebbly sandstones known as the Chester Formation. The regional dip is a gentle one to the east, hence younger rocks are found in that direction and older ones exposed to the west. The local stratigraphy is (uppermost/youngest at top):

*Mercia Mudstone Group
**Tarporley Siltstone Formation (siltstones, mudstones and sandstones)
***including Retford Member (mudstones)
*Sherwood Sandstone Group
**Chester Formation (pebbly sandstones)
**Lenton Sandstone Formation
**Edlington Formation (mudstones and sandstones)

The sandstone is an aquifer providing a local water supply. Quaternary deposits include river sands and gravels, river terrace deposits and some scattered mid-Pleistocene glacial till. There are 41 local geodiversity sites within the Sherwood NCA; these are largely quarries and river sections.

==Management and conservation==
The Sherwood Forest Trust is a small charity that covers the ancient royal boundary and current national character area of Sherwood Forest. Its aims are based on conservation, heritage and communities but also include tourism and the economy.

Nottinghamshire County Council and Forestry England jointly manage the ancient remnant of forest north of the village of Edwinstowe, providing walks, footpaths and a host of other activities.

This central core of ancient Sherwood is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) called Birklands and Bilhaugh, NNR and Special Area of Conservation (SAC). It is a very important site for ancient oaks, wood pasture, invertebrates and fungi, as well as being linked to the legends of Robin Hood.

During the Second World War parts of Sherwood Forest were used extensively by the military for ammunition stores, POW camps and training areas. Oil was produced at Eakring. After the war large ammunition dumps were abandoned in the forest and were not cleared until 1952, with at least 46,000 tons of ammunition in them.

Part of the forest was opened to the public as a country park in 1969 by Nottinghamshire County Council, which manages a small part of the forest under lease from the Thoresby Estate. In 2002 a portion of Sherwood Forest was designated a national nature reserve by English Nature. In 2007 Natural England officially incorporated the Budby South Forest, Nottinghamshire&#x27;s largest area of dry lowland heath, into the Nature Reserve, nearly doubling its size from .

A new Sherwood Forest Visitor Centre was authorised in 2015. In August 2018 the RSPB opened the new development with a shop and café, having been granted permission to manage the woods in 2015. Part of an agreement with Natural England was that the land where the existing 1970s visitor centre was located would be restored to wood pasture.

Some portions of the forest retain many very old oaks, especially in the portion known as the Dukeries, south of the town of Worksop, which was so called because it used to contain five ducal residences.

The River Idle, a tributary of the Trent, is formed in Sherwood Forest from the confluence of several minor streams.

==Tourism==
Sherwood attracts around 350,000 tourists annually, many from other countries. Each August the nature reserve hosts a week-long Robin Hood Festival. This event recreates a medieval atmosphere and features the major characters from the Robin Hood legend. The week&#x27;s entertainment includes jousters and strolling players dressed in medieval attire, in addition to a medieval encampment complete with jesters, musicians, rat-catchers, alchemists and fire eaters.

The Sherwood Forest Art and Craft Centre is in the former coach house and stables of Edwinstowe Hall. The centre contains art studios and a cafe and hosts special events, including craft demonstrations and exhibitions.

Other local sites are Thoresby Hall Park and Rufford Abbey country park. Rufford Abbey is owned by English Heritage with the park managed by Parkwood Outdoors. Clumber Park is a former estate of Clumber House. The park is owned by the National Trust.
==Major Oak==

Sherwood Forest is home to the Major Oak, an oak tree between 800 and 1,000 years old, and since the Victorian era, its limbs have been partially supported by scaffolding. In February 1998 a local company took cuttings from the Major Oak and began cultivating clones of the famous tree with the intention of sending saplings to be planted in major cities around the world.

The Major Oak was featured on the 2005 BBC TV programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; as one of the natural wonders of the Midlands.

==Thynghowe==
Thynghowe, an important Danelaw meeting place where people came to resolve disputes and settle issues, was lost to history until its rediscovery in 2005–06 by local history enthusiasts amidst the old oaks of an area known as the Birklands. Experts believe it may also yield clues about the boundary of the ancient Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria.

English Heritage inspected the site, confirming that it was known as ‘Thynghowe’ in 1334 and 1609.
