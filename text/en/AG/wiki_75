<text>Urban areas usually experience the urban heat island (UHI) effect, that is, they are significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. The temperature difference is usually larger at night than during the day, and is most apparent when winds are weak, under block conditions, noticeably during the summer and winter.
The main cause of the UHI effect is from the modification of land surfaces, while waste heat generated by energy usage is a secondary contributor. Urban areas occupy about 0.5% of the Earth&#x27;s land surface but host more than half of the world&#x27;s population. As a population center grows, it tends to expand its area and increase its average temperature. The term heat island is also used; the term can be used to refer to any area that is relatively hotter than the surrounding, but generally refers to human-disturbed areas.

Monthly rainfall is greater downwind of cities, partially due to the UHI. Increases in heat within urban centers increases the length of growing seasons and decreases the occurrence of weak tornadoes. The UHI decreases air quality by increasing the production of pollutants such as ozone, and decreases water quality as warmer waters flow into area streams and put stress on their ecosystems.

Not all cities have a distinct urban heat island, and the heat island characteristics depend strongly on the background climate of the area in which the city is located. The impact in a city can change a lot based on its local environment. Heat can be reduced by tree cover and green space which act as sources of shade and promote evaporative cooling. Other options include green roofs, passive daytime radiative cooling applications, and the use of lighter-colored surfaces and less absorptive building materials. These reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat.

Climate change is not the cause of urban heat islands but it is causing more frequent and more intense heat waves which in turn amplify the urban heat island effect in cities (). Compact, dense urban development may increase the urban heat island effect, leading to higher temperatures and increased exposure.

== Definition ==
A definition of &quot;urban heat island&quot; is: &quot;The relative warmth of a city compared with surrounding rural areas.&quot; This relative warmth is caused by &quot;heat trapping due to land use, the configuration and design of the built environment, including street layout and building size, the heat-absorbing properties of urban building materials, reduced ventilation, reduced greenery and water features, and domestic and industrial heat emissions generated directly from human activities&quot;.

==Description ==

=== Diurnal variability ===

Throughout the daytime, particularly when the skies are cloudless, urban surfaces are warmed by the absorption of solar radiation. Surfaces in the urban areas tend to warm faster than those of the surrounding rural areas. By virtue of their high heat capacities, urban surfaces act as a reservoir of heat energy. For example, concrete can hold roughly 2,000 times as much heat as an equivalent volume of air. As a result, high daytime surface temperatures within the UHI can be easily seen via thermal remote sensing. As is often the case with daytime heating, this warming also has the effect of generating convective winds within the urban boundary layer. At night, the situation reverses. The absence of solar heating leads to the decrease of atmospheric convection and the stabilization of urban boundary layer. If enough stabilization occurs, an inversion layer is formed. This traps urban air near the surface, keeping surface air warm from the still-warm urban surfaces, resulting in warmer nighttime air temperatures within the UHI.

Generally speaking, the difference in temperature between the urban and surrounding rural area is more pronounced at night than in daytime. For example, in the United States, the temperature in urban areas tends to be warmer than the surrounding area by about during the daytime, and about warmer at night. However, the difference is more pronounced during the day in arid climates such as those in southeastern China and Taiwan. Studies have shown that diurnal variability is impacted by several factors including local climate and weather, seasonality, humidity, vegetation, surfaces, and materials in the built environment.

=== Seasonal variability ===
Seasonal variability is less well understood than diurnal variability of the urban heat island temperature difference. Complex relationships between precipitation, vegetation, solar radiation, and surface materials in various local climate zones play interlocking roles that influence seasonal patterns of temperature variation in a particular urban heat island.

== Measurements and predictions ==

=== Urban Heat Island Index (UHII) ===
One method to quantify the UHI effect within urban areas is the UHI Index created by the Californian EPA in 2015. It compares the temperature of a surveyed area and rural reference points upwind from the surveyed area, at a height of two meters above ground level. The difference in temperature in degrees Celsius is taken hourly and differences with an increased urban temperature compared to the reference points are summed up, creating an amount of degree-Celsius-hours, which is the UHI Index of the surveyed area. The measure of Celsius-hours might be averaged over many days, but is specified as Celsius-hours per averaged day.

The index was created to estimate the expected use of air conditioning and resulting greenhouse gas emissions in California. The index does not consider values of or differences in wind-speed, humidity, or solar influx, which might influence perceived temperature or the operation of air conditioners.

=== Models and simulations ===
If a city or town has a good system of taking weather observations the UHI can be measured directly. An alternative is to use a complex simulation of the location to calculate the UHI, or to use an approximate empirical method. Such models allow the UHI to be included in estimates of future temperatures rises within cities due to climate change.

Leonard O. Myrup published the first comprehensive numerical treatment to predict the effects of the urban heat island (UHI) in 1969. The heat island effect was found to be the net result of several competing physical processes. In general, reduced evaporation in the city center and the thermal properties of the city building and paving materials are the dominant parameters. Modern simulation environments include ENVI-met, which simulates all interactions between building and ground surfaces, plants and ambient air.

== Causes ==


=== Urban design ===

There are several causes of an urban heat island (UHI) related to common urban design aspects. For example, dark surfaces absorb significantly more solar radiation, which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and rural areas during the day; materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal bulk properties (including heat capacity and thermal conductivity) and surface radiative properties (albedo and emissivity) than the surrounding rural areas. This causes a change in the energy budget of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas.

Pavements, parking lots, roads or, more generally speaking transport infrastructure, contribute significantly to the urban heat island effect. For example, pavement infrastructure is a main contributor to urban heat during summer afternoons in Phoenix, United States.

Another major reason is the lack of evapotranspiration (for example, through lack of vegetation) in urban areas. The U.S. Forest Service found in 2018 that cities in the United States are losing 36 million trees each year. With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and evaporative cooling effect of trees.

Other causes of a UHI are due to geometric effects. The tall buildings within many urban areas provide multiple surfaces for the reflection and absorption of sunlight, increasing the efficiency with which urban areas are heated. This is called the &quot;urban canyon effect&quot;. Another effect of buildings is the blocking of wind, which also inhibits cooling by convection and prevents pollutants from dissipating. Waste heat from automobiles, air conditioning, industry, and other sources also contributes to the UHI.

Heat islands can be affected by proximity to different types of land cover, so that proximity to barren land causes urban land to become hotter and proximity to vegetation makes it cooler.

=== Air pollution ===
High levels of air pollution in urban areas can also increase the UHI, as many forms of pollution change the radiative properties of the atmosphere. UHI not only raises urban temperatures but also increases ozone concentrations because ozone is a greenhouse gas whose formation will accelerate with the increase of temperature.

=== Climate change as an amplifier ===
Climate change is not a cause but an amplifier of the urban heat island effect. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report from 2022 summarized the available research accordingly: &quot;Climate change increases heat stress risks in cities [...] and amplifies the urban heat island across Asian cities at 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming levels, both substantially larger than under present climates [...].&quot;

The report goes on to say: &quot;In a warming world, increasing air temperature makes the urban heat island effect in cities worse. One key risk is heatwaves in cities that are likely to affect half of the future global urban population, with negative impacts on human health and economic productivity.&quot;

There are unhelpful interactions between heat and built infrastructure: These interactions increase the risk of heat stress for people living in cities.

== Impacts ==
=== On weather and climate ===
Aside from the effect on temperature, UHIs can produce secondary effects on local meteorology, including the altering of local wind patterns, the development of clouds and fog, the humidity, and the rates of precipitation. The extra heat provided by the UHI leads to greater upward motion, which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity. In addition, the UHI creates during the day a local low pressure area where relatively moist air from its rural surroundings converges, possibly leading to more favorable conditions for cloud formation. Rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48% and 116%. Partly as a result of this warming, monthly rainfall is about 28% greater between downwind of cities, compared with upwind. Some cities show a total precipitation increase of 51%.

One study concluded that cities change the climate in area two–four times larger than their own area. One 1999 comparison between urban and rural areas proposed that urban heat island effects have little influence on global mean temperature trends. Others suggested that urban heat islands affect global climate by impacting the jet stream.

=== On human health ===
UHIs have the potential to directly influence the health and welfare of urban residents. As UHIs are characterized by increased temperature, they can potentially increase the magnitude and duration of heat waves within cities. The number of individuals exposed to extreme temperatures is increased by the UHI-induced warming. The nighttime effect of UHIs can be particularly harmful during a heat wave, as it deprives urban residents of the cool relief found in rural areas during the night.

Increased temperatures have been reported to cause heat illnesses, such as heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heat syncope, and heat cramps.

Extreme heat is the deadliest form of weather in the U.S. Per a study by Professor Terri Adams-Fuller, heat waves kill more people in the U.S. than hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes combined. These heat illnesses are more common within medium-to-large metro areas than the rest of the U.S., largely in part due to UHIs. Heat illnesses can also be compounded when combined with air pollution which is common in many urban areas.

Heat exposure can have adverse effects on mental health. Increases in temperature can contribute to increased aggression, as well as more cases of domestic violence and substance abuse. Greater heat can also negatively impact school performance and education. According to a study by Hyunkuk Cho of Yeungnam University, an increased number of days with extreme heat each year correlates to a decrease in student test scores.

High UHI intensity correlates with increased concentrations of air pollutants that gathered at night, which can affect the next day&#x27;s air quality. These pollutants include volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. The production of these pollutants combined with the higher temperatures in UHIs can quicken the production of ozone. Ozone at surface level is considered to be a harmful pollutant. Studies suggest that increased temperatures in UHIs can increase polluted days but also note that other factors (e.g. air pressure, cloud cover, wind speed) can also have an effect on pollution.

Studies from Hong Kong have found that areas of the city with poorer outdoor urban air ventilation tended to have stronger urban heat island effects and had significantly higher all-cause mortality compared to areas with better ventilation. Another study employing advanced statistical methods in Babol city, Iran, revealed a significant increase in Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity (SUHII) from 1985 to 2017, influenced by both geographic direction and time. This research, enhancing the understanding of SUHII&#x27;s spatial and temporal variations, emphasizes the need for precise urban planning to mitigate the health impacts of urban heat islands. Surface UHI&#x27;s are more prominent during the day and are measured using the land surface temperature and remote sensing.

=== On water bodies and aquatic organisms ===
UHIs also impair water quality. Hot pavement and rooftop surfaces transfer their excess heat to stormwater, which then drains into storm sewers and raises water temperatures as it is released into streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes. Additionally, increased urban water body temperatures lead to a decrease in biodiversity in the water. For example, in August 2001, rains over Cedar Rapids, Iowa led to a rise in the nearby stream within one hour, resulting in a fish kill which affected an estimated 188 fish. Since the temperature of the rain was comparatively cool, the deaths could be attributed to the hot pavement of the city. Similar events have been documented across the American Midwest, as well as Oregon and California. Rapid temperature changes can be stressful to aquatic ecosystems.

With the temperature of the nearby buildings sometimes reaching a difference of over from the near-surface air temperature, precipitation warms rapidly, and run-off into nearby streams, lakes and rivers (or other bodies of water) to provide excessive thermal pollution. The increase in thermal pollution has the potential to increase water temperature by . This increase causes the fish species inhabiting the body of water to undergo thermal stress and shock due to the rapid change in temperature of their habitat.

Permeable pavements may reduce these effects by percolating water through the pavement into subsurface storage areas where it can be dissipated through absorption and evaporation.

=== On animals ===
Species that are good at colonizing can use conditions provided by urban heat islands to thrive in regions outside of their normal range. Examples of this include the grey-headed flying fox (&quot;Pteropus poliocephalus&quot;) and the common house gecko (&quot;Hemidactylus frenatus&quot;). Grey-headed flying foxes, found in Melbourne, Australia, colonized urban habitats following the increase in temperatures there. Increased temperatures, causing warmer winter conditions, made the city more similar in climate to the more northerly wildland habitat of the species.

With temperate climates, urban heat islands will extend the growing season, therefore altering breeding strategies of inhabiting species. This can be best observed in the effects that urban heat islands have on water temperature (see effects on water bodies).

Urban heat islands caused by cities have altered the natural selection process. Selective pressures like temporal variation in food, predation and water are relaxed causing a new set of selective forces to roll out. For example, within urban habitats, insects are more abundant than in rural areas. Insects are ectotherms. This means that they depend on the temperature of the environment to control their body temperature, making the warmer climates of the city perfect for their ability to thrive. A study done in Raleigh, North Carolina conducted on &quot;Parthenolecanium quercifex&quot; (oak scales), showed that this particular species preferred warmer climates and were therefore found in higher abundance in urban habitats than on oak trees in rural habitats. Over time spent living in urban habitats, they have adapted to thrive in warmer climates than in cooler ones.

=== On energy usage for cooling ===

Another consequence of urban heat islands is the increased energy required for air conditioning and refrigeration in cities that are in comparatively hot climates. The heat island effect costs Los Angeles about US$ 100 million per year in energy (in the year 2000). Through the implementation of heat island reduction strategies, significant annual net energy savings have been calculated for northern locations such as Chicago, Salt Lake City, and Toronto.

Every year in the U.S. 15% of energy goes towards the air conditioning of buildings in these urban heat islands. It was reported in 1998 that &quot;the air conditioning demand has risen 10% within the last 40 years.&quot;

Increases in air conditioning use also serve to worsen the effects of UHIs at night. While cooler nights are often a reprieve from heat waves during the day, the residual heat created by the use of air conditioning systems can lead to higher nighttime temperatures. According to a study by Professor Francisco Salamanca Palou and colleagues, this residual heat can cause nighttime increases of up to 1 °C in urban areas. Increased energy use from air conditioners also contributes to carbon emissions, which doubly exacerbates the effects of UHIs.

== Options for reducing heat island effects ==
Strategies to improve urban resilience by reducing excessive heat in cities include: Planting trees in cities, cool roofs (painted white or with reflective coating) and light-coloured concrete, green infrastructure (including green roofs), passive daytime radiative cooling.

The temperature difference between urban areas and the surrounding suburban or rural areas can be as much as . Nearly 40 percent of that increase is due to the prevalence of dark roofs, with the remainder coming from dark-coloured pavement and the declining presence of vegetation. The heat island effect can be counteracted slightly by using white or reflective materials to build houses, roofs, pavements, and roads, thus increasing the overall albedo of the city.

Concentric expansion of cities is unfavourable in terms of the urban heat island phenomenon. It is recommended to plan the development of cities in strips, consistent with the hydrographic network, taking into account green areas with various plant species. In this way, it was planned to build urban settlements stretching over large areas, e.g. Kielce, Szczecin and Gdynia in Poland, Copenhagen in Denmark and Hamburg, Berlin and Kiel in Germany.

=== Planting trees in cities ===

Planting trees around the city can be another way of increasing albedo and decreasing the urban heat island effect. It is recommended to plant deciduous trees because they can provide many benefits such as more shade in the summer and not blocking warmth in winter. Trees are a necessary feature in combating most of the urban heat island effect because they reduce air temperatures by , and surface temperatures by up to . Another benefit of having trees in a city is that trees also help fight global warming by absorbing from the atmosphere.

=== Cool roofs and light-coloured concrete ===
Painting rooftops white has become a common strategy to reduce the heat island effect. In cities, there are many dark coloured surfaces that absorb the heat of the sun in turn lowering the albedo of the city. White rooftops allow high solar reflectance and high solar emittance, increasing the albedo of the city or area the effect is occurring.

Additionally, covering rooftops with a reflective coating, has shown to be an effective measure to reduce solar heat gain. A study led by Oscar Brousse from University College London, which simulated the impact of various cooling measures in London found that rooftops, which were either painted white or had reflective coating, proved to be the most effective solution for reducing outdoor temperatures at the pedestrian level, outperforming solar panels, green roofs, and tree cover. The study simulated the impact of various cooling measures in London during a 2018 heatwave, finding that the so-called cool roofs could reduce average outdoor temperatures by 1.2 °C, and up to 2 °C in certain areas. In comparison, additional tree cover reduced temperatures by 0.3 °C and solar panels by 0.5 °C.

Relative to remedying the other sources of the problem, replacing dark roofing requires the least amount of investment for the most immediate return. A cool roof made from a reflective material such as vinyl reflects at least 75 percent of the sun&#x27;s rays, and emit at least 70 percent of the solar radiation absorbed by the building envelope. Asphalt built-up roofs (BUR), by comparison, reflect 6 percent to 26 percent of solar radiation.

Using light-coloured concrete has proven effective in reflecting up to 50% more light than asphalt and reducing ambient temperature. A low albedo value, characteristic of black asphalt, absorbs a large percentage of solar heat creating warmer near-surface temperatures. Paving with light-coloured concrete, in addition to replacing asphalt with light-coloured concrete, communities may be able to lower average temperatures. However, research into the interaction between reflective pavements and buildings has found that, unless the nearby buildings are fitted with reflective glass, solar radiation reflected off light-coloured pavements can increase building temperatures, increasing air conditioning demands.

There are specific paint formulations for daytime radiative cooling that reflect up to 98.1% of sunlight.

=== Green infrastructure ===
Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Plants can improve air quality as they absorb carbon dioxide and concomitantly produce oxygen. Green roofs can also have positive impacts on stormwater management and energy consumption. Cost can be a barrier to implementing a green roof. Several factors influence the cost of a green roof, including design and soil depth, location, and the price of labor and equipment in that market, which is typically lower in more developed markets where there is more experience designing and installing green roofs. The individualized context of each green roof presents a challenge for making broad comparisons and assessments, and focusing only on monetary costs may leave out the social, environmental, and public health benefits green roofs provide. Global comparisons of green roof performance are further challenged by the lack of a shared framework for making such comparisons.

Stormwater management is another option to help mitigate the effect of the urban heat island. Stormwater management is the controlling the water produced by the storm in a way that protects property and infrastructure. Urban infrastructure like streets, sidewalks, and parking lots do not allow for water to penetrate into the earth&#x27;s surface causing water to flood. By using stormwater management, you can control the flow of the water in ways that can mitigate UHI effect. One way is using a stormwater management technique called pervious pavement system (PPS). This technique has been used in over 30 countries and found to be successful in stormwater management and UHI mitigation. The PPS allows water to flow through the pavement allowing for the water to be absorbed causing the area to be cooled by evaporation.

Green parking lots use vegetation and surfaces other than asphalt to limit the urban heat island effect.

=== Passive daytime radiative cooling ===
A passive daytime radiative cooling roof application can double the energy savings of a white roof, attributed to high solar reflectance and thermal emittance in the infrared window, with the highest cooling potential in hot and dry cities such as Phoenix and Las Vegas. When installed on roofs in dense urban areas, passive daytime radiative cooling panels can significantly lower outdoor surface temperatures at the pedestrian level.

== Society and culture ==

=== History of research ===
The phenomenon was first investigated and described by Luke Howard in the 1810s, although he was not the one to name the phenomenon. A description of the very first report of the UHI by Luke Howard said that the urban center of London was warmer at night than the surrounding countryside by .

Investigations of the urban atmosphere continued throughout the nineteenth century. Between the 1920s and the 1940s, researchers in the emerging field of local climatology or microscale meteorology in Europe, Mexico, India, Japan, and the United States pursued new methods to understand the phenomenon.

In 1929, Albert Peppler used the term in a German publication believed to be the first instance of an equivalent to urban heat island: (which is &quot;urban heat island&quot; in German). Between 1990 and 2000, about 30 studies were published annually; by 2010, that number had increased to 100, and by 2015, it was more than 300.

Leonard O. Myrup published the first comprehensive numerical treatment to predict the effects of the urban heat island (UHI) in 1969. His paper surveys UHI and criticizes then-existing theories as being excessively qualitative.

=== Aspects of social inequality ===

Some studies suggest that the effects of UHIs on health may be disproportionate, since the impacts may be unevenly distributed based on a variety of factors such as age, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. This raises the possibility of health impacts from UHIs being an environmental justice issue. Studies have shown that communities of color in the United States have been disproportionately affected by UHI.

There is a correlation between neighborhood income and tree canopy cover. Low-income neighborhoods tend to have significantly fewer trees than neighborhoods with higher incomes. Researchers hypothesized that less-well-off neighborhoods do not have the financial resources to plant and maintain trees. Affluent neighborhoods can afford more trees, on &quot;both public and private property&quot;. One reason for this discrepancy is that wealthier homeowners and communities can afford more land, which can be kept open as green space, whereas poorer housing often takes the form of rentals, where landowners try to maximize their profit by putting as much housing density as possible on their land.

=== Chief heat officers ===
Beginning in the 2020s, a number of cities worldwide began creating Chief Heat Officer positions to organize and manage work counteracting the urban heat island effect.

== Examples ==
=== United States ===
Bill S.4280, introduced to the U.S. Senate in 2020, would authorize the National Integrated Heat Health Information System Interagency Committee (NIHHIS) to tackle extreme heat in the United States. Successful passage of this legislation would fund NIHHIS for five years and would instate a $100 million grant program within NIHHIS to encourage and fund urban heat reduction projects, including those using cools roofs and pavements and those improving HVAC systems. As of July 22, 2020 the bill has not moved past introduction to Congress.

The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.

==== Los Angeles ====
A hypothetical &quot;cool communities&quot; program in Los Angeles has projected in 1997 that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately after planting ten million trees, reroofing five million homes, and painting one-quarter of the roads at an estimated cost of US$1 billion, giving estimated annual benefits of US$170 million from reduced air-conditioning costs and US$360 million in smog related health savings.

In a case study of the Los Angeles Basin in 1998, simulations showed that even when trees are not strategically placed in these urban heat islands, they can still aid in minimization of pollutants and energy reduction. It is estimated that with this wide-scale implementation, the city of Los Angeles can annually save $100M with most of the savings coming from cool roofs, lighter colored pavement, and the planting of trees. With a citywide implementation, added benefits from the lowering smog-level would result in at least one billion dollars of saving per year.

Los Angeles TreePeople is an example of how tree planting can empower a community. TreePeople provides the opportunity for people to come together, build capacity, community pride and the opportunity to collaborate and network with each other.

Los Angeles has also begun to implement a Heat Action Plan to address the city&#x27;s needs at a more granular level than the solutions provided by the state of California. The city uses the LA Equity Index in an effort to ensure that the effects of extreme heat are mitigated in an equitable manner.

==== Virginia ====
In 2021, Climate Adaptation Planning Analysis (CAPA) received funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to conduct Heat Mapping across the United States. Ten areas from Virginia – Abington, Arlington, Charlottesville, Farmville, Harrisonburg, Lynchburg, Petersburg, Richmond, Salem, Virginia Beach and Winchester – participated in the heat watch campaign. This campaign consisted of 213 Volunteers brought together by campaign organizers who made 490,423 Heat Measurements across 70 Routes total. After taking measurements throughout the day, equipment and data was sent back to CAPA where it was analyzed using machine learning algorithms. After analysis of the data, CAPA came back together with campaign organizers from each area to discuss potential plans for each town in the future.

==== New York ====
New York City implemented its &quot;Cool Neighborhoods NYC&quot; program in 2017 intending to mitigate the effects of extreme urban heat. One of the plan&#x27;s ambitions was to increase funding for the city&#x27;s Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Specifically, the plan sought to increase funding for cooling solutions for lower-income families.

=== India ===
Several cities in India experience significant urban heat island effects due to rapid urbanization, loss of green cover, and extensive concretization. A report by &quot;The Hindu&quot; highlights that metropolitan areas like Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Kolkata have seen temperature differences ranging from 1 °C to 6 °C compared to their rural surroundings. These urban heat islands not only increase the local temperatures but also exacerbate the impacts of heatwaves, leading to higher energy consumption for cooling and posing health risks to vulnerable populations.

==== Mumbai ====
Mumbai, India&#x27;s financial hub and one of the most densely populated cities globally, is significantly affected by the urban heat island effect. Rapid urbanization, extensive concretization, and loss of green spaces have led to higher temperatures in the city compared to its surroundings. According to a report, Mumbai is projected to spend twice as much as New York City to manage urban heat generated due to concretization. This increased expenditure highlights the severity of the urban heat island effect in Mumbai and its impact on the city&#x27;s infrastructure and residents.

<text>The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) is a 3G mobile cellular system for networks based on the GSM standard. UMTS uses wideband code-division multiple access (W-CDMA) radio access technology to offer greater spectral efficiency and bandwidth to mobile network operators compared to previous 2G systems like GPRS and CSD. UMTS on its provides a peak theoretical data rate of 2 Mbit/s.

Developed and maintained by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), UMTS is a component of the International Telecommunication Union IMT-2000 standard set and compares with the CDMA2000 standard set for networks based on the competing cdmaOne technology. The technology described in UMTS is sometimes also referred to as Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access (FOMA) or 3GSM.

UMTS specifies a complete network system, which includes the radio access network (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network, or UTRAN), the core network (Mobile Application Part, or MAP) and the authentication of users via SIM (subscriber identity module) cards. Unlike EDGE (IMT Single-Carrier, based on GSM) and CDMA2000 (IMT Multi-Carrier), UMTS requires new base stations and new frequency allocations. UMTS has since been enhanced as High Speed Packet Access (HSPA).

== Features ==
UMTS supports theoretical maximum data transfer rates of 42 Mbit/s when Evolved HSPA (HSPA+) is implemented in the network. Users in deployed networks can expect a transfer rate of up to 384 kbit/s for Release &#x27;99 (R99) handsets (the original UMTS release), and 7.2 Mbit/s for High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) handsets in the downlink connection. These speeds are significantly faster than the 9.6 kbit/s of a single GSM error-corrected circuit switched data channel, multiple 9.6 kbit/s channels in High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data (HSCSD) and 14.4 kbit/s for CDMAOne channels.

Since 2006, UMTS networks in many countries have been or are in the process of being upgraded with High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), sometimes known as 3.5G. Currently, HSDPA enables downlink transfer speeds of up to 21 Mbit/s. Work is also progressing on improving the uplink transfer speed with the High-Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA). The 3GPP LTE standard succeeds UMTS and initially provided 4G speeds of 100 Mbit/s down and 50 Mbit/s up, with scalability up to 3 Gbps, using a next generation air interface technology based upon orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing.

The first national consumer UMTS networks launched in 2002 with a heavy emphasis on telco-provided mobile applications such as mobile TV and video calling. The high data speeds of UMTS are now most often utilised for Internet access: experience in Japan and elsewhere has shown that user demand for video calls is not high, and telco-provided audio/video content has declined in popularity in favour of high-speed access to the World Wide Web either directly on a handset or connected to a computer via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or USB.

== Air interfaces ==
UMTS combines three different terrestrial air interfaces, GSM&#x27;s Mobile Application Part (MAP) core, and the GSM family of speech codecs.

The air interfaces are called UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA). All air interface options are part of ITU&#x27;s IMT-2000. In the currently most popular variant for cellular mobile telephones, W-CDMA (IMT Direct Spread) is used. It is also called &quot;Uu interface&quot;, as it links User Equipment to the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network.

Please note that the terms W-CDMA, TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA are misleading. While they suggest covering just a channel access method (namely a variant of CDMA), they are actually the common names for the whole air interface standards.

=== W-CDMA (UTRA-FDD) ===
W-CDMA (WCDMA; Wideband Code-Division Multiple Access), along with UMTS-FDD, UTRA-FDD, or IMT-2000 CDMA Direct Spread is an air interface standard found in 3G mobile telecommunications networks. It supports conventional cellular voice, text and MMS services, but can also carry data at high speeds, allowing mobile operators to deliver higher bandwidth applications including streaming and broadband Internet access.

W-CDMA uses the DS-CDMA channel access method with a pair of 5 MHz wide channels. In contrast, the competing CDMA2000 system uses one or more available 1.25 MHz channels for each direction of communication. W-CDMA systems are widely criticized for their large spectrum usage, which delayed deployment in countries that acted relatively slowly in allocating new frequencies specifically for 3G services (such as the United States).

The specific frequency bands originally defined by the UMTS standard are 1885–2025 MHz for the mobile-to-base (uplink) and 2110–2200 MHz for the base-to-mobile (downlink). In the US, 1710–1755 MHz and 2110–2155 MHz are used instead, as the 1900 MHz band was already used. While UMTS2100 is the most widely deployed UMTS band, some countries&#x27; UMTS operators use the 850 MHz (900 MHz in Europe) and/or 1900 MHz bands (independently, meaning uplink and downlink are within the same band), notably in the US by AT&amp;T Mobility, New Zealand by Telecom New Zealand on the XT Mobile Network and in Australia by Telstra on the Next G network. Some carriers such as T-Mobile use band numbers to identify the UMTS frequencies. For example, Band I (2100 MHz), Band IV (1700/2100 MHz), and Band V (850 MHz).

UMTS-FDD is an acronym for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) frequency-division duplexing (FDD) and a 3GPP standardized version of UMTS networks that makes use of frequency-division duplexing for duplexing over an UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) air interface.

W-CDMA is the basis of Japan&#x27;s NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s FOMA service and the most-commonly used member of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) family and sometimes used as a synonym for UMTS. It uses the DS-CDMA channel access method and the FDD duplexing method to achieve higher speeds and support more users compared to most previously used time-division multiple access (TDMA) and time-division duplex (TDD) schemes.

While not an evolutionary upgrade on the airside, it uses the same core network as the 2G GSM networks deployed worldwide, allowing dual-mode mobile operation along with GSM/EDGE; a feature it shares with other members of the UMTS family.

==== Development ====
In the late 1990s, W-CDMA was developed by NTT DoCoMo as the air interface for their 3G network FOMA. Later NTT DoCoMo submitted the specification to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as a candidate for the international 3G standard known as IMT-2000. The ITU eventually accepted W-CDMA as part of the IMT-2000 family of 3G standards, as an alternative to CDMA2000, EDGE, and the short range DECT system. Later, W-CDMA was selected as an air interface for UMTS.

As NTT DoCoMo did not wait for the finalisation of the 3G Release 99 specification, their network was initially incompatible with UMTS. However, this has been resolved by NTT DoCoMo updating their network.

Code-Division Multiple Access communication networks have been developed by a number of companies over the years, but development of cell-phone networks based on CDMA (prior to W-CDMA) was dominated by Qualcomm, the first company to succeed in developing a practical and cost-effective CDMA implementation for consumer cell phones and its early IS-95 air interface standard has evolved into the current CDMA2000 (IS-856/IS-2000) standard. Qualcomm created an experimental wideband CDMA system called CDMA2000 3x which unified the W-CDMA (3GPP) and CDMA2000 (3GPP2) network technologies into a single design for a worldwide standard air interface. Compatibility with CDMA2000 would have beneficially enabled roaming on existing networks beyond Japan, since Qualcomm CDMA2000 networks are widely deployed, especially in the Americas, with coverage in 58 countries . However, divergent requirements resulted in the W-CDMA standard being retained and deployed globally. W-CDMA has then become the dominant technology with 457 commercial networks in 178 countries as of April 2012. Several CDMA2000 operators have even converted their networks to W-CDMA for international roaming compatibility and smooth upgrade path to LTE.

Despite incompatibility with existing air-interface standards, late introduction and the high upgrade cost of deploying an all-new transmitter technology, W-CDMA has become the dominant standard.

==== Rationale for W-CDMA ====
W-CDMA transmits on a pair of 5 MHz-wide radio channels, while CDMA2000 transmits on one or several pairs of 1.25 MHz radio channels. Though W-CDMA does use a direct-sequence CDMA transmission technique like CDMA2000, W-CDMA is not simply a wideband version of CDMA2000 and differs in many aspects from CDMA2000. From an engineering point of view, W-CDMA provides a different balance of trade-offs between cost, capacity, performance, and density; it also promises to achieve a benefit of reduced cost for video phone handsets. W-CDMA may also be better suited for deployment in the very dense cities of Europe and Asia. However, hurdles remain, and cross-licensing of patents between Qualcomm and W-CDMA vendors has not eliminated possible patent issues due to the features of W-CDMA which remain covered by Qualcomm patents.

W-CDMA has been developed into a complete set of specifications, a detailed protocol that defines how a mobile phone communicates with the tower, how signals are modulated, how datagrams are structured, and system interfaces are specified allowing free competition on technology elements.

==== Deployment ====
The world&#x27;s first commercial W-CDMA service, FOMA, was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in 2001.

Elsewhere, W-CDMA deployments are usually marketed under the UMTS brand.

W-CDMA has also been adapted for use in satellite communications on the U.S. Mobile User Objective System using geosynchronous satellites in place of cell towers.

J-Phone Japan (once Vodafone and now SoftBank Mobile) soon followed by launching their own W-CDMA based service, originally branded &quot;Vodafone Global Standard&quot; and claiming UMTS compatibility. The name of the service was changed to &quot;Vodafone 3G&quot; (now &quot;SoftBank 3G&quot;) in December 2004.

Beginning in 2003, Hutchison Whampoa gradually launched their upstart UMTS networks.
Most countries have, since the ITU approved of the 3G mobile service, either &quot;auctioned&quot; the radio frequencies to the company willing to pay the most, or conducted a &quot;beauty contest&quot; asking the various companies to present what they intend to commit to if awarded the licences. This strategy has been criticised for aiming to drain the cash of operators to the brink of bankruptcy in order to honour their bids or proposals. Most of them have a time constraint for the rollout of the service where a certain &quot;coverage&quot; must be achieved within a given date or the licence will be revoked.

Vodafone launched several UMTS networks in Europe in February 2004. MobileOne of Singapore commercially launched its 3G (W-CDMA) services in February 2005. New Zealand in August 2005 and Australia in October 2005.

AT&amp;T Mobility utilized a UMTS network, with HSPA+, from 2005 until its shutdown in February 2022.

Rogers in Canada March 2007 has launched HSDPA in the Toronto Golden Horseshoe district on W-CDMA at 850/1900 MHz and plan the launch the service commercial in the top 25 cities October, 2007.

TeliaSonera opened W-CDMA service in Finland October 13, 2004, with speeds up to 384 kbit/s. Availability only in main cities. Pricing is approx. €2/MB.

SK Telecom and KTF, two largest mobile phone service providers in South Korea, have each started offering W-CDMA service in December 2003. Due to poor coverage and lack of choice in handhelds, the W-CDMA service has barely made a dent in the Korean market which was dominated by CDMA2000. By October 2006 both companies are covering more than 90 cities while SK Telecom has announced that it will provide nationwide coverage for its WCDMA network in order for it to offer SBSM (Single Band Single Mode) handsets by the first half of 2007. KT Freecel will thus cut funding to its CDMA2000 network development to the minimum.

In Norway, Telenor introduced W-CDMA in major cities by the end of 2004, while their competitor, NetCom, followed suit a few months later. Both operators have 98% national coverage on EDGE, but Telenor has parallel WLAN roaming networks on GSM, where the UMTS service is competing with this. For this reason Telenor is dropping support of their WLAN service in Austria (2006).

Maxis Communications and Celcom, two mobile phone service providers in Malaysia, started offering W-CDMA services in 2005.

In Sweden, Telia introduced W-CDMA in March 2004.

=== UTRA-TDD ===
UMTS-TDD, an acronym for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) time-division duplexing (TDD), is a 3GPP standardized version of UMTS networks that use UTRA-TDD. UTRA-TDD is a UTRA that uses time-division duplexing for duplexing. While a full implementation of UMTS, it is mainly used to provide Internet access in circumstances similar to those where WiMAX might be used. UMTS-TDD is not directly compatible with UMTS-FDD: a device designed to use one standard cannot, unless specifically designed to, work on the other, because of the difference in air interface technologies and frequencies used. It is more formally as IMT-2000 CDMA-TDD or IMT 2000 Time-Division (IMT-TD).

The two UMTS air interfaces (UTRAs) for UMTS-TDD are TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA. Both air interfaces use a combination of two channel access methods, code-division multiple access (CDMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA): the frequency band is divided into time slots (TDMA), which are further divided into channels using CDMA spreading codes. These air interfaces are classified as TDD, because time slots can be allocated to either uplink or downlink traffic.

==== TD-CDMA (UTRA-TDD 3.84 Mcps High Chip Rate (HCR)) ====
TD-CDMA, an acronym for Time-Division-Code-Division Multiple Access, is a channel-access method based on using spread-spectrum multiple-access (CDMA) across multiple time slots (TDMA). TD-CDMA is the channel access method for UTRA-TDD HCR, which is an acronym for UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access-Time Division Duplex High Chip Rate.

UMTS-TDD&#x27;s air interfaces that use the TD-CDMA channel access technique are standardized as UTRA-TDD HCR, which uses increments of 5 MHz of spectrum, each slice divided into 10 ms frames containing fifteen time slots (1500 per second). The time slots (TS) are allocated in fixed percentage for downlink and uplink. TD-CDMA is used to multiplex streams from or to multiple transceivers. Unlike W-CDMA, it does not need separate frequency bands for up- and downstream, allowing deployment in tight frequency bands.

TD-CDMA is a part of IMT-2000, defined as IMT-TD Time-Division (IMT CDMA TDD), and is one of the three UMTS air interfaces (UTRAs), as standardized by the 3GPP in UTRA-TDD HCR. UTRA-TDD HCR is closely related to W-CDMA, and provides the same types of channels where possible. UMTS&#x27;s HSDPA/HSUPA enhancements are also implemented under TD-CDMA.

In the United States, the technology has been used for public safety and government use in the New York City and a few other areas. In Japan, IPMobile planned to provide TD-CDMA service in year 2006, but it was delayed, changed to TD-SCDMA, and bankrupt before the service officially started.

==== TD-SCDMA (UTRA-TDD 1.28 Mcps Low Chip Rate (LCR)) ====
Time-Division Synchronous Code-Division Multiple Access (TD-SCDMA) or UTRA TDD 1.28 Mcps low chip rate (UTRA-TDD LCR) is an air interface found in UMTS mobile telecommunications networks in China as an alternative to W-CDMA.

TD-SCDMA uses the TDMA channel access method combined with an adaptive synchronous CDMA component on 1.6 MHz slices of spectrum, allowing deployment in even tighter frequency bands than TD-CDMA. It is standardized by the 3GPP and also referred to as &quot;UTRA-TDD LCR&quot;. However, the main incentive for development of this Chinese-developed standard was avoiding or reducing the license fees that have to be paid to non-Chinese patent owners. Unlike the other air interfaces, TD-SCDMA was not part of UMTS from the beginning but has been added in Release 4 of the specification.

Like TD-CDMA, TD-SCDMA is known as IMT CDMA TDD within IMT-2000.

The term &quot;TD-SCDMA&quot; is misleading. While it suggests covering only a channel access method, it is actually the common name for the whole air interface specification.

TD-SCDMA / UMTS-TDD (LCR) networks are incompatible with W-CDMA / UMTS-FDD and TD-CDMA / UMTS-TDD (HCR) networks.

===== Objectives =====
TD-SCDMA was developed in the People&#x27;s Republic of China by the Chinese Academy of Telecommunications Technology (CATT), Datang Telecom, and Siemens AG in an attempt to avoid dependence on Western technology. This is likely primarily for practical reasons, since other 3G formats require the payment of patent fees to a large number of Western patent holders.

TD-SCDMA proponents also claim it is better suited for densely populated areas. Further, it is supposed to cover all usage scenarios, whereas W-CDMA is optimised for symmetric traffic and macro cells, while TD-CDMA is best used in low mobility scenarios within micro or pico cells.

TD-SCDMA is based on spread-spectrum technology which makes it unlikely that it will be able to completely escape the payment of license fees to western patent holders. The launch of a national TD-SCDMA network was initially projected by 2005 but only reached large scale commercial trials with 60,000 users across eight cities in 2008.

On January 7, 2009, China granted a TD-SCDMA 3G licence to China Mobile.

On September 21, 2009, China Mobile officially announced that it had 1,327,000 TD-SCDMA subscribers as of the end of August, 2009.

TD-SCDMA is not commonly used outside of China.

===== Technical highlights =====
TD-SCDMA uses TDD, in contrast to the FDD scheme used by W-CDMA. By dynamically adjusting the number of timeslots used for downlink and uplink, the system can more easily accommodate asymmetric traffic with different data rate requirements on downlink and uplink than FDD schemes. Since it does not require paired spectrum for downlink and uplink, spectrum allocation flexibility is also increased. Using the same carrier frequency for uplink and downlink also means that the channel condition is the same on both directions, and the base station can deduce the downlink channel information from uplink channel estimates, which is helpful to the application of beamforming techniques.

TD-SCDMA also uses TDMA in addition to the CDMA used in WCDMA. This reduces the number of users in each timeslot, which reduces the implementation complexity of multiuser detection and beamforming schemes, but the non-continuous transmission also reduces coverage (because of the higher peak power needed), mobility (because of lower power control frequency) and complicates radio resource management algorithms.

The &quot;S&quot; in TD-SCDMA stands for &quot;synchronous&quot;, which means that uplink signals are synchronized at the base station receiver, achieved by continuous timing adjustments. This reduces the interference between users of the same timeslot using different codes by improving the orthogonality between the codes, therefore increasing system capacity, at the cost of some hardware complexity in achieving uplink synchronization.

===== History =====
On January 20, 2006, Ministry of Information Industry of the People&#x27;s Republic of China formally announced that TD-SCDMA is the country&#x27;s standard of 3G mobile telecommunication. On February 15, 2006, a timeline for deployment of the network in China was announced, stating pre-commercial trials would take place starting after completion of a number of test networks in select cities. These trials ran from March to October, 2006, but the results were apparently unsatisfactory. In early 2007, the Chinese government instructed the dominant cellular carrier, China Mobile, to build commercial trial networks in eight cities, and the two fixed-line carriers, China Telecom and China Netcom, to build one each in two other cities. Construction of these trial networks was scheduled to finish during the fourth quarter of 2007, but delays meant that construction was not complete until early 2008.

The standard has been adopted by 3GPP since Rel-4, known as &quot;UTRA TDD 1.28 Mcps Option&quot;.

On March 28, 2008, China Mobile Group announced TD-SCDMA &quot;commercial trials&quot; for 60,000 test users in eight cities from April 1, 2008. Networks using other 3G standards (WCDMA and CDMA2000 EV/DO) had still not been launched in China, as these were delayed until TD-SCDMA was ready for commercial launch.

In January 2009, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) in China took the unusual step of assigning licences for 3 different third-generation mobile phone standards to three carriers in a long-awaited step that is expected to prompt $41 billion in spending on new equipment. The Chinese-developed standard, TD-SCDMA, was assigned to China Mobile, the world&#x27;s biggest phone carrier by subscribers. That appeared to be an effort to make sure the new system has the financial and technical backing to succeed. Licences for two existing 3G standards, W-CDMA and CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, were assigned to China Unicom and China Telecom, respectively. Third-generation, or 3G, technology supports Web surfing, wireless video and other services and the start of service is expected to spur new revenue growth.

The technical split by MIIT has hampered the performance of China Mobile in the 3G market, with users and China Mobile engineers alike pointing to the lack of suitable handsets to use on the network. Deployment of base stations has also been slow, resulting in lack of improvement of service for users. The network connection itself has consistently been slower than that from the other two carriers, leading to a sharp decline in market share. By 2011 China Mobile has already moved its focus onto TD-LTE. Gradual closures of TD-SCDMA stations started in 2016.

===== Frequency bands &amp; Deployments =====

The following is a list of mobile telecommunications networks using third-generation TD-SCDMA / UMTS-TDD (LCR) technology.

==== Unlicensed UMTS-TDD ====
In Europe, CEPT allocated the 2010–2020 MHz range for a variant of UMTS-TDD designed for unlicensed, self-provided use. Some telecom groups and jurisdictions have proposed withdrawing this service in favour of licensed UMTS-TDD, due to lack of demand, and lack of development of a UMTS TDD air interface technology suitable for deployment in this band.

==== Comparison with UMTS-FDD ====
Ordinary UMTS uses UTRA-FDD as an air interface and is known as UMTS-FDD. UMTS-FDD uses W-CDMA for multiple access and frequency-division duplex for duplexing, meaning that the up-link and down-link transmit on different frequencies. UMTS is usually transmitted on frequencies assigned for 1G, 2G, or 3G mobile telephone service in the countries of operation.

UMTS-TDD uses time-division duplexing, allowing the up-link and down-link to share the same spectrum. This allows the operator to more flexibly divide the usage of available spectrum according to traffic patterns. For ordinary phone service, you would expect the up-link and down-link to carry approximately equal amounts of data (because every phone call needs a voice transmission in either direction), but Internet-oriented traffic is more frequently one-way. For example, when browsing a website, the user will send commands, which are short, to the server, but the server will send whole files, that are generally larger than those commands, in response.

UMTS-TDD tends to be allocated frequency intended for mobile/wireless Internet services rather than used on existing cellular frequencies. This is, in part, because TDD duplexing is not normally allowed on cellular, PCS/PCN, and 3G frequencies. TDD technologies open up the usage of left-over unpaired spectrum.

Europe-wide, several bands are provided either specifically for UMTS-TDD or for similar technologies. These are 1900 MHz and 1920 MHz and between 2010 MHz and 2025 MHz. In several countries the 25002690 MHz band (also known as MMDS in the USA) have been used for UMTS-TDD deployments. Additionally, spectrum around the 3.5 GHz range has been allocated in some countries, notably Britain, in a technology-neutral environment. In the Czech Republic UTMS-TDD is also used in a frequency range around 872 MHz.

==== Deployment ====
UMTS-TDD has been deployed for public and/or private networks in at least nineteen countries around the world, with live systems in, amongst other countries, Australia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Botswana, South Africa, the UK, and the USA.

Deployments in the US thus far have been limited. It has been selected for a public safety support network used by emergency responders in New York, but outside of some experimental systems, notably one from Nextel, thus far the WiMAX standard appears to have gained greater traction as a general mobile Internet access system.

==== Competing standards ====
A variety of Internet-access systems exist which provide broadband speed access to the net. These include WiMAX and HIPERMAN. UMTS-TDD has the advantages of being able to use an operator&#x27;s existing UMTS/GSM infrastructure, should it have one, and that it includes UMTS modes optimized for circuit switching should, for example, the operator want to offer telephone service. UMTS-TDD&#x27;s performance is also more consistent. However, UMTS-TDD deployers often have regulatory problems with taking advantage of some of the services UMTS compatibility provides. For example, the UMTS-TDD spectrum in the UK cannot be used to provide telephone service, though the regulator OFCOM is discussing the possibility of allowing it at some point in the future. Few operators considering UMTS-TDD have existing UMTS/GSM infrastructure.

Additionally, the WiMAX and HIPERMAN systems provide significantly larger bandwidths when the mobile station is near the tower.

Like most mobile Internet access systems, many users who might otherwise choose UMTS-TDD will find their needs covered by the ad hoc collection of unconnected Wi-Fi access points at many restaurants and transportation hubs, and/or by Internet access already provided by their mobile phone operator. By comparison, UMTS-TDD (and systems like WiMAX) offers mobile, and more consistent, access than the former, and generally faster access than the latter.

== Radio access network ==
UMTS also specifies the Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN), which is composed of multiple base stations, possibly using different terrestrial air interface standards and frequency bands.

UMTS and GSM/EDGE can share a Core Network (CN), making UTRAN an alternative radio access network to GERAN (GSM/EDGE RAN), and allowing (mostly) transparent switching between the RANs according to available coverage and service needs. Because of that, UMTS&#x27;s and GSM/EDGE&#x27;s radio access networks are sometimes collectively referred to as UTRAN/GERAN.
UMTS networks are often combined with GSM/EDGE, the latter of which is also a part of IMT-2000.

The UE (User Equipment) interface of the RAN (Radio Access Network) primarily consists of RRC (Radio Resource Control), PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol), RLC (Radio Link Control) and MAC (Media Access Control) protocols. RRC protocol handles connection establishment, measurements, radio bearer services, security and handover decisions. RLC protocol primarily divides into three ModesTransparent Mode (TM), Unacknowledge Mode (UM), Acknowledge Mode (AM). The functionality of AM entity resembles TCP operation whereas UM operation resembles UDP operation. In TM mode, data will be sent to lower layers without adding any header to SDU of higher layers. MAC handles the scheduling of data on air interface depending on higher layer (RRC) configured parameters.

The set of properties related to data transmission is called Radio Bearer (RB). This set of properties decides the maximum allowed data in a TTI (Transmission Time Interval). RB includes RLC information and RB mapping. RB mapping decides the mapping between RB&lt;-&gt;logical channel&lt;-&gt;transport channel. Signaling messages are sent on Signaling Radio Bearers (SRBs) and data packets (either CS or PS) are sent on data RBs. RRC and NAS messages go on SRBs.

Security includes two procedures: integrity and ciphering. Integrity validates the resource of messages and also makes sure that no one (third/unknown party) on the radio interface has modified the messages. Ciphering ensures that no one listens to your data on the air interface. Both integrity and ciphering are applied for SRBs whereas only ciphering is applied for data RBs.

== Core network ==
With Mobile Application Part, UMTS uses the same core network standard as GSM/EDGE. This allows a simple migration for existing GSM operators. However, the migration path to UMTS is still costly: while much of the core infrastructure is shared with GSM, the cost of obtaining new spectrum licenses and overlaying UMTS at existing towers is high.

The CN can be connected to various backbone networks, such as the Internet or an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) telephone network. UMTS (and GERAN) include the three lowest layers of OSI model. The network layer (OSI 3) includes the Radio Resource Management protocol (RRM) that manages the bearer channels between the mobile terminals and the fixed network, including the handovers.

== Frequency bands and channel bandwidths ==
=== UARFCN ===
A UARFCN (abbreviation for UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number, where UTRA stands for UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access) is used to identify a frequency in the UMTS frequency bands.

Typically channel number is derived from the frequency in MHz through the formula Channel Number = Frequency * 5. However, this is only able to represent channels that are centered on a multiple of 200 kHz, which do not align with licensing in North America. 3GPP added several special values for the common North American channels.

=== Spectrum allocation ===
Over 130 licenses had been awarded to operators worldwide, as of December 2004, specifying W-CDMA radio access technology that builds on GSM. In Europe, the license process occurred at the tail end of the technology bubble, and the auction mechanisms for allocation set up in some countries resulted in some extremely high prices being paid for the original 2100 MHz licenses, notably in the UK and Germany. In Germany, bidders paid a total €50.8 billion for six licenses, two of which were subsequently abandoned and written off by their purchasers (Mobilcom and the Sonera/Telefónica consortium). It has been suggested that these huge license fees have the character of a very large tax paid on future income expected many years down the road. In any event, the high prices paid put some European telecom operators close to bankruptcy (most notably KPN). Over the last few years some operators have written off some or all of the license costs. Between 2007 and 2009, all three Finnish carriers began to use 900 MHz UMTS in a shared arrangement with its surrounding 2G GSM base stations for rural area coverage, a trend that is expected to expand over Europe in the next 1–3 years.

The 2100 MHz band (downlink around 2100 MHz and uplink around 1900 MHz) allocated for UMTS in Europe and most of Asia is already used in North America. The 1900 MHz range is used for 2G (PCS) services, and 2100 MHz range is used for satellite communications. Regulators have, however, freed up some of the 2100 MHz range for 3G services, together with a different range around 1700 MHz for the uplink. 

AT&amp;T Wireless launched UMTS services in the United States by the end of 2004 strictly using the existing 1900 MHz spectrum allocated for 2G PCS services. Cingular acquired AT&amp;T Wireless in 2004 and has since then launched UMTS in select US cities. Cingular renamed itself AT&amp;T Mobility and rolled out some cities with a UMTS network at 850 MHz to enhance its existing UMTS network at 1900 MHz and now offers subscribers a number of dual-band UMTS 850/1900 phones.

T-Mobile&#x27;s rollout of UMTS in the US was originally focused on the 1700 MHz band. However, T-Mobile has been moving users from 1700 MHz to 1900 MHz (PCS) in order to reallocate the spectrum to 4G LTE services.

In Canada, UMTS coverage is being provided on the 850 MHz and 1900 MHz bands on the Rogers and Bell-Telus networks. Bell and Telus share the network. Recently, new providers Wind Mobile, Mobilicity and Videotron have begun operations in the 1700 MHz band.

In 2008, Australian telco Telstra replaced its existing CDMA network with a national UMTS-based 3G network, branded as NextG, operating in the 850 MHz band. Telstra currently provides UMTS service on this network, and also on the 2100 MHz UMTS network, through a co-ownership of the owning and administrating company 3GIS. This company is also co-owned by Hutchison 3G Australia, and this is the primary network used by their customers. Optus is currently rolling out a 3G network operating on the 2100 MHz band in cities and most large towns, and the 900 MHz band in regional areas. Vodafone is also building a 3G network using the 900 MHz band.

In India, BSNL has started its 3G services since October 2009, beginning with the larger cities and then expanding over to smaller cities. The 850 MHz and 900 MHz bands provide greater coverage compared to equivalent 1700/1900/2100 MHz networks, and are best suited to regional areas where greater distances separate base station and subscriber.

Carriers in South America are now also rolling out 850 MHz networks.

== Interoperability and global roaming ==
UMTS phones (and data cards) are highly portable they have been designed to roam easily onto other UMTS networks (if the providers have roaming agreements in place). In addition, almost all UMTS phones are UMTS/GSM dual-mode devices, so if a UMTS phone travels outside of UMTS coverage during a call the call may be transparently handed off to available GSM coverage. Roaming charges are usually significantly higher than regular usage charges.

Most UMTS licensees consider ubiquitous, transparent global roaming an important issue. To enable a high degree of interoperability, UMTS phones usually support several different frequencies in addition to their GSM fallback. Different countries support different UMTS frequency bandsEurope initially used 2100 MHz while the most carriers in the USA use 850 MHz and 1900 MHz. T-Mobile has launched a network in the US operating at 1700 MHz (uplink) /2100 MHz (downlink), and these bands also have been adopted elsewhere in the US and in Canada and Latin America. A UMTS phone and network must support a common frequency to work together. Because of the frequencies used, early models of UMTS phones designated for the United States will likely not be operable elsewhere and vice versa. There are now 11 different frequency combinations used around the world including frequencies formerly used solely for 2G services.

UMTS phones can use a Universal Subscriber Identity Module, USIM (based on GSM&#x27;s SIM card) and also work (including UMTS services) with GSM SIM cards. This is a global standard of identification, and enables a network to identify and authenticate the (U)SIM in the phone. Roaming agreements between networks allow for calls to a customer to be redirected to them while roaming and determine the services (and prices) available to the user. In addition to user subscriber information and authentication information, the (U)SIM provides storage space for phone book contact. Handsets can store their data on their own memory or on the (U)SIM card (which is usually more limited in its phone book contact information). A (U)SIM can be moved to another UMTS or GSM phone, and the phone will take on the user details of the (U)SIM, meaning it is the (U)SIM (not the phone) which determines the phone number of the phone and the billing for calls made from the phone.

Japan was the first country to adopt 3G technologies, and since they had not used GSM previously they had no need to build GSM compatibility into their handsets and their 3G handsets were smaller than those available elsewhere. In 2002, NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s FOMA 3G network was the first commercial UMTS networkusing a pre-release specification, it was initially incompatible with the UMTS standard at the radio level but used standard USIM cards, meaning USIM card based roaming was possible (transferring the USIM card into a UMTS or GSM phone when travelling). Both NTT DoCoMo and SoftBank Mobile (which launched 3G in December 2002) now use standard UMTS.

=== Handsets and modems ===

All of the major 2G phone manufacturers (that are still in business) are now manufacturers of 3G phones. The early 3G handsets and modems were specific to the frequencies required in their country, which meant they could only roam to other countries on the same 3G frequency (though they can fall back to the older GSM standard). Canada and USA have a common share of frequencies, as do most European countries. The article UMTS frequency bands is an overview of UMTS network frequencies around the world.

Using a cellular router, PCMCIA or USB card, customers are able to access 3G broadband services, regardless of their choice of computer (such as a tablet PC or a PDA). Some software installs itself from the modem, so that in some cases absolutely no knowledge of technology is required to get online in moments. Using a phone that supports 3G and Bluetooth 2.0, multiple Bluetooth-capable laptops can be connected to the Internet. Some smartphones can also act as a mobile WLAN access point.

There are very few 3G phones or modems available supporting all 3G frequencies (UMTS850/900/1700/1900/2100 MHz). In 2010, Nokia released a range of phones with Pentaband 3G coverage, including the N8 and E7. Many other phones are offering more than one band which still enables extensive roaming. For example, Apple&#x27;s iPhone 4 contains a quadband chipset operating on 850/900/1900/2100 MHz, allowing usage in the majority of countries where UMTS-FDD is deployed.

== Other competing standards ==
The main competitor to UMTS is CDMA2000 (IMT-MC), which is developed by the 3GPP2. Unlike UMTS, CDMA2000 is an evolutionary upgrade to an existing 2G standard, cdmaOne, and is able to operate within the same frequency allocations. This and CDMA2000&#x27;s narrower bandwidth requirements make it easier to deploy in existing spectra. In some, but not all, cases, existing GSM operators only have enough spectrum to implement either UMTS or GSM, not both. For example, in the US D, E, and F PCS spectrum blocks, the amount of spectrum available is 5 MHz in each direction. A standard UMTS system would saturate that spectrum. Where CDMA2000 is deployed, it usually co-exists with UMTS. In many markets however, the co-existence issue is of little relevance, as legislative hurdles exist to co-deploying two standards in the same licensed slice of spectrum.

Another competitor to UMTS is EDGE (IMT-SC), which is an evolutionary upgrade to the 2G GSM system, leveraging existing GSM spectrums. It is also much easier, quicker, and considerably cheaper for wireless carriers to &quot;bolt-on&quot; EDGE functionality by upgrading their existing GSM transmission hardware to support EDGE rather than having to install almost all brand-new equipment to deliver UMTS. However, being developed by 3GPP just as UMTS, EDGE is not a true competitor. Instead, it is used as a temporary solution preceding UMTS roll-out or as a complement for rural areas. This is facilitated by the fact that GSM/EDGE and UMTS specifications are jointly developed and rely on the same core network, allowing dual-mode operation including vertical handovers. 

China&#x27;s TD-SCDMA standard is often seen as a competitor, too. TD-SCDMA has been added to UMTS&#x27; Release 4 as UTRA-TDD 1.28 Mcps Low Chip Rate (UTRA-TDD LCR). Unlike TD-CDMA (UTRA-TDD 3.84 Mcps High Chip Rate, UTRA-TDD HCR) which complements W-CDMA (UTRA-FDD), it is suitable for both micro and macrocells. However, the lack of vendors&#x27; support is preventing it from being a real competitor.

While DECT is technically capable of competing with UMTS and other cellular networks in densely populated, urban areas, it has only been deployed for domestic cordless phones and private in-house networks.

All of these competitors have been accepted by ITU as part of the IMT-2000 family of 3G standards, along with UMTS-FDD.

On the Internet access side, competing systems include WiMAX and Flash-OFDM.

== Migrating from GSM/GPRS to UMTS ==
From a GSM/GPRS network, the following network elements can be reused:
* Home Location Register (HLR)
* Visitor Location Register (VLR)
* Equipment Identity Register (EIR)
* Mobile Switching Center (MSC)
* Gateway Mobile Switching Center (GMSC)
* Authentication Center (AUC)
* Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)
* Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN)

From a GSM/GPRS communication radio network, the following elements cannot be reused:
* Base transceiver station (BTS)
* Base station controller (BSC)
* Packet Control Unit (PCU)
They can remain in the network and be used in dual network operation where 2G and 3G networks co-exist while network migration and new 3G terminals become available for use in the network.

The UMTS network introduces new network elements that function as specified by 3GPP:
* Node B (base transceiver station)
* Radio Network Controller (RNC)
* Media Gateway (MGW)

The functionality of MSC changes when going to UMTS. In a GSM system the MSC handles all the circuit switched operations like connecting A- and B-subscriber through the network. In UMTS the Media gateway (MGW) takes care of data transfer in circuit switched networks. MSC controls MGW operations.

== Problems and issues ==
Some countries, including the United States, have allocated spectrum differently from the ITU recommendations, so that the standard bands most commonly used for UMTS (UMTS-2100) have not been available. In those countries, alternative bands are used, preventing the interoperability of existing UMTS-2100 equipment, and requiring the design and manufacture of different equipment for the use in these markets. As is the case with GSM900 today, standard UMTS 2100 MHz equipment will not work in those markets. However, it appears as though UMTS is not suffering as much from handset band compatibility issues as GSM did, as many UMTS handsets are multi-band in both UMTS and GSM modes. Penta-band (850, 900, 1700, 2100, and 1900 MHz bands), quad-band GSM (850, 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz bands) and tri-band UMTS (850, 1900, and 2100 MHz bands) handsets are becoming more commonplace.

In its early days, UMTS had problems in many countries: Overweight handsets with poor battery life were first to arrive on a market highly sensitive to weight and form factor. The Motorola A830, a debut handset on Hutchison&#x27;s 3 network, weighed more than 200 grams and even featured a detachable camera to reduce handset weight. Another significant issue involved call reliability, related to problems with handover from UMTS to GSM. Customers found their connections being dropped as handovers were possible only in one direction (UMTS → GSM), with the handset only changing back to UMTS after hanging up. In most networks around the world this is no longer an issue.

Compared to GSM, UMTS networks initially required a higher base station density. For fully-fledged UMTS incorporating video on demand features, one base station needed to be set up every 1–1.5 km (0.62–0.93 mi). This was the case when only the 2100 MHz band was being used, however with the growing use of lower-frequency bands (such as 850 and 900 MHz) this is no longer so. This has led to increasing rollout of the lower-band networks by operators since 2006.

Even with current technologies and low-band UMTS, telephony and data over UMTS requires more power than on comparable GSM networks. Apple Inc. cited UMTS power consumption as the reason that the first generation iPhone only supported EDGE. Their release of the iPhone 3G quotes talk time on UMTS as half that available when the handset is set to use GSM. Other manufacturers indicate different battery lifetime for UMTS mode compared to GSM mode as well. As battery and network technology improve, this issue is diminishing.

=== Security issues ===
As early as 2008, it was known that carrier networks can be used to surreptitiously gather user location information. In August 2014, the Washington Post reported on widespread marketing of surveillance systems using Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) protocols to locate callers anywhere in the world.

In December 2014, news broke that SS7&#x27;s very own functions can be repurposed for surveillance, because of its relaxed security, in order to listen to calls in real time or to record encrypted calls and texts for later decryption, or to defraud users and cellular carriers.

Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone declared the same day that they had fixed gaps in their networks, but that the problem is global and can only be fixed with a telecommunication system-wide solution.

<text>The Uzbeks (, ) are a Turkic ethnic group native to Central Asia, being among the largest Turkic ethnic groups in the area. They comprise the majority population of Uzbekistan, next to Kazakh and Karakalpak minorities, and also form minority groups in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Russia, and China. Uzbek diaspora communities also exist in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, United States, Ukraine, Pakistan, and other countries.

==Etymology==

The origin of the word &quot;Uzbek&quot; is disputed. One view holds that it is eponymously named after Oghuz Khagan, also known as &quot;Oghuz Beg&quot;, became the word &quot;Uzbeg&quot; or &quot;Uzbek&quot;. Another theory states that the name means &quot;independent&quot;, &quot;genuine man&quot;, or the &quot;lord himself&quot;, from &quot;Öz&quot; (self) and the Turkic title &quot;bek/bey/beg&quot;. A third theory holds that the variant &quot;Uz&quot;, of the word &quot;uğuz&quot;, earlier &quot;oğuz&quot;, united with the word &quot;bek&quot; to form &quot;Uğuz-bek&quot; &gt; &quot;Uz-bek&quot;, meaning &quot;leader of an oğuz&quot;.

The personal name &quot;Uzbek&quot; is found in Arabic and Persian historical writings. Historian Usama ibn Munqidh (d. 1188), describing the events in Iran under the Seljuk Empire, notes that one of the leaders of Bursuk&#x27;s troops in 1115–1116 was the &quot;emir of the troops&quot; Uzbek, the ruler of Mosul. According to Rashid ad-din, the last representative of the Oghuz dynasty of Ildegizids who ruled in Tabriz was Uzbek Muzaffar 1210–1225.

The name Uzbek seems to have become widely adopted as an ethnonym under the rule of Ozbeg Khan, who converted the Golden Horde to Islam.

==Origins==
Before the 5th century, what is today&#x27;s Uzbekistan was part of Sogdia, Khwarazm, Bactria mainly inhabited by Sogdians, Bactrians, and Khwarazmians, all Indo-Iranian peoples. It was part of the Achaemenid Empire in the sixth to fourth centuries BC and, by the 3rd century CE, part of Sasanian Empire.

From the fifth to sixth century, what is today&#x27;s Uzbekistan was part of the Hephthalite Empire. From 6th to 8th century, what is today&#x27;s Uzbekistan was under the rule of First Turkic Khaganate.

The Turkic component was part of the Kidarites in the fifth century. The seal of the Kidarites, made in the 5th century in Samarkand, has a Bactrian inscription containing the title of the ruler: &quot;Oglar Khun&quot;, of Turkic origin.

Since the entry of Central Asia into the Turkic Khaganate (6th century), the process of Turkicization has intensified. In subsequent centuries, the main ethnocultural process that took place on the territory of the Central Asian interfluve was the convergence and partial merging of the settled, Iranian-speaking and Turkic-speaking, with the nomadic, mainly Turkic-speaking population.

Turkic and Chinese migration into Central Asia occurred during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and Chinese armies commanded by Turkic generals stationed in large parts of Central Asia. But Chinese influence ended with the An Lushan Rebellion. During the ninth and tenth centuries, Transoxiana was ruled by the Persian Samanid Empire. From the 11th century on, Transoxiana was under the rule of the Turkic Kara-Khanid Khanate, their arrival in Transoxiana signalled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia. The Kara-Khanid ruler Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan was the first Turkic ruler to convert to Islam, most people of Central Asia soon followed. In the 12th century, Transoxiana was conquered by the Qara Khitai (Western Liao), a sinicized Khitan dynasty, they brought to Central Asia the Chinese system of government. In the 13th century, Kara-Khanid Khanate was destroyed by the Turkic Anushtegin dynasty, a former vassal of the Qara Khitai.

Although Turko-Mongol infiltration into Central Asia had started early, and the influence of the Turkic tribes was felt in Khwarazm before the campaigns of the Mongols, after the beginning of the Chingizid rule, bilingualism became more common. It is generally believed that these ancient Indo-European-speaking peoples were linguistically assimilated by smaller but dominant Turkic-speaking groups while the sedentary population finally adopted the Persian language, the traditional &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the eastern Islamic lands. The language-shift from Middle Iranian to Turkic and New Persian was predominantly the result of an &quot;elite dominance&quot; process. Peter B. Golden listed three basic ethnic elements contributing to the Uzbeks&#x27; ethnogenesis:
# the Turkicized, formerly Iranian-speaking sedentary Sarts, a composite population including both Iranians (Sakas, Sogdians, Khwarzamians, Kushano-Bactrians) and some Arab elements;
# the pre-Uzbek amalgam of nomadic Türk(î) or Chagatays, who consisted of Karluks, Yaghmas and other tribes of the Göktürks&#x27; khaganates, and later of the Kara-Khanid Khanate, Oghuz Turks, the Kangly-Kipchaks (particularly in the western region) and many Turkicized Mongol tribes (Barlas, Jalair, etc.), who entered Central Asia with the Mongol and Timurid conquests and invasions.
# The East Kipchak-speaking &quot;Pure Uzbeks&quot; (&quot;Taza Özbek&quot;).
The modern Uzbek language is largely derived from the Chagatai language which gained prominence in the Timurid Empire. The position of Chagatai (and later Uzbek) was further strengthened after the fall of the Timurids and the rise of the Shaybanid Uzbek Khaqanate that finally shaped the Turkic language and identity of modern Uzbeks, while the unique grammatical and phonetical features of the Uzbek language as well as the modern Uzbek culture reflect the more ancient Iranian roots of the Uzbek people.

===Genetic origins===
Uzbeks share a large portion of their ancestry with nearby Turkic populations, including Kyrgyz people, Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Bashkirs.

The western ancestry of Uzbeks includes a Caucasus component (≈35–40%), and a (Northern) European component (≈5–20%), the Uzbeks eastern ancestry includes an Eastern Asian component (≈35%), and a (Central and East) Siberian component (≈5–20%). The best proxy for their western ancestry are modern day Abkhaz people, while the best proxy for their eastern ancestry are Yakuts (or alternatively, Tuvans).

A study on modern Central Asians comparing them to ancient historical samples found that Uzbeks can be modeled as 48.8–65.1% Iron Age Indo-Iranians, and 34.9–51.2% Eastern Steppe Xiongnu, from the Mongolian Plateau.

===Paternal haplogroups===
Based on the research of several studies, the paternal lineages of Uzbeks have been described:
* Haplogroup R1a1, a West Eurasian haplogroup, occurs at a rate of 17-32% among Uzbek men, making it the predominant Y-DNA lineage among Uzbeks. It is unclear if this haplogroup in Uzbeks came from local Bronze Age Indo-European pastoralists, or if it originates from Turkic migrants, because despite being considered a diagnostic Indo-Iranian haplogroup, it occurs at a high frequency among Turkic males from Siberia.
* Haplogroup J, a West Eurasian haplogroup, occurs at a rate of 5.9–21.4% in Uzbek males. This haplogroup has been present in the Middle East for tens of thousands of years.
* Haplogroup C2, an East Eurasian haplogroup, occurs at a rate of 4–18% among Uzbek men. In one sample from Afghanistan, 41.2% of Uzbek men carried this haplogroup. Lee &amp; Kuang posit that the males in this sample are descended from the nomadic Uzbeks of the Qipchaq steppe. It is likely that haplogroup C2 was brought to the middle east by Turkic or Mongolic peoples, along with minor Uzbek haplogroups O3 and N.

===Maternal haplogroups===
According to a 2010 study, slightly more than 50% of Uzbeks from Tashkent belong to East Eurasian and South Asian maternal haplogroups, while nearly 50% belong to West Eurasian haplogroups.

A majority of Uzbeks from Ferghana belong to East Eurasian and South Asian maternal haplogroups, while considerably fewer belong to West Eurasian haplogroups.

In Khorzem and Qashkadarya, a majority of Uzbeks belong to West Eurasian maternal haplogroups, while considerably fewer belong to East Eurasian and South Asian haplogroups.

In the southern part of Central Asia, there was a Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex, which has recently been dated to c. 2250–1700 BC. That name is the modern archaeological designation for a Bronze Age civilization of Central Asia, previously dated to c. 2400–1900 BC by Sandro Salvatori.

Iranian nomads arrived from the northern grasslands of what is now Uzbekistan sometime in the first millennium BC. These nomads, who spoke Iranian dialects, settled in Central Asia and began to build an extensive irrigation system along the rivers of the region. At this time, cities such as Bukhara and Samarkand began to appear as centers of government and culture. By the 5th century BC, the Bactrian, Khwarazm, Soghdian, and Tokharian states dominated the region.

Alexander the Great conquered Sogdiana and Bactria in 329 BC, marrying Roxana, daughter of a local Bactrian chieftain. The conquest was supposedly of little help to Alexander as popular resistance was fierce, causing Alexander&#x27;s army to be bogged down in the region that became the northern part of Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. For many centuries the region of Uzbekistan was ruled by Persian empires, including the Parthian and Sassanid Empires.

In the first centuries, the northern territories of modern Uzbekistan were part of the Kangju nomad state.

With the arrival of the Greeks, writing based on the Greek alphabet began to spread on the territory of Bactria and Sogdiana. As a result of archaeological research on the territory of Sogdiana and Bactria, fragments of pottery with Greek inscriptions have been found.

In 2nd century BC China began to develop its silk trade with the West. Because of this trade on what became known as the Silk Route, Bukhara and Samarkand eventually became extremely wealthy cities, and at times Mawarannahr (Transoxiana) was one of the most influential and powerful Persian provinces of antiquity.

In 350–375 AD, Sogdiana and Tashkent oasis were captured by the nomadic Xionite tribes who arrived from the steppe regions of Central Asia.
=== Turkic Khaganate period ===
The First Turkic Khaganate and migration of the population played a large role in the formation of a sedentary Turkic population in the territory of the oases of Central Asia in the 6th–8th centuries.

In the Western Turkic Khaganate, in addition to various Turkic tribes, there were Iranian nomadic elements, which were gradually assimilated by the Turks. The urban population of Sogd, Khwarazm, Bactria was in close contact with the Turks.

Turkic names and titles are found in Bactrian documents of the 7th–8th centuries: kagan, tapaglig eltabir, tarkhan, tudun, the names Kutlug Tapaglig Bilga savuk, Kara-tongi, Tongaspar, Turkic ethnic names: halach, Turk. During the excavations of the Sogdian Penjikent, a fragment of a draft letter in the Sogdian language was discovered, in the text of which there is a Turkic name Turkash 

The Turkic population of the Fergana Valley had their own runic writing. The Turkic rulers of Ferghana, Tokharistan, Bukhara and Chach issued their own coins.

The Turkic population of certain regions of Central Asia in the early Middle Ages had their own urban culture and used the proper Turkic terms, for example, baliq, which meant city.

The Turks had a great influence in the development of the armament of the Sogdians. The Turks are depicted in the wall paintings of ancient Samarkand.

=== Early Islamic period ===
The conquest of Central Asia by Muslim Arabs, which was completed in the 8th century AD, brought to the region a new religion that continues to be dominant. The Arabs first invaded Mawarannahr in the middle of the 7th century through sporadic raids during their conquest of Persia. Available sources on the Arab conquest suggest that the Soghdians and other Iranian peoples of Central Asia were unable to defend their land against the Arabs because of internal divisions and the lack of strong indigenous leadership. The Arabs, on the other hand, were led by a brilliant general, Qutaybah ibn Muslim, and were also highly motivated by the desire to spread their new faith, Islam, the official beginning of which was in AD 622. Because of these factors, the population of Mawarannahr was easily subdued. The new religion brought by the Arabs spread gradually into the region. The native religious identities, which in some respects were already being displaced by Persian influences before the Arabs arrived, were further displaced in the ensuing centuries. Nevertheless, the destiny of Central Asia as an Islamic region was firmly established by the Arab victory over the Chinese armies in 750 in a battle at the Talas River.

Despite brief Arab rule, Central Asia successfully retained much of its Iranian characteristic, remaining an important center of culture and trade for centuries after the adoption of the new religion. Mawarannahr continued to be an important political player in regional affairs, as it had been under various Persian dynasties. In fact, the Abbasid Caliphate, which ruled the Arab world for five centuries beginning in 750, was established thanks in great part to assistance from Central Asian supporters in their struggle against the then-ruling Umayyad Caliphate.

During the height of the Abbasid Caliphate in the 8th and 9th centuries, Central Asia and Mawarannahr experienced a truly golden age. Bukhara became one of the leading centers of learning, culture, and art in the Muslim world, its magnificence rivaling contemporaneous cultural centers such as Baghdad, Cairo, and Cordoba. Some of the greatest historians, scientists, and geographers in the history of Islamic culture were natives of the region.

As the Abbasid Caliphate began to weaken and local Islamic Iranian states emerged as the rulers of Iran and Central Asia, the Persian language continued its preeminent role in the region as the language of literature and government. The rulers of the eastern section of Iran and of Mawarannahr were Persians. Under the Samanids and the Buyids, the rich Perso-Islamic culture of Mawarannahr continued to flourish.

=== Samanid Empire, Ghaznavids, and Kara-Khanid Khanate ===
The Samanids were a Persian state that reigned for 180 years, encompassing a vast territoriy stretching from Central Asia to West Asia. The Samanids were descendants of Bahram Chobin, and thus descended from the House of Mihrān, one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran. In governing their territory, the Samanids modeled their state organization after the Abbasids, mirroring the caliph&#x27;s court and organization. They were rewarded for supporting the Abbasids in Transoxania and Khorasan, and with their established capitals located in Bukhara, Balkh, Samarkand, and Herat, they carved their kingdom after defeating the Saffarids.

The Samanid Empire was the first native Persian dynasty to arise after the Muslim Arab conquest. The four grandsons of the dynasty&#x27;s founder, Saman Khuda, had been rewarded with provinces for their faithful service to the Abbasid caliph al-Mamun: Nuh obtained Samarkand; Ahmad, Fergana; Yahya, Shash; and Elyas, Herat. Ahmad&#x27;s son Nasr became governor of Transoxania in 875, but it was his brother and successor, Ismail Samani who overthrew the Saffarids and the Zaydites of Tabaristan, thus establishing a semiautonomous rule over Transoxania and Khorasan, with Bukhara as his capital.

Samanid rule in Bukhara was not formally recognized by the caliph until the early 10th century when the Saffarid ruler &#x27;Amr-i Laith had asked the caliph for the investiture of Transoxiana. The caliph, Al-Mu&#x27;tadid however sent the Samanid amir, Ismail Samani, a letter urging him to fight Amr-i Laith and the Saffarids whom the caliph considered usurpers. According to the letter, the caliph stated that he prayed for Ismail who the caliph considered as the rightful ruler of Khorasan. The letter had a profound effect on Ismail, as he was determined to oppose the Saffarids.

Since the 9th century, the Turkization of the population of the Central Asian interfluve has been increasing. At this time, a military system was created, in which the influence of the Turkic military was strong.

In the 9th century, the continued influx of nomads from the northern steppes brought a new group of people into Central Asia. These people were the Turks who lived in the great grasslands stretching from Mongolia to the Caspian Sea. Introduced mainly as slave soldiers to the Samanid dynasty, these Turks served in the armies of all the states of the region, including the Abbasid army. In the late 10th century, as the Samanids began to lose control of Transoxiana (Mawarannahr) and northeastern Iran, some of these soldiers came to positions of power in the government of the region, and eventually established their own states, albeit highly Persianized. With the emergence of a Turkic ruling group in the region, other Turkic tribes began to migrate to Transoxiana.

The first of the Turkic states in the region was the Persianate Ghaznavid Empire, established in the last years of the 10th century. The Ghaznavid state, which captured Samanid domains south of the Amu Darya, was able to conquer large areas of Iran, Afghanistan, and northern India apart from Central Asia, during the reign of Sultan Mahmud. The Ghaznavids were closely followed by the Turkic Qarakhanids, who took the Samanid capital Bukhara in 999 AD, and ruled Transoxiana for the next two centuries. Samarkand was made the capital of the Western Qarakhanid state.

According to Peter Golden, the Karakhanid state was one of the first Turkic-Islamic states. The Islamization of the Karakhanids and their Turkic subjects played an important role in the cultural development of the Turkic culture. In the late 10th–early 11th century for the first time in the history of the Turkic peoples, Tafsir (commentary on the Koran) was translated into the Turkic language.

The founder of the Western Karakhanid Kaganate, Ibrahim Tamgach Khan (1040–1068), for the first time erected a madrasah in Samarkand with state funds and supported the development of culture in the region. One of the famous scholars was the historian Majid ad-din al-Surkhakati, who in Samarkand wrote the &quot;History of Turkestan&quot;, which outlined the history of the Karakhanid dynasty.

The most striking monument of the Karakhanid era in Samarkand was the palace of Ibrahim ibn Hussein (1178–1202), which was built in the citadel in the 12th century, where fragments of monumental painting depicting a Turkic ruler were discovered.

The dominance of Ghazna was curtailed, however, when the Seljuks led themselves into the western part of the region, conquering the Ghaznavid territory of Khorazm (also spelled Khorezm and Khwarazm). The Seljuks also defeated the Qarakhanids, but did not annex their territories outright. Instead they made the Qarakhanids a vassal state. The Seljuks dominated a wide area from Asia Minor to the western sections of Transoxiana in the 11th century. The Seljuk Empire then split into states ruled by various local Turkic and Iranian rulers. The culture and intellectual life of the region continued unaffected by such political changes, however. Turkic tribes from the north continued to migrate into the region during this period. The power of the Seljuks however became diminished when the Seljuk Sultan Ahmed Sanjar was defeated by the Kara-Khitans at the Battle of Qatwan in 1141.

Turkic words and terms characteristic of the literature of the 11th century are used in the modern Bukhara dialect of the Uzbeks.

In the late 12th century, a Turkic leader of Khorazm, which is the region south of the Aral Sea, united Khorazm, Transoxiana, and Iran under his rule. Under the rule of the Khorazm shah Kutbeddin Muhammad and his son, Muhammad II, Transoxiana continued to be prosperous and rich while maintaining the region&#x27;s Perso-Islamic identity. However, a new incursion of nomads from the north soon changed this situation. This time the invader was Genghis Khan with his Mongol armies.

=== Mongol period ===
The Mongol invasion of Central Asia is one of the turning points in the history of the region. The Mongols had such a lasting impact because they established the tradition that the legitimate ruler of any Central Asian state could only be a blood descendant of Genghis Khan.

The Mongol conquest of Central Asia, which took place from 1219 to 1225, led to a wholesale change in the population of Mawarannahr. The conquest quickened the process of Turkification in some parts of the region because, although the armies of Genghis Khan were led by Mongols, they were made up mostly of Turkic tribes that had been incorporated into the Mongol armies as the tribes were encountered in the Mongols&#x27; southward sweep. As these armies settled in Mawarannahr, they intermixed with the local populations which did not flee. Another effect of the Mongol conquest was the large-scale damage the soldiers inflicted on cities such as Bukhara and on regions such as Khorazm. As the leading province of a wealthy state, Khorazm was treated especially severely. The irrigation networks in the region suffered extensive damage that was not repaired for several generations. Many Iranian-speaking populations were forced to flee southwards in order to avoid persecution.

Following the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, his empire was divided among his four sons and his family members. Despite the potential for serious fragmentation, Mongol law of the Mongol Empire maintained orderly succession for several more generations, and control of most of Mawarannahr stayed in the hands of direct descendants of Chaghatai, the second son of Genghis. Orderly succession, prosperity, and internal peace prevailed in the Chaghatai lands, and the Mongol Empire as a whole remained strong and united.

=== Rule of Timur and Timurids ===
In the early 14th century, however, as the empire began to break up into its constituent parts, the Chaghatai territory also was disrupted as the princes of various tribal groups competed for influence. One tribal chieftain, Timur (Tamerlane), emerged from these struggles in the 1380s as the dominant force in Mawarannahr. Although he was not a descendant of Genghis, Timur became the de facto ruler of Mawarannahr and proceeded to conquer all of western Central Asia, Iran, the Caucasus, Asia Minor, and the southern steppe region north of the Aral Sea. He also invaded Russia before dying during an invasion of China in 1405.

Timur initiated the last flowering of Mawarannahr by gathering in his capital, Samarkand, numerous artisans and scholars from the lands he had conquered. By supporting such people, Timur imbued his empire with a very rich Perso-Islamic culture. During Timur&#x27;s reign and the reigns of his immediate descendants, a wide range of religious and palatial construction projects were undertaken in Samarkand and other population centers. Timur also patronized scientists and artists; his grandson Ulugh Beg was one of the world&#x27;s first great astronomers. It was during the Timurid dynasty that Turkic, in the form of the Chaghatai dialect, became a literary language in its own right in Mawarannahr, although the Timurids were Persianate in nature. The greatest Chaghataid writer, Ali Shir Nava&#x27;i, was active in the city of Herat, now in northwestern Afghanistan, in the second half of the 15th century.

The Timurids supported the development of literature in the Turkic language. In 1398, Timur&#x27;s son Miranshah ordered to draw up an official document in the Turkic language in the Uyghur script.

Timur&#x27;s grandson Iskandar Sultan had a court that included a group of poets, for example, Mir Khaidar, whom Iskandar encouraged to write poetry in the Turkic language. Thanks to the patronage of Iskandar Sultan, the Turkic poem &quot;Gul and Navruz&quot; was written.

The Timurid state quickly broke into two halves after the death of Timur. The chronic internal fighting of the Timurids attracted the attention of the Eastern Kipchak-speaking nomadic tribes called Taza Uzbeks who were living to the north of the Aral Sea. In 1501, the Uzbeks began a wholesale invasion of Mawarannahr. Under the leadership of Muhammad Shaybani, the Uzbeks conquered the key cities of Samarkand and Herat in 1505 and 1507, respectively, and founded the Khanate of Bukhara.

=== Uzbek period ===

By 1510, the Uzbeks had completed their conquest of Central Asia, including the territory of the present-day Uzbekistan. Of the states they established, the most powerful, the Khanate of Bukhara, centered on the city of Bukhara. The khanate controlled Mawarannahr, especially the region of Tashkent, the Fergana Valley in the east, and northern Afghanistan. A second Uzbek state, the Khanate of Khiva was established in the oasis of Khorazm at the mouth of the Amu Darya. The Khanate of Bukhara was initially led by the energetic Shaybanid dynasty, the successors of Muhammad Shaybani. The Shaybanids initially competed against Iran for a few years, which was led by the Safavid dynasty, for the rich far-eastern territory of present-day Iran. The struggle with the Safavids also had a religious aspect, because the Uzbeks were Sunni Muslims while Iran was Shia.

Shaybani Khan wrote poetry under the pseudonym &quot;Shibani&quot;. A collection of poems by Shaybani Khan, written in the Central Asian Turkic literary language, is currently kept in the Topkapi manuscript collection in Istanbul. The manuscript of his philosophical and religious work: &quot;Bahr ul-Khudo&quot;, written in the Central Asian Turkic literary language in 1508, is located in London.

Shaybani-khan&#x27;s nephew Ubaydulla Khan was a very educated person, he skillfully recited the Koran and provided it with commentaries in the Turkic language. Ubaydulla himself wrote poetry in Turkic, Persian and Arabic under the literary pseudonym Ubaydiy. A collection of his poems has reached us.

The term &quot;92 Uzbek tribes&quot;, which appeared in the fifteenth-century Dasht-i Qipchaq, began to be used with a variety of meanings in the following centuries depending on the political and cultural context. Near the end of the 16th century, the Uzbek states of Bukhara and Khorazm began to weaken because of their endless wars against each other and the Persians and because of strong competition for the throne among the khans in power and their heirs. At the beginning of the 17th century, the Shaybanid dynasty was replaced by the Janid dynasty.

Another factor contributing to the weakness of the Uzbek khanates in this period was the general decline of trade moving through the region. This change had begun in the previous century when ocean trade routes were established from Europe to India and China, circumventing the Silk Route. As European-dominated ocean transport expanded and some trading centers were destroyed, cities such as Bukhara, Merv, and Samarkand in the Khanate of Bukhora and Khiva and Urganch (Urgench) in Khorazm began to steadily decline.

The Uzbeks&#x27; struggle with Iran also led to the cultural isolation of Central Asia from the rest of the Islamic world. In addition to these problems, the struggle with the nomads from the northern steppe continued. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Kazakh nomads and Mongols continually raided the Uzbek khanates, causing widespread damage and disruption. In the beginning of the 18th century, the Khanate of Bukhara lost the fertile Fergana region, and a new Uzbek khanate was formed in Quqon.

=== Afghan Pashtun conquest ===

An Uzbek Khanate existed in Maimana. The Pashtuns battled and conquered the Uzbeks and forced them into a state of subjugation and discrimination. Out of anti-Russian strategic interests, the British assisted the Afghan conquest of the Uzbek Khanates. The British gave weapons to the Afghans and backed the Afghan colonization of northern Afghanistan, which involved sending a huge number of Pashtun colonists onto Uzbek land. Furthermore, British literature from the period demonized the Uzbeks. Soviet-era arrivals in Afghanistan from Uzbekistan are referred to as Jogi.

=== Russo-Soviet era ===
==== Russian Empire ====

In the 19th century, Russian interest in the area increased greatly, sparked by nominal concern over British designs on Central Asia; by anger over the situation of Russian citizens held as slaves; and by the desire to control the trade in the region and to establish a secure source of cotton for Russia. When the United States Civil War prevented cotton delivery from Russia&#x27;s primary supplier, the southern United States, Central Asian cotton assumed much greater importance for Russia.

As soon as the Russian conquest of the Caucasus was completed in the late 1850s, the Russian Ministry of War began to send military forces against the Central Asian khanates. Three major population centers of the khanates—Tashkent, Bukhara, and Samarkand—were captured in 1865, 1867, and 1868, respectively. In 1868 the Khanate of Bukhara signed a treaty with Russia making Bukhara a Russian protectorate. Khiva became a Russian protectorate in 1873, and the Khanat of Kokand finally was incorporated into the Russian Empire, also as a protectorate, in 1876.

By 1876, Russia had incorporated all three khanates (hence all of present-day Uzbekistan) into its empire, granting the khanates limited autonomy. In the second half of the 19th century, the Russian population of Uzbekistan grew and some industrialization occurred. The Jadidists engaged in educational reform among Muslims of Central Asia. To escape Russians slaughtering them in 1916, Uzbeks escaped to China.
==== Soviet Union ====

In the 1940s, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. In response, many Central Asians, including Uzbeks or Samarkandites, were sent to fight the Germans in the area of Smolensk. However, a number of them, including Hatam Kadirov and Zair Muratov, were captured, transported to the Netherlands, where they were abused and killed. Their bodies were buried in Rusthof cemetery near Amersfoort. For some time, these 101 victims were not identified, apart from the fact that they were Soviets, until an investigation by journalist Remco Reiding. Their plight was also studied by Uzbek historian Bahodir Uzakov of Gouda, South Holland. Witness Henk Broekhuizen said that, despite having seeing them once as a teenager, he would recall the soldiers&#x27; faces, whenever he closed his eyes.

Moscow&#x27;s control over Uzbekistan weakened in the 1970s as Uzbek party leader Sharaf Rashidov brought many cronies and relatives into positions of power. In the mid-1980s, Moscow attempted to regain control by again purging the entire Uzbek party leadership. However, this move increased , which had long resented Soviet policies such as the imposition of cotton monoculture and the suppression of Islamic traditions. In the late 1980s, the liberalized atmosphere of the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev (in power 1985–91) fostered political opposition groups and open (albeit limited) opposition to Soviet policy in Uzbekistan. In 1989, a series of violent ethnic clashes, involving Uzbeks, brought the appointment of ethnic Uzbek outsider Islam Karimov as Communist Party chief.

=== Post-Soviet era ===

When the Supreme Soviet of Uzbekistan reluctantly approved independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Karimov became president of the Republic of Uzbekistan. On August 31, 1991, Uzbekistan declared independence, marking September 1 as a national holiday.

== Uzbek diaspora ==

Dissident Islamist and anti-Soviet Central Asians fled to Afghanistan, British India, and to the Hijaz in Saudi Arabia. The last Emir of Bukhara Mohammed Alim Khan fled to Afghanistan. The Islamist Uzbek As-Sayyid Qāsim bin Abd al-Jabbaar Al-Andijaani (Arabic: السيد قاسم بن عبد الجبار الأنديجاني) was born in Fergana valley&#x27;s Andijan city in Turkestan (Central Asia). He went to British India was educated at Darul Uloom Deoband, and then returned to Turkestan where he preached against Communist Russian rule. He then fled to Afghanistan, then to British India and then to Hijaz where he continued his education in Mecca and Medina and wrote several works on Islam and engaged in anti-Soviet activities.

In the recent times, many Uzbeks started to migrate to various countries as labour migrants, especially to Russia, South Korea, the UAE, Germany, Poland, Saudi Arabia, etc.

=== Kyrgyzstan ===
Uzbeks in Kyrgyzstan are an ethnic group native to Kyrgyzstan. In Kyrgyzstan, Uzbeks are the largest minority group, comprising about 15% of the population. They have a long history in the region and have played a significant role in the culture and economy of Kyrgyzstan. Many Uzbeks in Kyrgyzstan live in the southern part of the country, particularly in the cities of Osh, Jalal-Abad and Özgön.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
Uzbek exiles in Saudi Arabia from Soviet ruled Central Asia also adopted the identity &quot;Turkistani&quot;. A lot of them are also called &quot;Bukhari&quot;. A number of Saudi &quot;Uzbeks&quot; do not consider themselves as Uzbek and instead consider themselves as Muslim Turkestanis. Many Uzbeks in Saudi Arabia adopted the Arabic nisba of their home city in Uzbekistan, such as Al Bukhari from Bukhara, Al Samarqandi from Samarkand, Al Tashkandi from Tashkent, Al Andijani from Andijan, Al Kokandi from Kokand, Al Turkistani from Turkistan. Bukhari and Turkistani were labels for all the Uzbeks in general while specific names for Uzbeks from different places were Farghani, Marghilani, Namangani, and Kokandi. Kokandi was used to refer to Uzbeks from Ferghana.

Shami Domullah introduced Salafism to Soviet Central Asia. Mosques in Uzbekistan are funded by Saudi-based Uzbeks. Saudis have tried to propagate their version of Islam into Uzbekistan following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Saudi Arabia&#x27;s &quot;Bukharian brethren&quot; were led by Nuriddin al-Bukhari as of 1990. Official figures have placed anywhere between 400 thousand to 800 thousand Uzbeks in Saudi Arabia.

=== Pakistan ===
Many ethnic Uzbeks moved from Afghanistan to Pakistan owing to the Afghan War. Due to aid requirements for refugees, repatriation of camp dwellers took place. In the 1800s, Konya&#x27;s north Bogrudelik was settled by Tatar Bukharlyks. In 1981, many Uzbek refugees in Pakistan moved to Turkey to join the existing Kayseri, İzmir, Ankara, and Zeytinburnu-based communities.

== Culture and society ==

=== Uzbek tribes ===
Uzbeks are said to have included 92 tribes in their orbit: Manghut, Qiyat, Qipchaq, Khitai, Qanghli, Kenigas, Durman, Darghut, Shoran, Shurin, Toma, Bahrin, Giray, Aghrikur, Anghit, Barkut, Tubin, Sart, Romdan, Matin, Busa, Yojqar, Qilwa, Dojar, Jurat, Qurlat, Mehdi, Kilaj, Sakhtiyon, Qirgh, Ming, Yuz, Salor, Loqai, Qushchi, Kerait, Chaqmok, Utarchi, Turcoman, Arlot, Kait, Qirghuz, Qalon, Ushin, Ormaq, Chubi, Lechi, Qari, Moghol, Hafiz dad Kaln, Belad Bustan, Quchi, Qataghan, Barlas, Yabu, Jalair, Musit, Naiman, Semarjiq, Qarluq, Arghun, Oklan, Qalmaq, Fuladchi, Jalot Uljin or Olchin, Chimbay, Tilab, Machar or Majar, Ojinbai, Badai, Kelchi, Ilaj, Jebirgan, Botiya, Timan, Yankuz, Tatar, Uighur, Baghlan or Baghan, Danghut, Manghut, Shagird, Pesha, Tushlub, Onli, Biyat, Ozlaji, Joslayi, Tuwadiq, and Ghariband Jit. For the semi-nomadic tribes of these khanates, belonging to the &quot;92 tribes&quot; meant in certain cases a privileged position and a higher socio-economic status. In certain cases, the term &quot;92 Uzbek tribes&quot; was used with a political meaning to legitimize the ruling Uzbek dynasties of the Manghyts and Mings.
=== Language ===
The Uzbek language is a Turkic language of the Karluk branch. Modern Uzbek is written in wide variety of scripts including Arabic, Latin, and Cyrillic. After the independence of Uzbekistan from the former Soviet Union, the government decided to replace the Cyrillic script with a modified Latin alphabet, specifically for Turkic languages. Historically, the nomadic Uzbeks who founded the Uzbek Khanate and its other successor states spoke various dialects of Turkic language.

===Religion===
Uzbeks come from a predominantly Sunni Muslim background, usually of the Hanafi school, but variations exist between northern and southern Uzbeks. According to a 2009 Pew Research Center report, Uzbekistan&#x27;s population is 96.3% Muslim, around 54% identifies as non-denominational Muslim, 18% as Sunni and 1% as Shia. And around 11% say they belong to a Sufi order. The majority of Uzbeks from the former USSR came to practice religion with a more liberal interpretation due to the movement of Jadidism which arose as an indigenous reform movement during the time of Russian imperial rule, while Uzbeks in Afghanistan and other countries to the south have remained more conservative adherents of Islam. However, with Uzbek independence in 1991 came an Islamic revival amongst segments of the population. People living in the area of modern Uzbekistan were first converted to Islam as early as the 8th century, as Arabs conquered the area, displacing the earlier faiths of the region.

A 2015 study estimates some 10,000 Muslim Uzbek converted to Christianity, most of them belonging to some sort of evangelical or charismatic Protestant community. According to 2009 national census 1,794 Uzbeks in Kazakhstan are Christians. In Russia there are some long-term Uzbek workers who have converted to Eastern Orthodoxy through missionaries.

The ancient pre-Islamic religion of Uzbekistan-Zoroastrianism survives today and is followed by 7,000 people in Uzbekistan. According to 2009 national census 1,673 Uzbeks in Kazakhstan are atheists.

===Attire===

====Male clothing====

Uzbek clothing includes a loose-fitting cotton coat, called Chapan or Kaftan, which is usually made from a variety of colorful stripes, or other types of patterns. The &quot;chapan &quot; is usually of knee length, and includes different elements in various regions of the country. The botton of the sleeves, center edges, hem and neckline of the coat ate sown with a decorative braid, which was believed to protect from &quot;evil powers&quot;.
In the past, wearing two or more coats at the same time, both in winter and summer, was seen as a status symbol, and indicated a certain level of prestige for the family.

The coat, or the shirt worn underneath, is tied with a folded handlerchief or a band &quot;belbog&quot;. The band is viewed as an important accessory, and can be made of fine fabrics and silks, decorated with intricate silver embroidery, and fitted with little bags for tobacco and keys. Traditionally, a hand crafted knife is placed in the band, known as &quot;pichoq&quot;, Chust made knives are famous in particular.

Shirts are white and wide, made of cotton, and usually worn underneath the coat. Some of them have patterns on the sleeves and the neckline, called &quot;jiyak&quot;. Pants, also known as &quot;ishton&quot;, are loosely cut, but narrow to the bottom, and are tucked into soft leather boots with pointed toes, for the ease of horse riding.

====Female clothing====

The female version of the attire consists of a traditional robe, functional dress made of satin, and &quot;lozim&quot; – wide, light, light trousers narrowing in the lower parts. The long, loose tunic has wide sleeves, reaching down to the wrists. The loose-cut pants, are made to match the tunic, and thus are usually made of the same fabric, or one completely to the tunic. The bottom of the pants is gathered and decorated with embroidered braid. The coats, are in many ways similar to the &quot;chapan&quot; worn by males, and are made of various fabrics, such as &quot;atlas&quot;, &quot;khan-atlas&quot;, &quot;bekasama&quot;, &quot;alacha&quot; and &quot;kalami&quot;. Textile patterns are brightly colored in the shades of yellow, blue, green, violet, and orange, and often include up to six or seven different colors in various floral and/or geometrical designs.

In the past, color of the costume was an important signal of a person&#x27;s age or social status. Notably, red and pink were common for girls and young women, whereas middle-aged women wore shades of light blue and gray. White however, was appropriate for all ages, especially the elderly, and is used widely to this day.

Before the Bolshevik Revolution and the subsequent establishment of communism in Central Asia, women wore traditional veils, known as &quot;parandga&quot;, on all occasions in public. The designs were varied, some adhering to one or two basic colors in their designs, while others included colored floral or geometrical elements, with the face-lid, usually being made of black fabric. The face-lid could be lifted back, for ease of communication.

However, after the establishment of communism, a movement to liberate women from the &quot;patrarchal&quot; and &quot;outdated&quot; practice of wearing veils, known as Hujum, gained track, and in the 20s and early 30s, public abandonments and burnings of veiles were encouraged. The result was a conservative pushback, however in the following years, with the increased participation of women in the workplace, and their gradual liberation, veils were phased out of the common use by women throughout the country.

====Headgear====
The square skullcap, known as &quot;do&#x27;ppi&quot; in Uzbek and Tyubeteika in Russian, is worn by both males and females. They are made of either velvet or wool and embroidered with silk or silver threads. The design varies for males and females, with the variant worn by females, being more colorful and decorated with beads, while the male variant is usually black with four arches of pepper, which are believed to keep &quot;evil and enemies&quot; abay. The exception to this are the southern regions of Uzbekistan, where a more round and colorful cap is worn by both males and females. In the western region of Khorezm and in the Autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan, men, also wear a traditional fur hat, made out of sheepskin in predominantly white and black colors.

<text>The University of Canterbury (UC; ; postnominal abbreviation Cantuar. or Cant. for &quot;Cantuariensis&quot;, the Latin name for Canterbury) is a public research university based in Christchurch, New Zealand. It was founded in 1873 as Canterbury College, the first constituent college of the University of New Zealand. It is New Zealand&#x27;s second-oldest university, after the University of Otago, which was founded four years earlier, in 1869.

Its original campus was in the Christchurch Central City, but in 1961 it became an independent university and began moving out of its original neo-Gothic buildings, which were re-purposed as the Christchurch Arts Centre. The move was completed on 1 May 1975 and the university now operates its main campus in the Christchurch suburb of Ilam.

The university also offers bachelors degrees in, among others, Arts, Commerce, Education (physical education), Fine Arts, Forestry, Health Sciences, Law, Criminal Justice, Music, Social Work, Speech and Language Pathology, Sports Coaching and Teaching.

==History==

===Canterbury College, 1873–1960===
On 16 June 1873, the university was founded in the centre of Christchurch as Canterbury College, the first constituent college of the University of New Zealand and was funded by the then Canterbury Provincial Council. It became the second institution in New Zealand providing tertiary-level education (following the University of Otago, established in 1869), and the fourth in Australasia. It was founded on the basis of the Oxbridge college system, but it differed from Oxbridge in that it admitted female students from its foundation. Its foundation professors arrived in 1874, namely, Charles Cook (Mathematics, University of Melbourne, St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge), Alexander Bickerton (Chemistry and Physics, School of Mining, London), and John Macmillan Brown (University of Glasgow, Balliol College, Oxford). A year later the first lectures began and in 1875 the first graduations took place. In 1880, Helen Connon was the first woman to graduate from the college, and in 1894, Āpirana Ngata became the first Māori-born student to graduate with a degree. The School of Art was founded in 1882, followed by the faculties of Arts, Science, Commerce, and Law in 1921, and Mental, Moral, and Social Sciences in 1924. The Students&#x27; Union, now known as the University of Canterbury Students Association, was founded in 1929 operating out of the Arts Centre of Christchurch Old Student Union Building, and the first edition of the student magazine &quot;Canta&quot; was published in 1930. In 1933, the name changed from Canterbury College to Canterbury University College.

College House, a student dormitory that maintains its old tradition by adopting the Oxbridge college system, broke away from Christ&#x27;s College in 1957 and relocated to the Ilam suburb of Christchurch in 1966 as a hall of residence at the University of Canterbury. In 1957 the name changed again to the University of Canterbury.

===Independence, 1961–2009===
Until 1961, the university formed part of the University of New Zealand (UNZ), and issued degrees in its name. That year saw the dissolution of the federal system of tertiary education in New Zealand, and the University of Canterbury became an independent University awarding its own degrees. Upon the UNZ&#x27;s demise, Canterbury Agricultural College became a constituent college of the University of Canterbury, as &quot;Lincoln College&quot;. Lincoln College became independent in 1990 as a full university in its own right and is now known as Lincoln University.
Relocation to Ilam campus

Over the period from 1961 to 1974, the university campus relocated from the centre of the city to its much larger current site in the suburb of Ilam. 1973 saw the university celebrate its centenary, during which the neo-Gothic buildings of the old campus were gifted to the City of Christchurch, which became the site of the Christchurch Arts Centre, a hub for arts, crafts and entertainment in Christchurch. 1974 also marked the opening of the James Hight Library, which at the time, was New Zealand&#x27;s largest university building. Ilam&#x27;s three university halls of residence were renamed University Hall in 1974, and the student dormitory was used as the Athletes Village dormitory for the 1974 British Commonwealth Games hosted in Christchurch.

In 2004, the university underwent restructuring into four Colleges and a School of Law, administering a number of schools and departments (though a number of departments have involvement in cross-teaching in numerous academic faculties). For many years the university worked closely with the Christchurch College of Education, leading to a full merger in 2007, establishing a fifth College.

===Post-earthquakes, 2010–2022===

On 4 September 2010 at 4:35 am local time an earthquake struck the South Island of New Zealand with a moment magnitude of 7.1 several aftershocks followed the main event, the strongest of which was a magnitude 6.3 shock known as the Christchurch earthquake that occurred nearly six months later on 22 February 2011. Although there was no serious injuries to staff or students on campus and only minor damage to buildings, the initial quake closed the university for a week, and the library was shut for months while shelves were repaired and half a million books placed back on shelves. The Student Volunteer Army was a group of around 10,000 university students and others who worked over a period of months to help clean up liquefaction.

In the months following the earthquake, the university lost 25 per cent of its first-year students and 8 per cent of continuing students. The number of international students, who pay much higher fees and were a major source of revenue, dropped by 30 per cent. In October 2011, staff were encouraged to take voluntary redundancies. As well in September 2011, plans were announced to demolish some University buildings that were damaged from an earthquake. 

By 2013, the university had lost 22 per cent of its students. However, a record number of 886 PhD students were enrolled at the University of Canterbury as of 2013. Other New Zealand universities, apparently defying an informal agreement, launched billboard and print advertising campaigns in the earthquake-ravaged city to recruit University of Canterbury students who were finding it difficult to study there. In 2013 the New Zealand Government also agreed to provide $260m to support the university&#x27;s rebuild programme.

Student numbers were steadily on the rise, with a 4.5% increase in students enrolled from 2013 to 2016. International numbers also increased, nearing pre-earthquake figures at 1,134 enrolled in 2016.

In March 2016, Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr said in &quot;The Press&quot; newspaper: &quot;In 2014, [students] wanted to leave Christchurch and went to Wellington, Otago and into the workforce. Now we&#x27;re retaining Christchurch school leavers and we&#x27;re getting our fair share of provincial students, as well as attracting greater numbers from the Auckland region.&quot; &quot;Living on or near the UC campus, and having a lifestyle that can take you from lectures to skifields in 90 minutes or the beach in 20 minutes, is much more appealing and affordable than living in Auckland.&quot;

In January 2017, the University of Canterbury released its campus master plan – 50 building and landscape projects proposed over three stages by 2045, the cost could exceed $2bn. In a comment to &quot;The Press&quot;, Rod Carr said that the plans were proof the university was moving away from the falling enrolments post-earthquake.
===150th anniversary, 2023–present===

The University of Canterbury celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2023. In the same year the University experienced a surge in enrolments, reaching a record high of 21,361 students by late March, compared to 20,223 at the same period in the previous year. Among these figures, UC counted 19,975 domestic students, witnessing a substantial increase from the preceding year&#x27;s count. Concurrently, the international student body also expanded to 1,393, marking a rise from 1,098 in the prior year. This growth in enrolment stands in contrast to a decline in domestic student numbers across all five North Island universities during this period. According to a spokesperson for the University, in 2023 every affiliated hall was &quot;at 100% occupancy&quot; and &quot;may be a record-breaker for highest number of enrolments&quot;.

==Campuses==

The University of Canterbury has three campuses spread throughout the city of Christchurch:

*Ilam Campus: The university has a main campus of at Ilam, a suburb of Christchurch about from the centre of the city. The Ilam campus maintains three libraries with the Central Library () housed in the tallest building on campus, the 11-storey Puaka–James Hight Building. The Ilam campus is where the Faculties of Education, Health, Science, Engineering, Business, Law and Arts are based. The University of Canterbury Students&#x27; Association is based there in the Haere roa building. The Ilam Campus is home to cafes and restaurants as well as a pharmacy, bookshop, the UC rec centre and the UC Health centre.
*Dovedale Campus: The Dovedale Campus is and became a part of the University of Canterbury when the Christchurch College of Education (a specialist teacher training institution) merged on 1 January 2007. The Dovedale campus is located adjacent to the Ilam campus and is off Dovedale avenue. The campus consists of the old Henry Field Library, The Christchurch College of English, Ilam early Learning Centre and Hayashi and Sonoda student residences. The Faculty of Education also maintains a presence here.
*City Campus: The Christchurch City Campus is made up of the Christchurch Arts Centre and the Manawa building which is a part of the Faculty of Health. Music and classics are again taught from the Christchurch Arts Centre in the old chemistry building, and within the new Manawa building in Christchurch city health and education are taught. The city campus also includes the Teece Museum of Classical Antiquities – home of the James Logie Memorial Collection.

The university also maintains additional small campuses in Nelson, Tauranga and Timaru, and teaching centres in Greymouth, New Plymouth, Rotorua and Timaru. The university has staff in regional information offices in Nelson, Timaru, and Auckland.

===Libraries===
The UC Library was first established at Canterbury College in 1879. Today there are three libraries on campus each covering different subject areas.

Central library


The Central Library () – is housed in the Puaka–James Hight Building that is designed in the brutalist style architecture. In 1974, the old city campus library moved to the Ilam campus and was housed in the newly constructed James Hight building, originally named after former Canterbury professor James Hight. The building was renamed Puaka-James Hight in 2014, after the brightest star in the cluster Matariki, to reflect the growing strength of UC&#x27;s relationship with Ngāi Tahu and the mana of Te Ao Māori at the heart of the university&#x27;s campus. The University of Canterbury Central Library is the largest university library in New Zealand. The Central Library has collections of over 2 million physical items including books, archives, journals and a miscellany of other items that support research and teaching in Humanities, Social Sciences, Law, Commerce, Music, Fine Arts and Antarctic Studies.

* The Henry Field Library (named for the New Zealand Educationalist Henry Edward Field) on the old Christchurch College of Education site joined the fold when the university and Christchurch College of Education merged. However, the Education collection was incorporated into the collections within the Puaka–James Hight Building, and Henry Field is now a library store at the campus off Dovedale Avenue.
* A separate Law library was established within the James Hight building, it was then relocated to the new Law building (Mere Mere). However, after the 2011 Christchurch earthquake it returned to the Puaka–James Hight Building and integrated into the Central Library collection. The Mere Mere Building still operates as the Law and Business Building however it is no longer home to the law library.

EPS library

The EPS Library (Engineering and Physical Sciences Library, ) supports research and teaching in Engineering, Forestry and Sciences. With the move to the Ilam campus, the Library was split. First the Engineering Library, and later the Physical Sciences Library, moving to the new campus however the old Physical Sciences Library closed and its collections moved to the Engineering Library now called the EPS Library.

Macmillian Brown library

The Macmillan Brown Library () is a research library, archive, and art gallery that specialises in collecting items related to New Zealand and Pacific Islands history. It holds over 100,000 published items including books, audio-visual recordings, and various manuscripts, photographs, works of art, architectural drawings and ephemera. The Macmillan Brown Library&#x27;s art collection also has over 5,000 works, making it one of the largest collections in the Canterbury Region. Some notable items in its collections include copies of Māori Land Court Records, official and government documents from various Pacific Islands states, trade union records, and the personal papers of various Members of Parliament and government ministers. The library is named after John Macmillan Brown, a prominent Canterbury academic who helped found the library, allocated a large proportion of his fortune to the Macmillan Brown Library.
===Student accommodation===

The university has ten student residences throughout its Ilam and Dovedale campuses: five fully-catered halls of residence exclusively for first-year undergraduate students: Arcady, College House, Rochester and Rutherford, Tupuānuku and University Hall; and five other self-catered student accommodation houses which are home to both undergraduate and postgraduate students: Sonoda Christchurch Campus, Hayashi, Kirkwood Avenue, Waimairi Village and Ilam Apartments. The largest, Ilam Apartments, houses 831 students during the academic year. Some of the halls at UC have storied histories; Tupuānuku is named for the star of the same name that is connected to food grown in the ground in the cluster Matariki in Māori Mythology; Rochester and Rutherford is named for former alumni Ernest Rutherford and John Fisher Bishop of Rochester; while Arcady, previously Bishop Julius Hall, was founded by the first Archbishop of New Zealand, Churchill Julius; additionally, College House is the oldest residential college in New Zealand.

===Field facilities===
The University of Canterbury has the most field stations of any New Zealand university. The Field Facilities Centre administers four of these field stations: 
* Cass Field Station – Established in 1914 to give students and researchs access to montane grasslands, scrub, riverbed, scree, beech forest, swamp, bog, lake, stream and alpine habitats.
* Harihari Field Station – Access to native forests, streams.
* Westport Field Station – for study of the West Coast of New Zealand, particularly mining.
* Kaikōura Field Station – Kaikōura represents an important transition zone for flora and fauna, particularly in the marine environment, with Kowhai bush and associated rich bird life close by.

The university and its project partners also operate an additional field station in the Nigerian Montane Forests Project; this field station stands on the Ngel Nyaki forest edge in Nigeria.

The Department of Physical and Chemical Sciences runs its own field laboratories:
* Mount John University Observatory at Lake Tekapo for optical astronomical research
* Birdlings Flat radar facility
* Scott Base radar facility
* Cracroft Caverns ring laser facility
The Department of Physical and Chemical Sciences also has involvement in the Southern African Large Telescope and is a member of the IceCube collaboration which is installing a neutrino telescope at the South Pole.

===Teece museum of classical antiquities===

The University of Canterbury Teece Museum of Classical Antiquities opened in May 2017, and showcases the James Logie Memorial Collection, a collection of Greek, Roman, Egyptian and Near Eastern artefacts in New Zealand. The Teece Museum is run as a part of the faculty of Arts. The museum is named for University of Canterbury Alumni Professor David Teece and his wife Leigh Teece, who donated a substantial amount of money to the city for earthquake recovery. The money was used by the university to install the classics and music school in the Old Chemistry building at the Christchurch Arts Centre.

The James Logie Memorial Collection was established in 1957 as a result of Miss Marion Steven, a Classics faculty member, donating Greek pottery to Canterbury University College. Steven established the James Logie Memorial Collection to honour her husband, who served as registrar of the college from 1950 until his death in 1956.

The Logie Collection includes a wide range of pottery, beginning with the Bronze Age cultures of Cyprus, Crete and Mycenae it also includes vases that come from Corinth and Athens, the islands in the Aegean, East Greece and the Greek colonies in South Italy and Sicily.

==Organisation and administration==
===Governance===
The university was first governed by a board of governors (1873–1933), then by a college council (1933–1957), and since 1957 by a university council. The council is chaired by a chancellor. The Council includes representatives from the faculties, students and general staff, as well as local industry, employer and trade union representatives.

The original composition of the board of governors was defined in the Canterbury College Ordinance 1873, which was passed by the Canterbury Provincial Council and named 23 members who might serve for life. Initially, the board was given power to fill their own vacancies, and this power transferred to graduates once their number exceeded 30. At the time, there were discussions about the abolition of provincial government (which did happen in 1876), and the governance structure was set up to give board members &quot;prestige, power and permanence&quot;, and &quot;provincial authority and its membership and resources were safely perpetuated, beyond the reach of grasping hands in Wellington.&quot;Original members of the Board of Governors were: Charles Bowen, Rev James Buller, William Patten Cowlishaw, John Enys, Charles Fraser, George Gould Sr, Henry Barnes Gresson, William Habens, John Hall, Henry Harper, John Inglis, Walter Kennaway, Arthur C. Knight, Thomas William Maude, William Montgomery, Thomas Potts, William Rolleston, John Studholme, Henry Tancred, James Somerville Turnbull, Henry Richard Webb, Joshua Williams, and Rev William Wellington Willock.

Professor Roy Sharp assumed the position of Vice-Chancellor on 1 March 2003. In May 2008 he announced his imminent resignation from the position, following his acceptance of the chief executive position at the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) which he took up on 4 August 2008. The then current Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ian Town, assumed the role of acting Vice-Chancellor on 1 July 2008. On 15 October 2008 the university announced that Rod Carr, a former banker and the CEO of a local software company, would begin a five-year appointment as Vice-Chancellor on 1 February 2009.

Council member and former Pro-Chancellor, Rex Williams, became Chancellor in 2009. Council member John Wood became the new Pro-Chancellor. On 1 January 2012, Wood became Chancellor after Williams retired from the role. In 2019, a new Vice Chancellor, Cheryl de la Rey, was appointed from the University of Pretoria, and Susan McCormack took over as Chancellor.

Board of Governors, chair of the College Council, and chancellor

The following table lists those who have held the position of chair of the Board of Governors, chair of the College Council, and chancellor.
=== Coat of arms ===

An explanation of the arms appears on the university website , where it is explained that the fleece symbolises the pastoral, and the plough at the base the agricultural background of the province of Canterbury. The bishop&#x27;s pall and the cross flory represent Canterbury&#x27;s ecclesiastical connections, and the open book denotes scholarship.

As an institution of learning, the university&#x27;s coat of arms does not have a helmet, crest or mantling.

The university&#x27;s unofficial coat of arms was accompanied by the Latin motto:

Because of the land holdings with which the Provincial Government endowed the early University, this was appropriate. When the coat of arms was redesigned, the motto was removed and now the motto is only used unofficially.
==Academic profile==
The University of Canterbury offers 147 undergraduate majors and 61 graduate degrees.  For the 2020 academic year, the university granted 2,257 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 1,003 graduate degrees, and 384 honours degrees. To graduate with a full-time undergraduate degree in the usual three years, undergraduates normally take four courses per semester. In most majors, an honors degree requires advanced coursework and a thesis – this usually takes an extra year. However, some undergraduate degrees that are also professional degrees, such as the Bachelor of Laws (LLB), Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) and Bachelor of Forestry Science (BForSc), typically take four years.

===Size and composition===
According to the UC Annual Report, at 31 December 2019 the university has a total of 18,364 students (14,891 equivalent full-time students). 11,621 of these are undergraduates, and 1,869 are international students. UC has a total of 826 academic faculty staff.

Following the earthquakes, the number of students enrolled at UC fell from 18,783 during 2010 to 14,725 during 2014, though the number of new enrolments increased in 2014. In 2016 enrolled student numbers rose to 15,564. Enrolment as of 2020 has reached pre-earthquake levels with a 18,364 students enrolled at UC.

===Rankings===

In the 2017 Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), UC was dropped completely from the world&#x27;s top 500 universities. In the 2017 QS World University Rankings, UC was rated 214th overall in the world, and third highest among New Zealand universities. Its individual global faculty rankings for 2015/2016 were: 146th in Arts &amp; Humanities, 161st in Engineering &amp; IT, 211th in Natural Sciences, and 94th in Social Sciences and Management. By 2018, these faculty rankings had all fallen considerably, and as of the release of the 2019 world university rankings, the three major university ranking organisations, ARWU, QS and THE, had all placed UC squarely in the middle of the pack of NZ universities at fourth place overall out of eight institutions, and in one case just two numerical positions above NZ&#x27;s fifth-place university in the nation&#x27;s lower division. In the 2016–2017 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, UC was ranked in the world&#x27;s top 400 universities, up from being in just the world&#x27;s top 500 universities in 2015. By 2021, however, UC had fallen back into just the top 600. Similarly, ARWU dropped UC from the top 400 universities in 2018 to just the top 500 in 2019, where it has remained ever since.

The university was the first in New Zealand to be granted five stars by QS Stars. Unlike the QS World University rankings, QS Stars ratings are only given to universities that pay a fee; the programme is designed to give &quot;those institutions that are not highly ranked or do not appear in the rankings an opportunity to reach out to their prospect students, to stand out and to be recognised for their excellence.&quot;

==Student life==
===Students&#x27; association===
The University of Canterbury Students&#x27; Association (UCSA) operates out of the student union building named Haere-roa which serves as the main student activity centre. The original UCSA Building was damaged in the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes and was subsequently torn down, it was rebuilt and completed in 2019, it is located on the Ilam Campus. The building is home to two bars, &quot;the Foundry&quot; and &quot;Bentley&#x27;s&quot;. The Association also runs several cafes and restaurants around campus. Located in Haere-roa is the Ngaio Marsh Theatre, named for the former alumnus of the same name. Haere-roa hosts a number of student societies and organisation offices.

The university&#x27;s student population operates the main student magazine, &quot;Canta&quot;, established in 1930. There are 12 issues per year, which are distributed around the UC campus every second Monday during the academic year. The newspaper&#x27;s offices are in the Haere-roa building. Canterbury&#x27;s student population runs a radio station which began to broadcast and operate as RDU in 1976; it began FM frequency broadcasting in 1986. RDU acquired its present frequency of 98.5 in 2003.

===Clubs===
The university has over 140 academic, sporting, recreational and cultural societies and clubs. The most prominent of these include the Student Volunteer Army, the University of Canterbury Engineering Society (ENSOC), the University of Canterbury Law Society (LAWSOC), the University of Canterbury Commerce Society (UCOM) as well as the largest non-faculty clubs such as PongSoc (University of Canterbury Pong Society), Motosoc (Motorsports Society), Lads without Labels, CUBA (Canterbury University Boardriders&#x27; Association), CUTC (Tramping Club), UC Bike, Opsoc, The Gentlemen&#x27;s Club. CUSSC (Canterbury University Snow Sports Club, formerly the CU Ski Club prior to 1997) is the only university club in New Zealand to own a ski field lodge, located at Temple Basin Ski Field. The club runs many events to raise funds for maintenance of their lodge. The University of Canterbury Drama Society (Dramasoc) achieved fame for its 1942–1969 Shakespeare productions under Dame Ngaio Marsh, but regularly performs as an active student- and alumni-run arts fixture in the small Christchurch theatre-scene.

In 2011 the SVA was established in the aftermath of the Christchurch earthquakes. A student at the University of Canterbury, Sam Johnson, rallied fellow students to help support the clean-up from the devastation. The club has grown and today is the largest club at the University of Canterbury. In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the SVA supported the vulnerable with their shopping during the lockdown.

Lads without Labels is a not-for-profit charity dedicated to improving men&#x27;s mental health in and around campus. On 5–8 October 2021 Lads without labels started the Project 72 fundraiser, a 72-hour relay on the University of Canterbury campus, which raised $12,000 for men&#x27;s mental health; as well in 2021 Lads without labels organised a 24-hour backyard cricket marathon raising $45,000.

One major student tradition, the Undie 500, involved an annual car-rally from Christchurch to Dunedin run by ENSOC. The rules required only the use of a road-legal car costing under $500 with a sober driver. The 2007 event gained international news coverage (including on CNN and BBC World) when it ended in rioting in the student quarter of Dunedin and in North East Valley. ENSOC cancelled the planned 2008 event. The Undie 500 was replaced by the Roundie 500 in 2011. This event has the same principles but follows a route through rural Canterbury, returning to Christchurch the same day.

===Film===

* &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; (1994) Based on the Parker–Hulme murder case, Juliet Hulme (later known as Anne Perry) was the daughter of Henry Hulme, the rector of the University of Canterbury, and she and Pauline Parker murdered Honorah Parker, Pauline&#x27;s mother. During this period Juliet and her family lived on campus in the Ilam homestead (now the University of Canterbury Staff Club), where filming for the movie took place.

<doc id="32245" wikidata="Q1417809" url="?curid=32245" title="Universal property">
<text>In mathematics, more specifically in category theory, a universal property is a property that characterizes up to an isomorphism the result of some constructions. Thus, universal properties can be used for defining some objects independently from the method chosen for constructing them. For example, the definitions of the integers from the natural numbers, of the rational numbers from the integers, of the real numbers from the rational numbers, and of polynomial rings from the field of their coefficients can all be done in terms of universal properties. In particular, the concept of universal property allows a simple proof that all constructions of real numbers are equivalent: it suffices to prove that they satisfy the same universal property. 

Technically, a universal property is defined in terms of categories and functors by means of a universal morphism (see , below). Universal morphisms can also be thought more abstractly as initial or terminal objects of a comma category (see , below). 

Universal properties occur almost everywhere in mathematics, and the use of the concept allows the use of general properties of universal properties for easily proving some properties that would need boring verifications otherwise. For example, given a commutative ring , the field of fractions of the quotient ring of by a prime ideal can be identified with the residue field of the localization of at ; that is formula_1 (all these constructions can be defined by universal properties).

Other objects that can be defined by universal properties include: all free objects, direct products and direct sums, free groups, free lattices, Grothendieck group, completion of a metric space, completion of a ring, Dedekind–MacNeille completion, product topologies, Stone–Čech compactification, tensor products, inverse limit and direct limit, kernels and cokernels, quotient groups, quotient vector spaces, and other quotient spaces.

== Motivation ==

Before giving a formal definition of universal properties, we offer some motivation for studying such constructions.

* The concrete details of a given construction may be messy, but if the construction satisfies a universal property, one can forget all those details: all there is to know about the construction is already contained in the universal property. Proofs often become short and elegant if the universal property is used rather than the concrete details. For example, the tensor algebra of a vector space is slightly complicated to construct, but much easier to deal with by its universal property.
* Universal properties define objects uniquely up to a unique isomorphism. Therefore, one strategy to prove that two objects are isomorphic is to show that they satisfy the same universal property.
* Universal constructions are functorial in nature: if one can carry out the construction for every object in a category &quot;C&quot; then one obtains a functor on &quot;C&quot;. Furthermore, this functor is a right or left adjoint to the functor &quot;U&quot; used in the definition of the universal property.
* Universal properties occur everywhere in mathematics. By understanding their abstract properties, one obtains information about all these constructions and can avoid repeating the same analysis for each individual instance.

==Formal definition==
To understand the definition of a universal construction, it is important to look at examples. Universal constructions were not defined out of thin air, but were rather defined after mathematicians began noticing a pattern in many mathematical constructions (see Examples below). Hence, the definition may not make sense to one at first, but will become clear when one reconciles it with concrete examples.

Let formula_2 be a functor between categories formula_3 and formula_4. In what follows, let formula_5 be an object of formula_4, formula_7 and formula_8 be objects of formula_3, and formula_10 be a morphism in formula_3. 

Then, the functor formula_12 maps formula_7, formula_8 and formula_15 in formula_3 to formula_17, formula_18 and formula_19 in formula_4.

A universal morphism from formula_5 to formula_12 is a unique pair formula_23 in formula_4 which has the following property, commonly referred to as a universal property:

For any morphism of the form 
formula_25 in formula_4, there exists a &quot;unique&quot; morphism formula_10 in formula_3 such that the following diagram commutes:

We can dualize this categorical concept. A universal morphism from formula_12 to formula_5 is a unique pair formula_31 that satisfies the following universal property:

For any morphism of the form formula_32 in formula_4, there exists a &quot;unique&quot; morphism formula_34 in formula_3 such that the following diagram commutes:
Note that in each definition, the arrows are reversed. Both definitions are necessary to describe universal constructions which appear in mathematics; but they also arise due to the inherent duality present in category theory.
In either case, we say that the pair formula_36 which behaves as above satisfies a universal property.

==Connection with comma categories==
Universal morphisms can be described more concisely as initial and terminal objects in a comma category (i.e. one where morphisms are seen as objects in their own right).

Let formula_2 be a functor and formula_5 an object of formula_4. Then recall that the comma category formula_40 is the category where 
* Objects are pairs of the form formula_41, where formula_42 is an object in formula_3
* A morphism from formula_41 to formula_45 is given by a morphism formula_46 in formula_3 such that the diagram commutes:

Now suppose that the object formula_23 in formula_40 is initial. Then
for every object formula_50, there exists a unique morphism formula_10 such that the following diagram commutes. 
Note that the equality here simply means the diagrams are the same. Also note that the diagram on the right side of the equality is the exact same as the one offered in defining a universal morphism from formula_5 to formula_12. Therefore, we see that a universal morphism from formula_5 to formula_12 is equivalent to an initial object in the comma category formula_40.

Conversely, recall that the comma category formula_57 is the category where 
*Objects are pairs of the form formula_58 where formula_42 is an object in formula_3
*A morphism from formula_61 to formula_62 is given by a morphism formula_46 in formula_3 such that the diagram commutes:
Suppose formula_65 is a terminal object in formula_57. Then for every object formula_67, 
there exists a unique morphism formula_68 such that the following diagrams commute. 
The diagram on the right side of the equality is the same diagram pictured when defining a universal morphism from formula_12 to formula_5. Hence, a universal morphism from formula_12 to formula_5 corresponds with a terminal object in the comma category 
formula_57.

==Examples==

Below are a few examples, to highlight the general idea. The reader can construct numerous other examples by consulting the articles mentioned in the introduction.

===Tensor algebras===

Let formula_3 be the category of vector spaces formula_75-Vect over a field formula_75 and let formula_4 be the category of algebras formula_75-Alg over formula_75 (assumed to be unital and associative). Let
:formula_80 : formula_75-Alg → formula_75-Vect
be the forgetful functor which assigns to each algebra its underlying vector space.

Given any vector space formula_83 over formula_75 we can construct the tensor algebra formula_85. The tensor algebra is characterized by the fact:
:“Any linear map from formula_83 to an algebra formula_7 can be uniquely extended to an algebra homomorphism from formula_85 to formula_7.”
This statement is an initial property of the tensor algebra since it expresses the fact that the pair formula_90, where formula_91 is the inclusion map, is a universal morphism from the vector space formula_83 to the functor formula_80.

Since this construction works for any vector space formula_83, we conclude that formula_95 is a functor from formula_75-Vect to formula_75-Alg. This means that formula_95 is &quot;left adjoint&quot; to the forgetful functor formula_80 (see the section below on relation to adjoint functors).

===Products===

A categorical product can be characterized by a universal construction. For concreteness, one may consider the Cartesian product in Set, the direct product in Grp, or the product topology in Top, where products exist.

Let formula_5 and formula_101 be objects of a category formula_3 with finite products. The product of formula_5 and formula_101 is an object formula_5 × formula_101 together with two morphisms
:formula_107 : formula_108
:formula_109 : formula_110
such that for any other object formula_111 of formula_3 and morphisms formula_113 and formula_114 there exists a unique morphism formula_115 such that formula_116 and formula_117.

To understand this characterization as a universal property, take the category formula_4 to be the product category formula_119 and define the diagonal functor
: formula_120
by formula_121 and formula_122. Then formula_123 is a universal morphism from formula_124 to the object formula_125 of formula_119: if formula_127 is any morphism from formula_128 to formula_125, then it must equal
a morphism formula_130 from formula_131
to formula_132 followed by formula_133. As a commutative diagram:
For the example of the Cartesian product in Set, the morphism formula_133 comprises the two projections formula_135 and formula_136. Given any set formula_111 and functions formula_138 the unique map such that the required diagram commutes is given by formula_139.

===Limits and colimits===

Categorical products are a particular kind of limit in category theory. One can generalize the above example to arbitrary limits and colimits.

Let formula_140 and formula_3 be categories with formula_140 a small index category and let formula_143 be the corresponding functor category. The &quot;diagonal functor&quot;
:formula_144
is the functor that maps each object formula_145 in formula_3 to the constant functor formula_147 (i.e. formula_148 for each formula_5 in formula_140 and formula_151 for each formula_152 in formula_140) and each morphism formula_154 in formula_3 to the natural transformation formula_156 in formula_157 defined as, for every object formula_5 of formula_140, the component formula_160
at formula_5. In other words, the natural transformation is the one defined by having constant component formula_162 for every object of formula_140.

Given a functor formula_164 (thought of as an object in formula_143), the &quot;limit&quot; of formula_12, if it exists, is nothing but a universal morphism from formula_124 to formula_12. Dually, the &quot;colimit&quot; of formula_12 is a universal morphism from formula_12 to formula_124.

==Properties==

===Existence and uniqueness===

Defining a quantity does not guarantee its existence. Given a functor formula_2 and an object formula_5 of formula_4, 
there may or may not exist a universal morphism from formula_5 to formula_12. If, however, a universal morphism formula_36 does exist, then it is essentially unique. 
Specifically, it is unique up to a &quot;unique&quot; isomorphism: if formula_178 is another pair, then there exists a unique isomorphism 
formula_179 such that formula_180.
This is easily seen by substituting formula_181 in the definition of a universal morphism.

It is the pair formula_36 which is essentially unique in this fashion. The object formula_7 itself is only unique up to isomorphism. Indeed, if formula_36 is a universal morphism and formula_179 is any isomorphism then the pair formula_178, where formula_180 is also a universal morphism.

===Equivalent formulations===

The definition of a universal morphism can be rephrased in a variety of ways. Let formula_2 be a functor and let formula_5 be an object of formula_4. Then the following statements are equivalent:
* formula_36 is a universal morphism from formula_5 to formula_12
* formula_36 is an initial object of the comma category formula_40
* formula_196 is a representation of formula_197, where its components formula_198 are defined by

formula_199

for each object formula_42 in formula_201

The dual statements are also equivalent:
* formula_36 is a universal morphism from formula_12 to formula_5
* formula_36 is a terminal object of the comma category formula_57
* formula_207 is a representation of formula_208, where its components formula_209 are defined by

formula_210

for each object formula_42 in formula_201

===Relation to adjoint functors===

Suppose formula_213 is a universal morphism from formula_214 to formula_12 and formula_216 is a universal morphism from formula_217 to formula_12. 
By the universal property of universal morphisms, given any morphism formula_219 there exists a unique morphism formula_220 such that the following diagram commutes:
If &quot;every&quot; object formula_221 of formula_4 admits a universal morphism to formula_12, then the assignment formula_224 and formula_225 defines a functor formula_226. The maps formula_227 then define a natural transformation from formula_228 (the identity functor on formula_4) to formula_230. The functors formula_231 are then a pair of adjoint functors, with formula_232 left-adjoint to formula_12 and formula_12 right-adjoint to formula_232.

Similar statements apply to the dual situation of terminal morphisms from formula_12. If such morphisms exist for every formula_5 in formula_3 one obtains a functor formula_239 which is right-adjoint to formula_12 (so formula_12 is left-adjoint to formula_232).

Indeed, all pairs of adjoint functors arise from universal constructions in this manner. Let formula_12 and formula_232 be a pair of adjoint functors with unit formula_245 and co-unit formula_246 
(see the article on adjoint functors for the definitions). Then we have a universal morphism for each object in formula_3 and formula_4:
*For each object formula_5 in formula_3, formula_251 is a universal morphism from formula_5 to formula_232. That is, for all formula_254 there exists a unique formula_255 for which the following diagrams commute.
*For each object formula_101 in formula_4, formula_258 is a universal morphism from formula_12 to formula_101. That is, for all formula_255 there exists a unique formula_254 for which the following diagrams commute.

Universal constructions are more general than adjoint functor pairs: a universal construction is like an optimization problem; it gives rise to an adjoint pair if and only if this problem has a solution for every object of formula_3 (equivalently, every object of formula_4).

== History ==
Universal properties of various topological constructions were presented by Pierre Samuel in 1948. They were later used extensively by Bourbaki. The closely related concept of adjoint functors was introduced independently by Daniel Kan in 1958.

<doc id="32248" wikidata="Q1128796" url="?curid=32248" title="Uncountable set">
<text>In mathematics, an uncountable set, informally, is an infinite set that contains too many elements to be countable. The uncountability of a set is closely related to its cardinal number: a set is uncountable if its cardinal number is larger than aleph-null, the cardinality of the natural numbers.

==Characterizations==

There are many equivalent characterizations of uncountability. A set &quot;X&quot; is uncountable if and only if any of the following conditions hold:
* There is no injective function (hence no bijection) from &quot;X&quot; to the set of natural numbers.
* &quot;X&quot; is nonempty and for every ω-sequence of elements of &quot;X&quot;, there exists at least one element of X not included in it. That is, &quot;X&quot; is nonempty and there is no surjective function from the natural numbers to &quot;X&quot;.
* The cardinality of &quot;X&quot; is neither finite nor equal to formula_1 (aleph-null).
* The set &quot;X&quot; has cardinality strictly greater than formula_1.

The first three of these characterizations can be proven equivalent in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice, but the equivalence of the third and fourth cannot be proved without additional choice principles.

==Properties==
* If an uncountable set &quot;X&quot; is a subset of set &quot;Y&quot;, then &quot;Y&quot; is uncountable.

== Examples ==

The best known example of an uncountable set is the set of all real numbers; Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument shows that this set is uncountable. The diagonalization proof technique can also be used to show that several other sets are uncountable, such as the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers (see: ), and the set of all subsets of the set of natural numbers. The cardinality of is often called the cardinality of the continuum, and denoted by formula_3, or formula_4, or formula_5 (beth-one).

The Cantor set is an uncountable subset of . The Cantor set is a fractal and has Hausdorff dimension greater than zero but less than one ( has dimension one). This is an example of the following fact: any subset of of Hausdorff dimension strictly greater than zero must be uncountable.

Another example of an uncountable set is the set of all functions from to . This set is even &quot;more uncountable&quot; than in the sense that the cardinality of this set is formula_6 (beth-two), which is larger than formula_5.

A more abstract example of an uncountable set is the set of all countable ordinal numbers, denoted by Ω or ω1. The cardinality of Ω is denoted formula_8 (aleph-one). It can be shown, using the axiom of choice, that formula_8 is the &quot;smallest&quot; uncountable cardinal number. Thus either formula_5, the cardinality of the reals, is equal to formula_8 or it is strictly larger. Georg Cantor was the first to propose the question of whether formula_5 is equal to formula_8. In 1900, David Hilbert posed this question as the first of his 23 problems. The statement that formula_14 is now called the continuum hypothesis, and is known to be independent of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms for set theory (including the axiom of choice).

==Without the axiom of choice==

Without the axiom of choice, there might exist cardinalities incomparable to formula_1 (namely, the cardinalities of Dedekind-finite infinite sets). Sets of these cardinalities satisfy the first three characterizations above, but not the fourth characterization. Since these sets are not larger than the natural numbers in the sense of cardinality, some may not want to call them uncountable.

If the axiom of choice holds, the following conditions on a cardinal formula_16 are equivalent:
*formula_17
*formula_18 and
*formula_19, where formula_20 and formula_21 is the least initial ordinal greater than formula_22

However, these may all be different if the axiom of choice fails. So it is not obvious which one is the appropriate generalization of &quot;uncountability&quot; when the axiom fails. It may be best to avoid using the word in this case and specify which of these one means.

<text>Unbreakable is a 2000 American superhero thriller film written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, and starring Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and Robin Wright. It is the first installment in the &quot;Unbreakable&quot; film series. In &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, David Dunn (Willis) survives a train crash with no injuries, leading to the realization that he harbors superhuman abilities. As he begins to grapple with this discovery, he comes to the attention of disabled comic book store owner Elijah Price (Jackson), who manipulates David to understand him.

Shyamalan organized the narrative of &quot;Unbreakable&quot; to parallel a comic book&#x27;s traditional three-part story structure. After settling on the origin story, Shyamalan wrote the screenplay as a speculative screenplay with Willis already set to star in the film and Jackson in mind to portray Elijah Price. Filming began in April 2000 and was completed in July.

&quot;Unbreakable&quot; was released on November 22, 2000. It received generally positive reviews, with praise for Shyamalan&#x27;s direction, screenplay, its aesthetics, the performances, the emotional weight of the story, cinematography, and the score by James Newton Howard. The film has subsequently gained a strong cult following. A realistic vision of the superhero genre, it is regarded by many as one of Shyamalan&#x27;s best films and one of the best superhero films. In 2011, &quot;Time&quot; listed it as one of the top ten superhero films of all time, ranking it number four. Quentin Tarantino also included it on his list of the top 20 films released from 1992 to 2009.

After years of development on a follow-up film, a thematic sequel, &quot;Split&quot;, with Willis reprising his role as David Dunn in a cameo role, was released in January 2017. After the financial and critical success of &quot;Split&quot;, Shyamalan immediately began working on a third film, titled &quot;Glass&quot;, which was released January 18, 2019, thus making &quot;Unbreakable&quot; the first installment in the &quot;Unbreakable&quot; film series.

== Plot ==
In 1961 Philadelphia, baby Elijah Price is born with Type I osteogenesis imperfecta, a rare disease that renders his bones extremely fragile and prone to fracture.

In the present day, former star quarterback and security guard David Dunn is returning home to Philadelphia after a job interview in New York when his train, Eastrail 177, suddenly speeds up. He wakes up in a hospital room, unscathed, and the doctors inform him he is the sole survivor of the derailment that killed all other 131 passengers. After attending a memorial service for the victims, David finds a note on his car asking how long it has been since he has been ill and inviting him to &quot;Limited Edition&quot;, an art gallery operated by the now-adult Elijah Price. He goes with his son Joseph to meet Elijah. Elijah explains his theory of real-life superheroes, and if he represents extreme frailty, that there must be someone &quot;unbreakable&quot; at the opposite extreme. David is unsettled and leaves but later finds he can bench press , well above his expectations. Joseph idolizes his father, believing him to be a superhero, although David maintains that he is an ordinary man.

David challenges Elijah&#x27;s theory with an incident from his childhood when he almost drowned and contracted pneumonia. Elijah suggests that highlights the common convention whereby superheroes have a weakness, contending that David&#x27;s is water. David recalls the car accident in which he had been unharmed and ripped off the car door with his bare hands to rescue his girlfriend, Audrey. He feigned injury from the crash to quit football because Audrey disliked the violence of the sport.

Under Elijah&#x27;s influence, David realizes that his intuition for picking out dangerous people in his work as a security guard is actually extrasensory perception. Consciously honing this ability, David discovers that touch contact with people brings him visions of criminal acts they have committed. As people bump into him in a crowd, he senses the crimes they have perpetrated such as theft, assault, and rape. He finds one he can act on: a sadistic janitor who has invaded a family home, killed the father, and is now holding the mother and two children captive. David follows the janitor to the victims&#x27; house and frees the children. The janitor pushes him into a swimming pool from the balcony where he nearly drowns as he cannot swim, but is rescued by the children. David strangles the janitor to death, but finds the janitor has killed the mother. The next morning, David shows Joseph a newspaper article featuring a sketch of the anonymous hero, whom Joseph recognizes as his father and tearfully promises to keep his secret.

David meets Elijah&#x27;s elderly mother, who explains the difference between villains who fight heroes with physical strength and those who use their intelligence. Elijah asks David to shake his hand, which reveals that Elijah was responsible for numerous high-profile &quot;accidents,&quot; including David&#x27;s train crash, to find his superhero rival. Elijah tells David, &quot;Now that we know who you are, I know who I am&quot;. He adopts his childhood nickname, &quot;Mr. Glass,&quot; as his supervillain moniker. David reports Elijah&#x27;s crimes to the police, and Elijah is confined to a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane.

Writer, director, and producer M. Night Shyamalan makes an appearance as Stadium Drug Dealer. He reprises this role in the 2016 and 2019 films &quot;Split&quot;, and &quot;Glass&quot;, which both credit him as surveillance security guard Jai who in &quot;Glass&quot; jokingly says he used to do shady stuff in the stadium back in his youth.

In October 2018, Shyamalan confirmed a fan theory that &quot;Five-Year-Old Boy&quot; and &quot;Woman Walking By&quot;, who bump into David Dunn outside a stadium, are younger versions of Kevin Wendell Crumb and Penelope Crumb from &quot;Split&quot;, confirmed in the 2019 film &quot;Glass&quot;.

== Production ==
When M. Night Shyamalan conceived the idea for &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, the outline had a comic book&#x27;s traditional three-part structure (the superhero&#x27;s &quot;birth&quot;, his struggles against general evil-doers, and the hero&#x27;s ultimate battle against the &quot;archenemy&quot;). Finding the birth section most interesting, he decided to write &quot;Unbreakable&quot; as an origin story. During the filming of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, Shyamalan had already approached Bruce Willis for the lead role of David Dunn. With Willis and Samuel L. Jackson specifically in mind for the two leading characters, Shyamalan began to write &quot;Unbreakable&quot; as a spec script during post-production on &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. Jackson recalled meeting Willis in a casino in Casablanca while he was on vacation prior to &quot;Unbreakable&quot;″s production; Willis told Jackson that he had just finished filming for Shyamalan&#x27;s &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and told Jackson about the new script that was written for both of them.

With the financial and critical success of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; in August 1999, Shyamalan gave Walt Disney Studios a first-look deal for &quot;Unbreakable&quot;. In return, Disney purchased Shyamalan&#x27;s screenplay at a &quot;spec script record&quot; for $5 million. He was also given another $5 million to direct. Disney decided to release &quot;Unbreakable&quot; under their Touchstone Pictures banner. It also helped Shyamalan establish his own production company, Blinding Edge Pictures. Julianne Moore was cast as Audrey, David&#x27;s wife, in January 2000, but dropped out in March 2000, to take on the role of Clarice Starling in &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Robin Wright was cast in her place. Principal photography began on April 25, 2000, and ended that July. The majority of filming took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the film&#x27;s setting.

Shyamalan and cinematographer Eduardo Serra chose several camera angles to simulate the look of a comic book panel. Various visual narrative motifs were also applied. Several scenes relating to the Mr. Glass character involve glass. As a newborn, he is primarily seen reflected in mirrors, and as a young child, he is seen reflected in a blank TV screen. When he leaves his calling card on the windshield of David Dunn&#x27;s car, he is reflected in a glass frame in his art gallery. Jackson requested his walking stick be made of glass to make his character more menacing. Using purple as Mr. Glass&#x27;s color to David Dunn&#x27;s green was also Jackson&#x27;s idea. Mr. Glass&#x27;s wig was modeled after Afro-American statesman Frederick Douglass. As he does in his other films, Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance; he plays a man David suspects of dealing drugs inside the stadium.

Shyamalan said that he wanted to market &quot;Unbreakable&quot; as a comic book movie, but Disney—which had not yet bought Marvel Comics—preferred to advertise it as a supernatural thriller like &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. More than 15 minutes of footage was deleted during post-production of &quot;Unbreakable&quot;. These scenes are available on the DVD release.

== Soundtrack ==
James Newton Howard was approached by Shyamalan to work on &quot;Unbreakable&quot; immediately after scoring &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. &quot;He sat there and storyboarded the whole movie for me&quot;, Howard said. &quot;I&#x27;ve never had a director do that for me.&quot; Shyamalan wanted a &quot;singularity&quot; tone for the music. &quot;He wanted something that was very different, very distinctive, that immediately evoked the movie when people heard it,&quot; Howard explained. Howard and Shyamalan chose to simplify the score, and minimized the number of instruments (strings, trumpets and piano), with limited orchestrations. It was recorded at AIR Studios Lyndhurst Hall, a converted church in London. &quot;You could have recorded the same music in a studio in Los Angeles, and it would have been great, but there is something about the sound of that church studio,&quot; Howard remarked. &quot;It&#x27;s definitely more &quot;misterioso&quot;.&quot;

== Comic book references ==

Filmmaker and comic book writer Kevin Smith felt &quot;Unbreakable&quot; was briefly similar to a comic book titled &quot;Mage: The Hero Discovered&quot;, written and illustrated by Matt Wagner.

As in comic books, the main characters have their identified color schemes and aliases. David&#x27;s are green and &quot;Security&quot; or &quot;Hero&quot;, while Elijah&#x27;s are purple and &quot;Mr. Glass&quot;. The colors show up in their clothes, the wallpaper and bed sheets in their houses, Elijah&#x27;s note to David, and various personal items. The people whose bad deeds are sensed by David are identified by an article of clothing in a single bright color (red, orange), to contrast them with the dark and dreary color scheme typical of the rest of the movie (but not of most comic books). Several scenes also depict characters through reflections or doorways, as if framing them in a picture similar to comic books.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Unbreakable&quot; was released in the United States on November 22, 2000, in 2,708 theaters and grossed $30.3 million in its opening weekend, finishing second at the box office behind &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;. The film ended up earning $95 million domestically and $153.1 million internationally for a total of $248.1 million, against its $75 million production budget.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Unbreakable&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;With a weaker ending, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; is not as good as &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. However, it is a quietly suspenseful film that intrigues and engages, taking the audience through unpredictable twists and turns along the way.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 62 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times, gave &quot;Unbreakable&quot; 3 out of 4 stars and had largely enjoyed the film, but was disappointed with the ending. Ebert believed that Willis&#x27;s &quot;subtle acting&quot; was positively different from the actor&#x27;s usual work in &quot;brainless action movies&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; opined that &quot;Unbreakable&quot; continued Shyamalan&#x27;s previous approach of &quot;balancing sophistication and horror in all of his movies&quot;. Desson Thomson from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;just as he did in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, writer-director M. Night Shyamalan leads you into a fascinating labyrinth, an alternative universe that lurks right under our noses. In this case, it&#x27;s the mythological world and, in these modern times, the secret design to that labyrinth, the key to the path, is contained in comic books.&quot;

Kenneth Turan, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, gave a negative review, arguing that &quot;Unbreakable&quot; had no originality. &quot;Whether it means to or not, the shadow of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; hangs over &quot;Unbreakable&quot;,&quot; Turan reasoned. &quot;If &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; hadn&#x27;t been as big a success as it was, this story might have been assigned to oblivion, or at least to rewrite.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; mostly criticized Shyamalan&#x27;s writing and the performances given by the actors. He did praise Dylan Tichenor&#x27;s editing and James Newton Howard&#x27;s music composition.

In 2002, Audrey Colombe described the movie&#x27;s plot as an example of what &quot;Toni Morrison calls a &#x27;dehistoricizing allegory,&#x27;&quot; with the Elijah Price character as yet another example of &quot;White Hollywood&quot;&#x27;s &quot;magical African American male character&quot; helping the white hero do the right thing, though Elijah is described as a rare exception to the rule that this character is &quot;never &#x27;bad&#x27;&quot;.

Shyamalan admitted he was disappointed by the reaction &quot;Unbreakable&quot; received from the public and critics. Shyamalan also disliked Touchstone Pictures&#x27; marketing campaign. He wanted to promote &quot;Unbreakable&quot; as a comic book movie, but Touchstone insisted on portraying it as a psychological thriller, similar to &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;.

=== Later reviews ===
In 2009, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, and included it on his list of the top 20 films released since 1992, the year he became a director. Tarantino praised the film as a &quot;brilliant retelling of the Superman mythology&quot;, and said it contains what he considers to be Bruce Willis&#x27; best performance. He also criticized the way the film was marketed upon release, stating he felt that it would have been far more effective if the film&#x27;s advertising simply posed the question of &quot;what if Superman was here on earth, and didn&#x27;t know he was Superman?&quot;

In 2011, &quot;Time&quot; ranked the film at No. 4 in its list of top ten superhero movies of all time, describing it as one of the best superhero origin stories and as a &quot;relatively quiet, subtle and realistic look at the pressures that come with being a superhero.&quot; In 2018, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called it a &quot;deconstruction of the American superhero/villain complex&quot; that is &quot;more prescient than ever.&quot;

=== Home media ===
&quot;Unbreakable&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on June 26, 2001. The DVD version is a THX certified two-disc set that features a DTS audio track, behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes and other bonus material. This release sold 2.3 million units in the United States, and was the top DVD video rental of 2001. It grossed a total of from DVD sales and DVD/VHS rentals in the United States. The film thus had a combined global box office and U.S. home video revenue of $371,028,653, with a 495% return on investment.

In 2008, the movie was released on Blu-ray which had all the bonus features of the Special Edition on DVD &quot;Vista Series&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, the film was watched by viewers on television in 2004, making it the year&#x27;s third most-watched film on television.

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on September 21, 2021.

=== Accolades ===
== Sequels ==

After the film&#x27;s release, rumors of possible sequels began circulating in different interviews and in film fansites. In 2000, Bruce Willis was quoted as hoping for an &quot;Unbreakable&quot; trilogy. In December 2000, Shyamalan denied rumors he wrote &quot;Unbreakable&quot; as the first installment of a trilogy, saying he was not even thinking about it. In August 2001, Shyamalan stated that, because of successful DVD sales, he had approached Touchstone Pictures about an &quot;Unbreakable&quot; sequel, an idea Shyamalan said the studio originally turned down because of the film&#x27;s disappointing box office performance. In a September 2008 article, Shyamalan and Samuel L. Jackson said there was some discussion of a sequel when the film was being made, but that it mostly died with the disappointing box office. Jackson said he was still interested in a sequel but Shyamalan was non-committal. In February 2010, Willis said that Shyamalan was &quot;still thinking about doing the fight movie between me and Sam that we were going to do&quot;, and stated that as long as Jackson was able to participate he would be &quot;up for it&quot;.

=== &quot;Split&quot; ===
In September 2010, Shyamalan revealed that an additional villain had been omitted from &quot;Unbreakable&quot; in anticipation of their inclusion in a sequel, but that the character had instead been used for a forthcoming film he was writing for and producing.

Shyamalan&#x27;s horror thriller film &quot;Split&quot; has been described as a thematic sequel to &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, and was released on January 20, 2017. Although it was filmed substantially as a standalone film, an uncredited cameo by Bruce Willis as David Dunn indeed establishes &quot;Split&quot; as a story within the same world.

Additionally, Shyamalan has stated the orange-suited villain portrayed by Chance Kelly in &quot;Unbreakable&quot; was initially going to be the character &quot;The Horde&quot;. However, features of The Horde were dropped to make the character simpler in order to keep the focus on David. The original character, Kevin Wendell Crumb, would later be fully realized in &quot;Split&quot;.

=== &quot;Glass&quot; ===
Shyamalan expressed hope for a third installment following &quot;Split&quot;, saying, &quot;I hope [a third &quot;Unbreakable&quot; film happens]. The answer is yes. I&#x27;m just such a wimp sometimes. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen when I go off in my room, a week after this film opens, to write the script. But I&#x27;m going to start writing. [I have] a really robust outline, which is pretty intricate. But now the standards for my outlines are higher. I need to know I&#x27;ve won already. I&#x27;m almost there but I&#x27;m not quite there.&quot; In April 2017, Shyamalan announced the official title, release date, and returning actors for the third movie. The film, titled &quot;Glass&quot;, was released on January 18, 2019, and features Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Anya Taylor-Joy, and James McAvoy returning to their respective roles in the series.

<text>The Constitution Party, named the U.S. Taxpayers&#x27; Party until 1999, is an ultra-conservative political party in the United States that promotes a religiously conservative interpretation of the principles and intents of the United States Constitution. The party platform is based on originalist interpretations of the Constitution and shaped by principles which it believes were set forth in the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution and the Bible.

The party was founded by Howard Phillips, a conservative activist, after President George H. W. Bush violated his pledge of &quot;read my lips: no new taxes&quot;. During the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections, the party sought to give its presidential nomination to prominent politicians including Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot, but was unsuccessful and instead selected Phillips as its presidential nominee in three successive elections. Michael Peroutka was given the presidential nomination in 2004, followed by Chuck Baldwin in 2008 (although he faced opposition from multiple state affiliates), Virgil Goode in 2012, Darrell Castle in 2016, Don Blankenship in 2020 and Randall Terry in 2024.

In 2000, Rick Jore, a three-term Republican member of the Montana House of Representatives, became the first member of the party to hold a seat in a state legislature. He was defeated in the 2000, 2002 and 2004 elections; however, he was elected to a state legislature in 2006, the first Constitution Party candidate to be elected. In 2002, Greg Moeller became the first member of the party to win a partisan election. The Constitution parties of Minnesota and Colorado have both achieved major party status once.

, the Constitution Party has 28 members who have been elected to city council seats and other municipal offices across the United States. In terms of registered members, the party ranks fifth among national parties in the United States.

==History==
===Formation===

During the 1988 presidential election, Republican nominee George H. W. Bush stated &quot;read my lips: no new taxes&quot; at the 1988 Republican National Convention. However, Bush violated that pledge during his presidency. Following the breaking of the no new taxes pledge, Howard Phillips announced that he would form a third political party called the U.S. Taxpayers&#x27; Party.

Phillips formed his new party through the U.S. Taxpayers Alliance, an organization he had founded and which had affiliates in twenty-five states, using its mailing list to announce the formation of a new party. Phillips also attempted to create a coalition with state affiliates of the American Party, but was rejected. The party was accepted into the Coalition for Free and Open Elections alongside the Freedom Socialist Party. The party launched its first petition drive when Jack Perry started a campaign to appear on the 1991 United States special election ballot in Pennsylvania.

===1990s===

From January 25 to 26, 1997, the national committee of the U.S. Taxpayers&#x27; Party convened in Miami, Florida. During their meeting it was proposed to change the name of the party to either &quot;Constitutional&quot; or &quot;Independent American&quot;, but the vote was tied 27 to 27 so U.S. Taxpayers&#x27; was retained as the party&#x27;s name. In March 1999, another name change was proposed, with American Independent, American Heritage, Constitutional, Independent American, and American Constitution as possible names, but it was unsuccessful. On September 3, 1999, the national convention of the U.S. Taxpayers&#x27; Party was held and during it the name of the party was successfully changed to Constitution. Every state affiliate of the party, except for Nevada and California, changed their names except for in Michigan where the Michigan Secretary of State denied the request. The party is still called the U.S. Taxpayers&#x27; Party in Michigan as of 2022.

In 1998, Patricia Becker, the U.S. Taxpayer&#x27;s nominee for Minnesota state auditor, received over 5% of the popular vote giving the U.S Taxpayers&#x27; Party major party status in Minnesota. The party would later hold caucuses during the 2000 presidential election.

====1992 presidential election====

Members of the party sought to give its presidential nomination to Ross Perot or Pat Buchanan during the 1992 presidential election, but were unsuccessful. In January 1992, Phillips was selected to serve as a tentative presidential candidate for the party until a more prominent candidate wanted the party&#x27;s presidential nomination. Albion W. Knight Jr. was later selected to serve as the party&#x27;s tentative vice-presidential nominee.

On April 15, Phillips announced that he would run for the presidency. Phillips accepted the U.S. Taxpayers&#x27; Party&#x27;s presidential nomination at its national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana, which was held from September 4 to 5. In the general election Phillips and Knight placed seventh with 43,400 votes.

Following the 1992 presidential election, the U.S. Taxpayers&#x27; Party&#x27;s had ballot qualified state affiliates in California, New Mexico, and South Carolina.

====1996 presidential election====

In 1996, Phillips sent a memo to conservative Christian leaders including James Dobson, the head of Focus on the Family, stating that anti-abortion candidates like Pat Buchanan, Alan Keyes, or Bob Dornan were unlikely to become the Republican presidential nominee and that they should instead support an anti-abortion third-party candidate.

Phillips supported giving the presidential nomination of the U.S. Taxpayers&#x27; Party to Buchanan. Tom Staley, Buchanan&#x27;s campaign chairman in northern Texas, stated that Buchanan would consider accepting the party&#x27;s nomination if it had ballot access in all fifty states. Phillips was given the party&#x27;s presidential nomination again at its national convention in San Diego, California, on August 17, 1996, and Herbert Titus was selected to serve as the vice-presidential nominee. In the general election Phillips and Titus placed sixth with 184,820 votes.

===2000s===
In 2000, a schism occurred within the party, with those who advocated an explicitly religious party leaving to form the Christian Liberty Party, then known as the American Heritage Party.

On February 15, 2000, Rick Jore, a member of the Montana House of Representatives who had attended the 1999 Constitution Party National Convention, announced that he was leaving the Republican Party and joining the Constitution Party. Jore unsuccessfully sought reelection in 2000, and unsuccessfully attempted to win election to the Montana House of Representatives in 2002, and 2004, before winning election to the state house in 2006.

On November 5, 2002, Greg Moeller became the first member of the Constitution Party to win a partisan election when he won election as a Scott Township Trustee in Hamilton County, Iowa, with only a write-in opponent.

In 2006, the Constitution Party of Oregon disaffiliated with the national Constitution Party over disagreements regarding abortion policy. However, despite disaffiliating the Constitution Party of Oregon gave its presidential nomination to Baldwin during the 2008 presidential election. During the 2012 presidential election the party attempted to give its presidential nomination to Ron Paul, but he rejected it and Will Christensen was given the nomination instead. In 2013, the Constitution Party of Oregon affiliated with the Independent American Party.

====2000 presidential election====

Unlike the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections, the U.S. Taxpayers&#x27; Party did not seek a prominent politician to give its presidential nomination to. New Hampshire Senator Bob Smith announced that he was leaving the Republican Party on July 13, 1999, and briefly sought the presidential nomination of the Constitution Party before dropping out.

On September 4, 1999, the party selected to give its presidential nomination to Phillips and its vice-presidential nomination to Joseph Sobran. However, on March 31, 2000, Sobran resigned from the ticket due to conflicts between him being a columnist and vice-presidential nominee. On September 2, Curtis Frazier was selected to replace Sobran as the party&#x27;s vice-presidential nominee. In the general election Phillips and Frazier placed sixth with 98,027 votes.

====2004 presidential election====

On November 7, 2003, Michael Peroutka announced that he would seek the Constitution Party&#x27;s presidential nomination and on the same day the party selected him to serve as the stand-in presidential candidate. He won the presidential nominations of the American Independent and Alaskan Independence parties. Peroutka was given the party&#x27;s presidential nomination and Chuck Baldwin was given the party&#x27;s vice-presidential nomination.

====2008 presidential election====

Chuck Baldwin and Alan Keyes sought the Constitution Party&#x27;s presidential nomination during the 2008 presidential election. At the party&#x27;s national convention Baldwin defeated Keyes winning the party&#x27;s presidential nomination and Darrell Castle was selected to serve as the vice-presidential nominee. Baldwin also received the presidential nomination of the Reform Party of Kansas. In the general election they placed sixth with 199,880 votes.

However, the American Independent Party, which had been affiliated with the Constitution since 1991, split into two factions between supports of Baldwin and Keyes. The Secretary of State of California ruled that the presidential ticket of Keyes and Wiley Drake had the nomination of the American Independent Party. In the general election they placed ninth with 47,941 votes.

On September 5, the Constitution Party of Montana submitted a list of presidential electors pledged to Ron Paul for president and Michael Peroutka for vice-president. Paul was aware and that he would not object as long as he did not need to sign any declaration of candidacy. However, Paul later wrote a letter to the Secretary of State of Montana asking for his name to be removed from the ballot as he was nominated without permission, but it was too late to remove his name from the ballot. Paul also appeared on the ballot in Louisiana under the name &quot;Louisiana Taxpayers Party&quot; with Barry Goldwater Jr. as his vice-presidential running mate. Paul later endorsed Baldwin for president. In the general election he placed tenth with 47,512 votes.

===2010s===

During the 2010 Colorado gubernatorial election, the American Constitution Party, the Constitution Party&#x27;s affiliate in Colorado, gave its gubernatorial nomination to Tom Tancredo. In the general election Tancredo received over 36% of the popular vote, more than the 10% required for major party status in Colorado. During the campaign the American Constitution Party&#x27;s voter registration doubled from 1,271 to 2,731 voters. Major party status in Colorado gave the party the ability to appoint seventeen members to Colorado state boards and commissions, but the party suffered from complicated campaign finance reports and fines from errors and omissions in the reports which led to a negative bank account balance.

====2012 presidential election====

On February 21, 2012, Virgil Goode, a former member of the United States House of Representatives who had served as a Democrat, independent, and Republican, announced that he would seek the Constitution Party&#x27;s presidential nomination. Goode won the nomination at the party&#x27;s national convention which was held from April 18 to 21, 2012, in Nashville, Tennessee, and Jim Clymer was selected to serve as his vice-presidential running mate. Goode was the first Constitution Party presidential nominee to have held elected federal or state office. In the general election Goode and Clymer placed sixth with 122,417 votes.

The Reform Party of Kansas gave its presidential nomination to Chuck Baldwin and its vice-presidential nomination to Joseph Martin as his vice-presidential running mate. However, the party attempted to give its presidential nomination to Goode, but the attempt to change the nomination was rejected by the Kansas State Objections Board.

===2020s===

In 2020, the Virginia, Idaho, South Dakota, and Alaska Constitution parties disaffiliated with the national Constitution Party and the Montana Constitution Party disbanded. On April 14, the Constitution Party of Virginia&#x27;s state committee voted to reaffiliate with the national Constitution Party, but was rejected by the national party on May 2.

====2020 presidential election====

From October 18 to 19, 2019, a meeting of the Constitution Party&#x27;s national committee was held. Don Blankenship served as a speaker at the meeting and announced his intention to run for the party&#x27;s presidential nomination. On May 2, 2020, Blankenship won the party&#x27;s nomination at its virtual convention and William Mohr was selected to serve as the vice-presidential nominee.

However, the Constitution parties of Virginia and New Mexico instead gave their presidential nominations to Sheila Tittle and the Virginia Constitution Party gave its vice-presidential nomination to Matthew Hehl. The South Carolina Constitution Party chose to not run a presidential candidate during the 2020 presidential election.

====2024 presidential election====
The party nominated anti-abortion activist Randall Terry for president and Stephen Broden for vice president. Some state parties such as Nevada and Utah rejected Terry&#x27;s nomination and instead nominated convention opponent Joel Skousen.

===Impact===
The party has sometimes been described as a spoiler for the Republican Party. There have been instances of the Democratic Party helping Constitution Party candidates for this reason, such as by running ads for their nominee in the 2020 United States Senate election in South Carolina, or assisting Randall Terry, their nominee in the 2024 presidential election, with ballot access and campaign promotion efforts.

==Voter registration and notable members==

Multiple Republicans, including Bob Smith, Virgil Goode, Tom Tancredo, Ellen Craswell, Rick Jore, and Cynthia Davis, have joined the Constitution Party.

On April 2, 2002, Ezola Foster, who had served as the Reform Party of the United States of America&#x27;s vice-presidential nominee during the 2000 presidential election, left the Reform Party to join the Constitution Party. From 2002 to 2004, she served on the party&#x27;s national committee.

Jim Gilchrist, the founder of the Minuteman Project, ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives from California&#x27;s 48th congressional district in a 2005 special election. He was the nominee of the American Independent Party, when it was affiliated with the Constitution Party, and placed third with 26,507 votes (25.5%). During the campaign, Gilchrist had raised more money than all of the Democratic candidates combined. Gilchrist&#x27;s 25.5% was the highest percentage of the vote received for a third-party candidate in a United States House of Representatives election where both major parties participated since the A Connecticut Party received 26.3% in Connecticut&#x27;s 1st congressional district in 1994.

Jerome Corsi, who co-authored books with Gilchrist and Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, considered running for the Constitution Party&#x27;s presidential nomination during the 2008 presidential election, but declined to seek the nomination. Joe Miller, who ran as the Republican nominee in Alaska&#x27;s 2010 Senate election, considered running for the Constitution Party&#x27;s presidential nomination during the 2016 presidential election, but later declined. John Hostettler, who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1994 to 2006 as a Republican, also considered running for the party&#x27;s presidential nomination in 2016.

On November 18, 2010, Virgil Goode joined the national committee of the Constitution Party. Goode served as a speaker at the Constitution Party&#x27;s national committee meetings in 2009 and 2012. Goode later served as the party&#x27;s presidential nominee during the 2012 presidential election.

==Platform==
===Domestic===
====Electoral College====
The Constitution Party&#x27;s 2016 platform supported retaining the Electoral College and was opposed to establishing a popular vote system to elect the president and vice president of the United States.

====Environmental policy====
The party believes that &quot;it is our responsibility to be prudent, productive, and efficient stewards of God&#x27;s natural resources&quot;.

The party rejects the scientific consensus on climate change, saying that &quot;globalists are using the global warming threat to gain more control via worldwide sustainable development&quot;. According to the party, eminent domain is unlawful because &quot;under no circumstances may the federal government take private property, by means of rules and regulations which preclude or substantially reduce the productive use of the property, even with just compensation&quot;.

In regards to energy, the party calls attention to &quot;the continuing need of the United States for a sufficient supply of energy for national security and for the immediate adoption of a policy of free market solutions to achieve energy independence for the United States,&quot; and calls for the abolition of the Department of Energy.

====Federalism====

The party supports the repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment, which allows Congress to tax income derived from interest, dividends, and capital gains, and the Seventeenth Amendment, which requires the direct (popular) election of Senators. The party holds that each state&#x27;s membership in the Union is voluntary, a stance known as the compact theory.

====Fiscal policy====
The Constitution Party&#x27;s 2012 platform called for phasing out social security, and the 2016 platform states that &quot;Social Security is a form of individual welfare not authorized in the Constitution&quot;.

The 2012 platform supports reducing the role of the United States federal government through cutting bureaucratic regulation, reducing spending, and replacing the income tax with a tariff-based revenue system supplemented by excise taxes. The party also takes the position that the &quot;imposition [...] of Federal income, payroll, and estate taxes [...] is an unconstitutional Federal assumption of direct taxing authority&quot;. The party also supports the prohibition of Fractional-reserve banking and the return to the Gold standard saying quote &quot;The Constitution forbade the States from accepting or using anything other than a Gold and Silver based currency&quot; as stated in the 2016-2020 platform.

====Social policy====
The party opposes euthanasia, suicide, and abortion, including in cases of rape and incest. The party supports the right of states to administer the death penalty.

The party opposes any government legislation to authorize or define marriage contrary to the Bible, and states that &quot;The law of our Creator defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman&quot;. It supports the right for local and state governments to &quot;proscribe offensive sexual behavior&quot; and rejects &quot;the notion that homosexuals, transgenders [sic] or those who are sexually deviant are deserving of legal favor or special protection&quot;. The party strongly opposes &quot;adoption by homosexual singles or couples&quot;.

The party also opposes pornography, believing that it is &quot;a destructive element of society resulting in significant and real emotional, physical, spiritual and financial costs to individuals, families and communities,&quot; and distinguishable from the US citizen&#x27;s &quot;cherished First Amendment right to free speech.&quot; While expressing its belief in the individual responsibility of citizens and corporations, the party maintains that government plays a &quot;vital role&quot; in establishing and maintaining the highest level of decency in America&#x27;s community standards.

The party opposes all government sponsorship, involvement in, or promotion of gambling. Citing Article 1 Section 8 and Amendment 10, the party opposes federal anti-drug laws, while conceding that the federal government may have a role in limiting the import of drugs.

The Constitution Party believes that charitable giving is most effective when conducted by private parties. Because the authority to administer charity has not been granted to the government in the Constitution, the party maintains that the government has no business being involved in such endeavors. The party opposes federal restrictions on, or subsidization of, medical treatments.

The party supports English as the official language for all governmental business, opposes bilingual ballots, and insists that those who wish to take part in the electoral process and governance of the U.S. be required to read and comprehend basic English as a precondition for citizenship.

In 2009, the Southern Poverty Law Center described the party as a &quot;Patriot Group,&quot; a category of parties that &quot;advocate or adhere to extreme anti-government doctrines&quot;.

====Religion====

R. J. Rushdoony, a main figure in Christian reconstructionism, helped write the party&#x27;s 1992 platform. The 1992 platform stated that &quot;the U.S. Constitution established a republic under God, not a democracy&quot;. Christian reconstructionism has been influential in the Constitution Party and calls for the remaking of government and society according to Old Testament Biblical law.

The preamble of the 2004 platform states that the Lordship of Christ Jesus and the Bible are the final authority of law. It also stated that the purpose of the party was to restore American jurisprudence to its biblical and constitutional roots.

===Foreign===
====Trade====
The Constitution Party&#x27;s 2012 platform supports a non-interventionist foreign policy. It advocates reduction and eventual elimination of the role the United States plays in multinational and international organizations such as the United Nations and favors withdrawal of the United States from most treaties, such as NATO, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization. The party supports protectionist policies in international trade.

The party also believes in exercising a tariff system to counteract the United States&#x27; increasingly negative balance of trade.

====Immigration policy====
In 2012, the party opposed immigration to the United States without government permission, and sought stricter controls on legal immigration. It demanded that the federal government implement an immigration policy disqualifying potential immigrants on grounds of ill health, criminality, low morals, or financial dependence, claiming that they would impose an improper burden on the United States. The party favored a moratorium on future immigration, with exceptions only for extreme cases of necessity, until federal welfare programs have been phased out and a better vetting program is in place.

The party opposes welfare subsidies and other benefits to undocumented immigrants. It rejects the practice of bestowing U.S. citizenship on children born to illegal immigrant parents while in this country (&quot;jus soli&quot;), and flatly rejects any extension of amnesty to undocumented immigrants. The Constitution Party additionally calls for the use of the United States military to enforce its strict immigration policy.

<doc id="32254" wikidata="Q656087" url="?curid=32254" title="German submarine U-552">
<text>German submarine &quot;U-552&quot; was a Type VIIC U-boat built for Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; for service during World War II. She was laid down on 1 December 1939 at Blohm &amp; Voss in Hamburg as yard number 528, launched on 14 September 1940, and went into service on 4 December 1940. &quot;U-552&quot; was nicknamed the &quot;Roter Teufel&quot; (&quot;Red Devil&quot;) after her mascot of a grinning devil, which was painted on the conning tower. She was one of the more successful of her class, operating for over three years of continual service and sinking or damaging 35 Allied ships with 164,276 GRT and 1,190 tons sunk and 26,910 GRT damaged. She was a member of 21 wolf packs.

&quot;U-552&quot; was involved in two controversial actions: On 31 October 1941, she sank the , the first US Navy warship to be lost in World War II; this was at a time when the US was still officially neutral, and caused a diplomatic dispute. On 3 April 1942, she sank the freighter &quot;David H. Atwater&quot; off the US seaboard.

&quot;U-552&quot; had an unusually long service life, surviving to the end of World War II; after evacuating from her French base during the spring of 1944, she operated on training duties in the Baltic Sea until she was decommissioned in February 1945. On 5 May 1945, she was scuttled in Helgoland Bight, to prevent her falling into enemy hands.

==Design==
German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. &quot;U-552&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder, supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, and two Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie GG UB 720/8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-552&quot; was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), 14 torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and a C/30 antiaircraft gun. The boat had a complement between 44 and 60.

==Service history==

===Initial voyage to Helgoland===
Following construction, which was completed on 4 December 1940, &quot;U-552&quot; was given two months of working-up training, during which she prepared her crew and equipment for the operations ahead. She then sailed from Kiel on 13 February to Helgoland for her first official patrol, arriving there on 18 February 1941. This port city was to remain &quot;U-552&quot;″s home base until she was transferred to the occupied French port of St Nazaire in mid-March 1941.

===First patrol===
&quot;U-552&quot;″s first official war patrol began on 18 February 1941, when she left Helgoland for a patrol in the North Sea and the North Atlantic south of Iceland. This first operation yielded one British tanker and one Icelandic trawler carrying fish. The British tanker &quot;Cadillac&quot; was sunk just north of Scotland on 1 March, while the trawler was sunk just south of Iceland on 10 March. Following these victories, &quot;U-552&quot; headed back to St Nazaire. The remainder of her later patrols were all conducted from the French city, which gave her easy access to the Atlantic Ocean and allowed her more time at sea.

===Second patrol===
&quot;U-552&quot; began her second war patrol on 7 April 1941, when she left her new home port of St Nazaire for the North Atlantic. The &quot;U-552&quot; arrived in her assigned patrol area south-west of Iceland on 11 April. No targets were engaged until 26 April when at 18:09 GMT, the &quot;U-552&quot; was midway between Iceland and northern Scotland. Topp sighted “s&quot;moke cloud bearing 10°T&quot;” from a small “&quot;patrol vessel size&quot;” target. The target was followed “&quot;at the limit of visibility&quot;” while waiting for nightfall. At 00:10 (27 April), about 130 nautical miles SE of Iceland, the small vessel &quot;Commander Horton&quot; was attacked. The U-552 log records “&quot;Fishing trawler (patrol vessel) sunk with 82 shots of 8.8 cm and 102 shots MG C30.  No resistance.”&quot; (&quot;Commander Horton&quot;, 227 tones, 14 casualties).

Around 11:00 GMT on 27 April, the &quot;U-552&quot; was submerged and “&quot;Propeller sounds heard bearing 200°T&quot;”. Topp then commenced a surface pursuit of a large steamer. “&quot;Estimate enemy speed 16 knots.  Am gaining only as a result of the zig zags.&quot;” At 14:12, at grid position AL3236, the &quot;Beacon Grange&quot; was in the targeting range of 1000 meters. The submerged U-552 fired a fan of three torpedoes. All three torpedoes hit the ship. A few minutes later while the crew were launching lifeboats, the U-552 surfaced and “&quot;ran in for a coup de grace”.&quot;  A fourth torpedo was fired and the U-boat log records “&quot;Hit aft 20 meters.&quot; … &quot;Steamer breaks completely in the center, deck awash, ends continue to float.”&quot; (&quot;Beacon Grange&quot;, 10,119 tones, 2 casualties)

During the afternoon of 28 April 1941, a historic battle was underway about 180 miles south of Iceland. A wolf pack “&quot;Rudeltaktik&quot;” of five U-boats had launched the war&#x27;s first submerged daylight attack on a convoy. The submerged U-boats, which were spread out over a distance of about 10 miles, intercepted and attacked an east-bound convoy. The &quot;U-123&quot; (Karl-Heinz Moehle), had spotted Convoy HX-121 and called in &quot;U-65&quot; (Joachim Hoppe), &quot;U-95&quot; (Gerd Schreiber), &quot;U-96&quot; (Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock), and &quot;U-552&quot; (Erich Topp) for the kill. &quot;U-552&quot; started things off at 14:15 GMT (60°06’N 20°18’W), when it torpedoed the British tanker &quot;Capulet&quot;. Nine casualties resulted, and the tanker was abandoned, but did not sink. At 17:25, three more ships were sunk by &quot;U-96&quot; with one spread of three torpedoes: British tanker &quot;Oilfield&quot; (47 casualties, 8 survivors); Norwegian tanker &quot;Caledonia&quot; (12 casualties, 25 survivors); and British freighter &quot;Port Hardy&quot; (one casualty). &quot;U-65&quot; was sunk by HMS &quot;Douglas&quot; in a depth-charge attack, and all 50 men in the crew perished.

After torpedoing the tanker &quot;Capulet&quot;, &quot;U-552&quot; was depth charged in five separate attacks from destroyers HMS &quot;Maori&quot; and HMS &quot;Inglefield&quot;, forcing the submarine to remain submerged for hours until the convoy was out of range. The &quot;U-552&quot; had been damaged and this would be a troubled day, with attacks from air and sea as it neared the convoy, swift dives, and gingerly resurfacing. After diving and hearing nothing at 01:45 on the 30th, Erich Topp realized that Convoy HX-121 must have changed course to the north. His convoy pursuit was broken off and his boat came to a southerly course. At 02:18 GMT, Topp sent a message to B.d.U. (Admiral Dönitz): “S&quot;ank: “Beacon Grange”, a patrol vessel. From convoy tanker 8000 tons. Return Transit via North Channel.&quot; [My position] &quot;AM2477&quot;.” In his log, Topp recorded “&quot;Intention: As long as fuel allows, position in North Channel&quot;.”

On 30 April, the surfaced &quot;U-552&quot; was about 150 nautical miles west of the North Channel entrance … and searching for targets. At 21:40 GMT, Topp sighted a ship, the troopship &quot;S.S. Nerissa&quot; approaching from the north-west. For almost 2 hours, Topp stalked the zigzagging &quot;Nerissa&quot; and adjusted his torpedo firing solution accordingly. Finally, Topp saw a phosphorescent glow on the sea and decided that 1,000 metres was as close as he should approach his target, and he fired a fan of three torpedoes. The &quot;U-552&quot; log records that one of the three torpedoes “&quot;hit astern&quot;” at 00:27 Berlin Time (GMT+2). About 6 minutes later, Topp closed in on the already stricken ship and fired a fourth torpedo as a &quot;coup de grace&quot; into &quot;Nerissa&#x27;s&quot; aft starboard side while her crew and passengers were launching lifeboats. More than half of the 207 casualties were Canadians. (&quot;SS Nerissa&quot;, 5,583 tones, casualties 207)  

The &quot;U-552&quot; had four remaining torpedoes and she continued searching for merchant ships in transit towards the North Channel. Topp was not successful in engaging any additional targets and almost 48 hours after sinking the &quot;SS Nerissa&quot;, the &quot;U-552&quot; commenced her homeward transit south. She arrived in St Nazaire on 6 May.  

===Third patrol===
&quot;U-552&quot; left St Nazaire for her third war patrol on 25 May 1941. In 39 days, she travelled into the North Atlantic and sank three British vessels: the &quot;Ainderby&quot; on 10 June, the &quot;Chinese Prince&quot; on 12 June, and the &quot;Norfolk&quot; on 18 June. During the attack on the &quot;Norfolk&quot;, &quot;U-552&quot; attempted to attack the remaining ships in the convoy, but was forced to break off the attack due to the arrival of several of the convoy&#x27;s escorts. All of these attacks occurred off the northwest coast of Ireland, and once &quot;U-552&quot; returned to St. Nazaire on 2 July 1941, she had amassed a total of 24,401 GRT from the ships she had sunk.

===Fourth patrol===
&quot;U-552&quot;″s fourth patrol was much less successful than her previous three. Having left St Nazaire on 18 August, she proceeded to head south into the waters off Portugal and Spain. Here, she sank the Norwegian vessel, &quot;Spind&quot;. Following this sinking, &quot;U-552&quot; returned to St Nazaire on 26 August 1941, after only 9 days at sea.

===Fifth and sixth patrols===
Her next two patrols all took her further into the Atlantic, where the danger was lessened, but so were the targets, with the result that she only hit three more cargo ships. Also this time, during her final patrol of 1941, she sank the &quot;Reuben James&quot;, which was torpedoed on 30 October in controversial circumstances.

====Sinking of USS &quot;Reuben James&quot;====

On 31 October 1941, USS &quot;Reuben James&quot; was one of five destroyers escorting convoy HX-156, close to the coast of Iceland, about west of the island. &quot;Reuben James&quot; had just begun turning to investigate a strong direction-finder bearing when a torpedo launched from &quot;U-552&quot; struck her port side and caused an explosion in her forward magazine. The entire bow section of the destroyer was blown off as far back as the fourth funnel and sank immediately. The stern remained afloat for around five minutes before sinking; unsecured depth charges compounded the damage, exploding as they sank and killing survivors in the water. Of her 160-man crew, 115 were killed, including all the officers.

The destroyer was the first US Navy warship to be sunk in World War II.

The incident provoked a furious outburst in the United States, especially when Germany refused to apologize, instead countering that the destroyer was operating in what Germany considered to be a war zone and had suffered the consequences. The sinking of the &quot;Reuben James&quot; did not lead the US to declare war on Germany; it did, however, provide a pretext to officially transfer the US Coast Guard from its peacetime role as an arm of the US Treasury Department to a wartime function as part of the US Navy. Congress also amended the Neutrality Act to permit the arming of US-registered merchant ships and authorized them to enter European waters for the first time since 1939.

===Second Happy Time===
In 1942, again commanded by Erich Topp (who later became an admiral in the postwar Bundesmarine), &quot;U-552&quot; participated in the &quot;Second Happy Time&quot; (Operation &quot;Drumbeat&quot; or &quot;Paukenschlag&quot;), during which German submarines had great success against unescorted American merchantmen sailing alone along the eastern seaboard of the US. &quot;U-552&quot; was particularly successful during this period, sinking 13 ships and damaging another in just three patrols in the first six months of 1942. Two further patrols under Topp during the summer netted four more ships. However, in an attack against Convoy ON-155 on 3 August 1942, the boat was nearly sunk when she was caught on the surface by the Canadian corvette . The corvette machine-gunned the submarine and hit the conning tower with a four-inch shell, causing severe damage and forcing Topp to return to base for repairs. &quot;U-552&quot; was badly damaged by heavy seas during another patrol and was put into port for repairs, during which Topp was promoted and replaced by a more cautious commander, Klaus Popp.

====Sinking of the &quot;David H. Atwater&quot;====
The destruction of the , in the Atlantic Ocean off Chincoteague, Virginia, was one of the more controversial actions of the Kriegsmarine during the Second World War, primarily due to the manner of the sinking.

On the night of 2 April 1942, at the height of the U-boat offensive against US shipping known as the &quot;Second Happy Time&quot;, the unarmed coastal steamer &quot;David H. Atwater&quot; was en route from Norfolk, Virginia, to Fall River, Massachusetts, with a full load of 4,000 tons of coal.

Around 21:00, between Cape Charles and Cape Henlopen, the ship was ambushed by &quot;U-552&quot;, which had followed her submerged. The submarine surfaced about from the freighter and opened fire with her 88 mm deck gun and machine guns without warning, one of her first shells destroying the bridge and killing all of the officers. In all, 93 rounds were fired from the deck gun, with 50 hits being recorded on the small freighter, which rapidly began to sink.

As it did so, Topp directed his crewmen to continue firing, striking the &quot;Atwater&quot;″s crewmen as they tried to man the lifeboats. When Captain Webster was hit, the crew abandoned attempts to launch the lifeboats and leapt into the sea.

The first ship to arrive on the scene was the small Coast Guard Patrol Boat USCGC &quot;CG-218&quot;, which found a lifeboat holding three survivors and three bodies; the survivors reported that they had dived overboard and swum to the boat. Next on the scene was the Coast Guard cutter , which had heard the gunfire and arrived just 15 minutes later. The &quot;Legare&quot; found a second lifeboat with a body aboard; the boat was discovered to have been riddled by gunfire, and lent strength to the widespread belief at the time that U-boats were deliberately murdering the survivors of ships they had sunk. The &quot;Legare&quot; landed the three survivors and four bodies at Chincoteague Island Coastguard Station, then returned to sea to search further.

The destroyers and were directed to the scene at 21:22 and arrived at 24:00, but &quot;U-552&quot; had by then escaped the scene, going on to sink other vessels.

Whether the attack on the liferafts was deliberate, or an unfortunate and unintended consequence of a nighttime attack, has been heavily debated. Some of the crew of &quot;U-552&quot; survived the war, and her captain, Erich Topp, later became an admiral in the postwar Bundesmarine. No charges were brought against Topp, as happened to Helmuth von Ruckteschell, captain of the raider &quot;Widder&quot; for a similar offence.

===Later patrols===
&quot;U-552&quot; had less success in later years, as did the U-boat force in general, as U-boats failed to keep ahead of the rapidly increasing numbers and capabilities of Allied antisubmarine efforts. She was transferred to operations off the Spanish, Portuguese, and African coasts, which were nearer to base and less dangerous than the newly reorganized defenses of the United States, where she attempted to sink troopships during Operation Torch. Whilst on this duty, Topp sank a small British minesweeper and later a cargo ship, but failed to enter the Straits of Gibraltar or seriously threaten the landings.

During 1943, &quot;U-552&quot; was increasingly unable to serve effectively against the well-prepared and organized Allied convoy system, a fact reflected by her failure to sink a single ship during her two patrols into the North Atlantic Ocean. During one of these, a Royal Air Force B-24 Liberator aircraft spotted her and she was seriously damaged by depth charges, which necessitated four months&#x27; repairs.

In 1944, she had a single patrol, but was unable to close with or threaten any Allied convoys, so was withdrawn to Germany in April 1944 for use as a training vessel in the 22nd U-boat Flotilla, a role she fulfilled until she was decommissioned in February 1945. On 5 May 1945, she was scuttled in Wilhelmshaven Bay to prevent her capture.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-571&quot; was a Type VIIC U-boat built for the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; of Nazi Germany for service during World War II. &quot;U-571&quot; conducted eleven war patrols, sinking five ships totalling , and damaging one other for 11,394 GRT. On 28 January 1944 she was attacked by an Australian-crewed Sunderland aircraft from No. 461 Squadron RAAF west of Ireland and was destroyed by depth charges. All hands were lost.

The fictional 2000 U.S. war film &quot;&quot;U-571&quot;&quot; has no relation to this U-boat, but is very loosely based on the British capture of and her Enigma and cipher keys.

==Design==
German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. &quot;U-571&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie GG UB 720/8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-571&quot; was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.

==Service history==

Her keel was laid down on 8 June 1940 by Blohm &amp; Voss of Hamburg. She was commissioned on 22 May 1941 with &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Helmut Möhlmann in command. Under his command &quot;U-571&quot; had nine successful patrols in the Arctic and in the North and Central Atlantic. In August and September 1941, &quot;U-571&quot; operated against Allied and Soviet forces, damaging the Soviet passenger vessel &quot;Marija Uljanova&quot; on 26 August.

In 1942, &quot;U-571&quot; operated off the east coast of the United States, sinking the British cargo ship on 29 March, the Norwegian tanker M/T &quot;Koll&quot; on 6 April off Cape Hatteras, and the American freighter &quot;Margaret&quot; on April 14 after the ship left San Juan, Puerto Rico. Although &quot;U-571&quot;’s log mentions that some of the 8 officers and 21 men managed to get into a lifeboat and onto rafts, none of &quot;Margaret&quot;’s crew was ever seen again. In July 1942 the submarine operated in the Caribbean and torpedoed four ships: the British freighter &quot;Umtata&quot; on 7 July, the American tanker, &quot;J. A. Moffett, Jr.&quot; on 8 July, the Honduran freighter &quot;Nicholas Cuneo&quot; on 9 July and on 15 July the American tanker, &quot;Pennsylvania Sun&quot;.

The whole crew of &quot;J. A. Moffett, Jr.&quot; (35 merchant marine and 5 Naval Armed Guard) abandoned ship into two lifeboats and three rafts, except for the master who was killed. The United States Coast Guard vessels &quot;Mary Jean&quot; and &quot;Southbound&quot; picked up the 39 survivors and brought them to Florida. When &quot;Pennsylvania Sun&quot; was torpedoed, two of the merchant crew died in the resulting explosion, but the rest of the 40 merchant marine crew and the 17 members of the Naval Armed Guard aboard survived after being rescued by . &quot;Pennsylvania Sun&quot; was later salvaged and returned to service, while the other three ships attacked in July were sunk.

On 22 March 1943, &quot;U-571&quot; was attacked by an aircraft in the North Atlantic and was damaged and had to return to base. In April 1943, Möhlmann claimed that he sank three additional ships but these could not be matched with records of Allied losses. On 22 April 1943, she had to return to base because the commander was badly injured in an accident on the conning tower. On 2 May 1943, Möhlmann was relieved by &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Gustav Lüssow. &quot;U-571&quot; patrolled off the west coast of Africa in July before returning to base on 1 September. Between September and December, &quot;U-571&quot; was probably being overhauled in a drydock as no mention of the boat for that time period appears in war diary kept by the German Commander in Chief, Submarines, Admiral Karl Dönitz. 

On 18 January 1944, Lüssow reported to his submarine command that he attacked and sank an unknown destroyer. This could not, however, be identified with any known Allied losses during World War II.

===Fate===
On 28 January 1944 she was attacked by an Australian captained Sunderland aircraft from No. 461 Squadron RAAF west of Ireland and was destroyed by depth charges. The aircraft&#x27;s captain, Flight Lieutenant R. D. Lucas, reported that most of the crew successfully abandoned ship, but soon died from hypothermia. A dinghy was dropped but failed to open. &quot;U-571&quot; sank with all hands52 deadat . She had not, until her loss, suffered any casualties to her crew during her entire career. The plane, &quot;EK577&quot; (callsign &quot;D for Dog&quot;), was crewed partly by Royal Air Force (RAF) personnel and was based at RAF Pembroke Dock, in Wales. The crew was Lucas, Sergeant (Sgt) J. R. Brannan (RAF, a Canadian), Flight Sergeant (F/Sgt) W. J. Darcey, Sgt D. Musson (RAF), F/Sgt S. T. Burnett, Sgt D. McWalker (RAF), Flying Officer (F/O) H. D. Roberts, F/Sgt G. H. Simmonds (RAF), F/O R. H. Prentice, and F/Sgt C. D. Bremner.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-110&quot; was a Type IXB U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; that operated during World War II. She was captured by the Royal Navy on 9 May 1941 and provided a number of secret cipher documents to the British. &quot;U-110&quot;″s capture, later given the code name &quot;Operation Primrose&quot;, was one of the biggest secrets of the war, remaining so for seven months. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was only told of the capture by Winston Churchill in January 1942.

==Design==
Type IXB submarines were slightly larger than the original Type IX submarines, later designated IXA. &quot;U-110&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-110&quot; was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a SK C/30 as well as a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight.

==Service history==

&quot;U-110&quot;″s keel was laid down 1 February 1940 by DeSchiMAG AG Weser, of Bremen, Germany as yard number 973. She was launched on 25 August 1940 and commissioned on 21 November with &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Fritz-Julius Lemp in command.

The boat was part of the 2nd U-boat Flotilla from her commissioning date until her loss. Lemp commanded &quot;U-110&quot; for her entire career. In an earlier boat (), he was responsible for the sinking of the passenger liner &quot;SS Athenia&quot; on the first day of the war. The circumstances were such that he was considered for court-martial. He continued, however, to be one of the most successful and rebellious commanders of his day.

==Operational career==

===First patrol===
&quot;U-110&quot; set out on her first patrol from Kiel on 9 March 1941. Her route to the Atlantic Ocean took her through the gap between the Faroe and Shetland Islands. Her first victim was &quot;Erodona&quot; which she damaged south of Iceland on 16 March. She also damaged &quot;Siremalm&quot; on the 23rd. This ship only escaped after she was hit by a torpedo which failed to detonate, (although it left a large dent) and the U-boat&#x27;s 105 mm deck gun crew forgot to remove the tampion in the muzzle before engaging their target. The resulting explosion on firing the first round wounded three men and compelled the boat to fire on the merchantman with the smaller 37 and 20 mm armament. Despite being hit, &quot;Siremalm&quot; successfully fled the scene, zig-zagging as she went.

&quot;U-110&quot; arrived in Lorient on the French Atlantic coast on 29 March, having cut the patrol short due to damage from the exploding gun.

===Second patrol and capture===
The boat departed Lorient on 15 April 1941. On the 27th, she sank &quot;Henri Mory&quot; about west northwest of Blasket Islands, Ireland.

Her next quarry were the ships of convoy OB 318 east of Cape Farewell (Greenland). She successfully attacked and sank &quot;Esmond&quot; and &quot;Bengore Head&quot;, but the escort vessels responded. The British corvette located the U-boat with ASDIC (sonar). &quot;Aubrietia&quot; and British destroyer then proceeded to drop depth charges, forcing &quot;U-110&quot; to surface.

===Operation &quot;Primrose&quot; (9 May 1941)===

&quot;U-110&quot; survived the attack, but was seriously damaged. and &quot;Broadway&quot; remained in contact after &quot;Aubrietia&quot;″s last attack. &quot;Broadway&quot; shaped course to ram, but fired two depth charges beneath the U-boat instead, in an endeavour to make the crew abandon ship before scuttling her. Lemp announced &quot;Last stop, everybody out&quot;, meaning &quot;Abandon ship&quot;. As the crew turned out onto the U-boat&#x27;s deck they came under fire from &quot;Bulldog&quot; and &quot;Broadway&quot; with casualties from gunfire and drowning. The British had believed that the German deck gun was to be used and ceased fire when they realised that the U-boat was being abandoned and the crew wanted to surrender.

Lemp realised that &quot;U-110&quot; was not sinking and attempted to swim back to it to destroy the secret material, and was never seen again. A German eyewitness testified that he was shot in the water by a British sailor, but his fate is not confirmed. Including Lemp, 15 men were killed in the action, and 32 were captured. Radio Officer Georg Högel and the rest of the crew were held at &quot;Camp 23&quot; (Monteith POW camp at Iroquois Falls, Northern Ontario, Canada), which is now the Monteith Correctional Complex.

&quot;Bulldog&quot;″s boarding party, led by Sub-Lieutenant David Balme, got onto &quot;U-110&quot; and stripped it of everything portable, including her Kurzsignale code book and Enigma machine. William Stewart Pollock, a former radio operator in the Royal Navy and on loan to &quot;Bulldog&quot;, was on the second boat to board &quot;U-110&quot;. He retrieved the Enigma machine and books as they looked out of place in the radio room. &quot;U-110&quot; was taken in tow back toward Britain, but sank en route to Iceland.

The documents captured from &quot;U-110&quot; helped Bletchley Park codebreakers solve &quot;Reservehandverfahren&quot;, a reserve German hand cipher.

==Wolfpacks==
&quot;U-110&quot; took part in one wolfpack, West (9 May 1941).
==Modern-day connections==
The 2000 film &quot;U-571&quot; was partially inspired by the capture of &quot;U-110&quot;.

In 2007, the submarine&#x27;s chronometer was featured on the BBC programme &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, from Alnwick Castle, in the possession of the grandson of the captain of the ship which captured her.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-20&quot; was a Type IIB U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. Her keel was laid down on 1 August 1935, by Germaniawerft of Kiel as yard number 550. She was commissioned on 1 February 1936. During World War II, she conducted operations against enemy shipping.

&quot;U-20&quot; went on 16 war patrols, sinking 13 ships totalling and 9 tons , damaging one more of .

==Design==
German Type IIB submarines were enlarged versions of the original Type IIs. &quot;U-20&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. Officially, the standard tonnage was , however. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MWM RS 127 S four-stroke, six-cylinder diesel engines of for cruising, two Siemens-Schuckert PG VV 322/36 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-20&quot; was fitted with three torpedo tubes at the bow, five torpedoes or up to twelve Type A torpedo mines, and a anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of twenty five.

==Operational history==

===First, second and third patrols===
&quot;U-20&quot;″s first three patrols involved observation (in August 1939) and the laying of mines in the North Sea and off the British east coast. She would start in Kiel and finish in Wilhelmshaven; then reverse the process.

===Fourth and fifth patrols===
She sank &quot;Magnus&quot; about east northeast of Peterhead in Scotland. The ship went down in 90 seconds; there was only one survivor. She also sank &quot;Ionian&quot; and &quot;Willowpool&quot; in November and December respectively, with mines laid in November.

The boat sank &quot;Sylvia&quot; northeast of Aberdeen on her fifth sortie on 13 October 1940.

===Sixth to eighth patrols===
&quot;U-20&quot; sank a steady number of ships on her sixth and seventh patrols, (her eighth foray was relatively quiet), but a series of changes were on the way.

She was transferred to the &quot;U-Ausbildungsflottille&quot; as a school boat on 1 May 1940, then the Black Sea, avoiding the heavy British presence at Gibraltar and throughout the Mediterranean by being transported in sections along the Danube to the Romanian port of Galați. She was then re-assembled by the Romanians at the Galați shipyard and sent to her new home in the Black Sea so she could serve with the 30th U-boat Flotilla.

===Ninth and tenth patrols===
The boat&#x27;s first patrol in the new environment, but her ninth overall, almost ended in disaster when she tried to torpedo a Soviet submarine chaser; the vessel responded by dropping eight depth charges. &quot;U-20&quot; was obliged to stay submerged for four hours and returned to base with various mechanical failures.

Near the end of sally number ten, a crew member from who had been taken sick, was transferred to &quot;U-20&quot; on 4 August 1943. The boat docked at Constanta on the seventh.

===11th to 14th patrols===
These patrols were conducted between Constanta and Sevastopol. &quot;U-20&quot; sank the Soviet &quot;Vaijan Kutur&#x27;e&quot; on 16 January 1944 off Cape Anakria.

===15th patrol===
The boat sank &quot;Pestel&quot; on 19 June 1944 off Trabzon. The Soviets reported that this ship was sunk in Turkish territorial waters.

She also sank the Soviet landing craft &quot;DB-26&quot; on 26 June with gunfire and demolition charges.

===16th patrol and fate===
She was scuttled on 10 September 1944, in the Black Sea off the coast of Turkey.

On 3 February 2008, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper reported that &quot;U-20&quot; had been discovered by Selçuk Kolay, a Turkish marine engineer, in of water off the coast of the Turkish city of Karasu.

<text>The bladder () is a hollow organ in humans and other vertebrates that stores urine from the kidneys. In placental mammals, urine enters the bladder via the ureters and exits via the urethra during urination. In humans, the bladder is a distensible organ that sits on the pelvic floor. The typical adult human bladder will hold between 300 and (10 and ) before the urge to empty occurs, but can hold considerably more.

The Latin phrase for &quot;urinary bladder&quot; is &quot;vesica urinaria&quot;, and the term &quot;vesical&quot; or prefix &quot;vesico-&quot; appear in connection with associated structures such as vesical veins. The modern Latin word for &quot;bladder&quot; – &quot;cystis&quot; – appears in associated terms such as cystitis (inflammation of the bladder).

==Structure==

In humans, the bladder is a hollow muscular organ situated at the base of the pelvis. In gross anatomy, the bladder can be divided into a broad (base), a body, an apex, and a neck. The apex (also called the vertex) is directed forward toward the upper part of the pubic symphysis, and from there the median umbilical ligament continues upward on the back of the anterior abdominal wall to the umbilicus. The peritoneum is carried by it from the apex on to the abdominal wall to form the middle umbilical fold. The neck of the bladder is the area at the base of the trigone that surrounds the internal urethral orifice that leads to the urethra. In males, the neck of the urinary bladder is next to the prostate gland.

The bladder has three openings. The two ureters enter the bladder at ureteric orifices, and the urethra enters at the trigone of the bladder. These ureteric openings have mucosal flaps in front of them that act as valves in preventing the backflow of urine into the ureters, known as vesicoureteral reflux. Between the two ureteric openings is a raised area of tissue called the interureteric crest. This makes the upper boundary of the trigone. The trigone is an area of smooth muscle that forms the floor of the bladder above the urethra. It is an area of smooth tissue for the easy flow of urine into and from this part of the bladder - in contrast to the irregular surface formed by the rugae.

The walls of the bladder have a series of ridges, thick mucosal folds known as rugae that allow for the expansion of the bladder. The detrusor muscle is the muscular layer of the wall made of smooth muscle fibers arranged in spiral, longitudinal, and circular bundles. The detrusor muscle is able to change its length. It can also contract for a long time whilst voiding, and it stays relaxed whilst the bladder is filling. The wall of the urinary bladder is normally 3–5 mm thick. When well distended, the wall is normally less than 3 mm.

=== Nearby structures ===
In males, the prostate gland lies outside the opening for the urethra. The middle lobe of the prostate causes an elevation in the mucous membrane behind the internal urethral orifice called the uvula of urinary bladder. The uvula can enlarge when the prostate becomes enlarged.

The bladder is located below the peritoneal cavity near the pelvic floor and behind the pubic symphysis. In males, it lies in front of the rectum, separated by the rectovesical pouch, and is supported by fibres of the levator ani and of the prostate gland. In females, it lies in front of the uterus, separated by the vesicouterine pouch, and is supported by the elevator ani and the upper part of the vagina.

===Blood and lymph supply===
The bladder receives blood by the vesical arteries and drained into a network of vesical veins. The superior vesical artery supplies blood to the upper part of the bladder. The lower part of the bladder is supplied by the inferior vesical artery, both of which are branches of the internal iliac arteries. In females, the uterine and vaginal arteries provide additional blood supply. Venous drainage begins in a network of small vessels on the lower surfaces of the bladder, which coalesce and travel with the lateral ligaments of the bladder into the internal iliac veins.

The lymph drained from the bladder begins in a series of networks throughout the mucosal, muscular and serosal layers. These then form three sets of vessels: one set near the trigone draining the bottom of the bladder; one set draining the top of the bladder; and another set draining the outer undersurface of the bladder. The majority of these vessels drain into the external iliac lymph nodes.

=== Nerve supply ===
The bladder receives both sensory and motor supply from sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. The motor supply from both sympathetic fibers, most of which arise from the superior and inferior hypogastric plexuses and nerves, and from parasympathetic fibers, which come from the pelvic splanchnic nerves.

Sensation from the bladder, relating to distension or to irritation (such as by infection or a stone) is transmitted primarily through the parasympathetic nervous system. These travel via sacral nerves to S2-4. From here, sensation travels to the brain via the dorsal columns in the spinal cord.

===Microanatomy===
When viewed under a microscope, the bladder can be seen to have an inner lining (called epithelium), three layers of muscle fibres, and an outer adventitia.

The inner wall of the bladder is called urothelium, a type of transitional epithelium formed by three to six layers of cells; the cells may become more cuboidal or flatter depending on whether the bladder is empty or full. Additionally, these are lined with a mucous membrane consisting of a surface glycocalyx that protects the cells beneath it from urine. The epithelium lies on a thin basement membrane, and a lamina propria. The mucosal lining also offers a urothelial barrier against the passing of infections.

These layers are surrounded by three layers of muscle fibres arranged as an inner layer of fibres orientated longitudinally, a middle layer of circular fibres, and an outermost layer of longitudinal fibres; these form the detrusor muscle, which can be seen with the naked eye.

The outside of the bladder is protected by a serous membrane called adventitia.

===Development===

In the developing embryo, at the hind end lies a cloaca. This, over the fourth to the seventh week, divides into a urogenital sinus and the beginnings of the anal canal, with a wall forming between these two inpouchings called the urorectal septum. The urogenital sinus divides into three parts, with the upper and largest part becoming the bladder; the middle part becoming the urethra, and the lower part changes depending on the biological sex of the embryo.

The human bladder derives from the urogenital sinus, and it is initially continuous with the allantois. The upper and lower parts of the bladder develop separately and join around the middle part of development. At this time the ureters move from the mesonephric ducts to the trigone. In males, the base of the bladder lies between the rectum and the pubic symphysis. It is superior to the prostate, and separated from the rectum by the recto-vesical pouch. In females, the bladder sits inferior to the uterus and anterior to the vagina; thus its maximum capacity is lower than in males. It is separated from the uterus by the vesico-uterine pouch. In infants and young children the urinary bladder is in the abdomen even when empty.

==Function==
Urine is excreted by the kidneys and flows into the bladder through the ureters, where it is stored until urination (micturition). Urination involves coordinated muscle changes involving a reflex based in the spine, with higher inputs from the brain. During urination, the detrusor muscle contracts, the external urinary sphincter and muscles of the perineum relax, and urine flows through the urethra and exits the penis or vulva through the urinary meatus.

The urge to pass urine stems from stretch receptors that activate when between 300 - 400 mL urine is held within the bladder. As urine accumulates, the rugae flatten and the wall of the bladder thins as it stretches, allowing the bladder to store larger amounts of urine without a significant rise in internal pressure. Urination is controlled by the pontine micturition center in the brainstem.

Stretch receptors in the bladder signal the parasympathetic nervous system to stimulate the muscarinic receptors in the detrusor to contract the muscle when the bladder is distended. This encourages the bladder to expel urine through the urethra. The main receptor activated is the M3 receptor, although M2 receptors are also involved and whilst outnumbering the M3 receptors they are not so responsive.

The main relaxant pathway is via the adenylyl cyclase cAMP pathway, activated via the β3 adrenergic receptors. The β2 adrenergic receptors are also present in the detrusor and even outnumber β3 receptors, but they do not have as important an effect in relaxing the detrusor smooth muscle.

==Clinical significance==
===Inflammation and infection===

Cystitis refers to infection or inflammation of the bladder. It commonly occurs as part of a urinary tract infection. In adults, it is more common in women than men, owing to a shorter urethra. It is common in males during childhood, and in older men where an enlarged prostate may cause urinary retention. Other risk factors include other causes of blockage or narrowing, such as prostate cancer or the presence of vesico-ureteric reflux; the presence of outside structures in the urinary tract, such as urinary catheters; and neurologic problems that make passing urine difficult. Infections that involve the bladder can cause pain in the lower abdomen (above the pubic symphysis, so called &quot;suprapubic&quot; pain), particularly before and after passing urine, and a desire to pass urine frequently and with little warning (urinary urgency). Infections are usually due to bacteria, of which the most common is E coli.

When a urinary tract infection or cystitis is suspected, a medical practitioner may request a urine sample. A dipstick placed in the urine may be used to see if the urine has white blood cells, or the presence of nitrates which may indicate an infection. The urine specimen may be also sent for microbial culture and sensitivity to assess if a particular bacteria grows in the urine, and identify its antibiotic sensitivities. Sometimes, additional investigations may be requested. These might include testing the function of the kidneys by assessing electrolytes and creatinine; investigating for blockages or narrowing of the renal tract with an ultrasound, and testing for an enlarged prostate with a digital rectal examination.

Urinary tract infections or cystitis are treated with antibiotics, many of which are consumed by mouth. Serious infections may require treatment with intravenous antibiotics.

Interstitial cystitis refers to a condition in which the bladder is infected due to a cause that is not bacteria.

===Incontinence and retention===
Frequent urination can be due to excessive urine production, small bladder capacity, irritability or incomplete emptying. Males with an enlarged prostate urinate more frequently. One definition of an overactive bladder is when a person urinates more than eight times per day. An overactive bladder can often cause urinary incontinence. Though both urinary frequency and volumes have been shown to have a circadian rhythm, meaning day and night cycles, it is not entirely clear how these are disturbed in the overactive bladder. Urodynamic testing can help to explain the symptoms. An underactive bladder is the condition where there is a difficulty in passing urine and is the main symptom of a neurogenic bladder. Frequent urination at night may indicate the presence of bladder stones.

Disorders of or related to the bladder include:
* bladder exstrophy
* bladder sphincter dyssynergia, a condition in which the sufferer cannot coordinate relaxation of the urethra sphincter with the contraction of the bladder muscles
* paruresis
* trigonitis
* underactive bladder, a condition with its main symptom being urinary retention.

Disorders of bladder function may be dealt with surgically, by redirecting the flow of urine or by replacement with an artificial urinary bladder. The volume of the bladder may be increased by bladder augmentation. An obstruction of the bladder neck may be severe enough to warrant surgery. Ultrasound can be used to estimate bladder volumes.

===Cancer===

Cancer of the bladder is known as bladder cancer. It is usually due to cancer of the urothelium, the cells that line the surface of the bladder. Bladder cancer is more common after the age of 40, and more common in men than women; other risk factors include smoking and exposure to dyes such as aromatic amines and aldehydes. When cancer is present, the most common symptom in an affected person is blood in the urine; a physical medical examination may be otherwise normal, except in late disease. Bladder cancer is most often due to cancer of the cells lining the ureter, called transitional cell carcinoma, although it can more rarely occur as a squamous cell carcinoma if the type of cells lining the urethra have changed due to chronic inflammation, such as due to stones or schistosomiasis.

Investigations performed usually include collecting a sample of urine for an inspection for malignant cells under a microscope, called cytology, as well as medical imaging by a CT urogram or ultrasound. If a concerning lesion is seen, a flexible camera may be inserted into the bladder, called cystoscopy, in order to view the lesion and take a biopsy, and a CT scan will be performed of other body parts (a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis) to look for additional lesions.

Treatment depends on the cancer&#x27;s stage. Cancer present only in the bladder may be removed surgically via cystoscopy; an injection of the chemotherapeutic mitomycin C may be performed at the same time. Cancers that are high grade may be treated with an injection of the BCG vaccine into the bladder wall, and may require surgical removal if it does not resolve. Cancer that is invading through the bladder wall may be managed by complete surgical removal of the bladder (radical cystectomy), with the ureters diverted into a segment of part of ileum connected to a stoma bag on the skin. Prognosis can vary markedly depending on the cancer&#x27;s stage and grade, with a better prognosis associated with tumours found only in the bladder, that are low grade, that do not invade through the bladder wall, and that is in visual appearance.

===Investigation===
A number of investigations are used to examine the bladder. The investigations that are ordered will depend on the taking of a medical history and an examination. The examination may involve a medical practitioner feeling in the suprapubic area for tenderness or fullness that might indicate an inflamed or full bladder. Blood tests may be ordered that may indicate inflammation; for example a full blood count may demonstrate elevated white blood cells, or a C-reactive protein may be elevated in an infection.

Some forms of medical imaging exist to visualise the bladder. A bladder ultrasound may be conducted to view how much urine is within the bladder, indicating urinary retention. A urinary tract ultrasound, conducted by a more trained operator, may be conducted to view whether there are stones, tumours or sites of obstruction within the bladder and urinary tract. A CT scan may also be ordered.

A flexible internal camera, called a cystoscope, can be inserted to view the internal appearance of the bladder and take a biopsy if required.

Urodynamic testing can help to explain the symptoms.

==Other animals==
=== Mammals ===

All species of mammal have a urinary bladder. This structure begins as an embryonic cloaca. In the vast majority of species, it eventually becomes differentiated into a dorsal part, connected to the intestine, and a ventral part, associated with the urinogenital passage and urinary bladder. The only mammals in which this does not take place are the platypus and the spiny anteater, both of which retain the cloaca into adulthood.

The mammalian bladder is an organ that regularly stores a hyperosmotic concentration of urine. It therefore is relatively impermeable and has a multi-layer epithelium. The urinary bladders of cetaceans (whales and dolphins) are proportionally smaller than those of land-dwelling mammals.

=== Reptiles ===
In all reptiles, the urinogenital ducts and the rectum both empty into the organ called the cloaca. In some reptiles, a midventral wall in the cloaca opens into a urinary bladder. The urinary bladder exists in all species of turtle and tortoise and most species of lizard. Monitor lizards, the legless lizards, snakes, alligators, and crocodiles do not have urinary bladders.

Many turtles, tortoises, and lizards have proportionally very large bladders. Charles Darwin noted that the bladder of the Galapagos tortoise could store urine weighing up to 20% of the tortoise&#x27;s body weight. Such adaptations are the result of environments, such as remote islands and deserts, where fresh water is very scarce. Other desert-dwelling reptiles have large bladders, which can hold long-term reserves of water for several months and aid in osmoregulation.

Turtles have two or more accessory urinary bladders, beside the neck of the urinary bladder and above the pubis, occupying much of the body cavity. Turtles&#x27; bladder is also usually divided into two lobes: the right lobe is under the liver, which prevents large stones from remaining in the lobe; the left lobe is likelier than the right to have calculi.

=== Amphibians ===
Most aquatic and semi-aquatic amphibians can absorb water directly through their skin. Some semi-aquatic animals also have similarly permeable bladder membranes. They tend to have high rates of urine production, to offset this high water intake; and the dissolved salts in their urine are highly dilute. The urinary bladder helps these animals to retain salts. Some aquatic amphibians, such as &quot;Xenopus&quot;, do not reabsorb water from their urine, to prevent excessive water influx. For land-dwelling amphibians, dehydration results in reduced urine output.

The amphibian bladder is usually highly distensible; among some land-dwelling species of frogs and salamanders, it may account for 20%–50% of total body weight. Urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters into the bladder and is periodically released from the bladder to the cloaca.

=== Fish ===
The gills of most teleost fish help to eliminate ammonia from the body, and fish live surrounded by water, but most still have a distinct bladder for storing waste fluid. The urinary bladder of teleosts is permeable to water, though this is less true for freshwater dwelling species than saltwater species. In freshwater fish the bladder is a key site of absorption for many major ions in marine fish urine is held in the bladder for extended periods to maximise water absorption. The urinary bladders of fish and tetrapods are thought to be analogous while the former&#x27;s swim-bladders and latter&#x27;s lungs are considered homologous.

Most fish also have an organ called a swim-bladder which is unrelated to the urinary bladder except in its membranous nature. The loaches, pilchards, and herrings are among the few types of fish in which a urinary bladder is poorly developed. It is largest in those fish which lack an air bladder, and is situated in front of the oviducts and behind the rectum. 

=== Birds ===

In nearly all bird species, there is no urinary bladder per se. Although all birds have kidneys, the ureters open directly into a cloaca which serves as a reservoir for urine, fecal matter, and eggs.

=== Crustaceans ===
Unlike the urinary bladder of vertebrates, the urinary bladder of crustaceans both stores and modifies urine. The bladder consists of two sets of lateral and central lobes. The central lobes sit near the digestive organs and the lateral lobes extend along the front and sides of the crustacean&#x27;s body cavity. The tissue of the bladder is thin epithelium.

<text>U-571 is a 2000 submarine film directed by Jonathan Mostow from a screenplay he co-wrote with Sam Montgomery and David Ayer. The film stars Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi, Jake Weber and Matthew Settle. The film follows a World War II German submarine boarded by American submariners to capture her Enigma cipher machine.

Although the film was financially successful and received generally positive reviews from critics, winning the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing, the fictitious plot attracted substantial criticism. British sailors from captured the first naval Enigma machine from in the North Atlantic in May 1941, seven months before the United States entered the war and three years before the US Navy captured and its Enigma machine. Anger over the film’s inaccuracies reached the House of Commons, where the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, called the film an &quot;affront&quot; to British sailors.

==Plot==
In May 1942, during the Battle of the Atlantic, after sinking a British merchant ship, German U-boat &quot;U-571&quot; has her engines badly damaged by depth charges from a British destroyer, with all of their engineers and mechanics killed in a flash fire. &quot;U-571&quot; skipper &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Günther Wassner makes a distress call that is intercepted by American intelligence. The US Navy has its submarine &quot;S-33&quot; modified to resemble a German resupply U-boat, to try to steal the Enigma machine coding device and sink the &quot;U-571&quot;. Before the crew of &quot;S-33&quot; receives its assignment, the submarine&#x27;s executive officer Lieutenant Tyler is unhappy about a recommendation for command of his own submarine being blocked by his commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Dahlgren who tells Tyler that even though he has the qualifications, Tyler cannot make immediate, even questionable, orders without hesitation, which Dahlgren believes is a crucial quality that a submarine captain needs to have.

During a storm, &quot;S-33&quot; boarding party surprises and overwhelms the crew of &quot;U-571&quot;. After securing &quot;U-571&quot;, the American &quot;S-33&quot; is torpedoed by the arriving German resupply submarine. A dying Dahlgren, in the sea, orders Tyler on the captured U-boat immediately to submerge, along with the remaining crew on board: Chief Keough, Lt. Hirsch from Naval Intelligence, and seamen Mazzola, Tank, Rabbit, Trigger and Wentz. Tyler dives &quot;U-571&quot; below the surface, where they subsequently engage and sink the resupply submarine.

They find two survivors: the cook from the &quot;S-33&quot;, Eddie, and Wassner, who claims to be an electrician. After Tank makes repairs and gets the sub operating again, Tyler decides to route the disabled submarine toward Land&#x27;s End. They are spotted by a German reconnaissance plane and a German destroyer approaches. Wassner escapes captivity and kills Mazzola, but he is subdued by Eddie and Tyler. The destroyer sends over some crew, but Tyler gives orders to Wentz and Rabbit to fire a shot from the deck gun, which destroys the ship&#x27;s radio room, preventing it from reporting the situation and revealing that the Allies have the Enigma. The submarine then dives beneath the German destroyer, which begins to drop depth charges. Tyler attempts to deceive the destroyer into stopping its attack, by ejecting debris and Mazzola&#x27;s corpse out of a torpedo tube, faking their own destruction. &quot;U-571&quot; goes down to , and is damaged by high water pressure. They start to sink deeper, and can only reverse this by ascending uncontrollably. Tyler orders Trigger to submerge himself in the bilge underwater to repressurize the single remaining torpedo tube.

Trigger uses an air hose to breathe inside the flooded compartment. He closes the air valve to the stern tube, but finds a second leak, which he can not reach. The crew finds that Wassner, despite being shackled, is using Morse Code to tap out a signal for the submarine to be destroyed, so Hirsch kills him.&quot;U-571&quot; surfaces heavily damaged, unable to fire her last torpedo. The pursuing destroyer fires with her main guns: the damage pins Trigger&#x27;s legs when he is beyond reach of the air hose. Unable to turn back, he manages to close the valve just before he drowns. Tyler orders Tank to fire the torpedo; the destroyer is unable to take evasive action and is destroyed. With the submarine flooding, the crew abandons her with the Enigma in their possession. They watch &quot;U-571&quot; sink. They are later found by a US Navy PBY Catalina flying boat.

==Production==

&quot;U-571&quot; was filmed in the Mediterranean, near Rome and Malta. Footage, sets and models from the movie have been reused for other productions, including &quot;Submerged&quot;, depicting the loss of , and the fictional &quot;Ghostboat&quot;. A non-diving replica of the US submarine &quot;S-33&quot; is located in Grand Harbour, Valletta.

In the US the film was originally rated &quot;R&quot;, because of a scene where Lt. Emmett is beheaded by flying debris. To get a &quot;PG-13&quot;, the shot was redone with Emmett instead knocked overboard. This left the audience not knowing what had happened to his character. A death scene was also filmed for Major Coonan, but the effect did not work well, so it was cut.

==Critical reception==
The film was generally well received by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 68% based on 117 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The consensus reads: &quot;Excellent cinematography and an interesting plot accompanied by a talented cast and crew make &quot;U-571&quot; a tense thriller.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. It performed well at the box office.

However, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two out of four stars, writing, &quot;&quot;U-571&quot; is a clever wind-up toy of a movie, almost a trailer for a video game. Compared to &quot;Das Boot&quot; or &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot;, it&#x27;s thin soup. The characters are perfunctory, the action is recycled straight out of standard submarine formulas, and there is one shot where a man is supposed to be drowning and you can just about see he&#x27;s standing on the bottom of the studio water tank.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
The film was nominated for two awards at the 73rd Academy Awards: Best Sound (Steve Maslow, Gregg Landaker, Rick Kline and Ivan Sharrock) and Best Sound Editing. It won the sound editing award, while losing the sound award to &quot;Gladiator&quot;.

==Historical inaccuracies==

The film does not portray any historical event. The British Royal Navy had captured the first naval Enigma machine in May 1941, before the US had entered the war. The American portrayal offended some of the British military and public. The Allies captured Enigma-related codebooks and machines about fifteen times during the War; all but two of these by British forces. The Royal Canadian Navy captured &quot;U-744&quot; in March 1944 and the US Navy Coast Guard Cutter USS Campbell seized in June 1944. By this time, the Allies were already routinely decoding German naval Enigma traffic.

On the film&#x27;s release, Labour MP Brian Jenkins used Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions in June 2000 to state that the film was an &quot;affront to the memories of the British sailors who lost their lives on this action.&quot; Prime Minister Tony Blair said, &quot;I agree entirely with what you say... we hope that people realise these are people that, in many cases, sacrificed their lives in order that this country remained free.&quot; Paul Truswell, for the constituency of Pudsey, a town closely associated with , wrote to the US president Bill Clinton, who acknowledged that the film&#x27;s plot was only a work of fiction. The director of the local Horsforth Museum lamented the rewriting of history, saying: &quot;You can&#x27;t rewrite history and we have to pass on the facts to the younger generation through the schools.&quot;

The first capture of a naval Enigma machine with its cipher keys from a U-boat was made on 9 May 1941 by of the Royal Navy, commanded by Captain Joe Baker-Cresswell assisted by HMS &quot;Aubrietia&quot;. The U-boat was . In 1942, the Royal Navy also seized , capturing additional Enigma codebooks. According to Britain&#x27;s Channel 4, &quot;the captured codebooks provided vital assistance to British cryptographers such as Alan Turing, at the code-breaking facility of Bletchley Park.&quot;

The United States&#x27;s involvement in the European theatre of the Second World War did not commence until mid-1941 with Lend-Lease, and direct, open participation did not begin until the US Navy began engaging the Kriegsmarine in the fall of 1941, months before Pearl Harbor, by which time Enigma machines had already been captured and their codes broken in Europe. An earlier military Enigma had been examined by Polish Intelligence in 1928; the Polish Cipher Bureau broke the Enigma code in 1932 and gave their findings to Britain and France in 1939, just before the German invasion of Poland.

Sub Lt. David Balme, the Royal Navy officer who led the boarding party on &quot;U-110&quot;, called &quot;U-571&quot; &quot;a great film&quot; and said that it would not have been financially viable without being &quot;americanised&quot;. The film&#x27;s producers did not agree to his request for a statement that it was a work of fiction, but the end credits dedicate the film to the &quot;Allied sailors and officers who risked their lives capturing Enigma materials&quot; during the Second World War. The credits acknowledge the Royal Navy&#x27;s role in capturing Enigma machines and code documents from &quot;U-110&quot;, &quot;U-559&quot; and the US Navy&#x27;s capture of &quot;U-505&quot;.

In 2006, screenwriter David Ayer admitted that &quot;U-571&quot; had distorted history, and said that he would not do it again. He told BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Film Programme&quot; that he &quot;did not feel good&quot; about suggesting that Americans, rather than the British, had captured the naval Enigma cipher: &quot;It was a distortion...a mercenary decision...to create this parallel history in order to drive the film for an American audience. Both my grandparents were officers in the Second World War, and I would be personally offended if somebody distorted their achievements.&quot;

===Technical inaccuracies===
The Kriegsmarine destroyers rarely ventured out into the open Atlantic Ocean, but usually stayed in European coastal waters. During the destroyer&#x27;s depth charge attack more than eighty depth charges are detonated in the film, despite the fact that they rarely carried more than thirty.

The German resupply U-boat would most likely not have been sunk by &quot;U-571&quot;. This would have been difficult for a German U-boat to achieve, as German sonar was not as advanced as British during the war. The only instance of a submerged submarine sinking another submerged vessel was in February 1945 when sank with torpedoes.

German Type XIV supply U-boats or &quot;Milchkühe&quot; (&quot;milk cows&quot;) did not have torpedo tubes or deck guns, being armed only with anti-aircraft guns for defense, and therefore could not have attacked other vessels.

A character mentions sinking in a test dive. The real &quot;S-26&quot; did not sink in a test dive, instead sinking in a collision with a patrol combatant, , in January 1942.

===Portrayal of U-boat sailors===
The film portrays U-boat sailors machine-gunning Allied merchant crewmen who have survived their ship&#x27;s sinking, so that they are not able to report the U-boat&#x27;s position. In reality, U-boat crewmen are far more often known to have assisted survivors with food, directions and occasionally medical aid. Such assistance only stopped after Admiral Karl Dönitz issued the &quot;Laconia order&quot; following a US air attack on U-boats transporting injured survivors under a Red Cross flag in 1942. German U-boat crews were thereafter under War Order No. 154 not to rescue survivors, which parallelled Allied policy. Afterward, U-boats still occasionally provided aid for survivors. In fact, out of several thousand of sinkings of merchant ships in World War II, there is only one verifiable case of a U-boat&#x27;s crew deliberately attacking the survivors: that of after the sinking of the Greek ship &quot;Peleus&quot; in 1944.

===Actual fates of &quot;U-571&quot;, &quot;S-33&quot; and &quot;Z-49&quot;===
The actual , captained by &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Gustav Lüssow, was never involved in any such events, was not captured, but was in fact lost with all hands on 28 January 1944, west of Ireland. She was hit by depth charges, dropped from a Short Sunderland Mk III flying boat, &quot;EK577&quot;, callsign &quot;D for Dog&quot;, belonging to No. 461 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and based at RAF Pembroke Dock in Wales. The aircraft&#x27;s commander, Flt Lt Richard Lucas, reported that most of the U-boat&#x27;s 52 crew managed to abandon ship, but all died from hypothermia.

The real was stationed in the Pacific Ocean from June 1942 until the end of the war. She was sold for scrap in 1946.

The Kriegsmarine destroyer &quot;Z-49&quot; was ordered on 12 June 1943 but never laid down, let alone completed and sailed.

<text>United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA, ) was an international relief agency founded in November 1943 on the joint initiative of the United States, United Kingdom, USSR, and the Republic of China. Its purpose was to &quot;plan, co-ordinate, administer or arrange for the administration of measures for the relief of victims of war in any area under the control of any of the United Nations through the provision of food, fuel, clothing, shelter and other basic necessities, medical and other essential services&quot;. 70% of the aid originated with the United States, but 44 different countries participated in the relief in Europe and Asia. It was dissolved in September 1948. it became part of the United Nations in 1945. 
Its staff of civil servants included 12,000 people, with headquarters in New York. Funding came from many nations, and totalled $3.7 billion, of which the United States contributed $2.7 billion; Britain, $625 million; and Canada, $139 million.

UNRRA cooperated closely with dozens of volunteer charitable organizations, who sent hundreds of their own staff to work alongside UNRRA. In operation for only four years, the agency distributed about $4 billion worth of goods, food, medicine, tools, and farm implements at a time of severe global shortages and worldwide transportation difficulties. The recipient nations had been especially hard hit by starvation, dislocation, and political chaos. It played a major role in helping Displaced persons return to their home countries in Europe in 1945–46.

Many of its functions were transferred to several UN agencies, including the International Refugee Organization and the World Health Organization. As an American relief project, it was later replaced by the Marshall Plan, which began operations in 1948. However, the historian Jessica Reinisch has proposed that UNRRA should not just figure as a chapter in U.S. history, but rather that UNRRA was unique in that it managed to bring together very different partners and models of international relief, each of which had their own history and antecedents.

== Founding and authority ==
The First World War displaced more refugees than in Europeans&#x27; living memory, first from Belgium in 1914, later in eastern Europe, cf. the civil wars and new national boundaries of 1917–19. Relief was undertaken largely by private charities, often American as organized by Herbert Hoover. The Second World War seemed likely to create still more refugees, prompting governments to act: U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt proposed the agency in June 1943, to provide relief to areas liberated from Axis Powers when the fighting ended. Roosevelt had already obtained the approval of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China; he later obtained endorsements from 40 other governments to form the first &quot;United Nations&quot; organization.

The Agreement for United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration founding document was signed by 44 countries in the White House in Washington on 9 November 1943. UNRRA was headed by a Director-General and governed by a Council (composed of representatives of all state parties) with a Central Committee representing the United States, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union. The other countries who signed the agreement included: Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ethiopia, the French Committee of National Liberation, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Iceland, India, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia.


Although the UNRRA was called a &quot;United Nations&quot; agency, it was established prior to the founding of the United Nations. The explanation for this is that the term &quot;United Nations&quot; was used at the time to refer to the Allies of World War II, having been originally coined for that purpose by Roosevelt in 1942.

Although initially restricted by its constitution to render aid only to nationals from the United Nations (the Allies), this was changed late in 1944, in response to pleas from Jewish organizations who were concerned with the fate of surviving Jews of German nationality, to also include &quot;other persons who have been obliged to leave their country or place of origin or former residence or who have been deported therefrom by action of the enemy because of race, religion or activities in favor of the United Nations.&quot;

UNRRA operated in occupied Germany, primarily in camps for displaced persons, especially the 11,000,000 non-Germans who had been moved into Germany during the war, but did not render assistance to ethnic Germans.

In Asia, the organization provided assistance in the Dutch East Indies, Korea, and China (including Taiwan). China was the largest recipient of funds.

UNRRA Headquarters was in Washington, D.C., and the European Regional Office was set up in London. The organization was subject to the authority of the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF) in Europe and was directed by three Americans during the four years of its existence:

* Herbert Lehman (1 January 1944−31 March 1946), former Governor of New York
* Fiorello La Guardia (1 April−31 December 1946), former Mayor of New York, who later learned that his sister Gemma and other relatives had been imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps 
* Lowell Ward Rooks (1 January 1947−30 September 1948)

== Operations ==
UNRRA funds became a point of tension in the relations between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist government of China when Chiang pushed to control the disposition of funds in China to ensure that relief funds did not go to the Communist-governed areas of the country. These tensions worsened during the Chinese Civil War.

By 1947, UNRRA was running nearly 800 resettlement camps, housing over 700,000 people. Forty-four nations contributed to funding, supplying, and staffing the agency, of which the United States was the leading donor. The largest recipients of UNRRA commodity aid, in millions of US dollars were China, $518; Poland $478; Italy $418; Yugoslavia $416; Greece $347; Czechoslovakia $261; Ukraine (USSR) $188; and Austria $136. A number of academic assessments state that UNRRA was not perfect and was troubled by inefficiency, poor planning, shortages of supplies, and some incompetent personnel. On balance however, many argue that it was a major success in terms of delivering aid, food, and medicine, and helping Europe on the path to recovery, especially Eastern and Southern Europe.

==In popular culture==
The activities of the UNRRA, as well as the plight of displaced orphans in post-war Europe, is portrayed in Fred Zinnemann’s contemporaneous film The Search. The child actor in the film, Ivan Jandl, was awarded a special Academy Juvenile Award and a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal of Karel Malik. Jandl was prohibited from attending either ceremony by the Czech communist government.

<text>The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA, ) is a UN agency that supports the relief and human development of Palestinian refugees. UNRWA&#x27;s mandate encompasses Palestinians who fled or were expelled during the Nakba, the 1948 Palestine War, and subsequent conflicts, as well as their descendants, including legally adopted children. As of 2019, more than 5.6 million Palestinians are registered with UNRWA as refugees.

UNRWA was established in 1949 by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) to provide relief to all refugees resulting from the 1948 conflict; this initially included Jewish and Arab Palestine refugees inside the State of Israel until the Israeli government took over this responsibility in 1952. As a subsidiary body of the UNGA, UNRWA&#x27;s mandate is subject to periodic renewal every three years; it has consistently been extended since its founding, most recently until 30 June 2026.

UNRWA employs over 30,000 people, most of them Palestinian refugees, and a small number of international staff. Originally intended to provide employment and direct relief, its mandate has broadened to include providing education, health care, and social services to its target population. UNRWA operates in five areas: Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem; aid for Palestinian refugees outside these five areas is provided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950 as the main agency to aid all other refugees worldwide. UNRWA is the only UN agency dedicated to helping refugees from a specific region or conflict.

UNRWA has received praise and recognition for its work by various governments, public figures, and independent monitors. It has also been subject to controversy related to its operations, role in the Gaza Strip, relationship with Hamas, and textbook content. Most recently, the agency faced allegations by the Israeli government that twelve of its employees were involved in the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, leading to lay-offs, an investigation, and the temporary suspension of funding by numerous donors. As of May 2024, several major donors have since resumed funding as the investigation remains ongoing. In October 2024, Israel&#x27;s parliament passed a bill designating UNRWA as a terrorist group and prohibiting it from operating within the country. Israel has long opposed the Palestinian right of return and has accused UNRWA of &quot;perpetuating the refugee issue&quot;. In January 2025, Israel&#x27;s UNRWA ban went into effect.

==History and operations==


Following the outbreak of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight of Palestinian Arabs, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 212 (III), dated 19 November 1948, which established the UN Relief for Palestine Refugees (UNRPR) to provide emergency relief to Palestine refugees in coordination with other UN or humanitarian agencies. In response to the political aspects of the conflict, less than a month later the General Assembly adopted Resolution 194, creating the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine (UNCCP), mandated to help achieve a final settlement between the warring parties, including facilitating &quot;the repatriation, resettlement and economic and social rehabilitation of the refugees&quot; in collaboration with the UNRPR. By that time, the conflict had displaced over 700,000 people.

Unable to resolve the &quot;Palestine problem&quot; which required political solutions beyond the scope of its mandate, the UNCCP recommended the creation of a &quot;United Nations agency designed to continue relief activities and initiate job-creation projects&quot; while an ultimate resolution was pending. Pursuant to this recommendation and to paragraph 11 of Resolution 194 which concerned refugees, on 8 December 1949 the General Assembly adopted Resolution 302(IV) which established the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The resolution was adopted and passed unopposed, supported by Israel and the Arab states with only the Soviet bloc and South Africa abstaining.

UNRWA succeeded the UNRPR with a broader mandate for humanitarian assistance and development and the requirement to function neutrally. When it began operations in 1950 the initial scope of its work was &quot;direct relief and works programmes&quot; to Palestine refugees in order to &quot;prevent conditions of starvation and distress… and to further conditions of peace and stability&quot;. UNRWA&#x27;s mandate was expanded in December 1950 through Resolution 393(V) which instructed the agency to &quot;establish a reintegration fund which shall be utilized ... for the permanent re-establishment of refugees and their removal from relief&quot;. A 26 January 1952 resolution allocated four times as much funding on reintegration than on relief, requesting UNRWA to otherwise continue providing programs for health care, education, and general welfare.

===Definition of refugee ===
UNRWA has developed its own working definition of &quot;refugee&quot; to allow it to provide humanitarian assistance. Its definition does not cover final status.

Palestine refugees are &quot;persons whose regular place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict.&quot;

The Six-Day War of 1967 generated a new wave of Palestinian refugees who could not be included in the original UNRWA definition. Since 1991, the UN General Assembly has adopted an annual resolution allowing the 1967 refugees within the UNRWA mandate. UNRWA&#x27;s &quot;mandate&quot; is not a single document but the sum of all relevant resolutions and requests of the General Assembly. While focused on Palestine refugees, it also extends to persons displaced by &quot;the 1967 and subsequent hostilities&quot; and occasionally to a broader cross-section of the local community. Several categories of persons have long been registered as eligible to receive UNRWA services although not &quot;Palestine refugees&quot;. The descendants of Palestine refugee males, including adopted children, are also eligible for registration as refugees.

==Organisation and mandate==
UNRWA is a subsidiary organ of the United Nations General Assembly, established pursuant to Articles 7(2) and 22 of the UN Charter. It is one of two UN agencies that reports directly to the General Assembly. The scope and renewal of UNRWA&#x27;s mandate is determined primarily by resolutions of the General Assembly; unlike other UN agencies, such as the World Health Organization or the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, it lacks a constitution or statute. The mandate may also be shaped by requests from other UN organs, such as the Secretary-General. The General Assembly passes a series of resolutions annually that address UNRWA&#x27;s responsibilities, functions, and budget. As it is technically a temporary organisation, the agency&#x27;s mandate is extended every three years.

UNRWA is led by a Commissioner-General—since 8 March 2020 Philippe Lazzarini of Switzerland—an Under-Secretary-General of the UN responsible for managing all of the agency&#x27;s activities and personnel. The Commissioner-General selects and appoints all the agency&#x27;s staff, pursuant to internal rules and regulations, and reports directly to the General Assembly. UNRWA&#x27;s operations are organised into five fields—Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, West Bank, and Gaza—each led by a director who is in charge of distributing humanitarian aid and overseeing general UNRWA operations. The agency&#x27;s headquarters are divided between the Gaza Strip and Amman, with the latter hosting the Deputy Commissioner-General, currently Leni Stenseth of Norway, who administers departmental activities such as education, healthcare, and finance. UNRWA is the largest agency of the United Nations, employing over 30,000 staff, 99% of which are locally recruited Palestinians. 

=== Advisory Commission ===
Concurrent with the creation of UNRWA, the UN General Assembly established an Advisory Commission (AdCom) to assist the Commissioner-General in carrying out UNRWA&#x27;s mandate. Created with four members, the AdCom currently has 28 members and four observers. Membership is obtained via General Assembly resolutions, with all host countries of Palestinian refugees (Jordan, Syria, Lebanon) sitting on the commission followed by the 24 leading donors and supporters of UNRWA. Palestine, the European Union, and the League of Arab States have had observer status since 2005, with the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation joining as an observer in 2019.

Members of the AdCom, including the year they joined, are: Australia (2005), Belgium (1953), Brazil (2014), Canada (2005), Denmark (2005), Egypt (1949), Finland (2008), France (1949), Germany (2005), Ireland (2008), Italy (2005), Japan (1973), Jordan (1949), Kazakhstan (2013), Kuwait (2010), Lebanon (1953), Luxembourg (2012), Netherlands (2005), Norway (2005), Qatar (2018), Saudi Arabia (2005), Spain (2005), Sweden (2005), Switzerland (2005), Syria (1949), Turkey (1949), United Arab Emirates (2014), the United Kingdom (1949), and the United States (1949).

The Advisory Commission is led by a chair and a vice-chair, representing a host country and a donor country, respectively. Each is appointed annually in June from among the Commission members according to the alphabetical rotation, serving for one year beginning 1 July. At each appointment, the chair will alternate between a host and a donor country.

The AdCom meets twice a year, usually in June and November, to discuss important issues of UNRWA and develop a consensus-based guidance for the Commissioner-General. Additionally, members and observers convene more regularly through sub-committee meetings. The AdCom also conducts periodic field visits to UNRWA&#x27;s area of operations.

===Areas of operation===
UNRWA services are available to all registered Palestine refugees living in its area of operations who need assistance. When UNRWA began operations in 1950, it was responding to the needs of about 700,000 Palestinian refugees. By 2023, some 5.9 million people were registered as eligible for UNRWA services. UNRWA provides facilities in 59 recognized refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, and in other areas where large numbers of registered Palestine refugees live outside of recognized camps.

For a camp to be recognized by UNRWA, there must be an agreement between the host government and UNRWA governing the use of the camp. UNRWA does not itself run camps, has no police powers or administrative role, but simply provides services in the camp. Refugee camps, which developed from tent cities to dense urban dwellings similar to their urban surroundings, house around one-third of all registered Palestine refugees.

==Funding==

UNRWA&#x27;s budget is set by the UN General Assembly and derives almost entirely from voluntary contributions by UN member states. It also receives some revenue from the regular UN budget, mostly for international staffing costs. In addition to its regular budget, UNRWA receives funding for emergency activities and special projects, such as in response to the Syrian civil war and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Historically, most of the agency&#x27;s funds came from the United States and the European Commission; in 2019, close to 60 percent of its pledge of $1 billion came from EU countries, with Germany being the largest individual donor. The next largest donors were the EU, United Kingdom, Sweden, and the United Arab Emirates, followed by Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Qatar, and the Netherlands. UNRWA also establishes partnerships with nongovernmental donors, including nonprofit &quot;national committees&quot; based in donor countries.

The voluntary nature of UNRWA funding has led to budgetary problems due to acute emergencies or political developments in donor countries. In 2009, officials spoke of a &quot;dire financial crisis&quot;, including a funding shortfall of $200 million, in the wake of the Israeli offensive in Gaza. In August 2018, the U.S. ceased its contributions, arguing that UNRWA&#x27;s mandate should be reduced to the few hundred thousand Palestinians alive when the agency was created. The U.S. decision resulted in the loss of $300 million out of the $1.2 billion budget, contributing to an overall deficit of $446 million. The shortfall was covered with increased contributions from elsewhere.

In mid-2019, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland temporarily suspended funding to UNRWA, citing ethics report that alleged mismanagement, corruption, and discrimination among the agency&#x27;s leadership. In December 2019, the Netherlands restored its funding, increasing its donation by €6 million for 2019, to €19 million. The EU increased its contribution from €82 million ($92.2 million) by €21 million ($23.3 million), and Germany agreed to fund four new UNRWA projects, totaling €59 million ($65.6 million). Qatar increased its donation for Palestinians in Syria by $20.7 million, bringing the 2019 total to $40 million.

The funding situation for 2019 and beyond was discussed in April at a &quot;Ministerial Strategic Dialogue&quot; attended by representatives from Egypt, France, Germany, Japan, Kuwait, Norway, United Kingdom, the European External Action Service, and the European Commission. At the annual meeting of the General Assembly that year, a high-level ministerial meeting was held regarding UNRWA funding. In July 2020 Commissioner-General Lazzarini warned that UNRWA&#x27;s budget was &quot;not sustainable&quot;, with shortfalls in four out of the five previous years, and funding at its lowest point since 2012. According to the World Bank, for all countries receiving more than $2 billion in international aid in 2012, Gaza and the West Bank received a per capita aid budget over double the next largest recipient, at a rate of $495.

In January 2010, the Government of Canada announced that it was redirecting aid previously earmarked to UNRWA to projects under the Palestinian Authority. Previously, Canada provided UNRWA with 11 percent of its budget at $10 million (Canadian) annually. The decision came despite positive internal evaluations of the Agency by CIDA officials. The 2010 Canadian decision put it very much at odds with the US and EU, which maintained or increased their levels of funding. Some suggested that the decision also cost Canada international support in its failed October 2010 effort to obtain a seat on the UN Security Council. Documents obtained from CIDA revealed that even the government of Israel opposed the Canadian move which had asked Canada to resume contributions to UNRWA&#x27;s General Fund.

EU suspended funding for UNRWA in January 2024 but reinstated the funding later on March 1, 2024. In 2024, the Swiss National Council voted to cut finding to UNWRA, citing concerns of antisemitism and connections to terrorism; the legislation will need to pass Council of States to go into effect.

==Operations==
UNRWA provides a wide variety of social and humanitarian services, as determined by resolutions of the UN General Assembly. Since its initial establishment in 1949, its operations have expanded beyond immediate relief and social services; as of 2019, the bulk of its budget is spent on education (58 percent), followed by health care (15 percent), and general support services (13 percent).

=== Education programme ===
Education is UNRWA&#x27;s largest area of activity, accounting for more than half its regular budget and the majority of its staff. It operates one of the largest school systems in the Middle East, spanning 711 elementary and preparatory schools, eight vocational and technical schools, and two teacher training institutes. It has been the main provider of basic education to Palestinian refugee children since 1950. Free basic education is available to all registered refugee children, currently numbering 526,000. In the 1960s, UNRWA schools became the first in the region to achieve full gender equality, and a slight majority of enrolled students are female.

Half the Palestine refugee population is under 25. Overcrowded classrooms containing 40 or even 50 pupils are common. Almost three-quarters run on a double-shift system, where two separate groups of pupils and teachers share the same buildings, thus reducing teaching time. The school year is often interrupted by conflicts, prompting UNRWA to develop a special programme that provides education in emergency situations.

Per the longstanding agreement, UNRWA schools follow the curriculum of their host countries. This allows UNRWA pupils to progress to further education or employment holding locally recognised qualifications and complies with the sovereignty requirements of countries hosting refugees. Wherever possible, UNRWA students take national exams conducted by the host governments.

===Relief and social services programme===
UNRWA provides food aid, cash assistance, and help with shelter repairs to these families. In addition, children from special hardship case families are given preferential access to the Agency&#x27;s vocational training centres, while women in such families are encouraged to join UNRWA&#x27;s women&#x27;s programme centres. In these centres, training, advice, and childcare are available to encourage female refugees&#x27; social development. In Palestinian refugee society, families without a male head of household are often vulnerable. Those headed by a widow, a divorcee, or a disabled father often live in dire poverty. These families are considered &quot;hardship cases&quot; and constitute less than 6% of UNRWA beneficiaries.

UNRWA has created community-based organizations (CBOs) to target women, refugees with disabilities, and to look after the needs of children. The CBOs now have their own management committees staffed by volunteers from the community. UNRWA provides them with technical and small sums of targeted financial assistance, but many have formed links of their own with local and international NGOs.

===Health program===
Since 1950, UNRWA has been the main healthcare provider for Palestinian refugees. Basic health needs are met through a network of primary care clinics, providing access to secondary treatment in hospitals, food aid to vulnerable groups, and environmental health in refugee camps.

Key figures for 2014 are:
* 139 primary health facilities based in or near UNRWA settlements/camps
* 3,107 health staff
* 3,134,732 refugees accessing health services
* 9,290,197 annual patient visits

The health of Palestine refugees has long resembled that of many populations in the transition from developing world to developed world status. However, there is now a demographic transition.

People are living longer and developing different needs, particularly those related to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and chronic conditions that require lifelong care, such as diabetes, hypertension, and cancer. A healthy life is a continuum of phases from infancy to old age, each of which has unique, specific needs, and our programme therefore takes a &#x27;life-cycle approach&#x27; to providing its package of preventive and curative health services.

To address the changing needs of Palestine refugees, we undertook a major reform initiative in 2011. We introduced the Family Health Team (FHT) approach, based on the World Health Organization-indicated values of primary health care, in our primary health facilities (PHFs).

The FHT offers comprehensive primary health care services based on wholistic care of the entire family, emphasizing long-term provider-patient relationships and ensuring person-centeredness, comprehensiveness, and continuity. Moreover, the FHT helps address intersectional issues that impact health, such as diet and physical activity, education, gender-based violence, child protection, poverty, and community development.

Medical services include outpatient care, dental treatment, and rehabilitation for the physically disabled. Maternal and child healthcare is a priority for UNRWA&#x27;s health program. School health teams and camp medical officers visit UNRWA schools to examine new pupils to aid early detection of childhood diseases. All UNRWA clinics offer family planning services with counselling that emphasises the importance of birth spacing as a factor in maternal and child health. Agency clinics also supervise the provision of food aid to nursing and pregnant mothers who need it, and six clinics in the Gaza Strip have their own maternity units. Infant mortality rates have for some time been lower among refugees than the World Health Organization&#x27;s benchmark for the developing world.

UNRWA provides refugees with assistance in meeting the costs of hospitalisation either by partially reimbursing them, or by negotiating contracts with government, NGOs, and private hospitals. UNRWA&#x27;s environmental health services program &quot;controls the quality of drinking water, provides sanitation, and carries out vector and rodent control in refugee camps, thus reducing the risk of epidemics.&quot;

===Microfinance Department===
UNRWA&#x27;s Microfinance Department (MD) aims to alleviate poverty and support economic development in the refugee community by providing capital investment and working capital loans at commercial rates. The programme seeks to be as close to self-supporting as possible. It has a strong record of creating employment, generating income, and empowering refugees.

The MD is an autonomous financial unit within UNRWA, established in 1991 to provide microfinance services to Palestine refugees, as well as poor or marginal groups living and working in close proximity to them. With operations in three countries, the MD currently has the broadest regional coverage of any microfinance institution in the Middle East. Having begun its operations in the Palestinian territories, it remains the largest non-bank financial intermediary in the West Bank and Gaza.

Key figures, cumulative as of 2023 are:
* 29,000 number of loans awarded
* US$531.41 million value of loans awarded
* 25% youth outreach
* 48% women outreach

===Emergency operations===

UNRWA takes a wide variety of actions to mitigate the effects of emergencies on the lives of Palestine refugees. Particularly in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (occupied Palestinian territory) there has been ongoing intervention made necessary by, e.g., the 1967 War as well as the first and second intifadas, and the 2014 Gaza War. The reconstruction work at Nahr el-Bared Palestine refugee camp in Lebanon has been the largest reconstruction project ever undertaken by UNRWA. This work began in 2009 and was made necessary when the camp was destroyed in the fighting between the Lebanese Armed Forces and Fatah al-Islam in 2007.

Services range from supplying temporary shelter, water, food, clothing, and blankets to temporary job-creation and help for rebuilding. There is extensive cooperation with other international NGOs and local actors.

===Infrastructure and camp/settlement improvement===
As of 2023, there are 58 official refugee camps for Palestininans, of which nine are undergoing active improvement. 6 million refugees were registered with UNRWA, with 1.37 million in Gaza using a UNRWA camp. The camps are neither owned nor administered by the Agency; host governments are responsible for allocating land (mostly of which is privately owned) and providing security and order. Rather, UNRWA is responsible for operating education, health, relief and social services, microfinance, and emergency assistance programmes, some of which may be located outside the camps.

However, as the camps have gradually transformed from temporary &quot;tent&quot; cities to semi-permanent and dense urban environments, UNRWA has characterized them as &quot;hyper-congested&quot; and &quot;overcrowded&quot; with &quot;critically substandard and in many cases life-threatening&quot; infrastructure. In response, in 2007 the Agency launched the Infrastructure and Camp Improvement Programme (ICIP) to improve spatial and environmental conditions through comprehensive urban planning methods and community engagement. ICIP is implemented differently in each host country based on local needs, resources, and priorities, albeit with a broader focus on rehabilitating or reconstructing existing shelters, building new housing or service centers, providing maintenance, and improving public infrastructure such as sanitation and water drainage.

Following the destruction of much of the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp in northern Lebanon in 2007, resulting from months of fighting between Fatah al-Islam militants and the Lebanese Armed Forces, UNRWA led the initiative to rebuild the camp, in what has become the largest project in its history. As of April 2021, nearly two-thirds (72 percent) of the camp has been reconstructed, including 386 shops and businesses, enabling 3,550 families to return. Special funding has been provided by Saudi Arabia, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United Arab Emirates.

== Assessment and praise ==
UNRWA has received praise from Nobel Peace laureates Mairéad Corrigan Maguire and Kofi Annan, the president of the UN General Assembly, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and representatives from the European Union, the United States, the Netherlands, Japan, Bangladesh, Cyprus, Jordan, Ghana, and Norway, among others. In 2007, the permanent representative of Norway to the United Nations described his country as a &quot;strong supporter&quot; of UNRWA, which acts as &quot;a safety net&quot; for the Palestine refugees, providing them with &quot;immediate relief, basic services and the possibility of a life in dignity&quot;. The same day, the representative of Iceland praised the agency&#x27;s ability to &quot;deliver substantial results&quot; despite &quot;often life-threatening conditions&quot;.

In 2007, Israel expressed its continued support for UNRWA, noting that despite &quot;concerns regarding the politicization&quot; of the agency, the country supports its humanitarian mission.

On 17 January 2024, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller rejected calls to defund UNRWA, saying:UNRWA has done and continues to do invaluable work to address the humanitarian situation in Gaza at great personal risk to UNRWA members. I believe it’s over 100 UNRWA staff members have been killed doing this lifesaving work, and we continue to not only support it but we continue to commend them for the really heroic efforts that they make oftentimes while making the greatest sacrifice.

=== Independent evaluations ===
In 2011, UNRWA agreed to be assessed by the Multilateral Organisation Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN), a network of donor countries established to determine the organisational effectiveness of multilateral organisations. Based on four dimensions of organisational effectiveness—strategic management, operational management, relationship management, and knowledge management—MOPAN concluded that the agency performs adequately or well in most key indicators, particularly within strategic management. UNRWA responded to the result positively, noting that &quot;many of the challenges highlighted in the report reflect challenges within most, if not all, multilateral organisations.&quot; In its most recent assessment in 2019, MOPAN commended UNRWA for continuing to increase the efficiency of its programmes, recognizing the agency as &quot;competent, resilient and resolute&quot;.

==Criticism and controversies==
In 2004, Emanuel Marx and Nitza Nachmias pointed out that many criticisms of the agency corresponded to its age, &quot;including symptoms of inflexibility, resistance to adjust to the changing political environment, and refusal to phase out and transfer its responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority&quot;.

In 2007, UNRWA initiated a reform program to improve efficiency. However, an internal ethics report leaked to &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; in 2019 alleged that, since 2015, the agency&#x27;s senior management have consolidated power at the expense of efficiency, leading to widespread misconduct, nepotism, and other abuses of power among high ranking personnel. Responding to the &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; report, UNRWA issued a statement that both internal and external assessments of its management have been &quot;positive&quot;:A recent report by an external group of experts (MOPAN) [Multilateral Organisation Performance Assessment Network] has just shown satisfactory (and at times very satisfactory) results of UNRWA&#x27;s management and impact - which is particularly important for us during these times of intense political and financial pressure on the agency ... Similarly, the United Nations Board of Auditors recognized the quality of the management and leadership of UNRWA. Finally, the 2018 annual report recently presented by UNRWA&#x27;s Department of Internal Oversight Services and Ethics Division - both independent bodies - to UNRWA&#x27;s Advisory Commission (host countries and largest donors) confirmed these positive assessments. These reports testify to the strength of this Agency and are a matter of public record.

===Mandate===

Some critics of UNRWA have argued that it serves to perpetuate the conflict. Although UNRWA&#x27;s mandate is only for relief works, &quot;The Wall Street Journal Europe&quot;, published an op-ed by Asaf Romirowsky and Alexander H. Joffe in April 2011 saying that &quot;it is hard to claim that the UNRWA has created any Palestinian institutions that foster genuinely civil society. Ideally, the UNRWA would be disbanded and Palestinians given the freedom – and the responsibility – to build their own society.&quot;

The High Commission is mandated to help refugees get on with their lives as quickly as possible and works to settle them rapidly, most frequently in countries other than those they fled. UNRWA policy, however, states that the Palestinian Arabs who fled from Israel in the course of the 1948 war, plus &quot;all of their descendants&quot;, are to be considered refugees until a just and durable solution can be found by political actors. UNRWA was specifically designed &quot;not&quot; to prescribe how the outcome of an agreement would take shape.

James G. Lindsay, a former UNRWA general counsel and fellow researcher for Washington Institute for Near East Policy, published a report for in 2009 in which he criticized UNRWA practices. One of his conclusions was that UNRWA&#x27;s failure to match the UNHCR&#x27;s success in resettling refugees &quot;obviously represents a political decision on the part of the agency&quot; and &quot;seems to favor the strain of Palestinian political thought espoused by those who are intent on a &#x27;return&#x27; to the land that is now Israel&quot;.

===Operations===

====Protection of Palestinian refugees====

Asem Khalil, Associate Professor of Law at Birzeit University and dean of the Faculty of Law and Public Administration, has focused on human rights issues for Palestinians in host countries. After systematically documenting the human rights situation for Palestinians in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, he concludes:

The point this approach is stresses, I believe, is not that UNRWA is not necessary or that Palestinian refugeehood is not unique and special, but rather that UNRWA is not currently capable of ensuring necessary protection for Palestinian refugees, and that host Arab states cannot use the uniqueness of Palestinian refugeehood to continue upholding discriminatory laws and policies towards Palestinian refugees. ...

The global financial crisis may result in decreasing international funds to UNRWA, and UNRWA may be pushed towards reducing its services. Such a scenario will be felt by Palestinian refugees in particular ways, seeing the absence of alternative sources of income and the restrictive laws and policies that exist in some host countries. UNRWA is a main service provider for Palestinian refugees in host countries. It provides jobs for thousands of refugees, education, health care, and various other services that are extremely valuable and necessary.

... The issue at stake here is that UNRWA is not enough, but the alternative is not the replacement of UNRWA by
UNHCR, rather the enhancement of the protection role of UNRWA, or the extension of protection mandate of UNHCR
to Palestinian refugees besides (not instead) existing agencies dealing with Palestinian refugees ...
====Textbook controversy====

In 2005 Nathan Brown, Professor of Political Science at George Washington University, wrote a short but comprehensive review article about textbooks used by Palestinians, focusing especially on changes starting in 1994.
The Oslo agreements resulted in the dismantling of the Israeli office responsible for censorship of textbooks. Administration of the education system for all Palestinian students in the West Bank and Gaza was taken over by the Palestinian Authority. Other Palestinian schools administered by UNRWA in neighboring countries were unaffected. With the end of UNESCO monitoring of the books, UNRWA moved to develop supplementary materials to teach tolerance in the schools it administered.
It is the PA textbooks used in UNRWA schools in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem that have been most extensively studied. The following discussions cannot be generalized to UNRWA schools elsewhere. In the beginning, the PA used books from Jordan and Egypt. In 2000 it started issuing its own books. Brown has pointed out that research into Palestinian textbooks conducted by the Centre for Monitoring the Impact of Peace in 1998 is misleading because it evaluates the old books; and in 2000, its research mixed old and new books. Brown investigated the differences between the new PA books and the ones being replaced.

Regarding the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s new textbooks, he states:

The new books have removed the anti-Semitism present in the older books while they tell history from a Palestinian point of view, they do not seek to erase Israel, delegitimize, it or replace it with the &quot;State of Palestine&quot;; each book contains a foreword describing the West Bank and Gaza as &quot;the two parts of the homeland&quot;; the maps show some awkwardness but do sometimes indicate the 1967 line and take some other measures to avoid indicating borders; in this respect they are actually more forthcoming than Israeli maps; the books avoid treating Israel at length but do indeed mention it by name; the new books must be seen as a tremendous improvement from a Jewish, Israeli, and humanitarian view; they do not compare unfavorably to the material my son was given as a fourth-grade student in a school in Tel Aviv&quot;.

In 2002, the United States Congress requested the United States Department of State to commission a reputable NGO to conduct a review of the new Palestinian curriculum. The Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information (IPCRI) was thereby commissioned by the US Embassy in Tel Aviv and the US Consul General in Jerusalem to review the textbooks. Its report was completed in March 2003 and delivered to the State Department for submission to Congress. Its executive summary states: &quot;The overall orientation of the curriculum is peaceful despite the harsh and violent realities on the ground. It does not openly incite against Israel and the Jews. It does not openly incite hatred and violence. Religious and political tolerance is emphasized in a good number of textbooks and in multiple contexts.&quot;

IPCRI&#x27;s June 2004 follow-up report notes that &quot;except for calls for resisting occupation and oppression, no signs were detected of outright promotion of hatred towards Israel, Judaism, or Zionism&quot; and that &quot;tolerance, as a concept, runs across the new textbooks&quot;. The report also stated that &quot;textbooks revealed numerous instances that introduce and promote the universal and religious values and concepts of respect of other cultures, religions, and ethnic groups, peace, human rights, freedom of speech, justice, compassion, diversity, plurality, tolerance, respect of law, and environmental awareness&quot;.

However, the IPCRI noted a number of deficiencies in the curriculum.

The practice of &#x27;appropriating&#x27; sites, areas, localities, geographic regions, etc. inside the territory of the State of Israel as Palestine/Palestinian observed in our previous review, remains a feature of the newly published textbooks (4th and 9th Grade) laying substantive grounds to the contention that the Palestinian Authority did not in fact recognize Israel as the State of the Jewish people. ...

The summary also states that the curriculum asserts a historical Arab presence in the region, while:
The Jewish connection to the region, in general, and the Holy Land, in particular, is virtually missing. This lack of reference is perceived as tantamount to a denial of such a connection, although no direct evidence is found for such a denial.&quot; It also notes that &quot;terms and passages used to describe some historical events are sometimes offensive in nature and could be construed as reflecting hatred of and discrimination against Jews and Judaism.&quot;
The US State Department has similarly raised concerns about the content of textbooks used in PA schools. In its 2009 Human Rights report, the US Department of State wrote that after a 2006 revision of textbooks by the PA Ministry of Education and Higher Education, international academics concluded that books did not incite violence against Jews but showed imbalance, bias, and inaccuracy. The examples given were similar to those given by IPCRI.

In 2013 the results of a rigorous study, which also compared Israeli textbooks to PA textbooks, came out. The study was launched by the Council for Religious Institutions in the Holy Land, an interfaith association of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim leaders in Israel and the Occupied Territories. The study was overseen by an international Scientific Advisory Panel and funded by the US State Department The Council published a report &quot;Victims of Our Own Narratives? Portrayal of the &#x27;Other&#x27; in Israeli and Palestinian School Books&quot;. Most books were found to be factually accurate except, for example, through presenting maps that present the area from the river to the sea as either Palestine or Israel. Israeli schoolbooks were deemed superior to Palestinian ones with regard to preparing children for peace, although various depictions of the &quot;other&quot; as enemy occurred in 75% of Israeli, and in 81% of Palestinian textbooks. The study praised both Israel and the Palestinian Authority for producing textbooks almost completely unblemished by &quot;dehumanizing and demonizing characterizations of the other&quot;. Yet many troubling examples were given of both sides failing to represent each other in a positive or even adequate way. And the problem was more pronounced in PA textbooks.
* Neutral depictions of &quot;the other&quot; were found in 4% of Israeli, and 15% of Palestinian textbooks.
* Overall negative or very negative representations of Palestinians occurred 49% of the time in Israeli state school books (73% in Haredi school books) and in 84% of Palestinian textbooks.
* Highly negative characterizations were discerned in 26% of Israeli state school books and 50% of the Palestinian ones.

All in all there seems to be broad agreement that there is continual improvement in the textbooks used by UNRWA—but very strong disagreement about whether the improvement is sufficient. In response to a critical report written in 2009 by former UNRWA general counsel James G. Lindsay, fellow researcher for Washington Institute for Near East Policy John Ging, head of UNRWA Gaza, said: &quot;As for our schools, we use textbooks of the Palestinian Authority. Are they perfect? No, they&#x27;re not. I can&#x27;t defend the indefensible.&quot;

UNRWA has taken many steps since 2000 to supplement the PA curriculum with concepts of human rights, nonviolent conflict resolution, and tolerance. According to the UNRWA website:

We have been delivering human rights education in our schools since 2000 to promote non-violence, healthy communication skills, peaceful conflict resolution, human rights, tolerance, and good citizenship. In May 2012, the Agency endorsed its new Human Rights, Conflict Resolution and Tolerance (HRCRT) Policy to further strengthen human rights education in UNRWA. This policy builds upon past successes, but also draws from international best practices and paves the way to better integrate human rights education in all our schools. The HRCRT Policy reflects the UNRWA mandate of quality education for Palestine refugees and sets out a common approach among all UNRWA schools for the teaching and learning of human rights, conflict resolution and tolerance. The vision of the policy is to &quot;provide human rights education that empowers Palestine refugee students to enjoy and exercise their rights, uphold human rights values, be proud of their Palestinian identity, and contribute positively to their society and the global community.&quot;In 2021, the Australian and Canadian governments started investigating UNRWA, and the British government found that UNRWA had produced and disseminated textbooks inciting violence. UNRWA blocked public access to its website contents in response. Phillipe Lazzarini admitted to the European Parliament that the study materials in UNRWA&#x27;s schools featured incitement to violence, glorification of acts of terror, and antisemitism, but insisted that the agency takes steps to prevent the material from being taught.

A review performed in 2024 names using &quot;host-country textbooks with problematic content&quot; as one of the issues with UNRWA&#x27;s neutrality. The review states &quot;Three international assessments of PA textbooks in recent years have provided a nuanced picture..Two identified presence of bias and antagonistic content, but did not provide evidence of antisemitic content. The third assessment, by the [German-based] Georg Eckert Institute, studied 156 PA textbooks and identified two examples that it found to display antisemitic motifs but noted that one of them had already been removed, the other has been altered.&quot;

====Relationship with Hamas====
In October 2004 UNRWA Commissioner-General Peter Hansen caused controversy in Canada when he said in an interview with CBC TV:

Oh I am sure that there are Hamas members on the UNRWA payroll and I don&#x27;t see that as a crime. Hamas as a political organization does not mean that every member is a militant and we do not do political vetting and exclude people from one persuasion as against another.

We demand of our staff, whatever their political persuasion is, that they behave in accordance with UN standards and norms for neutrality.

Hansen later specified that he had been referring not to active Hamas members, but to Hamas sympathizers within UNRWA. In a letter to the Agency&#x27;s major donors, he said he was attempting to be honest because UNRWA has over 8,200 employees in the Gaza Strip. Given that opinion polls show 30% support of Hamas in Gaza at the time, and UNRWA&#x27;s workforce of 11,000 Palestinians, at least some Hamas sympathizers were likely to be among UNRWA&#x27;s employees. The important thing, he wrote, was that UNRWA&#x27;s strict rules and regulations ensured that its staff remained impartial UN servants. Hansen was retired from United Nations service against his will on 31 March 2005 after the United States blocked his reappointment.

UNRWA has come under criticism from Hamas for teaching Palestinian students Western values. According to Hazem Balousha, some Hamas officials objected to UNRWA organized trips for Palestinian students to visit Holocaust remembrance sites. Hamas officials also opposed other UNRWA organized trips for Palestinian students to the US and Europe. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Hamas has in some cases threatened UN staff in Gaza. James G. Lindsay, a former UNRWA general counsel and affiliated with the pro-Israel Washington Institute for Near East Policy published a report for WINEP in 2009 in which he said UNRWA did not take enough steps to detect and prevent members of Hamas from joining the organization.

According to &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, Hamas won a teachers union election for UN schools in Gaza in 2009. UNRWA has strongly denied this and pointed out that &quot;Staff elections are conducted on an individual – not party list – basis for unions that handle normal labour relations – not political – issues.&quot; In addition, John Ging, the Gaza head of operations, said in a letter dated 29 March 2009 that employees must not &quot;be under the influence of any political party in the conduct of their work.&quot;

Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth stated in 2012 that a staff union election resulted in 25 of the 27 seats going to Palestinians who were either Islamist or sympathetic towards Hamas. More than 9,500 UNRWA employees in the Gaza Strip participated; this represented more than 80% turnout. The professional list won three UNRWA workers groups: the employees&#x27;, teachers&#x27;, and services&#x27; unions. According to the Israeli government , UNRWA employed at least 24 members of Hamas or Islamic Jihad in 24 of its schools; the majority were principals or deputy principals, and several were fighters in the Qassam Brigades. Also, Israel provided intelligence about 18 UNRWA workers it accused of participating in the October 7, 2023, attacks.

====Hamas interference====

It has been reported that Hamas has interfered with curriculum and textbooks in UNRWA schools. For example, in 2009 it caused UNRWA to suspend a decision to introduce Holocaust studies in its schools. One of UNRWA&#x27;s flagships has been gender-equality and integration. But Hamas militants have firebombed UNRWA mixed-gender summer camps, and in 2013 Hamas passed a law requiring gender segregation in schools for all pupils nine years of age and older in Gaza. The law does not apply to UNRWA schools.

Elhanen Miller, the Arab affairs reporter for &quot;The Times of Israel&quot;, wrote in February 2014 that Hamas was &quot;bashing&quot; UNRWA&#x27;s human rights curriculum, saying that it included too many examples and values foreign to Palestinian culture and had too much emphasis on peaceful resistance rather than armed resistance. In this case UNRWA refused to be swayed. Spokesman Chris Gunness said:

UNRWA has no plans to change its education programs in Gaza ... human rights are taught in all UNRWA schools from grades 1 through 9, discussing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

UNRWA&#x27;s education system takes as its basis the curriculum taught by the PA and so we use PA textbooks in preparing children in Gaza for public examinations. ... In addition, we enrich our education programs in Gaza with an agreed human rights curriculum which has been developed with the communities we serve: with educationalists, parents groups, teachers associations, staff members and others. We have done our utmost in developing these materials to be sensitive to local values while also being true to the universal values that underpin the work of the United Nations.
However, after a few days, UNRWA consented to temporarily suspending the use of only the books used in grades 7–9 (continuing to use the books used in grades 1–6) pending further discussions.

====Operation of summer camps====
Hamas has denounced UNRWA and Ging, accusing them of using their summer camps to corrupt the morals of Palestinian youth. Hamas also advised UNRWA to reexamine its curriculum to ensure its suitability for Palestinian society, due to the mixing of genders at the camps. In September 2011 it was reported that, under pressure from Hamas, UNRWA has made all its summer camps single-sex. Hamas has its own network of summer camps and the two organizations are regarded to be vying for influence with Gazan youth. Islamic Jihad has also run summer camps since 2013. UNRWA did not operate its summer camps for summer 2012 and summer 2014 due to a lack of available funding. Hamas has filled this void and now is the direct provider of summer activities for about 100,000 children and youths. In 2013, UNRWA canceled its planned marathon in Gaza after Hamas rulers prohibited women from participating in the race.

In 2013, Israeli media outlets aired a video documenting UNRWA-funded summer camps where children are being taught to engage in violence with Israelis. The video airs speakers telling campers &quot;With God&#x27;s help and our own strength we will wage war. And with education and Jihad we will return to our homes!&quot; A student is also shown on camera describing that &quot;the summer camp teaches us that we have to liberate Palestine.&quot; UNRWA denies that the video shows UNRWA summer camps and instead shows footage of camps that were not operated by UNRWA, and stated that the film was &quot;grossly misleading&quot; and that &quot;the film-maker concerned has a history of making baseless claims about UNRWA, all of which we have investigated and demonstrated to be patently false.&quot; It stated that the &#x27;summer camp&#x27; shown in the West Bank was not affiliated with or organized by UNRWA, and that footage from the camp in Gaza &quot;revealed that absolutely nothing anti-Semitic or inflammatory was done or said&quot;.

==Investigations and calls for accountability and reform==
Many critics of UNRWA, while generally recognizing the importance of its work and the infeasibility of disbanding it, believe it requires more transparency, oversight, and support. Writing in the &quot;Middle East Monitor&quot; in April 2012, Karen Koning AbuZayd, a former Commissioner-General of the UNRWA (2005–2009), argued that &quot;UNRWA needs support not brickbats&quot;. She concluded that:

... even those who scrutinise [UNRWA] most closely and challenge it most severely are those who also ensure that its programmes receive adequate funding. They, like others who view the agency more positively, realise that UNRWA makes a major contribution to stability in the Middle East.
Writing in the &quot;Times of Israel&quot; on 31 July 2014, David Horovitz argued that Israel had many legitimate complaints against UNRWA, including that its definition of &quot;refugee&quot; included the descendants of the original Palestinian refugees, that it was &quot;closely watched by Hamas for signs that it is not sufficiently critical of Israel&quot;, and that its facilities frequently harbored Hamas operatives and their weaponry. But, he noted, while Israeli officials privately argued for its abolishment, with no other credible party able to take over the agency&#x27;s duties, including administering the more than 200,000 Gazans internally displaced during the then-ongoing 2014 Gaza War, Israel had never &quot;launched a no-holds-barred effort to bring UNRWA down&quot;. That changed after the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, as Horovitz described in a January 2025 piece titled &quot;Gaza after UNRWA&quot;. In addition to cataloguing ties between UNRWA and Hamas, including revelations of its staff&#x27;s &quot;complicity in the mass murder in Israel that caused the war and devastation in Gaza&quot;, Horovitz excoriated the agency for having &quot;perpetuated a fundamental intolerance for the simple fact of Israel’s existence&quot; and having &quot;helped Hamas and by extension doomed Gaza&quot;.

===Repeated calls for investigation by the United States===
The United States government financed a programme of &quot;Operations Support Officers&quot; whose responsibilities including undertaking random and unannounced inspections of UNRWA facilities to ensure their sanctity from militant operations. In 2004, the U.S. Congress asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) to investigate media claims that government funding given to UNRWA had been used to support individuals involved in militant activities. During its investigation, the GAO discovered several irregularities in its processing and employment history.

In August 2014, several US Senators demanded an impartial investigation into UNRWA&#x27;s alleged participation in the 2014 Gaza-Israel conflict, accusing UNRWA of being complicit with Hamas.

... While the letter does not call on the State Department to cut aid, the senators write that the American taxpayers &quot;deserve to know if UNRWA is fulfilling its mission or taking sides in this tragic conflict.&quot;
... Responding to the letter, a State Department spokesman said that the UN is taking &quot;proactive steps to address this problem,&quot; including deploying munitions experts to the strip in search of more weapons caches.
&quot;The international community cannot accept a situation where the United Nations– its facilities, staff, and those it is protecting — are used as shields for militants and terrorist groups,&quot; State Department spokesone Edgar Vasquez told &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;. &quot;We remain in intensive consultations with UN leadership about the UN&#x27;s response.&quot;

&quot;There are few good solutions given the exceptionally difficult situation in Gaza,&quot; Vasquez continued, &quot;but nonetheless we are in contact with the United Nations, other UNRWA donors, and concerned parties – including Israel – on identifying better options for protecting the neutrality of UN facilities and ensuring that weapons discovered are handled appropriately and do not find their way back to Hamas or other terrorist groups.&quot;In 2018, citing a &quot;failure to mobilize adequate and appropriate burden sharing,&quot; the Trump administration stopped funding UNRWA, calling its fundamental business model and fiscal practices &quot;simply unsustainable&quot;. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo maintained that &quot;most Palestinians under UNRWA&#x27;s jurisdiction aren&#x27;t refugees, and UNRWA is a hurdle to peace.&quot; However, the Biden administration restarted funding in April 2021 and as of 2023 has provided over $1 billion to the aid agency.

===James G. Lindsay===
On the basis of his 2009 analyses for WINEP, referred to in previous sections, former UNRWA general-counsel James G. Lindsay and fellow researcher for Washington Institute for Near East Policy made the following suggestions for improvement: 
UNRWA should make the following operational changes: halt its one-sided political statements and limit itself to comments on humanitarian issues; take additional steps to ensure the agency is not employing or providing benefits to terrorists and criminals; and allow the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), or some other neutral entity, to provide balanced and discrimination-free textbooks for UNRWA schools.

Andrew Whitley, director of the UNRWA representative office at UN headquarters in New York, criticized the report as biased and relying on limited sources. Additionally, he noted: &quot;Someone reading this paper with no background would assume that the Israeli government was a benign actor. No mention is made of the occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.&quot;

UNRWA&#x27;s Jerusalem spokesperson Chris Gunness stated that UNRWA rejects Lindsay&#x27;s report and its findings and said that the study was inaccurate and misleading, since it &quot;makes selective use of source material and fails to paint a truthful portrait of UNRWA and its operations today&quot;.

In response to the criticism of his report from UNRWA, Lindsay writes:

===Reform initiative===
An initiative to reform UNRWA was announced by the Center for Near East Policy Research in March 2014. The center carries out research and (through its &quot;Israel Resource News Agency&quot;) investigative journalism and research in cooperation with a wide variety of organisations and researchers, such as The Middle East Forum, which has published an entire issue of Middle East Quarterly discussing the challenges facing UNRWA.

The main thrust of the UNRWA Reform Initiative is to present documentation of problems with UNRWA to sponsor nations and organisations with the aim of increasing sponsor demands for accountability. UNRWA has stated on multiple occasions that the head of this initiative, David Bedein, fabricates the information he publishes.

=== EU conditions funding 2021 ===
In September 2021, the European Parliament&#x27;s Budgetary Control Committee approved withholding 20 million Euros in aid to UNRWA if immediate changes to UNRWA&#x27;s education curriculum are not made. According to the resolution, the Parliament &quot;is concerned about the hate speech and violence taught in Palestinian school textbooks and used in schools by UNRWA... [and] insists that UNRWA acts in full transparency... to ensure that content adheres to UN values and does not encourage hatred.&quot;

Funding for UNRWA was reinstated by the EU on March 1, 2024.

==Relations with Israel==
After Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza in the Six-Day War, it requested that the UNRWA continue its operations there, which it would facilitate. Since then the relationship has been characterized by two-state advocate Baruch Spiegel, as &quot;an uneasy marriage of convenience between two unlikely bedfellows that have helped perpetuate the problem both have allegedly sought to resolve.&quot;

Immediately following the Six-Day War, on 14 June UNRWA Commissioner-General Dr. Laurence Michelmore and political advisor to the Israeli Foreign Minister Michael Comay exchanged letters that has since served as much of the basis for the relationship between Israel and UNRWA. Commonly referred to the Comay-Michelmore Exchange of Letters, the initial letter from Michelmore reiterates a verbal conversation between the two, stating that:

at the request of the Israel Government, UNRWA would continue its assistance to the Palestine refugees, with the full co-operation of the Israel authorities, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip areas. For its part, the Israel Government will facilitate the task of UNRWA to the best of its ability, subject only to regulations or arrangements which may be necessitated by considerations of military security. 

In his responding letter, Comay wrote:

I agree that your letter and this reply constitute a provisional agreement between UNRWA and the Government of Israel, to remain in force until replaced or cancelled.

UNRWA has been criticised by the Israeli government and politicians for alleged involvement with Palestinian militant groups, such as Hamas. Israeli media organizations have claimed that Peter Hansen, UNRWA&#x27;s former Commissioner-General (1996–2005) &quot;consistently adopted a trenchant anti-Israel line&quot; which resulted in biased and exaggerated reports against Israel. On 28 October 2024, the Knesset passed legislation that orders it to cease &quot;any activity&quot; in territories claimed by Israel within 90 days. The Israeli government, for its part, declared that it will terminate all collaboration, communication and contact with UNRWA beginning on January 30, 2025. On 30 January, Israel&#x27;s UNRWA ban went into effect.

<doc id="32273" wikidata="Q549338" url="?curid=32273" title="German submarine U-155 (1941)">
<text>German submarine &quot;U-155&quot; was a Type IXC U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; built for service during World War II. Her keel was laid down on 1 October 1940 by DeSchiMAG AG Weser in Bremen as yard number 997. She was launched on 12 May 1941 and commissioned on 23 August with &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Adolf Piening in command. Piening was relieved in February 1944 (after being promoted to &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot;), by &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Johannes Rudolph.

==Design==
German Type IXC submarines were slightly larger than the original Type IXBs. &quot;U-155&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-155&quot; was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a SK C/30 as well as a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight.

==Service history==
&quot;Leutnant zur See&quot; Ludwig von Friedeburg relieved Rudolph from August to November 1944, when Rudolph resumed command for another month. During these four months, &quot;U-155&quot; had the youngest U-boat commander during the war since Von Friedeburg was only 20 years old. In December, &quot;Kptlt.&quot; Erwin Witte took over, and was relieved in April 1945 by &quot;Oblt.z.S.&quot; Friedrich Altmeier. Altmeier commanded the boat for one month before the German surrender; &quot;U-155&quot; was then scuttled by the Royal Navy. The wreck was located, largely intact, in 2001.

&quot;U-155&quot; conducted ten patrols, sinking 25 ships totalling , one warship of 13,785 tons and damaging one auxiliary warship of . She was a member of one wolfpack. She sank a warship and a troop transport ship, and damaged a cargo ship, with one salvo of four torpedoes on 15 November 1942 during her fourth patrol, and shot down a P-51 Mustang aircraft on her final patrol.

==First patrol==

&quot;U-155&quot; left Kiel on her first patrol on 7 February 1942. Her route took her &#x27;up&#x27; the North Sea, through the gap between the Faroe and Shetland Islands and into the Atlantic. South of Cape Farewell in Greenland, she sank and &quot;Adellen&quot; on the 22nd.

She then moved on to the US east coast, sinking the about off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on 7 March. On the tenth, the First Watch Officer (1WO) &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Gert Rentrop was washed overboard.

The boat docked at the Lorient U-boat base on the Atlantic coast of German-occupied France on March 27.

==Second patrol==

Having left Lorient on 24 April 1942, &quot;U-155&quot; steamed to the eastern Caribbean Sea and the portion of the Atlantic adjacent to it. She attacked &quot;Brabant&quot; southwest of Grenada on 14 May. The ship sank in eight minutes.

The U-boat sank another six ships; one of them, &quot;Sylvan Arrow&quot;, was torpedoed on 20 May, but did not go down until the 28th, following a salvage attempt.

The submarine returned to Lorient on 14 June.

==Third patrol==

&quot;U-155&quot;″s third and most successful foray was conducted in similar waters to her second effort, beginning in Lorient on 9 July. She sank &quot;Barbacena&quot; with torpedoes east of Barbados, but others, such as &quot;Piave&quot;, went to the bottom with the more economic deck gun. Another victim, &quot;Cranford&quot;, met her end within three minutes. Part of her cargo was 6,600 tons of chrome ore. Two injured survivors were treated on &quot;U-155&quot; before water, supplies and directions were handed over to their colleagues.

The submarine&#x27;s skipper apologized for sinking one ship (&quot;Empire Arnold&quot; on 4 August), to the Chief Officer, who told him it was a bad business and wished it [the war] was over. Piening replied: &quot;So do I&quot;.

&quot;Maschinengefreiter&quot; Konrad Garneier was lost overboard during an air attack on 19 August.

In all, the boat sank ten ships, a total of 43,514 GRT.

==Fourth patrol==

Three of a spread of four torpedoes hit targets, one &quot;aal&quot; (eel: U-boat slang for torpedo), damaged , a US Navy-requisitioned cargo transport; two others sank escort carrier and the British troop transport &quot;Ettrick&quot; on 15 November 1942 northwest of Gibraltar. Of 526 men on &quot;Avenger&quot;, there were 12 survivors. &quot;Ettrick&quot;″s master was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

The boat also sank &quot;Serroskerk&quot; in mid-Atlantic. There were no survivors.

==Fifth patrol==

&quot;U-155&quot;″s fifth sortie involved her move to the western Caribbean and southern Florida, USA. She sank &quot;Lysefjord&quot; west of Havana on 2 April 1943, and on 3 April sank the oil tanker &quot;Gulfstate&quot; about east northeast of Marathon Key, Florida (in 2013 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s Remediation of Underwater Legacy Environmental Threats (RULET) project found the sunken &quot;Gulfstate&quot; to be a potential source of oil pollution.)

On the return journey &quot;U-155&quot; was attacked by an unknown aircraft on 27 April northwest of Cape Finisterre, Spain.

==Sixth patrol==

To try and counter the air threat, &quot;U-155&quot; was grouped together with , , and in the Bay of Biscay. The formation was attacked by four de Havilland Mosquito aircraft on 14 June — three from No. 307 Polish Night Fighter Squadron and one from No. 410 Squadron RCAF. One Mosquito, hit in the port engine, was forced to break off its attack and return to base where it made a belly landing. Five men in the boat&#x27;s crew were wounded; they were treated by &quot;U-68&quot;″s doctor on their return to Lorient on 16 June.

==Seventh and eighth patrols==

Patrol number seven was as long as any of the others, to a point northeast of the Cape Verde Islands; but the boat did not find any targets.

The submarine&#x27;s eighth patrol took her toward the northeast coast of Brazil. While sinking &quot;Siranger&quot; she took the third mate prisoner (he had been wounded, and was operated-on by the boat&#x27;s doctor). He was taken back to Lorient and was eventually transferred to the POW camp at Milag Nord near Bremen.

==Ninth and tenth patrols==

&quot;U-155&quot;″s ninth patrol was, at 105 days, her longest, but like her seventh, found no targets. On 4 May 1944, the boat shot down a North American P-51 Mustang aircraft of No. 126 Squadron RAF and on 23 June 1944, Mosquitos of 248 Squadron attacked, killing &quot;Matrosenobergefreiter&quot; Karl Lohmeier and &quot;Mechanikerobergefreiter&quot; Friedrich Feller and wounding seven others. Her patrol terminated at Lorient the same day.

Her tenth and final patrol left Lorient on 9 September 1944, the last by a U-boat from the base. The patrol was uneventful; she returned to Germany by a circuitous route, and docked at Flensburg on 21 October.

==Fate==
On 22 June 1945, after the German surrender, she was transferred from Wilhelmshaven to Loch Ryan, Scotland for Royal Navy Operation Deadlight, the scuttling of surrendered German U-boats, and sunk on 21 December the same year.

==Post war==
&quot;U-155&quot; was located and identified in 2001 by a team of divers led by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney, revealing the wreck was lying upright on the sea bed, largely intact, at a depth of .

Her crew held their 25th reunion in 1995 with former &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Johannes Rudolph and one of the Mosquito pilots who attacked the boat in June 1944 &#x27;on board&#x27;.

&quot;U-556&quot; sailed from Kiel for her first patrol on 1 May 1941. She headed out into the waters of the northern Atlantic, south of Greenland. She made her first kill on 6 May, sinking the 166 GRT Faroese fishing trawler &quot;Emanuel&quot; with her deck gun west of the Faroe Islands.

On 10 May she joined the wolfpack &quot;West&quot; attacking Convoy OB 318 south-east of Cape Farewell. Her first victim was the 4,986 GRT British merchant ship &quot;Aelybryn&quot;, hit by one of the torpedoes fired by the U-boat at 04:42. Badly damaged, but suffering only a single casualty, the ship was towed to Reykjavík by .

The convoy scattered, but at 07:52 &quot;U-556&quot; torpedoed and sank the 4,861 GRT British merchant ship . Nine crew members and two gunners were later picked up by , but the master, 31 crewmen, and two gunners were lost.

The U-boat had her third success of the day at 20:37, sinking the 5,086 GRT Belgian merchant ship &quot;Gand&quot;. One crew member was lost and another wounded. The master, 38 crewmen and four gunners were rescued by .

Ten days later, on 20 May, the wolfpack attacked Convoy HX 126. Between 14:48 and 15:16 &quot;U-556&quot; fired torpedoes at the convoy and sank two British merchant ships, the 4,974 GRT &quot;Darlington Court&quot; and the 5,995 GRT &quot;Cockaponset&quot;, and the 8,470 GRT tanker &quot;British Security&quot;. Loaded with 11,200 tons of benzine and kerosene, the tanker caught fire and burned for three days before sinking. There were no survivors from her crew of 53.

====The sinking of &quot;Bismarck&quot;====

On 26 May, while returning from patrol, low on fuel and having fired all her torpedoes, &quot;U-556&quot; was ordered to reconnoitre the most recently reported position of the battleship .

&quot;U-556&quot; and &quot;Bismarck&quot; had been neighbours in the ways at Blohm &amp; Voss and their construction was completed at about the same time. (&quot;Bismarck&quot; was commissioned on 24 August 1940.) In January 1941, as &quot;U-556&quot;″s commissioning ceremony approached, Wohlfarth wanted a band for the celebration, but could not afford to hire one. &quot;Kapitän&quot; Ernst Lindemann, commanding officer of &quot;Bismarck&quot;, lent him his ship&#x27;s band.
As thanks, Wohlfarth drew up a humorous &quot;Patenschaftsurkunde&quot; (&quot;Certificate of Sponsorship&quot;) promising that &quot;U-556&quot; would protect &quot;Bismarck&quot;. A drawing shows Wohlfarth as the knight Parzival [Percival] (his nickname) on the deck of &quot;U-556&quot; simultaneously bringing down planes with a sword and reaching underwater to stop a torpedo with his thumb. A second drawing then shows the submarine towing the battleship to safety.

The text accompanying the drawing reads:
Around 19:50, Wohlfahrt saw the battlecruiser and the aircraft carrier coming out of the mist at high speed. He recorded in his log, &quot;Enemy bows on, 10 degrees to starboard, without destroyers, without zigzagging,&quot; but without any torpedoes, could only submerge and avoid them. Wohlfahrt saw activity on &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s flight deck, which transpired to be the launching of the second, fatal attack on &quot;Bismarck&quot;. At 20:39, Wohlfahrt surfaced and transmitted, &quot;Enemy in view, a battleship, an aircraft carrier, course 115, enemy is proceeding at high speed. Position 48° 20′ N, 16° 20′ W.&quot; &quot;Renown&quot;″s and &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s course toward &quot;Bismarck&quot; coincided almost exactly with his own; he proceeded on the surface at full speed behind them.

Wohlfahrt&#x27;s War Diary contains these entries for 27 May 1941:
:00:00, (wind) north-west 5, seaway 5, rain squalls, moderate visibility, very dark night. Surfaced. What can I do for Bismarck? I can see star shells being fired and flashes from Bismarck&#x27;s guns. It is a terrible feeling to be near and not to be able to do anything. All I can do is reconnoitre and lead in boats that have torpedoes. I am keeping contact at the limit of visibility, reporting the position, and sending directional signals to call up the other boats.

:03:52: I am moving around on the east side to the south, in order to be in the direction of the activity. I soon reach the limit of what I can do in view of my fuel supply. Otherwise, I won&#x27;t get home.

:04:00: The seas are rising ever higher. Bismarck still fighting. Reported weather for the Luftwaffe.

Around 06:30 Wohlfahrt sighted and transferred the mission of maintaining contact with &quot;Bismarck&quot; to &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Eitel-Friedrich Kentrat. He gave Kentrat &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s position based on his observations of the star shells fired during the night, adding: &quot;I have not seen her directly. You assume contact. I have no more fuel.&quot; Wohlfahrt then submerged and did not surface again until noon, a time at which radio signals were routinely repeated. That was when he heard for the first time the order radioed to him between 07:00 and 08:00 to pick up &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s War Diary. He replied to the &quot;Befehlshaber der U-Boote&quot; (&quot;Commander-in-Chief for Submarines&quot;) Karl Dönitz, asking that this mission be transferred to Kentrat, who received the radio order, &quot;U-boat Kentrat pick up Bismarck War Diary,&quot; but was unable to locate &quot;Bismarck&quot;. The battleship had been sunk before Wohlfahrt had received the first message at noon.

&quot;U-556&quot; arrived at Lorient, in occupied France on 30 May 1941 after 30 days at sea, where Wohlfahrt received the Knight&#x27;s Cross (&quot;Ritterkreuz&quot;) from Dönitz personally.

===Second patrol===
&quot;U-556&quot; departed from Lorient on 19 June 1941, and once more headed out into the Atlantic. However, on 27 June, she was sunk south-west of Iceland, in position , by depth charges from the British s , and . Five of the crew were killed and 41 survived.

===Wolfpacks===
&quot;U-556&quot; took part in one wolfpack, namely:
* West (10 – 20 May 1941)

<doc id="32279" wikidata="Q468124" url="?curid=32279" title="Mother Shipton">
<text>Ursula Southeil ( 1487 – 1561); also variously spelt as Southill, Soothtell, Sontheil, or Sonthiel, popularly known as Mother Shipton, was an English soothsayer and prophetess according to English folklore.

She has sometimes been described as a witch and is associated with folklore involving the origin of the Rollright Stones of Oxfordshire. A king and his men were said to have transformed to stone after failing her test, as reported by William Camden in a rhyming account in 1610.

The first known edition of her prophecies was printed in 1641, eighty years after her reported death. This timing suggests that what was published was a legendary or mythical account. It contained numerous mainly regional predictions and only two prophetic verses.

One of the most notable editions of her prophecies was published in 1684. It gave her birthplace as Knaresborough, Yorkshire, in a cave now known as Mother Shipton&#x27;s Cave. The book reputed Shipton to be hideously ugly, and that she had married Toby Shipton, a local carpenter, near York in 1512, and told fortunes and made predictions throughout her life.

== Personal life ==
Mother Shipton was born Ursula Southeil or Sonthiel, in 1486 or 1488 (though some sources claim she was born as early as 1448) to 15-year-old Agatha Soothtale, allegedly in a cave outside the town of Knaresborough in North Yorkshire. The earliest sources of the legends of her birth and life were collected in 1667 by author and biographer Richard Head and later by J. Conyers in 1686.

Both sources—1667 and 1686—state that Shipton was born during a violent thunderstorm, and was deformed and ugly, born with a hunchback and bulging eyes. The sources also state that Shipton cackled instead of crying after having been born, and as she did so, the previously raging storms ceased.

The sources report Ursula&#x27;s mother Agatha as a poor and desolate 15-year-old orphan, left with no means to support herself; having fallen under the influences of the Devil, Agatha engaged in an affair, resulting in the birth of Ursula. Variations of this legend claim Agatha herself was a witch and summoned the Devil to conceive a child.

The true origin of Ursula&#x27;s father is unknown, with Agatha refusing to reveal him; at one point, Agatha was forcibly brought before the local magistrate, but still refused to disclose his identity. The scandalous nature of Agatha&#x27;s life and Ursula&#x27;s birth meant the two were ostracised from society and forced to live alone, in the same cave Ursula was born, for the first two years of Ursula&#x27;s life. Rumours that Agatha was a witch and Ursula the spawn of Satan were perpetuated, due to the cave&#x27;s well-known skull-shaped pool, which turned things to stone. The cave is known today as Mother Shipton&#x27;s Cave; though the effects of the cave&#x27;s pool are not those of true petrification, they closely resemble the process by which stalactites are formed, coating objects left in the cave with layers of minerals, and in essence hardening porous objects until they become hard and stone-like.

According to 17th-century sources, after two years living alone in the Forest of Knaresborough, the abbot of Beverley intervened. The abbot removed them from the cave and secured Agatha a place in the Convent of the order of St. Bridget in Nottinghamshire, and Ursula a foster family in Knaresborough. Agatha and Ursula would never see each other again.

Developed from contemporary descriptions and depictions of her, it is likely Ursula had a large crooked nose and suffered from a hunchback and crooked legs. Physical differences acted as a visual reminder of the secretive events of her birth and the townspeople never forgot. She found acceptance with her foster family and a few friends, but Ursula was ultimately ostracised from the larger portion of people in town. She found sanctuary in the woods like her mother had and spent most of her childhood learning of plants and herbs and their medicinal properties.

=== Legends of her childhood ===
It was claimed that when Ursula was two years old, she was left alone at home while her foster mother left to run errands. Her mother returned to find the front door wide open. Afraid of what might still be in the house, she called to her neighbours for assistance, and the group heard a loud wailing, like &quot;a thousand cats in consort&quot; throughout the house. Ursula&#x27;s cradle was found empty. After a frantic search throughout the house, her mother looked up to see Ursula naked and cackling, perched on top of the iron bar where the pot hooks were fastened above the fireplace.

The source dating to 1686 tells of an event where the chief members of the parish were gathered together in a meeting. Ursula walked past the group running an errand for her mother, and the men stopped to mock her, calling out &quot;hag face&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s bastard&quot;. Ursula kept walking to continue her errands but as the men sat back down, the ruff on the neck of one of the principal yeomen transformed and a toilet seat clapped down around his neck. The man next to him began to laugh, and as he did the hat he was wearing was suddenly replaced with a chamber pot. The gathered members of the parish began to laugh loudly enough that the Master of the house came running to see what was happening; when he tried to run through the door, he found himself blocked by a large pair of horns that had grown suddenly from his head. The source reports that the strange occurrences reverted to normal shortly afterwards, and that the townspeople took them as a sign not to publicly mock Ursula.

=== Adulthood ===
As Ursula grew so did her knowledge of plants and herbs and she became an invaluable resource for the townspeople as a herbalist. The respect she earned from her work gave her the opportunity to expand her social circle and it was then she met the local carpenter Toby Shipton.

When Ursula was 24 years old she and Toby Shipton were married. From this point on Ursula adopted her husband&#x27;s surname and became Mother Shipton. The people in town were shocked at their union and whispered of how he must have been bewitched to marry her.

About a month into her marriage a neighbour came to the door and asked for her help, saying she had left her door open and a thief had come in and stole a new smock and petticoat. Without hesitation Mother Shipton calmed her neighbour and said she knew exactly who stole the clothing and would retrieve it the next day. The next morning Mother Shipton and her neighbour went to the market cross. The woman who had stolen the clothing couldn&#x27;t stop herself from putting the smock on over her clothes, the petticoat in her hand, and marching through town. When she arrived at the market cross she began dancing and danced straight for Mother Shipton and her neighbour all the while singing &quot;I stole my Neighbours Smock and Coat, I am a Thief, and here I show&#x27;t.&quot; When she reached Mother Shipton she took off the smock, handed it over, curtsied and left.

Two years later, in 1514, Toby Shipton died, and the town believed Ursula to have been responsible for his death. The grief of losing her husband and the harsh words of the town prompted Ursula Shipton to move into the woods, and the same cave she had been born in, for peace. Here she continued to create potions and herbal remedies for people. Mother Shipton&#x27;s name slowly became more and more well known, and people would travel far distances to see her and receive potions and spells.

As her popularity grew she grew bolder and revealed she could see the future. She started by making small prophecies involving her town and the people within, and as her prophecies came true she began telling prophecies of the monarchy and the future of the world. In 1537 King Henry VIII wrote a letter to the Duke of Norfolk where he mentions a &quot;witch of York&quot;, believed by some to be a reference to Shipton.

== Prophecies ==
===River Ouse===
&quot;Water shall come over Ouse Bridge, and a windmill shall be set upon a Tower, and a Elm Tree shall lie at every man&#x27;s door&quot;.The River Ouse was the river next to York, and Ouse Bridge was the bridge over the river. This prophecy meant nothing to the people of York until the town got a piped water system. The system brought water across Ouse Bridge in pipes to a windmill that drew up the water into the pipes. The pipes they used were made out of Elm trees and the pipes came to every man&#x27;s door delivering water throughout the town.&quot;Before Ouse Bridge and Trinity Church meet, what is built in the day shall fall in the night, till the highest stone in the church be the lowest stone of the bridge.&quot;Not long after Mother Shipton uttered this prophecy did a huge storm fall on York. During the storm the steeple on the top of Trinity Church fell and a portion of the Ouse Bridge was destroyed and swept away by the river. Later when making repairs to the bridge, pieces that had previously been the steeple of the church were used as the foundation of the new section of the bridge. Effectively making Trinity Church and the Ouse Bridge what was built in the day and fell in the night, and the steeple from Trinity Church, the highest stone, be the foundation of the bridge, the lowest stone of the bridge.

=== Prophecy of the end of times ===

The most famous claimed edition of Mother Shipton&#x27;s prophecies foretells many modern events and phenomena. Widely quoted today as if it were the original, it contains over a hundred prophetic rhymed couplets. But the language is notably non-16th century. This edition includes the now-famous lines:&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;The world to an end shall come&quot;
&quot;In eighteen hundred and eighty one.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

This version was not published until 1862. In 1873 Charles Hindley of Brighton admitted to &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; that he had composed the rhyme and ten others added to the 1862 edition.

This fictional prophecy was published over the years with different dates and in (or about) several countries. The booklet &quot;The Life and Prophecies of Ursula Sontheil better known as Mother Shipton&quot; (1920s, and repeatedly reprinted) predicted the world would end in 1991. (In the late 1970s, many news articles were published about Mother Shipton and her prophecy that the world would end—these accounts said it would occur in 1981.)

===Technology===
Among other well-known lines from Charles Hindley&#x27;s fictional version (often quoted as if they were original) are:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Carriages without horses shall go;
&quot;And accidents fill the world with woe...
&quot;Iron in the water shall float,
&quot;As easy as a wooden boat.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

These lines hint at inventions not known in Shipton&#x27;s time—but a reality in Hindley&#x27;s—such as trains and iron ships, as well as at events such as wars and conflicts.

== Historicity ==
Based on contemporary references to her and countless resources detailing the events of her life, historians believe Mother Shipton was a real woman, born in 1488 to an orphan fifteen-year-old girl named Agatha Soothtale in a cave in North Yorkshire outside of the town Knaresborough. Based on how every contemporary record of her from the time references her appearance, she probably suffered from a hunchback and a large crooked nose, although much else regarding her appearance is conjecture. She made potions, herbal remedies, cast spells and prophesied the future.

In a possible reference to her existence, in 1537 Yorkshire, while Catholic people were rebelling against the dissolution of Catholic monasteries, Henry VIII wrote a letter to the Duke of Norfolk where he refers to a &quot;witch of York&quot;. It is believed that this letter is the earliest reference to the real Mother Shipton who would have been prophesying about Henry VIII at this time. In 1666 Samuel Pepys recorded in his diaries that, whilst surveying the damage to London caused by the 1666 Great Fire in the company of the Royal family, he heard them discuss Mother Shipton&#x27;s prophecy of the event.

The earliest account of Mother Shipton&#x27;s prophecies was published in 1641, eighty years after her death. The story goes that the document of Mother Shipton&#x27;s life was recorded by a woman named Joane Waller who heard the story as a young girl and transcribed it as Mother Shipton spoke of her life. Mother Shipton never wrote anything down or published anything during her lifetime.

The cave where she lived is known as England&#x27;s oldest tourist attraction and for hundreds of years people have trekked to see the cave where she was born. This cave&#x27;s water has a mineral content so high anything placed in the pool will slowly be covered in layers of stone. Tourists will place items in the pool to later return and see it turned to stone. It is assumed that many of her prophecies were never written down, and many legends and prophecies accredited to her were created after her death to enhance the folk legend she had become.

==Legacy==
The figure of Mother Shipton accumulated considerable folklore and legendary status. Her name became associated with many tragic events and strange goings-on recorded in the UK, North America and Australia throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Many fortune-tellers used her effigy and statue, presumably for purposes of association marketing. Many English pubs were named after her. Only two survive, one near her purported birthplace in Knaresborough and the other in Portsmouth. The latter has a statue of her above the door.

A caricature of Mother Shipton was used in early pantomime. Her appearance in pantomime was mentioned in a song from Yorkshire that was transcribed in the 18th century, and which reads (in part): &quot;Of all the pretty pantomimes/ That have been seen or sung in rhimes,/Since famous Johnny Rich&#x27;s times,/There&#x27;s none like Mother Shipton.&quot; 

The Mother Shipton moth (&quot;Callistege mi&quot;) is named after her. Each wing&#x27;s pattern resembles a hag&#x27;s head in profile.

A fundraising campaign was started in 2013 to raise £35,000 to erect a statue of Shipton in Knaresborough. Completed in October 2017, the statue sits on a bench in the town&#x27;s Market Square close to a statue of John Metcalf, an 18th-century road engineer known as Blind Jack.

Mother Shipton is referred to in Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot; (1722), referring to the year 1665, when the bubonic plague erupted in London: 
&quot;These terrors and apprehensions of the people led them into a thousand weak, foolish, and wicked things, which they wanted not a sort of people really wicked to encourage them to: and this was running about to fortune-tellers, cunning-men, and astrologers to know their fortune, or, as it is vulgarly expressed, to have their fortunes told them, their nativities calculated, and the like... And this trade grew so open and so generally practised that it became common to have signs and inscriptions set up at doors: &#x27;Here lives a fortune-teller&#x27;, &#x27;Here lives an astrologer&#x27;, &#x27;Here you may have your nativity calculated&#x27;, and the like; and Friar Bacon&#x27;s brazen-head, which was the usual sign of these people&#x27;s dwellings, was to be seen almost in every street, or else the sign of Mother Shipton...&quot;

<text>German submarine &quot;U-2511&quot; was a Type XXI submarine of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II. The &quot;Elektroboot&quot; submarine was laid down on 7 July 1944 at the Blohm &amp; Voss yard at Hamburg, launched on 2 September 1944, and commissioned on 29 September 1944 under the command of &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Adalbert Schnee.

==Design==
Like all Type XXI submarines, &quot;U-2511&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of (o/a), a beam of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN SE supercharged six-cylinder M6V40/46KBB diesel engines each providing , two Siemens-Schuckert GU365/30 double-acting electric motors each providing , and two Siemens-Schuckert silent running GV232/28 electric motors each providing .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . When running on silent motors the boat could operate at a speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate at for ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-2511&quot; was fitted with six torpedo tubes in the bow and four C/30 anti-aircraft guns. She could carry 23 torpedoes or 17 torpedoes and 12 naval mine. The complement was five officers and 52 men.

==Service history==
After training with 31st U-boat Flotilla, &quot;U-2511&quot; was transferred to 11th U-boat Flotilla at Bergen, Norway, for front-line service on 15 March 1945.

&quot;U-2511&quot; conducted one patrol. On the evening of 30 April 1945 (coincidentally the date of Hitler&#x27;s death), &quot;U-2511&quot; set out from Bergen, Norway for the Caribbean, but on 4 May Schnee received the end-of-the-war cease-fire order. The commander of &quot;U-2511&quot; claimed the U-boat had a British cruiser in her sights on 4 May when news of the German cease-fire was received. He further claimed she made a practice attack before leaving the scene undetected.

==Fate==
On 17 June 1945, &quot;U-2511&quot; was transferred from Bergen, and arrived at Londonderry Port on 21 June for Operation Deadlight. The U-boat was sunk on 7 January 1946 at 7:40 pm in position . She was sunk by gunfire after her towing cable parted.

The wreck lies at a depth . She had been visited by divers at least three times, in 1999 and 2001, and circa 2012 for &#x27;Dig WW2 with Dan Snow&#x27;, revealing she is largely intact except for a large blast hole caused by the shellfire that sank her.

<text>The ukulele ( ; from ), also called a uke, is a member of the lute family of instruments. The ukulele is of Portuguese origin and was popularized in Hawaii. The tone and volume of the instrument vary with size and construction. Ukuleles commonly come in four sizes: soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone.

Ukuleles generally have four nylon strings tuned to GCEA. They have 16-22 frets depending on the size.

==History==
Developed in the 1880s, the ukulele is based on several small, guitar-like instruments of Portuguese origin, the , and , introduced to the Hawaiian Islands by Portuguese immigrants from Madeira, the Azores, and Cape Verde. Three immigrants in particular, Madeiran cabinet makers Manuel Nunes, José do Espírito Santo, and Augusto Dias, are generally credited as the first ukulele makers. Two weeks after they disembarked from the SS &quot;Ravenscrag&quot; in late August 1879, the &quot;Hawaiian Gazette&quot; reported that &quot;Madeira Islanders recently arrived here, have been delighting the people with nightly street concerts.&quot;

One of the most important factors in establishing the ukulele in Hawaiian music and culture was the ardent support and promotion of the instrument by King Kalākaua. A patron of the arts, he incorporated it into performances at royal gatherings.

In the Hawaiian language the word ukulele roughly translates as &#x27;jumping flea&#x27;, perhaps because of the movement of the player&#x27;s fingers. Legend attributes it to the nickname of Englishman Edward William Purvis, one of King Kalākaua&#x27;s officers, because of his small size, fidgety manner, and playing expertise. One of the earliest appearances of the word &quot;ukulele&quot; in print (in the sense of a stringed instrument) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of the Crosby Brown Collection of Musical Instruments of All Nations&quot; published in 1907. The catalog describes two ukuleles from Hawaii—one that is similar in size to a modern soprano ukulele, and one that is similar to a tenor (see ).

===Canada===
In the 1960s, educator J. Chalmers Doane dramatically changed school music programs across Canada, using the ukulele as an inexpensive and practical teaching instrument to foster musical literacy in the classroom. At its peak, 50,000 schoolchildren and adults learned the ukulele through the Doane program. &quot;Ukulele in the Classroom&quot;, a revised program created by James Hill and Doane in 2008, is a staple of music education in Canada.

===Japan===
The ukulele arrived in Japan in 1929 after Hawaiian-born Yukihiko Haida returned to the country upon his father&#x27;s death and introduced the instrument. Haida and his brother Katsuhiko formed the Moana Glee Club, enjoying rapid success in an environment of growing enthusiasm for Western popular music, particularly Hawaiian and jazz. During World War II, authorities banned most music from the West, but fans and players kept it alive in secret, and it resumed popularity after the war. In 1959, Haida founded the Nihon Ukulele Association. Japan has since become a second home for Hawaiian musicians and ukulele virtuosos.

===United Kingdom===

British singer and comedian George Formby was a ukulele player, though he often played a banjolele, a hybrid instrument consisting of an extended ukulele neck with a banjo resonator body. Demand surged in the new century because of its relative simplicity and portability. Another British ukulele player was Tony Award-winner Tessie O&#x27;Shea, who appeared in numerous movies and stage shows, and was twice on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, including the night The Beatles debuted in 1964.
The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain tours globally, and the George Formby Society, established in 1961, continues to hold regular conventions.

George Harrison, Paul McCartney, and John Lennon all played the ukulele.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson_8/5/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison, who was a Formby fan, was a great lover of the instrument and often gave them to friends, including Tom Petty, whom he taught to play.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whatley_4/20/2020&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States mainland===
====Pre–World War II====
The ukulele was popularized for a stateside audience during the Panama–Pacific International Exposition, held from spring to autumn of 1915 in San Francisco. The Hawaiian Pavilion featured a guitar and ukulele ensemble, George E. K. Awai and his Royal Hawaiian Quartet, along with ukulele maker and player Jonah Kumalae. The popularity of the ensemble with visitors launched a fad for Hawaiian-themed songs among Tin Pan Alley songwriters. The ensemble also introduced both the lap steel guitar and the ukulele into U.S. mainland popular music, where it was taken up by vaudeville performers such as Roy Smeck and Cliff &quot;Ukulele Ike&quot; Edwards. On April 15, 1923, at the Rivoli Theater in New York City, Smeck appeared, playing the ukulele, in &quot;Stringed Harmony&quot;, a short film made in the DeForest Phonofilm sound-on-film process. On August 6, 1926, Smeck appeared playing the ukulele in a short film &quot;His Pastimes&quot;, made in the Vitaphone sound-on-disc process, shown with the feature film &quot;Don Juan&quot; starring John Barrymore.

The ukulele soon became an icon of the Jazz Age. Like guitar, basic ukulele skills can be learned fairly easily, and this highly portable, relatively inexpensive instrument was popular with amateur players throughout the 1920s, as evidenced by the introduction of uke chord tablature into the published sheet music for popular songs of the time (a role that was supplanted by the guitar in the early years of rock and roll). A number of mainland-based stringed-instrument manufacturers, among them Regal, Harmony, and especially Martin, added ukulele, banjolele, and tiple lines to their production to take advantage of the demand.

The ukulele also made inroads into early country music or old-time music parallel to the then-popular mandolin. It was played by Jimmie Rodgers and Ernest V. Stoneman, as well as by early string bands, including Cowan Powers and his Family Band, Da Costa Woltz&#x27;s Southern Broadcasters, Walter Smith and Friends, The Blankenship Family, The Hillbillies, and The Hilltop Singers.

====Post–World War II====
From the late 1940s to the late 1960s, plastics manufacturer Mario Maccaferri turned out about 9 million inexpensive ukuleles. The ukulele remained popular, appearing in many jazz songs throughout the 50s, &#x27;60s, and &#x27;70s. Much of the instrument&#x27;s popularity (particularly the baritone size) was cultivated by Arthur Godfrey on &quot;The Arthur Godfrey Show&quot; on television. Singer-musician Tiny Tim became closely associated with the instrument after playing it on his 1968 hit &quot;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&quot;.
====Post-1990 revival====
After the 1960s, the ukulele declined in popularity until the late 1990s, when interest in the instrument reawakened. During the 1990s, new manufacturers began producing ukuleles and a new generation of musicians took up the instrument. Jim Beloff set out to promote the instrument in the early 1990s and created over two dozen ukulele music books featuring modern music and classic ukulele pieces.

All-time best-selling Hawaiian musician Israel Kamakawiwo&#x27;ole helped repopularize the instrument, in particular with his 1993 reggae-rhythmed medley of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; and &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;, used in films, television programs, and commercials. The song reached number 12 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot Digital Tracks chart the week of January 31, 2004.

The creation of YouTube helped revive the popularity of the ukulele. One of the first videos to go viral was Jake Shimabukuro&#x27;s ukulele rendition of George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. The video quickly went viral, and as of September 2020, had received over 17 million views.

==Construction==
The ukulele is generally made of wood, though variants have been composed partially or entirely of plastic or other materials. Cheaper ukuleles are generally made from plywood or laminated woods, in some cases with a soundboard of a tonewood such as spruce. More expensive ukuleles are made of solid hardwoods such as mahogany. The traditionally preferred wood for ukuleles is a type of acacia endemic to Hawaii, called &quot;koa&quot;.

Typically, ukuleles have a figure-eight body shape similar to that of a small acoustic guitar. They are also often seen in nonstandard shapes, such as cutaway and oval, usually called a &quot;pineapple&quot; ukulele (see image below), invented by the Kamaka Ukulele company, or a boat-paddle shape, and occasionally a square shape, often made out of an old wooden cigar box.

These instruments usually have four strings; some strings may be paired in courses, giving the instrument a total of six or eight strings (primarily for greater strumming volume.) The strings themselves were originally made of catgut. Modern ukuleles use strings made from nylon polymers, synthetic gut, or fluorocarbon or wound strings composed of a (typically) nylon core wound with metal or polymers, including aluminium and silver-plated copper.

Instruments with six or eight strings in four courses are often called taropatches, or taropatch ukuleles. They were once common in the concert size, but now the tenor size is more common for six-string taropatch ukuleles. The six-string, four-course version, has two single and two double courses, and is sometimes called a &quot;lili&#x27;u&quot;, though this name also applies to the eight-string version. Eight-string baritone taropatches exist, and 5-string tenors have also been made.
==Types and sizes==
Common types of ukuleles include soprano (standard ukulele), concert, tenor, and baritone. Less common are the sopranino (also called piccolo, bambino, or &quot;pocket uke&quot;), bass, and contrabass ukuleles. Other types of ukuleles include banjo ukuleles and electric ukuleles. Of the standard ukuleles, the soprano, often called &quot;standard&quot; in Hawaii, is the second smallest and was the original size. The concert size was developed in the 1920s as an enhanced soprano, slightly larger and louder with a deeper tone. Shortly thereafter, the tenor was created, having more volume and a deeper bass tone. The baritone (resembling a smaller tenor guitar) was created in the 1940s, and the contrabass and bass are recent innovations (2010 and 2014, respectively).


The following chart shows the range of notes of standard ukulele types. Note that the range varies with the tuning and size of the instruments. The examples shown in the chart reflect the range of each instrument from the lowest standard tuning to the highest fret in the highest standard tuning. Additionally, the contrabass below aligns with the bass in the above table.

==Tuning==


One of the most common tunings for the standard or soprano ukulele is C6 tuning: G4–C4–E4–A4, which is often remembered by the notes in the &quot;My dog has fleas&quot; jingle (see sidebar). The G string is tuned an octave higher than might be expected, so this is often called &quot;high G&quot; tuning. This is known as a &quot;reentrant tuning&quot;; it enables uniquely close-harmony chording.

More rarely used with the soprano ukulele (but more common on larger sizes) is C6 linear tuning, or &quot;low G&quot; tuning, which has the G in sequence an octave lower: G3–C4–E4–A4, which is equivalent to playing the top four strings (DGBE) of a guitar with a capo on the fifth fret.

Another common tuning for the soprano ukulele is the higher string-tension D6 tuning (or simply D tuning), A4–D4–F4–B4, one step higher than the G4–C4–E4–A4 tuning. Once considered standard, this tuning was commonly used during the Hawaiian music boom of the early 20th century, and is often seen in sheet music from this period, as well as in many method books through the 1980s. D6 tuning is said by some to bring out a sweeter tone in some ukuleles, generally smaller ones. D6 tuning with a low fourth string, A3–D4–F4–B4, is sometimes called &quot;Canadian tuning&quot; after its use in the Canadian school system, mostly on concert or tenor ukuleles, and extensive use by James Hill and J. Chalmers Doane.

Whether C6 or D6 tuning should be the &quot;standard&quot; tuning is a matter of long and ongoing debate. There are historic and popular ukulele methods that have used each.

For the concert and tenor ukuleles, both reentrant and linear C6 tunings are standard; linear tuning in particular is widely used for the tenor ukulele, more so than for the soprano and concert instruments.

The baritone ukulele usually uses linear G6 tuning: D3–G3–B3–E4, the same as the highest four strings of a standard 6-string guitar.

Bass ukuleles are tuned similarly to the bass guitar and double bass: E1–A1–D2–G2 for U-Bass style instruments (sometimes called contrabass), or an octave higher, E2–A2–D3–G3, for Ohana type metal-string basses.

Sopranino ukulele tuning is less standardized. They are usually tuned re-entrant, but frequently at a higher pitch than C; for example, re-entrant G6 tuning: D5–G4–B4–E5.

As is commonly the case with string instruments, other tunings may be preferred by individual players. For example, special string sets are available to tune the baritone ukulele in linear C6. Some players tune ukuleles like other four-string instruments such as the mandolin, Venezuelan cuatro, or dotara. Ukuleles may also be tuned to open tunings, similar to the Hawaiian slack-key style.

==Related instruments==
Ukulele varieties include hybrid instruments such as the guitalele (also called guitarlele), banjo ukulele (also called banjolele), harp ukulele, lap steel ukulele, and the ukelin. It is very common to find ukuleles mixed with other stringed instruments because of the number of strings and the easy playing ability. There is also an electrically amplified variant of the ukulele. The resonator ukulele produces sound by one or more spun aluminum cones (resonators) instead of the wooden soundboard, giving it a distinct and louder tone. The Tahitian ukulele, another variant, is usually carved from a single piece of wood, and does not have a hollow soundbox, although the back is open. The Tahitian ukulele generally has eight strings made from fishing line, tuned the same as a Hawaiian ukulele in four courses, although the middle two courses are an octave higher than its Hawaiian cousin. Inspired by the Tahitian ukulele, there is the Motu Nui variant, from France, which has just four strings made from fishing line and the hole in the back is designed to produce a wah-wah effect. Mario Maccaferri invented an automatic chording device for the ukulele, called Chord Master.

Close cousins of the ukulele include the Portuguese forerunners, the &quot;cavaquinho&quot; (also commonly known as &quot;machete&quot; or &quot;braguinha&quot;) and the slightly larger &quot;rajão&quot;. Other relatives include the Venezuelan cuatro, the Colombian &quot;tiple&quot;, the &quot;timple&quot; of the Canary Islands, the Spanish &quot;vihuela&quot;, the Mexican requinto jarocho, and the Andean &quot;charango&quot; traditionally made of an armadillo shell. In Indonesia, a similar Portuguese-inspired instrument is the kroncong.

Uke Bass is close cousin to leona, a traditional bass instrument in son jarocho genre.

<text>Usability testing is a technique used in user-centered interaction design to evaluate a product by testing it on users. This can be seen as an irreplaceable usability practice, since it gives direct input on how real users use the system. It is more concerned with the design intuitiveness of the product and tested with users who have no prior exposure to it. Such testing is paramount to the success of an end product as a fully functioning application that creates confusion amongst its users will not last for long. This is in contrast with usability inspection methods where experts use different methods to evaluate a user interface without involving users.

Usability testing focuses on measuring a human-made product&#x27;s capacity to meet its intended purposes. Examples of products that commonly benefit from usability testing are food, consumer products, websites or web applications, computer interfaces, documents, and devices. Usability testing measures the usability, or ease of use, of a specific object or set of objects, whereas general human–computer interaction studies attempt to formulate universal principles.

==What it is not==
Simply gathering opinions on an object or a document is market research or qualitative research rather than usability testing. Usability testing usually involves systematic observation under controlled conditions to determine how well people can use the product. However, often both qualitative research and usability testing are used in combination, to better understand users&#x27; motivations/perceptions, in addition to their actions.

Rather than showing users a rough draft and asking, &quot;Do you understand this?&quot;, usability testing involves watching people trying to &quot;use&quot; something for its intended purpose. For example, when testing instructions for assembling a toy, the test subjects should be given the instructions and a box of parts and, rather than being asked to comment on the parts and materials, they should be asked to put the toy together. Instruction phrasing, illustration quality, and the toy&#x27;s design all affect the assembly process.

==Methods==
Setting up a usability test involves carefully creating a scenario, or a realistic situation, wherein the person performs a list of tasks using the product being tested while observers watch and take notes (dynamic verification). Several other test instruments such as scripted instructions, paper prototypes, and pre- and post-test questionnaires are also used to gather feedback on the product being tested (static verification). For example, to test the attachment function of an e-mail program, a scenario would describe a situation where a person needs to send an e-mail attachment, and asking them to undertake this task. The aim is to observe how people function in a realistic manner, so that developers can identify the problem areas and fix them. Techniques popularly used to gather data during a usability test include think aloud protocol, co-discovery learning and eye tracking.

===Hallway testing===

Hallway testing, also known as guerrilla usability, is a quick and cheap method of usability testing in which people — such as those passing by in the hallway—are asked to try using the product or service. This can help designers identify &quot;brick walls&quot;, problems so serious that users simply cannot advance, in the early stages of a new design. Anyone but project designers and engineers can be used (they tend to act as &quot;expert reviewers&quot; because they are too close to the project).

This type of testing is an example of convenience sampling and thus the results are potentially biased.

===Remote usability testing===

In a scenario where usability evaluators, developers and prospective users are located in different countries and time zones, conducting a traditional lab usability evaluation creates challenges both from the cost and logistical perspectives. These concerns led to research on remote usability evaluation, with the user and the evaluators separated over space and time. Remote testing, which facilitates evaluations being done in the context of the user&#x27;s other tasks and technology, can be either synchronous or asynchronous. The former involves real time one-on-one communication between the evaluator and the user, while the latter involves the evaluator and user working separately. Numerous tools are available to address the needs of both these approaches.

Synchronous usability testing methodologies involve video conferencing or employ remote application sharing tools such as WebEx. WebEx and GoToMeeting are the most commonly used technologies to conduct a synchronous remote usability test. However, synchronous remote testing may lack the immediacy and sense of &quot;presence&quot; desired to support a collaborative testing process. Moreover, managing interpersonal dynamics across cultural and linguistic barriers may require approaches sensitive to the cultures involved. Other disadvantages include having reduced control over the testing environment and the distractions and interruptions experienced by the participants in their native environment. One of the newer methods developed for conducting a synchronous remote usability test is by using virtual worlds.

Asynchronous methodologies include automatic collection of user&#x27;s click streams, user logs of critical incidents that occur while interacting with the application and subjective feedback on the interface by users. Similar to an in-lab study, an asynchronous remote usability test is task-based and the platform allows researchers to capture clicks and task times. Hence, for many large companies, this allows researchers to better understand visitors&#x27; intents when visiting a website or mobile site. Additionally, this style of user testing also provides an opportunity to segment feedback by demographic, attitudinal and behavioral type. The tests are carried out in the user&#x27;s own environment (rather than labs) helping further simulate real-life scenario testing. This approach also provides a vehicle to easily solicit feedback from users in remote areas quickly and with lower organizational overheads. In recent years, conducting usability testing asynchronously has also become prevalent and allows testers to provide feedback in their free time and from the comfort of their own home.

===Expert review===

Expert review is another general method of usability testing. As the name suggests, this method relies on bringing in experts with experience in the field (possibly from companies that specialize in usability testing) to evaluate the usability of a product.

A heuristic evaluation or usability audit is an evaluation of an interface by one or more human factors experts. Evaluators measure the usability, efficiency, and effectiveness of the interface based on usability principles, such as the 10 usability heuristics originally defined by Jakob Nielsen in 1994.

Nielsen&#x27;s usability heuristics, which have continued to evolve in response to user research and new devices, include:
* Visibility of system status
* Match between system and the real world
* User control and freedom
* Consistency and standards
* Error prevention
* Recognition rather than recall
* Flexibility and efficiency of use
* Aesthetic and minimalist design
* Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
* Help and documentation

===Automated expert review===

Similar to expert reviews, automated expert reviews provide usability testing but through the use of programs given rules for good design and heuristics. Though an automated review might not provide as much detail and insight as reviews from people, they can be finished more quickly and consistently. The idea of creating surrogate users for usability testing is an ambitious direction for the artificial intelligence community.

===A/B testing===
In web development and marketing, A/B testing or split testing is an experimental approach to web design (especially user experience design), which aims to identify changes to web pages that increase or maximize an outcome of interest (e.g., click-through rate for a banner advertisement). As the name implies, two versions (A and B) are compared, which are identical except for one variation that might impact a user&#x27;s behavior. Version A might be the one currently used, while version B is modified in some respect. For instance, on an e-commerce website the purchase funnel is typically a good candidate for A/B testing, as even marginal improvements in drop-off rates can represent a significant gain in sales. Significant improvements can be seen through testing elements like copy text, layouts, images and colors.

Multivariate testing or bucket testing is similar to A/B testing but tests more than two versions at the same time.

==Number of participants==

In the early 1990s, Jakob Nielsen, at that time a researcher at Sun Microsystems, popularized the concept of using numerous small usability tests—typically with only five participants each—at various stages of the development process. His argument is that, once it is found that two or three people are totally confused by the home page, little is gained by watching more people suffer through the same flawed design. &quot;Elaborate usability tests are a waste of resources. The best results come from testing no more than five users and running as many small tests as you can afford.&quot;

The claim of &quot;Five users is enough&quot; was later described by a mathematical model which states for the proportion of uncovered problems U

formula_1

where p is the probability of one subject identifying a specific problem and n the number of subjects (or test sessions). This model shows up as an asymptotic graph towards the number of real existing problems (see figure below).

In later research Nielsen&#x27;s claim has been questioned using both empirical evidence and more advanced mathematical models. Two key challenges to this assertion are:
# Since usability is related to the specific set of users, such a small sample size is unlikely to be representative of the total population so the data from such a small sample is more likely to reflect the sample group than the population they may represent
#Not every usability problem is equally easy-to-detect. Intractable problems happen to decelerate the overall process. Under these circumstances, the progress of the process is much shallower than predicted by the Nielsen/Landauer formula.

Nielsen does not advocate stopping after a single test with five users; his point is that testing with five users, fixing the problems they uncover, and then testing the revised site with five different users is a better use of limited resources than running a single usability test with 10 users. In practice, the tests are run once or twice per week during the entire development cycle, using three to five test subjects per round, and with the results delivered within 24 hours to the designers. The number of users actually tested over the course of the project can thus easily reach 50 to 100 people. Research shows that user testing conducted by organisations most commonly involves the recruitment of 5-10 participants.

In the early stage, when users are most likely to immediately encounter problems that stop them in their tracks, almost anyone of normal intelligence can be used as a test subject. In stage two, testers will recruit test subjects across a broad spectrum of abilities. For example, in one study, experienced users showed no problem using any design, from the first to the last, while naive users and self-identified power users both failed repeatedly. Later on, as the design smooths out, users should be recruited from the target population.

When the method is applied to a sufficient number of people over the course of a project, the objections raised above become addressed: The sample size ceases to be small and usability problems that arise with only occasional users are found. The value of the method lies in the fact that specific design problems, once encountered, are never seen again because they are immediately eliminated, while the parts that appear successful are tested over and over. While it&#x27;s true that the initial problems in the design may be tested by only five users, when the method is properly applied, the parts of the design that worked in that initial test will go on to be tested by 50 to 100 people.

==Example==
A 1982 Apple Computer manual for developers advised on usability testing:

# &quot;Select the target audience. Begin your human interface design by identifying your target audience. Are you writing for businesspeople or children?&quot;
# Determine how much target users know about Apple computers, and the subject matter of the software.
# Steps 1 and 2 permit designing the user interface to suit the target audience&#x27;s needs. Tax-preparation software written for accountants might assume that its users know nothing about computers but are experts on the tax code, while such software written for consumers might assume that its users know nothing about taxes but are familiar with the basics of Apple computers.

Apple advised developers, &quot;You should begin testing as soon as possible, using drafted friends, relatives, and new employees&quot;:

Designers must watch people use the program in person, because

==Education==
Usability testing has been a formal subject of academic instruction in different disciplines. Usability testing is important to composition studies and online writing instruction (OWI). Scholar Collin Bjork argues that usability testing is &quot;necessary but insufficient for developing effective OWI, unless it is also coupled with the theories of digital rhetoric.&quot;

== Survey research ==
Survey products include paper and digital surveys, forms, and instruments that can be completed or used by the survey respondent alone or with a data collector. Usability testing is most often done in web surveys and focuses on how people interact with survey, such as navigating the survey, entering survey responses, and finding help information. Usability testing complements traditional survey pretesting methods such as cognitive pretesting (how people understand the products), pilot testing (how will the survey procedures work), and expert review by a subject matter expert in survey methodology. 

In translated survey products, usability testing has shown that &quot;cultural fitness&quot; must be considered in the sentence and word levels and in the designs for data entry and navigation, and that presenting translation and visual cues of common functionalities (tabs, hyperlinks, drop-down menus, and URLs) help to improve the user experience.

<doc id="32290" wikidata="Q639738" url="?curid=32290" title="Cabinet of the United States">
<text>The Cabinet of the United States is the principal official advisory body to the president of the United States. The Cabinet generally meets with the president in a room adjacent to the Oval Office in the West Wing of the White House. The president chairs the meetings but is not formally a member of the Cabinet. The vice president of the United States serves in the Cabinet by statute. The heads of departments, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, are members of the Cabinet, and acting department heads also participate in Cabinet meetings whether or not they have been officially nominated for Senate confirmation. Members of the Cabinet are political appointees and administratively operate their departments. As appointed officers heading federal agencies, these Cabinet Secretaries are bureaucrats with full administrative control over their respective departments. The president may designate heads of other agencies and non-Senate-confirmed members of the Executive Office of the President as members of the Cabinet.

The Cabinet does not have any collective executive powers or functions of its own, and no votes need to be taken. There are 25 members: the vice president, 15 department heads, and 10 Cabinet-level officials, all except three of whom require Senate confirmation. During Cabinet meetings, the members sit in the order in which their respective department was created, with the earliest being closest to the president and the newest farthest away. However, the vice president does not have any authority over the president&#x27;s cabinet and all cabinet officials directly report to the president.

The members of the Cabinet whom the president appoints serve at the pleasure of the president. The president can dismiss them from office at any time without the approval of the Senate or downgrade their Cabinet membership status. The vice president of the United States is elected, not appointed, and serves in the Cabinet by statute. Functionally, the president may give wide latitude to department heads and often it is legally possible for a Cabinet member to exercise certain powers over his or her own department against the president&#x27;s wishes, but in practice this is highly unusual due to the threat of dismissal. The president also has the authority to organize the Cabinet, such as instituting committees. Like all federal public officials, Cabinet members are also subject to impeachment by the House of Representatives and trial in the Senate for &quot;treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors&quot;.

The Constitution of the United States does not explicitly establish a Cabinet. The Cabinet&#x27;s role is inferred from the language of the Opinion Clause (ArticleII, Section2, Clause1) of the Constitution for principal officers of departments to provide advice to the president. Additionally, the Twenty-fifth Amendment authorizes the vice president, together with a majority of the heads of the executive departments, to declare the president &quot;unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office&quot;. The heads of the executive departments are—if eligible—in the presidential line of succession. The highest-ranking cabinet member (after the vice president) is the secretary of state, who is fourth in line of succession to the president, following the vice president, the speaker of the House of Representatives and the president pro tempore of the Senate.

==History==

The tradition of the Cabinet arose out of the debates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention regarding whether the president would exercise executive authority solely or collaboratively with a cabinet of ministers or a privy council. As a result of the debates, the Constitution (ArticleII, Section1, Clause1) vests &quot;the executive power&quot; in the president singly, and authorizes—but does not compel—the president (ArticleII, Section2, Clause1) to &quot;require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices&quot;. The Constitution does not specify what the executive departments will be, how many there will be, or what their duties will be.

George Washington, the first president of the United States, organized his principal officers into a Cabinet, and it has been part of the executive branch structure ever since. Washington&#x27;s Cabinet consisted of five members: himself, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of War Henry Knox and Attorney General Edmund Randolph. Vice President John Adams was not included in Washington&#x27;s Cabinet because the position was initially regarded as a legislative officer (president of the Senate). Furthermore, until there was a vacancy in the presidency (which did not occur until the death of William Henry Harrison in 1841) it was not certain that a vice president would be allowed to serve as president for the duration of the original term as opposed to merely acting as president until new elections could be held. It was not until the 20th century that vice presidents were regularly included as members of the Cabinet and came to be regarded primarily as a member of the executive branch.

Presidents have used Cabinet meetings of selected principal officers but to widely differing extents and for different purposes. During President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s administration, Secretary of State William H. Seward advocated the use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet government. However, Lincoln rebuffed Seward. While Woodrow Wilson was a professor he also advocated a parliamentary-style Cabinet but after becoming president he did not implement it in his administration. In recent administrations, Cabinets have grown to include key White House staff in addition to department and various agency heads. President Ronald Reagan formed seven sub-cabinet councils to review many policy issues, and subsequent presidents have followed that practice.

==Federal law==
In with regard to delegation of authority by the president, it is provided that &quot;nothing herein shall be deemed to require express authorization in any case in which such an official would be presumed in law to have acted by authority or direction of the president.&quot; This pertains directly to the heads of the executive departments as each of their offices is created and specified by statutory law (hence the presumption) and thus gives them the authority to act for the president within their areas of responsibility without any specific delegation.

Under (also known as the 1967 Federal Anti-Nepotism statute), federal officials are prohibited from appointing their immediate family members to certain governmental positions, including those in the Cabinet.

Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, an administration may appoint acting heads of department from employees of the relevant department. These may be existing high-level career employees, from political appointees of the outgoing administration (for new administrations), or sometimes lower-level appointees of the administration.

==Confirmation process==

The heads of the executive departments and all other federal agency heads are nominated by the president and then presented to the Senate for confirmation or rejection by a simple majority (although before the use of the &quot;nuclear option&quot; during the 113th United States Congress, they could have been blocked by filibuster, requiring cloture to be invoked by supermajority to further consideration). If approved, they receive their commission scroll, are sworn in, and begin their duties. When the Senate is not in session, the president can appoint acting heads of the executive departments, and do so at the beginning of their term.

An elected vice president does not require Senate confirmation, nor does the White House chief of staff, which is an appointed staff position of the Executive Office of the President.

===Salary===

The heads of the executive departments and most other senior federal officers at cabinet or sub-cabinet level receive their salary under a fixed five-level pay plan known as the Executive Schedule, which is codified in Title 5 of the United States Code. Twenty-one positions, including the heads of the executive departments and others, receiving LevelI pay are listed in , and those forty-six positions on LevelII pay (including the number two positions of the executive departments) are listed in . , the LevelI annual pay was set at $250,600.

The annual salary of the vice president is $235,300. The salary level was set by the Government Salary Reform Act of 1989, which provides an automatic cost of living adjustment for federal employees. The vice president receives the same pension as other members of Congress as the president of the Senate.

==Current Cabinet and Cabinet-rank officials==

The individuals listed below were nominated by President Donald Trump to form his Cabinet and were confirmed by the United States Senate on the date noted or are serving as acting department heads by his request, pending the confirmation of his nominees.

===Vice president and the heads of the executive departments===

The Cabinet permanently includes the vice president and the heads of 15 executive departments, listed here according to their order of succession to the presidency. The speaker of the House and the president &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the Senate follow the vice president and precede the secretary of state in the order of succession, but both are in the legislative branch and are not part of the Cabinet.

===Cabinet-level officials===
The president may designate additional positions to be members of the Cabinet, which can vary under each president. They are not in the line of succession and are not necessarily officers of the United States.

==Former executive and Cabinet-level departments==
* Department of War (1789–1947), headed by the secretary of war: renamed Department of the Army by the National Security Act of 1947.
* Department of the Navy (1798–1949), headed by the secretary of the Navy: became a military department within the Department of Defense.
* Post Office Department (1829–1971), headed by the postmaster general: reorganized as the United States Postal Service, an independent agency.
* National Military Establishment (1947–1949), headed by the secretary of Defense: created by the National Security Act of 1947 and recreated as the Department of Defense in 1949.
* Department of the Army (1947–1949), headed by the secretary of the Army: became a military department within the Department of Defense.
* Department of the Air Force (1947–1949), headed by the secretary of the Air Force: became a military department within the Department of Defense.

==Renamed heads of the executive departments==
* Secretary of Foreign Affairs: created in July 1781 and renamed Secretary of State in September 1789.
* Secretary of War: created in 1789 and was renamed as Secretary of the Army by the National Security Act of 1947. The 1949 Amendments to the National Security Act of 1947 made the secretary of the Army a subordinate to the secretary of defense.
* Secretary of Commerce and Labor: created in 1903 and renamed Secretary of Commerce in 1913 when its labor functions were transferred to the new secretary of labor.
* Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare: created in 1953 and renamed Secretary of Health and Human Services in 1979 when its education functions were transferred to the new secretary of education.

==Positions intermittently elevated to Cabinet-rank==
* Vice President (1921–1923, 1929–present)
* Ambassador to the United Nations (1953–1989, 1993–2001, 2009–2018, 2021–present)

<text>The Universal House of Justice is the nine-member supreme ruling body of the Baháʼí Faith. It was envisioned by Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, as an institution that could legislate on issues not already addressed in the Baháʼí writings, providing flexibility for the Baháʼí Faith to adapt to changing conditions. It was first elected in 1963, and subsequently every five years, by delegates consisting of the members of Baháʼí National Spiritual Assemblies throughout the world.

The Universal House of Justice, as the head of the religion, has provided direction to the worldwide Baháʼí community primarily through a series of multi-year plans, as well as through annual messages delivered during the Ridván festival. The messages have focused on increasing the number of Local Spiritual Assemblies, translating Baháʼí literature, establishing Baháʼí Centres, completing Baháʼí Houses of Worship, holding international conferences, and developing educational systems to enhance literacy, the role of women, spirituality for children and youth, family life, social and economic development, and communal worship. The Universal House of Justice has also played a role in responding to systemic persecution of Baháʼís in Iran by garnering worldwide media attention.

The books and documents published by the Universal House of Justice are considered authoritative and its decisions are considered infallible by Baháʼís. Although it is empowered to legislate on matters that are not addressed in the Baha&#x27;i holy writings, the Universal House of Justice has rarely exercised this function.

The Seat of the Universal House of Justice and its members reside in Haifa, Israel, on the slope of Mount Carmel. The most recent election was 29 April 2023. Although all other elected and appointed roles in the Baháʼí Faith are open to men and women, membership on the Universal House of Justice is male-only; the Baháʼí writings indicate that the reason for this will become clear in the future.

==History==
Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, in his book the &quot;Kitáb-i-Aqdas&quot; first ordains the institution of the House of Justice and defines its functions. The institution&#x27;s responsibilities are also expanded on and referred to in several other of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s writings including in his &quot;Tablets of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&quot;. In those writings Baháʼu&#x27;lláh writes that the Universal House of Justice would assume authority over the religion, and would consider matters that had not been covered by himself; he stated that the members of the institution would be assured of divine inspiration, and have the regard for all peoples and safe-guard their honour.

Later, ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s son and successor, in his Will and Testament, elaborated on its functioning, its composition and outlined the method for its election. He wrote that the Universal House of Justice would be under Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s protection, that it would be freed of error, and that obedience to it would be obligatory. ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá first used the term &quot;Universal House of Justice&quot; to distinguish the supreme body from those local &#x27;Houses of Justice&#x27; to be established in each community, and the secondary &#x27;Houses of Justice&#x27; (current Baháʼí national spiritual assemblies). He also stated that the institution&#x27;s decisions could be by majority vote, but that unanimous decisions were preferred, and that it would be elected by the members of the secondary Houses of Justice. He also confirmed Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s statements that although women and men are spiritually equal, membership on the Universal House of Justice would be confined to men, and that the wisdom behind this decision would become apparent in the future (see Baháʼí Faith and gender equality).

While both ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, heads of the religion after Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, considered establishing the Universal House of Justice, they both declined to do so. Shoghi Effendi&#x27;s reason was due to his belief in the weakness of the existing Baháʼí institutions — there were a very limited number of national spiritual assemblies and local spiritual assemblies. Thus during his lifetime, Shoghi Effendi prepared for the election of the Universal House of Justice, by establishing a strong administrative structure at the local and national levels. In 1951 when there were 9 National Spiritual Assemblies, Shoghi Effendi appointed members to the International Baháʼí Council, and described it as an embryonic international House of Justice. After Shoghi Effendi&#x27;s unexpected death in 1957, the Hands of the Cause directed the affairs of the religion and announced that the election of the Universal House of Justice would occur in 1963 at the end of the Ten Year Crusade, an international teaching plan instituted by Shoghi Effendi.

In 1961 the International Baháʼí Council was changed to an elected body, with members of all National Spiritual Assemblies voting for its members. Then in April 1963, the first Universal House of Justice was elected, six years after the passing of Shoghi Effendi, by 56 National Spiritual Assemblies. The date of the election coincided with the completion of the Ten Year Crusade and also with the first centenary anniversary of the public declaration of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh in the Garden of Ridván in April 1863. Since then the Universal House of Justice has acted as the head of the religion – individual members have no authority, only as an assembly do they have authority. In 1972 it published its constitution.

==Election process==
The Universal House of Justice is elected through secret ballot and plurality vote in a three-stage election by adult Baháʼís throughout the world. The House of Justice is elected without nominations or campaigning and all adult male members of the Baháʼí Faith are eligible for election to the House. The body is elected every five years during a convention of the members of the various National or Regional Spiritual Assemblies (NSAs) across the world. Each member of the various NSAs, who were themselves elected by the Baháʼís of their country, votes for nine adult male Baháʼís. Absentee ballots are mailed or carried by delegates. The nine people who have the most votes are elected onto the Universal House of Justice.

In 2013, in addition to those present in Haifa, approximately 400 absentee ballots were cast, taking the total number of ballots cast to over 1500. This election marked the 50th anniversary of the first election of the Universal House of Justice in 1963.

The most recent full election was on 29 April 2023.

==Responsibilities==

The Universal House of Justice today guides the growth and development of the global Baháʼí community. The general functions of the Universal House of Justice, as stated by Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, include to promulgate the cause of God, to preserve the law, to administer social affairs, to educate the people&#x27;s souls, to guarantee the education of children, to make the entire world prosperous (eliminate extremes of wealth and poverty), and to care for the elderly and the ill who are in poverty. According to the constitution of the Universal House of Justice, some of its powers and duties include:
* Promoting the spiritual qualities that characterize Baháʼí life individually and collectively
* Preserving, translating and publishing Baháʼí sacred texts
* Defending and protecting the global Baháʼí community from repression and persecution
* Preserving and developing the world spiritual and administrative centre of the Baháʼí Faith
* Encouraging the growth and maturation of the Baháʼí community and administration
* Safeguarding individual personal rights, freedoms and initiatives
* Applying Baháʼí principles and laws
* Developing, abrogating and changing laws that are not recorded in the Baháʼí sacred texts, according to the requirements of the time
* Pronouncing sanctions against violations of Baháʼí law
* Adjudicating and arbitrating of disputes referred to it
* Administrating all religious funds and endowments such as Huqúqu&#x27;lláh that are entrusted to its care

Furthermore, the Universal House of Justice is instructed by Baháʼu&#x27;lláh to exert a positive influence on the general welfare of humankind, to promote a permanent peace among the nations of the world, ensure the &quot;training of peoples, the up building of nations, the protection of man and the safeguarding of his honour&quot;.

===Jurisdiction===

The Universal House of Justice is also given the responsibility of adapting the Baháʼí Faith as society progresses, and is thus given the power to legislate on matters not explicitly covered in the Baháʼí sacred texts. While the Universal House of Justice is authorized to change or repeal its own legislation as conditions change, it cannot dissolve or change any of the laws which are explicitly written in the sacred texts.

==Publications==

While being empowered to legislate on matters, the Universal House of Justice has, since its inception in 1963, limited its exercise of this function. Instead, it has provided general guidance to Baháʼís around the world, and not specific laws; this guidance has generally been through the form of letters and messages, much like Shoghi Effendi&#x27;s communications. Many of these letters have been published in compilations and are regarded as divinely empowered and authoritative; its decisions are considered infallible to Baháʼís. The letters cover a range of subjects including teaching, prayer, family life, education and Baháʼí administration. Each year on the first day of Ridván (which may be on April 20 or 21 depending on the dating of Naw-Rúz), the Universal House of Justice addresses a message to the worldwide Baháʼí community, known as Ridván messages.

The institution has also collected and published extracts from the writings of the Báb, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh and ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá. In 1992 they published the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s book of laws in English, and further translations have since been published. During these endeavours, they established departments of research and archives at the Baháʼí World Centre, and, as of 1983, have collected over 60,000 letters of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi. These collected works have been used as a base in the deliberations of the Universal House of Justice.

==Past members==

The initial election in 1963 drew five members from the International Baháʼí Council, two from the National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) of the United States, one from the NSA of Britain, and one from the NSA of India.

Members are entered in the table under the year when they were first elected. Starting with the first election in 1963, regular elections of the entire membership have occurred every five years, and there have been five by-elections, noted in the table with &quot;italics&quot;, in 1982, 1987, 2000, 2005 and 2010. All members have continued to serve after re-election in subsequent conventions. Amoz Gibson, Charles Wolcott, and Adib Taherzadeh died while in office while the other former members were allowed to retire.

<doc id="32293" wikidata="Q14213" url="?curid=32293" title="United States Secretary of State">
<text>The United States secretary of state (SecState) is a member of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States and the head of the U.S. Department of State. 

The secretary of state serves as the principal advisor to the president of the United States on all foreign affairs matters. The secretary carries out the president&#x27;s foreign policies through the State Department, which includes the Foreign Service, Civil Service, and U.S. Agency for International Development. The office holder is the second-highest-ranking member of the president&#x27;s cabinet, after the vice president, and ranks fourth in the presidential line of succession; first amongst cabinet secretaries.

Created in 1789 with Thomas Jefferson as its first office holder, the secretary of state represents the United States to foreign countries, and is therefore considered analogous to a secretary or minister of foreign affairs in other countries. The secretary of state is nominated by the president of the United States and, following a confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, is confirmed by the Senate. The secretary of state, along with the secretary of the treasury, secretary of defense, and attorney general, are generally regarded as the four most crucial Cabinet members because of the importance of their respective departments.

The secretary of state is a Level I position in the Executive Schedule and thus earns the salary prescribed for that level $250,600, as of January 2025.

== History ==
The secretary of state originates from the government under the Articles of Confederation. The Congress of the Confederation established the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1781 and created the office of secretary of foreign affairs. After the Constitution of the United States was ratified, the 1st United States Congress reestablished the department, renaming it the Department of State, and created the office of secretary of state to lead the department.

==Duties and responsibilities==

The stated duties of the secretary of state are to supervise the United States foreign service and immigration policy and administer the Department of State. The secretary must also advise the president on U.S. foreign matters such as the appointment of diplomats and ambassadors, advising the president of the dismissal and recall of these people. The secretary of state can conduct negotiations, interpret, and terminate treaties relating to foreign policy. The secretary also can participate in international conferences, organizations, and agencies as a representative of the United States. The secretary communicates issues relating to the U.S. foreign policy to Congress and citizens. The secretary also provides services to U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad such as providing credentials in the form of passports. Doing this, the secretary also ensures the protection of citizens, their property, and interests in foreign countries.

Secretaries of state also have domestic responsibilities. Most of the historical domestic functions of the Department of State were gradually transferred to other agencies by the late 19th century as part of various administrative reforms and restructurings. Those that remain include storage and use of the Great Seal, performance of protocol functions for the White House, and the drafting of certain proclamations. The secretary also negotiates with the individual states over the extradition of fugitives to foreign countries. Under federal law, the resignation of a president or of a vice president is valid only if declared in writing, in an instrument delivered to the office of the secretary of state. Accordingly, the resignations of President Richard Nixon and of Vice President Spiro Agnew were formalized in instruments delivered to then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.

Although they have historically decreased over time, Congress may occasionally add to the responsibilities of the secretary of state. One such instance occurred in 2014, when Congress passed the Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act which mandated actions the secretary of state must take in order to facilitate the return of abducted children from nations who are party to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.

As the highest-ranking member of the cabinet, the secretary of state is the third-highest official of the executive branch of the U.S. federal government, after the president and vice president, and is fourth in line to succeed the presidency, after the vice president, the speaker of the House of Representatives, and the president pro tempore of the Senate.

Six past secretaries of stateJefferson, Madison, Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Van Buren and Buchananhave gone on to be elected president. Others, including Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, Lewis Cass, John C. Calhoun, John M. Clayton, William L. Marcy, William Seward, Edward Everett, Jeremiah S. Black, James Blaine, Elihu B. Washburne, Thomas F. Bayard, John Sherman, Walter Q. Gresham, William Jennings Bryan, Philander C. Knox, Charles Evans Hughes, Elihu Root, Cordell Hull, Edmund Muskie, Alexander Haig, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, and Marco Rubio have also campaigned as presidential candidates, either before or after their term of office as secretary of state, but were ultimately unsuccessful. The position of secretary of state has therefore been viewed to be a consolation prize for failed presidential candidates.

<doc id="32298" wikidata="Q944436" url="?curid=32298" title="USS Constitution">
<text>USS &quot;Constitution, also known as Old Ironsides&quot;, is a three-masted wooden-hulled heavy frigate of the United States Navy. The ship is the world&#x27;s oldest commissioned naval warship still afloat. The ship was launched in 1797, one of six original frigates authorized for construction by the Naval Act of 1794 and the third constructed. The name &quot;Constitution&quot; was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March or May the frigates that were to be constructed. Joshua Humphreys designed the frigates to be the young Navy&#x27;s capital ships, and so &quot;Constitution&quot; and its sister ships were larger and more heavily armed and built than standard frigates of the period. The ship was built at Edmund Hartt&#x27;s shipyard in the North End of Boston, Massachusetts. Its first duties were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the Quasi-War with France and to defeat the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War.

&quot;Constitution&quot; is most noted for its actions during the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom, when the ship captured numerous merchant ships and defeated five British warships: , , , , and . The battle with &quot;Guerriere&quot; earned itself the nickname &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;, adding on the public adoration that had repeatedly saved it from scrapping. The ship continued to serve as flagship in the Mediterranean and African squadrons, and the ship circled the world in the 1840s. During the American Civil War, the ship served as a training ship for the United States Naval Academy. The ship carried American artwork and industrial displays to the Paris Exposition of 1878.

&quot;Constitution&quot; was retired from active service in 1881 and served as a receiving ship until being designated a museum ship in 1907. In 1934, it completed a three-year, 90-port tour of the nation. It sailed under its own power for its 200th birthday in 1997, and again in August 2012 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of its victory over &quot;Guerriere&quot;.

&quot;Constitution&quot;″s stated mission today is to promote understanding of the Navy&#x27;s role in war and peace through educational outreach, historical demonstration, and active participation in public events as part of the Naval History and Heritage Command. As it is a fully commissioned Navy ship, its crew of 75 officers and sailors participate in ceremonies, educational programs, and special events while keeping it open to visitors year round and providing free tours. The officers and crew are all active-duty Navy personnel, and the assignment is considered to be special duty. It is usually berthed at Pier 1 of the former Charlestown Navy Yard at one end of Boston&#x27;s Freedom Trail.

==Construction==
In 1785, Barbary pirates, most notably from Algiers, began to seize American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1793 alone, 11 American ships were captured and their crews and stores held for ransom. To combat this problem, proposals were made for warships to protect American shipping, resulting in the Naval Act of 1794. The act provided funds to construct six frigates, but it included a clause that the construction of the ships would be halted if peace terms were agreed to with Algiers.

Joshua Humphreys&#x27; design was unusual for the time, being deep, long on keel, narrow of beam (width), and mounting very heavy guns. The design called for diagonal
riders intended to restrict hogging and sagging while giving the ships extremely heavy planking. This design gave the hull a greater strength than a more lightly built frigate. It was based on Humphrey&#x27;s realization that the fledgling United States could not match the European states in the size of their navies, so they were designed to overpower any other frigate while escaping from a ship of the line.

The ship&#x27;s keel was laid down on 1 November 1794 at Edmund Hartt&#x27;s shipyard in Boston, Massachusetts, under the supervision of Captain Samuel Nicholson, master shipwright Colonel George Claghorn and Foreman Prince Athearn of the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Athearns. &quot;Constitution&quot;″s hull was built thick and its length between perpendiculars was , with a length overall and a width of . In total, of trees were needed for its construction. Primary materials consisted of pine and oak, including southern live oak which was cut from Gascoigne Bluff and milled near St. Simons Island, Georgia. Enslaved workers were used to harvest the oak used for the ship&#x27;s construction, and USS Constitution Museum historian Carl Herzog stated that &quot;the forced labor of enslaved people was an expediency that Navy officials and contractors saw as fundamental to the job... enslaved people were essential to the construction of naval warships built to secure the very American freedoms they were denied.&quot;

A peace accord was announced between the United States and Algiers in March 1796, and construction was halted in accordance with the Naval Act of 1794. After some debate and prompting by President Washington, Congress agreed to continue funding the construction of the three ships nearest to completion: , , and &quot;Constitution&quot;. &quot;Constitution&quot;″s launching ceremony on 20 September 1797 was attended by President John Adams and Massachusetts Governor Increase Sumner. Upon launch, it slid down the ways only before stopping; its weight had caused the ways to settle into the ground, preventing further movement. An attempt two days later resulted in only of additional travel before the ship again stopped. After a month of rebuilding the ways, &quot;Constitution&quot; finally slipped into Boston Harbor on 21 October 1797, with Captain James Sever breaking a bottle of Madeira wine on its bowsprit.

===Armament===

&quot;Constitution&quot; was rated as a 44-gun frigate, but it often carried more than 50 guns at a time. Ships of this era had no permanent battery of guns such as those of modern Navy ships. The guns and cannons were designed to be completely portable and often were exchanged between ships as situations warranted. Each commanding officer outfitted armaments to his liking, taking into consideration factors such as the overall weight of stores, complement of personnel aboard, and planned routes to be sailed. Consequently, the armaments on ships changed often during their careers, and records of the changes were not generally kept.

During the War of 1812, &quot;Constitution&quot;″s battery of guns typically consisted of 30 long 24-pounder (11 kg) cannons, with 15 on each side of the gun deck. Twenty-two more guns were deployed on the spar deck, 11 per side, each a short 32-pounder (15 kg) carronade. Four chase guns were also positioned, two each at the stern and bow.

All of the guns aboard &quot;Constitution&quot; have been replicas since its 1927–1931 restoration. Most were cast in 1930, but two carronades on the spar deck were cast in 1983. A modern saluting gun was hidden inside the forward long gun on each side during its 1973–1976 restoration in order to restore the capability of firing ceremonial salutes.

==Quasi-War==
President John Adams ordered all Navy ships to sea in late May 1798 to patrol for armed French ships and to free any American ship captured by them. &quot;Constitution&quot; was still not ready to sail and eventually had to borrow sixteen 18-pound (8.2 kg) cannons from Castle Island before finally being ready. The ship put to sea on the evening of 22 July 1798 with orders to patrol the Eastern seaboard between New Hampshire and New York. it was patrolling between Chesapeake Bay and Savannah, Georgia, a month later when Nicholson found his first opportunity for capturing a prize. They intercepted &quot;Niger&quot; off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina, on 8 September, a 24-gun ship sailing with a French crew en route from Jamaica to Philadelphia, claiming to have been under the orders of Great Britain. Nicholson had the crewmen imprisoned, perhaps not understanding his orders correctly. He placed a prize crew aboard &quot;Niger&quot; and brought her into Norfolk, Virginia.

&quot;Constitution&quot; sailed south again a week later to escort a merchant convoy, but her bowsprit was severely damaged in a gale and it returned to Boston for repairs. In the meantime, Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert determined that &quot;Niger&quot; had been operating under the orders of Great Britain as claimed, and the ship and her crew were released to continue their voyage. The American government paid a restitution of $11,000 () to Great Britain.

&quot;Constitution&quot; departed Boston on 29 December. Nicholson reported to Commodore John Barry, who was flying his flag in &quot;United States&quot; near the island of Dominica for patrols in the West Indies. On 15 January 1799, &quot;Constitution&quot; intercepted the English merchantman &quot;Spencer&quot;, which had been taken prize by the French frigate &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; a few days prior. Technically, &quot;Spencer&quot; was a French ship operated by a French prize crew; but Nicholson released the ship and her crew the next morning, perhaps hesitant after the affair with &quot;Niger&quot;. Upon joining Barry&#x27;s command, &quot;Constitution&quot; almost immediately had to put in for repairs to her rigging due to storm damage, and it was not until 1 March that anything of note occurred. On this date, it encountered , whose captain was an acquaintance of Nicholson&#x27;s. The two agreed to a sailing duel, which the English captain was confident he would win. But after 11 hours of sailing, &quot;Santa Margarita&quot; lowered her sails and admitted defeat, paying off the bet with a cask of wine to Nicholson. Resuming her patrols, &quot;Constitution&quot; managed to recapture the American sloop &quot;Neutrality&quot; on 27 March. On 4 April 1799 it recaptured His Majesty&#x27;s Packet &quot;Carteret&quot; that had been captured by the French on 29 March. Secretary Stoddert had other plans, however, and recalled &quot;Constitution&quot; to Boston. It arrived there on 14 May, and Nicholson was relieved of command.

===Change of command===

Captain Silas Talbot was recalled to duty to command &quot;Constitution&quot; and serve as Commodore of operations in the West Indies. After repairs and resupply were completed, &quot;Constitution&quot; departed Boston on 23 July with a destination of Saint-Domingue via Norfolk and a mission to interrupt French shipping. The ship departed Norfolk on 14 August. It recaptured the Hamberg ship &quot;Amelia&quot; from a French prize crew on 15 September, and Talbot sent the ship back to New York City with an American prize crew. The ship was sold but the Court ordered the money returned to her owners. &quot;Constitution&quot; arrived at Saint-Domingue on 15 October and rendezvoused with , , and . No further incidents occurred over the next six months, as French depredations in the area had declined. &quot;Constitution&quot; busied herself with routine patrols, and Talbot made diplomatic visits. On 2 February 1800 put men aboard an unidentified American schooner and had it sent to New York for possible illegal trading. It was not until April 1800 that Talbot investigated an increase in ship traffic near Puerto Plata, Santo Domingo, and discovered that the French privateer &quot;Sandwich&quot; had taken refuge there. On 8 May the squadron captured the sloop &quot;Sally&quot;, and Talbot hatched a plan to capture &quot;Sandwich&quot; by utilizing the familiarity of &quot;Sally&quot; to allow the Americans access to the harbor. On 9 May her Tender &quot;Amphitheatre&quot; engaged a French privateer schooner that, after a short action, was run aground and abandoned by her crew. The privateer was captured and refloated and her two prizes, brig &quot;Nymph&quot; and schooner &quot;Esther&quot;, were recaptured. First Lieutenant Isaac Hull led 90 sailors and Marines into Puerto Plata without challenge on 11 May, capturing &quot;Sandwich&quot; and spiking the guns of the nearby Spanish fort. However, it was later determined that &quot;Sandwich&quot; had been captured from a neutral port; it was returned to the French with apologies, and no prize money was awarded to the squadron.

Routine patrols again occupied &quot;Constitution&quot; for the next two months, until 13 July, when the mainmast trouble of a few months before recurred. The ship put into Cape François for repairs. While leaving the roads of Cape Francois on 22 July it struck a reef and was pulled off 45 minutes later. With the terms of enlistment soon to expire for the sailors aboard her, it made preparations to return to the United States and was relieved of duty by &quot;Constellation&quot; on 23 July. &quot;Constitution&quot; escorted 12 merchantmen to Philadelphia on her return voyage, and on 25 August arrived in President Roads, off Boston, and put in quarantine. The ship received new masts, sails, and rigging. Even though peace was imminent between the United States and France, &quot;Constitution&quot; again sailed for the West Indies on 17 December as squadron flagship, rendezvousing with , , , , and . Although no longer allowed to pursue French shipping, the squadron was assigned to protect American shipping and continued in that capacity until April 1801, when arrived with orders for the squadron to return to the United States. &quot;Constitution&quot; returned to Boston. Captain Talbot resigned his Commission 8 September, 1801 and Lt.Isaac Hull was ordered to take command in a letter dated 21 September, 1801. It was finally scheduled for an overhaul, Captain Samuel Nicholson was ordered to supervise the work in a letter dated 1 April, 1802. It was canceled in a letter dated 18 June with the crew ordered discharged, Capt. Nicholson was relieved by her Sailing Master Nathaniel Harden. It was placed in ordinary on 2 July 1802.

==First Barbary War==
The United States paid tribute to the Barbary States during the Quasi-War to ensure that American merchant ships were not harassed and seized. In 1801, Yusuf Karamanli of Tripoli was dissatisfied that the United States was paying him less than they paid Algiers, and he demanded an immediate payment of $250,000 (). In response, Thomas Jefferson sent a squadron of frigates to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and to pursue peace with the Barbary States.

The first squadron under the command of Richard Dale in was instructed to escort merchant ships through the Mediterranean and to negotiate with leaders of the Barbary States. A second squadron was assembled under the command of Richard Valentine Morris in . The performance of Morris&#x27;s squadron was so poor, however, that he was recalled and subsequently dismissed from the Navy in 1803.

Captain Edward Preble ordered to take command of &quot;Constitution&quot; in a letter dated 14 May 1803 as his flagship and made preparations to command a new squadron for a third blockade attempt. The ship was recommissioned on 20 May. The copper sheathing on her hull needed to be replaced and Paul Revere supplied the copper sheets necessary for the job that took 14 days, ending on 25 June. The ship departed Boston on 14 August, and it encountered an unknown ship in the darkness on 6 September, near the Rock of Gibraltar. &quot;Constitution&quot; went to general quarters, then ran alongside the unknown ship. Preble hailed her, only to receive a hail in return. He identified his ship as the United States frigate &quot;Constitution&quot; but received an evasive answer from the other ship. Preble replied: &quot;I am now going to hail you for the last time. If a proper answer is not returned, I will fire a shot into you.&quot; The stranger returned, &quot;If you give me a shot, I&#x27;ll give you a broadside.&quot; Preble demanded that the other ship identify herself and the stranger replied, &quot;This is His Britannic Majesty&#x27;s ship &quot;Donegal&quot;, 84 guns, Sir Richard Strachan, an English commodore.&quot; He then commanded Preble, &quot;Send your boat on board.&quot; Preble was now devoid of all patience and exclaimed, &quot;This is United States ship &quot;Constitution&quot;, 44 guns, Edward Preble, an American commodore, who will be damned before he sends his boat on board of any vessel.&quot; And then to his gun crews: &quot;Blow your matches, boys!&quot; Before the incident escalated further, however, a boat arrived from the other ship and a British lieutenant relayed his captain&#x27;s apologies. The ship was in fact not &quot;Donegal&quot; but instead &quot;HMS Maidstone&quot;, a 32-gun frigate. &quot;Constitution&quot; had come alongside her so quietly that &quot;Maidstone&quot; had delayed answering with the proper hail while it readied her guns. This act began the strong allegiance between Preble and the officers under his command, known as &quot;Preble&#x27;s boys&quot;, as he had shown that he was willing to defy a presumed ship of the line.

&quot;Constitution&quot; arrived at Gibraltar on 12 September, where Preble waited for the other ships of the squadron. His first order of business was to arrange a treaty with Sultan Slimane of Morocco, who was holding American ships hostage to ensure the return of two vessels that the Americans had captured. &quot;Constitution&quot; and departed Gibraltar on 3 October and arrived at Tangier on the 4th. &quot;Adams&quot; and arrived the next day. With four American warships in his harbor, the Sultan was glad to arrange the transfer of ships between the two nations, and Preble departed with his squadron on 14 October, heading back to Gibraltar.

===Battle of Tripoli Harbor===

 ran aground off Tripoli on 31 October under the command of William Bainbridge while pursuing a Tripoline vessel. The crew was taken prisoner; &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was refloated by the Tripolines and brought into their harbor. To deprive the Tripolines of their prize, Preble planned to destroy &quot;Philadelphia&quot; using the captured ship &quot;Mastico&quot;, which was renamed . &quot;Intrepid&quot; entered Tripoli Harbor on 16 February 1804 under the command of Stephen Decatur, disguised as a merchant ship. Decatur&#x27;s crew quickly overpowered the Tripoline crew and set &quot;Philadelphia&quot; ablaze.

Preble withdrew the squadron to Syracuse, Sicily, and began planning for a summer attack on Tripoli. He procured a number of smaller gunboats that could move in closer to Tripoli than was feasible for &quot;Constitution&quot;, given her deep draft. &quot;Constitution&quot;, , , , , the six gunboats, and two bomb ketches arrived the morning of 3 August and immediately began operations. Twenty-two Tripoline gunboats met them in the harbor; &quot;Constitution&quot; and her squadron severely damaged or destroyed the Tripoline gunboats in a series of attacks over the coming month, taking their crews prisoner. &quot;Constitution&quot; primarily provided gunfire support, bombarding the shore batteries of Tripoli—yet Karamanli remained firm in his demand for ransom and tribute, despite his losses.

Preble outfitted &quot;Intrepid&quot; as a &quot;floating volcano&quot; with of gunpowder aboard in a final attempt of the season. The ship was to sail into Tripoli harbor and blow up in the midst of the corsair fleet, close under the walls of the city. &quot;Intrepid&quot; made her way into the harbor on the evening of 3 September under the command of Richard Somers, but it exploded prematurely, killing Somers and his entire crew of thirteen volunteers.

&quot;Constellation&quot; and &quot;President&quot; arrived at Tripoli on the 9th with Samuel Barron in command; Preble was forced to relinquish his command of the squadron to Barron, who was senior in rank. &quot;Constitution&quot; was ordered to Malta on the 11th for repairs and, while en route, captured two Greek vessels attempting to deliver wheat into Tripoli. On the 12th, a collision with &quot;President&quot; severely damaged &quot;Constitution&quot;″s bow, stern, and figurehead of Hercules. The collision was attributed to an act of God in the form of a sudden change in wind direction.

===Peace treaty===
Captain John Rodgers assumed command of &quot;Constitution&quot; on 9 November 1804 while it underwent repairs and resupply in Malta. The ship resumed the blockade of Tripoli on 5 April 1805, capturing a Tripoline xebec, along with two prizes that the xebec had captured. Meanwhile, Commodore Barron gave William Eaton naval support to bombard Derne, while a detachment of US Marines under the command of Presley O&#x27;Bannon was assembled to attack the city by land. They captured it on 27 April. A peace treaty with Tripoli was signed aboard &quot;Constitution&quot; on 3 June, in which it embarked the crew members of &quot;Philadelphia&quot; and returned them to Syracuse. The ship was then dispatched to Tunis and arrived there on 30 July. Seventeen additional American warships had gathered in its harbor by 1 August: &quot;Congress&quot;, &quot;Constellation&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, , , , , &quot;Nautilus&quot;, &quot;Syren&quot;, and eight gunboats. Negotiations went on for several days until a short-term blockade of the harbor finally produced a peace treaty on 14 August.

Rodgers remained in command of the squadron, sending warships back to the United States when they were no longer needed. Eventually, all that remained were &quot;Constitution&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and &quot;Hornet&quot;. They performed routine patrols and observed the French and Royal Navy operations of the Napoleonic Wars. Rodgers turned over the command of the squadron and &quot;Constitution&quot; to Captain Hugh G. Campbell on 29 May 1806.

James Barron sailed &quot;Chesapeake&quot; out of Norfolk on 15 May 1807 to replace &quot;Constitution&quot; as the flagship of the Mediterranean squadron, but he encountered , resulting in the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;–&quot;Leopard&quot; affair and delaying the relief of &quot;Constitution&quot;. &quot;Constitution&quot; continued patrols, unaware of the delay. The ship arrived in late June at Leghorn, where it took aboard the disassembled Tripoli Monument for transport back to the United States. Campbell learned the fate of &quot;Chesapeake&quot; when he arrived at Málaga, and he immediately began preparing &quot;Constitution&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; for possible war against Britain. The crew became mutinous upon learning of the delay in their relief and refused to sail any farther unless the destination was the United States. Campbell and his officers threatened to fire a cannon loaded with grapeshot at the crewmen if they did not comply, thereby putting an end to the conflict. Campbell and the squadron were ordered home on 18 August and set sail for Boston on 8 September, arriving there on 14 October. &quot;Constitution&quot; had been gone for more than four years.

==War of 1812==


&quot;Constitution&quot; was recommissioned in December with Captain John Rodgers again taking command to oversee a major refitting. It was overhauled at a cost just under $100,000; however, Rodgers inexplicably failed to clean her copper sheathing, leading him to later declare her a &quot;slow &quot;. It spent most of the following two years on training runs and ordinary duty. Isaac Hull took command in June 1810, and he immediately recognized that it needed her bottom cleaned. &quot;Ten loads&quot; of barnacles and seaweed were removed.

Hull departed for France on 5 August 1811, transporting the new Ambassador Joel Barlow and his family; they arrived on 1 September. Hull remained near France and the Netherlands through the winter months, continually holding sail and gun drills to keep the crew ready for possible hostilities with the British. Tensions were high between the United States and Britain after the events of the &quot;Little Belt&quot; affair the previous May, and &quot;Constitution&quot; was shadowed by British frigates while awaiting dispatches from Barlow to carry back to the United States. They arrived home on 18 February 1812.

War was declared on 18 June and Hull put to sea on 12 July, attempting to join the five ships of a squadron under the command of Rodgers in &quot;President&quot;. He sighted five ships off Egg Harbor, New Jersey, on 17 July and at first believed them to be Rodgers&#x27; squadron but, by the following morning, the lookouts determined that they were a British squadron out of Halifax: , , , , and . They had sighted &quot;Constitution&quot; and were giving chase.

Constitution was becalmed and unable to run from the five British ships, but Hull acted on a suggestion from his First Lieutenant Charles Morris. He ordered the crew to put boats over the side to tow the ship out of range, using kedge anchors to draw the ship forward and wetting the sails to take advantage of every breath of wind. The British ships soon imitated the tactic of kedging and remained in pursuit. The resulting 57-hour chase in the July heat forced the crew of &quot;Constitution&quot; to employ myriad tactics to outrun the squadron, finally pumping overboard of drinking water. Cannon fire was exchanged several times, though the British attempts fell short or overshot their mark, including an attempted broadside from &quot;Belvidera&quot;. On 19 July, &quot;Constitution&quot; pulled far enough ahead of the British that they abandoned the pursuit.

&quot;Constitution&quot; arrived in Boston on 27 July and remained there just long enough to replenish her supplies. Hull sailed without orders on 2 August to avoid being blockaded in port, heading on a northeast route towards the British shipping lanes near Halifax and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. &quot;Constitution&quot; captured three British merchantmen, which Hull burned rather than risk taking them back to an American port. On 16 August, he learned of a British frigate to the south and sailed in pursuit.

===&quot;Constitution&quot; vs. &quot;Guerriere&quot;===


A frigate was sighted on 19 August and subsequently determined to be (38) with the words &quot;Not The Little Belt&quot; painted on her foretopsail. &quot;Guerriere&quot; opened fire upon entering range of &quot;Constitution&quot;, doing little damage. After a few exchanges of cannon fire between the ships, Captain Hull maneuvered &quot;Constitution&quot; into an advantageous position within of &quot;Guerriere&quot;. He then ordered a full double-loaded broadside of grape and round shot, which took out &quot;Guerriere&quot;″s mizzenmast. &quot;Guerriere&quot;″s maneuverability decreased with her mizzenmast dragging in the water, and it collided with &quot;Constitution&quot;, entangling her bowsprit in &quot;Constitution&quot;″s mizzen rigging. This left only &quot;Guerriere&quot;″s bow guns capable of effective fire. Hull&#x27;s cabin caught fire from the shots, but it was quickly extinguished. With the ships locked together, both captains ordered boarding parties into action, but the sea was heavy and neither party was able to board the opposing ship.

At one point, the two ships rotated together counter-clockwise, with &quot;Constitution&quot; continuing to fire broadsides. When the two ships pulled apart, the force of the bowsprit&#x27;s extraction sent shock waves through &quot;Guerriere&quot;″s rigging. Her foremast collapsed, and that brought the mainmast down shortly afterward. &quot;Guerriere&quot; was now a dismasted, unmanageable hulk with close to a third of her crew wounded or killed, while &quot;Constitution&quot; remained largely intact. The British surrendered.

Hull had surprised the British with his heavier broadsides and his ship&#x27;s sailing ability. Adding to their astonishment, many of the British shots had rebounded harmlessly off &quot;Constitution&quot;″s hull. An American sailor reportedly exclaimed &quot;Huzzah! Her sides are made of iron!&quot; and &quot;Constitution&quot; acquired the nickname &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;.

The battle left &quot;Guerriere&quot; so badly damaged that it was not worth towing to port, and Hull ordered her to be burned the next morning, after transferring the British prisoners onto &quot;Constitution&quot;. &quot;Constitution&quot; arrived back in Boston on 30 August, where Hull and his crew found that news of their victory had spread fast, and they were hailed as heroes.

===&quot;Constitution&quot; vs &quot;Java&quot;===
William Bainbridge, senior to Hull, took command of &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; on 8 September and prepared her for another mission in British shipping lanes near Brazil, sailing with on 27 October. They arrived near São Salvador on 13 December, sighting in the harbor. &quot;Bonne Citoyenne&quot; was reportedly carrying $1.6 million in spice to England, and her captain refused to leave the neutral harbor lest he lose his cargo. &quot;Constitution&quot; sailed offshore in search of prizes, leaving &quot;Hornet&quot; to await the departure of &quot;Bonne Citoyenne&quot;. On 29 December, it met with under Captain Henry Lambert. At the initial hail from Bainbridge, &quot;Java&quot; answered with a broadside that severely damaged &quot;Constitution&quot;″s rigging. It was able to recover, however, and returned a series of broadsides to &quot;Java&quot;. A shot from &quot;Java&quot; destroyed &quot;Constitution&quot;″s helm (wheel), so Bainbridge directed the crew to steer her manually using the tiller for the remainder of the engagement. Bainbridge was wounded twice during the battle. &quot;Java&quot;″s bowsprit became entangled in &quot;Constitution&quot;″s rigging, as in the battle with &quot;Guerriere&quot;, allowing Bainbridge to continue raking her with broadsides. &quot;Java&quot;″s foremast collapsed, sending her fighting top crashing down through two decks below.

Bainbridge drew off to make emergency repairs and re-approached &quot;Java&quot; an hour later. It was a shambles, an unmanageable wreck with a badly wounded crew, and it surrendered. Bainbridge determined that &quot;Java&quot; was far too damaged to retain as a prize and ordered her burned, but not before having her helm salvaged and installed on &quot;Constitution&quot;. &quot;Constitution&quot; returned to São Salvador on 1 January 1813 to disembark the prisoners of &quot;Java&quot;, where it met with &quot;Hornet&quot; and her two British prizes. Bainbridge ordered &quot;Constitution&quot; to sail for Boston on 5 January, being far away from a friendly port and needing extensive repairs, leaving &quot;Hornet&quot; behind to continue waiting for &quot;Bonne Citoyenne&quot; in the hopes that it would leave the harbor (it did not). &quot;Java&quot; was the third British warship in three months to be captured by the United States, and &quot;Constitution&quot;″s victory prompted the British Admiralty to order its frigates not to engage the heavier American frigates one-on-one; only British ships of the line or squadrons were permitted to come close enough to attack. &quot;Constitution&quot; arrived in Boston on 15 February to even greater celebrations than Hull had received a few months earlier.

===Marblehead and blockade===
Bainbridge determined that &quot;Constitution&quot; required new spar deck planking and beams, masts, sails, and rigging, as well as replacement of her copper bottom. However, personnel and supplies were being diverted to the Great Lakes, causing shortages that kept her in Boston intermittently with her sister ships &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, &quot;Congress&quot;, and &quot;President&quot; for the majority of the year. Charles Stewart took command on 18 July and struggled to complete the construction and recruitment of a new crew, finally making sail on 31 December. The ship set course for the West Indies to harass British shipping and had captured five merchant ships and the 14-gun by late March 1814. It also pursued and HMS &quot;Pique&quot;, though both ships escaped after realizing that it was an American frigate.

Her mainmast split off the coast of Bermuda on 27 March, requiring immediate repair. Stewart set a course for Boston, where British ships and commenced pursuit on 3 April. Stewart ordered drinking water and food to be cast overboard to lighten her load and gain speed, trusting that her mainmast would hold together long enough for her to make her way into Marblehead, Massachusetts. The last item thrown overboard was the supply of spirits. Upon &quot;Constitution&quot;″s arrival in the harbor, the citizens of Marblehead rallied in support, assembling what cannons they possessed at Fort Sewall, and the British called off the pursuit. Two weeks later, &quot;Constitution&quot; made her way into Boston, where it remained blockaded in port until mid-December.

===HMS &quot;Cyane&quot; and HMS &quot;Levant&quot;===
Captain George Collier of the Royal Navy received command of the 50-gun and was sent to North America to deal with the American frigates that were causing such losses to British shipping. Meanwhile, Charles Stewart saw his chance to escape from Boston Harbor and made it good on the afternoon of 18 December, and &quot;Constitution&quot; again set course for Bermuda. Collier gathered a squadron consisting of &quot;Leander&quot;, , and and set off in pursuit, but he was unable to overtake her. On 24 December, &quot;Constitution&quot; intercepted the merchantman &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; and placed a prize crew aboard. &quot;Constitution&quot; had left Boston not fully supplied, but &quot;Lord Nelson&quot;″s stores supplied a Christmas dinner for the crew.

&quot;Constitution&quot; was cruising off Cape Finisterre on 8 February 1815 when Stewart learned that the Treaty of Ghent had been signed. He realized, however, that a state of war still existed until the treaty was ratified, and &quot;Constitution&quot; captured the British merchantman &quot;Susanna&quot; on 16 February; her cargo of animal hides was valued at $75,000.

On 20 February, &quot;Constitution&quot; sighted the small British ships &quot;Cyane&quot; and sailing in company and gave chase. &quot;Cyane&quot; and &quot;Levant&quot; began a series of broadsides against her, but Stewart outmaneuvered both of them and forced &quot;Levant&quot; to draw off for repairs. He concentrated fire on &quot;Cyane&quot;, which soon struck her colors. &quot;Levant&quot; returned to engage &quot;Constitution&quot; but it turned and attempted to escape when it saw that &quot;Cyane&quot; had been defeated. &quot;Constitution&quot; overtook her and, after several more broadsides, it struck her colors. Stewart remained with his new prizes overnight while ordering repairs to all ships. &quot;Constitution&quot; had suffered little damage in the battle, though it was later discovered that it had twelve 32-pound British cannonballs embedded in her hull, none of which had penetrated. The trio then set a course for the Cape Verde Islands and arrived at Porto Praya on 10 March.

The next morning, Collier&#x27;s squadron was spotted on a course for the harbor, and Stewart ordered all ships to sail immediately; he had been unaware until then of Collier&#x27;s pursuit. &quot;Cyane&quot; was able to elude the squadron and make sail for America, where it arrived on 10 April, but &quot;Levant&quot; was overtaken and recaptured. Collier&#x27;s squadron was distracted with &quot;Levant&quot; while &quot;Constitution&quot; made another escape from overwhelming forces.

&quot;Constitution&quot; set a course towards Guinea and then west towards Brazil, as Stewart had learned from the capture of &quot;Susanna&quot; that was transporting gold bullion back to England, and he wanted her as a prize. &quot;Constitution&quot; put into Maranhão on 2 April to offload her British prisoners and replenish her drinking water. While there, Stewart learned by rumor that the Treaty of Ghent had been ratified, and set course for America, receiving verification of peace at San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 28 April. He then set course for New York and arrived home on 15 May to large celebrations. &quot;Constitution&quot; emerged from the war undefeated, though her sister ships &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and &quot;President&quot; were not so fortunate, having been captured in 1813 and 1815 respectively. &quot;Constitution&quot; was moved to Boston and placed in ordinary in January 1816, sitting out the Second Barbary War.

===Mediterranean Squadron===
Charlestown Navy Yard&#x27;s commandant Isaac Hull directed a refitting of &quot;Constitution&quot; to prepare her for duty with the Mediterranean Squadron in April 1820. They removed Joshua Humphreys&#x27; diagonal riders to make room for two iron freshwater tanks, and they replaced the copper sheathing and timbers below the waterline. At the direction of Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson, it was also subjected to an unusual experiment in which manually operated paddle wheels were fitted to her hull. The paddle wheels were designed to propel her at up to if it was ever becalmed, by the crew using the ship&#x27;s capstan. Initial testing was successful, but Hull and &quot;Constitution&quot;″s commanding officer Jacob Jones were reportedly unimpressed with paddle wheels on a US Navy ship. Jones had them removed and stowed in the cargo hold before he departed on 13 May 1821 for a three-year tour of duty in the Mediterranean. On 12 April 1823, it collided with the British merchant ship &quot;Bicton&quot; in the Mediterranean Sea, and &quot;Bicton&quot; sank with the loss of her captain.

&quot;Constitution&quot; otherwise experienced an uneventful tour, sailing in company with and , until crew behavior during shore leave gave Jones a reputation as a commodore who was lax in discipline. The Navy grew weary of receiving complaints about the crews&#x27; antics while in port and ordered Jones to return. &quot;Constitution&quot; arrived in Boston on 31 May 1824, and Jones was relieved of command. Thomas Macdonough took command and sailed on 29 October for the Mediterranean under the direction of John Rodgers in . With discipline restored, &quot;Constitution&quot; resumed uneventful duty. Macdonough resigned his command for health reasons on 9 October 1825. &quot;Constitution&quot; put in for repairs during December and into January 1826, until Daniel Todd Patterson assumed command on 21 February. By August, it had been put into Port Mahon, suffering decay of her spar deck, and it remained there until temporary repairs were completed in March 1827. &quot;Constitution&quot; returned to Boston on 4 July 1828 and was placed in reserve.

==Old Ironsides==
&quot;Constitution&quot; was built in an era when a ship&#x27;s expected service life was 10 to 15 years. Secretary of the Navy John Branch made a routine order for surveys of ships in the reserve fleet, and commandant of the Charlestown Navy Yard Charles Morris estimated a repair cost of over $157,000 for &quot;Constitution&quot;. On 14 September 1830, an article appeared in the Boston &quot;Advertiser&quot; which erroneously claimed that the Navy intended to scrap &quot;Constitution&quot;. Two days later, Oliver Wendell Holmes&#x27; poem &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; was published in the same paper and later all over the country, igniting public indignation and inciting efforts to save &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; from the scrap yard. Secretary Branch approved the costs, and &quot;Constitution&quot; began a leisurely repair period while awaiting completion of the dry dock then under construction at the yard. In contrast to the efforts to save &quot;Constitution&quot;, another round of surveys in 1834 found her sister ship &quot;Congress&quot; unfit for repair; it was unceremoniously broken up in 1835.

On 24 June 1833, &quot;Constitution&quot; entered dry dock. Captain Jesse Elliott, the new commander of the Navy yard, oversaw her reconstruction. &quot;Constitution&quot; had of hog in her keel and remained in dry dock until 21 June 1834. This was the first of many times that souvenirs were made from her old planking; Isaac Hull ordered walking canes, picture frames, and even a phaeton, which was presented to President Andrew Jackson.

Meanwhile, Elliott directed the installation of a new figurehead of President Jackson under the bowsprit, which became a subject of much controversy due to Jackson&#x27;s political unpopularity in Boston at the time. Elliot was a Jacksonian Democrat, and he received death threats. Rumors circulated about the citizens of Boston storming the navy yard to remove the figurehead themselves.

A merchant captain named Samuel Dewey accepted a small wager as to whether he could complete the task of removal. Elliot had posted guards on &quot;Constitution&quot; to ensure the safety of the figurehead, but Dewey crossed the Charles River in a small boat, using the noise of thunderstorms to mask his movements, and managed to saw off most of Jackson&#x27;s head. The severed head made the rounds between taverns and meeting houses in Boston until Dewey personally returned it to Secretary of the Navy Mahlon Dickerson; it remained on Dickerson&#x27;s library shelf for many years. The addition of busts to her stern escaped controversy of any kind, depicting Isaac Hull, William Bainbridge, and Charles Stewart; the busts remained in place for the next 40 years.

===Mediterranean and Pacific Squadrons===
Elliot was appointed captain of &quot;Constitution&quot; and got underway in March 1835 to New York, where he ordered repairs to the Jackson figurehead, avoiding a second round of controversy. Departing on 16 March &quot;Constitution&quot; set a course for France to deliver Edward Livingston to his post as Minister. The ship arrived on 10 April and began the return voyage on 16 May. It arrived back in Boston on 23 June, then sailed on 19 August to take her station as flagship in the Mediterranean, arriving at Port Mahon on 19 September. Her duty over the next two years was uneventful as it and &quot;United States&quot; made routine patrols and diplomatic visits. From April 1837 into February 1838, Elliot collected various ancient artifacts to carry back to America, adding various livestock during the return voyage. &quot;Constitution&quot; arrived in Norfolk on 31 July. Elliot was later suspended from duty for transporting livestock on a Navy ship.

As the flagship of the Pacific Squadron under the command of Captain Daniel Turner, she began her next voyage on 1 March 1839 with the duty of patrolling the western coast of South America. Often spending months in one port or another, she visited Valparaíso, Callao, Paita, and Puna while her crew amused themselves with the beaches and taverns in each locality. The return voyage found her at Rio de Janeiro, where Emperor Pedro II of Brazil visited her about 29 August 1841. Departing Rio, she returned to Norfolk on 31 October. On 22 June 1842, she was recommissioned under the command of Foxhall Alexander Parker for duty with the Home Squadron. After spending months in port she put to sea for three weeks during December, then was again put in ordinary.

===Around the world===
In late 1843, she was moored at Norfolk, serving as a receiving ship. Naval Constructor Foster Rhodes calculated that it would require $70,000 to make her seaworthy. Acting Secretary David Henshaw faced a dilemma. His budget could not support such a cost, yet he could not allow the country&#x27;s favorite ship to deteriorate. He turned to Captain John Percival, known in the service as &quot;Mad Jack&quot;. The captain traveled to Virginia and conducted his own survey of the ship&#x27;s needs. He reported that the necessary repairs and upgrades could be done at a cost of $10,000. On 6 November, Henshaw told Percival to proceed without delay, but stay within his projected figure. After several months of labor, Percival reported &quot;Constitution&quot; ready for &quot;a two or even a three-year cruise.&quot;

She got underway on 29 May 1844 carrying Ambassador to Brazil Henry A. Wise and his family, arriving at Rio de Janeiro on 2 August after making two port visits along the way. She sailed again on 8 September, making port calls at Madagascar, Mozambique, and Zanzibar, and arriving at Sumatra on 1 January 1845. Many of her crew began to suffer from dysentery and fevers, causing several deaths, which led Percival to set course for Singapore, arriving there 8 February. While in Singapore, Commodore Henry Ducie Chads of HMS &quot;Cambrian&quot; paid a visit to &quot;Constitution&quot;, offering what medical assistance his squadron could provide. Chads had been the Lieutenant of &quot;Java&quot; when she surrendered to William Bainbridge 33 years earlier. The relationship between the United States and Brunei began on 6 April, when she was anchored in Brunei Bay in which a Treaty of Peace, Friendship, Commerce and Navigation was formed.

Leaving Singapore, &quot;Constitution&quot; arrived at Turon, Cochinchina (present-day Da Nang, Vietnam), on 10 May. Not long after, Percival was informed that French missionary Dominique Lefèbvre was being held captive under sentence of death. He went ashore with a squad of Marines to speak with the local Mandarin. Percival demanded the return of Lefèbvre and took three local leaders hostage to ensure that his demands were met. When no communication was forthcoming, he ordered the capture of three junks, which were brought to &quot;Constitution&quot;. He released the hostages after two days, attempting to show good faith towards the Mandarin, who had demanded their return. During a storm, the three junks escaped upriver; a detachment of Marines pursued and recaptured them. The supply of food and water from shore was stopped, and Percival gave in to another demand for the release of the junks in order to keep his ship supplied, expecting Lefèbvre to be released. He soon realized that no return would be made, however, and Percival ordered &quot;Constitution&quot; to depart on 26 May.

She arrived at Canton, China, on 20 June and spent the next six weeks there, while Percival made shore and diplomatic visits. Again the crew suffered from dysentery due to poor drinking water, resulting in three more deaths by the time that she reached Manila on 18 September, spending a week there preparing to enter the Pacific Ocean. She then sailed on 28 September for the Hawaiian Islands, arriving at Honolulu on 16 November. She found Commodore John D. Sloat and his flagship there; Sloat informed Percival that &quot;Constitution&quot; was needed in Mexico, as the United States was preparing for war after the Texas annexation. She provisioned for six months and sailed for Mazatlán, arriving there on 13 January 1846. She sat at anchor for more than three months until she was finally allowed to sail for home on 22 April, rounding Cape Horn on 4 July. Arriving in Rio de Janeiro, the ship&#x27;s party learned that the Mexican War had begun on 13 May, soon after their departure from Mazatlán. She arrived home in Boston on 27 September and was mothballed on 5 October.

===Mediterranean and African Squadrons===

&quot;Constitution&quot; began a refitting in 1847 for duty with the Mediterranean Squadron. The figurehead of Andrew Jackson that caused so much controversy 15 years earlier was replaced with another likeness of Jackson, this time without a top hat and with a more Napoleonic pose. Captain John Gwinn commanded her on this voyage, departing on 9 December 1848 and arriving at Tripoli on 19 January 1849. She received King Ferdinand II and Pope Pius IX on board at Gaeta on 1 August, giving them a 21-gun salute. This was the first time that a Pope set foot on American territory or its equivalent.

At Palermo on 1 September, Captain Gwinn died of chronic gastritis and was buried near Lazaretto on the 9th. Captain Thomas Conover assumed command on the 18th and resumed routine patrolling for the rest of the tour, heading home on 1 December 1850. She was involved in a severe collision with the English brig &quot;Confidence&quot;, cutting her in half, which sank with the loss of her captain. The surviving crew members were carried back to America, where &quot;Constitution&quot; was put in ordinary once again, this time at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, in January 1851.

&quot;Constitution&quot; was recommissioned on 22 December 1852 under the command of John Rudd. She carried Commodore Isaac Mayo for duty with the African Squadron, departing the yard on 2 March 1853 on a leisurely sail towards Africa and arriving there on 18 June. Mayo made a diplomatic visit in Liberia, arranging a treaty between the Gbarbo and the Grebo tribes. Mayo resorted to firing cannons into the village of the Gbarbo in order to get them to agree to the treaty. About 22 June 1854, he arranged another peace treaty, between the leaders of Grahway and Half Cavally. On 31 July 1854, he arranged a compact with the King of Lagos.

&quot;Constitution&quot; took the American ship &quot;H.N. Gambrill&quot; as a prize near Angola on 3 November. &quot;H.N. Gambrill&quot; was involved in the slave trade and proved to be &quot;Constitution&quot; final capture. The rest of her tour passed uneventfully and she sailed for home on 31 March 1855. She was diverted to Havana, Cuba, arriving there on 16 May and departing on the 24th. She arrived at Portsmouth Navy Yard and was decommissioned on 14 June, ending her last duty on the front lines.

===Civil War===
Since the formation of the US Naval Academy in 1845, there had been a growing need for quarters in which to house the students (midshipmen). In 1857, &quot;Constitution&quot; was moved to dry dock at the Portsmouth Navy Yard for conversion into a training ship. Some of the earliest known photographs of her were taken during this refitting, which added classrooms on her spar and gun decks and reduced her armament to only 16 guns. Her rating was changed to a &quot;2nd rate ship&quot;. She was recommissioned on 1 August 1860 and moved from Portsmouth to the Naval Academy.
At the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, &quot;Constitution&quot; was ordered to relocate farther north after threats had been made against her by Confederate sympathizers. Several companies of Massachusetts volunteer soldiers were stationed aboard for her protection. towed her to New York City, where she arrived on 29 April. She was subsequently relocated, along with the Naval Academy, to Fort Adams in Newport, Rhode Island, for the duration of the war. Her sister ship &quot;United States&quot; was abandoned by the Union and then captured by Confederate forces at the Gosport Shipyard, leaving &quot;Constitution&quot; the only remaining frigate of the original six.

The Navy launched an ironclad on 10 May 1862 as part of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and they bestowed on her the name to honor &quot;Constitution&quot;″s tradition of service. However, &quot;New Ironsides&quot;″ naval career was short, as she was destroyed by fire on 16 December 1865. In August 1865, &quot;Constitution&quot; moved back to Annapolis, along with the rest of the Naval Academy. During the voyage, she was allowed to drop her tow lines from the tug and continue alone under wind power. Despite her age, she was recorded running at and arrived at Hampton Roads ten hours ahead of the tug. Andersonville Prisoners- &quot;Thorp and his fellow soldiers were transported to Jacksonville, Fla., then on USS Constitution to &quot;Camp Parole&quot; in Annapolis, Md. There, they were issued rations, clothing and back pay before being sent to their respective regimental headquarters for discharge.&quot;

As &quot;Constitution&quot; settled in again at the Academy, a series of upgrades was installed that included steam pipes and radiators to supply heat from shore, along with gas lighting. From June to August each year, she would depart with midshipmen for their summer training cruise and then return to operate for the rest of the year as a classroom. In June 1867, her last known plank owner William Bryant died in Maine. George Dewey assumed command in November; he served as her commanding officer until 1870. In 1871, her condition had deteriorated to the point where she was retired as a training ship, and then towed to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she was placed in ordinary on 26 September.

===Paris Exposition===
&quot;Constitution&quot; was overhauled beginning in 1873 in order to participate in the centennial celebrations of the United States. Work began slowly and was intermittently delayed by the transition of the Philadelphia Navy Yard to League Island. By late 1875, the Navy opened bids for an outside contractor to complete the work, and &quot;Constitution&quot; was moved to Wood, Dialogue, and Company in May 1876, where a coal bin and a small boiler for heat were installed. The Andrew Jackson figurehead was removed at this time and given to the Naval Academy Museum, where it remains today. Her construction dragged on during the rest of 1876 until the centennial celebrations had long passed, and the Navy decided that she would be used as a training and school ship for apprentices.

Oscar C. Badger took command on 9 January 1878 to prepare her for a voyage to the Paris Exposition of 1878, transporting artwork and industrial displays to France. Three railroad cars were lashed to her spar deck and all but two cannons were removed when she departed on 4 March. While docking at Le Havre, she collided with &quot;Ville de Paris&quot;, which resulted in &quot;Constitution&quot; entering dry dock for repairs and remaining in France for the rest of 1878. She got underway for the United States on 16 January 1879, but poor navigation ran her aground the next day near Bollard Head, Dorset, United Kingdom. She was refloated with the assistance of the tugs &quot;Commodore&quot;, &quot;Lightning&quot;, &quot;Lothair&quot;, &quot;Royal Albert&quot;, &quot;Malta&quot; and &quot;Telegraph&quot;. She was towed into the Portsmouth Naval Dockyard, Hampshire, England, where only minor damage was found and repaired.

Her problem-plagued voyage continued on 13 February when her rudder was damaged during heavy storms, resulting in a total loss of steering control, with the rudder smashing into the hull at random. Three crewmen went over the stern on ropes and boatswain&#x27;s chairs and secured it. The next morning, they rigged a temporary steering system. Badger set a course for the nearest port, and she arrived in Lisbon on 18 February. Slow dock services delayed her departure until 11 April and her voyage home did not end until 24 May. Carpenter&#x27;s Mate Henry Williams, Captain of the Top Joseph Matthews, and Captain of the Top James Horton received the Medal of Honor for their actions in repairing the damaged rudder at sea. &quot;Constitution&quot; returned to her previous duties of training apprentice boys, and Ship&#x27;s Corporal James Thayer received a Medal of Honor for saving a fellow crew member from drowning on 16 November.

Over the next two years, she continued her training cruises, but it soon became apparent that her overhaul in 1876 had been of poor quality, and in 1881 she was determined to be unfit for service. Funds were lacking for another overhaul, so she was decommissioned, ending her days as an active-duty naval ship. She was moved to the Portsmouth Navy Yard and used as a receiving ship. There, she had a housing structure built over her spar deck, and her condition continued to deteriorate, with only a minimal amount of maintenance performed to keep her afloat. In 1896, Massachusetts Congressman John F. Fitzgerald became aware of her condition and proposed to Congress that funds be appropriated to restore her enough to return to Boston. She arrived at the Charlestown Navy Yard under tow on 21 September 1897 and, after her centennial celebrations in October, she lay there with an uncertain future.

==Museum ship==
In 1900, Congress authorized the restoration of &quot;Constitution&quot; but did not appropriate any funds for the project; funding was to be raised privately. The Massachusetts Society of the United Daughters of the War of 1812 spearheaded an effort to raise funds, but they ultimately failed. In 1903, the Massachusetts Historical Society&#x27;s president Charles Francis Adams requested of Congress that &quot;Constitution&quot; be rehabilitated and placed back into active service.

In 1905, Secretary of the Navy Charles Joseph Bonaparte suggested that &quot;Constitution&quot; be towed out to sea and used as target practice, after which she would be allowed to sink. Moses H. Gulesian read about this in a Boston newspaper; he was a businessman from Worcester, Massachusetts, and he offered to purchase her for $10,000. The State Department refused, but Gulesian initiated a public campaign which began from Boston and ultimately &quot;spilled all over the country.&quot; The storms of protest from the public prompted Congress to authorize $100,000 (~$ in ) in 1906 for the ship&#x27;s restoration. First to be removed was the barracks structure on her spar deck, but the limited amount of funds allowed just a partial restoration. By 1907, &quot;Constitution&quot; began to serve as a museum ship, with tours offered to the public. On 1 December 1917, she was renamed &quot;Old Constitution&quot; to free her name for a planned new . The name &quot;Constitution&quot; was originally destined for the lead ship of the class, but was shuffled between hulls until CC-5 was given the name; construction of CC-5 was canceled in 1923 due to the Washington Naval Treaty. The incomplete hull was sold for scrap and &quot;Old Constitution&quot; was granted the return of her name on 24 July 1925.

===1925 restoration and tour===
Admiral Edward Walter Eberle, Chief of Naval Operations, ordered the Board of Inspection and Survey to compile a report on her condition, and the inspection of 19 February 1924 found her in grave condition. Water had to be pumped out of her hold every day just to keep her afloat, and her stern was in danger of falling off. Almost all deck areas and structural components were filled with rot, and she was considered to be on the verge of ruin. Yet the Board recommended that she be thoroughly repaired in order to preserve her as long as possible. The estimated cost of repairs was $400,000. Secretary of the Navy Curtis D. Wilbur proposed to Congress that the required funds be raised privately, and he was authorized to assemble the committee charged with her restoration.

The first effort was sponsored by the national Elks Lodge. Programs presented to schoolchildren about &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; encouraged them to donate pennies towards her restoration, eventually raising $148,000. In the meantime, the estimates for repair began to climb, eventually reaching over $745,000 (~$ in ) after costs of materials were realized. In September 1926, Wilbur began to sell copies of a painting of &quot;Constitution&quot; at 50 cents per copy. The silent film &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; portrayed &quot;Constitution&quot; during the First Barbary War. It premiered in December and helped spur more contributions to her restoration fund. The final campaign allowed memorabilia to be made of her discarded planking and metal. The committee eventually raised more than $600,000 after expenses, still short of the required amount, and Congress approved up to $300,000 to complete the restoration. The final cost of the restoration was $946,000 ().

Lieutenant John A. Lord was selected to oversee the reconstruction project, and work began while fund-raising efforts were still underway. Materials were difficult to find, especially the live oak needed; Lord uncovered a long-forgotten stash of live oak (some ) at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, that had been cut sometime in the 1850s for a ship-building program that never began. &quot;Constitution&quot; entered dry dock with a crowd of 10,000 observers on 16 June 1927. Meanwhile, Charles Francis Adams had been appointed as Secretary of the Navy, and he proposed that &quot;Constitution&quot; make a tour of the United States upon her completion, as a gift to the nation for its efforts to help restore her. She emerged from dry dock on 15 March 1930; approximately 85 percent of the ship had been &quot;renewed&quot; (i.e. replaced) to make her seaworthy. Many amenities were installed to prepare her for the three-year tour of the country, including water piping throughout, modern toilet and shower facilities, electric lighting to make the interior visible for visitors, and several peloruses for ease of navigation. of rigging was made for &quot;Constitution&quot; at Charlestown Navy Yard ropewalk.

&quot;Constitution&quot; recommissioned on 1 July 1931 under the command of Louis J. Gulliver with a crew of 60 officers and sailors, 15 Marines, and a pet monkey named Rosie as their mascot. The tour began at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, with much celebration and a 21-gun salute, scheduled to visit 90 port cities along the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts. Due to the heavy itinerary, she was towed by the minesweeper . She went as far north as Bar Harbor, Maine, south and into the Gulf of Mexico, then through the Panama Canal Zone, and north again to Bellingham, Washington, on the Pacific Coast. &quot;Constitution&quot; returned to her home port of Boston in May 1934 after more than 4.6 million people visited her during the three-year tour.

===1934 return to Boston===

&quot;Constitution&quot; returned to serving as a museum ship, receiving 100,000 visitors per year in Boston. She was maintained by a small crew who were berthed on the ship, requiring more reliable heating. The heating was upgraded to a forced-air system in the 1950s, and a sprinkler system was added that protects her from fire. &quot;Constitution&quot; broke loose from her dock on 21 September 1938 during the New England Hurricane and was blown into Boston Harbor, where she collided with the destroyer ; she suffered only minor damage.

With limited funds available, she experienced more deterioration over the years, and items began to disappear from the ship as souvenir hunters picked away at the more portable objects. &quot;Constitution&quot; and were recommissioned in 1940 at the request of President Franklin Roosevelt.
In early 1941, &quot;Constitution&quot; was assigned the hull classification symbol IX-21 and began to serve as a brig for officers awaiting court-martial.

The United States Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating &quot;Constitution&quot; in 1947, and an Act of Congress in 1954 made the Secretary of the Navy responsible for her upkeep.

===Restoration===
In 1970, another survey was performed on her condition, finding that repairs were required but not as extensively as needed in the 1920s. The US Navy determined that a commander was required as commanding officer—typically someone with about 20 years of seniority; this would ensure the experience to organize the maintenance that she required. Funds were approved in 1972 for her restoration, and she entered dry dock in April 1973, remaining until April 1974. During this period, large quantities of red oak were removed and replaced. The red oak had been added in the 1950s as an experiment to see if it would be more durable than the live oak, but it had mostly rotted away by 1970.

===Bicentennial celebrations===
Commander Tyrone G. Martin became her captain in August 1974, as preparations began for the upcoming United States Bicentennial celebrations. He set the precedent that all construction work on &quot;Constitution&quot; was to be aimed towards maintaining her to the 1812 configuration for which she is most noted. In September 1975, her hull classification of IX-21 was officially canceled.

The privately run USS Constitution Museum opened on 8 April 1976, and Commander Martin dedicated a tract of land as &quot;Constitution Grove&quot; one month later, located at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Indiana. The now supply the majority of the white oak required for repair work. On 10 July, &quot;Constitution&quot; led the parade of tall ships up Boston Harbor for Operation Sail, firing her guns at one-minute intervals for the first time in approximately 100 years. On 11 July, she rendered a 21-gun salute to Her Majesty&#x27;s Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot;, as Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip arrived for a state visit. The royal couple were piped aboard and privately toured the ship for approximately 30 minutes with Commander Martin and Secretary of the Navy J. William Middendorf. Upon their departure, the crew of &quot;Constitution&quot; rendered three cheers for the Queen. Over 900,000 visitors toured &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; that year.

===1995 reconstruction===
&quot;Constitution&quot; entered dry dock in 1992 for an inspection and minor repair period that turned out to be her most comprehensive structural restoration and repair since she was launched in 1797. Multiple refittings over the 200 years of her career had removed most of her original construction components and design, as her mission changed from a fighting warship to a training ship and eventually to a receiving ship. In 1993, the Naval History &amp; Heritage Command Detachment Boston reviewed Humphreys&#x27; original plans and identified five main structural components that were required to prevent hogging of the hull, as &quot;Constitution&quot; had of hog at that point. Using a 1:16 scale model of the ship, they were able to determine that restoring the original components would result in a 10% increase in hull stiffness.

Three hundred scans were completed on her timbers using radiography to find any hidden problems otherwise undetectable from the outside—technology that was unavailable during previous reconstructions. The repair crew used sound-wave testing, aided by the United States Forest Service&#x27;s Forest Products Laboratory, to determine the condition of the remaining timbers that might have been rotting from the inside. The of hog was removed from her keel by allowing the ship to settle naturally while in dry dock. The most difficult task was the procurement of timber in the quantity and sizes needed, as was the case during her 1920s restoration as well. The city of Charleston, South Carolina, donated live-oak trees that had been felled by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and the International Paper Company donated live oak from its own property. The project continued to reconstruct her to 1812 specifications, even as she remained open to visitors who were allowed to observe the process and converse with workers. The $12 million project was completed in 1995.

===Sailing on 200th anniversary===

As early as 1991, Commander David Cashman had suggested that &quot;Constitution&quot; should sail to celebrate her 200th anniversary in 1997 rather than being towed. The proposal was approved, though it was thought to be a large undertaking since she had not sailed in over 100 years. When she emerged from dry dock in 1995, a more serious effort began to prepare her for sail. As in the 1920s, education programs aimed at school children helped collect pennies to purchase the sails to make the voyage possible. Her six-sail battle configuration consisted of jibs, topsails, and driver.

Commander Mike Beck began training the crew for the historic sail using an 1819 Navy sailing manual and several months of practice, including time spent aboard the Coast Guard cutter &quot;Eagle&quot;. On 20 July, &quot;Constitution&quot; was towed from her usual berth in Boston to an overnight mooring in Marblehead, Massachusetts. En route, she made her first sail in 116 years, at a recorded .

On 21 July, she was towed offshore, where the tow line was dropped and Commander Beck ordered six sails set (jibs, topsails, and spanker). She then sailed for 40 minutes on a south-south-east course with true wind speeds of about , attaining a top recorded speed of . Her modern US naval combatant escorts were the guided-missile destroyer and frigate . They rendered passing honors to &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; while she was under sail, and she was overflown by the US Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels. Inbound to her permanent berth at Charlestown, she rendered a 21-gun salute to the nation off Fort Independence in Boston Harbor.

==Present day==

The mission of &quot;Constitution&quot; is to promote understanding of the Navy&#x27;s role in war and peace through active participation in public events and education through outreach programs, public access, and historic demonstration. Her crew of approximately 75 US Navy sailors participate in ceremonies, educational programs, and special events while keeping the ship open to visitors year-round and providing free tours. The crewmen are all active-duty members of the US Navy, and the assignment is considered to be special duty. She entered dry dock in May 2015 for a scheduled restoration, before returning to sea.

&quot;Constitution&quot; is berthed at Pier One of the former Charlestown Navy Yard, at the terminus of Boston&#x27;s Freedom Trail. She is open to the public year-round. The privately run USS &quot;Constitution&quot; Museum is nearby, located in a restored shipyard building at the foot of Pier Two. &quot;Constitution&quot; typically makes at least one &quot;turnaround cruise&quot; each year, during which she is towed into Boston Harbor to perform underway demonstrations, including a gun drill; she then returns to her dock in the opposite direction to ensure that she weathers evenly. The &quot;turnaround cruise&quot; is open to the general public based on a &quot;lottery draw&quot; of interested persons each year.

The Naval History and Heritage Command Detachment Boston is responsible for planning and performing her maintenance, repair, and restoration, keeping her as close as possible to her 1812 configuration. The detachment estimates that approximately 10–15 percent of the timber in &quot;Constitution&quot; contains original material installed during her initial construction period in the years 1795–1797. The Navy maintains &quot;Constitution&quot; Grove at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division near Bloomington, Indiana to ensure a supply of mature white oak.

In 2003, the special effects crew from the production of &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; spent several days using &quot;Constitution&quot; as a computer model for the fictional French frigate &quot;Acheron&quot;, using stem-to-stern digital image scans. Lieutenant Commander John Scivier of the Royal Navy, commanding officer of , paid a visit to &quot;Constitution&quot; in November 2007, touring the local facilities with Commander William A. Bullard III. They discussed arranging an exchange program between the two ships.
&quot;Constitution&quot; emerged from a three-year repair period in November 2010. During this time, the entire spar deck was stripped down to the support beams, and the decking overhead was replaced to restore its original curvature, allowing water to drain overboard and not remain standing on the deck. In addition to decking repairs, 50 hull planks and the main hatch were repaired or replaced. The restoration continued the focus toward keeping her appearance of 1812 by replacing her upper sides so that she now resembles what she looked like after her triumph over &quot;Guerriere&quot;, when she gained her nickname &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;. The crew of &quot;Constitution&quot; under Commander Matt Bonner sailed &quot;Constitution&quot; under her own power on 19 August 2012, the anniversary of her victory over &quot;Guerriere&quot;. Bonner was &quot;Constitution&quot;″s 72nd commanding officer.

On 18 May 2015, the ship entered Dry Dock 1 in Charlestown Navy Yard to begin a two-year restoration program. The restoration planned to restore the copper sheets on the ship&#x27;s hull and replace deck boards. The Department of the Navy provided the $12–15 million expected cost. After the restoration was complete, she was returned to the water on 23 July 2017. In November 2017, Commander Nathaniel R. Shick relieved Commander Robert S. Gerosa Jr., who had spent most of his command while the ship was dry docked, in a ceremony held on board &quot;Constitution&quot;, to become the ship&#x27;s 75th commanding officer.

On 29 February 2020, Shick was succeeded as commanding officer by Commander John Benda.

On 17 January 2022, Billie J. Farrell became the first woman to command &quot;Constitution&quot;.

<doc id="32301" wikidata="Q574701" url="?curid=32301" title="Anti-Masonic Party">
<text>The Anti-Masonic Party was the earliest third party in the United States. Formally a single-issue party, it strongly opposed Freemasonry in the United States. It was active from the late 1820s, especially in the Northeast, and later attempted to become a major party by expanding its platform to take positions on other issues. It declined quickly after 1832 as most members joined the new Whig Party; it disappeared after 1838.

The party was founded following the disappearance of William Morgan, a former Mason who had become a prominent critic of the Masonic organization. Many believed that Masons had murdered Morgan for speaking out against Masonry and subsequently many churches and other groups condemned Masonry. As many Masons were prominent businessmen and politicians, the backlash against the Masons was also a form of anti-elitism. The Anti-Masons purported that Masons posed a threat to American republicanism by secretly trying to control the government. Furthermore, there was a strong fear that Masonry was hostile to Christianity.

Mass opposition to Masonry eventually coalesced into a political party. Before and during the presidency of John Quincy Adams, there was a period of political realignment. The Anti-Masons emerged as an important third-party alternative to Andrew Jackson&#x27;s Democrats and Adams&#x27; National Republicans. In New York, the Anti-Masons supplanted the National Republicans as the primary opposition to the Democrats.

After experiencing unexpected success in the 1828 elections, the Anti-Masons adopted positions on other issues, most notably support for internal improvements and a protective tariff. Several Anti-Masons, including William A. Palmer and Joseph Ritner, won election to prominent positions. In states such as Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, the party controlled the balance of power in the state legislature and provided crucial support to candidates for the United States Senate. In 1831, the party held the first presidential nominating convention, a practice that was subsequently adopted by all major parties. Delegates chose former U.S. attorney general William Wirt as their standard bearer in the 1832 presidential election; Wirt won 7.8% of the popular vote and carried Vermont.

As the 1830s progressed, many of the Anti-Masonic Party&#x27;s supporters joined the Whig Party, which sought to unite those opposed to the policies of President Jackson. The Anti-Masons brought with them an intense distrust of politicians and a rejection of unthinking party loyalty, together with new campaign techniques to whip up excitement among the voters. The Anti-Masonic Party held a national convention in 1835, nominating Whig candidate William Henry Harrison, but a second convention announced that the party would not officially support a candidate. Harrison campaigned as a Whig in the 1836 presidential election and his relative success in the election encouraged further migration of Anti-Masons to the Whig Party. By 1840, the party had ceased to function as a national organization. In subsequent decades, former Anti-Masonic candidates and supporters such as Millard Fillmore, William H. Seward, Thurlow Weed and Thaddeus Stevens became prominent members of the Whig Party.

== History ==
=== Background ===

The opponents of Freemasonry formed a political movement after the Morgan affair convinced them the Masons were murdering men who spoke out against them. This key episode was the mysterious 1826 disappearance of William Morgan, a Freemason in upstate New York who had turned against the Masons.

Morgan claimed to have been made a member of the Masons while living in Canada and he appears to have briefly attended a lodge in Rochester. In 1825, Morgan received the Royal Arch degree at Le Roy&#x27;s Western Star Chapter #33, having declared under oath that he had previously received the six degrees which preceded it. Whether he actually received these degrees and if so from where has not been determined for certain.

Morgan then attempted unsuccessfully to help establish or visit lodges and chapters in Batavia, but was denied participation in Batavia&#x27;s Masonic activities by members who were uncertain about Morgan&#x27;s character and claims to Masonic membership. Angered by the rejection, Morgan announced that he was going to publish an exposé titled &quot;Illustrations of Masonry&quot;, critical of the Freemasons and describing their secret degree ceremonies in detail.

When his intentions became known to the Batavia lodge, an attempt was made to burn down the business of the printer who planned to publish Morgan&#x27;s book. In September 1826, Morgan was arrested on flimsy allegations of failing to repay a loan and theft of a shirt and tie in an effort to prevent publication of his book by keeping him in jail. The individual who intended to publish Morgan&#x27;s book paid his bail and he was released from custody. Shortly afterwards, Morgan disappeared.

Some skeptics argued that Morgan had left the Batavia area on his own, either because he had been paid not to publish his book, or to escape Masonic retaliation for attempting to publish the book, or to generate publicity that would boost the book&#x27;s sales. The generally believed version of events was that Masons killed Morgan by drowning him in the Niagara River. Whether he fled or was murdered, Morgan&#x27;s disappearance led many to believe that Freemasonry was in conflict with good citizenship.

Because judges, businessmen, bankers and politicians were often Masons, ordinary citizens began to think of it as an elitist group. Moreover, many claimed that the lodges&#x27; secret oaths bound Masons to favor each other against outsiders in the courts and elsewhere.

Because some trials of alleged Morgan conspirators were mishandled and the Masons resisted further inquiries, many New Yorkers concluded that Masons controlled key offices and used their official authority to promote the goals of the fraternity by ensuring that Morgan&#x27;s supposed killers escaped punishment. When a member sought to reveal its secrets, so ran the conclusion, the Freemasons had done away with him. Because they controlled the courts and other offices, they were considered capable of obstructing the investigation. True Americans, they said, had to organize and defeat this conspiracy. If good government was to be restored &quot;all Masons must be purged from public office&quot;.

=== Party foundation ===
The Anti-Masonic Party was formed in Upstate New York in February 1828. Anti-Masons were opponents of Freemasonry, believing that it was a corrupt and elitist secret society which was ruling much of the country in defiance of republican principles. Many people regarded the Masonic organization and its adherents involved in government as corrupt.

Opposition to Masonry was taken up by some evangelical Protestant churches as a religious cause, particularly in the Burned-over district of upstate New York. Many churches passed resolutions condemning ministers and lay leaders who were Masons and several denominations condemned Freemasonry, including the Presbyterian, Congregational, Methodist and Baptist churches.

Anti-Masonry became a political issue in Western New York, where early in 1827 many mass meetings resolved not to support Masons for public office. In New York, the supporters of President John Quincy Adams, called &quot;Adams men&quot;, or Anti-Jacksonians, or National Republicans, were a feeble organization. Adams supporters used the strong anti-Masonic feeling to create a new party in opposition to the rising Jacksonian Democracy nationally and the Albany Regency political organization of Martin Van Buren in New York. In this effort, they were aided by the fact that Andrew Jackson was a high-ranking Mason and frequently spoke in praise of the organization. The alleged remark of Anti-Masonic organizer Thurlow Weed (which Weed denied), that an unidentified corpse found in the Niagara River was &quot;a good enough Morgan&quot; until after the 1828 elections, summarized the value of the Morgan disappearance for the opponents of Jackson.

=== Political rise ===
In the elections of 1828, the new party proved unexpectedly strong. Though its candidate for governor of New York, Solomon Southwick, was defeated, the Anti-Masonic Party became the main opposition party to the Jacksonian Democrats in New York. In 1829, it broadened its issues base when it became a champion of internal improvements and the protective tariff.

Anti-Masonic Party members expanded the use of party-affiliated newspapers for political organizing by publishing over 100, including Southwick&#x27;s &quot;National Observer&quot; and Weed&#x27;s &quot;Anti-Masonic Enquirer&quot;. By 1829, Weed&#x27;s &quot;Albany Journal&quot; had become the preeminent Anti-Masonic paper and it later became the leading Whig newspaper. The newspapers of the time reveled in partisanship and one brief paragraph in an &quot;Albany Journal&quot; article opposing Martin Van Buren included the words &quot;dangerous&quot;, &quot;demagogue&quot;, &quot;corrupt&quot;, &quot;degrade&quot;, &quot;pervert&quot;, &quot;prostitute&quot;, &quot;debauch&quot; and &quot;cursed&quot;.

=== Conventions and elections ===
A national Anti-Masonic organization was planned as early as 1827, when the New York leaders attempted unsuccessfully to persuade Henry Clay to renounce his Masonic membership and head the movement.

By 1830, the Anti-Masonic movement&#x27;s effort to broaden its appeal enabled it to spread to neighboring states, becoming especially strong in Pennsylvania and Vermont. In 1831, William A. Palmer was elected governor of Vermont on an Anti-Masonic ticket, an office he held until 1835. Palmer&#x27;s brother-in-law Augustine Clarke was an Anti-Masonic presidential elector in 1832, served as Vermont state treasurer from 1833 to 1837 and was appointed to the Anti-Masonic National Committee in 1837. Other Vermont Anti-Masonic electors in 1832 included former governor Ezra Butler and former United States representative William Strong.

The highest elected office held by a member of the Anti-Masonic Party was governor. Besides Palmer in Vermont, Joseph Ritner was the governor of Pennsylvania from 1835 to 1839.

In addition to Palmer and Ritner, Silas H. Jennison, an Anti-Mason, was elected Lieutenant Governor of Vermont with Whig support in 1835. No candidate, including Palmer, received a majority of votes for governor as required by the Vermont Constitution. The contest then moved to the Vermont General Assembly, which could not choose a winner. The General Assembly then opted to allow Jennison to act as governor until the next election. He won election as governor in his own right as a Whig in 1836 and served from 1836 to 1841.

Though the Anti-Masonic Party elected no senators and controlled no houses of a state legislature, Anti-Masons in state legislatures sometimes formed coalitions to elect senators and organize their chambers. Examples include: William Wilkins, elected to the Senate in 1830 by a coalition of Democrats and Anti-Masons in the Pennsylvania General Assembly; and William Sprague, elected speaker of the Rhode Island House of Representatives in 1831 by a coalition of Democrats and Anti-Masons.
The Anti-Masonic Party conducted the first presidential nominating convention in the United States history for the 1832 elections, nominating William Wirt (a former Mason) for president and Amos Ellmaker for vice president in Baltimore. Wirt won 7.8 percent of the popular vote and the seven electoral votes of Vermont. Soon the Democrats and Whigs recognized the convention&#x27;s value in managing parties and campaigns and began to hold their own.

Following Ritner&#x27;s election in 1835, a state convention was held in Harrisburg on December 14–17, 1835 to choose presidential electors for the 1836 election. The convention nominated William Henry Harrison for president and Francis Granger for vice president. The Vermont state Anti-Masonic convention followed suit on February 24, 1836. Anti-Masonic leaders were unable to obtain assurance from Harrison that he was not a Mason, so they called a national convention. The second national Anti-Masonic nominating convention was held in Philadelphia on May 4, 1836. The meeting was divisive, but a majority of the delegates officially stated that the party was not sponsoring a national ticket for the presidential election of 1836 and proposed a meeting in 1837 to discuss the future of the party.

Although Harrison lost the election to Democratic candidate Martin Van Buren in 1836, his strength throughout the North was hailed by Anti-Masonic leaders because the Anti-Masonic Party was the first to officially place his name in contention. By the mid-1830s, other Anti-Jacksonians had coalesced into the Whig Party, which had a broader issue base than the Anti-Masons. By the late 1830s, many of the Anti-Masonic movement&#x27;s members were moving to the Whigs, regarding that party as a better alternative to the Jacksonians, by then called Democrats. The Anti-Masonic Party held a conference in September 1837 to discuss its situation—one delegate was former president John Quincy Adams.

The Anti-Masonic Party held a third national nominating convention at Temperance Hall in Philadelphia on November 13–14, 1838. By this time, the party had been almost entirely supplanted by the Whigs. The Anti-Masons unanimously endorsed William Henry Harrison for president and Daniel Webster for vice president in the 1840 election. When the Whig National Convention nominated Harrison with John Tyler as his running mate, the Anti-Masonic Party did not make an alternate nomination and ceased to function, with most adherents being fully absorbed into the Whigs by 1840.

== Legacy ==

Anti-Masonry was deeply committed to conspiracy theories, primarily the claim that Masonic elites were trying to secretly control the government. As people became more mobile economically during the Industrial Revolution and began to move west when new states were populated by white settlers and added to the Union, the growth of the Anti-Masonic movement was caused by the political and social unrest resulting from the weakening of longstanding family and community ties. With Freemasonry one of the few institutions that remained stable during this time of change, it became a natural target for protesters. As a result, the Morgan Affair became the highly visible catalyst that turned a popular movement into a political party.

Under the banner of Anti-Masons, able leaders united Anti-Jacksonians and others who were discontented with existing political conditions. The fact that William Wirt, their choice for the presidency in 1832, not only was a former Mason, but also defended Freemasonry in a speech before the convention that nominated him indicates that opposition to Masonry was not the Anti-Masonic movement&#x27;s sole issue.

The Anti-Masonic movement gave rise to or expanded the use of many innovations which became accepted practice among other parties, including nominating conventions and party newspapers. In addition, the Anti-Masons aided in the rise of the Whig Party as the major alternative to the Democrats, with Anti-Masonic positions on issues including internal improvements and tariffs being adopted by the Whigs.

==Second Anti-Masonic Party==
A later political organization called the Anti-Masonic Party was active from 1872 until 1888. This second group had a more religious basis for its anti-Masonry and was closely associated with Jonathan Blanchard of Wheaton College.

== Members of Congress ==

The Anti-Masons did not elect anyone to the Senate, but elected several members of the House of Representatives.
