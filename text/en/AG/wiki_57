<text>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are a class of medications that are used primarily as antidepressants. TCAs were discovered in the early 1950s and were marketed later in the decade. They are named after their chemical structure, which contains three rings of atoms. Tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs), which contain four rings of atoms, are a closely related group of antidepressant compounds.

Although TCAs are sometimes prescribed for depressive disorders, they have been largely replaced in clinical use in most parts of the world by newer antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs). Adverse effects have been found to be of a similar level between TCAs and SSRIs.

== Medical uses ==
The TCAs are used primarily in the clinical treatment of mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), dysthymia, and treatment-resistant variants. They are also used in the treatment of a number of other medical disorders, including cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) and anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SP) also known as social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, premature ejaculation (clomipramine) and panic disorder (PD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, certain personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder (BPD) and Avoidant personality disorder(AvPD) neurological disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Autism Spectrum Disorder and as well as chronic pain, neuralgia or neuropathic pain, Complex regional pain syndrome and fibromyalgia, headache, or migraine, smoking cessation, tourette syndrome, trichotillomania, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), interstitial cystitis (IC), nocturnal enuresis (NE), narcolepsy, insomnia, pathological crying and/or laughing, chronic hiccups, ciguatera poisoning, and as an adjunct in schizophrenia and certain psychotic disorders.

Nortriptyline and desipramine may be preferred medications over other TCAs among older adults due to their reduced anticholinergic effects, diminished cardiac toxicity, and more linear pharmacokinetics.

=== Clinical depression ===
For many years the TCAs were the first choice for pharmacological treatment of major depression. Although they are still considered to be effective, they have been increasingly replaced by antidepressants with an improved safety and side-effect profile, such as the SSRIs and other newer antidepressants such as the novel reversible MAOI moclobemide. However, TCAs have been claimed to possibly be more effective in treating melancholic depression than other antidepressant drug classes. Newer antidepressants are thought to have fewer and less severe side effects and are also thought to be less likely to result in injury or death if used in a suicide attempt, as the doses required for clinical treatment and potentially lethal overdose (see therapeutic index) are far wider in comparison.

Nonetheless, the TCAs are commonly prescribed for treatment-resistant depression that has failed to respond to therapy with newer antidepressants, they also tend to have fewer emotional blunting and sexual side effects than SSRI antidepressants. They are not considered addictive and are somewhat preferable to the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The side effects of the TCAs usually come to prominence before the therapeutic benefits against depression and/or anxiety do, and for this reason, they may potentially be somewhat dangerous, as volition can be increased, possibly giving the patient a greater desire to attempt or commit suicide.

A 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of TCAs in the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses had not comprehensively assessed TCAs in the same fashion, with the largest including only two TCAs (amitriptyline and clomipramine) and only 36trials. A total of 103 short-term clinical trials with 10,590 participants employing 12 different TCAs (and TeCAs) were included. TCAs showed a small benefit on depression over that of placebo in terms of reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HDRS-17) scores (mean difference: –3.77 points; or with removal of an outlier study: –3.16 points). Due to the possibility of unblinding by side effects, it was unclear whether TCAs had a genuine antidepressant effect or whether the benefits were merely due to amplified placebo effects. TCAs had a higher rate of serious adverse effects than placebo, but this did not reach statistical significance ( = 2.78; 95% CI: 2.18–3.55; k = 35). The quality of evidence was low to very low and the results were at high risk of bias. Among the collaborators of the systematic review and meta-analysis included Irving Kirsch, Joanna Moncrieff, and Michael P. Hengartner.

=== Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ===
The TCAs were used in the past in the clinical treatment of ADHD, though they are not typically used anymore, having been replaced by more effective agents with fewer side effects such as atomoxetine (Strattera, Tomoxetin) and stimulants like methylphenidate (Ritalin, Focalin, Concerta), and amphetamine (Adderall, Attentin, Dexedrine, Vyvanse). ADHD is thought to be caused by an insufficiency of dopamine and norepinephrine activity in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Most of the TCAs inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine, though not dopamine, and as a result, they show some efficacy in remedying the disorder. Notably, the TCAs are more effective in treating the behavioral aspects of ADHD than the cognitive deficits, as they help limit hyperactivity and impulsivity, but have little to no benefits on attention.

=== Chronic pain ===
The TCAs show efficacy in the clinical treatment of a number of different types of chronic pain, notably neuralgia or neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. The precise mechanism of action in explanation of their analgesic efficacy is unclear, but it is thought that they indirectly modulate the opioid system in the brain downstream via serotonergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation, among other properties. They are also effective in migraine prophylaxis, though not in the instant relief of an acute migraine attack. They may also be effective to prevent chronic tension headaches.

== Side effects ==
Many side effects may be related to the antimuscarinic properties of the TCAs. Such side effects are relatively common and may include dry mouth, dry nose, blurry vision, lowered gastrointestinal motility or constipation, urinary retention, cognitive and/or memory impairment, and increased body temperature.

Other side effects may include drowsiness, anxiety, emotional blunting (apathy/anhedonia), confusion, restlessness, dizziness, akathisia, hypersensitivity, changes in appetite and weight, sweating, muscle twitches, weakness, nausea and vomiting, hypotension, tachycardia, and rarely, irregular heart rhythms. Twitching, hallucinations, delirium and coma are also some of the toxic effects caused by overdose. Rhabdomyolysis or muscle breakdown has been rarely reported with this class of drugs as well.

Delayed ejaculation may be experienced by some tricyclic antidepressants such as clomipramine.

Tolerance to these adverse effects of these drugs often develops if treatment is continued. Side effects may also be less troublesome if treatment is initiated with low doses and then gradually increased, although this may also delay the beneficial effects.

TCAs can behave like class 1A antiarrhythmics, as such, they can theoretically terminate ventricular fibrillation, decrease cardiac contractility and increase collateral blood circulation to ischemic heart muscle. Naturally, in overdose, they can be cardiotoxic, prolonging heart rhythms and increasing myocardial irritability.

New research has also revealed compelling evidence of a link between long-term use of anticholinergic medications like TCAs and dementia. Although many studies have investigated this link, this was the first study to use a long-term approach (over seven years) to find that dementias associated with anticholinergics may not be reversible even years after drug use stops. Anticholinergic drugs block the action of acetylcholine, which transmits messages in the nervous system. In the brain, acetylcholine is involved in learning and memory.

=== Discontinuation ===
Antidepressants in general may produce withdrawal. However, since the term &quot;withdrawal&quot; has been linked to addiction to recreational drugs like opioids, the medical profession and pharmaceutical public relations prefer that a different term be used, hence &quot;discontinuation syndrome.&quot; Discontinuation symptoms can be managed by a gradual reduction in dosage over a period of weeks or months to minimise symptoms.
In tricyclics, discontinuation syndrome symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, cholinergic rebound, headache, nausea, malaise, or motor disturbance.

== Overdose ==
TCA overdose is a significant cause of fatal drug poisoning. The severe morbidity and mortality associated with these drugs is well documented due to their cardiovascular and neurological toxicity. Additionally, it is a serious problem in the pediatric population due to their inherent toxicity and the availability of these in the home when prescribed for bed-wetting and depression. In the event of a known or suspected overdose, medical assistance should be sought immediately.

A number of treatments are effective in a TCA overdose.

An overdose on TCA is especially fatal as it is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract in the alkaline conditions of the small intestines. As a result, toxicity often becomes apparent in the first hour after an overdose. However, symptoms may take several hours to appear if a mixed overdose has caused delayed gastric emptying.

Many of the initial signs are those associated to the anticholinergic effects of TCAs such as dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, constipation, dizziness, and emesis (or vomiting). Due to the location of norepinephrine receptors all over the body, many physical signs are also associated with a TCA overdose:

# Anticholinergic effects: altered mental status (e.g., agitation, confusion, lethargy, etc.), resting sinus tachycardia, dry mouth, mydriasis, blurred vision, fever
# Cardiac effects: hypertension (early and transient, should not be treated), tachycardia, orthostasis and hypotension, arrhythmias (including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, most serious consequence), ECG changes (prolonged QRS, QT, and PR intervals)
# CNS effects: syncope, seizure, coma, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, convulsions, drowsiness
# Pulmonary effects: hypoventilation resulting from CNS depression
# Gastrointestinal effects: decreased or absent bowel sounds, constipation

Treatment of TCA overdose depends on severity of symptoms:

Initially, gastric decontamination of the patient is achieved by administering, either orally or via a nasogastric tube, activated charcoal pre-mixed with water, which adsorbs the drug in the gastrointestinal tract (most useful if given within 2 hours of drug ingestion). Other decontamination methods such as stomach pumps, gastric lavage, whole bowel irrigation, or (ipecac induced) emesis, are &quot;not&quot;  recommended in TCA poisoning.

If there is metabolic acidosis, intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate is recommended by Toxbase.org, the UK and Ireland poisons advice database (TCAs are protein bound and become less bound in more acidic conditions, so by reversing the acidosis, protein binding increases and bioavailability thus decreases – the sodium load may also help to reverse the Na+ channel blocking effects of the TCA).

== Interactions ==

The TCAs are highly metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) hepatic enzymes. Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 (for example cimetidine, methylphenidate, fluoxetine, antipsychotics, and calcium channel blockers) may produce decreases in the TCAs&#x27; metabolism, leading to increases in their blood concentrations and accompanying toxicity. Drugs that prolong the QT interval including antiarrhythmics such as quinidine, the antihistamines astemizole and terfenadine, and some antipsychotics may increase the chance of ventricular dysrhythmias. TCAs may enhance the response to alcohol and the effects of barbiturates and other CNS depressants. Side effects may also be enhanced by other drugs that have antimuscarinic properties.

== Pharmacology ==
The majority of the TCAs act primarily as SNRIs by blocking the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), which results in an elevation of the synaptic concentrations of these neurotransmitters, and therefore an enhancement of neurotransmission. Notably, with the sole exception of amineptine, the TCAs have weak affinity for the dopamine transporter (DAT), and therefore have low efficacy as dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs). Both serotonin and norepinephrine have been highly implicated in depression and anxiety, and it has been shown that facilitation of their activity has beneficial effects on these mental disorders.

In addition to their reuptake inhibition, many TCAs also have high affinity as antagonists at the 5-HT1, 5-HT2 (5-HT2A and 5-HT2C), 5-HT6, 5-HT7, α1-adrenergic, and NMDA receptors, and as agonists at the sigma receptors (σ1 and σ2), some of which may contribute to their therapeutic efficacy, as well as their side effects. The TCAs also have varying but typically high affinity for antagonising the H1 and H2 histamine receptors, as well as the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. As a result, they also act as potent antihistamines and anticholinergics. These properties are often beneficial in antidepressants, especially with comorbid anxiety, as it provides a sedative effect.

Most, if not all, of the TCAs also potently inhibit sodium channels and -type calcium channels, and therefore act as sodium channel blockers and calcium channel blockers, respectively. The former property is responsible for the high mortality rate upon overdose seen with the TCAs via cardiotoxicity. It may also be involved in their efficacy as analgesics, however.

In summary, tricyclic antidepressants can act through NMDA antagonism, opioidergic effects, sodium, potassium and calcium channel blocking, through interfering with the reuptake of serotonin and acting as antagonists to SHAM (serotonin, histamine, alpha, muscarinic) receptors.

=== Binding profiles ===
The binding profiles of various TCAs and some metabolites in terms of their affinities (, ) for various receptors and transporters are as follows:

With the exception of the sigma receptors, the TCAs act as antagonists or inverse agonists of the receptors and as inhibitors of the transporters. Tianeptine is included in this list due to it technically being a TCA, but with a vastly different pharmacology.

Therapeutic levels of TCAs are generally in the range of about 100 to 300 ng/mL, or 350 to 1,100 nM. Plasma protein binding is generally 90% or greater.

== Chemistry ==
There are two major groups of TCAs in terms of chemical structure, which most, but not all, TCAs fall into. The groupings are based on the tricyclic ring system. They are the dibenzazepines (imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, lofepramine) and the dibenzocycloheptadienes (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, butriptyline). Minor TCA groups based on ring system include the dibenzoxepins (doxepin), the dibenzothiepines (dosulepin), and the dibenzoxazepines (amoxapine).

In addition to classification based on the ring system, TCAs can also be usefully grouped based on the number of substitutions of the side chain amine. These groups include the tertiary amines (imipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, amitriptyline, butriptyline, doxepin, dosulepin) and the secondary amines (desipramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline). Lofepramine is technically a tertiary amine, but acts largely as a prodrug of desipramine, a secondary amine, and hence is more similar in profile to the secondary amines than to the tertiary amines. Amoxapine does not have the TCA side chain and hence is neither a tertiary nor secondary amine, although it is often grouped with the secondary amines due to sharing more in common with them. In 2021, a new method was developed at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia for designing photochromic analogs of tricyclic drugs via (1) isosteric replacement of the two-atom bridge between the aromatic systems with an azo group and (2) opening of the central ring. The authors named the strategy &quot;crypto-azologization&quot;.

== History ==
The TCAs were developed amid the &quot;explosive birth&quot; of psychopharmacology in the early 1950s. The story begins with the synthesis of chlorpromazine in December 1950 by Rhône-Poulenc&#x27;s chief chemist, Paul Charpentier, from synthetic antihistamines developed by Rhône-Poulenc in the 1940s. Its psychiatric effects were first noticed at a hospital in Paris in 1952. The first widely used psychiatric drug, by 1955 it was already generating significant revenue as an antipsychotic. Research chemists quickly began to explore other derivatives of chlorpromazine.

The first TCA reported for the treatment of depression was imipramine, a dibenzazepine analogue of chlorpromazine code-named G22355. It was not originally targeted for the treatment of depression. The drug&#x27;s tendency to induce manic effects was &quot;later described as &#x27;in some patients, quite disastrous&#x27;&quot;. The paradoxical observation of a sedative inducing mania led to testing with depressed patients. The first trial of imipramine took place in 1955 and the first report of antidepressant effects was published by Swiss psychiatrist Roland Kuhn in 1957. Some testing of Geigy&#x27;s imipramine, then known as Tofranil, took place at the Münsterlingen Hospital near Konstanz. Geigy later became Ciba-Geigy and eventually Novartis.

Dibenzazepine derivatives are described in U.S. patent 3,074,931 issued 1963-01-22 by assignment to Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories. The compounds described share a tricyclic backbone different from the backbone of the TCA amitriptyline.

Merck introduced the second member of the TCA family, amitriptyline (Elavil), in 1961. This compound has a different three-ring structure than imipramine.

== Society and culture ==

=== Recreational use ===
A very small number of cases involving non-medical use of antidepressants have been reported over the past 30 years. According to the US government classification of psychiatric medications, TCAs are &quot;non-abusable&quot; and generally have low misuse potential. Nonetheless, due to their atypical mechanism of action, amineptine and tianeptine (dopamine reuptake inhibition and μ-opioid receptor agonism, respectively) are the two TCAs with the highest addiction and misuse potential. Several cases of the misuse of amitriptyline alone or together with methadone or in other drug dependent patients and of dosulepin with alcohol or in methadone patients have been reported.

<doc id="31496" wikidata="Q172478" url="?curid=31496" title="Ted Williams">
<text>Theodore Samuel Williams (August 30, 1918 – July 5, 2002) was an American professional baseball player and manager. He played his entire 19-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career, primarily as a left fielder, for the Boston Red Sox from 1939 to 1960; his career was interrupted by military service during World War II and the Korean War. Nicknamed &quot;Teddy Ballgame&quot;, &quot;the Kid&quot;, &quot;the Splendid Splinter&quot;, and &quot;the Thumper&quot;, Williams is widely regarded as one of the greatest hitters in baseball history in addition to being the last player to hit over .400 in a season.

Williams was a nineteen-time All-Star, a two-time recipient of the AL Most Valuable Player Award, a six-time AL batting champion, and a two-time Triple Crown winner. He finished his playing career with a .344 batting average, 521 home runs, and a 1.116 on-base plus slugging percentage, the third highest of all time. His career batting average is the highest of any MLB player whose career was played primarily after World War II, and ranks 11th all-time.

Born and raised in San Diego, Williams played baseball throughout his youth. After joining the Red Sox in 1939, he immediately emerged as one of the sport&#x27;s best hitters. In 1941, Williams posted a .406 batting average; he is the last baseball player to bat over .400 in a season. Williams&#x27;s .482 on-base percentage is the highest of all-time. Williams followed this up by winning his first Triple Crown in 1942. Williams was required to interrupt his baseball career in 1943 to serve three years in the United States Navy and Marine Corps during World War II. Upon returning to MLB in 1946, Williams won his first AL MVP Award and played in his only World Series. In 1947, he won his second Triple Crown. Williams was returned to active military duty for portions of the 1952 and 1953 seasons to serve as a Marine combat aviator in the Korean War. In 1957 and 1958 at the ages of 39 and 40, respectively, he was the AL batting champion for the fifth and sixth time.

Williams retired from playing in 1960. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1966, in his first year of eligibility. Williams managed the Washington Senators/Texas Rangers franchise from 1969 to 1972. An avid sport fisherman, he hosted a television program about fishing, and was inducted into the IGFA Fishing Hall of Fame. Williams&#x27; involvement in the Jimmy Fund helped raise millions in dollars for cancer care and research. In 1991, President George H. W. Bush presented Williams with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award bestowed by the United States government. He was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Time Team in 1997 and the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999.

==Early life==
Williams was born in San Diego, California, on August 30, 1918, and named &quot;Teddy Samuel Williams&quot; after former president Theodore &quot;Teddy&quot; Roosevelt as well as his father, Samuel Stuart Williams. Williams himself claimed that his middle name was in honor of a maternal uncle (whose name was actually Daniel Venzor) who had been killed in World War I. He disliked the name &quot;Teddy&quot; and later amended his birth certificate to say &quot;Theodore&quot; instead.

His father was a soldier, sheriff, and photographer from Ardsley, New York, who had served in the United States Army and was a veteran of Philippine–American War. His mother, May Venzor, American from El Paso, Texas, was an evangelist and lifelong soldier in the Salvation Army. Williams resented his mother&#x27;s long hours working in the Salvation Army, and Williams and his brother cringed when she took them to the Army&#x27;s street-corner revivals.

Williams&#x27; paternal ancestors were a mix of Welsh, English, and Irish. The maternal, Spanish-Mexican side of Williams&#x27; family was quite diverse, having Basque, Russian, and American Indian roots. Of his Mexican ancestry he said that &quot;If I had my mother&#x27;s name, there is no doubt I would have run into problems in those days, [considering] the prejudices people had in Southern California.&quot;

Williams lived in San Diego&#x27;s North Park neighborhood (4121 Utah Street). At the age of eight, he was taught how to throw a baseball by his uncle, Saul Venzor. Saul was one of his mother&#x27;s four brothers, as well as a former semi-professional baseball player who had pitched against Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Joe Gordon in an exhibition game. As a child, Williams&#x27; heroes were Pepper Martin of the St. Louis Cardinals and Bill Terry of the New York Giants. Williams graduated from Herbert Hoover High School in San Diego, where he played baseball as a pitcher and was the star of the team. During this time, he also played American Legion Baseball, later being named the 1960 American Legion Baseball Graduate of the Year.

Though he had offers from the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Yankees while he was still in high school, his mother thought he was too young to leave home, so he signed up with the local Pacific Coast League (PCL) club, the San Diego Padres.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues (1936–1938)===
Williams played back-up behind Vince DiMaggio and Ivey Shiver on the (then) Pacific Coast League&#x27;s San Diego Padres. While in the Pacific Coast League in 1936, Williams met future teammates and friends Dom DiMaggio and Bobby Doerr, who were on the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s San Francisco Seals. When Shiver announced he was quitting to become a high school football coach in Savannah, Georgia, the job, by default, was open for Williams. Williams posted a .271 batting average and 11 runs batted in (RBI) on 107 at bats in 42 games for the Padres in 1936. Unknown to Williams, he had caught the eye of the Boston Red Sox&#x27;s general manager, Eddie Collins, while Collins was scouting Doerr and the shortstop George Myatt in August 1936.

Collins later explained, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t hard to find Ted Williams. He stood out like a brown cow in a field of white cows.&quot; In the 1937 season, after graduating from Hoover High in the winter, Williams finally broke into the line-up on June 22, when he hit an inside-the-park home run to help the Padres win 3–2. The Padres ended up winning the PCL title, while Williams ended up hitting .291 with 23 home runs and 98 RBI in 138 games. Meanwhile, Collins kept in touch with Padres general manager Bill Lane, calling him two times throughout the season. In December 1937, during the winter meetings, the deal was made between Lane and Collins, sending Williams to the Boston Red Sox and giving Lane $35,000 and two major leaguers, Dom D&#x27;Allessandro and Al Niemiec, and two other minor leaguers.

In 1938, the 19-year-old Williams was 10 days late to spring training camp in Sarasota, Florida, because of a flood in California that blocked the railroads. Williams had to borrow $200 from a bank to make the trip from San Diego to Sarasota. Also during spring training Williams was nicknamed &quot;the Kid&quot; by Red Sox equipment manager Johnny Orlando, who after Williams arrived to Sarasota for the first time, said, &quot;″The Kid&#x27; has arrived&quot;. Orlando still called Williams &quot;the Kid&quot; 20 years later, and the nickname stuck with Williams the rest of his life. Williams remained in major league spring training for about a week. Williams was then sent to the Double-A-league Minneapolis Millers. While in the Millers training camp for the springtime, Williams met Rogers Hornsby, who had hit over .400 three times, including a .424 average in 1924. Hornsby, who was a coach for the Millers that spring, gave Williams useful advice, including how to &quot;get a good pitch to hit&quot;. Talking with the game&#x27;s greats would become a pattern for Williams, who also talked with Hugh Duffy, who hit .438 in 1894, Bill Terry who hit .401 in 1930, and Ty Cobb with whom he would argue that a batter should hit up on the ball, opposed to Cobb&#x27;s view that a batter should hit down on the ball.

While in Minnesota, Williams quickly became the team&#x27;s star. He collected his first hit in the Millers&#x27; first game of the season, as well as his first and second home runs during his third game. Both were inside-the-park home runs, with the second traveling an estimated on the fly to a center field fence. Williams later had a 22 game hitting streak that lasted from Memorial Day through mid-June. While the Millers ended up sixth place in an eight-team race, Williams ended up hitting .366 with 46 home runs and 142 RBI in 148 games. He received the American Association&#x27;s Triple Crown and finished second in the voting for Most Valuable Player.

===Major leagues (1939–1942, 1946–1960)===

====1939–1940====
Williams came to spring training three days late in 1939, thanks to Williams driving from California to Florida, as well as respiratory problems, the latter of which would plague Williams for the rest of his career. In the winter, the Red Sox traded right fielder Ben Chapman to the Cleveland Indians to make room for Williams on the roster, even though Chapman had hit .340 in the previous season. This led &quot;Boston Globe&quot; sports journalist Gerry Moore to quip, &quot;Not since Joe DiMaggio broke in with the Yankees by &quot;five for five&quot; in St. Petersburg in 1936 has any baseball rookie received the nationwide publicity that has been accorded this spring to Theodore Francis Williams&quot;. Williams inherited Chapman&#x27;s number 9 on his uniform as opposed to Williams&#x27; number 5 in the previous spring training. He made his major league debut against the New York Yankees on April 20, going 1-for-4 against Yankee pitcher Red Ruffing. This was the only game which featured both Williams and Lou Gehrig playing against one another. 

In his first series at Fenway Park, Williams hit a double, a home run, and a triple, the first two against Cotton Pippen, who gave Williams his first strikeout as a professional while Williams had been in San Diego. By July, Williams was hitting just .280, but leading the league in RBI. Johnny Orlando, now Williams&#x27; friend, then gave Williams a quick pep talk, telling Williams that he should hit .335 with 35 home runs and he would drive in 150 runs. Williams said he would buy Orlando a Cadillac if this all came true. In 149 games, Williams batted .327 with 31 home runs and 145 RBI, leading the league in the latter category, the first rookie to lead the league in RBIs and finishing fourth in MVP voting. He also led the AL in walks, with 107, a rookie record. Even though there was not a Rookie of the Year award yet in 1939, Babe Ruth declared Williams to be the Rookie of the Year, which Williams later said was &quot;good enough for me&quot;.

Williams&#x27; pay doubled in 1940, going from $5,000 to $10,000. A new bullpen was added in right field of Fenway Park, reducing the distance from home plate from 400 feet to 380 feet and earning the nickname &quot;Williamsburg&quot; for being &quot;obviously designed for Williams&quot;. Williams was then switched from right field to left field, as there would be less sun in his eyes, and it would give Dom DiMaggio a chance to play center. Finally, Williams was flip-flopped in the order with the great slugger Jimmie Foxx, with the idea that Williams would get more pitches to hit. Pitchers, though, proved willing to pitch around the eagle-eyed Williams in favor of facing the 32-year-old Foxx, the reigning AL home run champion, followed by the still highly productive 33-year-old Joe Cronin, the player-manager. Williams also made his first of 16 All-Star Game appearances in 1940, going 0-for-2. Although Williams hit .344, his power and runs batted in were down from the previous season, with 23 home runs and 113 RBI in 144 games played. Williams also caused a controversy in mid-August when he called his salary &quot;peanuts&quot;, along with saying he hated the city of Boston and reporters, leading reporters to lash back at him, saying that he should be traded. Williams said that the &quot;only real fun&quot; he had in 1940 was being able to pitch once on August 24, when he pitched the last two innings in a 12–1 loss to the Detroit Tigers, allowing one earned run on three hits, while striking out one batter, Rudy York.

====1941====

In the second week of spring training in 1941, Williams broke a bone in his right ankle, limiting him to pinch hitting for the first two weeks of the season. Bobby Doerr later claimed that the injury would be the foundation of Williams&#x27; season, as it forced him to put less pressure on his right foot for the rest of the season. Against the Chicago White Sox on May 7, in extra innings, Williams told the Red Sox pitcher, Charlie Wagner, to hold the White Sox, since he was going to hit a home run. In the 11th inning, Williams&#x27; prediction came true, as he hit a big blast to help the Red Sox win.

The home run is still considered to be the longest home run ever hit in the old Comiskey Park, some saying that it went . Williams&#x27; average slowly climbed in the first half of May, and on May 15, he started a 22-game hitting streak. From May 17 to June 1, Williams batted .536, with his season average going above .400 on May 25 and then continuing up to .430. By the All-Star break, Williams was hitting .406 with 16 home runs and 62 RBI.

In the 1941 All-Star Game, Williams batted fourth behind Joe DiMaggio, who was in the midst of his record-breaking hitting streak, having hit safely in 48 consecutive games. In the fourth inning Williams doubled to drive in a run. With the National League (NL) leading 5–2 in the eighth inning, Williams struck out in the middle of an American League (AL) rally. In the ninth inning the AL still trailed 5–3; Ken Keltner and Joe Gordon singled, and Cecil Travis walked to load the bases. DiMaggio grounded to the infield and Billy Herman, attempting to complete a double play, threw wide of first base, allowing Keltner to score. With the score 5–4 and runners on first and third, Williams homered with his eyes closed to secure a 7–5 AL win. Williams later said that that game-winning home run &quot;remains to this day the most thrilling hit of my life&quot;.

In late August, Williams was hitting .402. Williams said that &quot;just about everybody was rooting for me&quot; to hit .400 in the season, including Yankee fans, who gave pitcher Lefty Gomez a &quot;hell of a boo&quot; after walking Williams with the bases loaded after Williams had gotten three straight hits one game in September. In mid-September, Williams was hitting .413, but dropped a point a game from then on. Before the final two games on September 28, a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Athletics, he was batting .39955, which would have been officially rounded up to .400. Red Sox manager Joe Cronin offered him the chance to sit out the final day, but he declined. &quot;If I&#x27;m going to be a .400 hitter&quot;, he said at the time, &quot;I want more than my toenails on the line.&quot; Williams went 6-for-8 on the day, finishing the season at .406. (Sacrifice flies were counted as at-bats in 1941; under today&#x27;s rules, Williams would have hit between .411 and .419, based on contemporaneous game accounts.) Philadelphia fans ran out on the field to surround Williams after the game, forcing him to protect his hat from being stolen; he was helped into the clubhouse by his teammates. Along with his .406 average, Williams also hit 37 home runs and recorded 120 RBI in 143 games, missing the Triple Crown by five RBI.

Williams&#x27; 1941 season is often considered to be the best offensive season of all time, though the MVP award would go to DiMaggio. The .406 batting average—his first of six batting championships—is still the highest single-season average in Red Sox history and the highest batting average in the major leagues since 1924, and the last time any major league player has hit over .400 for a season after averaging at least 3.1 plate appearances per game. (&quot;If I had known hitting .400 was going to be such a big deal&quot;, he quipped in 1991, &quot;I would have done it again.&quot;) Williams&#x27; on-base percentage of .553 and slugging percentage of .735 that season are both also the highest single-season averages in Red Sox history. The .553 OBP stood as a major league record until it was broken by Barry Bonds in 2002 and his .735 slugging percentage was the highest mark in the major leagues between 1932 and 1994. His OPS of 1.287 that year, a Red Sox record, was the highest in the major leagues between 1923 and 2001. Despite playing in only 143 games that year, Williams led the league with 135 runs scored and 37 home runs, and he finished third with 335 total bases, the most home runs, runs scored, and total bases by a Red Sox player since Jimmie Foxx&#x27;s in 1938. Williams placed second in MVP voting; DiMaggio won, 291 votes to 254, on the strength of his record-breaking 56-game hitting streak and league-leading 125 RBI.

====1942–1945====
====U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps====
In January 1942, Williams was drafted into the military, being put into Class 1-A. A friend of Williams suggested that Williams see the advisor of the governor&#x27;s Selective Service Appeal Agent, since Williams was the sole support of his mother, arguing that Williams should not have been placed in Class 1-A, and said Williams should be reclassified to Class 3-A. Williams was reclassified to 3-A ten days later. Afterwards, the public reaction was extremely negative, even though the baseball book &quot;Season of &#x27;42&quot; states only four All-Stars and one first-line pitcher entered military service during the 1942 season. (Many more MLB players would enter service during the 1943 season.)

Quaker Oats stopped sponsoring Williams, and Williams, who previously had eaten Quaker products &quot;all the time&quot;, never &quot;[ate] one since&quot; the company stopped sponsoring him. Despite the trouble with the draft board, Williams had a new salary of $30,000 in 1942. In the season, Williams won the Triple Crown, with a .356 batting average, 36 home runs, and 137 RBI in 150 games. On May 21, Williams also hit his 100th career home run. He was the third Red Sox player to hit 100 home runs with the team, following teammates Jimmie Foxx and Joe Cronin. Despite winning the Triple Crown, Williams came in second in the MVP voting, losing to Joe Gordon of the Yankees. Williams felt that he should have gotten a &quot;little more consideration&quot; because of winning the Triple Crown, and he thought that &quot;the reason I didn&#x27;t get more consideration was because of the trouble I had with the draft [boards]&quot;.

Williams joined the Navy Reserve on May 22, 1942, went on active duty in 1943, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps as a naval aviator on May 2, 1944. Williams also played on the baseball team in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, along with his Red Sox teammate Johnny Pesky in pre-flight training, after eight weeks in Amherst, Massachusetts, and the Civilian Pilot Training Course. While on the baseball team, Williams was sent back to Fenway Park on July 12, 1943, to play on an All-Star team managed by Babe Ruth. The newspapers reported that Ruth said when finally meeting Williams, &quot;Hiya, kid. You remind me a lot of myself. I love to hit. You&#x27;re one of the most natural ballplayers I&#x27;ve ever seen. And if my record is broken, I hope you&#x27;re the one to do it&quot;. Williams later said he was &quot;flabbergasted&quot; by the incident, as &quot;after all, it was Babe Ruth&quot;. In the game, Williams hit a 425-foot home run to help give the American League All-Stars a 9–8 win.

====Service baseball====
On September 2, 1945, when the war ended, Lt. Williams was in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii awaiting orders as a replacement pilot. While in Pearl Harbor, Williams played baseball in the Navy League. Also in that eight-team league were Joe DiMaggio, Joe Gordon, and Stan Musial. The Service World Series with the Army versus the Navy attracted crowds of 40,000 for each game. The players said it was even better than the actual World Series being played between the Detroit Tigers and Chicago Cubs that year.

====1946–1949====

Williams was discharged by the Marine Corps on January 28, 1946, in time to begin preparations for the upcoming pro baseball season. He joined the Red Sox again in 1946, signing a $37,500 contract. On July 14, after Williams hit three home runs and eight RBI in the first game of a doubleheader, Lou Boudreau, inspired by Williams&#x27; consistent pull hitting to right field, created what would later be known as the Boudreau shift (also Williams shift) against Williams, having only one player on the left side of second base (the left fielder). Ignoring the shift, Williams walked twice, doubled, and grounded out to the shortstop, who was positioned in between first and second base. Also during 1946, the All-Star Game was held in Fenway Park. In the game, Williams homered in the fourth inning against Kirby Higbe, singled in a run in the fifth inning, singled in the seventh inning, and hit a three-run home run against Rip Sewell&#x27;s &quot;eephus pitch&quot; in the eighth inning to help the American League win 12–0.

For the 1946 season, Williams hit .342 with 38 home runs and 123 RBI in 150 games, helping the Red Sox win the pennant on September 13, in a 1–0 win over Cleveland; Williams hit the only inside-the-park home run in his Major League career for the only run of the game. On June 9, he hit what is considered to be the longest home run in Fenway Park history, at and subsequently marked with a lone red seat in the Fenway bleachers. Williams ran away as the winner in the MVP voting. During an exhibition game in Fenway Park against an All-Star team during early October, Williams was hit on the elbow by a curveball by the Washington Senators&#x27; pitcher Mickey Haefner. Williams was immediately taken out of the game, and X-rays of his arm showed no damage, but his arm was &quot;swelled up like a boiled egg&quot;, according to Williams. Williams could not swing a bat again until four days later, one day before the World Series, when he reported the arm as &quot;sore&quot;. During the series, Williams batted .200 (5-for-25) with no home runs and just one RBI. The Red Sox lost in seven games. Fifty years later when asked what one thing he would have done different in his life, Williams replied, &quot;I&#x27;d have done better in the &#x27;46 World Series. God, I would&quot;. The 1946 World Series was the only World Series Williams ever appeared in.

Williams signed a $70,000 contract in 1947. Williams was also almost traded for Joe DiMaggio in 1947. In late April, Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey and Yankees owner Dan Topping agreed to swap the players, but a day later canceled the deal when Yawkey requested that Yogi Berra come with DiMaggio. In May, Williams was hitting .337. Williams won the Triple Crown in 1947, but lost the MVP award to Joe DiMaggio, 202 points to 201 points. One writer left Williams off his ballot. Williams said he thought it was Mel Webb, whom Williams called a &quot;grouchy old guy&quot;, although it now appears it was not Webb, and three writers left DiMaggio off of their ballots. Williams was the third major league player to have had at least four 30-home run and 100-RBI seasons in their first five years, joining Chuck Klein and Joe DiMaggio, and followed by Ralph Kiner, Mark Teixeira, Albert Pujols, and Ryan Braun through 2011.

In 1948, under their new manager, the ex-New York Yankee great skipper Joe McCarthy, Williams hit a league-leading .369 with 25 home runs and 127 RBIs, and was third in MVP voting. On April 29, Williams hit his 200th career home run. He became just the second player to hit 200 home runs in a Red Sox uniform, joining his former teammate Jimmie Foxx. On October 2, against the Yankees, Williams hit his 222nd career home run, tying Foxx for the Red Sox all-time record. In the Red Sox&#x27; final two games of the regular schedule, they beat the Yankees (to force a one-game playoff against the Cleveland Indians) and Williams got on base eight times out of ten plate appearances. In the playoff, Williams went 1-for-4, with the Red Sox losing 8–3.

In 1949, Williams received a new salary of $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms). He hit .343 (losing the AL batting title by just .0002 to the Tigers&#x27; George Kell, thus missing the Triple Crown that year), hitting 43 home runs, his career high, and driving in 159 runs, tied for highest in the league, and at one point, he got on base in 84 straight games, an MLB record that still stands today, helping him win the MVP trophy. On April 28, Williams hit his 223rd career home run, breaking the record for most home runs in a Red Sox uniform, passing Jimmie Foxx. Williams is still the Red Sox career home run leader. However, despite being ahead of the Yankees by one game just before a two-game series against them (last regular-season games for both teams), the Red Sox lost both of those games and the Yankees won the pennant. They went on to win the first of what would be five straight World Series titles, beginning with 1949. For the rest of Williams&#x27; career, the Yankees won nine pennants and six World Series titles, while the Red Sox never finished better than third place.

====1950–1955====
In 1950, Williams was playing in his eighth All-Star Game. In the first inning, Williams caught a line drive by Ralph Kiner, slamming into the Comiskey Park scoreboard and breaking his left arm. Williams played the rest of the game, and he even singled in a run to give the American League the lead in the fifth inning, but by that time Williams&#x27; arm was a &quot;balloon&quot; and he was in great pain, so he left the game. Both of the doctors who X-rayed Williams held little hope for a full recovery. The doctors operated on Williams for two hours. When Williams took his cast off, he could only extend the arm to within four inches of his right arm. Williams only played 89 games in 1950, but managed to hit .317 with 28 home runs and 97 RBI. After the baseball season, Williams&#x27; elbow hurt so much he considered retirement, since he thought he would never be able to hit again. Tom Yawkey, the Red Sox owner, then sent Jack Fadden to Williams&#x27; Florida home to talk to Williams. Williams later thanked Fadden for saving his career.

In 1951, Williams &quot;struggled&quot; to hit .318, with his elbow still hurting. Williams also played in 148 games, 60 more than Williams had played the previous season, 30 home runs, two more than he had hit in 1950, and 126 RBI, twenty-nine more than 1950. Despite his lower-than-usual production at bat, Williams made the All-Star team. On May 15, 1951, Williams became the 11th player in major league history to hit 300 career home runs. On May 21, Williams passed Chuck Klein for 10th place, on May 25 Williams passed Hornsby for ninth place, and on July 5 Williams passed Al Simmons for eighth place all-time in career home runs. After the season, manager Steve O&#x27;Neill was fired, with Lou Boudreau replacing him. Boudreau&#x27;s first announcement as manager was that all Red Sox players were &quot;expendable&quot;, including Williams.

===U.S. Marine Corps, Korea (1952–1953)===
Williams&#x27; name was called from a list of inactive reserves to serve on active duty in the Korean War on January 9, 1952. Williams, who was livid at his recalling, had a physical scheduled for April 2. Williams passed his physical and in May, after only playing in six major league games, began refresher flight training and qualification prior to service in Korea. Right before he left for Korea, the Red Sox had a &quot;Ted Williams Day&quot; in Fenway Park. Friends of Williams gave him a Cadillac, and the Red Sox gave Williams a memory book that was signed by 400,000 fans. The governor of Massachusetts and mayor of Boston were there, along with a Korean War veteran named Frederick Wolf who used a wheelchair for mobility. At the end of the ceremony, everyone in the park held hands and sang &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; to Williams, a moment which he later said &quot;moved me quite a bit.&quot; Private Wolf (an injured Korean veteran from Brooklyn) presented gifts from wounded veterans to Ted Williams. Ted choked and was only able to say,&quot;... ok kid ...&quot;. The Red Sox went on to win the game 5–3, thanks to a two-run home run by Williams in the seventh inning.

In August 1953, Williams practiced with the Red Sox for ten days before playing in his first game, garnering a large ovation from the crowd and hitting a home run in the eighth inning. In the season, Williams ended up hitting .407 with 13 home runs and 34 RBIs in 37 games and 110 at bats (not nearly enough plate appearances to qualify for that season&#x27;s batting title). On September 6, Williams hit his 332nd career home run, passing Hank Greenberg for seventh all-time.

On the first day of spring training in 1954, Williams broke his collarbone running after a line drive. Williams was out for six weeks, and in April he wrote an article with Joe Reichler of the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; saying that he intended to retire at the end of the season. Williams returned to the Red Sox lineup on May 7, and he hit .345 with 29 home runs and 89 RBI across 386 at bats in 117 games, although Bobby Ávila, who had hit .341, won the batting championship. This was because it was required then that a batter needed 400 at bats, despite Lou Boudreau&#x27;s attempt to bat Williams second in the lineup to get more at-bats. Williams led the league in base on balls with 136 which kept him from qualifying under the rules at the time. By today&#x27;s standards (plate appearances) he would have been the champion. The rule was changed shortly thereafter to keep this from happening again. On August 25, Williams passed Johnny Mize for sixth place, and on September 3, Williams passed Joe DiMaggio for fifth all-time in career home runs with his 362nd career home run. He finished the season with 366 career home runs. On September 26, Williams &quot;retired&quot; after the Red Sox&#x27;s final game of the season.

During the off-season of 1954, Williams was offered the chance to be manager of the Red Sox. Williams declined, and he suggested that Pinky Higgins, who had previously played on the 1946 Red Sox team as the third baseman, become the manager of the team. Higgins later was hired as the Red Sox manager in 1955. Williams sat out the first month of the 1955 season due to a divorce settlement with his wife, Doris. When Williams returned, he signed a $98,000 contract on May 13. Williams batted .356 in 320 at bats on the season, hitting 28 home runs and driving in 83 runs in 98 games. For his performance, he was named the &quot;Comeback Player of the Year.&quot;

====1956–1960====
On July 17 1956, Williams became the fifth player to hit 400 home runs, following Mel Ott in 1941, Jimmie Foxx in 1938, Lou Gehrig in 1936, and Babe Ruth in 1927. Three weeks later at home against the Yankees on August 7, after Williams was booed for dropping a fly ball from Mickey Mantle, he spat at one of the fans who was taunting him on the top of the dugout; Williams was fined $5,000 for the incident. The following night against Baltimore, Williams was greeted by a large ovation, and received an even larger one when he hit a home run in the sixth inning to break a 2–2 tie. In the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, the publishers ran a &quot;What Globe Readers Say About Ted&quot; section made out of letters about Williams, which were either the sportswriters or the &quot;loud mouths&quot; in the stands. Williams explained years later, &quot;From &#x27;56 on, I realized that people were for me. The writers had written that the fans should show me they didn&#x27;t want me, and I got the biggest ovation yet&quot;. Williams lost the batting title to Mickey Mantle in 1956, batting .345 to Mantle&#x27;s .353, with Mantle on his way to winning the Triple Crown.

In 1957, Williams batted .388 to lead the majors, then signed a contract in February 1958 for a record high $125,000 (or $135,000). At age forty that season, he again led the American League with a .328 batting average, and also hit 26 home runs and 85 RBI in 129 games.

When Pumpsie Green became the first black player on the Red Sox—the last major league team to integrate—in 1959, Williams openly welcomed Green.

Williams ended his career with a home run in his last at-bat on September 28, 1960. He refused to salute the fans as he returned to the dugout after he crossed home plate or after he was replaced in left field by Carroll Hardy. An essay written by John Updike the following month for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu&quot;, chronicles this event.

==Career overall==
At the time of his retirement, Williams ranked third all-time in home runs (behind Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx), seventh in RBIs (after Ruth, Cap Anson, Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, Foxx, and Mel Ott), and seventh in batting average (behind Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Lefty O&#x27;Doul, Ed Delahanty and Tris Speaker). His career batting average of .3444 is the highest of any player who played his entire career in the live-ball era following 1920.

Most modern statistical analyses place Williams, along with Ruth and Barry Bonds, among the three most potent hitters to have played the game. Williams&#x27; baseball season of 1941 is often considered favorably with the greatest seasons of Ruth and Bonds in terms of various offensive statistical measures such as slugging, on-base and &quot;offensive winning percentage.&quot; As a further indication, of the ten best seasons for &quot;OPS&quot;, short for &quot;On-Base Plus Slugging Percentage&quot;, a popular modern measure of offensive productivity, four each were achieved by Ruth and Bonds, and two by Williams.

Williams is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League games in four decades.

==Player profile==
===Playing style===
Williams was an obsessive student of hitting. He famously used a lighter bat than most sluggers, because it generated a faster swing. In 1970, he wrote a book on the subject, &quot;The Science of Hitting&quot; (revised 1986), which is still read by many baseball players. The book describes his theory of swinging only at pitches that came into ideal areas of his strike zone, a strategy Williams credited with his success as a hitter; as a result, Williams&#x27; bases-on-balls-to-plate-appearances ratio (.2065) is the highest of any player in the Hall of Fame.

Williams nearly always took the first pitch.

He helped pass his expertise of playing left-field in front of the Green Monster to his successor on the Red Sox, Carl Yastrzemski.

===Relationship with Boston media and fans===
Williams was on uncomfortable terms with the Boston newspapers for nearly twenty years, as he felt they liked to discuss his personal life as much as his baseball performance. He maintained a career-long feud with &quot;Sport&quot; due to a 1948 feature article in which the reporter included a quote from Williams&#x27; mother. Insecure about his upbringing, and stubborn because of immense confidence in his own talent, Williams made up his mind that the &quot;knights of the keyboard&quot;, as he derisively labeled the press, were against him. After having hit for the league&#x27;s Triple Crown in 1947, Williams narrowly lost the MVP award in a vote where one Midwestern newspaper writer left Williams entirely off his ten-player ballot.

During his career, some sportswriters also criticized aspects of Williams&#x27; baseball performance, including what they viewed as his lackadaisical fielding and lack of clutch hitting. Williams pushed back, saying: &quot;They&#x27;re always saying that I don&#x27;t hit in the clutches. Well, there are a lot [of games] when I do.&quot; He also asserted that it made no sense crashing into an outfield wall to try to make a difficult catch because of the risk of injury or being out of position to make the play after missing the ball.

Williams treated most of the press accordingly, as he described in his 1969 memoir &quot;My Turn at Bat&quot;. Williams also had an uneasy relationship with the Boston fans, though he could be very cordial one-to-one. He felt at times a good deal of gratitude for their passion and their knowledge of the game. On the other hand, Williams was temperamental, high-strung, and at times tactless. In his biography, Ronald Reis relates how Williams committed two fielding miscues in a doubleheader in 1950 and was roundly booed by Boston fans. He bowed three times to various sections of Fenway Park and made an obscene gesture. When he came to bat he spat in the direction of fans near the dugout. The incident caused an avalanche of negative media reaction, and inspired sportswriter Austen Lake&#x27;s famous comment that when Williams&#x27; name was announced the sound was like &quot;autumn wind moaning through an apple orchard.&quot;

Another incident occurred in 1958 in a game against the Washington Senators. Williams struck out, and as he stepped from the batter&#x27;s box swung his bat violently in anger. The bat slipped from his hands, was launched into the stands and struck a 60-year-old woman who turned out to be the housekeeper of the Red Sox general manager Joe Cronin. While the incident was an accident and Williams apologized to the woman personally, to all appearances it seemed at the time that Williams had hurled the bat in a fit of temper.

Williams gave generously to those in need. He was especially linked with the Jimmy Fund of the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, which provides support for children&#x27;s cancer research and treatment. Williams used his celebrity to virtually launch the fund, which raised more than $750 million between 1948 and 2010. Throughout his career, Williams made countless bedside visits to children being treated for cancer, which Williams insisted go unreported. Often parents of sick children would learn at check-out time that &quot;Mr. Williams has taken care of your bill&quot;. The Fund recently stated that &quot;Williams would travel everywhere and anywhere, no strings or paychecks attached, to support the cause... His name is synonymous with our battle against all forms of cancer.&quot;

Williams demanded loyalty from those around him. He could not forgive the fickle nature of the fans—booing a player for booting a ground ball, and then turning around and roaring approval of the same player for hitting a home run. Despite the cheers and adulation of most of his fans, the occasional boos directed at him in Fenway Park led Williams to stop tipping his cap in acknowledgment after a home run.

Williams maintained this policy up to and including his swan song in 1960. After hitting a home run at Fenway Park, which would be his last career at-bat, Williams characteristically refused either to tip his cap as he circled the bases or to respond to prolonged cheers of &quot;We want Ted!&quot; from the crowd by making an appearance from the dugout. The Boston manager Pinky Higgins sent Williams to his fielding position in left field to start the ninth inning, but then immediately recalled him for his back-up Carroll Hardy, thus allowing Williams to receive one last ovation as he jogged onto then off the field, and he did so without reacting to the crowd. Williams&#x27; aloof attitude led the writer John Updike to observe wryly that &quot;Gods do not answer letters.&quot;

Williams&#x27; final home run did not take place during the final game of the 1960 season, but rather in the Red Sox&#x27;s last home game that year. The Red Sox played three more games, but they were on the road in New York City and Williams did not appear in any of them, as it became clear that Williams&#x27; final home at-bat would be the last one of his career.

In 1991, on Ted Williams Day at Fenway Park, Williams pulled a Red Sox cap from out of his jacket and tipped it to the crowd. This was the first time that he had done so since his earliest days as a player.

Williams once had a friendship with Ty Cobb, with whom he often had discussions about baseball. He often touted Rogers Hornsby as being the greatest right-handed hitter of all time. In Al Stump&#x27;s now discredited biography about Cobb, he claimed that this assertion actually led to a split in the relationship between Cobb and Williams. Once during one of their yearly debate sessions on the greatest hitters of all time, Williams asserted that Hornsby was one of the greatest of all time. Cobb apparently had strong feelings about Hornsby and he threw a fit, expelling Williams from his hotel room. However, this story was later refuted by Williams himself.

==Military service==
===World War II===

Williams served as a Naval Aviator during World War II and the Korean War. Unlike many other major league players, he did not spend all of his war-time playing on service teams. Williams had been classified 3-A by Selective Service prior to the war, a dependency deferment because he was his mother&#x27;s sole means of financial support. When his classification was changed to 1-A following the American entry into World War II, Williams appealed to his local draft board. The draft board ruled that his draft status should not have been changed. He made a public statement that once he had built up his mother&#x27;s trust fund, he intended to enlist. Even so, criticism in the media, including withdrawal of an endorsement contract by Quaker Oats, resulted in his enlistment in the U.S. Naval Reserve on May 22, 1942.

Williams did not opt for an easy assignment playing baseball for the Navy, but rather joined the V-5 program to become a Naval aviator. Williams was first sent to the Navy&#x27;s Preliminary Ground School at Amherst College for six months of academic instruction in various subjects including math and navigation, where he achieved a 3.85 grade point average.

Williams was talented as a pilot, and so enjoyed it that he had to be ordered by the Navy to leave training to personally accept his American League 1942 Major League Baseball Triple Crown. Williams&#x27; Red Sox teammate, Johnny Pesky, who went into the same aviation training program, said this about Williams: &quot;He mastered intricate problems in fifteen minutes which took the average cadet an hour, and half of the other cadets there were college grads.&quot; Pesky again described Williams&#x27; acumen in the advanced training, for which Pesky personally did not qualify: &quot;I heard Ted literally tore the sleeve target to shreds with his angle dives. He&#x27;d shoot from wingovers, zooms, and barrel rolls, and after a few passes the sleeve was ribbons. At any rate, I know he broke the all-time record for hits.&quot; Ted went to Jacksonville for a course in aerial gunnery, the combat pilot&#x27;s payoff test, and broke all the records in reflexes, coordination, and visual-reaction time. &quot;From what I heard. Ted could make a plane and its six &#x27;pianos&#x27; (machine guns) play like a symphony orchestra&quot;, Pesky says. &quot;From what they said, his reflexes, coordination, and visual reaction made him a built-in part of the machine.&quot;

Williams completed pre-flight training in Athens, Georgia, his primary training at NAS Bunker Hill, Indiana, and his advanced flight training at NAS Pensacola. He received his gold Naval Aviator wings and his commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps on May 2, 1944.

Williams served as a flight instructor at NAS Pensacola teaching young pilots to fly the complicated F4U Corsair fighter plane. Williams was in Pearl Harbor awaiting orders to join the Fleet in the Western Pacific when the War in the Pacific ended. He finished the war in Hawaii, and then he was released from active duty on January 12, 1946, but he did remain in the Marine Corps Reserve.

===Korean War===

On May 1, 1952, 14 months after his promotion to captain in the Marine Corps Reserve, Williams was recalled to active duty for service in the Korean War. He had not flown any aircraft for eight years but he turned down all offers to sit out the war in comfort as a member of a service baseball team. Nevertheless, Williams was resentful of being called up, which he admitted years later, particularly regarding the Navy&#x27;s policy of calling up Inactive Reservists rather than members of the Active Reserve.

Williams reported for duty on May 2, 1952. After eight weeks of refresher flight training and qualification in the F9F Panther jet fighter with VMF-223 at the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, Williams was assigned to VMF-311, Marine Aircraft Group 33 (MAG-33), based at the K-3 airfield in Pohang, South Korea.

On February 16, 1953, Williams, flying as the wingman for John Glenn (later an astronaut, then U.S. Senator), was part of a 35-plane raid against a tank and infantry training school just south of Pyongyang, North Korea. As the aircraft from VMF-115 and VMF-311 dove on the target, Williams&#x27; plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire, a piece of flak knocked out his hydraulics and electrical systems, causing Williams to have to &quot;limp&quot; his plane back to K-3 air base where he made a belly landing. For his actions of this day, he was awarded the Air Medal.

Williams flew 39 combat missions in Korea, earning the Air Medal with two Gold Stars representing second and third awards, before being withdrawn from flight status in June 1953 after a hospitalization for pneumonia. This resulted in the discovery of an inner ear infection that disqualified him from flight status. John Glenn described Williams as one of the best pilots he knew. In the last half of his missions, Williams was flying as Glenn&#x27;s wingman.

Williams likely would have exceeded 600 career home runs if he had not served in the military, and might even have approached Babe Ruth&#x27;s then record of 714. He might have set the record for career RBIs as well, exceeding Hank Aaron&#x27;s total. While the absences in the Marine Corps took almost five years out of his baseball career, he never publicly complained about the time devoted to service in the Marine Corps. His biographer, Leigh Montville, argued that Williams was not happy about being pressed into service in South Korea, but he did what he thought was his patriotic duty.

Following his return to the United States in August 1953, he resigned his Reserve commission to resume his baseball career.

==Post-retirement==
After retirement from play, Williams helped Boston&#x27;s new left fielder, Carl Yastrzemski, in hitting, and was a regular visitor to the Red Sox&#x27; spring training camps from 1961 to 1966, where he worked as a special batting instructor. He served as executive assistant to Tom Yawkey (1961–65), then was named a team vice president (1965–68) upon his election to the Hall of Fame. He resumed his spring training instruction role with the club in 1978.

Beginning in 1961, he would spend summers at the Ted Williams Baseball Camp in Lakeville, Massachusetts, which he had established in 1958 with his friend Al Cassidy and two other business partners. For eight summers and parts of others after that, he would give hitting clinics and talk baseball at the camp. It was not uncommon to find Williams fishing in the pond at the camp. The area now is owned by the town and a few of the buildings still stand. In the main lodge one can still see memorabilia from Williams&#x27; playing days.

Williams served as manager of the Washington Senators, from 1969–1971, then continued with the team when they became the Texas Rangers after the 1971 season. Williams&#x27; best season as a manager was 1969 when he led the expansion Senators to an 86–76 record in the team&#x27;s only winning season in Washington. He was chosen &quot;Manager of the Year&quot; after that season. Like many great players, Williams became impatient with ordinary athletes&#x27; abilities and attitudes, particularly those of pitchers, whom he admitted he never respected. Fellow manager Alvin Dark thought Williams &quot;was a smart, fearless manager&quot; who helped his hitters perform better. Williams&#x27; issue with Washington/Texas, according to Dark, was when the ownership traded away his third baseman and shortstop, making it difficult for the club to be as competitive.

On the subject of pitchers, in Ted&#x27;s autobiography written with John Underwood, Ted opines regarding Bob Lemon (a sinker-ball specialist) pitching for the Cleveland Indians around 1951: &quot;I have to rate Lemon as one of the very best pitchers I ever faced. His ball was always moving, hard, sinking, fast-breaking. You could never really uhmmmph with Lemon.&quot;

Williams was much more successful in fishing. An avid and expert fly fisherman and deep-sea fisherman, he spent many summers after baseball fishing the Miramichi River, in Miramichi, New Brunswick. Williams was named to the International Game Fish Association Hall of Fame in 2000. Williams, Jim Brown, Cumberland Posey, and Cal Hubbard are the only athletes to be inducted into the Halls of Fame of more than one professional sport. Williams was also known as an accomplished hunter; he was fond of pigeon-shooting for sport in Fenway Park during his career, on one occasion drawing the ire of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Williams reached an extensive deal with Sears, lending his name and talent toward marketing, developing, and endorsing a line of in-house sports equipment—such as the &quot;Ted Williams&quot; edition Gamefisher aluminum boat and 7.5 hp &quot;Ted Williams&quot; edition motor, as well as fishing, hunting, and baseball equipment. Williams continued his involvement in the Jimmy Fund, later losing a brother to leukemia, and spending much of his spare time, effort, and money in support of the cancer organization.

In his later years, Williams became a fixture at autograph shows and card shows after his son (by his third wife), John Henry Williams, took control of his career, becoming his de facto manager. The younger Williams provided structure to his father&#x27;s business affairs, exposed forgeries that were flooding the memorabilia market, and rationed his father&#x27;s public appearances and memorabilia signings to maximize their earnings.

One of Williams&#x27; final, and most memorable, public appearances was at the 1999 All-Star Game in Boston. Able to walk only a short distance, Williams was brought to the pitcher&#x27;s mound in a golf cart. He proudly waved his cap to the crowd—a gesture he had never done as a player. Fans responded with a standing ovation that lasted several minutes. At the pitcher&#x27;s mound he was surrounded by players from both teams, including fellow Red Sox player Nomar Garciaparra, and was assisted by Tony Gwynn in throwing out the first pitch of that year&#x27;s All-Star Game. Later in the year, he was among the members of the Major League Baseball All-Century Team introduced to the crowd at Turner Field in Atlanta prior to Game 2 of the World Series.

==Personal life==

On May 4, 1944, Williams married Doris Soule, the daughter of his hunting guide. Their daughter, Barbara Joyce (&quot;Bobby-Jo&quot;), was born on January 28, 1948, while Williams was fishing in Florida. They divorced in 1954. Williams married the socialite model Lee Howard on September 10, 1961, and they were divorced in 1967.

Williams married Dolores Wettach, a former Miss Vermont and &quot;Vogue&quot; model, in 1968. Their son John-Henry was born on August 27, 1968, followed by daughter Claudia, on October 8, 1971. They were divorced in 1972.

Williams lived with Louise Kaufman for twenty years until her death in 1993. In his book, Cramer called her the love of Williams&#x27; life. After his death, her sons filed suit to recover her furniture from Williams&#x27; condominium as well as a half-interest in the condominium they claimed he gave her.

Williams had a strong respect for General Douglas MacArthur, referring to him as his &quot;idol&quot;. For Williams&#x27; 40th birthday, MacArthur sent him an oil painting of himself with the inscription &quot;To Ted Williams—not only America&#x27;s greatest baseball player, but a great American who served his country. Your friend, Douglas MacArthur. General U.S. Army.&quot;

Politically, Williams was a Republican, and was described by one biographer as, &quot;to the right of Attila the Hun&quot; except when it came to civil rights. Another writer similarly noted that while in the 1960s he had a liberal attitude on civil rights, he was pretty far right on other cultural issues of the time, calling him &quot;ultraconservative in the tradition of Barry Goldwater and John Wayne”.
Williams campaigned for Richard Nixon in the 1960 United States Presidential Election, and after Nixon lost to John F. Kennedy, refused several invitations from President Kennedy to gather together in Cape Cod. He supported Nixon again in 1968, and as manager of the Senators, kept a picture of him on his desk, meeting with the President several times while managing the team. In 1972 he called Nixon, &quot;the greatest president of my lifetime&quot;. In the following years, Williams endorsed several other candidates in Republican Party presidential primaries, including George H. W. Bush in 1988 (whom he also campaigned for in New Hampshire), Bob Dole in 1996, and George W. Bush in 2000.

Williams was called an atheist by several biographers, though Williams disproved this in his autobiography by stating that he did believe in God. He was raised in a Christian household but did not publicly emphasize his religious beliefs throughout his life. He often described himself as a spiritual person. His experiences during World War II, particularly his time as a Marine pilot, may have influenced his views on life and faith. In numerous interviews and his autobiography, Williams refers to God and his strained relationship with theism due to his mother&#x27;s constant work with the church. As quoted in his autobiography &quot;My Turn at Bat&quot;, Williams stated: &quot;I have a God given talent. God gets you to the plate, but it&#x27;s up to you what happens when you get there&quot;. He concludes his sentiment later with &quot;I&#x27;m not a religious man, but I do believe in God. I believe that he has given me a gift, and I try to use it as best I can.&quot;

Williams&#x27; brother Danny and his son John-Henry both died of leukemia.

==Death==

In his last years, Williams suffered from cardiomyopathy. He had a pacemaker implanted in November 2000 and he underwent open-heart surgery in January 2001. After suffering a series of strokes and congestive heart failure, he died of cardiac arrest at the age of 83 on July 5, 2002, at Citrus Memorial Hospital, Inverness, Florida, near his home in Citrus Hills, Florida.

Though his will stated his desire to be cremated and his ashes scattered in the Florida Keys, Williams&#x27; son John-Henry and younger daughter Claudia chose to have his remains frozen cryonically.

Ted&#x27;s elder daughter, Bobby-Jo Ferrell, brought a suit to have her father&#x27;s wishes recognized. John-Henry&#x27;s lawyer then produced an informal &quot;family pact&quot; signed by Ted, Claudia, and John-Henry, in which they agreed &quot;to be put into biostasis after we die&quot; to &quot;be able to be together in the future, even if it is only a chance.&quot; Bobby-Jo and her attorney, Spike Fitzpatrick (former attorney of Ted Williams), contended that the family pact, which was scribbled on an ink-stained napkin, was forged by John-Henry and/or Claudia. Fitzpatrick and Ferrell believed that the signature was not obtained legally. Laboratory analysis proved that the signature was genuine. John-Henry said that his father was a believer in science and was willing to try cryonics if it held the possibility of reuniting the family.

Though the family pact upset some friends, family and fans, a public plea for financial support of the lawsuit by Ferrell produced little result. Citing financial difficulties, Ferrell dropped her lawsuit on the condition that a $645,000 trust fund left by Williams would immediately pay the sum out equally to the three children.

In &quot;Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero&quot;, author Leigh Montville claims that the family cryonics pact was a practice Ted Williams autograph on a plain piece of paper, around which the agreement had later been handwritten. The pact document was signed &quot;&quot;Ted Williams&quot;, the same as his autographs, whereas he would always sign his legal documents &quot;Theodore Williams&quot;&quot;, according to Montville. However, his daughter Claudia who was part of the pact with John Henry, testified to the authenticity of the document in an affidavit.

Williams&#x27; body was subsequently decapitated for the neuropreservation option from Alcor. Following John-Henry&#x27;s unexpected illness and death from acute myeloid leukemia on March 6, 2004, John-Henry&#x27;s body was also transported to Alcor, in fulfillment of the family agreement.

==Awards and recognition==

In 1954, Williams was inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego&#x27;s finest athletes both on and off the playing surface. In 2002, he was elected to the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame.

In 1999, Williams was ranked as number 8 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, where he was the highest-ranking left fielder. That same year, he was one of 30 players elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Williams at number 6 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski. In 2022, as part of their SN Rushmore project, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named Williams on their &quot;Boston Mount Rushmore of Sports&quot;, along Boston Celtics basketball player Bill Russell, Boston Bruins hockey player Bobby Orr, and New England Patriots football player Tom Brady.

Williams was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 25, 1966. In his induction speech, Williams included a statement calling for the recognition of the great Negro leagues players: &quot;I&#x27;ve been a very lucky guy to have worn a baseball uniform, and I hope some day the names of Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson in some way can be added as a symbol of the great Negro players who are not here only because they weren&#x27;t given a chance.&quot; Williams was referring to two of the most famous names in the Negro leagues, who were not given the opportunity to play in the Major Leagues before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947. Gibson died early in 1947 and thus never played in the majors; and Paige&#x27;s brief major league stint came long past his prime as a player. This statement from the Hall of Fame podium was &quot;a first crack in the door that ultimately would open and include Paige and Gibson and other Negro league stars in the shrine.&quot; Paige was the first inducted in 1971. Gibson and others followed, starting in 1972 and continued on and off into the 21st century.

On November 18, 1991, President George H. W. Bush presented Williams with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States.

The Ted Williams Tunnel in Boston, Massachusetts, carrying of the final of Interstate 90 under Boston Harbor, opened in December 1995, and Ted Williams Parkway (California State Route 56) in San Diego County, California, opened in 1992, were named in his honor while he was still alive. In 2016, the major league San Diego Padres inducted Williams into their hall of fame for his contributions to baseball in San Diego.

Outside Fenway Park, there are two statues of honoring Williams. The first was unveiled in 2004, depicting him placing his cap on the head of a young boy. The second was &quot;The Teammates&quot; statue, unveiled in 2010, where he is depicted alongside teammate and friends: Bobby Doerr, Dom DiMaggio, and Johnny Pesky.

The Tampa Bay Rays home field, Tropicana Field, installed the Ted Williams Museum (formerly in Hernando, Florida, 1994–2006) behind the left field fence. From the Tampa Bay Rays website: &quot;The Ted Williams Museum and Hitters Hall of Fame brings a special element to the Tropicana Field. Fans can view an array of different artifacts and pictures of the &#x27;Greatest hitter that ever lived.&#x27; These memorable displays range from Ted Williams&#x27; days in the military through his professional playing career. This museum is dedicated to some of the greatest players to ever &#x27;lace &#x27;em up,&#x27; including Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris.&quot;

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Williams as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Marine Corps during World War II.

<text>The Slits were a post-punk/punk rock band based in London, formed there in 1976 by members of the groups the Flowers of Romance and the Castrators. The group&#x27;s early line-up consisted of Ari Up (Ariane Forster) and Palmolive (a.k.a. Paloma Romero, who played briefly with Spizzenergi and later left to join the Raincoats), with Viv Albertine and Tessa Pollitt replacing founding members Kate Korus and Suzy Gutsy. Their 1979 debut album, &quot;Cut&quot;, has been called one of the defining releases of the post-punk era.

==Career==
===1976–1982===
The Slits formed in October 1976 when Ari Up went to a Patti Smith gig at the Hammersmith Odeon in London. After having an argument with her mother, Ari was approached by Palmolive and Kate Korus with the offer to form a band. The next day they had their first rehearsal.

The group supported the Clash on their 1977 &quot;White Riot&quot; tour along with Buzzcocks, the Jam, the Prefects and Subway Sect. Club performances of the Slits during this period are included in &quot;The Punk Rock Movie&quot; (1978). In November 1978, the Slits toured with the Clash again on the &quot;Sort it Out Tour&quot; and were joined by the Innocents who opened the shows. Joe Strummer said the group would be &quot;great&quot; with intense gigging.

Palmolive left the band in 1978 and debuted with the Raincoats on 4 January 1979. She was replaced by the drummer Budgie (Peter Clarke), formerly of the Spitfire Boys and later of Siouxsie and the Banshees. With the change of drummer came a change of musical style. The Slits&#x27; originally raw, raucous and drum-dominated live sound, as captured on two Peel Sessions in 1977 and 1978, was cleaned up and polished to a more bass-orientated sound with the Budgie line up, and their new style drew heavily from reggae, dub and world music.
Their Dennis Bovell-produced debut album &quot;Cut&quot; was released in September 1979 on Island Records, with Neneh Cherry joining as additional backing vocalist. The album&#x27;s sleeve art depicted the band naked, except for mud and loincloths. It is often claimed that Palmolive left partly because she did not like the album artwork, including by Palmolive herself, but Viv Albertine has stated that Palmolive had been asked to leave the band several months previously, and she does not appear on the record.

The Slits&#x27; sound and attitude became increasingly experimental and avant-garde during the early 1980s, when they formed an alliance with Bristol post-punk band the Pop Group, sharing drummer Bruce Smith and releasing a joint single, &quot;In the Beginning There Was Rhythm / Where There&#x27;s a Will...&quot; (Y Records). This was followed by an untitled compilation album of mostly homemade demos and live performances from before the release of &quot;Cut&quot;. The band toured widely and released their second studio album, &quot;Return of the Giant Slits&quot;, before breaking up in early 1982. Ari Up went on to be part of the New Age Steppers.

===2005–2010===
Ari Up and Tessa Pollitt reformed the band with new members in 2005, as Viv Albertine was unwilling to rejoin, and in 2006 released the EP &quot;Revenge of the Killer Slits&quot;. The EP featured former Sex Pistols member Paul Cook and former Adam and the Ants members Chris Constantinou and Marco Pirroni as both musicians and co-producers. Cook&#x27;s daughter Hollie played with the band, singing and playing keyboards. Other members of the reformed band were No (of the Home Office) on guitar, German drummer Anna Schulte, and Adele Wilson on guitar.

The band toured the United States for the first time in twenty-five years during 2006&#x27;s &#x27;States of Mind&#x27; tour, and followed this with tours of Australia and Japan, as well as opening for Sonic Youth at New York&#x27;s McCarren Park Pool. Adele Wilson and No left the band, to be replaced by American guitarist Michelle Hill. A biography – &quot;Typical Girls? The Story of the Slits&quot; by Zoë Street Howe was published in the UK by Omnibus Press in July 2009, and the band&#x27;s third full-length album entitled &quot;Trapped Animal&quot; was released three months later. 

Founding member Ari Up died in Los Angeles in October 2010 at the age of 48. The band&#x27;s final work, the video for the song &quot;Lazy Slam&quot; from &quot;Trapped Animal&quot;, was released posthumously according to Ari Up&#x27;s wishes. A final song, the unreleased 1981 recording &quot;Coulda Woulda Shoulda&quot;, was due to be released in early 2011.

<text>Turners (, ) are members of German-American gymnastic clubs called Turnvereine. They promoted German culture, physical culture, and liberal politics. Turners, especially Francis Lieber (1798–1872), were the leading sponsors of gymnastics as an American sport and the field of academic study.

In Germany, a major gymnastic movement was started by &quot;Turnvater&quot; (&quot;father of gymnastics&quot;) and nationalist Friedrich Ludwig Jahn in the early 19th century when Germany was occupied by Napoleon. The &quot;Turnvereine&quot; (; &quot;gymnastic unions&quot;; from German &quot;turnen&quot; meaning “to practice gymnastics,” and &quot;Verein&quot; meaning “club, union”) were not only athletic but also political, reflecting their origin in similar ethnocentric &quot;national gymnastic&quot; organizations in Europe (such as the Czech Sokol), who were participants in various national movements for independence. The Turner movement in Germany was generally liberal in nature, and many Turners took part in the Revolutions of 1848.

After the failure of the 1848 Revolution in Germany, the Turner movement was suppressed, and many Turners left Germany, some emigrating to the United States, especially to the Ohio Valley region, Wisconsin, Missouri, and Texas. Several of these Forty-Eighters went on to become Union soldiers, and some became Republican politicians. Besides serving as physical education, social, political, and cultural organizations for German immigrants, Turners were also active in public education and labor movements. They were leading promoters of gymnastics in the United States as a sport and as a school subject. In the United States, the movement declined after 1900, and especially after 1917.

== History in the United States ==
The Turner movement was preceded by the first wave of gymnastics in the United States in the 1820s, led by Germans, such as Charles Beck and Charles Follen, and Americans, such as John Neal. Beck opened the first gymnasium in the U.S. in 1825 at the Round Hill School in Northampton, Massachusetts. Follen opened the first college gymnasium and the first public gymnasium in the States in 1826 at Harvard College and in Boston, Massachusetts, respectively. Neal was the first American to open a public gymnasium in the U.S. in Portland, Maine in 1827. He also documented and promoted these early efforts in the &quot;American Journal of Education&quot; and &quot;The Yankee&quot;, helping to establish the American branch of the movement.

The &quot;Turnvereine&quot; made a contribution to the integration of German-Americans into their new home. The organizations continue to exist in areas of heavy German immigration, such as Iowa, Texas, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Missouri, Syracuse, New York, Kentucky, New York City, Sacramento, and Los Angeles.

About 1000 Turners served as Union soldiers during the Civil War. Anti-slavery was a common element, as typified by Carl Schurz. Many Republican leaders in German communities were members. They provided the bodyguard at Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s inauguration on March 4, 1861, and at his funeral in April 1865. In the Camp Jackson Affair, a large force of German volunteers helped prevent Confederate forces from seizing the government arsenal in St. Louis just prior to the beginning of the war. After the Civil War, the national organization took a new name, &quot;Nordamerikanischer Turnerbund&quot;, and supported German-language teaching in public high schools, as well as gymnastics. Women&#x27;s auxiliaries were formed in the 1850s and 1860s. The high point in membership came in 1894, with 317 societies and about 40,000 adult male members, along with 25,000 children and 3000 women.

In the 1904 Olympics several competitors represented various Turners organizations in Missouri, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York, and some of the teams at the Olympics were sponsored by Turners organizations.

Like other German-American groups, the Turners experienced suspicion during World War I, even though they now had very little contact with Germany. German-language instruction ended at many schools and universities, and the federal government imposed restrictions on German-language publications. The younger generation generally demanded the switch to the exclusive use of English society affairs, which allowed many Turner societies to continue to function.

Cultural assimilation and both World Wars with Germany took a gradual toll on membership, with some halls closing and others becoming regular dance halls, bars, or bowling alleys. As of 2011, 54 Turner societies still existed around the U.S. The current headquarters of American Turners is in Louisville, Kentucky.

In 1948, the US Post Office issued a 3-cent commemorative stamp to mark the 100th anniversary of the movement in the country.

The Turnverein in Sacramento, founded in 1854, claims to be the oldest institution within the city still in existence. The Turnverein Vorwaerts of Fort Wayne, Indiana, owned the Hugh McCulloch House from 1906 until 1966. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Starting in 2022, Burton has directed several episodes for the Netflix series &quot;Wednesday&quot;, for which he received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series. He also directed &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot; (2024), the sequel to the 1988 film. Burton has frequently collaborated with composer Danny Elfman, who scored all but three of his films. He has released several books including &quot;The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy &amp; Other Stories&quot; (1997).

==Early life and education ==
Timothy Walter Burton was born on August 25, 1958, in Burbank, California, the son of Jean Burton (née Erickson), who in the 1980s was the owner of a cat-themed gift shop, and William &quot;Bill&quot; Burton, a former minor league baseball player, who worked for many years for the Burbank Parks and Recreation Department. The baseball field at Olive Recreation Center in Burbank, California is named for Bill Burton.

As a preteen, Burton made short films in his backyard at 2101 North Evergreen Street, using crude stop motion animation techniques or shooting on 8 mm film without sound (one of his oldest known juvenile films is &quot;The Island of Doctor Agor&quot;, adapted from the H. G. Wells novel &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot;, which he made when he was 13 years old). Burton attended Providencia Elementary School, Luther Burbank Middle School, and Burbank High School, but was not a particularly good student. He played on the water polo team at Burbank High. Burton was an introspective person and found pleasure in artwork, painting, drawing, and watching movies. His future work would be heavily influenced by the books of such childhood heroes as Dr. Seuss and Roald Dahl,
and of the visual aesthetics of silent gothic horror films, Universal Monsters movies such as &quot;Frankenstein&quot; which he would continuously tribute throughout his career, Hammer Horror films starring Christopher Lee and the horror films of Vincent Price, both of whom would star in his films, and with the latter being paid tribute in his 1982 short film &quot;Vincent&quot;. In a &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; article, Burton states: “I grew up watching the Universal horror movies, Japanese monster movies, and pretty much any kind of monster movie. That was my genre.” Burton also said that his love of Ray Harryhausen’s work got him interested in stop-motion animation at a young age.

After graduating from Burbank High School in 1976, Burton attended the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, Santa Clarita, to study character animation, until 1979. As a student at CalArts, Burton made the shorts &quot;Stalk of the Celery Monster&quot; and &quot;King and Octopus&quot;.

==Career==
===1981–1987: Early work and breakthrough ===
&quot;Stalk of the Celery Monster&quot; attracted the attention of Walt Disney Productions, who offered Burton an animator&#x27;s apprenticeship at its animation division. He worked as an animator, storyboard artist, graphic designer, art director, and concept artist on films such as &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot; (1981), &quot;Tron&quot; (1982), and &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; (1985). His concept art never made it into the finished films.

While at Disney in 1982, Burton made his first short, &quot;Vincent&quot;, a six-minute black-and-white stop motion film based on a poem written by Burton, which depicts a young boy who fantasizes that he is his hero Vincent Price, with Price himself providing narration. The film was produced by Rick Heinrichs, whom Burton had befriended while working in the concept art department at Disney. The film was shown at the Chicago Film Festival and released, alongside the teen drama &quot;Tex&quot;, for two weeks in one Los Angeles cinema. This was followed by Burton&#x27;s first live-action production, &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, a Japanese-themed adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale for the Disney Channel, which climaxes in a kung fu fight between Hansel and Gretel and the witch. Having aired once in 1983 at 10:30 P.M. on Halloween and promptly shelved, prints of the film are extremely difficult to locate, fueling rumors that the project did not exist. The short would finally go on public display in 2009 at the Museum of Modern Art, and again in 2011 as part of the Tim Burton art exhibit at LACMA. It was again shown at the Seoul Museum of Art in 2012.

Burton&#x27;s next live-action short film, &quot;Frankenweenie&quot;, was released in 1984. It tells the story of a young boy who tries to revive his dog after it is run over by a car. Filmed in black-and-white, it stars Barret Oliver, Shelley Duvall (with whom he would work again in 1986, directing an episode of her television series &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;), and Daniel Stern. After &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; was completed, Disney fired Burton, under the pretext of him spending the company&#x27;s resources on a film that would be too dark and scary for children to see.

Actor Paul Reubens saw &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; and chose Burton to direct the cinematic spin-off of his popular character Pee-wee Herman, stating on the audio commentary of 2000 DVD release of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; that as soon as the short began, he was sold on Burton&#x27;s style. Pee-wee Herman gained mainstream popularity with a successful stage show at The Groundlings and the Roxy which was later turned into an HBO special. The film, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, was made on a budget of $8 million and grossed more than $40 million at the North American box office. Burton, a fan of the eccentric musical group Oingo Boingo, asked songwriter Danny Elfman to provide the music for the film. Since then, Elfman has scored every film that Tim Burton has directed, except for &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;, and &quot;Miss Peregrine&#x27;s Home for Peculiar Children&quot;.

Additionally, Burton directed episodes of the 1985 revival of the &#x27;50s/&#x27;60s anthology horror series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and Shelley Duvall&#x27;s &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;.

=== 1988–1994: &quot;Batman&quot; films and acclaim ===
Burton directed his next big project: &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988), a supernatural comedy horror about a young couple forced to cope with life after death and the family of pretentious yuppies who invade their treasured New England home. Their teenage daughter, Lydia (Winona Ryder), has an obsession with death which allows her to see the deceased couple. Starring Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, and featuring Michael Keaton as the obnoxious bio-exorcist Beetlejuice, the film grossed $80 million on a relatively low budget and won an Academy Award for Best Makeup. It would be converted into a cartoon of the same name, with Burton playing a role as executive producer, that ran on ABC and later Fox channel.

Burton&#x27;s ability to produce hits with low budgets impressed studio executives, and he received his first big-budget film, &quot;Batman&quot;. The production was plagued with problems. Burton repeatedly clashed with the film&#x27;s producers, Jon Peters and Peter Guber, but the most notable debacle involved casting. For the title role, Burton chose to cast Michael Keaton as Batman following their previous collaboration in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, despite Keaton&#x27;s average physique, inexperience with action films, and reputation as a comic actor. Although Burton won in the end, the furor over the casting provoked enormous fan animosity, to the extent that Warner Brothers&#x27; share price slumped. Burton had considered it ridiculous to cast a &quot;bulked-up&quot; ultra-masculine man as Batman, insisting that Batman should be an ordinary man who dressed up in an elaborate bat costume to frighten criminals. Burton originally considered Brad Dourif for The Joker, but eventually cast Jack Nicholson, in a move that helped assuage fans&#x27; fears, as well as attracting older audiences not as interested in a superhero film. When the film opened in June 1989, it was backed by the biggest marketing and merchandising campaign in film history at the time, and became one of the biggest box office hits of all time, grossing over $250 million in the U.S. and $400 million worldwide (numbers not adjusted for inflation) and earning critical acclaim for the performances of both Keaton and Nicholson, as well as the film&#x27;s production aspects, which won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction. The success of the film helped establish Burton as a profitable director, and it proved to be a huge influence on future superhero films, which eschewed the bright, all-American heroism of Richard Donner&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; for a grimmer, more realistic look and characters with more psychological depth. It also became a major inspiration for the successful 1990s cartoon &quot;&quot;, as the darkness of Burton&#x27;s film and its sequel allowed for a darker Batman on television.

Burton claimed that the graphic novel &quot;&quot; was a major influence on his film adaptation of &quot;Batman&quot;:

I was never a giant comic book fan, but I&#x27;ve always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I&#x27;ve never been a comic book fan – and I think it started when I was a child – is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don&#x27;t know if it was dyslexia or whatever, but that&#x27;s why I loved &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;, because, for the first time, I could tell which one to read. It&#x27;s my favorite. It&#x27;s the first comic I&#x27;ve ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable.

In 1990, Burton created a unique drawing which gave screenwriter Caroline Thompson inspiration to write the script for &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; which Burton directed, re-uniting with Winona Ryder from &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;. His friend Johnny Depp, a teen idol at the end of the 1980s due primarily to his work on the hit TV series &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, was cast in the title role of Edward, who was the creation of an eccentric and old-fashioned inventor (played by Vincent Price in one of his last screen appearances). Edward looked human, but was left with scissors in the place of hands due to the untimely death of his creator. Set in suburbia (and shot in Land o&#x27; Lakes, Florida), the film is largely seen as Burton&#x27;s autobiography of his childhood in Burbank. Burton&#x27;s idea for the character of Edward Scissorhands came from a drawing he created in high school. Depp wrote a similar comment in the foreword to Mark Salisbury&#x27;s book, &quot;Burton on Burton&quot;, regarding his first meeting with Burton over the casting of the film. &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; is considered one of Burton&#x27;s best movies by some critics. Burton has stated that this is his most personal and meaningful film because it is a representation of him not being able to communicate effectively with others as a teenager.

After the success of &quot;Batman&quot;, Burton agreed to direct the sequel for Warner Bros. on the condition that he would be granted total control. The result was &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, which featured Michael Keaton returning as Batman, and a new triad of villains: Danny DeVito (as the Penguin), Michelle Pfeiffer (as Catwoman) and Christopher Walken (as Max Shreck, an evil corporate tycoon and original character created for the film). Somewhat darker and considerably more personal than its predecessor, concerns were raised that the film might be too scary for children. Audiences were more uncomfortable at the film&#x27;s overt sexuality, personified by the sleek, fetish-inspired styling of Catwoman&#x27;s costume. Burton made many changes to the Penguin which would subsequently be applied to the character in both comics and television. In the comics, the penguin was an ordinary man; Burton transformed him into a freak of nature resembling a penguin with webbed, flipper-like fingers, a hooked, beak-like nose and a short, rotund body. Released in 1992, &quot;Batman Returns&quot; grossed $282.8 million worldwide, making it a financial success, though not to the extent of its predecessor.

Due to schedule constraints on &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, Burton produced, but did not direct, &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; (1993) for Disney, originally meant to be a children&#x27;s book in rhyme. The film was directed by Henry Selick and written by Caroline Thompson, based on Burton&#x27;s original story, world, and characters. The film received positive reviews for the stop motion animation, musical score, and original storyline. It was a modest box office success, grossing $50 million. Because of the nature of the film, it was not produced under Disney&#x27;s name, but rather Disney-owned Touchstone Pictures. Disney wanted the protagonist to have eyes, but the final iteration did not. Over 100 people worked on this motion picture just to create the characters, and it took three years of work to produce the film. Burton collaborated with Selick again for &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; (1996), which Burton co-produced.

In 1994, Burton and frequent co-producer Denise Di Novi produced the 1994 fantasy-comedy &quot;Cabin Boy&quot;, starring comedian Chris Elliott and directed/written by Adam Resnick. Burton was originally supposed to direct the film after seeing Elliott perform on &quot;Get a Life&quot;, but he handed the directing responsibility to Resnick once he was offered &quot;Ed Wood&quot;. Burton&#x27;s next film, &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994), was of a much smaller scale, depicting the life of the infamous director Ed Wood. Starring Johnny Depp in the title role, the film is an homage to the low-budget science fiction and horror films of Burton&#x27;s childhood and handles its comical protagonist and his motley band of collaborators with surprising fondness and sensitivity. Owing to creative squabbles during the making of &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, Danny Elfman declined to score &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, and the assignment went to Howard Shore. While a commercial failure at the time of its release, &quot;Ed Wood&quot; became a cult classic and was well received by critics. Martin Landau received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi, and the film received the Academy Award for Best Makeup.

Warner Bros. was not interested in Tim Burton&#x27;s return as director for a third Batman installment after considering &quot;Batman Returns&quot; too dark and unsafe for children. Burton noted he was unsure about returning to direct, writing: &quot;I don&#x27;t think Warner Bros. wanted me to direct a third &quot;Batman&quot;. I even said that to them.&quot; Burton and Warner Bros. mutually agreed to part ways. To attract the young audience, it was decided that Joel Schumacher, would direct the third film, whilst Burton would only produce it in conjunction with Peter MacGregor-Scott, in which Burton was given top-billing producer credit, without being able to contribute ideas; only approving director and screenplayers. Following this change and the changes made by the new director, Michael Keaton resigned from the lead role and was replaced by Val Kilmer. Filming for &quot;Batman Forever&quot; began in late 1994 with new actors: Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian, Chris O&#x27;Donnell as Dick Grayson/Robin and Jim Carrey as Edward Nygma/The Riddler; the only two actors who returned after &quot;Batman Returns&quot; were Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon and Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth. The film, a combination of the darkness that characterized the saga and colors and neon signs proposed by Schumacher, was a huge box office success, earning $336 million. Warner Bros. demanded that Schumacher delete some scenes so the film did not have the same tone as its predecessor, &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (later they were added as deleted scenes on the 2005 DVD release).

=== 1995–2010: Established director ===
In 1996, Burton and Selick reunited for the musical fantasy &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;, based on the book by Roald Dahl. Burton, once again, served only as a producer due to his contributions to making &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; (1996). The film, a combination of live action and stop motion footage, starred Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, David Thewlis, Simon Callow and Jane Leeves among others, with Selick&#x27;s animation direction. While a box office disappointment for Disney, the film was received well by critics for its story and visual aspects and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score (by Randy Newman).

Elfman and Burton reunited for &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;. Based on a popular science-fiction trading card series, the film was a hybrid of 1950s science fiction and 1970s all-star disaster films. The coincidence made it an inadvertent spoof of the blockbuster &quot;Independence Day&quot;, which had been released five months earlier. The film boasted an all-star cast, including Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Danny DeVito, Pierce Brosnan, Michael J. Fox, Sarah Jessica Parker, Natalie Portman, Lukas Haas, Martin Short, Rod Steiger, Christina Applegate, and Jack Black.

&quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, released in late 1999, had a supernatural setting and starred Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, a detective with an interest in forensic science rather than the schoolteacher of Washington Irving&#x27;s original tale. With &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, Burton paid homage to the horror films of the English company Hammer Films. Christopher Lee, one of Hammer&#x27;s stars, was given a cameo role. A host of Burton regulars appeared in supporting roles (Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones, and Christopher Walken, among others), and Christina Ricci was cast as Katrina van Tassel. A well-regarded supporting cast was headed by Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Richard Griffiths and Ian McDiarmid. Mostly well received by critics, and with a special mention to Elfman&#x27;s gothic score, the film has grossed $207 million worldwide and won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction, as well as two BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design. A box office success, &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; was also a turning point for Burton. Along with the change in his personal life (separation from actress Lisa Marie), Burton changed radically in style for his next project, leaving the haunted forests and colorful outcasts behind to go on to directing &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; which, as Burton had repeatedly noted, was &quot;not a remake&quot; of the earlier film.
&quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; was a commercial success, grossing $68 million in its opening weekend and eventually it earned $180 million in North America and $362 million worldwide. The film however has received mixed reviews and is widely considered inferior to the first adaptation of the novel. In 2003, Burton directed &quot;Big Fish&quot;, based on the novel &quot;Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions&quot; by Daniel Wallace. The film is about a father telling the story of his life to his son using exaggeration and color. Starring Ewan McGregor as young Edward Bloom and Albert Finney as an older Edward Bloom, the film also stars Jessica Lange, Billy Crudup, Danny DeVito, Alison Lohman and Marion Cotillard. &quot;Big Fish&quot; received four Golden Globe nominations as well as an Academy Award nomination for Elfman&#x27;s score. The film was also the second collaboration between Burton and Helena Bonham Carter, who played the characters of Jenny and the Witch, and Burton and Danny DeVito, who played Amos Calloway the circus ringleader.

Released in 2005, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; is an adaptation of the book of the same name by Roald Dahl. Starring Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket, and Deep Roy as the Oompa-Loompas, the film generally took a more faithful approach to the source material than the 1971 adaptation, &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;, although some liberties were taken, such as adding Wonka&#x27;s issue with his father (played by Christopher Lee). &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; was later nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design. The film made over $207 million domestically. Filming proved difficult as Burton, Depp, and Danny Elfman had to work on this and Burton&#x27;s &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; (2005) at the same time, which was Burton&#x27;s first full-length stop motion film as a director, featuring the voices of Johnny Depp as Victor and Helena Bonham Carter as Emily.

Burton directed his first music video, &quot;Bones&quot;, in 2006. &quot;Bones&quot; is the sixth overall single by American indie rock band The Killers and the second released from their second studio album, &quot;Sam&#x27;s Town&quot;. Starring in this video were actors Michael Steger and Devon Aoki. Burton went on to direct a second music video for The Killers, &quot;Here with Me&quot;, starring Winona Ryder, released in 2012.

The DreamWorks/Warner Bros. production &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;, based on the 1979 Broadway musical, was released on December 21, 2007, to critical acclaim and grossed $153 million worldwide. Burton&#x27;s work on &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; won the National Board of Review Award for Best Director, received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Director, and won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction. The film blends explicit gore and Broadway tunes and was well received by critics. Johnny Depp&#x27;s performance as Sweeney Todd was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

In 2005, filmmaker Shane Acker released his short film &quot;9&quot;, a story about a sentient rag doll living in a post-apocalyptic world who tries to stop machines from destroying the rest of his eight fellow rag dolls. The film won numerous awards and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. After seeing the short film, Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov, director of &quot;Wanted&quot;, showed interest in producing a feature-length adaptation of the film. Directed by Acker, the full-length film was produced by Burton, written by Acker (story) and Pamela Pettler (screenplay, co-writer of &quot;Corpse Bride&quot;), and featured the voice work of Elijah Wood, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, Martin Landau, and Crispin Glover, among others.
Burton appeared at the 2009 Comic-Con in San Diego, California, to promote both &quot;9&quot; and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;; the latter won two Academy Awards, for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design. In Burton&#x27;s version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, the story is set 13 years after the original Lewis Carroll tales. Mia Wasikowska was cast as Alice. The original start date for filming was May 2008. Torpoint and Plymouth were the locations used for filming from September 1 – October 14, and the film remains set in the Victorian era. During this time, filming took place in Antony House in Torpoint. 250 local extras were chosen in early August. Other production work took place in London. The film was originally to be released in 2009, but was pushed to March 5, 2010. The film starred Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter; Matt Lucas as both Tweedledee and Tweedledum; Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen; Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat; Anne Hathaway as the White Queen; Alan Rickman as Absolem the Caterpillar; Michael Sheen as McTwisp the White Rabbit; and Crispin Glover as the Knave of Hearts, with his face and voice added onto a CGI body. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was a commercial success, grossing $1 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of Burton&#x27;s career. Burton produced the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot; (2016), which was directed by James Bobin.

=== 2011–2021: Career fluctuations ===
Burton began filming &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, a feature film adaptation of the 1960s television series of the same name, in May 2011. In addition to starring Burton regulars Depp and Bonham Carter, the film saw Burton reunite with &quot;Batman Returns&quot; star Michelle Pfeiffer, while Burton once again collaborated with composer Danny Elfman, production designer Rick Heinrichs, and costume designer Colleen Atwood. The film was released on May 11, 2012, and grossed $245 million worldwide from a $150 million budget. Burton also co-produced &quot;Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter&quot; with Timur Bekmambetov, who also served as director (they previously worked together in &quot;9&quot;). The film, released on June 22, 2012, was based on the novel by screenwriter and novelist Seth Grahame-Smith, who wrote the film&#x27;s screenplay and also authored &quot;Pride and Prejudice and Zombies&quot;. The film starred Benjamin Walker as Abraham Lincoln, Anthony Mackie as William H. Johnson, Joseph Mawle as Lincoln&#x27;s father Thomas, Robin McLeavy as Lincoln&#x27;s mother, Nancy, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lincoln&#x27;s love interest (and later wife), Mary Ann Todd. The film received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box office. He then remade his 1984 short film &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; as a feature-length stop motion film, distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Burton has said, &quot;The film is based on a memory that I had when I was growing up and with my relationship with a dog that I had.&quot; The film was released on October 5, 2012, and met with positive reviews.

Burton directed the 2014 biographical drama film &quot;Big Eyes&quot; about American artist Margaret Keane (Amy Adams), whose work was fraudulently claimed in the 1950s and 1960s by her then-husband, Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz), and their heated divorce trial after Margaret accused Walter of stealing credit for her paintings. The script was written by the screenwriters behind Burton&#x27;s &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. Filming began in Vancouver, British Columbia, in mid-2013. The film was distributed by The Weinstein Company and released in U.S. theaters on December 25, 2014. It received generally positive reviews from critics.

Burton entered talks to direct a film adaptation of the fantasy novel &quot;Miss Peregrine&#x27;s Home for Peculiar Children&quot;, written by Ransom Riggs, in November 2011. The film, starring Asa Butterfield, Eva Green, and Samuel L. Jackson, was released in theatres by 20th Century Fox on September 30, 2016. Burton also directed a live-action adaptation of the Disney animated film &quot;Dumbo&quot;, released on March 29, 2019, with Colin Farrell, Danny DeVito, Eva Green, and Michael Keaton starring. The film grossed $353 million worldwide against a $170 million budget and combined production and advertising costs of $300 million, ultimately losing money.

===2022–present: &quot;Wednesday&quot; and resurgence ===
In February 2021, it was announced that Burton would be directing and producing &quot;Wednesday&quot;, a series for Netflix based on the titular character from The Addams Family starring Jenna Ortega and Christina Ricci. This marked Burton&#x27;s first foray into directing television since the 1980s. He helmed four episodes in the first season, which began production in September 2021 for a November 2022 release. The show was released to critical acclaim.

In October 2022, Burton announced that he would probably never work with The Walt Disney Company again after &quot;Dumbo&quot;, due to his distinctive style and working approach not matching with what Disney is currently looking for, with its focus on Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. He stated that &quot;It&#x27;s gotten to be very homogenized, very consolidated. There&#x27;s less room for different types of things&quot;.

In July 2012, It was announced that Burton was working with Seth Grahame-Smith on &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot;, a project he had been considering making since 1990. Actor Michael Keaton also expressed interest in reprising his role as the title character along with Winona Ryder as Lydia Deetz. In October 2017, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that Mike Vukadinovich was hired to write a script in time for the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary. In April 2019, Warner Bros. stated the sequel had been shelved. In February 2022, however, the sequel was announced again, this time produced by Brad Pitt&#x27;s studio Plan B Entertainment, alongside Warner Bros. Though Burton initially said that he was not involved, he later backtracked, and the sequel officially started shooting in London on May 10, 2023, with a release date of September 6, 2024, with Burton as director, Keaton and Ryder reprising their roles, and Ortega and Justin Theroux joining the cast.

== Unreleased projects ==
After Kevin Smith had been hired to write a new &quot;Superman&quot; film, he suggested Burton to direct. Burton came on and Warner Bros. set a theatrical release date for the summer of 1998, the 60th anniversary of the character&#x27;s debut in &quot;Action Comics&quot;. Nicolas Cage was signed on to play Superman, Burton hired Wesley Strick to rewrite Smith&#x27;s script, and the film entered pre-production in June 1997. For budgetary reasons, Warner Bros. ordered another rewrite from Dan Gilroy, delayed the film, and ultimately put it on hold in April 1998. Burton then left to direct &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;. Burton has depicted the experience as a difficult one, citing differences with producer Jon Peters and the studio, stating, &quot;I basically wasted a year. A year is a long time to be working with somebody that you don&#x27;t really want to be working with.&quot;

In 2002, The Walt Disney Company began to consider producing a sequel to &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, but rather than using stop motion, Disney wanted to use computer animation. Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. &quot;I was always very protective of [&#x27;Nightmare&#x27;], not to do sequels or things of that kind,&quot; Burton explained. &quot;You know, &#x27;Jack visits Thanksgiving world&#x27; or other kinds of things, just because I felt the movie had a purity to it and the people that like it... Because it&#x27;s a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it.&quot; Regardless, in 2009, Henry Selick stated that he could make a sequel to &quot;Nightmare&quot; if he and Burton could create a good story for it.

In 2012, Shane Acker confirmed that Burton would work with Valve to create his next animated feature film, &quot;Deep&quot;. Like &quot;9&quot;, the film would take place in a post-apocalyptic world (although set in a different universe). &quot;Deep&quot; would be another darker animated film, as Shane Acker has expressed his interest in creating more PG-13 animated films. Since then, there have been no further mentions of &quot;Deep&quot;, with Acker focusing on another project announced in 2013 (&quot;Beasts of Burden&quot;).

Burton was briefly attached to direct &quot;Maleficent&quot; for Walt Disney Pictures in 2011, but chose to pursue &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; and &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; instead.

It was reported that Burton would direct a 3D stop motion animation adaptation of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, which was confirmed by Christopher Meledandri, but the project was scrapped on July 17, 2013. On July 19, 2010, Burton was announced as the director of the upcoming film adaptation of &quot;Monsterpocalypse&quot;.

In 2011, it was reported that Burton was working on a live-action adaptation of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; starring Josh Brolin, who would also be co-producing. The project did not move forward.

==Frequent collaborators==
==Personal life==
Burton was married to Lena Gieseke, a German-born artist. Their marriage ended in 1991 after four years. He went on to live with model and actress Lisa Marie; she acted in the films he made during their relationship from 1992 to 2001, most notably in &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, and &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;. Burton developed a romantic relationship with English actress Helena Bonham Carter, whom he met while filming &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. Lisa Marie responded in 2005 by holding an auction of personal belongings that Burton had left behind, much to his dismay.

Burton and Bonham Carter have two children: a son, born in 2003 and a daughter born in 2007. Bonham Carter&#x27;s representative said in December 2014 that she and Burton had broken up amicably earlier that year. It is unclear whether or not they were married; Bonham Carter has used the word divorce when discussing the end of their relationship while other news outlets state that they never married. &quot;The Independent&quot; reported in September 2023 that Burton and Bonham Carter had indeed been married for years before their separation.

On March 15, 2010, Burton received the insignia of Chevalier of Arts and Letters from then-Minister of Culture Frédéric Mitterrand. The same year, Burton was the president of the jury for the 63rd Cannes Film Festival, held from May 12 to 24 in Cannes, France.

Burton&#x27;s relationship with Italian actress and model Monica Bellucci was reported in February 2023. They met in October 2022 at the Lyon&#x27;s Lumière Film Festival. Bellucci first spoke publicly about their relationship in June 2023.

==Exhibitions and books ==
From November 22, 2009, to April 26, 2010, Burton had a retrospective at the MoMA in New York with over 700 &quot;drawings, paintings, photographs, storyboards, moving-image works, puppets, maquettes, costumes and cinematic ephemera&quot;, including many from the filmmaker&#x27;s personal collection. From MoMA, the &quot;Tim Burton&quot; exhibition traveled directly to Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne. Running from June 24 to October 10, 2010, the ACMI exhibition incorporated additional material from Burton&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, which was released in March 2010.

&quot;The Art of Tim Burton&quot; was exhibited at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from May 29 to October 31, 2011, in the Museum&#x27;s Resnick Pavilion. LACMA also featured six films of Tim Burton&#x27;s idol, Vincent Price. &quot;Tim Burton, the exhibition/Tim Burton, l&#x27;exposition&quot; was exhibited at the Cinémathèque Française from March 7 to August 5, 2012, in Paris, France. All of Tim Burton&#x27;s movies were shown during the exhibition.

&quot;Tim Burton at Seoul Museum of Art&quot; was exhibited as a promotion of Hyundai Card at Seoul Museum of Art from December 12, 2012, to April 15, 2013, in Seoul, South Korea. This exhibition featured 862 of Burton&#x27;s works including drawings, paintings, short films, sculptures, music, and costumes that have been used in the making of his feature-length movies. The exhibition was divided into three parts: the first part, &quot;Surviving Burbank&quot;, covered his younger years, from 1958 to 1976. The second, &quot;Beautifying Burbank&quot;, covers 1977 to 1984, including his time with CalArts and Walt Disney. The last segment, &quot;Beyond Burbank&quot;, covers 1985 onward.

&quot;Tim Burton and His World&quot; was exhibited at the Stone Bell House from March 3 to August 8, 2014, in Prague, Czech Republic. The exhibition later premiered at the Museu da Imagem e do Som in São Paulo, Brazil, on February 4, 2016, and lasted until June 5. The exhibition was later held in Artis Tree in Taikoo Place, Hong Kong, from November 5, 2016, to January 23, 2017. The exhibition returned to Brazil from May 28 to August 11, 2019, being held at the Centro Cultural Banco do Brasil in Brasília.

Burton&#x27;s first exhibition in the United States in nearly a decade, &quot;Lost Vegas: Tim Burton&quot;, opened in October 2019 at The Neon Museum in Las Vegas.

Burton also wrote and illustrated the poetry book &quot;The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy &amp; Other Stories&quot;, published in 1997 by British publishing house Faber and Faber, and a compilation of his drawings, sketches, and other artwork, entitled &quot;The Art of Tim Burton&quot;, was released in 2009. A follow-up to that book, entitled &quot;The Napkin Art of Tim Burton: Things You Think About in a Bar&quot;, containing sketches made by Burton on napkins at bars and restaurants he visited, was released in 2015.

<doc id="31502" wikidata="Q51476" url="?curid=31502" title="Tod Browning">
<text>Tod Browning (born Charles Albert Browning Jr.; July 12, 1880 – October 6, 1962) was an American film director, film actor, screenwriter, vaudeville performer, and carnival sideshow and circus entertainer. He directed a number of films of various genres between 1915 and 1939, but was primarily known for horror films. Browning was often cited in the trade press as &quot;the Edgar Allan Poe of cinema.&quot;

Browning&#x27;s career spanned the silent and sound film eras. He is known as the director of &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931), &quot;Freaks&quot; (1932), and his silent film collaborations with Lon Chaney and Priscilla Dean.

==Early life==
Charles Albert Browning, Jr., was born in Louisville, Kentucky on July 12, 1880, the second son of Charles Albert and Lydia Browning. Charles Albert Sr., &quot;a bricklayer, carpenter and machinist,&quot; provided his family with a middle-class and Baptist household. Browning&#x27;s uncle, the baseball star Pete &quot;Louisville Slugger&quot; Browning saw his sobriquet conferred on the iconic baseball bat. His Browning sought to escape early on.&quot; And: &quot;A non-conformist within his family, Browning seems to have taken after his uncle, the baseball player Pete Browning. Like Pete he was alcoholic from a young age (an affliction that would eventually result in Pete being committed to a mental institution).&quot;

==Circus, sideshow and vaudeville==
Browning was fascinated by circus and carnival life as a child. At the age of 16, and before finishing high school, he ran away from his well-to-do family to join a traveling circus.

Initially hired as a roustabout, he soon began serving as a &quot;spieler&quot; (a barker at sideshows) and by 1901 was performing song and dance routines for Ohio and Mississippi riverboat entertainment, as well as acting as a contortionist for the Manhattan Fair and Carnival Company. Browning developed a live burial act in which he was billed as &quot;The Living Hypnotic Corpse&quot;, and performed as a clown with the Ringling Brothers circus. He would later draw on these early experiences to inform his cinematic inventions.

In 1906, Browning was briefly married to Amy Louis Stevens in Louisville. Adopting the professional name &quot;Tod&quot; Browning (&quot;tod&quot; is the German word for death), Browning abandoned his wife and became a vaudevillian, touring extensively as both a magician&#x27;s assistant and a blackface comedian in an act called &quot;The Lizard and the Coon&quot; with comedian Roy C. Jones. He appeared in a Mutt and Jeff sketch in the 1912 burlesque revue &quot;The World of Mirth&quot; with comedian Charles Murray.

==Film actor: 1909–1913==
In 1909, after 13 years performing in carnivals and vaudeville circuits, Browning, age 29, transitioned to film acting.

Browning&#x27;s work as a comedic film actor began in 1909 when he performed with director and screenwriter Edward Dillon in film shorts. In all, Browning was cast in over 50 of these one- or two-reeler slapstick productions. Film historian Boris Henry observes that &quot;Browning&#x27;s experience as a slapstick actor [became] incorporated into his career as a filmmaker.&quot; Dillon later provided many of the screenplays for the early films that Browning would direct. A number of actors that Browning performed with in his early acting career would later appear in his own pictures, many of whom served their apprenticeships with Keystone Cops director Mack Sennett, among them Wallace Beery, Ford Sterling, Polly Moran, Wheeler Oakman, Raymond Griffith, Kalla Pasha, Mae Busch, Wallace MacDonald and Laura La Varnie.

In 1913, Browning was hired by film director D. W. Griffith at Biograph Studios in New York City, first appearing as an undertaker in &quot;Scenting a Terrible Crime&quot; (1913). Both Griffith and Browning departed Biograph and New York that same year and together joined Reliance-Majestic Studios in Hollywood, California. Browning was featured in several Reliance-Majestic films, including &quot;The Wild Girl&quot; (1917).

==Early film directing and screenwriting: 1914–1916==
Film historian Vivian Sobchack reports that &quot;a number of one- or two-reelers are attributed to Browning from 1914 to 1916&quot; and biographer Michael Barson credits Browning&#x27;s directorial debut to the one-reeler drama &quot;The Lucky Transfer&quot;, released in March 1915.

Browning&#x27;s career almost ended when, intoxicated, he drove his vehicle into a railroad crossing and collided with a locomotive. Browning suffered grievous injuries, as did passenger George Siegmann. A second passenger, actor Elmer Booth, was killed instantly. Film historian Jon Towlson notes that &quot;alcoholism was to contribute to a major trauma in Browning&#x27;s personal life that would shape his thematic obsessions...After 1915, Browning began to direct his traumatic experience into his work – radically reshaping it in the process.&quot; According to biographers David J. Skal and Elias Savada, the tragic event transformed Browning&#x27;s creative outlook:

Indeed, the thirty-one films that Browning wrote and directed between 1920 and 1939 were, with few exceptions, melodramas.

Browning&#x27;s injuries likely precluded a further career as an actor. During his protracted convalescence, Browning turned to writing screenplays for Reliance-Majestic. Upon his recovery, Browning joined Griffith&#x27;s film crew on the set of &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916) as an assistant director and appeared in a bit part for the production&#x27;s &quot;modern story&quot; sequence.

==Director: early silent feature films, 1917–1919==
In 1917, Browning wrote and directed his first full-length feature film, &quot;Jim Bludso&quot;, for Fine Arts/ Triangle film companies, starring Wilfred Lucas in the title role. The story is based on a poem by John Hay, a former personal secretary to Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War.

Browning married his second wife Alice Watson in 1917; they would remain together until her death in 1944.

Returning to New York in 1917, Browning directed pictures for Metro Pictures. There he made &quot;Peggy, the Will O&#x27; the Wisp&quot; and &quot;The Jury of Fate&quot;. Both starred Mabel Taliaferro, the latter in a dual role achieved with double exposure techniques that were groundbreaking for the time. Film historian Vivian Sobchack notes that many of these films &quot;involved the disguise and impersonations found in later Browning films.&quot; (See Filmography below.) Browning returned to Hollywood in 1918 and produced three more films for Metro, each of which starred Edith Storey: &quot;The Eyes of Mystery&quot;, &quot;The Legion of Death&quot; and &quot;Revenge&quot;, all filmed and released in 1918. These early and profitable five-, six- and seven-reel features Browning made between 1917–1919 established him as &quot;a successful director and script writer.&quot;

In the spring of 1918 Browning departed Metro and signed with Bluebird Photoplays studios (a subsidiary of Carl Laemmle&#x27;s Universal Pictures), then in 1919 with Universal where he would direct a series of &quot;extremely successful&quot; films starring Priscilla Dean.

==Universal Studios: 1919–1923==
During his tenure at Universal, Browning directed a number of the studio&#x27;s top female actors, among them Edith Roberts in &quot;The Deciding Kiss&quot; and &quot;Set Free&quot; (both 1918) and Mary MacLaren in &quot;The Unpainted Woman&quot;, &quot;A Petal on the Current&quot; and &quot;Bonnie, Bonnie Lassie&quot;, all 1919 productions. Browning&#x27;s most notable films for Universal, however, starred Priscilla Dean, &quot;Universal&#x27;s leading lady known for playing &#x27;tough girls&#x27;&quot; and with whom he would direct nine features.

===The Priscilla Dean films===

Browning&#x27;s first successful Dean picture—a &quot;spectacular melodrama&quot;—is &quot;The Virgin of Stamboul&quot; (1920). Dean portrays Sari, a &quot;virgin beggar girl&quot; who is desired by the Turkish chieftain Achmet Hamid (Wallace Beery). Browning&#x27;s handling of the former slapstick comedian Beery as Achmet reveals the actor&#x27;s comedic legacy and Browning&#x27;s own roots in burlesque. Film historian Stuart Rosenthal wrote that the Dean vehicles possess &quot;the seemingly authentic atmosphere with which Browning instilled his crime melodramas, adding immeasurably to later efforts like &quot;The Black Bird&quot; (1926), &quot;The Show&quot; (1927) and &quot;The Unholy Three&quot; (1925).&quot;

The Dean films exhibit Browning&#x27;s fascination with &#x27;exotic&#x27; foreign settings and with underworld criminal activities, which serve to drive the action of his films. Dean is cast as a thieving demimonde who infiltrates high society to burgle jewelry in &quot;The Exquisite Thief&quot; (1919); in &quot;Under Two Flags&quot; (1922), set in colonial French Algiers, Dean is cast as a French-Arab member of a harem—her sobriquet is &quot;Cigarette—servicing the French Foreign Legion; and in &quot;Drifting&quot; (1923), with its &quot;compelling&quot; Shanghai, China scenes recreated on the Universal backlot, Dean plays an opium dealer. In Browning&#x27;s final Dean vehicle at Universal, &quot;White Tiger&quot;, he indulged his fascination with &quot;quasi-theatrical&quot; productions of illusion—and revealed to movie audiences the mechanisms of these deceptions. In doing so, Browning—a former member of the fraternity of magicians—violated a precept of their professional code.

Perhaps the most fortuitous outcome of the Dean films at Universal is that they introduced Browning to future collaborator Lon Chaney, the actor who would star in Browning&#x27;s most outstanding films of the silent era. Chaney had already earned the sobriquet &quot;The Man of a Thousand Faces&quot; as early as 1919 for his work at Universal. Universal&#x27;s vice-president Irving Thalberg paired Browning with Chaney for the first time in &quot;The Wicked Darling&quot; (1919), a melodrama in which Chaney played the thief &quot;Stoop&quot; Conners who forces a poor girl (Dean) from the slums into a life of crime and prostitution.

In 1921, Browning and Thalberg enlisted Chaney in another Dean vehicle, &quot;Outside the Law&quot;, in which he plays the dual roles of the sinister &quot;Black Mike&quot; Sylva and the benevolent Ah Wing. Both of these Universal production exhibit Browning&#x27;s &quot;natural affinity for the melodramatic and grotesque.&quot; In a special effect that drew critical attention, Chaney appears to murder his own dual character counterpart through trick photography and &quot;with Thalberg supporting their imaginative freedom, Chaney&#x27;s ability and unique presence fanned the flames of Browning&#x27;s passion for the extraordinary.&quot; Biographer Stuart Rosenthal remarks upon the foundations of the Browning-Chaney professional synergy:

When Thalberg resigned as vice-president at Universal to serve as production manager with the newly amalgamated Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1925, Browning and Chaney accompanied him.

== The Browning-Chaney collaborations at MGM: 1925–1929 ==

After moving to MGM in 1925 under the auspices of production manager Irving Thalberg, Browning and Chaney made eight critically and commercially successful feature films, representing the zenith of both their silent film careers. Browning wrote or co-wrote the stories for six of the eight productions. Screenwriter Waldemar Young, credited on nine of the MGM pictures, worked effectively with Browning. At MGM, Browning would reach his artistic maturity as a filmmaker.

The first of these MGM productions established Browning as a talented filmmaker in Hollywood, and deepened Chaney&#x27;s professional and personal influence on the director: &quot;The Unholy Three&quot;.

=== &quot;The Unholy Three&quot; (1925) ===
In a circus tale by author Tod Robbins—a setting familiar to Browning—a trio of criminal ex-carnies and a pickpocket form a jewelry theft ring. Their activities lead to a murder and an attempt to frame an innocent bookkeeper. Two of the criminal quartet reveal their humanity and are redeemed; two perish through violent justice.

&quot;The Unholy Three&quot; is an outstanding example of Browning&#x27;s delight in the &quot;bizarre&quot; (though, here, not macabre) melodrama and its &quot;the perverse characterizations&quot; that Browning and Chaney devise anticipate their subsequent collaborations.

Lon Chaney doubles as Professor Echo, a sideshow ventriloquist, and as Mrs. &quot;Granny&quot; O&#x27;Grady (a cross-dressing Echo), the mastermind of the gang. Granny/Echo operates a talking parrot pet shop as a front for the operation. Film critic Alfred Eaker notes that Chaney renders &quot;the drag persona with depth of feeling. Chaney never camps it up and delivers a remarkable, multifaceted performance.&quot;

Harry Earles, a member of The Doll Family midget performers plays the violent and wicked Tweedledee who poses as Granny&#x27;s infant grandchild, Little Willie. (Granny conveys the diminutive Willie in a perambulator.)

Victor McLagen is cast as weak-minded Hercules, the circus strongman who constantly seeks to assert his physical primacy over his cohorts. Hercules detests Granny/Echo, but is terrified by the ventriloquist&#x27;s &quot;pet&quot; gorilla. He doubles as Granny O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s son-in-law and father to Little Willie.

The pickpocket Rosie, played by Mae Busch, is the object of Echo&#x27;s affection, and they share a mutual admiration as fellow larcenists. She postures as the daughter to Granny/Echo and as the mother of Little Willie.

The pet shop employs the diffident bookkeeper, Hector &quot;The Boob&quot; MacDonald (Matt Moore) who is wholly ignorant of the criminal proceedings. Rosie finds this &quot;weak, gentle, upright, hardworking&quot; man attractive.

When Granny O&#x27;Malley assembles her faux-&quot;family&quot; in her parlor to deceive police investigators, the movie audience knows that &quot;the grandmother is the head of a gang and a ventriloquist, the father a stupid Hercules, the mother a thief, the baby a libidinous, greedy [midget], and the pet...an enormous gorilla.&quot; Browning&#x27;s portrait is a &quot;sarcastic distortion&quot; that subverts a cliched American wholesomeness and serves to deliver &quot;a harsh indictment...of the bourgeois family.&quot;

Film historian Stuart Rosenthal identifies &quot;the ability to control another being&quot; as a central theme in &quot;The Unholy Three&quot;. The deceptive scheme through which the thieves manipulate wealthy clients, demonstrates a control over &quot;the suckers&quot; who are stripped of their wealth, much as circus sideshow patrons are deceived: Professor Echo and his ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy distract a &quot;hopelessly naive and novelty-loving&quot; audience as pickpocket Rosie relieves them of their wallets. Browning ultimately turns the application of &quot;mental control&quot; to serve justice. When bookkeeper Hector takes the stand in court, testifying in his defense against a false charge of murder, the reformed Echo applies his willpower to silence the defendant, and uses his voice throwing power to provide the exonerating testimony. When Hector descends from the stand, he tells his attorney &quot;That wasn&#x27;t me talking. I didn&#x27;t say a word.&quot; Browning employs a set of dissolves to make the ventriloquists role perfectly clear.

Film historian Robin Blyn comments on the significance of Echo&#x27;s courtroom confession:

With &quot;The Unholy Three,&quot; Browning provided MGM with a huge box-office and critical success.

=== &quot;The Mystic&quot; (1925) ===
While Lon Chaney was making &quot;The Tower of Lies&quot; (1925) with director Victor Sjöström Browning wrote and directed an Aileen Pringle vehicle, &quot;The Mystic&quot;. The picture has many of the elements typical of Browning oeuvre at MGM: Carnivals, Hungarian Gypsies and séances provide the exotic &quot;mise-en-scene&quot;, while the melodramatic plot involves embezzlement and swindling. An American con man Michael Nash (Conway Tearle) develops a moral conscience after falling in love with Pringle&#x27;s character, Zara, and is consistent with Browning&#x27;s &quot;themes of reformation and unpunished crimes.&quot; and the couple achieve a happy reckoning. Browning, a former sideshow performer, is quick to reveal to his movie audience the illusionist fakery that serves to extract a fortune from a gullible heiress, played by Gladys Hulette.

&quot;Dollar Down&quot; (1925): Browning followed &quot;The Mystic&quot; with another &quot;crook melodrama involving swindlers&quot; for Truart productions. Based on a story by Jane Courthope and Ethyl Hill, &quot;Dollar Down&quot; stars Ruth Roland and Henry B. Walthall.

Following these &quot;more conventional&quot; crime films, Browning and Chaney embarked on their final films of the late silent period, &quot;the strangest collaboration between director and actor in cinema history; the premises of the films were outrageous.&quot;

=== &quot;The Blackbird&quot; (1926) ===


Browning and Chaney were reunited in their next feature film, &quot;The Blackbird&quot; (1926), one of the most &quot;visually arresting&quot; of their collaborations.

Browning introduces Limehouse district gangster Dan Tate (Chaney), alias &quot;The Blackbird&quot;, who creates an alter identity, the physically deformed christian missionary &quot;The Bishop.&quot; Tate&#x27;s purported &quot;twin&quot; brother is a persona he uses to periodically evade suspicion by the police under &quot;a phony mantle of christian goodness&quot;—an image utterly at odds with the persona of The Blackbird. According to film historian Stuart Rosenthal, &quot;Tate&#x27;s masquerade as the Bishop succeeds primarily because the Bishop&#x27;s face so believably reflects a profound spiritual suffering that is absolutely foreign to the title character [The Blackbird].&quot;

Tate&#x27;s competitor in crime, the &quot;gentleman-thief&quot; Bertram &quot;West End Bertie&quot; Glade (Owen Moore, becomes romantically involved with a Limehouse cabaret singer, Mademoiselle Fifi Lorraine (Renée Adorée). The jealous Tate attempts to frame Bertie for the murder of a policeman, but is mortally injured in an accident while in the guise of The Bishop. Tate&#x27;s wife, Polly (Doris Lloyd discovers her husband&#x27;s dual identity, and honors him by concealing his role as &quot;The Blackbird.&quot; The reformed Bertie and his lover Fifi are united in matrimony.

Chaney&#x27;s adroit &quot;quick-change&quot; transformations from the Blackbird into The Bishop—intrinsic to the methods of &quot;show culture&quot;—are &quot;explicitly revealed&quot; to the movie audience, such that Browning invites them to share in the deception.

Browning introduces a number of slapstick elements into &quot;The Blackbird&quot;. Doris Lloyd, portrays Tate&#x27;s ex-wife Limehouse Polly, demonstrating her comic acumen in scenes as a flower girl, and Browning&#x27;s Limehouse drunkards are &quot;archetypical of burlesque cinema.&quot; Film historian Boris Henry points out that &quot;it would not be surprising if the fights that Lon Chaney as Dan Tate mimes between his two characters (The Blackbird and The Bishop) were inspired by actor-director Max Linder&#x27;s performance in Be My Wife, 1921.&quot;

Film historian Stuart Rosenthal identifies Browning&#x27;s characterization of Dan Tate/the Blackbird as a species of vermin lacking in nobility, a parasitic scavenger that feeds on carrion and is unworthy of sympathy. In death, according to film critic Nicole Brenez, The Blackbird &quot;is deprived of [himself]...death, then, is no longer a beautiful vanishing, but a terrible spiriting away.&quot;

Though admired by critics for Chaney&#x27;s performance, the film was only modestly successful at the box office.

=== &quot;The Road to Mandalay&quot; (1926) ===
Any comprehensive contemporary evaluation of Browning&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Mandalay&quot; is problematic. According to Browning biographer Alfred Eaker only a small fraction of the original seven reels exist. A 16 mm version survives in a &quot;fragmented and disintegrated state&quot; discovered in France in the 1980s.

In a story that Browning wrote with screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz , &quot;The Road to Mandalay&quot; (not related to author Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1890 poem), is derived from the character &quot;dead-eyed&quot; Singapore Joe (Lon Chaney), a Singapore brothel operator. As Browning himself explained:

The picture explores one of Browning&#x27;s most persistent themes: that of a parent who asserts sexual authority vicariously through their own offspring. As such, an Oedipal narrative is established, &quot;a narrative that dominates Browning&#x27;s work&quot; and recognized as such by contemporary critics.

Joe&#x27;s daughter, Rosemary (Lois Moran), now a young adult, has been raised in a convent where her father left her as an infant with her uncle, Father James (Henry B. Walthall). Rosemary is ignorant of her parentage; she lives a chaste and penurious existence. Brothel keeper Joe makes furtive visits to the shop where she works as a clerk. His attempts to anomalously befriend the girl are met with revulsion at his freakish appearance. Joe resolves to undergo plastic surgery to achieve a reproachment with his daughter and redeem his sordid history. Father James doubts his brothers&#x27; commitment to reform and to reestablish his parenthood. A conflict emerges when Joe&#x27;s cohorts and rivals in crime, &quot;The Admiral&quot; Herrington (Owen Moore) and English Charlie Wing (Kamiyama Sojin), members of &quot;the black spiders of the Seven Seas&quot; appear on the scene. The Admiral encounters Rosemary at the bazaar where she works and is instantly smitten with her; his genuine resolve to abandon his criminal life wins Rosemary&#x27;s devotion and a marriage is arranged. When Joe discovers these developments, the full force of his &quot;sexual frustrations&quot; are unleashed. Joe&#x27;s attempt to thwart his daughter&#x27;s efforts to escape his control ends when Rosemary stabs her father, mortally wounding him. The denouement is achieved when the dying Joe consents to her marriage and Father James performs the last rites upon his brother.

Film critic Alfred Eaker observes: &quot;&quot;The Road to Mandalay&quot; is depraved, pop-Freudian, silent melodrama at its ripest. Fortunately, both Browning and Chaney approach this hodgepodge of silliness in dead earnest.&quot; Religious imagery commonly appears in Browning&#x27;s films, &quot;surrounding his characters with religious paraphernalia.&quot; Browning, a mason, uses Christian iconography to emphasize Joe&#x27;s moral alienation from Rosemary. Biographer Stuart Rosenthal writes:

Rosenthal adds &quot;&quot;Religion for the Browning hero is an additional spring of frustration – another defaulted promise.&quot;

As in all of the Browning-Chaney collaborations, &quot;The Road to Mandalay&quot; was profitable at the box office.

=== &quot;London After Midnight&quot; (1927) ===
Whereas Browning&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Mandalay&quot; (1926) exists in a much deteriorated 16 mm abridged version, &quot;London After Midnight&quot; is no longer believed to exist, the last print destroyed in an MGM vault fire in 1965.

&quot;London After Midnight&quot; is widely considered by archivists the Holy Grail and &quot;the most sought after and discussed lost film of the silent era.&quot; A detailed photo reconstruction, based on stills from the film was assembled by Turner Classic Movies&#x27; Rick Schmidlin in 2002.

Based on Browning&#x27;s own tale entitled &quot;The Hypnotist&quot;, &quot;London After Midnight&quot; is a &quot;drawing room murder mystery&#x27;—its macabre and Gothic atmosphere resembling director Robert Wiene&#x27;s 1920 &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;.

Sir Roger Balfour is found dead at the estate of his friend Sir James Hamlin. The gunshot wound to Balfour&#x27;s head appears self-inflicted. The Scotland Yard inspector and forensic hypnotist in charge, &quot;Professor&quot; Edward C. Burke (Lon Chaney) receives no reports of foul play and the death is deemed a suicide. Five years past, and the estates current occupants are alarmed by a ghoulish, fanged figure wearing a cape and top hat stalking the hallways at night. He is accompanied by a corpse-like female companion. The pair of intruders are the disguised Inspector Burke, masquerading as a vampire (also played by Chaney), and his assistant, &quot;Luna, the Bat Girl&quot; (Edna Tichenor). When the terrified residents call Scotland Yard, Inspector Burke appears and reopens Balfour&#x27;s case as a homicide. Burke uses his double role to stage a series of elaborate illusions and applications of hypnotism to discover the identity of the murderer among Balfour&#x27;s former associates.

Browning&#x27;s &quot;preposterous&quot; plot is the platform on which he demonstrates the methods of magic and show culture, reproducing the mystifying spectacles of &quot;spirit theater&quot; that purport to operate through the paranormal. Browning&#x27;s cinematic illusions are conducted strictly through mechanical stage apparatus: no trick photography is employed. &quot;illusion, hypnotism and disguise&quot; are used to mimic the conceits and pretenses of the occult, but primarily for dramatic effect and only to reveal them as tricks.

After the murderer is apprehended, Browning&#x27;s Inspector Burke/The Man in the Beaver Hat reveals the devices and techniques he has used to extract the confession, while systematically disabusing the cast characters—and the movie audience—of any supernatural influence on the foregoing events. Film historians Stefanie Diekmann and Ekkehard Knörer observe succinctly that &quot;All in all, Browning&#x27;s scenarios [including London After Midnight] appear as a long series of tricks, performed and explained.&quot;

Lon Chaney&#x27;s make-up to create the menacing &quot;Man with the Beaver Hat&quot; is legendary. Biographer Alfred Eaker writes: &quot;Chaney&#x27;s vampire...is a make-up artist&#x27;s delight, and an actor&#x27;s hell. Fishing wire looped around his blackened eye sockets, a set of painfully inserted, shark-like teeth producing a hideous grin, a ludicrous wig under a top hat, and white pancake makeup achieved Chaney&#x27;s kinky look. To add to the effect Chaney developed a misshapen, incongruous walk for the character.&quot;

London After Midnight received a mixed critical response, but delivered handsomely at the box office &quot;grossing over $1,000,000 in 1927 dollars against a budget of $151,666.14.&quot;

=== &quot;The Show&quot; (1927) ===

In 1926, while Lon Chaney was busy making &quot;Tell It to the Marines&quot; with filmmaker George W. Hill, Browning directed The Show, &quot;one of the most bizarre productions to emerge from silent cinema.&quot; (&quot;The Show&quot; anticipates his subsequent feature with Chaney, a &quot;carnival of terror&quot;: &quot;The Unknown&quot;).

Screenwriter Waldemar Young based the scenario on elements from the author Charles Tenny Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Day of Souls&quot;.

&quot;The Show&quot; is a &quot;tour-de-force&quot; demonstration of Browning&#x27;s penchant for the spectacle of carnival sideshow acts combined with the revelatory exposure of the theatrical apparatus and techniques that create these illusions. Film historian Matthew Solomon notes that &quot;this is not specific to his films with Lon Chaney.&quot; Indeed, &quot;The Show&quot; features two of MGM&#x27;s leading actors: John Gilbert, as the unscrupulous ballyhoo Cock Robin, and Renée Adorée as his tempestuous lover, Salome. Actor Lionel Barrymore plays the homicidal Greek. Romantic infidelities, the pursuit of a small fortune, a murder, attempted murders, Cock Robin&#x27;s moral redeemtion and his reconciliation with Salome comprise the plot and its &quot;saccarine&quot; ending.

Browning presents a menagerie of circus sideshow novelty acts from the fictitious &quot;Palace of Illusions&quot;, including disembodied hands delivering tickets to customers; an illusionary beheading of a biblical figure (Gilbert as John the Baptist); Neptuna (Betty Boyd) Queen of the Mermaids; the sexually untoward Zela (Zalla Zarana) Half-Lady; and Arachnida (Edna Tichenor, the Human Spider perched on her web. Browning ultimately reveals &quot;how the trick is done&quot;, explicating the mechanical devices to the film audience – not to the film&#x27;s carnival patrons.

The central dramatic event of &quot;The Show&quot; derives from another literary work, a &quot;magic playlet&quot; by Oscar Wilde entitled &quot;Salomé&quot; (1896). Browning devises an elaborate and &quot;carefully choreographed&quot; sideshow reenactment of Jokanaan&#x27;s biblical beheading (played by Gilbert), with Adorée as Salomé presiding over the lurid decapitation, symbolic of sadomasochism and castration.

&quot;The Show&quot; received generally good reviews, but approval was muted due to Gilbert&#x27;s unsavory character, Cock Robin. Browning was now poised to make his masterwork of the silent era, &quot;The Unknown&quot; (1927).

=== &quot;The Unknown&quot; (1927): A silent era chef d&#x27;oeuvre ===
&quot;The Unknown&quot; marks the creative apogee of the Tod Browning and Lon Chaney collaborations, and is widely considered their most outstanding work of the silent era. More so than any of Browning&#x27;s silent pictures, he fully realizes one of his central themes in &quot;The Unknown&quot;: the linkage of physical deformity with sexual frustration.

Circus performer &quot;Alonzo the armless&quot;, a Gypsy knife-thrower, appears as a double amputee, casting his knives with his feet. His deformity is an illusion (except for a bifid thumb), achieved by donning a corset to bind and conceal his healthy arms. The able-bodied Alonzo, sought by the police, engages in this deception to evade detection and arrest. Alonzo harbors a secret love for Nanon (Joan Crawford), his assistant in the act. Nanon&#x27;s father is the abusive (perhaps sexually so) ringmaster Zanzi (Nick De Ruiz), and Nanon has developed a pathological aversion to any man&#x27;s embrace. Her emotional dysfunction precludes any sexual intimacy with the highly virile strong-man, Malabar, or Alonzo, his own sexual prowess symbolized by his knife-throwing expertise and his double thumb. When Alonzo murders Zanzi during an argument, the homicide is witnessed by Nanon, who detects only the bifid thumb of her father&#x27;s assailant.
Browning&#x27;s theme of sexual frustration and physical mutilation ultimately manifests itself in Alonzo&#x27;s act of symbolic castration; he willingly has his arms amputated by an unlicensed surgeon so as to make himself unthreatening to Nanon (and to eliminate the incriminating bifid thumb), so as to win her affection. The &quot;nightmarish irony&quot; of Alonzo&#x27;s sacrifice is the most outrageous of Browning&#x27;s plot conceits and consistent with his obsessive examination of &quot;sexual frustration and emasculation&quot;. When Alonzo recovers from his surgery, he returns to the circus to find that Nanon has overcome her sexual aversions and married the strongman Malabar (Norman Kerry). The primal ferocity of Alonzo&#x27;s reaction to Nanon&#x27;s betrayal in marrying Malabar is instinctual. Film historian Stuart Rosenthal writes:

Alonzo&#x27;s efforts at retribution lead to his own horrific death in a &quot;Grand Guignol finale&quot;.

&quot;The Unknown&quot; is widely regarded as the most outstanding of the Browning-Chaney collaborations and a masterpiece of the late silent film era. Film critic Scott Brogan regards &quot;The Unknown&quot; worthy of &quot;cult status.&quot;

=== &quot;The Big City&quot; (1928) ===
A lost film, &quot;The Big City&quot; stars Lon Chaney, Marceline Day and Betty Compson, the latter in her only appearance in an MGM film. Browning wrote the story and Waldemar Young the screenplay concerning &quot;A gangster Lon Chaney who uses a costume jewelry store as a front for his jewel theft operation. After a conflict with a rival gang, he and his girlfriend Marceline Day reform.&quot;

Film historian Vivian Sobchack remarked that &quot;&quot;The Big City&quot; concerns a nightclub robbery, again, the rivalry between two thieves. This time Chaney plays only one of them—without a twisted limb or any facial disguise.&#x27;&quot; Critic Stuart Rosenthal commented on &quot;The Big City&quot;: &quot;...Chaney, without makeup, in a characteristic gangster role.&quot;

&quot;The Big City&quot; garnered MGM $387,000 in profits.

=== &quot;West of Zanzibar&quot; (1928) ===


In 1928, Browning and Lon Chaney embarked upon their penultimate collaboration, West of Zanzibar, based on Chester M. De Vonde play &quot;Kongo&quot; (1926).
scenario by Elliott J. Clawson and Waldemar Young, provided Chaney with dual characterizations: the magician Pharos, and the later paraplegic Pharos who is nicknamed &quot;Dead Legs.&quot; A variation of the &quot;unknown parentage motif&quot; Browning dramatizes a complex tale of &quot;obsessive revenge&quot; and &quot;psychological horror.&quot; Biographer Stuart Rosenthal made these observations on Chaney&#x27;s portrayals:
The story opens in Paris, where Pharos, a magician, is cuckolded by his wife Anna (Jacqueline Gadsden) and her lover Crane (Lionel Barrymore). Pharos is crippled when Crane pushes him from a balcony, leaving him a paraplegic. Anna and Crane abscond to Africa. After a year, Phroso learns that Anna has returned. He finds his wife dead in a church, with an infant daughter beside her. He swears to avenge himself both on Crane and the child he assumes was sired by Crane. Unbeknownst to Phroso, the child is actually his. Rosenthal singles out this scene for special mention:

Eighteen years hence, the crippled Pharos, now dubbed Dead Legs, operates an African trading outpost. He secretly preys upon Crane&#x27;s ivory operations employing local tribes and using sideshow tricks and illusions to seize the goods. After years of anticipation, Dead Legs prepares to hatch his &quot;macabre revenge&quot;: a sinister double murder. He summons Anna&#x27;s daughter Maizie (Mary Nolan) from the sordid brothel and gin mill where he has left her to be raised. He also invites Crane to visit his outpost so as to expose the identity of the culprit stealing his ivory. Dead Legs has arranged to have Crane murdered, but not before informing him that he will invoke the local Death Code, which stipulates that &quot;a man&#x27;s demise be followed by the death of his wife or child.&quot; Crane mockingly disabuses Dead Legs of his gross misapprehension: Maizie is Dead Legs&#x27; daughter, not his, a child that Pharos conceived with Anna in Paris. Crane is killed before Dead Legs can absorb the significance of this news.

The climax of the film involves Dead Legs&#x27; struggle to save his own offspring from the customary death sentence that his own deadly scheme has set in motion. Dead Legs ultimately suffers the consequences of his &quot;horribly misdirected revenge ploy.&quot; The redemptive element with which Browning-Chaney endows Pharos/Dead Legs fate is noted by Rosenthal: &quot;&quot;West of Zanzibar&quot; reaches the peak of its psychological horror when Chaney discovers that the girl he is using as a pawn in his revenge scheme is his own daughter. Dead Legs undertook his mission of revenge with complete confidence in the righteousness of his cause. Now he is suddenly overwhelmed by the realization of his own guilt. That Barrymore as Crane committed the original transgression in no way diminishes that guilt.&quot;

Dead Legs&#x27; physical deformity reduces him to crawling on the ground, and thus to the &quot;state of an animal.&quot; Browning&#x27;s camera placement accentuates his snake-like &quot;slithering&quot; and establishes &quot;his animal transformation by suddenly changing the visual frame of reference to one that puts the viewer on the same level as the beast on the screen, thereby making him vulnerable to it, accomplished by tilting the camera up at floor level in front of the moving subject [used to] accentuate Chaney&#x27;s [Dead Legs] slithering movements in West of Zanzibar.&quot; Film historians Stephanie Diekmann and Ekkehard Knörer state more generally &quot;...the spectator in Browning&#x27;s films can never remain a voyeur; or rather, he is never safe in his voyeuristic position...&quot;

Diekmann and Knörer also place &quot;West of Zanzibar&quot; in the within the realm of the Grand Guignol tradition:

Despite being characterized as a &quot;cess-pool&quot; by the censorious Harrison&#x27;s Reports motion picture trade journal, &quot;West of Zanzibar&quot; enjoyed popular success at the box office.

=== &quot;Where East Is East&quot; (1929) ===

Adapted by Waldemar Young from a story by Browning and Harry Sinclair Drago, &quot;Where East Is East&quot; borrows its title from the opening and closing verses of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1889 poem &quot;The Ballad of East and West&quot;: &quot;Oh! East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet...&quot; Browning&#x27;s appropriation of the term &quot;Where East Is East&quot; is both ironic and subversive with regard to his simultaneous cinematic presentation of Eurocentric cliches of the &quot;East&quot; (common in early 20th century advertising, literature and film), and his exposure of these memes as myths. Film historian Stefan Brandt writes that this verse was commonly invoked by Western observers to reinforce conceptions stressing &quot;the homogeneity and internal consistency of &#x27;The East&#x27;&quot; and points out that Kipling (born and raised in Bombay, India) was &quot;far from being one-dimensional&quot; when his literary work &quot;dismantles the myth of ethnic essentiality&quot;:

Biographer Bernd Herzogenrath adds that &quot;paradoxically, the film both essentializes the East as a universal and homogeneous entity (&quot;Where East Is East&quot;) and deconstructs it as a Western myth consisting of nothing but colorful [male] fantasies.&quot; [brackets and parentheses in original]

The last of Browning-Chaney collaborations with an &quot;outrageous premise&quot; and their final silent era film, &quot;Where East Is East&quot; was marketed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer &quot;as a colonial drama in the mold of British imperialist fiction.&quot;

&quot;Where East Is East&quot;, set in the &quot;picturesque French Indo-China of the 1920s&quot; concerns the efforts of big game trapper &quot;Tiger&quot; Haynes (Chaney) intervention to stop his beloved half-Chinese daughter Toyo (Lupe Velez) from marrying Bobby &quot;white boy&quot; Bailey, a Western suitor and son of a circus owner. He relents when Bobby rescues Toyo from an escaped tiger. The Asian seductress, Madame de Sylva (Estelle Taylor), Tiger&#x27;s former wife and mother to Toyo—who abandoned her infant to be raised by Tiger—returns to lure Bobby from Toyo and ruin the couple&#x27;s plans for conjugal bliss. Tiger takes drastic action, unleashing a gorilla which dispatches Madame de Sylva but mortally wounds Tiger. He lives long enough witness the marriage of Toyo and Bobby.

In a key sequence in which the American Bobby Bailey (Lloyd Hughes), nicknamed &quot;white boy&quot;, is briefly seduced by the Asian Madame de Sylva (mother to Bobby&#x27;s fiancee Toya), Browning offers a cliche-ridden intertitle exchange that is belied by his cinematic treatment. Film historian Stefan Brandt writes: &quot;Browning here plays with the ambiguities involved in the common misreading of Kipling&#x27;s poem, encouraging his American audience to question the existing patterns of colonial discourse and come to conclusions that go beyond that mode of thinking. The romantic version of the Orient as a land of eternal mysticism is exposed here as a Eurocentric illusion that we must not fall prey to.&quot;

Browning&#x27;s presentation of the alluring Madame de Sylva -whose French title diverges from her Asian origins- introduces one of Browning&#x27;s primary themes: &quot;Reality vs. Appearance&quot;. Rosenthal notes that &quot;physical beauty masking perversity is identical to the usual Browning premise of respectability covering corruption. This is the formula used in &quot;Where East Is East&quot;. Tiger&#x27;s thorny face masks a wealth of kindness, sensitively and abiding paternal love. But behind the exotic beauty of Madame de Silva lies an unctuous, sinister manner and callous spitefulness.&quot;

The animal imagery with which Browning invests &quot;Where East Is East&quot; informed Lon Chaney&#x27;s characterization of Tiger Haynes, the name alone identifying him as both &quot;tiger hunter and the tiger himself.&quot; Biographer Stuart Rosenthal comments on the Browning-Chaney characterization of Tiger Haynes:

As in Browning&#x27;s &quot;The Unknown&quot; (1927) in which protagonist Alonzo is trampled to death by a horse, &quot;animals become the agents of destruction for Tiger [Haynes] in &quot;Where East Is East&quot;.&quot;

== Sound films: 1929–1939 ==
Upon completing &quot;Where East Is East&quot;, MGM prepared to make his first sound production, &quot;The Thirteenth Chair&quot; (1929). The question as to Browning&#x27;s adaptability to the film industry&#x27;s ineluctable transition to sound technology is disputed among film historians.

Biographers David Skal and Elias Savada report that Browning &quot;had made his fortune as a silent film director but had considerable difficulties in adapting his talents to talking pictures.&quot; Film critic Vivian Sobchack notes that Browning, in both his silent and sound creations, &quot;starts with the visual rather than the narrative&quot; and cites director Edgar G. Ulmer: &quot;until the end of his career, Browning tried to avoid using dialogue; he wanted to obtain visual effects.&quot; Biographer Jon Towlson argues that Browning&#x27;s 1932 Freaks reveals &quot;a director in full control of the [sound] medium, able to use the camera to reveal a rich subtext beneath the dialogue&quot; and at odds with the general assessment of the filmmakers post-silent era pictures.

Browning&#x27;s sound oeuvre consists of nine features before his retirement from filmmaking in 1939.

=== &quot;The Thirteenth Chair &quot;(1929) ===

Browning&#x27;s first sound film, &quot;The Thirteenth Chair&quot; is based on a 1916 &quot;drawing room murder mystery&quot; stage play of the same title by Bayard Veiller first adapted to film in a 1919 silent version and later a sound remake in 1937.

Set in Calcutta, the story concerns two homicides committed at séances. Illusion and deception are employed to expose the murderer.

In a cast featuring some of MGM&#x27;s top contract players including Conrad Nagel, Leila Hyams and Margaret Wycherly Hungarian-American Bela Lugosi, a veteran of silent films and the star of Broadway&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; (1924) was enlisted by Browning to play Inspector Delzante, when Lon Chaney declined to yet embark on a talking picture.

The first of his three collaborations with Lugosi, Browning&#x27;s handling of the actor&#x27;s role as Delzante anticipated the part of Count Dracula in his &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931). Browning endows Lugosi&#x27;s Delzante with bizarre eccentricities, including a guttural, broken English and heavily accented eyebrows, characteristics that Lugosi made famous in his film roles as vampires. Film historian Alfred Eaker remarks: &quot;Serious awkwardness mars this film, a product from that transitional period from silent to the new, imposing medium of sound. Because of that awkwardness &quot;The Thirteenth Chair&quot; is not Browning in best form.&quot;

=== &quot;Outside the Law&quot; (1930) ===
A remake of Browning&#x27;s 1921 silent version starred Priscilla Dean and Lon Chaney who appeared in dual roles. &quot;Outside the Law&quot; concerns a criminal rivalry among gangsters. It stars Edward G. Robinson as Cobra Collins and Mary Nolan as his moll Connie Madden. Film critic Alfred Eaker commented that Browning&#x27;s remake &quot;received comparatively poor reviews.&quot;

=== &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931): The first talkie horror picture ===
Browning&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; initiated the modern horror genre, and it remains his only &quot;one true horror film.&quot; Today the picture stands as the first of Browning&#x27;s two sound era masterpieces, rivaled only by his &quot;Freaks&quot; (1932). The picture set in motion Universal Studios&#x27; highly lucrative production of vampire and monster movies during the 1930s. Browning approached Universal&#x27;s Carl Laemmle Jr. in 1930 to organize a film version of Bram Stoker&#x27;s 1897 gothic horror novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, previously adapted to film by director F. W. Murnau in 1922.

In an effort to avoid copyright infringement lawsuits, Universal opted to base the film on Hamilton Deane&#x27;s and Louis Bromfield&#x27;s melodramatic stage version &quot;Dracula&quot; (1924), rather than Stoker&#x27;s novel.

Actor Lon Chaney, then completing his first sound film with director Jack Conway in a remake of Browning&#x27;s silent &quot;The Unholy Three&quot; (1925), was tapped for the role of Count Dracula. Terminally ill from lung cancer, Chaney entered negotiations for the project. The actor died a few short weeks before shooting was set to commence on &quot;Dracula&quot; — a significant personal and professional loss to long-time collaborator Browning. Hungarian expatriate and actor Bela Ferenc Deszo Blasco, appearing under the stage name Bela Lugosi, had successfully performed the role of Count Dracula in the American productions of the play for three years. According to film historian David Thomson, &quot;when Chaney died, it was taken for granted that Lugosi would have the role in the film.&quot;

Lugosi&#x27;s portrayal of Count Dracula is inextricably linked to the vampire genre established by Browning. As film critic Elizabeth Bronfen observes, &quot;the notoriety of Browning&#x27;s Dracula within film history resides above all else in the uncanny identification between Bela Lugosi and his role.&quot; Browning quickly establishes what would become Dracula&#x27;s— and Bela Lugosi&#x27;s—&quot;sine qua non&quot;: &quot;The camera repeatedly focuses on Dracula&#x27;s hypnotic gaze, which, along with his idiosyncratic articulation, was to become his cinematic trademark.&quot; Film historian Alec Charles observes that &quot;The first time we see Bela Lugosi in Tod Browning&#x27;s Dracula...he looks almost directly into the camera...Browning affords the audience the first of those famously intense and direct into-the-camera Lugosi looks, a style of gaze that would be duplicated time and again by the likes of Christopher Lee and Lugosi&#x27;s lesser imitators...&quot; Lugosi embraced his screen persona as the preeminent &quot;aristocratic Eastern European vampire&quot; and welcomed his typecasting, assuring his &quot;artistic legacy&quot;.

Film critic Elizabeth Bronfen reports that Browning&#x27;s cinematic interpretation of the script has been widely criticized by film scholars. Browning is cited for failing to provide adequate &quot;montage or shot/reverse shots&quot;, the &quot;incoherence of the narrative&quot; and his putative poor handling of the &quot;implausible dialogue&quot; reminiscent of &quot;filmed theatre.&quot; Bronfen further notes critic&#x27;s complaints that Browning failed to visually record the iconic vampiric catalog: puncture wounds on a victims necks, the imbibing of fresh blood, a stake penetrating the heart of Count Dracula. Moreover, no &quot;transformation scenes&quot; are visualized in which the undead or vampires morph into wolves or bats.

Film critics have attributed these &quot;alleged faults&quot; to Browning&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm for the project. Actor Helen Chandler, who plays Dracula&#x27;s mistress, Mina Seward, commented that Browning seemed disengaged during shooting, and left the direction to cinematographer Karl Freund.

Bronfen emphasizes the &quot;financial constraints&quot; imposed by Universal executives, strictly limiting authorization for special effects or complex technical shots, and favoring a static camera requiring Browning to &quot;shoot in sequence&quot; in order to improve efficiency. Bronfen suggests that Browning&#x27;s own thematic concerns may have prompted him—in this, &#x27;the first talkie horror picture&#x27;—to privilege the spoken word over visual tricks.&quot;:

The scenario follows the vampire Count Dracula to England where he preys upon members of the British upper-middle class, but is confronted by nemesis Professor Van Helsing, (Edward Van Sloan) who possesses sufficient will power and knowledge of vampirism to defeat Count Dracula. Film historian Stuart Rosenthal remarks that &quot;the Browning version of Dracula retains the Victorian formality of the original source in the relationships among the normal characters. In this atmosphere the seething, unstoppable evil personified by the Count is a materialization of Victorian morality&#x27;s greatest dread.&quot;

A number of sequences in &quot;Dracula&quot; have earned special mention, despite criticism concerning the &quot;static and stagy quality of the film.&quot; The dramatic and sinister opening sequence in which the young solicitor Renfield (Dwight Frye) is conveyed in a coach to Count Dracula&#x27;s Transylvanian castle is one of the most discussed and praised of the picture. Karl Freund&#x27;s Expressionistic technique is largely credited with its success.

Browning employs &quot;a favorite device&quot; with an animal montage early in the film to establish a metaphoric equivalence between the emergence of the vampires from their crypts and the small parasitic vermin that infest the castle: spiders, wasps and rats. Unlike Browning&#x27;s previous films, &quot;Dracula&quot; is not a &quot;long series of [illusionist] tricks, performed and explained&quot; but rather an application of cinematic effects &quot;presenting vampirism as scientifically verified &#x27;reality&#x27;.&quot;

Despite Universal executives editing out portions of Browning&#x27;s film, Dracula was enormously successful. Opening at New York City&#x27;s Roxy Theatre, &quot;Dracula&quot; earned $50,000 in 48 hours, and was Universal&#x27;s most lucrative film of the Depression Era. Five years after its release, it had grossed over one million dollars worldwide. Film critic Dennis Harvey writes: &quot;Dracula&#x27;s enormous popularity fast-tracked Browning&#x27;s return to MGM, under highly favorable financial terms and the protection of longtime ally, production chief Irving Thalberg.&quot;

=== &quot;Iron Man&quot; (1931) ===
The last of Browning&#x27;s three sound films he directed for Universal Studios, &quot;Iron Man&quot; (1931) is largely ignored in critical literature.

Described as &quot;a cautionary tale about the boxer as a physically powerful man brought down by a woman&quot;, Browning&#x27;s boxing story lacks the macabre elements that typically dominate his cinema. Film historian Vivian Sobchack observes that &quot;Iron Man, in subject and plot, is generally regarded as uncharacteristic of Browning&#x27;s other work.&quot; Thematically, however, the picture exhibits a continuity consistent with his obsessive interest in &quot;situations of moral and sexual frustration.&quot;

Film critic Leger Grindon cites the four &quot;subsidiary motifs&quot; recognized by Browning biographer Stuart Rosenthal: &quot;appearances hiding truth (particularly physical beauty as a mask for villainy), sexual frustration, opposing tendencies within a protagonist that are often projected onto alter egos and finally, an inability to assign guilt.&quot; These themes are evident in Iron Man.

Actor Lew Ayres, following his screen debut in Universal&#x27;s immensely successful anti-war themed &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930), plays Kid Mason, a Lightweight boxing champion. This sports-drama concerns the struggle between the Kid&#x27;s friend and manager George Regan Robert Armstrong, and the boxer&#x27;s adulterous wife Rose (Jean Harlow) to prevail in a contest for his affection and loyalty.

Rather than relying largely upon &quot;editing and composition as expressive tools&quot; Browning moved away from a stationary camera &quot;toward a conspicuous use of camera movement&quot; under the influence of Karl Freund, cinematographer on the 1931 &quot;Dracula&quot;. Iron Man exhibits this &quot;transformation&quot; in Browning&#x27;s cinematic style as he entered the sound era. Leger Grindon provides this assessment of Browning&#x27;s last picture for Universal:
Though box office earnings for &quot;Iron Man&quot; are unavailable, a measure of its success is indicated in the two remakes the film inspired: &quot;Some Blondes Are Dangerous&quot; (1937) and &quot;Iron Man&quot; (1950).

Browning returned to MGM after completing &quot;Iron Man&quot; to embark upon the most controversial film of his career: &quot;Freaks&quot; (1932).

=== Magnum opus: &quot;Freaks&quot; (1932) ===


After the spectacular success of &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931) at Universal, Browning returned to MGM, lured by a generous contract and enjoying the auspices of production manager Irving Thalberg. Anticipating a repeat of his recent success at Universal, Thalberg accepted Browning&#x27;s story proposal based on Tod Robbins&#x27; circus-themed tale &quot;Spurs&quot; (1926).

The studio purchased the rights and enlisted screenwriter Willis Goldbeck and Leon Gordon to develop the script with Browning. Thalberg collaborated closely with the director on pre-production, but Browning completed all the actual shooting on the film without interference from studio executives. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s president, Louis B. Mayer, registered his disgust with the project from its inception and during the filming, but Thalberg successfully intervened on Browning&#x27;s behalf to proceed with the film. The picture that emerged was Browning&#x27;s &quot;most notorious and bizarre melodrama.&quot;

A &quot;morality play&quot;, &quot;Freaks&quot; centers around the cruel seduction of a circus sideshow midget Hans (Harry Earles) by a statuesque trapeze artist Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova). She and her lover, strongman Hercules (Henry Victor), scheme to murder the diminutive Hans for his inheritance money after sexually humiliating him. The community of freaks mobilizes in Hans&#x27; defense, meting out severe justice to Cleopatra and Hercules: the former trapeze beauty is surgically transformed into a sideshow freak.
Browning enlisted a cast of performers largely assembled from carnival freak shows—a community and milieu both of which the director was intimately familiar. The circus freaks serve as dramatic and comedic players, central to the story&#x27;s development, and do not appear in their respective sideshow routines as novelties.

Two major themes in Browning&#x27;s work—&quot;Sexual Frustration&quot; and &quot;Reality vs. Appearances&quot;—emerge in &quot;Freaks&quot; from the conflict inherent in the physical incompatibility between Cleopatra and Hans.
The guileless Hans&#x27; self-delusional fantasy of winning the affection of Cleopatra—&quot;seductive, mature, cunning and self-assured&quot;—provokes her contempt, eliciting &quot;cruel sexual jests&quot; at odds with her attractive physical charms. Browning provides the moral rationale for the final reckoning with Cleopatra &quot;before&quot; she has discovered Hans&#x27; fortune and plans to murder him. Film historian Stuart Rosenthal explains:

Browning addresses another theme fundamental to his work: &quot;Inability to Assign Guilt&quot;. The community of freaks delay judgement on Cleopatra when she insults Frieda (Daisy Earles), the midget performer who loves Hans. Their social solidarity cautions restraint, but when the assault on Hans becomes egregious, they act single-mindedly to punish the offender. Browning exonerates the freaks of any guilt: they are &quot;totally justified&quot; in their act of retribution. Stuart Rosenthal describes this doctrine, the &quot;crux&quot; of Browning&#x27;s social ideal:

Browning cinematic style in &quot;Freaks&quot; is informed by the precepts of German Expressionism, combining a subdued documentary-like realism with &quot;chiaroscuro shadow&quot; for dramatic effect.

The wedding banquet sequence in which Cleopatra and Hercules brutally degrade Hans is &quot;among the most discussed moments of &quot;Freaks&quot;&quot; and according to biographer Vivian Sobchack &quot;a masterpiece of sound and image, and utterly unique in conception and realization.&quot;

The final sequence in which the freaks carry out their &quot;shocking&quot; revenge and Cleopatra&#x27;s fate is revealed &quot;achieves the most sustained level of high-pitched terror of any Browning picture.&quot;

&quot;Freaks&quot; was given general release only after Thalberg excised 30 minutes of footage deemed offensive to the public.
Though Browning had a long history of making profitable pictures at MGM, Freaks was a &quot;disaster&quot; at the box office, though earning mixed reviews among critics.

Browning&#x27;s reputation as a reliable filmmaker among the Hollywood establishment was tarnished, and he completed only four more pictures before retiring from the industry after 1939. According to biographer Alfred Eaker, &quot;&quot;Freaks&quot;, in effect, ended Browning&#x27;s career.&quot;

=== &quot;Fast Workers&quot; (1933) ===
In the aftermath of the commercial failure of his 1932 &quot;Freaks&quot;, Browning was assigned to produce and direct (uncredited) an adaptation of John McDermott&#x27;s play &quot;Rivets&quot;.

The script for &quot;Fast Workers&quot; by Karl Brown and Laurence Stallings dramatizes the mutual infidelities, often humorous, that plague a ménage à trois comprising a high-rise construction worker and seducer Gunner Smith (John Gilbert), his co-worker and sidekick, Bucker Reilly (Robert Armstrong) and Mary (Mae Clarke), an attractive &quot;Gold digger&quot; seeking financial and emotional stability during the Great Depression. Browning brings to bear all the thematic modes that typically motivate his characters. Film historian Stuart Rosenthal writes:

The betrayals, humiliations and retaliations that plague the characters, and the moral legitimacy of their behaviors remains unresolved. Rosenthal comments on Browning&#x27;s ambivalence: &quot;&quot;Fast Workers&quot; is Browning&#x27;s final cynical word on the impossibility of an individual obtaining justice, however righteous his cause, without critically sullying himself. Superficially, things have been set right. Gunner and Bucker are again friends and, together are equal to any wily female. Yet Gunner, the individual who is the most culpable, finds himself in the most secure position, while the basically well-intentioned Mary is rejected and condemned by both men.&quot; An outstanding example of Browning&#x27;s ability to visually convey terror—a technique he developed in the silent era—is demonstrated when Mary perceives that Bucker, cuckolded by Gunner, reveals his homicidal rage.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer committed $525,000 to the film&#x27;s production budget, quite a high sum for a relatively short feature. Ultimately, MGM reported earnings of only $165,000 on the film after its release, resulting in a net loss of $360,000 on the motion picture.

=== &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot; (1935) ===
Browning returned to a vampire-themed picture with his 1935 &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot;. Rather than risk a legal battle with Universal Studios who held the rights to Browning&#x27;s 1931 &quot;Dracula&quot;, he opted for a reprise of his successful silent era &quot;London After Midnight&quot; (1927), made for MGM and starring Lon Chaney in a dual role.

With &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot;, Browning follows the plot conceit employed in &quot;London After Midnight&quot;: An investigator and hypnotist seeks to expose a murderer by means of a &quot;vampire masquerade&quot; so as to elicit his confession. Browning deviates from his 1927 silent film in that here the sleuth, Professor Zelen (Lionel Barrymore), rather than posing as a vampire himself in a dual role, hires a troupe of talented thespians to stage an elaborate hoax to deceive the murder suspect Baron Otto von Zinden (Jean Hersholt). Bela Lugosi was enlisted to play the lead vampire in the troupe, Count Moro.
As a direct descendant of Browning&#x27;s carnival-themed films, Browning offers the movie audience a generous dose of Gothic iconography: &quot;hypnotic trances, flapping bats, spooky graveyards, moaning organs, cobwebs thick as curtains – and bound it all together with bits of obscure Eastern European folklore...&quot;

As such, &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot; leads the audience to suspend disbelief in their skepticism regarding vampires through a series of staged illusions, only to sharply disabuse them of their credulity in the final minutes of the movie. Browning reportedly composed the conventional plot scenes as he would a stage production, but softened the static impression through the editing process. In scenes that depicted the supernatural, Browning freely used a moving camera. Film historian Matthew Sweney observes &quot;the [special] effects shots...overpower the static shots in which the film&#x27;s plot and denouement take place...creating a visual tension in the film.&quot;

Cinematographer James Wong Howe&#x27;s lighting methods endowed the film with a spectral quality that complimented Browning&#x27;s &quot;sense of the unreal&quot;.
Critic Stuart Rosenthal writes:

&quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot; is widely cited for its famous &quot;tracking shot on the stairwell&quot; in which Count Mora (Bela Lugosi) and his daughter Luna (Carol Borland) descend in a stately promenade. Browning inter-cuts their progress with images of vermin and venomous insects, visual equivalents for the vampires as they emerge from their own crypts in search of sustenance. Rosenthal describes the one-minute sequence:

In another notable and &quot;exquisitely edited&quot; scene Browning presents a lesbian-inspired seduction. Count Mora, in the form of a bat, summons Luna to the cemetery where Irene Borotyn (Elizabeth Allan) (daughter of murder victim Sir Karell, awaits in a trance.) When vampire Luna avidly embraces her victim, Count Moro voyeuristically looks on approvingly. Borland&#x27;s Luna would inspire the character Morticia in the TV series &quot;The Addams Family&quot;.

The soundtrack for &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot; is notable in that it employs no orchestral music aside from accompanying the opening and closing credits. Melodic passages, when heard, are provided only by the players. The sound effects provided by recording director Douglas Shearer contribute significantly to the film&#x27;s ambiance.

Film historian Matthew Sweney writes:

The climatic &quot;coup-de-grace&quot; occurs when the murderer&#x27;s incredulity regarding the existence of vampires is reversed when Browning cinematically creates an astonishing illusion of the winged Luna in flight transforming into a human. The rationalist Baron Otto, a witness to this legerdemain, is converted into a believer in the supernatural and ultimately confesses, under hypnosis, to the murder of his brother Sir Karell.

In the final five minutes of &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot;, the theatre audience is confronted with the &quot;theatrical trap&quot; that Browning has laid throughout the picture: none of the supernatural elements of film are genuine—the &quot;vampires&quot; are merely actors engaged in a deception. This is made explicit when Bela Lugosi, no longer in character as Count Moro, declares to a fellow actor: &quot;Did you see me? I was greater than any real vampire!&quot;

=== &quot;The Devil-Doll&quot; (1936) ===

Browning created a work reminiscent of his collaborations with actor Lon Chaney in the &quot;bizarre melodrama&quot; &quot;The Devil-Doll&quot;.

Based on the novel &quot;Burn, Witch, Burn&quot; (1932) by Abraham Merritt, the script was crafted by Browning with contributions from Garrett Fort, Guy Endore and Erich von Stroheim (director of &quot;Greed&quot; (1924) and &quot;Foolish Wives&quot; (1922)), and &quot;although it has its horrific moments, like &quot;Freaks&quot; (1932), &quot;The Devil-Doll&quot; is not a horror film.&quot;

In &quot;The Devil-Doll&quot;, Browning borrows a number of the plot devices from his 1925 The Unholy Three.

Paul Lavond (Lionel Barrymore) has spent 17 years incarcerated at Devil&#x27;s Island, framed for murder and embezzlement committed by his financial associates. He escapes from the prison with fellow inmate, the ailing Marcel (Henry B. Walthall). The terminally ill scientist divulges to Lavond his secret formula for transforming humans into miniature, animated puppets. In alliance with Marcel&#x27;s widow Malita (Rafaela Ottiano), the vengeful Lavond unleashes an army of tiny living &quot;dolls&quot; to exact a terrible retribution against the three &quot;unholy&quot; bankers. Biographer Vivian Sobchack acknowledges that &quot;the premises on which the revenge plot rest are incredible, but the visual realization is so fascinating that we are drawn, nonetheless, into a world that seems quite credible and moving&quot; and reminds viewers that &quot;there are some rather comic scenes in the film...&quot;

Barrymore&#x27;s dual role as Lavond and his cross-dressing persona, the elderly Madame Mandilip, a doll shop proprietor, is strikingly similar to Lon Chaney&#x27;s Professor Echo and his transvestite counterpart &quot;Granny&quot; O&#x27;Grady, a parrot shop owner in &quot;The Unholy Three&quot; (1925).
 Film critic Stuart Rosenthal notes that Browning recycling of this characterization as a plot device &quot;is further evidence for the interchangeability of Browning&#x27;s heroes, all of whom would act identically if given the same set of circumstances.&quot;

Thematically, &quot;The Devil-Doll&quot; presents a version of Browning &quot;indirect&quot; sexual frustration. Here, Lavond&#x27;s daughter Lorraine (Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan), ignorant of her father&#x27;s identity, remains so. Stuart Rothenthal explains:

Rosenthal points out another parallel between &quot;The Devil-Doll&quot; and &quot;The Unholy Three&quot; (1925): &quot;Lavond&#x27;s concern for his daughter and refusal to misuse his powers mark him as a good man...when his revenge is complete, like Echo [in &quot;The Unholy Three&quot;], Lavond demonstrates a highly beneficent nature.&quot;

Browning proficient use of the camera and the remarkable special effects depicting the &quot;miniature&quot; people are both disturbing and fascinating, directed with &quot;eerie skill.&quot;

Film historians Stefanie Diekmann and Ekkehard Knörer report that the only direct link between Browning&#x27;s fascination with &quot;the grotesque, the deformed and the perverse&quot; and the traditions of the French Grand Guignol is actor Rafaela Ottiano who plays doll-obsessed scientist Matila. Before her supporting role in &quot;The Devil-Doll&quot;, she enjoyed &quot;a distinguished career as a Grand Guignol performer.&quot;

Shortly after the completion of &quot;The Devil-Doll&quot;, Irving Thalberg, Browning&#x27;s mentor at MGM, died at age 37. It would be two years before his final film: &quot;Miracles for Sale&quot; (1939).

=== &quot;Miracles for Sale&quot; (1939) ===
&quot;Miracles for Sale&quot; (1939) was the last of Browning&#x27;s 46 feature films since he began directing in 1917.
Browning&#x27;s career had been in abeyance for two years after completing &quot;The Devil-Doll&quot; in 1936.

In 1939, he was tasked with adapting Clayton Rawson&#x27;s locked-room mystery, &quot;Death from a Top Hat&quot; (1938).

Robert Young appears as &quot;The Amazing Morgan&quot;, a conjurer and &quot;purveyor of magic show equipment.&quot; Florence Rice plays the ingenue, Judy Barkley. In this, his cinematic &quot;swan song&quot;, Browning &quot;revisits obsessive, familiar themes of fake spiritualism, magic acts [and] transformation through disguises...&quot; and, as with virtually all of Browning&#x27;s explorations of the arts of illusion and the &quot;realms of theatrical magic&quot;, his denoumae provides &quot;an impirical solution&quot; to the mystery murder.

&quot;Miracles for Sale&quot; opens with a startling sequence that includes a graphic illusion depicting a &quot;below-the-waist mutilation.&quot; Film critic Stuart Rosenthal writes:

Despite this &quot;inspired jolt&quot; at the film&#x27;s outset, &quot;Miracles for Sale&quot; is the most &quot;studio bound&quot; of Browning&#x27;s sound oeuvre, and according to film critic Stuart Rosenhal &quot;the only Browning production that really looks like an MGM studio job...&quot;

&quot;Miracles for Sale&quot; lost money at the box-office, returning only $39,000 to MGM on a $297,000 investment. Critical evaluation was generally positive.

By the early 1940s, Browning&#x27;s macabre sensibilities were no longer welcome in a Hollywood that was striving for &quot;glamour and prestige.&quot; Browning was summarily terminated at MGM by producer Carey Wilson after the release of Miracles for Sale and was, by the director&#x27;s own account &quot;blackballed&quot; from Hollywood as a filmmaker. Stephanie Diekmann and Ekkehard Knörer offer this assessment of Browning&#x27;s final cinematic effort:

Film historian Alfred Eaker adds that &quot;the entire structure of &quot;Miracles for Sale&quot; is an illusion itself, making it a sublime curtain call for the director...&quot;

Browning occasionally offered screenplays to MGM, but eventually disengaged entirely from the film industry and in 1942 retired to his home in Malibu, California.

== Final years and death ==
Browning&#x27;s wife Alice died in 1944 from complications from pneumonia, leaving him a recluse at his Malibu Beach retreat. By that time Browning had become so isolated from the Hollywood establishment that &quot;Variety&quot; mistakenly published an obituary that year for Browning, confusing his spouse&#x27;s death for that of the former director.

In 1949, the Directors Guild of America bestowed a life membership on Browning; at the time of his death, the honor had been enjoyed by only four of Browning&#x27;s colleagues.

Browning, now a widower, lived in isolation for almost 20 years, &quot;an alcoholic recluse.&quot; In 1962 he was diagnosed with cancer of the larynx. The surgical procedure performed to correct the condition rendered him mute.

Tod Browning died alone at his Malibu home on October 6, 1962. He is interred at Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery.

== Posthumous critical appraisal ==
Vivian Sobchack wrote: &quot;...Browning was sometimes called the Edgar Allan Poe of the cinema&#x27; [and] much admired by the surrealists. Browning&#x27;s creations were, of course, a commercial cinema as well. The films suggest a man of humor and compassion who had a dark and melancholic fascination with physical deformity and with the exotic and extraordinary, and yet who observed the oddities of life with unprejudiced objectivity and some delight. A Southerner who ran away with the circus; a former Vaudevillian and magician who traveled the world before he became a filmmaker, a [literary] aesthete and a beer drinker, above all a storyteller, Browning was both a poet and a pragmatist.&quot; She identifies four plots or mise-en-scène in which Browning presents his themes:
Sobchack points out that the plot synopsis for these films, considered independently of their cinematic treatments, appear &quot;ludicrous&quot; or &quot;bizarre&quot; in conception. Browning&#x27;s handling of the material, however, produce &quot;powerful and disturbing realizations on the screen.&quot;

The melodramas that Browning wrote and directed for MGM and Universal are formulaic manifestations of his &quot;compulsive&quot; preoccupation with themes of &quot;moral and sexual frustration, interchangeable guilt [and] patterns of human repulsion and attraction.&quot;

Alfred Eaker found: &quot;Browning himself continues to be dismissed by less insightful critics, who evaluate the man and his work by contemporary entertainment standards or even accuse the great empathetic artist of exploitation. Browning&#x27;s standing still remains low. Neither he, nor any of his films have received a single honor by a major film recognition or preservation institution.&quot;

According to Stuart Rosenthal: &quot;Although the work of any auteur will repeatedly emphasize specific thoughts and ideas, Browning is so aggressive and unrelenting in his pursuit of certain themes that he appears to be neurotically fixated on them. He is inevitably attracted to situations of moral and sexual frustration...[w]hat sets Browning apart is his abnormal fascination with the deformed creatures who populate his films—a fascination that is not always entirely intellectual, and one in which he takes extreme delight.&quot; Rosenthal offers this analysis of the director&#x27;s style and themes:

Rosenthal assigns four thematic categories to Browning&#x27;s films: 1) Reality vs. Appearance, in which an individual&#x27;s social exterior (physical beauty, the trappings of authority or professional status) are exposed as facades masking cruel or criminal behavior. (ex. &quot;The Unholy Three&quot; (1925), &quot;Where East Is East&quot; (1929)); 2) Sexual Frustration, often involving a &quot;sacred&quot; father-child or other kinship relation in which &quot;a man&#x27;s offspring represent extensions of his own sexuality&quot; provoking a protective response to sexual insults from outsiders. (ex. &quot;The Road to Mandalay&quot; (1926), &quot;West of Zanzibar&quot; (1928)).; 3) Conflict of Opposing Tendencies within an Individual, leading to a loss of identity when irreconcilable character traits in a person produces alter egos. Author Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; explores this &quot;intractable frustration.&quot; (ex. &quot;Outside the Law&quot; (1921), &quot;The Blackbird&quot; (1926)).; and finally 4) Inability to Assign Guilt, in which a character resorts to violence or criminal acts in order to avenge injustice, and guilt or blame remains ambiguous. (ex. &quot;The Unknown&quot; (1927), &quot;Freaks&quot; (1932)) For Rosenthal, the factor that unifies all these thematic patterns is frustration: &quot;Frustration is Browning&#x27;s dominant theme.&quot;

<doc id="31505" wikidata="Q1054844" url="?curid=31505" title="Taito">
<text>is a Japanese company that specializes in video games, toys, arcade cabinets, and game centers, based in Shinjuku, Tokyo. The company was founded by Michael Kogan in 1953 as the importing vodka, vending machines, and jukeboxes into Japan. It began production of video games in 1973. In 2005, Taito was purchased by Square Enix, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary by 2006.

Taito is recognized as an important industry influencer in the early days of video games, producing a number of hit arcade games such as &quot;Speed Race&quot; (1974), &quot;Western Gun&quot; (1975), &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978), &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; (1986), and &quot;Arkanoid&quot; (1986). Alongside Capcom, Konami, Namco, and Sega, it is one of the most prominent video game companies from Japan and the first that exported its games into other countries. Several of its games have since been recognized as important and revolutionary for the industry – &quot;Space Invaders&quot; in particular was a major contributor to the growth of video games in the late 1970s, and the aliens featured in the games are seen as iconic emblems within the video game industry.

The company maintains a chain of arcade centers, known as &quot;Taito Game Stations&quot;, across Japan, alongside being a manufacturer of toys, plush dolls and UFO-catcher prizes.

==History==
In 1944, a Jewish-Ukrainian businessman named Michael Kogan founded Taitung in Shanghai. A refugee of the Soviet Union, Kogan previously worked in a factory in Japan during the country&#x27;s involvement in World War II, before moving to Shanghai to join his father. Taitung, which translated to &quot;Taito&quot; in Japanese, dealt in floor coverings, natural hair wigs, and hog bristles.

===1950s–1960s===
The Communist takeover of China prompted Kogan to liquidate the business in 1950 and move operations to Japan, which after the war was suffering a significant economic decline. The second business, a clothing distributor named Taito Yoko, struggled financially as a result of employee carelessness and constant loss of products. On August 24, 1953, Taito Yoko was abolished and replaced with the Taito Trading Company, where Kogan was joined by lawyer and retired newspaperman Akio Nakatani. Taito Trading Company began as a vodka distillery—the first company to produce vodka in Japan—and an importer of peanut vending machines and perfume machines.

Increasing competition led to Taito abandoning the vodka business in 1955 and focusing on its successful vending machines, in addition to importing jukeboxes. As Taito lacked a proper license to import jukeboxes into Japan, it purchased broken-down machines from United States military bases and refurbished them with working parts from defective units. The recovering Japanese economy allowed Taito to become the official distributor of AMI jukeboxes in the country. Though the deal had little impact at first, over 1,500 machines were sold by 1960 when the company began mixing Japanese records with American folk songs. A partnership with the Seeburg Corporation made Taito its exclusive agent in Japan and one of the nation&#x27;s leading jukebox companies.

Taito began manufacturing electro-mechanical games (EM games) in the 1960s. In 1967, they released &quot;Crown Soccer Special&quot; (1967), a two-player sports game that simulated association football using electronic components such as pinball flippers. In 1968, &quot;Crown Basketball&quot; debuted in the US as the highest-earning arcade game at the 1968 Tampa Fair.

===1970s–1980s===
Taito changed its name from Taito Trading Company to Taito Corporation in August 1972. It established its American subsidiary in 1973 in downtown Chicago, Taito America.

====First video game====
Taito&#x27;s first video game was called &quot;Elepong&quot;. It is a ping-pong arcade cabinet released in 1973 in Japan.
Tomohiro Nishikado, a Tokyo Denki University engineering graduate who joined the company in 1968, was instrumental in the company&#x27;s transition to video games. After developing the hit electro-mechanical target shooting games &quot;Sky Fighter&quot; (1971) and &quot;Sky Fighter II&quot;, his bosses at Taito believed transistor-transistor logic (TTL) technology would play a significant role in the arcade industry, so they tasked Nishikado with investigating TTL technology as he was the company&#x27;s only employee who knew how to work with integrated circuit (IC) technology, and one of the few engineers at any Japanese coin-op company with significant expertise in solid-state electronics.

Nishikado spent six months dissecting Atari&#x27;s &quot;Pong&quot; arcade unit and learning how the game&#x27;s IC chips worked, and began modifying the game. This led to his development of the &quot;Pong&quot;-style sports video games &quot;Soccer&quot; and &quot;Davis Cup&quot; for Taito, with &quot;Soccer&quot; developed first but both released in November 1973. He then developed several original arcade video game hits for Taito, notably the sports game &quot;TV Basketball&quot; (1974), the racing game &quot;Speed Race&quot; (1974), and the shooter game &quot;Western Gun&quot; (1975); these three titles were localized by Midway Manufacturing in North America as &quot;TV Basketball&quot;, &quot;Wheels&quot;, and &quot;Gun Fight&quot;, respectively.

In 1978, Nishikado created &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, which became the company&#x27;s most popular title and one of the most popular games in arcade history, partially responsible for beginning the golden age of arcade video games. After Michael Kogan died in February 1984, his son, Abraham &quot;Abba&quot; Kogan, became Taito&#x27;s chairman and Akio Nakanishi became its president.
In April 1986 and barely a month after becoming part of the Kyocera group, Taito merged with two of its subsidiaries, Pacific Industrial Co., Ltd. and the Japan Vending Machine Co., Ltd, and absorbed them both. Japan Vending Machine was once an independent company but was purchased by Taito in July 1971 to strengthen its presence in the operation of amusement facilities. Pacific Industrial was created by Taito itself in 1963 to develop products for the company.

===1990s–2000s===
In 1992, Taito announced a CD-ROM-based video game console named WOWOW, that would have allowed people to play near-exact ports of Taito&#x27;s arcades (similar to the Neo Geo), as well as download games from a satellite transmission (as the Satellaview would do later). It was named after the Japanese television station WOWOW and would have utilized its stations to download games. The WOWOW was never released.

Taito America ceased operations in July 1996 after more than 20 years of existence. Taito had already sold exclusive rights for publishing its games in America to Acclaim Entertainment the previous year. Similarly, a division existed in London, England, United Kingdom to distribute Taito games in Europe. Taito (Europe) Corporation Limited was created in 1988 and liquidated in February 1998.

When Taito was owned by Kyocera, its headquarters were in Hirakawachō, Chiyoda. In October 2000, Taito merged with Kyocera Multimedia Corporation to enter the market of mobile phones for the first time.

In August 2005, it was announced that the gaming conglomerate Square Enix would purchase 247,900 Taito shares worth ¥45.16 billion (US$409.1 million), to make Taito Corporation a subsidiary of Square Enix. The purpose of the takeover by Square Enix was to both increase Taito&#x27;s profit margin exponentially as well as begin its company&#x27;s expansion into new forms of gaming, most notably, the arcade scene, and various other entertainment venues. The takeover bid from Square Enix was accepted by previous stockholder Kyocera, making Taito a Square Enix subsidiary. 

On September 22, 2005, Square Enix announced successfully acquiring 93.7% of all shares of Taito, effectively owning the company by September 28, 2005. In March 2006, Square Enix wanted to make Taito a wholly owned subsidiary. To accomplish this goal, Square Enix merged Taito into SQEX Corporation. Although the combined company took on the name &quot;Taito Corporation&quot;, it was actually Taito that was dissolved and SQEX that was the surviving entity. Taito became a subsidiary wholly owned by Square Enix and was delisted from the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

In July 2008, Square Enix announced that it would liquidate two subsidiaries of Taito, Taito Art Corporation (an insurance and travel agent subsidiary) and Taito Tech Co., Ltd. (an amusement and maintenance subsidiary) on the grounds that both had fulfilled their business purpose. The process ended in October 2008.

===2010s–present===
In February 2010, Taito&#x27;s unit for home video games split into a separate company called Taito Soft Corporation (not to be confused with Taito Software, the North American division of the late 1980s). On March 11, 2010, Taito Soft was folded into Square Enix. All of Taito&#x27;s franchises for video game consoles in Japan are since published by Square Enix.

Square Enix Holdings wanted all of its arcade operations to be regrouped into one subsidiary. The third and present Taito Corporation came to being on February 1, 2010, by merging the second company (formerly SQEX/Game Designers Studio) with ES1 Corporation. In an &quot;absorption-type company split&quot; move, the second company was split and renamed Taito Soft Corporation, while ES1 Corporation became the third Taito Corporation.

During its merger with the second company to become itself the new Taito Corporation, ES1 inherited all of Taito&#x27;s arcade and mobile businesses, and nearly the totality of its employees. On the other hand, Taito Soft Corporation (formerly SQEX) was left with 10 employees to concentrate exclusively on the development and publishing of video games for home consoles. Taito Soft Corporation was eventually merged into Square Enix in March 2010 and dissolved. ES1 Corporation was established on June 1, 2009, as an operator of arcade facilities. ES1 Corporation was owned by the shell company SPC1, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Square Enix Holdings. SCP1 dissolved when ES1 became Taito Corporation in February 2010. As such, the current Taito Corporation is technically the company formerly called ES1 Corporation.

On November 30, 2016, Taito announced that it will distribute &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Arkanoid&quot; for Facebook with Instant Games on Facebook Messenger and Facebook News Feed.

On July 3, 2018, Taito announced in Famitsu that it will return to the software publishing business for the eighth generation of video game consoles. The intention to return to the home console market came about because the company decided that it would be necessary to release Taito&#x27;s intellectual properties on current platforms in order to increase profit. The company has various properties planned in its software pipeline, from re-releases to new titles for various platforms; however, Taito highlighted that the console software market is a challenging business for the company. Taito intends to develop original games for consoles in the future.

<text>The Hulk is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character, who has dissociative identity disorder (DID), is primarily represented by the alter ego Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking, and muscular humanoid possessing a limitless degree of physical strength, and the alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, both of whom typically resent each other.

Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays while saving the life of Rick Jones during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will. This transformation often leads to destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner&#x27;s civilian life. The Hulk&#x27;s level of strength is usually conveyed proportionate to his anger level. Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk has been represented with other alter egos, from a mindless, destructive force ([[Horsemen of Apocalypse#Hulk|War]]) to a brilliant warrior (World-Breaker), a self-hating protector (the [[Devil Hulk]]), a genius scientist in his own right (Doc Green), and a gangster (Joe Fixit).

Despite Hulk and Banner&#x27;s desire for solitude, the character has a large supporting cast. This includes Banner&#x27;s love interest Betty Ross, his best friend, Rick Jones, his cousin She-Hulk, and therapist and ally Doc Samson. In addition, the Hulk alter ego has many key supporting characters, like his co-founders of the superhero team the Avengers, his queen Caiera, fellow warriors Korg and Miek, and sons Skaar and Hiro-Kala. However, his uncontrollable power has brought him into conflict with his fellow heroes and others. Despite this, he tries his best to do what&#x27;s right while battling villains such as the Leader, the Abomination, the Absorbing Man, and more.

Lee stated that the Hulk&#x27;s creation was inspired by a combination of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;. Although the Hulk&#x27;s coloration has varied throughout the character&#x27;s publication history, the usual color is green.

One of the most iconic characters in popular culture, the character has appeared on a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectable items, inspired real-world structures (such as theme park attractions), and been referenced in several media. Banner and the Hulk have been adapted into live-action, animated, and video game incarnations. The character was first played in live-action by Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno in the 1978 television series &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; and its subsequent television films &quot;The Incredible Hulk Returns&quot; (1988), &quot;The Trial of the Incredible Hulk&quot; (1989), and &quot;The Death of the Incredible Hulk&quot; (1990). In the film, the character was played by Eric Bana in &quot;Hulk&quot; (2003). In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the character was first portrayed by Edward Norton in the film &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (2008) and then by Mark Ruffalo in later appearances in the franchise.

==Publication history==
===Concept and creation===
The Hulk first appeared in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #1 (cover dated May 1962), written by writer-editor Stan Lee, penciled and co-plotted by Jack Kirby, and inked by Paul Reinman. Lee cites influence from &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; in the Hulk&#x27;s creation:


Kirby also stated the Frankenstein inspiration stating, &quot;I did a story called &quot;The Hulk&quot;– a small feature, and it was quite different from the Hulk that we know. But I felt that the Hulk had possibilities, and I took this little character from the small feature and I transformed it into the Hulk that we know today.
Of course, I was experimenting with it. I thought the Hulk might be a good-looking Frankenstein. I felt there&#x27;s a Frankenstein in all of us; I’ve seen it demonstrated. And I felt that the Hulk had the element of truth in it, and anything to me with the element of truth is valid and the reader relates to that. And if you dramatize it, the reader will enjoy it.&quot; Kirby also commented upon his influences in drawing the character, and recalled the inspiration of witnessing the hysterical strength of a mother lifting a car off her trapped child.

Lee has also compared Hulk to the Golem of Jewish mythology. In &quot;The Science of Superheroes&quot;, Gresh and Weinberg see the Hulk as a reaction to the Cold War and the threat of nuclear attack, an interpretation shared by Weinstein in &quot;Up, Up and Oy Vey&quot;. This interpretation corresponds with other popularized fictional media created during this time period, which took advantage of the prevailing sense among Americans that nuclear power could produce monsters and mutants.

In the debut, Lee chose grey for the Hulk because he wanted a color that did not suggest any particular ethnic group. Colorist Stan Goldberg, however, had problems with the grey coloring, resulting in different shades of grey, and even green, in the issue. After seeing the first published issue, Lee chose to change the skin color to green. Green was used in retellings of the origin, with even reprints of the original story being recolored for the next two decades, until &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; vol. 2, #302 (December 1984) reintroduced the grey Hulk in flashbacks set close to the origin story. An exception is the early trade paperback, &quot;Origins of Marvel Comics&quot;, from 1974, which explains the difficulties in keeping the grey color consistent in a Stan Lee-written prologue, and reprints the origin story keeping the grey coloration. Since December 1984, reprints of the first issue have displayed the original grey coloring, with the fictional canon specifying that the Hulk&#x27;s skin had initially been grey.

Lee gave the Hulk&#x27;s alter ego the alliterative name &quot;Bruce Banner&quot; because he found he had less difficulty remembering alliterative names. Despite this, in later stories he misremembered the character&#x27;s name and referred to him as &quot;Bob Banner&quot;, an error which readers quickly picked up on. The discrepancy was resolved by giving the character the official full name &quot;Robert Bruce Banner.&quot;

The Hulk got his name from a comic book character named The Heap who was a large green swamp monster.

===Series history===
The Hulk&#x27;s original series was canceled with issue #6 (March 1963). Lee had written each story, with Kirby penciling the first five issues and Steve Ditko penciling and inking the sixth. The character immediately guest-starred in &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #12 (March 1963), and months later became a founding member of the superhero team the Avengers, appearing in the first two issues of the team&#x27;s eponymous series (Sept. and Nov. 1963), and returning as an antagonist in issue #3 and as an ally in #5 (Jan.–May 1964). He then guest-starred in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #25–26 (April–May 1964), which revealed Banner&#x27;s full name as Robert Bruce Banner, and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #14 (July 1964).
Around this time, co-creator Kirby received a letter from a college dormitory stating the Hulk had been chosen as its official mascot. Kirby and Lee realized their character had found an audience in college-age readers.

A year and a half after &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; was canceled, the Hulk became one of two features in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;, beginning in issue #60 (Oct. 1964).

This new Hulk feature was initially scripted by Lee, with pencils by Steve Ditko and inks by George Roussos. Other artists later in this run included Jack Kirby (#68–87, June 1965 – Oct. 1966); Gil Kane (credited as &quot;Scott Edwards&quot;, #76, (Feb. 1966)); Bill Everett (#78–84, April–Oct. 1966); John Buscema (#85–87); and Marie Severin. The &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; run introduced the super-villains the Leader, who would become the Hulk&#x27;s nemesis, and the Abomination, another gamma-irradiated being. Marie Severin finished out the Hulk&#x27;s run in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;. Beginning with issue #102 (April 1968) the book was retitled &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; vol. 2, and ran until 1999, when Marvel canceled the series and launched &quot;Hulk&quot; #1. Marvel filed for a trademark for &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; in 1967, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the registration in 1970.

Len Wein wrote the series from 1974 through 1978, working first with Herb Trimpe, then, as of issue #194 (December 1975), with Sal Buscema, who was the regular artist for ten years. Issues #180–181 (Oct.–Nov. 1974) introduced Wolverine as an antagonist, who would go on to become one of Marvel Comics&#x27; most popular characters. In 1977, Marvel launched a second title, &quot;The Rampaging Hulk&quot;, a black-and-white comics magazine. This was originally conceived as a flashback series, set between the end of his original, short-lived solo title and the beginning of his feature in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;. After nine issues, the magazine was retitled &quot;The Hulk!&quot; and printed in color.

In 1977, two Hulk television films were aired to strong ratings, leading to an &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; TV series that aired from 1978 to 1982. A huge ratings success, the series introduced the popular Hulk catchphrase &quot;Don&#x27;t make me angry. You wouldn&#x27;t like me when I&#x27;m angry&quot;, and broadened the character&#x27;s popularity from a niche comic book readership into the mainstream consciousness.

Bill Mantlo became the series&#x27; writer for five years beginning with issue #245 (March 1980). Mantlo&#x27;s &quot;Crossroads of Eternity&quot; stories (#300–313 (Oct. 1984 – Nov. 1985)) explored the idea that Banner had suffered child abuse. Later Hulk writers Peter David and Greg Pak have called these stories an influence on their approaches to the character. Mantlo left the series for &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; and that series&#x27; writer John Byrne took over &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;. The final issue of Byrne&#x27;s six issue run featured the wedding of Bruce Banner and Betty Ross. Writer Peter David began a 12-year run with issue #331 (May 1987). He returned to the Roger Stern and Mantlo abuse storylines, expanding the damage caused, and depicting Banner as suffering dissociative identity disorder (DID).

In 1998, David killed off Banner&#x27;s long-time love Betty Ross. Marvel executives used Ross&#x27; death as an opportunity to pursue the return of the Savage Hulk. David disagreed, leading to his parting ways with Marvel. Also in 1998, Marvel relaunched &quot;The Rampaging Hulk&quot; as a standard comic book rather than as a comics magazine. &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; was again cancelled with issue #474 of its second volume in March 1999 and was replaced with a new series, &quot;Hulk&quot; the following month, with returning writer Byrne and art by Ron Garney. New series writer Paul Jenkins developed the Hulk&#x27;s multiple dissociative identities, and his run was followed by Bruce Jones with his run featuring Banner being pursued by a secret conspiracy and aided by the mysterious Mr. Blue. Jones appended his 43-issue &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; run with the limited series &quot;Hulk/Thing: Hard Knocks&quot; #1–4 (Nov. 2004 – Feb. 2005), which Marvel published after putting the ongoing series on hiatus. Peter David, who had initially signed a contract for the six-issue &quot;Tempest Fugit&quot; limited series, returned as writer when it was decided to make that story the first five parts of the revived (vol. 3). After a four-part tie-in to the &quot;House of M&quot; storyline and a one-issue epilogue, David left the series once more, citing the need to do non-Hulk work for the sake of his career.

Writer Greg Pak took over the series in 2006, leading the Hulk through several crossover storylines including &quot;Planet Hulk&quot; and &quot;World War Hulk&quot;, which left the Hulk temporarily incapacitated and replaced as the series&#x27; title character by the demigod Hercules in the retitled &quot;The Incredible Hercules&quot; (Feb. 2008). The Hulk returned periodically in &quot;Hulk&quot;, which then starred the new Red Hulk. In September 2009, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; was relaunched as &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (vol. 2) #600. The series was retitled &quot;The Incredible Hulks&quot; with issue #612 (Nov. 2010) to encompass the Hulk&#x27;s expanded family, and ran until issue #635 (Oct. 2011) when it was replaced with &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (vol. 3) (15 issues, Dec. 2011 – Dec. 2012) written by Jason Aaron with art by Marc Silvestri. As part of Marvel&#x27;s 2012 Marvel NOW! relaunch, a series called &quot;Indestructible Hulk&quot; (Nov. 2012) debuted under the creative team of Mark Waid and Leinil Yu. This series was replaced in 2014 with &quot;The Hulk&quot; by Waid and artist Mark Bagley.

A new series titled &quot;The Immortal Hulk&quot;, written by Al Ewing and drawn by Joe Bennett, was launched in 2018 and ran for 50 issues. The series had a spin-off one-shot &quot;Immortal She-Hulk&quot; and a spin-off series about Gamma Flight in June 2021.

In November 2021, Donny Cates became the new writer of &quot;Hulk&quot;, with Ryan Ottley joining as artist. In May 2022, the series did a crossover with the &quot;Thor&quot; series, also written by Cates, entitled &quot;Hulk vs Thor: Banner of War&quot;. The series ran for 14 issues, with Ottley taking over as writer for the last 4 issues afters Cates left the book.

In March 2023, it was announced that a new volume of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; would launch in June 2023, written by Phillip Kennedy Johnson and drawn by Nic Klein.

==Characterization==
===Fictional character biography===

Robert Bruce Banner&#x27;s psyche was profoundly affected by his troubled childhood, in which his father, Brian Banner, regarded him as a monster due to his seemingly unnatural intellect from a young age. These experiences caused Bruce to develop a dissociative identity disorder and repress his negative emotions as a coping mechanism. After Brian killed Bruce&#x27;s mother in a fit of rage, Bruce lived with several relatives up until his high school years, when his intelligence caught the attention of the United States Army. Banner was recruited to develop nuclear weapons under the authority of General Thaddeus &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross, and soon developed a relationship with the General&#x27;s daughter Betty Ross.

During the experimental detonation of a gamma bomb, Banner saves teenager Rick Jones, who was dared onto the testing field; Banner pushes Jones into a trench to save him, but is hit with the blast, absorbing massive amounts of gamma radiation. He awakens later seemingly unscathed, but he begins transforming into a powerful and destructive creature upon nightfall, which a pursuing soldier describes as a &quot;hulk&quot;. Banner&#x27;s attempts to cure himself of these transformations alter their conditions, causing Banner to transform as a response to rage or fear. The Hulk is a founding member of the Avengers, but quickly leaves the group due to their distrust of him. Banner maintains the secret of his dual identity with Rick&#x27;s aid, but Rick reveals his secret following his assumed death to Major Glenn Talbot who subsequently informed his superiors, forcing Banner to become a fugitive upon returning from the future where he was actually thrown to.

Psychiatrist Doc Samson captures the Hulk and manages to physically separate Banner and the Hulk, allowing Banner to marry Betty. However, Banner and the Hulk&#x27;s molecular structure destabilized and threatened to kill them, requiring Samson to reunite them with the aid of Vision. Samson is later able to merge elements of Banner&#x27;s fractured psyche to create Professor Hulk, an intelligent but egocentric variation of the Hulk. Professor Hulk soon becomes a key member of the Pantheon, a secretive organization of superpowered individuals. His tenure with the organization brings him into conflict with a tyrannical alternate future version of himself called the Maestro, who rules over a world where many heroes are dead. The Professor Hulk construct ultimately proves unstable, and Banner&#x27;s psyche eventually splinters once more.

In &quot;Planet Hulk&quot;, the Illuminati decide the Hulk is too dangerous to remain on Earth and send him away by rocket ship which crashes on Planet Sakaar. The Hulk finds allies in the Warbound and marries alien queen Caiera, a relationship that bears him two sons: Skaar and Hiro-Kala. After the Illuminati&#x27;s ship explodes and kills Caiera, the Hulk returns to Earth with his superhero group Warbound and declares war on the planet in &quot;World War Hulk&quot;. However, after learning that Miek, one of the Warbound, had actually been responsible for the destruction, the Hulk allows himself to be defeated, with Banner subsequently redeeming himself as a hero as he works with and against the new Red Hulk to defeat the new supervillain team the Intelligencia.

Later, the Hulk turns to Doctor Doom to separate himself and Banner, with Doom surgically extracting the elements of the Hulk&#x27;s brain uniquely belonging to Banner and inserting them into a clone body. Banner eventually re-combines with the Hulk when his cloned body is destroyed in an attempt to recreate his original transformation. Following this, Bruce willingly joins the spy organization S.H.I.E.L.D., allowing them to use the Hulk as a weapon in exchange for providing him with the means and funding to create a lasting legacy for himself. When Banner is shot in the head by an assassin, Tony Stark saves him with a variant of the Extremis virus. This procedure creates a new intelligent persona named Doc Green, who concludes that the world is in danger by Gamma Mutates and thus need to be depowered. He creates a cure and depowers A-Bomb (Rick Jones), Skaar, and Red Hulk. Eventually, Doc Green&#x27;s intellect fades and his normal Hulk form is restored.

When the vision of the Inhuman Ulysses shows a rampaging Hulk standing over the corpses of many superheroes, Banner gives Hawkeye special arrows capable of killing him during a transformation, which Hawkeye accomplishes. The Hulk was first revived by the Hand, then by Hydra, and finally by the Challenger for a contest against the Grandmaster.

===Personality===
Like other long-lived characters, the Hulk&#x27;s character and cultural interpretations have changed with time, adding or modifying character traits. The Hulk is typically seen as a hulking man with green skin, hair, and eyes, wearing only a pair of torn purple pants that survive his physical transformation as the character progressed and his voice changer is lower and monsterous. As Bruce Banner, the character is about 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) tall and weighs 128 lbs (58.05 kg), but when transformed into the Hulk, the character stands between 7 and 8 ft (2.13 - 2.43 m) tall and weighs between 1,040 and 1,400 lbs (471.73 - 635.02 kg). The Gray Hulk stands 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall and weighs 900 lbs (408.23 kg); the Merged Hulk stands 7 ft 6 in (2.28 m) tall and weighs 1,150 lbs (521.63 kg); the Green Scar stands 8 ft 8 in (2.64 m) tall and weighs 2,400 lbs (1.08 ton). The Devil Hulk is roughly the same size as Sasquatch, standing around 9 or 10 ft (2.74 / 3.04 m) tall and weighing roughly 2,000 lbs (907.18 kg). Following his debut, Banner&#x27;s transformations were triggered at nightfall, turning him into a grey-skinned Hulk. In &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; #2, the Hulk started to appear with green skin, and in &quot;Avengers&quot; #3 (1963) Banner realized that his transformations were now triggered by surges of adrenaline in response to feelings of fear, pain or anger. &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; #227 (1978) established that the Hulk&#x27;s separate identity was not due to the mutation affecting his brain, but because Banner was suffering from dissociative identity disorder, with the savage Green Hulk representing Banner&#x27;s repressed childhood rage and aggression, and the Grey Hulk representing Banner&#x27;s repressed selfish desires and urges.

====Identities====
=====Bruce Banner=====
During his decades of publication, Banner has been portrayed differently, but common themes persist. Banner, a physicist who earned his Ph.D. in nuclear physics from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), is sarcastic and seemingly very self-assured when he first appears in &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; #1, but is also emotionally withdrawn. Banner designed the gamma bomb that caused his affliction, and the ironic twist of his self-inflicted fate has been one of the most persistent common themes. Arie Kaplan describes the character thus: &quot;Robert Bruce Banner lives in a constant state of panic, always wary that the monster inside him will erupt, and therefore he cannot form meaningful bonds with anyone.&quot; As a child, Banner&#x27;s father Brian often got mad and physically abused both Banner and his mother, creating the psychological complex of fear, anger, and the fear of anger and the destruction it can cause that underlies the character. Banner has been shown to be emotionally repressed, but capable of deep love for Betty Ross, and for solving problems posed to him. Under the writing of Paul Jenkins, Banner was shown to be a capable fugitive, applying deductive reasoning and observation to figure out the events transpiring around him. On the occasions that Banner controlled the Hulk&#x27;s body, he applied principles of physics to problems and challenges and used deductive reasoning. It was shown after his ability to turn into the Hulk was taken away by the red Hulk that Banner has been extremely versatile as well as cunning when dealing with the many situations that followed. When he was briefly separated from the Hulk by Doom, Banner became criminally insane, driven by his desire to regain the power of the Hulk, but once the two recombined he came to accept that he was a better person with the Hulk to provide something for him to focus on controlling rather than allowing his intellect to run without restraint against the world.

=====Hulk=====
The traditional Hulk, often called &quot;Savage Hulk&quot;, was originally shown as grey and average in intelligence. He roamed aimlessly and became annoyed at &quot;puny&quot; humans who took him for a dangerous monster. Shortly after becoming the Hulk, his transformation continued turning him green, coinciding with him beginning to display primitive speech. By &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; #4, radiation treatments gave Banner&#x27;s mind complete control of the Hulk&#x27;s body. While Banner relished his indestructibility and power, he was quick to anger and more aggressive in his Hulk form. He became known as a hero alongside the Avengers, but his increasing paranoia caused him to leave the group. He was convinced that he would never be trusted.

Originally, the Hulk was shown as simple-minded and quick to anger. The Hulk generally divorces his identity from Banner&#x27;s, decrying Banner as &quot;puny Banner.&quot; From his earliest stories, the Hulk has been concerned with finding sanctuary and quiet. He is often shown to quickly react emotionally to situations. Grest and Weinberg call Hulk the &quot;dark, primordial side of Banner&#x27;s psyche.&quot; Even in the earliest appearances, Hulk spoke in the third person. Hulk retains a modest intelligence, thinking and talking in full sentences. Lee even gives the Hulk expository dialogue in issue #6, allowing readers to learn just what capabilities Hulk has, when the Hulk says, &quot;But these muscles ain&#x27;t just for show! All I gotta do is spring up and just keep goin&#x27;!&quot; In the 1970s, Hulk was shown as more prone to anger and rage, and less talkative. Writers played with the nature of his transformations, briefly giving Banner control over the change, and the ability to maintain control of his Hulk form. Artistically and conceptually, the character has become progressively more muscular and powerful in the years since his debut.

=====Joe Fixit=====
Originally, Stan Lee wanted the Hulk to be grey. Due to ink problems, Hulk&#x27;s color was changed to green. This was later changed in the story to indicate that the Grey Hulk and the Savage Hulk are separate dissociative identities or entities fighting for control in Bruce&#x27;s subconscious. The Grey Hulk incarnation can do the more unscrupulous things that Banner could not bring himself to do, with many sources comparing the Grey Hulk to the moody teenager that Banner never allowed himself to be. While the grey Hulk still had the-madder-he-gets, the-stronger-he-gets part that is similar to the Savage Hulk, it is on a much slower rate. It is said by the Leader that the Grey Hulk is stronger on nights of the new moon and weaker on nights of the full moon. Originally, the night is when Bruce Banner became the Grey Hulk and changed back by dawn. In later comics, willpower or stress would have Banner turn into the Grey Hulk. During one storyline where he was placed under a spell to prevent him turning back into Bruce Banner and publicly presumed dead when he was teleported away from a gamma bomb explosion that destroyed an entire town, the grey Hulk adopted a specific name as Joe Fixit, a security expert for Las Vegas casino owner Michael Berengetti, with the grey Hulk often being referred to as Joe after these events. Joe Fixit later gained the ability to transform into a version of Red Hulk in the Below-Place.

=====Merged Hulk=====
Convinced that unaided, the Banner, Green Hulk, and Grey Hulk identities would eventually destroy each other, Doc Samson uses hypnosis to merge the three to create a new single identity combining Banner&#x27;s intelligence with the Grey Hulk&#x27;s and Banner&#x27;s attitudes and the Green Hulk&#x27;s body. This new Merged Hulk, Professor Hulk, or simply The Professor, considered himself cured and began a new life, but the merger was not perfect, and the Hulk sometimes still considered Banner a separate person, and when overcome with rage the Merged Hulk would transform back into Banner&#x27;s human body while still thinking himself the Hulk. The Merged Hulk is the largest of the three primary Hulk incarnations. While in a calm emotional state, the Merged Hulk is stronger than Savage Hulk when he is calm. Unlike the Savage Hulk and the Grey Hulk, Banner subconsciously installed a type of safeguard within this incarnation. The safeguard is that when the Merged Hulk gets angry, he regresses back to Banner with the mind of the Savage Hulk.

=====Doc Green=====
A variation of the Merged Hulk identity takes on the name Doc Green as the result of Extremis fixing Hulk&#x27;s brain, becoming powerful enough to destroy Tony Stark&#x27;s mansion with one thunderclap. This form was also known as Omega Hulk. It was theorized by Doc Green that this form was an earlier incarnation of his possible future form Maestro.

=====The Devil Hulk=====
The Devil Hulk, or simply the Devil, is the result of the Hulk needing a father figure. While the character&#x27;s physical appearance varies, he is always depicted as having glowing red eyes and reptilian traits. The new form of the Devil Hulk is the result of Banner and Hulk having been through different deaths and rebirths. This incarnation is articulate, smart, and cunning, and does merciless attacks on those who do harm. Unlike the other Hulk incarnations, the Devil Hulk is content with waiting inside Bruce. If Bruce is injured by sunset, the Devil Hulk will emerge with his transformation being limited to night-time. Thanks to the Devil Hulk side and Banner working together, the Devil Hulk can maintain his form in sunlight.

=====Other identities=====
The Gravage Hulk is the result of Banner using the Gamma Projector on himself which merged his Savage Hulk and Grey Hulk identities. This form possesses the raw power of the Savage Hulk and the cunning intellect of the Grey Hulk. While he does not draw on anger to empower him, the Gravage Hulk identity draws on dimensional nexus energies to increase his strength.

The Dark Hulk identity is the result of Hulk being possessed by Shanzar. This form has black skin and is viciously strong.

The Guilt Hulk is a malevolent representation of Banner&#x27;s abusive father, Brian Banner, that manifests itself in Banner&#x27;s childhood memories.

The Green Scar identity is unleashed on Sakaar and is an enraged version of the Gravage Hulk. In addition, he is an expert in armed combat like the use of swords and shields. Green Scar is also a capable leader and an expert strategist.

Kluh is a personality of Hulk who is described as the &quot;Hulk&#x27;s Hulk&quot;. This form sports a white mohawk, black skin, and red lines on him.

Titan is a more monstrous and malicious form of Hulk who stands at 30 ft., has black skin, rock-like spikes on his shoulders, and possesses the ability to shoot lasers from his eyes. This personality was born when it was planted in Hulk by D&#x27;Spayre.

===Powers and abilities===
====Bruce Banner====
Considered to be one of the greatest scientific minds on Earth, Banner possesses &quot;a mind so brilliant it cannot be measured on any known intelligence test.&quot; Norman Osborn estimates that he is the fourth most-intelligent person on Earth. Banner holds expertise in biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine, physiology, and nuclear physics. Using this knowledge, he creates advanced technology dubbed &quot;Bannertech&quot;, which is on par with technological development from Tony Stark or Doctor Doom. These technologies include a teleporter and a force field that can protect him from the attacks of Hulk-level entities.

After becoming a fugitive from the law, Banner is forced to go on the run and over the years learns various skills in order to both survive and remain under radar of those who are hunting him. Banner&#x27;s most frequent method of travel includes hitchhiking, train hopping or simply just walking as he is unable to travel legally via planes, passenger ships or buses due to being in several travel watchlists. Banner is generally on the move and rarely ever stays in one place for very long and only does so if there&#x27;s a possibility of curing himself. He will only ever stay in one place for an extended period of time if it provides him with complete solitude and privacy where the Hulk can do little to no harm.

To avoid being tracked, Banner does not use cell phones, debit or credit cards and will only use payphones or cash. He will often use fake identities when staying at motels or working jobs that require identification. Having been on the run for years, Banner can normally tell when he is being followed and will generally make a run for it when he is discovered. Having traveled across the globe, Banner is able to sneak over borders without being detected and can get by, by either knowing or learning the local language. Often traveling light, Banner has little to no possessions that he carries in either a satchel or backpack. Often losing everything he owns after transforming into the Hulk, Banner avoids keeping anything of personal value to him so that he can easily replace the items and clothes that were lost or destroyed.

To support himself financially, Banner will work quick part-time jobs and will only accept payments in cash. These jobs have varied from simply working in low pay diners to working as local doctor. Banner&#x27;s work ethic as well as his vast knowledge and skillset in science, medicine and engineering often help him get hired rather quickly. Unless desperate, Banner will generally avoid jobs that are high stress due to the potential danger of transforming into the Hulk.

Banner has little to no memories of the Hulk&#x27;s actions aside from his initial transformation which he described as being extremely painful. Banner&#x27;s lack of memories often terrifies him as he has often transformed back to witness the devastating aftermath of the Hulk&#x27;s battles which both saddens and encourages him to find a way to understand his condition so that he won&#x27;t cause anymore destruction or harm. During his travels, Banner has developed several different techniques to help suppress or control his transformations when he becomes a little angry or upset. Among the techniques he has learned over the years include meditation and hypnotherapy. While they have helped him to better understand and suppress his transformations, none of techniques Banner has learned have helped him to gain full control over the Hulk.

====The Hulk====
The Hulk possesses the potential for seemingly limitless physical strength that is influenced by his emotional state, particularly his anger. This has been reflected in the repeated comment &quot;The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets.&quot; The cosmically powerful entity known as the Beyonder once analyzed the Hulk&#x27;s physiology, and claimed that the Hulk&#x27;s potential strength had &quot;no finite element inside.&quot; Hulk&#x27;s strength has been depicted as sometimes limited by Banner&#x27;s subconscious influence; when Jean Grey psionically &quot;shut Banner off&quot;, Hulk became strong enough to overpower and destroy the physical form of the villain Onslaught. Writer Greg Pak described the Worldbreaker Hulk shown during &quot;World War Hulk&quot; as having a level of physical power where &quot;Hulk was stronger than any mortal—and most immortals—who ever walked the Earth&quot; and depicted the character as powerful enough to completely destroy entire planets. His strength allows him to leap into lower Earth orbit or across continents, and he has displayed superhuman speed. Exposure to radiation has also been shown to make the Hulk stronger. It is unknown how he gains biomass during transformation but it may be linked to the One-Below-All.

His durability, regeneration, and endurance also increase in proportion to his temper. Hulk is resistant to injury or damage, though the degree to which varies between interpretations, but he has withstood the equivalent of solar temperatures, nuclear explosions, and planet-shattering impacts. Despite his remarkable resiliency, continuous barrages of high-caliber gunfire can hinder his movement to some degree while he can be temporarily subdued by intense attacks with chemical weapons such as anesthetic gases, although any interruption of such dosages will allow him to quickly recover. He has been shown to have both regenerative and adaptive healing abilities, including growing tissues to allow him to breathe underwater, surviving unprotected in space for extended periods, and when injured, healing from most wounds within seconds, including, on one occasion, the complete destruction of most of his body mass. His future self, the &quot;Maestro&quot;, was even eventually able to recover from being blown to pieces. As an effect, he has an extremely prolonged lifespan.

He also possesses less commonly described powers, including abilities allowing him to &quot;home in&quot; to his place of origin in New Mexico; resist psychic control, or unwilling transformation; grow stronger from radiation or dark magic; punch his way between separate temporal or spatial dimensions; and to see and interact with astral forms. Some of these abilities were in later years explained as being related; his ability to home in on the New Mexico bomb site was due to his latent ability to sense astral forms and spirits, since the bomb site was also the place where the Maestro&#x27;s skeleton was and the Maestro&#x27;s spirit was calling out to him in order to absorb his radiation. He is also shown to have a separate memory to Bruce Banner - when Spider-Man has the knowledge of his secret identity erased during Spider-Man: One More Day, the Hulk later asks how Peter is doing, not Spider-Man; upon questioning, he enigmatically states &quot;Banner forgot. But I don&#x27;t forget.&quot;

In the first &quot;Hulk&quot; comic series, &quot;massive&quot; doses of gamma rays would cause the Hulk to transform back to Banner, although this ability was written out of the character by the 1970s.

==Supporting characters==

Over the long publication history of the Hulk&#x27;s adventures, many recurring characters have featured prominently, including his best friend and sidekick Rick Jones, love interest and wife Betty Ross and her father, the often adversarial General &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross. Both Banner and Hulk have families created in their respective personas. Banner is son to Brian, an abusive father who killed Banner&#x27;s mother while she tried to protect her son from his father&#x27;s delusional attacks, and cousin to Jennifer Walters, the She-Hulk, who serves as his frequent ally. Banner had a stillborn child with Betty, while the Hulk has two sons with his deceased second wife Caiera Oldstrong, Skaar and Hiro-Kala, and his DNA was used to create a daughter named Lyra with Thundra the warrior woman.

&quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #12 (March 1963), featured the Hulk&#x27;s first battle with the Thing. Although many early Hulk stories involve Ross trying to capture or destroy the Hulk, the main villain is often a radiation-based character, like the Gargoyle or the Leader, along with other foes such as the Toad Men, or Asian warlord General Fang. Ross&#x27; daughter Betty loves Banner and criticizes her father for pursuing the Hulk. General Ross&#x27; right-hand man, Major Glenn Talbot, also loves Betty and is torn between pursuing Hulk and trying to gain Betty&#x27;s love more honorably. Rick Jones serves as the Hulk&#x27;s friend and sidekick in these early tales. The Hulk&#x27;s archenemies are the Abomination and the Leader. The Abomination is more monstrous-looking, twice as strong as the Hulk at normal levels (however, the Abomination&#x27;s strength levels do not increase when &quot;he&quot; gets angry) and wreaks havoc for fun and pleasure. The Leader is a gamma-irradiated super-genius who has tried plan after plan to take over the world.

==Cultural impact==

The Hulk character and the concepts behind it have been raised to the level of iconic status by many within and outside the comic book industry. In 2003, &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; claimed the character had &quot;stood the test of time as a genuine icon of American pop culture.&quot; In 2008, the Hulk was listed as the 19th greatest comic book character by &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine named him as the 14th-greatest comic-book character and the fifth-greatest Marvel character. In 2011, the Hulk placed No. 9 on IGN&#x27;s list of &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Heroes&quot;, and fourth on their list of &quot;The Top 50 Avengers&quot; in 2012.

===Analysis===
The Hulk is often viewed as a reaction to war. As well as being a reaction to the Cold War, the character has been a cipher for the frustrations the Vietnam War raised, and Ang Lee said that the Iraq War influenced his direction. In the Michael Nyman edited edition of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Stefanie Diekmann explored Marvel Comics&#x27; reaction to the September 11 attacks. Diekmann discussed The Hulk&#x27;s appearance in the 9/11 tribute comic &quot;Heroes&quot;, claiming that his greater prominence, alongside Captain America, aided in &quot;stressing the connection between anger and justified violence without having to depict anything more than a well-known and well-respected protagonist.&quot; In &quot;Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World&#x27;s Greatest Comics&quot;, Les Daniels addresses the Hulk as an embodiment of cultural fears of radiation and nuclear science. He quotes Jack Kirby thus: &quot;As long as we&#x27;re experimenting with radioactivity, there&#x27;s no telling what may happen, or how much our advancements in science may cost us.&quot; Daniels continues, &quot;The Hulk became Marvel&#x27;s most disturbing embodiment of the perils inherent in the atomic age.&quot;

In &quot;Comic Book Nation&quot;, Bradford Wright alludes to Hulk&#x27;s counterculture status, referring to a 1965 &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine poll amongst college students which &quot;revealed that student radicals ranked Spider-Man and the Hulk alongside the likes of Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons.&quot; Wright goes on to cite examples of his anti-authority symbol status. Two of these are &quot;The Ballad of the Hulk&quot; by Jerry Jeff Walker, and the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cover for September 30, 1971, a full color Herb Trimpe piece commissioned for the magazine. The Hulk has been caricatured in such animated television series as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, and &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and such comedy TV series as &quot;The Young Ones&quot;. The character is also used as a cultural reference point for someone displaying anger or agitation. For example, in a 2008 &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; review of an &quot;EastEnders&quot; episode, a character is described as going &quot;into Incredible Hulk mode, smashing up his flat.&quot; In September 2019, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson likened himself to The Hulk in an interview with the &quot;Mail On Sunday&quot;, as political pressure built on him to request an extension to the date of the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union.

The Hulk, especially his alter ego Bruce Banner, is also a common reference in hip hop music. The term was represented as an analogue to marijuana in Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;2001&quot;, while more conventional references are made in Ludacris and Jermaine Dupri&#x27;s popular single &quot;Welcome to Atlanta&quot;.

The 2003 Ang Lee-directed &quot;Hulk&quot; film saw discussion of the character&#x27;s appeal to Asian Americans. The Taiwanese-born Ang Lee commented on the &quot;subcurrent of repression&quot; that underscored the character of The Hulk, and how that mirrored his own experience: &quot;Growing up, my artistic leanings were always repressed—there was always pressure to do something &#x27;useful,&#x27; like being a doctor.&quot; Jeff Yang, writing for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, extended this self-identification to Asian American culture, arguing that &quot;the passive-aggressive streak runs deep among Asian Americans—especially those who have entered creative careers, often against their parents&#x27; wishes.&quot;

There have been explorations about the real-world possibility of Hulk&#x27;s gamma-radiation-based origin. In &quot;The Science of Superheroes&quot;, Lois Grest and Robert Weinberg examined Hulk&#x27;s powers, explaining the scientific flaws in them. Most notably, they point out that the level of gamma radiation Banner is exposed to at the initial blast would induce radiation sickness and kill him, or if not, create significant cancer risks for Banner, because hard radiation strips cells of their ability to function. They go on to offer up an alternate origin, in which a Hulk might be created by biological experimentation with adrenal glands and GFP. Charles Q. Choi from LiveScience.com further explains that, unlike the Hulk, gamma rays are not green; existing as they do beyond the visible spectrum, gamma rays have no color at all that we can describe. He also explains that gamma rays are so powerful (the most powerful form of electromagnetic radiation and 10,000 times more powerful than visible light) that they can even convert energy into matter – a possible explanation for the increased mass that Bruce Banner takes on during transformations. &quot;Just as the Incredible Hulk &#x27;is the strongest one there is,&#x27; as he says himself, so too are gamma-ray bursts the most powerful explosions known.&quot;

==Other Marvel Comics characters called the Hulk==
Prior to the debut of the Hulk in May 1962, Marvel had earlier monster characters that used the name the &quot;Hulk&quot;, but had no direct relation.

* In &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #75 (June 1960), Albert Poole built an armor he called the Hulk. In modern-day reprints, the character&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Grutan&quot;.
* In &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #62 (Nov. 1960) was &quot;Xemnu the Living Hulk&quot;, a huge, furry alien monster who went by the name of the Hulk. Coincidentally, the character&#x27;s debut story was also illustrated by Jack Kirby. The character reappeared in issue #66 (March 1961). Since then the character has been a mainstay in the Marvel Universe, and was renamed Xemnu the Living Titan.
* A huge, orange, slimy monster called the Hulk was featured in a movie titled &quot;The Hulk&quot; in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #21 (July 1961). In modern-day reprints, the character&#x27;s name was changed to the &quot;Glop&quot;.

== Other versions ==
A number of alternate universes and alternate timelines in Marvel Comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on the Hulk, in which the character&#x27;s origins, behavior, and morality differ from the mainstream setting. In some stories, someone other than Bruce Banner is the Hulk.

In some versions, the Hulk succumbs to the darker side of his nature: in &quot;Future Imperfect&quot; (December 1992), a future version of the Hulk has become the Maestro, the tyrannical and ruthless ruler of a nuclear war-irradiated Earth, and in &quot;Old Man Logan&quot; (2008), an insane Hulk rules over a post-apocalyptic California and leads a gang of his inbred Hulk children created with his first cousin She-Hulk.

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the Age of Apocalypse alternative setting, Bruce Banner was never exposed to gamma radiation. Therefore, he did not become the Hulk. Instead he became a member of the Human High Council, where he was a scientist and became a weapons designer. However he also yearns to gain knowledge and power, something Apocalypse was willing to help with, and so Bruce sold himself to Mikhail Rasputin, one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse, to give him mutants as test subjects. He succeeds in his experiments and can now transform into a creature resembling the Grey Hulk. He was used as a mole in the council, but was discovered by Susan Storm and Ben Grimm because the patterns of Bruce&#x27;s injuries were identical to those sustained by the Hulk.

Later, Banner attempted to redeem himself by jumping out of the Human High Council ship in an effort to prevent it from getting struck by a gamma missile of his own creation. The missile detonated, allowing the Human High Council to escape Earth. He fell back to Earth, landed in the Colosseum, and emerged as the Green Hulk. There were no further mentions of the Hulk in the Age of Apocalypse material.

===Age of X===
In the &quot;Age of X&quot; reality, Bruce Banner was a scientist who was under contract from the United States government to build a device that would depower any mutant. However, during the testing phase one of the mutant volunteers began to panic. Her powers caused the machine to go off prematurely while still in the gamma spectrum. The mutants were killed and Banner was bombarded by gamma radiation. The combination of the radiation and the fact that some of the mutants&#x27; genes were imprinted on him as well, caused Banner to transform into the Hulk. Because of his exposure to mutant genes, Banner holds a deep murderous resentment for all mutants to the point that he volunteered for a suicide mission to detonate a chemical bomb that would destroy the entire mutant stronghold, forcing his former teammates to sacrifice their lives to detonate the bomb early. He was incinerated by his own bomb when one of his former teammates named Redback (this reality&#x27;s Spider-Woman) uses Steel Corpse&#x27;s (this reality&#x27;s Iron Man) severed glove to destroy the bomb.

===Amalgam Comics===
The Skulk is a hero of the Amalgam Universe. He is amalgamation of the Hulk and DC Comics&#x27; Solomon Grundy.

Bruce Banner was a scientist working with gamma rays. He was testing his gamma bomb out in the desert, but a tall figure walked out into the testing area. When Banner went out to see who it was, the man turned out to be Solomon Grundy. The bomb went off fusing Grundy and Banner together. When Banner gets angry he becomes Grundy, but the creature made a name for itself, calling itself Skulk.

===Breaker-Apart===
In a potential future, the One Below All is able to destroy Bruce Banner&#x27;s soul and possesses the body of the Hulk. After which, it went on to kill Franklin Richards, Galactus, Mister Immortal, and many others until it was the only being left in the universe. Taking on Bruce&#x27;s appearance, the One Below All encounters the Sentience of the Eighth Cosmos/Metatron and is able to trick and devour him, absorbing his powers. In the newly formed Ninth Cosmos, the One Below All used its newly acquired powers to transform Hulk into a Galactus-like being named the &#x27;Breaker-Apart&#x27;. 10 billion years later, the Breaker-Apart has destroyed all light, all life, and all planets in the Multiverse. When Par%l tried to make contact and reason with it, the alien instead meets the abstract form of the One Below All which told hir it wanted to &quot;Make all hollow as I, dark and dead as I&quot; and killed Par%l and hir&#x27;s planet, O%los.

===Bullet Points===
In the &quot;Bullet Points&quot; mini-series, Peter Parker finds himself on the test site for a Gamma bomb and absorbs a large dose of gamma radiation, becoming the Hulk. In a further twist, later in the series, in an attempt to find a cure for Peter, Dr. Bruce Banner examines specimens taken from the test site and is bitten by a radioactive spider, becoming Spider-Man. Parker is killed by Galactus and Banner is killed by an Inheritor during the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; event.

===Deadpool: Samurai (Earth-346)===

In the &quot;Deadpool: Samurai&quot; manga series, which takes place on Earth-346, Bruce Banner removes a control collar from the singer Neiro Aratabi, who had been saved from a deranged fan by Deadpool. Banner then attempts to transform into the Hulk to help Deadpool stop HYDRA agents from retrieving the Gateway Controller, which had been hidden under the Tokyo Dome, but he was knocked unconscious by a piece of falling debris before he could finish his transformation. Banner did gradually regain consciousness and he then completed transforming into the Hulk, but he was quickly defeated by Thanos, who had been summoned by the Hydra agents.

===Earth X===
The Earth X series featured a vastly different take on the character, one in which the Hulk and Bruce Banner have finally achieved separation. However, they still rely on each other with Banner becoming a blind child who sees through the Hulk&#x27;s eyes. In an interview in &quot;Comicology Volume I: The Kingdom Come Companion&quot;, Alex Ross said that the design of Earth-X Banner and Hulk was based on the appearance of Moon-Boy and Devil Dinosaur.

===Exiles===
Numerous alternate versions of the Hulk have been present in the &quot;Exiles&quot; series.

* A crazy version of the Hulk was seen attacking Canada. He was stopped by the Exiles and Alpha Flight. This battle featured the first appearance of the rogue reality jumpers known as Weapon X. The crazy Hulk was presumed dead after this encounter.
* Another visually different Hulk appeared in this universe. This version had a long ponytail and wore a &quot;Peace Out&quot; costume, but he still retained his gamma-irradiated appearance, strength and his famous smashing abilities. He teamed up with an evil Firestar and was recruited by the Timebroker to stop an evil Hyperion. The plan succeeded and they both joined Weapon X. When Hyperion had gone even crazier than before, Hulk attacked and Weapon X began to fight with each other. This version of The Hulk was killed when Hyperion brutally fought him until he was in a weakened state, Hyperion then used his heat vision on The Hulk, melting and destroying him. His body is sent back to his reality, where his funeral is held. Some time after Hulk&#x27;s death, Firestar committed suicide when she incinerates herself and a teammate.
* A conqueror version of the Hulk, in his gladiator outfit, killed Annihilus, most of the superhumans, took full control of the Annihilation Wave, and decimated Earth. He has been apparently knocked unconscious by the Exiles. It is unknown if he survived this incident. This version is even more insane than the other alternate versions of the Hulk. While the Exiles had been dealing with Proteus, Hulk&#x27;s Annihilation Wave killed many of the superhumans which should not have happened if not for Proteus. A new version of the Exiles have been present showing the surviving superhumans and they all have one goal: to stop Hulk and his Annihilation Wave, in which they apparently succeeded.

===Hulk: Chapter One===
In the &quot;Hulk 1999 Annual&quot;, writer John Byrne revised the Hulk&#x27;s origin, much like his &quot;Spider-Man: Chapter One&quot;. In the revised origin, the Gamma Bomb that was being tested is now a gamma laser, and a Skrull was responsible for Rick Jones&#x27; presence on the base during the gamma test. The Skrull also disguised himself as Igor Rasminsky (Drenkov in the original stories), a fellow scientist working on the project. The contemporary setting removes the Cold War context of the original story, and serves as a tie-in to the &quot;&quot; maxi-series created by Roger Stern and Byrne, which also brought the origins of many Marvel characters out of the 1960s and into contemporary times. The storyline is currently designated as set on Earth-9992, and is not part of mainstream Marvel continuity (Earth-616).

=== The Last Avengers Story ===
In the 1995 miniseries &quot;The Last Avengers Story&quot;, Hulk was amongst those who joined Thor, The Thing and Hercules in a mysterious conflict known as the &quot;Great Cataclysm&quot; which threatened Olympus and Asgard. The event ended with Hulk holding Hercules&#x27;s golden mace and his skin temporarily turned grey, suggesting that the Hulk was the only survivor of this conflict. After the Event Hulk was recruited alongside Mockingbird, Tigra, Wonder Man and Hawkeye to fight Ultron. However Hulk had been seemingly corrupted by the events of the Great Cataclysm and turned on his allies, ripping Tigra in half and puncturing Wonder Man, Wonder Man unleashed his energy against the Hulk, seemingly killing them both and accidentally blinding Hawkeye. Hulk is finally defeated by Thor, which ends the chaos.

===House of M===
In the &quot;House of M&quot; reality, Bruce Banner disappears in Australia, where he befriends an Aborigine tribe, and attempts to control his dark side. When the mutant rulers of the Earth attack his tribe he retaliates, and eventually conquers Australia with the aid of Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.).

===Infernal Hulk===
In one alternative reality, Bruce Banner and the Hulk were magically separated. Bruce became the new Sorcerer Supreme, and the Hulk was cast into hell. However, while in hell, the Hulk became corrupted by the demonic beings he encountered, transforming him into a demon himself. Now completely evil, he escaped from hell and attempted to kill Banner. With help from the mainstream Hulk, Banner tricked the &quot;infernal&quot; Hulk into shattering the Eye of Agamotto, causing him to be thrown back into hell.

===Maestro===
Set in a post apocalyptic future, the Hulk has mutated into the dictator Maestro ruling the remains of humanity with an iron fist. Ruthless, sadistic, violent, and tyrannical, the Maestro was shown to be an example of what would happen if the Hulk ever embraced his darker roots. Maestro was known to be an enemy of the Hulk, as the two alternate versions fought each other on Maestro&#x27;s world.

===Marvel 2099===
For the &quot;Marvel 2099&quot; imprint, Gerard Jones and Dwayne Turner created a new version of the character. First appearing in &quot;2099 Unlimited&quot; #1, John Eisenhart, a selfish film producer in &quot;LotusLand&quot; (future Hollywood) is inadvertently exposed to gamma radiation by the Knights of the Banner (a cult worshipping the original Hulk) who intend to create a Hulk of their own. As the Hulk, Eisenhart finds himself representing freedom to a closed-off society. A &quot;Hulk 2099&quot; series was published for 10 issues.

The unified Marvel Noir reality of Earth-2099 featured a version of Hulk 2009. In addition, there was a 2099 version of Grey Hulk who was a member of the 2099 version of the Avengers until he was among those who were killed by the 2099 version of the Masters of Evil. The 2099 version of Moon Knight survived the massacre and formed the 2099 version of the New Avengers with Hulk 2099 as one of its members as they avenged Grey Hulk 2099 and the fallen Avengers by defeating the Masters of Evil and having them remanded to a prison on the planet Wakanda.

===Marvel Comics 2===
In another take, The Hulk is shown to still be active in the alternative future of the MC2 universe. There, he is shown as an amalgamation of his three main transformations; He has the strength of the Savage Hulk, the attitude of the Grey Hulk, and the intelligence of the Professor Hulk.

He&#x27;s also shown to have fathered a son named David by an unknown spouse.

He was later seen within the pages of &quot;Last Hero Standing&quot;, where Loki manipulated him into attacking the heroes. When he was freed of his manipulation he was critical in punishing Loki by forcing him into the voided dimension that Thor had opened a rift into, Hulk informing Loki that he was ruined on Earth because of Loki&#x27;s actions and he therefore had nothing to lose by ensuring that Loki would be punished for eternity.

===Marvel Zombies===
====Marvel Zombies: Dead Days====
In the series &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;, the Hulk has been infected with a virus which makes him into an undead zombie (he is actually infected by the zombie Fantastic Four). Although he still retains his strength and invulnerability, he no longer heals, is losing weight because of his now-deteriorating tissue, does not feel pain and now craves human flesh. The zombie Hulk&#x27;s transformations are physically controlled purely by his appetite — after feeding, he transforms back into Banner, who is also a zombie, until the hunger returns. When Hulk first transforms back into Banner, his stomach starts to burst. He is directly responsible for killing the Silver Surfer by biting off his head. Later he joins Spider-Man, Iron-Man, Giant-Man, Wolverine and Luke Cage as the Galacti after killing and consuming Galactus.

====Marvel Zombies 2====
Forty years later, the zombie Hulk, along with the other zombies, had eaten or converted most of the universe, prompting them to return to Earth to try to recover the dimensional transporter. Although the other zombies managed to beat their hunger by going without food for a time, the Hulk&#x27;s raw hunger was too great for him to be convinced to stop, resulting in him killing the zombified but &quot;cured&quot; Iron Man, Jean Grey, Hawkeye, and Firelord. Once he feeds and returns to Bruce Banner, he is finally killed by Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Giant-Man, recognizing that there is no other way to stop the Hulk from feeding again.

====Marvel Zombies 3====
Hulk makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Marvel Zombies 3&quot; when Machine Man, Ultron, and Jocasta travel to Earth 2149, killing winged zombies (zombie Beak, Angel, Vulture, and Falcon altogether). He also makes another cameo appearance when Vanessa Fisk explains to the 3 androids how the Silver Surfer died, and how the zombie Kingpin, who is, surprisingly, her husband, created a zombie empire forming a huge alliance.

====Marvel Zombies Return====
A second Hulk appears in the reality the Marvel Zombies of the original series are teleported to, known as Earth-Z. This version&#x27;s life appears identical to his core counterpart up until the events of World War Hulk. When he reaches the Moon to attack the Inhumans, he is infected by the zombie Giant-Man, and his allies killed. Oddly hungry, he heads back to Earth and begins eating people, and ultimately infecting the Sentry, who sets about forming a team of Zombie Avengers to eat humanity and wipe out any competition or resistance from other heroes, infected or otherwise dead. After the Sentry tries to kill Hulk to eliminate the competition as the two are the only creatures capable of challenging each other, Hulk is later cured of his hunger by the Zombie Spider-Man and joins his New Avengers. The team succeeds in killing the Zombie Avengers and ending their plan to eat the multiverse, sacrificing themselves in the process. Ultimately, the nanite infused Sandman killed Hulk.

===Old Man Logan===
&quot;Old Man Logan&quot; is set 50 years into an apocalyptic future. The world is in ruin and shadow following a massive conflict. A large coordinated force of super villains has killed a majority of the heroes and seized control of the United States splitting it into sections. Bruce Banner is said to have gone mad from radiation sickness, possibly from nuclear weapons that may have been used during the conflict or this and other changes may be the long-term result of his famous gamma radiation accident. Bruce&#x27;s personality and powers seem altered, in human form he now has little empathy and possesses superhuman strength. Banner and his cousin Jennifer Walters have mated and produced offspring that possess their green skin and a little of their strength. They form the hillbilly-like &quot;Hulk Gang&quot; that rule the entire west coast of the country dubbed &quot;Hulkland&quot;, a domain formerly held by the Abomination until Banner killed him. Banner, along with his children and grandchildren, live in a collection of caves and trailers, forcing those that live on the west coast to pay them rent in order to be allowed to live.

There were two versions of the Hulk that appear:

====Earth-807128====
&quot;Pappy&quot; Bruce Banner&#x27;s family threaten Logan&#x27;s family over rent due to the Banners. Logan accompanies Clint Barton on a cross country delivery to source the rent money. When Logan returns and finds the bodies of his family, killed by the Banners, he kills the Hulk Gang and attacks Pappy Banner who admits that he set all of this into motion because he missed their old brawls. Banner gets angry when Wolverine calls him a redneck SOB and drives his claws through his chest. He transforms into The Hulk. Hulk overpowers Logan and eats him. Logan&#x27;s mutant healing factor then allows him to recover and slash his way out of Hulk&#x27;s stomach, killing him. Logan spots Banner&#x27;s son, Bruce, Jr. and spares him. Logan takes the boy to raise in an effort to someday help combat the various villains that still rule the country.

Old Man Logan found that Pappy Banner&#x27;s head was placed on a gamma-powered robot made from Adamantium by Tinkerer. He used it in his revenge on Old Man Logan. Before Old Man Logan can be finished off by Pappy Banner, he is suddenly attacked by Bruce Banner Jr. who separated Pappy Banner&#x27;s head from the Adamantium armor. Rather than kill his head, Old Man Logan buried it and planted a tree over him so that its roots can slowly dig into his skull.

====Earth-21923====
Pappy Banner&#x27;s history on Earth-21923&#x27;s history was still intact up to his death at the hands of Old Man Logan. When Old Man Logan uses Asmodeus&#x27; help to return to this future to rescue Bruce Banner Jr., he finds that the time has been altered in which Maestro appears in the place of Pappy Banner. This unidentified version of Maestro has rounded up the remaining members of the Hulk Gang as he makes plans to help them build a paradise for all Hulks on Earth-616. With help from the Cambria Banner, Logan and Hawkeye of Earth-616 were able to defeat Maestro and the surviving members of the Hulk Gang went their separate ways.

===Otto Banner===
During the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Reign&quot; storyline, Doctor Octopus started forming his Superior Four that includes a Hulk that has four extra arms growing from his back. His real name is Otto Banner of Earth-8816 and he was also abused by his Earth&#x27;s version of Brian Banner.

===Ruins===
In the Warren Ellis series &quot;Ruins&quot;, a dark flip to the Kurt Busiek tale &quot;Marvels&quot;, the accidents, experiments and mutations that led to the creation of Super Heroes and super humans, instead led to terrible deformations and painful deaths. Here, Bruce Banner&#x27;s story goes exactly the same as his 616 counterpart, but when he is caught in the middle of the gamma bomb explosion, instead of transforming into the Incredible Hulk, his whole body opens up from the gigantic tumors that appear inside it, pushing most of his organs and skull outside his body and giving Rick Jones cancer. He did not die, and was put in an underground vault by the CIA, codenamed &quot;the Hulk&quot;.

===Secret Wars (2015)===
During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, different versions of Hulk reside in each Battleworld domain.

* The Battleworld domain of Greenland is filled with an assortment of Hulks ranging from Tribal Hulks (a group of Hulks that live like a tribe), Bull Hulks (a group of gamma-irradiated cattle), Sand Hulks (who evoke the traits of Hulk and Sandman), and a Sea Hulk. This land is a recreation of Earth-71612 where it was rendered into a Hulk-filled land by a gamma bomb strike by A.I.M. It was stated that Bruce Banner had started Bannertech Industries and his fate has not been mentioned since A.I.M.&#x27;s gamma bomb strike. In addition to the various type of Hulks and a variation of a Red Hulk that rules Greenland as the Red King&quot;, a variation of Steve Rogers that was sent into Greenland by God Emperor Doom and Sheriff Strange encountered another variation of Steve Rogers that operated as Doc Green.
* The Battleworld domain of Spider-Island that was based from the remnants of Earth-19919 told an alternate version of the &quot;Spider-Island&quot; storyline where Hulk was mutated into Spider-Hulk and served as one of Spider-Queen&#x27;s minions. However, Agent Venom uses Curt Connors&#x27; Lizard Formula to mutate Hulk into a giant lizard monster, which broke him free from the Spider Queen&#x27;s control.
* The Battleworld domain of Marville that was based from the remnants of Earth-71912 featured a child version of Hulk that is a member of the Avengers.
* The Battleworld domain of the Kingdom of Manhattan is based from the remnants of Earth-61610 where variations of characters from Earth-616 and Earth-1610 co-exist on the combined version of both reality&#x27;s Manhattan. In this case, a variation of Hulk&#x27;s Doc Green form co-exists with a variation of Earth-1610&#x27;s Hulk.
* The Battleworld domain of Bug World that was based from the remnants of Earth-22312 features an anthropomorphic insect version of Hulk called Roly-Poly Hulk.
* The Battleworld domain of the Walled City of New York that was based from the remnants of Earth-21722 features a version of Hulk that is a member of the Avengers where they are allied with S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s side of the Walled City of New York.

===Spider-Geddon===
During the &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; storyline, a sequel to &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;, Robbie Banner is a punk on Earth-138 who is allied with Spider-Punk and can turn into the Hulk while listening to &quot;Atomic Bomb&quot; music. He helped Spider-Punk and Captain Anarchy fight the U-Foes at the Hellfire Club, assisted Spider-Punk and M.C. Strange push the Universal Church of Truth out of Queens, and fought Hydra on the streets. After obtaining the &quot;Atomic Bomb&quot; tape from Captain Anarchy, Spider-Punk visited Robbie to get his help, but the latter was reluctant to listen to the tape. When Kang the Conglomerator went on the attack, Robbie reluctantly listened to the tape and transformed into the Hulk to help Spider-Punk fight Kang.

===The End===
In other tales, possible futures for the character have been shown. Using a post apocalyptic wasteland as a backdrop, the Peter David written &quot;Incredible Hulk: The End&quot; one-shot features an elderly Bruce Banner as the last surviving inhabitant of Earth, the Hulk having hidden in a cave during a nuclear war until he was released by the Recorder sent to confirm humanity&#x27;s demise. After Bruce has spent time traveling Earth, transforming into the Hulk at night and when attacked by the mutated cockroaches that are the only other surviving lifeforms on Earth, the story concludes with Banner dying of a heart attack, thus leaving the Hulk as the last living being on the planet, Hulk musing that he is now &quot;the only one there is&quot;, having achieved his wish to be left alone, but aware that he will die if he turns back into Banner.

===Ultimate Marvel===
An alternate universe variant of Bruce Banner / Hulk from Earth-1610 appears in the Ultimate Marvel imprint. This version is a scientist working for S.H.I.E.L.D. who gained his powers from an attempt to recreate the Super-Soldier Formula that created Captain America. Additionally, Hulk is depicted as more malicious, representing Banner&#x27;s hidden emotions and id.

===Ultimate Universe===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker visits Earth-6160 and remakes it into his own image. One of the things he could not succeed in was preventing the origin of Hulk, who would later find personal &quot;enlightenment&quot;. He and his fellow monks of the Children of the Eternal Light would later attend an international event held by the Maker at the City in Latveria as part of his Council. Hulk and the Children of the Eternal Light are revealed to rule India and parts of Asia.

<text>The Champion of the Universe (Tryco Slatterus) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is not necessarily a villain but has played the role in the past through his impetuous and arrogant actions.

== Publication history ==

He first appeared in &quot;Marvel Two-in-One Annual&quot; #7 (1982), and was created by Tom DeFalco and Ron Wilson.

== Fictional character biography ==
The Champion is one of the alien Elders of the Universe. He is an immortal who claims to have been born billions of years ago in the Ancrindo Nebula. Although he wishes to prove himself the greatest warrior in the universe, he usually does so fairly. He keeps himself busy by fighting powerful warriors throughout the universe. The Champion of the Universe&#x27;s Promoter Supreme named Proja preceded the Champion&#x27;s journey to Earth and recruited the superheroes Thing, Namor, Hulk, Colossus, Sasquatch, Thor, Doc Samson, and Wonder Man to a boxing match in Madison Square Garden. The heroes are defeated or disqualified, but the Thing refuses to give up and convinces the Champion to surrender.

The Champion later attempted to kill the Silver Surfer to prevent him from interfering with a Skrull plot to use Nova to force Galactus to destroy the Kree Empire. The Champion was overpowered by the Silver Surfer, suffering his first known defeat in combat. The Champion was one of the eleven Elders who sought to restart the universe by killing Galactus. He attempted to kill Mantis but she was rescued by the Silver Surfer. The Champion then battled Galactus and the Silver Surfer but was converted to energy and consumed by Galactus. The Champion and the other four Elders devoured by Galactus caused Galactus &quot;cosmic indigestion&quot; from within until they were forced out of him by Master Order and Lord Chaos. After the other Elders leave, the Champion obtains the Power Gem, one of the Infinity Gems.

Later, the Champion had settled on the planet Skardon, whose native Skard exist in a &quot;might makes right&quot; culture; all disputes, including matters of law, are settled in a trial by combat. By defeating Skardon&#x27;s most powerful fighters in the natives&#x27; boxing-ring-esque arena, the Champion became the ruler of the planet. He is later defeated and dethroned by She-Hulk.

Afterward, the Champion took the new name of &quot;The Fallen One&quot; in disgrace. He also attempted to take revenge through a proxy, passing the Power Gem to the heroine&#x27;s arch-enemy Titania (who also failed to defeat She-Hulk). Upon learning that the Champion can return the Power Gem that contains the &quot;Power Primordial&quot; to himself at any time, Titania smashed him with a giant rock mass, believing that he would be kept buried below it.

When the Deadpool Corps was chosen to go defeat The Awareness, the Champion deemed them unworthy and sought to challenge them. However he is tricked and left stranded on an empty planet after the Deadpool Corps steals his motorcycle. After being rescued by the Gardener, the Champion tracks down Deadpool at a bar and begins to fight, but is eventually convinced to join the team under the name &quot;Championpool.&quot; He is soon tricked into going to fight on another deserted planet, only to find that there are no warriors to fight and his rocket cycle is without fuel, leaving him stranded.

The Champion of the Universe was with the other Elders of the Universe during Thanos&#x27; meeting with them. Thanos caused the supposed deaths of those present.

After the multiverse was restored in &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, the Champion of the Universe took part in a Contest of Champions between the other Elders of the Universe to determine who would keep the Power Primordial. He was eliminated from the contest when his champions lost.

Thane and Death sent the Champion of the Universe to recruit Starfox in a plot to take Thanos down when they learn that Thanos is dying.

==Powers and abilities==
The Champion controls an energy source referred to as the Power Primordial. This energy is apparently residual energy that is left over from the Big Bang itself. The Champion has spent countless eons channeling this energy force into the perfection of his physical form. Physically, he is the most powerful of the Elders but he is unable to channel the energy into force blasts, flight, matter manipulation, telepathy or to increase his intelligence as the other Elders can.

The Champion possesses vast physical strength, that is only limited by the amount of cosmic force that his body can contain. The Thing noted that the Champion hit him harder than either the Hulk or the Silver Surfer (without wearing the Power Gem at the time). When Reed Richards measured the residual power levels left behind when Champion abducted Thing, he declared that the Champion was on a higher level than Galactus. This does not likely represent Galactus&#x27; maximum power levels though, as Reed&#x27;s measurements would have been based on Galactus&#x27; strength in one of their six previous meetings, during several of which Galactus was extremely weakened from hunger.

The Champion&#x27;s body does not tire from physical exertion, since his musculature generates no lactic acids and, as the Power Primordial sustains him, he is not limited by the need for food, drink, or sleep, and is virtually immune to aging, diseases and infections. He can exist unprotected in the vacuum of space indefinitely. He is extremely resistant against all forms of conventional injury, and in addition Death has barred the Elders from entering its realm, literally making the Champion immortal. However, this does not make him immune to damage. The Champion&#x27;s ribs have been broken by the Thing, and he has been beaten unconscious by the She-Hulk, or the power cosmic of the Silver Surfer.

The Champion is a master hand-to-hand combatant in a wide range of thousands of different martial arts and fighting-styles taken from locations across the Universe, but tends to prefer boxing.

While possessing the Infinity Gem of Power, the Champion unconsciously used it to further increase his power with his rage, so that during his fight with Thanos his strength increased to the point where he destroyed the planet on which they were fighting with a single punch. While wielding the Gem of Power as a good luck charm, Champion was able to manipulate entire battlefields for his amusement. He could withstand direct, point blank and consistent shots of Thanos&#x27;s energy beams at full power. Thanos noted that the Champion&#x27;s rampage was one of the few forces that could cause his personal force field to buckle and disengage.

== Characteristics ==
The Champion is a thoroughly ruthless and cold-blooded individual ever searching for the thrill of battle. When first introduced he was more than willing to annihilate the entire population on Earth unless a fighter would defeat him limited to boxing rules. However he relented when impressed by the Thing&#x27;s ability to give him a challenge (breaking his ribs), and relentless spirit never to give up, and spared the Earth and declared the bout a draw rather than kill his opponent. When collaborating with the other Elders he schemed to destroy the Universe to be reborn as new versions of Galactus. In the miniseries &quot;Thanos Quest&quot; he killed an entire planetary population of soldiers just for sport. Later he assumed leadership of another planet and indifferently set the population to civil war, to provoke worthy challengers into seeking him out to put a stop to it. He is a strong male chauvinist and does not consider women as opponents worthy of him, only &quot;appreciating&quot; their value as courtesans or breeding stock.

The Power Primordial sustains the Elders through their desire and will to continue pursuing their various interests. The Champion&#x27;s interests are fighting, training to fight, and seeking opponents to fight. If the Champion were to grow uninterested in his pursuits and chose not to continue them, he could potentially die as a result, although since Death decreed no Elder could ever enter its realm, this may no longer be true.

Although several billion years old, the Champion is not as intelligent as most other known Elders of the Universe, partially because most have chosen to develop their minds along with their physical bodies. Regardless, he has some familiarity with advanced alien technologies that surpass the understanding of most Earthlings and has been shown as a crafty strategist when not blinded by rage.

<text>The Beyonder () is a fictional cosmic entity appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Jim Shooter and artist Mike Zeck, the Beyonder first appeared in &quot;Secret Wars&quot; #1 (May 1984) as an unseen, nigh-omnipotent being from outside the multiverse who kidnapped the heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe to have them do battle on Battleworld, a fictional planet created by the Beyonder. The character plays a more antagonistic role in the 1985 sequel, &quot;Secret Wars II&quot;, in which he takes human form to learn about desire but threatens to destroy the multiverse out of increasing frustration.

Following &quot;Secret Wars&quot; and &quot;Secret Wars II&quot;, the Beyonder experienced many notable retcons. At first, he was changed to a Cosmic Cube that was incomplete because of the Molecule Man. The Illuminati suggested he was a mutant Inhuman. Finally, he is revealed to be a &quot;child&quot; of the Beyonder race.

==Publication history==
Created by writer Jim Shooter and artist Mike Zeck, the Beyonder first appeared in &quot;Secret Wars&quot; #1, as an unseen, apparently nearly omnipotent being. He reappears in &quot;Secret Wars II&quot; #1 (July 1985), which was written by Jim Shooter and drawn by Al Milgrom.

==Fictional character biography==

===&quot;Secret Wars&quot;===
The Beyonder is the manifestation of the &quot;Beyond-Realm&quot;, which exists separately from the multiverse. This dimension was accidentally accessed by lab technician Owen Reece; some of the energy from the dimension escapes and imbues Reece with infinite powers, which he wields as the villainous Molecule Man, and the remaining energy gains sentience and becomes the Beyonder. The Beyonder creates a planet called Battleworld out of pieces of various planets and abducts a number of superheroes and supervillains from Earth and forces them to fight each other so that he can observe the never-ending battle between good and evil. During this time, his powers are briefly stolen by Doctor Doom.

===&quot;Secret Wars II&quot;===
Intrigued by what he has witnessed during the first Secret Wars, the Beyonder comes to Earth during the &quot;Secret Wars II&quot; story line to walk among humans and study them and learn of human desire firsthand. He creates a human body for himself (this body originally resembles Molecule Man). He also transforms a television writer named Steward Cadwell into Thundersword. Finally, the Beyonder creates a form for himself based on that of Captain America after witnessing him defeat Armadillo.

After learning of the importance of money from Luke Cage, the Beyonder turns a building into pure gold, causing Spider-Man to rescue those trapped in the building, while the U.S. government works to get rid of the gold to avoid a financial crisis. The Beyonder later meets the blind superhero Daredevil and restores his sight, asking for legal representation in return. After realizing that the desire to protect his eyesight might compromise his integrity and dedication, Daredevil demands that the Beyonder take his sight away again, which he does. After becoming involved with a woman named Sharon Ing, when we learn that he is open to loving women and men and can also change his own gender, Beyonder attempts to get Dazzler to fall in love with him, but fails, leading to feelings of despair. Following this, the Beyonder is recruited to be a professional wrestler and is nearly killed by Thing in a UCWF wrestling match.

In order to combat Beyonder, Mephisto sent his demon agent Bitterhorn to form the Legion Accursed. While waiting for the Legion Accursed to arrive, Mephisto tricked Thing into signing a contract that would increase his strength. When the Legion had arrived, Thing had to defend Beyonder from them. By the time Mephisto planned to drop his contract with Thing, nearly all of the Legion were defeated. Due to Beyonder and Thing ruining his plan, Mephisto returned all the villains to where they were before he began his scheme.

After being encouraged to find enlightenment by Doctor Strange, and failing, a frustrated Beyonder decides to destroy the entire multiverse, leading to several more battles with various Marvel superheroes, all of which end up with the Beyonder victorious. The Beyonder is finally defeated by a huge group of superheroes, including the Fantastic Four, X-Men, Avengers, and Spider-Man, after the Molecule Man intervenes and kills him, while he had temporarily transformed into an infant in the midst of a re-birthing process. The Beyonder&#x27;s energy returns to the Beyond-Realm, where it evolves into a new universe.

====&quot;Deadpool Team-Up&quot;====
Long after the &quot;Secret Wars II&quot; crossover had ended, a Deadpool special featured the &quot;Secret Wars II continues in this issue&quot; corner tag that was used during that original storyline. In this issue, a younger, less-experienced Deadpool is hired by the Kingpin to kill the Beyonder. The flashback sequence ends with Deadpool chasing him into a portal with a footnote saying &quot;to be continued in Secret Wars III&quot;.

===Kosmos and the Maker===
The tale of the Beyonder continues several years later when it is revealed that, in the distant past, the enigmatic Beyonders created pocket universes holding vast amounts of sentient energy. Some are tapped into by various beings, including Skrulls and humans, to create reality-warping Cosmic Cubes. The Beyonder is told that this is his origin, but he is missing a containment vessel and the Molecule Man absorbed part of his energy. They merge and shape themselves into a Cube.

The Cube expels the Molecule Man from its form, returning him to Earth, and soon evolves into the cosmic being known as Kosmos. Kosmos takes on a female form and is tutored by Kubik, touring the universe with him. When the Molecule Man&#x27;s lover Volcana leaves him, he becomes angry, extracts the Beyonder from Kosmos, and proceeds to attack him until Kubik intervenes.

At some unknown point, Kosmos becomes insane and assumes a mortal form, now calling itself the Maker. After the amnesiac Maker destroys a Shi&#x27;ar colony, the Imperial Guard imprison it in the interstellar prison called the Kyln. The Maker&#x27;s madness takes control of several inmates but is finally subdued by Thanos and several of his allies among the prisoners. Thanos confronts the Maker, and, by refusing to reveal its origins at a critical juncture, manipulates it to psychically shut down its own mind. Thanos instructs the Shi&#x27;ar that the body should be kept alive but brain-dead, or the Beyonder essence would go free again.

In the &quot;Annihilation&quot; crossover story line, the Fallen One, a former Herald of Galactus under the control of Thanos, is sent to investigate the aftermath of the Kyln&#x27;s destruction by the Annihilation Wave and ascertain the Beyonder&#x27;s fate. The Fallen One finds the lifeless form of the Maker in the rubble, confirming the Beyonder&#x27;s freedom.

===The Illuminati===

In a retcon of past events, Charles Xavier reveals to his fellow Illuminati members that in the original Secret War, he had attempted to mind-scan the Beyonder, revealing him as one of the Inhumans previously ruled over by Black Bolt. Xavier also deduced the apparent secret behind the Beyonder&#x27;s seemingly godlike abilities, which was that the Beyonder was not only an Inhuman but also a mutant, and the exposure of his mutant genes to Terrigen Mists had created an unprecedented power.
This revelation leads to a confrontation with the Beyonder during the events of the second Secret War, wherein Black Bolt expresses his extreme displeasure toward the Beyonder&#x27;s activities. When encountered, the Beyonder is dwelling in a simulacrum of Manhattan Island on Ceres. The Illuminati convince the Beyonder to leave the universe, causing the Beyonder&#x27;s human form and his simulacrum city to crumble into dust. However, Black Bolt admits that he has no memory of an Inhuman becoming the Beyonder, and the final image of the story reveals that the entire event was in the pupil of the Beyonder&#x27;s right eye, thus making the revelations dubious.

===Time Runs Out===
Hank Pym is sent by the Illuminati to investigate the Incursions and the collapsing multiverse. Upon discovering the truth of the Ivory Kings, Pym returns to the Illuminati to warn them about their enemy: the Beyonders. He refers to the Beyonder from the original Secret Wars as a &quot;child unit&quot; of the Beyonders.

The Molecule Man later reiterates the same thing while also revealing that the accident that gave him his power and the &quot;child Beyonder&quot; his awareness was engineered by the Beyonders.

===Defenders===
The Beyonder appears to the Defenders after they left the multiverse. He explains the history of the Beyonders before reluctantly joining the Defenders on their quest. Upon reaching the House of Ideas, he decides to break free from and leave the story of The One-Above-All, promising to return on his own terms.

==Powers and abilities==
The Beyonder is an infinite-dimensional, or beyond-dimensional, entity and was originally portrayed as the most powerful being in the Marvel Comics multiverse, and as the be-all and end-all of the &quot;Beyond Realm&quot;, that took human form to better understand the nature of human beings.

The narration stated that he possessed power millions of times greater than the entire multiverse combined, and that a regular universe was a drop of water in the ocean compared to the Beyond Realm.

The Beyonder proved capable of destroying, and recreating, the abstract entity known as Death across the multiverse, although it extremely exerted and weakened him to do so. However, even in this state, he was capable of easily sending a horde of demons back to hell with a wave of his hand.

Despite his power, the Beyonder has shown moments of vulnerability. He was overwhelmed when Rachel Summers returned the enormous powers that he had bestowed upon her along with the thoughts of the past and present beings in the universe, to the point that he collapsed on the ground, and he was apparently slowed down in battle against the Molecule Man. He also lost part, or all, of his power on various occasions, some of them engineered by himself. He also stated that the Puma—when in perfect harmony with the Universe—was capable of killing him. However, on another occasion, after trying to be a superhero by fighting a superpowered biker gang, the Beyonder stated that he limits his powers to keep them more in line with the world around him.

After his creator, Jim Shooter, left Marvel, writer-editor Tom DeFalco re-tooled the Beyonder, diminishing his power greatly: He was no longer nearly omnipotent, and several of the cosmic beings who were previously established to be below him in power were vastly upgraded in conjunction.

Nonetheless, the Beyonder retained his reality-warping powers, allowing him to control and manipulate matter, energy, and reality at a cosmic level beyond all but the strongest and most powerful of cosmic entities.

He repelled Galactus &quot;like a bug&quot;, and exceeded the collected energy of the latter&#x27;s World-Ship. He once destroyed a galaxy on a whim to meet his needs during the first Secret Wars, and later created a universe out of his own being. When the Molecule Man extracted the Beyonder from Kosmos, their battle took place in more than three spatial dimensions, and threatened to cause vast destruction across the multiverse. In Kosmos&#x27; &#x27;Maker&#x27; incarnation, she was stated as capable of reversing The Crunch itself, essentially collapsing the universe. However, his scale of power was stated to be significantly below the Living Tribunal and Eternity, the Celestials, or Molecule Man.

After The Beyonder was retconned again to be a child of the race of Beyonders, and he was later seen fully grown and interacting with an assembly of them, his power was presumably upgraded to a similar scale to them, and other Beyonders have together managed to kill the Living Tribunal and all of the Celestials in the Marvel multiverse. However, it was stated that he is considerably less powerful than the multiversal Phoenix Force.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;===
In &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, the Beyonder provides Guardian Vance Astro with a black undergarment resembling a Symbiote. Later, he attempts to hold captive the ruler of the Universal Church of Truth, Protégé. Protégé retaliates using his limitless ability to copy the abilities of other beings to become a match for the Beyonder. They battle until Eternity and The Living Tribunal intervene.

===&quot;Heroes Reborn&quot;===
In an alternate reality depicted in the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; storyline, a character named Mister Beyonder appears as an inmate of the Negative Zone before escaping and confronting Hyperion, claiming that his reality is not what it seems. Despite being perturbed by his words, Hyperion defeats Mister Beyonder.

===&quot;Mutant X&quot;===
In &quot;Mutant X&quot;, the Beyonder allies with Dracula to wage war on Earth&#x27;s forces and confront the Goblyn Queen.

===&quot;Spider-Ham&quot;===
The Bee-Yonder, a funny animal version of the Beyonder from Earth-8311, appears in &quot;Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham&quot;.

<text>Tibet (; &quot;Böd&quot;; ), or Greater Tibet, is a region in the western part of East Asia, covering much of the Tibetan Plateau and spanning about . It is the homeland of the Tibetan people. Also resident on the plateau are other ethnic groups such as Mongols, Monpa, Tamang, Qiang, Sherpa, Lhoba, and since the 20th century Han Chinese and Hui. Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of . Located in the Himalayas, the highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth&#x27;s highest mountain, rising above sea level.

The Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century. At its height in the 9th century, the Tibetan Empire extended far beyond the Tibetan Plateau, from the Tarim Basin and Pamirs in the west, to Yunnan and Bengal in the southeast. It then divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet (Ü-Tsang) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations. The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling under Chinese rule; most of this area was eventually annexed into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai. The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century.

Following the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Ü-Tsang, but it has been constitutionally claimed by the Republic of China as the Tibet Area. The 13th Dalai Lama declared the region&#x27;s independence in 1913, although it was neither recognised by the Chinese Republican government nor any foreign power. Lhasa later took control of western Xikang as well. The region maintained its autonomy until 1951 when, following the Battle of Chamdo, it was occupied and annexed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). The entire plateau came under PRC administration. The Tibetan government was abolished after the failure of the 1959 Tibetan uprising. Today, China governs western and central Tibet as the Xizang Autonomous Region while the eastern areas are now mostly autonomous prefectures within Qinghai, Gansu, Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.

The Tibetan independence movement is principally led by the Tibetan diaspora. Human rights groups have accused the Chinese government of abuses of human rights in Tibet, including torture, arbitrary arrests, and religious repression, with the Chinese government tightly controlling information and denying external scrutiny. While there are conflicting reports on the scale of human rights violations, including allegations of cultural genocide and the Sinicization of Tibet, widespread suppression of Tibetan culture and dissent continues to be documented.

The dominant religion in Tibet is Tibetan Buddhism; other religions include Bön, an indigenous religion similar to Tibetan Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. Tibetan Buddhism is a primary influence on the art, music, and festivals of the region. Tibetan architecture reflects Chinese and Indian influences. Staple foods in Tibet are roasted barley, yak meat, and butter tea. With the growth of tourism in recent years, the service sector has become the largest sector in Tibet, accounting for 50.1% of the local GDP in 2020.

== Names and etymologies ==

The Tibetan name for their land, &quot;Bod&quot; (), means &#x27;Tibet&#x27; or &#x27;Tibetan Plateau&#x27;, although it originally meant the central region around Lhasa, now known in Tibetan as &quot;Ü&quot; (). The Standard Tibetan pronunciation of &quot;Bod&quot; () is transcribed as: &quot;Bhö&quot; in Tournadre Phonetic Transcription; &quot;Bö&quot; in the THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription; and &quot;Poi&quot; in Tibetan pinyin. Some scholars believe the first written reference to &quot;Bod&quot; (&#x27;Tibet&#x27;) was the ancient Bautai people recorded in the Egyptian-Greek works &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; (1st century CE) and &quot;Geographia&quot; (Ptolemy, 2nd century CE), itself from the Sanskrit form &quot;Bhauṭṭa&quot; of the Indian geographical tradition.

The best-known medieval Chinese name for Tibet is &quot;Tubo&quot; (; or , or , ). This name first appears in Chinese characters as in the 7th century (Li Tai) and as in the 10th century (&quot;Old Book of Tang&quot;, describing 608–609 emissaries from Tibetan King Namri Songtsen to Emperor Yang of Sui). In the Middle Chinese language spoken during that period, as reconstructed by William H. Baxter, was pronounced &quot;thu-phjon&quot;, and was pronounced &quot;thu-pjon&quot; (with the &quot;&quot; representing a &quot;shang&quot; tone).

Other pre-modern Chinese names for Tibet include:
* &quot;Wusiguo&quot; (; cf. Tibetan: &quot;dbus&quot;, Ü, );
* &quot;Wusizang&quot; (, cf. Tibetan: &quot;dbus-gtsang&quot;, Ü-Tsang);
* &quot;Tubote&quot; (); and
* &quot;Tanggute&quot; (, cf. Tangut).

American Tibetologist Elliot Sperling has argued in favor of a recent tendency by some authors writing in Chinese to revive the term &quot;Tubote&quot; () for modern use in place of &quot;Xizang&quot;, on the grounds that &quot;Tubote&quot; more clearly includes the entire Tibetan plateau rather than simply the Tibet Autonomous Region.

The English word &quot;Tibet&quot; or &quot;Thibet&quot; dates back to the 18th century. Historical linguists generally agree that &quot;Tibet&quot; names in European languages are loanwords from Arabic or (), itself deriving from Turkic &quot;&quot; (plural of ), literally &#x27;The Heights&#x27;.

== Language ==
Linguists generally classify the Tibetan language as a Tibeto-Burman language of the Sino-Tibetan language family, although the boundaries between &#x27;Tibetan&#x27; and certain other Himalayan languages can be unclear. According to Matthew Kapstein:
From the perspective of historical linguistics, Tibetan most closely resembles Burmese among the major languages of Asia. Grouping these two together with other apparently related languages spoken in the Himalayan lands, as well as in the highlands of Southeast Asia and the Sino-Tibetan frontier regions, linguists have generally concluded that there exists a Tibeto-Burman family of languages. More controversial is the theory that the Tibeto-Burman family is itself part of a larger language family, called Sino-Tibetan, and that through it Tibetan and Burmese are distant cousins of Chinese.

The language has numerous regional dialects which are generally not mutually intelligible. It is employed throughout the Tibetan plateau and Bhutan and is also spoken in parts of Nepal and northern India, such as Sikkim. In general, the dialects of central Tibet (including Lhasa), Kham, Amdo and some smaller nearby areas are considered Tibetan dialects. Other forms, particularly Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Sherpa, and Ladakhi, are considered by their speakers, largely for political reasons, to be separate languages. However, if the latter group of Tibetan-type languages are included in the calculation, then &#x27;greater Tibetan&#x27; is spoken by approximately 6 million people across the Tibetan Plateau. Tibetan is also spoken by approximately 150,000 exile speakers who have fled from modern-day Tibet to India and other countries.

Although spoken Tibetan varies according to the region, the written language, based on Classical Tibetan, is consistent throughout. This is probably due to the long-standing influence of the Tibetan empire, whose rule embraced (and extended at times far beyond) the present Tibetan linguistic area, which runs from Gilgit Baltistan in the west to Yunnan and Sichuan in the east, and from north of Qinghai Lake south as far as Bhutan. The Tibetan language has its own script which it shares with Ladakhi and Dzongkha, and which is derived from the ancient Indian Brāhmī script.

Starting in 2001, the local deaf sign languages of Tibet were standardized, and Tibetan Sign Language is now being promoted across the country.

The first Tibetan-English dictionary and grammar book was written by Alexander Csoma de Kőrös in 1834.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Humans inhabited the Tibetan Plateau at least 21,000 years ago. This population was largely replaced around 3,000 BP by Neolithic immigrants from northern China, but there is a partial genetic continuity between the Paleolithic inhabitants and contemporary Tibetan populations.

The earliest Tibetan historical texts identify the Zhang Zhung culture as a people who migrated from the Amdo region into what is now the region of Guge in western Tibet. Zhang Zhung is considered to be the original home of the Bön religion. By the 1st century BCE, a neighboring kingdom arose in the Yarlung valley, and the Yarlung king, Drigum Tsenpo, attempted to remove the influence of the Zhang Zhung by expelling the Zhang&#x27;s Bön priests from Yarlung. He was assassinated and Zhang Zhung continued its dominance of the region until it was annexed by Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century. Prior to Songtsen Gampo, the kings of Tibet were more mythological than factual, and there is insufficient evidence of their existence.

=== Tibetan Empire ===
The history of a unified Tibet begins with the rule of Songtsen Gampo (604–650CE), who united parts of the Yarlung River Valley and founded the Tibetan Empire. He also brought in many reforms, and Tibetan power spread rapidly, creating a large and powerful empire. It is traditionally considered that his first wife was the Princess of Nepal, Bhrikuti, and that she played a great role in the establishment of Buddhism in Tibet. In 640, he married Princess Wencheng, the niece of the Chinese emperor Taizong of Tang China.

Under the next few Tibetan kings, Buddhism became established as the state religion and Tibetan power increased even further over large areas of Central Asia, while major inroads were made into Chinese territory, even reaching the Tang&#x27;s capital Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an) in late 763. However, the Tibetan occupation of Chang&#x27;an only lasted for fifteen days, after which they were defeated by Tang and its ally, the Turkic Uyghur Khaganate.

The Kingdom of Nanzhao (in Yunnan and neighbouring regions) remained under Tibetan control from 750 to 794, when they turned on their Tibetan overlords and helped the Chinese inflict a serious defeat on the Tibetans.

In 747, the hold of Tibet was loosened by the campaign of general Gao Xianzhi, who tried to re-open the direct communications between Central Asia and Kashmir. By 750, the Tibetans had lost almost all of their central Asian possessions to the Chinese. However, after Gao Xianzhi&#x27;s defeat by the Arabs and Qarluqs at the Battle of Talas (751) and the subsequent civil war known as the An Lushan Rebellion (755), Chinese influence decreased rapidly and Tibetan influence resumed.

At its height in the 780s to 790s, the Tibetan Empire reached its highest glory when it ruled and controlled a territory stretching from modern-day Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, China, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan.

In 821/822CE, Tibet and China signed a peace treaty. A bilingual account of this treaty, including details of the borders between the two countries, is inscribed on a stone pillar which stands outside the Jokhang temple in Lhasa. Tibet continued as a Central Asian empire until the mid-9th century, when a civil war over succession led to the collapse of imperial Tibet. The period that followed is known traditionally as the &quot;Era of Fragmentation&quot;, when political control over Tibet became divided between regional warlords and tribes with no dominant centralized authority. An Islamic invasion from Bengal took place in 1206.

=== Yuan dynasty ===
The Mongol Yuan dynasty, through the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs, or Xuanzheng Yuan, ruled Tibet through a top-level administrative department. One of the department&#x27;s purposes was to select a &quot;dpon-chen&quot; (&quot;great administrator&quot;), usually appointed by the lama and confirmed by the Mongol emperor in Beijing. The Sakya lama retained a degree of autonomy, acting as the political authority of the region, while the &quot;dpon-chen&quot; held administrative and military power. Mongol rule of Tibet remained separate from the main provinces of China, but the region existed under the administration of the Yuan dynasty. If the Sakya lama ever came into conflict with the &quot;dpon-chen&quot;, the &quot;dpon-chen&quot; had the authority to send Chinese troops into the region.

Tibet retained nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrative rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention. This existed as a &quot;diarchic structure&quot; under the Yuan emperor, with power primarily in favor of the Mongols. Mongolian prince Khuden gained temporal power in Tibet in the 1240s and sponsored Sakya Pandita, whose seat became the capital of Tibet. Drogön Chögyal Phagpa, Sakya Pandita&#x27;s nephew became Imperial Preceptor of Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty.

Yuan control over the region ended with the Ming overthrow of the Yuan and Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen&#x27;s revolt against the Mongols. Following the uprising, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen founded the Phagmodrupa dynasty, and sought to reduce Yuan influences over Tibetan culture and politics.

=== Phagmodrupa, Rinpungpa and Tsangpa dynasties ===

Between 1346 and 1354, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen toppled the Sakya and founded the Phagmodrupa dynasty. The following 80 years saw the founding of the Gelug school (also known as Yellow Hats) by the disciples of Je Tsongkhapa, and the founding of the important Ganden, Drepung and Sera monasteries near Lhasa. However, internal strife within the dynasty and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family Rinpungpa, based in Tsang (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435. In 1565 they were overthrown by the Tsangpa dynasty of Shigatse which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the Karma Kagyu sect.

=== Rise of Ganden Phodrang and Buddhist Gelug school ===

In 1578, Altan Khan of the Tümed Mongols gave Sonam Gyatso, a high lama of the Gelugpa school, the name &quot;Dalai Lama&quot;, &quot;Dalai&quot; being the Mongolian translation of the Tibetan name &quot;Gyatso&quot; &quot;Ocean&quot;.

The 5th Dalai Lama (1617–1682) is known for unifying the Tibetan heartland under the control of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, after defeating the rival Kagyu and Jonang sects and the secular ruler, the Tsangpa prince, in a prolonged civil war. His efforts were successful in part because of aid from Güshi Khan, the Oirat leader of the Khoshut Khanate. With Güshi Khan as a largely uninvolved overlord, the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates established a civil administration which is referred to by historians as the &quot;Lhasa state&quot;. This Tibetan regime or government is also referred to as the Ganden Phodrang.

=== Qing dynasty ===
Qing dynasty rule in Tibet began with their 1720 expedition to the country when they expelled the invading Dzungars. Amdo came under Qing control in 1724, and eastern Kham was incorporated into neighbouring Chinese provinces in 1728. Meanwhile, the Qing government sent resident commissioners called &quot;Ambans&quot; to Lhasa. In 1750, the Ambans and the majority of the Han Chinese and Manchus living in Lhasa were killed in a riot, and Qing troops arrived quickly and suppressed the rebels in the next year. Like the preceding Yuan dynasty, the Manchus of the Qing dynasty exerted military and administrative control of the region, while granting it a degree of political autonomy. The Qing commander publicly executed a number of supporters of the rebels and, as in 1723 and 1728, made changes in the political structure and drew up a formal organization plan. The Qing now restored the Dalai Lama as ruler, leading the governing council called &quot;Kashag&quot;, but elevated the role of &quot;Ambans&quot; to include more direct involvement in Tibetan internal affairs. At the same time, the Qing took steps to counterbalance the power of the aristocracy by adding officials recruited from the clergy to key posts.

For several decades, peace reigned in Tibet, but in 1792, the Qing Qianlong Emperor sent a large Chinese army into Tibet to push the invading Nepalese out. This prompted yet another Qing reorganization of the Tibetan government, this time through a written plan called the &quot;Twenty-Nine Regulations for Better Government in Tibet&quot;. Qing military garrisons staffed with Qing troops were now also established near the Nepalese border. Tibet was dominated by the Manchus in various stages in the 18th century, and the years immediately following the 1792 regulations were the peak of the Qing imperial commissioners&#x27; authority; but there was no attempt to make Tibet a Chinese province.

In 1834, the Sikh Empire invaded and annexed Ladakh, a culturally Tibetan region that was an independent kingdom at the time. Seven years later, a Sikh army led by General Zorawar Singh invaded western Tibet from Ladakh, starting the Sino-Sikh War. A Qing-Tibetan army repelled the invaders but was in turn defeated when it chased the Sikhs into Ladakh. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Chushul between the Chinese and Sikh empires.

As the Qing dynasty weakened, its authority over Tibet also gradually declined, and by the mid-19th century, its influence was minuscule. Qing authority over Tibet had become more symbolic than real by the late 19th century, although in the 1860s, the Tibetans still chose for reasons of their own to emphasize the empire&#x27;s symbolic authority and make it seem substantial.

In 1774, a Scottish nobleman, George Bogle, travelled to Shigatse to investigate prospects of trade for the East India Company. His efforts, while largely unsuccessful, established permanent contact between Tibet and the Western world. However, in the 19th century, tensions between foreign powers and Tibet increased. The British Empire was expanding its territories in India into the Himalayas, while the Emirate of Afghanistan and the Russian Empire were both doing likewise in Central Asia.

In 1904, a British expedition to Tibet, spurred in part by a fear that Russia was extending its power into Tibet as part of the Great Game, was launched. Although the expedition initially set out with the stated purpose of resolving border disputes between Tibet and Sikkim, it quickly turned into a military invasion. The British expeditionary force, consisting of mostly Indian troops, quickly invaded and captured Lhasa, with the Dalai Lama fleeing to the countryside. Afterwards, the leader of the expedition, Sir Francis Younghusband, negotiated the Convention Between Great Britain and Tibet with the Tibetans, which guaranteed the British great economic influence but ensured the region remained under Chinese control. The Qing imperial resident, known as the Amban, publicly repudiated the treaty, while the British government, eager for friendly relations with China, negotiated a new treaty two years later known as the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet. The British agreed not to annex or interfere in Tibet in return for an indemnity from the Chinese government, while China agreed not to permit any other foreign state to interfere with the territory or internal administration of Tibet.

In 1910, the Qing government sent a military expedition of its own under Zhao Erfeng to establish direct Manchu-Chinese rule and, in an imperial edict, deposed the Dalai Lama, who fled to British India. Zhao Erfeng defeated the Tibetan military conclusively and expelled the Dalai Lama&#x27;s forces from the province. His actions were unpopular, and there was much animosity against him for his mistreatment of civilians and disregard for local culture.

=== Post-Qing period ===


After the Xinhai Revolution (1911–1912) toppled the Qing dynasty and the last Qing troops were escorted out of Tibet, the new Republic of China apologized for the actions of the Qing and offered to restore the Dalai Lama&#x27;s title. The Dalai Lama refused any Chinese title and declared himself ruler of an independent Tibet. In 1913, Tibet and Outer Mongolia concluded a treaty of mutual recognition. The ROC continued to view the former Qing territory as its own, including Tibet. For the next 36 years, the 13th Dalai Lama and the regents who succeeded him governed Tibet. During this time, Tibet fought Chinese warlords for control of the ethnically Tibetan areas in Xikang and Qinghai (parts of Kham and Amdo) along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. In 1914, the Tibetan government signed the Simla Convention with Britain, which recognized Chinese suzerainty over Tibet in return for a border settlement. China refused to sign the convention. Tibet continued to lack clear boundaries or international recognition of its status.

When in the 1930s and 1940s the regents displayed negligence in affairs, the Kuomintang Government of the Republic of China took advantage of this to expand its reach into the territory. On December 20, 1941, Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-Shek noted in his diary that Tibet would be among the territories which he would demand as restitution for China following the conclusion of World War II.

=== From 1950 to present ===
Emerging with control over most of mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, the People&#x27;s Republic of China annexed Tibet in 1950 and negotiated the Seventeen Point Agreement with the newly enthroned 14th Dalai Lama&#x27;s government, affirming the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s sovereignty but granting the area autonomy. Subsequently, on his journey into exile, the 14th Dalai Lama completely repudiated the agreement, which he has repeated on many occasions. According to the CIA, the Chinese used the Dalai Lama to gain control of the military&#x27;s training and actions.

The Dalai Lama had a strong following as many people from Tibet looked at him not just as their political leader, but as their spiritual leader. After the Dalai Lama&#x27;s government fled to Dharamsala, India, during the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion, it established a rival government-in-exile. Afterwards, the Central People&#x27;s Government in Beijing renounced the agreement and began implementation of the halted social and political reforms. During the Great Leap Forward, over 200,000 Tibetans may have died and approximately 6,000 monasteries were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution—destroying the vast majority of historic Tibetan architecture.

In 1980, General Secretary and reformist Hu Yaobang visited Tibet and ushered in a period of social, political, and economic liberalization. At the end of the decade, however, before the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, monks in the Drepung and Sera monasteries started protesting for independence. The government halted reforms and started an anti-separatist campaign. Human rights organisations have been critical of the Beijing and Lhasa governments&#x27; approach to human rights in the region when cracking down on separatist convulsions that have occurred around monasteries and cities, most recently in the 2008 Tibetan unrest.

The central region of Tibet is now an autonomous region within China, the Tibet Autonomous Region. The Tibet Autonomous Region is a province-level entity of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is governed by a People&#x27;s Government, led by a chairman. In practice, however, the chairman is subordinate to the branch secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In 2010 it was reported that, as a matter of convention, the chairman had almost always been an ethnic Tibetan, while the party secretary had always been ethnically non-Tibetan.

== Geography ==

All of modern China, including Tibet, is considered a part of East Asia. Historically, some European sources also considered parts of Tibet to lie in Central Asia. Tibet is west of the Central China plain. In China, Tibet is regarded as part of (), a term usually translated by Chinese media as &quot;the Western section&quot;, meaning &quot;Western China&quot;.

=== Mountains and rivers ===
Tibet has some of the world&#x27;s tallest mountains, with several of them making the top ten list. Mount Everest, located on the border with Nepal, is, at , the highest mountain on earth. Several major rivers have their source in the Tibetan Plateau (mostly in present-day Qinghai Province). These include the Yangtze, Yellow River, Indus River, Mekong, Ganges, Salween and the Yarlung Tsangpo River (Brahmaputra River). The Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon, along the Yarlung Tsangpo River, is among the deepest and longest canyons in the world.

Tibet has been called the &quot;Water Tower&quot; of Asia, and China is investing heavily in water projects in Tibet.

The Indus and Brahmaputra rivers originate from the vicinities of Lake Mapam Yumco in Western Tibet, near Mount Kailash. The mountain is a holy pilgrimage site for both Hindus and Tibetans. The Hindus consider the mountain to be the abode of Lord Shiva. The Tibetan name for Mount Kailash is Khang Rinpoche. Tibet has numerous high-altitude lakes referred to in Tibetan as &quot;tso&quot; or &quot;co&quot;. These include Qinghai Lake, Lake Manasarovar, Namtso, Pangong Tso, Yamdrok Lake, Siling Co, Lhamo La-tso, Lumajangdong Co, Lake Puma Yumco, Lake Paiku, Como Chamling, Lake Rakshastal, Dagze Co and Dong Co. The Qinghai Lake (Koko Nor) is the largest lake in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

=== Climate ===
The climate is severely dry nine months of the year, and average annual snowfall is only , due to the rain shadow effect. Western passes receive small amounts of fresh snow each year but remain traversible all year round. Low temperatures are prevalent throughout these western regions, where bleak desolation is unrelieved by any vegetation bigger than a low bush, and where the wind sweeps unchecked across vast expanses of arid plain. The Indian monsoon exerts some influence on eastern Tibet. Northern Tibet is subject to high temperatures in the summer and intense cold in the winter.


=== Wildlife ===
&quot;Sus scrofa&quot; expanded from its origin in southeast Asia into the Plateau, acquiring and fixing adaptive alleles for the high-altitude environment. The forests of Tibet are home to black bears, red pandas, musk deer, barking deer, and squirrels. Monkeys such as rhesus macaques and langurs live in the warmer forest zones. Tibetan antelopes, gazelles, and kiangs gaze on the grasslands of the Tibetan plateau. There are more than 500 bird species in Tibet. Because of the high altitude and harsh climate, there are few insects in Tibet.

Snow leopards are hunted for their fur and the eggs of black-necked cranes have been collected as a delicacy food.

=== Regions ===

Cultural Tibet consists of several regions. These include Amdo (&quot;A mdo&quot;) in the northeast, which is administratively part of the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, and Sichuan. Kham (&quot;Khams&quot;) in the southeast encompasses parts of western Sichuan, northern Yunnan, southern Qinghai, and the eastern part of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Ü-Tsang (&quot;dBus gTsang&quot;) (Ü in the center, Tsang in the center-west, and Ngari (&quot;mNga&#x27; ris&quot;) in the far west) covered the central and western portion of Tibet Autonomous Region.

Tibetan cultural influences extend to the neighboring states of Bhutan, Nepal, regions of India such as Sikkim, Ladakh, Lahaul, and Spiti, Northern Pakistan Baltistan or Balti-yul in addition to designated Tibetan autonomous areas in adjacent Chinese provinces.

=== Cities, towns and villages ===
There are over 800 settlements in Tibet. Lhasa is Tibet&#x27;s traditional capital and the capital of Tibet Autonomous Region. It contains two world heritage sites – the Potala Palace and Norbulingka, which were the residences of the Dalai Lama. Lhasa contains a number of significant temples and monasteries, including Jokhang and Ramoche Temple.

Shigatse is the second largest city in the Tibet AR, west of Lhasa. Gyantse and Qamdo are also amongst the largest.

Other cities and towns in cultural Tibet include Shiquanhe (Gar), Nagchu, Bamda, Rutog, Nyingchi, Nedong, Coqên, Barkam, Sagya, Gertse, Pelbar, Lhatse, and Tingri; in Sichuan, Kangding (Dartsedo); in Qinghai, Jyekundo (Yushu), Machen, and Golmud; in India, Tawang, Leh, and Gangtok, and in Pakistan, Skardu, Kharmang, and Khaplu.

== Economy ==
The Tibetan economy is dominated by subsistence agriculture. Due to limited arable land, the primary occupation of the Tibetan Plateau is raising livestock, such as sheep, cattle, goats, camels, yaks, dzo, and horses.

The main crops grown are barley, wheat, buckwheat, rye, potatoes, and assorted fruits and vegetables. Tibet is ranked the lowest among China&#x27;s 31 provinces on the Human Development Index according to UN Development Programme data. In recent years, due to increased interest in Tibetan Buddhism, tourism has become an increasingly important sector, and is actively promoted by the authorities. Tourism brings in the most income from the sale of handicrafts. These include Tibetan hats, jewelry (silver and gold), wooden items, clothing, quilts, fabrics, Tibetan rugs and carpets. The Central People&#x27;s Government exempts Tibet from all taxation and provides 90% of Tibet&#x27;s government expenditures. However, most of this investment goes to pay migrant workers who do not settle in Tibet and send much of their income home to other provinces.
Forty percent of the rural cash income in the Tibet Autonomous Region is derived from the harvesting of the fungus &quot;Ophiocordyceps sinensis&quot; (formerly &quot;Cordyceps sinensis&quot;); contributing at least 1.8 billion yuan, (US$225 million) to the region&#x27;s GDP.

The Qingzang railway linking the Tibet Autonomous Region to Qinghai Province was opened in 2006, but it was controversial.

In January 2007, the Chinese government issued a report outlining the discovery of a large mineral deposit under the Tibetan Plateau. The deposit has an estimated value of $128 billion and may double Chinese reserves of zinc, copper, and lead. The Chinese government sees this as a way to alleviate the nation&#x27;s dependence on foreign mineral imports for its growing economy. However, critics worry that mining these vast resources will harm Tibet&#x27;s fragile ecosystem and undermine Tibetan culture.

On January 15, 2009, China announced the construction of Tibet&#x27;s first expressway, the Lhasa Airport Expressway, a stretch of controlled-access highway in southwestern Lhasa. The project will cost 1.55 billion yuan (US$227 million).

From January 18–20, 2010, a national conference on Tibet and areas inhabited by Tibetans in Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu and Qinghai was held in China and a plan to improve development of the areas was announced. The conference was attended by General secretary Hu Jintao, Wu Bangguo, Wen Jiabao, Jia Qinglin, Li Changchun, Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, He Guoqiang and Zhou Yongkang, all members of Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The plan called for improvement of rural Tibetan income to national standards by 2020 and free education for all rural Tibetan children. China has invested 310 billion yuan (about 45.6 billion U.S. dollars) in Tibet since 2001.

=== Development zone ===
The State Council approved Tibet Lhasa Economic and Technological Development Zone as a state-level development zone in 2001. It is located in the western suburbs of Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region. It is away from the Gonggar Airport, and away from Lhasa Railway Station and away from 318 national highway.

The zone has a planned area of and is divided into two zones. Zone A developed a land area of for construction purposes. It is a flat zone, and has the natural conditions for good drainage.

== Demographics ==

Historically, the population of Tibet consisted of primarily ethnic Tibetans and some other ethnic groups. According to tradition the original ancestors of the Tibetan people, as represented by the six red bands in the Tibetan flag, are: the Se, Mu, Dong, Tong, Dru and Ra. Other traditional ethnic groups with significant population or with the majority of the ethnic group residing in Tibet (excluding a disputed area with India) include Bai people, Blang, Bonan, Dongxiang, Han, Hui people, Lhoba, Lisu people, Miao, Mongols, Monguor (Tu people), Menba (Monpa), Mosuo, Nakhi, Qiang, Nu people, Pumi, Salar, and Yi people.

The proportion of the non-Tibetan population in Tibet is disputed. On the one hand, the Central Tibetan Administration of the Dalai Lama accuses China of actively swamping Tibet with migrants in order to alter Tibet&#x27;s demographic makeup. On the other hand, according to the 2010 Chinese census ethnic Tibetans comprise 90% of a total population of 3 million in the Tibet Autonomous Region.

== Culture ==

=== Religion ===
==== Buddhism ====

Religion is extremely important to the Tibetans and has a strong influence over all aspects of their lives. Bön is the indigenous religion of Tibet, but has been almost eclipsed by Tibetan Buddhism, a distinctive form of Mahayana and Vajrayana, which was introduced into Tibet from the Sanskrit Buddhist tradition of northern India. Tibetan Buddhism is practiced not only in Tibet but also in Mongolia, parts of northern India, the Buryat Republic, the Tuva Republic, and in the Republic of Kalmykia and some other parts of China. During China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution, nearly all Tibet&#x27;s monasteries were ransacked and destroyed by the Red Guards. A few monasteries have begun to rebuild since the 1980s (with limited support from the Chinese government) and greater religious freedom has been granted – although it is still limited. Monks returned to monasteries across Tibet and monastic education resumed even though the number of monks imposed is strictly limited. Before the 1950s, between 10 and 20% of males in Tibet were monks.

Tibetan Buddhism has five main traditions (the suffix &quot;pa&quot; is comparable to &quot;er&quot; in English):

* Gelug(pa), &quot;Way of Virtue&quot;, also known casually as &quot;Yellow Hat&quot;, whose spiritual head is the Ganden Tripa and whose temporal head is the Dalai Lama. Successive Dalai Lamas ruled Tibet from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries. This order was founded in the 14th to 15th centuries by Je Tsongkhapa, based on the foundations of the Kadampa tradition. Tsongkhapa was renowned for both his scholasticism and his virtue. The Dalai Lama belongs to the Gelugpa school, and is regarded as the embodiment of the Bodhisattva of Compassion.
* Kagyu(pa), &quot;Oral Lineage&quot;. This contains one major subsect and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to Gampopa. In turn, the Dagpo Kagyu consists of four major sub-sects: the Karma Kagyu, headed by a Karmapa, the Tsalpa Kagyu, the Barom Kagyu, and Pagtru Kagyu. The once-obscure Shangpa Kagyu, which was famously represented by the 20th-century teacher Kalu Rinpoche, traces its history back to the Indian master Niguma, sister of Kagyu lineage holder Naropa. This is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was Milarepa, an 11th-century mystic.
* Nyingma(pa), &quot;The Ancient Ones&quot;. This is the oldest, the original order founded by Padmasambhava.
* Sakya(pa), &quot;Grey Earth&quot;, headed by the Sakya Trizin, founded by Khon Konchog Gyalpo, a disciple of the great translator Drokmi Lotsawa. Sakya Pandita 1182–1251 CE was the great-grandson of Khon Konchog Gyalpo. This school emphasizes scholarship.
* Jonang(pa) Its origins in Tibet can be traced to early 12th century master Yumo Mikyo Dorje, but became much wider known with the help of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, a monk originally trained in the Sakya school. The Jonang school was widely thought to have become extinct in the late 17th century at the hands of the 5th Dalai Lama, who forcibly annexed the Jonang monasteries to his Gelug school, declaring them heretical. Thus, Tibetologists were astonished when fieldwork turned up several active Jonangpa monasteries, including the main monastery, Tsangwa, located in Zamtang County, Sichuan. Almost 40 monasteries, comprising about 5000 monks, have subsequently been found, including some in the Amdo Tibetan and rGyalgrong areas of Qinghai, Sichuan and Tibet. One of the primary supporters of the Jonang lineage in exile has been the 14th Dalai Lama of the Gelugpa lineage. The Jonang tradition has recently officially registered with the Tibetan Government in exile to be recognized as the fifth living Buddhist tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. The 14th Dalai Lama assigned Jebtsundamba Khutuktu of Mongolia (who is considered to be an incarnation of Taranatha) as the leader of the Jonang tradition.

The Chinese government continued to pursue a strategy of forced assimilation and suppression of Tibetan Buddhism, as demonstrated by the laws designed to control the next reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and those of other Tibetan eminent lamas. Monks and nuns who refused to denounce the Dalai Lama have been expelled from their monasteries, imprisoned, and tortured.

It was reported in June 2021 that amidst the 2020–2022 China–India skirmishes, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army had been forming a new unit for Tibetans who would be taken to Buddhist monks for religious blessings after completing their training.

==== Christianity ====

The first Christians documented to have reached Tibet were the Nestorians, of whom various remains and inscriptions have been found in Tibet. They were also present at the imperial camp of Möngke Khan at Shira Ordo, where they debated in 1256 with Karma Pakshi (1204/6-83), head of the Karma Kagyu order. Desideri, who reached Lhasa in 1716, encountered Armenian and Russian merchants.

Roman Catholic Jesuits and Capuchins arrived from Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. Portuguese missionaries Jesuit Father António de Andrade and Brother Manuel Marques first reached the kingdom of Gelu in western Tibet in 1624 and was welcomed by the royal family who allowed them to build a church later on. By 1627, there were about a hundred local converts in the Guge kingdom. Later on, Christianity was introduced to Rudok, Ladakh and Tsang and was welcomed by the ruler of the Tsang kingdom, where Andrade and his fellows established a Jesuit outpost at Shigatse in 1626.

In 1661 another Jesuit, Johann Grueber, crossed Tibet from Sining to Lhasa (where he spent a month), before heading on to Nepal. He was followed by others who actually built a church in Lhasa. These included the Jesuit Father Ippolito Desideri, 1716–1721, who gained a deep knowledge of Tibetan culture, language and Buddhism, and various Capuchins in 1707–1711, 1716–1733 and 1741–1745, Christianity was used by some Tibetan monarchs and their courts and the Karmapa sect lamas to counterbalance the influence of the Gelugpa sect in the 17th century until in 1745 when all the missionaries were expelled at the lama&#x27;s insistence.

In 1877, the Protestant James Cameron from the China Inland Mission walked from Chongqing to Batang in Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan province, and &quot;brought the Gospel to the Tibetan people.&quot; Beginning in the 20th century, in Dêqên Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan, a large number of Lisu people and some Yi and Nu people converted to Christianity. Famous earlier missionaries include James O. Fraser, Alfred James Broomhall and Isobel Kuhn of the China Inland Mission, among others who were active in this area.

Proselytising has been illegal in China since 1949. But , many Christian missionaries were reported to be active in Tibet with the tacit approval of Chinese authorities, who view the missionaries as a counterforce to Tibetan Buddhism or as a boon to the local economy.

==== Islam ====
Muslims have been living in Tibet since as early as the 8th or 9th century. In Tibetan cities, there are small communities of Muslims, known as Kachee (Kache), who trace their origin to immigrants from three main regions: Kashmir (Kachee Yul in ancient Tibetan), Ladakh and the Central Asian Turkic countries. Islamic influence in Tibet also came from Persia. A Muslim Sufi Syed Ali Hamdani preached to the people of Baltistan, then known as little Tibet. After 1959, a group of Tibetan Muslims made a case for Indian nationality based on their historic roots to Kashmir and the Indian government declared all Tibetan Muslims Indian citizens later on that year. Other Muslim ethnic groups who have long inhabited Tibet include Hui, Salar, Dongxiang and Bonan. There is also a well established Chinese Muslim community (gya kachee), which traces its ancestry back to the Hui ethnic group of China.

=== Tibetan art ===

Tibetan representations of art are intrinsically bound with Tibetan Buddhism and commonly depict deities or variations of Buddha in various forms from bronze Buddhist statues and shrines, to highly colorful thangka paintings and mandalas. Thangkas are Tibet&#x27;s traditional cloth paintings. Rendered on cotton cloth with a thin rod at the top, they portray Buddhist deities or themes in color and detail.

=== Architecture ===

Tibetan architecture contains Chinese and Indian influences, and reflects a deeply Buddhist approach. The Buddhist wheel, along with two dragons, can be seen on nearly every Gompa in Tibet. The design of the Tibetan Chörtens can vary, from roundish walls in Kham to squarish, four-sided walls in Ladakh.

The most distinctive feature of Tibetan architecture is that many of the houses and monasteries are built on elevated, sunny sites facing the south, and are often made out of a mixture of rocks, wood, cement and earth. Little fuel is available for heat or lighting, so flat roofs are built to conserve heat, and multiple windows are constructed to let in sunlight. Walls are usually sloped inwards at 10 degrees as a precaution against the frequent earthquakes in this mountainous area.

Standing at in height and in width, the Potala Palace is the most important example of Tibetan architecture. Formerly the residence of the Dalai Lama, it contains over one thousand rooms within thirteen stories, and houses portraits of the past Dalai Lamas and statues of the Buddha. It is divided between the outer White Palace, which serves as the administrative quarters, and the inner Red Quarters, which houses the assembly hall of the Lamas, chapels, 10,000 shrines, and a vast library of Buddhist scriptures. The Potala Palace is a World Heritage Site, as is Norbulingka, the former summer residence of the Dalai Lama.

=== Music ===

The music of Tibet reflects the cultural heritage of the trans-Himalayan region, centered in Tibet but also known wherever ethnic Tibetan groups are found in India, Bhutan, Nepal and further abroad. First and foremost Tibetan music is religious music, reflecting the profound influence of Tibetan Buddhism on the culture.

Tibetan music often involves chanting in Tibetan or Sanskrit, as an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals. Yang chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables. Other styles include those unique to the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism, such as the classical music of the popular Gelugpa school, and the romantic music of the Nyingmapa, Sakyapa and Kagyupa schools.

Nangma dance music is especially popular in the karaoke bars of the urban center of Tibet, Lhasa. Another form of popular music is the classical gar style, which is performed at rituals and ceremonies. Lu are a type of songs that feature glottal vibrations and high pitches. There are also epic bards who sing of Gesar, who is a hero to ethnic Tibetans.

=== Festivals ===
Tibet has various festivals, many for worshipping the Buddha, that take place throughout the year. Losar is the Tibetan New Year Festival. Preparations for the festive event are manifested by special offerings to family shrine deities, painted doors with religious symbols, and other painstaking jobs done to prepare for the event. Tibetans eat &quot;Guthuk&quot; (barley noodle soup with filling) on New Year&#x27;s Eve with their families. The Monlam Prayer Festival follows it in the first month of the Tibetan calendar, falling between the fourth and the eleventh days of the first Tibetan month. It involves dancing and participating in sports events, as well as sharing picnics. The event was established in 1049 by Tsong Khapa, the founder of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama&#x27;s order.

=== Cuisine ===

The most important crop in Tibet is barley, and dough made from barley flour—called tsampa—is the staple food of Tibet. This is either rolled into noodles or made into steamed dumplings called momos. Meat dishes are likely to be yak, goat, or mutton, often dried, or cooked into a spicy stew with potatoes. Mustard seed is cultivated in Tibet, and therefore features heavily in its cuisine. Yak yogurt, butter and cheese are frequently eaten, and well-prepared yogurt is considered something of a prestige item. Butter tea is a very popular drink.

<text>The Flash (or simply Flash) is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert, the original Flash first appeared in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #1 (cover-dated January 1940, released November 1939). Nicknamed &quot;the Scarlet Speedster&quot;, all incarnations of the Flash possess &quot;superspeed&quot;, which includes the ability to run, move, and think extremely fast, use superhuman reflexes, and seemingly violate certain laws of physics.

Thus far, at least five different characters –each of whom somehow gained the power of &quot;the Speed Force&quot;– have assumed the mantle of the Flash in DC&#x27;s history: college athlete Jay Garrick (1940–1951, 1961–2011, 2017–present), forensic scientist Barry Allen (1956–1985, 2008–present), Barry&#x27;s nephew Wally West (1986–2011, 2016–present), Barry&#x27;s grandson Bart Allen (2006–2007), and Chinese-American Avery Ho (2017–present). Each incarnation of the Flash has been a key member of at least one of DC&#x27;s premier teams: the Justice Society of America, the Justice League, and the Teen Titans.

The Flash is one of DC Comics&#x27; most popular characters and has been integral to the publisher&#x27;s many reality-changing &quot;crisis&quot; storylines over the years. The original meeting of the Golden Age Flash Jay Garrick and Silver Age Flash Barry Allen in &quot;Flash of Two Worlds&quot; (1961) introduced the Multiverse storytelling concept to DC readers, which would become the basis for many DC stories in the future.

Like his Justice League colleagues Wonder Woman, Superman and Batman, the Flash has a distinctive cast of adversaries, including Gorilla Grodd, the various Rogues (unique among DC supervillains for their code of honor), and the various psychotic &quot;speedsters&quot; who go by the names Reverse-Flash or Zoom. Other supporting characters in &quot;Flash&quot; stories include Barry&#x27;s wife, Iris West; Wally&#x27;s wife, Linda Park; Bart&#x27;s girlfriend, Valerie Perez; friendly fellow speedster, Max Mercury; and Central City police department members, David Singh and Patty Spivot.

A staple of the comic book DC Universe, the Flash has been adapted to numerous DC films, video games, animated series, and live-action television shows. In live-action, Barry Allen has been portrayed by Rod Haase in the 1979 television special &quot;Legends of the Superheroes&quot;, John Wesley Shipp in the 1990 &quot;The Flash&quot; series and Grant Gustin in the 2014 &quot;The Flash&quot; series, and Ezra Miller in the DC Extended Universe series of films, beginning with &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (2016). Shipp also portrays a version of Jay Garrick in the 2014 &quot;The Flash&quot; series. The various incarnations of the Flash are also features in animated series such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Justice League&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Young Justice&quot;, and the DC Universe Animated Original Movies series.

==Publication history==
=== Timeline ===
===Golden Age===
The Flash first appeared in the Golden Age &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #1 (January 1940), from All-American Publications, one of three companies that would eventually merge to form DC Comics. Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert, this Flash was Jay Garrick, a college student who gained his speed through the inhalation of hard water vapors. When re-introduced in the 1960s Garrick&#x27;s origin was modified slightly, gaining his powers through exposure to heavy water.

Jay Garrick was a popular character in the 1940s, supporting both &quot;Flash Comics&quot; and &quot;All-Flash Quarterly&quot; (later published bi-monthly as simply &quot;All-Flash&quot;); co-starring in &quot;Comic Cavalcade&quot;; and being a charter member of the Justice Society of America, the first superhero team, whose adventures ran in &quot;All Star Comics&quot;. With superheroes&#x27; post-war decline in popularity, &quot;Flash Comics&quot; was canceled with issue #104 (1949) which featured an evil version of the Flash called the Rival. The Justice Society&#x27;s final Golden Age story ran in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #57 (1951; the title itself continued as &quot;All Star Western&quot;).

===Silver Age===
In 1956, DC Comics successfully revived superheroes, ushering in what became known as the Silver Age of comic books. Rather than bringing back the same Golden Age heroes, DC rethought them as new characters for the modern age. The Flash was the first revival, in the tryout comic book &quot;Showcase&quot; #4 (October 1956).

This new Flash was Barry Allen, a police scientist who gained super-speed when bathed by chemicals after a shelf of them was struck by lightning. He adopted the name &quot;The Scarlet Speedster&quot; after reading a comic book featuring the Golden Age Flash. After several more appearances in &quot;Showcase&quot;, Allen&#x27;s character was given his own title, &quot;The Flash&quot;, the first issue of which was #105 (resuming where &quot;Flash Comics&quot; had left off). Barry Allen and the new Flash were created by writers Robert Kanigher and John Broome and cartoonist Carmine Infantino.

The Silver Age Flash proved popular enough that several other Golden Age heroes were revived in new incarnations (see: Green Lantern). A new superhero team, the Justice League of America, was also created, with the Flash as a main, charter member.

Barry Allen&#x27;s title also introduced a much-imitated plot device into superhero comics when it was revealed that Garrick and Allen existed on fictional parallel worlds. Their powers allowed them to cross the dimensional boundary between worlds, and the men became good friends. &quot;Flash of Two Worlds&quot; (&quot;The Flash&quot; #123) was the first crossover in which a Golden Age character met a Silver Age character. Soon, there were crossovers between the entire Justice League and the Justice Society; their respective teams began an annual get-together which endured from the early 1960s until the mid-1980s.

Allen&#x27;s adventures continued in his own title until the event of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. &quot;The Flash&quot; ended as a series with issue #350. Allen&#x27;s life had become considerably confused in the early 1980s, and DC elected to end his adventures and pass the mantle on to another character. Allen died heroically in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #8 (1985). Thanks to his ability to travel through time, he would continue to appear occasionally in the years to come.

===Modern Age===
The third Flash was Wally West, introduced in &quot;The Flash&quot; #110 (December 1959) as Kid Flash. West, Allen&#x27;s nephew by marriage, gained the Flash&#x27;s powers through an accident identical to Allen&#x27;s. Adopting the identity of Kid Flash, he maintained membership in the Teen Titans for years. Following Allen&#x27;s death, West adopted the Flash identity in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #12 and was given his own series, beginning with &quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 2) #1 in 1987. Many issues began with the catchphrase: &quot;My name is Wally West. I&#x27;m the fastest man alive.&quot;

Due to the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; miniseries and the &quot;One Year Later&quot; jump in time in the DC Universe, DC canceled &quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 2) in January 2006 at #230. A new series, &quot;The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive&quot;, began on June 21, 2006. The initial story arc of this series, written by Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo with art by Ken Lashley, focused on Bart Allen&#x27;s acceptance of the role of the Flash.

&quot;Flash: Fastest Man Alive&quot; was canceled with issue #13. In its place &quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 2) was revived with issue #231, with Mark Waid as the initial writer. Waid also wrote &quot;All-Flash&quot; #1, which acted as the bridge between the two series. DC had solicited &quot;The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive&quot; through issue #15. &quot;All Flash&quot; #1 replaced issue #14 and &quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 2) #231 replaced issue #15 in title and interior creative team only. The covers and cover artists were as solicited by DC, and the information text released was devoid of any plot information.

In 2009, Barry Allen made a full-fledged return to the DCU-proper in &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot;, a six-issue miniseries by Geoff Johns and Ethan Van Sciver.

==Fictional character biographies==
While several other individuals have used the name Flash, these have either on parallel worlds or in the future. Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, and Wally West are the best-known exemplars of the identity.
The signature wingdings are never absent.

===Jay Garrick===
Jay Garrick was a college student in 1938 who accidentally inhaled heavy water vapors after taking a smoke break inside his laboratory where he had been working. As a result, he found that he could run at superhuman speed and had similarly fast reflexes. After a brief career as a college football star, he donned a red shirt with a lightning bolt and a stylized metal helmet with wings (based on images of the Greek deity Hermes), and began to fight crime as the Flash. His first case involved battling the &quot;Faultless Four&quot;, a group of blackmailers. Garrick kept his identity secret for years without a mask by continually vibrating his body while in public so that any photograph of his face would be blurred. Although originally from Earth-Two, he was incorporated into the history of New Earth following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and is still active as the Flash operating out of Keystone City. He is a member of the Justice Society.

===Barry Allen===
Barry Allen is an assistant scientist from the Criminal and Forensic Science Division of Central City Police Department. Barry had a reputation for being very slow, deliberate, and frequently late, which frustrated his fiancée, Iris West. One night, as he was preparing to leave work, a freak lightning bolt struck a nearby shelf in his lab and doused him with a cocktail of unnamed chemicals. As a result, Barry found that he could run extremely fast and had matching reflexes. He donned a set of red tights sporting a lightning bolt (reminiscent of the original Fawcett Comics Captain Marvel), dubbed himself the Flash (after his childhood hero, Jay Garrick), and became a crimefighter active in Central City. In his civilian identity, he stores the costume compressed in a special ring via the use of a special gas that could compress cloth fibers to a very small fraction of their normal size.

Barry sacrificed his life for the universe in the 1985 maxi-series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and remained dead for over twenty years after that story&#x27;s publication. With the 2008 series &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Barry returned to the DC Universe and returned to full prominence as the Flash in the 2009 series &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot;, which was soon after followed by a new volume of &quot;The Flash&quot; ongoing series, where Barry&#x27;s adventures as the Scarlet Speedster were published until 2020. Wally returned as the primary Flash after 2021, but Barry remains a supporting character to him and the larger DC Universe and still operates as the Flash as of 2024.

===Wally West===
Wallace Rudolph &quot;Wally&quot; West is the nephew of both Iris West and Barry Allen, by marriage, and was introduced in &quot;The Flash&quot; #110 (1959). When West was about ten years old, he was visiting his uncle&#x27;s police laboratory, and the freak accident that gave Allen his powers repeated itself, bathing West in electrically charged chemicals. Now possessing the same powers as his uncle, West donned a copy of his uncle&#x27;s outfit and became the young, crime fighter, Kid Flash. After the events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; where Barry Allen was killed, Wally took over as the fastest man alive. Following the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Wally, his wife Linda, and their twins left Earth for an unknown dimension.

Wally, his wife, and their twins were pulled back from the Speed Force by the Legion of Super-Heroes at the conclusion of &quot;The Lightning Saga&quot;. This set the stage for Wally West&#x27;s return as the Flash after the events of &quot;The Flash: Fastest Man Alive&quot; #13 (see Bart Allen), in &quot;All Flash&quot; #1, and with &quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 2) series, which resumed with issue #231 in August 2007. It subsequently ends with issue #247, and West, along with all the other &quot;Flash&quot; characters, play a large role in 2009&#x27;s &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot;. After the New 52 reboot, Wally was removed from DC continuity but returned during DC Rebirth using a new red and silver costume, to a world that had forgotten his existence due to a combination of Barry and Dr. Manhattan meddling with reality during Flashpoint and the villain Abra Kadabra wiping the memory of Wally&#x27;s existence. After Manhattan undid the meddling he&#x27;d caused to reality, Wally was restored to the timeline and his family eventually returned as well. Barry returned the mantle of the primary Flash to Wally after Barry elected to join the multiverse-travelling team Justice Incarnate. Wally&#x27;s return as the main character of &quot;The Flash&quot; series began in &quot;The Flash&quot; #771 (2021) and is still the main Flash as of 2024.

===Bart Allen===
Bartholomew Henry &quot;Bart&quot; Allen II is the grandson of Barry Allen and his wife Iris. Bart suffered from accelerated aging and, as a result, was raised in a virtual reality machine until Iris took him back in time to get help from the then-current Flash, Wally West. With Wally&#x27;s help, Bart&#x27;s aging slowed, and he took the name Impulse. After he was shot in the knee by Deathstroke, Bart changed both his attitude and his costume, taking the mantle of Kid Flash. During the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, the Speed Force vanished, taking with it all the speedsters save Jay Garrick. Bart returned, four years older, and for a year claimed that he was depowered from the event. However, the Speed Force had not disappeared completely, but had been absorbed into Bart&#x27;s body; essentially, he now contained all of the Speed Force.

Bart&#x27;s costume as the Flash was a clone of his grandfather&#x27;s, similarly stylized to Wally West&#x27;s. Not long after taking the mantle of the Flash, Bart was killed by the Rogues in the thirteenth (and final) issue of &quot;The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive&quot;. However, he was later resurrected in the 31st century in &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot; #3 by Brainiac 5 to combat Superboy-Prime and the Legion of Super-Villains. Bart returned to the past and played a large role in &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot;.

===Avery Ho===

Avery Ho gained her powers as a teenager living in Central City in a &quot;Speed Force Storm&quot; that granted her a connection to the Speed Force. Avery was trained to use her powers by Barry, Meena Dewan/Negative Flash, and August Heart/Godspeed, though when it was discovered Heart was stealing the speed of Speed Force-connected Central City residents, Barry and Ace West/Kid Flash set out to remove the connected residents&#x27; connection to the Speed Force, but were attacked by Godspeed before they could remove Avery&#x27;s. Although they defeated Godspeed, Avery retained her connection to the Speed Force and her powers. She has gone on to become a member of The Justice League of China (a team she joined to retain her Flash moniker and her Chinese-American heritage), the multi-verse team the Justice Incarnate, and the Flash Family, becoming the love interest of Ace West, the duo serving as the main characters of the ongoing series &quot;Speed Force&quot;.

===Others===

====Jesse Chambers====
Daughter of the speedster Johnny Quick, Jesse Chambers becomes a speeding superhero like her father. She later meets Wally West, the Flash, who asks her to be his replacement if something were to happen to him (as part of an elaborate plan on his part, trying to force Bart Allen to take his role in the legacy of the Flash more seriously). She briefly assumes the mantle of the Flash, after Wally enters the Speed Force.

==== Jess Chambers ====
Jess Chambers was originally known as Kid Quick, the non-binary sidekick to Earth-11&#x27;s Jesse Quick, and a member of the team Teen Justice. In the Future State event, Chambers would permanently relocate to Earth-0, taking on the mantle of the Flash and joining the Justice League.

==== Judy Garrick ====

Judy Garrick was the daughter of the original Flash, Jay Garrick, first known as the Boom. As a teenager, she was abducted from the timestream by the Childminder, a Mother Goose-like being who took many Golden Age sidekicks to be sold. Judy and the rest of the Lost Children were freed by Stargirl and Red Arrow, re-entering the timestream in the present day and reuniting with her father. Years later, Judy would take on the mantle of the Flash and join the Justice Society of America.

====John Fox====
John Fox was a historian for the National Academy of Science in Central City in the 27th Century. He was sent back in time to get the help of one or more of the three Flashes (Garrick, Allen, West), in order to defeat the radioactive villain Mota back in Fox&#x27;s own time period. (Each Flash had individually fought Mota over the course of several years in the 20th century.) Fox&#x27;s mission was a failure, but during his return trip, the tachyon radiation that sent him through the time stream gave him superspeed. He defeated Mota as a new iteration of the Flash and operated as his century&#x27;s Flash for a time. Shortly after, he moved to the 853rd century and joined &quot;Justice Legion A&quot; (also known as Justice Legion Alpha) as seen in the DC One Million series of books.
The name &quot;John Fox&quot; is combined from the names of seminal comic book writers John Broome, who co-created the Barry Allen and Wally West Flashes, and Gardner Fox, who co-created the Jay Garrick Flash.

====Unnamed Allen of the 23rd century====
The father of Sela Allen, his wife and daughter were captured by Cobalt Blue. He is forced to watch his wife die and his daughter become crippled. As he and Max Mercury kill Cobalt Blue, a child takes Cobalt Blue&#x27;s power gem and kills Allen. This Flash is one of the two destined Flashes to be killed by Cobalt Blue.

====Sela Allen====

Sela Allen is an ordinary human in the 23rd century until Cobalt Blue steals electrical impulses away from her, causing her to become as slow to the world as the world is to the Flash. Hoping to restore her, her father takes her into the Speed Force. When her father is killed, she appears as a living manifestation of the Speed Force, able to lend speed to various people and objects, but unable to physically interact with the world.

====Blaine Allen====
Blaine Allen and his son live on the colony world of Petrus in the 28th century. In an attempt to end the Allen blood line, Cobalt Blue injects Allen&#x27;s son Jace with a virus. Lacking super speed, Jace was unable to shake off the virus. In despair, Blaine takes his son to the Speed Force in the hopes that it would accept him. It takes Blaine instead and grants superspeed to Jace so that he can shake off the sickness.

====Jace Allen====
Jace Allen gains superspeed when his father brings him into the Speed Force to attempt to cure him of a virus injected into his body by Cobalt Blue in an attempt to end the Allen bloodline. In memory of his father, Jace assumes the mantle of the Flash and continues the feud against Cobalt Blue.

====Kryiad====

After an alien creature invades Earth, a history buff named Kriyad travels back in time from the 98th century to acquire a Green Lantern power ring (&quot;The Flash&quot; #309, May 1982). He fails, so he tries to capture the Flash&#x27;s speed instead. After being beaten by Barry Allen, he travels back further in time and uses the chemicals from the clothes Barry Allen was wearing when he gained his powers to give himself super speed. Returning to his own time, Kryiad sacrifices his life to defeat the alien creature.

====Bizarro Flash====
Bizarro-Flash was created when Bizarro cloned Flash. He had a costume the reverse colors of Flash&#x27;s, however he had a mallet symbol because Flash was holding one when he was cloned. The modern version of Bizarro Flash has the symbol of a thunderbolt-shaped mustard stain. He has the powers of the Flash but he is completely intangible.

==Powers and abilities==
All incarnations of the Flash can move, think, and react at light speeds as well as having superhuman endurance that allows them to run incredible distances. Some, notably later versions, can vibrate so fast that they can pass through walls in a process called quantum tunneling, travel through time and can also lend and borrow speed. Speedsters can also heal more rapidly than an average human. In addition, most incarnations have an invisible aura around their respective bodies that protects them from air friction and the kinetic effects of their powers.

On several occasions, the Flash has raced against Superman, either to determine who is faster or as part of a mutual effort to thwart some type of threat; these races, however, often result in ties because of outside circumstances. Writer Jim Shooter and artist Curt Swan crafted the story &quot;Superman&#x27;s Race with the Flash!&quot; in &quot;Superman&quot; #199 (August 1967), which featured the first race between the Flash and Superman. Writer E. Nelson Bridwell and artist Ross Andru produced &quot;The Race to the End of the Universe&quot;, a follow-up story four months later in &quot;The Flash&quot; #175 (December 1967). However, after the DC Universe revision after &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, the Flash does successfully beat Superman in a race in &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #463, with the explanation that Superman is not accustomed to running at high speed for extended periods of time since flying is more versatile and less strenuous, which means the far more practiced Flash has the advantage. After Final Crisis in &quot;Flash: Rebirth&quot; #3, the Flash is shown as being significantly faster than Superman, able to outrun him as Superman struggles to keep up with him. He reveals that all the close races between them before had been &quot;for charity&quot;. In the &quot;Smallville&quot; episode &quot;Run,&quot; the Flash (Bart Allen) effortlessly matches pre-Superman Clark Kent&#x27;s top speed while running backward; and when running seriously, he instantly outruns Clark and disappears from his view beyond the horizon.

While various incarnations of the Flash have proven their ability to run at light speed, the ability to steal speed from other objects allows respective Flashes to even significantly surpass this velocity. In &quot;Flash: The Human Race&quot;, Wally is shown absorbing kinetic energy, to an extent enabling him to move faster than teleportation and run from the end of the universe back to earth in less than a Planck instant.

Speedsters may at times use the ability to speed-read at incredible rates and in doing so, process vast amounts of information. Whatever knowledge they acquire in this manner is usually temporary. Their ability to think fast also allows them some immunity to telepathy, as their thoughts operate at a rate too rapid for telepaths such as Martian Manhunter or Gorilla Grodd to read or influence their minds.

Flashes and other super-speedsters also have the ability to speak to one another at a highly accelerated rate. This is often done to have private conversations in front of non-fast people (as when Flash speaks to Superman about his ability to serve both the Titans and the JLA in &quot;The Titans&quot; #2). Speed-talking is also sometimes used for comedic effect where Flash becomes so excited that he begins talking faster and faster until his words become a jumble of noise. He also has the ability to change the vibration of his vocal cords making it so he can change how his voice sounds to others.

While not having the physical strength of many of his comrades and enemies, Flash has shown to be able to use his speed to exert incredible momentum into physical attacks. In , Flash uses these kinds of attacks as many of his special moves.

The Flash has also claimed that he can process thoughts in less than an attosecond. At times he is able to throw lightning created by his super speed and make speed vortices.

Some flashes also have the ability to create speed avatars (i.e. duplicates) and these avatars have sometimes been sent to different timelines to complete a particular mission. (Barry Allen exhibits this ability in the live action series &quot;The Flash&quot;).

He can also be seen negating the effects of the anti-life equation, when he freed Iris-West from its control (probably due to his connection with the Speed Force).

It is said that Wally West has reached the velocity of 23,759,449,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (about 24 tredecillion) × c (the speed of light), and he could only do this with the help of every human being on earth moving so the Speed Force was joined through everyone. With that speed, he was able to run not only from planet to planet but also to different galaxies and universes at what would be considered a blink of an eye.

==Different Flashes==
In the final issue of &quot;52&quot;, a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated &quot;Earth-2&quot;. As a result of Mister Mind &quot;eating&quot; aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-2, including the Flash among other Justice Society of America characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but the Flash is visually similar to the Jay Garrick Flash. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-2.

A variant of the Flash—a superfast college student named Mary Maxwell—was seen in the Elseworld book &quot;Just Imagine Stan Lee Creating The Flash&quot;.

===Tanaka Rei===
The Flash of Earth-D, Rei was a Japanese man who idolized Barry Allen, whose stories only existed in comic books on this world. Rei was inspired by Allen to become the Flash, much like Allen was inspired to become the Flash by his idol, Jay Garrick. Allen and Rei meet during the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; when Barry is coming back from the 30th century and arrives in the wrong universe. As Earth-D was under attack by the shadow demons, Barry called on the Justice League and Tanaka called on the Justice Alliance, his world&#x27;s version of the Justice League. They built a cosmic treadmill and were able to evacuate much of Earth-D&#x27;s population. The Justice League left, but 39 seconds later, Earth-D perished.

Rei made his only appearance in &quot;Legends of the DC Universe: Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; (February 1999). The story was written by Marv Wolfman, with art by Paul Ryan (pencils) and Bob McLeod (ink).

===Lia Nelson===

The young, female Flash of the Tangent Universe is not a speedster, but instead &quot;the first child born in space&quot; and a being made up of and able to control light. As a side effect, she can move at the speed of light, which actually makes her faster than most of the other Post-Crisis Flashes, with only Wally West having survived a light-speed run without becoming trapped in the Speed Force. She recently reappeared in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (vol. 2) #16, somehow summoned out of the paper &quot;green lantern&quot; of her universe—an artifact that survived the Crisis that erased the Tangent Universe from existence. Lia Nelson also appeared in &quot;Countdown: Arena&quot;, battling two versions of the Flash from other Earths within the Multiverse. In the 52-Earth Multiverse, the Tangent Universe is designated Earth-9.

===&quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations 2&quot;===

In &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations 2&quot;, three different Flashes appear: Wally West as Kid Flash in 1964, Wally&#x27;s cousin Carrie as Kid Flash in 1986, and Jay West, the son of Wally and his wife Magda as the fifth Flash in 2008. Barry Allen makes a cameo appearance out of costume in 1964.

===Green Lightning===
Ali Rayner-West, aka Green Lightning, is a descendant of both Kyle Rayner and Wally West. She has both a power ring and superspeed, as seen in &quot;Green Lantern: Circle of Fire&quot;. She was a living construct created by Kyle Rayner&#x27;s subconscious, who later re-fused into his mind.

===Ame-Comi===
A teenage version of Jesse Chambers appears as the Flash of the Ame-Comi universe. As with most of the other characters of that Earth, she sports an Anime-inspired costume.

===The Crash===
The 1980s series &quot;Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!&quot; presented the parallel Earth of &quot;Earth-C-Minus&quot;, a world populated by talking animal superheroes that paralleled the mainstream DC Universe. Earth-C-Minus was the home of the Crash, a turtle with super-speed powers similar to those of Barry Allen&#x27;s, and a member of his world&#x27;s superhero team, the Just&#x27;a Lotta Animals. The Crash as a youth had read comics about Earth-C&#x27;s Terrific Whatzit, similar to how Barry Allen enjoyed comics about Earth-Two&#x27;s Jay Garrick.

===Danica Williams===

An African-American teenager of Earth 12 named Danica Williams appears as the Flash in the &quot;Justice League Beyond&quot; series, acting as Wally West&#x27;s successor during the 2040s (following the events of &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;). She is employed at the Flash Museum in Central City, and like Barry Allen, is chronically late. She later enters into a relationship with Billy Batson, who is the secret identity of the superhero, Captain Marvel.

==Writers==
The following writers have been involved in the ongoing &quot;The Flash&quot; and &quot;Flash Comics&quot; series:
==Awards==

The comics and characters have been nominated for and won several awards over the years, including:
* &quot;1961 Alley Award for Best Cover&quot; (&quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 1) #123)
* &quot;1961 Alley Award for Best Single Comic&quot; (&quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 1) #123 by Gardner Fox and Carmine Infantino)
* &quot;1963 Alley Award for Cross-Over of DC Heroes&quot; for &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; (with Hawkman)
* &quot;1964 Alley Award for Best Short Story&quot; (&quot;Doorway to the Unknown&quot; in &quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 1) #148 by John Broome and Carmine Infantino)
* &quot;2001 Eisner Award for Best Cover Artist&quot; (&quot;The Flash&quot;, by Brian Bolland)
* &quot;2008 Salou Award for Best Super Hero&quot; (&quot;Flash – Danny Holmes&quot; by BUAFC)

==In other media==
Throughout his 70-year history, the Flash has appeared in numerous media. The Flash has been included in multiple animated features, such as &quot;Super Friends&quot; and &quot;Justice League&quot;, as well as his own live action television series and some guest star appearances on &quot;Smallville&quot; (as the Bart Allen/Impulse version). There are numerous videos that feature the character.

*In the &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot; series which ran from 1978 to 1979, he appears in every episode and has spoken lines in only twelve out of the sixteen episodes of the series. He also had two arch enemies from the Legion of Doom, Captain Cold and Gorilla Grodd.
*&quot;The Flash&quot; appeared for one season (1990–1991) on the CBS Network, starring double-Emmy Award winner John Wesley Shipp as Barry Allen. Produced by Danny Bilson and Paul DeMeo, the series was a mild amalgamation of the Barry Allen and Wally West versions of the comics in that the female lead was Tina McGee (portrayed by Amanda Pays) and Wally&#x27;s need for large amounts of food after expending so much energy running all over Central City was transferred to Barry. After his lightning-induced chemical accident, Barry got into crime fighting after the death of his police officer brother, Jay; it is presumed that Jay was named for the original comic book Flash, Jay Garrick. A handful of the Scarlet Speedster&#x27;s rogues gallery made guest appearances throughout the series: Captain Cold (Michael Champion) (&quot;Captain Cold&quot;), Mirror Master (David Cassidy) (&quot;Done With Mirrors&quot;), and the Trickster (Mark Hamill) (&quot;The Trickster&quot; and &quot;Trial of the Trickster&quot;). The Flash also fought a clone of himself who wore a blue costume.

:A few episodes were written by comics legend Howard Chaykin and the TV costume was designed by Dave Stevens (&quot;The Rocketeer&quot;). While a critical success and vigorously backed by the network, the series had the dubious distinction of being aired against ratings powerhouses &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; on NBC and Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. &quot;The Flash&quot; was preempted by Christmas specials and the Desert Storm war in Iraq, and was canceled after its first season. Warner Brothers released the series in a 6-disc DVD box set on January 10, 2006.

:The series&#x27; main musical theme was composed by Danny Elfman, with the remainder of the episodes&#x27; music being composed by Shirley Walker (this collaboration would also occur on &quot;&quot;). When the Flash made a guest appearance in the &quot;&quot; episode &#x27;Speed Demons&#x27;, Walker incorporated some of the themes from the live-action series into the episode.

*Wally West is the Flash who appears in the DCAU, voiced by Michael Rosenbaum. He has Wally&#x27;s personality like telling bad jokes and being attracted to most women. He does have some Barry Allen traits as well like being in Central City and working as a forensic scientist. He is the only Flash to appear in the DCAU; however, Jay Garrick&#x27;s helmet is seen on display in the Flash museum in the Justice League Unlimited episode &quot;Flash and Substance&quot;.
*Kid Flash (Wally West) appears in the Teen Titans episode Lightspeed and protects Jump City while the Titans are away. He refers to a previous partnership with The Flash (presumably Barry Allen). He soon reforms Jinx and enters a romantic relationship with her.
*The Flash is a playable character in the Mortal Kombat and DC Comics crossover game &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;. The first official render for The Flash was released to the public on Monday July 7, 2008. His bio reveals that this version is Barry Allen. He is also a playable character in &quot;&quot; and its sequel, developed by NetherRealm Studios.
*Two versions of the Flash make appearances in &quot;DC Universe Online&quot;. Barry Allen fights alongside the heroes against Gorilla Grodd&#x27;s army, and is a bounty for the villains. Jay Garrick appears in the Watchtower, selling powerful armor to Level 30 Heroes with the Metapower origin.
*Impulse is shown in &quot;Young Justice: Invasion&quot; as the grandson of Barry Allen and Iris West. He comes from the future to save his grandfather from Neutron (A.K.A. Nathaniel Tryon). Once he travels back he does succeed in saving Barry Allen, and stopping Neutron, this was supposed to save the future, but it is shown that the future remains the same. When he tries to travel back to his time (2056), his time machine doesn&#x27;t work, it is shown in a backstory that he knew he was going to be stuck in the past, because the wires would be fried, though he doesn&#x27;t reveal this to anyone on The Team, at that moment, he is considered an official member.
*Grant Gustin portrays Barry Allen as the Flash in the CW&#x27;s Arrowverse. In the &quot;Arrow&quot; episode titled &quot;The Scientist&quot;, Central City CSI Investigator Barry Allen partners with Felicity Smoak to find the thief that broke into one of the Queen Consolidated Applied Sciences building. Barry claims that he was sent from Central City to Starling City to investigate since there were connections to a case in Central City. Oliver Queen soon finds out that Barry was actually an assistant who came to Starling to investigate this strange occurrence in the hope that he would find an answer to who murdered his mother when he was a child. His appearance set up the character for his own series in 2014. This Flash also makes guest appearances in other Arrowverse series. Other known Flashes have appeared with Jay Garrick portrayed by John Wesley Shipp and Avery Ho portrayed by Piper Curda.
*The Flash made his first theatrical film appearance in &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;. He was part of Metalbeard&#x27;s pirate crew. He later made a brief appearance in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;.
*Ezra Miller portrays Barry Allen as the Flash in the DC Extended Universe. He had cameos in the 2016 films &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; and &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, and a larger role in &quot;Justice League&quot; (2017) and &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot; (2021). A film centered on the character was released on June 16, 2023, drawing elements from the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; storyline.
*The Barry Allen version of the Flash appears in &quot;Justice League Action&quot;.
*In the fine arts, and starting with the Pop Art period and on a continuing basis since the 1960s, the character of the Flash has been &quot;appropriated&quot; by multiple visual artists and incorporated into contemporary artwork, most notably by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Mel Ramos, Dulce Pinzon, and others.

==In popular culture==
Ever since the Flash has been published as a comic, many TV shows and films have been making references to the popular character. As you&#x27;ll see below, there are some notable references to the Flash that appear in &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

Numerous references to the Flash are presented on the television show &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. A particular reference is main character Sheldon Cooper&#x27;s Flash t-shirt, which has become a staple of merchandise clothing. In the season 1 episode The Middle-Earth Paradigm, the four main male characters on the show all independently dress up for a Halloween party as the Flash before deciding that they can&#x27;t all be the Flash so no one gets to. In the season 10 episode The Birthday Synchronicity, Sheldon bought a Flash onesie for Howard &amp; Bernadette&#x27;s newborn.

In season 3 of &quot;Lost&quot;, in the episode &quot;Catch-22&quot;, Charlie and Hurley debate over who would win a footrace between the Flash and Superman.

The false name Barry Allen is used by character of con artist Frank Abagnale, Jr.(posing as a Secret Service Agent), in the movie &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;. When a coffee shop waiter notices the notes of FBI agent Carl Hanratty, he reveals that Barry Allen is the Flash, giving Carl a vital clue to his unknown subject&#x27;s identity.

In 2006, a near-pristine copy of &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #1 was sold in a Heritage Auction for $273,125. The same book was then sold privately for $450,000 in 2010.

Renan Kanbay wears a Flash costume while playing Carrie, the manager of a comic book store, in Joe Lipari&#x27;s &quot;Dream Job&quot; (2011).

The band Jim&#x27;s Big Ego wrote the song &quot;The Ballad of Barry Allen&quot; detailing the hardship having to watch time moving so slowly from the perspective of Allen. The frontman of the band, Jim Infantino is the nephew of Flash artist Carmine Infantino.

In the film &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot;, one of the day care kids named Tony wore a Flash costume for the majority of the film.

In the &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot; episode &quot;Power Ponies&quot;, Pinkie Pie becomes a superhero based on the Flash called Fili-Second.

In an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Comic Book Guy dresses as The Flash while running in a marathon. He says &quot;No one can outrun the Flash&quot; but ends up falling in a pothole and gets stuck.

==Rogues==
Like Batman, Superman, and Green Lantern, the Flash has a reputation for having fought a distinctive and memorable rogues gallery of supervillains. In the Flash&#x27;s case, some of these villains have adopted the term &quot;Flash&#x27;s Rogues Gallery&quot; as an official title, and insist on being called &quot;Rogues&quot; rather than &quot;supervillains&quot; or similar names. At times, various combinations of the Rogues have banded together to commit crimes or take revenge on the Flash, usually under the leadership of Captain Cold.

The Rogues are known for their communal style relationship, socializing together and operating under a strict moral code, sometimes brutally enforced by Captain Cold. Such &quot;rules&quot; include &quot;no drugs&quot; and, except in very dire situations or on unique occasions, &quot;no killing&quot;.

<doc id="31520" wikidata="Q1252478" url="?curid=31520" title="Hellfire Club">
<text>Hellfire Club was a term used to describe several exclusive clubs for high-society rakes established in Great Britain and Ireland in the 18th Century. The name most commonly refers to Francis Dashwood&#x27;s Order of the Friars of St. Francis of Wycombe. Such clubs, rumour had it, served as the meeting places of &quot;persons of quality&quot; who wished to take part in what were socially perceived as immoral acts, and the members were often involved in politics. Neither the activities nor membership of the clubs are easy to ascertain. The clubs allegedly had distant ties to an elite society known only as &quot;The Order of the Second Circle&quot;.

The first official Hellfire Club was founded in London in 1718, by Philip Wharton, 1st Duke of Wharton and a handful of other high-society friends. The most notorious club associated with the name was established in England by Francis Dashwood, and met irregularly from around 1749 to around 1760, and possibly up until 1766. The term was closely associated with Brooks&#x27;s, established in 1764. Other groups described as Hellfire Clubs were set up throughout the 18th century. Most of these arose in Ireland after Wharton&#x27;s had been dissolved.

==Duke of Wharton&#x27;s club==
Lord Wharton was made a duke by George I and was a prominent politician with two separate lives: the first as a &quot;man of letters&quot; and the second as &quot;a drunkard, a rioter, an infidel and a rake&quot;. The members of Wharton&#x27;s club are largely unknown. Mark Blackett-Ord assumes that members included Wharton&#x27;s immediate friends: the Earl of Hillsborough, cousin; the Earl of Lichfield; and Sir Ed. O&#x27;Brien. Aside from these names, other members are not revealed.

At the time of the London gentlemen&#x27;s club, when there was a meeting place for every interest, including poetry, philosophy and politics, Wharton&#x27;s Hellfire Club was, according to Blackett-Ord, a satirical &quot;gentleman&#x27;s club&quot; which was known to ridicule religion, catching onto the contemporary trend in England of blasphemy. The club was more a joke, meant to shock the outside world, than a serious attack on religion or morality. The supposed president of this club was the Devil, although the members themselves did not apparently worship demons or the Devil, but called themselves devils. Wharton&#x27;s club admitted men and women as equals, unlike other clubs of the time. The club met on Sundays at a number of different locations around London. The Greyhound Tavern was one of the meeting places used regularly, but because women were not to be seen in taverns, the meetings were also held at members&#x27; houses and at Wharton&#x27;s riding club.

According to at least one source, their activities included mock religious ceremonies and partaking of meals featuring such dishes as &quot;Holy Ghost Pie&quot;, &quot;Breast of Venus&quot;, and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Loin&quot;, while drinking &quot;Hell Fire Punch&quot;. Members of the club supposedly came to meetings dressed as characters from the Bible.

Wharton&#x27;s club came to an end in 1721 when George I, under the influence of Wharton&#x27;s political enemies (in particular, Robert Walpole) put forward a Bill &quot;against &#x27;horrid impieties&#x27;&quot; (or immorality), aimed at the Hellfire Club. Wharton&#x27;s political opposition used his membership as a way to pit him against his political allies, thus removing him from Parliament. After his Club was disbanded, Wharton became a Freemason, and in 1722 he became the Grand Master of England.

==Sir Francis Dashwood&#x27;s clubs==
Sir Francis Dashwood and the Earl of Sandwich are alleged to have been members of a Hellfire Club that met at the George and Vulture Inn throughout the 1730s. Dashwood founded the Order of the Knights of St Francis in 1746, originally meeting at the George &amp; Vulture.

The club motto was &quot;Fais ce que tu voudras&quot; (Do what thou wilt), a philosophy of life associated with François Rabelais&#x27;s fictional abbey at &quot;Thélème&quot; and later used by Aleister Crowley.

Francis Dashwood was well known for his pranks: for example, while in the Royal Court in St Petersburg, he dressed up as the King of Sweden, a great enemy of Russia. The membership of Sir Francis&#x27;s club was initially limited to twelve but soon increased. Of the original twelve, some are regularly identified: Dashwood, Robert Vansittart, Thomas Potter, Francis Duffield, Edward Thompson, Paul Whitehead and John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. The list of supposed members is immense; among the more probable candidates are Benjamin Bates II, George Bubb Dodington, a fabulously corpulent man in his 60s; William Hogarth, although hardly a gentleman, has been associated with the club after painting Dashwood as a Franciscan Friar and John Wilkes, though much later, under the pseudonym John of Aylesbury. As there are no records left (these having been burned in 1774), many of these members are just assumed or linked by letters sent to each other.

===Meetings and club activities===
Sir Francis&#x27;s club was never originally known as a Hellfire Club; it was given this name much later. His club in fact used a number of other names, such as the &quot;Brotherhood of St. Francis of Wy&quot;, &quot;Order of Knights of West Wycombe&quot;, &quot;The Order of the Friars of St Francis of Wycombe&quot;, and later, after moving their meetings to Medmenham Abbey, they became the &quot;Monks&quot; or &quot;Friars of Medmenham&quot;. The first meeting at Sir Francis&#x27;s family home in West Wycombe was held on &quot;Walpurgis Night&quot;, 1752; a much larger meeting, it was something of a failure and no large-scale meetings were held there again. In 1751, Dashwood, leased Medmenham Abbey on the Thames from a friend, Francis Duffield.

On moving into Medmenham Abbey, Dashwood had numerous expensive works done on the building. It was rebuilt by the architect Nicholas Revett in the style of the 18th-century Gothic revival. At this time, the motto &quot;Fais ce que tu voudras&quot; was placed above a doorway in stained glass. It is thought that William Hogarth may have executed murals for this building; none, however, survive. Eventually, the meetings were moved out of the abbey into a series of tunnels and caves in West Wycombe Hill.
They were decorated again with mythological themes, phallic symbols and other items of a sexual nature.

Records indicate that the members performed &quot;obscene parodies of religious rites&quot; according to one source. According to Horace Walpole, the members&#x27; &quot;practice was rigorously pagan: Bacchus and Venus were the deities to whom they almost publicly sacrificed; and the nymphs and the hogsheads that were laid in against the festivals of this new church, sufficiently informed the neighbourhood of the complexion of those hermits.&quot; Dashwood&#x27;s garden at West Wycombe contained numerous statues and shrines to different gods; Daphne and Flora, Priapus and the previously mentioned Venus and Dionysus.

A Parish history from 1925 stated that members included &quot;Frederick, Prince of Wales, the Duke of Queensberry, the Earl of Bute, Lord Melcombe, Sir William Stanhope, K.B, Sir John Dashwood-King, bart., Sir Francis Delaval, K.B., Sir John Vanluttan, kt., Henry Vansittart, afterwards Governor of Bengal, (fn. 13) and Paul Whitehead the poet&quot;. Meetings occurred twice a month, with an AGM lasting a week or more in June or September. The members addressed each other as &quot;Brothers&quot; and the leader, which changed regularly, as &quot;Abbot&quot;. During meetings members supposedly wore ritual clothing: white trousers, jacket and cap, while the &quot;Abbot&quot; wore a red ensemble of the same style. Legends of Black Masses and Satan or demon worship have subsequently become attached to the club, beginning in the late Nineteenth Century. Rumours saw female &quot;guests&quot; (a euphemism for prostitutes) referred to as &quot;Nuns&quot;. Dashwood&#x27;s Club meetings often included mock rituals, items of a pornographic nature, much drinking, wenching and banqueting.

===Decline of Dashwood&#x27;s Club===
The downfall of Dashwood&#x27;s Club was more drawn-out and complicated. In 1762, the Earl of Bute appointed Dashwood his Chancellor of the Exchequer, despite Dashwood being widely held to be incapable of understanding &quot;a bar bill of five figures&quot;. (Dashwood resigned the post the next year, having raised a tax on cider which caused near-riots). Dashwood now sat in the House of Lords after taking up the title of Baron Le Despencer after the previous holder died. Then there was the attempted arrest of John Wilkes for seditious libel against the King in the notorious issue No. 45 of his &quot;The North Briton&quot; in early 1763. During a search authorised by a General warrant (possibly set up by Sandwich, who wanted to get rid of Wilkes), a version of &quot;The Essay on Woman&quot; was discovered set up on the press of a printer whom Wilkes had almost certainly used. The work was almost certainly principally written by Thomas Potter, and from internal evidence can be dated to around 1755. It was scurrilous, blasphemous, libellous, and bawdy, though not pornographic – still unquestionably illegal under the laws of the time, and the Government subsequently used it to drive Wilkes into exile. Between 1760 and 1765 &quot;Chrysal, or the Adventures of a Guinea&quot; by the Irish author Charles Johnstone was published. It contained stories easily identified with Medmenham, one in which Lord Sandwich was ridiculed as having mistaken a monkey for the Devil. This book sparked the association between the Medmenham Monks and the Hellfire Club. By this time, many of the Friars were either dead or too far away for the club to continue as it did before. Medmenham was finished by 1766.

Paul Whitehead had been the Secretary and Steward of the Order at Medmenham. When he died in 1774, as his will specified, his heart was placed in an urn at West Wycombe. It was sometimes taken out to show to visitors, but was stolen in 1829.

The West Wycombe Caves in which the Friars met are now a tourist site known as the &quot;Hellfire Caves&quot;.

In Anstruther, Scotland, a likeminded sex and drinking club called The Beggar&#x27;s Benison was formed in the 1730s, which survived for a century and spawned additional branches in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Honorary membership was extended to the Prince of Wales in 1783. Thirty-nine years later, while the Prince (by now King George IV) was paying a royal visit to Scotland, he bequeathed the club a snuff box filled with his mistresses&#x27; pubic hair.

==Hellfire Clubs in contemporary life==

===Phoenix Society===
In 1781, Dashwood&#x27;s nephew Joseph Alderson (an undergraduate at Brasenose College, Oxford) founded the Phoenix Society (later known as the Phoenix Common Room), but it was only in 1786 that the small gathering of friends asserted themselves as a recognised institution. The Phoenix was established in honour of Sir Francis, who died in 1781, as a symbolic rising from the ashes of Dashwood&#x27;s earlier institution. To this day, the dining society abides by many of its predecessor&#x27;s tenets. Its motto &#x27;when one is torn away another succeeds&#x27; is from the sixth book of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; and refers to the practice of establishing the continuity of the society through a process of constant renewal of its graduate and undergraduate members, but also refers to the alchemical kabbalistic process that a life snatched via sacrifice is a life given back via a spirit at the command of its master. The Phoenix Common Room&#x27;s continuous history was reported in 1954 as a matter of note to the college.

<text>Thomas Hunt Morgan (September 25, 1866 – December 4, 1945) was an American evolutionary biologist, geneticist, embryologist, and science author who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1933 for discoveries elucidating the role that the chromosome plays in heredity.

Morgan received his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in zoology in 1890 and researched embryology during his tenure at Bryn Mawr. Following the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance in 1900, Morgan began to study the genetic characteristics of the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;. In his famous Fly Room at Columbia University&#x27;s Schermerhorn Hall, Morgan demonstrated that genes are carried on chromosomes and are the mechanical basis of heredity. These discoveries formed the basis of the modern science of genetics.

During his distinguished career, Morgan wrote 22 books and 370 scientific papers. As a result of his work, &quot;Drosophila&quot; became a major model organism in contemporary genetics. The Division of Biology which he established at the California Institute of Technology has produced seven Nobel Prize winners.

==Early life and education==
Morgan was born in Lexington, Kentucky, to Charlton Hunt Morgan and Ellen Key Howard Morgan. Part of a line of Southern plantation and slave owners on his father&#x27;s side, Morgan was a nephew of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan; his great-grandfather John Wesley Hunt had been one of the first millionaires west of the Allegheny Mountains. Through his mother, he was the great-grandson of Francis Scott Key, the author of the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot;, and John Eager Howard, governor and senator from Maryland. Following the Civil War, the family fell on hard times with the temporary loss of civil and some property rights for those who aided the Confederacy. His father had difficulty finding work in politics and spent much of his time coordinating veterans&#x27; reunions.

Beginning at age 16 in the Preparatory Department, Morgan attended the State College of Kentucky (now the University of Kentucky). He focused on science; he particularly enjoyed natural history, and worked with the U.S. Geological Survey in his summers. He graduated as valedictorian in 1886 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Following a summer at the Marine Biology School in Annisquam, Massachusetts, Morgan began graduate studies in zoology at the recently founded Johns Hopkins University. After two years of experimental work with morphologist William Keith Brooks and writing several publications, Morgan was eligible to receive a Master of Science from the State College of Kentucky in 1888. The college required two years of study at another institution and an examination by the college faculty. The college offered Morgan a full professorship; however, he chose to stay at Johns Hopkins and was awarded a relatively large fellowship to help him fund his studies.

Under Brooks, Morgan completed his thesis work on the embryology of sea spiders—collected during the summers of 1889 and 1890 at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts—to determine their phylogenetic relationship with other arthropods. He concluded that concerning embryology, they were more closely related to spiders than crustaceans. Based on the publication of this work, Morgan was awarded his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins in 1890 and was also awarded the Bruce Fellowship in Research. He used the fellowship to travel to Jamaica, the Bahamas and Europe to conduct further research.

Every summer from 1910 to 1925, Morgan and his colleagues at the famous Fly Room at Columbia University moved their research program to the Marine Biological Laboratory. Aside from being an independent investigator at the MBL from 1890 to 1942, he became very involved in the governance of the institution, including serving as an MBL trustee from 1897 to 1945.

==Career and research==
===Bryn Mawr===
In 1890, Morgan was appointed associate professor (and head of the biology department) at Johns Hopkins&#x27; sister school Bryn Mawr College, replacing his colleague Edmund Beecher Wilson. Morgan taught all morphology-related courses, while the other member of the department, Jacques Loeb, taught the physiological courses. Although Loeb stayed for only one year, it was the beginning of their lifelong friendship. Morgan lectured in biology five days a week, giving two lectures a day. He frequently included his recent research in his lectures. Although an enthusiastic teacher, he was most interested in research in the laboratory. During the first few years at Bryn Mawr, he produced descriptive studies of sea acorns, ascidian worms, and frogs.

In 1894 Morgan was granted a year&#x27;s absence to conduct research in the laboratories of &quot;Stazione Zoologica&quot; in Naples, where Wilson had worked two years earlier. There he worked with German biologist Hans Driesch, whose research in the experimental study of development piqued Morgan&#x27;s interest. Among other projects that year, Morgan completed an experimental study of ctenophore embryology. In Naples and through Loeb, he became familiar with the &quot;Entwicklungsmechanik&quot; (roughly, &quot;developmental mechanics&quot;) school of experimental biology. It was a reaction to the vitalistic &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot;, which was extremely influential in 19th-century morphology. Morgan changed his work from traditional, largely descriptive morphology to experimental embryology that sought physical and chemical explanations for organismal development.

At the time, there was considerable scientific debate over the question of how an embryo developed. Following Wilhelm Roux&#x27;s mosaic theory of development, some believed that hereditary material was divided among embryonic cells, which were predestined to form particular parts of a mature organism. Driesch and others thought that development was due to epigenetic factors, where interactions between the protoplasm and the nucleus of the egg and the environment could affect development. Morgan was in the latter camp; his work with Driesch demonstrated that blastomeres isolated from sea urchin and ctenophore eggs could develop into complete larvae, contrary to the predictions (and experimental evidence) of Roux&#x27;s supporters. A related debate involved the role of epigenetic and environmental factors in development; on this front Morgan showed that sea urchin eggs could be induced to divide without fertilization by adding magnesium chloride. Loeb continued this work and became well known for creating fatherless frogs using the method.
When Morgan returned to Bryn Mawr in 1895, he was promoted to full professor. Morgan&#x27;s main lines of experimental work involved regeneration and larval development; in each case, his goal was to distinguish internal and external causes to shed light on the Roux-Driesch debate. He wrote his first book, &quot;The Development of the Frog&#x27;s Egg&quot; (1897). He began a series of studies on different organisms&#x27; ability to regenerate. He looked at grafting and regeneration in tadpoles, fish, and earthworms; in 1901 he published his research as &quot;Regeneration&quot;.

Beginning in 1900, Morgan started working on the problem of sex determination, which he had previously dismissed when Nettie Stevens discovered the impact of the Y chromosome on sex. He also continued to study the evolutionary problems that had been the focus of his earliest work.

===Columbia University===
Morgan worked at Columbia University for 24 years, from 1904 until 1928 when he left for a position at the California Institute of Technology.

In 1904, his friend, Jofi Joseph died of tuberculosis, and he felt he ought to mourn her, though E. B. Wilson—still blazing the path for his younger friend—invited Morgan to join him at Columbia University. This move freed him to focus fully on experimental work.
When Morgan took the professorship in experimental zoology, he became increasingly focused on the mechanisms of heredity and evolution. He published &quot;Evolution and Adaptation&quot; (1903); like many biologists at the time, he saw evidence for biological evolution (as in the common descent of similar species) but rejected Darwin&#x27;s proposed mechanism of natural selection acting on small, constantly produced variations.

Extensive work in biometry seemed to indicate that continuous natural variation had distinct limits and did not represent heritable changes. Embryological development posed an additional problem in Morgan&#x27;s view, as selection could not act on the early, incomplete stages of highly complex organs such as the eye. The common solution of the Lamarckian mechanism of inheritance of acquired characters, which featured prominently in Darwin&#x27;s theory, was increasingly rejected by biologists. According to Morgan&#x27;s biographer Garland Allen, he was also hindered by his views on taxonomy: he thought that species were entirely artificial creations that distorted the continuously variable range of real forms, while he held a &quot;typological&quot; view of larger taxa and could see no way that one such group could transform into another. But while Morgan was skeptical of natural selection for many years, his theories of heredity and variation were radically transformed through his conversion to Mendelism.

In 1900 three scientists, Carl Correns, Erich von Tschermak and Hugo De Vries, had rediscovered the work of Gregor Mendel, and with it the foundation of genetics. De Vries proposed that new species were created by mutation, bypassing the need for either Lamarckism or Darwinism. As Morgan had dismissed both evolutionary theories, he was seeking to prove De Vries&#x27; mutation theory with his experimental heredity work. He was initially skeptical of Mendel&#x27;s laws of heredity (as well as the related chromosomal theory of sex determination), which were being considered as a possible basis for natural selection.
Following C. W. Woodworth and William E. Castle, around 1908 Morgan started working on the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, and encouraging students to do so as well. With Fernandus Payne, he mutated &quot;Drosophila&quot; through physical, chemical, and radiational means. He began cross-breeding experiments to find heritable mutations, but they had no significant success for two years. Castle had also had difficulty identifying mutations in &quot;Drosophila&quot;, which were tiny. Finally, in 1909, a series of heritable mutants appeared, some of which displayed Mendelian inheritance patterns; in 1910 Morgan noticed a white-eyed mutant male among the red-eyed wild types. When white-eyed flies were bred with a red-eyed female, their progeny were all red-eyed. A second-generation cross produced white-eyed males—a sex-linked recessive trait, the gene for which Morgan named &quot;white&quot;. Morgan also discovered a pink-eyed mutant that showed a different pattern of inheritance. In a paper published in &quot;Science&quot; in 1911, he concluded that (1) some traits were sex-linked, (2) the trait was probably carried on one of the sex chromosomes, and (3) other genes were probably carried on specific chromosomes as well.

Morgan and his students became more successful at finding mutant flies; they counted the mutant characteristics of thousands of fruit flies and studied their inheritance. As they accumulated multiple mutants, they combined them to study more complex inheritance patterns. The observation of a miniature-wing mutant, which was also on the sex chromosome but sometimes sorted independently to the white-eye mutation, led Morgan to the idea of genetic linkage and to hypothesize the phenomenon of crossing over. He relied on the discovery of Frans Alfons Janssens, a Belgian professor at the University of Leuven, who described the phenomenon in 1909 and had called it &quot;chiasmatypy&quot;. Morgan proposed that the amount of crossing over between linked genes differs and that crossover frequency might indicate the distance separating genes on the chromosome. The later English geneticist J. B. S. Haldane suggested that the unit of measurement for linkage be called the morgan. Morgan&#x27;s student Alfred Sturtevant developed the first genetic map in 1913.

In 1915 Morgan, Sturtevant, Calvin Bridges and H. J. Muller wrote the seminal book &quot;The Mechanism of Mendelian Heredity&quot;. Geneticist Curt Stern called the book &quot;the fundamental textbook of the new genetics&quot;.

In the following years, most biologists came to accept the Mendelian-chromosome theory, which was independently proposed by Walter Sutton and Theodor Boveri in 1902/1903, and elaborated and expanded by Morgan and his students. Garland Allen characterized the post-1915 period as one of normal science, in which &quot;The activities of &#x27;geneticists&#x27; were aimed at further elucidation of the details and implications of the Mendelian-chromosome theory developed between 1910 and 1915.&quot; But, the details of the increasingly complex theory, as well as the concept of the gene and its physical nature, were still controversial. Critics such as W. E. Castle pointed to contrary results in other organisms, suggesting that genes interact with each other, while Richard Goldschmidt and others thought there was no compelling reason to view genes as discrete units residing on chromosomes.

Because of Morgan&#x27;s dramatic success with &quot;Drosophila&quot;, many other labs throughout the world took up fruit fly genetics. Columbia became the center of an informal exchange network, through which promising mutant &quot;Drosophila&quot; strains were transferred from lab to lab; &quot;Drosophila&quot; became one of the first and for some time the most widely used, model organisms. Morgan&#x27;s group remained highly productive, but Morgan largely withdrew from doing fly work and gave his lab members considerable freedom in designing and carrying out their own experiments.

He returned to embryology and worked to encourage the spread of genetics research to other organisms and the spread of mechanistic experimental approach (&quot;Enwicklungsmechanik&quot;) to all biological fields. After 1915, he also became a strong critic of the growing eugenics movement, which adopted genetic approaches in support of racist views of &quot;improving&quot; humanity.

Morgan&#x27;s fly-room at Columbia became world-famous, and he found it easy to attract funding and visiting academics. In 1927 after 25 years at Columbia, and nearing the age of retirement, he received an offer from George Ellery Hale to establish a school of biology in California.

===Caltech===

In 1928 Morgan joined the faculty of the California Institute of Technology where he remained until his retirement 14 years later in 1942.

Morgan moved to California to head the Division of Biology at the California Institute of Technology in 1928. In establishing the biology division, Morgan wanted to distinguish his program from those offered by Johns Hopkins and Columbia, with research focused on genetics and evolution; experimental embryology; physiology; biophysics, and biochemistry. He was also instrumental in the establishment of the Marine Laboratory at Corona del Mar. He wanted to attract the best people to the Division at Caltech, so he took Bridges, Sturtevant, Jack Shultz and Albert Tyler from Columbia and took on Theodosius Dobzhansky as an international research fellow. More scientists came to work in the Division including George Beadle, Boris Ephrussi, Edward L. Tatum, Linus Pauling, Frits Went, Edward B. Lewis, and Sidney W. Byance with his reputation, Morgan held numerous prestigious positions in American science organizations. From 1927 to 1931 Morgan served as the President of the National Academy of Sciences; in 1930 he was the President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; and in 1932 he chaired the Sixth International Congress of Genetics in Ithaca, New York. In 1933 Morgan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; he had been nominated in 1919 and 1930 for the same work. As an acknowledgment of the group nature of his discovery, he gave his prize money to Bridges, Sturtevant, and his own children. Morgan declined to attend the awards ceremony in 1933, instead attending in 1934. The 1933 rediscovery of the giant polytene chromosomes in the salivary gland of &quot;Drosophila&quot; may have influenced his choice. Until that point, the lab&#x27;s results had been inferred from phenotypic results, the visible polytene chromosome enabled them to confirm their results on a physical basis. Morgan&#x27;s Nobel acceptance speech entitled &quot;The Contribution of Genetics to Physiology and Medicine&quot; downplayed the contribution genetics could make to medicine beyond genetic counseling. In 1939 he was awarded the Copley Medal by the Royal Society.

He received two extensions of his contract at Caltech, but eventually retired in 1942, becoming a professor and chairman emeritus. George Beadle returned to Caltech to replace Morgan as chairman of the department in 1946. Although he had retired, Morgan kept offices across the road from the Division and continued laboratory work. In his retirement, he returned to the questions of sexual differentiation, regeneration, and embryology.

==Death==
Morgan had throughout his life suffered from a chronic duodenal ulcer. In 1945, at age 79, he experienced a severe heart attack and died from a ruptured artery.

==Morgan and evolution==
Morgan was interested in evolution throughout his life. He wrote his thesis on the phylogeny of sea spiders (pycnogonids) and wrote four books about evolution. In &quot;Evolution and Adaptation&quot; (1903), he argued the anti-Darwinist position that selection could never produce wholly new species by acting on slight individual differences. He rejected Darwin&#x27;s theory of sexual selection and the Neo-Lamarckian theory of the inheritance of acquired characters. Morgan was not the only scientist attacking natural selection. The period 1875–1925 has been called &#x27;The eclipse of Darwinism&#x27;. After discovering many small stable heritable mutations in &quot;Drosophila&quot;, Morgan gradually changed his mind. The relevance of mutations for evolution is that only characters that are inherited can have an effect on evolution. Since Morgan solved the problem of heredity (1915), he was in a unique position to examine critically Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection.

In &quot;&quot; (1916), Morgan discussed questions such as: &quot;Does selection play any role in evolution? How can selection produce anything new? Is selection no more than the elimination of the unfit? Is selection a creative force?&quot; After eliminating some misunderstandings and explaining in detail the new science of Mendelian heredity and its chromosomal basis, Morgan concludes, &quot;the evidence shows clearly that the characters of wild animals and plants, as well as those of domesticated races, are inherited both in the wild and in domesticated forms according to the Mendel&#x27;s Law&quot;. &quot;Evolution has taken place by the incorporation into the race of those mutations that are beneficial to the life and reproduction of the organism&quot;. Injurious mutations have practically no chance of becoming established. Far from rejecting evolution, as the title of his 1916 book may suggest, Morgan, laid the foundation of the science of genetics. He also laid the theoretical foundation for the mechanism of evolution: natural selection. Heredity was a central plank of Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection, but Darwin could not provide a working theory of heredity. Darwinism could not progress without a correct theory of genetics. By creating that foundation, Morgan contributed to the neo-Darwinian synthesis, despite his criticism of Darwin at the beginning of his career. Much work on the Evolutionary Synthesis remained to be done.

==Awards and honors==
Morgan left an important legacy in genetics. Some of Morgan&#x27;s students from Columbia and Caltech went on to win their own Nobel Prizes, including George Wells Beadle and Hermann Joseph Muller. Nobel prize winner Eric Kandel has written of Morgan, &quot;Much as Darwin&#x27;s insights into the evolution of animal species first gave coherence to nineteenth-century biology as a descriptive science, Morgan&#x27;s findings about genes and their location on chromosomes helped transform biology into an experimental science.&quot;

==Personal life==
On June 4, 1904, Morgan married Lillian Vaughan Sampson (1870–1952), who had entered graduate school in biology at Bryn Mawr the same year Morgan joined the faculty; she put aside her scientific work for 16 years of their marriage when they had four children. Later she contributed significantly to Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Drosophila&quot; work. One of their four children (one boy and three girls) was Isabel Morgan (1911–1996) (Marr. Mountain), who became a virologist at Johns Hopkins, specializing in polio research. Morgan was an atheist.

<text>The Avengers is a British espionage television series that aired from 7 January 1961 to 21 April 1969. It initially focused on David Keel (Ian Hendry), aided by John Steed (Patrick Macnee). Ian Hendry left after the first series; Steed then became the main character, partnered with a succession of assistants. His most famous assistants were intelligent, stylish, and assertive women: Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman), Emma Peel (Diana Rigg), and Tara King (Linda Thorson). Dresses and suits for the series were made by Pierre Cardin.

The series screened as one-hour episodes for its entire run. The first episode, &quot;Hot Snow&quot;, aired on 7 January 1961. The final episode, &quot;Bizarre&quot;, aired on 21 April 1969 in the United States, and on 17 May 1969 in the United Kingdom.

&quot;The Avengers&quot; was produced by ABC Weekend TV, a contractor within the ITV network. After a merger with Rediffusion London in July 1968, ABC Weekend became Thames Television, which continued production of the series, subcontracted to ABC Television Films. By 1969, &quot;The Avengers&quot; was shown in more than 90 countries. ITV produced a sequel series, &quot;The New Avengers&quot; (1976–1977), with Patrick Macnee returning as John Steed, and two new partners. In 2004 and 2007, &quot;The Avengers&quot; was ranked No. 17 and No. 20 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Top Cult Shows Ever.

==Premise==

&quot;The Avengers&quot; was marked by different eras as co-stars came and went. The only constant was John Steed, played by Patrick Macnee.

===Series 1 (1961)===
ABC Weekend TV produced a single series of &quot;Police Surgeon&quot;, in which Ian Hendry played police surgeon Geoffrey Brent, from September through December 1960. While &quot;Police Surgeon&quot; did not last long, viewers praised Ian Hendry, and ABC Television cast him in its new series &quot;The Avengers&quot;, which replaced &quot;Police Surgeon&quot; in January 1961.

&quot;The Avengers&quot; began with the episode &quot;Hot Snow&quot;, in which medical doctor David H. Keel (Hendry) investigates the murder of his fiancée, office receptionist Peggy, by a drug ring. A stranger named John Steed who was also investigating the ring appears, and together Dr. Keel and Steed set out to avenge Peggy&#x27;s death in the first two episodes. Steed asks Dr. Keel to partner with him, as needed, to solve crimes. Ian Hendry was considered the star of the new series, receiving top billing over Patrick Macnee, and Steed did not appear in two of the series&#x27; episodes.

As the first series of &quot;The Avengers&quot; progressed, Steed&#x27;s importance increased, and he carried the final episode solo. While Steed and Dr. Keel used wit while discussing crimes and dangers, the series also depicted the interplay—and often tension—between Dr. Keel&#x27;s idealism and Steed&#x27;s professionalism. As seen in one of the three surviving episodes from the first series, &quot;The Frighteners&quot;, Steed also had informants among the general population to aid his investigations, similar to the &quot;Baker Street Irregulars&quot; of Sherlock Holmes.

The other regular in the first series was Carol Wilson (Ingrid Hafner), the nurse and receptionist who replaced the slain Peggy. Carol assisted Dr. Keel and Steed in cases, and in at least one episode (&quot;Girl on the Trapeze&quot;) was very much in the thick of the action, but without being part of Steed&#x27;s inner circle. Ingrid Hafner had played opposite Ian Hendry as a nurse in one episode of &quot;Police Surgeon&quot;. The role of Carol Wilson was initially offered to Jan Watson, who turned it down for another film.

The series was shot on 405-line videotape using a multicamera setup. There was little provision for editing and virtually no location footage was shot (although the first shot of the first episode consisted of location footage). As was standard practice at the time, videotapes of early episodes of &quot;The Avengers&quot; were reused. At present, only three complete Series 1 episodes are known to exist and are held in archives as 16-mm film telerecordings: &quot;Girl on the Trapeze&quot; (which does not feature Steed), &quot;The Frighteners&quot; and &quot;Tunnel of Fear&quot;. Additionally, the first 15 minutes of the first episode, &quot;Hot Snow&quot;, also exist as a telerecording; the extant footage ends at the conclusion of the first act, prior to the introduction of John Steed.

The missing television episodes were recreated for audio by Big Finish Productions under the title of &quot;The Avengers – The Lost Episodes&quot; and star Julian Wadham as Steed, Anthony Howell as Dr Keel and Lucy Briggs-Owen as Carol Wilson.

===Series 2–3 (1962–1964)===

Production of the first series was cut short by a strike. By the time production could begin on the second series, Ian Hendry had quit to pursue a film career. Patrick Macnee was promoted to star, and Steed became the focus of the series, initially working with a rotation of three different partners. Dr Martin King (Jon Rollason), a thinly disguised recreation of the Dr. Keel character, saw action in only three episodes, which were produced from scripts written for the first series. Dr. King was intended to be a transitional character between Dr. Keel and Steed&#x27;s two new female partners, but while the Dr. King episodes were shot first, they were shown out of production order in the middle of the season. The character was thereafter quickly and quietly dropped.

Nightclub singer Venus Smith (Julie Stevens) appeared in six episodes. She was a complete &quot;amateur&quot;, meaning that she did not have any professional crime-fighting skills as did the two doctors. She was excited to be participating in a spy adventure alongside secret agent Steed (although some episodes—&quot;The Removal Men&quot;, &quot;The Decapod&quot;—indicate she is not always enthusiastic). Nonetheless, she appears to be attracted to him, and their relationship is somewhat similar to that later portrayed between Steed and Tara King. Her episodes featured live musical portions showcasing her singing performances. The character of Venus underwent some revision during her run, adopting more youthful demeanour and dress.

The first episode broadcast in the second series introduced the partner who would change the show into the format for which it is most remembered. Honor Blackman played Mrs. Cathy Gale, a self-assured, quick-witted anthropologist who was skilled in judo and had a passion for leather clothes. Widowed during the Mau Mau rebellion years in Kenya, she was the &quot;talented amateur&quot; who provided her aid to Steed&#x27;s cases as a service to her nation. She was said to have been born on 5 October 1930 at midnight, and was reared in Africa. Mrs. Catherine Gale was in her early-to-mid 30s during her tenure, in contrast to female characters in similar series who tended to be younger.

Catherine Gale was unlike any female character seen before on British TV, and she became a household name. Reportedly, part of her charm was because her earliest appearances were episodes in which dialogue written for Keel was simply transferred to her. Series scriptwriter Dennis Spooner described about this detail: &quot;There&#x27;s the famous story of how Honor Blackman played Ian Hendry&#x27;s part, which is why they stuck her in leather and such—it was so much cheaper than changing the lines!&quot; In &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot;, she holds her own in a vociferous tactical disagreement with her partner.

Venus Smith did not return for the third series, and Cathy Gale became Steed&#x27;s only regular partner. The series established a level of sexual tension between Steed and Cathy Gale, but the writers were not allowed to go beyond flirting and innuendo. Despite this, the relationship between Steed and Catherine Gale was progressive for 1962–63. In &quot;The Golden Eggs,&quot; it is revealed that Cathy Gale lived in Steed&#x27;s flat; according to Steed, her rent was to keep the refrigerator well-stocked and to cook for him (she appears to do neither). However, this was said to be a temporary arrangement while Catherine Gale looked for a new home, and Steed was sleeping at a hotel.

During the first series, there were hints that Steed worked for a branch of British Intelligence, and this was expanded in the second series. Steed initially received orders from different superiors, including someone referred to as &quot;Charles&quot;, and &quot;One-Ten&quot; (Douglas Muir). By the third series, the delivery of Steed&#x27;s orders was not depicted on screen or explained. The secret organisation to which Steed belongs is shown in &quot;The Nutshell&quot;, and it is Cathy Gale&#x27;s first visit to their headquarters.

Small references to Steed&#x27;s background were occasionally made. In the Series 3 episode &quot;Death of a Batman,&quot; it was said that Steed was with I Corps in the Second World War, and in Munich in 1945. In the Series 4 episode &quot;The Hour That Never Was,&quot; Steed attends a reunion of his RAF squadron. Since the ties he wears are either cavalry or old school, it is apparent that he has attended a number of leading public schools.

A theatrical film version of the series was in its initial planning stages by late 1963, after Series 3 was completed. An early story proposal paired Steed and Catherine Gale with a male and female duo of American agents, to make the movie appeal to the American market. Before the project could gain momentum, Honor Blackman was cast opposite Sean Connery in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, requiring her to leave the series.

====Series transformation====
During the Gale era, Steed was transformed from a rugged trenchcoat-wearing agent into the stereotypical English gentleman, complete with Savile Row suit, bowler hat and umbrella, with clothes later designed by Pierre Cardin. (Steed had first donned bowler and carried his distinctive umbrella during the first series, as &quot;The Frighteners&quot; depicts.) The bowler and umbrella were soon revealed to be full of tricks, including a sword hidden within the umbrella handle and a steel plate concealed in the hat. These items were referred to in the French, German and Polish titles of the series, &quot;Chapeau melon et bottes de cuir&quot; (&quot;Bowler hat and leather boots&quot;), &quot;Mit Schirm, Charme und Melone&quot; (&quot;With Umbrella, Charm and Bowler Hat&quot;) and &quot;Rewolwer i melonik&quot; (&quot;A Revolver and a Bowler Hat&quot;), respectively. With his impeccable manners, old-world sophistication and vintage car, Steed came to represent the traditional Englishman of an earlier era.

By contrast, Steed&#x27;s partners were youthful, forward-looking and always attired in the latest mod fashions. Catherine Gale&#x27;s innovative leather outfits suited her many athletic fight scenes. Honor Blackman became a star in Britain with her black leather outfits and boots (nicknamed &quot;kinky boots&quot;) and her judo-based fighting style. Patrick Macnee and Honor Blackman even released a novelty song called &quot;Kinky Boots&quot;. Honor Blackman also carried a pistol in &quot;Killer Whale&quot;. Some of the clothes seen in &quot;The Avengers&quot; were designed at the studio of John Sutcliffe, who published the &quot;AtomAge&quot; fetish magazine.

Series scriptwriter Dennis Spooner said that the series would frequently feature Steed visiting busy public places such as the main airport in London without anyone else present in the scene: &quot;&#x27;Can&#x27;t you afford extras?&#x27; they&#x27;d ask. Well, it wasn&#x27;t like that. It&#x27;s just that Steed had to be alone to be accepted. Put him in a crowd and he sticks out like a sore thumb! Let&#x27;s face it, with normal people he&#x27;s &quot;weird&quot;. The trick to making him acceptable is never to show him in a normal world, just fighting villains who are odder than he is!&quot;

===Series 4–5 (1965–1967)===
The show was sold to the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in 1965, and &quot;The Avengers&quot; became one of the first British series to be aired on prime-time US television. The US ABC network paid the then-unheard-of sum of $2 million for the first 26 episodes. The average budget for each episode was reportedly £56,000, which was high for the British industry. The fourth series aired in the US from March to the beginning of September 1966. Each episode still finished with the logo of ABC Weekend TV.

The US deal meant that the producers could afford to start shooting the series on 35mm film, with production transferring from ABC&#x27;s television studios in Teddington to the Associated British film studios in Elstree. The use of film, rather than the videotape of the earlier episodes, was essential, because British 405-line video was technically incompatible with the US NTSC videotape format. Filmed productions were standard on US prime-time television at the time. &quot;The Avengers&quot; continued to be produced in black-and-white.

The transfer to film meant that episodes would be shot using the single-camera setup, giving the production greater flexibility. The use of film production and the single-camera production style allowed more sophisticated visuals and camera angles, and more outdoor location shots, all of which greatly improved the look of the series. As was standard on British television filmed production through the 1960s, all location work on Series 4 was shot mute, with the soundtrack created in post-production. Dialogue scenes were filmed in the studio, leading to some jumps between location and studio footage.
New female partner Mrs. Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) debuted in October 1965. The name of the character derived from a comment by writers, during development, that they wanted a character with &quot;man appeal&quot;. In an early attempt to incorporate this concept into the character&#x27;s name, she was called &quot;Samantha Peel&quot;, shortened to the awkward &quot;Mantha Peel&quot;. Eventually, the writers began referring to the idea by the verbal shorthand &quot;M. Appeal&quot;, which gave rise to the character&#x27;s ultimate name.

After more than 60 actresses had been auditioned, the first choice to play the role was Elizabeth Shepherd. However, after filming one and a half episodes (the pilot, &quot;The Town of No Return&quot;, and part of &quot;The Murder Market&quot;), Elizabeth Shepherd was released. Her on-screen personality was deemed less interesting than that of Honor Blackman&#x27;s Catherine Gale, and it was decided that she was not right for the role. Another 20 actresses were auditioned before the show&#x27;s casting director, Dodo Watts, suggested that producers Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell check out a televised drama featuring the relatively unknown Diana Rigg. (She had earlier guested in an episode of &quot;The Sentimental Agent&quot; that Brian Clemens had written.) Diana Rigg&#x27;s screen test with Patrick Macnee showed that the two immediately worked well together.

A prologue was added to the beginning of all the fourth-series episodes for the American broadcasts. This was to clarify some initial confusion audiences had regarding the characters and their mission. In the opener, a waiter holding a champagne bottle falls dead onto a human-sized chessboard, a dagger protruding from a target on his back. Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel (dressed in her trademark leather catsuit) walk up to the body as the voice-over explains: &quot;Extraordinary crimes against the people, and the state, have to be avenged by agents extraordinary. Two such people are John Steed, top professional, and his partner Emma Peel, talented amateur. Otherwise known as The Avengers&quot;. During this voice-over, Steed pours two drinks from the wine bottle and Mrs. Peel replaces her gun in her boot. They clink glasses and depart together as the screen fades to black and the opening titles begin.
In contrast to the Gale episodes, there is a lighter, comic touch in Steed&#x27;s and Mrs. Emma Peel&#x27;s interactions with each other and their reactions to other characters and situations. Earlier series had a harder tone, with the Gale era including some quite serious espionage dramas. This almost completely disappeared as Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel visibly enjoy topping each other&#x27;s witticisms. The layer of conflict with Catherine Gale—who on occasion openly resented being used by Steed, often without her permission—is absent from Steed&#x27;s interaction with Emma Peel. Also, the sexual tension between Steed and Catherine Gale is quite different from the tension between Steed and Emma Peel. In both cases, the exact relationship between the partners is left ambiguous, although they seemed to have &quot;carte blanche&quot; to visit each other&#x27;s homes whenever they please, and it is not uncommon for scenes to suggest that Steed had spent the night at Catherine Gale&#x27;s or Emma Peel&#x27;s home, or vice versa. Although nothing &quot;improper&quot; is displayed, the close chemistry between Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel constantly suggests intimacy between the two.

Science fiction and fantasy elements (a style later known as Spy-Fi) also began to emerge in storylines. The duo encounters killer robots (&quot;The Cybernauts&quot;), telepaths (&quot;Too Many Christmas Trees&quot;) and giant alien carnivorous plants (&quot;The Man-Eater of Surrey Green&quot;).

In her fourth episode, &quot;Death at Bargain Prices,&quot; Mrs. Emma Peel takes an undercover job at a department store. Her uniform for promoting space-age toys is an elaborate leather catsuit plus silver boots, sash and welder&#x27;s gloves. The suit (minus the silver accessories) became her signature outfit, which she wore primarily for fight scenes in early episodes and in the titles. Some episodes contain a fetishistic undercurrent. In &quot;A Touch of Brimstone&quot;, Mrs. Peel dresses in a dominatrix outfit of corset, laced boots and spiked collar to become the &quot;Queen of Sin&quot;.
Emma Peel&#x27;s avant-garde fashions, featuring bold accents and high-contrast geometric patterns, emphasise her youthful, contemporary personality. For the 1965 season, some of her most memorable outfits were designed by John Bates, including graphic black-and-white Op art mini-coats and accessories, and a silver ensemble comprising a bra bodice, low-slung trousers and jacket. She represents the modern England of the Sixties – just as Steed, with his vintage style and mannerisms, personifies Edwardian-era nostalgia. According to Patrick Macnee in his book &quot;The Avengers and Me,&quot; Diana Rigg disliked wearing leather and insisted on a new line of fabric athletic wear for the fifth series. Alun Hughes, who had designed clothing for Diana Rigg&#x27;s personal wardrobe, was suggested by the actress to design Emma Peel&#x27;s &quot;softer&quot; new wardrobe. Pierre Cardin was brought in to design a new wardrobe for Macnee. In the US, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ran a four-page photo spread on Diana Rigg&#x27;s new &quot;Emmapeeler&quot; outfits (10–16 June 1967). Eight tight-fitting jumpsuits were created, in a variety of bright colours and made of the stretch fabric crimplene.

====Move to colour====
After one filmed series (of 26 episodes) in black and white, &quot;The Avengers&quot; began filming in colour for the fifth series in 1966. It was three years before Britain&#x27;s ITV network began full colour broadcasting. The first 16 episodes of this series were broadcast concurrently in the US, in colour, and the UK, in black and white, from January to May 1967. Eight further episodes were broadcast in the UK beginning in late September, while these episodes were withheld in the US until early 1968, where they would be immediately succeeded by the first batch of episodes featuring Diana Rigg&#x27;s replacement, Linda Thorson. The American prologue of the fourth series was modified for the colour episodes. The show opened with the caption &quot;The Avengers in Color&quot; (required by the US ABC for colour series at that time), followed by Steed unwrapping the foil from a champagne bottle and Emma Peel shooting the cork away. Unlike the &quot;chessboard&quot; opening of the previous series, this new prologue had no narrative voice-over, and the scene was also included in UK broadcasts of the series. At the end of the closing credits, all previous series had ended with the ABC Weekend TV logo, but the fifth and sixth series — now made by ABC&#x27;s sister company A.B.C. Television Films — instead featured an animation where the letters &quot;ABC&quot; were revealed to stand for &quot;Associated British Corporation&quot;, a name apparently invented for ABC shows exported to the US to avoid confusion with the US ABC network. (The legal name of ABC Weekend TV was originally &quot;Associated British Cinemas (Television) Ltd&quot;, later shortened to &quot;A.B.C. Television Ltd&quot;.)

The first 16 episodes of the fifth series begin with Emma Peel receiving a call-to-duty message from Steed: &quot;Mrs. Peel, we&#x27;re needed&quot;. Emma Peel would be conducting her normal activities when she unexpectedly received a message on a calling card or within a delivered gift, at which point Steed suddenly appeared (usually in her apartment). 
The series also introduced a comic tagline caption to the episode title, using the format of &quot;Steed [does this], Emma [does that]&quot;. For example, &quot;The Joker&quot; had the opening caption: &quot;Steed trumps an ace, Emma plays a lone hand&quot;. &quot;The Joker&quot; was to a large extent a rewrite of &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Behind You&quot;, a black-and-white Cathy Gale episode. Three other colour Emma Peel episodes were rewrites of Cathy Gale episodes.

The &quot;Mrs Peel, we&#x27;re needed&quot; scenes and the alternate taglines were dropped after the first 16 episodes, after a break in production, for financial reasons. They were deemed by the UK networks as disposable if &quot;The Avengers&quot; was to return to ITV screens (Dave Rogers&#x27; book &quot;The Avengers Anew&quot; lists a set for every Steed/Emma Peel episode except &quot;The Forget-Me-Knot&quot;).

Stories were increasingly characterised by a futuristic, science-fiction bent, with mad scientists and their creations wreaking havoc. The duo dealt with being shrunk to doll size (&quot;Mission... Highly Improbable&quot;), pet cats being electrically altered to become ferocious and lethal &quot;miniature tigers&quot; (&quot;The Hidden Tiger&quot;), killer automata (&quot;Return of The Cybernauts&quot;), mind-transferring machines (&quot;Who&#x27;s Who???&quot;) and invisible foes (&quot;The See-Through Man&quot;).

The series parodied its American contemporaries with episodes such as &quot;The Girl From AUNTIE&quot;, &quot;Mission... Highly Improbable&quot; and &quot;The Winged Avenger&quot; (spoofing &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot;, respectively). The show still carried the basic format: Steed and his associate were charged with solving the problem in the space of a 50-minute episode, thus preserving the safety of 1960s Britain.

Humour was evident in the names and acronyms of the organisations. For example, in &quot;The Living Dead,&quot; two rival groups examine reported ghost sightings: FOG (Friends of Ghosts) and SMOG (Scientific Measurement of Ghosts). &quot;The Hidden Tiger&quot; features the Philanthropic Union for Rescue, Relief and Recuperation of Cats—PURRR—led by characters named Cheshire, Manx and Angora.

The series also occasionally adopted a metafictional tone, coming close to breaking the fourth wall. In the Series 5 episode &quot;Something Nasty in the Nursery&quot;, Emma Peel directly refers to the series&#x27; storytelling convention of having potentially helpful sources of information killed off just before she or Steed arrive. This then occurs a few minutes later. In the tag scene for the same episode, Steed and Emma Peel tell viewers—indirectly—to tune in next week.

Diana Rigg&#x27;s stunt double was stuntwoman Cyd Child, though stuntman Peter Elliot doubled for Diana Rigg in a stunt dive in &quot;The Bird Who Knew Too Much&quot;.

====Diana Rigg&#x27;s departure====
Diana Rigg was initially unhappy with the way she was treated by the show&#x27;s producers. During her first series, she learned that she was being paid less than the cameraman. She demanded a raise to put her more on a par with her co-star, or she would leave the show. The producers gave in, thanks to the show&#x27;s great popularity in the US. At the end of the fifth series in 1967, Diana Rigg left to pursue other projects. This included following Honor Blackman to play a leading role in a James Bond film, &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, as James Bond&#x27;s wife Tracy Bond.

On 25 October 2015, to mark 50 years of Emma Peel, the BFI (British Film Institute) screened an episode of &quot;The Avengers&quot; followed by an onstage interview with Diana Rigg, during which she discussed her reasons for leaving the show and Patrick Macnee&#x27;s reaction to her departure. Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg remained lifelong friends.

===Series 6 (1968–1969)===

When Diana Rigg left the series in October 1967, the British network executives decided that the current series formula, despite resulting in popular success, could not be pursued further. Thus, they decided that a &quot;return to realism&quot; was appropriate for the sixth series (1968–69). Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell were replaced by John Bryce, producer of most of the Cathy Gale-era episodes.

John Bryce had a difficult situation to handle. He had to find a replacement for Diana Rigg and shoot the first seven episodes of the new series, which were supposed to be shipped to the US together with the last eight Emma Peel colour episodes. Bryce signed his then-girlfriend, 20-year-old newcomer Linda Thorson, as the new female co-star and chose the name Tara King for her character. Linda Thorson played the role with more innocence in mind and at heart, and unlike the previous partnerships with Cathy Gale and Emma Peel, the writers allowed subtle hints of romance to blossom between Steed and Tara King. Tara King also differed from Steed&#x27;s previous partners in that she was a fully fledged (albeit initially inexperienced) agent working for Steed&#x27;s organisation; his previous partners had all been (in the words of the prologue used for American broadcasts of the first Rigg series) talented amateurs. Bryce wanted Tara to be blonde, so Linda Thorson&#x27;s brown hair was bleached. However, the process badly damaged Linda Thorson&#x27;s hair, so she had to wear wigs for the first third of her episodes, until her own hair grew back. Her natural brown hair was not seen until the episode, &quot;All Done with Mirrors.&quot;

Production of the first seven episodes of the sixth series began, but the financial problems and internal difficulties undermined John Bryce&#x27;s effort. He only managed to complete three episodes: &quot;Invitation to a Killing&quot; (a 90-minute episode introducing Tara King), &quot;The Great, Great Britain Crime&quot; (some of its original footage was reused in the 1969 episode &quot;Homicide and Old Lace&quot;), and &quot;Invasion of the Earthmen&quot; (which survived relatively intact except for the scenes in which Tara wears a brown wig).

After a rough cut screening of these episodes to studio executives, John Bryce was fired and Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell were summoned back. At their return, a fourth episode called &quot;The Murderous Connection&quot; was in its second day of production. After revising the script, it was renamed as &quot;The Curious Case of the Countless Clues&quot; and production resumed. Production of the episode &quot;Split!&quot;, a leftover script from the Emma Peel colour series, proceeded. Two completely new episodes were also shot: &quot;Get-A-Way&quot;, and &quot;Look (Stop Me If You&#x27;ve Heard This One) But There Were These Two Fellers&quot;.

Dennis Spooner said of the event:

Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell decided to film a new episode to introduce Tara King. This, the third episode filmed for the sixth series, was titled &quot;The Forget-Me-Knot&quot; and bade farewell to Emma Peel and introduced her successor, a trained but inexperienced agent named Tara King. It would be broadcast as the first episode of the sixth series. Tara debuts in dynamic style: when Steed is called to Headquarters, he is attacked and knocked down by trainee agent Tara King, who mistakes him for her training partner.

No farewell scenes for Emma Peel had been shot when Diana Rigg left the series. She was recalled for &quot;The Forget-Me-Knot&quot;, through which Emma acts as Steed&#x27;s partner as usual. Diana Rigg also filmed a farewell scene for Emma that appeared as the tag scene of the episode. It was explained that Emma&#x27;s husband, Peter Peel, was found alive and rescued, and she left the British secret service to be with him. Emma visits Steed to say goodbye, and while leaving she passes Tara on the stairway giving the advice that &quot;he likes his tea stirred anti-clockwise&quot;. Steed looks out of the window as a departing Emma enters the Bentley driven by Peter, who from a distance seems to resemble Steed (and was played by Steed&#x27;s regular stunt double, with bowler hat and umbrella).

John Bryce&#x27;s original episode introducing Tara, &quot;Invitation to a Killing&quot;, was revised as a regular 60-minute episode named &quot;Have Guns Will Haggle&quot;. These episodes, together with &quot;Invasion of the Earthmen&quot; and the last eight Emma Peel colour episodes, were shipped to the US in February 1968.

For this series the government official who gave Steed his orders was depicted on screen. Mother, introduced in &quot;The Forget-Me-Knot,&quot; is a man in a wheelchair. The role was taken by Patrick Newell, who had played different roles in two earlier episodes, most recently in Series 5. Mother&#x27;s headquarters would shift from place to place, including one episode in which his complete office was on the top level of a double-decker bus. Several James Bond films of the 1970s would make use of a similar gimmick for Bond&#x27;s briefings.

Added later as a regular was Mother&#x27;s mute Amazonian assistant, Rhonda, played by uncredited actress Rhonda Parker. There was one appearance by an agency official code-named &quot;Father&quot;, a blind older woman played by Iris Russell. (Iris Russell had appeared in the series several times previously in other roles.) In one episode, &quot;Killer&quot;, Steed is paired with Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney (Jennifer Croxton) while King is on holiday.

Scriptwriter Dennis Spooner later reflected: &quot;When I wrote &#x27;Look (Stop Me If You&#x27;ve Heard This One) But There Were These Two Fellers&#x27;, that was definitely the last series. They were going to make no more, so in that series we went right over the top; we went &quot;really&quot; weird, because they knew there weren&#x27;t going to be any more&quot;.

Dennis Spooner said the series &quot;worked because it became a parody on itself, almost. You can only do that so long.&quot; He attributes the overall success of the show to its light approach: &quot;We spoofed everything; we took &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;, &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot;, &quot;High Noon&quot;, &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;, &quot;The Birds&quot;... we took them all. The film buffs used to love it. There were always lines in it that people knew what we were talking about&quot;.

The revised series continued to be broadcast in the US. The episodes with Linda Thorson as Tara King proved to be highly rated in Europe and the UK. However, in the US, the ABC network chose to air it opposite the number-one show in the country at the time, &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;. Steed and Tara King could not compete, and the show was cancelled in the US. Without this vital commercial backing, production could not continue in Britain either, and the series ended in May 1969. The final scene of the final episode (&quot;Bizarre&quot;) has Steed and Tara King, champagne glasses in hand, accidentally launching themselves into orbit aboard a rocket, as Mother breaks the fourth wall and says to the audience &quot;They&#x27;ll be back!&quot;, before adding in shock &quot;They&#x27;re unchaperoned up there!&quot;

==Production==
===Music===

The 1961 series featured a jazz-influenced theme by John Dankworth. Library music was used sparsely as a soundtrack, sometimes with variations based on the main theme. Dankworth&#x27;s theme music was reworked for the third series. John Dankworth&#x27;s first theme was recorded on the Columbia label, on a 45rpm single, and a new recording, similar to the reworked television theme was issued on Fontana in 1963. A very faithful cover version was released by Johnny Gregory.

When Diana Rigg joined the series in 1965, the opening credits of the series were redesigned and new theme music by Laurie Johnson was introduced. This was based on a previously released title on LP, called &quot;The Shake&quot; (which capitalised on &quot;The Shake&quot; dance craze of the &#x27;60s). For the colour series (1967), a percussion section was added to accompany the new teaser sequence at the start of each episode. Laurie Johnson re-scored the theme when Linda Thorson joined the series, adding a counter-melody on trumpet, based on the leitmotif for Tara King from the final Diana Rigg episode &quot;The Forget-Me-Knot.&quot; The new theme debuted in the closing titles of the episode &quot;The Forget-Me-Knot,&quot; which introduced Linda Thorson. It was altogether more dynamic, and included a much more frenetic percussion section, for the revised teaser sequence. Importantly, the filmed episodes contained specially composed scores by Johnson. To accompany Steed&#x27;s request, &quot;Mrs. Peel – we&#x27;re needed!&quot;, he composed a brief &#x27;sting&#x27;, and there was also a special theme for &#x27;Emma&#x27;. For the &#x27;Linda Thorson&#x27; series, a characteristic piece was composed to accompany the tag scene, at the end of each episode. Many of the most memorable cues from the Rigg/Thorson series, including the opening, and closing titles themes, and the &#x27;Tag Scene&#x27; were released commercially on CD in 2009.

Owing to a professional commitment to score for the film &quot;Hot Millions&quot; (starring Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith), Laurie Johnson requested assistance from his keyboard player, Howard Blake, who scored some of the episodes of the final season, as well as additional music for other episodes which Laurie Johnson did not have time to complete. These were composed in a style remarkably similar to Laurie Johnson&#x27;s. In 2011, to mark the 50th anniversary of the series, these almost-complete scores by Howard Blake−including Laurie Johnson&#x27;s themes for the main and end titles—were issued on a double-CD set. Of the original Johnson theme, countless cover versions have been released on vinyl and CD, and the opening motif was retained on the series &quot;The New Avengers&quot;.

Laurie Johnson subsequently collaborated with Brian Clemens on other projects, including the theme for &quot;The New Avengers&quot;.

===Cars===
The cars used in the series became almost as famous as the actors. From the 4th series on, Steed&#x27;s signature cars were six vintage, green 1926–1928 Bentley racing or town cars, including Blower Bentleys and Bentley Speed Sixes (although, uniquely, in &quot;The Thirteenth Hole&quot; he drives a Vauxhall 30-98). In the final series, he drove two yellow Rolls-Royces – a 1923 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost and a 1927 Rolls-Royce New Phantom. Peel drove Lotus Elan convertibles (a white 1964 and a powder blue 1966), which, like her clothes, emphasised her independence and vitality. During the first Peel series (Series 4), each episode ended with a short, humorous scene of the duo leaving the scene of their most recent adventure in some unusual vehicle. Mother occasionally appeared in a silver Rolls-Royce. Tara King drove an AC 428 and a Lotus Europa. Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney drove an MGC Roadster.

===Production team===
Sydney Newman, who would later go on to spearhead the creation of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for the BBC, never received screen credit as the creator of &quot;The Avengers&quot;. In his memoir, &quot;The Avengers and Me&quot;, Patrick Macnee interviewed Newman about this. Newman explained that he never sought on-screen credit on the series because during his previous tenure at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, such credits were not given, and he never thought to get one for &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

The production team changed during the series&#x27; long run, particularly between the third and fourth series, but the influence of Brian Clemens was felt throughout. He wrote the second episode and became the series&#x27; most prolific scriptwriter. Succeeding producers Leonard White and John Bryce, Julian Wintle became the producer of the 4th series with Brian Clemens credited as associate producer and Albert Fennell credited as &quot;In charge of production&quot;. For series 5, made by A.B.C. Television Films (which was created during the run-up to ABC Weekend TV and Associated-Rediffusion forming Thames TV) Clemens and Fennell became co-producers, with Wintle as executive producer. For series 6, after its initial producer John Bryce left, Clemens and Fennell returned as co-producers; early episodes also credit Julian Wintle as consultant to the series and Philip Levene as story consultant.

Ray Austin became the fight arranger for series 4 and 5, introducing kung fu to the series. Ray Austin had been training with Chee Soo and they worked techniques from Feng Shou kung fu and tai chi into the fight scenes and credit sequences. Ray Austin, Diana Rigg and Chee Soo were later awarded a Guinness world record as the first people to show kung fu on television. Later he became a prolific television director. Joe Dunne took over for series 6.

==Episodes==
Six series of &quot;The Avengers&quot; were made between 1961 and 1969. There was an enforced break in filming and transmission towards the end of series five due to financial problems. Television researcher Andrew Pixley and authors Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping in their book &quot;The Avengers Dossier: The Unauthorised and Unofficial Guide&quot; consider the last eight episodes produced after the break as constituting a short series six, and therefore count seven series in total. Within the internal production of &quot;The Avengers&quot; the last eight episodes were considered to be a continuation of series five.

==Reception==
===In Canada and the United States===
Although telerecordings of the second and third series were seen in Canada as early as 1963, the first two series of &quot;The Avengers&quot; were not broadcast on television in the United States. The American ABC purchased the rights to broadcast seasons 4 and 5 in the United States in 1965. The sale of &quot;The Avengers&quot; to United States television prompted a change in production style from the 405-line British multi-camera stand to the single-camera shooting method, originated on 35mm film.

The series&#x27; stunt man and stunt arranger Ray Austin expressed the opinion that the show&#x27;s violence ultimately harmed its popular success in the United States. There &quot;The Avengers&quot; was given a late timeslot due to its violence: &quot;They did that with the first &quot;Avengers&quot; here [in the U.S.], with Diana Rigg. They put us on at 11:30 pm on CBS , because it was too violent&quot;. Austin goes on to explain that US television follows a &quot;different code&quot;. Austin said that on &quot;The Avengers&quot; &quot;we were determined to do the show our way, the English way, and no one was going to stop us! And, indeed, no one did stop us. We never, never got to prime time. And it was our own faults, because we would not comply to the Midwest. That&#x27;s where the money comes from in this country, nowhere else. Forget Los Angeles, forget New York—you have to aim for the Midwest. If the Midwest watches your show, you&#x27;ve made it&quot;. In fact the first and second series of Emma Peel episodes mainly aired at 10:00 pm on ABC. The final Rigg episodes and all the Linda Thorson episodes mainly ran at 7:30 pm, also on ABC.

American censors objected to some content, in particular the episode &quot;A Touch of Brimstone&quot;, which featured a modern-day version of the Hellfire Club and climaxed with Emma being dressed in a skimpy corset costume with spiked collar and high-heeled boots to become the Queen of Sin, and being attacked with a whip by guest star Peter Wyngarde. The American broadcast network refused to air it. In total five episodes from the first Emma Peel series were not initially broadcast by ABC. These were: &quot;A Surfeit of H2O&quot;, &quot;Silent Dust&quot; (which featured Emma being attacked with a horsewhip), &quot;Quick-Quick Slow Death&quot;, &quot;A Touch of Brimstone&quot; and &quot;Honey for the Prince&quot; (in which Emma performed the dance of the seven veils), although they were seen in later syndicated repeats.

Earlier Cathy Gale and Venus Smith episodes had aired in Canada before the arrival of Mrs. Peel. US audiences saw the 1962–1964 Gale and Smith episodes of the series for the first time in the early 1990s when they were broadcast on the A&amp;E Network. No Keel episode of the series was ever repeatedly broadcast outside Britain, contributing to the fact nearly all first-series episodes are now lost, and even in the UK only one surviving episode, &quot;The Frighteners&quot;, was rebroadcast (as part of a run of classic episodes on Channel 4 in early 1993, otherwise mostly consisting of Gale episodes).

==Home media==
Only three complete episodes from the show&#x27;s first series, plus a portion of another episode, are known to exist, as 16mm film telerecordings. These are &quot;The Frighteners&quot; (an extract of which is playing on a television in the film &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;), &quot;Girl on the Trapeze&quot;, which was found in the UCLA Film and Television Archive via an internet search of their on-line database, and &quot;Tunnel of Fear&quot;, which was found in 2016. Additionally, part of the show&#x27;s first episode was also found in the United States. The footage is of the episode&#x27;s first 21 minutes, up to the first commercial break.

All series 2 and series 3 episodes survive as 16mm telerecordings. These have been released to DVD, as have all of the Emma Peel and Tara King episodes, which were shot on film. The two earlier-found surviving complete Keel episodes, plus the remnant of the first episode, have also been released in the UK and US, but are not currently available in the US. None of the original videotapes of series 1, 2 and 3 survive.

From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, A&amp;E TV Home Entertainment (under license from Canal+ Image International) released the remaining surviving series on Region 1 DVD in North America, with newly remastered picture and sound quality.

Series 4, 5 and 6 were remastered and released on Blu-ray by Studio Canal.

==Sequel==
===&quot;The New Avengers&quot;===
The sustained popularity of the Tara King episodes in France led to a 1975 French television advertisement for Laurent-Perrier champagne, in which Thorson and Macnee reprised their roles. The advertisement&#x27;s success spurred financing interest in France for new episodes of &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

The result was a new series, &quot;The New Avengers&quot;. Patrick Macnee reprised the role of Steed, with two new partners, Mike Gambit (Gareth Hunt) and Purdey (Joanna Lumley). It aired on ITV in the UK in 1976–1977, CTV in Canada, CBS in the United States (in 1978–79) and TF1 in France (series 1 in 1976–1977 and series 2 in 1979). The final four episodes were almost completely produced by Canadian interests and were filmed there. In some markets they carried the title &quot;The New Avengers in Canada&quot;.

Although Macnee was the only actor from the original series to reprise his role, archival footage of Diana Rigg allowed Emma Peel to make a cameo appearance in a second-season episode &quot;K is for Kill: The Tiger Awakes&quot;, while Macnee&#x27;s first co-star, Ian Hendry, made a guest appearance as a different character in the episode &quot;To Catch a Rat&quot;.

==Spin-offs==
===Novels===
A number of original novels based on the series were published in the 1960s. The first by Douglas Enefer, published by Consul Books, was the only 60s novel to feature Cathy Gale. Panther Books published four novels written by John Garforth featuring Emma Peel in the United Kingdom in 1967; Berkley Medallion Books reprinted these in the United States. After Panther stopped publishing &quot;Avengers&quot; novels in the UK, Berkley Medallion continued publishing original novels of their own: one featuring Peel and four featuring Tara King for the US market only; three by Keith Laumer in 1968; and two by Norman Daniels 1968/69. Berkley Medallion later re-printed all nine novels with new covers that featured photos of both Rigg and Thorson, regardless of which &quot;Avengers&quot; girl appeared in the novel. The two novels published by Hodder and Stoughton in 1965/66 were co-written by Patrick Macnee, making him one of the first actors to write licensed spin-off fiction of their own shows. The Macnee novels, &quot;Deadline&quot; and &quot;Dead Duck&quot;, were reprinted in the UK by Titan Books in standard paperback in 1994 and in France by Huitieme Art (1995 &amp; 1996). They were also published in the US for the first time by TV Books in 1998. Titan reissued the books in trade paperback format (with the same covers) to coincide with the release of the 1998 feature film.

The 1990 novel &quot;Too Many Targets&quot; by John Peel featured all of Steed&#x27;s partners (David Keel, Cathy Gale, Emma Peel and Tara King) with the exception of Venus Smith and Dr Martin King.

A short story by Peter Leslie entitled &quot;What&#x27;s a Ghoul Like You Doing in a Place Like This?&quot; appeared in &quot;The Television Crimebusters Omnibus&quot;, a hardback anthology edited by Peter Haining, first published by Orion in 1994 (this Steed and Tara story first appeared in the 1969 UK Avengers annual, from Atlas publications). Both of the Macnee/Leslie UK paperback titles were translated and published in Portugal in 1967 as &quot;Os Vingadores: O Dia Depois De Amanha&quot; (&quot;Deadline&quot;) and &quot;Os Vingadores: O Pato Morto&quot; (&quot;Dead Duck&quot;) by Deaga. All four UK John Garforth Panther book paperbacks were translated and published by Roman in France (1967), a paperback omnibus edition was published in 1998 by Fleuve Noir. Three of the Garforth paperbacks were also translated and published by Heyne in Germany (1967/68) (&quot;Heil Harris!&quot; was not translated for obvious reasons) and a German hardback omnibus edition of the three titles was published by Lichtenberg (1968), reprinted in paperback by Heyne in 1998. All four titles were also translated and published in the Netherlands by Bruna (1967) and in Chile by Zig-Zag (1968). 

===Comics===
The first UK Avengers comic strips, featuring Steed and Cathy Gale, first appeared in regional TV listings magazines &quot;Look Westward&quot; and &quot;The Viewer&quot; from 14 September 1963 to 9 May 1964 (and later in 1964, re-printed in the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;). This run consisted of four serials.

Steed and Mrs Peel comic strips began in Polystyle Publications&#x27; &quot;TV Comic&quot; in issue #720, dated 2 October 1965, beginning after the TV debut of Emma Peel, and ran until issue #771, dated 24 September 1966 – this run consisted of 10 serials plus one 4-page one-off in &quot;TV Comic Holiday Special&quot; (June 1966). At that point the rights were sold to publishers D.C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd, where the next version of the strip appeared in issue #199, dated 10 December 1966, of &quot;Diana&quot; the popular paper for girls. Its run ended in issue #224, dated 2 June 1967, with art by Emilio Frejo and Juan Gonzalez Alacrojo – this run consisted of 8 serials.

Earlier, &quot;The Growing Up of Emma Peel&quot; comic strip had appeared in &quot;June and Schoolfriend&quot; comic from issue #52, dated 29 January 1966, to issue #63, dated 16 April 1966. This had featured the adventures of 14-year-old Emma Knight and was run concurrent with the &quot;TV Comic&quot; strip and consisted of 11 instalments.

The Avengers returned to &quot;TV Comic&quot; issue #877, dated 5 October 1968, just after Tara King debuted on TV, the Tara &amp; Steed strip continued until issue #1077, dated 5 August 1972. This run consisted of 28 serials plus a 4-page one-off in &quot;TV Comic Holiday Special 1972&quot;. Also in 1966 Thorpe &amp; Porter published a 68-page Avengers comic featuring Steed &amp; Peel, with original art by Mick Anglo and Mick Austin — this consisted of four 16-page stories.

A few &quot;Avengers&quot;-related comic books have been published in the USA. They are not named &quot;The Avengers&quot; because the rights to the names &quot;Avengers&quot; and &quot;New Avengers&quot; are held by Marvel Comics for use with their Avengers comics depicting a team of superheroes called &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Gold Key Comics published one issue of &quot;John Steed Emma Peel&quot; in 1968 (subtitled &quot;The Avengers&quot; on the Indicia page), which included two newly coloured and reformatted &quot;The Avengers&quot; strips from &quot;TV Comic&quot;.

A 3-issue limited entitled &quot;Steed and Mrs. Peel&quot; appeared in 1990–1992 under the Acme Press/Eclipse Comics imprint; it featured a three-part story, &quot;The Golden Game&quot; in issues #1–3, by Grant Morrison and a two-part story, in issues #2 &amp; #3, &quot;A Deadly Rainbow&quot; by Anne Caulfield; both strips had art by Ian Gibson. Boom! Studios reprinted this series in six issues in early 2012, and later published a new ongoing series written by Mark Waid and Caleb Monroe which lasted 12 issues. Boom! subsequently announced a six-issue follow-up series, &quot;Steed and Mrs. Peel: We&#x27;re Needed&quot;, which was launched in the summer of 2014. Despite issue #1 showing &quot;1 of 6&quot;, only 3 issues were produced (&quot;2 of 3&quot; and &quot;3 of 3&quot; showing on the other issues, with the cover for issue #3 being the one originally planned for issue #4 which was planned to be the start of another 3-issue story).

In the UK, where hardback annuals are traditionally produced for sale at Christmas, The Avengers first appeared in &quot;TV Crimebusters Annual&quot; (1962) and featured a 7-page comic strip with Dr David Keel titled &quot;The Drug Pedlar&quot;. Atlas Publications produced three &quot;The Avengers&quot; hardback Annuals for 1967, 1968 and 1969, which also featured original Avengers comic strips featuring Steed, Emma Peel, and Tara King, as well as text stories.

The &quot;TV Comic&quot; Avengers strips and the 1966 Avengers comic and a few comic strips from the Annuals have been translated and published in Germany, the Netherlands, France, and Chile.

The Avengers also have made a number of cameo appearances in comics over the years:
* In 1991&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; #173, Gary Russell and artists Mike Collins and Steve Pini show Captain Britain about to hit John Steed when Emma Peel shows up behind him.
* Emma Peel and John Steed were seen among the crowd in a bar scene in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; #2 (1996) by Mark Waid and Alex Ross.
* Emma Peel and John Steed appeared unnamed in &quot;Superman&quot; #13 (1988) by John Byrne and Karl Kesel.
* A crossover series, &quot;Batman &#x27;66 Meets Steed and Mrs. Peel&quot;, was launched in June 2016 as a joint effort between DC Comics and Boom! Studios.
* Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; is littered with oblique references to events and characters in &quot;The Avengers&quot;, with three unnamed characters that are clearly Purdey, Tara and Emma appearing at the end of the book &quot;Century: 2009&quot;.

===Stage play===
A stage adaptation was produced in Britain in 1971, written by TV series veterans Brian Clemens and Terence Feely, and directed by Leslie Phillips. It starred Simon Oates as Steed, Sue Lloyd as new partner Hannah Wild, and Kate O&#x27;Mara as villainess Madame Gerda. All three had guest roles in the original series.

A character named Hana Wilde (played by Charlotte Rampling) had essentially acted as Steed&#x27;s partner in series five&#x27;s &quot;The Superlative Seven&quot;, an episode in which Emma Peel appears only briefly. According to John Peel in his overview of &quot;The Superlative Seven&quot;, Charlotte Rampling was rumoured to be grooming up to replace Diana Rigg in this story, but nothing ever came of that&quot;.

===Radio series===
A radio series was transmitted between 6 December 1971 and 28 December 1973 on Springbok Radio, the English-language service of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC); it was recorded at Sonovision Studios in Johannesburg, produced by Dave Gooden, the original TV scripts were adapted and directed by Tony Jay, for the first six months and Dennis Folbigge for the remainder. South Africa did not have national television until 1976. The episodes were adapted from both Emma Peel and Tara King episodes (with Tara changed to Emma Peel throughout). The Avengers were played by two British expatriate actors, Donald Monat as Steed and Diane Appleby as Mrs Peel, with Hugh Rouse as the tongue-in-cheek narrator. The stories were adapted into five-episode serials under Tony Jay and six- and seven-episode serials under Dennis Folbigge, of approximately 15 minutes each (including adverts) and stripped across the week, Monday-Friday, on Springbok Radio.

Currently only 19 complete serials survive, all from reel-to-reel off-air recordings made by John Wright in 1972. Also, the first three episodes of a remake of &quot;Escape in Time&quot; currently exist. Episodes 1 and 2 are copies from the original Sonovision tapes, and episode 3 is from an off-air recording, on audio cassette, made by Barbara Peterson; the rest of this serial is still missing. These episodes are also known to have been transmitted in New York on station WBAI on 99.5 FM, from 1977 to the early 1990s, and are currently being transmitted on Miami station WRGP on early Monday mornings.

Copies from the original off-air recordings have been restored by Alan and Alys Hayes, and can be heard at their &quot;The Avengers Declassified&quot; website and its sister website &quot;Avengers on the Radio&quot;.

Many more serials were broadcast during its two-year run on South African radio; it is thought 83 serials were made and transmitted, but no other episodes are known to exist at present.

===Film===

Plans for a feature-length adaptation based upon the series circulated during the 1960s, 1980s and 1990s, with Mel Gibson at one point being considered a front-runner for the role of Steed. Ultimately, the 1998 film, starring Uma Thurman as Emma Peel and Ralph Fiennes as John Steed, with Sean Connery as the villain, received extremely negative reviews from critics and fans, and is a notorious commercial failure.

===Audio===
In June 2013, Big Finish Productions signed a license with StudioCanal to produce full-cast audio productions of 12 lost first-season episodes. The main cast includes Julian Wadham as Steed, Anthony Howell as Dr David Keel, and Lucy Briggs-Owen as Carol Wilson. The stories are adapted for audio by John Dorney.

In January 2014, Volume One, containing the first four stories, (&quot;Hot Snow&quot;, &quot;Brought to Book&quot;, &quot;Square Root of Evil&quot; and &quot;One for the Mortuary&quot;) was released. Volume Two, containing the next four stories, (&quot;Ashes of Roses&quot;, &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Feed the Animals&quot;, &quot;The Radioactive Man&quot; and &quot;Dance with Death&quot;) was released in July 2014. Volume Three, containing the next four stories, was released in January 2015.

In March 2014, Big Finish extended the audio recreation programme to include all 26 season one episodes, including the then-two extant stories. A total of seven boxed sets were released.

===Proposed reboots===
In a 2023 interview, Charlie Higson said he and Paul Whitehouse had been offered an opportunity to helm a new series, but had declined.

On 18 January 2024, it was announced that Mickey Down and Konrad Kay were developing a reboot for StudioCanal.

<text>A triathlon is an endurance multisport race consisting of swimming, cycling, and running over various distances. Triathletes compete for fastest overall completion time, racing each segment sequentially with the time transitioning between the disciplines included. The word is of Greek origin, from (), &#x27;three&#x27;, and (), &#x27;competition&#x27;.

The sport originated in the late 1970s in Southern California as sports clubs and individuals developed the sport. This history has meant that variations of the sport were created and still exist. It also led to other three-stage races using the name triathlon despite not being continuous or not consisting of swim, bike, and run elements.

Triathletes train to achieve endurance, strength, and speed. The sport requires focused persistent and periodised training for each of the three disciplines, as well as combination workouts and general strength conditioning.

==History==

The evolution of triathlon as a distinct sport is difficult to trace with precision. Many, including triathlon historian and author Scott Tinley, consider events in early 20th-century France to be the beginnings of triathlon, with many three-element multisport events of differing composition appearing, all called by different names. The earliest record for an event was from 1901 in Joinville-le-Pont, Val-de-Marne, it called itself &quot;Les Trois Sports&quot; (The Three Sports). It was advertised as an event for &quot;the sportsmen of the time&quot; and consisted of a run, a bicycle, and a canoe segment. By 19 June 1921, the event in Joinville-le-Pont had become more like a standard triathlon, with the canoe segment being replaced with a swim. According to the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;, the race consisted of a run, a bike ride, and the crossing of the river Marne, all staged consecutively and without a break. Throughout the 1920s, other bike, run, and swim events appeared in different cities, such as the &quot;Course des Trois Sports&quot; in Marseille and &quot;La Course des Débrouillards&quot; in Poissy. These multisport events continued to slowly spread and grow in popularity; by 1934, &quot;Les Trois Sports&quot; was being hosted in the city of La Rochelle, though it consisted of three distinct events, swimming a channel crossing, a bike competition around the harbour of La Rochelle and the parc Laleu, and a run in the stadium André-Barbeau. Throughout this growth with new events appearing, no unified rules ever existed, and as a whole, triathlon remained a minority event on the world stage.

=== Modern beginnings ===

The first modern swim/bike/run event was held at Mission Bay, San Diego, California, on September 25, 1974. The race was conceived and directed by two members of the San Diego Track Club, Jack Johnstone and Don Shanahan. Johnstone recalls that he was a part of the &#x27;70s jogging craze in America and that after entering a few races, he was not regaining his &quot;mediocre fitness&quot; despite having been a member of the 1957 Collegiate and AAU All-American swim teams. Then in 1973, Johnstone learned of the Dave Pain Birthday Biathlon, a run followed by what was billed as a quarter-mile (0.4 km) swim (the actual distance was only between 200 and 300 yards). The following year, after competing in the event for the second time and placing in the top 10, Johnstone desired more of this style of race and with equal emphasis on the swim. So, he petitioned the chairman of the San Diego Track Club, who told him he would add a race to the club calendar. The rest of the race was up to Johnstone to organise, though, and at the same time, he was to contact Don Shanahan, so there would not be too many &quot;weird&quot; races on the club schedule. Shanahan told Johnstone that he wanted to include a biking leg to the race; whilst hesitant, Johnstone agreed to the addition. When naming the event, the pair used the unofficially agreed naming system for multisport events, already used for pentathlon, heptathlon, and decathlon. So, they used the Greek prefix &quot;tri&quot; (three) for the number of events, followed by the already familiar &quot;athlon&quot;, hence naming the event the Mission Bay Triathlon. Neither founder had heard of the French events; both believed their race was a unique idea.

On Wednesday, September 25, 1974, the race started. It began with a run of a loop, followed by biking twice around Fiesta Island for a total of . Entrants would then get off the bikes, take their shoes off, and run into the water to swim to the mainland. That was followed by running in bare feet, then swimming again along the bay, then one last swim up to the entrance of Fiesta Island, and a final crawl up a steep dirt bank to finish. Most participants were not skilled swimmers, so Johnstone recruited his 13-year-old son to float on his surfboard and act as lifeguard. Some participants took longer than expected, and it began to get dark as they finished their swims. Shanahan recalls they pulled up a few cars and turned on the headlights so the athletes could see. Johnstone and Shanahan were surprised by the large number of entrants (46), mainly coming from local running clubs. Two notable entrants, Judy and John Collins, four years later founded the event that brought international attention to the new sport: the Hawaii Ironman.

=== European migration ===
The first European triathlon was held on 30 August 1980 in Plzeň, Czechoslovakia. The Netherlands, Belgium, and West Germany followed, each of them hosting an event in 1981, but media coverage of these events was almost nonexistent.

Then in 1982, event organiser IMG, working in partnership with the American channel CBS (direct competitor of ABC, which held the exclusive rights to Hawaii), created a new event that would take place in Europe. The initial aim was to establish a new premier competition, the European Triathlon, with the goal of being of the same size and prestige to directly compete with that of Hawaii. Originally, the event was to be hosted in Monaco, but with the death of Princess Grace in September 1982, the previous agreements fell through. IMG refused to cancel the event, so it was reorganised to be hosted in Nice, France. The first Nice Triathlon was held on 20 November 1982, where 57 competitors took the start, for an ill-defined competition that consisted of of swimming, of cycling, and running a marathon. In December of that year the national television station France 2 broadcast a program, &quot;Voyage au bout de la souffrance&quot; (&quot;Journey to the End of Suffering&quot;) which detailed the events of the Nice Triathlon. This program introduced the sport to the general public. Some fans of traditional sports strongly criticised this new practice, as seven of the entrants were hospitalised due to the swim, as the temperature of the Mediterranean was only . Despite this criticism, IMG&#x27;s plan succeeded and throughout the 1980s. The Nice Triathlon was, alongside Hawaii, one of the two important long-distance races each year for both prize money and media attention.

The year 1985 had the creation of the first international triathlon structure, the European Triathlon Union (ETU), with the objectives to federate the triathlon structures in each European country and to act as a counterbalance to American triathlon in the creation of a future worldwide federation. The following year, the 11 nations that composed the ETU met in Brussels to standardise the national structures of each European country. During this time, France dominated discussions, as it was the only federation recognised by its own National Olympic Committee. With the legitimacy from CONADET, forerunner of the French Triathlon Federation (FFTri), which has been organising triathlon in France since 1984, the French system became standard all over Europe.

=== A global federation ===
The first attempt to create a global triathlon entity was the Triathlon Federation International (TFI), it had only 22 members, most of which were national European federations. But immediately, fights of influences broke out between the European and UK-American federations over many issues, particularly in view of a favourable vote system for the ETU; this caused immediate fracturing and the TFI never fully establish itself.

Around the same time, Canadian Les McDonald held talks with Juan Antonio Samaranch, then president of the International Olympic Committee. Samaranch had already declared his intention to add triathlon to the Olympic Games as fast as possible, and assured that triathlon could appear as a demonstration sport at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, but only under the auspices of the International Union of Modern Pentathlon and Biathlon (UIPMB). Many within the triathlon community were unhappy with the arrangement, wishing for their own federation not to be held as part of UIPMB. Unable to accept the offer, Samaranch established an Olympic working committee for triathlon in an effort to form a consensus on an Olympic route for the sport. McDonald was selected as president of the committee, while Sweden&#x27;s Sture Jonasson was elected as secretary.

Then in February 1989, an informal meeting was held in Vancouver, Canada, where members of the working committee worked nonstop for a week on the statutes and regulations of the future International Triathlon Union (ITU). Then on 1 April 1989, 30 national federations attended the first ITU Congress in Avignon, France. After further discussions on the way forward to reach the Olympics, including the refusal to follow the path of the UIPMB and how triathlon should develop both economically and as a sport, the Congress endorsed the creation of the ITU and elected its first executive committee. McDonald was elected president. The city of Avignon was also given the honour of hosting the first world championship.

In 1991, the IOC recognized the ITU as the sole governing body for the sport of triathlon at its 97th session in Birmingham, UK. In 1993, the Pan American Games approved triathlon for competition at the 1995 Pan Am Games in Mar del Plata, Argentina. Then in September 1994, triathlon was added to the Olympic program as a medal earning sport at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.

==Organisations==
The International Triathlon Union (now known as World Triathlon) was founded in 1989 as the international governing body of the sport, with the chief goal, at that time, of putting triathlon on the Olympic program. The World Triathlon sanctions and organises the World Triathlon Series and the World Triathlon Cup races each year, with annual world champions crowned each year for elite professional triathletes, junior pro triathletes, and age-group athletes. World Triathlon races are conducted in a draft legal format for the bike leg, whereas drafting is not permitted at the amateur level. In addition, the ITU has a Long-Distance Triathlon series.

The World Triathlon Corporation (WTC) is a private company that sanctions and organises the Ironman and Ironman 70.3 races each year. These races serve as qualifying events for their own annual world championships. The Ironman World Championship is held annually in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, in October, while the Ironman 70.3 World Championship is held in September and changes location each year. The &quot;Ironman&quot; and &quot;Iron&quot; brands are property of the WTC. Therefore, long-distance multisport events organized by groups other than the WTC may not officially be called &quot;Ironman&quot; or &quot;Iron&quot; races. For its part, the ITU does not sanction WTC races; however, USA Triathlon (USAT) uses a combination of World Triathlon and WTC rules to sanction WTC&#x27;s branded events.

Many other organisations exist beginning with local clubs that may host a single small race once per year to companies like the Challenge Family brand that produces long-distance events around the world, which includes events like Challenge Roth. International Ultra-Triathlon Association (IUTA) is the official governing body of Ultratriathlon, which involves triathlon in distances longer than an iron-distance race. Additionally, each nation, generally, has a sanctioning body for triathlon events in their respective country with regard to athletes competing and qualifying for Olympic competition.

The Professional Triathletes Organisation (PTO), an athlete-owned body that represents non-drafting professional triathletes, was launched in 2016. The organisation focuses on promoting the athletes and their performances with high-quality international broadcasts. In 2022 The PTO launched the PTO Tour, the first series of pro-triathlon &#x27;majors&#x27; each with a prize purse of $1M including the PTO Canadian Open, Collins Cup and PTO US Open. A unique aspect of the Professional Triathletes Organization (PTO) is that it is an athlete-owned entity.
=== Conflict ===
Two major rule making bodies, the ITU and WTC, had an overlap of rules and authority, an issue which began to create conflict in the 2000s. This culminated in 2005 when the ITU and USAT asked all national triathlon federations to refuse to continue sanctioning any WTC events. The reasons for this stemmed from WTC not recognising the ITU as the sport&#x27;s governing body as WTC was attempting to set up their own federation. Furthermore, ITU and USAT argued against supporting WTC because they were a profit driven organisation, that it was directly conflicting with ITU titles, such as the long and standard distance world championship, and that the WTC was not following World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) rules. If ITU member nations did not comply with International Olympic Committee (IOC) Charter rules they risked being excluded from the Olympic program. However, in 2006, the ITU backed down on its stance allowing national federations to once again sanction WTC events. This was due to an out-of-court settlement days before a lawsuit was to be argued at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. This settlement had a large effect on WTC races, including WADA membership for the WTC and out-of-competition testing for elite athletes.

Since 2008, coinciding with leadership changes at both the ITU and WTC, the two organisations have been steadily working together. Efforts in 2012 and 2014 resulted in the announcement that Ironman would standardise the rule set for its 2015 races and would start the unification toward ITU rules on long-distance racing with specific interest on the drafting and penalty rules.

In 2017, the ITU and WTC signed a memorandum of understanding in which the two organisations stated they will:

* Harmonise anti-doping efforts
* Fully establish the ITU as the singular international federation for triathlon
* Develop a unified athlete focused rule set for specific distance categories
* Align efforts to foster the growth and development of the sport

==Race formats==
Triathlons longer than full distance are classed as ultra-triathlons.

Triathlons are not necessarily restricted to these prescribed distances. Distances can be any combination of distance set by race organizers to meet various distance constraints or to attract a certain type of athlete.

The standard Olympic distance of 1.5/40/10km (0.93/24.8/6.2miles) was created by longtime triathlon race director Jim Curl in the mid-1980s, after he and partner Carl Thomas produced the U.S. Triathlon Series (USTS) between 1982 and 1997.

Sprint triathlons are the most common triathlon distance in the United States. In 2022, for example, there were 839 USAT sanctioned sprint triathlons, more than all other distances combined.

In addition to the above distances, two new long-distance events have appeared, the 111 and 222 events. The 111 distance is swimming, bicycling and running, totalling . The 222 distance is double that.

Most triathlons are individual events. Another format is relay triathlons, where a team of competitors take turns to compete at a race; each competitor must do a segment of swimming, cycling and running. The World Triathlon Mixed Relay Championships began with two separate classifications for men and women. In 2009, it adopted a 4×4 mixed relay format, where each team has two men and two women. The triathlon at the Youth Olympic Games also has a 4× mixed relay since 2010, and the event was introduced at the 2020 Summer Olympics.

The World Triathlon accepts a 5% margin of error in the cycle and run course distances. Though there can be some variation in race distances, particularly among short triathlons, most triathlons conform to one of those above standards.

==Race organization==
In general, participation in a triathlon requires an athlete to register and sign up in advance of the actual race. After registration, racers are often provided a race number, colored swim cap, and, if the event is being electronically timed, a timing band. Athletes will either be provided or briefed on details of the course, rules, and any problems to look out for (road conditions, closures, traffic lights, aid stations). At a major event, such as an Ironman or a long course championship, triathletes may be required to set up and check-in their bike in the transition area a day or two before the race start, leaving it overnight and under guard.

On the day of the race, before the start of competition, athletes will generally be provided with a bike rack to hold their bicycle and a small section of ground space for shoes, clothing, etc. in the transition area. In some triathlons, there are two transition areas, one for the swim/bike change, then one for the bike/run change at a different location.

Racers are generally categorized into separate professional and amateur categories. Amateurs, who make up the large majority of triathletes, are often referred to as &quot;age groupers&quot; since they are typically further classified by sex and age; which offers the opportunity to compete against others of one&#x27;s own gender and age group. The age groups are defined in five- or ten-year intervals. There is typically a lower age limit; which can vary from race to race. In some triathlons, heavier amateur athletes may have the option to compete against others closer to their own weight since weight is often considered an impediment to speed. As an example, under USA Triathlon rules, &quot;Clydesdale&quot; athletes are those men over , while &quot;Athena&quot; athletes are women over . Other races and organizations can choose whether or not to offer Clydesdale- and Athena-type divisions and set their own weight standards.

Depending on the type and size of the race, there may be any of the following methods implemented to start the race. In a mass start, all athletes enter the water and begin the competition following a single start signal. In wave start events, smaller groups of athletes begin the race every few minutes. An athlete&#x27;s wave is usually determined either by age group or by predicted swim time. Wave starts are more common in shorter races where a large number of amateur athletes are competing. Another option is individual time trial starts, where athletes enter the water one at a time, a few seconds apart.

The swim leg can occur in any available body of water, whether a natural body of water or a swimming pool. Swim legs not occurring in a swimming pool are considered open water swimming where the course typically proceeds around a series of marked buoys before athletes exit the water near the transition area. Racers exit out of the water, enter the transition area, and change from their swim gear and into their cycling gear. Competition and pressure for faster times have led to the development of specialized triathlon clothing that is adequate for both swimming and cycling, allowing many racers to have a transition that consists of only removing their wetsuit, cap, and goggles and pulling on a helmet and cycling shoes. In some cases, racers leave their cycling shoes attached to their bicycle pedals and slip their feet into them while riding. Some triathletes don&#x27;t wear socks, decreasing their time spent in transition even more.

The cycling stage proceeds around a marked course, typically on public roads. In many cases, especially smaller triathlons, roads are not closed to automobiles; however, traffic coordinators are often present to help control traffic. Typically, the cycling stage finishes back at the same transition area. Racers enter the transition area, rack their bicycles, and quickly change into running shoes before heading out for the final stage. The running stage usually ends at a separate finish line near the transition area.

In most races, &quot;aid stations&quot; located on the bike and run courses provide water and energy drinks to the athletes as they pass by. Aid stations at longer events may often provide various types of food as well, including such items as energy bars, energy gels, fruit, cookies, soup, and ice.

Once the triathletes have completed the event, there is typically another aid station for them to get water, fruit, and other post-race refreshments. Occasionally, at the end of larger or longer events, the provided amenities and post-race celebrations may be more elaborate.

==Rules of triathlon==

While specific rules for triathlon can vary depending on the governing body (e.g. World Triathlon, USA Triathlon), as well as for an individual race venue, there are some basic universal rules. Traditionally, triathlon is an individual sport and each athlete is competing against the course and the clock for the best time. As such, athletes are not allowed to receive assistance from anyone else outside the race, with the exception of race-sanctioned aid volunteers who distribute food and water on the course.
Triathlons are timed in five sequential sections:
# from the start of the swim to the beginning of the first transition (swim time);
# from the beginning of the first transition to the end of the first transition (T1 time);
#from the start of the cycling to the end of the cycling leg (cycling time);
# from the beginning of the second transition to the end of the second transition (T2 time);
# finally from the start of the run to the end of the run, at which time the triathlon is completed.

Results are usually posted on official websites and will show for each triathlete his/her swim time; cycle time (with transitions included); run time; and total time. Some races also post transition times separately.

Other rules of triathlon vary from race to race and generally involve descriptions of allowable equipment (for example, wetsuits are allowed in USAT events in the swimming stage of some races when the water temperature is below ), and prohibitions against interference between athletes. Additionally, the use of flippers or other swim propulsion and flotation aids are illegal in triathlon and can result in disqualification.

One rule involving the cycle leg is that the competitor&#x27;s helmet must be donned before the competitor mounts (or even takes possession of, in certain jurisdictions) the bike, and it must remain on until the competitor has dismounted; the competitor may not be required to wear the helmet when not on the bicycle (e.g. while repairing a mechanical problem). Failure to comply with this rule will result in disqualification. Additionally, while on the bike course, all bicycles shall be propelled only by human force and human power. Other than pushing a bicycle, any propulsive action brought on by use of the hands is prohibited. Should a competitor&#x27;s bike malfunction they can proceed with the race as long as they are doing so with their bicycle in tow. There are also strict rules regarding the &#x27;bike mount&#x27; line. Competitors may not begin riding their bicycle out of transition until they are over a clearly marked line. Mounting the bike prior to this may incur a penalty (example: a 15-second time penalty at the London 2012 Olympics was imposed on Jonathan Brownlee, a competitor from Great Britain, for mounting his bike too early.)

Other time penalties can be incurred during the race for, among other things, drafting on the bike in a non-drafting race, improper passing, littering on course, and unsportsmanlike conduct.

==Triathlon and fitness==

Participants in triathlon often use the sport to improve or maintain their physical fitness. With each sport being an endurance event, training for a triathlon provides cardiovascular exercise benefits. Additionally, triathletes encounter fewer injuries than those who only use running as part of their exercise routine due to the incorporation of low impact swim and bike training.

Triathletes spend many hours training for competitions, like other endurance event participants. There are three components that have been researched to improve endurance sports performance; aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, and economy. Injuries that are incurred from long hours of a single activity are not as common in triathlon as they are in single sport events. The cross-training effect that athletes achieve from training for one sport by doing a second activity applies to triathlon training. Additional activities that triathletes perform for cross-training benefits are yoga, pilates, and weight training.

===Swimming===

Triathletes will often use their legs less vigorously and more carefully than other swimmers, conserving their leg muscles for the cycle and run to follow. Many triathletes use altered swim strokes to compensate for turbulent, aerated water and to conserve energy for a long swim. In addition, the majority of triathlons involve open-water (outdoor) swim stages, rather than pools with lane markers. As a result, triathletes in the swim stage must jockey for position, and can gain some advantage by drafting, following a competitor closely to swim in their slipstream. Triathletes will often use &quot;dolphin kicking&quot; and diving to make headway against waves, and body surfing to use a wave&#x27;s energy for a bit of speed at the end of the swim stage. Also, open-water swims necessitate &quot;sighting&quot;: raising the head to look for landmarks or buoys that mark the course. A modified stroke allows the triathlete to lift the head above water to sight without interrupting the swim or wasting energy.

Because open water swim areas are often cold and because wearing a wetsuit provides a competitive advantage, specialized triathlon wetsuits have been developed in a variety of styles to match the conditions of the water. For example, wetsuits that are sleeveless and cut above the knee are designed for warmer waters, while still providing buoyancy. Wetsuits are legal in sanctioned events at which the surface water temperature is or less. In non-sanctioned events or in &quot;age group&quot; classes where most racers are simply participating for the enjoyment of the sport instead of vying for official triathlon placing, wetsuits can often be used at other temperatures. Race directors will sometimes discourage or ban wetsuits if the water temperature is above due to overheating that can occur while wearing a wetsuit. Other rules have been implemented by race organizers regarding both wetsuit thickness as well as the use of &quot;swim skins;&quot; which need to be considered by those participating in future triathlons. Some triathlon sanctioning bodies have placed limits on the thickness of the wetsuit material. Under World Triathlon and some national governing bodies&#x27; rules no wetsuit may have a thickness of more than .

===Cycling===
Triathlon cycling can differ from most professional bicycle racing depending on whether drafting is allowed during competition. In some competitions, like those governed by USA Triathlon and the World Triathlon Corporation, drafting is not allowed, and thus the cycling portion more closely resembles individual time trial racing. In other races, such as those in the World Triathlon Series and World Triathlon Cup racing, drafting and the formation of pelotons are legal. This places an emphasis on running performance as several athletes will enter the bike to run transition at the same time due to drafting.

Triathlon bicycles are generally optimized for aerodynamics, having special handlebars called aero-bars or tri-bars, aerodynamic wheels, and other components. Triathlon bikes use a specialized geometry, including a steep seat-tube angle both to improve aerodynamics and to spare muscle groups needed for running. At the end of the bike segment, triathletes also often cycle with a higher cadence (revolutions per minute), which serves in part to keep the muscles loose and flexible for running.

===Running===

The primary distinguishing feature of running in a triathlon is that it occurs after the athlete has already been exercising in two other disciplines for an extended period of time, so many muscles are already tired. The effect of switching from cycling to running can be profound; first-time triathletes are often astonished at their muscle weakness, which may be caused by lactate accumulation and the bizarre, sometimes painful sensation in their thighs a few hundred yards into the run, and discover that they run at a much slower pace than they are accustomed to in training. Triathletes train for this phenomenon through transition workouts known as &quot;bricks&quot;: back-to-back workouts involving two disciplines, most commonly cycling and running.

===Transition===
The change over from sport to sport takes place in a designated transition area. The transition provides a staging area where bicycles, running shoes, hydration and other gear is set up ready to be used during the course of the event. The first transition, known as &quot;T1&quot;, is between the swimming and bicycle segments of the race. The second transition, &quot;T2&quot;, is between the bicycle and running segments. Most events have one common transition area for both T1 and T2, while some point to point events have two separate transition areas. The time spent in transition is a timed segment and contributes towards the overall finishing time of the event. Races can hinge on transition skills, either by gaining or losing time in transition itself, or because of time penalties taken for faulty changeovers. As such, transition is commonly described during races as the &#x27;fourth discipline.&#x27;

<text>The Germs were an American punk rock band from Los Angeles, California, originally active from 1976 to 1980. The band&#x27;s &quot;classic&quot; lineup consisted of singer Darby Crash, guitarist Pat Smear, bassist Lorna Doom and drummer Don Bolles. They released only one album, 1979&#x27;s &quot;(GI)&quot;, produced by Joan Jett, and were featured in Penelope Spheeris&#x27; seminal documentary film &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot;, which chronicled the Los Angeles punk movement. The Germs disbanded following Crash&#x27;s suicide in 1980. Their music was influential to many later rock acts, and Smear went on to achieve greater fame performing with Nirvana and Foo Fighters.

In 2005, actor Shane West was cast to play Crash in the biographical film &quot;What We Do Is Secret&quot;. He performed with Smear, Doom, and Bolles at the film&#x27;s wrap party, and afterwards, the Germs reunited with West as their new frontman. This lineup of the band toured worldwide, which included performances at the 2006 and 2008 Warped Tours.

==History==
===Formation===

Crash (born Jan Paul Beahm) and Smear (born Georg Ruthenberg) decided to start a band after being kicked out of University High School for antisocial behavior, allegedly for using &quot;mind control&quot; on fellow students. Their original name was &quot;Sophistifuck and the Revlon Spam Queens&quot;, but they had to shorten the name as they could not afford that many letters on a T-shirt. The (initially hypothetical) first line-up consisted of Beahm (then known as Bobby Pyn, and later as Darby Crash) on vocals, Ruthenberg (under the name Pat Smear) on guitar, an early member named &quot;Dinky&quot; (Diana Grant) on bass, and Michelle Baer playing drums. This line-up never played in front of a live audience.

In April 1976, the band added Lorna Doom (born Teresa Ryan) on bass, with transitional member Dottie Danger (later famous as Belinda Carlisle of the Go-Go&#x27;s) on drums. Carlisle never actually played with the band, as she was sidelined by a bout of mononucleosis for an extended period. She was replaced by her friend Donna Rhia (Becky Barton), who played three gigs and performed on their first single. Carlisle remained a friend and helper of the band (she can be heard introducing the band on the &quot;Germicide: Live at the Whiskey&quot; recording, produced by Kim Fowley), only leaving because her new band, the Go-Go&#x27;s, were becoming popular and, as she put it, &quot;I was really disturbed by the heroin that was going on&quot;. Nickey Beat, of various noteworthy Los Angeles bands including the Weirdos, also sat in on drums for a time.

The band&#x27;s first live performance was at the Orpheum Theater, a 99-seat venue on the Sunset Strip in then-unincorporated area West Hollywood, California (later the location of Book Soup). Smear recalled: &quot;We made noise. Darby stuck the mic in a jar of peanut butter. It was a dare, we had no songs or anything! Lorna wore her pants inside out, and Darby covered himself in red licorice... we made noise for five minutes until they threw us off&quot;.

The Germs initially drew musical influences from Iggy Pop, David Bowie, Ramones, the Runaways, Sex Pistols, and New York Dolls. Early on, Smear was the only musically experienced member; Doom survived early performances by sliding a finger up and down the fretboard of her bass while Rhia generally kept a minimal beat on the bass drum, periodically bashing a cymbal.

Early performances were usually marked by raucous crowds made up of the band&#x27;s friends. As a result, their gigs became notorious for being rowdy and usually verged on a riot.

===Recordings===
The first single, &quot;Forming&quot;, was recorded on a Sony two-track reel-to-reel recorder in Smear&#x27;s family garage, and arrived back from the pressing plant with a note warning &quot;this record may cause ear cancer&quot; printed on the sleeve. much to the band&#x27;s displeasure. It was released in July 1977 on the What? label. The single featured a shambolic but serviceable performance on the A-side and a muddy live recording of &quot;Sexboy&quot; on the B-side, recorded at the Roxy for the Cheech and Chong movie, &quot;Up in Smoke&quot;. The song was not used in the movie, nor was the band. They were the only band not to receive a call-back to perform live for the film&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; sequence, perhaps due to the fact that the Germs&#x27; chaotic Roxy performance had featured an unscripted, full-on food fight.

The Germs, despite most expectations, developed a sound that was highly influential. Throughout their career, they had a reputation as a chaotic live band. Crash often arrived onstage nearly incoherent from drugs, singing everywhere but into the microphone and taunting the audience between songs, yet nevertheless, delivered intense theatrical and increasingly musical performances. The other band members prided themselves on similar problems, with many contemporary reviews citing collapses, incoherence and drunken vomiting onstage. Fans saw this as part of the show, and indeed, the band presented it as such, even when breaking bottles and rolling in the glass, with the music coming and going.

Smear was revealed to be a remarkably talented and fluid player; much later, after Crash&#x27;s death, critics finally acknowledged his lyrics as poetic art. Crash&#x27;s vocals had begun to mold themselves around the style of the Screamers&#x27; vocalist Tomata DuPlenty. Another strong influence on the band&#x27;s final sound was Zolar X, a theatrical glam rock band popular in the Los Angeles area c. 1972–1980. Crash and Smear were enthusiastic fans of the band from the pre-Germs days, and the fast tempos and raw guitar tone of (the historically pre-punk) Zolar X were similar to the sound achieved on later Germs recordings.

The Germs recorded two singles (with alternate tracks), an album-length demo session, and one full-length LP, &quot;(GI)&quot;, each more focused and powerful than the last. Crash was, despite his erratic behavior, generally regarded as a brilliant lyricist (a contemporary critic described him as &quot;ransacking the dictionary&quot;), and the final line-up of Smear, Doom and Bolles had become a world-class rock ensemble by the recording of &quot;(GI)&quot;, turning in a performance that spurred an &quot;LA Weekly&quot; reviewer to write, &quot;This album leaves exit wounds&quot;. It is considered one of the first hardcore punk records, and has a near-mythic status among punk rock fans. The album was produced by Joan Jett of the Runaways. Some European copies of the album also credited Donny Rose on keyboards (the song &quot;Shut Down&quot; was recorded live in the studio and featured melodic, two-fisted piano).
The Germs were featured in Spheeris&#x27;s documentary film &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot; along with X, Black Flag, Fear, Circle Jerks, Alice Bag Band, and Catholic Discipline.

Following the release of their only studio album, &quot;(GI)&quot;, on Slash Records, the Germs recorded six original songs with producer Jack Nitzsche for the soundtrack to the film, &quot;Cruising&quot;, starring Al Pacino. Doom wrote one of the songs. Only one of these songs, &quot;Lions Share&quot;, ended up on the Columbia soundtrack album. It was featured for approximately one minute in the movie, during a video-booth murder scene in an S&amp;M club. Other songs from this session did not appear until the 1988 bootleg &quot;Lion&#x27;s Share&quot;, along with four tracks from their infamous last show at the Starwood. The &quot;Cruising&quot; sessions were finally released officially on the CD &quot;(MIA): The Complete Anthology&quot;.

===Dissolution and suicide of Crash===
The end of the band came when Crash, who had become increasingly impatient with drummer Bolles&#x27; antics, fired him and replaced him with his friend and lover Rob Henley, a fellow heroin addict.

Shortly after the Germs split, Crash and Smear formed the short-lived Darby Crash Band. Circle Jerks drummer Lucky Lehrer joined the band on the eve of their first (sold-out) live performance when, during a soundcheck, Darby kicked out the drummer they had rehearsed with. The band, described by Smear as &quot;like the Germs, but with worse players&quot;, played only a few gigs to lukewarm reaction before splitting up.

Shortly after that, Crash contacted Smear about a Germs &quot;reunion&quot; show, claiming it was necessary to &quot;put punk into perspective&quot; for the punks on the scene. However, Smear has said Crash told him privately he wanted to earn money for heroin with which to commit suicide. Since Crash had described this scenario many times in the past, Smear did not take him seriously.

On December 3, 1980, an over-sold Starwood hosted a final live show of the reunited Germs, including Bolles. At one point, Crash told the amazed kids in the audience, &quot;We did this show so you new people could see what it was like when we were around. You&#x27;re not going to see it again&quot;. Rhino Handmade officially released this live set, previously unavailable in its entirety, as &quot;Live at the Starwood Dec. 3, 1980&quot; on June 14, 2010. Along with the CD, the release includes an 8½&quot; × 11&quot; replica of the original poster for the show, a reproduction of the handwritten set list and a four-page fanzine with photos and liner notes by Jonathan Gold.

Crash committed suicide on December 7, 1980, at age 22. Unreported at the time, Crash had overdosed on heroin in a suicide pact with close friend Casey &quot;Cola&quot; Hopkins, who ended up surviving. She later insisted that he did not intend for her to live, nor did he change his mind at the last minute and intend for himself to live. According to &quot;Spin&quot;, apocryphal lore has Crash attempting to write &quot;Here lies Darby Crash&quot; on the wall as he lay dying, but not finishing. In reality, he wrote a short note to David &quot;Bosco&quot; Davenport that stated, &quot;My life, my leather, my love goes to Bosco&quot;.

Outside the world of the Germs&#x27; fans, news of Crash&#x27;s death was largely overshadowed by the murder of John Lennon the next day. A local news station mistakenly reported that Crash had died from taking too many sleeping pills.

===Aftermath===
After the Germs ended, Bolles played with several other L.A. bands, including Nervous Gender, 45 Grave, Celebrity Skin, and Ariel Pink. In fall 2009, Bolles joined the cast of punks, mods and rockers web series &quot;Oblivion&quot;.

In 1993, Slash released &quot;(MIA): The Complete Anthology&quot;, with liner notes by Pleasant Gehman.

Smear went on to play with Nirvana during their last year and, after the death of Kurt Cobain, with Mike Watt, and then Foo Fighters.

In 1996, a tribute album titled &quot;A Small Circle of Friends&quot; was released, that featured tracks by Watt, Free Kitten, Melvins, Meat Puppets, that dog., L7, the Posies, NOFX, Flea, Gumball and others, along with a version of &quot;Circle One&quot; performed by Smear with Hole under the name &quot;the Holez&quot;.

===&quot;What We Do Is Secret&quot;, reformations and Doom&#x27;s death (2005–present)===

A film about the Germs, &quot;What We Do Is Secret&quot;, was in production for several years, and premiered June 23, 2007, at the Los Angeles Film Festival. The film was theatrically released on August 8, 2008, and starred Shane West in the role of Darby Crash.

Smear, Doom, and Bolles reactivated the Germs with West as singer. They played on the 2006 Warped Tour and toured clubs in the US later that summer, and again in 2007. They once again played on the 2008 edition of the Warped Tour, on the Vans Old School Stage. Some members of the punk rock community such as Fat Mike and Jello Biafra were critical of the band&#x27;s decision to perform with West.

In a July 2009 article, Bolles spoke about the band&#x27;s plans to re-record old material for a planned box set titled &quot;Lest We Forget: The Sounds of the Germs&quot;. The band rearranged songs from the &quot;Germicide&quot; live album and the &quot;Cruising&quot; sessions; they planned to record several Darby Crash Band songs as well. Live recordings, both old and new, would have made up the rest of the box set, which Bolles hoped to release in 2010. The newly recorded songs were to be released on Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan&#x27;s new, unnamed record label. Two songs, &quot;Out of Time&quot; and &quot;Beyond Hurt – Beyond Help&quot;, were originally written by Crash and Smear prior to Crash&#x27;s death, but were never recorded. The songs were to be recorded with West providing vocals. West left the Germs in 2009.

In December 2013, Charlotte Caffey of the Go-Go&#x27;s played bass for a one-off gig, a memorial for Bill &quot;Pat Fear&quot; Bartell, when Doom could not be located.

On January 16, 2019, Doom died of breast cancer.
