<text>Sulawesi ( ), also known as Celebes ( ), is an island in Indonesia. One of the four Greater Sunda Islands, and the world&#x27;s 11th-largest island, it is situated east of Borneo, west of the Maluku Islands, and south of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago. Within Indonesia, only Sumatra, Borneo, and Papua are larger in territory, and only Java and Sumatra are more populous.

The landmass of Sulawesi includes four peninsulas: the northern Minahasa Peninsula, the East Peninsula, the South Peninsula, and the Southeast Peninsula. Three gulfs separate these peninsulas: the Gulf of Tomini between the northern Minahasa and East peninsulas, the Tolo Gulf between the East and Southeast peninsulas, and the Bone Gulf between the South and Southeast peninsulas. The Strait of Makassar runs along the western side of the island and separates the island from Borneo.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Sulawesi&quot; possibly comes from the words &quot;sula&quot; (&quot;island&quot;) and &quot;besi&quot; (&quot;iron&quot;) and may refer to the historical export of iron from the rich Lake Matano iron deposits. The name came into common use in English following Indonesian independence.

The name &quot;Celebes&quot; was originally given to the island by Portuguese explorers. While its direct translation is unclear, it might be considered a Portuguese rendering of the native name &quot;Sulawesi&quot;.

==Geography==
Sulawesi is the world&#x27;s eleventh-largest island, covering an area of (including minor islands administered as part of Sulawesi). The central part of the island is ruggedly mountainous, such that the island&#x27;s peninsulas have traditionally been remote from each other, with better connections by sea than by road. The three bays that divide Sulawesi&#x27;s peninsulas are, from north to south, the Tomini, the Tolo and the Boni. These separate the Minahasa or Northern Peninsula, the East Peninsula, the Southeast Peninsula and the South Peninsula.

The Strait of Makassar runs along the western side of the island. The island is surrounded by Borneo to the west, by the Philippines to the north, by Maluku to the east, and by Flores and Timor to the south.

=== Minor islands===
The Selayar Islands make up a peninsula stretching southwards from Southwest Sulawesi into the Flores Sea are administratively part of Sulawesi. The Sangihe Islands and Talaud Islands stretch northward from the northeastern tip of Sulawesi, while Buton and Muna Islands and their neighbors lie off its southeast peninsula, the Togian Islands are in the Gulf of Tomini, and Peleng Island and the Banggai Islands form a cluster between Sulawesi and Maluku. All the above-mentioned islands and many smaller ones off the coasts of Sulawesi are administratively part of Sulawesi&#x27;s six provinces.

==Geology==
The island slopes up from the shores of the deep seas surrounding the island to a high, mostly non-volcanic, mountainous interior. Active volcanoes are found in the northern Minahasa Peninsula, stretching north to the Sangihe Islands. The northern peninsula contains several active volcanoes such as Mount Lokon, Mount Awu, Soputan and Karangetang.

According to plate reconstructions, the island is believed to have been formed by the collision of terranes from the Asian Plate (forming the west and southwest) and from the Australian Plate (forming the southeast and Banggai), with island arcs previously in the Pacific (forming the north and east peninsulas). Because of its several tectonic origins, various faults scar the land and as a result the island is prone to earthquakes, including the deadly 2018 and 2021 quakes.

Off the eastern coast of Sulawesi, the North Banda Sea was created through subduction rollback during the early Miocene. Evidence for this tectonic event lies with the extensive interconnected fault network found in the area, a volcanic seamount with its surrounding ridges, and an accretionary wedge. Off the coast of east Selawesti and Banggai is an accumulation of carbonate rocks from the late Miocene. These carbonates are likely pinnacle reefs and the carbonate platform  has a total thickness of around 180–770 meters.

Sulawesi, in contrast to most of the other islands in the biogeographical region of Wallacea, is not truly oceanic, but a composite island at the centre of the Asia-Australia collision zone. Parts of the island were formerly attached to either the Asian or Australian continental margin and became separated from these areas by vicariant processes. In the west, the opening of the Makassar Strait separated West Sulawesi from Sundaland in the Eocene c. 45 Mya. In the east, the traditional view of collisions of multiple micro-continental fragments sliced from New Guinea with an active volcanic margin in West Sulawesi at different times since the Early Miocene c. 20 Mya has recently been replaced by the hypothesis that extensional fragmentation has followed a single Miocene collision of West Sulawesi with the Sula Spur, the western end of an ancient folded belt of Variscan origin in the Late Paleozoic.

=== Bone Basin ===
The Bone Basin lies between the eastern and western arms of Sulawesi. According to recent studies, the basin has been opened up due to extensional forces. The basin is bounded by normal faults on each side of the basin. Each side of the basin is surrounded by uplifted basement rock with young sediments found in the middle. The past geological history has allowed for a large accumulation of carbonates which could lead to a higher potential of oil and gas occurrences. However, the faults present in the basin makes it a very complicated system.

== Prehistory ==

The oldest evidence for humans on Sulawesi are stone tools produced by archaic humans, dating from over 200,000 to 100,000 years ago, that were found at the Talepu site in southwestern Sulawesi.

Before October 2014, the settlement of South Sulawesi by modern humans had been dated to 30,000 BC on the basis of radiocarbon dates obtained from rock shelters in Maros. No earlier evidence of human occupation had at that point been found, but the island almost certainly formed part of the land bridge used for the settlement of Australia and New Guinea by at least 40,000 BC. There is no evidence of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; having reached Sulawesi; crude stone tools first discovered in 1947 on the right bank of the Walanae River at Barru (now part of Bone Regency), which were thought to date to the Pleistocene on the basis of their association with vertebrate fossils, are now thought to date to perhaps 50,000 BC.
Following Peter Bellwood&#x27;s model of a southward migration of Austronesian-speaking farmers (AN), radiocarbon dates from caves in Maros suggest a date in the mid-second millennium BC for the arrival of a group from east Borneo speaking a Proto-South Sulawesi language (PSS). Initial settlement was probably around the mouth of the Sa&#x27;dan river, on the northwest coast of the peninsula, although the south coast has also been suggested.

Subsequent migrations across the mountainous landscape resulted in the geographical isolation of PSS speakers and the evolution of their languages into the eight families of the South Sulawesi language group. If each group can be said to have a homeland, that of the Bugis – today the most numerous group – was around lakes Témpé and Sidénréng in the Walennaé depression. Here for some 2,000 years lived the linguistic group that would become the modern Bugis; the archaic name of this group (which is preserved in other local languages) was Ugiq. Despite the fact that today they are closely linked with the Makassarese, the closest linguistic neighbors of the Bugis are the Torajans.
Pre-1200 Bugis society was most likely organized into chiefdoms. Some anthropologists have speculated these chiefdoms would have warred and, in times of peace, interbred. Further, they have speculated that personal security would have been negligible and head-hunting an established cultural practice. The political economy would have been a mixture of hunting and gathering and swidden or shifting agriculture. Speculative planting of wet rice may have taken place along the margins of the lakes and rivers.

In Central Sulawesi, there are more than 400 granite megaliths, which various archaeological studies have dated to be from 3000 BC to AD 1300. They vary in size from a few centimeters to approximately . The original purpose of the megaliths is unknown. Approximately 30 of the megaliths represent human forms. Other megaliths are in form of large pots (&quot;Kalamba&quot;) and stone plates (&quot;Tutu&#x27;na&quot;).

A burial of a woman associated with the hunter-gatherer Toalean culture dating to 7,000 years ago has yielded DNA that has provided rare insight into early migrations in and through the region.

===Cave art===
In October 2014, it was announced that cave paintings in Maros had been dated as being approximately 40,000 years old. One of a hand was 39,900 years old, which brings it among the oldest known hand stencils in the world (the record is detained so far by a 64,000 years-old stencil hand made by a Neanderthal in Maltravieso cave, Cáceres, Spain).

Dr. Maxime Aubert, of Griffith University in Queensland, Australia, said that was the minimum age for the outline in Pettakere Cave in Maros, and added: &quot;Next to it is a pig that has a minimum age of 35,400 years old, and this is one of the oldest figurative depictions in the world, if not the oldest one.&quot;

On 11 December 2019, a team of researchers led by Dr. Maxime Aubert announced the discovery of the oldest hunting scenes in prehistoric art in the world that is more than 44,000 years old from the limestone cave of Leang Bulu&#x27; Sipong 4. Archaeologists determined the age of the depiction of hunting a pig and buffalo thanks to the calcite &#x27;popcorn&#x27;, different isotope levels of radioactive uranium and thorium.

In March 2020, two small stone &#x27;plaquettes&#x27; were found by Griffith University archaeologists in the Leang Bulu Bettue cave, dated to a time between 26,000 and 14,000 years ago. While one of the stones contained an anoa (water buffalo) and what may be a flower, star, or eye, another depicted astronomic rays of light.
In January 2021, archaeologists announced the discovery of cave art that is at least 45,500 years old in a Leang Tedongnge cave. According to the journal &quot;Science Advances&quot;, the cave painting of a warty pig is the earliest evidence of human settlement of the region. An adult male pig, measuring 136 cm x 54 cm and what is likely a Sulawesi or Celebes warty pig (Sus celebensis), was depicted with horn-like facial warts and two hand prints above its hindquarters. According to co-author Adam Brumm, there are two other pigs that are partly preserved and it appears the warty pig was observing a fight between the two other pigs.

==History==

A bronze Amaravathi statue was discovered at Sikendeng, South Sulawesi near Karama river in 1921 which was dated to 2nd–7th century AD by Bosch (1933). In 1975, small locally made Buddhist statues from 10th-11th century were also discovered in Bontoharu, on the island of Selayar, South Sulawesi.

Starting in the 13th century, access to prestige trade goods and to sources of iron started to alter long-standing cultural patterns and to permit ambitious individuals to build larger political units. It is not known why these two ingredients appeared together; one was perhaps the product of the other.

In 1367, several identified polities located on the island were mentioned in the Javanese manuscript Nagarakretagama dated from the Majapahit period. Canto 14 mentioned polities including Gowa, Makassar, Luwu and Banggai. It seems that by the 14th century, polities in the island were connected in an archipelagic maritime trading network, centered in the Majapahit port in East Java. By 1400, a number of nascent agricultural principalities had arisen in the western Cenrana valley, as well as on the south coast and on the west coast near modern Parepare.

The first Europeans to visit the island (which they believed to be an archipelago due to its contorted shape) were the Portuguese sailors Simão de Abreu in 1523, and Gomes de Sequeira (among others) in 1525, sent from the Moluccas in search of gold, which the islands had the reputation of producing. A Portuguese base was installed in Makassar in the first decades of the 16th century, lasting until 1665, when it was taken by the Dutch. The Dutch had arrived in Sulawesi in 1605 and were quickly followed by the English, who established a factory in Makassar. From 1660, the Dutch were at war with Gowa, the major Makassar west coast power. In 1669, Admiral Speelman forced the ruler, Sultan Hasanuddin, to sign the Treaty of Bongaya, which handed control of trade to the Dutch East India Company. The Dutch were aided in their conquest by the Bugis warlord Arung Palakka, ruler of the Bugis kingdom of Bone. The Dutch built a fort at Ujung Pandang, while Arung Palakka became the regional overlord and Bone the dominant kingdom. Political and cultural development seems to have slowed as a result of the status quo.

In 1905, the entire island became part of the Dutch state colony of the Netherlands East Indies until Japanese occupation in the Second World War. During the Indonesian National Revolution, the Dutch Captain &#x27;Turk&#x27; Westerling led campaigns in which hundreds, maybe thousands died during the South Sulawesi Campaign. Following the transfer of sovereignty in December 1949, Sulawesi became part of the federal United States of Indonesia, which in 1950 became absorbed into the unitary Republic of Indonesia.

===Central Sulawesi===
The Portuguese were rumoured to have a fort in Parigi in 1555. The Kaili were an important group based in the Palu valley and related to the Toraja. Scholars relate that their control swayed under Ternate and Makassar, but this might have been a decision by the Dutch to give their vassals a chance to govern a difficult group. Padbruge commented that in the 1700s the Kaili population was significantly high and were a highly militant society. In the 1850s, a civil war erupted between the Kaili groups, including the Banawa, in which the Dutch colonial government decided to intervene.

In the late 19th century, the Sarasins journeyed through the Palu valley as part of a major initiative to bring the Kaili under Dutch rule. Some very surprising and interesting photographs were taken of shamans called Tadulako. Further Christian religious missions entered the area to make one of the most detailed ethnographic studies in the early 20th century. A Swede by the name of Walter Kaudern later studied much of the literature and produced a synthesis. Erskine Downs in the 1950s produced a summary of Kruyts and Andrianis work: &quot;The religion of the Bare&#x27;e-Speaking Toradja of Central Celebes,&quot; which is invaluable for English-speaking researchers. One of the most recent publications is &quot;When the bones are left,&quot; a study of the material culture of central Sulawesi, offering extensive analysis. Also worthy of study are the brilliant works of Monnig Atkinson on the Wana shamans who live in the Mori area.

==Population==

At the 2000 census, the population of the provinces of Sulawesi was 14,946,488, about 7.25% of Indonesia&#x27;s total population. By the 2010 Census, the total had reached 17,371,782, and the 2020 Census recorded a total of 19,896,951. The official estimate for mid-2023 was 20,568,411. The largest city on Sulawesi is Makassar.

===Religion===

Islam is the majority religion in Sulawesi. The conversion of the lowlands of the south western peninsula (South Sulawesi) to Islam occurred in the early 17th century. The kingdom of Luwu in the Gulf of Bone was the first to embrace Islam in February 1605; the Makassar kingdom of Gowa-Talloq, centred on the modern-day city of Makassar, followed suit in September. However, the Gorontalo and the Mongondow peoples of the northern peninsula largely converted to Islam only in the 19th century. Most Muslims are Sunnis.

Christians form a substantial minority on the island. According to the demographer Toby Alice Volkman, 17% of Sulawesi&#x27;s population is Protestant and less than 2% is Catholic. Christians are concentrated on the tip of the northern peninsula around the city of Manado, which is inhabited by the Minahasa, a predominantly Protestant people, and the northernmost Sangir and Talaud Islands. The Toraja people of Tana Toraja in South Sulawesi have largely converted to Christianity since Indonesia&#x27;s independence. There are also substantial numbers of Christians around Lake Poso in Central Sulawesi, among the Pamona speaking peoples of Central Sulawesi, and near Mamasa.

Though most people identify themselves as Muslims or Christians, they often subscribe to local beliefs and deities as well.

Smaller communities of Buddhists and Hindus are also found on Sulawesi, usually among the Chinese, Balinese, and Indian communities.

===Languages===
== Economy ==

The economy of Sulawesi is heavily centered around agriculture, fishing, mining, and forestry.

==Administration==
The island was administered as one province between 1945 and 1960. In 1960 it was divided into two provinces – North and Central Sulawesi, and South and Southeast Sulawesi. In 1964 both of these were again divided, the former into North Sulawesi and Central Sulawesi, and the latter into South Sulawesi and Southeast Sulawesi. Today, it is subdivided into six provinces: Gorontalo, West Sulawesi, South Sulawesi, Central Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, and North Sulawesi. Among these, the newest provinces are Gorontalo, established in 2000 from part of North Sulawesi, and West Sulawesi, established in 2004 from part of South Sulawesi.

The largest cities on the island are the provincial capitals of Makassar, Manado, Palu, Kendari, and Gorontalo (the provincial capital of West Sulawesi – the town of Mamuju – is not a city); there are six other cities – Bitung, Palopo, Bau-Bau, Parepare, Kotamobagu and Tomohun.



==Flora and fauna==
Sulawesi is part of Wallacea, meaning that it has a mix of both Indomalayan and Australasian species that reached the island by crossing deep-water oceanic barriers. The flora includes one native eucalypt, &quot;E. deglupta&quot;. There are 8 national parks on the island, of which 4 are mostly marine. The parks with the largest terrestrial area are Bogani Nani Wartabone with 2,871 km2 and Lore Lindu National Park with 2,290 km2. Bunaken National Park, which protects a rich coral ecosystem, has been proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The coast of northern tip of Sulawesi is identified as a site of highest marine biodiversity importance in the Coral Triangle.
===Mammals===
Early in the Pleistocene, Sulawesi had a dwarf elephant and a dwarf form of &quot;Stegodon&quot;, (an elephant relative, &quot;S. sompoensis&quot;); later both were replaced by larger forms. A giant suid, &quot;Celebochoerus&quot;, was also formerly present. It is thought that many of the migrants to Sulawesi arrived via the Philippines, while Sulawesi in turn served as a way station for migrants to Flores. A Pleistocene faunal turnover is recognized, with the competitive displacement of several indigenous tarsiers by more recently arriving ones and of &quot;Celebochoerus&quot; by other medium-sized herbivores like the babirusa, anoa and Celebes warty pig.
There are 127 known extant native mammalian species in Sulawesi. A large percentage, 62% (79 species) are endemic, meaning that they are found nowhere else in the world. The largest of these are the two species of anoa or dwarf buffalo. Other artiodactyl species inhabiting Sulawesi are the warty pig and the babirusas, which are aberrant pigs. The only native carnivoran is the Sulawesi palm civet (Asian palm and Malayan civets have been introduced). Primates present include a number of nocturnal tarsiers (&quot;T. fuscus&quot;, Dian&#x27;s, Gursky&#x27;s, Jatna&#x27;s, Wallace&#x27;s, the Lariang and pygmy tarsiers) as well as diurnal macaques (Heck&#x27;s, the booted, crested black, Gorontalo, moor, and Tonkean macaques). While most of Sulawesi&#x27;s mammals are placental and have Asian relatives, several species of cuscus, arboreal marsupials of Australasian origin, are also present (&quot;Ailurops ursinus&quot; and &quot;Strigocuscus celebensis&quot;, which are diurnal and nocturnal, respectively).

Sulawesi is home to a large number of endemic rodent genera. Murid rodent genera endemic to Sulawesi and immediately adjacent islands (such as the Togian Islands, Buton Island, and Muna Island) are &quot;Bunomys&quot;, &quot;Echiothrix&quot;, &quot;Margaretamys&quot;, &quot;Taeromys&quot; and &quot;Tateomys&quot; as well as the single-species genera &quot;Eropeplus&quot;, &quot;Hyorhinomys&quot;, &quot;Melasmothrix&quot;, &quot;Paucidentomys&quot;, &quot;Paruromys&quot;, &quot;Sommeromys&quot; and the semiaquatic &quot;Waiomys&quot;. All nine sciurids are from three endemic genera, &quot;Hyosciurus&quot;, &quot;Prosciurillus&quot; and &quot;Rubrisciurus&quot;.

While over 20 bat species are present on Sulawesi, only a portion of these are endemic: &quot;Rhinolophus tatar&quot;, &quot;Scotophilus celebensis&quot; and the megabats &quot;Acerodon celebensis&quot;, &quot;Boneia bidens&quot;, &quot;Dobsonia exoleta&quot;, &quot;Harpyionycteris celebensis&quot;, &quot;Neopteryx frosti&quot;, &quot;Rousettus celebensis&quot; and &quot;Styloctenium wallacei&quot;.

Several endemic shrews, the Sulawesi shrew, Sulawesi tiny shrew and the Sulawesi white-handed shrew, are found on the island.

Sulawesi has no gliding mammals, being situated between Borneo with its colugos and flying squirrels, and Halmahera with its sugar gliders.

===Birds===

By contrast, Sulawesian bird species tend to be found on other nearby islands as well, such as Borneo; 31% of Sulawesi&#x27;s birds are found nowhere else. One endemic (also found on small neighboring islands) is the largely ground-dwelling, chicken-sized maleo, a megapode which sometimes uses hot sand close to the island&#x27;s volcanic vents to incubate its eggs. An international partnership of conservationists, donors, and local people have formed the Alliance for Tompotika Conservation, in an effort to raise awareness and protect the nesting grounds of these birds on the central-eastern arm of the island. Other endemic birds include the flightless snoring rail, the fiery-browed starling, the Sulawesi masked owl, the Sulawesi myna, the satanic nightjar and the grosbeak starling. There are around 350 known bird species in Sulawesi.

===Reptiles===
The larger reptiles of Sulawesi are not endemic and include reticulated and Burmese pythons, the Pacific ground boa, king cobras, water monitors, sailfin lizards, saltwater crocodiles and green sea turtles. An extinct giant tortoise, &quot;Megalochelys atlas&quot;, was formerly present, but disappeared by 840,000 years ago, possibly because of the arrival of Homo erectus. Similarly, komodo dragons or similar lizards appear to have inhabited the island, being among its apex predators. The smaller snakes of Sulawesi include nonendemic forms such as the gliding species &quot;Chrysopelea paradisi&quot; and endemic forms such as &quot;Calamaria boesemani&quot;, &quot;Calamaria muelleri&quot;, &quot;Calamaria nuchalis&quot;, &quot;Cyclotyphlops&quot;, &quot;Enhydris matannensis&quot;, &quot;Ptyas dipsas&quot;, &quot;Rabdion grovesi&quot;, &quot;Tropidolaemus laticinctus&quot; and &quot;Typhlops conradi&quot;. Similarly, the smaller lizards of Sulawesi include nonendemic species such as &quot;Bronchocela jubata&quot;, &quot;Dibamus novaeguineae&quot; and &quot;Gekko smithii&quot;, as well as endemic species such as &quot;Lipinia infralineolata&quot; and &quot;Gekko iskandari&quot;.

Sulawesi also harbours several species of freshwater chelonians, two of which are endemic. They include the Forsten&#x27;s tortoise and the Sulawesi forest turtle, both of which likely attribute their respective origins to the dispersal of the mainland Asian elongated tortoise and Malayan flat-shelled turtle from the then-exposed subcontinent of Sundaland during the Pleistocene epoch.

The remaining two species consist of the non-endemic Malayan box turtle of the Wallacean subspecies, and the Asiatic softshell turtle.

===Amphibians===
The amphibians of Sulawesi include the endemic frogs &quot;Hylarana celebensis&quot;, &quot;H. macrops&quot;, &quot;H. mocquardi&quot;, &quot;Ingerophrynus celebensis&quot;, &quot;Limnonectes arathooni&quot;, &quot;L. larvaepartus&quot;, &quot;L. microtympanum&quot;, &quot;Occidozyga celebensis&quot;, &quot;O. semipalmata&quot; and &quot;O. tompotika&quot; as well as the endemic &quot;flying frogs&quot; &quot;Rhacophorus edentulus&quot; and &quot;R. georgii&quot;.

===Freshwater fish===
Sulawesi is home to more than 70 freshwater fish species, including more than 55 endemics. Among these are the genus &quot;Nomorhamphus&quot;, a species flock of viviparous halfbeaks containing 12 species that only are found on Sulawesi (others are from the Philippines). In addition to &quot;Nomorhamphus&quot;, the majority of Sulawesi&#x27;s freshwater fish species are ricefishes, gobies (&quot;Glossogobius&quot; and &quot;Mugilogobius&quot;) and Telmatherinid sail-fin silversides. The last family is almost entirely restricted to Sulawesi, especially the Malili Lake system, consisting of Matano and Towuti, and the small Lontoa (Wawantoa), Mahalona and Masapi. Another unusual endemic is &quot;Lagusia micracanthus&quot; from rivers in South Sulawesi, which is the sole member of its genus and among the smallest grunters. The gudgeon &quot;Bostrychus microphthalmus&quot; from the Maros Karst is the only described species of cave-adapted fish from Sulawesi, but an apparently undescribed species from the same region and genus also exists.

===Freshwater crustaceans and snails===

Many species of &quot;Caridina&quot; freshwater shrimp and parathelphusid freshwater crabs (&quot;Migmathelphusa&quot;, &quot;Nautilothelphusa&quot;, &quot;Parathelphusa&quot;, &quot;Sundathelphusa&quot; and &quot;Syntripsa&quot;) are endemic to Sulawesi. Several of these species have become very popular in the aquarium hobby, and since most are restricted to a single lake system, they are potentially vulnerable to habitat loss and overexploitation. There are also several endemic cave-adapted shrimp and crabs, especially in the Maros Karst. This includes &quot;Cancrocaeca xenomorpha&quot;, which has been called the &quot;most highly cave-adapted species of crab known in the world&quot;.

The genus &quot;Tylomelania&quot; of freshwater snails is also endemic to Sulawesi, with the majority of the species restricted to Lake Poso and the Malili Lake system.

===Insects===
The &quot;Trigonopterus selayarensis&quot; is a flightless weevil endemic to Sulawesi.

===Miscellaneous===
The Indonesian coelacanth and the mimic octopus are present in the waters off Sulawesi&#x27;s coast.

===Conservation===
Sulawesi island was recently the subject of an Ecoregional Conservation Assessment, coordinated by The Nature Conservancy. Detailed reports about the vegetation of the island are available. The assessment produced a detailed and annotated list of &#x27;conservation portfolio&#x27; sites. This information was widely distributed to local government agencies and nongovernmental organizations. Detailed conservation priorities have also been outlined in a recent publication.

The lowland forests on the island have mostly been removed. Because of the relative geological youth of the island and its dramatic and sharp topography, the lowland areas are naturally limited in their extent. The past decade has seen dramatic conversion of this rare and endangered habitat. The island also possesses one of the largest outcrops of serpentine soil in the world, which support an unusual and large community of specialized plant species. Overall, the flora and fauna of this unique center of global biodiversity is very poorly documented and understood and remains critically threatened.

The islands of Pepaya, Mas, and Raja islands, located in Sumalata Village – North Gorontalo Regency (about 30 km from Saronde Island), have been named a nature reserve since the Dutch colonial time in 1936. Four of the only seven species of sea turtles can be found in the islands, the world&#x27;s best turtle habitat. They include penyu hijau (&quot;Chelonia midas&quot;), penyu sisik (&quot;Eretmochelys imbricata&quot;), penyu tempayan (&quot;Caretta caretta&quot;) and penyu belimbing (&quot;Dermochelys coriacea&quot;). In 2011, the habitat was threatened by human activities such as illegal poaching and fish bombing activities; furthermore, many coral reefs, which represent a source of food for turtles, have been damaged.

==Environment==

The largest environmental issue in Sulawesi is deforestation. In 2007, scientists found that 80 percent of Sulawesi&#x27;s forest had been lost or degraded, especially centered in the lowlands and the mangroves. Forests have been felled for logging and large agricultural projects. Loss of forest has resulted in many of Sulawesi&#x27;s endemic species becoming endangered. In addition, 99 percent of Sulawesi&#x27;s wetlands have been lost or damaged.

Other environmental threats included bushmeat hunting and mining.

=== Parks ===

The island of Sulawesi has six national parks and nineteen nature reserves. In addition, Sulawesi has three marine protected areas. Many of Sulawesi&#x27;s parks are threatened by logging, mining, and deforestation for agriculture.

<doc id="28741" wikidata="Q11708" url="?curid=28741" title="Southeast Asia">
<text>Southeast Asia is the geographical southeastern region of Asia, consisting of the regions that are situated south of China, east of the Indian subcontinent, and northwest of the Australian mainland, which is part of Oceania. Southeast Asia is bordered to the north by East Asia, to the west by South Asia and the Bay of Bengal, to the east by Oceania and the Pacific Ocean, and to the south by Australia and the Indian Ocean. Apart from the British Indian Ocean Territory and two out of 26 atolls of the Maldives in South Asia, Maritime Southeast Asia is the only other subregion of Asia that lies partly within the Southern Hemisphere. Mainland Southeast Asia is entirely in the Northern Hemisphere. East Timor and the southern portion of Indonesia are the parts of Southeast Asia that lie south of the equator.

The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with both heavy seismic and volcanic activities. The Sunda plate is the main plate of the region, featuring almost all Southeast Asian countries except Myanmar, northern Thailand, northern Laos, northern Vietnam, and northern Luzon of the Philippines, while the Sunda plate only includes western Indonesia to as far east as the Indonesian province of Bali. The mountain ranges in Myanmar, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, and the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, Lesser Sunda Islands, and Timor are part of the Alpide belt, while the islands of the Philippines and Indonesia as well as East Timor are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Both seismic belts meet in Indonesia, causing the region to have relatively high occurrences of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, particularly in the Philippines and Indonesia.

It covers about , which is 8% of Eurasia and 3% of Earth&#x27;s total land area. Its total population is more than million, about 8.5% of the world&#x27;s population. It is the third most populous geographical region in Asia after South Asia and East Asia. The region is culturally and ethnically diverse, with hundreds of languages spoken by different ethnic groups. Ten countries in the region are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a regional organisation established for economic, political, military, educational, and cultural integration among its members.

Southeast Asia is one of the most culturally diverse regions of the world. There are many different languages and ethnicities in the region. Historically, Southeast Asia was significantly influenced by Indian, Chinese, Muslim, and colonial cultures, which became core components of the region&#x27;s cultural and political institutions. Most modern Southeast Asian countries were colonised by European powers. European colonisation exploited natural resources and labour from the lands they conquered, and attempted to spread European institutions to the region. Several Southeast Asian countries were also briefly occupied by the Japanese Empire during World War II. The aftermath of World War II saw most of the region decolonised. Today, Southeast Asia is predominantly governed by independent states.

==Definition==
The region, together with part of South Asia, was well known by Europeans as the East Indies or simply the Indies until the 20th century. Chinese sources referred to the region as &quot;Nanyang&quot; (&quot;&quot;), which literally means the &quot;Southern Ocean&quot;. The mainland section of Southeast Asia was referred to as Indochina by European geographers due to its location between China and the Indian subcontinent and its having cultural influences from both neighbouring regions. In the 20th century, however, the term became more restricted to territories of the former French Indochina (Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam). The maritime section of Southeast Asia is also known as the Malay Archipelago, a term derived from the European concept of a Malay race. Another term for Maritime Southeast Asia is &quot;Insulindia&quot; (Indian Islands), used to describe the region between Indochina and Australasia.

The term &quot;Southeast Asia&quot; was first used in 1839 by American pastor Howard Malcolm in his book &quot;Travels in South-Eastern Asia&quot;. Malcolm only included the Mainland section and excluded the Maritime section in his definition of Southeast Asia. The term was officially used in the midst of World War II by the Allies, through the formation of South East Asia Command (SEAC) in 1943. SEAC popularised the use of the term &quot;Southeast Asia&quot;, although what constituted Southeast Asia was not fixed; for example, SEAC excluded the Philippines and a large part of Indonesia while including Ceylon. However, by the late 1970s, a roughly standard usage of the term &quot;Southeast Asia&quot; and the territories it encompasses had emerged. Although from a cultural or linguistic perspective the definitions of &quot;Southeast Asia&quot; may vary, the most common definitions nowadays include the area represented by the countries (sovereign states and dependent territories) listed below.

Ten of the eleven states of Southeast Asia are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), while East Timor is an observer state. Papua New Guinea has stated that it might join ASEAN, and is currently an observer. Sovereignty issues exist over some islands in the South China Sea.

===Geographical divisions===

Southeast Asia is geographically divided into two subregions, namely Mainland Southeast Asia (or the Indochinese Peninsula) and Maritime Southeast Asia.

Mainland Southeast Asia includes:
* Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam:
** Cambodia
** Laos
** Vietnam
* Myanmar, Thailand and West Malaysia:
** Myanmar
** Thailand
** West Malaysia

Maritime Southeast Asia includes:

* Brunei
* East Malaysia
* East Timor
* Indonesia
* Philippines
* Singapore
While Peninsular Malaysia is geographically situated in Mainland Southeast Asia, it shares many similar cultural and ecological affinities with surrounding islands, thus it is often grouped with them as part of Maritime Southeast Asia. Geographically, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India is also considered a part of Maritime Southeast Asia. Eastern Bangladesh and Northeast India have strong cultural ties with Mainland Southeast Asia and are sometimes considered transregional areas between South Asia and Southeast Asia (see also: Eastern South Asia and Southeast Asian relations with Northeast India). To the east, Hong Kong is sometimes regarded as part of Southeast Asia. Similarly, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands have strong cultural ties with Maritime Southeast Asia and are sometimes considered transregional areas between Southeast Asia and Australia/Oceania. On some occasions, Sri Lanka has been considered a part of Southeast Asia because of its cultural and religious ties to Mainland Southeast Asia. The eastern half of the island of New Guinea, which is not a part of Indonesia, namely, Papua New Guinea, is sometimes included as a part of Maritime Southeast Asia, and so are Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau, which were all parts of the Spanish East Indies with strong cultural and linguistic ties to the region, specifically, the Philippines.

East Timor and the eastern half of Indonesia (east of the Wallace Line in the region of Wallacea) are considered to be geographically associated with Oceania due to their distinctive faunal features. Geologically, the island of New Guinea and its surrounding islands are considered as parts of the Australian continent, connected via the Sahul Shelf. Both Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are located on the Australian plate, south of the Sunda Trench. Even though they are geographically closer to Maritime Southeast Asia than mainland Australia, these two Australian external territories are not geologically associated with Asia as none of them is actually on the Sunda plate. The UN Statistics Division&#x27;s geoscheme, which is a UN political geography tool created specifically for statistical purposes, has classified both island territories as parts of Oceania, under the UNSD subregion &quot;Australia and New Zealand&quot; (Australasia).
Some definitions of Southeast Asia may include Taiwan. Taiwan has sometimes been included in Southeast Asia as well as East Asia but is not a member of ASEAN. Likewise, a similar argument could be applied to some southern parts of mainland China, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, may also considered as part of Southeast Asia as well as East Asia but are not members of ASEAN.



==History==
===Prehistory===

The region was already inhabited by &quot;Homo erectus&quot; from approximately 1,500,000 years ago during the Middle Pleistocene age. Distinct &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; groups, ancestral to Eastern non-African (related to East Asians as well as Papuans) populations, reached the region by between 50,000BC to 70,000BC, with some arguing earlier. Rock art (parietal art) dating from 40,000 to 60,000 years ago (which is currently the world&#x27;s oldest) has been discovered in the caves of Sulawesi and Borneo (Kalimantan). &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; also lived in the area up until at least 50,000 years ago, after which they became extinct. During much of this time the present-day islands of western Indonesia were joined into a single landmass known as Sundaland due to lower sea levels.

Ancient remains of hunter-gatherers in Maritime Southeast Asia, such as one Holocene hunter-gatherer from South Sulawesi, had ancestry from both the Papuan-related and East Asian-related branches of the Eastern non-African lineage. The hunter-gatherer individual had approximately ~50% &quot;Basal-East Asian&quot; ancestry, and was positioned in between modern East Asians and Papuans of Oceania. The authors concluded that East Asian-related ancestry expanded from Mainland Southeast Asia into Maritime Southeast Asia much earlier than previously suggested, as early as 25,000BC, long before the expansion of Austroasiatic and Austronesian groups.

Distinctive Basal-East Asian (East-Eurasian) ancestry was recently found to have originated in Mainland Southeast Asia at ~50,000BC, and expanded through multiple migration waves southwards and northwards respectively. Geneflow of East Asian-related ancestry into Maritime Southeast Asia and Oceania could be estimated to ~25,000BC (possibly also earlier). The pre-Neolithic Papuan-related populations of Maritime Southeast Asia were largely replaced by the expansion of various East Asian-related populations, beginning about 50,000BC to 25,000BC years ago from Mainland Southeast Asia. The remainders, known as Negritos, form small minority groups in geographically isolated regions. Southeast Asia was dominated by East Asian-related ancestry already in 15,000BC, predating the expansion of Austroasiatic and Austronesian peoples.

In the late Neolithic, the Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population in Brunei, Indonesia, East Timor, Malaysia, and the Philippines, migrated to Southeast Asia from Taiwan in the first seaborne human migration known as the Austronesian Expansion. They arrived in the northern Philippines between 7,000 BC to 2,200 BC and rapidly spread further into the Northern Mariana Islands and Borneo by 1500 BC; Island Melanesia by 1300 BC; and to the rest of Indonesia, Malaysia, southern Vietnam, and Palau by 1000 BC. They often settled along coastal areas, replacing and assimilating the diverse preexisting peoples.

The Austronesian peoples of Southeast Asia have been seafarers for thousands of years. They spread eastwards to Micronesia and Polynesia, as well as westwards to Madagascar, becoming the ancestors of modern-day Malagasy, Micronesians, Melanesians, and Polynesians. Passage through the Indian Ocean aided the colonisation of Madagascar, as well as commerce between Western Asia, eastern coast of India and Chinese southern coast. Gold from Sumatra is thought to have reached as far west as Rome. Pliny the Elder wrote in his &quot;Natural History&quot; about Chryse and Argyre, two legendary islands rich in gold and silver, located in the Indian Ocean. Their vessels, such as the vinta, were capable to sail across the ocean. Magellan&#x27;s voyage records how much more manoeuvrable their vessels were, as compared to the European ships. A slave from the Sulu Sea was believed to have been used in the Magellan expedition as a translator.

Studies presented by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) through genetic studies of the various peoples of Asia show empirically that there was a single migration event from Africa, whereby the early people travelled along the south coast of Asia, first entered the Malay Peninsula 50,000–90,000 years ago. The Orang Asli, in particular the Semang who show Negrito characteristics, are the direct descendants of these earliest settlers of Southeast Asia. These early people diversified and travelled slowly northwards to China, and the populations of Southeast Asia show greater genetic diversity than the younger population of China.

Solheim and others have shown evidence for a &quot;Nusantao&quot; maritime trading network ranging from Vietnam to the rest of the archipelago as early as 5000 BC to 1 AD. The Bronze Age Dong Son culture flourished in Northern Vietnam from about 1000 BC to 1 BC. Its influence spread to other parts Southeast Asia. The region entered the Iron Age era in 500 BC, when iron was forged also in northern Vietnam still under Dong Son, due to its frequent interactions with neighbouring China.

Most Southeast Asian people were originally animist, engaged in ancestors, nature, and spirits worship. These belief systems were later supplanted by Hinduism and Buddhism after the region, especially coastal areas, came under contact with Indian subcontinent during the first century. Indian Brahmins and traders brought Hinduism to the region and made contacts with local courts. Local rulers converted to Hinduism or Buddhism and adopted Indian religious traditions to reinforce their legitimacy, elevate ritual status above their fellow chief counterparts and facilitate trade with South Asian states. They periodically invited Indian Brahmins into their realms and began a gradual process of Indianisation in the region. Shaivism was the dominant religious tradition of many southern Indian Hindu kingdoms during the first century. It then spread into Southeast Asia via the Bay of Bengal, Indochina, then Malay Archipelago, leading to thousands of Shiva temples on the islands of Indonesia as well as Cambodia and Vietnam, co-evolving with Buddhism in the region. Theravada Buddhism entered the region during the third century, via maritime trade routes between the region and Sri Lanka. Buddhism later established a strong presence in Funan region in the fifth century. In present-day mainland Southeast Asia, Theravada is still the dominant branch of Buddhism, practised by the Thai, Burmese, and Cambodian Buddhists. This branch was fused with the Hindu-influenced Khmer culture. Mahayana Buddhism established presence in Maritime Southeast Asia, brought by Chinese monks during their transit in the region en route to Nalanda. It is still the dominant branch of Buddhism practised by Indonesian and Malaysian Buddhists.

The spread of these two Indian religions confined the adherents of Southeast Asian indigenous beliefs into remote inland areas. The Maluku Islands and New Guinea were never Indianised and its native people were predominantly animists until the 15th century when Islam began to spread in those areas. While in Vietnam, Buddhism never managed to develop strong institutional networks due to strong Chinese influence. In present-day Southeast Asia, Vietnam is the only country where its folk religion makes up the plurality. Recently, Vietnamese folk religion is undergoing a revival with the support of the government. Elsewhere, there are ethnic groups in Southeast Asia that resisted conversion and still retain their original animist beliefs, such as the Dayaks in Kalimantan, the Igorots in Luzon, and the Shans in eastern Myanmar.

=== Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms era ===
After the region came under contact with the Indian subcontinent , it began a gradual process of Indianisation where Indian ideas such as religions, cultures, architectures, and political administrations were brought by traders and religious figures and adopted by local rulers. In turn, Indian Brahmins and monks were invited by local rulers to live in their realms and help transforming local polities to become more Indianised, blending Indian and indigenous traditions. Sanskrit and Pali became the elite language of the region, which effectively made Southeast Asia part of the Indosphere. Most of the region had been Indianised during the first centuries, while the Philippines later Indianised when Kingdom of Tondo was established in Luzon. Vietnam, especially its northern part, was never fully Indianised due to the many periods of Chinese domination it experienced.

The first Indian-influenced polities established in the region were the Pyu city-states that already existed circa second century BCE, located in inland Myanmar. It served as an overland trading hub between India and China. Theravada Buddhism was the predominant religion of these city states, while the presence of other Indian religions such as Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism were also widespread. In the first century, the Funan states centered in Mekong Delta were established, encompassed modern-day Cambodia, southern Vietnam, Laos, and eastern Thailand. It became the dominant trading power in mainland Southeast Asia for about five centuries, provided passage for Indian and Chinese goods and assumed authority over the flow of commerce through Southeast Asia. In maritime Southeast Asia, the first recorded Indianised kingdom was Salakanagara, established in western Java circa second century CE. This Hindu kingdom was known by the Greeks as &quot;Argyre&quot; (Land of Silver).

By the fifth century CE, trade networking between East and West was concentrated in the maritime route. Foreign traders were starting to use new routes such as Malacca and Sunda Strait due to the development of maritime Southeast Asia. This change resulted in the decline of Funan, while new maritime powers such as Srivijaya, Tarumanagara, and Mataram emerged. Srivijaya especially became the dominant maritime power for more than 5 centuries, controlling both Strait of Malacca and Sunda Strait. This dominance started to decline when Srivijaya were invaded by Chola Empire, a dominant maritime power of Indian subcontinent, in 1025. The invasion reshaped power and trade in the region, resulted in the rise of new regional powers such as the Khmer Empire and Kahuripan. Continued commercial contacts with the Chinese Empire enabled the Cholas to influence the local cultures. Many of the surviving examples of the Hindu cultural influence found today throughout Southeast Asia are the result of the Chola expeditions.

As Srivijaya influence in the region declined, The Hindu Khmer Empire experienced a golden age during the 11th to 13th century CE. The empire&#x27;s capital Angkor hosts majestic monuments—such as Angkor Wat and Bayon. Satellite imaging has revealed that Angkor, during its peak, was the largest pre-industrial urban centre in the world. The Champa civilisation was located in what is today central Vietnam, and was a highly Indianised Hindu Kingdom. The Vietnamese launched a massive conquest against the Cham people during the 1471 Vietnamese invasion of Champa, ransacking and burning Champa, slaughtering thousands of Cham people, and forcibly assimilating them into Vietnamese culture.

During the 13th century CE, the region experienced Mongol invasions, affected areas such as Vietnamese coast, inland Burma and Java. In 1258, 1285 and 1287, the Mongols tried to invade Đại Việt and Champa. The invasions were unsuccessful, yet both Dai Viet and Champa agreed to become tributary states to Yuan dynasty to avoid further conflicts. The Mongols also invaded Pagan Kingdom in Burma from 1277 to 1287, resulted in fragmentation of the Kingdom and rise of smaller Shan States ruled by local chieftains nominally submitted to Yuan dynasty. However, in 1297, a new local power emerged. Myinsaing Kingdom became the real ruler of Central Burma and challenged the Mongol rule. This resulted in the second Mongol invasion of Burma in 1300, which was repulsed by Myinsaing. The Mongols would later in 1303 withdrawn from Burma. In 1292, The Mongols sent envoys to Singhasari Kingdom in Java to ask for submission to Mongol rule. Singhasari rejected the proposal and injured the envoys, enraged the Mongols and made them sent a large invasion fleet to Java. Unbeknownst to them, Singhasari collapsed in 1293 due to a revolt by Kadiri, one of its vassals. When the Mongols arrived in Java, a local prince named Raden Wijaya offered his service to assist the Mongols in punishing Kadiri. After Kadiri was defeated, Wijaya turned on his Mongol allies, ambushed their invasion fleet and forced them to immediately leave Java.

After the departure of the Mongols, Wijaya established the Majapahit Empire in eastern Java in 1293. Majapahit would soon grow into a regional power. Its greatest ruler was Hayam Wuruk, whose reign from 1350 to 1389 marked the empire&#x27;s peak when other kingdoms in the southern Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, and Bali came under its influence. Various sources such as the Nagarakertagama also mention that its influence spanned over parts of Sulawesi, Maluku, and some areas of western New Guinea and southern Philippines, making it one of the largest empire to ever exist in Southeast Asian history. By the 15th century CE however, Majapahit&#x27;s influence began to wane due to many war of successions it experienced and the rise of new Islamic states such as Samudera Pasai and Malacca Sultanate around the strategic Strait of Malacca. Majapahit then collapsed around 1500. It was the last major Hindu kingdom and the last regional power in the region before the arrival of the Europeans.

===Spread of Islam===


Islam began to make contacts with Southeast Asia in the eighth-century CE, when the Umayyads established trade with the region via sea routes. However its spread into the region happened centuries later. In the 11th century, a turbulent period occurred in the history of Maritime Southeast Asia. The Indian Chola navy crossed the ocean and attacked the Srivijaya kingdom of Sangrama Vijayatungavarman in Kadaram (Kedah); the capital of the powerful maritime kingdom was sacked and the king was taken captive. Along with Kadaram, Pannai in present-day Sumatra and Malaiyur and the Malayan peninsula were attacked too. Soon after that, the king of Kedah Phra Ong Mahawangsa became the first ruler to abandon the traditional Hindu faith, and converted to Islam with the Sultanate of Kedah established in 1136. Samudera Pasai converted to Islam in 1267, the King of Malacca Parameswara married the princess of Pasai, and the son became the first sultan of Malacca. Soon, Malacca became the center of Islamic study and maritime trade, and other rulers followed suit. Indonesian religious leader and Islamic scholar Hamka (1908–1981) wrote in 1961: &quot;The development of Islam in Indonesia and Malaya is intimately related to a Chinese Muslim, Admiral Zheng He.&quot;

There are several theories to the Islamization process in Southeast Asia. Another theory is trade. The expansion of trade among West Asia, India, and Southeast Asia helped the spread of the religion as Muslim traders from South Arabia (Hadhramaut) brought Islam to the region with their large volume of trade. Many settled in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. This is evident in the Arab-Indonesian, Arab-Singaporean, and Arab-Malay populations who were at one time very prominent in each of their countries. Finally, the ruling classes embraced Islam and that further aided the permeation of the religion throughout the region. The ruler of the region&#x27;s most important port, Malacca Sultanate, embraced Islam in the 15th century, heralding a period of accelerated conversion of Islam throughout the region as Islam provided a positive force among the ruling and trading classes. Gujarati Muslims played a pivotal role in establishing Islam in Southeast Asia.

===Trade and colonization===
Trade among Southeast Asian countries has a long tradition. The consequences of colonial rule, struggle for independence, and in some cases war influenced the economic attitudes and policies of each country.

====Chinese====
From 111 BC to 938 AD, northern Vietnam was under Chinese rule. Vietnam was successfully governed by a series of Chinese dynasties including the Han, Eastern Han, Eastern Wu, Cao Wei, Jin, Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang, Sui, Tang, and Southern Han.
Records from Magellan&#x27;s voyage show that Brunei possessed more cannon than European ships, so the Chinese must have been trading with them.

Malaysian legend has it that a Chinese Ming emperor sent a princess, Hang Li Po, to Malacca, with a retinue of 500, to marry Sultan Mansur Shah after the emperor was impressed by the wisdom of the sultan. Hang Li Poh&#x27;s Well (constructed 1459) is now a tourist attraction there, as is Bukit Cina, where her retinue settled.

The strategic value of the Strait of Malacca, which was controlled by Sultanate of Malacca in the 15th and early 16th century, did not go unnoticed by Portuguese writer Tomé Pires, who wrote in the &quot;Suma Oriental&quot;: &quot;Whoever is lord of Malacca has his hand on the throat of Venice.&quot; (Venice was a major European trading partner, and goods were transported there via the Straight.)

====European====


Western influence started to enter in the 16th century, with the arrival of the Portuguese in Malacca, Maluku, and the Philippines, the latter being settled by the Spaniards years later, which they used to trade between Asia and Latin America. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch established the Dutch East Indies; the French Indochina; and the British Strait Settlements. By the 19th century, all Southeast Asian countries were colonised except for Thailand.

European explorers were reaching Southeast Asia from the west and from the east. Regular trade between the ships sailing east from the Indian Ocean and south from mainland Asia provided goods in return for natural products, such as honey and hornbill beaks from the islands of the archipelago. Before the 18th and 19th centuries, the Europeans mostly were interested in expanding trade links. For the majority of the populations in each country, there was comparatively little interaction with Europeans and traditional social routines and relationships continued. For most, a life with subsistence-level agriculture, fishing and, in less developed civilisations, hunting and gathering was still hard.

Europeans brought Christianity allowing Christian missionaries to become widespread. Thailand also allowed Western scientists to enter its country to develop its own education system as well as start sending royal members and Thai scholars to get higher education from Europe and Russia.

====Japanese====
During World War II, Imperial Japan invaded most of the former western colonies under the concept of &quot;Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere&quot;. However, the Shōwa occupation regime committed violent actions against civilians such as live human experimentation, sexual slavery under the brutal &quot;comfort women&quot; system,

 the Manila massacre and the implementation of a system of forced labour, such as the one involving four to ten million &quot;romusha&quot; in Indonesia. A later UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia as a result of famine and forced labour during the Japanese occupation. The Allied powers who then defeated Japan (and other allies of Axis) in the South-East Asian theatre of World War II then contended with nationalists to whom the occupation authorities had granted independence.

====Indian====

Gujarat, India had a flourishing trade relationship with Southeast Asia in the 15th and 16th centuries. The trade relationship with Gujarat declined after the Portuguese invasion of Southeast Asia in the 17th century.

====American====
The United States took the Philippines from Spain in 1898. Internal autonomy was granted in 1934, and independence in 1946.

===Contemporary history===
Most countries in the region maintain national autonomy. Democratic forms of government are practised in most Southeast Asian countries and human rights is recognised but dependent on each nation state. Socialist or communist countries in Southeast Asia include Vietnam and Laos. ASEAN provides a framework for the integration of commerce and regional responses to international concerns.

China has asserted broad claims over the South China Sea, based on its nine-dash line, and has built artificial islands in an attempt to bolster its claims. China also has asserted an exclusive economic zone based on the Spratly Islands. The Philippines challenged China in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in 2013, and in &quot;Philippines v. China&quot; (2016), the Court ruled in favour of the Philippines and rejected China&#x27;s claims.

====Indochina Wars====
==Geography==


Indonesia is the largest country in Southeast Asia and is also the largest archipelago in the world by size (according to the CIA World Factbook). Geologically, the Indonesian Archipelago is one of the most volcanically active regions in the world. Geological uplifts in the region have also produced some impressive mountains, culminating in Puncak Jaya in Papua, Indonesia at , on the island of New Guinea; it is the only place where ice glaciers can be found in Southeast Asia. The highest mountain in Southeast Asia is Hkakabo Razi at and can be found in northern Burma sharing the same range of its parent peak, Mount Everest.

The South China Sea is the major body of water within Southeast Asia. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and Singapore, have integral rivers that flow into the South China Sea.

Mayon Volcano, despite being dangerously active, holds the record of the world&#x27;s most perfect cone which is built from past and continuous eruption.

===Boundaries===
Geographically, Southeast Asia is bounded to the southeast by the Australian continent, the boundary between these two regions is most often considered to run through Wallacea.

Geopolitically, the boundary lies between Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian region of Western New Guinea (Papua and West Papua). Both countries share the island of New Guinea.

Islands to the east of the Philippines make up the region of Micronesia. These islands are not biogeographically, geologically or historically linked to mainland Asia, and are considered part of Oceania by the United Nations, &quot;The World Factbook&quot;, and other organisations. The Oceania region is politically represented through the Pacific Islands Forum, a governing body which, up until 2022, included Australia, New Zealand and all independent territories in Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Several countries of Maritime Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia and the Philippines, are dialogue partners of the Pacific Islands Forum, but none have full membership.

Maritime Southeast Asia was often grouped with Australia and Oceania in the mid to late 1800s, rather than with mainland Asia. The term Oceania came into usage at the beginning of the 1800s, and the earlier definitions predated the advent of concepts such as Wallacea.

The non-continental Australian external territories of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are sometimes considered part of Maritime Southeast Asia, as they lie in much closer proximity to western Indonesia than they do to mainland Australia. They have a multicultural mix of inhabitants with Asian and European Australian ancestry, and were uninhabited when discovered by the British during the 17th century. The islands lie within the bounds of the Australian Plate, and are defined by &quot;The World Factbook&quot; as the westernmost extent of Oceania. The United Nations also include these islands in their definition of Oceania, under the same subregion as Australia and New Zealand.

===Climate===
Most of Southeast Asia have a tropical climate that is hot and humid all year round with plentiful rainfall. The majority of Southeast Asia has a wet and dry season caused by seasonal shifts in winds or monsoons. The tropical rain belt causes additional rainfall during the monsoon season. The rainforest is the second largest on Earth (with the Amazon rainforest being the largest). Exceptions to the typical tropical climate and forest vegetation are:
# Northern Vietnam with a subtropical climate that is sometimes influenced by cold waves which move from the northeast and the Siberian High
## the northern part of Central Vietnam also is occasionally influenced by cold waves
# mountain areas in the northern region and the higher islands, where high altitudes lead to milder temperatures
# the “dry zone” of central Myanmar in the rain shadow of the Arakan Mountains, where annual rainfall can be as low as , which under the hot temperatures that prevail is dry enough to qualify as semi-arid. 
# Southern areas in South Central Coast of Vietnam is marked with hot semi-arid climate due to weak monsoon activities and high temperature throughout the year. Annual rainfall of this region varies between to , with an 8-month dry season. 

==== Climate change ====
Southeast Asia lags behind on mitigation measures, even though it is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change in the world. Climate change has already caused an increase in &quot;heavy&quot; precipitation events (defined as 400 mm or more in a day) and greater increases are expected in this region. Changes in rainfall and runoff will also affect the quality of water supply used by the irrigation systems. Under a high-warming scenario, heat-related deaths in the region could increase by 12.7% by 2100. Among the elderly in Malaysia, annual heat-related deaths may go from less than 1 per 100,000 to 45 per 100,000.

Sea level rise is a serious threat. Along Philippine coasts, it occurs three times faster than the global average, while 199 out of 514 cities and districts in Indonesia could be affected by tidal flooding by 2050. Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta are amongst the 20 coastal cities which would have the world&#x27;s highest annual flood losses in the year 2050. Due to land subsidence, Jakarta is sinking so much (up to per year between 1982 and 2010 in some areas) that by 2019, the government had committed to relocate the capital of Indonesia to another city.

Climate change is also likely to pose a serious threat to the region&#x27;s fisheries: 
3.35 million fishers in the Southeast Asia are reliant on coral reefs, and yet those reefs are highly vulnerable to even low-emission climate change and will likely be lost if global warming exceeds By 2050–2070, around 30% of the region&#x27;s aquaculture area and 10-20% of aquaculture production may be lost.

===Environment===

The vast majority of Southeast Asia falls within the warm, humid tropics, and its climate generally can be characterized as monsoonal. The animals of Southeast Asia are diverse; on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, the orangutan, the Asian elephant, the Malayan tapir, the Sumatran rhinoceros, and the Bornean clouded leopard can also be found. Six subspecies of the binturong or &quot;bearcat&quot; exist in the region, though the one endemic to the island of Palawan is now classed as vulnerable.

Tigers of three different subspecies are found on the island of Sumatra (the Sumatran tiger), in peninsular Malaysia (the Malayan tiger), and in Indochina (the Indochinese tiger); all of which are endangered species.

The Komodo dragon is the largest living species of lizard and inhabits the islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang in Indonesia.

The Philippine eagle is the national bird of the Philippines. It is considered by scientists as the largest eagle in the world, and is endemic to the Philippines&#x27; forests.

The wild water buffalo, and on various islands related dwarf species of &quot;Bubalus&quot; such as anoa were once widespread in Southeast Asia; nowadays the domestic Asian water buffalo is common across the region, but its remaining relatives are rare and endangered.

The mouse deer, a small tusked deer as large as a toy dog or cat, mostly can be found on Sumatra, Borneo (Indonesia), and in Palawan (Philippines). The gaur, a gigantic wild ox larger than even wild water buffalo, is found mainly in Indochina. There is very little scientific information available regarding Southeast Asian amphibians.

Birds such as the green peafowl and drongo live in this subregion as far east as Indonesia. The babirusa, a four-tusked pig, can be found in Indonesia as well. The hornbill was prized for its beak and used in trade with China. The horn of the rhinoceros, not part of its skull, was prized in China as well.

The Indonesian Archipelago is split by the Wallace Line. This line runs along what is now known to be a tectonic plate boundary, and separates Asian (Western) species from Australasian (Eastern) species. The islands between Java/Borneo and Papua form a mixed zone, where both types occur, known as Wallacea. As the pace of development accelerates and populations continue to expand in Southeast Asia, concern has increased regarding the impact of human activity on the region&#x27;s environment. A significant portion of Southeast Asia, however, has not changed greatly and remains an unaltered home to wildlife. The nations of the region, with only a few exceptions, have become aware of the need to maintain forest cover not only to prevent soil erosion but to preserve the diversity of flora and fauna. Indonesia, for example, has created an extensive system of national parks and preserves for this purpose. Even so, such species as the Javan rhinoceros face extinction, with only a handful of the animals remaining in western Java.

The shallow waters of the Southeast Asian coral reefs have the highest levels of biodiversity for the world&#x27;s marine ecosystems, where coral, fish, and molluscs abound. According to Conservation International, marine surveys suggest that the marine life diversity in the Raja Ampat (Indonesia) is the highest recorded on Earth. Diversity is considerably greater than any other area sampled in the Coral Triangle composed of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea. The Coral Triangle is the heart of the world&#x27;s coral reef biodiversity, the Verde Passage is dubbed by Conservation International as the world&#x27;s &quot;center of the center of marine shore fish biodiversity&quot;. The whale shark, the world&#x27;s largest species of fish and 6 species of sea turtles can also be found in the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean territories of the Philippines.

The trees and other plants of the region are tropical; in some countries where the mountains are tall enough, temperate-climate vegetation can be found. These rainforest areas are currently being logged-over, especially in Borneo.

While Southeast Asia is rich in flora and fauna, Southeast Asia is facing severe deforestation which causes habitat loss for various endangered species such as orangutan and the Sumatran tiger. Predictions have been made that more than 40% of the animal and plant species in Southeast Asia could be wiped out in the 21st century. At the same time, haze has been a regular occurrence. The two worst regional hazes were in 1997 and 2006 in which multiple countries were covered with thick haze, mostly caused by &quot;slash and burn&quot; activities in Sumatra and Borneo. In reaction, several countries in Southeast Asia signed the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution to combat haze pollution.

The 2013 Southeast Asian Haze saw API levels reach a hazardous level in some countries. Muar experienced the highest API level of 746 on 23 June 2013 at around 7 am.

==Economy==
Even prior to the penetration of European interests, Southeast Asia was a critical part of the world trading system. A wide range of commodities originated in the region, but especially important were spices such as pepper, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg. The spice trade initially was developed by Indian and Arab merchants, but it also brought Europeans to the region. First, Spaniards (Manila galleon) who sailed from the Americas and Kingdom of Portugal, then the Dutch, and finally the British and French became involved in this enterprise in various countries. The penetration of European commercial interests gradually evolved into annexation of territories, as traders lobbied for an extension of control to protect and expand their activities. As a result, the Dutch moved into Indonesia, the British into Malaya and parts of Borneo, the French into Indochina, and the Spanish and the US into the Philippines. An economic effect of this imperialism was the shift in the production of commodities. For example, the rubber plantations of Malaysia, Java, Vietnam, and Cambodia, the tin mining of Malaya, the rice fields of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, and the Irrawaddy River delta in Burma, were a response to the powerful market demands.

The overseas Chinese community has played a large role in the development of the economies in the region. The origins of Chinese influence can be traced to the 16th century, when Chinese migrants from southern China settled in Indonesia, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian countries. Chinese populations in the region saw a rapid increase following the Communist Revolution in 1949, which forced many refugees to emigrate outside of China.

In 2022, Malaysian petroleum industry through its oil and gas company, Petronas, was ranked eighth in the world by the Brandirectory.

Seventeen telecommunications companies contracted to build the Asia-America Gateway submarine cable to connect Southeast Asia to the US This is to avoid disruption of the kind caused by the cutting of the undersea cable from Taiwan to the US in the 2006 Hengchun earthquakes.

Tourism has been a key factor in economic development for many Southeast Asian countries, especially Cambodia. According to UNESCO, &quot;tourism, if correctly conceived, can be a tremendous development tool and an effective means of preserving the cultural diversity of our planet.&quot; Since the early 1990s, &quot;even the non-ASEAN nations such as Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Burma, where the income derived from tourism is low, are attempting to expand their own tourism industries.&quot; In 1995, Singapore was the regional leader in tourism receipts relative to GDP at over 8%. By 1998, those receipts had dropped to less than 6% of GDP while Thailand and Lao PDR increased receipts to over 7%. Since 2000, Cambodia has surpassed all other ASEAN countries and generated almost 15% of its GDP from tourism in 2006. Furthermore, Vietnam is considered as a growing power in Southeast Asia due to its large foreign investment opportunities and the booming tourism sector.

By the early 21st century, Indonesia had grown to an emerging market economy, becoming the largest economy in the region. It was classified a newly industrialised country and is the region&#x27;s singular member of the G-20 major economies. Indonesia&#x27;s estimated gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020 was US$1,088.8 billion (nominal) or $3,328.3 billion (PPP) with per capita GDP of US$4,038 (nominal) or $12,345 (PPP). By GDP per capita in 2023, Singapore is the leading nation in the region with US$84,500 (nominal) or US$140,280 (PPP), followed by Brunei with US$41,713 (nominal) or US$79,408 (PPP) and Malaysia with US$13,942 (nominal) or US$33,353 (PPP). Besides that, Malaysia has the lowest cost of living in the region, followed by Brunei and Vietnam. On the contrary, Singapore is the costliest country in the region, followed by Thailand and the Philippines.

Stock markets in Southeast Asia have performed better than other bourses in the Asia-Pacific region in 2010, with the Philippines&#x27; PSE leading the way with 22 per cent growth, followed by Thailand&#x27;s SET with 21 per cent and Indonesia&#x27;s JKSE with 19 per cent.

Southeast Asia&#x27;s GDP per capita is US$4,685 according to a 2020 International Monetary Fund estimates, which is comparable to South Africa, Iraq, and Georgia.

== Energy ==
Traditionally, the Southeast Asian economy has heavily relied on fossil fuels. However, it has begun transitioning towards clean energy. The region possesses significant renewable energy potential, including solar, wind, hydro, and pumped hydro energy storage. Modeling indicates that it could achieve a 97% share of solar and wind energy in the electricity mix at competitive costs ranging from $US 55 to $115 per megawatt-hour.

The energy transition in Southeast Asia can be characterized as demanding, doable, and dependent. This implies the presence of substantial challenges, including financial, technical, and institutional barriers. However, it is feasible, as evidenced by Vietnam&#x27;s remarkable achievement of installing about 20 GW of solar and wind power in just three years. International cooperation plays a crucial role in facilitating this transition.

== Demographics ==

Southeast Asia has an area of approximately . As of , around million people live in the region, more than a fifth live (143 million) on the Indonesian island of Java, the most densely populated large island in the world. Indonesia is the most populous country with million people (~40% of South East Asia), and also the fourth most populous country in the world. The distribution of the religions and people is diverse in Southeast Asia and varies by country. Some 30 million overseas Chinese also live in Southeast Asia, most prominently in Christmas Island, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, and also as the Hoa in Vietnam. People of Southeast Asian origins are known as Southeast Asians or Aseanites.

===Ethnic groups===


The peoples of Southeast Asia are mainly divided into four major ethnolinguistic groups: the Austronesian, Austroasiatic (or Mon-Khmers), Tai (part of the wider Kra-Dai family) and Tibeto-Burman (part of greater Sino-Tibetan language family) peoples. There is also a smaller but significant number of Hmong-Mien, Chinese, Dravidians, Indo-Aryans, Eurasians and Papuans, which also contributes to the diversity of peoples in the region.

The Aslians and Negritos were believed to be one of the earliest inhabitants in the region. They are genetically related to Papuans in Eastern Indonesia, East Timor and Australian Aborigines. In modern times, the Javanese are the largest ethnic group in Southeast Asia, with more than 100 million people, mostly concentrated in Java, Indonesia. The second-largest ethnic group in Southeast Asia are the Vietnamese (Kinh people) with around 86 million people, mainly inhabiting Vietnam but also forming a significant minority in neighbouring Cambodia and Laos. The Thais are the third largest with around 59 million people, forming the majority in Thailand.

Indonesia is politically and culturally dominated by the Javanese and Sundanese ethnic groups (both native to Java), but the country also has hundreds of ethnic groups scattered throughout the archipelago, such as the Madurese, Minangkabau, Acehnese, Bugis, Balinese, Dayak, Batak, Malay and Ambonese peoples.

In Malaysia, the country is demographically divided into Malays, who make up more than half of the country&#x27;s population; the Chinese, at around 22%; other Bumiputeras, at 12%; and Indians, at around 6%. In East Malaysia, the Dayaks (mainly Ibans and Bidayuhs) make up the majority in the state of Sarawak, while the Kadazan-Dusuns make up the majority in Sabah. In Labuan, the Bruneian Malays and Kedayans are the largest groups. Overall, the Malays are the majority in Malaysia and Brunei and form a significant minority in Indonesia, Southern Thailand, Myanmar, and Singapore. In Singapore, the demographics of the country is similar to that of its West Malaysian counterparts but instead of Malays, it is the Chinese that are the majority, while the Malays are the second largest group and Indians third largest.

Within the Philippines, the country has no majority ethnic groups; but the four largest ethnolinguistic groups in the country are the Visayans (mainly Cebuanos, Warays and Hiligaynons), Tagalogs, Ilocanos and Bicolanos. Besides the major four, there are also the Moro peoples of Mindanao, consisting of the Tausug, Maranao, Yakan and Maguindanao. Other regional groups in the country are the Kapampangans, Pangasinans, Surigaonons, Ifugao, Kalinga, Kamayo, Cuyonon and Ivatan.

In mainland Southeast Asia, the Burmese accounts for more than two-thirds of the population in Myanmar, but the country also has several regional ethnic groups which mainly live in states that are specifically formed for ethnic minorities. The major regional ethnic groups in Myanmar are the Tai-speaking Shan people, Karen people, Rakhine people, Chin people, Kayah people and Indo-Aryan-speaking Rohingya people living on the westernmost part of the country near the border with Bangladesh. In neighbouring Thailand, the Thais are the largest ethnic group in the country but is divided into several regional Tai groups such as Central Thais, Northern Thais or Lanna, Southern Thais or Pak Thai, and Northeastern Thai or Isan people (which is ethnically more closely related to Lao people than to Central Thais), each have their own unique dialects, history and culture. Besides the Thais, Thailand is also home to more than 70 ethnolinguistic groups of which the largest being Patani Malays, Northern Khmers, Karen, Hmongs and Chinese.

Cambodia is one of the most homogeneous countries in the area, with Khmers forming more than 90% of the population but the country also has a large number of ethnic Chams, Vietnamese and various inland tribes categorised under the term Khmer Loeu (Hill Khmers).

===Religion===

Countries in Southeast Asia practice many different religions and the region is home to many world religions including Abrahamic, Indian, East Asian and Iranian religions. By population, Islam is the most practised faith with approximately 240 million adherents, or about 40% of the entire population, concentrated in Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, Southern Thailand and in the Southern Philippines. Indonesia is the most populous Muslim-majority country in the world. Meanwhile, Islam is constitutionally the official religion in Malaysia and Brunei. The majority of the Muslim population is Sunni, but there are also significant Shia populations in Thailand and Indonesia. A minority are Sufi or Ahmadiyya Muslims.

There are approximately 190-205 million Buddhists in Southeast Asia, making it the second-largest religion in the region. Approximately 28 to 35% of the world&#x27;s Buddhists reside in Southeast Asia. Buddhism is predominant in Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and Singapore, and adherents may come from Theravada or Mahayana schools. Ancestor worship and Confucianism are also widely practised in Vietnam and Singapore. Taoism and Chinese folk religions such as Mazuism are also widely practised by the overseas Chinese community in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. In certain cases, they may include Chinese or local deities in their worshipping practises such as Tua Pek Kong, Datuk Keramat and many more.

Christianity is predominant in the Philippines, eastern Indonesia, East Malaysia, and East Timor. The Philippines has the largest Roman Catholic population in Asia. East Timor is also predominantly Roman Catholic due to a history of Indonesian and Portuguese rule. In October 2019, the number of Christians, both Catholic and Protestant, in Southeast Asia reached 156 million, of which 97 million came from the Philippines, 29 million from Indonesia, 11 million from Vietnam, and the rest from Malaysia, Myanmar, East Timor, Singapore, Laos, Cambodia and Brunei. In addition, Eastern Orthodox Christianity can also be found in the region. In addition, Judaism is practised in certain countries such as in the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia due to the presence of Jewish diaspora. There is a small population of Parsis in Singapore who practise Zoroastrianism, and Baháʼí is also practised by very small population in Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore and Thailand.

No individual Southeast Asian country is religiously homogeneous. Some groups are protected &quot;de facto&quot; by their isolation from the rest of the world. In the world&#x27;s most populous Muslim nation, Indonesia, Hinduism is dominant on islands such as Bali. Christianity also predominates in the rest of the part of the Philippines, New Guinea, Flores and Timor. Pockets of Hindu population can also be found around Southeast Asia in Singapore, Malaysia, etc. Garuda, the phoenix who is the mount (&quot;vahanam&quot;) of Vishnu, is a national symbol in both Thailand and Indonesia; in the Philippines, gold images of Garuda have been found on Palawan; gold images of other Hindu gods and goddesses have also been found on Mindanao. Balinese Hinduism is somewhat different from Hinduism practised elsewhere, as animism and local culture is incorporated into it. Meanwhile, Hindu community in Malaysia and Singapore are mostly South Indian diaspora, hence the practices are closely related to the Indian Hinduism. Additionally, Sikhism is also practised by significant population especially in Malaysia and Singapore by North Indian diaspora specifically from Punjab region. Small population of the Indian diaspora in the region are Jains and can be found in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. Christians can also be found throughout Southeast Asia; they are in the majority in East Timor and the Philippines, Asia&#x27;s largest Christian nation. In addition, there are also older tribal religious practices in remote areas of Sarawak in East Malaysia, Highland Philippines, and Papua in eastern Indonesia. In Burma, Sakka (Indra) is revered as a &quot;Nat&quot;. In Vietnam, Mahayana Buddhism is practised, which is influenced by native animism but with a strong emphasis on ancestor worship. Vietnamese folk religions are practised by majority of population in Vietnam. Caodaism, a monotheistic syncretic new religious movement, is also practised by less than one percent of the population in Vietnam. Due to the presence of Japanese diaspora in the region, the practice of Shinto has growingly made appearance in certain countries such as in Thailand.

The religious composition for each country is as follows: Some values are taken from the &quot;CIA World Factbook&quot;:


===Languages===
Each of the languages has been influenced by cultural pressures due to trade, immigration, and historical colonisation as well. There are nearly 800 native languages in the region.

==Culture==


The culture in Southeast Asia is diverse: on mainland Southeast Asia, the culture is a mix of Burmese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai (Indian) and Vietnamese (Chinese) cultures. While in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia the culture is a mix of indigenous Austronesian, Indian, Islamic, Western, and Chinese cultures. In addition, Brunei shows a strong influence from Arabia. Vietnam and Singapore show more Chinese influence in that Singapore, although being geographically a Southeast Asian nation, is home to a large Chinese majority and Vietnam was in China&#x27;s sphere of influence for much of its history. Indian influence in Singapore is most prominently evident through the Tamil migrants, which influenced, to some extent, the cuisine of Singapore. Throughout Vietnam&#x27;s history, it has had no direct influence from India – only through contact with the Thai, Khmer and Cham peoples. Moreover, Vietnam is also categorised under the East Asian cultural sphere along with China, Korea, and Japan due to a large amount of Chinese influence embedded in their culture and lifestyle.

Rice paddy agriculture has existed in Southeast Asia for millennia, ranging across the subregion. Some dramatic examples of these rice paddies populate the Banaue Rice Terraces in the mountains of Luzon in the Philippines. Maintenance of these paddies is very labour-intensive. The rice paddies are well-suited to the monsoon climate of the region.

Stilt houses can be found all over Southeast Asia, from Thailand and Vietnam to Borneo, to Luzon in the Philippines, to Papua New Guinea. The region has diverse metalworking, especially in Indonesia. This includes weaponry, such as the distinctive kris, and musical instruments, such as the gamelan.

===Influences===
The region&#x27;s chief cultural influences have been from some combination of Islam, India, and China. Diverse cultural influence is pronounced in the Philippines, derived particularly from the period of Spanish and American rule, contact with Indian-influenced cultures, and the Chinese and Japanese trading era.

As a rule of thumb, the peoples who ate with their fingers were more likely influenced by the culture of India, for example, than the culture of China, where the peoples ate with chopsticks; tea, as a beverage, can be found across the region. The fish sauces distinctive to the region tend to vary.

===Arts===
The arts of Southeast Asia have an affinity with the arts of other areas. Dance in much of Southeast Asia includes movement of the hands as well as the feet, to express the dance&#x27;s emotion and meaning of the story that the ballerina is going to tell the audience. Most of Southeast Asia introduced dance into their court; in particular, Cambodian royal ballet represented them in the early seventh century before the Khmer Empire, which was highly influenced by Indian Hinduism. The Apsara Dance, famous for strong hand and feet movement, is a great example of Hindu symbolic dance.

Puppetry and shadow plays were also a favoured form of entertainment in past centuries, a famous one being the &quot;wayang&quot; from Indonesia. The arts and literature in some of Southeast Asia are quite influenced by Hinduism, which was brought to them centuries ago. Indonesia, despite large-scale conversion to Islam which opposes certain forms of art, has retained many forms of Hindu-influenced practices, culture, art, and literature. An example is the (shadow puppet) and literature like the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. The show has been recognised by UNESCO on 7 November 2003 as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

It has been pointed out that Khmer and Indonesian classical arts were concerned with depicting the life of the gods, but to the Southeast Asian mind, the life of the gods was the life of the peoples themselves—joyous, earthy, yet divine. The Tai, coming late into Southeast Asia, brought with them some Chinese artistic traditions, but they soon shed them in favour of the Khmer and Mon traditions, and the only indications of their earlier contact with Chinese arts were in the style of their temples, especially the tapering roof, and in their lacquerware.

====Music====


Traditional music in Southeast Asia is as varied as its many ethnic and cultural divisions. The main styles of traditional music include court music, folk music, music styles of smaller ethnic groups, and music influenced by genres outside the geographic region.

Of the court and folk genres, gong chime ensembles and orchestras make up the majority (the exception being lowland areas of Vietnam). &quot;Gamelan&quot; and &quot;angklung&quot; orchestras from &quot;Indonesia&quot;; &quot;piphat&quot; and &quot;pinpeat&quot; ensembles of Thailand and Cambodia; and the &quot;kulintang&quot; ensembles of the southern Philippines, Borneo, Sulawesi and Timor are the three main distinct styles of musical genres that have influenced other traditional musical styles in the region. String instruments are also popular in the region.

On 18 November 2010, UNESCO officially recognised the &quot;angklung&quot; as a &quot;Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity&quot;, and encouraged the Indonesian people and government to safeguard, transmit, promote performances and to encourage the craftsmanship of &quot;angklung&quot; making.

====Writing====


The history of Southeast Asia has led to a wealth of different authors, from both within and without writing about the region.

Some of the earliest writing systems of Southeast Asia stem from those of India. This is shown through Brahmic forms of writing present in the region, such as the Balinese script shown on split palm leaves called &quot;lontar&quot; (see image to the left – magnify the image to see the writing on the flat side, and the decoration on the reverse side).

The antiquity of this form of writing extends before the invention of paper around the year 100 in China. Note each palm leaf section was only several lines, written longitudinally across the leaf, and bound by twine to the other sections. The outer portion was decorated. The alphabets of Southeast Asia tended to be abugidas, until the arrival of the Europeans, who used words that also ended in consonants, not just vowels. Other forms of official documents, which did not use paper, included Javanese copperplate scrolls. This material would have been more durable than paper in the tropical climate of Southeast Asia.

In Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore, the Malay language is now generally written in the Latin script. The same phenomenon is present in Indonesian, although different spelling standards are utilised (e.g. &#x27;Teksi&#x27; in Malay and &#x27;Taksi&#x27; in Indonesian for the word &#x27;Taxi&#x27;).

The use of Chinese characters, in the past and present, is only evident in Vietnam and more recently, Singapore and Malaysia. The adoption of chữ Hán in Vietnam dates back to around 111 BC when it was occupied by the Chinese. A Vietnamese script called chữ Nôm used modified chữ Hán to express the Vietnamese language. Both chữ Hán and chữ Nôm were used up until the early 20th century.

Rapa Nui is an Austronesian language like those of Indonesian, Tagalog, and many other Southeast Asian languages. Rongorongo is presumed to be the script of Rapa Nui and if proven so, would place it as one of very few inventions of writing in human history.

====Sports====

Association football is the most popular sport in the region, with the ASEAN Football Federation, the region&#x27;s primary regulatory body, formed on 31 January 1984, in Jakarta, Indonesia. The AFF Championship is the largest football competition in the region since its inaugural in 1996, with Thailand holding the most titles in the competition with seven titles. The reigning winner is Thailand, who defeated Vietnam in the 2022 final. Thailand has had the most numerous appearances in the AFC Asian Cup with 7 while the highest-ranked result in the Asian Cup for a Southeast Asian team is second place in the 1968 by Myanmar in Iran. Indonesia is the only Southeast Asian team to have played in the 1938 FIFA World Cup as the Dutch East Indies.

<text>In geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth&#x27;s continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass. However, some geologists use a different definition, &quot;a grouping of formerly dispersed continents&quot;, which leaves room for interpretation and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. To separate supercontinents from other groupings, a limit has been proposed in which a continent must include at least about 75% of the continental crust then in existence in order to qualify as a supercontinent.

Moving under the forces of plate tectonics, supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past. According to modern definitions, a supercontinent does not exist today; the closest is the current Afro-Eurasian landmass, which covers approximately 57% of Earth&#x27;s total land area. The last period in which the continental landmasses were near to one another was 336 to 175 million years ago, forming the supercontinent Pangaea. The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic, shortly before the breakup of Pangaea. Pangaea&#x27;s predecessor Gondwana is not considered a supercontinent under the first definition since the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia were separate at the time.

A future supercontinent, termed Pangaea Proxima, is hypothesized to form within the next 250 million years.

== Theories ==
The Phanerozoic supercontinent Pangaea began to break up and this distancing continues today. Because Pangaea is the most recent of Earth&#x27;s supercontinents, it is the best known and understood. Contributing to Pangaea&#x27;s popularity in the classroom, its reconstruction is almost as simple as fitting together the present continents bordering the Atlantic ocean like puzzle pieces.

For the period before Pangaea, there are two contrasting models for supercontinent evolution through geological time. 

=== Series ===
The first model theorizes that at least two separate supercontinents existed comprising Vaalbara and Kenorland, with Kenorland comprising Superia and Sclavia. These parts of Neoarchean age broke off at ~2480 and , and portions of them later collided to form Nuna (Northern Europe and North America). Nuna continued to develop during the Mesoproterozoic, primarily by lateral accretion of juvenile arcs, and in Nuna collided with other land masses, forming Rodinia. Between ~825 and Rodinia broke apart. However, before completely breaking up, some fragments of Rodinia had already come together to form Gondwana by . Pangaea formed through the collision of Gondwana, Laurasia (Laurentia and Baltica), and Siberia.

=== Protopangea–Paleopangea ===
The second model (Kenorland-Arctica) is based on both palaeomagnetic and geological evidence and proposes that the continental crust comprised a single supercontinent from until break-up during the Ediacaran period after . The reconstruction is derived from the observation that palaeomagnetic poles converge to quasi-static positions for long intervals between ~2.72–2.115 Ga; 1.35–1.13 Ga; and with only small peripheral modifications to the reconstruction. During the intervening periods, the poles conform to a unified apparent polar wander path. 

Although it contrasts the first model, the first phase (Protopangea) essentially incorporates Vaalbara and Kenorland of the first model. The explanation for the prolonged duration of the Protopangea–Paleopangea supercontinent appears to be that lid tectonics (comparable to the tectonics operating on Mars and Venus) prevailed during Precambrian times. According to this theory, plate tectonics as seen on the contemporary Earth became dominant only during the latter part of geological times. This approach was widely criticized by many researchers as it uses incorrect application of paleomagnetic data.

== Cycles ==
A supercontinent cycle is the break-up of one supercontinent and the development of another, which takes place on a global scale. Supercontinent cycles are not the same as the Wilson cycle, which is the opening and closing of an individual oceanic basin. The Wilson cycle rarely synchronizes with the timing of a supercontinent cycle. However, supercontinent cycles and Wilson cycles were both involved in the creation of Pangaea and Rodinia.

Secular trends such as carbonatites, granulites, eclogites, and greenstone belt deformation events are all possible indicators of Precambrian supercontinent cyclicity, although the Protopangea–Paleopangea solution implies that Phanerozoic style of supercontinent cycles did not operate during these times. Also, there are instances where these secular trends have a weak, uneven, or absent imprint on the supercontinent cycle; secular methods for supercontinent reconstruction will produce results that have only one explanation, and each explanation for a trend must fit in with the rest.

The following table names reconstructed ancient supercontinents, using Bradley&#x27;s 2011 looser definition, with an approximate timescale of millions of years ago (Ma).

==Volcanism==

The causes of supercontinent assembly and dispersal are thought to be driven by convection processes in Earth&#x27;s mantle. Approximately 660 km into the mantle, a discontinuity occurs, affecting the surface crust through processes involving plumes and &quot;superplumes&quot; (aka large low-shear-velocity provinces). When a slab of the subducted crust is denser than the surrounding mantle, it sinks to discontinuity. Once the slabs build up, they will sink through to the lower mantle in what is known as a &quot;slab avalanche&quot;. This displacement at the discontinuity will cause the lower mantle to compensate and rise elsewhere. The rising mantle can form a plume or superplume.

Besides having compositional effects on the upper mantle by replenishing the large-ion lithophile elements, volcanism affects plate movement. The plates will be moved towards a geoidal low perhaps where the slab avalanche occurred and pushed away from the geoidal high that can be caused by the plumes or superplumes. This causes the continents to push together to form supercontinents and was evidently the process that operated to cause the early continental crust to aggregate into Protopangea. 

Dispersal of supercontinents is caused by the accumulation of heat underneath the crust due to the rising of very large convection cells or plumes, and a massive heat release resulted in the final break-up of Paleopangea. Accretion occurs over geoidal lows that can be caused by avalanche slabs or the downgoing limbs of convection cells. Evidence of the accretion and dispersion of supercontinents is seen in the geological rock record.

The influence of known volcanic eruptions does not compare to that of flood basalts. The timing of flood basalts has corresponded with a large-scale continental break-up. However, due to a lack of data on the time required to produce flood basalts, the climatic impact is difficult to quantify. The timing of a single lava flow is also undetermined. These are important factors on how flood basalts influenced paleoclimate.

==Plate tectonics==
Global palaeogeography and plate interactions as far back as Pangaea are relatively well understood today. However, the evidence becomes more sparse further back in geologic history. Marine magnetic anomalies, passive margin match-ups, geologic interpretation of orogenic belts, paleomagnetism, paleobiogeography of fossils, and distribution of climatically sensitive strata are all methods to obtain evidence for continent locality and indicators of the environment throughout time.

Phanerozoic (541 Ma to present) and Precambrian ( to ) had primarily passive margins and detrital zircons (and orogenic granites), whereas the tenure of Pangaea contained few. Matching edges of continents are where passive margins form. The edges of these continents may rift. At this point, seafloor spreading becomes the driving force. Passive margins are therefore born during the break-up of supercontinents and die during supercontinent assembly. Pangaea&#x27;s supercontinent cycle is a good example of the efficiency of using the presence or lack of these entities to record the development, tenure, and break-up of supercontinents. There is a sharp decrease in passive margins between 500 and during the timing of Pangaea&#x27;s assembly. The tenure of Pangaea is marked by a low number of passive margins during 336 to and its break-up is indicated accurately by an increase in passive margins.

Orogenic belts can form during the assembly of continents and supercontinents. The orogenic belts present on continental blocks are classified into three different categories and have implications for interpreting geologic bodies. Intercratonic orogenic belts are characteristic of ocean basin closure. Clear indicators of intracratonic activity contain ophiolites and other oceanic materials that are present in the suture zone. Intracratonic orogenic belts occur as thrust belts and do not contain any oceanic material. However, the absence of ophiolites is not strong evidence for intracratonic belts, because the oceanic material can be squeezed out and eroded away in an intracratonic environment. The third kind of orogenic belt is a confined orogenic belt which is the closure of small basins. The assembly of a supercontinent would have to show intracratonic orogenic belts. However, interpretation of orogenic belts can be difficult.

The collision of Gondwana and Laurasia occurred in the late Palaeozoic. By this collision, the Variscan mountain range was created, along the equator. This 6000-km-long mountain range is usually referred to in two parts: the Hercynian mountain range of the late Carboniferous makes up the eastern part, and the western part is the Appalachian Mountains, uplifted in the early Permian. (The existence of a flat elevated plateau like the Tibetan Plateau is under debate.) The locality of the Variscan range made it influential to both the northern and southern hemispheres. The elevation of the Appalachians would greatly influence global atmospheric circulation.

==Climate==
Continents affect the climate of the planet drastically, with supercontinents having a larger, more prevalent influence. Continents modify global wind patterns, control ocean current paths, and have a higher albedo than the oceans. Winds are redirected by mountains, and albedo differences cause shifts in onshore winds. Higher elevation in continental interiors produces a cooler, drier climate, the phenomenon of continentality. This is seen today in Eurasia, and rock record shows evidence of continentality in the middle of Pangaea.

===Glacial===

The term glacial-epoch refers to a long episode of glaciation on Earth over millions of years. Glaciers have major implications on the climate, particularly through sea level change. Changes in the position and elevation of the continents, the paleolatitude and ocean circulation affect the glacial epochs. There is an association between the rifting and breakup of continents and supercontinents and glacial epochs. According to the model for Precambrian supercontinent series, the breakup of Kenorland and Rodinia was associated with the Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic glacial epochs, respectively. 

In contrast, the Protopangea–Paleopangea theory shows that these glaciations correlated with periods of low continental velocity, and it is concluded that a fall in tectonic and corresponding volcanic activity was responsible for these intervals of global frigidity. During the accumulation of supercontinents with times of regional uplift, glacial epochs seem to be rare with little supporting evidence. However, the lack of evidence does not allow for the conclusion that glacial epochs are not associated with the collisional assembly of supercontinents. This could just represent a preservation bias.

During the late Ordovician (~458.4 Ma), the particular configuration of Gondwana may have allowed for glaciation and high CO2 levels to occur at the same time. However, some geologists disagree and think that there was a temperature increase at this time. This increase may have been strongly influenced by the movement of Gondwana across the South Pole, which may have prevented lengthy snow accumulation. Although late Ordovician temperatures at the South Pole may have reached freezing, there were no ice sheets during the early Silurian through the late Mississippian Agreement can be met with the theory that continental snow can occur when the edge of a continent is near the pole. Therefore Gondwana, although located tangent to the South Pole, may have experienced glaciation along its coasts.

===Precipitation===

Though precipitation rates during monsoonal circulations are difficult to predict, there is evidence for a large orographic barrier within the interior of Pangaea during the late Paleozoic The possibility of the southwest–northeast trending Appalachian-Hercynian Mountains makes the region&#x27;s monsoonal circulations potentially relatable to present-day monsoonal circulations surrounding the Tibetan Plateau, which is known to positively influence the magnitude of monsoonal periods within Eurasia. It is therefore somewhat expected that lower topography in other regions of the supercontinent during the Jurassic would negatively influence precipitation variations. The breakup of supercontinents may have affected local precipitation. When any supercontinent breaks up, there will be an increase in precipitation runoff over the surface of the continental landmasses, increasing silicate weathering and the consumption of CO2.

===Temperature===

Even though during the Archaean solar radiation was reduced by 30 percent and the Cambrian-Precambrian boundary by 6 percent, the Earth has only experienced three ice ages throughout the Precambrian. Erroneous conclusions are more likely to be made when models are limited to one climatic configuration (which is usually present-day).

Cold winters in continental interiors are due to rate ratios of radiative cooling (greater) and heat transport from continental rims. To raise winter temperatures within continental interiors, the rate of heat transport must increase to become greater than the rate of radiative cooling. Through climate models, alterations in atmospheric CO2 content and ocean heat transport are not comparatively effective.

CO2 models suggest that values were low in the late Cenozoic and Carboniferous-Permian glaciations. Although early Paleozoic values are much larger (more than 10 percent higher than that of today). This may be due to high seafloor spreading rates after the breakup of Precambrian supercontinents and the lack of land plants as a carbon sink.

During the late Permian, it is expected that seasonal Pangaean temperatures varied drastically. Subtropic summer temperatures were warmer than that of today by as much as 6–10 degrees, and mid-latitudes in the winter were less than −30 degrees Celsius. These seasonal changes within the supercontinent were influenced by the large size of Pangaea. And, just like today, coastal regions experienced much less variation.

During the Jurassic, summer temperatures did not rise above zero degrees Celsius along the northern rim of Laurasia, which was the northernmost part of Pangaea (the southernmost portion of Pangaea was Gondwana). Ice-rafted dropstones sourced from Russia are indicators of this northern boundary. The Jurassic is thought to have been approximately 10 degrees Celsius warmer along 90 degrees East paleolongitude compared to the present temperature of today&#x27;s central Eurasia.

===Milankovitch cycles===

Many studies of the Milankovitch cycles during supercontinent time periods have focused on the mid-Cretaceous. Present amplitudes of Milankovitch cycles over present-day Eurasia may be mirrored in both the southern and northern hemispheres of the supercontinent Pangaea. Climate modeling shows that summer fluctuations varied 14–16 degrees Celsius on Pangaea, which is similar or slightly higher than summer temperatures of Eurasia during the Pleistocene. The largest-amplitude Milankovitch cycles are expected to have been at mid-to high-latitudes during the Triassic and Jurassic.

=== Atmospheric gases ===
Plate tectonics and the chemical composition of the atmosphere (specifically greenhouse gases) are the two most prevailing factors present within the geologic time scale. Continental drift influences both cold and warm climatic episodes. Atmospheric circulation and climate are strongly influenced by the location and formation of continents and supercontinents. Therefore, continental drift influences mean global temperature.

Oxygen levels of the Archaean were negligible, and today they are roughly 21 percent. It is thought that the Earth&#x27;s oxygen content has risen in stages: six or seven steps that are timed very closely to the development of Earth&#x27;s supercontinents.
# Continents collide
# Super-mountains form
# Erosion of super-mountains
# Large quantities of minerals and nutrients wash out to open ocean
# Explosion of marine algae life (partly sourced from noted nutrients)
# Mass amounts of oxygen produced during photosynthesis
The process of Earth&#x27;s increase in atmospheric oxygen content is theorized to have started with the continent-continent collision of huge landmasses forming supercontinents, and therefore possibly supercontinent mountain ranges (super-mountains). These super-mountains would have eroded, and the mass amounts of nutrients, including iron and phosphorus, would have washed into oceans, just as is seen happening today. The oceans would then be rich in nutrients essential to photosynthetic organisms, which would then be able to respire mass amounts of oxygen. There is an apparent direct relationship between orogeny and the atmospheric oxygen content. There is also evidence for increased sedimentation concurrent with the timing of these mass oxygenation events, meaning that the organic carbon and pyrite at these times were more likely to be buried beneath sediment and therefore unable to react with the free oxygen. This sustained the atmospheric oxygen increases.

At there was an increase in molybdenum isotope fractionation. It was temporary but supports the increase in atmospheric oxygen because molybdenum isotopes require free oxygen to fractionate. Between 2.45 and the second period of oxygenation occurred, which has been called the &#x27;great oxygenation event.&#x27; Evidence supporting this event includes red beds appearance (meaning that Fe3+ was being produced and became an important component in soils). 

The third oxygenation stage approximately is indicated by the disappearance of iron formations. Neodymium isotopic studies suggest that iron formations are usually from continental sources, meaning that dissolved Fe and Fe2+ had to be transported during continental erosion. A rise in atmospheric oxygen prevents Fe transport, so the lack of iron formations may have been the result of an increase in oxygen. The fourth oxygenation event, roughly is based on modeled rates of sulfur isotopes from marine carbonate-associated sulfates. An increase (near doubled concentration) of sulfur isotopes, which is suggested by these models, would require an increase in the oxygen content of the deep oceans. 

Between 650 and there were three increases in ocean oxygen levels, this period is the fifth oxygenation stage. One of the reasons indicating this period to be an oxygenation event is the increase in redox-sensitive molybdenum in black shales. The sixth event occurred between 360 and and was identified by models suggesting shifts in the balance of 34S in sulfates and 13C in carbonates, which were strongly influenced by an increase in atmospheric oxygen.

==Proxies==
Granites and detrital zircons have notably similar and episodic appearances in the rock record. Their fluctuations correlate with Precambrian supercontinent cycles. The U–Pb zircon dates from orogenic granites are among the most reliable aging determinants. 

Some issues exist with relying on granite sourced zircons, such as a lack of evenly globally sourced data and the loss of granite zircons by sedimentary coverage or plutonic consumption. Where granite zircons are less adequate, detrital zircons from sandstones appear and make up for the gaps. These detrital zircons are taken from the sands of major modern rivers and their drainage basins. Oceanic magnetic anomalies and paleomagnetic data are the primary resources used for reconstructing continent and supercontinent locations back to roughly 150 Ma.

<text>A slide rule is a hand-operated mechanical calculator consisting of slidable rulers for evaluating mathematical operations such as multiplication, division, exponents, roots, logarithms, and trigonometry. It is one of the simplest analog computers.

Slide rules exist in a diverse range of styles and generally appear in a linear, circular or cylindrical form. Slide rules manufactured for specialized fields such as aviation or finance typically feature additional scales that aid in specialized calculations particular to those fields. The slide rule is closely related to nomograms used for application-specific computations. Though similar in name and appearance to a standard ruler, the slide rule is not meant to be used for measuring length or drawing straight lines. It is not designed for addition or subtraction. Maximum accuracy for standard linear slide rules is about three decimal significant digits, while scientific notation is used to keep track of the order of magnitude of results.

English mathematician and clergyman Reverend William Oughtred and others developed the slide rule in the 17th century based on the emerging work on logarithms by John Napier. It made calculations faster and less error-prone than evaluating on paper. Before the advent of the scientific pocket calculator, it was the most commonly used calculation tool in science and engineering. The slide rule&#x27;s ease of use, ready availability, and low cost caused its use to continue to grow through the 1950s and 1960s, even as desktop electronic computers were gradually introduced. But after the handheld scientific calculator was introduced in 1972 and became inexpensive in the mid-1970s, slide rules became largely obsolete, so most suppliers departed the business.

In the United States, the slide rule is colloquially called a slipstick.

==Basic concepts==
Each ruler&#x27;s scale has graduations labeled with precomputed outputs of various mathematical functions, acting as a lookup table that maps from position on the ruler as each function&#x27;s input. Calculations that can be reduced to simple addition or subtraction using those precomputed functions can be solved by aligning the two rulers and reading the approximate result.

For example, a number to be multiplied on one logarithmic-scale ruler can be aligned with the start of another such ruler to sum their logarithms. Then by applying the law of the logarithm of a product, the product of the two numbers can be read. More elaborate slide rules can perform other calculations, such as square roots, exponentials, logarithms, and trigonometric functions.

The user may estimate the location of the decimal point in the result by mentally interpolating between labeled graduations. Scientific notation is used to track the decimal point for more precise calculations. Addition and subtraction steps in a calculation are generally done mentally or on paper, not on the slide rule.

=== Components ===
Most slide rules consist of three parts:
* Frame or base two strips of the same length held parallel with a gap between.
* Slide a center strip interlocked with the frame that can move lengthwise relative to the frame.
* Runner or glass an exterior sliding piece with a hairline, also known as the &quot;cursor&quot;.

Some slide rules (&quot;duplex&quot; models) have scales on both sides of the rule and slide strip, others on one side of the outer strips and both sides of the slide strip (which can usually be pulled out, flipped over and reinserted for convenience), still others on one side only (&quot;simplex&quot; rules). A sliding with a vertical alignment line is used to find corresponding points on scales that are not adjacent to each other or, in duplex models, are on the other side of the rule. The cursor can also record an intermediate result on any of the scales.

=== Decades ===
Scales may be grouped in decades, where each decade corresponds to a range of numbers that spans a ratio of 10 (i.e. a range from 10&quot;n&quot; to 10&quot;n&quot;+1). For example, the range 1 to 10 is a single decade, and the range from 10 to 100 is another decade. Thus, single-decade scales (named C and D) range from 1 to 10 across the entire length of the slide rule, while double-decade scales (named A and B) range from 1 to 100 over the length of the slide rule.

==Operation==

=== Logarithmic scales ===
The following logarithmic identities transform the operations of multiplication and division to addition and subtraction, respectively:

formula_1formula_2 

==== Multiplication ====
With two logarithmic scales, the act of positioning the top scale to start at the bottom scale&#x27;s label for formula_3 corresponds to shifting the top logarithmic scale by a distance of formula_4. This aligns each top scale&#x27;s number formula_5 at offset formula_6 with the bottom scale&#x27;s number at position formula_7. Because formula_8, the mark on the bottom scale at that position corresponds to formula_9. With and for example, by positioning the top scale to start at the bottom scale&#x27;s , the result of the multiplication can then be read on the bottom scale under the top scale&#x27;s :

While the above example lies within one decade, users must mentally account for additional zeroes when dealing with multiple decades. For example, the answer to is found by first positioning the top scale to start above the 2 of the bottom scale, and then reading the marking 1.4 off the bottom two-decade scale where is on the top scale:

But since the is above the &quot;second&quot; set of numbers that number &quot;must&quot; be multiplied by . Thus, even though the answer directly reads , the correct answer is .

For an example with even larger numbers, to multiply , the top scale is again positioned to start at the on the bottom scale. Since represents , all numbers in that scale are multiplied by . Thus, any answer in the &quot;second&quot; set of numbers is multiplied by . Since in the top scale represents , the answer must additionally be multiplied by . The answer directly reads . Multiply by and then by to get the actual answer: .

In general, the on the top is moved to a factor on the bottom, and the answer is read off the bottom where the other factor is on the top. This works because the distances from the mark are proportional to the logarithms of the marked values.

==== Division ====
The illustration below demonstrates the computation of . The on the top scale is placed over the on the bottom scale. The resulting quotient, , can then be read below the top scale&#x27;s :

There is more than one method for doing division, and the method presented here has the advantage that the final result cannot be off-scale, because one has a choice of using the at either end.

With more complex calculations involving multiple factors in the numerator and denominator of an expression, movement of the scales can be minimized by alternating divisions and multiplications. Thus would be computed as and the result, , can be read beneath the in the top scale in the figure above, without the need to register the intermediate result for .

==== Solving Proportions ====

Because pairs of numbers that are aligned on the logarithmic scales form constant ratios, no matter how the scales are offset, slide rules can be used to generate equivalent fractions that solve proportion and percent problems.

For example, setting 7.5 on one scale over 10 on the other scale, the user can see that at the same time 1.5 is over 2, 2.25 is over 3, 3 is over 4, 3.75 is over 6, 4.5 is over 6, and 6 is over 8, among other pairs. For a real-life situation where 750 represents a whole 100%, these readings could be interpreted to suggest that 150 is 20%, 225 is 30%, 300 is 40%, 375 is 50%, 450 is 60%, and 600 is 80%.

===Other scales===

In addition to the logarithmic scales, some slide rules have other mathematical functions encoded on other auxiliary scales. The most popular are trigonometric, usually sine and tangent, common logarithm (log) (for taking the log of a value on a multiplier scale), natural logarithm (ln) and exponential (&quot;ex&quot;) scales. Others feature scales for calculating hyperbolic functions. On linear rules, the scales and their labeling are highly standardized, with variation usually occurring only in terms of which scales are included and in what order.


The Binary Slide Rule manufactured by Gilson in 1931 performed an addition and subtraction function limited to fractions.

====Roots and powers====
There are single-decade (C and D), double-decade (A and B), and triple-decade (K) scales. To compute formula_10, for example, locate x on the D scale and read its square on the A scale. Inverting this process allows square roots to be found, and similarly for the powers 3, 1/3, 2/3, and 3/2. Care must be taken when the base, x, is found in more than one place on its scale. For instance, there are two nines on the A scale; to find the square root of nine, use the first one; the second one gives the square root of 90.

For formula_11 problems, use the LL scales. When several LL scales are present, use the one with &quot;x&quot; on it. First, align the leftmost 1 on the C scale with x on the LL scale. Then, find &quot;y&quot; on the C scale and go down to the LL scale with &quot;x&quot; on it. That scale will indicate the answer. If &quot;y&quot; is &quot;off the scale&quot;, locate formula_12 and square it using the A and B scales as described above. Alternatively, use the rightmost 1 on the C scale, and read the answer off the next higher LL scale. For example, aligning the rightmost 1 on the C scale with 2 on the LL2 scale, 3 on the C scale lines up with 8 on the LL3 scale.

To extract a cube root using a slide rule with only C/D and A/B scales, align 1 on the B cursor with the base number on the A scale (taking care as always to distinguish between the lower and upper halves of the A scale). Slide the slide until the number on the D scale which is against 1 on the C cursor is the same as the number on the B cursor which is against the base number on the A scale. (Examples: A 8, B 2, C 1, D 2; A 27, B 3, C 1, D 3.)

====Roots of quadratic equations====
Quadratic equations of the form formula_13 can be solved by first reducing the equation to the form formula_14 (where formula_15 and formula_16), and then aligning the index (&quot;1&quot;) of the C scale to the value formula_17 on the D scale. The cursor is then moved along the rule until a position is found where the numbers on the CI and D scales add up to formula_18. These two values are the roots of the equation.

====Future value of money====
The LLN scales can be used to compute and compare the cost or return on a fixed rate loan or investment.
The simplest case is for continuously compounded interest. Example: Taking D as the interest rate in percent,
slide the index (the &quot;1&quot; at the right or left end of the scale) of C to the percent on D. The corresponding value on LL2 directly below the index will be the multiplier for 10 cycles of interest (typically years). The value on LL2 below 2 on the C scale will be the multiplier after 20 cycles, and so on.

====Trigonometry====
The S, T, and ST scales are used for trig functions and multiples of trig functions, for angles in degrees.

For angles from around 5.7 up to 90 degrees, sines are found by comparing the S scale with C (or D) scale. (On many closed-body rules the S scale relates to the A and B scales instead and covers angles from around 0.57 up to 90 degrees; what follows must be adjusted appropriately.) The S scale has a second set of angles (sometimes in a different color), which run in the opposite direction, and are used for cosines. Tangents are found by comparing the T scale with the C (or D) scale for angles less than 45 degrees. For angles greater than 45 degrees the CI scale is used. Common forms such as formula_19 can be read directly from &quot;x&quot; on the S scale to the result on the D scale, when the C scale index is set at &quot;k&quot;. For angles below 5.7 degrees, sines, tangents, and radians are approximately equal, and are found on the ST or SRT (sines, radians, and tangents) scale, or simply divided by 57.3 degrees/radian. Inverse trigonometric functions are found by reversing the process.

Many slide rules have S, T, and ST scales marked with degrees and minutes (e.g. some Keuffel and Esser models (Doric duplex 5&quot; models, for example), late-model Teledyne-Post Mannheim-type rules). So-called &quot;decitrig&quot; models use decimal fractions of degrees instead.

====Logarithms and exponentials====
Base-10 logarithms and exponentials are found using the L scale, which is linear. Some slide rules have a Ln scale, which is for base e. Logarithms to any other base can be calculated by reversing the procedure for calculating powers of a number. For example, log2 values can be determined by lining up either leftmost or rightmost 1 on the C scale with 2 on the LL2 scale, finding the number whose logarithm is to be calculated on the corresponding LL scale, and reading the log2 value on the C scale.

====Addition and subtraction====
Addition and subtraction aren&#x27;t typically performed on slide rules, but is possible using either of the following two techniques:

# Converting addition and subtraction to division (required for the C and D or comparable scales):
#* Exploits the identity that the quotient of two variables plus (or minus) one times the divisor equals their sum (or difference):formula_20
#* This is similar to the addition/subtraction technique used for high-speed electronic circuits with a logarithmic number system in specialized computer applications like the Gravity Pipe (GRAPE) supercomputer and hidden Markov models.
# Using a linear L scale (available on some models):
#* After sliding the cursor right (for addition) or left (for subtraction) and returning the slide to 0, the result can be read.

===Generalizations===

Using (almost) any strictly monotonic scales, other calculations can also be made with one movement. For example, reciprocal scales can be used for the equality formula_21 (calculating parallel resistances, harmonic mean, etc.), and quadratic scales can be used to solve formula_22.

==Physical design==

===Standard linear rules===

The width of the slide rule is quoted in terms of the nominal width of the scales. Scales on the most common &quot;10-inch&quot; models are actually 25 cm, as they were made to metric standards, though some rules offer slightly extended scales to simplify manipulation when a result overflows. Pocket rules are typically 5 inches (12 cm). Models a couple of metres (yards) wide were made to be hung in classrooms for teaching purposes.

Typically the divisions mark a scale to a precision of two significant figures, and the user estimates the third figure. Some high-end slide rules have magnifier cursors that make the markings easier to see. Such cursors can effectively double the accuracy of readings, permitting a 10-inch slide rule to serve as well as a 20-inch model.

Various other conveniences have been developed. Trigonometric scales are sometimes dual-labeled, in black and red, with complementary angles, the so-called &quot;Darmstadt&quot; style. Duplex slide rules often duplicate some of the scales on the back. Scales are often &quot;split&quot; to get higher accuracy. For example, instead of reading from an A scale to a D scale to find a square root, it may be possible to read from a D scale to an R1 scale running from 1 to square root of 10 or to an R2 scale running from square root of 10 to 10, where having more subdivisions marked can result in being able to read an answer with one more significant digit.

===Circular slide rules===
Circular slide rules come in two basic types, one with two cursors, and another with a free dish and one cursor. The dual cursor versions perform multiplication and division by holding a constant angle between the cursors as they are rotated around the dial. The onefold cursor version operates more like the standard slide rule through the appropriate alignment of the scales.

The basic advantage of a circular slide rule is that the widest dimension of the tool was reduced by a factor of about 3 (i.e. by π). For example, a circular would have a maximum precision approximately equal to a ordinary slide rule. Circular slide rules also eliminate &quot;off-scale&quot; calculations, because the scales were designed to &quot;wrap around&quot;; they never have to be reoriented when results are near 1.0—the rule is always on scale. However, for non-cyclical non-spiral scales such as S, T, and LL&#x27;s, the scale width is narrowed to make room for end margins.

Circular slide rules are mechanically more rugged and smoother-moving, but their scale alignment precision is sensitive to the centering of a central pivot; a minute off-centre of the pivot can result in a worst case alignment error. The pivot does prevent scratching of the face and cursors. The highest accuracy scales are placed on the outer rings. Rather than &quot;split&quot; scales, high-end circular rules use spiral scales for more complex operations like log-of-log scales. One eight-inch premium circular rule had a 50-inch spiral log-log scale. Around 1970, an inexpensive model from B. C. Boykin (Model 510) featured 20 scales, including 50-inch C-D (multiplication) and log scales. The RotaRule featured a friction brake for the cursor.

The main disadvantages of circular slide rules are the difficulty in locating figures along a dish, and limited number of scales. Another drawback of circular slide rules is that less-important scales are closer to the center, and have lower precisions. Most students learned slide rule use on the linear slide rules, and did not find reason to switch.

One slide rule remaining in daily use around the world is the E6-B. This is a circular slide rule first created in the 1930s for aircraft pilots to help with dead reckoning. With the aid of scales printed on the frame it also helps with such miscellaneous tasks as converting time, distance, speed, and temperature values, compass errors, and calculating fuel use. The so-called &quot;prayer wheel&quot; is still available in flight shops, and remains widely used. While GPS has reduced the use of dead reckoning for aerial navigation, and handheld calculators have taken over many of its functions, the E6-B remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students have some degree of proficiency in its use.

Proportion wheels are simple circular slide rules used in graphic design to calculate aspect ratios. Lining up the original and desired size values on the inner and outer wheels will display their ratio as a percentage in a small window. Though not as common since the advent of computerized layout, they 

In 1952, Swiss watch company Breitling introduced a pilot&#x27;s wristwatch with an integrated circular slide rule specialized for flight calculations: the Breitling Navitimer. The Navitimer circular rule, referred to by Breitling as a &quot;navigation computer&quot;, featured airspeed, rate/time of climb/descent, flight time, distance, and fuel consumption functions, as well as kilometer—nautical mile and gallon—liter fuel amount conversion functions.


===Cylindrical slide rules===
There are two main types of cylindrical slide rules: those with helical scales such as the Fuller calculator, the Otis King and the Bygrave slide rule, and those with bars, such as the Thacher and some Loga models. In either case, the advantage is a much longer scale, and hence potentially greater precision, than afforded by a straight or circular rule.
===Materials===
Traditionally slide rules were made out of hard wood such as mahogany or boxwood with cursors of glass and metal. At least one high precision instrument was made of steel.

In 1895, a Japanese firm, Hemmi, started to make slide rules from celluloid-clad bamboo, which had the advantages of being dimensionally stable, strong, and naturally self-lubricating. These bamboo slide rules were introduced in Sweden in September, 1933, and probably only a little earlier in Germany.

Scales were also made of celluloid or other polymers, or printed on aluminium. Later cursors were molded from acrylics or polycarbonate, sometimes with Teflon bearing surfaces. 

All premium slide rules had numbers and scales deeply engraved, and then filled with paint or other resin. Painted or imprinted slide rules were viewed as inferior, because the markings could wear off or be chemically damaged. Nevertheless, Pickett, an American slide rule company, made only printed scale rules. Premium slide rules included clever mechanical catches so the rule would not fall apart by accident, and bumpers to protect the scales and cursor from rubbing on tabletops.

==History==
The slide rule was invented around 1620–1630, shortly after John Napier&#x27;s publication of the concept of the logarithm. In 1620 Edmund Gunter of Oxford developed a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale; with additional measuring tools it could be used to multiply and divide. In c. 1622, William Oughtred of Cambridge combined two handheld Gunter rules to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule. Oughtred became involved in a vitriolic controversy over priority, with his one-time student Richard Delamain and the prior claims of Wingate. Oughtred&#x27;s ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653.

In 1677, Henry Coggeshall created a two-foot folding rule for timber measure, called the Coggeshall slide rule, expanding the slide rule&#x27;s use beyond mathematical inquiry.

In 1722, Warner introduced the two- and three-decade scales, and in 1755 Everard included an inverted scale; a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a &quot;polyphase&quot; rule.

In 1815, Peter Mark Roget invented the log log slide rule, which included a scale displaying the logarithm of the logarithm. This allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and exponents. This was especially useful for fractional powers.

In 1821, Nathaniel Bowditch, described in the &quot;American Practical Navigator&quot; a &quot;sliding rule&quot; that contained scaled trigonometric functions on the fixed part and a line of log-sines and log-tans on the slider used to solve navigation problems.

In 1845, Paul Cameron of Glasgow introduced a nautical slide rule capable of answering navigation questions, including right ascension and declination of the sun and principal stars.

===Modern form===
A more modern form of slide rule was created in 1859 by French artillery lieutenant Amédée Mannheim, who was fortunate both in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation, and its adoption by the French Artillery. Mannheim&#x27;s rule had two major modifications that made it easier to use than previous general-purpose slide rules. Such rules had four basic scales, A, B, C, and D, and D was the only single-decade logarithmic scale; C had two decades, like A and B. Most operations were done on the A and B scales; D was only used for finding squares and square roots. 

Mannheim changed the C scale to a single-decade scale and performed most operations with C and D instead of A and B. Because the C and D scales were single-decade, they could be read more precisely, so the rule&#x27;s results could be more accurate. The change also made it easier to include squares and square roots as part of a larger calculation. Mannheim&#x27;s rule also had a cursor, unlike almost all preceding rules, so any of the scales could be easily and accurately compared across the rule width. The &quot;Mannheim rule&quot; became the standard slide rule arrangement for the later 19th century and remained a common standard throughout the slide-rule era.

The growth of the engineering profession during the later 19th century drove widespread slide-rule use, beginning in Europe and eventually taking hold in the United States as well. The duplex rule was invented by William Cox in 1891 and was produced by Keuffel and Esser Co. of New York.

In 1881, the American inventor Edwin Thacher introduced his cylindrical rule, which had a much longer scale than standard linear rules and thus could calculate to higher precision, about four to five significant digits. However, the Thacher rule was quite expensive, as well as being non-portable, so it was used in far more limited numbers than conventional slide rules.

Astronomical work also required precise computations, and, in 19th-century Germany, a steel slide rule about two meters long was used at one observatory. It had a microscope attached, giving it accuracy to six decimal places.

===20th century===
In the 1920s, the novelist and engineer Nevil Shute Norway (he called his autobiography &quot;Slide Rule&quot;) was &quot;Chief Calculator&quot; on the design of the British R100 airship for Vickers Ltd. from 1924. The stress calculations for each transverse frame required computations by a pair of &quot;calculators&quot; (people) using Fuller&#x27;s cylindrical slide rules for two or three months. The simultaneous equation contained up to seven unknown quantities, took about a week to solve, and had to be repeated with a different selection of slack wires if the guess on which of the eight radial wires were slack was wrong and one of the wires guessed to be slack was not slack. After months of labour filling perhaps fifty foolscap sheets with calculations &quot;the truth stood revealed (and) produced a satisfaction almost amounting to a religious experience&quot;.

In 1937, physicist Lucy Hayner designed and constructed a circular slide rule in Braille.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the slide rule was the symbol of the engineer&#x27;s profession in the same way the stethoscope is that of the medical profession.

Aluminium Pickett-brand slide rules were carried on Project Apollo space missions. The model N600-ES owned by Buzz Aldrin that flew with him to the Moon on Apollo 11 was sold at auction in 2007. The model N600-ES taken along on Apollo 13 in 1970 is owned by the National Air and Space Museum.

Some engineering students and engineers carried ten-inch slide rules in belt holsters, a common sight on campuses even into the mid-1970s. Until the advent of the pocket digital calculator, students also might keep a ten- or twenty-inch rule for precision work at home or the office while carrying a five-inch pocket slide rule around with them.

In 2004, education researchers David B. Sher and Dean C. Nataro conceived a new type of slide rule based on &quot;prosthaphaeresis&quot;, an algorithm for rapidly computing products that predates logarithms. However, there has been little practical interest in constructing one beyond the initial prototype.

===Specialized calculators===
Slide rules have often been specialized to varying degrees for their field of use, such as excise, proof calculation, engineering, navigation, etc., and some slide rules are extremely specialized for very narrow applications. For example, the John Rabone &amp; Sons 1892 catalog lists a &quot;Measuring Tape and Cattle Gauge&quot;, a device to estimate the weight of a cow from its measurements.

There were many specialized slide rules for photographic applications. For example, the actinograph of Hurter and Driffield was a two-slide boxwood, brass, and cardboard device for estimating exposure from time of day, time of year, and latitude.

Specialized slide rules were invented for various forms of engineering, business and banking. These often had common calculations directly expressed as special scales, for example loan calculations, optimal purchase quantities, or particular engineering equations. For example, the Fisher Controls company distributed a customized slide rule adapted to solving the equations used for selecting the proper size of industrial flow control valves.

Pilot balloon slide rules were used by meteorologists in weather services to determine the upper wind velocities from an ascending hydrogen or helium-filled pilot balloon.

The E6-B is a circular slide rule used by pilots and navigators.

Circular slide rules to estimate ovulation dates and fertility are known as &quot;wheel calculators&quot;.

A Department of Defense publication from 1962 infamously included a special-purpose circular slide rule for calculating blast effects, overpressure, and radiation exposure from a given yield of an atomic bomb.

===Decline===
The importance of the slide rule began to diminish as electronic computers, a new but rare resource in the 1950s, became more widely available to technical workers during the 1960s.

The first step away from slide rules was the introduction of relatively inexpensive electronic desktop scientific calculators. These included the Wang Laboratories LOCI-2, introduced in 1965, which used logarithms for multiplication and division; and the Hewlett-Packard HP 9100A, introduced in 1968. Both of these were programmable and provided exponential and logarithmic functions; the HP had trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, and tangent) and hyperbolic trigonometric functions as well. The HP used the CORDIC (coordinate rotation digital computer) algorithm, which allows for calculation of trigonometric functions using only shift and add operations. This method facilitated the development of ever smaller scientific calculators.

As with mainframe computing, the availability of these desktop machines did not significantly affect the ubiquitous use of the slide rule, until cheap hand-held scientific electronic calculators became available in the mid-1970s, at which point it rapidly declined. The pocket-sized Hewlett-Packard HP-35 scientific calculator was the first handheld device of its type, but it cost US$395 in 1972. This was justifiable for some engineering professionals, but too expensive for most students.

Around 1974, lower-cost handheld electronic scientific calculators started to make slide rules largely obsolete. By 1975, basic four-function electronic calculators could be purchased for less than $50, and by 1976 the TI-30 scientific calculator was sold for less than $25 ($ adjusted for inflation).

1980 was the final year of the University Interscholastic League (UIL) competition in Texas to use slide rules. The UIL had been originally been organized in 1910 to administer literary events, but had become the governing body of school sports events as well.

==Comparison to electronic digital calculators==

Even during their heyday, slide rules never caught on with the general public. Addition and subtraction are not well-supported operations on slide rules and doing a calculation on a slide rule tends to be slower than on a calculator. This led engineers to use mathematical equations that favored operations that were easy on a slide rule over more accurate but complex functions; these approximations could lead to inaccuracies and mistakes. On the other hand, the spatial, manual operation of slide rules cultivates in the user an intuition for numerical relationships and scale that people who have used only digital calculators often lack. A slide rule will also display all the terms of a calculation along with the result, thus eliminating uncertainty about what calculation was actually performed. It has thus been compared with reverse Polish notation (RPN) implemented in electronic calculators.

A slide rule requires the user to separately compute the order of magnitude of the answer to position the decimal point in the results. For example, 1.5 × 30 (which equals 45) will show the same result as  × 0.03 (which equals ). This separate calculation forces the user to keep track of magnitude in short-term memory (which is error-prone), keep notes (which is cumbersome) or reason about it in every step (which distracts from the other calculation requirements).

The typical arithmetic precision of a slide rule is about three significant digits, compared to many digits on digital calculators. As order of magnitude gets the greatest prominence when using a slide rule, users are less likely to make errors of false precision.

When performing a sequence of multiplications or divisions by the same number, the answer can often be determined by merely glancing at the slide rule without any manipulation. This can be especially useful when calculating percentages (e.g. for test scores) or when comparing prices (e.g. in dollars per kilogram). Multiple speed-time-distance calculations can be performed hands-free at a glance with a slide rule. Other useful linear conversions such as pounds to kilograms can be easily marked on the rule and used directly in calculations.

Being entirely mechanical, a slide rule does not depend on grid electricity or batteries. Mechanical imprecision in slide rules that were poorly constructed or warped by heat or use will lead to errors.

Many sailors keep slide rules as backups for navigation in case of electric failure or battery depletion on long route segments. Slide rules are still commonly used in aviation, particularly for smaller planes. They are being replaced only by integrated, special purpose and expensive flight computers, and not general-purpose calculators. The E6-B circular slide rule used by pilots has been in continuous production and remains available in a variety of models. Some wrist watches designed for aviation use still feature slide rule scales to permit quick calculations. The Citizen Skyhawk AT and the Seiko Flightmaster SNA411 are two notable examples.

==Contemporary use==

Even in the 21st century, some people prefer a slide rule over an electronic calculator as a practical computing device. Others keep their old slide rules out of a sense of nostalgia, or collect them as a hobby.

A popular collectible model is the Keuffel &amp; Esser &quot;Deci-Lon&quot;, a premium scientific and engineering slide rule available both in a ten-inch (25 cm) &quot;regular&quot; (&quot;Deci-Lon 10&quot;) and a five-inch &quot;pocket&quot; (&quot;Deci-Lon 5&quot;) variant. Another prized American model is the eight-inch (20 cm) Scientific Instruments circular rule. Of European rules, Faber-Castell&#x27;s high-end models are the most popular among collectors.

Although a great many slide rules are circulating on the market, specimens in good condition tend to be expensive. Many rules found for sale on online auction sites are damaged or have missing parts, and the seller may not know enough to supply the relevant information. Replacement parts are scarce, expensive, and generally available only for separate purchase on individual collectors&#x27; web sites. The Keuffel and Esser rules from the period up to about 1950 are particularly problematic, because the end-pieces on the cursors, made of celluloid, tend to chemically break down over time. Methods of preserving plastic may be used to slow the deterioration of some older slide rules, and 3D printing may be used to recreate missing or irretrievably broken cursor parts.

There are still a handful of sources for brand new slide rules. The Concise Company of Tokyo, which began as a manufacturer of circular slide rules in July 1954, continues to make and sell them today. In September 2009, on-line retailer ThinkGeek introduced its own brand of straight slide rules, described as &quot;faithful replica[s]&quot; that were &quot;individually hand tooled&quot;. These were no longer available in 2012. In addition, Faber-Castell had a number of slide rules in inventory, available for international purchase through their web store, until mid 2018. Proportion wheels are still used in graphic design.

Various slide rule simulator apps are available for Android and iOS-based smart phones and tablets.

Specialized slide rules such as the E6-B used in aviation, and gunnery slide rules used in laying artillery are still used though no longer on a routine basis. These rules are used as part of the teaching and instruction process as in learning to use them the student also learns about the principles behind the calculations, it also allows the student to be able to use these instruments as a backup in the event that the modern electronics in general use fail.

==Collections==

The MIT Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has a collection of hundreds of slide rules, nomograms, and mechanical calculators. The Keuffel and Esser Company collection, from the slide rule manufacturer formerly located in Hoboken, New Jersey, was donated to MIT around 2005, substantially expanding existing holdings. Selected items from the collection are usually on display at the museum.

The International Slide Rule Museum is claimed to be &quot;[the world&#x27;s] most extensive resource for all things concerning slide rules and logarithmic calculators&quot;. The museum&#x27;s Web page includes extensive literature relative to slide rules in its &quot;Slide Rule Library&quot; section.

<doc id="28745" wikidata="Q542758" url="?curid=28745" title="Styx">
<text>In Greek mythology, Styx (; ; lit. &quot;Shuddering&quot;), also called the River Styx, is a goddess and one of the rivers of the Greek Underworld. Her parents were the Titans Oceanus and Tethys, and she was the wife of the Titan Pallas and the mother of Zelus, Nike, Kratos, and Bia. She sided with Zeus in his war against the Titans, and because of this, to honor her, Zeus decreed that the solemn oaths of the gods be sworn by the water of Styx.

==Family==
According to the usual account, Styx was the eldest of the Oceanids, the many daughters of the Titan Oceanus, the great world-encircling river, and his sister-wife, the Titaness Tethys. However, according to the Roman mythographer Hyginus, she was the daughter of Nox (&quot;Night&quot;, the Roman equivalent of Nyx) and Erebus (Darkness).

She married the Titan Pallas and by him gave birth to the personifications Zelus (Glory, Emulation), Nike (Victory), Kratos (Strength, Dominion), and Bia (Force, Violence). The geographer Pausanias tells us that, according to Epimenides of Crete, Styx was the mother of the monster Echidna, by an otherwise unknown Perias.

Although usually Demeter was the mother, by Zeus, of the underworld-goddess Persephone, according to the mythographer Apollodorus, it was Styx. However, when Apollodorus relates the famous story of the abduction of Persephone, and the search for her by her angry and distraught mother, as usual, it is Demeter who conducts the search.

==Mythology==
===Oath of the gods===
Styx was the oath of the gods. Homer calls Styx the &quot;dread river of oath&quot;. In both the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, it is said that swearing by the water of Styx, is &quot;the greatest and most dread oath for the blessed gods&quot;. Homer has Hera (in the &quot;Iliad&quot;) say this when she swears by Styx to Zeus, that she is not to blame for Poseidon&#x27;s intervention on the side of the Greeks in the Trojan War, and he has Calypso (in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;) use the same words when she swears by Styx to Odysseus that she will cease to plot against him. Also Hypnos (in the &quot;Iliad&quot;) makes Hera swear to him &quot;by the inviolable water of Styx&quot;.

Examples of oaths sworn by Styx also occur in the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;. Demeter asks the &quot;implacable&quot; water of Styx to be her witness, as she swears to Metaneira, Leto swears to the personified Delos by the water of Styx, calling it the &quot;most powerful and dreadful oath that the blessed gods can swear&quot;, while Apollo asks Hermes to swear to him on the &quot;dread&quot; water of Styx.

Hesiod, in the &quot;Theogony&quot;, gives an account of how this role for Styx came about. He says that, during the Titanomachy, the great war of Zeus and his fellow Olympians against Cronus and his fellow Titans, Zeus summoned &quot;all the deathless gods to great Olympus&quot; and promised, to whosoever would join him against the Titans, that he would preserve whatever rights and offices each had, or if they had none under Cronus, they would be given both under his rule. Styx, upon the advice of her father Oceanus, was the first to side with Zeus, bringing her children by Pallas along with her. And so in return Zeus appointed Styx to be &quot;the great oath of the gods, and her children to live with him always.&quot;

According to Hesiod, Styx lived at the entrance to Hades, in a cave &quot;propped up to heaven all round with silver pillars&quot;. Hesiod also tells us that Zeus would send Iris, the messenger of the gods, to fetch the &quot;famous cold water&quot; of Styx for the gods to swear by, and describes the punishments which would follow the breaking of such an oath:
The Roman poet Ovid has Jove (the Roman equivalent of Zeus) swear by the waters of Styx when he promises Semele:

and was then obliged to follow through even though he realized to his horror that Semele&#x27;s request would lead to her death. Similarly Sol (the Roman equivalent of the Greek Helios) promised his son Phaethon whatever he desired, which also resulted in the boy&#x27;s death after he asked to drive his father&#x27;s chariot for a day.

===River===
The goddess Styx, like her father Oceanus, and his sons the river gods, was also a river, in her case, a river of the Underworld. According to Hesiod, Styx was given one-tenth of her father&#x27;s water, which flowed far underground, and came up to the surface to pour out from a high rock: 
In the &quot;Iliad&quot; the river Styx forms a boundary of Hades, the abode of the dead, in the Underworld. Athena mentions the &quot;sheer-falling waters of Styx&quot; needing to be crossed when Heracles returned from Hades after capturing Cerberus, and Patroclus&#x27;s shade begs Achilles to bury his corpse quickly so that he might &quot;pass within the gates of Hades&quot; and join the other dead &quot;beyond the River&quot;. So too in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, where the Styx winds nine times around the borders of Hades, and the boatman Charon is in charge of ferrying the dead across it. More usually, however, Acheron is the river (or lake) which separates the world of the living from the world of the dead.

In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Circe says that the Underworld river Cocytus is a branch of the Styx. In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, Phlegyas ferries Virgil and Dante across the foul waters of the river Styx which is portrayed as a marsh comprising the Hell&#x27;s Fifth Circle, where the angry and sullen are punished.

By metonymy, the adjective &quot;stygian&quot; () came to refer to anything unpleasantly dark, gloomy, or forbidding.

===Other===
In the &quot;Homeric Hymn&quot; 2 &quot;to Demeter&quot; Persephone names Styx as one of her &quot;frolicking&quot; Oceanid-companions when she was abducted by Hades.

According to the &quot;Achilleid&quot;, written by the Roman poet Statius in the 1st century AD, when Achilles was born his mother Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river Styx; however, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel. And so Paris was able to kill Achilles during the Trojan War by shooting an arrow into his heel.

In the second-century &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; of Apuleius, one of the impossible trials which Venus imposed on Psyche was to fetch water from the Styx. Apuleius has the water guarded by fierce dragons (&quot;dracones&quot;), and from the water itself came fearsome cries of deadly warning. The sheer impossibility of her task caused Psyche to become senseless, as if turned into stone. Jupiter&#x27;s eagle admonishes Psyche saying:
==The Arcadian Styx==
Styx, along with the underworld rivers Cocytus and Acheron, were associated with waterways in the upper world. For example, according to Homer, the river Titaressus, a tributary of the river Peneius in Thessaly, was a branch of the Styx. However Styx has been most commonly associated with an Arcadian stream and waterfall (the Mavronéri) that runs through a ravine on the North face of mount Chelmos and flows into the Krathis river. The fifth-century BC historian Herodotus, locates this stream—calling it &quot;the water of Styx&quot;—as being near Nonacris a town (in what was then ancient Arcadia and now modern Achaea) not far from Pheneus, and says that the Spartan king Cleomenes, would make men take oaths swearing by its water. Herodotus describes it as &quot;a stream of small appearance, dropping from a cliff into a pool; a wall of stones runs round the pool&quot;. Pausanias reports visiting the &quot;water of the Styx&quot; near Nonacris (which at the time of his visit, in the second century AD, was already a partially-buried ruins), saying that:

According to Aelian, Demeter caused the water of this Arcadian Styx &quot;to well up in the neighbourhood of Pheneus&quot;. An ancient legend apparently also connected Demeter with this Styx. According to Photius, a certain Ptolemy Hephaestion (probably referring to Ptolemy Chennus) knew of a story, &quot;concerning the water of the Styx in Arcadia&quot;, which told how an angry Demeter had turned the Styx&#x27;s water black. According to James George Frazer, this &quot;fable&quot; provided an explanation for the fact that, from a distance, the waterfall appears black.

Water from this Styx was said to be poisonous and able to dissolve most substances. The first-century natural philosopher Pliny, wrote that drinking its water caused immediate death, and that the hoof of a female mule was the only material not &quot;rotted&quot; by its water. According to Plutarch the poisonous water could only be held by an ass&#x27;s hoof, since all other vessels would &quot;be eaten through by it, owing to its coldness and pungency.&quot; While according to Pausanias, the only vessel that could hold the Styx&#x27;s water (poisonous to both men and animals) was a horse&#x27;s hoof. There were ancient suspicions that Alexander the Great&#x27;s death was caused by being poisoned with the water of this Styx.

The Arcadian Styx may have been named so after its mythological counterpart, but it is also possible that this Arcadian stream was the model for the mythological Styx. The latter seems to be the case, at least, for the Styx in Apuleius&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, which has Venus, addressing Psyche, give the following description:

That Apuleius has his &quot;black spring&quot; being guarded by dragons, also suggests a connection between his Styx and two modern local names for the waterfall: the Black Water (&quot;Mavro Nero&quot;) and the Dragon Water (&quot;Drako Nero&quot;).

==Moon==
On 2 July 2013, &quot;Styx&quot; officially became the name of one of Pluto&#x27;s moons. The other moons of Pluto (Charon, Nix, Hydra, and Kerberos) also have names from Greco-Roman mythology related to the underworld.

<doc id="28747" wikidata="Q193944" url="?curid=28747" title="Sangha">
<text>Sangha () is a Pali word used in many Indian languages, including Sanskrit which means &quot;association&quot;, &quot;assembly&quot;, &quot;company&quot; or &quot;community&quot;; in these languages, sangha is frequently used as a surname. In a political context, it was historically used to denote a governing assembly in a republic or a kingdom, and for a long time, it has been used by religious associations, including Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs. Given this history, some Buddhists have stated that the tradition of the &quot;sangha&quot; represents humanity&#x27;s oldest surviving democratic institution.

In Buddhism, &quot;sangha&quot; refers to the monastic communities of &quot;bhikkhu&quot; (monks) and &quot;bhikkhuni&quot; (nuns). These communities are traditionally referred to as the &quot;bhikkhu-sangha&quot; or the &quot;bhikkhuni-sangha&quot;. As a separate category, those Buddhists who have attained any of the four stages of enlightenment, whether or not they are members of the monastic community, are referred to as the &quot;āryasaṅgha&quot; (&quot;noble Sangha&quot;).

According to the Theravada school and Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism, the term &quot;sangha&quot; does not refer to the community of unenlightened sāvakas (lay followers) nor does it refer to the community of Buddhists as a whole. The Theravada school uses the term &quot;parisā&quot; (&quot;assembly&quot;) or &quot;catuparisā&quot; (&quot;fourfold assembly&quot;) to refer to the &quot;bhikkhu&quot;, &quot;bhikkhunī&quot;, &quot;upāsaka&quot;, and &quot;upāsikā&quot;.

==Definitions==
In a glossary of Buddhist terms, Richard Robinson et al. define sangha as:

Mahayana practitioners may use the word &quot;sangha&quot; as a collective term for all Buddhists, but the Theravada Pāli Canon uses the word &quot;parisā&quot; (Sanskrit &quot;pariṣad&quot;) for the larger Buddhist community—the monks, nuns, lay men, and lay women who have taken the Three Refuges—with a few exceptions reserving &quot;sangha&quot; for its original use in the Pāli Canon—the ideal (&quot;arya&quot;) and the conventional.


== Qualities of the Sangha ==

The &quot;Sangha&quot; is the third of the Three Refuges in Buddhism. Common over all schools is that the &quot;āryasaṅgha&quot; is the foremost form of this third jewel. As for its recognizable contemporary forms, the interpretation of what is the Jewel is often dependent on how a school defines Sangha. In many schools, for example, monastic life is considered to provide the safest and most suitable environment for advancing toward enlightenment and liberation due to the temptations and vicissitudes of life in the world.

In Buddhism, Gautama Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha each are described as having certain characteristics. These characteristics are chanted either on a daily basis and/or on Uposatha days, depending on the school of Buddhism. In Theravada tradition they are a part of daily chanting:

The Sangha: The Sangha of the Blessed One&#x27;s disciples (sāvakas) is:
# practicing the good way (&quot;Suppaṭipanno&quot;)
# practicing the upright way (&quot;Ujuppaṭipanno&quot;)
# practicing the knowledgeable or logical way (&quot;Ñāyappaṭipanno&quot;)
# practicing the proper way (&quot;Sāmīcippaṭipanno&quot;)

That is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals - This Sangha of the Blessed One&#x27;s disciples is:

# worthy of gifts (&quot;Āhuneyyo&quot;)
# worthy of hospitality (&quot;Pāhuneyyo&quot;)
# worthy of offerings (&quot;Dakkhiṇeyyo&quot;)
# worthy of reverential salutation (&quot;Añjalikaraṇīyo&quot;)
# the unsurpassed field of merit for the world (&quot;Anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassa&quot;).

== Monastic tradition ==

The Sangha was originally established by Gautama Buddha in the fifth century BCE in order to provide a means for those who wish to practice full-time in a direct and highly disciplined way, free from the restrictions and responsibilities of the household life. The Sangha also fulfils the function of preserving the Buddha&#x27;s original teachings and of providing spiritual support for the Buddhist lay-community. The Sangha has historically assumed responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the doctrine as well as the translation and propagation of the teachings of the Buddha.

The key feature of Buddhist monasticism is the adherence to the vinaya which contains an elaborate set of &quot;227 main rules of conduct&quot; (known as &quot;Patimokkha&quot; in Pāli) including complete chastity, eating only before noon, and not indulging in malicious or salacious talk. Between midday and the next day, a strict life of scripture study, chanting, meditation, and occasional cleaning forms most of the duties for members of the &quot;sangha&quot;. Transgression of rules carries penalties ranging from confession to permanent expulsion from the &quot;sangha&quot;.

===Japanese monastic regulations===
Saichō, the founder of the Japanese school of Tendai, decided to reduce the number of rules down to about 60 based on the Bodhisattva Precepts. In the Kamakura, many Japanese schools that originated in or were influenced by the Tendai such as Zen, Pure Land Buddhism and Nichiren Buddhism abolished traditional ordination in favor of this new model of the monastic regulations.

===The Fourteen Precepts of the Order of Interbeing===
The Order of Interbeing, established in 1964 and associated with the Plum Village Tradition, has fourteen precepts observed by all monastics. They were written by Thích Nhất Hạnh.

===Possessions===
Monks and nuns generally own a minimum of possessions due to their &quot;samaya&quot; as renunciants, including three robes, an alms bowl, a cloth belt, a needle and thread, a razor for shaving the head, and a water filter. In practice, they often have a few additional personal possessions.

Traditionally, Buddhist monks, nuns, and novices eschew ordinary clothes and wear robes. Originally the robes were sewn together from rags and stained with earth or other available dyes. The color of modern robes varies from community to community: saffron is characteristic for Theravada groups; blue, grey or brown for Mahayana Sangha members in Vietnam, maroon in Tibetan Buddhism, grey in Korea, and black in Japan.

===Attitudes regarding food and work===

A Buddhist monk is a &quot;bhikkhu&quot; in Pali, Sanskrit &quot;bhikṣu&quot;, while a nun is a &quot;bhikkhuni&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;bhikṣuṇī&quot;. These words literally mean &quot;beggar&quot; or &quot;one who lives by alms&quot;, and it was traditional in early Buddhism for the Sangha to go on &quot;alms round&quot; for food, walking or standing quietly in populated areas with alms bowls ready to receive food offerings each day. Although in the &quot;vinaya&quot; laid down by the Gautama Buddha, the &quot;sangha&quot; was not allowed to engage directly in agriculture, this later changed in some Mahayana schools when Buddhism moved to East Asia, so that in the East Asian cultural sphere, the monastic community traditionally has engaged in agriculture. An emphasis on working for food is attributed to additional training guidelines laid down by a Chan Buddhist master, Baizhang Huaihai, notably the phrase, &quot;A day without work is a day without food&quot; ().

The idea that all Buddhists, especially &quot;sangha&quot; members, practice vegetarianism is a Western misperception. In the Pali Canon, the Buddha rejected a suggestion by Devadatta to impose vegetarianism on the &quot;sangha&quot;. According to the Pali Texts, the Buddha ate meat as long as the animal was not killed specifically for him. The Pāli Canon allowed Sangha members to eat whatever food is donated to them by laypeople, except that they may not eat meat if they know or suspect the animal was killed specifically for them. Consequently, the Theravada tradition does not practice strict vegetarianism, although an individual may do so as his or her personal choice.

Both Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions vary depending on their interpretation of their scriptures. In some Mahayana sutras, meat-eating is strongly discouraged and it is stated that the Buddha did not eat meat. In particular, East Asian &quot;sangha&quot; members take on the Bodhisattva Precepts originating in the &quot;Brahmajāla Sūtra&quot;, which has a vow of vegetarianism as part of the Triple Platform Ordination, where they receive the three sets of vows: śrāmaṇera/śrāmaṇerī (novitiate), monastic, and then the &quot;Brahmajāla Sūtra&quot; Bodhisattva Precepts, whereas the Tibetan lineages transmit a tradition of Bodhisattva Precepts from Asanga&#x27;s &quot;Yogācārabhūmi-Śāstra&quot;, which do not include a vow of vegetarianism.

According to Mahayana sutras, Shakyamuni Buddha always maintained that lay persons were capable of great wisdom and of reaching enlightenment. In some areas there has been a misconception that Theravada regards enlightenment to be an impossible goal for those outside the &quot;sangha&quot;, but in Theravada suttas it is clearly recorded that the Buddha&#x27;s uncle, a lay follower, reached enlightenment by hearing the Buddha&#x27;s discourse, and there are many other such instances described in the Pāli Canon. Accordingly, emphasis on lay persons, as well as Sangha members, practicing the Buddhist path of morality, meditation, and wisdom is present in all major Buddhist schools.

==The &quot;Sangha&quot; as any Buddhist community==

Some liberal scholars opine that &quot;sangha&quot; is frequently (and according to them, mistakenly) used in the West to refer to any sort of Buddhist community. 

* The terms &quot;Parisā&quot; and &quot;Gaṇa&quot; are suggested as being more appropriate references to a wider and generalized community of Buddhists. &quot;Pariṣā&quot; means &quot;following&quot; and it refers to the four groups of the Buddha&#x27;s followers: monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen. 
* The Sanskrit term &quot;gana&quot; has meanings of &quot;flock, troop, multitude, number, tribe, series, class&quot;, and is usable as well in more mundane senses.

==In Nichiren Buddhism==
Accordingly, the Nichiren Shōshū sect maintains the traditionalist definition of the &quot;sangha&quot; as the Head Temple Taisekiji priesthood collective as the sole custodians and arbiters of Buddhist doctrine.

The Soka Gakkai, a new religious movement which began as a lay organization previously associated with Nichiren Shōshū in Japan, disputes the traditional definition of sangha. The organization interprets the meaning of the Three Jewels of Buddhism, in particular the &quot;treasure of the Sangha&quot;, to include all people who practice Buddhism according to its own interpretation within their organization, whether lay or clerical. After its formal expulsion from its parent religion in December 1991 due to conflicts of religious doctrine, the organization re—published newer literature which revised the terms such as &quot;Treasure of the Priesthood&quot; to &quot;The Buddhist Order&quot;. 

Some modernist sects of Nichiren-shu holds a position that any Buddhist community is also called Sangha, along with both liberal and progressive Mahayana lay movements as well claiming this new definition.

<text>In kinematics, the speed (commonly referred to as v) of an object is the magnitude of the change of its position over time or the magnitude of the change of its position per unit of time; it is thus a non-negative scalar quantity. The average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval; the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero. Speed is the magnitude of &quot;velocity&quot; (a vector), which indicates additionally the direction of motion.

Speed has the dimensions of distance divided by time. The SI unit of speed is the metre per second (m/s), but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the kilometre per hour (km/h) or, in the US and the UK, miles per hour (mph). For air and marine travel, the knot is commonly used.

The fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel, according to special relativity, is the speed of light in vacuum &quot;c&quot; = metres per second (approximately or ). Matter cannot quite reach the speed of light, as this would require an infinite amount of energy. In relativity physics, the concept of rapidity replaces the classical idea of speed.

==Definition==
=== Historical definition ===
Italian physicist Galileo Galilei is usually credited with being the first to measure speed by considering the distance covered and the time it takes. Galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time. In equation form, that is
formula_1
where formula_2 is speed, formula_3 is distance, and formula_4 is time. A cyclist who covers 30 metres in a time of 2 seconds, for example, has a speed of 15 metres per second. Objects in motion often have variations in speed (a car might travel along a street at 50 km/h, slow to 0 km/h, and then reach 30 km/h).

===Instantaneous speed===
Speed at some instant, or assumed constant during a very short period of time, is called &quot;instantaneous speed&quot;. By looking at a speedometer, one can read the instantaneous speed of a car at any instant. A car travelling at 50 km/h generally goes for less than one hour at a constant speed, but if it did go at that speed for a full hour, it would travel 50 km. If the vehicle continued at that speed for half an hour, it would cover half that distance (25 km). If it continued for only one minute, it would cover about 833 m.

In mathematical terms, the instantaneous speed formula_2 is defined as the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity formula_6, that is, the derivative of the position formula_7 with respect to time:
formula_8

If formula_9 is the length of the path (also known as the distance) travelled until time formula_4, the speed equals the time derivative of formula_9:
formula_12

In the special case where the velocity is constant (that is, constant speed in a straight line), this can be simplified to formula_13. The average speed over a finite time interval is the total distance travelled divided by the time duration.

===Average speed===

Different from instantaneous speed, &quot;average speed&quot; is defined as the total distance covered divided by the time interval. For example, if a distance of 80 kilometres is driven in 1 hour, the average speed is 80 kilometres per hour. Likewise, if 320 kilometres are travelled in 4 hours, the average speed is also 80 kilometres per hour. When a distance in kilometres (km) is divided by a time in hours (h), the result is in kilometres per hour (km/h).

Average speed does not describe the speed variations that may have taken place during shorter time intervals (as it is the entire distance covered divided by the total time of travel), and so average speed is often quite different from a value of instantaneous speed. If the average speed and the time of travel are known, the distance travelled can be calculated by rearranging the definition to
formula_14

Using this equation for an average speed of 80 kilometres per hour on a 4-hour trip, the distance covered is found to be 320 kilometres.

Expressed in graphical language, the slope of a tangent line at any point of a distance-time graph is the instantaneous speed at this point, while the slope of a chord line of the same graph is the average speed during the time interval covered by the chord. Average speed of an object is
Vav = s÷t

===Difference between speed and velocity===
Speed denotes only how fast an object is moving, whereas velocity describes both how fast and in which direction the object is moving. If a car is said to travel at 60 km/h, its &quot;speed&quot; has been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60 km/h to the north, its &quot;velocity&quot; has now been specified.

The big difference can be discerned when considering movement around a circle. When something moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point, its average &quot;velocity&quot; is zero, but its average &quot;speed&quot; is found by dividing the circumference of the circle by the time taken to move around the circle. This is because the average &quot;velocity&quot; is calculated by considering only the displacement between the starting and end points, whereas the average &quot;speed&quot; considers only the total distance travelled.

===Tangential speed===
==Units==

Units of speed include:
*metres per second (symbol m s−1 or m/s), the SI derived unit;
*kilometres per hour (symbol km/h);
*miles per hour (symbol mi/h or mph);
*knots (nautical miles per hour, symbol kn or kt);
*feet per second (symbol fps or ft/s);
*Mach number (dimensionless), speed divided by the speed of sound;
*in natural units (dimensionless), speed divided by the speed of light in vacuum (symbol &quot;c&quot; = ).

==Examples of different speeds==


==Psychology==
According to Jean Piaget, the intuition for the notion of speed in humans precedes that of duration, and is based on the notion of outdistancing. Piaget studied this subject inspired by a question asked to him in 1928 by Albert Einstein: &quot;In what order do children acquire the concepts of time and speed?&quot; Children&#x27;s early concept of speed is based on &quot;overtaking&quot;, taking only temporal and spatial orders into consideration, specifically: &quot;A moving object is judged to be more rapid than another when at a given moment the first object is behind and a moment or so later ahead of the other object.&quot;

<doc id="28751" wikidata="Q7643754" url="?curid=28751" title="Superluminal communication">
<text>Superluminal communication is a hypothetical process in which information is conveyed at faster-than-light speeds. The current scientific consensus is that faster-than-light communication is not possible, and to date it has not been achieved in any experiment.

Superluminal communication other than possibly through wormholes is likely impossible because, in a Lorentz-invariant theory, it could be used to transmit information into the past. This would complicate causality, but no theoretical arguments conclusively preclude this possibility.

A number of theories and phenomena related to superluminal communication have been proposed or studied, including tachyons, neutrinos, quantum nonlocality, wormholes, and quantum tunneling.

==Proposed mechanisms==
===Tachyons===
Tachyonic particles are hypothetical particles that travel faster than light, which could conceivably allow for superluminal communication. Because such a particle would violate the known laws of physics, many scientists reject the idea that they exist. By contrast, tachyonic fieldsquantum fields with imaginary massdo exist and exhibit superluminal group velocity under some circumstances. However, such fields have luminal signal velocity and do not allow superluminal communication.

===Quantum nonlocality===
Quantum mechanics is non-local in the sense that distant systems can be entangled. Entangled states lead to correlations in the results of otherwise random measurements, even when the measurements are made nearly simultaneously and at far distant points. The impossibility of superluminal communication led Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen to propose that quantum mechanics must be incomplete (see EPR paradox).

However, it is now well understood that quantum entanglement does not allow any influence or information to propagate superluminally.

Practically, any attempt to force one member of an entangled pair of particles into a particular quantum state, breaks the entanglement between the two particles. That is to say, the other member of the entangled pair is completely unaffected by this &quot;forcing&quot; action, and its quantum state remains random; a preferred outcome cannot be encoded into a quantum measurement.

Technically, the microscopic causality postulate of axiomatic quantum field theory implies the impossibility of superluminal communication using any phenomena whose behavior can be described by orthodox quantum field theory. A special case of this is the no-communication theorem, which prevents communication using the quantum entanglement of a composite system shared between two spacelike-separated observers.

===Wormholes===
If wormholes are possible, then ordinary subluminal methods of communication could be sent through them to achieve effectively superluminal transmission speeds across non-local regions of spacetime. Considering the immense energy or exotic matter with negative mass/negative energy that current theories suggest would be required to open a wormhole large enough to pass spacecraft through, it may be that only atomic-scale wormholes would be practical to build, limiting their use solely to information transmission. Some hypotheses of wormhole formation would prevent them from ever becoming &quot;timeholes&quot;, allowing superluminal communication without the additional complication of allowing communication with the past.

==Fictional devices==
===Tachyon-like===
The &quot;Dirac communicator&quot; features in several of the works of James Blish, notably his 1954 short story &quot;Beep&quot; (later expanded into &quot;The Quincunx of Time&quot;). As alluded to in the title, any active device received the sum of all transmitted messages in universal space-time, in a single pulse, so that demultiplexing yielded information about the past, present, and future.

===Superluminal transmitters and ansibles===
The terms &quot;ultrawave&quot; and &quot;hyperwave&quot; have been used by several authors, often interchangeably, to denote faster-than-light communications. Examples include:
*E. E. Smith used the term &quot;ultrawave&quot; in his &quot;Lensman&quot; series, for waves which propagated through a sub-ether and could be used for weapons, communications, and other applications.
*In Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; series, &quot;ultrawave&quot; and &quot;hyperwave&quot; are used interchangeably to represent a superluminal communications medium. The &quot;hyperwave relay&quot; also features.
*In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, subspace carries faster-than-light communication (subspace radio) and travel (warp drive).
*The &quot;Cities in Flight&quot; series by James Blish featured ultrawave communications which used the known phenomenon of phase velocity to carry information, a property which in fact is impossible. The limitations of phase velocity beyond the speed of light later led him to develop his Dirac communicator.
*Larry Niven used &quot;hyperwave&quot; in his Known Space series as the term for a faster-than-light method of communication. Unlike the hyperdrive that moved ships at a finite superluminal speed, hyperwave was essentially instantaneous.
*In Richard K. Morgan&#x27;s Takeshi Kovacs novels human colonies on distant planets maintain contact with earth and each other via &quot;hyperspatial needlecast&quot;, a technology which moves information &quot;...so close to instantaneously that scientists are still arguing about the terminology&quot;.

A later device was the ansible coined by Ursula K. Le Guin and used extensively in her Hainish Cycle. Like Blish&#x27;s device it provided instantaneous communication, but without the inconvenient beep.

The ansible is also a major plot element, nearly a MacGuffin, in Elizabeth Moon&#x27;s Vatta&#x27;s War series. Much of the story line revolves around various parties attacking or repairing ansibles, and around the internal politics of ISC (InterStellar Communications), a corporation which holds a monopoly on the ansible technology.

The ansible is also used as the main form of communication in Orson Scott Card&#x27;s Ender&#x27;s Game series. It is inhabited by an energy based, non-artificial sentient creature called an Aiúa that was placed within the ansible network and goes by the name of Jane. It was made when the humans realized that the Buggers, an alien species that attacked Earth, could communicate instantaneously and so the humans tried to do the same.

===Quantum entanglement===
* In Ernest Cline&#x27;s novel &quot;Armada&quot;, alien invaders possess technology for instant &quot;quantum communication&quot; with unlimited range. Humans reverse engineer the device from captured alien technology.
* In the &quot;Mass Effect&quot; series of video games, instantaneous communication is possible using quantum-entanglement communicators placed in the communications rooms of starships.
* In the &quot;Avatar&quot; continuity, faster-than-light communication via a subtle control over the state of entangled particles is possible, but for practical purposes extremely slow and expensive: at a transmission rate of three bits of information per hour and a cost of $7,500 per bit, it is used for only the highest priority messages.
* Charles Stross&#x27;s books &quot;Singularity Sky&quot; and &quot;Iron Sunrise&quot; make use of &quot;causal channels&quot; which use entangled particles for instantaneous two-way communication. The technique has drawbacks in that the entangled particles are expendable and the use of faster-than-light travel destroys the entanglement, so that one end of the channel must be transported below light speed. This makes them expensive and limits their usefulness somewhat.
* In Liu Cixin&#x27;s novel &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;, the alien Trisolarans, while preparing to invade the Solar System, use a device with Ansible characteristics to communicate with their collaborators on Earth in real time. Additionally, they use spying/sabotaging devices called &#x27;Sophons&#x27; on Earth which by penetration can access any kind of electronically saved and visual information, interact with electronics, and communicate results back to Trisolaris in real-time via quantum entanglement. The technology used is &quot;single protons that have been unfolded from eleven space dimensions to two dimensions, programmed, and then refolded&quot; and thus Sophons remain undetectable for humans.

===Psychic links===
Psychic links, belonging to pseudoscience, have been described as explainable by physical principles or unexplained, but they are claimed to operate instantaneously over large distances.

In the &quot;Stargate&quot; television series, characters are able to communicate instantaneously over long distances by transferring their consciousness into another person or being anywhere in the universe using &quot;Ancient communication stones&quot;. It is not known how these stones operate, but the technology explained in the show usually revolves around wormholes for instant teleportation, faster-than-light, space-warping travel, and sometimes around quantum multiverses.

In Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Time for the Stars&quot;, twin telepathy was used to maintain communication with a distant spaceship.

Peter F. Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Void Trilogy&quot; features psychic links between the multiple bodies simultaneously occupied by some characters.

In Brandon Sanderson&#x27;s &quot;Skyward&quot; series, characters are able to use &quot;Cytonics&quot; to communicate instantaneously over any distance by sending messages via an inter-dimensional reality called &quot;nowhere&quot;.

===Other devices===
Similar devices are present in the works of numerous others, such as Frank Herbert and Philip Pullman, who called his a &quot;lodestone resonator&quot;.

Anne McCaffrey&#x27;s &quot;Crystal Singer&quot; series posited an instantaneous communication device powered by rare &quot;Black Crystal&quot; from the planet Ballybran. Black Crystals cut from the same mineral deposit could be &quot;tuned&quot; to sympathetically vibrate with each other instantly, even when separated by interstellar distances, allowing instantaneous telephone-like voice and data communication. Similarly, in Gregory Keyes&#x27; series &quot;The Age of Unreason&quot;, &quot;aetherschreibers&quot; use two-halves of a single &quot;chime&quot; to communicate, aided by scientific alchemy. While the speed of communication is important, so is the fact that the messages cannot be overheard except by listeners with a piece of the same original crystal.

Stephen R. Donaldson, in his Gap cycle, proposed a similar system, &quot;Symbiotic Crystalline Resonance Transmission&quot;, clearly ansible-type technology but very difficult to produce and limited to text messages.

In &quot;With Folded Hands&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Humanoids&quot; (1949), by Jack Williamson, instant communication and power transfer through interstellar space is possible with &quot;rhodomagnetic energy&quot;.

In Ivan Yefremov&#x27;s 1957 novel &quot;Andromeda Nebula&quot;, a device for instant transfer of information and matter is made real by using &quot;bipolar mathematics&quot; to explore use of anti-gravitational shadow vectors through a zero field and the antispace, which enables them to make contact with the planet of Epsilon Tucanae.

In Edmond Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;The Star Kings&quot; (1949), the discovery of an unknown form of electromagnetic radiation called sub-spectrum rays moves faster than light. The fastest of these are those of the Minus-42nd Octave, which allows for real time telestereo communication with anyone within the galaxy.

In Cordwainer Smith&#x27;s Instrumentality novels and stories, interplanetary and interstellar communication is normally relayed from planet to planet, presumably at superluminal speed for each stage (at least between solar systems) but with a cumulative delay. For urgent communication there is the &quot;instant message&quot;, which is effectively instantaneous but very expensive.

In Howard Taylor&#x27;s web comic series Schlock Mercenary, superluminal communication is performed via the hypernet, a galaxy-spanning analogue to the Internet. Through the hypernet, communications and data are routed through nanoscopic wormholes, using conventional electromagnetic signals.

<text>Mirza Shahab-ud-Din Muhammad Khurram (5 January 1592 – 22 January 1666), commonly called Shah Jahan I (; ), also called Shah Jahan the Magnificent, was Emperor of Hindustan from 1628 until his deposition in 1658. As the fifth Mughal emperor, his reign marked the zenith of Mughal architectural and cultural achievements.

The third son of Jahangir (), Shah Jahan participated in the military campaigns against the Sisodia Rajputs of Mewar and the rebel Lodi nobles of the Deccan. After Jahangir&#x27;s death in October 1627, Shah Jahan defeated his youngest brother Shahryar Mirza and crowned himself emperor in the Agra Fort. In addition to Shahryar, Shah Jahan executed most of his rival claimants to the throne. He commissioned many monuments, including the Red Fort, Shah Jahan Mosque and the Taj Mahal, where his favorite consort Mumtaz Mahal is entombed. In foreign affairs, Shah Jahan presided over the aggressive campaigns against the Deccan sultanates, the conflicts with the Portuguese, and the wars with the Safavids. He also suppressed several local rebellions and dealt with the devastating Deccan famine of 1630–32.

In September 1657, Shah Jahan was ailing and appointed his eldest son Dara Shikoh as his successor. This nomination led to a succession crisis among his three sons, among whom Shah Jahan&#x27;s third son Aurangzeb () emerged victorious and became the sixth emperor, executing all of his surviving brothers, including Crown Prince Dara Shikoh. After Shah Jahan recovered from his illness in July 1658, Aurangzeb imprisoned him in Agra Fort from July 1658 until his death in January 1666. He was laid to rest next to his wife in the Taj Mahal. His reign is known for doing away with the liberal policies initiated by his grandfather Akbar. During Shah Jahan&#x27;s time, Islamic revivalist movements like the Naqshbandi began to shape Mughal policies.

==Early life==

===Birth and background===

He was born on 5 January 1592 in Lahore, present-day Pakistan, as the ninth child and third son of Prince Salim (later known as &#x27;Jahangir&#x27; upon his accession) by his wife, Jagat Gosain, a Rathore Rajput Princess from Marwar. The name Khurram () was chosen for the young prince by his grandfather, Emperor Akbar, with whom the young prince shared a close relationship. Jahangir stated that Akbar was very fond of Khurram and had often told him, &quot;There is no comparison between him and your other sons. I consider him my true son.&quot;

When Khurram was born, Akbar, considering him to be auspicious, insisted the prince be raised in his household rather than Salim&#x27;s and was thus entrusted to the care of Ruqaiya Sultan Begum. Ruqaiya assumed the primary responsibility for raising Khurram and is noted to have raised Khurram affectionately. Jahangir noted in his memoirs that Ruqaiya had loved his son, Khurram, &quot;a thousand times more than if he had been her own [son].&quot;

However, after the death of his grandfather Akbar in 1605, he returned to the care of his mother, Jagat Gosain whom he cared for and loved immensely. Although separated from her at birth, he had become devoted to her and had her addressed as &quot;Hazrat&quot; in court chronicles. On the death of Jagat Gosain in Akbarabad on 8 April 1619, he is recorded to be inconsolable by Jahangir and mourned for 21 days. For these three weeks of the mourning period, he attended no public meetings and subsisted on simple vegetarian meals. His consort Mumtaz Mahal personally supervised the distribution of food to the poor during this period. She led the recitation of the Quran every morning, and gave her husband many lessons on the substance of life and death, and begged him not to grieve.

===Education===
As a child, Khurram received a broad education befitting his status as a Mughal prince, which included martial training and exposure to a wide variety of cultural arts, such as poetry and music, most of which were inculcated, according to court chroniclers, by Jahangir. According to his chronicler Qazvini, prince Khurram was only familiar with a few Turki words and showed little interest in the study of the language as a child. Khurram was attracted to Hindi literature since his childhood, and his Hindi letters were mentioned in his father&#x27;s biography, Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri. In 1605, as Akbar lay on his deathbed, Khurram, who at this point in time was 13, remained by his bedside and refused to move even after his mother tried to retrieve him. Given the politically uncertain times immediately preceding Akbar&#x27;s death, Khurram was in a fair amount of physical danger from political opponents of his father. He was at last ordered to return to his quarters by the senior women of his grandfather&#x27;s household, namely Salima Sultan Begum and his grandmother Mariam-uz-Zamani as Akbar&#x27;s health deteriorated.

===Khusrau rebellion===
In 1605, his father succeeded to the throne, after crushing a rebellion by Prince Khusrau – Khurram remained distant from court politics and intrigues in the immediate aftermath of that event. Khurram left Ruqaiya&#x27;s care and returned to his mother&#x27;s care. As the third son, Khurram did not challenge the two major power blocs of the time, his father&#x27;s and his half-brother&#x27;s; thus, he enjoyed the benefits of imperial protection and luxury while being allowed to continue with his education and training. This relatively quiet and stable period of his life allowed Khurram to build his own support base in the Mughal court, which would be useful later on in his life.

Jahangir assigned Khurram to guard the palace and treasury while he went to pursue Khusrau. He was later ordered to bring Mariam-uz-Zamani, his grandmother and Jahangir&#x27;s harem to him.

During Khusrau&#x27;s second rebellion, Khurram&#x27;s informants informed him that Fatehullah, Nuruddin and Muhammad Sharif gathered around 500 men at Khusrau&#x27;s instigation and lay await for the Emperor. Khurram relayed this information to Jahangir who praised him.

Jahangir had Khurram weighed against gold, silver and other wealth at his mansion at Orta.

===Nur Jahan===

Due to the long period of tensions between his father and his half-brother, Khusrau Mirza, Khurram began to drift closer to his father, and, over time, started to be considered the de facto heir-apparent by court chroniclers. This status was given official sanction when Jahangir granted the sarkar of Hissar-e-Feroza, which had traditionally been the fief of the heir-apparent, to Khurram in 1608. After her marriage to Jahangir in the year 1611, Nur Jahan gradually became an active participant in all decisions made by Jahangir and gained extreme powers in administration, so much so that it was obvious to everyone both inside and outside that most of his decisions were actually hers. Slowly, while Jahangir became more indulgent in wine and opium, she was considered to be the actual power behind the throne. Her near and dear relatives acquired important positions in the Mughal court, termed the Nur Jahan junta by historians. Khurram was in constant conflict with his stepmother, Nur Jahan who favoured her son-in-law Shahryar Mirza for the succession to the Mughal throne over him. In the last years of Jahangir&#x27;s life, Nur Jahan was in full power, and the emperor had left all the burden of governance on her. She tried to weaken Khurram&#x27;s position in the Mughal court by sending him on campaigns far in Deccan, while ensuring several favours were being bestowed on her son-in-law. Khurram, after sensing the danger posed to his status as heir-apparent, rebelled against his father in 1622 but did not succeed and eventually lost the favour of his father. Several years before Jahangir&#x27;s death in 1627, coins began to be struck containing Nur Jahan&#x27;s name along with Jahangir&#x27;s name; In fact, there were two prerogatives of sovereignty for the legitimacy of a Muslim monarchy (reading the Khutbah and the other being the right to mint coins). After the death of Jahangir in 1627, a struggle developed between Khurram and his half-brother, Shahryar Mirza for the succession to the Mughal throne. Khurram won the battle of succession and became the fifth Mughal Emperor. Nur Jahan was subsequently deprived of her imperial stature, authority, privileges, honors and economic grants and was put under house arrest on the orders of Khurram and led a quiet and comfortable life till her death.

== Ancestry ==
==Marriages==

In 1607, Khurram became engaged to Arjumand Banu Begum (1593–1631), who is also known as Mumtaz Mahal (Persian ). They were about 14 and 15 when they were engaged, and five years later, they married. The young girl belonged to an illustrious Persian noble family that included Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Asaf Khan, who had been serving Mughal emperors since the reign of Akbar. The family&#x27;s patriarch was Mirza Ghiyas Beg, who was also known by his title I&#x27;timād-ud-Daulah or &quot;Pillar of the State&quot;. He had been Jahangir&#x27;s finance minister, and his son, Asaf Khan – Arjumand Banu&#x27;s father – played an important role in the Mughal court, eventually serving as Chief Minister. Her aunt Mehr-un-Nissa later became the Empress Nur Jahan, chief consort of Emperor Jahangir.

The prince would have to wait five years before he was married in 1612 (1021 AH), on a date selected by the court astrologers as most conducive to ensuring a happy marriage. This was an unusually long engagement for the time. However, Shah Jahan first married a Persian Princess (name not known) entitled Kandahari Begum, the daughter of a great-grandson of the great Shah Ismail I of Persia, with whom he had a daughter, his first child.

In 1612, aged 20, Khurram married Mumtaz Mahal, on a date chosen by court astrologers. The marriage was a happy one, and Khurram remained devoted to her. They had fourteen children, out of whom seven survived into adulthood.

Though there was genuine love between the two, Arjumand Banu Begum was a politically astute woman and served as a crucial advisor and confidante to her husband. Later on, as empress, Mumtaz Mahal wielded immense power, such as being consulted by her husband in state matters, attending the council (&quot;shura&quot; or &quot;diwan&quot;), and being responsible for the imperial seal, which allowed her to review official documents in their final draft. Shah Jahan also gave her the right to issue her own orders (hukums) and make appointments to him. 

Mumtaz Mahal died at the young age of 38 (7 June 1631), upon giving birth to Princess Gauhar Ara Begum in the city of Burhanpur, Deccan, of a postpartum haemorrhage, which caused considerable blood-loss after painful labor of thirty hours. Contemporary historians note that Princess Jahanara, aged 17, was so distressed by her mother&#x27;s pain that she started distributing gems to the poor, hoping for divine intervention, and Shah Jahan was noted as being &quot;paralysed by grief&quot; and weeping fits. Her body was temporarily buried in a walled pleasure garden known as Zainabad, originally constructed by Shah Jahan&#x27;s uncle Prince Daniyal along the Tapti River. Her death had a profound impact on Shah Jahan&#x27;s personality and inspired the construction of the marvelous Taj Mahal, where she was later reburied.

Khurram had taken other wives, among whom were Kandahari Begum (m. 28 October 1610) and another Persian Princess Izz un-Nisa Begum (m. 2 September 1617), the daughters of Prince Muzaffar Husain Mirza Safawi and Shahnawaz Khan, son of Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana, respectively. But according to court chroniclers, these marriages were more out of political consideration, and they enjoyed only the status of being royal wives.

Khurram is also recorded to have married his maternal half-cousin, a Rathore Rajput Princess Kunwari Leelavati Deiji, daughter of Kunwar Sakat/Sagat or Shakti Singh, son of Mota Raja Udai Singh and half brother of Raja Sur Singh of Marwar. The marriage took place at Jodhpur when Khurram was in rebellion against his father, emperor Jahangir.

=== Relationship with Jahanara ===

After Shah Jahan fell ill in 1658, his daughter Jahanara Begum had a significant influence in the Mughal administration. As a result, several accusations of an incestual relationship between Shah Jahan and Jahanara were propagated. Such accusations have been dismissed by modern historians as gossip, as no witness of an incident has been mentioned.

Historian K. S. Lal also dismisses such claims as rumors propagated by courtiers and mullahs. He cites Aurangzeb&#x27;s confining of Jahanara in the Agra Fort with the Royal prisoner and the talk of the low people magnifying a rumor.

Several contemporary travelers have mentioned such accessions. Francois Bernier, a French physician, mentions rumors of an incestuous relationship being propagated in the Mughal Court. However, Bernier did not mention witnessing such a relationship. Niccolao Manucci, a Venetian traveler, dismisses such accusations by Bernier as gossip and &quot;&quot;The talk of the Low People&quot;.&quot;

==Early military campaigns==
Prince Khurram showed extraordinary military talent. The first occasion for Khurram to test his military prowess was during the Mughal campaign against the Rajput state of Mewar, which had been a hostile force to the Mughals since Akbar&#x27;s reign.

After a year of a harsh war of attrition, Rana Amar Singh I surrendered conditionally to the Mughal forces and became a vassal state of the Mughal Empire as a result of Mughal expedition of Mewar. In 1615, Khurram presented Kunwar Karan Singh, Amar Singh&#x27;s heir, to Jahangir. Khurram was sent to pay homage to his mother and stepmothers and was later awarded by Jahangir. The same year, his mansab was increased from 12000/6000 to 15000/7000, to equal that of his brother Parvez&#x27;s and was further increased to 20000/10000 in 1616.
In 1616, on Khurram&#x27;s departure to Deccan, Jahangir awarded him the title Shah Sultan Khurram.

In 1617, Khurram was directed to deal with the Lodis in the Deccan to secure the Empire&#x27;s southern borders and to restore imperial control over the region. On his return in 1617, after successes in these campaigns, Khurram performed koronush before Jahangir, who called him to jharoka and rose from his seat to embrace him. Jahangir also granted him the title of Shah Jahan (Persian: &quot;King of the World&quot;), and raised his military rank to 30000/20000 and allowed him a special throne in his Durbar, an unprecedented honor for a prince. Edward S. Holden writes, &quot;He was flattered by some, envied by others, loved by none.&quot;

In 1618, Shah Jahan was given the first copy of Tuzk-e-Jahangiri by his father, who considered him &quot;the first of all my sons in everything.&quot;
==Rebel prince==
Inheritance in the Mughal Empire was not determined through primogeniture, but by princely sons competing to achieve military successes and consolidating their power at court. This often led to rebellions and wars of succession. As a result, a complex political climate surrounded the Mughal court in Shah Jahan&#x27;s formative years. In 1611 his father married Nur Jahan, the widowed daughter of a Persian noble. She rapidly became an important member of Jahangir&#x27;s court and, together with her brother Asaf Khan, wielded considerable influence. Arjumand was Asaf Khan&#x27;s daughter, and her marriage to Khurram consolidated Nur Jahan and Asaf Khan&#x27;s positions in court.

Court intrigues, however, including Nur Jahan&#x27;s decision to have her daughter from her first marriage wed Prince Khurram&#x27;s youngest brother Shahzada Shahryar, and her support for his claim to the throne led to much internal division. Prince Khurram resented the influence Nur Jahan held over his father and was angered at having to play second fiddle to her favourite Shahryar, his half-brother and her son-in-law. When the Persians besieged Kandahar, Nur Jahan was at the helm of the affairs. She ordered Prince Khurram to march to Kandahar, but he refused. As a result of Prince Khurram&#x27;s refusal to obey Nur Jahan&#x27;s orders, Kandahar was lost to the Persians after a forty-five-day siege. Prince Khurram feared that in his absence, Nur Jahan would attempt to poison his father against him and convince Jahangir to name Shahryar the heir in his place. This fear brought Prince Khurram to rebel against his father rather than fight against the Persians.

In 1622, Prince Khurram raised an army and marched against his father and Nur Jahan. He was defeated at Bilochpur in March 1623. Later he took refuge in Udaipur Mewar with Maharana Karan Singh II. He was first lodged in Delwada Ki Haveli and subsequently shifted to Jagmandir Palace on his request. Prince Khurram exchanged his turban with the Maharana and that turban is still preserved in Pratap Museum, Udaipur (R V Somani 1976). It is believed that the mosaic work of Jagmandir inspired him to use mosaic work in the Taj Mahal of Agra. In November 1623, he found safe asylum in Bengal Subah after he was driven from Agra and the Deccan. He advanced through Midnapur and Burdwan. At Akbarnagar, he defeated and killed the then Subahdar of Bengal, Ibrahim Khan Fath-i-Jang, on 20 April 1624. He entered Dhaka and &quot;all the elephants, horses, and 4,000,000 rupees in specie belonging to the Government were delivered to him&quot;. After a short stay he then moved to Patna. His rebellion did not succeed in the end, and he was forced to submit unconditionally after he was defeated near Allahabad. Although the prince was forgiven for his errors in 1626, tensions between Nur Jahan and her stepson continued to grow beneath the surface.

Upon the death of Jahangir in 1627, the wazir Asaf Khan, who had long been a quiet partisan of Prince Khurram, acted with unexpected forcefulness and determination to forestall his sister&#x27;s plans to place Prince Shahryar on the throne. He put Nur Jahan in close confinement. He obtained control of Prince Khurram&#x27;s three sons, who were under her charge. Asaf Khan also managed palace intrigues to ensure Prince Khurram&#x27;s succession to the throne. Prince Khurram succeeded to the Mughal throne as Abu ud-Muzaffar Shihab ud-Din Mohammad Sahib ud-Quiran ud-Thani Shah Jahan Padshah Ghazi (Urdu: شهاب الدین محمد خرم), or Shah Jahan.

His regnal name is divided into various parts. &quot;Shihab ud-Din&quot;, meaning &quot;Star of the Faith&quot;, &quot;Sahib al-Quiran ud-Thani&quot;, meaning &quot;Second Lord of the Happy Conjunction of Jupiter and Venus&quot;. &quot;Shah Jahan&quot;, meaning &quot;King of the World&quot;, alluding to his pride in his Timurid roots and his ambitions. More epithets showed his secular and religious duties. He was also titled &quot;Hazrat Shahenshah&quot; (&quot;His Imperial Majesty&quot;), &quot;Hazrat-i-Khilafat-Panahi&quot; (&quot;His Majesty the Refuge of the Caliphate&quot;), &quot;Hazrat Zill-i-Ilahi&quot; (&quot;His Majesty the Shadow of God&quot;).

His first act as ruler was to execute his chief rivals and imprison his stepmother, Nur Jahan. Upon Shah Jahan&#x27;s orders, several executions took place on 23 January 1628. Those put to death included his brother Shahryar; his nephews Dawar and Garshasp, sons of Shah Jahan&#x27;s previously executed brother Prince Khusrau; and his cousins Tahmuras and Hoshang, sons of the late Prince Daniyal Mirza.
This allowed Shah Jahan to rule his empire without contention.

==Reign==

Evidence from the reign of Shah Jahan states that in 1648 the army consisted of 911,400 infantry, musketeers, and artillery men, and 185,000 Sowars commanded by princes and nobles.

His cultural and political initial steps have been described as a type of the Timurid Renaissance, in which he built historical and political bonds with his Timurid heritage, mainly via his numerous unsuccessful military campaigns on his ancestral region of Balkh. In various forms, Shah Jahan appropriated his Timurid background and grafted it onto his imperial legacy.

During his reign, the Marwari horse was introduced, becoming Shah Jahan&#x27;s favorite, and various Mughal cannons were mass-produced in the Jaigarh Fort. Under his rule, the empire became a huge military machine, and the nobles and their contingents multiplied almost fourfold, as did the demands for more revenue from their citizens. But due to his measures in the financial and commercial fields, it was a period of general stabilitythe administration was centralized and court affairs systematized.

The Mughal Empire continued to expand moderately during his reign, as his sons commanded large armies on different fronts. India at the time was a rich center of the arts, crafts and architecture, and some of the best of the architects, artisans, craftsmen, painters and writers of the world resided in Shah Jahan&#x27;s empire. According to economist Angus Maddison, Mughal-era India&#x27;s share of global gross domestic product (GDP) grew from 22.7% in 1600 to 24.4% in 1700, surpassing China to become the world&#x27;s largest. E. Dewick and Murray Titus, quoting &quot;Badshahnama&quot;, write that 76 temples in Benares were demolished on Shah Jahan&#x27;s orders.

===Famine of 1630===

A famine broke out in 1630–32 in Deccan, Gujarat and Khandesh as a result of three main crop failures. Two million people died of starvation; grocers sold dogs&#x27; flesh and mixed powdered bones with flour. It is reported that parents ate their own children. Some villages were completely destroyed, their streets filled with human corpses. In response to the devastation, Shah Jahan set up &quot;langar&quot; (free kitchens) for the victims of the famine.

===Successful military campaigns against Deccan sultanates===

In 1632, Shah Jahan captured the fortress at Daulatabad, Maharashtra and imprisoned Husein Shah of the Nizam Shahi Kingdom of Ahmednagar. Golconda submitted in 1635 and then Bijapur in 1636. Shah Jahan appointed Aurangzeb as Viceroy of the Deccan, consisting of Khandesh, Berar, Telangana, and Daulatabad. During his viceroyalty, Aurangzeb conquered Baglana where he defeated Baharji, the Raja. The small Maratha kingdom of Baglana straddled the main route from Surat and the western ports to Burhanpur in the Deccan, and had been subservient to one Muslim ruler or another for centuries. In 1637, however, Shah Jahan decided on complete annexation. Baharji, who had commanded the Baglana forces, died soon after the conquest. His son converted to Islam and received the title of Daulatmand Khan.

Aurangzeb then defeated Golconda in 1656, and then Bijapur in 1657.

===Sikh rebellion led by Guru Hargobind===
A rebellion of the Sikhs led by Guru Hargobind took place, and, in response, Shah Jahan ordered their destruction. Guru Hargobind defeated the Mughal&#x27;s army in the Battle of Amritsar, Battle of Kartarpur, Battle of Rohilla, and the Battle of Lahira.

===Relations with the Safavid dynasty===
Shah Jahan and his sons captured the city of Kandahar in 1638 from the Safavids, prompting the retaliation of the Persians led by their ruler Abbas II of Persia, who recaptured it in 1649. The Mughal armies were unable to recapture it despite repeated sieges during the Mughal–Safavid War. Shah Jahan also expanded the Mughal Empire to the west beyond the Khyber Pass to Ghazna and Kandahar.

===Military campaign in Central Asia===
Shah Jahan launched an invasion of Central Asia from 1646 to 1647 against the Khanate of Bukhara. With a total army of 75,000, Shah Jahan and his sons Aurangzeb and Murad Bakhsh temporarily occupied the territories of Balkh and Badakhshan. However, they retreated from the fruitless lands, and Balkh and Badakhshan returned to Bukharan control.

===Relations with the Ottoman Empire===
Shah Jahan sent an embassy to the Ottoman court in 1637. Led by Mir Zarif, it reached Sultan Murad IV the following year, while he was encamped in Baghdad. Zarif presented him with fine gifts and a letter that encouraged an alliance against Safavid Persia. The Sultan sent a return embassy led by Arsalan Agha. Shah Jahan received the ambassador in June 1640.

While he was encamped in Baghdad, Murad IV is known to have met ambassadors of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, Mir Zarif and Mir Baraka, who presented 1000 pieces of finely embroidered cloth and even armor. Murad IV gave them the finest weapons, saddles and Kaftans and ordered his forces to accompany the Mughals to the port of Basra, where they set sail to Thatta and finally Surat. They exchanged lavish presents, but Shah Jahan was displeased with Sultan Murad&#x27;s return letter, the tone of which he found discourteous. Sultan Murad&#x27;s successor, Sultan Ibrahim, sent Shah Jahan another letter encouraging him to wage war against the Persians, but there is no record of a reply.

===War with Portuguese===
Shah Jahan gave orders in 1631 to Qasim Khan, the Mughal viceroy of Bengal, to drive out the Portuguese from their trading post at Port Hoogly. The post was heavily armed with cannons, battleships, fortified walls, and other instruments of war. The Portuguese were accused of trafficking by high Mughal officials, and due to commercial competition, the Mughal-controlled port of Saptagram began to slump. Shah Jahan was particularly outraged by the activities of Jesuits in that region, notably when they were accused of abducting peasants. On 25 September 1632, the Mughal Army raised imperial banners and gained control over the Bandel region, and the garrison was punished. On 23 December 1635, Shah Jahan issued a farman ordering the Agra Church to be demolished. The Church was occupied by the Portuguese Jesuits. However, the Emperor allowed the Jesuits to conduct their religious ceremonies in privacy. He also banned the Jesuits from preaching their religion and making converts from both Hindus and Muslims. Though in the decree, he also granted 777 bighas of rent-free land to the Augustinian Fathers and the Christian community in Bandel, currently in West Bengal, shaping its Portuguese heritage for times to come.

== Revolts against Shah Jahan ==
The Kolis of Gujarat rebelled against the rule of Shah Jahan. In 1622, Shah Jahan sent Raja Vikramjit, the Governor of Gujarat, to subdue the Kolis of Ahmedabad. Between 1632 and 1635, four viceroys were appointed in an effort to manage the Koli&#x27;s activities. The Kolis of Kankrej in North Gujarat committed excesses, and the Jam of Nawanagar refused to pay tribute to Shah Jahan. Soon, Ázam Khán was appointed in an effort to subdue the Kolis and bring order to the province. Ázam Khán marched against Koli rebels. When Ázam Khán reached Sidhpur, the local merchants complained bitterly of the outrages of one Kánji, a Chunvalia Koli, who had been especially daring in plundering merchandise and committing highway robberies. Ázam Khán, anxious to start with a show of vigour before proceeding to Áhmedábád, marched against Kánji, who fled to the village of Bhádar near Kheralu, sixty miles north-east of Áhmedábád. Ázam Khán pursued him so hotly that Kánji surrendered, handed over his plunder, and guaranteed that he would not only cease to commit robberies but also pay an annual tribute of Rupees 10,000. Ázam Khán then built two fortified posts in the Koli&#x27;s territory, naming one Ázamábád after himself, and the other Khalílábád after his son. Additionally, he forced the surrender of the Jam of Nawanagar. The next viceroy, Ísa Tarkhán, carried out financial reforms. In 1644, the Mughal prince Aurangzeb was appointed as the viceroy, who then proceeded to become engaged in religious disputes, such as the destruction of a Jain temple in Ahmedabad. Due to these disputes, he was replaced by Shaista Khan who failed to subdue Kolis. Subsequently, prince Murad Bakhsh was appointed as the viceroy in 1654. He restored order and defeated the Koli rebels.

==Illness and death==
When Shah Jahan became ill in 1658, Dara Shikoh (Mumtaz Mahal&#x27;s eldest son) assumed the role of regent in his father&#x27;s stead, which swiftly incurred the animosity of his brothers. Upon learning of his assumption of the regency, his younger brothers, Shuja, Viceroy of Bengal, and Murad Baksh, Viceroy of Gujarat, declared their independence and marched upon Agra in order to claim their riches. Aurangzeb, the third son, gathered a well-trained army and became its chief commander. He faced Dara&#x27;s army near Agra and defeated him during the Battle of Samugarh. Although Shah Jahan fully recovered from his illness, Aurangzeb declared him incompetent to rule and put him under house arrest in Agra Fort.

Jahanara Begum Sahib, Mumtaz Mahal&#x27;s eldest surviving daughter, voluntarily shared his 8-year confinement and nursed him in his dotage. In January 1666, Shah Jahan fell ill. Confined to bed, he became progressively weaker until, on 22 January, he commended the ladies of the imperial court, particularly his consort of later years Akbarabadi Mahal, to the care of Jahanara. After reciting the &quot;Kal&#x27;ma&quot; (&quot;Laa ilaaha ill allah&quot;) and verses from the Quran, Shah Jahan died, aged 74.
Shah Jahan&#x27;s chaplain Sayyid Muhammad Qanauji and Kazi Qurban of Agra came to the fort, moved his body to a nearby hall, washed it, enshrouded it, and put it in a coffin of sandalwood.

Princess Jahanara had planned a state funeral, which was to include a procession with Shah Jahan&#x27;s body carried by eminent nobles followed by the notable citizens of Agra and officials scattering coins for the poor and needy. Aurangzeb refused to accommodate such ostentation. The body was taken to the Taj Mahal and was interred there next to the body of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
==Contributions to architecture==

Shah Jahan left behind a grand legacy of structures constructed during his reign. He was one of the greatest patrons of Mughal architecture. His reign ushered in the golden age of Mughal architecture. His most famous building was the Taj Mahal, which he built out of love for his wife, the empress Mumtaz Mahal. His relationship with Mumtaz Mahal has been heavily adapted into Indian art, literature and cinema. Shah Jahan personally owned the royal treasury, and several precious stones, such as the Kohinoor.

Its structure was drawn with great care, and architects from all over the world were called for this purpose. The building took twenty years to complete and was constructed from white marble underlaid with brick. Upon his death, his son Aurangzeb had him interred in it next to Mumtaz Mahal. Among his other constructions are the Red Fort, also called the &quot;Delhi Fort&quot; or &quot;Lal Qila&quot; in Urdu, large sections of Agra Fort, the Jama Masjid, the Wazir Khan Mosque, the Moti Masjid, the Shalimar Gardens, sections of the Lahore Fort, the Mahabat Khan Mosque in Peshawar, the Mini Qutub Minar in Hastsal, the Jahangir mausoleumhis father&#x27;s tomb, the construction of which was overseen by his stepmother Nur Jahan and the Shahjahan Mosque. He also had the Peacock Throne, Takht e Taus, made to celebrate his rule. Shah Jahan also placed profound verses of the Quran on his masterpieces of architecture.

The Shah Jahan Mosque in Thatta, Sindh province of Pakistan (100 km / 60 miles from Karachi) was built during the reign of Shah Jahan in 1647. The mosque is built with red bricks with blue coloured glaze tiles, probably imported from another Sindh&#x27;s town of Hala. The mosque has overall 93 domes, and it is the world&#x27;s largest mosque having such a number of domes. It has been built keeping acoustics in mind. A person speaking inside one end of the dome can be heard at the other end when the speech exceeds 100 decibels. It has been on the tentative UNESCO World Heritage List since 1993.

==Coins==
Shah Jahan continued striking coins in three metals: gold (mohur), silver (rupee) and copper (dam). His pre-accession coins bear the name Khurram.


==Issue==

==Inscriptions==

The inscription from Makrana, Nagaur District, dating back to 1651 AD, mentions Mirza Ali Baig, who was likely a local governor under Shah Jahan&#x27;s rule. It describes a notice he posted on a step-well, prohibiting low-caste individuals from using the well alongside higher-caste people.

<doc id="28754" wikidata="Q83059" url="?curid=28754" title="Saul Bellow">
<text>Saul Bellow (born Solomon Bellows; June 10, 1915April 5, 2005) was a Canadian American writer. For his literary work, Bellow was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, the 1976 Nobel Prize in Literature, and the National Medal of Arts. He is the only writer to win the National Book Award for Fiction three times, and he received the National Book Foundation&#x27;s lifetime Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 1990.

In the words of the Swedish Nobel Committee, his writing exhibited &quot;the mixture of rich picaresque novel and subtle analysis of our culture, of entertaining adventure, drastic and tragic episodes in quick succession interspersed with philosophic conversation, all developed by a commentator with a witty tongue and penetrating insight into the outer and inner complications that drive us to act, or prevent us from acting, and that can be called the dilemma of our age.&quot; His best-known works include &quot;The Adventures of Augie March,&quot; &quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot;, &quot;Herzog&quot;, &quot;Mr. Sammler&#x27;s Planet&quot;, &quot;Seize the Day&quot;, &quot;Humboldt&#x27;s Gift&quot;, and &quot;Ravelstein&quot;.

Bellow said that of all his characters, Eugene Henderson, of &quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot;, was the one most like himself. Bellow grew up as an immigrant from Quebec. As Christopher Hitchens describes it, Bellow&#x27;s fiction and principal characters reflect his own yearning for transcendence, a battle &quot;to overcome not just ghetto conditions but also ghetto psychoses.&quot; Bellow&#x27;s protagonists wrestle with what Albert Corde, the dean in &quot;The Dean&#x27;s December&quot;, called &quot;the big-scale insanities of the 20th century.&quot; This transcendence of the &quot;unutterably dismal&quot; (a phrase from &quot;Dangling Man&quot;) is achieved, if it can be achieved at all, through a &quot;ferocious assimilation of learning&quot; (Hitchens) and an emphasis on nobility.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Saul Bellow was born Solomon Bellows in Lachine, Quebec, two years after his parents, Lescha (née Gordin) and Abraham Bellows, emigrated from Saint Petersburg, Russia. He had three elder siblings - sister Zelda (later Jane, born in 1907), brothers Moishe (later Maurice, born in 1908) and Schmuel (later Samuel, born in 1911). Bellow&#x27;s family was Lithuanian-Jewish; his father was born in Vilnius. Bellow celebrated his birthday on June 10, although he appears to have been born on July 10, according to records from the Jewish Genealogical Society-Montreal. (In the Jewish community, it was customary to record the Hebrew date of birth, which does not always coincide with the Gregorian calendar.) Of his family&#x27;s emigration, Bellow wrote: 

A period of illness from a respiratory infection at age eight both taught him self-reliance (he was a very fit man despite his sedentary occupation) and provided an opportunity to satisfy his hunger for reading: reportedly, he decided to be a writer when he first read Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin.&quot;

When Bellow was nine, his family moved to the Humboldt Park neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago, the city that formed the backdrop of many of his novels. Bellow&#x27;s father, Abraham, had become an onion importer. He also worked in a bakery, as a coal delivery man, and as a bootlegger. Bellow&#x27;s mother, Liza, died when he was 17. She had been deeply religious and wanted her youngest son, Saul, to become a rabbi or a concert violinist. But he rebelled against what he later called the &quot;suffocating orthodoxy&quot; of his religious upbringing, and he began writing at a young age. Bellow&#x27;s lifelong love for the Torah began at four when he learned Hebrew. Bellow also grew up reading Shakespeare and the great Russian novelists of the 19th century.

In Chicago, he took part in anthroposophical studies at the Anthroposophical Society of Chicago. Bellow attended Tuley High School on Chicago&#x27;s west side where he befriended Yetta Barsh and Isaac Rosenfeld. In his 1959 novel &quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot;, Bellow modeled the character King Dahfu on Rosenfeld.

===Education and early career===
Bellow attended the University of Chicago but later transferred to Northwestern University. He originally wanted to study literature, but he felt the English department was anti-Jewish. Instead, he graduated with honors in anthropology and sociology. It has been suggested Bellow&#x27;s study of anthropology had an influence on his literary style, and anthropological references pepper his works. He later did graduate work at the University of Wisconsin.

Paraphrasing Bellow&#x27;s description of his close friend Allan Bloom (see &quot;Ravelstein&quot;), John Podhoretz has said that both Bellow and Bloom &quot;inhaled books and ideas the way the rest of us breathe air.&quot;

In the 1930s, Bellow was part of the Chicago branch of the Federal Writer&#x27;s Project, which included such future Chicago literary luminaries as Richard Wright and Nelson Algren. Many of the writers were radical: if they were not members of the Communist Party USA, they were sympathetic to the cause. Bellow was a Trotskyist, but because of the greater numbers of Stalinist-leaning writers, he had to suffer their taunts.

In 1941, Bellow became a naturalized United States citizen, after discovering, on attempting to enlist in the armed forces, that he had immigrated to the United States illegally as a child.
In 1943, Maxim Lieber was his literary agent.

During World War II, Bellow joined the merchant marine and during his service he completed his first novel, &quot;Dangling Man&quot; (1944) about a young Chicago man waiting to be drafted for the war.

From 1946 through 1948 Bellow taught at the University of Minnesota. In the fall of 1947, following a tour to promote his novel &quot;The Victim&quot;, he moved into a large old house at 58 Orlin Avenue SE in the Prospect Park neighborhood of Minneapolis.

In 1948, Bellow was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship that allowed him to move to Paris, where he began writing &quot;The Adventures of Augie March&quot; (1953). Critics have remarked on the resemblance between Bellow&#x27;s picaresque novel and the great 17th-century Spanish classic &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. The book starts with one of American literature&#x27;s most famous opening paragraphs, and it follows its titular character through a series of careers and encounters, as he lives by his wits and his resolve. Written in a colloquial yet philosophical style, &quot;The Adventures of Augie March&quot; established Bellow&#x27;s reputation as a major author.

In 1953, Bellow translated Gimpel the Fool by Isaac Bashevis Singer from Yiddish into English.

In 1958, Bellow once again taught at the University of Minnesota. During this time, he and his wife Sasha received psychoanalysis from University of Minnesota Psychology Professor Paul Meehl.

In the spring term of 1961 he taught creative writing at the University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras.
One of his students was William Kennedy, who was encouraged by Bellow to write fiction.

===Return to Chicago and mid-career===
Bellow lived in New York City for years, but returned to Chicago in 1962 as a professor at the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. The committee&#x27;s goal was to have professors work closely with talented graduate students on a multi-disciplinary approach to learning. His students included the poet, Tom Mandel. Bellow taught on the committee for more than 30 years, alongside his close friend, the philosopher Allan Bloom.

There were also other reasons for Bellow&#x27;s return to Chicago, where he moved into the Hyde Park neighborhood with his third wife, Susan Glassman. Bellow found Chicago vulgar but vital, and more representative of America than New York. He was able to stay in contact with old high school friends and a broad cross-section of society. In a 1982 profile, Bellow&#x27;s neighborhood was described as a high-crime area in the city&#x27;s center, and Bellow maintained he had to live in such a place as a writer and &quot;stick to his guns.&quot;

Bellow hit the bestseller list in 1964 with his novel &quot;Herzog&quot;. Bellow was surprised at the commercial success of this cerebral novel about a middle-aged and troubled college professor who writes letters to friends, scholars and the dead, but never sends them. Bellow returned to his exploration of mental instability, and its relationship to genius, in his 1975 novel &quot;Humboldt&#x27;s Gift&quot;. Bellow used his late friend and rival, the brilliant but self-destructive poet Delmore Schwartz, as his model for the novel&#x27;s title character, Von Humboldt Fleisher. Bellow also used Rudolf Steiner&#x27;s spiritual science, anthroposophy, as a theme in the book, having attended a study group in Chicago. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1969.

===Nobel Prize and later career===
Propelled by the success of &quot;Humboldt&#x27;s Gift&quot;, Bellow won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1976. In the 70-minute address he gave to an audience in Stockholm, Sweden, Bellow called on writers to be beacons for civilization and awaken it from intellectual torpor.

The following year, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Bellow for the Jefferson Lecture, the US federal government&#x27;s highest honor for achievement in the humanities. Bellow&#x27;s lecture was entitled &quot;The Writer and His Country Look Each Other Over.&quot;

From December 1981 to March 1982, Bellow was the Visiting Lansdowne Scholar at the University of Victoria (BC), and also held the title Writer-in-Residence. In 1998, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

Bellow traveled widely throughout his life, mainly to Europe, which he sometimes visited twice a year. As a young man, Bellow went to Mexico City to meet Leon Trotsky, but the expatriate Russian revolutionary was assassinated the day before they were to meet. Bellow&#x27;s social contacts were wide and varied. He tagged along with Robert F. Kennedy for a magazine profile he never wrote, and was close friends with the author Ralph Ellison. His many friends included the journalist Sydney J. Harris and the poet John Berryman.

While sales of Bellow&#x27;s first few novels were modest, that turned around with &quot;Herzog&quot;. Bellow continued teaching well into his old age, enjoying its human interaction and exchange of ideas. He taught at Yale University, University of Minnesota, New York University, Princeton University, University of Puerto Rico, University of Chicago, Bard College and Boston University, where he co-taught a class with James Wood (&#x27;modestly absenting himself&#x27; when it was time to discuss &quot;Seize the Day&quot;). In order to take up his appointment at Boston, Bellow moved from Chicago to Brookline, Massachusetts, in 1993; he died there on April 5, 2005, at age 89. He is buried at the Jewish cemetery Shir HeHarim of Brattleboro, Vermont.

While he read voluminously, Bellow also played the violin and followed sports. Work was a constant for him, but he at times toiled at a plodding pace on his novels, frustrating the publishing company.

His early works earned him the reputation as a major novelist of the 20th century, and by his death he was widely regarded as one of the greatest living novelists. He was the first writer to win three National Book Awards in all award categories. His friend and protege Philip Roth has said of him, &quot;The backbone of 20th-century American literature has been provided by two novelists—William Faulkner and Saul Bellow. Together they are the Melville, Hawthorne, and Twain of the 20th century.&quot; James Wood, in a eulogy of Bellow in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, wrote:

==Personal life ==
Bellow was married five times, with all but his last marriage ending in divorce. Bellow&#x27;s wives were Anita Goshkin, Alexandra (Sondra) Tschacbasov (daughter of painter Nahum Tschacbasov), Susan Glassman, Alexandra Ionescu Tulcea, and Janis Freedman.

His son Greg by his first marriage became a psychotherapist; he published &quot;Saul Bellow&#x27;s Heart: A Son&#x27;s Memoir&quot; in 2013, nearly a decade after his father&#x27;s death. Bellow&#x27;s son by his second marriage, Adam, published a nonfiction book &quot;In Praise of Nepotism&quot; in 2003. Bellow&#x27;s son by his third marriage, Daniel, is a potter, a writer and a former journalist. In 1999, when he was 84, Bellow had his fourth child and first daughter, with Freedman.

==Themes and style==

Bellow&#x27;s themes include the disorientation of contemporary society, and the ability of people to overcome their frailty and achieve greatness or awareness. Bellow saw many flaws in modern civilization, and its ability to foster madness, materialism and misleading knowledge. Principal characters in Bellow&#x27;s fiction have heroic potential, and many times they stand in contrast to the negative forces of society. Often these characters are Jewish and have a sense of alienation or otherness.

Jewish life and identity is a major theme in Bellow&#x27;s work, although he bristled at being called a &quot;Jewish writer&quot;. Bellow&#x27;s work also shows a great appreciation of America, and a fascination with the uniqueness and vibrancy of the American experience.

Bellow&#x27;s work abounds in references and quotes from Marcel Proust and Henry James, among others, but he offsets these high-culture references with jokes. Bellow interspersed autobiographical elements into his fiction, and many of his principal characters were said to bear a resemblance to him.

==Assessment==

Martin Amis described Bellow as &quot;The greatest American author ever, in my view&quot;.
For Linda Grant, &quot;What Bellow had to tell us in his fiction was that it was worth it, being alive.&quot;
On the other hand, Bellow&#x27;s detractors considered his work conventional and old-fashioned, as if the author were trying to revive the 19th-century European novel. In a private letter, Vladimir Nabokov described Bellow as a &quot;miserable mediocrity&quot;. Journalist and author Ron Rosenbaum described Bellow&#x27;s &quot;Ravelstein&quot; (2000) as the only book that rose above Bellow&#x27;s failings as an author. Rosenbaum wrote,

Kingsley Amis, father of Martin Amis, was less impressed by Bellow. In 1971, Kingsley suggested that crime writer John D. MacDonald &quot;is by any standards a better writer than Saul Bellow&quot;.

Sam Tanenhaus wrote in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; in 2007:

But Tanenhaus went on to answer his question:
V. S. Pritchett praised Bellow, finding his shorter works to be his best. Pritchett called Bellow&#x27;s novella &quot;Seize the Day&quot; a &quot;small gray masterpiece.&quot;

==Political views==

As he grew older, Bellow moved decidedly away from leftist politics and became identified with cultural conservatism. His opponents included feminism, campus activism and postmodernism. Bellow also thrust himself into the often contentious realm of Jewish and African-American relations. Bellow was critical of multiculturalism and according to Alfred Kazin once said: &quot;Who is the Tolstoy of the Zulus? The Proust of the Papuans? I&#x27;d be glad to read him.&quot; Bellow distanced himself somewhat from these remarks, which he characterized as &quot;off the cuff obviously and pedantic certainly.&quot; He, however, stood by his criticism of multiculturalism, writing:
Despite his identification with Chicago, he kept aloof from some of that city&#x27;s more conventional writers. In a 2006 interview with &quot;Stop Smiling&quot; magazine, Studs Terkel said of Bellow: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know him too well. We disagreed on a number of things politically. In the protests in the beginning of Norman Mailer&#x27;s &quot;Armies of the Night&quot;, when Mailer, Robert Lowell and Paul Goodman were marching to protest the Vietnam War, Bellow was invited to a sort of counter-gathering. He said, &#x27;Of course I&#x27;ll attend&#x27;. But he made a big thing of it. Instead of just saying OK, he was proud of it. So I wrote him a letter and he didn&#x27;t like it. He wrote me a letter back. He called me a Stalinist. But otherwise, we were friendly. He was a brilliant writer, of course. I love &quot;Seize the Day&quot;.&quot;

Attempts to name a street after Bellow in his Hyde Park neighborhood were halted by a local alderman on the grounds that Bellow had made remarks about the neighborhood&#x27;s inhabitants that they considered racist. A one-block stretch of West Augusta Boulevard in Humboldt Park was named Saul Bellow Way in his honor instead.

Bellow was a supporter of U.S. English, an organization formed in the early 1980s by John Tanton and former Senator S. I. Hayakawa, that supports making English the official language of the United States, but ended his association with the group in 1988.

<text>Stereochemistry, a subdiscipline of chemistry, studies the spatial arrangement of atoms that form the structure of molecules and their manipulation. The study of stereochemistry focuses on the relationships between stereoisomers, which are defined as having the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms (constitution) but differing in the geometric positioning of the atoms in space. For this reason, it is also known as 3D chemistry—the prefix &quot;stereo-&quot; means &quot;three-dimensionality&quot;. Stereochemistry applies to all kinds of compounds and ions, organic and inorganic species alike. Stereochemistry affects biological, physical, and supramolecular chemistry. 

Stereochemistry reactivity of the molecules in question (dynamic stereochemistry).

==History==
In 1815, Jean-Baptiste Biot&#x27;s observation of optical activity marked the beginning of organic stereochemistry history. He observed that organic molecules were able to rotate the plane of polarized light in a solution or in the gaseous phase. Despite Biot&#x27;s discoveries, Louis Pasteur is commonly described as the first stereochemist, having observed in 1842 that salts of tartaric acid collected from wine production vessels could rotate the plane of polarized light, but that salts from other sources did not. This was the only physical property that differed between the two types of tartrate salts, which is due to optical isomerism. In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff and Joseph Le Bel explained optical activity in terms of the tetrahedral arrangement of the atoms bound to carbon. Kekulé explored tetrahedral models earlier, in 1862, but never published his work; Emanuele Paternò probably knew of these but was the first to draw and discuss three dimensional structures, such as of 1,2-dibromoethane in the &quot;Giornale di Scienze Naturali ed Economiche&quot; in 1869. The term &quot;chiral&quot; was introduced by Lord Kelvin in 1904. Arthur Robertson Cushny, a Scottish Pharmacologist, first provided a clear example in 1908 of a bioactivity difference between enantiomers of a chiral molecule viz. (-)-Adrenaline is two times more potent than the (±)- form as a vasoconstrictor and in 1926 laid the foundation for chiral pharmacology/stereo-pharmacology (biological relations of optically isomeric substances). Later in 1966, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog nomenclature or Sequence rule was devised to assign absolute configuration to stereogenic/chiral center (R- and S- notation) and extended to be applied across olefinic bonds (E- and Z- notation).

==Significance==
Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules are part of a system for describing a molecule&#x27;s stereochemistry. They rank the atoms around a stereocenter in a standard way, allowing unambiguous descriptions of their relative positions in the molecule. A Fischer projection is a simplified way to depict the stereochemistry around a stereocenter.

===Thalidomide example===

Stereochemistry has important applications in the field of medicine, particularly pharmaceuticals. An often cited example of the importance of stereochemistry relates to the thalidomide disaster. Thalidomide is a pharmaceutical drug, first prepared in 1957 in Germany, prescribed for treating morning sickness in pregnant women. The drug was discovered to be teratogenic, causing serious genetic damage to early embryonic growth and development, leading to limb deformation in babies. Several proposed mechanisms of teratogenicity involve different biological functions for the (R)- and (S)-thalidomide enantiomers. In the human body, however, thalidomide undergoes racemization: even if only one of the two enantiomers is administered as a drug, the other enantiomer is produced as a result of metabolism. Accordingly, it is incorrect to state that one stereoisomer is safe while the other is teratogenic. Thalidomide is currently used for the treatment of other diseases, notably cancer and leprosy. Strict regulations and controls have been implemented to avoid its use by pregnant women and prevent developmental deformities. This disaster was a driving force behind requiring strict testing of drugs before making them available to the public.

In yet another example, the drug ibuprofen can exist as (R)- and (S)-isomers. Only the (S)-ibuprofen is active in reducing inflammation and pain.

==Types==

=== Atropisomers ===
Atropisomerism derives from the inability to rotate about a bond, such as due to steric hindrance between functional groups on two sp2-hybridized carbon atoms. Usually atropisomers are chiral, and as such they are a form of axial chirality. Atropisomerism can be described as conformational isomerism

=== Cis-Trans isomers ===
Cis-Trans isomers are often associated alkene double bonds.

The more general &quot;E&quot;/&quot;Z&quot; nomenclature refers to the concept of &quot;cis&quot;/&quot;trans&quot; isomerism, and is especially useful for more complex compounds.

=== Diastereomers ===
Diastereomers are non-superposable, non-identical stereoisomers. A common example of diastereomerism is when two compounds differ from each other by the (&quot;R&quot;)/(&quot;S&quot;) absolute configuration at some, but not all corresponding stereocenters. Epimers are diastereomers that differ at exactly one such position. &quot;cis&quot;/&quot;trans&quot; isomerism is another type of diastereomeric relationship.

* Example: The below pair can also be classified as epimers.

=== Enantiomers ===
Enantiomers are pairs of non-superposable mirror images. Each member of the pair has a distinct R.

=== Epimers ===
Epimers are a subcategory of diastereomers that differ in absolute configuration configurations at only one corresponding stereocenter. They are commonly found in sugar chemistry, where two sugars can differ by the configuration of a single carbon atom.

* Example: D-glucose and D-galactose are epimers, differing only at the C-4 position in their structure. (see sugar numbering)

<text>In physics, spacetime, also called the space-time continuum, is a mathematical model that fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional continuum. Spacetime diagrams are useful in visualizing and understanding relativistic effects, such as how different observers perceive &quot;where&quot; and &quot;when&quot; events occur.

Until the turn of the 20th century, the assumption had been that the three-dimensional geometry of the universe (its description in terms of locations, shapes, distances, and directions) was distinct from time (the measurement of when events occur within the universe). However, space and time took on new meanings with the Lorentz transformation and special theory of relativity.

In 1908, Hermann Minkowski presented a geometric interpretation of special relativity that fused time and the three spatial dimensions into a single four-dimensional continuum now known as Minkowski space. This interpretation proved vital to the general theory of relativity, wherein spacetime is curved by mass and energy.


== Fundamentals ==

=== Definitions ===
Non-relativistic classical mechanics treats time as a universal quantity of measurement that is uniform throughout, is separate from space, and is agreed on by all observers. Classical mechanics assumes that time has a constant rate of passage, independent of the observer&#x27;s state of motion, or anything external. It assumes that space is Euclidean: it assumes that space follows the geometry of common sense.

In the context of special relativity, time cannot be separated from the three dimensions of space, because the observed rate at which time passes for an object depends on the object&#x27;s velocity relative to the observer. General relativity provides an explanation of how gravitational fields can slow the passage of time for an object as seen by an observer outside the field.

In ordinary space, a position is specified by three numbers, known as dimensions. In the Cartesian coordinate system, these are often called &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot;. A point in spacetime is called an &quot;event&quot;, and requires four numbers to be specified: the three-dimensional location in space, plus the position in time (Fig. 1). An event is represented by a set of coordinates &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; and &quot;t&quot;. Spacetime is thus four-dimensional.

Unlike the analogies used in popular writings to explain events, such as firecrackers or sparks, mathematical events have zero duration and represent a single point in spacetime. Although it is possible to be in motion relative to the popping of a firecracker or a spark, it is not possible for an observer to be in motion relative to an event.

The path of a particle through spacetime can be considered to be a sequence of events. The series of events can be linked together to form a curve that represents the particle&#x27;s progress through spacetime. That path is called the particle&#x27;s &quot;world line&quot;.

Mathematically, spacetime is a &quot;manifold&quot;, which is to say, it appears locally &quot;flat&quot; near each point in the same way that, at small enough scales, the surface of a globe appears to be flat. A scale factor, formula_1 (conventionally called the &quot;speed-of-light&quot;) relates distances measured in space to distances measured in time. The magnitude of this scale factor (nearly in space being equivalent to one second in time), along with the fact that spacetime is a manifold, implies that at ordinary, non-relativistic speeds and at ordinary, human-scale distances, there is little that humans might observe that is noticeably different from what they might observe if the world were Euclidean. It was only with the advent of sensitive scientific measurements in the mid-1800s, such as the Fizeau experiment and the Michelson–Morley experiment, that puzzling discrepancies began to be noted between observation versus predictions based on the implicit assumption of Euclidean space.


In special relativity, an observer will, in most cases, mean a frame of reference from which a set of objects or events is being measured. This usage differs significantly from the ordinary English meaning of the term. Reference frames are inherently nonlocal constructs, and according to this usage of the term, it does not make sense to speak of an observer as having a location.

In Fig. 1-1, imagine that the frame under consideration is equipped with a dense lattice of clocks, synchronized within this reference frame, that extends indefinitely throughout the three dimensions of space. Any specific location within the lattice is not important. The latticework of clocks is used to determine the time and position of events taking place within the whole frame. The term &quot;observer&quot; refers to the whole ensemble of clocks associated with one inertial frame of reference.

In this idealized case, every point in space has a clock associated with it, and thus the clocks register each event instantly, with no time delay between an event and its recording. A real observer will see a delay between the emission of a signal and its detection due to the speed of light. To synchronize the clocks, in the data reduction following an experiment, the time when a signal is received will be corrected to reflect its actual time were it to have been recorded by an idealized lattice of clocks.

In many books on special relativity, especially older ones, the word &quot;observer&quot; is used in the more ordinary sense of the word. It is usually clear from context which meaning has been adopted.

Physicists distinguish between what one &quot;measures&quot; or &quot;observes&quot;, after one has factored out signal propagation delays, versus what one visually sees without such corrections. Failing to understand the difference between what one measures and what one sees is the source of much confusion among students of relativity.

== History ==


By the mid-1800s, various experiments such as the observation of the Arago spot and differential measurements of the speed of light in air versus water were considered to have proven the wave nature of light as opposed to a corpuscular theory. Propagation of waves was then assumed to require the existence of a &quot;waving&quot; medium; in the case of light waves, this was considered to be a hypothetical luminiferous aether. The various attempts to establish the properties of this hypothetical medium yielded contradictory results. For example, the Fizeau experiment of 1851, conducted by French physicist Hippolyte Fizeau, demonstrated that the speed of light in flowing water was less than the sum of the speed of light in air plus the speed of the water by an amount dependent on the water&#x27;s index of refraction.

Among other issues, the dependence of the partial aether-dragging implied by this experiment on the index of refraction (which is dependent on wavelength) led to the unpalatable conclusion that aether &quot;simultaneously&quot; flows at different speeds for different colors of light. The Michelson–Morley experiment of 1887 (Fig. 1-2) showed no differential influence of Earth&#x27;s motions through the hypothetical aether on the speed of light, and the most likely explanation, complete aether dragging, was in conflict with the observation of stellar aberration.

George Francis FitzGerald in 1889, and Hendrik Lorentz in 1892, independently proposed that material bodies traveling through the fixed aether were physically affected by their passage, contracting in the direction of motion by an amount that was exactly what was necessary to explain the negative results of the Michelson–Morley experiment. No length changes occur in directions transverse to the direction of motion.

By 1904, Lorentz had expanded his theory such that he had arrived at equations formally identical with those that Einstein was to derive later, i.e. the Lorentz transformation. As a theory of dynamics (the study of forces and torques and their effect on motion), his theory assumed actual physical deformations of the physical constituents of matter. Lorentz&#x27;s equations predicted a quantity that he called &quot;local time&quot;, with which he could explain the aberration of light, the Fizeau experiment and other phenomena.
Henri Poincaré was the first to combine space and time into spacetime. He argued in 1898 that the simultaneity of two events is a matter of convention. In 1900, he recognized that Lorentz&#x27;s &quot;local time&quot; is actually what is indicated by moving clocks by applying an explicitly &quot;operational definition&quot; of clock synchronization assuming constant light speed. In 1900 and 1904, he suggested the inherent undetectability of the aether by emphasizing the validity of what he called the principle of relativity. In 1905/1906 he mathematically perfected Lorentz&#x27;s theory of electrons in order to bring it into accordance with the postulate of relativity.

While discussing various hypotheses on Lorentz invariant gravitation, he introduced the innovative concept of a 4-dimensional spacetime by defining various four vectors, namely four-position, four-velocity, and four-force. He did not pursue the 4-dimensional formalism in subsequent papers, however, stating that this line of research seemed to &quot;entail great pain for limited profit&quot;, ultimately concluding &quot;that three-dimensional language seems the best suited to the description of our world&quot;. Even as late as 1909, Poincaré continued to describe the dynamical interpretation of the Lorentz transform.

In 1905, Albert Einstein analyzed special relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies without reference to forces) rather than dynamics. His results were mathematically equivalent to those of Lorentz and Poincaré. He obtained them by recognizing that the entire theory can be built upon two postulates: the principle of relativity and the principle of the constancy of light speed. His work was filled with vivid imagery involving the exchange of light signals between clocks in motion, careful measurements of the lengths of moving rods, and other such examples.

Einstein in 1905 superseded previous attempts of an electromagnetic mass–energy relation by introducing the general equivalence of mass and energy, which was instrumental for his subsequent formulation of the equivalence principle in 1907, which declares the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass. By using the mass–energy equivalence, Einstein showed that the gravitational mass of a body is proportional to its energy content, which was one of the early results in developing general relativity. While it would appear that he did not at first think geometrically about spacetime, in the further development of general relativity, Einstein fully incorporated the spacetime formalism.

When Einstein published in 1905, another of his competitors, his former mathematics professor Hermann Minkowski, had also arrived at most of the basic elements of special relativity. Max Born recounted a meeting he had made with Minkowski, seeking to be Minkowski&#x27;s student/collaborator:

Minkowski had been concerned with the state of electrodynamics after Michelson&#x27;s disruptive experiments at least since the summer of 1905, when Minkowski and David Hilbert led an advanced seminar attended by notable physicists of the time to study the papers of Lorentz, Poincaré et al. Minkowski saw Einstein&#x27;s work as an extension of Lorentz&#x27;s, and was most directly influenced by Poincaré.
On 5 November 1907 (a little more than a year before his death), Minkowski introduced his geometric interpretation of spacetime in a lecture to the Göttingen Mathematical society with the title, &quot;The Relativity Principle&quot; (&quot;Das Relativitätsprinzip&quot;). On 21 September 1908, Minkowski presented his talk, &quot;Space and Time&quot; (&quot;Raum und Zeit&quot;), to the German Society of Scientists and Physicians. The opening words of &quot;Space and Time&quot; include Minkowski&#x27;s statement that &quot;Henceforth, space for itself, and time for itself shall completely reduce to a mere shadow, and only some sort of union of the two shall preserve independence.&quot; &quot;Space and Time&quot; included the first public presentation of spacetime diagrams (Fig. 1-4), and included a remarkable demonstration that the concept of the &quot;invariant interval&quot; (discussed below), along with the empirical observation that the speed of light is finite, allows derivation of the entirety of special relativity.

The spacetime concept and the Lorentz group are closely connected to certain types of sphere, hyperbolic, or conformal geometries and their transformation groups already developed in the 19th century, in which invariant intervals analogous to the spacetime interval are used.

Einstein, for his part, was initially dismissive of Minkowski&#x27;s geometric interpretation of special relativity, regarding it as &quot;überflüssige Gelehrsamkeit&quot; (superfluous learnedness). However, in order to complete his search for general relativity that started in 1907, the geometric interpretation of relativity proved to be vital. In 1916, Einstein fully acknowledged his indebtedness to Minkowski, whose interpretation greatly facilitated the transition to general relativity. Since there are other types of spacetime, such as the curved spacetime of general relativity, the spacetime of special relativity is today known as &quot;Minkowski spacetime.&quot;

== Spacetime in special relativity ==
 
=== Spacetime interval ===

In three dimensions, the &quot;distance&quot; formula_2 between two points can be defined using the Pythagorean theorem:
: formula_3

Although two viewers may measure the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; position of the two points using different coordinate systems, the distance between the points will be the same for both, assuming that they are measuring using the same units. The distance is &quot;invariant&quot;.

In special relativity, however, the distance between two points is no longer the same if measured by two different observers, when one of the observers is moving, because of Lorentz contraction. The situation is even more complicated if the two points are separated in time as well as in space. For example, if one observer sees two events occur at the same place, but at different times, a person moving with respect to the first observer will see the two events occurring at different places, because the moving point of view sees itself as stationary, and the position of the event as receding or approaching. Thus, a different measure must be used to measure the effective &quot;distance&quot; between two events.

In four-dimensional spacetime, the analog to distance is the interval. Although time comes in as a fourth dimension, it is treated differently than the spatial dimensions. Minkowski space hence differs in important respects from four-dimensional Euclidean space. The fundamental reason for merging space and time into spacetime is that space and time are separately not invariant, which is to say that, under the proper conditions, different observers will disagree on the length of time between two events (because of time dilation) or the distance between the two events (because of length contraction). Special relativity provides a new invariant, called the spacetime interval, which combines distances in space and in time. All observers who measure the time and distance between any two events will end up computing the same spacetime interval. Suppose an observer measures two events as being separated in time by formula_4 and a spatial distance formula_5 Then the squared spacetime interval formula_6 between the two events that are separated by a distance formula_7 in space and by formula_8 in the formula_9-coordinate is:
: formula_10
or for three space dimensions,
: formula_11

The constant formula_12 the speed of light, converts time formula_13 units (like seconds) into space units (like meters). The squared interval formula_14 is a measure of separation between events A and B that are time separated and in addition space separated either because there are two separate objects undergoing events, or because a single object in space is moving inertially between its events. The separation interval is the difference between the square of the spatial distance separating event B from event A and the square of the spatial distance traveled by a light signal in that same time interval formula_4. If the event separation is due to a light signal, then this difference vanishes and formula_16.

When the event considered is infinitesimally close to each other, then we may write
: formula_17

In a different inertial frame, say with coordinates formula_18, the spacetime interval formula_19 can be written in a same form as above. Because of the constancy of speed of light, the light events in all inertial frames belong to zero interval, formula_20. For any other infinitesimal event where formula_21, one can prove that formula_22
which in turn upon integration leads to formula_23. The invariance of the spacetime interval between the same events for all inertial frames of reference is one of the fundamental results of special theory of relativity.

Although for brevity, one frequently sees interval expressions expressed without deltas, including in most of the following discussion, it should be understood that in general, formula_24 means formula_7, etc. We are always concerned with &quot;differences&quot; of spatial or temporal coordinate values belonging to two events, and since there is no preferred origin, single coordinate values have no essential meaning.

The equation above is similar to the Pythagorean theorem, except with a minus sign between the formula_26 and the formula_27 terms. The spacetime interval is the quantity formula_28 not formula_29 itself. The reason is that unlike distances in Euclidean geometry, intervals in Minkowski spacetime can be negative. Rather than deal with square roots of negative numbers, physicists customarily regard formula_30 as a distinct symbol in itself, rather than the square of something.
: Note: There are two sign conventions in use in the relativity literature:
:: formula_31
: and
:: formula_32
: These sign conventions are associated with the metric signatures and A minor variation is to place the time coordinate last rather than first. Both conventions are widely used within the field of study.
: In the following discussion, we use the first convention.

In general formula_30 can assume any real number value. If formula_30 is positive, the spacetime interval is referred to as timelike. Since spatial distance traversed by any massive object is always less than distance traveled by the light for the same time interval, positive intervals are always timelike. If formula_30 is negative, the spacetime interval is said to be spacelike. Spacetime intervals are equal to zero when formula_36 In other words, the spacetime interval between two events on the world line of something moving at the speed of light is zero. Such an interval is termed lightlike or null. A photon arriving in our eye from a distant star will not have aged, despite having (from our perspective) spent years in its passage.

A spacetime diagram is typically drawn with only a single space and a single time coordinate. Fig. 2-1 presents a spacetime diagram illustrating the world lines (i.e. paths in spacetime) of two photons, A and B, originating from the same event and going in opposite directions. In addition, C illustrates the world line of a slower-than-light-speed object. The vertical time coordinate is scaled by formula_1 so that it has the same units (meters) as the horizontal space coordinate. Since photons travel at the speed of light, their world lines have a slope of ±1. In other words, every meter that a photon travels to the left or right requires approximately 3.3 nanoseconds of time.

=== Reference frames ===

To gain insight in how spacetime coordinates measured by observers in different reference frames compare with each other, it is useful to work with a simplified setup with frames in a &quot;standard configuration.&quot; With care, this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached. In Fig. 2-2, two Galilean reference frames (i.e. conventional 3-space frames) are displayed in relative motion. Frame S belongs to a first observer O, and frame S′ (pronounced &quot;S prime&quot;) belongs to a second observer O′.
* The &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; axes of frame S are oriented parallel to the respective primed axes of frame S′.
* Frame S′ moves in the &quot;x&quot;-direction of frame S with a constant velocity &quot;v&quot; as measured in frame S.
* The origins of frames S and S′ are coincident when time &quot;t&quot; = 0 for frame S and for frame S′.

Fig. 2-3a redraws Fig. 2-2 in a different orientation. Fig. 2-3b illustrates a &quot;relativistic&quot; spacetime diagram from the viewpoint of observer O. Since S and S′ are in standard configuration, their origins coincide at times in frame S and in frame S′. The axis passes through the events in frame S′ which have But the points with are moving in the &quot;x&quot;-direction of frame S with velocity &quot;v&quot;, so that they are not coincident with the &quot;ct&quot; axis at any time other than zero. Therefore, the axis is tilted with respect to the &quot;ct&quot; axis by an angle &quot;θ&quot; given by
: formula_38

The &quot;x&quot;′ axis is also tilted with respect to the &quot;x&quot; axis. To determine the angle of this tilt, we recall that the slope of the world line of a light pulse is always ±1. Fig. 2-3c presents a spacetime diagram from the viewpoint of observer O′. Event P represents the emission of a light pulse at The pulse is reflected from a mirror situated a distance &quot;a&quot; from the light source (event Q), and returns to the light source at (event R).

The same events P, Q, R are plotted in Fig. 2-3b in the frame of observer O. The light paths have and −1, so that △PQR forms a right triangle with PQ and QR both at 45 degrees to the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;ct&quot; axes. Since the angle between and must also be &quot;θ&quot;.

While the rest frame has space and time axes that meet at right angles, the moving frame is drawn with axes that meet at an acute angle. The frames are actually equivalent. The asymmetry is due to unavoidable distortions in how spacetime coordinates can map onto a Cartesian plane, and should be considered no stranger than the manner in which, on a Mercator projection of the Earth, the relative sizes of land masses near the poles (Greenland and Antarctica) are highly exaggerated relative to land masses near the Equator.

=== Light cone ===

In Fig. 2–4, event O is at the origin of a spacetime diagram, and the two diagonal lines represent all events that have zero spacetime interval with respect to the origin event. These two lines form what is called the &quot;light cone&quot; of the event O, since adding a second spatial dimension (Fig. 2-5) makes the appearance that of two right circular cones meeting with their apices at O. One cone extends into the future (t&gt;0), the other into the past (t&lt;0).
A light (double) cone divides spacetime into separate regions with respect to its apex. The interior of the future light cone consists of all events that are separated from the apex by more &quot;time&quot; (temporal distance) than necessary to cross their &quot;spatial distance&quot; at lightspeed; these events comprise the &quot;timelike future&quot; of the event O. Likewise, the &quot;timelike past&quot; comprises the interior events of the past light cone. So in &quot;timelike intervals&quot; Δ&quot;ct&quot; is greater than Δ&quot;x&quot;, making timelike intervals positive.

The region exterior to the light cone consists of events that are separated from the event O by more &quot;space&quot; than can be crossed at lightspeed in the given &quot;time&quot;. These events comprise the so-called &quot;spacelike&quot; region of the event O, denoted &quot;Elsewhere&quot; in Fig. 2-4. Events on the light cone itself are said to be &quot;lightlike&quot; (or &quot;null separated&quot;) from O. Because of the invariance of the spacetime interval, all observers will assign the same light cone to any given event, and thus will agree on this division of spacetime.

The light cone has an essential role within the concept of causality. It is possible for a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time of O to the position and time of D (Fig. 2-4). It is hence possible for event O to have a causal influence on event D. The future light cone contains all the events that could be causally influenced by O. Likewise, it is possible for a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time of A, to the position and time of O. The past light cone contains all the events that could have a causal influence on O. In contrast, assuming that signals cannot travel faster than the speed of light, any event, like e.g. B or C, in the spacelike region (Elsewhere), cannot either affect event O, nor can they be affected by event O employing such signalling. Under this assumption any causal relationship between event O and any events in the spacelike region of a light cone is excluded.

=== Relativity of simultaneity ===
All observers will agree that for any given event, an event within the given event&#x27;s future light cone occurs &quot;after&quot; the given event. Likewise, for any given event, an event within the given event&#x27;s past light cone occurs &quot;before&quot; the given event. The before–after relationship observed for timelike-separated events remains unchanged no matter what the reference frame of the observer, i.e. no matter how the observer may be moving. The situation is quite different for spacelike-separated events. Fig. 2-4 was drawn from the reference frame of an observer moving at From this reference frame, event C is observed to occur after event O, and event B is observed to occur before event O.

From a different reference frame, the orderings of these non-causally-related events can be reversed. In particular, one notes that if two events are simultaneous in a particular reference frame, they are &quot;necessarily&quot; separated by a spacelike interval and thus are noncausally related. The observation that simultaneity is not absolute, but depends on the observer&#x27;s reference frame, is termed the relativity of simultaneity.

Fig. 2-6 illustrates the use of spacetime diagrams in the analysis of the relativity of simultaneity. The events in spacetime are invariant, but the coordinate frames transform as discussed above for Fig. 2-3. The three events are simultaneous from the reference frame of an observer moving at From the reference frame of an observer moving at the events appear to occur in the order From the reference frame of an observer moving at , the events appear to occur in the order . The white line represents a &quot;plane of simultaneity&quot; being moved from the past of the observer to the future of the observer, highlighting events residing on it. The gray area is the light cone of the observer, which remains invariant.

A spacelike spacetime interval gives the same distance that an observer would measure if the events being measured were simultaneous to the observer. A spacelike spacetime interval hence provides a measure of &quot;proper distance&quot;, i.e. the true distance = formula_39 Likewise, a timelike spacetime interval gives the same measure of time as would be presented by the cumulative ticking of a clock that moves along a given world line. A timelike spacetime interval hence provides a measure of the &quot;proper time&quot; = formula_40

=== Invariant hyperbola ===


In Euclidean space (having spatial dimensions only), the set of points equidistant (using the Euclidean metric) from some point form a circle (in two dimensions) or a sphere (in three dimensions). In Minkowski spacetime (having one temporal and one spatial dimension), the points at some constant spacetime interval away from the origin (using the Minkowski metric) form curves given by the two equations
: formula_41
with formula_42some positive real constant. These equations describe two families of hyperbolae in an &quot;x&quot;–&quot;ct&quot; spacetime diagram, which are termed &quot;invariant hyperbolae&quot;.

In Fig. 2-7a, each magenta hyperbola connects all events having some fixed spacelike separation from the origin, while the green hyperbolae connect events of equal timelike separation.

The magenta hyperbolae, which cross the &quot;x&quot; axis, are timelike curves, which is to say that these hyperbolae represent actual paths that can be traversed by (constantly accelerating) particles in spacetime: Between any two events on one hyperbola a causality relation is possible, because the inverse of the slope—representing the necessary speed—for all secants is less than formula_1. On the other hand, the green hyperbolae, which cross the &quot;ct&quot; axis, are spacelike curves because all intervals &quot;along&quot; these hyperbolae are spacelike intervals: No causality is possible between any two points on one of these hyperbolae, because all secants represent speeds larger than formula_1.

Fig. 2-7b reflects the situation in Minkowski spacetime (one temporal and two spatial dimensions) with the corresponding hyperboloids. The invariant hyperbolae displaced by spacelike intervals from the origin generate hyperboloids of one sheet, while the invariant hyperbolae displaced by timelike intervals from the origin generate hyperboloids of two sheets.

The (1+2)-dimensional boundary between space- and time-like hyperboloids, established by the events forming a zero spacetime interval to the origin, is made up by degenerating the hyperboloids to the light cone. In (1+1)-dimensions the hyperbolae degenerate to the two grey 45°-lines depicted in Fig. 2-7a.

=== Time dilation and length contraction ===

Fig. 2-8 illustrates the invariant hyperbola for all events that can be reached from the origin in a proper time of 5 meters (approximately ). Different world lines represent clocks moving at different speeds. A clock that is stationary with respect to the observer has a world line that is vertical, and the elapsed time measured by the observer is the same as the proper time. For a clock traveling at 0.3 &quot;c&quot;, the elapsed time measured by the observer is 5.24 meters (), while for a clock traveling at 0.7 &quot;c&quot;, the elapsed time measured by the observer is 7.00 meters ().

This illustrates the phenomenon known as time dilation. Clocks that travel faster take longer (in the observer frame) to tick out the same amount of proper time, and they travel further along the x–axis within that proper time than they would have without time dilation. The measurement of time dilation by two observers in different inertial reference frames is mutual. If observer O measures the clocks of observer O′ as running slower in his frame, observer O′ in turn will measure the clocks of observer O as running slower.

Length contraction, like time dilation, is a manifestation of the relativity of simultaneity. Measurement of length requires measurement of the spacetime interval between two events that are simultaneous in one&#x27;s frame of reference. But events that are simultaneous in one frame of reference are, in general, not simultaneous in other frames of reference.

Fig. 2-9 illustrates the motions of a 1 m rod that is traveling at 0.5 &quot;c&quot; along the &quot;x&quot; axis. The edges of the blue band represent the world lines of the rod&#x27;s two endpoints. The invariant hyperbola illustrates events separated from the origin by a spacelike interval of 1 m. The endpoints O and B measured when  = 0 are simultaneous events in the S′ frame. But to an observer in frame S, events O and B are not simultaneous. To measure length, the observer in frame S measures the endpoints of the rod as projected onto the &quot;x&quot;-axis along their world lines. The projection of the rod&#x27;s &quot;world sheet&quot; onto the &quot;x&quot; axis yields the foreshortened length OC.

(not illustrated) Drawing a vertical line through A so that it intersects the &quot;x&quot;′ axis demonstrates that, even as OB is foreshortened from the point of view of observer O, OA is likewise foreshortened from the point of view of observer O′. In the same way that each observer measures the other&#x27;s clocks as running slow, each observer measures the other&#x27;s rulers as being contracted.

In regards to mutual length contraction, Fig. 2-9 illustrates that the primed and unprimed frames are mutually rotated by a hyperbolic angle (analogous to ordinary angles in Euclidean geometry). Because of this rotation, the projection of a primed meter-stick onto the unprimed &quot;x&quot;-axis is foreshortened, while the projection of an unprimed meter-stick onto the primed x′-axis is likewise foreshortened.

=== Mutual time dilation and the twin paradox ===
==== Mutual time dilation ====
Mutual time dilation and length contraction tend to strike beginners as inherently self-contradictory concepts. If an observer in frame S measures a clock, at rest in frame S&#x27;, as running slower than his&#x27;, while S&#x27; is moving at speed &quot;v&quot; in S, then the principle of relativity requires that an observer in frame S&#x27; likewise measures a clock in frame S, moving at speed −&quot;v&quot; in S&#x27;, as running slower than hers. How two clocks can run &quot;both slower&quot; than the other, is an important question that &quot;goes to the heart of understanding special relativity.&quot;

This apparent contradiction stems from not correctly taking into account the different settings of the necessary, related measurements. These settings allow for a consistent explanation of the &quot;only apparent&quot; contradiction. It is not about the abstract ticking of two identical clocks, but about how to measure in one frame the temporal distance of two ticks of a moving clock. It turns out that in mutually observing the duration between ticks of clocks, each moving in the respective frame, different sets of clocks must be involved. In order to measure in frame S the tick duration of a moving clock W′ (at rest in S′), one uses &quot;two&quot; additional, synchronized clocks W1 and W2 at rest in two arbitrarily fixed points in S with the spatial distance &quot;d&quot;.

Conversely, for judging in frame S′ the temporal distance of two events on a moving clock W (at rest in S), one needs two clocks at rest in S′.

The necessary recordings for the two judgements, with &quot;one moving clock&quot; and &quot;two clocks at rest&quot; in respectively S or S′, involves two different sets, each with three clocks. Since there are different sets of clocks involved in the measurements, there is no inherent necessity that the measurements be reciprocally &quot;consistent&quot; such that, if one observer measures the moving clock to be slow, the other observer measures the one&#x27;s clock to be fast.
Fig. 2-10 illustrates the previous discussion of mutual time dilation with Minkowski diagrams. The upper picture reflects the measurements as seen from frame S &quot;at rest&quot; with unprimed, rectangular axes, and frame S′ &quot;moving with &quot;v&quot; &gt; 0&quot;, coordinatized by primed, oblique axes, slanted to the right; the lower picture shows frame S′ &quot;at rest&quot; with primed, rectangular coordinates, and frame S &quot;moving with −&quot;v&quot; &lt; 0&quot;, with unprimed, oblique axes, slanted to the left.

Each line drawn parallel to a spatial axis (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;′) represents a line of simultaneity. All events on such a line have the same time value (&quot;ct&quot;, &quot;ct&quot;′). Likewise, each line drawn parallel to a temporal axis (&quot;ct&quot;, &quot;ct′&quot;) represents a line of equal spatial coordinate values (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;′).
: 

To show the mutual time dilation immediately in the upper picture, the event &quot;D&quot; may be constructed as the event at &quot;x&quot;′ = 0 (the location of clock W′ in S′), that is simultaneous to &quot;C&quot; (&quot;OC&quot; has equal spacetime interval as &quot;OA&quot;) in S′. This shows that the time interval &quot;OD&quot; is longer than &quot;OA&quot;, showing that the &quot;moving&quot; clock runs slower.

In the lower picture the frame S is moving with velocity −&quot;v&quot; in the frame S′ at rest. The worldline of clock W is the &quot;ct&quot;-axis (slanted to the left), the worldline of W′1 is the vertical &quot;ct&quot;′-axis, and the worldline of W′2 is the vertical through event &quot;C&quot;, with &quot;ct&quot;′-coordinate &quot;D&quot;. The invariant hyperbola through event &quot;C&quot; scales the time interval &quot;OC&quot; to &quot;OA&quot;, which is shorter than &quot;OD&quot;; also, &quot;B&quot; is constructed (similar to &quot;D&quot; in the upper pictures) as simultaneous to &quot;A&quot; in S, at &quot;x&quot; = 0. The result &quot;OB&quot; &gt; &quot;OC&quot; corresponds again to above.

The word &quot;measure&quot; is important. In classical physics an observer cannot affect an observed object, but the object&#x27;s state of motion &quot;can&quot; affect the observer&#x27;s &quot;observations&quot; of the object.

==== Twin paradox ====
Many introductions to special relativity illustrate the differences between Galilean relativity and special relativity by posing a series of &quot;paradoxes&quot;. These paradoxes are, in fact, ill-posed problems, resulting from our unfamiliarity with velocities comparable to the speed of light. The remedy is to solve many problems in special relativity and to become familiar with its so-called counter-intuitive predictions. The geometrical approach to studying spacetime is considered one of the best methods for developing a modern intuition.

The twin paradox is a thought experiment involving identical twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket, returning home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more. This result appears puzzling because each twin observes the other twin as moving, and so at first glance, it would appear that each should find the other to have aged less. The twin paradox sidesteps the justification for mutual time dilation presented above by avoiding the requirement for a third clock. Nevertheless, the &quot;twin paradox&quot; is not a true paradox because it is easily understood within the context of special relativity.

The impression that a paradox exists stems from a misunderstanding of what special relativity states. Special relativity does not declare all frames of reference to be equivalent, only inertial frames. The traveling twin&#x27;s frame is not inertial during periods when she is accelerating. Furthermore, the difference between the twins is observationally detectable: the traveling twin needs to fire her rockets to be able to return home, while the stay-at-home twin does not.
These distinctions should result in a difference in the twins&#x27; ages. The spacetime diagram of Fig. 2-11 presents the simple case of a twin going straight out along the x axis and immediately turning back. From the standpoint of the stay-at-home twin, there is nothing puzzling about the twin paradox at all. The proper time measured along the traveling twin&#x27;s world line from O to C, plus the proper time measured from C to B, is less than the stay-at-home twin&#x27;s proper time measured from O to A to B. More complex trajectories require integrating the proper time between the respective events along the curve (i.e. the path integral) to calculate the total amount of proper time experienced by the traveling twin.

Complications arise if the twin paradox is analyzed from the traveling twin&#x27;s point of view.

Weiss&#x27;s nomenclature, designating the stay-at-home twin as Terence and the traveling twin as Stella, is hereafter used.

Stella is not in an inertial frame. Given this fact, it is sometimes incorrectly stated that full resolution of the twin paradox requires general relativity:
Although general relativity is not required to analyze the twin paradox, application of the Equivalence Principle of general relativity does provide some additional insight into the subject. Stella is not stationary in an inertial frame. Analyzed in Stella&#x27;s rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip. When she is coasting her rest frame is inertial, and Terence&#x27;s clock will appear to run slow. But when she fires her rockets for the turnaround, her rest frame is an accelerated frame and she experiences a force which is pushing her as if she were in a gravitational field. Terence will appear to be high up in that field and because of gravitational time dilation, his clock will appear to run fast, so much so that the net result will be that Terence has aged more than Stella when they are back together. The theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation are not exclusive to general relativity. Any theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the principle of equivalence, including Newton&#x27;s theory.
=== Gravitation ===
This introductory section has focused on the spacetime of special relativity, since it is the easiest to describe. Minkowski spacetime is flat, takes no account of gravity, is uniform throughout, and serves as nothing more than a static background for the events that take place in it. The presence of gravity greatly complicates the description of spacetime. In general relativity, spacetime is no longer a static background, but actively interacts with the physical systems that it contains. Spacetime curves in the presence of matter, can propagate waves, bends light, and exhibits a host of other phenomena. A few of these phenomena are described in the later sections of this article.

== Basic mathematics of spacetime ==
=== Galilean transformations ===

A basic goal is to be able to compare measurements made by observers in relative motion. If there is an observer O in frame S who has measured the time and space coordinates of an event, assigning this event three Cartesian coordinates and the time as measured on his lattice of synchronized clocks (see Fig. 1-1). A second observer O′ in a different frame S′ measures the same event in her coordinate system and her lattice of synchronized clocks . With inertial frames, neither observer is under acceleration, and a simple set of equations allows us to relate coordinates to . Given that the two coordinate systems are in standard configuration, meaning that they are aligned with parallel coordinates and that when , the coordinate transformation is as follows:
: formula_45
: formula_46
: formula_47
: formula_48
Fig. 3-1 illustrates that in Newton&#x27;s theory, time is universal, not the velocity of light. Consider the following thought experiment: The red arrow illustrates a train that is moving at 0.4 c with respect to the platform. Within the train, a passenger shoots a bullet with a speed of 0.4 c in the frame of the train. The blue arrow illustrates that a person standing on the train tracks measures the bullet as traveling at 0.8 c. This is in accordance with our naive expectations.

More generally, assuming that frame S′ is moving at velocity &quot;v&quot; with respect to frame S, then within frame S′, observer O′ measures an object moving with velocity . Velocity &quot;u&quot; with respect to frame S, since , , and , can be written as = = . This leads to and ultimately
: formula_49  or  formula_50
which is the common-sense Galilean law for the addition of velocities.
=== Relativistic composition of velocities ===
The composition of velocities is quite different in relativistic spacetime. To reduce the complexity of the equations slightly, we introduce a common shorthand for the ratio of the speed of an object relative to light,
: formula_51

Fig. 3-2a illustrates a red train that is moving forward at a speed given by . From the primed frame of the train, a passenger shoots a bullet with a speed given by , where the distance is measured along a line parallel to the red axis rather than parallel to the black &quot;x&quot; axis. What is the composite velocity &quot;u&quot; of the bullet relative to the platform, as represented by the blue arrow? Referring to Fig. 3-2b:
# From the platform, the composite speed of the bullet is given by .
# The two yellow triangles are similar because they are right triangles that share a common angle &quot;α&quot;. In the large yellow triangle, the ratio .
# The ratios of corresponding sides of the two yellow triangles are constant, so that = . So and .
# Substitute the expressions for &quot;b&quot; and &quot;r&quot; into the expression for &quot;u&quot; in step 1 to yield Einstein&#x27;s formula for the addition of velocities:
#: formula_52

The relativistic formula for addition of velocities presented above exhibits several important features:
* If and &quot;v&quot; are both very small compared with the speed of light, then the product /&quot;c&quot;2 becomes vanishingly small, and the overall result becomes indistinguishable from the Galilean formula (Newton&#x27;s formula) for the addition of velocities: &quot;u&quot; =  + &quot;v&quot;. The Galilean formula is a special case of the relativistic formula applicable to low velocities.
* If is set equal to &quot;c&quot;, then the formula yields &quot;u&quot; = &quot;c&quot; regardless of the starting value of &quot;v&quot;. The velocity of light is the same for all observers regardless their motions relative to the emitting source.

=== Time dilation and length contraction revisited ===


It is straightforward to obtain quantitative expressions for time dilation and length contraction. Fig. 3-3 is a composite image containing individual frames taken from two previous animations, simplified and relabeled for the purposes of this section.

To reduce the complexity of the equations slightly, there are a variety of different shorthand notations for &quot;ct&quot;:
: formula_53 and formula_54 are common.
: One also sees very frequently the use of the convention formula_55
In Fig. 3-3a, segments &quot;OA&quot; and &quot;OK&quot; represent equal spacetime intervals. Time dilation is represented by the ratio &quot;OB&quot;/&quot;OK&quot;. The invariant hyperbola has the equation where &quot;k&quot; = &quot;OK&quot;, and the red line representing the world line of a particle in motion has the equation &quot;w&quot; = &quot;x&quot;/&quot;β&quot; = &quot;xc&quot;/&quot;v&quot;. A bit of algebraic manipulation yields formula_56

The expression involving the square root symbol appears very frequently in relativity, and one over the expression is called the Lorentz factor, denoted by the Greek letter gamma formula_57:
: formula_58

If &quot;v&quot; is greater than or equal to &quot;c&quot;, the expression for formula_57 becomes physically meaningless, implying that &quot;c&quot; is the maximum possible speed in nature. For any &quot;v&quot; greater than zero, the Lorentz factor will be greater than one, although the shape of the curve is such that for low speeds, the Lorentz factor is extremely close to one.

In Fig. 3-3b, segments &quot;OA&quot; and &quot;OK&quot; represent equal spacetime intervals. Length contraction is represented by the ratio &quot;OB&quot;/&quot;OK&quot;. The invariant hyperbola has the equation , where &quot;k&quot; = &quot;OK&quot;, and the edges of the blue band representing the world lines of the endpoints of a rod in motion have slope 1/&quot;β&quot; = &quot;c&quot;/&quot;v&quot;. Event A has coordinates
(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) = (&quot;γk&quot;, &quot;γβk&quot;). Since the tangent line through A and B has the equation &quot;w&quot; = (&quot;x&quot; − &quot;OB&quot;)/&quot;β&quot;, we have &quot;γβk&quot; = (&quot;γk&quot; − &quot;OB&quot;)/&quot;β&quot; and
: formula_60

=== Lorentz transformations ===
The Galilean transformations and their consequent commonsense law of addition of velocities work well in our ordinary low-speed world of planes, cars and balls. Beginning in the mid-1800s, however, sensitive scientific instrumentation began finding anomalies that did not fit well with the ordinary addition of velocities.

Lorentz transformations are used to transform the coordinates of an event from one frame to another in special relativity.

The Lorentz factor appears in the Lorentz transformations:
: formula_61

The inverse Lorentz transformations are:
: formula_62

When &quot;v&quot; ≪ &quot;c&quot; and &quot;x&quot; is small enough, the &quot;v&quot;2/&quot;c&quot;2 and &quot;vx&quot;/&quot;c&quot;2 terms approach zero, and the Lorentz transformations approximate to the Galilean transformations.

formula_63 formula_64 etc., most often really mean formula_65 formula_66 etc. Although for brevity the Lorentz transformation equations are written without deltas, &quot;x&quot; means Δ&quot;x&quot;, etc. We are, in general, always concerned with the space and time &quot;differences&quot; between events.

Calling one set of transformations the normal Lorentz transformations and the other the inverse transformations is misleading, since there is no intrinsic difference between the frames. Different authors call one or the other set of transformations the &quot;inverse&quot; set. The forwards and inverse transformations are trivially related to each other, since the &quot;S&quot; frame can only be moving forwards or reverse with respect to . So inverting the equations simply entails switching the primed and unprimed variables and replacing &quot;v&quot; with −&quot;v&quot;.
1).

==== Deriving the Lorentz transformations ====
There have been many dozens of derivations of the Lorentz transformations since Einstein&#x27;s original work in 1905, each with its particular focus. Although Einstein&#x27;s derivation was based on the invariance of the speed of light, there are other physical principles that may serve as starting points. Ultimately, these alternative starting points can be considered different expressions of the underlying principle of locality, which states that the influence that one particle exerts on another can not be transmitted instantaneously.

The derivation given here and illustrated in Fig. 3-5 is based on one presented by Bais and makes use of previous results from the Relativistic Composition of Velocities, Time Dilation, and Length Contraction sections. Event P has coordinates (&quot;w&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) in the black &quot;rest system&quot; and coordinates in the red frame that is moving with velocity parameter . To determine and in terms of &quot;w&quot; and &quot;x&quot; (or the other way around) it is easier at first to derive the &quot;inverse&quot; Lorentz transformation.
#There can be no such thing as length expansion/contraction in the transverse directions. &quot;y″&quot; must equal &quot;y&quot; and must equal &quot;z&quot;, otherwise whether a fast moving 1 m ball could fit through a 1 m circular hole would depend on the observer. The first postulate of relativity states that all inertial frames are equivalent, and transverse expansion/contraction would violate this law.
# From the drawing, &quot;w&quot; = &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; and 
# From previous results using similar triangles, we know that .
# Because of time dilation, 
# Substituting equation (4) into yields .
# Length contraction and similar triangles give us and 
# Substituting the expressions for &quot;s&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;r&quot; and &quot;b&quot; into the equations in Step 2 immediately yield
#: formula_67
#: formula_68

The above equations are alternate expressions for the t and x equations of the inverse Lorentz transformation, as can be seen by substituting &quot;ct&quot; for &quot;w&quot;, for , and &quot;v&quot;/&quot;c&quot; for &quot;β&quot;. From the inverse transformation, the equations of the forwards transformation can be derived by solving for and .

==== Linearity of the Lorentz transformations ====
The Lorentz transformations have a mathematical property called linearity, since and are obtained as linear combinations of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, with no higher powers involved. The linearity of the transformation reflects a fundamental property of spacetime that was tacitly assumed in the derivation, namely, that the properties of inertial frames of reference are independent of location and time. In the absence of gravity, spacetime looks the same everywhere. All inertial observers will agree on what constitutes accelerating and non-accelerating motion. Any one observer can use her own measurements of space and time, but there is nothing absolute about them. Another observer&#x27;s conventions will do just as well.

A result of linearity is that if two Lorentz transformations are applied sequentially, the result is also a Lorentz transformation.

=== Doppler effect ===
The Doppler effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for a receiver and source in relative motion. For simplicity, we consider here two basic scenarios: (1) The motions of the source and/or receiver are exactly along the line connecting them (longitudinal Doppler effect), and (2) the motions are at right angles to the said line (transverse Doppler effect). We are ignoring scenarios where they move along intermediate angles.

==== Longitudinal Doppler effect ====
The classical Doppler analysis deals with waves that are propagating in a medium, such as sound waves or water ripples, and which are transmitted between sources and receivers that are moving towards or away from each other. The analysis of such waves depends on whether the source, the receiver, or both are moving relative to the medium. Given the scenario where the receiver is stationary with respect to the medium, and the source is moving directly away from the receiver at a speed of &quot;vs&quot; for a velocity parameter of &quot;βs&quot;, the wavelength is increased, and the observed frequency &quot;f&quot; is given by
: formula_69

On the other hand, given the scenario where source is stationary, and the receiver is moving directly away from the source at a speed of &quot;vr&quot; for a velocity parameter of &quot;βr&quot;, the wavelength is &quot;not&quot; changed, but the transmission velocity of the waves relative to the receiver is decreased, and the observed frequency &quot;f&quot; is given by
: formula_70
Light, unlike sound or water ripples, does not propagate through a medium, and there is no distinction between a source moving away from the receiver or a receiver moving away from the source. Fig. 3-6 illustrates a relativistic spacetime diagram showing a source separating from the receiver with a velocity parameter formula_71 so that the separation between source and receiver at time formula_72 is formula_73. Because of time dilation, formula_74 Since the slope of the green light ray is −1, formula_75 Hence, the relativistic Doppler effect is given by
: formula_76

==== Transverse Doppler effect ====

Suppose that a source and a receiver, both approaching each other in uniform inertial motion along non-intersecting lines, are at their closest approach to each other. It would appear that the classical analysis predicts that the receiver detects no Doppler shift. Due to subtleties in the analysis, that expectation is not necessarily true. Nevertheless, when appropriately defined, transverse Doppler shift is a relativistic effect that has no classical analog. The subtleties are these:
&lt;!—end plainlist—&gt;
In scenario (a), the point of closest approach is frame-independent and represents the moment where there is no change in distance versus time (i.e. dr/dt = 0 where &quot;r&quot; is the distance between receiver and source) and hence no longitudinal Doppler shift. The source observes the receiver as being illuminated by light of frequency , but also observes the receiver as having a time-dilated clock. In frame S, the receiver is therefore illuminated by blueshifted light of frequency
: formula_77

In scenario (b) the illustration shows the receiver being illuminated by light from when the source was closest to the receiver, even though the source has moved on. Because the source&#x27;s clocks are time dilated as measured in frame S, and since dr/dt was equal to zero at this point, the light from the source, emitted from this closest point, is redshifted with frequency
: formula_78

Scenarios (c) and (d) can be analyzed by simple time dilation arguments. In (c), the receiver observes light from the source as being blueshifted by a factor of formula_57, and in (d), the light is redshifted. The only seeming complication is that the orbiting objects are in accelerated motion. However, if an inertial observer looks at an accelerating clock, only the clock&#x27;s instantaneous speed is important when computing time dilation. (The converse, however, is not true.) Most reports of transverse Doppler shift refer to the effect as a redshift and analyze the effect in terms of scenarios (b) or (d).

=== Energy and momentum ===
==== Extending momentum to four dimensions ====

In classical mechanics, the state of motion of a particle is characterized by its mass and its velocity. Linear momentum, the product of a particle&#x27;s mass and velocity, is a vector quantity, possessing the same direction as the velocity: . It is a &quot;conserved&quot; quantity, meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum cannot change.

In relativistic mechanics, the momentum vector is extended to four dimensions. Added to the momentum vector is a time component that allows the spacetime momentum vector to transform like the spacetime position vector . In exploring the properties of the spacetime momentum, we start, in Fig. 3-8a, by examining what a particle looks like at rest. In the rest frame, the spatial component of the momentum is zero, i.e. , but the time component equals &quot;mc&quot;.

We can obtain the transformed components of this vector in the moving frame by using the Lorentz transformations, or we can read it directly from the figure because we know that and , since the red axes are rescaled by gamma. Fig. 3-8b illustrates the situation as it appears in the moving frame. It is apparent that the space and time components of the four-momentum go to infinity as the velocity of the moving frame approaches &quot;c&quot;.

We will use this information shortly to obtain an expression for the four-momentum.

==== Momentum of light ====

Light particles, or photons, travel at the speed of &quot;c&quot;, the constant that is conventionally known as the &quot;speed of light&quot;. This statement is not a tautology, since many modern formulations of relativity do not start with constant speed of light as a postulate. Photons therefore propagate along a lightlike world line and, in appropriate units, have equal space and time components for every observer.

A consequence of Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electromagnetism is that light carries energy and momentum, and that their ratio is a constant: . Rearranging, , and since for photons, the space and time components are equal, &quot;E&quot;/&quot;c&quot; must therefore be equated with the time component of the spacetime momentum vector.

Photons travel at the speed of light, yet have finite momentum and energy. For this to be so, the mass term in &quot;γmc&quot; must be zero, meaning that photons are massless particles. Infinity times zero is an ill-defined quantity, but &quot;E&quot;/&quot;c&quot; is well-defined.

By this analysis, if the energy of a photon equals &quot;E&quot; in the rest frame, it equals in a moving frame. This result can be derived by inspection of Fig. 3-9 or by application of the Lorentz transformations, and is consistent with the analysis of Doppler effect given previously.

==== Mass–energy relationship ====
Consideration of the interrelationships between the various components of the relativistic momentum vector led Einstein to several important conclusions.

*In the low speed limit as approaches zero, approaches 1, so the spatial component of the relativistic momentum approaches &quot;mv&quot;, the classical term for momentum. Following this perspective, &quot;γm&quot; can be interpreted as a relativistic generalization of &quot;m&quot;. Einstein proposed that the &quot;relativistic mass&quot; of an object increases with velocity according to the formula .
*Likewise, comparing the time component of the relativistic momentum with that of the photon, , so that Einstein arrived at the relationship . Simplified to the case of zero velocity, this is Einstein&#x27;s equation relating energy and mass.

Another way of looking at the relationship between mass and energy is to consider a series expansion of at low velocity:
: formula_80 formula_81
The second term is just an expression for the kinetic energy of the particle. Mass indeed appears to be another form of energy.

The concept of relativistic mass that Einstein introduced in 1905, &quot;m&quot;rel, although amply validated every day in particle accelerators around the globe (or indeed in any instrumentation whose use depends on high velocity particles, such as electron microscopes, old-fashioned color television sets, etc.), has nevertheless not proven to be a &quot;fruitful&quot; concept in physics in the sense that it is not a concept that has served as a basis for other theoretical development. Relativistic mass, for instance, plays no role in general relativity.

For this reason, as well as for pedagogical concerns, most physicists currently prefer a different terminology when referring to the relationship between mass and energy. &quot;Relativistic mass&quot; is a deprecated term. The term &quot;mass&quot; by itself refers to the rest mass or invariant mass, and is equal to the invariant length of the relativistic momentum vector. Expressed as a formula,
: formula_82
This formula applies to all particles, massless as well as massive. For photons where &quot;m&quot;rest equals zero, it yields, .

==== Four-momentum ====
Because of the close relationship between mass and energy, the four-momentum (also called 4-momentum) is also called the energy–momentum 4-vector. Using an uppercase &quot;P&quot; to represent the four-momentum and a lowercase p to denote the spatial momentum, the four-momentum may be written as
: formula_83 or alternatively,
: formula_84 using the convention that formula_85

=== Conservation laws ===
In physics, conservation laws state that certain particular measurable properties of an isolated physical system do not change as the system evolves over time. In 1915, Emmy Noether discovered that underlying each conservation law is a fundamental symmetry of nature. The fact that physical processes do not care &quot;where&quot; in space they take place (space translation symmetry) yields conservation of momentum, the fact that such processes do not care &quot;when&quot; they take place (time translation symmetry) yields conservation of energy, and so on. In this section, we examine the Newtonian views of conservation of mass, momentum and energy from a relativistic perspective.

==== Total momentum ====

To understand how the Newtonian view of conservation of momentum needs to be modified in a relativistic context, we examine the problem of two colliding bodies limited to a single dimension.

In Newtonian mechanics, two extreme cases of this problem may be distinguished yielding mathematics of minimum complexity:
: (1) The two bodies rebound from each other in a completely elastic collision.
: (2) The two bodies stick together and continue moving as a single particle. This second case is the case of completely inelastic collision.
For both cases (1) and (2), momentum, mass, and total energy are conserved. However, kinetic energy is not conserved in cases of inelastic collision. A certain fraction of the initial kinetic energy is converted to heat.

In case (2), two masses with momentums 
and collide to produce a single particle of conserved mass traveling at the center of mass velocity of the original system, formula_86. The total momentum is conserved.

Fig. 3-10 illustrates the inelastic collision of two particles from a relativistic perspective. The time components and add up to total &quot;E/c&quot; of the resultant vector, meaning that energy is conserved. Likewise, the space components and add up to form &quot;p&quot; of the resultant vector. The four-momentum is, as expected, a conserved quantity. However, the invariant mass of the fused particle, given by the point where the invariant hyperbola of the total momentum intersects the energy axis, is not equal to the sum of the invariant masses of the individual particles that collided. Indeed, it is larger than the sum of the individual masses: .

Looking at the events of this scenario in reverse sequence, we see that non-conservation of mass is a common occurrence: when an unstable elementary particle spontaneously decays into two lighter particles, total energy is conserved, but the mass is not. Part of the mass is converted into kinetic energy.

==== Choice of reference frames ====

The freedom to choose any frame in which to perform an analysis allows us to pick one which may be particularly convenient. For analysis of momentum and energy problems, the most convenient frame is usually the &quot;center-of-momentum frame&quot; (also called the zero-momentum frame, or COM frame). This is the frame in which the space component of the system&#x27;s total momentum is zero. Fig. 3-11 illustrates the breakup of a high speed particle into two daughter particles. In the lab frame, the daughter particles are preferentially emitted in a direction oriented along the original particle&#x27;s trajectory. In the COM frame, however, the two daughter particles are emitted in opposite directions, although their masses and the magnitude of their velocities are generally not the same.

==== Energy and momentum conservation ====
In a Newtonian analysis of interacting particles, transformation between frames is simple because all that is necessary is to apply the Galilean transformation to all velocities. Since , the momentum . If the total momentum of an interacting system of particles is observed to be conserved in one frame, it will likewise be observed to be conserved in any other frame.

Conservation of momentum in the COM frame amounts to the requirement that both before and after collision. In the Newtonian analysis, conservation of mass dictates that . In the simplified, one-dimensional scenarios that we have been considering, only one additional constraint is necessary before the outgoing momenta of the particles can be determined—an energy condition. In the one-dimensional case of a completely elastic collision with no loss of kinetic energy, the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles in the COM frame will be precisely equal and opposite to their incoming velocities. In the case of a completely inelastic collision with total loss of kinetic energy, the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles will be zero.

Newtonian momenta, calculated as , fail to behave properly under Lorentzian transformation. The linear transformation of velocities is replaced by the highly nonlinear
 so that a calculation demonstrating conservation of momentum in one frame will be invalid in other frames. Einstein was faced with either having to give up conservation of momentum, or to change the definition of momentum. This second option was what he chose.
The relativistic conservation law for energy and momentum replaces the three classical conservation laws for energy, momentum and mass. Mass is no longer conserved independently, because it has been subsumed into the total relativistic energy. This makes the relativistic conservation of energy a simpler concept than in nonrelativistic mechanics, because the total energy is conserved without any qualifications. Kinetic energy converted into heat or internal potential energy shows up as an increase in mass.

=== Is spacetime really curved? ===
In Poincaré&#x27;s conventionalist views, the essential criteria according to which one should select a Euclidean versus non-Euclidean geometry would be economy and simplicity. A realist would say that Einstein discovered spacetime to be non-Euclidean. A conventionalist would say that Einstein merely found it &quot;more convenient&quot; to use non-Euclidean geometry. The conventionalist would maintain that Einstein&#x27;s analysis said nothing about what the geometry of spacetime &quot;really&quot; is.

Such being said,
:# Is it possible to represent general relativity in terms of flat spacetime?
:# Are there any situations where a flat spacetime interpretation of general relativity may be &quot;more convenient&quot; than the usual curved spacetime interpretation?

In response to the first question, a number of authors including Deser, Grishchuk, Rosen, Weinberg, etc. have provided various formulations of gravitation as a field in a flat manifold. Those theories are variously called &quot;bimetric gravity&quot;, the &quot;field-theoretical approach to general relativity&quot;, and so forth. Kip Thorne has provided a popular review of these theories.

The flat spacetime paradigm posits that matter creates a gravitational field that causes rulers to shrink when they are turned from circumferential orientation to radial, and that causes the ticking rates of clocks to dilate. The flat spacetime paradigm is fully equivalent to the curved spacetime paradigm in that they both represent the same physical phenomena. However, their mathematical formulations are entirely different. Working physicists routinely switch between using curved and flat spacetime techniques depending on the requirements of the problem. The flat spacetime paradigm is convenient when performing approximate calculations in weak fields. Hence, flat spacetime techniques tend be used when solving gravitational wave problems, while curved spacetime techniques tend be used in the analysis of black holes.

=== Asymptotic symmetries ===
The spacetime symmetry group for Special Relativity is the Poincaré group, which is a ten-dimensional group of three Lorentz boosts, three rotations, and four spacetime translations. It is logical to ask what symmetries if any might apply in General Relativity. A tractable case might be to consider the symmetries of spacetime as seen by observers located far away from all sources of the gravitational field. The naive expectation for asymptotically flat spacetime symmetries might be simply to extend and reproduce the symmetries of flat spacetime of special relativity, &quot;viz.&quot;, the Poincaré group.

In 1962 Hermann Bondi, M. G. van der Burg, A. W. Metzner and Rainer K. Sachs addressed this asymptotic symmetry problem in order to investigate the flow of energy at infinity due to propagating gravitational waves. Their first step was to decide on some physically sensible boundary conditions to place on the gravitational field at lightlike infinity to characterize what it means to say a metric is asymptotically flat, making no &quot;a priori&quot; assumptions about the nature of the asymptotic symmetry group—not even the assumption that such a group exists. Then after designing what they considered to be the most sensible boundary conditions, they investigated the nature of the resulting asymptotic symmetry transformations that leave invariant the form of the boundary conditions appropriate for asymptotically flat gravitational fields.

What they found was that the asymptotic symmetry transformations actually do form a group and the structure of this group does not depend on the particular gravitational field that happens to be present. This means that, as expected, one can separate the kinematics of spacetime from the dynamics of the gravitational field at least at spatial infinity. The puzzling surprise in 1962 was their discovery of a rich infinite-dimensional group (the so-called BMS group) as the asymptotic symmetry group, instead of the finite-dimensional Poincaré group, which is a subgroup of the BMS group. Not only are the Lorentz transformations asymptotic symmetry transformations, there are also additional transformations that are not Lorentz transformations but are asymptotic symmetry transformations. In fact, they found an additional infinity of transformation generators known as &quot;supertranslations&quot;. This implies the conclusion that General Relativity (GR) does &quot;not&quot; reduce to special relativity in the case of weak fields at long distances.

=== Riemannian geometry ===


=== Curved manifolds ===
For physical reasons, a spacetime continuum is mathematically defined as a four-dimensional, smooth, connected Lorentzian manifold formula_87. This means the smooth Lorentz metric formula_88 has signature formula_89. The metric determines the &quot;&quot;, as well as determining the geodesics of particles and light beams. About each point (event) on this manifold, coordinate charts are used to represent observers in reference frames. Usually, Cartesian coordinates formula_90 are used. Moreover, for simplicity&#x27;s sake, units of measurement are usually chosen such that the speed of light formula_1 is equal to 1.

A reference frame (observer) can be identified with one of these coordinate charts; any such observer can describe any event formula_92. Another reference frame may be identified by a second coordinate chart about formula_92. Two observers (one in each reference frame) may describe the same event formula_92 but obtain different descriptions.

Usually, many overlapping coordinate charts are needed to cover a manifold. Given two coordinate charts, one containing formula_92 (representing an observer) and another containing formula_96 (representing another observer), the intersection of the charts represents the region of spacetime in which both observers can measure physical quantities and hence compare results. The relation between the two sets of measurements is given by a non-singular coordinate transformation on this intersection. The idea of coordinate charts as local observers who can perform measurements in their vicinity also makes good physical sense, as this is how one actually collects physical data—locally.

For example, two observers, one of whom is on Earth, but the other one who is on a fast rocket to Jupiter, may observe a comet crashing into Jupiter (this is the event formula_92). In general, they will disagree about the exact location and timing of this impact, i.e., they will have different 4-tuples formula_90 (as they are using different coordinate systems). Although their kinematic descriptions will differ, dynamical (physical) laws, such as momentum conservation and the first law of thermodynamics, will still hold. In fact, relativity theory requires more than this in the sense that it stipulates these (and all other physical) laws must take the same form in all coordinate systems. This introduces tensors into relativity, by which all physical quantities are represented.

Geodesics are said to be timelike, null, or spacelike if the tangent vector to one point of the geodesic is of this nature. Paths of particles and light beams in spacetime are represented by timelike and null (lightlike) geodesics, respectively.

<text>SimCity (also known as the retronyms Micropolis or SimCity Classic) is a city-building simulation video game developed by Will Wright, and released for several platforms from 1989 to 1991. &quot;SimCity&quot; features two-dimensional graphics and an overhead perspective. The game&#x27;s objective is to create a city, develop residential and industrial areas, build infrastructure, and collect taxes for further city development. Importance is placed on increasing the population&#x27;s standard of living, maintaining a balance between the different sectors, and monitoring the region&#x27;s environmental situations to prevent the settlement from declining and going bankrupt.

&quot;SimCity&quot; was independently developed by Will Wright, beginning in 1985; the game was not released until 1989. Because the game lacked any arcade or action elements that dominated the video game market in the 1980s, video game publishers declined to release the title for fear of its commercial failure until Broderbund eventually agreed to distribute it. Although the game initially sold poorly, positive feedback from the gaming press boosted its sales. After becoming a best-seller, &quot;SimCity&quot; was released on several other platforms, most notably on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in 1991. Its gameplay was significantly revised with Nintendo&#x27;s involvement.

&quot;SimCity&quot; sold 300,000 units for personal computers and nearly 2 million units for the Super NES. &quot;SimCity&quot; was met with critical acclaim for its innovative and addictive gameplay despite the absence of action elements. Reviewers considered the game instructive and helpful toward the player&#x27;s understanding of urban planning, politics, and economics. &quot;SimCity&quot; received numerous awards from news publishers and associations. The success of &quot;SimCity&quot; marked the beginning of the urban simulation genre of video games, as well as publisher Maxis&#x27; tradition of producing non-linear simulation games, one of which – &quot;The Sims&quot; – would surpass all its predecessors in popularity and become one of the best-selling franchises in the video game industry.

==Gameplay==
The core concept of &quot;SimCity&quot; is to build and design a city without specific goals to achieve. The player may divide land into commercial, industrial, or residential zones, add buildings, change the tax rate, build a power grid, build transportation systems and take any other actions to enhance the city. Once able to construct buildings in a particular area, the too-small-to-see residents, known as &quot;Sims&quot;, may choose to construct and upgrade houses, apartment blocks, light, heavy industrial buildings, commercial buildings, hospitals, churches, and other structures. The Sims make these choices based on such factors as traffic levels, availability of electrical power, crime levels, and proximity to other types of buildings—for example, residential areas next to a power plant will seldom appreciate the highest grade of housing. In the Super NES version and later, the player can also build rewards when they are given, such as the mayor&#x27;s mansion or a casino.

The player may face disasters including floods, tornadoes, fires (often from air disasters or shipwrecks), earthquakes and monster attacks. In addition, monsters and tornadoes can trigger train crashes by running into passing trains.

===Scenarios===
SimCity features goal-oriented, time-limited scenarios that are contingent on the player&#x27;s performance and could result in either a win or a loss. The implementation of scenarios was suggested by Broderbund, as a means of transforming SimCity into a more traditional game format. This addition was intended to enhance the overall experience for players, by introducing clearly defined objectives and increasing the level of challenge in the game. In SimCity, the initial cities were modeled after real-world cities and endeavored to replicate their general layout. Although the majority of scenarios featured in the game exist within a fictional timeline or involve a city besieged by an imaginary catastrophe, a select few are based on genuine historical events. This incorporation of actual historical events adds a unique layer of realism to the game and enables players to engage with significant moments in history in a novel way.

==Development==

&quot;SimCity&quot; was developed by game designer Will Wright. While working on the game &quot;Raid on Bungeling Bay&quot;, in which the player flies a helicopter dropping bombs on islands, Wright found he enjoyed designing the islands in the level editor rather than playing the actual game. This led him to develop increasingly sophisticated level editors. At the same time, Wright was cultivating a love of the intricacies and theories of urban planning and acknowledges the influence of System Dynamics which was developed by Jay Wright Forrester and whose book on the subject laid the foundations for what would become &quot;SimCity&quot;. In addition, Wright also was inspired by reading &quot;The Seventh Sally&quot;, a short story from &quot;The Cyberiad&quot; by Stanisław Lem, in which an engineer encounters a deposed tyrant, and creates a miniature city with artificial citizens for the tyrant to oppress. The game reflected Wright&#x27;s approval of mass transit and disapproval of nuclear power; Maxis president Jeff Braun stated &quot;We&#x27;re pushing political agendas&quot;.

The first version of the game was developed for the Commodore 64 in 1985; it was not published for another four years. The original working title of &quot;SimCity&quot; was &quot;Micropolis&quot;. The game was unusual in that it could neither be won or lost; as a result, game publishers did not believe it was possible to market and sell such a game successfully. Broderbund declined to publish the title when Wright proposed it, and he pitched it to a range of major game publishers without success. Finally, Braun, founder of the tiny software company Maxis, agreed to publish &quot;SimCity&quot; as one of two initial games for the company.

Wright and Braun returned to Broderbund to formally clear the rights to the game in 1988, when &quot;SimCity&quot; was near completion. After Broderbund executives Gary Carlston and Don Daglow saw &quot;SimCity&quot;, they signed Maxis to a distribution deal for both of its initial games. With that, four years after initial development, &quot;SimCity&quot; was released for the Amiga and Macintosh platforms, followed by the IBM PC and Commodore 64 later in 1989.

==Ports and versions==

After the original release on the Amiga and Macintosh, the game was released on the Commodore 64 and IBM PC compatibles, and afterward saw more releases for computers and video game consoles: Atari ST, Acorn Archimedes, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, EPOC32, mobile phone, Internet, Windows, FM-Towns, OLPC XO-1 and News HyperLook on Sun Unix. The game is available as a multiplayer version for X11 Tcl/Tk on various Unix, Linux, DESQview and OS/2 operating systems.

Shortly after the game&#x27;s initial release, Maxis released the SimCity Terrain Editor for the original versions of the game, which was sold as a mail-order add-on in North America but gained a standalone retail release in Europe. The Terrain Editor is a simple tool that allows the user to create maps with forest, land, and water portions. In 1990, Maxis developed two &#x27;Graphics Sets&#x27; packs for the MS-DOS and Amiga versions: &quot;Ancient Cities&quot; and &quot;Future Cities&quot;. Each pack contained themed sets which changed the graphics and messages in the game to fit certain themes.

In 1991, an enhanced version of the game was released for Windows 3.0/3.1. It runs in the Windows GDI with new sounds and music, either PC-Speaker type or digital/MIDI type. In 1992, to coincide with other re-releases of their games, Maxis re-released the Windows version of SimCity as &quot;SimCity Classic&quot;, which bundled the game with the MS-DOS version of the Terrain Editor. The Graphics Sets were also reissued to run on Windows 3.1 as well. &quot;SimCity Classic&quot; was re-released in 1993 as part of the &quot;SimClassics Volume 1&quot; compilation alongside &quot;SimAnt&quot; and &quot;SimLife&quot; for PC, Mac and Amiga. In 1995, a Windows 95 compatible version of the game titled &quot;SimCity Deluxe CD-ROM&quot; was released, which included new 256-color graphics and sound, and bundled the Graphics Sets and an updated Terrain Editor together with the base game.

In 1994, Interplay Productions developed and published under license from Maxis a version of the game titled &quot;SimCity Enhanced CD-ROM&quot; for DOS, which included 256 color graphics and FMV movies that would trigger events.

===Super NES===

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) followed a mid-1989 call to Maxis co-founder Jeff Braun from Nintendo expressing interest in porting the game, as Nintendo developer Shigeru Miyamoto was very interested in how the game allowed the player to create their own world. Braun flew to Nintendo of America&#x27;s headquarters to meet with chairman Howard Lincoln and president Minoru Arakawa. They offered Braun to do all the porting to the Super NES, paying Maxis $1 for every copy sold, and offering Braun a $1 million check for accepting the deal on the spot, which Braun accepted. During this development time, Miyamoto would work alongside Wright to develop means to bring the game to the console.

&quot;SimCity&quot; for the Super NES features the same gameplay and scenario features; however, since it was developed and published by Nintendo, the company incorporated their own ideas. Instead of the Godzilla monster disaster, Bowser of the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series becomes the attacking monster, and once the city reaches a landmark 500,000 populace, the player receives a Mario statue that can be placed in the city. The Super NES port also features special buildings the player may receive as rewards, such as casinos, large parks, amusement parks, and expo centers; some of which would be incorporated into &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;. A bank can be built which will allow a loan of $10,000 to be taken, but it must be paid back before another loan can be taken out. The game includes schools and hospitals, though they cannot be placed by the player; instead, the game will sometimes turn an empty residential lot into one. There are city classifications, such as becoming a metropolis of 100,000 people. It has some of the same pre-set scenarios in the PC and Mac versions and two new ones. One is in Las Vegas under attack by aliens and another is called Freeland. Freeland has no water, and no rewards for buildings are given. Also unique to the Super NES version is a character named &quot;Dr. Wright&quot; (whose physical appearance is based on Will Wright) who acts as an adviser to the player. Dr. Wright was inspired by Miyamoto, at time known to fans as &quot;Dr. Miyamoto&quot;, and Nintendo had come to recognize the value of cartoonist mascots for games, leading to Dr. Wright&#x27;s creation. The soundtrack was composed by Soyo Oka. The edition is featured as Nintendo&#x27;s Player&#x27;s Choice as a million-seller.

In August 1996, a version of the game entitled &quot;BS SimCity Machizukuri Taikai&quot; was broadcast to Japanese players via the Super Famicom&#x27;s Satellaview subsystem. Later, a sequel titled &quot;SimCity 64&quot; was released for the 64DD, the Japan-only Nintendo 64 add-on.

According to Chaim Gingold, a former Maxis employee, he believes that the time Wright spent with Miyamoto helped to influence the direction of &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;.

===Cancelled NES version===
A version for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was announced alongside the Super NES version and had been showcased at the 1991 Consumer Electronics Show, but the NES version was never properly released. However, prototype cartridges for the NES version were discovered in 2018, and one copy was obtained by video game preservationist Frank Cifaldi, who extensively documented its features compared to the original personal computer game and the Super NES version. It featured a completely different soundtrack (also composed by Oka) from that of the Super NES version; besides &quot;Metropolis Theme&quot;, a composition that Oka herself considers one of her best works.

===&quot;Micropolis&quot;===

In January 2008, the &quot;SimCity&quot; source code was released as free software under the GPL-3.0-or-later license, renamed to &quot;Micropolis&quot; (the original working title) for trademark reasons, and developed by Don Hopkins. The release of the source code was motivated by the One Laptop Per Child program. The &quot;Micropolis&quot; source code has been translated to C++, integrated with Python and interfaced with both GTK+ and OpenLaszlo.

In 2008, Maxis established an online browser-based version of &quot;SimCity&quot;. A second browser-based version was later released under the name &quot;Micropolis&quot;. In 2013, a browser-based version was released, ported using JavaScript and HTML5, as &quot;micropolisJS&quot;.
Since &quot;Micropolis&quot; is licensed under the GPL-3.0-or-later, users can do anything they want with it that conforms with the GPL-3.0-or-laterthe only restriction is that they cannot call it &quot;SimCity&quot; (along with a few other limitations to protect EA&#x27;s trademarks). This allows other, differently named projects to be forked from the Micropolis source code. Improvements to the open-source code base that merit EA&#x27;s approval may be incorporated into the official &quot;OLPC SimCity&quot; source code, to be distributed with the OLPC under the trademarked name &quot;OLPC SimCity&quot;, but only after it has been reviewed and approved by EA.

===Comparison of different versions===
* &quot;SimCity Classic&quot; is available for Palm OS and on the SimCity.com website as &quot;Classic Live&quot;. It was also released by Atelier Software for the Psion 5 handheld computer, and mobile phones in 2006.
* The July 2005 issue of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; stated that a development cartridge of &quot;SimCity&quot; for the NES was found at Nintendo headquarters. Never released, it is reportedly the only one in existence.
* Additionally a terrain editor and architecture disks were available with tileset graphics for settings of Ancient Asia, Medieval, Wild West, Future Europe, Future USA and a Moon Colony.
* Versions of &quot;SimCity&quot; for the BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, and Acorn Archimedes computers were published by Superior Software/Acornsoft. Programmer Peter Scott had to squeeze the 512k Amiga version of the game into 25 KB to run on the aging 32 KB BBC Micro and Acorn Electron. Despite this, it kept almost all of the functionality of the Amiga game and very similar graphics (although only using four colors).
* DUX Software published a Unix version of &quot;SimCity&quot; for the NeWS window system using the HyperLook user interface environment, and a multiplayer version of &quot;SimCity&quot; for the X11 window system using the Tcl/Tk user interface toolkit, both developed and ported to various platforms by Don Hopkins.

==Reception==
&quot;SimCity&quot; was a financial success, selling one million copies by late 1992. In the United States, it was the ninth best-selling computer game from 1993 to 1999, with another 830,000 units sold. It was critically acclaimed and received significant recognition within a year after its initial release. As of December 1990, the game was reported to have won the following awards:

In addition, &quot;SimCity&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Military or Strategy Computer Game&quot; of 1989 in 1990, was named to &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Hall of Fame for games readers highly rated over time, and the multiplayer X11 version of the game was also nominated in 1992 as the Best Product of the Year in &quot;Unix World&quot;. &quot;Macworld&quot; named the Macintosh version of &quot;SimCity&quot; the Best Simulation Game of 1989, putting it into the Macintosh Game Hall of Fame. &quot;Macworld&quot;, in their review, praised its graphics as well as its strategic gameplay, calling it &quot;A challenging, dynamic game, realistic and unpredictable&quot;, and notes how &quot;as the population grows the city&#x27;s needs change.&quot; &quot;SimCity&quot; was named No. 4 &quot;Ten Greatest PC Game Ever&quot; by PC World in 2009. It was named one of the sixteen most influential games in history at Telespiel, a German technology and games trade show, in 2007. Sid Meier in 2008 named &quot;SimCity&quot; as one of the three most important innovations in videogame history, as it led to other games that encouraged players to create, not destroy. It was named No. 11 on IGN&#x27;s 2009 &quot;Top 25 PC Games of All Time&quot; list. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;SimCity&quot; the 6th-best computer game ever released. In 2018, Complex rated SimCity 50th on its &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time.&quot; In 1995, Total! listed SimCity 89th on their &quot;Top 100 SNES Games.&quot; IGN ranked the game 35th in its &quot;Top 100 SNES Games of All Time.&quot;

Mike Siggins reviewed &quot;SimCity&quot; for &quot;Games International&quot; magazine, and gave it 5 stars out of 5, and stated that &quot;Overall, &quot;SimCity&quot; must be ranked right up there in the all-time Amiga classics. It is the first title that I have come across to turn a &#x27;serious&#x27; theme into a passable simulation while also making for an excellent game.&quot; &quot;Macworld&quot; called &quot;SimCity&quot; &quot;an intricate and intriguing game&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the game a B+.

Johnny L. Wilson reviewed the game for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, and stated that &quot;Dynamic is exactly the right word for this product. There is constant strategy involved in the placement of zones, road building, political decision-making, and damage control.&quot;

In 1991, &quot;PC Format&quot; named &quot;SimCity&quot; one of the 50 best computer games ever. The editors called it &quot;a town planner&#x27;s dream&quot;.

The University of Southern California and University of Arizona used &quot;SimCity&quot; in urban planning and political science classes. Chuck Moss of &quot;The Detroit News&quot; found that Godzilla attacking the city in the 1972 Detroit scenario caused less destruction than the mayoralty of Coleman Young. In 1990 &quot;The Providence Journal&quot; invited five candidates for Mayor of Providence, Rhode Island to manage a &quot;SimCity&quot; town resembling the city. Victoria Lederberg blamed her close loss in the Democratic primary on the newspaper&#x27;s description of her poor performance in the game; former mayor Buddy Cianci, the most successful player, won the election that year.

The &quot;SimCity Terrain Editor&quot; was reviewed in 1989 in &quot;Dragon&quot; No. 147 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the expansion 4 out of 5 stars.

The ZX Spectrum version was voted number 4 in the &quot;Your Sinclair Readers&#x27; Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;.

In 2004, &quot;SimCity&quot; was inducted into GameSpot&#x27;s list of the greatest games of all time.

On March 12, 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;SimCity&quot; was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time, the so-called game canon. The Library of Congress took up a video game preservation proposal and began with the games from this list, including &quot;SimCity&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;SimCity&quot; yielded several sequels. &quot;Sim&quot; games of many types were developedwith Will Wright and Maxis developing myriad titles including &quot;SimEarth&quot;, &quot;SimFarm&quot;, &quot;SimTown&quot;, &quot;Streets of SimCity&quot;, &quot;SimCopter&quot;, &quot;SimAnt&quot;, &quot;SimLife&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;SimTower&quot;, &quot;SimPark&quot;, &quot;SimSafari&quot;, and &quot;The Sims&quot;, which spawned its own series, as well as the unreleased &quot;SimsVille&quot; and &quot;SimMars.&quot; They also obtained licenses for some titles developed in Japan, such as &quot;SimTower&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Take The A-Train&quot; (released as &quot;A-Train&quot; outside Japan). &quot;Spore&quot;, released in 2008, was originally going to be titled &quot;SimEverything&quot;a name that Will Wright thought might accurately describe what he was trying to achieve.

&quot;SimCity&quot; inspired a new genre of video games. &quot;Software toys&quot; that were open-ended with no set objective were developed trying to duplicate &quot;SimCity&quot;&#x27;s success. The most successful was Wright&#x27;s own &quot;The Sims&quot;, which went on to be the best selling computer game of all time. The ideas pioneered in &quot;SimCity&quot; have been incorporated into real-world applications as well, as urban developers have recognized that the game&#x27;s design was &quot;gamification&quot; of city planning by integrating numerous real-world systems for a city or region interacted to project growth or change. For example, VisitorVille simulates a city based on website statistics. Several real-world city improvement projects started with models inspired by &quot;SimCity&quot; prior to implementation, particularly with the onset of more connected smart cities.

The series also spawned a &quot;SimCity&quot; collectible card game, produced by Mayfair Games. Rick Swan reviewed &quot;SimCity: The Card Game&quot; for &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine No. 221 (September 1995). Swan says that &quot;While the card game doesn&#x27;t scale the heights of the computer game, it comes close.&quot;

Dr. Wright from the Super NES version has made appearances in several video games. He is a non-player character in &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, and an assist trophy in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

<doc id="28761" wikidata="Q236038" url="?curid=28761" title="Sofonisba Anguissola">
<text>Sofonisba Anguissola ( – 16 November 1625), also known as Sophonisba Angussola or Sophonisba Anguisciola, was an Italian Renaissance painter born in Cremona to a relatively poor noble family. She received a well-rounded education that included the fine arts, and her apprenticeship with local painters set a precedent for women to be accepted as students of art. As a young woman, Anguissola traveled to Rome where she was introduced to Michelangelo, who immediately recognized her talent, and to Milan, where she painted the Duke of Alba. The Spanish queen, Elizabeth of Valois, was a keen amateur painter and in 1559 Anguissola was recruited to go to Madrid as her tutor, with the rank of lady-in-waiting. She later became an official court painter to the king, Philip II, and adapted her style to the more formal requirements of official portraits for the Spanish court. After the queen&#x27;s death, Philip helped arrange an aristocratic marriage for her. She moved to Sicily, and later Pisa and Genoa, where she continued to practice as a leading portrait painter.

Her most distinctive and attractive paintings are her portraits of herself and her family, which she painted before she moved to the Spanish court. In particular, her depictions of children were fresh and closely observed. At the Spanish court she painted formal state portraits in the prevailing official style, as one of the first, and most successful, of the relatively few female court painters. Later in her life she also painted religious subjects, although many of her religious paintings have been lost. In 1625, she died at age 93 in Palermo.

Anguissola&#x27;s example, as much as her oeuvre, had a lasting influence on subsequent generations of artists, and her great success opened the way for larger numbers of women to pursue serious careers as artists. Her paintings can be seen at galleries in Boston (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum), Milwaukee (Milwaukee Art Museum), Bergamo, Brescia, Budapest, Madrid (Museo del Prado), Naples, and Siena, and at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.

Her contemporary Giorgio Vasari wrote that Anguissola &quot;has shown greater application and better grace than any other woman of our age in her endeavors at drawing; she has thus succeeded not only in drawing, coloring and painting from nature, and copying excellently from others, but by herself has created rare and very beautiful paintings.&quot;

==Family==
The origin and the name of the noble Anguissola family are linked to an ancient Byzantine tradition, rich in historical details.

According to this tradition, the Anguissolas are descended from the Constantinopolitan warlord Galvano Sordo or Galvano de Soardi/Sourdi (Σούρδη, a family name still in use today in Greece, Constantinople and Smyrna). In 717, Galvano served in the army of the Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian, and &quot;with an ingenious artificial fire, contributed to liberate the city of Constantinople from the Saracens who had kept it besieged by land and sea&quot;. This &quot;artificial fire&quot; was the so-called Greek fire, an incendiary weapon developed in the late 7th century, which was responsible for many key Byzantine military victories, most notably the salvation of Constantinople from two Arab sieges, thus securing the Empire&#x27;s survival.

Since the shield of the Sourdi carried the effigy of an asp (in Latin: &quot;anguis&quot;), after Galvano&#x27;s victory over the Umayyads, his brothers-in-arms and the people of Constantinople exclaimed: &quot;&quot;Anguis sola fecit victoriam&quot;!&quot;, i.e.: &quot;The snake alone brought the victory!&quot; This saying became very popular, and Galvano himself was nicknamed &quot;Anguissola&quot;. The emperor eventually bestowed the Anguissola surname to all his descendants. In this regard, it has been suggested that the monogram depicted on Anguissola&#x27;s miniature self-portrait may contain the family motto &quot;Anguis sola fecit victoriam&quot; or, more simply, the name of Anguissola&#x27;s father, Amilcare.

Fleeing from a pestilence that raged in Constantinople, the descendants of the first Anguissola settled in Italy, intermarried with other noble families such as the Komnenoi, the Gonzagas, the Caracciolos, the Scottis and the Viscontis, and built autonomous estates in Piacenza, Cremona, Vicenza and other regions of Italy. The Anguissolas who settled in the Republic of Venice belonged to the patriciate of its capital, Venice from 1499 to 1612.

==Childhood and training==

Sofonisba Anguissola was born into a poor but ancient Italian noble family in Cremona, Lombardy in 1532, the oldest of seven children, six of whom were girls. Her father, Amilcare Anguissola, was a member of the Cremonese nobility, and her mother, Bianca Ponzone, was also of noble background. The family lived near the site of a famous 2nd century B.C. battle, the battle of the Trebbia, between Romans and Carthaginians, and several members of the Anguissola family were named after ancient Carthaginian historical characters: Amilcare was named for the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca; he named his first daughter after the tragic Carthaginian figure Sophonisba and his only son Asdrubale after the warlord Hasdrubal Barca. Amilcare Anguissola, inspired by Baldassare Castiglione&#x27;s book Il Cortigiano, encouraged all his daughters (Sofonisba, Elena, Lucia, Europa, Minerva and Anna Maria) to cultivate and perfect their talents. Four of the sisters (Elena, Lucia, Europa and Anna Maria) became painters, but Sofonisba was by far the most accomplished and renowned and taught her younger siblings. Elena Anguissola ( – 1584) abandoned painting to become a nun. Both Anna Maria and Europa gave up art upon marrying, while Lucia Anguissola (1536 or 1538 – 1565–1568), the best painter of Sophonisba&#x27;s sisters, died young. The remaining sister, Minerva, became a writer and Latin scholar. Asdrubale, Sophonisba&#x27;s brother, studied music and Latin, but not painting.

Her aristocratic father made sure that Anguissola and her sisters received a well-rounded education that included the fine arts. Anguissola was fourteen when her father sent her and her sister Elena to study with Bernardino Campi, a respected portrait and religious painter of the Lombard school. When Campi moved to another city, Anguissola continued her studies with painter Bernardino Gatti (known as Il Sojaro), a pupil of Correggio&#x27;s. Anguissola&#x27;s apprenticeship with local painters set a precedent for women to be accepted as students of art. Dates are uncertain, but Anguissola probably continued her studies under Gatti for about three years (1551–1553).

One of Anguissola&#x27;s most important early works was &quot;Bernardino Campi Painting Sofonisba Anguissola&quot; (c. 1550). The unusual double portrait depicts Anguissola&#x27;s art teacher in the act of painting a portrait of her.

In 1554, at age twenty-two, Anguissola traveled to Rome, where she spent her time sketching various scenes and people. While in Rome, she was introduced to Michelangelo by another painter who was familiar with her work. Anguissola initially showed Michelangelo a drawing of a laughing girl, but the painter challenged her to draw a weeping boy, a subject which he felt would be more challenging. Anguissola drew &quot;Boy Bitten by a Crayfish&quot; and sent it back to Michelangelo, who immediately recognized her talent. Michelangelo subsequently gave Anguissola sketches from his notebooks to draw in her own style and offered advice on the results. For at least two years, Anguissola continued this informal study, receiving substantial guidance from Michelangelo.

==Experiences as a female artist==
Anguissola&#x27;s education and training had different implications from those of men, since men and women worked in separate spheres. Her training was not to help her into a profession where she would compete for commissions with male artists, but to make her a better wife, companion, and mother. Although Anguissola enjoyed significantly more encouragement and support than the average woman of her day, her social class did not allow her to transcend the constraints of her sex. Without the possibility of studying anatomy or drawing from life (it was considered unacceptable for a lady to view nudes), she could not undertake the complex multi-figure compositions required for large-scale religious or history paintings.

Instead, she experimented with new styles of portraiture, setting subjects informally. Self-portraits and family members were her most frequent subjects, as seen in such paintings as &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; (1554, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), &quot;Portrait of Amilcare, Minerva and Asdrubale Anguissola&quot; (c. 1557–1558, Nivaagaards Malerisambling, Nivå, Denmark), and her most famous picture, &quot;The Chess Game&quot; (1555, Muzeum Narodowe, Poznań), which depicted her sisters Lucia, Minerva and Europa. Painted when Anguissola was 23 years old, &quot;The Chess Game&quot; is an intimate representation of an everyday family scene, combining elaborate formal clothing with very informal facial expressions, which was unusual for Italian art at this time. &quot;The Chess Game&quot; explored a new kind of genre painting which places her sisters in a domestic setting instead of the formal or allegorical settings that were popular at the time. This painting has been regarded as a conversation piece, which is an informal portrait of a group engaging in lively conversation or some activity .

Anguissola&#x27;s self-portraits also offer evidence of what she thought her place was as a woman artist. Normally, men were seen as creative actors and women as passive objects, but in her self-portrait of 1556, Anguissola presents herself as the artist, separating herself from the role as the object to be painted. Additional pieces show how she rebels against the notion that women are objects, in essence an instrument to be played by men. Her self-portrait of 1561 show her playing an instrument, taking on a different role. In her later portraits she represents multiple statuses by using a double portrait image portraying herself as an artist or a wife. 

She became well known outside of Italy, and in 1559 King Philip II of Spain asked her to be lady-in-waiting and art teacher to Queen Elisabeth of Valois, who was only 14 at the time. Queen Elisabeth of Valois and Anguissola became good friends, and when the Queen died nine years later, Anguissola left the court because she was so sad. She had painted the entire royal family and even the Pope commissioned Anguissola to do a portrait of the Queen.

==At the Spanish Court==

In 1558, already established as a painter, Anguissola went to Milan, where she painted the Duke of Alba, Fernando Álvarez de Toledo. He in turn recommended her to the Spanish king, Philip II. The following year, Anguissola was invited to join the Spanish Court, which was a turning point in her career.

Anguissola was approximately 26 when she left Italy to join the Spanish court. In the winter of 1559–1560, she arrived in Madrid to serve as a court painter and lady-in-waiting to the new queen, Elisabeth of Valois, Philip&#x27;s third wife, who was herself an amateur portraitist. Anguissola soon gained Elisabeth&#x27;s admiration and confidence and spent the following years painting many official portraits for the court, including Philip II&#x27;s sister, Joanna, and his son, Don Carlos.

These types of painting were far more demanding than the informal portraits upon which Anguissola had based her early reputation, as it took a tremendous amount of time and energy to render the many intricate designs of the fine fabrics and elaborate jewelry associated with royal subjects. Yet despite the challenge, Anguissola&#x27;s paintings of Elisabeth of Valois – and later of Anne of Austria, Philip II&#x27;s fourth wife – were vibrant and full of life.
During her 14-year residence, she guided the artistic development of Queen Elisabeth, and influenced the art made by her two daughters, Isabella Clara Eugenia and Catherine Michaela. Anguissola painted a portrait of the King&#x27;s sister, Margaret of Parma, for Pope Pius IV in 1561 and, after Queen Elisabeth&#x27;s death in childbirth in 1568, painted the likeness of Anne of Austria, Philip&#x27;s fourth wife. While she continued painting portraits at the court, the Althorp &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; is the &quot;only securely attributed work surviving from this period&quot;. For the royal family, Anguissola produced detailed scenes of their lives that now hang in the Prado Museum. With the gifts and a dowry of 12,000 scudi she earned along with her salary as court painter and lady-in-waiting to the queen, she amassed an admirable return from her craft.

While in the service of Elisabeth of Valois, Anguissola worked closely with Alonso Sanchez Coello. So closely in fact, that the famous painting of the middle-aged King Philip II was long attributed to Coello or Juan Pantoja de la Cruz. Only recently has Anguissola been recognized as the painting&#x27;s creator.

==Personal life==

After the death of Elisabeth of Valois in 1568, Philip II took a special interest in Anguissola&#x27;s future. He had wished to marry her to one of the nobles in the Spanish Court. In 1571, when she was approaching the age of 40, Anguissola entered an arranged marriage to a Sicilian nobleman chosen for her by the Spanish court. Philip II paid a dowry of 12,000 scudi for her marriage to Fabrizio Moncada Pignatelli, son of the Prince of Paternò, Viceroy of Sicily. Fabrizio was said to be supportive of her painting. Anguissola and her husband left Spain with the king&#x27;s permission, and are believed to have lived in Paternò (near Catania) from 1573 to 1579, though some recent scholarship has suggested that the couple remained in Spain. She received a royal pension of 100 ducats that enabled her to continue working and tutoring would-be painters. Her private fortune also supported her family and brother Asdrubale following Amilcare Anguissola&#x27;s financial decline and death. In Paternò she painted and donated &quot;La Madonna dell&#x27;Itria&quot;.

Anguissola&#x27;s husband died in 1579 under mysterious circumstances. Two years later, while traveling to Cremona by sea, she fell in love with the ship&#x27;s captain, sea merchant Orazio Lomellino. Against the wishes of her brother, they married in Pisa on 24 December 1584 and lived in Genoa until 1620. She had no children, but maintained cordial relationships with her nieces and her stepson, Giulio.

==Later years==
Lomellino&#x27;s fortune, plus a generous pension from Philip II, allowed Anguissola to paint freely and live comfortably. By now quite famous, Anguissola received many colleagues who came to visit and discuss the arts with her. Several of these were younger artists, eager to learn and mimic Anguissola&#x27;s distinctive style.

In her later life, Anguissola painted not only portraits but religious themes, as she had done in the days of her youth, although many of the latter have been lost. She was the leading portrait painter in Genoa until she moved to Palermo in her last years. In 1620 she painted her last self-portrait.

On 12 July 1624, Anguissola was visited by the young Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck, who recorded sketches from his visit to her in his sketchbook. Van Dyck, who believed her to be 96 years of age (she was actually about 92) noted that although &quot;her eyesight was weakened&quot;, Anguissola was still mentally alert. Excerpts of the advice she gave him about painting survive from this visit, and he was said to have claimed that their conversation taught him more about the &quot;true principles&quot; of painting than anything else in his life. Van Dyck drew her portrait while visiting her. This last portrait made of Anguissola survives on public display at Knole. The next year, she returned to Sicily.

Anguissola became a wealthy patron of the arts after the weakening of her sight. In 1625, she died at age 93 in Palermo.

Anguissola&#x27;s adoring second husband, who described her as small of frame, yet &quot;great among mortals&quot;, buried her with honor in Palermo at the Church of San Giorgio dei Genovesi. Seven years later, on the anniversary of what would have been her 100th birthday, her husband placed an inscription on her tomb that read in part:


==Style==

The influence of Campi, whose reputation was based on portraiture, is evident in Anguissola&#x27;s early works, such as the &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; (Florence, Uffizi). Her work was akin to the worldly tradition of Cremona, influenced greatly by the art of Parma and Mantua, in which even religious works were imbued with extreme delicacy and charm. From Gatti she seems to have absorbed elements reminiscent of Correggio, beginning a trend in Cremonese painting of the late 16th century. This new direction is reflected in &quot;Lucia, Minerva and Europa Anguissola Playing Chess&quot; (1555; Poznań, N. Mus.) in which portraiture merges into a quasi-genre scene, a characteristic derived from Brescian models.

The main body of Anguissola&#x27;s earlier work consists of self-portraits (the many &quot;autoritratti&quot; reflect the fact that portraits of her were frequently requested due to her fame) and portraits of her family, which are considered by many to be her finest works.

Approximately fifty works have been attributed to Anguissola. Her paintings can be seen at galleries in Baltimore (Walters Art Museum), Bergamo, Berlin (Gemäldegalerie), Graz (Joanneum Alte Galerie), Madrid (Museo del Prado), Milan (Pinacoteca di Brera), Milwaukee (Milwaukee Art Museum), Naples (National Museum of Capodimonte), Poznań (National Museum, Poznań), Siena (Pinacoteca Nazionale), Southampton (City Art Gallery), and Vienna (Kunsthistorisches Museum).

==Works==
==Historical significance==
Sofonisba Anguissola&#x27;s oeuvre had a lasting influence on subsequent generations of artists. Her portrait of Queen Elisabeth of Valois with a zibellino (the pelt of a marten set with a head and feet of jewelled gold) was widely copied by many of the finest artists of the time, such as Peter Paul Rubens, while Caravaggio allegedly took inspiration from Anguissola&#x27;s work for his &quot;Boy Bitten by a Lizard&quot;.

Anguissola is significant to feminist art historians. Although there has never been a period in Western history in which women were completely absent in the visual arts, Anguissola&#x27;s great success opened the way for larger numbers of women to pursue serious careers as artists; Lavinia Fontana expressed in a letter written in 1579 that she and another woman, Irene di Spilimbergo, had &quot;set [their] heart[s] on learning how to paint&quot; after seeing one of Anguissola&#x27;s portraits. Some of her more well-known successors include Lavinia Fontana, Barbara Longhi, Fede Galizia and Artemisia Gentileschi.

A Cremonese school bears the name Liceo Statale Sofonisba Anguissola.

American artist Charles Willson Peale (1741–1827) named his daughter Sophonisba Angusciola (1786–1859; married name Sellers). She became a painter and a quilter whose works are in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

==Crater==
On 4 August 2017 a crater on Mercury was named after her.

<text>is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally released under the name CHAIN SHOT in 1985 by Kuniaki &quot;Morisuke&quot; Moribe. It has since been ported to numerous computer platforms, handheld devices, and even TiVo, with new versions as of 2016.

==History==
&quot;SameGame&quot; was originally created as &quot;Chain Shot!&quot; in 1985 by Kuniaki Moribe. It was distributed for Fujitsu&#x27;s FM-8 and FM-7 platforms in a Japanese monthly personal computer magazine called &quot;Gekkan ASCII&quot;. In 1992, the game was ported as &quot;SameGame&quot; to Unix platforms by Eiji Fukumoto, to the NEC PC-9801 series by Wataru Yoshioka, and to Macintosh as &quot;ChainShot!&quot; by Eiichiro Mawatari. In 1993, it was ported to Windows 3.1 by Ikuo Hirohata. This version was translated into English by Hitoshi Ozawa, and is still available from his software archive.
In 1994, Takahiro Sumiya ported it to Macintosh. This version has some gameplay differences—a choice of between two and five colors—and is probably the most widely distributed of the original series. It was the basis for the &quot;Same Gnome&quot; and &quot;KSame&quot; variations created for Linux.

In 2001, Biedl et al. proved that deciding the solvability (whether all blocks can be removed) of 1-column (or 1-row) 2-colour Clickomania can be done in linear time. Deciding the solvability of 2-column, 5-colour Clickomania is NP-Complete. Deciding the solvability of 5-column 3-colour Clickomania is also NP-Complete. Follow-up work in 2015 by Adler et al. proved that deciding the solvability of Clickomania is hard even in the 2-column 2-colour case, as well as Parameterized complexity results on determining whether an instance of size &quot;n&quot; is solvable in &quot;k&quot; or fewer clicks.

==Gameplay==

===Game mechanics===

&quot;SameGame&quot; is played on a rectangular field, typically initially filled with four or five kinds of blocks placed at random. By selecting a group of adjoining blocks of the same color, a player may remove them from the screen. Blocks that are no longer supported will fall down, and a column without any blocks will be trimmed away by other columns always sliding to one side (often the left). The goal of the game is to remove as many blocks from the playing field as possible.

In most versions, there are no time constraints during the game. However, some implementations gradually push the rows upward or drop blocks from above. Sometimes the player can control the number and timing of blocks that drop from above in certain ways. For example, on some implementations for the iOS, this can be done by shaking the device. The game ends if a timer runs out or if no more blocks can be removed. Some versions, including some versions for Windows Mobile, include both portrait and landscape orientations.

==== Variations ====
In one variation, the game starts with no blocks on the field. Blocks fall down to the playing field, and must be removed before they reach the top. If they reach the top and overflow, the game is over. In some variations, such as &quot;Bubble Bang&quot;, circles or balls are used instead of blocks—which alters the gameplay, as the balls form different shapes than square blocks.

In three-dimensional variants, the playing field is a cube (containing smaller cubes) instead of a rectangle, and the player has the ability to rotate the cube. &quot;Cubes&quot; for iPhone OS uses this approach.

Some versions allow the player to rotate the playing field 90 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise, which causes one of two things to happen:
# The left and right sides become the bottom and the top, and the blocks fall to the new bottom. The orientation switches between portrait and landscape. &quot;NeoSameGame&quot; for iPhone OS uses this approach.
# The blocks fall to the left or right side, but the player must rotate the field back to portrait orientation (which is fixed). &quot;Bubblets Tilt&quot; for iPhone OS uses this approach.

In some variations, blocks can be removed when connected to blocks of the same color diagonally, not just horizontally and vertically. Some versions introduce new types of blocks. The different types of blocks interact in various ways with the play field; for example, one type might remove all the blocks in a row. An example of this is the &quot;Revenge mode&quot; in &quot;PocketPop Revenge&quot; (&quot;PocketFun&quot;) for iPhone OS.

==== Rules variations ====
# The game ends when the playing field is cleared, or if the remaining blocks cannot be removed. At the end of play, the player receives a score.
# When the playing field is cleared, instead of ending the game, a new level appears—usually harder, with more block types or lower time limits, or both. The condition for winning may vary between levels. Instead of clearing the whole level, for example, a certain score or a certain number of removed blocks must be reached. When the needed score is reached, in most versions the player is allowed to clear the rest of the level. If the player cannot reach the needed score—or if the timer runs out—the game ends, and the player receives a final score.
# In an &quot;endless&quot; variant, the game starts with an empty field. The blocks or balls start falling down; but if they reach the top, new blocks stop falling, so they do not overflow—thus, the game never ends. The player can end the game at any time by waiting for blocks to reach the top, then performing a special action (for example, right-click instead of left-click).
# Some versions have player lives. If a player reaches a losing condition one time, the game does not end; instead, a life is lost. If all lives are lost, the game ends.
# In the &quot;continuous&quot; variant, whenever a vertical set of blocks has been cleared and the remaining blocks have shifted to one side, a new, randomly selected column of blocks will pop up on the other side, thereby allowing a game to be played for an extended amount of time.
# In the &quot;shift&quot; variant, when a set of blocks has been cleared, all remaining blocks to the top and left will shift down and to the right.
# The &quot;megashift&quot; variant is a combination of the rules of the &quot;continuous&quot; and &quot;shift&quot; variations.

=== Scoring ===
Most versions of the game give formula_1 points for removing formula_2 tiles at once, where formula_3 or formula_4, depending on the implementation. For instance, &quot;Insane Game&quot; for Texas Instruments calculators uses formula_5; Ikuo Hirohata&#x27;s implementation uses the formula formula_6. The &quot;Bubble Breaker&quot; implementation for Windows Mobile uses the formula_7 formula. The 2001 version released by Jeff Reno uses the formula formula_8.

Some versions also offer a large bonus for removing all blocks from the screen, or leaving no more than a certain number of blocks. Others reduce the final score based on the number of blocks remaining at the end of the game. Some game versions award bonus points for clearing the field quickly, encouraging faster play. The faster the player finishes the level, the bigger the bonus. Still others offer combination, or &quot;chain&quot;, bonuses for clearing the same color of blocks two or more times in succession.

Another scoring technique awards bonus points for each chain of a certain color that has a certain number of blocks (for example, two red blocks or 11 blue blocks). After receiving the bonus once, sometimes the bonus condition changes. &quot;BPop&quot; uses this scoring variation.

Some versions have a simple scoring system: each block removed is worth one point, and there is no bonus for removing more than two blocks at a time. This is seen in the &quot;Same Pets&quot; and &quot;Same Hearths&quot; variants.

====Goal-based scoring====
Some versions award scores based on the attainment of goals. This is typically seen in multi-level versions of the game. There are four primary scoring systems for such games.

In one variation, each level has a target score. The player&#x27;s score starts at zero, and the player must reach the target score. At the beginning of each level, the player&#x27;s score is reset to zero; the target score increases with each level.

Other versions have a cumulative target score. In these versions, the player&#x27;s score carries over from level to level. As a result, if the player substantially exceeds the target score on a given level, they may enter the subsequent level having already met that level&#x27;s target score, as well. &quot;BPop&quot; has a cumulative target score.

Some versions maintain the same target score for each level; such variations can be played indefinitely. In such games, the player typically loses due to poor planning or a lapse in concentration. Examples of such games are &quot;Same Pets&quot; and &quot;Same Hearths&quot;.

In games without a goal score, like &quot;Bonkers for iPhone&quot; and SameGameBros for iPhone, the goal is to clear the level completely. The game ends when the player fails to do so.

== Visuals ==

Blocks typically appear as colored squares, circles, or spheres. Some variations use gradient shading to give the illusion of dimensionality. Other tile themes, or &quot;skins&quot;, include animals, hearts, stars, faces, Lego blocks, and jelly bears. Designs may follow a theme, such as Christmas or monochrome. Most games have only one skin, but others allow choosing from multiple skins.

There is a special visual aspect in some versions; instead of separate blocks, games like &quot;iDrops&quot; and &quot;SameGameManiak&quot; feature bordered areas for adjacent blocks of the same color. Some have elaborate tile graphics, featuring pictures or patterns inside the tile, like &quot;KSame&quot; and &quot;Same GNOME&quot;.

===Variations===
;Reveal the picture
: The SameGame concept can be extended to a &quot;Reveal the picture&quot; game. A picture or photo is behind the blocks; it becomes increasingly visible as blocks are removed, until it is completely revealed. Examples include &quot;Same Pets&quot;, &quot;Same Hearts&quot; and the Nissan Cube promotional app for iPhone.
;Animation
: Some games feature animation of one or more game events, such as cleared tiles bursting or exploding, or scoring animations (&quot;BPop&quot;, &quot;Bubblets Tilt&quot;).
; Block highlighting
: Some versions display which blocks are selected with a border around them (&quot;BPop&quot;), jittering of the blocks (&quot;BPop&quot;), or an increase of the size of the selected blocks (&quot;Bubblets Tilt&quot;). If the blocks are deselected (usually by dragging away from them, or tapping another block chain or a single block), the highlight is removed.

<text>Sather is an object-oriented programming language. It originated circa 1990 at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) at the University of California, Berkeley, developed by an international team led by Steve Omohundro. It supports garbage collection and generics by subtypes.

Originally, it was based on Eiffel, but it has diverged, and now includes several functional programming features.

The name is inspired by Eiffel; the Sather Tower is a recognizable landmark at Berkeley, named after Jane Krom Sather, the widow of Peder Sather, who donated large sums to the foundation of the university.

Sather also takes inspiration from other programming languages and paradigms: iterators, design by contract, abstract classes, multiple inheritance, anonymous functions, operator overloading, contravariant type system.

The original Berkeley implementation (last stable version 1.1 was released in 1995, no longer maintained) has been adopted by the Free Software Foundation therefore becoming GNU Sather. Last stable GNU version (1.2.3) was released in July 2007 and the software is currently not maintained. There were several other variants: Sather-K from the University of Karlsruhe; Sather-W from the University of Waikato (implementation of Sather version 1.3); Peter Naulls&#x27; port of ICSI Sather 1.1 to RISC OS; and pSather, a parallel version of ICSI Sather addressing non-uniform memory access multiprocessor architectures but presenting a shared memory model to the programmer.

The former ICSI Sather compiler (now GNU Sather) is implemented as a compiler to C, i.e., the compiler does not output object or machine code, but takes Sather source code and generates C source code as an intermediate language. Optimizing is left to the C compiler.

The GNU Sather compiler, written in Sather itself, is dual licensed under the GNU GPL &amp; LGPL.

== Hello World ==

 class HELLO_WORLD is
 main is 
 #OUT+&quot;Hello World\n&quot;; 
 end; 
 end;

A few remarks:
* Class names are ALL CAPS; this is not only a convention but it&#x27;s enforced by the compiler.
* The method called codice_1 is the entry point for execution. It may belong to any class, but if this is different from codice_2, it must be specified as a compiler option.
* codice_3 is the constructor symbol: It calls the codice_4 method of the class whose name follows the operator. In this example, it&#x27;s used for instantiating the codice_5 class, which is the class for the standard output.
* The codice_6 operator has been overloaded by the class to append the string passed as argument to the stream.
* Operators such as codice_6 are syntactic sugar for conventionally named method calls: codice_8 stands for codice_9. The usual arithmetic precedence conventions are used to resolve the calling order of methods in complex formulae.

== Example of iterators ==

This program prints numbers from 1 to 10.
 class MAIN is
 main is
 loop
 i := 1.upto!(10);
 #OUT + i + &quot;\n&quot;;
 end;
 end;
 end;
The codice_10 ... codice_11 construct is the preferred means of defining loops, although codice_12 and codice_13-codice_14 are also available. Within the construct, one or more iterators may be used. Iterator names always end with an exclamation mark. (This convention is enforced by the compiler.) codice_15 is a method of the codice_16 class accepting one codice_17 argument, meaning its value won&#x27;t change as the iterator yields. codice_15 could be implemented in the codice_16 class with code similar to the following one.
 upto!(once m:INT):SAME is
 i: INT := self; -- initialise i to the value of self, 
 -- that is the integer of which this method is called
 loop
 if i&gt;m then 
 quit; -- leave the loop when i goes beyond m
 end;
 yield i; -- else use i as return value and stay in the loop
 i := i + 1; -- and increment
 end;
 end;
Type information for variables is denoted by the postfix syntax codice_20. The type can often be inferred and thus the typing information is optional, as in codice_21. codice_22 is a pseudo-class referring to the current class.

<doc id="28764" wikidata="Q167934" url="?curid=28764" title="Serotonin">
<text>Serotonin () or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter. Its biological function is complex, touching on diverse functions including mood, cognition, reward, learning, memory, and numerous physiological processes such as vomiting and vasoconstriction.

Serotonin is produced in the central nervous system (CNS), specifically in the brainstem&#x27;s raphe nuclei, the skin&#x27;s Merkel cells, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and the tongue&#x27;s taste receptor cells. Approximately 90% of the serotonin the human body produces is in the gastrointestinal tract&#x27;s enterochromaffin cells, where it regulates intestinal movements. Additionally, it is stored in blood platelets and is released during agitation and vasoconstriction, where it then acts as an agonist to other platelets. About 8% is found in platelets and 1–2% in the CNS.

The serotonin is secreted luminally and basolaterally, which leads to increased serotonin uptake by circulating platelets and activation after stimulation, which gives increased stimulation of myenteric neurons and gastrointestinal motility. The remainder is synthesized in serotonergic neurons of the CNS, where it has various functions, including the regulation of mood, appetite, and sleep.

Serotonin secreted from the enterochromaffin cells eventually finds its way out of tissues into the blood. There, it is actively taken up by blood platelets, which store it. When the platelets bind to a clot, they release serotonin, which can serve as a vasoconstrictor or a vasodilator while regulating hemostasis and blood clotting. In high concentrations, serotonin acts as a vasoconstrictor by contracting endothelial smooth muscle directly or by potentiating the effects of other vasoconstrictors (e.g. angiotensin II and norepinephrine). The vasoconstrictive property is mostly seen in pathologic states affecting the endotheliumsuch as atherosclerosis or chronic hypertension. In normal physiologic states, vasodilation occurs through the serotonin-mediated release of nitric oxide (NO) from endothelial cells and the inhibition of the release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerves. Serotonin is also a growth factor for some types of cells, which may give it a role in wound healing. There are various serotonin receptors.

Biochemically, the indoleamine molecule derives from the amino acid tryptophan. Serotonin is metabolized mainly to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), chiefly by the liver.

Several classes of antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), interfere with the normal reabsorption of serotonin after it is done with the transmission of the signal, therefore augmenting the neurotransmitter levels in the synapses.

Besides mammals, serotonin is found in all bilateral animals including worms and insects, as well as in fungi and in plants. Serotonin&#x27;s presence in insect venoms and plant spines serves to cause pain, which is a side-effect of serotonin injection. Serotonin is produced by pathogenic amoebae, causing diarrhea in the human gut. Its widespread presence in many seeds and fruits may serve to stimulate the digestive tract into expelling the seeds.

==Molecular structure==
Biochemically, the indoleamine molecule derives from the amino acid tryptophan, via the (rate-limiting) hydroxylation of the 5 position on the ring (forming the intermediate 5-hydroxytryptophan), and then decarboxylation to produce serotonin. Preferable conformations are defined via ethylamine chain, resulting in six different conformations.

==Crystal structure==
Serotonin crystallizes in P212121 chiral space group forming different hydrogen-bonding interactions between serotonin molecules via N-H...O and O-H...N intermolecular bonds. Serotonin also forms several salts, including pharmaceutical formulation of serotonin adipate.

==Biological role==
Serotonin is involved in numerous physiological processes, including sleep, thermoregulation, learning and memory, pain, (social) behavior, sexual activity, feeding, motor activity, neural development, and biological rhythms. In less complex animals, such as some invertebrates, serotonin regulates feeding and other processes. In plants serotonin synthesis seems to be associated with stress signals. Despite its longstanding prominence in pharmaceutical advertising, the claim that low serotonin levels cause depression is not supported by scientific evidence.

===Cellular effects===
Serotonin primarily acts through its receptors and its effects depend on which cells and tissues express these receptors.

Metabolism involves first oxidation by monoamine oxidase to 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde (5-HIAL). The rate-limiting step is hydride transfer from serotonin to the flavin cofactor. There follows oxidation by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (), the indole acetic-acid derivative. The latter is then excreted by the kidneys.

====Receptors====
The serotonin receptors are located on the cell membrane of nerve cells and other cell types in animals, and mediate the effects of serotonin as the endogenous ligand and of a broad range of pharmaceutical and psychedelic drugs. There are currently 14known serotonin receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT1 (1A, 1B, 1D, 1E, 1F), 5-HT2 (2A, 2B, 2C), 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5 (5A, 5B), 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors. Except for the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel, all other 5-HT receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (also called seven-transmembrane, or heptahelical receptors) that activate an intracellular second messenger cascade. The 5-HT5B receptor is present in rodents but not in humans.

In addition to the serotonin receptors, serotonin is an agonist of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) in some species. It is a weak TAAR1 partial agonist in rats, but is inactive at the TAAR1 in mice and humans.

====Termination====
Serotonergic action is terminated primarily via uptake of 5-HT from the synapse. This is accomplished through the specific monoamine transporter for 5-HT, SERT, on the presynaptic neuron. Various agents can inhibit 5-HT reuptake, including cocaine, dextromethorphan (an antitussive), tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A 2006 study found that a significant portion of 5-HT&#x27;s synaptic clearance is due to the selective activity of the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT) which actively transports the molecule across the membrane and back into the presynaptic cell.

In contrast to the high affinity of SERT, the PMAT has been identified as a low-affinity transporter, with an apparent &quot;K&quot;m of 114 micromoles/l for serotonin, which is approximately 230 times higher than that of SERT. However, the PMAT, despite its relatively low serotonergic affinity, has a considerably higher transport &quot;capacity&quot; than SERT, &quot;resulting in roughly comparable uptake efficiencies to SERT ... in heterologous expression systems.&quot; The study also suggests that the administration of SSRIs such as fluoxetine and sertraline may be associated with an inhibitory effect on PMAT activity when used at higher than normal dosages (IC50 test values used in trials were 3–4 fold higher than typical prescriptive dosage).

====Serotonylation====
Serotonin can also signal through a nonreceptor mechanism called serotonylation, in which serotonin modifies proteins. This process underlies serotonin&#x27;s effects upon platelet-forming cells (thrombocytes) in which it links to the modification of signaling enzymes called GTPases that then trigger the release of vesicle contents by exocytosis. A similar process underlies the pancreatic release of insulin.

The effects of serotonin upon vascular smooth muscle tonethe biological function after which serotonin was originally nameddepend upon the serotonylation of proteins involved in the contractile apparatus of muscle cells.

===Nervous system===
The neurons of the raphe nuclei are the principal source of 5-HT release in the brain. There are nine raphe nuclei, designated B1–B9, which contain the majority of serotonin-containing neurons (some scientists chose to group the &quot;nuclei raphes lineares&quot; into one nucleus), all of which are located along the midline of the brainstem, and centered on the reticular formation. Axons from the neurons of the raphe nuclei form a neurotransmitter system reaching almost every part of the central nervous system. Axons of neurons in the lower raphe nuclei terminate in the cerebellum and spinal cord, while the axons of the higher nuclei spread out in the entire brain.

====Ultrastructure and function====
The serotonin nuclei may also be divided into two main groups, the rostral and caudal containing three and four nuclei respectively. The rostral group consists of the caudal linear nuclei (B8), the dorsal raphe nuclei (B6 and B7) and the median raphe nuclei (B5, B8 and B9), that project into multiple cortical and subcortical structures. The caudal group consists of the nucleus raphe magnus (B3), raphe obscurus nucleus (B2), raphe pallidus nucleus (B1), and lateral medullary reticular formation, that project into the brainstem.

The serotonergic pathway is involved in sensorimotor function, with pathways projecting both into cortical (Dorsal and Median Raphe Nuclei), subcortical, and spinal areas involved in motor activity. Pharmacological manipulation suggests that serotonergic activity increases with motor activity while firing rates of serotonergic neurons increase with intense visual stimuli. Animal models suggest that kainate signaling negatively regulates serotonin actions in the retina, with possible implications for the control of the visual system. The descending projections form a pathway that inhibits pain called the &quot;descending inhibitory pathway&quot; that may be relevant to a disorder such as fibromyalgia, migraine, and other pain disorders, and the efficacy of antidepressants in them.

Serotonergic projections from the caudal nuclei are involved in regulating mood and emotion, and hypo- or hyper-serotonergic states may be involved in depression and sickness behavior.

====Microanatomy====
Serotonin is released into the synapse, or space between neurons, and diffuses over a relatively wide gap (&gt;20 nm) to activate 5-HT receptors located on the dendrites, cell bodies, and presynaptic terminals of adjacent neurons.

When humans smell food, dopamine is released to increase the appetite. But, unlike in worms, serotonin does not increase anticipatory behaviour in humans; instead, the serotonin released while consuming activates 5-HT2C receptors on dopamine-producing cells. This halts their dopamine release, and thereby serotonin decreases appetite. Drugs that block 5-HT2C receptors make the body unable to recognize when it is no longer hungry or otherwise in need of nutrients, and are associated with weight gain, especially in people with a low number of receptors. The expression of 5-HT2C receptors in the hippocampus follows a diurnal rhythm, just as the serotonin release in the ventromedial nucleus, which is characterised by a peak at morning when the motivation to eat is strongest.

In macaques, alpha males have twice the level of serotonin in the brain as subordinate males and females (measured by the concentration of 5-HIAA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)). Dominance status and CSF serotonin levels appear to be positively correlated. When dominant males were removed from such groups, subordinate males begin competing for dominance. Once new dominance hierarchies were established, serotonin levels of the new dominant individuals also increased to double those in subordinate males and females. The reason why serotonin levels are only high in dominant males, but not dominant females has not yet been established.

In humans, levels of 5-HT1A receptor inhibition in the brain show negative correlation with aggression, and a mutation in the gene that codes for the 5-HT2A receptor may double the risk of suicide for those with that genotype. Serotonin in the brain is not usually degraded after use, but is collected by serotonergic neurons by serotonin transporters on their cell surfaces. Studies have revealed nearly 10% of total variance in anxiety-related personality depends on variations in the description of where, when and how many serotonin transporters the neurons should deploy.

===Outside the nervous system===

====Digestive tract (emetic)====
Serotonin regulates gastrointestinal (GI) function. The gut is surrounded by enterochromaffin cells, which release serotonin in response to food in the lumen. This makes the gut contract around the food. Platelets in the veins draining the gut collect excess serotonin. There are often serotonin abnormalities in gastrointestinal disorders such as constipation and irritable bowel syndrome.

If irritants are present in the food, the enterochromaffin cells release more serotonin to make the gut move faster, i.e., to cause diarrhea, so the gut is emptied of the noxious substance. If serotonin is released in the blood faster than the platelets can absorb it, the level of free serotonin in the blood is increased. This activates 5-HT3 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone that stimulate vomiting. Thus, drugs and toxins stimulate serotonin release from enterochromaffin cells in the gut wall can induce emesis. The enterochromaffin cells not only react to bad food but are also very sensitive to irradiation and cancer chemotherapy. Drugs that block 5HT3 are very effective in controlling the nausea and vomiting produced by cancer treatment, and are considered the gold standard for this purpose.

====Lungs====
The lung, including that of reptiles, contains specialized epithelial cells that occur as solitary cells or as clusters called neuroepithelial bodies or bronchial Kulchitsky cells or alternatively &quot;K cells&quot;. These are enterochromaffin cells that like those in the gut release serotonin. Their function is probably vasoconstriction during hypoxia.

====Skin====
Serotonin is also produced by Merkel cells which are part of the somatosensory system.

====Bone metabolism====
In mice and humans, alterations in serotonin levels and signalling have been shown to regulate bone mass. Mice that lack brain serotonin have osteopenia, while mice that lack gut serotonin have high bone density. In humans, increased blood serotonin levels have been shown to be a significant negative predictor of low bone density. Serotonin can also be synthesized, albeit at very low levels, in the bone cells. It mediates its actions on bone cells using three different receptors. Through 5-HT1B receptors, it negatively regulates bone mass, while it does so positively through 5-HT2B receptors and 5-HT2C receptors. There is very delicate balance between physiological role of gut serotonin and its pathology. Increase in the extracellular content of serotonin results in a complex relay of signals in the osteoblasts culminating in FoxO1/ Creb and ATF4 dependent transcriptional events. Following the 2008 findings that gut serotonin regulates bone mass, the mechanistic investigations into what regulates serotonin synthesis from the gut in the regulation of bone mass have started. Piezo1 has been shown to sense RNA in the gut and relay this information through serotonin synthesis to the bone by acting as a sensor of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) governing 5-HT production. Intestinal epithelium-specific deletion of mouse &quot;Piezo1&quot; profoundly disturbed gut peristalsis, impeded experimental colitis, and suppressed serum 5-HT levels. Because of systemic 5-HT deficiency, conditional knockout of &quot;Piezo1&quot; increased bone formation. Notably, fecal ssRNA was identified as a natural Piezo1 ligand, and ssRNA-stimulated 5-HT synthesis from the gut was evoked in a MyD88/TRIF-independent manner. Colonic infusion of RNase A suppressed gut motility and increased bone mass. These findings suggest gut ssRNA as a master determinant of systemic 5-HT levels, indicating the ssRNA-Piezo1 axis as a potential prophylactic target for treatment of bone and gut disorders. Studies in 2008, 2010 and 2019 have opened the potential for serotonin research to treat bone mass disorders.

====Organ development====
Since serotonin signals resource availability it is not surprising that it affects organ development. Many human and animal studies have shown that nutrition in early life can influence, in adulthood, such things as body fatness, blood lipids, blood pressure, atherosclerosis, behavior, learning, and longevity. Rodent experiment shows that neonatal exposure to SSRIs makes persistent changes in the serotonergic transmission of the brain resulting in behavioral changes, which are reversed by treatment with antidepressants. By treating normal and knockout mice lacking the serotonin transporter with fluoxetine scientists showed that normal emotional reactions in adulthood, like a short latency to escape foot shocks and inclination to explore new environments were dependent on active serotonin transporters during the neonatal period.

Human serotonin can also act as a growth factor directly. Liver damage increases cellular expression of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors, mediating liver compensatory regrowth (see ) Serotonin present in the blood then stimulates cellular growth to repair liver damage.

5-HT2B receptors also activate osteocytes, which build up bone However, serotonin also inhibits osteoblasts, through 5-HT1B receptors.

====Cardiovascular growth factor====
Serotonin, in addition, evokes endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation and stimulates, through a 5-HT1B receptor-mediated mechanism, the phosphorylation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures. In blood, serotonin is collected from plasma by platelets, which store it. It is thus active wherever platelets bind in damaged tissue, as a vasoconstrictor to stop bleeding, and also as a fibrocyte mitotic (growth factor), to aid healing.

====Adipose tissue====
Serotonin also regulates white and brown adipose tissue function, and adipocytes are capable of producing 5-HT separately from the gut. Serotonin increases lipogenesis through HTR2A in white adipose tissue, and suppressed thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue via Htr3.

==Pharmacology==
Several classes of drugs target the serotonin system, including some antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, analgesics, antimigraine drugs, antiemetics, appetite suppressants, and anticonvulsants, as well as psychedelics and entactogens.

===Mechanism of action===
At rest, serotonin is stored within the vesicles of presynaptic neurons. When stimulated by nerve impulses, serotonin is released as a neurotransmitter into the synapse, reversibly binding to the postsynaptic receptor to induce a nerve impulse on the postsynaptic neuron. Serotonin can also bind to auto-receptors on the presynaptic neuron to regulate the synthesis and release of serotonin. Normally serotonin is taken back into the presynaptic neuron to stop its action, then reused or broken down by monoamine oxidase.

===Antidepressants===
Drugs that alter serotonin levels are used in treating depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) prevent the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters (including serotonin), and therefore increase concentrations of the neurotransmitter in the brain. MAOI therapy is associated with many adverse drug reactions, and patients are at risk of hypertensive emergency triggered by foods with high tyramine content, and certain drugs. Some drugs inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin, making it stay in the synaptic cleft longer. The tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine. The newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have fewer side-effects and fewer interactions with other drugs.

Certain SSRI medications have been shown to lower serotonin levels below the baseline after chronic use, despite initial increases. The &quot;5-HTTLPR&quot; gene codes for the number of serotonin transporters in the brain, with more serotonin transporters causing decreased duration and magnitude of serotonergic signaling. The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism (l/l) causing more serotonin transporters to be formed is also found to be more resilient against depression and anxiety.

Besides their use in treating depression and anxiety, certain serotonergic antidepressants are also approved and used to treat fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, and chronic fatigue syndrome.

===Anxiolytics===
Azapirone anxiolytics like buspirone and tandospirone act as serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonists.

===Antipsychotics===
Many antipsychotics bind to and modulate serotonin receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, among others. Activation of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and blockade of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors may contribute to the therapeutic antipsychotic effects of these agents, whereas antagonism of serotonin 5-HT2C receptors has been especially implicated in side effects of antipsychotics.

===Antimigraine agents===
Antimigraine agents such as the triptans like sumatriptan act as agonists of the serotonin 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, and/or 5-HT1F receptors. Earlier antimigraine agents were the ergoline derivatives and ergot-related drugs such as ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, and methysergide, which act as non-selective serotonin receptor agonists.

===Antiemetics===
Some serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron, granisetron, and tropisetron, are important antiemetic agents. They are particularly important in treating the nausea and vomiting that occur during anticancer chemotherapy using cytotoxic drugs. Another application is in the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting.

===Appetite suppressants===
Some serotonin releasing agents, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and/or serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonists, such as fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, chlorphentermine, sibutramine, and lorcaserin, have been approved and used as appetite suppressants for purposes of weight loss in the treatment of overweightness or obesity. Several of the preceding agents have been withdrawn from the market due to toxicity, such as cardiac fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension.

===Anticonvulsants===
Although it was previously withdrawn from the market as an appetite suppressant, fenfluramine was reintroduced as an anticonvulsant for treatment of seizures in certain rare forms of epilepsy like Dravet syndrome and Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. Selective serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonists, like lorcaserin, bexicaserin, and BMB-101, are also being developed for this use.

===Psychedelics===
Serotonergic psychedelics, including drugs like psilocybin (found in psilocybin mushrooms), dimethyltryptamine (DMT) (found in ayahuasca), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline (found in peyote cactus), and 5-MeO-DMT (found in &quot;Anadenanthera&quot; trees and the &quot;Bufo alvarius&quot; toad), are non-selective agonists of the serotonin receptors and mediate their hallucinogenic effects specifically by activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. This is evidenced by the fact that serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists and so-called &quot;trip killers&quot; like ketanserin block the hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics in humans, among many other findings. Some serotonergic psychedelics, like psilocin, DMT, and 5-MeO-DMT, are substituted tryptamines and are very similar in chemical structure to serotonin.

Serotonin itself, despite acting as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist, is thought to be non-hallucinogenic. The hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics appear to be mediated by activation of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors expressed in a population of cortical neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, unlike most serotonin and related receptors, are expressed intracellularly. In addition, the neurons containing them lack expression of the serotonin transporter (SERT), which normally transports serotonin from the extracellular space to the intracellular space within neurons. Serotonin itself is too hydrophilic to enter serotonergic neurons without the SERT, and hence these serotonin 5-HT2A receptors are inaccessible to serotonin. Conversely, serotonergic psychedelics are more lipophilic than serotonin and readily enter these neurons. In addition to explaining why serotonin does not show psychedelic effects, these findings may explain why drugs that increase serotonin levels, like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and various other types of serotonergic agents, do not produce psychedelic effects. Artificial expression of the SERT in these medial prefrontal cortex neurons resulted in the serotonin releasing agent &quot;para&quot;-chloroamphetamine (PCA), which does not normally show psychedelic-like effects, being able to produce psychedelic-like effects in animals.

Although serotonin itself is non-hallucinogenic, administration of very high doses of a serotonin precursor, like tryptophan or 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), or intracerebroventricular injection of high doses of serotonin directly into the brain, can produce psychedelic-like effects in animals. These psychedelic-like effects can be abolished by indolethylamine &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase (INMT) inhibitors, which block conversion of serotonin and other endogenous tryptamines into &quot;N&quot;-methylated tryptamines, including &quot;N&quot;-methylserotonin (NMS; norbufotenin), bufotenin (5-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine; 5-HO-DMT), &quot;N&quot;-methyltryptamine (NMT), and &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). These &quot;N&quot;-methyltryptamines are much more lipophilic than serotonin and, in contrast, are able to diffuse into serotonergic neurons and activate intracellular serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Another possible metabolite of serotonin with psychedelic-like effects in animals is 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT).

DMT is a naturally occurring endogenous compound in the body. In relation to the fact that serotonin itself is unable to activate intracellular serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, it is possible that DMT might be the endogenous ligand of these receptors rather than serotonin.

===Entactogens===
The entactogen MDMA is a serotonin releasing agent and, while it also possesses other actions such as concomitant release of norepinephrine and dopamine and weak direct agonism of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, its serotonin release plays a key role in its unique entactogenic effects. Entactogens like MDMA should be distinguished from other drugs such as stimulants like amphetamine and psychedelics like LSD, although MDMA itself also has some characteristics of both of these types of agents. Coadministration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which block the serotonin transporter (SERT) and prevent MDMA from inducing serotonin release, markedly reduce the subjective effects of MDMA, demonstrating the key role of serotonin in the effects of the drug. Serotonin releasing agents like MDMA achieve much greater increases in serotonin levels than SSRIs and have far more robust of subjective effects. Besides MDMA, many other entactogens also exist and are known.

===Serotonin syndrome===
Extremely high levels of serotonin or activation of certain serotonin receptors can cause a condition known as serotonin syndrome, with toxic and potentially fatal effects. In practice, such toxic levels are essentially impossible to reach through an overdose of a single antidepressant drug, but require a combination of serotonergic agents, such as an SSRI with a MAOI, which may occur in therapeutic doses. However, serotonin syndrome can occur with overdose of certain serotonin receptor agonists, like the NBOMe series of serotonergic psychedelics.

The intensity of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome vary over a wide spectrum, and the milder forms are seen even at nontoxic levels. It is estimated that 14% of patients experiencing serotonin syndrome overdose on SSRIs; meanwhile the fatality rate is between 2% and 12%.

===Cardiac fibrosis and other fibroses===
Some serotonergic agonist drugs cause fibrosis anywhere in the body, particularly the syndrome of retroperitoneal fibrosis, as well as cardiac valve fibrosis.

In the past, three groups of serotonergic drugs have been epidemiologically linked with these syndromes. These are the serotonergic vasoconstrictive antimigraine drugs (ergotamine and methysergide), the serotonergic appetite suppressant drugs (fenfluramine, chlorphentermine, and aminorex), and certain anti-Parkinsonian dopaminergic agonists, which also stimulate serotonergic 5-HT2B receptors. These include pergolide and cabergoline, but not the more dopamine-specific lisuride.

As with fenfluramine, some of these drugs have been withdrawn from the market after groups taking them showed a statistical increase of one or more of the side effects described. An example is pergolide. The drug was declining in use since it was reported in 2003 to be associated with cardiac fibrosis.

Two independent studies published in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; in January 2007 implicated pergolide, along with cabergoline, in causing valvular heart disease. As a result of this, the FDA removed pergolide from the United States market in March 2007. (Since cabergoline is not approved in the United States for Parkinson&#x27;s Disease, but for hyperprolactinemia, the drug remains on the market. Treatment for hyperprolactinemia requires lower doses than that for Parkinson&#x27;s Disease, diminishing the risk of valvular heart disease).

==Comparative biology and evolution==

===Unicellular organisms===
Serotonin is used by a variety of single-cell organisms for various purposes. SSRIs have been found to be toxic to algae. The gastrointestinal parasite &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot; secretes serotonin, causing a sustained secretory diarrhea in some people. Patients infected with &quot;E. histolytica&quot; have been found to have highly elevated serum serotonin levels, which returned to normal following resolution of the infection. &quot;E. histolytica&quot; also responds to the presence of serotonin by becoming more virulent. This means serotonin secretion not only serves to increase the spread of entamoebas by giving the host diarrhea but also serves to coordinate their behaviour according to their population density, a phenomenon known as quorum sensing. Outside the gut of a host, there is nothing that the entamoebas provoke to release serotonin, hence the serotonin concentration is very low. Low serotonin signals to the entamoebas they are outside a host and they become less virulent to conserve energy. When they enter a new host, they multiply in the gut, and become more virulent as the enterochromaffine cells get provoked by them and the serotonin concentration increases.

===Edible plants and mushrooms===
In drying seeds, serotonin production is a way to get rid of the buildup of poisonous ammonia. The ammonia is collected and placed in the indole part of -tryptophan, which is then decarboxylated by tryptophan decarboxylase to give tryptamine, which is then hydroxylated by a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, yielding serotonin.

However, since serotonin is a major gastrointestinal tract modulator, it may be produced in the fruits of plants as a way of speeding the passage of seeds through the digestive tract, in the same way as many well-known seed and fruit associated laxatives. Serotonin is found in mushrooms, fruits, and vegetables. The highest values of 25–400 mg/kg have been found in nuts of the walnut (&quot;Juglans&quot;) and hickory (&quot;Carya&quot;) genera. Serotonin concentrations of 3–30 mg/kg have been found in plantains, pineapples, banana, kiwifruit, plums, and tomatoes. Moderate levels from 0.1–3 mg/kg have been found in a wide range of tested vegetables.

Serotonin is one compound of the poison contained in stinging nettles (&quot;Urtica dioica&quot;), where it causes pain on injection in the same manner as its presence in insect venoms. It is also naturally found in &quot;Paramuricea clavata&quot;, or the Red Sea Fan.

Serotonin and tryptophan have been found in chocolate with varying cocoa contents. The highest serotonin content (2.93 μg/g) was found in chocolate with 85% cocoa, and the highest tryptophan content (13.27–13.34 μg/g) was found in 70–85% cocoa. The intermediate in the synthesis from tryptophan to serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptophan, was not found.

Root development in &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; is stimulated and modulated by serotonin – in various ways at various concentrations.

Serotonin serves as a plant defense chemical against fungi. When infected with Fusarium crown rot (&quot;Fusarium pseudograminearum&quot;), wheat (&quot;Triticum aestivum&quot;) greatly increases its production of tryptophan to synthesize new serotonin. The function of this is poorly understood but wheat also produces serotonin when infected by &quot;Stagonospora nodorum&quot; – in that case to retard spore production. The model cereal &quot;Brachypodium distachyon&quot; – used as a research substitute for wheat and other production cereals – also produces serotonin, coumaroyl-serotonin, and feruloyl-serotonin in response to &quot;F. graminearum&quot;. This produces a slight antimicrobial effect. &quot;B. distachyon&quot; produces more serotonin (and conjugates) in response to deoxynivalenol (DON)-producing &quot;F. graminearum&quot; than non-DON-producing. &quot;Solanum lycopersicum&quot; produces many AA conjugates – including several of serotonin – in its leaves, stems, and roots in response to &quot;Ralstonia solanacearum&quot; infection.

Serotonin occurs in several hallucinogenic mushrooms of the genus &quot;Panaeolus&quot;.

===Invertebrates===
Serotonin functions as a neurotransmitter in the nervous systems of most animals.

====Nematodes====
For example, in the roundworm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, which feeds on bacteria, serotonin is released as a signal in response to positive events, such as finding a new source of food or in male animals finding a female with which to mate. When a well-fed worm feels bacteria on its cuticle, dopamine is released, which slows it down; if it is starved, serotonin also is released, which slows the animal down further. This mechanism increases the amount of time animals spend in the presence of food. The released serotonin activates the muscles used for feeding, while octopamine suppresses them. Serotonin diffuses to serotonin-sensitive neurons, which control the animal&#x27;s perception of nutrient availability.

====Decapods====
If lobsters are injected with serotonin, they behave like dominant individuals whereas octopamine causes subordinate behavior. A crayfish that is frightened may flip its tail to flee, and the effect of serotonin on this behavior depends largely on the animal&#x27;s social status. Serotonin inhibits the fleeing reaction in subordinates, but enhances it in socially dominant or isolated individuals. The reason for this is social experience alters the proportion between serotonin receptors (5-HT receptors) that have opposing effects on the fight-or-flight response. The effect of 5-HT1 receptors predominates in subordinate animals, while 5-HT2 receptors predominates in dominants.

====In venoms====
Serotonin is a common component of invertebrate venoms, salivary glands, nervous tissues, and various other tissues, across molluscs, insects, crustaceans, scorpions, various kinds of worms, and jellyfish. Adult &quot;Rhodnius prolixus&quot; – hematophagous on vertebrates – secrete lipocalins into the wound during feeding. In 2003 these lipocalins were demonstrated to sequester serotonin to prevent vasoconstriction (and possibly coagulation) in the host.

====Insects====
Serotonin is evolutionarily conserved and appears across the animal kingdom. It is seen in insect processes in roles similar to in the human central nervous system, such as memory, appetite, sleep, and behavior. Some circuits in mushroom bodies are serotonergic. (See specific &quot;Drosophila&quot; example below, §Dipterans.)

=====Acrididae=====
Locust swarming is initiated &quot;but not maintained&quot; by serotonin, with release being triggered by tactile contact between individuals. This transforms social preference from aversion to a gregarious state that enables coherent groups. Learning in flies and honeybees is affected by the presence of serotonin.

=====Role in insecticides=====
Insect 5-HT receptors have similar sequences to the vertebrate versions, but pharmacological differences have been seen. Invertebrate drug response has been far less characterized than mammalian pharmacology and the potential for species selective insecticides has been discussed.

=====Hymenopterans=====
Wasps and hornets have serotonin in their venom, which causes pain and inflammation as do scorpions. &quot;Pheidole dentata&quot; takes on more and more tasks in the colony as it gets older, which requires it to respond to more and more olfactory cues in the course of performing them. This olfactory response broadening was demonstrated to go along with increased serotonin and dopamine, but not octopamine in 2006.

=====Dipterans=====
If flies are fed serotonin, they are more aggressive; flies depleted of serotonin still exhibit aggression, but they do so much less frequently. In their crops it plays a vital role in digestive motility produced by contraction. Serotonin that acts on the crop is exogenous to the crop itself and 2012 research suggested that it probably originated in the serotonin neural plexus in the thoracic-abdominal synganglion. In 2011 a &quot;Drosophila&quot; serotonergic mushroom body was found to work in concert with &quot;Amnesiac&quot; to form memories. In 2007 serotonin was found to promote aggression in &quot;Diptera&quot;, which was counteracted by neuropeptide F – a surprising find given that they both promote courtship, which is usually similar to aggression in most respects.

=== Vertebrates ===
Serotonin, also referred to as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a neurotransmitter most known for its involvement in mood disorders in humans. It is also a widely present neuromodulator among vertebrates and invertebrates. Serotonin has been found having associations with many physiological systems such as cardiovascular, thermoregulation, and behavioral functions, including: circadian rhythm, appetite, aggressive and sexual behavior, sensorimotor reactivity and learning, and pain sensitivity. Serotonin&#x27;s function in neurological systems along with specific behaviors among vertebrates found to be strongly associated with serotonin will be further discussed. Two relevant case studies are also mentioned regarding serotonin development involving teleost fish and mice.

In mammals, 5-HT is highly concentrated in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area and raphe nuclei. Lesser concentrated areas include other brain regions and the spinal cord. 5-HT neurons are also shown to be highly branched, indicating that they are structurally prominent for influencing multiple areas of the CNS at the same time, although this trend is exclusive solely to mammals.

====5-HT system in vertebrates====
Vertebrates are multicellular organisms in the phylum Chordata that possess a backbone and a nervous system. This includes mammals, fish, reptiles, birds, etc. In humans, the nervous system is composed of the central and peripheral nervous system, with little known about the specific mechanisms of neurotransmitters in most other vertebrates. However, it is known that while serotonin is involved in stress and behavioral responses, it is also important in cognitive functions. Brain organization in most vertebrates includes 5-HT cells in the hindbrain. In addition to this, 5-HT is often found in other sections of the brain in non-placental vertebrates, including the basal forebrain and pretectum. Since location of serotonin receptors contribute to behavioral responses, this suggests serotonin is part of specific pathways in non-placental vertebrates that are not present in amniotic organisms. Teleost fish and mice are organisms most often used to study the connection between serotonin and vertebrate behavior. Both organisms show similarities in the effect of serotonin on behavior, but differ in the mechanism in which the responses occur.

=====Dogs / canine species=====
There are few studies of serotonin in dogs. One study reported serotonin values were higher at dawn than at dusk. In another study, serum 5-HT levels did not seem to be associated with dogs&#x27; behavioural response to a stressful situation. Urinary serotonin/creatinine ratio in bitches tended to be higher 4 weeks after surgery. In addition, serotonin was positively correlated with both cortisol and progesterone but not with testosterone after ovariohysterectomy.

=====Teleost fish=====
Like non-placental vertebrates, teleost fish also possess 5-HT cells in other sections of the brain, including the basal forebrain. &quot;Danio rerio&quot; (zebra fish) are a species of teleost fish often used for studying serotonin within the brain. Despite much being unknown about serotonergic systems in vertebrates, the importance in moderating stress and social interaction is known. It is hypothesized that AVT and CRF cooperate with serotonin in the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis. These neuropeptides influence the plasticity of the teleost, affecting its ability to change and respond to its environment. Subordinate fish in social settings show a drastic increase in 5-HT concentrations. High levels of 5-HT long term influence the inhibition of aggression in subordinate fish.

=====Mice=====
Researchers at the Department of Pharmacology and Medical Chemistry used serotonergic drugs on male mice to study the effects of selected drugs on their behavior. Mice in isolation exhibit increased levels of agonistic behavior towards one another. Results found that serotonergic drugs reduce aggression in isolated mice while simultaneously increasing social interaction. Each of the treatments use a different mechanism for targeting aggression, but ultimately all have the same outcome. While the study shows that serotonergic drugs successfully target serotonin receptors, it does not show specifics of the mechanisms that affect behavior, as all types of drugs tended to reduce aggression in isolated male mice. Aggressive mice kept out of isolation may respond differently to changes in serotonin reuptake.

====Behavior====
Like in humans, serotonin is extremely involved in regulating behavior in most other vertebrates. This includes not only response and social behaviors, but also influencing mood. Defects in serotonin pathways can lead to intense variations in mood, as well as symptoms of mood disorders, which can be present in more than just humans.

=====Social interaction=====
One of the most researched aspects of social interaction in which serotonin is involved is aggression. Aggression is regulated by the 5-HT system, as serotonin levels can both induce or inhibit aggressive behaviors, as seen in mice (see section on Mice) and crabs. While this is widely accepted, it is unknown if serotonin interacts directly or indirectly with parts of the brain influencing aggression and other behaviors. Studies of serotonin levels show that they drastically increase and decrease during social interactions, and they generally correlate with inhibiting or inciting aggressive behavior. The exact mechanism of serotonin influencing social behaviors is unknown, as pathways in the 5-HT system in various vertebrates can differ greatly.

=====Response to stimuli=====
Serotonin is important in environmental response pathways, along with other neurotransmitters. Specifically, it has been found to be involved in auditory processing in social settings, as primary sensory systems are connected to social interactions. Serotonin is found in the IC structure of the midbrain, which processes specie specific and non-specific social interactions and vocalizations. It also receives acoustic projections that convey signals to auditory processing regions. Research has proposed that serotonin shapes the auditory information being received by the IC and therefore is influential in the responses to auditory stimuli. This can influence how an organism responds to the sounds of predatory or other impactful species in their environment, as serotonin uptake can influence aggression or social interaction.

=====Mood=====
We can describe mood not as specific to an emotional status, but as associated with a relatively long-lasting emotional state. Serotonin&#x27;s association with mood is most known for various forms of depression and bipolar disorders in humans. Disorders caused by serotonergic activity potentially contribute to the many symptoms of major depression, such as overall mood, activity, suicidal thoughts and sexual and cognitive dysfunction. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI&#x27;s) are a class of drugs demonstrated to be an effective treatment in major depressive disorder and are the most prescribed class of antidepressants. SSRI&#x27;s function is to block the reuptake of serotonin, making more serotonin available to absorb by the receiving neuron. Animals have been studied for decades in order to understand depressive behavior among species. One of the most familiar studies, the forced swimming test (FST), was performed to measure potential antidepressant activity. Rats were placed in an inescapable container of water, at which point time spent immobile and number of active behaviors (such as splashing or climbing) were compared before and after a panel of anti-depressant drugs were administered. Antidepressants that selectively inhibit NE reuptake were shown to reduce immobility and selectively increase climbing without affecting swimming. However, results of the SSRI&#x27;s also show reduced immobility but increased swimming without affecting climbing. This study demonstrated the importance of behavioral tests for antidepressants, as they can detect drugs with an effect on core behavior along with behavioral components of species.

===Growth and reproduction===
In the nematode &quot;C. elegans&quot;, artificial depletion of serotonin or the increase of octopamine cues behavior typical of a low-food environment: &quot;C. elegans&quot; becomes more active, and mating and egg-laying are suppressed, while the opposite occurs if serotonin is increased or octopamine is decreased in this animal. Serotonin is necessary for normal nematode male mating behavior, and the inclination to leave food to search for a mate. The serotonergic signaling used to adapt the worm&#x27;s behaviour to fast changes in the environment affects insulin-like signaling and the TGF beta signaling pathway, which control long-term adaption.

In the fruit fly insulin both regulates blood sugar as well as acting as a growth factor. Thus, in the fruit fly, serotonergic neurons regulate the adult body size by affecting insulin secretion. Serotonin has also been identified as the trigger for swarm behavior in locusts. In humans, though insulin regulates blood sugar and IGF regulates growth, serotonin controls the release of both hormones, modulating insulin release from the beta cells in the pancreas through serotonylation of GTPase signaling proteins. Exposure to SSRIs during pregnancy reduces fetal growth.

Genetically altered &quot;C. elegans&quot; worms that lack serotonin have an increased reproductive lifespan, may become obese, and sometimes present with arrested development at a dormant larval state.

===Aging and age-related phenotypes===
Serotonin is known to regulate aging, learning, and memory. The first evidence comes from the study of longevity in &quot;C. elegans&quot;. During early phase of aging, the level of serotonin increases, which alters locomotory behaviors and associative memory. The effect is restored by mutations and drugs (including mianserin and methiothepin) that inhibit serotonin receptors. The observation does not contradict with the notion that the serotonin level goes down in mammals and humans, which is typically seen in late but not early phase of aging.

==Biochemical mechanisms==

===Biosynthesis===
In animals and humans, serotonin is synthesized from the amino acid -tryptophan by a short metabolic pathway consisting of two enzymes, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (DDC), and the coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate. The TPH-mediated reaction is the rate-limiting step in the pathway.

TPH has been shown to exist in two forms: TPH1, found in several tissues, and TPH2, which is a neuron-specific isoform.

Serotonin can be synthesized from tryptophan in the lab using &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; and &quot;Psilocybe coprophila&quot; as catalysts. The first phase to 5-hydroxytryptophan would require letting tryptophan sit in ethanol and water for 7 days, then mixing in enough HCl (or other acid) to bring the pH to 3, and then adding NaOH to make a pH of 13 for 1 hour. &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; would be the catalyst for this first phase. The second phase to synthesizing tryptophan itself from the 5-hydroxytryptophan intermediate would require adding ethanol and water, and letting sit for 30 days this time. The next two steps would be the same as the first phase: adding HCl to make the pH = 3, and then adding NaOH to make the pH very basic at 13 for 1 hour. This phase uses the &quot;Psilocybe coprophila&quot; as the catalyst for the reaction.

Serotonin taken orally does not pass into the serotonergic pathways of the central nervous system, because it does not cross the blood–brain barrier. However, tryptophan and its metabolite 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), from which serotonin is synthesized, do cross the blood–brain barrier. These agents are available as dietary supplements and in various foods, and may be effective serotonergic agents.

One product of serotonin breakdown is 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), which is excreted in the urine. Serotonin and 5-HIAA are sometimes produced in excess amounts by certain tumors or cancers, and levels of these substances may be measured in the urine to test for these tumors.

==Analytical chemistry==
Indium tin oxide is recommended for the electrode material in electrochemical investigation of concentrations produced, detected, or consumed by microbes. A mass spectrometry technique was developed in 1994 to measure the molecular weight of both natural and synthetic serotonins.

==History and etymology==
It had been known to physiologists for over a century that a vasoconstrictor material appears in serum when blood was allowed to clot. In 1935, Italian Vittorio Erspamer, working in Pavia, showed an extract from enterochromaffin cells made intestines contract. Some believed it contained adrenaline, but two years later, Erspamer was able to show it was a previously unknown amine, which he named &quot;enteramine&quot;. In 1948, Maurice M. Rapport, Arda Green, and Irvine Page of the Cleveland Clinic discovered a vasoconstrictor substance in blood serum, and since it was a serum agent affecting vascular tone, they named it serotonin.

In 1952, enteramine was shown to be the same substance as serotonin, and as the broad range of physiological roles was elucidated, the abbreviation 5-HT of the proper chemical name 5-hydroxytryptamine became the preferred name in the pharmacological field. Synonyms of serotonin include: 5-hydroxytriptamine, enteramine, substance DS, and 3-(β-aminoethyl)-5-hydroxyindole. In 1953, Betty Twarog and Page discovered serotonin in the central nervous system. Page regarded Erspamer&#x27;s work on &quot;Octopus vulgaris&quot;, &quot;Discoglossus pictus&quot;, &quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot;, &quot;Bolinus brandaris&quot;, &quot;Sepia&quot;, &quot;Mytilus&quot;, and &quot;Ostrea&quot; as valid and fundamental to understanding this newly identified substance, but regarded his earlier results in various models – especially those from rat blood – to be too confounded by the presence of other bioactive chemicals, including some other vasoactives.

<text>Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema ( ; born Lourens Alma Tadema, ; 8 January 1836 – 25 June 1912) was a Dutch painter who later settled in the United Kingdom, becoming the last officially recognised denizen in 1873. Born in Dronryp, the Netherlands, and trained at the Royal Academy of Antwerp, Belgium, he settled in London, England in 1870 and spent the rest of his life there. 

A painter of mostly classical subjects, he became famous for his depictions of the luxury and decadence of the Roman Empire, with languorous figures set in fabulous marbled interiors or against a backdrop of dazzling blue Mediterranean sea and sky. One of the most popular Victorian painters, Alma-Tadema was admired during his lifetime for his draftsmanship and accurate depictions of Classical antiquity, but his work fell out of fashion after his death, and only since the 1960s has it been appreciated for its importance within Victorian painting.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Alma-Tadema was born on 8 January 1836 in the village of Dronryp in the province of Friesland in the north of the Netherlands. The surname &quot;Tadema&quot; is an old Frisian patronymic, meaning &#x27;son of Tade&#x27;, while the names &quot;Lourens&quot; and &quot;Alma&quot; came from his godfather. He was the sixth child of Pieter Jiltes Tadema (1797–1840), the village notary, and the third child of Hinke Dirks Brouwer (1800–1863). His father had three sons from a previous marriage. His parents&#x27; first child died young, and the second was Artje (1834–1876), Lourens&#x27; sister, for whom he had great affection.

The Tadema family moved in 1838 to the nearby city of Leeuwarden, where Pieter&#x27;s position as a notary would be more lucrative. His father died when Lourens was four, leaving his mother with five children: Lourens, his sister, and three boys from his father&#x27;s first marriage. His mother had artistic leanings and decided that drawing lessons should be incorporated into the children&#x27;s education. He received his first art training with a local drawing master hired to teach his older half-brothers.

It was intended that the boy would become a lawyer; but in 1851 at the age of fifteen he suffered a physical and mental breakdown. Diagnosed as consumptive and given only a short time to live, he was allowed to spend his remaining days at his leisure, drawing and painting. Left to his own devices, he regained his health and decided to pursue a career as an artist.

=== Move to Belgium ===
In 1852, he entered the Royal Academy of Antwerp in Belgium where he studied early Dutch and Flemish art, under Gustaf Wappers. During Alma-Tadema&#x27;s four years as a registered student at the academy, he won several awards. Before leaving the academy, towards the end of 1855, he became assistant to the painter and professor Louis (Lodewijk) Jan de Taeye, whose courses in history and historical costume he had greatly enjoyed at the academy. Although de Taeye was not an outstanding painter, Alma-Tadema respected him and became his studio assistant, working with him for three years. De Taeye introduced him to books that influenced his desire to portray Merovingian subjects early in his career. He was encouraged to depict historical accuracy in his paintings, a trait for which the artist became known.

De Taeye’s greatest influence on his young pupil was his interest in ancient civilisations, particularly the Egyptians, first displayed in &quot;The Dying Cleopatra&quot;, begun in 1859 but later destroyed by the artist, and &quot;The Sad Father&quot; or &quot;The Unfavourable Oracle&quot; (Opus X), painted in 1858. Originally a large processional painting in an architectural setting, it was later cut down to a smaller scale to show only three figures; this reduced painting is now in the Johannesburg Art Gallery. Another section of &quot;The Sad Father&quot; was modified by the artist ten years later, in 1869, and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1871 under the title &quot;The Grand Chamberlain to Sesostris the Great&quot;. Of the large original painting, Sir Edmund William Gosse will later say: &quot;“As the first of a series of Egyptian pictures, some of which are to be counted among the highest expressions of Alma-Tadema’s genius, The Unfavourable Oracle is a work of great interest.” &quot;

The artist planned two other Egyptian-themed paintings in the years 1857 and 1858, named &quot;Going to the Oracle&quot; and &quot;The Contrary Oracle&quot;, of which a number of preparatory drawings that were once in Gosse&#x27;s possession survive to this day. These paintings were either never executed, or else destroyed, as during his student years Alma-Tadema frequently destroyed or painted over works that he was unhappy with.

As the artist&#x27;s contemporary biographer Percy Cross Standing noted of Lawrence Alma-Tadema&#x27;s early paintings of Egyptian subjects in particular, &quot;“So careful at all times about detail, he took extraordinary care in the preparation of his preliminary sketches for these pictures.”&quot; When asked why he had chosen to paint Egyptian themes, Alma-Tadema said: &quot;“Where else should I have begun as soon as I had become acquainted with the life of the ancients? The first thing a child learns of ancient history is about the court of Pharaoh; and if we go back to the source of art and science, must we not return to Egypt?”&quot;

Several of his early Egyptian paintings contain precise depictions of objects and settings, which reflect the artist&#x27;s close study of an important reference book of his era: Sir John Gardner Wilkinson&#x27;s &quot;“The Manners and Customs of Ancient Egyptians”&quot;, published in 1837. Alma-Tadema left Taeye&#x27;s studio in November 1858 returning to Leeuwarden before settling in Antwerp, where he began working with the painter Baron Jan August Hendrik Leys, whose studio was one of the most highly regarded in Belgium. Under his guidance Alma-Tadema painted his first major work: &quot;The Education of the children of Clovis&quot; (1861). This painting created a sensation among critics and artists when it was exhibited that year at the Artistic Congress in Antwerp. It is said to have laid the foundation of his fame and reputation. Alma-Tadema related that although Leys thought the completed painting better than he had expected, he was critical of the treatment of marble, which he compared to cheese. He collaborated with Hendrik Leys on the series of wall paintings in the Leys Hall on the second floor of Antwerp City Hall, which depict significant moments in the history of The Netherlands.

Alma-Tadema took this criticism very seriously, and it led him to improve his technique and to become the world&#x27;s foremost painter of marble and variegated granite. Despite any reproaches from his master, &quot;The Education of the Children of Clovis&quot; was well received by critics and artists alike and was eventually purchased and subsequently given to King Leopold of Belgium. In 1860 he befriended the Anglo-Dutch Dommersen family of artists in Utrecht.

===Early works===
Merovingian subjects were the painter&#x27;s favourites up to the mid-1860s. However Merovingian subjects did not have a wide international appeal, so he switched to themes of life in ancient Egypt, which were more popular. In 1862 Alma-Tadema left Leys&#x27;s studio and started his own career, establishing himself as a significant classical-subject artist.

On 3 January 1863 his invalid mother died, and on 24 September he was married, in Antwerp City Hall, to Marie-Pauline Gressin-Dumoulin de Boisgirard, the daughter of Eugène Gressin-Dumoulin, a French journalist living near Brussels. Nothing is known of their meeting and little of Pauline herself, as Alma-Tadema never spoke about her after her death in 1869. Her image appears in a number of oils, though he painted her portrait only three times, the most notable appearing in &quot;My studio&quot; (1867). The couple had three children. Their eldest and only son lived only a few months dying of smallpox. Their two daughters, Laurence (1865–1940) and Anna (1867–1943), both had artistic leanings: the former in literature, the latter in art. Neither would marry.

Alma-Tadema and his wife spent their honeymoon in Florence, Rome, Naples and Pompeii. This, his first visit to Italy, developed his interest in depicting the life of ancient Greece and Rome, especially the latter since he found new inspiration in the ruins of Pompeii, which fascinated him and would inspire much of his work in the coming decades. There he met Geremia Discanno, an Italian painter who had been commissioned by archaeologist Giuseppe Fiorelli to reproduce the brightly painted frescoes being uncovered in the excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum before they faded from exposure. He would consult Discanno a number of times before Discanno&#x27;s death in 1907 to ensure his paintings of antiquity would reflect the lifestyle of residents of the Greco-Roman world accurately.

During the summer of 1864, Tadema met Ernest Gambart, the most influential print publisher and art dealer of the period. Gambart was highly impressed with the work of Tadema, who was then painting &quot;Egyptian Chess Players&quot; (1865). The dealer, recognising at once the unusual gifts of the young painter, gave him an order for twenty-four pictures and arranged for three of Tadema&#x27;s paintings to be shown in London. In 1865, Tadema relocated to Brussels where he was named a knight of the Order of Leopold.

On 28 May 1869, after years of ill health, Pauline died of smallpox at Schaerbeek in Belgium, aged 32. Her death left Tadema disconsolate and depressed. He ceased painting for nearly four months. His sister Artje, who lived with the family, helped with the two daughters then aged five and two. Artje took over the role of housekeeper and remained with the family until 1873 when she married.

During the summer Tadema himself began to suffer from a medical problem which doctors in Brussels were unable to diagnose. Gambart eventually advised him to go to England for another medical opinion. Soon after his arrival in London in December 1869, Alma-Tadema was invited to the home of the painter Ford Madox Brown. There he met Laura Theresa Epps, who was seventeen years old, and fell in love with her at first sight.

===Move to England===
The outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July 1870 encouraged Alma-Tadema to leave the continent and move to London. His infatuation with Laura Epps played a great part in his relocation to England and in addition Gambart felt that the move would be advantageous to the artist&#x27;s career. In stating his reasons for the move, Tadema simply said &quot;I lost my first wife, a French lady with whom I married in 1863, in 1869. Having always had a great predilection for London, the only place where, up till then my work had met with buyers, I decided to leave the continent and go to settle in England, where I have found a true home.&quot;

With his small daughters and sister Artje, Alma-Tadema arrived in London at the beginning of September 1870. The painter wasted no time in contacting Laura, and it was arranged that he would give her painting lessons. During one of these, he proposed marriage. As he was then thirty-four and Laura was now only eighteen, her father was initially opposed to the idea. Dr Epps finally agreed on the condition that they should wait until they knew each other better. They married in July 1871. Laura, under her married name, also won a high reputation as an artist, and appears in numerous of Alma-Tadema&#x27;s canvases after their marriage (&quot;The Women of Amphissa&quot; (1887) being a notable example). This second marriage was enduring and happy, though childless, and Laura became stepmother to Anna and Laurence. Anna became a painter and Laurence became a novelist.

In England he initially adopted the name &quot;Laurence Alma Tadema&quot; instead of &quot;Lourens Alma Tadema&quot; and later used the more English spelling &quot;Lawrence&quot; for his forename. He also incorporated &quot;Alma&quot; into his surname so that he appeared at the beginning of exhibition catalogues, under &quot;A&quot; rather than under &quot;T&quot;. He did not actually hyphenate his last name, but it was done by others and this has since become the convention.

===Victorian painter===

After his arrival in England, where he was to spend the rest of his life, Alma-Tadema&#x27;s career was one of continued success. He became one of the most famous and highly paid artists of his time, acknowledged and rewarded. By 1871 he had met and befriended most of the major Pre-Raphaelite painters and it was in part due to their influence that the artist brightened his palette, varied his hues, and lightened his brushwork.

In 1872 Alma-Tadema organised his paintings into an identification system by including an opus number under his signature and assigning his earlier pictures numbers as well. &quot;Portrait of my sister, Artje&quot;, painted in 1851, is numbered opus I, while two months before his death he completed &quot;Preparations in the Coliseum&quot;, opus CCCCVIII. Such a system made it more difficult for fakes to be passed off as originals.

In 1873 Queen Victoria in Council by letters patent made Alma-Tadema and his wife what are still up to the present time the last British denizens created (the legal process has theoretically not yet been abolished in the United Kingdom), with some limited special rights otherwise only accorded to and enjoyed by British subjects (that is, those would now be called British citizens). The previous year he and his wife made a journey on the continent that lasted five and a half months and took them through Brussels, Germany, and Italy. In Italy Alma-Tadema was able to take in the ancient ruins again; this time he purchased several photographs, mostly of the ruins, which began his immense collection of archival material used in the completion of future paintings. In January 1876, he rented a studio in Rome. The family returned to London in April, visiting the Paris Salon on their way back. In London he regularly met with fellow-artist Emil Fuchs.

Among the most important of his pictures during this period was &quot;An Audience at Agrippa&#x27;s&quot; (1876). When an admirer of the painting offered to pay a substantial sum for a painting with a similar subject, Alma-Tadema simply turned the emperor around to show him leaving, in &quot;After the Audience&quot;. On 19 June 1879, Alma-Tadema was made a Royal Academician. Three years later, a major retrospective of his entire oeuvre was organised at the Grosvenor Gallery in London, including 185 of his pictures.

In 1883 he returned to Rome and Pompeii, where further excavations had taken place since his last visit. He spent a significant amount of time studying the site, going there daily. These excursions gave him an ample source of subject matter as he began to further his knowledge of daily Roman life. At times, however, he integrated so many objects into his paintings that some said they resembled museum catalogues.

One of his most famous paintings is &quot;The Roses of Heliogabalus&quot; (1888) – based on an episode from the life of the debauched Roman emperor Elagabalus (Heliogabalus), the painting depicts the emperor suffocating his guests at an orgy under a cascade of rose petals. The blossoms depicted were sent weekly to the artist&#x27;s London studio from the French Riviera for four months during the winter of 1887–1888.
Among Alma-Tadema&#x27;s works of this period are: &quot;An Earthly Paradise&quot; (1891), &quot;Unconscious Rivals&quot; (1893) &quot;Spring&quot; (1894), &quot;The Coliseum&quot; (1896) and &quot;The Baths of Caracalla&quot; (1899). Although Alma-Tadema&#x27;s fame rests on his paintings set in antiquity, he also painted portraits, landscapes and watercolours, and made some etchings himself. (Many more were made of his paintings by others).

===Personality===
For all the quiet charm and erudition of his paintings, Alma-Tadema himself preserved a youthful sense of mischief. He was childlike in his practical jokes and in his sudden bursts of bad temper, which could as suddenly subside into an engaging smile. In his personal life, Alma-Tadema was an extrovert and had a warm personality. As a man, Lawrence Alma-Tadema was a robust, fun loving and rather portly gentleman. There was not a hint of the delicate artist about him; he was a cheerful lover of wine, women, and parties. 

He has been said to have had most of the characteristics of a child, coupled with the traits of a consummate professional. A perfectionist, he remained in all respects a diligent, if somewhat obsessive and pedantic worker. He was an excellent businessman, and one of the wealthiest artists of the nineteenth century. Alma-Tadema was as firm in money matters as he was with the quality of his work.

===Later years===
Alma-Tadema&#x27;s output decreased with time, partly on account of health, but also because of his obsession with decorating his new home, to which he moved in 1883. Nevertheless, he continued to exhibit throughout the 1880s and 1890s, receiving accolades including the medal of Honour at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889, election to an honorary membership of the Oxford University Dramatic Society in 1890, and the Great Gold Medal at the International Exposition in Brussels of 1897. In 1899 he was knighted in England, only the eighth artist from the Continent to receive this honour. He assisted with organizing the British section at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, as well as exhibiting two works that earned him the Grand Prix Diploma. He also assisted with the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair of 1904, where he was well received.

During this time, Alma-Tadema was very active with theatre design and production, designing many costumes. He also began to design furniture, often modelled after Pompeian or Egyptian motifs, as well as illustrations, textiles, and picture frames. In late 1902 he visited Egypt. These other interests influenced his paintings, as he often incorporated some of his furniture designs and female costumes into the composition. Through his last period of creativity Alma-Tadema continued to produce paintings which repeated the successful formula of women on marble terraces overlooking the sea such as in &quot;Silver Favourites&quot; (1903). Between 1903 and his death, Alma-Tadema painted less but still produced ambitious paintings such as &quot;The Finding of Moses&quot; (1904).

On 15 August 1909 Alma-Tadema&#x27;s wife, Laura, died at the age of fifty-seven. The grief-stricken widower outlived his second wife by less than three years. His last major composition was &quot;Preparation in the Coliseum&quot; (1912). In the summer of 1912, Alma-Tadema was accompanied by his daughter Anna to Kaiserhof Spa, Wiesbaden, Germany, to be treated for stomach ulcers. He died there on 28 June 1912 at the age of seventy-six. He was buried in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London.

In 1975, a blue plaque was unveiled in his honour. This plaque commemorates Alma-Tadema at 44 Grove End Road, St John&#x27;s Wood, his home from 1886 until his death in 1912.
==Style==

Alma-Tadema&#x27;s works are remarkable for their depiction of flowers, textures and hard reflecting substances like metals, pottery, and especially marble (leading to the nickname &#x27;marbellous painter&#x27;). His work shows much of the fine execution and brilliant colour of the old Dutch masters.

From early in his career, Alma-Tadema was particularly concerned with architectural accuracy, often painting objects from museums, such as the British Museum in London. He also took many images from books and amassed an enormous number of photographs from ancient sites in Italy, which he used to achieve the most precise detail in his painting.

Alma-Tadema was a perfectionist, repeatedly reworking parts of paintings until he found them satisfactory. One story relates that after one of his paintings was rejected, he gave the canvas to a maid for a table cover. He was sensitive to every detail and architectural line in his settings. He would often paint from life, using fresh flowers from across Europe and even Africa, rushing to paint the flowers before they withered. His commitment to veracity earned him recognition, but also led some critics to accuse him of pedantry.

Alma-Tadema&#x27;s work has been linked with that of European Symbolist painters. He influenced European painters such as Gustav Klimt and Fernand Khnopff, who incorporated classical motifs, as well as Alma-Tadema&#x27;s unconventional compositional devices such as abrupt cut-off at the edge of the canvas. Like Alma-Tadema, they also employ coded imagery to suggest hidden meanings.

==Reputation and sale prices==

Alma-Tadema was one of the most popular painters of the Victorian era, and among the most financially successful, though never matching Edwin Henry Landseer. For over sixty years, he gave his audience exactly what they wanted: distinctive, elaborate paintings of beautiful people in classical settings. His detailed reconstructions of ancient Rome, with languid men and women posed against white marble in dazzling sunlight, provided his audience with a glimpse of an exotic world of titillating luxury and intimate drama. 

As with other painters, the reproduction rights for prints were often worth more than the canvas. For example, a painting together with its rights may have been sold to Gambart for £10,000 in 1874; then in 1903, when Alma-Tadema&#x27;s prices were actually higher, it was sold again without rights for £2,625. Typical prices were between £2,000 and £3,000 in the 1880s, but at least three works sold for between £5,250 and £6,060 in the 1900s. Prices held well until the general collapse of the market for Victorian art in the early 1920s, when they fell to the hundreds, where they remained until the 1960s; by 1969 £4,600 had been reached again (equivalent to about £700 in 1900, adjusted for inflation).

The last years of Alma-Tadema&#x27;s life saw the rise of Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Cubism and Futurism, all of which he disapproved. As his pupil John Collier wrote, &#x27;it is impossible to reconcile the art of Alma-Tadema with that of Matisse, Gauguin and Picasso.&#x27; His artistic legacy almost vanished. As the taste of the public and the artistic elite turned to twentieth-century modernism, it became fashionable to denounce his style. John Ruskin declared him &quot;the worst painter of the 19th century&quot;, and one critic considered his paintings &quot;about worthy enough to adorn bourbon boxes&quot;. After this brief period of condemnation, he was consigned to obscurity for the next half century. 

Only since the 1960s has Alma-Tadema&#x27;s work been rediscovered for its historical importance in the evolution of English art. He is now regarded by art historians as one of the principal classical-subject painters of the nineteenth century, whose works demonstrate the care and exactitude of an era mesmerised by trying to visualise the past, some of which was being recovered through archaeological research.

Alma-Tadema&#x27;s highly detailed depictions of Roman life and architecture, based on meticulous archaeological research, led Hollywood directors to his paintings as models for their cinematic ancient world, in films such as D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916), &quot;Ben Hur&quot; (1926), and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1934). The most notable was Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s epic &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956): its co-writer Jesse Lasky Jr. described how the director would spread out prints of Alma-Tadema paintings to guide his set designers. The design of the Oscar-winning Roman epic &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000) took its main inspiration from his paintings, as well as that of the interior of Cair Paravel castle in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; (2005).

In 1962, New York art dealer Robert Isaacson mounted the first show of Alma-Tadema&#x27;s work in fifty years, and by the late 1960s, the revival of interest in Victorian painting gained impetus with a number of well-attended exhibitions. Allen Funt, the creator and host of the American television show &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, was a collector of Alma-Tadema paintings during the 20th century nadir of the artist&#x27;s reputation; in a few years he bought 35 works, about ten per cent of Alma-Tadema&#x27;s output. After Funt was robbed by his accountant, he was forced to sell his collection at Sotheby&#x27;s London in November 1973. 
In 1960, the Newman Gallery was unable to sell, or even give away, one of his most celebrated works, &quot;The Finding of Moses&quot; (1904). The initial purchaser had paid £5,250 in 1904, and subsequent sales were for £861 in 1935, £265 in 1942, and it was &quot;bought in&quot; at £252 in 1960 (having failed to meet its reserve). But when the same picture was auctioned at Christies New York in May 1995, it sold for £1.75 million. On 4 November 2010 it sold for $35,922,500 to an undisclosed bidder at Sotheby&#x27;s New York, a new record for any Victorian artist. On 5 May 2011, the painting &quot;The Meeting of Antony and Cleopatra: 41 BC&quot; was sold at the same house for $29.2 million.

Alma-Tadema&#x27;s &quot;The Tepidarium&quot; (1881) is included in the 2006 book &quot;1001 Paintings You Must See Before You Die&quot;. Julian Treuherz, Keeper of Art Galleries at National Museums Liverpool, describes it as an &quot;exquisitely painted picture... [which] carries a strong erotic charge, rare for a Victorian painting of the nude&quot;.

The Cadbury Research Library at the University of Birmingham holds several archive collections relating to Alma-Tadema, including letters, artwork and photography.

<text>Surrealism is an art and cultural movement that developed in Europe in the aftermath of World War I in which artists aimed to allow the unconscious mind to express itself, often resulting in the depiction of illogical or dreamlike scenes and ideas. Its intention was, according to leader André Breton, to &quot;resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality&quot;, or &quot;surreality.&quot; It produced works of painting, writing, theatre, filmmaking, photography, and other media as well.

Works of Surrealism feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and &quot;non sequitur&quot;. However, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost (for instance, of the &quot;pure psychic automatism&quot; Breton speaks of in the first Surrealist Manifesto), with the works themselves being secondary, i.e., artifacts of surrealist experimentation. Leader Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was, above all, a revolutionary movement. At the time, the movement was associated with political causes such as communism and anarchism. It was influenced by the Dada movement of the 1910s.

The term &quot;Surrealism&quot; originated with Guillaume Apollinaire in 1917. However, the Surrealist movement was not officially established until after October 1924, when the Surrealist Manifesto published by French poet and critic André Breton succeeded in claiming the term for his group over a rival faction led by Yvan Goll, who had published his own surrealist manifesto two weeks prior. The most important center of the movement was Paris, France. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, impacting the visual arts, literature, film, and music of many countries and languages, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy, and social theory.

==Founding of the movement==
The word &quot;surrealism&quot; was first coined in March 1917 by Guillaume Apollinaire. He wrote in a letter to Paul Dermée: &quot;All things considered, I think in fact it is better to adopt surrealism than supernaturalism, which I first used&quot; [&quot;Tout bien examiné, je crois en effet qu&#x27;il vaut mieux adopter surréalisme que surnaturalisme que j&#x27;avais d&#x27;abord employé&quot;].

Apollinaire used the term in his program notes for Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes, &quot;Parade&quot;, which premiered 18 May 1917. &quot;Parade&quot; had a one-act scenario by Jean Cocteau and was performed with music by Erik Satie. Cocteau described the ballet as &quot;realistic&quot;. Apollinaire went further, describing &quot;Parade&quot; as &quot;surrealistic&quot;:

This new alliance—I say new, because until now scenery and costumes were linked only by factitious bonds—has given rise, in &quot;Parade&quot;, to a kind of surrealism, which I consider to be the point of departure for a whole series of manifestations of the New Spirit that is making itself felt today and that will certainly appeal to our best minds. We may expect it to bring about profound changes in our arts and manners through universal joyfulness, for it is only natural, after all, that they keep pace with scientific and industrial progress. (Apollinaire, 1917)

The term was taken up again by Apollinaire, both as subtitle and in the preface to his play &quot;Les Mamelles de Tirésias: Drame surréaliste&quot;, which was written in 1903 and first performed in 1917.

World War I scattered the writers and artists who had been based in Paris, and in the interim, many became involved with Dada, believing that excessive rational thought and bourgeois values had brought the conflict of the war upon the world. The Dadaists protested with anti-art gatherings, performances, writings and art works. After the war, when they returned to Paris, the Dada activities continued.

During the war, André Breton, who had trained in medicine and psychiatry, served in a neurological hospital where he used Sigmund Freud&#x27;s psychoanalytic methods with soldiers suffering from shell-shock. Meeting the young writer Jacques Vaché, Breton felt that Vaché was the spiritual son of writer and pataphysics founder Alfred Jarry. He admired the young writer&#x27;s anti-social attitude and disdain for established artistic tradition. Later Breton wrote, &quot;In literature, I was successively taken with Rimbaud, with Jarry, with Apollinaire, with Nouveau, with Lautréamont, but it is Jacques Vaché to whom I owe the most.&quot;

Back in Paris, Breton joined in Dada activities and started the literary journal &quot;Littérature&quot; along with Louis Aragon and Philippe Soupault. They began experimenting with automatic writing—spontaneously writing without censoring their thoughts—and published the writings, as well as accounts of dreams, in the magazine. Breton and Soupault continued writing evolving their techniques of automatism and published &quot;The Magnetic Fields&quot; (1920).

By October 1924, two rival Surrealist groups had formed to publish a Surrealist Manifesto. Each claimed to be successors of a revolution launched by Appolinaire. One group, led by Yvan Goll consisted of Pierre Albert-Birot, Paul Dermée, Céline Arnauld, Francis Picabia, Tristan Tzara, Giuseppe Ungaretti, Pierre Reverdy, Marcel Arland, Joseph Delteil, Jean Painlevé and Robert Delaunay, among others. The group led by André Breton claimed that automatism was a better tactic for societal change than those of Dada, as led by Tzara, who was now among their rivals. Breton&#x27;s group grew to include writers and artists from various media such as Paul Éluard, Benjamin Péret, René Crevel, Robert Desnos, Jacques Baron, Max Morise, Pierre Naville, Roger Vitrac, Gala Éluard, Max Ernst, Salvador Dalí, Luis Buñuel, Man Ray, Hans Arp, Georges Malkine, Michel Leiris, Georges Limbour, Antonin Artaud, Raymond Queneau, André Masson, Joan Miró, Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Prévert, and Yves Tanguy, Dora Maar

As they developed their philosophy, they believed that Surrealism would advocate the idea that ordinary and depictive expressions are vital and important, but that the sense of their arrangement must be open to the full range of imagination according to the Hegelian Dialectic. They also looked to the Marxist dialectic and the work of such theorists as Walter Benjamin and Herbert Marcuse.

Freud&#x27;s work with free association, dream analysis, and the unconscious was of utmost importance to the Surrealists in developing methods to liberate imagination. They embraced idiosyncrasy, while rejecting the idea of an underlying madness. As Dalí later proclaimed, &quot;There is only one difference between a madman and me. I am not mad.&quot;

Beside the use of dream analysis, they emphasized that &quot;one could combine inside the same frame, elements not normally found together to produce illogical and startling effects.&quot; Breton included the idea of the startling juxtapositions in his 1924 manifesto, taking it in turn from a 1918 essay by poet Pierre Reverdy, which said: &quot;a juxtaposition of two more or less distant realities. The more the relationship between the two juxtaposed realities is distant and true, the stronger the image will be−the greater its emotional power and poetic reality.&quot;

The group aimed to revolutionize human experience, in its personal, cultural, social, and political aspects. They wanted to free people from false rationality, and restrictive customs and structures. Breton proclaimed that the true aim of Surrealism was &quot;long live the social revolution, and it alone!&quot; To this goal, at various times Surrealists aligned with communism and anarchism.

In 1924, two Surrealist factions declared their philosophy in two separate Surrealist Manifestos. That same year the Bureau of Surrealist Research was established and began publishing the journal &quot;La Révolution surréaliste&quot;.

===Surrealist Manifestos===
Leading up to 1924, two rival surrealist groups had formed. Each group claimed to be successors of a revolution launched by Apollinaire. One group, led by Yvan Goll, consisted of Pierre Albert-Birot, Paul Dermée, Céline Arnauld, Francis Picabia, Tristan Tzara, Giuseppe Ungaretti, Pierre Reverdy, Marcel Arland, Joseph Delteil, Jean Painlevé and Robert Delaunay, among others.

The other group, led by Breton, included Aragon, Desnos, Éluard, Baron, Crevel, Malkine, Jacques-André Boiffard and Jean Carrive, among others.

Yvan Goll published the &quot;Manifeste du surréalisme&quot;, 1 October 1924, in his first and only issue of &quot;Surréalisme&quot; two weeks prior to the release of Breton&#x27;s &quot;Manifeste du surréalisme&quot;, published by Éditions du Sagittaire, 15 October 1924.

Goll and Breton clashed openly, at one point literally fighting, at the Comédie des Champs-Élysées, over the rights to the term Surrealism. In the end, Breton won the battle through tactical and numerical superiority. Though the quarrel over the anteriority of Surrealism concluded with the victory of Breton, the history of surrealism from that moment would remain marked by fractures, resignations, and resounding excommunications, with each surrealist having their own view of the issue and goals, and accepting more or less the definitions laid out by André Breton.

Breton&#x27;s 1924 &quot;Surrealist Manifesto&quot; defines the purposes of Surrealism. He included citations of the influences on Surrealism, examples of Surrealist works, and discussion of Surrealist automatism. He provided the following definitions:

==Expansion==
The movement in the mid-1920s was characterized by meetings in cafes where the Surrealists played collaborative drawing games, discussed the theories of Surrealism, and developed a variety of techniques such as automatic drawing. Breton initially doubted that visual arts could even be useful in the Surrealist movement since they appeared to be less malleable and open to chance and automatism. This caution was overcome by the discovery of such techniques as frottage, grattage and decalcomania.

Soon more visual artists became involved, including Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, Joan Miró, Francis Picabia, Yves Tanguy, Salvador Dalí, Luis Buñuel, Alberto Giacometti, Valentine Hugo, Méret Oppenheim, Toyen, and Kansuke Yamamoto. Later, after the second World War, Enrico Donati, Vinicius Pradella and Denis Fabbri became involved as well. Though Breton admired Pablo Picasso and Marcel Duchamp and courted them to join the movement, they remained peripheral. More writers also joined, including former Dadaist Tristan Tzara, René Char, and Georges Sadoul.
In 1925 an autonomous Surrealist group formed in Brussels. The group included the musician, poet, and artist E. L. T. Mesens, painter and writer René Magritte, Paul Nougé, Marcel Lecomte, and André Souris. In 1927 they were joined by the writer Louis Scutenaire. They corresponded regularly with the Paris group, and in 1927 both Goemans and Magritte moved to Paris and frequented Breton&#x27;s circle. The artists, with their roots in Dada and Cubism, the abstraction of Wassily Kandinsky, Expressionism, and Post-Impressionism, also reached to older &quot;bloodlines&quot; or proto-surrealists such as Hieronymus Bosch, and the so-called primitive and naive arts.

André Masson&#x27;s automatic drawings of 1923 are often used as the point of the acceptance of visual arts and the break from Dada, since they reflect the influence of the idea of the unconscious mind. Another example is Giacometti&#x27;s 1925 &quot;Torso&quot;, which marked his movement to simplified forms and inspiration from preclassical sculpture.

 In the second the influence of Miró and the drawing style of Picasso is visible with the use of fluid curving and intersecting lines and colour, whereas the first takes a directness that would later be influential in movements such as Pop art.

Giorgio de Chirico, and his previous development of metaphysical art, was one of the important joining figures between the philosophical and visual aspects of Surrealism. Between 1911 and 1917, he adopted an unornamented depictional style whose surface would be adopted by others later. &quot;The Red Tower (La tour rouge)&quot; from 1913 shows the stark colour contrasts and illustrative style later adopted by Surrealist painters. His 1914 &quot;The Nostalgia of the Poet (La Nostalgie du poète)&quot; has the figure turned away from the viewer, and the juxtaposition of a bust with glasses and a fish as a relief defies conventional explanation. He was also a writer whose novel &quot;Hebdomeros&quot; presents a series of dreamscapes with an unusual use of punctuation, syntax, and grammar designed to create an atmosphere and frame its images. His images, including set designs for the Ballets Russes, would create a decorative form of Surrealism, and he would be an influence on the two artists who would be even more closely associated with Surrealism in the public mind: Dalí and Magritte. He would, however, leave the Surrealist group in 1928.

In 1924, Miró and Masson applied Surrealism to painting. The first Surrealist exhibition, &quot;La Peinture Surrealiste&quot;, was held at Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. It displayed works by Masson, Man Ray, Paul Klee, Miró, and others. The show confirmed that Surrealism had a component in the visual arts (though it had been initially debated whether this was possible), and techniques from Dada, such as photomontage, were used. The following year, on March 26, 1926, Galerie Surréaliste opened with an exhibition by Man Ray. Breton published &quot;Surrealism and Painting&quot; in 1928 which summarized the movement to that point, though he continued to update the work until the 1960s.

===Surrealist literature===

The first Surrealist work, according to leader Breton, was &quot;Les Chants de Maldoror&quot;, and the first work written and published by his group of &quot;Surréalistes&quot; was &quot;Les Champs Magnétiques&quot; (May–June 1919). &quot;Littérature&quot; contained automatist works and accounts of dreams. The magazine and the portfolio both showed their disdain for literal meanings given to objects and focused rather on the undertones; the poetic undercurrents present. Not only did they give emphasis to the poetic undercurrents, but also to the connotations and the overtones which &quot;exist in ambiguous relationships to the visual images.&quot;

Because Surrealist writers seldom, if ever, appear to organize their thoughts and the images they present, some people find much of their work difficult to parse. This notion however is a superficial comprehension, prompted no doubt by Breton&#x27;s initial emphasis on automatic writing as the main route toward a higher reality. But—as in Breton&#x27;s case—much of what is presented as purely automatic is actually edited and very &quot;thought out&quot;. Breton himself later admitted that automatic writing&#x27;s centrality had been overstated, and other elements were introduced, especially as the growing involvement of visual artists in the movement forced the issue, since automatic painting required a rather more strenuous set of approaches. Thus, such elements as collage were introduced, arising partly from an ideal of startling juxtapositions as revealed in Pierre Reverdy&#x27;s poetry. And—as in Magritte&#x27;s case (where there is no obvious recourse to either automatic techniques or collage)—the very notion of convulsive joining became a tool for revelation in and of itself. Surrealism was meant to be always in flux—to be more modern than modern—and so it was natural there should be a rapid shuffling of the philosophy as new challenges arose. Artists such as Max Ernst and his surrealist collages demonstrate this shift to a more modern art form that also comments on society.

Surrealists revived interest in Isidore Ducasse, known by his pseudonym Comte de Lautréamont, and for the line &quot;beautiful as the chance meeting on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella&quot;, and Arthur Rimbaud, two late 19th-century writers believed to be the precursors of Surrealism.

Examples of Surrealist literature are Artaud&#x27;s &quot;Le Pèse-Nerfs&quot; (1926), Aragon&#x27;s &quot;Irene&#x27;s Cunt&quot; (1927), Péret&#x27;s &quot;Death to the Pigs&quot; (1929), Crevel&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Knife Miss Fork&quot; (1931), Sadegh Hedayat&#x27;s &quot;The Blind Owl&quot; (1937), and Breton&#x27;s &quot;Sur la route de San Romano&quot; (1948).

&quot;La Révolution surréaliste&quot; continued publication into 1929 with most pages densely packed with columns of text, but which also included reproductions of art, among them works by de Chirico, Ernst, Masson, and Man Ray. Other works included books, poems, pamphlets, automatic texts and theoretical tracts.

===Surrealist films===

Early films by Surrealists include:
* &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot; by René Clair (1924)
* &quot;The Seashell and the Clergyman&quot; (&quot;&quot;) by Germaine Dulac, scenario by Antonin Artaud (1928)
* &quot;L&#x27;Étoile de mer&quot; by Man Ray (1928)
* &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; by Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí (1929)
* &quot;L&#x27;Âge d&#x27;Or&quot; by Buñuel and Dalí (1930)
* &quot;The Blood of a Poet&quot; (&quot;&quot;) by Jean Cocteau (1930)

=== Surrealist photography ===
Famous Surrealist photographers are the French Dora Maar, the American Man Ray, the French/Hungarian Brassaï, French Claude Cahun and the Dutch Emiel van Moerkerken.

===Surrealist theatre===
The word &quot;surrealist&quot; was first used by Apollinaire to describe his 1917 play &quot;Les Mamelles de Tirésias&quot; (&quot;The Breasts of Tiresias&quot;), which was later adapted into an opera by Francis Poulenc.

Roger Vitrac&#x27;s &quot;The Mysteries of Love&quot; (1927) and &quot;Victor, or The Children Take Over&quot; (1928) are often considered the best examples of Surrealist theatre, despite his expulsion from the movement in 1926. The plays were staged at the Theatre Alfred Jarry, the theatre Vitrac co-founded with Antonin Artaud, another early Surrealist who was expelled from the movement.

Following his collaboration with Vitrac, Artaud would extend Surrealist thought through his theory of the Theatre of Cruelty. Artaud rejected the majority of Western theatre as a perversion of its original intent, which he felt should be a mystical, metaphysical experience. Instead, he envisioned a theatre that would be immediate and direct, linking the unconscious minds of performers and spectators in a sort of ritual event, Artaud created in which emotions, feelings, and the metaphysical were expressed not through language but physically, creating a mythological, archetypal, allegorical vision, closely related to the world of dreams.

The Spanish playwright and director Federico García Lorca, also experimented with surrealism, particularly in his plays &quot;The Public&quot; (1930), &quot;When Five Years Pass&quot; (1931), and &quot;Play Without a Title&quot; (1935). Other surrealist plays include Aragon&#x27;s &quot;Backs to the Wall&quot; (1925). Gertrude Stein&#x27;s opera &quot;Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights&quot; (1938) has also been described as &quot;American Surrealism&quot;, though it is also related to a theatrical form of cubism.

===Surrealist music===

In the 1920s several composers were influenced by Surrealism, or by individuals in the Surrealist movement. Among them were Bohuslav Martinů, André Souris, Erik Satie, Francis Poulenc, and Edgard Varèse, who stated that his work &quot;Arcana&quot; was drawn from a dream sequence. Souris in particular was associated with the movement: he had a long relationship with Magritte, and worked on Paul Nougé&#x27;s publication &quot;Adieu Marie&quot;. Music by composers from across the twentieth century have been associated with surrealist principles, including Pierre Boulez, György Ligeti, Mauricio Kagel, Olivier Messiaen, and Thomas Adès.

Germaine Tailleferre of the French group Les Six wrote several works which could be considered to be inspired by Surrealism, including the 1948 ballet &quot;Paris-Magie&quot; (scenario by Lise Deharme), the operas &quot;La Petite Sirène&quot; (book by Philippe Soupault) and &quot;Le Maître&quot; (book by Eugène Ionesco). Tailleferre also wrote popular songs to texts by Claude Marci, the wife of Henri Jeanson, whose portrait had been painted by Magritte in the 1930s.

Even though Breton by 1946 responded rather negatively to the subject of music with his essay &quot;Silence is Golden&quot;, later Surrealists, such as Paul Garon, have been interested in—and found parallels to—Surrealism in the improvisation of jazz and the blues. Jazz and blues musicians have occasionally reciprocated this interest. For example, the 1976 World Surrealist Exhibition included performances by David &quot;Honeyboy&quot; Edwards.

==Surrealism and international politics==
Surrealism as a political force developed unevenly around the world: in some places more emphasis was on artistic practices, in other places on political practices, and in other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to supersede both the arts and politics. During the 1930s, the Surrealist idea spread from Europe to North America, South America (founding of the &quot;Mandrágora&quot; group in Chile in 1938), Central America, the Caribbean, and throughout Asia, as both an artistic idea and as an ideology of political change.

Politically, Surrealism was Trotskyist, communist, or anarchist. The split from Dada has been characterised as a split between anarchists and communists, with the Surrealists as communist. Breton and his comrades supported Leon Trotsky and his International Left Opposition for a while, though there was an openness to anarchism that manifested more fully after World War II. Some Surrealists, such as Benjamin Péret, Mary Low, and Juan Breá, aligned with forms of left communism. When the Dutch surrealist photographer came to Breton, he did not want to sign the manifesto because he was not a Trotskyist. For Breton being a communist was not enough. Breton denied Van Moerkerken&#x27;s pictures for a publication afterwards. This caused a split in surrealism. Others fought for complete liberty from political ideologies, like Wolfgang Paalen, who, after Trotsky&#x27;s assassination in Mexico, prepared a schism between art and politics through his counter-surrealist art-magazine &quot;DYN&quot; and so prepared the ground for the abstract expressionists. Dalí supported capitalism and the fascist dictatorship of Francisco Franco but cannot be said to represent a trend in Surrealism in this respect; in fact, he was considered, by Breton and his associates, to have betrayed and left Surrealism. Benjamin Péret, Mary Low, Juan Breá, and Spanish-native Eugenio Fernández Granell joined the POUM during the Spanish Civil War.

Breton&#x27;s followers, along with the Communist Party, were working for the &quot;liberation of man&quot;. However, Breton&#x27;s group refused to prioritize the proletarian struggle over radical creation such that their struggles with the Party made the late 1920s a turbulent time for both. Many individuals closely associated with Breton, notably Aragon, left his group to work more closely with the Communists.

Surrealists have often sought to link their efforts with political ideals and activities. In the &quot;Declaration of January 27, 1925&quot;, for example, members of the Paris-based Bureau of Surrealist Research (including Breton, Aragon and Artaud, as well as some two dozen others) declared their affinity for revolutionary politics. While this was initially a somewhat vague formulation, by the 1930s many Surrealists had strongly identified themselves with communism. The foremost document of this tendency within Surrealism is the &quot;Manifesto for a Free Revolutionary Art&quot;, published under the names of Breton and Diego Rivera, but actually co-authored by Breton and Leon Trotsky.

However, in 1933 the Surrealists&#x27; assertion that a &quot;proletarian literature&quot; within a capitalist society was impossible led to their break with the Association des Ecrivains et Artistes Révolutionnaires, and the expulsion of Breton, Éluard and Crevel from the Communist Party.

In 1925, the Paris Surrealist group and the extreme left of the French Communist Party came together to support Abd-el-Krim, leader of the Rif uprising against French colonialism in Morocco. In an open letter to writer and French ambassador to Japan, Paul Claudel, the Paris group announced:

The anticolonial revolutionary and proletarian politics of &quot;Murderous Humanitarianism&quot; (1932) which was drafted mainly by Crevel, signed by Breton, Éluard, Péret, Tanguy, and the Martiniquan Surrealists Pierre Yoyotte and J.M. Monnerot perhaps makes it the original document of what is later called &quot;black Surrealism&quot;, although it is the contact between Aimé Césaire and Breton in the 1940s in Martinique that really lead to the communication of what is known as &quot;black Surrealism&quot;.

Anticolonial revolutionary writers in the Négritude movement of Martinique, a French colony at the time, took up Surrealism as a revolutionary method – a critique of European culture and a radical subjective. This linked with other Surrealists and was very important for the subsequent development of Surrealism as a revolutionary praxis. The journal &quot;Tropiques&quot;, featuring the work of Césaire along with Suzanne Césaire, René Ménil, Lucie Thésée, Aristide Maugée and others, was first published in 1941.

In 1938 André Breton traveled with his wife, the painter Jacqueline Lamba, to Mexico to meet Trotsky (staying as the guest of Diego Rivera&#x27;s former wife Guadalupe Marin), and there he met Frida Kahlo and saw her paintings for the first time. Breton declared Kahlo to be an &quot;innate&quot; Surrealist painter.

===Internal politics===
In 1929 the satellite group associated with the journal &quot;Le Grand Jeu&quot;, including Roger Gilbert-Lecomte, Maurice Henry and the Czech painter Josef Sima, was ostracized. Also in February, Breton asked Surrealists to assess their &quot;degree of moral competence&quot;, and theoretical refinements included in the second &quot;manifeste du surréalisme&quot; excluded anyone reluctant to commit to collective action, a list which included Leiris, Limbour, Morise, Baron, Queneau, Prévert, Desnos, Masson and Boiffard. Excluded members launched a counterattack, sharply criticizing Breton in the pamphlet &quot;Un Cadavre&quot;, which featured a picture of Breton wearing a crown of thorns. The pamphlet drew upon an earlier act of subversion by likening Breton to Anatole France, whose unquestioned value Breton had challenged in 1924.

The disunion of 1929–30 and the effects of &quot;Un Cadavre&quot; had very little negative impact upon Surrealism as Breton saw it, since core figures such as Aragon, Crevel, Dalí and Buñuel remained true to the idea of group action, at least for the time being. The success (or the controversy) of Dalí and Buñuel&#x27;s film &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; in December 1930 had a regenerative effect, drawing a number of new recruits, and encouraging countless new artistic works the following year and throughout the 1930s.

Disgruntled surrealists moved to the periodical &quot;Documents&quot;, edited by Georges Bataille, whose anti-idealist materialism formed a hybrid Surrealism intending to expose the base instincts of humans. To the dismay of many, &quot;Documents&quot; fizzled out in 1931, just as Surrealism seemed to be gathering more steam.

There were a number of reconciliations after this period of disunion, such as between Breton and Bataille, while Aragon left the group after committing himself to the French Communist Party in 1932. More members were ousted over the years for a variety of infractions, both political and personal, while others left in pursuit of their own style.

By the end of World War II, the surrealist group led by André Breton decided to explicitly embrace anarchism. In 1952 Breton wrote &quot;It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself.&quot; Breton was consistent in his support for the francophone Anarchist Federation and he continued to offer his solidarity after the Platformists supporting Fontenis transformed the FA into the Fédération Communiste Libertaire. He was one of the few intellectuals who continued to offer his support to the FCL during the Algerian war when the FCL suffered severe repression and was forced underground. He sheltered Fontenis whilst he was in hiding. He refused to take sides on the splits in the French anarchist movement and both he and Peret expressed solidarity as well with the new Fédération anarchiste set up by the synthesist anarchists and worked in the Antifascist Committees of the 60s alongside the FA.

==Golden age==

Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A Surrealist group developed in London and, according to Breton, their 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Another English Surrealist group developed in Birmingham, meanwhile, and was distinguished by its opposition to the London surrealists and preferences for surrealism&#x27;s French heartland. The two groups would reconcile later in the decade.

Dalí and Magritte created the most widely recognized images of the movement. Dalí joined the group in 1929 and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.

Surrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth; stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, in order to evoke empathy from the viewer.

1931 was a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: Magritte&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Space (La Voix des airs)&quot; is an example of this process, where three large spheres representing bells hang above a landscape. Another Surrealist landscape from this same year is Yves Tanguy&#x27;s &quot;Promontory Palace (Palais promontoire)&quot;, with its molten forms and liquid shapes. Liquid shapes became the trademark of Dalí, particularly in his &quot;The Persistence of Memory&quot;, which features the image of watches that sag as if they were melting.

The characteristics of this style—a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological—came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the modern period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be &quot;made whole with one&#x27;s individuality&quot;.

Between 1930 and 1933, the Surrealist Group in Paris issued the periodical &quot;Le Surréalisme au service de la révolution&quot; as the successor of &quot;La Révolution surréaliste&quot;.

From 1936 through 1938 Wolfgang Paalen, Gordon Onslow Ford, and Roberto Matta joined the group. Paalen contributed Fumage and Onslow Ford Coulage as new pictorial automatic techniques.

Long after personal, political and professional tensions fragmented the Surrealist group, Magritte and Dalí continued to define a visual program in the arts. This program reached beyond painting, to encompass photography as well, as can be seen from a Man Ray self-portrait, whose use of assemblage influenced Robert Rauschenberg&#x27;s collage boxes.

During the 1930s Peggy Guggenheim, an important American art collector, married Max Ernst and began promoting work by other Surrealists such as Yves Tanguy and the British artist John Tunnard.

Major exhibitions in the 1930s
* 1936 – &quot;London International Surrealist Exhibition&quot; is organised in London by the art historian Herbert Read, with an introduction by André Breton.
* 1936 – Museum of Modern Art in New York shows the exhibition &quot;Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism&quot;.
* 1938 – A new &quot;Exposition Internationale du Surréalisme&quot; was held at the Beaux-arts Gallery, Paris, with more than 60 artists from different countries, and showed around 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs and installations. The Surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act and called on Marcel Duchamp, Wolfgang Paalen, Man Ray and others to do so. At the exhibition&#x27;s entrance Salvador Dalí placed his Rainy Taxi (an old taxi rigged to produce a steady drizzle of water down the inside of the windows, and a shark-headed creature in the driver&#x27;s seat and a blond mannequin crawling with live snails in the back) greeted the patrons who were in full evening dress. &quot;Surrealist Street&quot; filled one side of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various Surrealists. Paalen and Duchamp designed the main hall to seem like cave with 1,200 coal bags suspended from the ceiling over a coal brazier with a single light bulb which provided the only lighting, as well as the floor covered with humid leaves and mud. The patrons were given flashlights with which to view the art. On the floor Wolfgang Paalen created a small lake with grasses and the aroma of roasting coffee filled the air. Much to the Surrealists&#x27; satisfaction the exhibition scandalized the viewers.

===World War II and the Post War period===

World War II created havoc not only for the general population of Europe but especially for the European artists and writers that opposed Fascism and Nazism. Many important artists fled to North America and relative safety in the United States. The art community in New York City in particular was already grappling with Surrealist ideas and several artists like Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock, and Robert Motherwell converged closely with the surrealist artists themselves, albeit with some suspicion and reservations. Ideas concerning the unconscious and dream imagery were quickly embraced. By the Second World War, the taste of the American avant-garde in New York swung decisively towards Abstract Expressionism with the support of key taste makers, including Peggy Guggenheim, Leo Steinberg and Clement Greenberg. However, it should not be easily forgotten that Abstract Expressionism itself grew directly out of the meeting of American (particularly New York) artists with European Surrealists self-exiled during World War II. In particular, Gorky and Paalen influenced the development of this American art form, which, as Surrealism did, celebrated the instantaneous human act as the well-spring of creativity. The early work of many Abstract Expressionists reveals a tight bond between the more superficial aspects of both movements, and the emergence (at a later date) of aspects of Dadaistic humor in such artists as Rauschenberg sheds an even starker light upon the connection. Up until the emergence of Pop Art, Surrealism can be seen to have been the single most important influence on the sudden growth in American arts, and even in Pop, some of the humor manifested in Surrealism can be found, often turned to a cultural criticism.

The Second World War overshadowed, for a time, almost all intellectual and artistic production. In 1939 Wolfgang Paalen was the first to leave Paris for the New World as exile. After a long trip through the forests of British Columbia, he settled in Mexico and founded his influential art-magazine Dyn. In 1940 Yves Tanguy married American Surrealist painter Kay Sage. In 1941, Breton went to the United States, where he co-founded the short-lived magazine &quot;VVV&quot; with Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, and the American artist David Hare. However, it was the American poet, Charles Henri Ford, and his magazine &quot;View&quot; which offered Breton a channel for promoting Surrealism in the United States. The &quot;View&quot; special issue on Duchamp was crucial for the public understanding of Surrealism in America. It stressed his connections to Surrealist methods, offered interpretations of his work by Breton, as well as Breton&#x27;s view that Duchamp represented the bridge between early modern movements, such as Futurism and Cubism, to Surrealism. Wolfgang Paalen left the group in 1942 due to political/philosophical differences with Breton.
Though the war proved disruptive for Surrealism, the works continued. Many Surrealist artists continued to explore their vocabularies, including Magritte. Many members of the Surrealist movement continued to correspond and meet. While Dalí may have been excommunicated by Breton, he neither abandoned his themes from the 1930s, including references to the &quot;persistence of time&quot; in a later painting, nor did he become a depictive pompier. His classic period did not represent so sharp a break with the past as some descriptions of his work might portray, and some, such as André Thirion, argued that there were works of his after this period that continued to have some relevance for the movement. When the war reached Ireland with the Belfast Blitz in May 1941, Colin Middleton, who had experimented with surrealist themes in the 1930s, responded with a series of dark works reflecting the shocked state of the people of the city. These were exhibited at the Belfast Municipal Gallery and Museum after its restoration in 1943, following near destruction in the blitz.

During the 1940s Surrealism&#x27;s influence was also felt in England, America and the Netherlands where Gertrude Pape and her husband Theo van Baaren helped to popularize it in their publication The Clean Handkerchief. Mark Rothko took an interest in biomorphic figures, and in England Henry Moore, Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon and Paul Nash used or experimented with Surrealist techniques. However, Conroy Maddox, one of the first British Surrealists whose work in this genre dated from 1935, remained within the movement, and organized an exhibition of current Surrealist work in 1978 in response to an earlier show which infuriated him because it did not properly represent Surrealism. Maddox&#x27;s exhibition, titled &quot;Surrealism Unlimited&quot;, was held in Paris and attracted international attention. He held his last one-man show in 2002, and died three years later. Magritte&#x27;s work became more realistic in its depiction of actual objects, while maintaining the element of juxtaposition, such as in 1951&#x27;s &quot;Personal Values (Les Valeurs Personnelles)&quot; and 1954&#x27;s &quot;Empire of Light (L’Empire des lumières)&quot;. Magritte continued to produce works which have entered artistic vocabulary, such as &quot;Castle in the Pyrenees (Le Château des Pyrénées)&quot;, which refers back to &quot;Voix&quot; from 1931, in its suspension over a landscape.

Other figures from the Surrealist movement were expelled. Several of these artists, like Roberto Matta (by his own description) &quot;remained close to Surrealism&quot;. Frida Kahlo should be mentioned. She had a New York solo exhibition in 1938 with 25 paintings, encouraged by Breton himself.

After the crushing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Endre Rozsda returned to Paris to continue creating his own word that had been transcended the surrealism. The preface to his first exhibition in the Furstenberg Gallery (1957) was written by Breton yet.

Many new artists explicitly took up the Surrealist banner. Dorothea Tanning and Louise Bourgeois continued to work, for example, with Tanning&#x27;s &quot;Rainy Day Canape&quot; from 1970. Duchamp continued to produce sculpture in secret including an installation with the realistic depiction of a woman viewable only through a peephole.

Breton continued to write and espouse the importance of liberating the human mind, as with the publication &quot;The Tower of Light&quot; in 1952. Breton&#x27;s return to France after the War, began a new phase of Surrealist activity in Paris, and his critiques of rationalism and dualism found a new audience. Breton insisted that Surrealism was an ongoing revolt against the reduction of humanity to market relationships, religious gestures and misery and to espouse the importance of liberating the human mind.

Major exhibitions of the 1940s, &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s
* 1942 – &quot;First Papers of Surrealism&quot; – New York – The Surrealists again called on Duchamp to design an exhibition. This time he wove a 3-dimensional web of string throughout the rooms of the space, in some cases making it almost impossible to see the works. He made a secret arrangement with an associate&#x27;s son to bring his friends to the opening of the show, so that when the finely dressed patrons arrived, they found a dozen children in athletic clothes kicking and passing balls and skipping rope. His design for the show&#x27;s catalog included &quot;found&quot;, rather than posed, photographs of the artists.
* 1947 – International Surrealist Exhibition – Galerie Maeght, Paris
* 1959 – International Surrealist Exhibition – Paris
* 1960 – &quot;Surrealist Intrusion in the Enchanters&#x27; Domain&quot; – New York

==Post-Breton Surrealism==

In the 1960s, the artists and writers associated with the Situationist International were closely associated with Surrealism. While Guy Debord was critical of and distanced himself from Surrealism, others, such as Asger Jorn, were explicitly using Surrealist techniques and methods. The events of May 1968 in France included a number of Surrealist ideas, and among the slogans the students spray-painted on the walls of the Sorbonne were familiar Surrealist ones. Joan Miró would commemorate this in a painting titled &quot;May 1968.&quot; There were also groups who associated with both currents and were more attached to Surrealism, such as the Revolutionary Surrealist Group.

During the 1980s, behind the Iron Curtain, Surrealism again entered into politics with an underground artistic opposition movement known as the Orange Alternative. The Orange Alternative was created in 1981 by Waldemar Fydrych (alias &#x27;Major&#x27;), a graduate of history and art history at the University of Wrocław. They used Surrealist symbolism and terminology in their large-scale happenings organized in the major Polish cities during the Jaruzelski regime and painted Surrealist graffiti on spots covering up anti-regime slogans. Major himself was the author of a &quot;Manifesto of Socialist Surrealism&quot;. In this manifesto, he stated that the socialist (communist) system had become so Surrealistic that it could be seen as an expression of art itself.

Surrealistic art also remains popular with museum patrons. The Guggenheim Museum in New York City held an exhibit, &quot;Two Private Eyes&quot;, in 1999, and in 2001 Tate Modern held an exhibition of Surrealist art that attracted over 170,000 visitors. In 2002 the Met in New York City held a show, &quot;Desire Unbound&quot;, and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris a show called &quot;La Révolution surréaliste&quot;.

Surrealist groups and literary publications have continued to be active up to the present day, with groups such as the Chicago Surrealist Group, the Leeds Surrealist Group, and the Surrealist Group of Stockholm. Jan Švankmajer of the Czech-Slovak Surrealists continues to make films and experiment with objects. In Ireland, novelists and poets associated with Surrealism are Tony Bailie, Matthew Geden, Anatoly Kudryavitsky, Afric McGlinchey, Tim Murphy, Ciaran O&#x27;Driscoll, and John W. Sexton. The Dublin-based
&quot;SurVision&quot; online magazine &quot;currently the only international magazine devoted exclusively to surrealist poetry.&quot; Such contemporary avantgardist poets as Sergey Buryukov, Anna Glazova, Tatyana Graus, Dmitry Grigoriev, Anatoly Kudryavitsky, and others representative Surrealism in Russian literature.

==Impact and influences==
While Surrealism is typically associated with the arts, it has impacted many other fields. In this sense, Surrealism does not specifically refer only to self-identified &quot;Surrealists&quot;, or those sanctioned by Breton, rather, it refers to a range of creative acts of revolt and efforts to liberate imagination. In addition to Surrealist theory being grounded in the ideas of Hegel, Marx and Freud, to its advocates its inherent dynamic is dialectical thought. Surrealist artists have also cited the alchemists, Dante, Hieronymus Bosch, the Marquis de Sade, Charles Fourier, Comte de Lautréamont and Arthur Rimbaud as influences.

===May 68===
Surrealists believe that non-Western cultures also provide a continued source of inspiration for Surrealist activity because some may induce a better balance between instrumental reason and imagination in flight than Western culture. Surrealism has had an identifiable impact on radical and revolutionary politics, both directly — as in some Surrealists joining or allying themselves with radical political groups, movements and parties — and indirectly — through the way in which Surrealists emphasize the intimate link between freeing imagination and the mind, and liberation from repressive and archaic social structures. This was especially visible in the New Left of the 1960s and 1970s and the French revolt of May 1968, whose slogan &quot;All power to the imagination&quot; quoted by The Situationists and Enragés from the originally Marxist &quot;&quot;Rêvé&quot;-lutionary&quot; theory and praxis of Breton&#x27;s French Surrealist group.

===Postmodernism and popular culture===
Many significant literary movements in the later half of the 20th century were directly or indirectly influenced by Surrealism. This period is known as the Postmodern era; though there is no widely agreed upon central definition of Postmodernism, many themes and techniques commonly identified as Postmodern are nearly identical to Surrealism.

First Papers of Surrealism presented the fathers of surrealism in an exhibition that represented the leading monumental step of the avant-gardes towards installation art. Many writers from and associated with the Beat Generation were influenced greatly by Surrealists. Philip Lamantia and Ted Joans are often categorized as both Beat and Surrealist writers. Many other Beat writers show significant evidence of Surrealist influence. A few examples include Bob Kaufman, Gregory Corso, Allen Ginsberg, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Artaud in particular was very influential to many of the Beats, but especially Ginsberg and Carl Solomon. Ginsberg cites Artaud&#x27;s &quot;Van Gogh – The Man Suicided by Society&quot; as a direct influence on &quot;Howl&quot;, along with Apollinaire&#x27;s &quot;Zone&quot;, García Lorca&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Walt Whitman&quot;, and Schwitters&#x27; &quot;Priimiititiii&quot;. The structure of Breton&#x27;s &quot;Free Union&quot; had a significant influence on Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Kaddish&quot;. In Paris, Ginsberg and Corso met their heroes Tristan Tzara, Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, and Benjamin Péret, and to show their admiration Ginsberg kissed Duchamp&#x27;s feet and Corso cut off Duchamp&#x27;s tie.

William S. Burroughs, a core member of the Beat Generation and a postmodern novelist, developed the cut-up technique with former surrealist Brion Gysin—in which chance is used to dictate the composition of a text from words cut out of other sources—referring to it as the &quot;Surrealist Lark&quot; and recognizing its debt to the techniques of Tristan Tzara.

Postmodern novelist Thomas Pynchon, who was also influenced by Beat fiction, experimented since the 1960s with the surrealist idea of startling juxtapositions; commenting on the &quot;necessity of managing this procedure with some degree of care and skill&quot;, he added that &quot;any old combination of details will not do. Spike Jones Jr., whose father&#x27;s orchestral recordings had a deep and indelible effect on me as a child, said once in an interview, &#x27;One of the things that people don&#x27;t realize about Dad&#x27;s kind of music is, when you replace a C-sharp with a gunshot, it has to be a C-sharp gunshot or it sounds awful.&#x27;&quot;

Many other postmodern fiction writers have been directly influenced by Surrealism. Paul Auster, for example, has translated Surrealist poetry and said the Surrealists were &quot;a real discovery&quot; for him. Salman Rushdie, when called a Magical Realist, said he saw his work instead &quot;allied to surrealism&quot;. David Lynch regarded as a surrealist filmmaker being quoted, &quot;David Lynch has once again risen to the spotlight as a champion of surrealism,&quot; in regard to his show &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. For the work of other postmodernists, such as Donald Barthelme and Robert Coover, a broad comparison to Surrealism is common.

Magic realism, a popular technique among novelists of the latter half of the 20th century especially among Latin American writers, has some obvious similarities to Surrealism with its juxtaposition of the normal and the dream-like, as in the work of Gabriel García Márquez. Carlos Fuentes was inspired by the revolutionary voice in Surrealist poetry and points to inspiration Breton and Artaud found in Fuentes&#x27; homeland, Mexico. Though Surrealism was a direct influence on Magic Realism in its early stages, many Magic Realist writers and critics, such as Amaryll Chanady and S. P. Ganguly, while acknowledging the similarities, cite the many differences obscured by the direct comparison of Magic Realism and Surrealism such as an interest in psychology and the artefacts of European culture they claim is not present in Magic Realism. A prominent example of a Magic Realist writer who points to Surrealism as an early influence is Alejo Carpentier who also later criticized Surrealism&#x27;s delineation between real and unreal as not representing the true South American experience.

===Surrealist groups===
Surrealist individuals and groups have carried on with Surrealism after the death of André Breton in 1966. The original Paris Surrealist Group was disbanded by member Jean Schuster in 1969, but another Parisian surrealist group was later formed. The current Surrealist Group of Paris has recently published the first issue of their new journal, &quot;Alcheringa&quot;. The Group of Czech-Slovak Surrealists never disbanded, and continue to publish their journal &quot;Analogon&quot;, which now spans almost 100 volumes.

===Surrealism and the theatre===
Surrealist theatre and Artaud&#x27;s &quot;Theatre of Cruelty&quot; were inspirational to many within the group of playwrights that the critic Martin Esslin called the &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot; (in his 1963 book of the same name). Though not an organized movement, Esslin grouped these playwrights together based on some similarities of theme and technique; Esslin argues that these similarities may be traced to an influence from the Surrealists. Eugène Ionesco in particular was fond of Surrealism, claiming at one point that Breton was one of the most important thinkers in history. Samuel Beckett was also fond of Surrealists, even translating much of the poetry into English. Other notable playwrights whom Esslin groups under the term, for example Arthur Adamov and Fernando Arrabal, were at some point members of the Surrealist group.

Alice Farley is an American-born artist who became active during the 1970s in San Francisco after training in dance at the California Institute of the Arts. Farley uses vivid and elaborate costuming that she describes as &quot;the vehicles of transformation capable of making a character&#x27;s thoughts visible&quot;. Often collaborating with musicians such as Henry Threadgill, Farley explores the role of improvisation in dance, bringing in an automatic aspect to the productions. Farley has performed in a number of surrealist collaborations including the World Surrealist Exhibition in Chicago in 1976.

==Alleged precursors in older art==
Various much older artists are sometimes claimed as precursors of Surrealism. Foremost among these are Hieronymus Bosch and Giuseppe Arcimboldo, whom Dalí called the &quot;father of Surrealism.&quot; Apart from their followers, other artists who may be mentioned in this context include Joos de Momper, for some anthropomorphic landscapes. Many critics feel these works belong to fantastic art rather than having a significant connection with Surrealism.

<doc id="28767" wikidata="Q169019" url="?curid=28767" title="Statics">
<text>Statics is the branch of classical mechanics that is concerned with the analysis of force and torque acting on a physical system that does not experience an acceleration, but rather is in equilibrium with its environment. 

If formula_1 is the total of the forces acting on the system, formula_2 is the mass of the system and formula_3 is the acceleration of the system, Newton&#x27;s second law states that formula_4 (the bold font indicates a vector quantity, i.e. one with both magnitude and direction). If formula_5, then formula_6. As for a system in static equilibrium, the acceleration equals zero, the system is either at rest, or its center of mass moves at constant velocity. 

The application of the assumption of zero acceleration to the summation of moments acting on the system leads to formula_7, where formula_8 is the summation of all moments acting on the system, formula_9 is the moment of inertia of the mass and formula_10 is the angular acceleration of the system. For a system where formula_11, it is also true that formula_12

Together, the equations formula_13 (the &#x27;first condition for equilibrium&#x27;) and formula_7 (the &#x27;second condition for equilibrium&#x27;) can be used to solve for unknown quantities acting on the system.

==History==
Archimedes (c. 287–c. 212 BC) did pioneering work in statics.
Later developments in the field of statics are found in works of Thebit.

==Background==

===Force===
&quot;Force&quot; is the action of one body on another. A force is either a push or a pull, and it tends to move a body in the direction of its action. The action of a force is characterized by its magnitude, by the direction of its action, and by its &quot;point of application&quot; (or &quot;point of contact&quot;). Thus, force is a vector quantity, because its effect depends on the direction as well as on the magnitude of the action.

Forces are classified as either contact or body forces. A contact force is produced by direct physical contact; an example is the force exerted on a body by a supporting surface. A body force is generated by virtue of the position of a body within a force field such as a gravitational, electric, or magnetic field and is independent of contact with any other body; an example of a body force is the weight of a body in the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field.

===Moment of a force===
In addition to the tendency to move a body in the direction of its application, a force can also tend to rotate a body about an axis. The axis may be any line which neither intersects nor is parallel to the line of action of the force. This rotational tendency is known as &quot;moment of force&quot; (M). Moment is also referred to as &quot;torque&quot;.

====Moment about a point====

The magnitude of the moment of a force at a point &quot;O&quot;, is equal to the perpendicular distance from &quot;O&quot; to the line of action of &quot;F&quot;, multiplied by the magnitude of the force: , where

: &quot;F&quot; = the force applied
: &quot;d&quot; = the perpendicular distance from the axis to the line of action of the force. This perpendicular distance is called the moment arm.

The direction of the moment is given by the right hand rule, where counter clockwise (CCW) is out of the page, and clockwise (CW) is into the page. The moment direction may be accounted for by using a stated sign convention, such as a plus sign (+) for counterclockwise moments and a minus sign (−) for clockwise moments, or vice versa. Moments can be added together as vectors.

In vector format, the moment can be defined as the cross product between the radius vector, r (the vector from point O to the line of action), and the force vector, F:

:formula_15
:formula_16
:formula_17

====Varignon&#x27;s theorem====
&quot;Varignon&#x27;s theorem&quot; states that the moment of a force about any point is equal to the sum of the moments of the components of the force about the same point.

===Equilibrium equations===
The static equilibrium of a particle is an important concept in statics. A particle is in equilibrium only if the resultant of all forces acting on the particle is equal to zero. In a rectangular coordinate system the equilibrium equations can be represented by three scalar equations, where the sums of forces in all three directions are equal to zero. An engineering application of this concept is determining the tensions of up to three cables under load, for example the forces exerted on each cable of a hoist lifting an object or of guy wires restraining a hot air balloon to the ground.

===Moment of inertia===
In classical mechanics, &quot;moment of inertia&quot;, also called mass moment, rotational inertia, polar moment of inertia of mass, or the angular mass, (SI units kg·m²) is a measure of an object&#x27;s resistance to changes to its rotation. It is the inertia of a rotating body with respect to its rotation. The moment of inertia plays much the same role in rotational dynamics as mass does in linear dynamics, describing the relationship between angular momentum and angular velocity, torque and angular acceleration, and several other quantities. The symbols I and J are usually used to refer to the moment of inertia or polar moment of inertia.

While a simple scalar treatment of the moment of inertia suffices for many situations, a more advanced tensor treatment allows the analysis of such complicated systems as spinning tops and gyroscopic motion.

The concept was introduced by Leonhard Euler in his 1765 book &quot;Theoria motus corporum solidorum seu rigidorum&quot;; he discussed the moment of inertia and many related concepts, such as the principal axis of inertia.

==Applications==

===Solids===
Statics is used in the analysis of structures, for instance in architectural and structural engineering. &quot;Strength of materials&quot; is a related field of mechanics that relies heavily on the application of static equilibrium. A key concept is the center of gravity of a body at rest: it represents an imaginary point at which all the mass of a body resides. The position of the point relative to the foundations on which a body lies determines its stability in response to external forces. If the center of gravity exists outside the foundations, then the body is unstable because there is a torque acting: any small disturbance will cause the body to fall or topple. If the center of gravity exists within the foundations, the body is stable since no net torque acts on the body. If the center of gravity coincides with the foundations, then the body is said to be metastable.

===Fluids===
&quot;Hydrostatics&quot;, also known as &quot;fluid statics&quot;, is the study of fluids at rest (i.e. in static equilibrium). The characteristic of any fluid at rest is that the force exerted on any particle of the fluid is the same at all points at the same depth (or altitude) within the fluid. If the net force is greater than zero the fluid will move in the direction of the resulting force. This concept was first formulated in a slightly extended form by French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal in 1647 and became known as Pascal&#x27;s Law. It has many important applications in hydraulics. Archimedes, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī, Al-Khazini and Galileo Galilei were also major figures in the development of hydrostatics.

<doc id="28769" wikidata="Q155930" url="?curid=28769" title="Maritime transport">
<text>Maritime transport (or ocean transport) or more generally waterborne transport, is the transport of people (passengers) or goods (cargo) via waterways. Freight transport by sea has been widely used throughout recorded history. The advent of aviation has diminished the importance of sea travel for passengers, though it is still popular for short trips and pleasure cruises. Transport by water is cheaper than transport by air or ground, but significantly slower for longer distances. Maritime transport accounts for roughly 80% of international trade, according to UNCTAD in 2020.

Maritime transport can be realized over any distance by boat, ship, sailboat or barge, over oceans and lakes, through canals or along rivers. Shipping may be for commerce, recreation, or military purposes. While extensive inland shipping is less critical today, the major waterways of the world including many canals are still very important and are integral parts of worldwide economies. Particularly, especially any material can be moved by water; however, water transport becomes impractical when material delivery is time-critical such as various types of perishable produce. Still, water transport is highly cost effective with regular schedulable cargoes, such as trans-oceanic shipping of consumer products – and especially for heavy loads or bulk cargos, such as coal, coke, ores, or grains. Arguably, the Industrial Revolution had its first impacts where cheap water transport by canal, navigations, or shipping by all types of watercraft on natural waterways supported cost-effective bulk transport.

Containerization revolutionized maritime transport starting in the 1970s. &quot;General cargo&quot; includes goods packaged in boxes, cases, pallets, and barrels. When a cargo is carried in more than one mode, it is intermodal or co-modal.

== Description ==
A nation&#x27;s shipping fleet (variously called merchant navy, merchant marine, or merchant fleet) consists of the ships operated by civilian crews to transport passengers or cargo from one place to another. Merchant shipping also includes water transport over the river and canal systems connecting inland destinations, large and small. For example, during the early modern era, cities in the Hanseatic League began taming Northern Europe&#x27;s rivers and harbors. Similarly, the Saint Lawrence Seaway connects the port cities on the Great Lakes in Canada and the United States with the Atlantic Ocean shipping routes, while the various Illinois canals connect the Great Lakes and Canada with New Orleans. Ores, coal, and grains can travel along the rivers of the American Midwest to Pittsburgh or to Birmingham, Alabama. Professional mariners are known as merchant seamen, merchant sailors, and merchant mariners, or simply seamen, sailors, or mariners. The terms &quot;seaman&quot; or &quot;sailor&quot; may also refer to a member of a country&#x27;s martial navy.

According to the 2005 CIA World Factbook, the total number of merchant ships of at least 1,000 gross register tons in the world was 30,936. In 2010, it was 38,988, an increase of 26%, across many countries. , a quarter of all merchant mariners were born in the Philippines.

=== Liners and tramps ===
A ship may also be categorized as to how it is operated.
* A liner will have a regular run and operate to a schedule. The scheduled operation requires that such ships are better equipped to deal with causes of potential delay such as bad weather. They are generally higher powered than tramp ships with better seakeeping qualities, thus they are significantly more expensive to build. Liners are typically built for passenger and container operation though past common uses also included mail and general cargo.
* A tramp (trader) has no fixed run but will go wherever a suitable cargo takes it. Thus a ship and crew may be chartered from the ship owner to fetch a cargo of grain from Canada to Latvia, the ship may then be required to carry a cargo of coal from Britain to Melanesia. Bulk carriers and some cruise ships are examples of ships built to operate in this manner.

=== Ships and watercraft ===

Ships and other watercraft are used for maritime transport. Types can be distinguished by propulsion, size or cargo type. Recreational or educational craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use internal combustion engines to drive one or more propellers, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet. In shallow-draft areas, such as the Everglades, some craft, such as the hovercraft, are propelled by large pusher-prop fans.

Most modern merchant ships can be placed in one of a few categories, such as:
=== Typical in-transit times ===
A cargo ship sailing from a European port to a US one will typically take 10–12 days depending on water currents and other factors. In order to make container ship transport more economical, ship operators sometimes reduce cruising speed, thereby increasing transit time, to reduce fuel consumption, a strategy referred to as &quot;slow steaming&quot;.

==History==

==Professional mariners==
A ship&#x27;s complement can be divided into four categories: 
# The deck department
# The engine department
# The steward&#x27;s department
# Other.

===Deck department===

 Officer positions in the deck department include but not limited to the Master and his Chief, Second, and Third officers. The official classifications for unlicensed members of the deck department are Able Seaman and Ordinary Seaman.

A common deck crew for a ship includes:
* (1) Chief Officer/Chief Mate
* (1) Second Officer/Second Mate
* (1) Third Officer/Third Mate
* (1) Boatswain
* (2–6) Able Seamen
* (0–2) Ordinary Seamen

A deck cadet is a person who is carrying out mandatory sea time to achieve their officer of the watch certificate. Their time on board is spent learning the operations and tasks of everyday life on a merchant vessel.

===Engine department===

A ship&#x27;s engine department consists of the members of a ship&#x27;s crew that operate and maintain the propulsion and other systems on board the vessel. Engine staff also deal with the &quot;Hotel&quot; facilities on board, notably the sewage, lighting, air conditioning and water systems. They deal with bulk fuel transfers, and require training in firefighting and first aid, as well as in dealing with the ship&#x27;s boats and other nautical tasks- especially with cargo loading/discharging gear and safety systems, though the specific cargo discharge function remains the responsibility of deck officers and deck workers. On LPG and LNG tankers, however, a cargo engineer works with the deck department during cargo operations, as well as being a watchkeeping engineer.

A common engine crew for a ship includes:
* (1) Chief engineer
* (1) Second engineer / first assistant engineer
* (1) Third engineer / second assistant engineer
* (1 or 2) Fourth engineer / third assistant engineer
* (0–2) Fifth engineer / junior engineer
* (1–3) Oiler (unlicensed qualified rating)
* (0–3) Greaser (unlicensed qualified rating)
* (1–5) Entry-level rating (such as wiper (occupation), utilityman, etc.)

Many American ships also carry a motorman. Other possible positions include machinist, electrician, refrigeration engineer, and tankerman. Engine cadets are engineer trainees who are completing sea time necessary before they can obtain a watchkeeping license.

===Steward&#x27;s department===

A typical steward&#x27;s department for a cargo ship would be composed of a Chief Steward, a chief cook, and a Steward&#x27;s Assistant. All three positions are typically filled by unlicensed personnel. The chief steward directs, instructs, and assigns personnel performing such functions as preparing and serving meals; cleaning and maintaining officers&#x27; quarters and steward department areas; and receiving, issuing, and inventorying stores. On large passenger vessels, the Catering Department is headed by the Chief Purser and managed by Assistant Pursers. Although they enjoy the benefits of having officer rank, they generally progress through the ranks to become pursers. Under the pursers are the department heads – such as chief cook, head waiter, head barman etc. They are responsible for the administration of their own areas.

The chief steward also plans menus and compiles supply, overtime, and cost control records. They may requisition or purchase stores and equipment. They may bake bread, rolls, cakes, pies, and pastries. A chief steward&#x27;s duties may overlap with those of the Steward&#x27;s Assistant, the chief cook, and other Steward&#x27;s Department crewmembers.

In the United States Merchant Marine, a chief steward must have a Merchant Mariner&#x27;s Document issued by the United States Coast Guard. Because of international law, conventions, and agreements, all chief cooks who sail internationally are similarly documented by their respective countries.

===Other departments===
Staff officer positions on a ship, including Junior Assistant Purser, Senior Assistant Purser, Purser, Chief Purser, Medical Doctor, Professional Nurse, Marine Physician Assistant, and hospital corpsman, are considered administrative positions and are therefore regulated by Certificates of Registry issued by the United States Coast Guard. Pilots are also merchant marine officers and are licensed by the Coast Guard. Formerly, there was also a radio department, headed by a chief radio officer and supported by a number of radio officers. Since the introduction of GMDSS (Satellite communications) and the subsequent exemptions from carrying radio officers if the vessel is so equipped, this department has fallen away, although many ships do still carry specialist radio officers, particularly passenger vessels. Many radio officers became &#x27;electro-technical officers&#x27;, and transferred into the engine department.

===Life at sea===
Mariners spend much of their life beyond the reach of land. They sometimes face dangerous conditions at sea or on lakes – the fishing port of Gloucester, Massachusetts has a seaside memorial listing over 10,000 fishermen who lost their lives to the sea, and the Great Lakes have seen over 10,000 lost vessels since the 1800s, yet men and women still go to sea. For some, the attraction is a life unencumbered with the restraints of life ashore. Seagoing adventure and a chance to see the world also appeal to many seafarers. Whatever the calling, those who live and work at sea invariably confront social isolation.

Findings by the Seafarer&#x27;s International Research Center indicate a leading cause of mariners leaving the industry is &quot;almost invariably because they want to be with their families.&quot; U.S. merchant ships typically do not allow family members to accompany seafarers on voyages. Industry experts increasingly recognize isolation, stress, and fatigue as occupational hazards. Advocacy groups such as International Labour Organization, a United Nations agency, and the Nautical Institute are seeking improved international standards for mariners. Satellite phones have improved communication and efficiency aboard sea-faring ships. This technology has contributed to crew welfare, although both equipment and fees are expensive.

Ocean voyages are steeped in routine. Maritime tradition dictates that each day be divided into six four-hour periods. Three groups of watch keepers from the engine and deck departments work four hours on then have eight hours off watch keeping. However, there are many overtime jobs to be done daily. This cycle repeats endlessly, 24 hours a day while the ship is at sea. Members of the steward department typically are day workers who put in at least eight-hour shifts. Operations at sea, including repairs, safeguarding against piracy, securing cargo, underway replenishment, and other duties provide opportunities for overtime work. Service aboard ships typically extends for months at a time, followed by protracted shore leave. However, some seamen secure jobs on ships they like and stay aboard for years.

The quick turnaround of many modern ships, spending only a few hours in port, limits a seafarer&#x27;s free-time ashore. Moreover, some foreign seamen entering U.S. ports from a watch list of 25 countries face restrictions on shore leave due to maritime security concerns. However, shore leave restrictions while in U.S. ports impact American seamen as well. For example, the International Organization of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots notes a trend of U.S. shipping terminal operators restricting seamen from traveling from the ship to the terminal gate. Furthermore, in cases where transit is allowed, special &quot;security fees&quot; are at times assessed.

Such restrictions on shore leave, coupled with reduced time in port, translate into longer periods at sea. Mariners report that extended periods at sea living and working with shipmates, who for the most part are strangers, takes getting used to. At the same time, there is an opportunity to meet people from other ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Recreational opportunities have improved aboard some U.S. ships, which may feature gyms and day rooms for watching movies, swapping sea stories, and other activities. And in some cases, especially tankers, it is possible for a mariner to be accompanied by members of his family. However, a mariner&#x27;s off-duty time is largely a solitary affair, pursuing hobbies, reading, writing letters, and sleeping.

On modern ocean-going vessels, typically registered with a flag of convenience, life has changed immensely in the last 20 years. Most large vessels include a gym and often a swimming pool for use by the crew. Since the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; incident, the focus of leisure time activity has shifted from having officer and crew bars, to simply having lounge-style areas where officers or crew can sit to watch movies. With many companies now providing TVs and DVD players in cabins, and enforcing strict smoking policies, it is not surprising that the bar is now a much quieter place on most ships. In some instances games consoles are provided for the officers and crew. The officers enjoy a much higher standard of living on board ocean-going vessels.

Crews are generally poorly paid, poorly qualified and have to complete contracts of approximately 9 months before returning home on leave. They often come from countries where the average industrial wage is still very low, such as the Philippines or India. Officers however, come from all over the world and it is not uncommon to mix the nationality of the officers on board ships. Officers are often the recipients of university degrees and have completed vast amounts of training in order to reach their rank. Officers benefit e.g. by having larger, more comfortable cabins and table service for their meals.

Contracts average at the 4 month mark for officers, with generous leave. Most ocean-going vessels now operate an unmanned engine room system allowing engineers to work days only. The engine room is computer controlled by night, although the duty engineer will make inspections during unmanned operation. Engineers work in a hot, humid, noisy atmosphere. Communication in the engine room is therefore by hand signals and lip-reading, and good teamwork often stands in place of any communication at all.

== Environmental impact ==

The environmental impact of shipping includes greenhouse gas emissions, acoustic, and oil pollution. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) estimates that Carbon dioxide emissions from shipping were equal to 2.2% of the global human-made emissions in 2012 and expects them to rise 50 to 250 percent by 2050 if no action is taken. The IEA forecasts that ammonia will meet approximately 45% of shipping fuel demands by 2050.

== Infrastructure ==

For a port to efficiently send and receive cargo, it requires infrastructure: docks, bollards, pilings, cranes, bulk cargo handling equipment, and so on – equipment and organization supporting the role of the facilities. From pier to pier these may differ, one dock handling intermodal transport needs (container-ships linked to rail by cranes); another bulk handling capabilities (such as conveyors, elevators, tanks, pumps) for loading and unloading bulk cargoes like grain, coal, or fuels. Others may be outfitted as passenger terminals or for mixed mode operations.

Generally, Harbors, seaports and marinas all host watercraft, and consist of components such as piers, wharfs, docks and roadsteads.

<text>St. John&#x27;s () is the largest city of Antigua and Barbuda. It is located in the western part of Antigua, surrounding St. John&#x27;s Harbour. The city is Antigua and Barbuda&#x27;s primate city, having a population of 22,219. St. John&#x27;s also tends to dominate the parish of Saint John, which composes much of the city&#x27;s metropolitan area. From its establishment after the French invasion in 1666, the city has rapidly grown, eventually replacing Falmouth as the island&#x27;s dominant city. 

After its establishment, St. John&#x27;s became an official trading point in 1675. By 1689, St. John&#x27;s had overtaken Falmouth in population. St. John&#x27;s continued to grow throughout the 1700s, occasionally being impacted by a fire or hurricane. St. John&#x27;s has largely been spared from armed conflict, although a large-scale slave revolt was planned in the city in 1736. 

St. John&#x27;s is not necessarily a tourist destination, as it primarily functions as the country&#x27;s economic centre. St. John&#x27;s is home to Antigua State College, the country&#x27;s largest higher education institution, and an open campus of the University of the West Indies. St. John&#x27;s is attempting to modernise its economy, being home to many convention centres and contemporary office buildings. St. John&#x27;s is also home to the national library and most government agencies. St. John&#x27;s is the origin of the All Saints Road corridor, in which most of the country&#x27;s population lives. While St. John&#x27;s completely dominates its metropolitan area, the city&#x27;s economy has stimulated that of surrounding areas like Piggotts and Cedar Valley.

== History ==
St. John&#x27;s was laid out following the French invasion of 1666, due to the site&#x27;s strategic location on St. John&#x27;s Harbour. An act was passed to build a town on the harbour in April 1668. On 16 September 1675, a sitting of the island’s legislature in Old Road established six places of trade, one of which being St. John’s. This was a significant increase from the traditional two. By 1689, St. John’s was as large as Falmouth. The remainder of the 1600s were largely peaceful, until 7 December 1710. On that date, Daniel Parke was killed after much of his assembly had nearly been expelled from St. John&#x27;s to Parham. In 1736, a plan by St. John&#x27;s resident Prince Klaas to turn Antigua into an independent African kingdom was discovered, resulting in him being killed. 132 other co-conspirators were also punished. The plot caused a large scare, and in 1741, barracks were built on Rat Island, and in 1753, in the centre of the town.

In 1768, the city was hit by a major fire. By this time, St. John&#x27;s was also the seat of government of the British Leeward Islands, a title it maintained until the colony&#x27;s permanent abolishment in 1959. In 1772 the island was hit by a hurricane, resulting in significant damage to the city&#x27;s shipping industry. In 1782, the city was again damaged by a fire that occurred in one of the most densely populated parts of the city. In 1784, the city&#x27;s night watch was established, and citizens of the city were subjected to a tax to pay for it. To prevent another fire, building regulations were also improved, with most public buildings being required to have brick walls and tiled or slate roofs. In 1786, another tax was established due to the prevalence of vermin, reptiles, prickly pear bushes lining the streets. The roads were also not paved at the time, nor were they kept clean. Gaming tables were also outlawed. In 1790, the parish vestry was granted the ability to tax traders, which impacted the city due to it being the parish&#x27;s economic centre. In the early 1800s, the present-day Government House was built.

During the late 1800s and early 1900s, St. John&#x27;s once had an elected city council. The council no longer exists, and there is no longer a city-wide local government. In Downtown St. John&#x27;s, the St. John&#x27;s Development Corporation continues to handle a degree local government. St. John&#x27;s is now the country&#x27;s primate city, being home to around a quarter of its population, and about half of the population of the parish. St. John&#x27;s was once home to an airstrip in the 1940s at the Old Runway area of Villa, but is now served by V. C. Bird International Airport.

While no law explicitly states St. John&#x27;s is the island&#x27;s capital, the city is home to the Government Complex in the Botanical Gardens neighbourhood, which is home to the High Court, the Office of the Prime Minister, and the Parliament Building. The Parliament building was opened in 2006. The Labour Party largely dominates the city&#x27;s politics, carrying the city in the 2023 election.

==Geography and climate==
Nearby villages and settlements include St. Johnston. McKinnon&#x27;s Pond is located just north of St. John&#x27;s.

St. John&#x27;s has a Tropical savanna climate (Koppen: Aw) with summer-like weather year-round, with hot days and warm nights. Rainfall is at its highest during the months of September to November due to hurricane activity. On 12 August 1995, a temperature of was recorded, which was the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Antigua and Barbuda.

==Economy==
St. John&#x27;s is one of the most developed and cosmopolitan municipalities in the Lesser Antilles. The city is famous for its shopping malls as well as boutiques throughout the city, selling designer jewellery and haute-couture clothing.

St. John&#x27;s attracts tourists from the resorts on the island and from the cruise ships which dock in its harbour at Heritage Quay and Redcliffe Quay several times a week.

The investment banking industry has a strong presence in the city. Major world financial institutions have offices in St. John&#x27;s.

There is a market on the southwestern edge of the city where fresh produce, meats, and fresh fish are sold daily.

The Antigua Rum Distillery is located at the Citadel and is the only rum distillery on the island. 


==Government==

St John&#x27;s is the home of the Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda. St John&#x27;s is the capital of the Parish of Saint John.

The Eastern Caribbean Civil Aviation Authority has its headquarters on Factory Road in St. John&#x27;s.

St John&#x27;s is twinned with Waltham Forest borough in London, England.

The current Executive Director of the city centre is Craig B. Whyte, while the current City Manager is Carolyn Thomas-Parker.

==Landmarks==
There are several museums, including the Museum of Antigua and Barbuda and the Museum of Marine Art, a small facility containing fossilised bedrock, volcanic stones, petrified wood, a collection of more than 10,000 shells, and artefacts from English shipwrecks.
Just east of St. John&#x27;s is the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, a multi-use stadium in North Sound, that was created mostly for cricket matches, and has hosted the matches during the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The Antigua Recreation Ground, Antigua and Barbuda&#x27;s national stadium, is located in St. John&#x27;s.
The city&#x27;s skyline is dominated by the white baroque towers of St. John&#x27;s Cathedral.

The Botanical Garden is near the intersection of Factory Road and Independence Avenue. This small park&#x27;s shaded benches and gazebo provide a quiet refuge from the bustle of activity of St. John&#x27;s.

Sandy Island is a lighthouse located on a small island about 5 km off the coast leading the way to St. John&#x27;s harbour.

Fort James stands at the entrance to St. John&#x27;s harbour, across from Fort Barrington. Other fortifications on the island include Fort Berkeley, Fort George, Fort Charles, and Fort Shirley (Shirley Heights).

Government House is the governor&#x27;s residence, originally a 19th-century parsonage building. It is included on the World Monuments Fund&#x27;s 2018 list of monuments at risk, following exposure to severe weather events.

==Education==
St. John&#x27;s is home to two medical schools – the American University of Antigua and University of Health Sciences Antigua. Secondary schools include Christ the King High School, Princess Margaret School and the Antigua Girls High School. Private grade schools include St. John&#x27;s Lutheran School of the WELS
==Transportation==

St. John&#x27;s is served by the V. C. Bird International Airport.

<doc id="28779" wikidata="Q216915" url="?curid=28779" title="Sigtuna Municipality">
<text>Sigtuna Municipality (&quot;Sigtuna kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Stockholm County, Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Märsta, approximately north of the Swedish capital, Stockholm. The municipality is a part of Metropolitan Stockholm.

The municipality consists of several former local government units and was formed in 1971. It got its name from the small, but very old, &quot;City of Sigtuna&quot;, but the seat was placed in the larger modern town of Märsta. The three towns of the municipality are Märsta (pop. 23,000), Sigtuna (pop. 8,000) and Rosersberg (pop. 1,400), of which Märsta is the municipal seat and Sigtuna with its old and important history is a popular tourist destination.

Sigtuna Municipality is also home to Stockholm Arlanda Airport, the main airport serving Stockholm, and the largest airport in Sweden.

==Demography==
===Population development===
===2022 population by district===
This is a demographic table based on Sigtuna Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

There were 50,180 residents, including 33,030 Swedish citizens of voting age. 42.5% voted for the left coalition and 54.6% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Industry==

In the municipality lies the largest workplace in Sweden, the Arlanda Airport, with 13,000 employees in 200 companies. As a result, Sigtuna is travelled through by 18,300,000 visitors yearly, and has the fourth most hotel stays, following to the commercial and regional centres Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö.

Swedavia, the Swedish airport management company, has its head office on the airport property. Scandinavian Airlines previously had its head office on the airport property.

==International relations==
===Twin towns – Sister cities===
The municipality is twinned with:

* Sønderborg Municipality in Denmark
* Rakvere in Estonia
* Raisio in Finland
* Porsgrunn in Norway

<doc id="28782" wikidata="Q262372" url="?curid=28782" title="Self-similarity">
<text>In mathematics, a self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself (i.e., the whole has the same shape as one or more of the parts). Many objects in the real world, such as coastlines, are statistically self-similar: parts of them show the same statistical properties at many scales. Self-similarity is a typical property of fractals. Scale invariance is an exact form of self-similarity where at any magnification there is a smaller piece of the object that is similar to the whole. For instance, a side of the Koch snowflake is both symmetrical and scale-invariant; it can be continually magnified 3x without changing shape. The non-trivial similarity evident in fractals is distinguished by their fine structure, or detail on arbitrarily small scales. As a counterexample, whereas any portion of a straight line may resemble the whole, further detail is not revealed.

A time developing phenomenon is said to exhibit self-similarity if the numerical value of certain observable quantity 
formula_1 measured at different times are different but the corresponding dimensionless quantity at given value of formula_2 remain invariant. It happens if the quantity formula_1 exhibits dynamic scaling. The idea is just an extension of the idea of similarity of two triangles. Note that two triangles are similar if the numerical values of their sides are different however the corresponding dimensionless quantities, such as their angles, coincide.

Peitgen &quot;et al.&quot; explain the concept as such:

Since mathematically, a fractal may show self-similarity under indefinite magnification, it is impossible to recreate this physically. Peitgen &quot;et al.&quot; suggest studying self-similarity using approximations:

This vocabulary was introduced by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1964.

==Self-affinity==

In mathematics, self-affinity is a feature of a fractal whose pieces are scaled by different amounts in the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; directions. This means that to appreciate the self-similarity of these fractal objects, they have to be rescaled using an anisotropic affine transformation.

==Definition==
A compact topological space &quot;X&quot; is self-similar if there exists a finite set &quot;S&quot; indexing a set of non-surjective homeomorphisms formula_4 for which

:formula_5

If formula_6, we call &quot;X&quot; self-similar if it is the only non-empty subset of &quot;Y&quot; such that the equation above holds for formula_7. We call

:formula_8

a &quot;self-similar structure&quot;. The homeomorphisms may be iterated, resulting in an iterated function system. The composition of functions creates the algebraic structure of a monoid. When the set &quot;S&quot; has only two elements, the monoid is known as the dyadic monoid. The dyadic monoid can be visualized as an infinite binary tree; more generally, if the set &quot;S&quot; has &quot;p&quot; elements, then the monoid may be represented as a p-adic tree.

The automorphisms of the dyadic monoid is the modular group; the automorphisms can be pictured as hyperbolic rotations of the binary tree.

A more general notion than self-similarity is self-affinity.

==Examples==

The Mandelbrot set is also self-similar around Misiurewicz points.

Self-similarity has important consequences for the design of computer networks, as typical network traffic has self-similar properties. For example, in teletraffic engineering, packet switched data traffic patterns seem to be statistically self-similar. This property means that simple models using a Poisson distribution are inaccurate, and networks designed without taking self-similarity into account are likely to function in unexpected ways.

Similarly, stock market movements are described as displaying self-affinity, i.e. they appear self-similar when transformed via an appropriate affine transformation for the level of detail being shown. Andrew Lo describes stock market log return self-similarity in econometrics.

Finite subdivision rules are a powerful technique for building self-similar sets, including the Cantor set and the Sierpinski triangle.

=== In cybernetics ===
The viable system model of Stafford Beer is an organizational model with an affine self-similar hierarchy, where a given viable system is one element of the System One of a viable system one recursive level higher up, and for whom the elements of its System One are viable systems one recursive level lower down.

=== In nature ===
Self-similarity can be found in nature, as well. To the right is a mathematically generated, perfectly self-similar image of a fern, which bears a marked resemblance to natural ferns. Other plants, such as Romanesco broccoli, exhibit strong self-similarity.

=== In music ===
* Strict canons display various types and amounts of self-similarity, as do sections of fugues.
* A Shepard tone is self-similar in the frequency or wavelength domains.
* The Danish composer Per Nørgård has made use of a self-similar integer sequence named the &#x27;infinity series&#x27; in much of his music.
* In the research field of music information retrieval, self-similarity commonly refers to the fact that music often consists of parts that are repeated in time. In other words, music is self-similar under temporal translation, rather than (or in addition to) under scaling.

<text>Small beer (also known as small ale or table beer) is a lager or ale that contains a lower amount of alcohol by volume than most others, usually between 0.5% and 2.8%. Sometimes unfiltered and porridge-like, it was a favoured drink in Medieval Europe and colonial North America compared with more expensive beer containing higher levels of alcohol. Small beer was also produced in households for consumption by children and by servants.

==History==
At mealtimes in the Middle Ages, persons of all ages drank small beer, particularly while eating a meal at the table. It is hard to establish the associated alcoholic content, since systematic records of brewing practice do not exist much before the Georgian era.

It was common for workers who engaged in laborious tasks to drink more than ten imperial pints (5.7 litres) of small beer a day to quench their thirst. Small beer was also consumed for its nutrition content. It might contain traces of wheat or bread suspended within it. 

In 17th century England, it was an excise class which was determined by its wholesale price. Between the years 1782 and 1802, table beer was said to define that which cost between six and eleven shillings per barrel and the tax on this class was around three shillings. Cheaper beer was considered &quot;small beer&quot; while the more expensive brands were classed as strong (big) beer. The differences between small beer and table beer were removed in 1802 because there was much fraudulent mixing of the types. 

Small beer was socially acceptable in 18th-century England because of its lower alcohol content, allowing people to drink several glasses without becoming drunk. William Hogarth&#x27;s portrait &quot;Beer Street&quot; (1751) shows a group of happy workers going about their business after drinking table beer. It became increasingly popular during the 19th century, displacing malt liquor as the drink of choice for families and servants.

In his &quot;A Plan for the Conduct of Female Education, in Boarding Schools&quot; published 1797, writer Erasmus Darwin agreed that &quot;For the drink of the more robust children water is preferable, and for the weaker ones, small beer ...&quot;. Ruthin School&#x27;s charter, signed by Elizabeth I, stipulates that small beer should be provided to all scholars, and larger educational establishments like Eton, Winchester, and Oxford University even ran their own breweries. 

To a large extent, the role of small beer as an everyday drink was gradually overtaken in the British Isles by tea, as that became cheaper from the later 18th century.

== Contemporary usage ==
Small beer and small ale can also refer to beers made from the second runnings from the stronger beer (e.g., Scotch ale). Such beers can be as strong as a mild ale, but it depends on the strength of the original mash. This was an economic measure in household brewing in England until the 18th century, and still produced by some homebrewers. it is now only produced commercially in small quantities in Britain, and is not widely available in pubs or shops.

In Belgium, small or table beer is known as &quot;bière de table&quot; or &quot;tafelbier&quot; and their many varieties are still brewed. Breweries that perpetuated in this type included De Es of Schalkhoven and Gigi of Gérouville in the Province of Luxembourg. In the US, a Vienna lager was a popular table beer before prohibition. Small beers are also produced in Germany and Switzerland albeit using local brewing methods.

==In art and history==

===Literature===

Metaphorically, &quot;small beer&quot; means a trifle, or a thing of little importance.

* &quot;Small ale&quot; appears in the works of Shakespeare, William Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and in Ellis Peters&#x27; Brother Cadfael series, and &quot;small beer&quot; appears in Thackeray&#x27;s Barry Lyndon.
* Graham Greene used the phrase &quot;small beer&quot; in the metaphorical sense in &quot;The Honorary Consul&quot;. 
* When David Balfour first meets his uncle Ebenezer in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Kidnapped&quot;, Ebenezer has laid a table with his own supper, &quot;with a bowl of porridge, a horn spoon, and a cup of small beer&quot;. The small beer, horn spoon, and the porridge, indicates Ebenezer Balfour&#x27;s miserliness, since he could afford much better food and drink, but it may also be meant to convey the &quot;trifle&quot; meaning as an indication of Ebenezer&#x27;s weak, petty character.
* In the song &quot;There Lived a King&quot; in the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, small beer is used as a metaphor for something that is common or is of little value.
* Cold small beer appears in &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How Many Thousands of Men and Women Have Recovered from Alcoholism&quot; in Chapter 1. The narrator of &quot;Bill&#x27;s Story&quot; recalls seeing the tombstone of the Thomas Thetcher, the Hampshire Grenadier, and taking it as a warning against drinking strong liquor to excess.
* Adam Smith uses small beer in a few examples in &quot;An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations&quot;. These include a comparison of the value of small beer and the value of bread, and a longer description of why cheap alcohol does not result in greater drunkenness.

===History===
* Thomas Thetcher&#x27;s tombstone at Winchester Cathedral features a poem that blames his death on drinking cold small beer. 
* Benjamin Franklin attested in his autobiography that it was sometimes had with breakfast. George Washington had a recipe for it involving bran and molasses.
*William Cobbett in his work &quot;A History of the Protestant Reformation&quot; refers to a 12th-century Catholic place of hospitality which fed 100 men a day – &quot;Each had a loaf of bread, three quarts of small beer, and &#x27;two messes,&#x27; for his dinner; and they were allowed to carry home that which they did not consume upon the spot.&quot; (Pg. 90, TAN Books, 1988)
