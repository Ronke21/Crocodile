<text>Sambia () or Samland () or Kaliningrad Peninsula (official name, , &quot;Kaliningradsky poluostrov&quot;) is a peninsula in the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia, on the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea. The peninsula is bounded by the Curonian Lagoon to the north-east, the Vistula Lagoon in the southwest, the Pregolya River in the south, and the Deyma River in the east. As Sambia is surrounded on all sides by water, it is technically an island. Historically it formed an important part of the historic region of Prussia.

==Etymology==
Sambia is named after the Sambians, an extinct tribe of Old Prussians. &quot;Samland&quot; is the name for the peninsula in the Germanic languages. Polish and Latin speakers call the area &quot;Sambia&quot;, while the Lithuanian name is &quot;Semba&quot;.

== Geography and geology ==

Baedeker describes Sambia as &quot;a fertile and wooded district, with several lakes, lying to the north of Königsberg&quot; (since 1946 Kaliningrad). The landscape is hilly in the west, with coastal bluffs and beaches, while in the east it is low-lying and flat. The sections of coast adjacent to the Curonian and Vistula Lagoons are often swampy. Due to the moderating influence of the Baltic Sea, the climate is more mild than regions of comparable latitude further east. The highest point at 111 meters, Galtgarben, is found two kilometers southeast of Kumachyovo ().

Gvardeysk () is located at the southeastern end of the peninsula where the Deyma branches off from the Pregolya, while Polessk () is found at the northeastern end, nearby where that river enters the Curonian Lagoon. The peninsula is connected to the Curonian Spit to the north, while it is separated from the Vistula Spit by the Strait of Baltiysk next to the port city of Baltiysk (). Sambia also includes two famous seaside resorts on its northern coast, Zelenogradsk () and Svetlogorsk ().

===Amber===

Amber has been found in the area for over two thousand years, especially on the coast near Kaliningrad. History and legends tell of the ancient trade routes known as the Amber Road leading from the Old Prussian settlements of Kaup (in Sambia) and Truso (near Elbląg, near the mouth of the Vistula) southwards to the Black and Adriatic seas. In Imperial Germany, the right to collect amber was restricted to the Hohenzollern dynasty, and visitors to Sambia&#x27;s beaches were forbidden to pick up any fragments they found. Beginning in the 19th century, amber was mined on an industrial scale by the Germans before 1945 and by the Soviets / Russians thereafter at Yantarny (former German name: &quot;Palmnicken&quot;).

== History ==
Reference to the Sambia Peninsula begins with Greek traveller Pytheas, referring to an amber island called &quot;Abalus&quot;. The name probably described the whole lagoon area known in Finnic as AVA (open expanse = lagoon) and -LA (place of) Historic scholars could not find the mysterious amber island because the Sambia Peninsula did not look like an island since the whole Baltic area that was depressed by the Ice Age glaciers has been rising many meters in the last thousands of years and was no longer looking like an island by the 10th century. Based on finds of prehistoric amber carvings, nomadic boat using hunter gatherers were attracted to the area as early as 6,000 years ago,according to archeology.

Sambia was originally sparsely populated by the Sambians. The German Teutonic Knights conquered the region in the 13th century. The church administration was placed under the Bishopric of Samland, established in 1243. Settlers from the Holy Roman Empire began colonizing the region, and the Sambian Prussians gradually became assimilated. The peninsula was the last area in which the Old Prussian language was spoken before becoming extinct at the beginning of the 18th century.

In 1454, the region was incorporated by King Casimir IV Jagiellon to the Kingdom of Poland upon the request of the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation. After the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War, since 1466, it formed part of Poland as a fief held by the Teutonic Order. The peninsula became part of the Duchy of Prussia, a vassal duchy of the Kingdom of Poland, founded when Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach, the 37th Grand Master, secularized the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights in 1525. The Margraviate of Brandenburg inherited the duchy in 1618 under Polish overlordship.

Because the Duchy of Prussia failed to fulfill its feudal obligations as a vassal of Poland during the Polish–Swedish wars, George William&#x27;s rule in Prussia was suspended in 1635 and he was replaced by the Polish king by a viceroy, Jerzy Ossoliński. However, under the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś the Duchy (and so the Sambia peninsula) was given back to George William. In 1701 Hohenzollern ruler proclaimed the Kingdom of Prussia and Sambia became part of the newly formed Province of East Prussia in 1773. In 1871, the peninsula became part of the German Empire in the course of the unification of Germany. After World War I Sambia formed part of the East Prussian province of Weimar Germany.

During World War II, the Germans operated two subcamps of the Stutthof concentration camp, and the AGSSt Samland assembly center for Allied POWs in the region. The Polish resistance movement was active in the region, with its activities including espionage of German activity and distribution of Polish underground press.

In 1945 after World War II, the Soviet Union annexed northern East Prussia, including Sambia, while the southern part of the province became again part of Poland. Sambia became part of the Soviet Kaliningrad Oblast, named after the nearby city of Kaliningrad (historically ), and the new authorities expelled its German inhabitants in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement.

The Soviet Union gradually repopulated the Kaliningrad Oblast, including Sambia, with Russians and Belarusians. Until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, much of the district was a closed military area.

===Kursenieki===
While today the Kursenieki, also known as Kuršininkai are a nearly extinct Baltic ethnic group living along the Curonian Spit, in 1649 Kuršininkai settlement spanned from Memel (Klaipėda) to Gdańsk, Poland, including the coastline of the Sambian Peninsula. The Kuršininkai were eventually assimilated by the Germans, except along the Curonian Spit where some still live. The Kuršininkai were considered Latvians until after World War I when Latvia gained independence from the Russian Empire, a consideration based on linguistic arguments. This was the rationale for Latvian claims over the Curonian Spit, Memel, and other territories of East Prussia which would be later dropped.

<doc id="28791" wikidata="Q42008" url="?curid=28791" title="Sovereignty">
<text>Sovereignty can generally be defined as supreme authority. Sovereignty entails hierarchy within a state as well as external autonomy for states. In any state, sovereignty is assigned to the person, body or institution that has the ultimate authority over other people and to change existing laws. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme legitimate authority over some polity. In international law, sovereignty is the exercise of power by a state. &quot;De jure&quot; sovereignty refers to the legal right to do so; &quot;de facto&quot; sovereignty refers to the factual ability to do so. This can become an issue of special concern upon the failure of the usual expectation that &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; sovereignty exist at the place and time of concern, and reside within the same organization.

==Etymology==
The term arises from the unattested Vulgar Latin *&quot;superanus&quot; (itself a derived form of Latin &quot;super&quot; – &quot;over&quot;) meaning &quot;chief&quot;, &quot;ruler&quot;. Its spelling, which has varied since the word&#x27;s first appearance in English in the 14th century, was influenced by the English word &quot;reign&quot;.

==Concepts==
The concept of sovereignty has had multiple conflicting components, varying definitions, and diverse and inconsistent applications throughout history. The current notion of state sovereignty contains four aspects: territory, population, authority and recognition. According to Stephen D. Krasner, the term could also be understood in four different ways:
* Domestic sovereignty – actual control over a state exercised by an authority organized within this state
* Interdependence sovereignty – actual control of movement across the state&#x27;s borders
* International legal sovereignty – formal recognition by other sovereign states
* Westphalian sovereignty – there is no other authority in the state aside from the domestic sovereign (such other authorities might be e.g. a political organization or any other external agent).

Often, these four aspects all appear together, but this is not necessarily the case – they are not affected by one another, and there are historical examples of states that were non-sovereign in one aspect while at the same time being sovereign in another of these aspects. According to Immanuel Wallerstein, another fundamental feature of sovereignty is that it is a claim that must be recognized if it is to have any meaning: There are two additional components of sovereignty that should be discussed, empirical sovereignty and juridical sovereignty. Empirical sovereignty deals with the legitimacy of who is in control of a state and the legitimacy of how they exercise their power. Tilly references an example where nobles in parts of Europe were allowed to engage in private rights and &quot;Ustages&quot;, a constitution by Catalonia recognized that right which demonstrates empirical sovereignty. As David Samuel points out, this is an important aspect of a state because there has to be a designated individual or group of individuals that are acting on behalf of the people of the state. Juridical sovereignty emphasizes the importance of other states recognizing the rights of a state to exercise their control freely with little interference. For example, Jackson, Rosberg and Jones explain how the sovereignty and survival of African states were more largely influenced by legal recognition rather than material aid. Douglass North identifies that institutions want structure and these two forms of sovereignty can be a method for developing structure.

For a while, the United Nations highly valued juridical sovereignty and attempted to reinforce its principle often. More recently, the United Nations is shifting away and focusing on establishing empirical sovereignty. Michael Barnett notes that this is largely due to the effects of the post Cold War era because the United Nations believed that to have peaceful relations states should establish peace within their territory. As a matter of fact, theorists found that during the post Cold War era many people focused on how stronger internal structures promote inter-state peace. For instance, Zaum argues that many weak and impoverished countries that were affected by the Cold War were given assistance to develop their lacking sovereignty through this sub-concept of &quot;empirical statehood&quot;.

==History==
===Classical===
The Roman jurist Ulpian observed that:
* The people transferred all their &quot;imperium&quot; and power to the Emperor. &quot;Cum lege regia, quae de imperio eius lata est, populus ei et in eum omne suum imperium et potestatem conferat&quot; (Digest I.4.1)
* The laws do not bind the emperor. &quot;Princeps legibus solutus est&quot; (Digest I.3.31)
* A decision by the emperor has the force of law. &quot;Quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem.&quot; (Digest I.4.1)

Ulpian was expressing the idea that the emperor exercised a rather absolute form of sovereignty that originated in the people, although he did not use the term expressly.

===Medieval===
Ulpian&#x27;s statements were known in medieval Europe, but sovereignty was an important concept in medieval times. Medieval monarchs were &quot;not&quot; sovereign, at least not strongly so, because they were constrained by, and shared power with, their feudal aristocracy. Furthermore, both were strongly constrained by custom. Sovereignty existed during the Medieval period as the &quot;de jure&quot; rights of nobility and royalty.

===Reformation===
Sovereignty reemerged as a concept in the late 16th century, a time when civil wars had created a craving for a stronger central authority when monarchs had begun to gather power onto their own hands at the expense of the nobility, and the modern nation state was emerging. Jean Bodin, partly in reaction to the chaos of the French wars of religion, presented theories of sovereignty calling for a strong central authority in the form of absolute monarchy. In his 1576 treatise &quot;Les Six Livres de la République&quot; (&quot;Six Books of the Republic&quot;) Bodin argued that it is inherent in the nature of the state that sovereignty must be:
* Absolute: On this point, he said that the sovereign must be hedged in with obligations and conditions, must be able to legislate without his (or its) subjects&#x27; consent, must not be bound by the laws of his predecessors, and could not, because it is illogical, be bound by his own laws.
* Perpetual: Not temporarily delegated as to a strong leader in an emergency or a state employee such as a magistrate. He held that sovereignty must be perpetual because anyone with the power to enforce a time limit on the governing power must be above the governing power, which would be impossible if the governing power is absolute.

The treatise is frequently viewed as the first European text theorizing state sovereignty.

Bodin rejected the notion of transference of sovereignty from people to the ruler (also known as &quot;the sovereign&quot;); natural law and divine law confer upon the sovereign the right to rule. And the sovereign is not above divine law or natural law. He is above (&quot;i.e.&quot; not bound by) only positive law, that is, laws made by humans. He emphasized that a sovereign is bound to observe certain basic rules derived from the divine law, the law of nature or reason, and the law that is common to all nations (jus gentium), as well as the fundamental laws of the state that determine who is the sovereign, who succeeds to sovereignty, and what limits the sovereign power. Thus, Bodin&#x27;s sovereign was restricted by the constitutional law of the state and by the higher law that was considered as binding upon every human being. The fact that the sovereign must obey divine and natural law imposes ethical constraints on him. Bodin also held that the &quot;lois royales&quot;, the fundamental laws of the French monarchy which regulated matters such as succession, are natural laws and are binding on the French sovereign.

Despite his commitment to absolutism, Bodin held some moderate opinions on how government should in practice be carried out. He held that although the sovereign is not obliged to, it is advisable for him, as a practical expedient, to convene a senate from whom he can obtain advice, to delegate some power to magistrates for the practical administration of the law, and to use the Estates as a means of communicating with the people. Bodin believed that &quot;the most divine, most excellent, and the state form most proper to royalty is governed partly aristocratically and partly democratically&quot;.

===Age of Enlightenment===
During the Age of Enlightenment, the idea of sovereignty gained both legal and moral force as the main Western description of the meaning and power of a State. In particular, the &quot;Social contract&quot; as a mechanism for establishing sovereignty was suggested and, by 1800, widely accepted, especially in the new United States and France, though also in Great Britain to a lesser extent.

Thomas Hobbes, in &quot;Leviathan&quot; (1651) put forward a conception of sovereignty similar to Bodin&#x27;s, which had just achieved legal status in the &quot;Peace of Westphalia&quot;, but for different reasons. He created the first modern version of the social contract (or contractarian) theory, arguing that to overcome the &quot;nasty, brutish and short&quot; quality of life without the cooperation of other human beings, people must join in a &quot;commonwealth&quot; and submit to a &quot;Soveraigne Power&quot; that can compel them to act in the common good. Hobbes was thus the first to write that relations between the people and the sovereign were based on negotiation rather than natural submission. His expediency argument attracted many of the early proponents of sovereignty. Hobbes strengthened the definition of sovereignty beyond either Westphalian or Bodin&#x27;s, by saying that it must be:
* Absolute: because conditions could only be imposed on a sovereign if there were some outside arbitrator to determine when he had violated them, in which case the sovereign would not be the final authority.
* Indivisible: The sovereign is the only final authority in his territory; he does not share final authority with any other entity. Hobbes held this to be true because otherwise there would be no way of resolving a disagreement between the multiple authorities.

Hobbes&#x27; hypothesis—that the ruler&#x27;s sovereignty is contracted to him by the people in return for his maintaining their physical safety—led him to conclude that if and when the ruler fails, the people recover their ability to protect themselves by forming a new contract.

Hobbes&#x27;s theories decisively shape the concept of sovereignty through the medium of social contract theories. Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s (1712–1778) definition of popular sovereignty (with early antecedents in Francisco Suárez&#x27;s theory of the origin of power), provides that the people are the legitimate sovereign. Rousseau considered sovereignty to be inalienable; he condemned the distinction between the origin and the exercise of sovereignty, a distinction upon which constitutional monarchy or representative democracy is founded. John Locke, and Montesquieu are also key figures in the unfolding of the concept of sovereignty; their views differ with Rousseau and with Hobbes on this issue of alienability.

The second book of Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Du Contrat Social, ou Principes du droit politique&quot; (1762) deals with sovereignty and its rights. Sovereignty, or the general will, is inalienable, for the will cannot be transmitted; it is indivisible since it is essentially general; it is infallible and always right, determined and limited in its power by the common interest; it acts through laws. Law is the decision of the general will regarding some object of common interest, but though the general will is always right and desires only good, its judgment is not always enlightened, and consequently does not always see wherein the common good lies; hence the necessity of the legislator. But the legislator has, of himself, no authority; he is only a guide who drafts and proposes laws, but the people alone (that is, the sovereign or general will) has authority to make and impose them.

Rousseau, in the &quot;Social Contract&quot;
argued, &quot;the growth of the State giving the trustees of public authority more and means to abuse their power, the more the Government has to have force to contain the people, the more force the Sovereign should have in turn to contain the Government,&quot; with the understanding that the Sovereign is &quot;a collective being of wonder&quot; (Book II, Chapter I) resulting from &quot;the general will&quot; of the people, and that &quot;what any man, whoever he may be, orders on his own, is not a law&quot; (Book II, Chapter VI) – and predicated on the assumption that the people have an unbiased means by which to ascertain the general will. Thus the legal maxim, &quot;there is no law without a sovereign.&quot;

According to Hendrik Spruyt, the sovereign state emerged as a response to changes in international trade (forming coalitions that wanted sovereign states) so that the sovereign state&#x27;s emergence was not inevitable; &quot;it arose because of a particular conjuncture of social and political interests in Europe.&quot;

Once states are recognized as sovereign, they are rarely recolonized, merged, or dissolved.

===Post World War II world order===
Today, no state is sovereign in the sense they were prior to the Second World War. Transnational governance agreements and institutions, the globalized economy, and pooled sovereignty unions such as the European union have eroded the sovereignty of traditional states. The centuries long movement which developed a global system of sovereign states came to an end when the excesses of World War II made it clear to nations that some curtailment of the rights of sovereign states was necessary if future cruelties and injustices were to be prevented. In the years immediately prior to the war, political theorist Carl Schmitt argued that sovereignty had supremacy over constitutional and international constraints arguing that states as sovereigns could not be judged and punished. After the Holocaust, the vast majority of states rejected the prior Westphalian permissiveness towards such supremacist power based sovereignty formulations and signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. It was the first step towards circumscription of the powers of sovereign nations, soon followed by the Genocide Convention which legally required nations to punish genocide. Based on these and similar human rights agreements, beginning in 1990 there was a practical expression of this circumscription when the Westphalian principle of non-intervention was no longer observed for cases where the United Nations or another international organization endorsed a political or military action. Previously, actions in Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, Cambodia or Liberia would have been regarded as illegitimate interference in internal affairs. In 2005, the revision of the concept of sovereignty was made explicit with the Responsibility to Protect agreement endorsed by all member states of the United Nations. If a state fails this responsibility either by perpetrating massive injustice or being incapable of protecting its citizens, then outsiders may assume that responsibility despite prior norms forbidding such interference in a nation&#x27;s sovereignty.

European integration is the second form of post-world war change in the norms of sovereignty, representing a significant shift since member nations are no longer absolutely sovereign. Some theorists, such as Jacques Maritain and Bertrand de Jouvenel have attacked the legitimacy of the earlier concepts of sovereignty, with Maritain advocating that the concept be discarded entirely since it:
*stands in the way of international law and a world state, 
*internally results in centralism, not pluralism
*obstructs the democratic notion of accountability

Efforts to curtail absolute sovereignty have met with substantial resistance by sovereigntist movements in multiple countries who seek to &quot;take back control&quot; from such transnational governance groups and agreements, restoring the world to pre World War II norms of sovereignty.

==Definition and types==
===Absoluteness===
An important factor of sovereignty is its degree of absoluteness. A sovereign power has absolute sovereignty when it is not restricted by a constitution, by the laws of its predecessors, or by custom, and no areas of law or policy are reserved as being outside its control. International law; policies and actions of neighboring states; cooperation and respect of the populace; means of enforcement; and resources to enact policy are factors that might limit sovereignty. For example, parents are not guaranteed the right to decide some matters in the upbringing of their children independent of societal regulation, and municipalities do not have unlimited jurisdiction in local matters, thus neither parents nor municipalities have absolute sovereignty. Theorists have diverged over the desirability of increased absoluteness.

===Exclusivity===
A key element of sovereignty in a legalistic sense is that of exclusivity of jurisdiction also described as the ultimate arbiter in all disputes on the territory. Specifically, the degree to which decisions made by a sovereign entity might be contradicted by another authority. Along these lines, the German sociologist Max Weber proposed that sovereignty is a community&#x27;s monopoly on the legitimate use of force; and thus any group claiming the right to violence must either be brought under the yoke of the sovereign, proven illegitimate or otherwise contested and defeated for sovereignty to be genuine. International law, competing branches of government, and authorities reserved for subordinate entities (such as federated states or republics) represent legal infringements on exclusivity. Social institutions such as religious bodies, corporations, and competing political parties might represent &quot;de facto&quot; infringements on exclusivity.

===&quot;De jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot;===
&quot;De jure&quot;, or legal, sovereignty concerns the expressed and institutionally recognised right to exercise control over a territory. &quot;De facto&quot; sovereignty means sovereignty exists in practice, irrespective of anything legally accepted as such, usually in writing. Cooperation and respect of the populace; control of resources in, or moved into, an area; means of enforcement and security; and ability to carry out various functions of state all represent measures of &quot;de facto&quot; sovereignty. When control is practiced predominantly by the military or police force it is considered &quot;coercive sovereignty&quot;.

====Sovereignty and independence====

State sovereignty is sometimes viewed synonymously with independence, however, sovereignty can be transferred as a legal right whereas independence cannot. A state can achieve &quot;de facto&quot; independence long after acquiring sovereignty, such as in the case of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Additionally, independence can also be suspended when an entire region becomes subject to an occupation. For example, when Iraq was overrun by foreign forces in the Iraq War of 2003, Iraq had not been annexed by any country, so sovereignty over it had not been claimed by any foreign state (despite the facts on the ground). Alternatively, independence can be lost completely when sovereignty itself becomes the subject of dispute. The pre-World War II administrations of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia maintained an exile existence (and considerable international recognition) whilst their territories were annexed by the Soviet Union and governed locally by their pro-Soviet functionaries. When in 1991 Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia re-enacted independence, it was done so on the basis of continuity directly from the pre-Soviet republics.

Another complicated sovereignty scenario can arise when regime itself is the subject of dispute. In the case of Poland, the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland which governed Poland from 1945 to 1989 is now seen to have been an illegal entity by the modern Polish administration. The post-1989 Polish state claims direct continuity from the Second Polish Republic which ended in 1939. For other reasons, however, Poland maintains its communist-era outline as opposed to its pre-World War II shape which included areas now in Belarus, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Slovakia and Ukraine but did not include some of its western regions that were then in Germany.

Additionally sovereignty can be achieved without independence, such as how the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic made the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic a sovereign entity within but not independent from the USSR.

At the opposite end of the scale, there is no dispute regarding the self-governance of certain self-proclaimed states such as the Republic of Kosovo or Somaliland (see List of states with limited recognition, but most of them are puppet states) since their governments neither answer to a bigger state nor is their governance subjected to supervision. The sovereignty (i.e. legal right to govern) however, is disputed in both cases as the first entity is claimed by Serbia and the second by Somalia.

===Internal===

Internal sovereignty is the relationship between sovereign power and the political community. A central concern is legitimacy: by what right does a government exercise authority? Claims of legitimacy might refer to the divine right of kings, or to a social contract (i.e. popular sovereignty). Max Weber offered a first categorization of political authority and legitimacy with the categories of traditional, charismatic and legal-rational.

With &quot;sovereignty&quot; meaning holding supreme, independent authority over a region or state, &quot;internal sovereignty&quot; refers to the internal affairs of the state and the location of supreme power within it. A state that has internal sovereignty is one with a government that has been elected by the people and has the popular legitimacy. Internal sovereignty examines the internal affairs of a state and how it operates. It is important to have strong internal sovereignty to keeping order and peace. When you have weak internal sovereignty, organisations such as rebel groups will undermine the authority and disrupt the peace. The presence of a strong authority allows you to keep the agreement and enforce sanctions for the violation of laws. The ability for leadership to prevent these violations is a key variable in determining internal sovereignty. The lack of internal sovereignty can cause war in one of two ways: first, undermining the value of agreement by allowing costly violations; and second, requiring such large subsidies for implementation that they render war cheaper than peace. Leadership needs to be able to promise members, especially those like armies, police forces, or paramilitaries will abide by agreements. The presence of strong internal sovereignty allows a state to deter opposition groups in exchange for bargaining. While the operations and affairs within a state are relative to the level of sovereignty within that state, there is still an argument over who should hold the authority in a sovereign state.

This argument between who should hold the authority within a sovereign state is called the traditional doctrine of public sovereignty. This discussion is between an internal sovereign or an authority of public sovereignty. An internal sovereign is a political body that possesses ultimate, final and independent authority; one whose decisions are binding upon all citizens, groups and institutions in society. Early thinkers believed sovereignty should be vested in the hands of a single person, a monarch. They believed the overriding merit of vesting sovereignty in a single individual was that sovereignty would therefore be indivisible; it would be expressed in a single voice that could claim final authority. An example of an internal sovereign is Louis XIV of France during the seventeenth century; Louis XIV claimed that he was the state. Jean-Jacques Rousseau rejected monarchical rule in favor of the other type of authority within a sovereign state, public sovereignty. Public Sovereignty is the belief that ultimate authority is vested in the people themselves, expressed in the idea of the general will. This means that the power is elected and supported by its members, the authority has a central goal of the good of the people in mind. The idea of public sovereignty has often been the basis for modern democratic theory.

====Modern internal sovereignty====
Within the modern governmental system, internal sovereignty is usually found in states that have public sovereignty and is rarely found within a state controlled by an internal sovereign. A form of government that is a little different from both is the UK parliament system. John Austin argued that sovereignty in the UK was vested neither in the Crown nor in the people but in the &quot;Queen-in-Parliament&quot;. This is the origin of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty and is usually seen as the fundamental principle of the British constitution. With these principles of parliamentary sovereignty, majority control can gain access to unlimited constitutional authority, creating what has been called &quot;elective dictatorship&quot; or &quot;modern autocracy&quot;. Public sovereignty in modern governments is a lot more common with examples like the US, Canada, Australia and India where the government is divided into different levels.

===External===

External sovereignty concerns the relationship between sovereign power and other states. For example, the United Kingdom uses the following criterion when deciding under what conditions other states recognise a political entity as having sovereignty over some territory;
External sovereignty is connected with questions of international law – such as when, if ever, is intervention by one country into another&#x27;s territory permissible?

Following the Thirty Years&#x27; War, a European religious conflict that embroiled much of the continent, the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 established the notion of territorial sovereignty as a norm of noninterference in the affairs of other states, so-called Westphalian sovereignty, even though the treaty itself reaffirmed the multiple levels of the sovereignty of the Holy Roman Empire. This resulted as a natural extension of the older principle of &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot; (Whose realm, his religion), leaving the Roman Catholic Church with little ability to interfere with the internal affairs of many European states. It is a myth, however, that the Treaties of Westphalia created a new European order of equal sovereign states.

In international law, sovereignty means that a government possesses full control over affairs within a territorial or geographical area or limit. Determining whether a specific entity is sovereign is not an exact science, but often a matter of diplomatic dispute. There is usually an expectation that both &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; sovereignty rest in the same organisation at the place and time of concern. Foreign governments use varied criteria and political considerations when deciding whether or not to recognise the sovereignty of a state over a territory. Membership in the United Nations requires that &quot;[t]he admission of any such state to membership in the United Nations will be affected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.&quot;

Sovereignty may be recognized even when the sovereign body possesses no territory or its territory is under partial or total occupation by another power. The Holy See was in this position between the annexation in 1870 of the Papal States by Italy and the signing of the Lateran Treaties in 1929, a 59-year period during which it was recognised as sovereign by many (mostly Roman Catholic) states despite possessing no territory – a situation resolved when the Lateran Treaties granted the Holy See sovereignty over the Vatican City. Another case, &quot;sui generis&quot; is the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, the third sovereign entity inside Italian territory (after San Marino and the Vatican City State) and the second inside the Italian capital (since in 1869 the Palazzo di Malta and the Villa Malta receive extraterritorial rights, in this way becoming the only &quot;sovereign&quot; territorial possessions of the modern Order), which is the last existing heir to one of several once militarily significant, crusader states of sovereign military orders. In 1607 its Grand masters were also made Reichsfürst (princes of the Holy Roman Empire) by the Holy Roman Emperor, granting them seats in the Reichstag, at the time the closest permanent equivalent to an UN-type general assembly; confirmed 1620. These sovereign rights were never deposed, only the territories were lost. Over 100 modern states maintain full diplomatic relations with the order, and the UN awarded it observer status.

The governments-in-exile of many European states (for instance, Norway, Netherlands or Czechoslovakia) during the Second World War were regarded as sovereign despite their territories being under foreign occupation; their governance resumed as soon as the occupation had ended. The government of Kuwait was in a similar situation &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; the Iraqi occupation of its country during 1990–1991. The government of Republic of China (ROC) was generally recognized as sovereign over China from 1911 to 1971 despite the 1949 victory of the Communists in the Chinese civil war and the retreat of the ROC to Taiwan. The ROC represented China at the United Nations until 1971, when the People&#x27;s Republic of China obtained the UN seat. The ROC political status as a state became increasingly disputed; it became commonly known as Taiwan.

The International Committee of the Red Cross is commonly mistaken to be sovereign. It has been granted various degrees of special privileges and legal immunities in many countries, including Belgium, France, Switzerland, Australia, Russia, South Korea, South Africa and the US, and soon in Ireland. The Committee is a private organisation governed by Swiss law.
===Shared and pooled===
Just as the office of head of state can be vested jointly in several persons within a state, the sovereign jurisdiction over a single political territory can be shared jointly by two or more consenting powers, notably in the form of a condominium.

Likewise the member states of international organizations may voluntarily bind themselves by treaty to a supranational organization, such as a continental union. In the case of the European Union member-states, this is called &quot;pooled sovereignty&quot;.

Another example of shared and pooled sovereignty is the Acts of Union 1707 which created the unitary state now known as the United Kingdom. It was a full economic union, meaning the Scottish and English systems of currency, taxation and laws regulating trade were aligned. Nonetheless, Scotland and England never fully surrendered or pooled all of their governance sovereignty; they retained many of their previous national institutional features and characteristics, particularly relating to their legal, religious and educational systems. In 2012, the Scottish Government, created in 1998 through devolution in the United Kingdom, negotiated terms with the Government of the United Kingdom for the 2014 Scottish independence referendum which resulted in the people of Scotland deciding to continue the pooling of its sovereignty with the rest of the United Kingdom.

=== Nation-states ===
A community of people who claim the right of self-determination based on a common ethnicity, history and culture might seek to establish sovereignty over a region, thus creating a nation-state. Such nations are sometimes recognised as autonomous areas rather than as fully sovereign, independent states.

=== Federations ===
In a federal system of government, &quot;sovereignty&quot; also refers to powers which a constituent state or republic possesses independently of the national government. In a confederation, constituent entities retain the right to withdraw from the national body and the union is often more temporary than a federation.

Different interpretations of state sovereignty in the United States of America, as it related to the expansion of slavery and fugitive slave laws, led to the outbreak of the American Civil War. Depending on the particular issue, sometimes both northern and southern states justified their political positions by appealing to state sovereignty. Fearing that slavery would be threatened by results of the 1860 presidential election, eleven slave states declared their independence from the federal Union and formed a new confederation. The United States government rejected the secessions as rebellion, declaring that secession from the Union by an individual state was unconstitutional, as the states were part of an indissoluble federation in Perpetual Union.

=== Sovereignty versus military occupation ===
In situations related to war, or which have arisen as the result of war, most modern scholars still commonly fail to distinguish between holding sovereignty and exercising military occupation.

In regard to military occupation, international law prescribes the limits of the occupant&#x27;s power. Occupation does not displace the sovereignty of the occupied state, though for the time being the occupant may exercise supreme governing authority. Nor does occupation effect any annexation or incorporation of the occupied territory into the territory or political structure of the occupant, and the occupant&#x27;s constitution and laws do not extend of their own force to the occupied territory.

To a large extent, the original academic foundation for the concept of &quot;military occupation&quot; arose from On the Law of War and Peace (1625) by Hugo Grotius and The Law of Nations (1758) by Emmerich de Vattel. Binding international rules regarding the conduct of military occupation were more carefully codified in the 1907 Hague Convention (and accompanying Hague Regulations).

In 1946, the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal stated with regard to the Hague Convention on Land Warfare of 1907: &quot;The rules of land warfare expressed in the Convention undoubtedly represented an advance over existing International Law at the time of their adoption ... but by 1939 these rules ... were recognized by all civilized nations and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war.&quot;

==Acquisition==
A number of modes for acquisition of sovereignty are presently or have historically been recognized in international law as lawful methods by which a state may acquire sovereignty over external territory. The classification of these modes originally derived from Roman property law and from the 15th and 16th century with the development of international law. The modes are:
* Cession is the transfer of territory from one state to another usually by means of treaty;
* Occupation is the acquisition of territory that belongs to no state (or terra nullius);
* Prescription is the effective control of territory of another acquiescing state;
* Operations of nature is the acquisition of territory through natural processes like river accretion or volcanism;
* Creation is the process by which new land is (re)claimed from the sea such as in the Netherlands.
* Adjudication and
* Conquest


==Justifications==
There exist vastly differing views on the moral basis of sovereignty. A fundamental polarity is between theories which assert that sovereignty is vested directly in the sovereigns by divine or natural right, and theories which assert it originates from the people. In the latter case there is a further division into those which assert that the people effectively transfer their sovereignty to the sovereign (Hobbes), and those which assert that the people retain their sovereignty (Rousseau).

During the brief period of absolute monarchies in Europe, the divine right of kings was an important competing justification for the exercise of sovereignty. The Mandate of Heaven had similar implications in China for the justification of the Emperor&#x27;s rule, though it was largely replaced with discussions of Western-style sovereignty by the late 19th century.

A republic is a form of government in which the people, or some significant portion of them, retain sovereignty over the government and where offices of state are not granted through heritage. A common modern definition of a republic is a government having a head of state who is not a monarch.

Democracy is based on the concept of &quot;popular sovereignty&quot;. In a direct democracy the public plays an active role in shaping and deciding policy. Representative democracy permits a transfer of the exercise of sovereignty from the people to a legislative body or an executive (or to some combination of the legislature, executive and Judiciary). Many representative democracies provide limited direct democracy through referendum, initiative, and recall.

Parliamentary sovereignty refers to a representative democracy where the parliament is ultimately sovereign, rather than the executive power or the judiciary.

==Views==
* Classical liberals such as John Stuart Mill consider every individual as sovereign.
* Realists view sovereignty as being untouchable and as guaranteed to legitimate nation-states.
* Rationalists see sovereignty similarly to realists. However, rationalism states that the sovereignty of a nation-state may be violated in extreme circumstances, such as human rights abuses.
* Internationalists believe that sovereignty is outdated and an unnecessary obstacle to achieving peace, in line with their belief in a global community. In the light of the abuse of power by sovereign states such as Hitler&#x27;s Germany or Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union, they argue that human beings are not necessarily protected by the state whose citizens they are and that the respect for state sovereignty on which the UN Charter is founded is an obstacle to humanitarian intervention.
* Anarchists and some libertarians deny the sovereignty of states and governments. Anarchists often argue for a specific individual kind of sovereignty, such as the Anarch as a sovereign individual. Salvador Dalí, for instance, talked of &quot;anarcho-monarchist&quot; (as usual for him, tongue in cheek); Antonin Artaud of &quot;Heliogabalus: Or, The Crowned Anarchist&quot;; Max Stirner of &quot;The Ego and Its Own&quot;; Georges Bataille and Jacques Derrida talked of a kind of &quot;antisovereignty&quot;. Therefore, anarchists join a classical conception of the individual as sovereign of himself, which forms the basis of political consciousness. The unified consciousness is sovereignty over one&#x27;s own body, as Nietzsche demonstrated (see also Pierre Klossowski&#x27;s book on &quot;Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle&quot;). &quot;See also sovereignty of the individual and self-ownership&quot;.
* Imperialists hold a view of sovereignty where power rightfully exists with those states that hold the greatest ability to impose the will of said state, by force or threat of force, over the populace of other states with weaker military or political will. They effectively deny the sovereignty of the individual in deference to either the good of the whole or to divine right.

According to Matteo Laruffa &quot;sovereignty resides in every public action and policy as the exercise of executive powers by institutions open to the participation of citizens to the decision-making processes&quot;

<text>SNAFU is an acronym that is widely used to stand for the sarcastic expression Situation normal: all fucked up. It is a well-known example of military acronym slang. It is sometimes censored to &quot;all fouled up&quot; or similar. It means that the situation is bad, but that this is a normal state of affairs. The acronym is believed to have originated in the United States Marine Corps during World War II.

In modern usage, &quot;SNAFU&quot; is used to describe running into an error or problem that is large and unexpected. For example, in 2005, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article titled &quot;Hospital Staff Cutback Blamed for Test Result Snafu&quot;. &quot;SNAFU&quot; also sometimes refers to a bad situation, mistake, or cause of trouble, and it is sometimes used as an interjection.

==Origin==
Most reference works, including the &quot;Random House Unabridged Dictionary&quot;, supply an origin date of 1940–1944, generally attributing it to the U.S. Army. Rick Atkinson ascribes the origin of &quot;SNAFU&quot;, &quot;FUBAR&quot;, and many other terms to cynical GIs ridiculing the army&#x27;s penchant for acronyms.

The first known publication of the term was by &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot;, on July 27, 1941. It was subsequently recorded in &quot;American Notes and Queries&quot; in the September 1941 issue (which the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 1986 credited as the term&#x27;s first appearance). &quot;Time&quot; magazine used the term in its June 16, 1942, issue: &quot;Last week U.S. citizens knew that gasoline rationing and rubber requisitioning were snafu.&quot; 

The attribution of &quot;SNAFU&quot; to the American military is not universally accepted: it has also been attributed to the British, although the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives its origin and first recorded use as U.S. military slang.

In a wider study of military slang, Elkin noted in 1946 that there &quot;are a few acceptable substitutes such as &#x27;screw up&#x27; or &#x27;mess up,&#x27; but these do not have the emphasis value of the obscene equivalent.&quot; He considered the expression to be &quot;a caricature of Army direction. The soldier resignedly accepts his own less responsible position and expresses his cynicism at the inefficiency of Army authority.&quot; He also noted that &quot;the expression […] is coming into general civilian use.&quot;

==Similar acronyms==
===SUSFU===
SUSFU is an acronym for Situation unchanged: still fucked up, but can also be bowdlerized—just like &quot;SNAFU&quot;—to Situation unchanged: still fouled up. It is used in a military context and was first recorded in the &quot;ANQ&quot; in their September 1941 issue.

<text>The Democratic Left Alliance () was a social-democratic political party in Poland. It was formed on 9 July 1991 as an electoral alliance of centre-left parties, and became a single party on 15 April 1999. It was the major coalition party in Poland between 1993 and 1997, and between 2001 and 2005, with four Prime ministers coming from the party: Józef Oleksy, Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz, Leszek Miller and Marek Belka. It then faded into opposition, overshadowed by the rise of Civic Platform and Law and Justice.

In February 2020, the party initiated a process to absorb the Spring party, choosing the name New Left (), and changing to a more modern logo.

The party was a member of the Party of European Socialists and Progressive Alliance.

== History ==
=== Ideology and support patterns ===
The party can be classified as centre-left. However, during the 1990s, it managed to attract voters from the pro-market and even right-wing camp. The main support for SLD came from middle-rank state sector employees, retired people, former communist Polish United Workers Party (PZPR) and All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ) members and those who were unlikely to be frequent church-goers. The core of the coalition (Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland) rejected concepts such as lustration and de-communization, supported a parliamentarian regime with only the role of an arbiter for the president and criticized the right-wing camp for the introduction of religious education into school. The ex-communists criticized the economic reforms, pointing to the high social costs, without negating the reforms per se.

=== Coalition ===
SdRP, SDU and some other socialist and social-democratic parties had formed the original Democratic Left Alliance as a centre-left coalition just prior to the nation&#x27;s first free elections in 1991. In 1999 the coalition became a party but lost some members.

At the time, the coalition&#x27;s membership drew mostly from the former PZPR. An alliance between the SLD and the Polish People&#x27;s Party (PSL) ruled Poland in the years 1993–1997. However, the coalition lost power to the right-wing Solidarity Electoral Action in the 1997 election as the right-wing opposition was united this time and because of the decline of support for SLD&#x27;s coalition partner PSL, though the SLD itself actually gained votes.

=== Electoral victory ===
SLD formed a coalition with Labour Union before the 2001 Polish election and won it overwhelmingly at last by capturing about 5.3 million votes, 42% of the whole and won 200 of 460 seats in the Sejm and 75 of 100 in the Senate. After the elections, the coalition was joined by the Polish People&#x27;s Party (PSL) in forming a government and Leszek Miller became the Prime Minister. In March 2003, the PSL left the coalition.

=== Rywin affair ===
By 2004, the support for SLD in the polls had dropped from about 30% to just below 10%, and several high-ranking party members had been accused of taking part in high-profile political scandals by the mainstream press, including the Rywin affair, in which film producer Lew Rywin, claiming to be acting on behalf of the government, sought a bribe from the editor of the &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot; newspaper in return for favourable amendments to a proposed new law on media ownership. Prime Minister Leszek Miller was obliged under Polish law to report the attempted bribery to the police when it was brought to his attention, but did not do so.

On 6 March 2004, Miller resigned as party leader and was replaced by Krzysztof Janik. On March 26, the Sejm speaker Marek Borowski, together with other high-ranking SLD officials, announced the creation of a new centre-left party, the Social Democratic Party of Poland. On the next day, Leszek Miller announced he would step down as Prime Minister on 2 May 2004, the day after Poland joined the European Union. Miller proceeded to do so.

=== Decline after Rywin-gate ===
In the 2004 European Parliament election, it only received 9% of the votes, giving it 5 of 54 seats reserved for Poland in the European Parliament, as part of the Party of European Socialists.

Wojciech Olejniczak, the former Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, was elected the president of SLD on 29 May 2004, succeeded Józef Oleksy, who resigned from the post of Polish Prime Minister due to false accusations of links to the KGB.

=== Opposition and decline: 2005 and after ===
The 2004 European elections foreshadowed the SLD&#x27;s huge defeat in the 2005 parliamentary election, in which it won only 11.3% of the vote. This gave the party 55 seats, barely a quarter of what it had had prior to the election. It also lost all of its senators. In late 2006, a centre-left political alliance called Left and Democrats was created, comprising SLD and smaller centre-left parties, the Labour Union, the Social Democratic Party of Poland, and the liberal Democratic Party – demokraci.pl. The coalition won a disappointing 13% in the 2007 parliamentary election and was dissolved soon after in April 2008. On 31 May 2008, Olejniczak was replaced by Grzegorz Napieralski as an SLD leader.

In the 2009 European election, the Democratic Left Alliance-Labor Union joint ticket received 12% of the vote and seven MEPs were elected as part of the newly retitled Socialists &amp; Democrats group.

In the 2011 parliamentary election, SLD received 8.24% of the vote which gave it 27 seats in the Sejm. After the elections, one of the party members, Sławomir Kopyciński, decided to leave SLD and join Palikot&#x27;s Movement. On December 10, 2011, Leszek Miller was chosen to return as the party leader.

In the 2014 European elections, on 25 May 2014, the SLD received 9.4% of the national vote and returned four MEPs.

In July 2015, the SLD formed the United Left electoral alliance along with Your Movement (TR), Labour United (UP) and The Greens (PZ) and minor parties to contest the upcoming election.

In the 2015 parliamentary election held on 25 October 2015, the United Left list received 7.6% of the vote, below the 8% threshold (electoral alliances must win at least 8% of the vote, as opposed to the 5% for individual parties), leaving the SLD without parliamentary representation for the first time. Indeed, for the first time since the end of Communism, no centre-left parties won any seats in this election.

In 2017, the party withdrew from the Socialist International, while maintaining ties with the Progressive Alliance.

For the 2019 parliamentary election, SLD formed an alliance with Razem and Wiosna, known as The Left. In the 2019 parliamentary election, the alliance won 12.6% of the vote and 49 seats in the Sejm, with the SLD winning 24. Later, it was announced that the Democratic Left Alliance would form with the Spring new political party called the New Left. The creation was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Voter base ==
The SLD is usually seen as the face of the standard Polish left, having achieved notable electoral success during the 90s and benefitting from a strongly organized network of local offices, which span 320 of Poland&#x27;s 380 administrative counties. For this reason, it was often viewed as the go-to party for left-leaning Poles for the majority of Poland&#x27;s modern history. The party&#x27;s monopoly on mainstream left-wing economic ideas in Poland however ended, after the right-wing Law and Justice party adopted many economically interventionist positions, which led a considerable portion of economically left-wing Poles to vote for Law and Justice instead.

Besides self-described left-wingers, the party enjoys the support of many members of the country&#x27;s police and military, but its largest voting bloc resides among former PZPR members, government officials and civil servants during the PPR period, which are seen as the party&#x27;s core supporters. The loyal support of this voting bloc enabled the SLD to remain the largest party of the Polish left, even throughout the scandals that rocked the party in the early 2000s.

However, this electoral bloc was seen as unreliable by political observers, as despite the fact that it originally constituted a huge voting bloc, that segment of the population would inevitably shrink as its members steadily age. Following the passage of a &quot;degradation law&quot; by the ruling right-wing PiS party, which cut pensions and disability benefits to thousands of former bureaucrats, however, the party has undergone a revival, as more and more people&#x27;s primary income came to be threatened by the new government policy. This led many of those affected to support the SLD, thus enlarging and mobilizing the formerly shrinking voting bloc.

The SLD nonetheless made a significant effort to broaden its political appeal by joining forces with two smaller left-wing parties in 2019, creating The Left political alliance, which poses itself as a &#x27;modern&#x27; take on leftism.

<text>In computing, a segmentation fault (often shortened to segfault) or access violation is a fault, or failure condition, raised by hardware with memory protection, notifying an operating system (OS) the software has attempted to access a restricted area of memory (a memory access violation). On standard x86 computers, this is a form of general protection fault. The operating system kernel will, in response, usually perform some corrective action, generally passing the fault on to the offending process by sending the process a signal. Processes can in some cases install a custom signal handler, allowing them to recover on their own, but otherwise the OS default signal handler is used, generally causing abnormal termination of the process (a program crash), and sometimes a core dump.

Segmentation faults are a common class of error in programs written in languages like C that provide low-level memory access and few to no safety checks. They arise primarily due to errors in use of pointers for virtual memory addressing, particularly illegal access. Another type of memory access error is a bus error, which also has various causes, but is today much rarer; these occur primarily due to incorrect &quot;physical&quot; memory addressing, or due to misaligned memory access – these are memory references that the hardware &quot;cannot&quot; address, rather than references that a process is not &quot;allowed&quot; to address.

Many programming languages have mechanisms designed to avoid segmentation faults and improve memory safety. For example, Rust employs an ownership-based model to ensure memory safety. Other languages, such as Lisp and Java, employ garbage collection, which avoids certain classes of memory errors that could lead to segmentation faults.

== Overview ==


A segmentation fault occurs when a program attempts to access a memory location that it is not allowed to access, or attempts to access a memory location in a way that is not allowed (for example, attempting to write to a read-only location, or to overwrite part of the operating system).

The term &quot;segmentation&quot; has various uses in computing; in the context of &quot;segmentation fault&quot;, it refers to the address space of a &quot;program.&quot; With memory protection, only the program&#x27;s own address space is readable, and of this, only the stack and the read/write portion of the data segment of a program are writable, while read-only data allocated in the const segment and the code segment are not writable. Thus attempting to read outside of the program&#x27;s address space, or writing to a read-only segment of the address space, results in a segmentation fault, hence the name.

On systems using hardware memory segmentation to provide virtual memory, a segmentation fault occurs when the hardware detects an attempt to refer to a non-existent segment, or to refer to a location outside the bounds of a segment, or to refer to a location in a fashion not allowed by the permissions granted for that segment. On systems using only paging, an invalid page fault generally leads to a segmentation fault, and segmentation faults and page faults are both faults raised by the virtual memory management system. Segmentation faults can also occur independently of page faults: illegal access to a valid page is a segmentation fault, but not an invalid page fault, and segmentation faults can occur in the middle of a page (hence no page fault), for example in a buffer overflow that stays within a page but illegally overwrites memory.

At the hardware level, the fault is initially raised by the memory management unit (MMU) on illegal access (if the referenced memory exists), as part of its memory protection feature, or an invalid page fault (if the referenced memory does not exist). If the problem is not an invalid logical address but instead an invalid physical address, a bus error is raised instead, though these are not always distinguished.

At the operating system level, this fault is caught and a signal is passed on to the offending process, activating the process&#x27;s handler for that signal. Different operating systems have different signal names to indicate that a segmentation fault has occurred. On Unix-like operating systems, a signal called SIGSEGV (abbreviated from &quot;segmentation violation&quot;) is sent to the offending process. On Microsoft Windows, the offending process receives a STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION exception.

== Causes ==
The conditions under which segmentation violations occur and how they manifest themselves are specific to hardware and the operating system: different hardware raises different faults for given conditions, and different operating systems convert these to different signals that are passed on to processes. The proximate cause is a memory access violation, while the underlying cause is generally a software bug of some sort. Determining the root cause – debugging the bug – can be simple in some cases, where the program will consistently cause a segmentation fault (e.g., dereferencing a null pointer), while in other cases the bug can be difficult to reproduce and depend on memory allocation on each run (e.g., dereferencing a dangling pointer).

The following are some typical causes of a segmentation fault:
* Attempting to access a nonexistent memory address (outside process&#x27;s address space)
* Attempting to access memory the program does not have rights to (such as kernel structures in process context)
* Attempting to write read-only memory (such as code segment)
These in turn are often caused by programming errors that result in invalid memory access:
* Dereferencing a null pointer, which usually points to an address that&#x27;s not part of the process&#x27;s address space
* Dereferencing or assigning to an uninitialized pointer (wild pointer, which points to a random memory address)
* Dereferencing or assigning to a freed pointer (dangling pointer, which points to memory that has been freed/deallocated/deleted)
* A buffer overflow
* A stack overflow
* Attempting to execute a program that does not compile correctly. (Some compilers will output an executable file despite the presence of compile-time errors.)

In C code, segmentation faults most often occur because of errors in pointer use, particularly in C dynamic memory allocation. Dereferencing a null pointer, which results in undefined behavior, will usually cause a segmentation fault. This is because a null pointer cannot be a valid memory address. On the other hand, wild pointers and dangling pointers point to memory that may or may not exist, and may or may not be readable or writable, and thus can result in transient bugs. For example:

char *p1 = NULL; // Null pointer
char *p2; // Wild pointer: not initialized at all.
char *p3 = malloc(10 * sizeof(char)); // Initialized pointer to allocated memory
 // (assuming malloc did not fail)
free(p3); // p3 is now a dangling pointer, as memory has been freed

Dereferencing any of these variables could cause a segmentation fault: dereferencing the null pointer generally will cause a segfault, while reading from the wild pointer may instead result in random data but no segfault, and reading from the dangling pointer may result in valid data for a while, and then random data as it is overwritten.

== Handling ==

The default action for a segmentation fault or bus error is abnormal termination of the process that triggered it. A core file may be generated to aid debugging, and other platform-dependent actions may also be performed. For example, Linux systems using the grsecurity patch may log SIGSEGV signals in order to monitor for possible intrusion attempts using buffer overflows.

On some systems, like Linux and Windows, it is possible for the program itself to handle a segmentation fault. Depending on the architecture and operating system, the running program can not only handle the event but may extract some information about its state like getting a stack trace, processor register values, the line of the source code when it was triggered, memory address that was invalidly accessed and whether the action was a read or a write.

Although a segmentation fault generally means that the program has a bug that needs fixing, it is also possible to intentionally cause such failure for the purposes of testing, debugging and also to emulate platforms where direct access to memory is needed. On the latter case, the system must be able to allow the program to run even after the fault occurs. In this case, when the system allows, it is possible to handle the event and increment the processor program counter to &quot;jump&quot; over the failing instruction to continue the execution.

== Examples ==
=== Writing to read-only memory ===
Writing to read-only memory raises a segmentation fault. At the level of code errors, this occurs when the program writes to part of its own code segment or the read-only portion of the data segment, as these are loaded by the OS into read-only memory.

Here is an example of ANSI C code that will generally cause a segmentation fault on platforms with memory protection. It attempts to modify a string literal, which is undefined behavior according to the ANSI C standard. Most compilers will not catch this at compile time, and instead compile this to executable code that will crash:
int main(void)
 char *s = &quot;hello world&quot;;
 *s = &#x27;H&#x27;;


When the program containing this code is compiled, the string &quot;hello world&quot; is placed in the rodata section of the program executable file: the read-only section of the data segment. When loaded, the operating system places it with other strings and constant data in a read-only segment of memory. When executed, a variable, &quot;s&quot;, is set to point to the string&#x27;s location, and an attempt is made to write an &quot;H&quot; character through the variable into the memory, causing a segmentation fault. Compiling such a program with a compiler that does not check for the assignment of read-only locations at compile time, and running it on a Unix-like operating system produces the following runtime error:
$ gcc segfault.c -g -o segfault
$ ./segfault
Segmentation fault
Backtrace of the core file from GDB:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x1c0005c2 in main () at segfault.c:6
6 *s = &#x27;H&#x27;;
This code can be corrected by using an array instead of a character pointer, as this allocates memory on stack and initializes it to the value of the string literal:

char s[] = &quot;hello world&quot;;
s[0] = &#x27;H&#x27;; // equivalently, *s = &#x27;H&#x27;;

Even though string literals should not be modified (this has undefined behavior in the C standard), in C they are of codice_1 type, so there is no implicit conversion in the original code (which points a codice_2 at that array), while in C++ they are of codice_3 type, and thus there is an implicit conversion, so compilers will generally catch this particular error.

=== Null pointer dereference ===
In C and C-like languages, null pointers are used to mean &quot;pointer to no object&quot; and as an error indicator, and dereferencing a null pointer (a read or write through a null pointer) is a very common program error. The C standard does not say that the null pointer is the same as the pointer to memory address 0, though that may be the case in practice. Most operating systems map the null pointer&#x27;s address such that accessing it causes a segmentation fault. This behavior is not guaranteed by the C standard. Dereferencing a null pointer is undefined behavior in C, and a conforming implementation is allowed to assume that any pointer that is dereferenced is not null.
int *ptr = NULL;
printf(&quot;%d&quot;, *ptr);
This sample code creates a null pointer, and then tries to access its value (read the value). Doing so causes a segmentation fault at runtime on many operating systems.

Dereferencing a null pointer and then assigning to it (writing a value to a non-existent target) also usually causes a segmentation fault:

int *ptr = NULL;
*ptr = 1;
The following code includes a null pointer dereference, but when compiled will often not result in a segmentation fault, as the value is unused and thus the dereference will often be optimized away by dead code elimination:

int *ptr = NULL;
*ptr;
=== Buffer overflow ===
The following code accesses the character array codice_4 beyond its upper boundary. Depending on the compiler and the processor, this may result in a segmentation fault.

char s[] = &quot;hello world&quot;;
char c = s[20];

=== Stack overflow ===

Another example is recursion without a base case:
int main(void)
 return main();


which causes the stack to overflow which results in a segmentation fault. Infinite recursion may not necessarily result in a stack overflow depending on the language, optimizations performed by the compiler and the exact structure of a code. In this case, the behavior of unreachable code (the return statement) is undefined, so the compiler can eliminate it and use a tail call optimization that might result in no stack usage. Other optimizations could include translating the recursion into iteration, which given the structure of the example function would result in the program running forever, while probably not overflowing its stack.

<doc id="28804" wikidata="Q17105967" url="?curid=28804" title="Signal separation">
<text>Source separation, blind signal separation (BSS) or blind source separation, is the separation of a set of source signals from a set of mixed signals, without the aid of information (or with very little information) about the source signals or the mixing process. It is most commonly applied in digital signal processing and involves the analysis of mixtures of signals; the objective is to recover the original component signals from a mixture signal. The classical example of a source separation problem is the cocktail party problem, where a number of people are talking simultaneously in a room (for example, at a cocktail party), and a listener is trying to follow one of the discussions. The human brain can handle this sort of auditory source separation problem, but it is a difficult problem in digital signal processing.

This problem is in general highly underdetermined, but useful solutions can be derived under a surprising variety of conditions. Much of the early literature in this field focuses on the separation of temporal signals such as audio. However, blind signal separation is now routinely performed on multidimensional data, such as images and tensors, which may involve no time dimension whatsoever. 

Several approaches have been proposed for the solution of this problem but development is currently still very much in progress. Some of the more successful approaches are principal components analysis and independent component analysis, which work well when there are no delays or echoes present; that is, the problem is simplified a great deal. The field of computational auditory scene analysis attempts to achieve auditory source separation using an approach that is based on human hearing.

The human brain must also solve this problem in real time. In human perception this ability is commonly referred to as auditory scene analysis or the cocktail party effect.

==Applications==
===Cocktail party problem===

At a cocktail party, there is a group of people talking at the same time. You have multiple microphones picking up mixed signals, but you want to isolate the speech of a single person. BSS can be used to separate the individual sources by using mixed signals. In the presence of noise, dedicated optimization criteria need to be used.

===Image processing===

Figure 2 shows the basic concept of BSS. The individual source signals are shown as well as the mixed signals which are received signals. BSS is used to separate the mixed signals with only knowing mixed signals and nothing about original signal or how they were mixed. The separated signals are only approximations of the source signals. The separated images, were separated using Python and the Shogun toolbox using Joint Approximation Diagonalization of Eigen-matrices (JADE) algorithm which is based on independent component analysis, ICA. This toolbox method can be used with multi-dimensions but for an easy visual aspect images(2-D) were used.

===Medical imaging===
One of the practical applications being researched in this area is medical imaging of the brain with magnetoencephalography (MEG). This kind of imaging involves careful measurements of magnetic fields outside the head which yield an accurate 3D-picture of the interior of the head. However, external sources of electromagnetic fields, such as a wristwatch on the subject&#x27;s arm, will significantly degrade the accuracy of the measurement. Applying source separation techniques on the measured signals can help remove undesired artifacts from the signal.

===EEG===
In electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), the interference from muscle activity masks the desired signal from brain activity. BSS, however, can be used to separate the two so an accurate representation of brain activity may be achieved.

===Music===
Another application is the separation of musical signals. For a stereo mix of relatively simple signals it is now possible to make a fairly accurate separation, although some artifacts remain.

===Others===
Other applications:
* Communications
* Stock Prediction
* Seismic Monitoring

The set of individual source signals, formula_1, is &#x27;mixed&#x27; using a matrix, formula_2, to produce a set of &#x27;mixed&#x27; signals, formula_3, as follows. Usually, formula_4 is equal to formula_5. If formula_6, then the system of equations is overdetermined and thus can be unmixed using a conventional linear method. If formula_7, the system is underdetermined and a non-linear method must be employed to recover the unmixed signals. The signals themselves can be multidimensional.

formula_8

The above equation is effectively &#x27;inverted&#x27; as follows. Blind source separation separates the set of mixed signals, formula_9, through the determination of an &#x27;unmixing&#x27; matrix, formula_10, to &#x27;recover&#x27; an approximation of the original signals, formula_11.

formula_12

== Approaches ==
Since the chief difficulty of the problem is its underdetermination, methods for blind source separation generally seek to narrow the set of possible solutions in a way that is unlikely to exclude the desired solution. In one approach, exemplified by principal and independent component analysis, one seeks source signals that are minimally correlated or maximally independent in a probabilistic or information-theoretic sense. A second approach, exemplified by nonnegative matrix factorization, is to impose structural constraints on the source signals. These structural constraints may be derived from a generative model of the signal, but are more commonly heuristics justified by good empirical performance. A common theme in the second approach is to impose some kind of low-complexity constraint on the signal, such as sparsity in some basis for the signal space. This approach can be particularly effective if one requires not the whole signal, but merely its most salient features.

=== Methods ===
There are different methods of blind signal separation:

* Principal components analysis
* Singular value decomposition
* Independent component analysis 
* Dependent component analysis
* Non-negative matrix factorization
* Low-complexity coding and decoding
* Stationary subspace analysis
* Common spatial pattern
* Canonical correlation analysis

<text>Stephen Cole Kleene ( ; January 5, 1909 – January 25, 1994) was an American mathematician. One of the students of Alonzo Church, Kleene, along with Rózsa Péter, Alan Turing, Emil Post, and others, is best known as a founder of the branch of mathematical logic known as recursion theory, which subsequently helped to provide the foundations of theoretical computer science. Kleene&#x27;s work grounds the study of computable functions. A number of mathematical concepts are named after him: Kleene hierarchy, Kleene algebra, the Kleene star (Kleene closure), Kleene&#x27;s recursion theorem and the Kleene fixed-point theorem. He also invented regular expressions in 1951 to describe McCulloch-Pitts neural networks, and made significant contributions to the foundations of mathematical intuitionism.

==Biography==
Kleene was awarded a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Amherst College in 1930. He was awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1934, where his thesis, entitled &quot;A Theory of Positive Integers in Formal Logic&quot;, was supervised by Alonzo Church. In the 1930s, he did important work on Church&#x27;s lambda calculus. In 1935, he joined the mathematics department at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he spent nearly all of his career. After two years as an instructor, he was appointed assistant professor in 1937.

While a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, 1939–1940, he laid the foundation for recursion theory, an area that would be his lifelong research interest. In 1941, he returned to Amherst College, where he spent one year as an associate professor of mathematics.

During World War II, Kleene was a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy. He was an instructor of navigation at the U.S. Naval Reserve&#x27;s Midshipmen&#x27;s School in New York, and then a project director at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C.

In 1946, Kleene returned to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, becoming a full professor in 1948 and the Cyrus C. MacDuffee professor of mathematics in 1964. He served two terms as the Chair of the Department of Mathematics and one term as the Chair of the Department of Numerical Analysis (later renamed the Department of Computer Science). He also served as Dean of the College of Letters and Science in 1969–1974. During his years at the University of Wisconsin he was thesis advisor to 13 Ph.D. students. He retired from the University of Wisconsin in 1979. In 1999 the mathematics library at the University of Wisconsin was renamed in his honor.

Kleene&#x27;s teaching at Wisconsin resulted in three texts in mathematical logic, Kleene (1952, 1967) and Kleene and Vesley (1965). The first two are often cited and still in print. Kleene (1952) wrote alternative proofs to the Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems that enhanced their canonical status and made them easier to teach and understand. Kleene and Vesley (1965) is the classic American introduction to intuitionistic logic and mathematical intuitionism.

Kleene served as president of the Association for Symbolic Logic, 1956–1958, and of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science, 1961. The importance of Kleene&#x27;s work led to Daniel Dennett coining the saying, published in 1978, that &quot;Kleeneness is next to Gödelness.&quot; In 1990, he was awarded the National Medal of Science.

Kleene and his wife Nancy Elliott had four children. He had a lifelong devotion to the family farm in Maine. An avid mountain climber, he had a strong interest in nature and the environment, and was active in many conservation causes.

==Legacy==
At each conference of the Symposium on Logic in Computer Science the Kleene Award, in honour of Stephen Cole Kleene, is given for the best student paper.

<doc id="28809" wikidata="Q102477" url="?curid=28809" title="Shabbat">
<text>Shabbat (, , or ; , , ) or the Sabbath (), also called Shabbos (, ) by Ashkenazim, is Judaism&#x27;s day of rest on the seventh day of the week—i.e., Saturday. On this day, religious Jews remember the biblical stories describing the creation of the heaven and earth in six days and the redemption from slavery and the Exodus from Egypt, and look forward to a future Messianic Age. Since the Jewish religious calendar counts days from sunset to sunset, Shabbat begins in the evening of what on the civil calendar is Friday.

Shabbat observance entails refraining from work activities, often with great rigor, and engaging in restful activities to honor the day. Judaism&#x27;s traditional position is that the unbroken seventh-day Shabbat originated among the Jewish people, as their first and most sacred institution. Variations upon Shabbat are widespread in Judaism and, with adaptations, throughout the Abrahamic and many other religions.

According to &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish religious law), Shabbat is observed from a few minutes before the sun sets on Friday evening until the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night, or an hour after sundown. Shabbat is ushered in by lighting candles and reciting blessings over wine and bread. Traditionally, three festive meals are eaten: The first one is held on Friday evening, the second is traditionally a lunch meal on Saturday, and the third is held later Saturday afternoon. The evening meal and the early afternoon meal typically begin with a blessing called &quot;kiddush&quot; (&quot;sanctification&quot;), said over a cup of wine.

At the third meal a &quot;kiddush&quot; is not performed, but the &quot;hamotzi&quot; blessing is recited and &quot;challah&quot; (braided bread) is eaten. In many communities, this meal is often eaten in the period after the afternoon prayers &quot;(Minchah&quot;) are recited and shortly before Shabbat is formally ended with a &quot;Havdalah&quot; ritual.

Shabbat is a festive day when Jews exercise their freedom from the regular labours of everyday life. It offers an opportunity to contemplate the spiritual aspects of life and to spend time with family. The end of Shabbat is traditionally marked by a ritual called Havdalah, during which blessings are said over wine (or grape juice), aromatic spices, and Havdalah candle lighting, separating Shabbat from the rest of the week.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Shabbat&quot; derives from the Hebrew root . Although frequently translated as &quot;rest&quot; (noun or verb), another accurate translation is &quot;ceasing [from work].&quot; The notion of active cessation from labour is also regarded as more consistent with an omnipotent God&#x27;s activity on the seventh day of creation according to Genesis.

==Origins==

===Babylon===
A cognate Babylonian &quot;Sapattum&quot; or &quot;Sabattum&quot; is reconstructed from the lost fifth Enūma Eliš creation account, which is read as: &quot;&quot;[Sa]bbatu&quot; shalt thou then encounter, mid[month]ly&quot;. It is regarded as a form of Sumerian &quot;sa-bat&quot; (&quot;mid-rest&quot;), rendered in Akkadian as &quot;um nuh libbi&quot; (&quot;day of mid-repose&quot;).

Connection to Sabbath observance has been suggested in the designation of the seventh, fourteenth, nineteenth, twenty-first and twenty-eight days of a lunar month in an Assyrian religious calendar as a &#x27;holy day&#x27;, also called &#x27;evil days&#x27; (meaning &quot;unsuitable&quot; for prohibited activities). The prohibitions on these days, spaced seven days apart (except the nineteenth), include abstaining from chariot riding, and the avoidance of eating meat by the King. On these days officials were prohibited from various activities and common men were forbidden to &quot;make a wish&quot;, and at least the 28th was known as a &quot;rest-day&quot;.

The &quot;Universal Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; advanced a theory of Assyriologists like Friedrich Delitzsch (and of Marcello Craveri) that Shabbat originally arose from the lunar cycle in the Babylonian calendar containing four weeks ending in a Sabbath, plus one or two additional unreckoned days per month. The difficulties of this theory include reconciling the differences between an unbroken week and a lunar week, and explaining the absence of texts naming the lunar week as Sabbath in any language.

===Egypt===
Seventh-day Shabbat did not originate with the Egyptians, to whom it was unknown; and other origin theories based on the day of Saturn, or on the planets generally, have also been abandoned.

===Hebrew Bible===
Sabbath is given special status as a holy day at the very beginning of the Torah in Genesis 2:1-3. It is first commanded after The Exodus from Egypt, in Exodus 16:26 (relating to the cessation of manna) and in Exodus 16:29 (relating to the distance one may travel by foot on the Sabbath), as also in Exodus 20:8-11 (as one of the Ten Commandments). Sabbath is commanded and commended many more times in the Torah and Tanakh; double the normal number of animal sacrifices are to be offered on the day. Sabbath is also described by the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, Amos, and Nehemiah.
The longstanding Jewish position is that unbroken seventh-day Shabbat originated among the Jewish people, as their first and most sacred institution. The origins of Shabbat and a seven-day week are not clear to scholars; the Mosaic tradition claims an origin from the Genesis creation narrative.

The first non-Biblical reference to Sabbath is in an ostracon found in excavations at Mesad Hashavyahu, which has been dated to approximately 630 BCE.

==Status as a Jewish holy day==
The Tanakh and siddur describe Shabbat as having three purposes:
# To commemorate God&#x27;s creation of the universe, on the seventh day of which God rested from (or ceased) his work;
# To commemorate the Israelites&#x27; Exodus and redemption from slavery in ancient Egypt;
# As a &quot;taste&quot; of Olam Haba (the Messianic Age).

Judaism accords Shabbat the status of a joyous holy day. In many ways, Jewish law gives Shabbat the status of being the most important holy day in the Hebrew calendar:
* It is the first holy day mentioned in the Bible, and God was the first to observe it with the cessation of creation (Genesis 2:1–3).
* Jewish liturgy treats Shabbat as a &quot;bride&quot; and &quot;queen&quot; (see Shekhinah); some sources described it as a &quot;king&quot;.
* The Sefer Torah is read during the Torah reading which is part of the Shabbat morning services, with a longer reading than during the week. The Torah is read over a yearly cycle of 54 &quot;parashioth&quot;, one for each Shabbat (sometimes they are doubled). On Shabbat, the reading is divided into seven sections, more than on any other holy day, including Yom Kippur. Then, the Haftarah reading from the Hebrew prophets is read.
* A tradition states that the Jewish Messiah will come if every Jew properly observes two consecutive Shabbatoth.
* The punishment in ancient times for desecrating Shabbat (stoning) is the most severe punishment in Jewish law. In addition, the divine punishment for desecrating Shabbat, &quot;kareth (&quot;spiritual excommunication), is the most severe of divine punishments in Judaism.
* On Shabbat an offering of two lambs was brought in the temple in Jerusalem.

===Welcoming Shabbat===
Honoring Shabbat (&quot;kavod Shabbat&quot;) on Preparation Day (Friday) includes bathing, having a haircut and cleaning and beautifying the home (with flowers, for example).
Days in the Jewish calendar start at nightfall, therefore many Jewish holidays begin at such time. According to Jewish law, Shabbat starts a few minutes before sunset. Candles are lit at this time. It is customary in many communities to light the candles 18 minutes before sundown (&quot;tosefet Shabbat&quot;, although sometimes 36 minutes), and most printed Jewish calendars adhere to this custom.

The Kabbalat Shabbat service is a prayer service welcoming the arrival of Shabbat. Before Friday night dinner, it is customary to sing two songs, one &quot;greeting&quot; two Shabbat angels into the house (&quot;Shalom Aleichem&quot; -&quot;Peace Be Upon You&quot;) and the other praising the woman of the house for all the work she has done over the past week (&quot;Eshet Ḥayil&quot; -&quot;Women Of Valour&quot;). After blessings over the wine and challah, a festive meal is served. Singing is traditional at Sabbath meals. In modern times, many composers have written sacred music for use during the Kabbalat Shabbat observance, including Robert Strassburg and Samuel Adler.

According to rabbinic literature, God via the Torah commands Jews to &quot;observe&quot; (refrain from forbidden activity) and &quot;remember&quot; (with words, thoughts, and actions) Shabbat, and these two actions are symbolized by the customary two Shabbat candles. Candles are lit usually by the woman of the house (or else by a man who lives alone). Some families light more candles, sometimes in accordance with the number of children.

===Other rituals===

Shabbat is a day of celebration as well as prayer. It is customary to eat three festive meals: Dinner on Shabbat eve (Friday night), lunch on Shabbat day (Saturday), and a third meal (a &quot;Seudah shlishit&quot;) in the late afternoon (Saturday). It is also customary to wear nice clothing (different from during the week) on Shabbat to honor the day.

Many Jews attend synagogue services on Shabbat even if they do not do so during the week. Services are held on Shabbat eve (Friday night), Shabbat morning (Saturday morning), and late Shabbat afternoon (Saturday afternoon).

With the exception of Yom Kippur, days of public fasting are postponed or advanced if they coincide with Shabbat. Mourners sitting &quot;shivah&quot; (week of mourning subsequent to the death of a spouse or first-degree relative) outwardly conduct themselves normally for the duration of the day and are forbidden to display public signs of mourning.

Although most Shabbat laws are restrictive, the fourth of the Ten Commandments in Exodus is taken by the Talmud and Maimonides to allude to the &quot;positive&quot; commandments of Shabbat. These include:
* Honoring Shabbat (&quot;kavod Shabbat&quot;): on Shabbat, wearing festive clothing and refraining from unpleasant conversation. It is customary to avoid talking on Shabbat about money, business matters, or secular things that one might discuss during the week.
* Recitation of &quot;kiddush&quot; over a cup of wine at the beginning of Shabbat meals, or at a reception after the conclusion of morning prayers (see the list of Jewish prayers and blessings).
* Eating three festive meals. Meals begin with a blessing over two loaves of bread (&quot;lechem mishneh&quot;, &quot;double bread&quot;), usually of braided challah, which is symbolic of the double portion of manna that fell for the Jewish people on the day before Sabbath during their 40 years in the desert after the Exodus from Ancient Egypt. It is customary to serve meat or fish, and sometimes both, for Shabbat evening and morning meals. &quot;Seudah Shlishit&quot; (literally, &quot;third meal&quot;), generally a light meal that may be pareve or dairy, is eaten late Shabbat afternoon.
* Enjoying Shabbat (&quot;oneg Shabbat&quot;): Engaging in pleasurable activities such as eating, singing, sleeping, spending time with the family, and marital relations. Sometimes referred to as &quot;Shabbating&quot;.
* Recitation of &quot;havdalah&quot;.

===Ending Shabbat===

&quot;Havdalah&quot; (Hebrew: הַבְדָּלָה, &quot;separation&quot;) is a Jewish religious ceremony that marks the symbolic end of Shabbat, and ushers in the new week. At the conclusion of Shabbat at nightfall, after the appearance of three stars in the sky, the &quot;havdalah&quot; blessings are recited over a cup of wine, and with the use of fragrant spices and a candle, usually braided. Some communities delay &quot;havdalah&quot; later into the night in order to prolong Shabbat. There are different customs regarding how much time one should wait after the stars have surfaced until the sabbath technically ends. Some people hold by 72 minutes later and other hold longer and shorter than that.

==Prohibited activities==
Jewish law (halakha) prohibits doing any form of &quot;melakhah&quot; (מְלָאכָה, plural &quot;melakhoth&quot;) on Shabbat, unless an urgent human or medical need is life-threatening. Though &quot;melakhah&quot; is commonly translated as &quot;work&quot; in English, a better definition is &quot;deliberate activity&quot; or &quot;skill and craftmanship&quot;. There are 39 categories of &quot;melakhah&quot;:

* plowing earth
* sowing
* reaping
* binding sheaves
* threshing
* winnowing
* selecting
* grinding
* sifting
* kneading
* baking
* shearing wool
* washing wool
* beating wool
* dyeing wool
* spinning
* weaving
* making two loops
* weaving two threads
* separating two threads
* tying
* untying
* sewing stitches
* tearing
* trapping
* slaughtering
* flaying
* tanning
* scraping hide
* marking hide
* cutting hide to shape
* writing two or more letters
* erasing two or more letters
* building
* demolishing
* extinguishing a fire
* kindling a fire
* putting the finishing touch on an object, and
* transporting an object (between private and public domains, or over 4 cubits within public domain) 

The 39 &quot;melakhoth&quot; are not so much activities as &quot;categories of activity&quot;. For example, while &quot;winnowing&quot; usually refers exclusively to the separation of chaff from grain, and &quot;selecting&quot; refers exclusively to the separation of debris from grain, they refer in the Talmudic sense to any separation of intermixed materials which renders edible that which was inedible. Thus, filtering undrinkable water to make it drinkable falls under this category, as does picking small bones from fish (gefilte fish is one solution to this problem).

The categories of labors prohibited on Shabbat are exegetically derived – on account of Biblical passages juxtaposing Shabbat observance () to making the Tabernacle () – that they are the kinds of work that were necessary for the construction of the Tabernacle. They are not explicitly listed in the Torah; the Mishnah observes that &quot;the laws of Shabbat ... are like mountains hanging by a hair, for they are little Scripture but many laws&quot;. Many rabbinic scholars have pointed out that these labors have in common activity that is &quot;creative&quot;, or that exercises control or dominion over one&#x27;s environment.

In addition to the 39 &quot;melakhot&quot;, additional activities were prohibited by the rabbis for various reasons.

The term &quot;shomer Shabbat&quot; is used for a person (or organization) who adheres to Shabbat laws consistently. The (strict) observance of the Sabbath is often seen as a benchmark for orthodoxy and indeed has legal bearing on the way a Jew is seen by an orthodox religious court regarding their affiliation to Judaism.

===Specific applications===

====Electricity====

Orthodox and some Conservative authorities rule that turning electric devices on or off is prohibited as a &quot;melakhah&quot;; however, authorities are not in agreement about exactly which one(s). One view is that tiny sparks are created in a switch when the circuit is closed, and this would constitute lighting a fire (category 37). If the appliance is purposed for light or heat (such as an incandescent bulb or electric oven), then the lighting or heating elements may be considered as a type of fire that falls under both lighting a fire (category 37) and cooking (i.e., baking, category 11). Turning lights off would be extinguishing a fire (category 36). Another view is that completing an electrical circuit constitutes building (category 35) and turning off the circuit would be demolishing (category 34). Some schools of thought consider the use of electricity to be forbidden only by rabbinic injunction, rather than a &quot;melakhah&quot;.

A common solution to the problem of electricity involves preset timers (Shabbat clocks) for electric appliances, to turn them on and off automatically, with no human intervention on Shabbat itself. Some Conservative authorities reject altogether the arguments for prohibiting the use of electricity. Some Orthodox also hire a &quot;Shabbos goy&quot;, a non-Jew (who must not be regularly employed by the household in question) to perform prohibited tasks (like operating light switches) on Shabbat.

====Automobiles====
Orthodox and many Conservative authorities completely prohibit the use of automobiles on Shabbat as a violation of multiple categories, including lighting a fire, extinguishing a fire, and transferring between domains (category 39). However, the Conservative movement&#x27;s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards permits driving to a synagogue on Shabbat, as an emergency measure, on the grounds that if Jews lost contact with synagogue life, they would become lost to the Jewish people.

A halakhically authorized Shabbat mode added to a power-operated mobility scooter may be used on the observance of Shabbat for those with walking limitations, often referred to as a Shabbat scooter. It is intended only for individuals whose limited mobility is dependent on a scooter or automobile consistently throughout the week.

====Modifications====
Seemingly &quot;forbidden&quot; acts may be performed by modifying technology such that no law is actually violated. In Sabbath mode, a &quot;Sabbath elevator&quot; will stop automatically at every floor, allowing people to step on and off without anyone having to press any buttons, which would normally be needed to work. (Dynamic braking is also disabled if it is normally used, i.e., shunting energy collected from downward travel, and thus the gravitational potential energy of passengers, into a resistor network.) However, many rabbinical authorities consider the use of such elevators by those who are otherwise capable as a violation of Shabbat, with such workarounds being for the benefit of the frail and handicapped and not being in the spirit of the day.

Many observant Jews avoid the prohibition of carrying by use of an eruv. Others make their keys into a tie bar, part of a belt buckle, or a brooch, because a legitimate article of clothing or jewelry may be worn rather than carried. An elastic band with clips on both ends, and with keys placed between them as integral links, may be considered a belt.

Shabbat lamps have been developed to allow a light in a room to be turned on or off at will while the electricity remains on. A special mechanism blocks out the light when the off position is desired without violating Shabbat.

The Shabbos App is a proposed Android app claimed by its creators to enable Orthodox Jews, and all Jewish Sabbath-observers, to use a smartphone to text on the Jewish Sabbath. It has met with resistance from some authorities.

====Permissions====
If a human life is in danger (pikuach nefesh), then a Jew is not only allowed, but required, to violate any halakhic law that stands in the way of saving that person (excluding murder, idolatry, and forbidden sexual acts). The concept of life being in danger is interpreted broadly: for example, it is mandated that one violate Shabbat to bring a woman in active labor to a hospital. Lesser rabbinic restrictions are often violated under much less urgent circumstances (a patient who is ill but not critically so).

Various other legal principles closely delineate which activities constitute desecration of Shabbat. Examples of these include the principle of &quot;shinui&quot; (&quot;change&quot; or &quot;deviation&quot;): A violation is not regarded as severe if the prohibited act was performed in a way that would be considered abnormal on a weekday. Examples include writing with one&#x27;s nondominant hand, according to many rabbinic authorities. This legal principle operates &quot;bedi&#x27;avad&quot; (&quot;ex post facto&quot;) and does not cause a forbidden activity to be permitted barring extenuating circumstances.

===Reform and Reconstructionist views===
Generally, adherents of Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism believe that the individual Jew determines whether to follow Shabbat prohibitions or not. For example, some Jews might find activities, such as writing or cooking for leisure, to be enjoyable enhancements to Shabbat and its holiness, and therefore may encourage such practices. Many Reform Jews believe that what constitutes &quot;work&quot; is different for each person, and that only what the person considers &quot;work&quot; is forbidden. The radical Reform rabbi Samuel Holdheim advocated moving Sabbath to Sunday for many no longer observed it, a step taken by dozens of congregations in the United States in late 19th century.

More rabbinically traditional Reform and Reconstructionist Jews believe that these &quot;halakhoth&quot; in general may be valid, but that it is up to each individual to decide how and when to apply them. A small fraction of Jews in the Progressive Jewish community accept these laws in much the same way as Orthodox Jews.

==Encouraged activities==
The Talmud, especially in tractate Shabbat, defines rituals and activities to both &quot;remember&quot; and &quot;keep&quot; the Sabbath and to sanctify it at home and in the synagogue. In addition to refraining from creative work, the sanctification of the day through blessings over wine, the preparation of special Sabbath meals, and engaging in prayer and Torah study were required as an active part of Shabbat observance to promote intellectual activity and spiritual regeneration on the day of rest from physical creation. According to many scribes, half of the day should be devoted to Torah study and prayer. The Talmud states that the best food should be prepared for the Sabbath, for &quot;one who delights in the Sabbath is granted their heart&#x27;s desires&quot; (BT, Shabbat 118a-b).

All Jewish denominations encourage the following activities on Shabbat:
* Reading, studying, and discussing Torah and commentary, Mishnah and Talmud, and learning some halakha and midrash.
* Synagogue attendance for prayers.
* Spending time with other Jews and socializing with family, friends, and guests at Shabbat meals (&quot;hachnasat orchim&quot;, &quot;hospitality&quot;).
* Singing &quot;zemiroth&quot; or &quot;niggunim&quot;, special songs for Shabbat meals (commonly sung during or after a meal).
* Sex between husband and wife.
* Sleeping.

==Special Shabbat==
Special Shabbatot are the Shabbatot that precede important Jewish holidays: e.g., &quot;Shabbat HaGadol&quot; (Shabbat preceding Pesach), &quot;Shabbat Zachor&quot; (Shabbat preceding Purim), and &quot;Shabbat Shuvah&quot; (Shabbat between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur).

==In other religions==

===Christianity===
Most Christians do not observe Saturday Sabbath, but instead observe a weekly day of worship on Sunday, which is often called the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day&quot;. Several Christian denominations, such as the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Church of God (7th Day), the Seventh Day Baptists, and others, observe seventh-day Sabbath. This observance is celebrated from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset.

===Samaritans===
Samaritans also observe Shabbat.

==Lunar Sabbath==
Some hold the biblical sabbath was not connected to a 7-day week like the Gregorian calendar. Instead the New Moon marks the starting point for counting and the shabbat falls consistently on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, 29th of each month. Biblical text to support using the moon, a light in the heavens, to determine days include Genesis 1:14, Psalm 104:19, and Sirach 43:6–8 See references:
Rabbinic Jewish tradition and practice does not hold of this, holding the sabbath to be based on the days of creation, and hence a wholly separate cycle from the monthly cycle, which does not occur automatically and must be rededicated each month. See kiddush hachodesh.

<doc id="28810" wikidata="Q311526" url="?curid=28810" title="Saki">
<text>Hector Hugh Munro (18 December 1870 – 14 November 1916), popularly known by his pen name Saki and also frequently as H. H. Munro, was a British writer whose witty, mischievous and sometimes macabre stories satirize Edwardian society and culture. He is considered by English teachers and scholars a master of the short story and is often compared to O. Henry and Dorothy Parker. Influenced by Oscar Wilde, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, Munro himself influenced A. A. Milne, Noël Coward and P. G. Wodehouse.

Besides his short stories (which were first published in newspapers, as was customary at the time, and then collected into several volumes), Munro wrote a full-length play, &quot;The Watched Pot&quot;, in collaboration with Charles Maude; two one-act plays; a historical study, &quot;The Rise of the Russian Empire&quot; (the only book published under his own name); a short novel, &quot;The Unbearable Bassington&quot;; the episodic &quot;The Westminster Alice&quot; (a parliamentary parody of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;); and &quot;When William Came&quot;, subtitled &quot;A Story of London Under the Hohenzollerns&quot;, a fantasy about a future German invasion and occupation of Britain.

==Life==
=== Early life ===
Hector Hugh Munro was born in Akyab (now Sittwe), British Burma, which was then part of British India. Saki was the son of Charles Augustus Munro, an Inspector General for the Indian Imperial Police, and his wife, Mary Frances Mercer (1843–1872), the daughter of Rear Admiral Samuel Mercer. Her nephew Cecil William Mercer became a novelist under the name Dornford Yates.

In 1872, on a home visit to England, Mary Munro was charged by a cow, and the shock caused her to miscarry. She never recovered and soon died.

After his wife&#x27;s death Charles Munro sent his three children, Ethel Mary (born April 1868), Charles Arthur (born July 1869) and two-year-old Hector, home to England. The children were sent to Broadgate Villa, in Pilton near Barnstaple, North Devon, to be raised by their grandmother and paternal maiden aunts, Charlotte and Augusta, in a strict and puritanical household. It is said that his aunts were most likely models for some of his characters, notably the aunt in &quot;The Lumber Room&quot; and the guardian in &quot;Sredni Vashtar&quot;: Munro&#x27;s sister Ethel said that the aunt in &quot;The Lumber Room&quot; was an almost perfect portrait of Aunt Augusta. Munro and his siblings led slightly insular lives during their early years and were educated by governesses. At the age of 12 the young Hector Munro was educated at Pencarwick School in Exmouth and then as a boarder at Bedford School.

In 1887, after his retirement, his father returned from Burma and embarked upon a series of European travels with Hector and his siblings.

Hector followed his father in 1893 into the Indian Imperial Police and was posted to Burma, but successive bouts of fever caused his return home after only fifteen months.

===Writing career===

In 1896 he decided to move to London to make a living as a writer.

Munro started his writing career as a journalist for newspapers such as &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot;, the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, &quot;The Morning Post&quot;, and magazines such as the &quot;Bystander&quot; and &quot;Outlook&quot;. His first book, &quot;The Rise of the Russian Empire&quot;, a historical study modelled upon Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, appeared in 1900, under his real name, but proved to be something of a false start.

While writing &quot;The Rise of the Russian Empire&quot;, he made his first foray into short story writing and published a piece called &quot;Dogged&quot; in &quot;St Paul&#x27;s&quot; on February 18, 1899. (Munro&#x27;s sketch &quot;The Achievement of the Cat&quot; appeared the day before in &quot;The Westminster Budget&quot;.) He then moved into the world of political satire in 1900 with a collaboration with Francis Carruthers Gould entitled &quot;Alice in Westminster&quot;. Gould produced the sketches, and Munro wrote the text accompanying them, using the pen name &quot;Saki&quot; for the first time. The series lampooned political figures of the day (&quot;Alice in Downing Street&quot; begins with the memorable line, &quot;&#x27;Have you ever seen an Ineptitude?&#x27;&quot; – referring to a zoomorphised Arthur Balfour), and was published in the Liberal &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot;.

In 1902 he moved to &quot;The Morning Post&quot;, described as one of the &quot;organs of intransigence&quot; by Stephen Koss, to work as a foreign correspondent, first in the Balkans, and then in Russia, where he was witness to the 1905 revolution in St. Petersburg. He then went on to Paris, before returning to London in 1908, where &quot;the agreeable life of a man of letters with a brilliant reputation awaited him&quot;. In the intervening period &quot;Reginald&quot; had been published in 1904, the stories having first appeared in &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot;, and all this time he was writing sketches for &quot;The Morning Post&quot;, the &quot;Bystander&quot; and &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot;. He kept a place in Mortimer Street, wrote, played bridge at the Cocoa Tree Club, and lived simply. &quot;Reginald in Russia&quot; appeared in 1910, &quot;The Chronicles of Clovis&quot; was published in 1911, and &quot;Beasts and Super-Beasts&quot; in 1914, along with other short stories that appeared in newspapers not published in collections in his lifetime.

He also produced two novels, &quot;The Unbearable Bassington&quot; (1912) and &quot;When William Came&quot; (1913).

===Death===
At the start of the First World War Munro was 43 and officially over-age to enlist, but he refused a commission and joined the 2nd King Edward&#x27;s Horse as an ordinary trooper. He later transferred to the 22nd (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (Kensington), in which he was promoted to lance sergeant. More than once he returned to the battlefield when officially too sick or injured. In November 1916 he was sheltering in a shell crater near Beaumont-Hamel, France, during the Battle of the Ancre, when he was killed by a German sniper. According to several sources, his last words were &quot;Put that bloody cigarette out!&quot;

===Legacy===
Munro has no known grave. He is commemorated on Pier and Face 8C 9A and 16A of the Thiepval Memorial.

In 2003 English Heritage marked Munro&#x27;s flat at 97 Mortimer Street, in Fitzrovia with a blue plaque.

After his death, his sister Ethel destroyed most of his papers and wrote her own account of their childhood, which appeared at the beginning of &quot;The Square Egg and Other Sketches&quot; (1924). Rothay Reynolds, a close friend, wrote a relatively lengthy memoir in &quot;The Toys of Peace&quot; (1919), but aside from this, the only other biographies of Munro are &quot;Saki: A Life of Hector Hugh Munro&quot; (1982) by A. J. Langguth, and &quot;The Unbearable Saki&quot; (2007) by Sandie Byrne. All later biographies have had to draw heavily upon Ethel&#x27;s account of her brother&#x27;s life.

In late 2020 two Saki stories, &quot;The Optimist&quot; (1912) and &quot;Mrs. Pendercoet&#x27;s Lost Identity&quot; (1911), which had never been republished, collected, or noted in any academic publication on Saki, were rediscovered; they are now available online.

In 2021, Lora Sifurova, looking through the &quot;Morning Post&quot; and other London periodicals in Russian archives, rediscovered seven sketches and stories attributed to Munro or Saki.

In 2023, Bruce Gaston rediscovered a Clovis sketch, &quot;The Romance of Business&quot;, published as part of an advertisement for Selfridge&#x27;s in a 1914 issue of the &quot;Daily News and Leader&quot;.

===Sexuality===

Munro was homosexual at a time when in Britain sexual activity between men was a crime. The Cleveland Street scandal (1889), followed by the downfall of Oscar Wilde (1895), meant &quot;that side of [Munro&#x27;s] life had to be secret&quot;.

== Pen-name ==
The pen name &quot;Saki&quot; is a reference to the cupbearer in the &quot;Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyam.&quot; Both Rothay Reynolds and Ethel Munro confirm this. Emlyn Williams states as much in his introduction to a Saki anthology published in 1978.

==Selected works==
Much of Saki&#x27;s work contrasts the conventions and hypocrisies of Edwardian England with the ruthless but straightforward life-and-death struggles of nature. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; to mark the centenary of Saki&#x27;s death, Stephen Moss noted, &quot;In many of his stories, stuffy authority figures are set against forces of nature—polecats, hyenas, tigers. Even if they are not eaten, the humans rarely have the best of it&quot;.

===&quot;The Interlopers&quot;===
&quot;The Interlopers&quot; is a story about two men, Georg Znaeym and Ulrich von Gradwitz, whose families have fought over a forest in the eastern Carpathian Mountains for generations. Ulrich&#x27;s family legally owns the land and so considers Georg an interloper when he hunts in the forest. But Georg, believing that the forest rightfully belongs to his family, hunts there often and believes that Ulrich is the real interloper for trying to stop him. One winter night, Ulrich catches Georg hunting in the forest. Neither man can shoot the other without warning, as they would soil their family&#x27;s honour, so they hesitate to acknowledge one another. In an &quot;act of God&quot;, a tree branch suddenly falls on each of them, trapping them both under a log. Gradually they realize the futility of their quarrel, become friends and end the feud. They then call out for their men&#x27;s assistance and, after a brief period, Ulrich makes out nine or ten figures approaching over a hill. The story ends with Ulrich&#x27;s realization that the approaching figures on the hill are actually hungry wolves. The wolves who hunt in packs as opposed to rivalries, it seems, are the true owners of the forest, while both humans are interlopers.

===&quot;Gabriel-Ernest&quot;===
&quot;Gabriel-Ernest&quot; starts with a warning: &quot;There is a wild beast in your woods …&quot; Gabriel, a naked boy sunbathing by the river, is &quot;adopted&quot; by well-meaning townspeople. Lovely and charming, but also rather vague and distant, he seems bemused by his &quot;benefactors.&quot; Asked how he managed by himself in the woods, he replies that he hunts &quot;on four legs,&quot; which they take to mean that he has a dog. The climax comes when a small child disappears while walking home from Sunday school. A pursuit ensues, but Gabriel and the child disappear near a river. The only items found are Gabriel&#x27;s clothes, and the two are never seen again. The story includes many of the author&#x27;s favourite themes: good intentions gone awry, the banality of polite society, the attraction of the sinister, and the allure of the wild and the forbidden. There is also a recognition of basic decency, upheld when the story&#x27;s protagonist &#x27;flatly refuses&#x27; to subscribe to a Gabriel-Ernest memorial, for his supposedly gallant attempt to save a drowning child, and drowning himself, as well. Gabriel-Ernest was actually a werewolf who had eaten the child, then run off.

===&quot;The Schartz-Metterklume Method&quot;===
At a railway station an arrogant and overbearing woman, Mrs Quabarl, mistakes the mischievous Lady Carlotta, who has been inadvertently left behind by a train, for the governess, Miss Hope, whom she has been expecting, Miss Hope having erred about the date of her arrival. Lady Carlotta decides not to correct the mistake, acknowledges herself as Miss Hope, a proponent of &quot;the Schartz-Metterklume method&quot; of making children understand history by acting it out themselves, and chooses the Rape of the Sabine Women (exemplified by a washerwoman&#x27;s two girls) as the first lesson. After creating chaos for two days, she departs, explaining that her delayed luggage will include a leopard cub.

===&quot;The Toys of Peace&quot;===
Preferring not to give her young sons toy soldiers or guns, and having taken away their toy depicting the Siege of Adrianople, Eleanor instructs her brother Harvey to give them innovative &quot;peace toys&quot; as an Easter present. When the packages are opened young Bertie shouts &quot;It&#x27;s a fort!&quot; and is disappointed when his uncle replies &quot;It&#x27;s a municipal dustbin.&quot; The boys are initially baffled as to how to obtain any enjoyment from models of a school of art and a public library, or from little figures of John Stuart Mill, Felicia Hemans and Sir John Herschel. Youthful inventiveness finds a way, however, as the boys combine their history lessons on Louis XIV with a lurid and violent play-story about the invasion of Britain and the storming of the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association. The end of the story has Harvey reporting failure to Eleanor, explaining &quot;We have begun too late,&quot; not realising he was doomed to failure whenever he had begun.

===&quot;The Open Window&quot;===
Framton Nuttel, a nervous man, has come to stay in the country for his health. His sister, who thinks he should socialise while he is there, has given him letters of introduction to families in the neighbourhood whom she got to know during her stay. Framton goes to visit Mrs. Sappleton and, while waiting for her to come down, is entertained by her witty, fifteen-year-old niece. The niece tells him that the French window is kept open, even though it is October, because Mrs. Sappleton believes that her husband and her brothers, who drowned in a bog three years before, will come back one day. When Mrs. Sappleton comes down she talks about her husband and her brothers, and how they are going to come back from shooting soon; Framton, believing that she is deranged, tries to distract her by explaining his health condition. Then, to his horror, Mrs. Sappleton points out that her husband and her brothers are coming, whom he sees walking towards the window with their dog. He thinks he is seeing ghosts and flees. Mrs. Sappleton cannot understand why he has run away and, at her husband and brothers&#x27; arrival, tells them about the odd man who has just left. The niece explains that Framton ran away because of the spaniel: he is afraid of dogs ever since he was hunted by a pack of stray dogs in India and had to spend a night in a newly dug grave with creatures grinning and foaming just above him. The last line summarizes the situation, saying of the niece, &quot;Romance at short notice was her speciality.&quot;

===&quot;The Unrest-Cure&quot;===
Saki&#x27;s recurring hero Clovis Sangrail, a clever, mischievous young man, overhears the complacent middle-aged Huddle complaining of his own addiction to routine and aversion to change. Huddle&#x27;s friend makes the wry suggestion that he needs an &quot;unrest-cure&quot; (the opposite of a rest cure), to be performed, if possible, in the home. Clovis takes it upon himself to &quot;help&quot; the man and his sister by involving them in an invented outrage that will be a &quot;blot on the twentieth century&quot;.

===&quot;Esmé&quot;===
A baroness tells Clovis a story about a hyena that she and her friend Constance encountered while out fox hunting. Later, the hyena follows them, stopping briefly to eat a gypsy child. Shortly after this, the hyena is killed by a motorcar. The baroness immediately claims the corpse as her beloved dog Esmé, and the guilty owner of the car gets his chauffeur to bury the animal and later sends her an emerald brooch to make up for her loss.

===&quot;Sredni Vashtar&quot;===

A sickly child named Conradin is raised by his aunt and guardian, Mrs De Ropp, who &quot;would never... have confessed to herself that she disliked Conradin, though she might have been dimly aware that thwarting him &#x27;for his good&#x27; was a duty which she did not find particularly irksome&quot;. Conradin rebels against his aunt and her choking authority. He invents a religion in which his polecat ferret is imagined as a vengeful deity, and Conradin prays that &quot;Sredni Vashtar&quot; will deliver retribution upon De Ropp. When De Ropp attempts to dispose of the animal, it attacks and kills her. The entire household is shocked and alarmed; Conradin calmly butters another piece of toast.

===&quot;Tobermory&quot;===

At a country-house party, one guest, Cornelius Appin, announces to the others that he has perfected a procedure for teaching animals human speech. He demonstrates this on his host&#x27;s cat, Tobermory. Soon it is clear that animals are permitted to view and listen to many private things on the assumption that they will remain silent, such as the host Sir Wilfred&#x27;s commentary on one guest&#x27;s intelligence and the hope that she will buy his car, or the implied sexual activities of some of the other guests. The guests are angered, especially when Tobermory runs away to pursue a rival cat, but plans to poison him fail when Tobermory is instead killed by the rival cat. &quot;An archangel ecstatically proclaiming the Millennium, and then finding that it clashed unpardonably with Henley and would have to be indefinitely postponed, could hardly have felt more crestfallen than Cornelius Appin at the reception of his wonderful achievement.&quot; Appin is killed shortly afterwards when attempting to teach an elephant in a zoo in Dresden to speak German. His fellow house party guest, Clovis Sangrail (Saki&#x27;s recurring hero), remarks that if he was teaching &quot;the poor beast&quot; irregular German verbs, he deserved no pity.

===&quot;The Bull&quot;===
Tom Yorkfield, a farmer, receives a visit from his half-brother Laurence. Tom has no great liking for Laurence or respect for his profession as a painter of animals. Tom shows Laurence his prize bull and expects him to be impressed, but Laurence nonchalantly tells Tom that he has sold a painting of a different bull, which Tom has seen and does not like, for three hundred pounds. Tom is angry that a mere picture of a bull should be worth more than his real bull. This and Laurence&#x27;s condescending attitude give him the urge to strike him. Laurence, running away across the field, is attacked by the bull, but is saved by Tom from serious injury. Tom, looking after Laurence as he recovers, feels no more rancour because he knows that, however valuable Laurence&#x27;s painting might be, only a real bull like his can attack someone.

===&quot;The East Wing&quot;===
This is a &quot;rediscovered&quot; short story that was previously cited as a play. A house party is beset by a fire in the middle of the night in the east wing of the house. Begged by their hostess to save &quot;my poor darling Eva—Eva of the golden hair,&quot; Lucien demurs, on the grounds that he has never even met her. It is only on discovering that Eva is not a flesh-and-blood daughter but Mrs Gramplain&#x27;s painting of the daughter she wished that she had had, and which she has faithfully updated with the passing years, that Lucien declares a willingness to forfeit his life to rescue her, since &quot;death in this case is more beautiful,&quot; a sentiment endorsed by the Major. As the two men disappear into the blaze, Mrs Gramplain recollects that she &quot;sent Eva to Exeter to be cleaned&quot;. The two men have lost their lives for nothing.

==Radio==
The 5th broadcast of Orson Welles&#x27; series for CBS Radio, &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot;, from 8 August 1938, dramatizes three short stories rather than one long story. The second of the three stories is &quot;The Open Window.&quot;

&quot;The Open Window&quot; is also adapted (by John Allen) in the 1962 Golden Records release &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Ghost Stories for Young People&quot;, a record album of six ghost stories for children.

==Television==
A dramatisation of &quot;The Schartz-Metterklume Method&quot; was an episode in the series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; in 1960.

&quot;Saki: The Improper Stories of H. H. Munro&quot; (a reference to the ending of &quot;The Story Teller&quot;) was an eight-part series produced by Philip Mackie for Granada Television in 1962. Actors involved included Mark Burns as Clovis, Fenella Fielding as Mary Drakmanton, Heather Chasen as Agnes Huddle, Richard Vernon as the Major, Rosamund Greenwood as Veronique and Martita Hunt as Lady Bastable.

Jonathan Pryce read five short stories, “The Music on the Hill”, “Sredni Vashtar”, “The Penance”, “Gabriel-Ernest” and “The Hounds of Fate” as part of the British children&#x27;s supernatural television series &quot;Spine Chillers&quot; broadcast by BBC1 in 1980. 

A dramatisation of &quot;The Open Window&quot; was an episode in the series &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; in 1984. The same story was also adapted as &quot;Ek Khula Hua Darwaza&quot; by Shyam Benegal as an episode in the 1986 Indian anthology television series &quot;Katha Sagar&quot;, which also included the episode &quot;Saboon Ki Tikiya&quot; an adaptation of Munro&#x27;s &quot;Dusk&quot; by Benegal.

&quot;Who Killed Mrs De Ropp?&quot;, a BBC TV production in 2007, starring Ben Daniels and Gemma Jones, showcased three of Saki&#x27;s short stories, &quot;The Storyteller&quot;, &quot;The Lumber Room&quot; and &quot;Sredni Vashtar&quot;.

==Theatre==

<doc id="28811" wikidata="Q1329550" url="?curid=28811" title="Static program analysis">
<text>In computer science, static program analysis (also known as static analysis or static simulation) is the analysis of computer programs performed without executing them, in contrast with dynamic program analysis, which is performed on programs during their execution in the integrated environment. 

The term is usually applied to analysis performed by an automated tool, with human analysis typically being called &quot;program understanding&quot;, program comprehension, or code review. In the last of these, software inspection and software walkthroughs are also used. In most cases the analysis is performed on some version of a program&#x27;s source code, and, in other cases, on some form of its object code.

== Rationale ==
The sophistication of the analysis performed by tools varies from those that only consider the behaviour of individual statements and declarations, to those that include the complete source code of a program in their analysis. The uses of the information obtained from the analysis vary from highlighting possible coding errors (e.g., the lint tool) to formal methods that mathematically prove properties about a given program (e.g., its behaviour matches that of its specification).

Software metrics and reverse engineering can be described as forms of static analysis. Deriving software metrics and static analysis are increasingly deployed together, especially in creation of embedded systems, by defining so-called &quot;software quality objectives&quot;.

A growing commercial use of static analysis is in the verification of properties of software used in safety-critical computer systems and
locating potentially vulnerable code. For example, the following industries have identified the use of static code analysis as a means of improving the quality of increasingly sophisticated and complex software:

# Medical software: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has identified the use of static analysis for medical devices.
# Nuclear software: In the UK the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) recommends the use of static analysis on reactor protection systems.
# Aviation software (in combination with dynamic analysis).
# Automotive &amp; Machines (functional safety features form an integral part of each automotive product development phase, ISO 26262, section 8).

A study in 2012 by VDC Research reported that 28.7% of the embedded software engineers surveyed use static analysis tools and 39.7% expect to use them within 2 years.
A study from 2010 found that 60% of the interviewed developers in European research projects made at least use of their basic IDE built-in static analyzers. However, only about 10% employed an additional other (and perhaps more advanced) analysis tool.

In the application security industry the name static application security testing (SAST) is also used. SAST is an important part of Security Development Lifecycles (SDLs) such as the SDL defined by Microsoft and a common practice in software companies.

== Tool types==

The OMG (Object Management Group) published a study regarding the types of software analysis required for software quality measurement and assessment. This document on &quot;How to Deliver Resilient, Secure, Efficient, and Easily Changed IT Systems in Line with CISQ Recommendations&quot; describes three levels of software analysis.

; Unit Level: Analysis that takes place within a specific program or subroutine, without connecting to the context of that program.
; Technology Level: Analysis that takes into account interactions between unit programs to get a more holistic and semantic view of the overall program in order to find issues and avoid obvious false positives.
; System Level: Analysis that takes into account the interactions between unit programs, but without being limited to one specific technology or programming language. 
A further level of software analysis can be defined.

; Mission/Business Level: Analysis that takes into account the business/mission layer terms, rules and processes that are implemented within the software system for its operation as part of enterprise or program/mission layer activities. These elements are implemented without being limited to one specific technology or programming language and in many cases are distributed across multiple languages, but are statically extracted and analyzed for system understanding for mission assurance.

== Formal methods ==

Formal methods is the term applied to the analysis of software (and computer hardware) whose results are obtained purely through the use of rigorous mathematical methods. The mathematical techniques used include denotational semantics, axiomatic semantics, operational semantics, and abstract interpretation.

By a straightforward reduction to the halting problem, it is possible to prove that (for any Turing complete language), finding all possible run-time errors in an arbitrary program (or more generally any kind of violation of a specification on the final result of a program) is undecidable: there is no mechanical method that can always answer truthfully whether an arbitrary program may or may not exhibit runtime errors. This result dates from the works of Church, Gödel and Turing in the 1930s (see: Halting problem and Rice&#x27;s theorem). As with many undecidable questions, one can still attempt to give useful approximate solutions.

Some of the implementation techniques of formal static analysis include:
* Abstract interpretation, to model the effect that every statement has on the state of an abstract machine (i.e., it &#x27;executes&#x27; the software based on the mathematical properties of each statement and declaration). This abstract machine over-approximates the behaviours of the system: the abstract system is thus made simpler to analyze, at the expense of &quot;incompleteness&quot; (not every property true of the original system is true of the abstract system). If properly done, though, abstract interpretation is &quot;sound&quot; (every property true of the abstract system can be mapped to a true property of the original system).
* Data-flow analysis, a lattice-based technique for gathering information about the possible set of values;
* Hoare logic, a formal system with a set of logical rules for reasoning rigorously about the correctness of computer programs. There is tool support for some programming languages (e.g., the SPARK programming language (a subset of Ada) and the Java Modeling Language—JML—using ESC/Java and ESC/Java2, Frama-C WP (weakest precondition) plugin for the C language extended with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) ).
* Model checking, considers systems that have finite state or may be reduced to finite state by abstraction;
* Symbolic execution, as used to derive mathematical expressions representing the value of mutated variables at particular points in the code.
* Nullable reference analysis

== Data-driven static analysis ==

Data-driven static analysis leverages extensive codebases to infer coding rules and improve the accuracy of the analysis. For instance, one can use all Java open-source packages available on GitHub to learn good analysis strategies. The rule inference can use machine learning techniques. It is also possible to learn from a large amount of past fixes and warnings.

== Remediation ==

Static analyzers produce warnings. For certain types of warnings, it is possible to design and implement automated remediation techniques. For example, Logozzo and Ball have proposed automated remediations for C# &quot;cccheck&quot;.

<doc id="28812" wikidata="Q1484356" url="?curid=28812" title="Samuel Mudd">
<text>Samuel Alexander Mudd Sr. (December 20, 1833 – January 10, 1883) was an American physician who was imprisoned for conspiring with John Wilkes Booth concerning the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.

Mudd worked as a doctor and tobacco farmer in Southern Maryland. The Civil War seriously damaged his business, especially when Maryland abolished slavery in 1864. That year, he first met Booth, who was planning to kidnap Lincoln, and Mudd was seen in company with three of the conspirators. However, his part in the plot, if any, remains unclear.

Booth fatally shot Lincoln on April 14, 1865, but was injured during his escape from the scene. He subsequently rode with conspirator David Herold to Mudd&#x27;s home in the early hours of April 15 for surgery on his fractured leg before he crossed into Virginia. Sometime that day, Mudd must have learned of the assassination but did not report Booth&#x27;s visit to the authorities for another 24 hours. This fact appeared to link him to the crime, as did his various changes of story under interrogation. A military commission found Mudd guilty of aiding and conspiring in a murder, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment, escaping execution by a single vote.

Mudd was pardoned by President Andrew Johnson and released from prison in 1869. Despite repeated attempts by family members and others to have it expunged, his conviction was never overturned.

==Early years==
Born in Charles County, Maryland into a Roman Catholic family, Samuel Mudd was the fourth of 10 children of Henry Lowe and Sarah Ann (Reeves) Mudd. He grew up on Oak Hill, his father&#x27;s tobacco plantation of several hundred acres, which was worked by 89 slaves and was located about southeast of Washington, D.C.

At age 15, after several years of home tutoring, Mudd went off to boarding school at St. John&#x27;s Literary Institute, now known as Saint John&#x27;s Catholic Prep School, in Frederick, Maryland. Two years later, he enrolled at Georgetown College in Washington, D.C. He then studied medicine at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, writing his thesis on dysentery.

Upon graduation in 1856, Mudd returned to Charles County to practice medicine, marrying his childhood sweetheart, Sarah Frances Dyer, one year later.
As a wedding present, Mudd&#x27;s father gave the couple of his best farmland and a new house named St. Catharine. While the house was under construction, the Mudds lived with Frankie&#x27;s bachelor brother, Jeremiah Dyer, finally moving into their new home in 1859. They had nine children in all: four before Mudd&#x27;s arrest and five more after his release from prison. To supplement his income from his medical practice, Mudd became a small-scale tobacco grower, using five slaves according to the 1860 census. Mudd believed that slavery was divinely ordained and wrote a letter to the theologian Orestes Brownson to that effect.

With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Southern Maryland&#x27;s slave system and the economy that it supported rapidly began to collapse. In 1863, the Union Army established Camp Stanton, just from the Mudd farm, to enlist black freedmen and runaway slaves. Six regiments totaling over 8,700 black soldiers, many from Southern Maryland, were trained there. In 1864, Maryland, which was exempt from Lincoln&#x27;s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, abolished slavery, making it difficult for growers like Mudd to operate their plantations. As a result, Mudd considered selling his farm and depending on his medical practice. As Mudd pondered his alternatives, he was introduced to someone who said he might be interested in buying his property: 26 year-old actor John Wilkes Booth.

==Booth connection==
According to a statement made by associated conspirator George Atzerodt, discovered long after his death and recorded while he was in federal custody on May 1, 1865, Mudd knew in advance about Booth&#x27;s plans; Atzerodt was sure the doctor knew, he said, because Booth had &quot;sent (as he told me) liquors and provisions ... about two weeks before the murder to Dr. Mudd&#x27;s.&quot;

Although that is true, some historians believe there may have been other reasons behind Mudd&#x27;s relationship with Booth. The trial brought forth many theories of Mudd&#x27;s involvement in the assassination of Lincoln. One theory posits that Mudd was involved in a completely different conspiracy to gain an upper hand for the southern states. Prior to killing Lincoln, Booth had intended to kidnap the president and ransom him and other political affiliates of the Union for a large sum of money. This plan was in effect until the night of the assassination, when Booth met up with Atzerodt, David Herold, and Lewis Powell and disclosed the plot to assassinate the president instead. Following the assassination, Powell came forth by stating that Booth had not told him until this meeting and that the other men did not know about the plot until the night of the assassination. This supports the theory that Mudd may have been an accomplice to the plot to kidnap the president, but not a conspirator to the assassination.

After Booth shot Lincoln on the night of April 14, 1865, he broke his left fibula when he jumped from the presidential box while fleeing Ford&#x27;s Theater. Booth met up with Herold and both men made for Virginia via southern Maryland. They stopped at Mudd&#x27;s house around 4  on April 15; Mudd splinted Booth&#x27;s leg and gave him a shoe to wear. He also arranged for a carpenter, John Best, to make a pair of crutches for Booth. Booth paid Mudd $25 in greenbacks for his medical treatment. He and Herold spent between twelve and fifteen hours at Mudd&#x27;s house. They slept in the front bedroom on the second floor. It is unclear whether Mudd had yet been informed that Booth had killed Lincoln.

Mudd went to Bryantown during the day on April 15 to run errands; if he had not already heard the news of the assassination from Booth, he certainly learned of it on the trip. He returned home that evening, and accounts differ as to whether Booth and Herold had already left, whether Mudd met them as they were leaving, and whether they left at Mudd&#x27;s urging and with his assistance.

It is certain that Mudd did not immediately contact the authorities. When questioned, he stated that he had not wanted to leave his family alone in the house in case the assassins returned and found him absent and his family unprotected. He waited until Mass the following day, Easter Sunday, when he asked his second cousin, Dr. George Mudd, a resident of Bryantown, to notify the 13th New York Cavalry in Bryantown, under the command of Lieutenant David Dana. Mudd&#x27;s delay in contacting the authorities drew suspicion and was a significant factor in tying him to the conspiracy. During his initial investigative interview on April 18, Mudd stated that he had never seen either of the parties before. In his sworn statement of April 22, he told about Booth&#x27;s visit to Bryantown in November 1864
but then said, &quot;I have never seen Booth since that time to my knowledge until last Saturday morning.&quot; Later testimony from Louis J. Weichmann revealed that Mudd hid his meeting with Booth in Washington in December 1864. In prison, Mudd admitted the Washington meeting and said he ran into Booth by chance during a Christmas shopping trip. Mudd&#x27;s failure to mention the meeting in his interview with detectives proved to be a big mistake: When Weichmann told the authorities of the meeting, they realized that Mudd had misled them and immediately began to treat him as a suspect, rather than a witness.

During the conspiracy trial, Lieutenant Alexander Lovett testified
: &quot;On Friday, the 21st of April, I went to Mudd&#x27;s again, for the purpose of arresting him. When he found we were going to search the house, he said something to his wife, and she went upstairs and brought down a boot. Mudd said he had cut it off the man&#x27;s leg. I turned down the top of the boot, and saw the name &#x27;J. Wilkes&#x27; written in it.&quot;

== Trial ==

After Booth&#x27;s death on April 26, 1865, Mudd was arrested and charged with conspiracy to murder Lincoln. Representative Frederick Stone was the senior defense counsel for Mudd. On May 1, President Johnson ordered the formation of a nine-man military commission to try the conspirators. Mudd was represented by General Thomas Ewing Jr. The trial began on May 10. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, David Herold, Samuel Mudd, Michael O&#x27;Laughlen, Edmund Spangler and Samuel Arnold were all charged with conspiring to murder Lincoln. The prosecution called 366 witnesses.

The defense sought to prove that Mudd was a loyal citizen, citing his self-description as a &quot;Union man&quot; and asserting that he was &quot;a deeply religious man, devoted to family, and a kind master to his slaves.&quot; The prosecution presented witnesses who testified that he had shot one of his slaves in the leg and threatened to send others to Richmond, Virginia, to assist in the construction of Confederate defenses. The prosecution also contended that he had been a member of a Confederate communications distribution agency and had sheltered Confederate soldiers on his plantation, and that he had been a member of a posse which captured runaway slaves and sent them to Richmond. Several of Mudd&#x27;s former slaves testified that he had said on multiple occasions that President Lincoln ought to be shot. An acquaintance named Daniel Thomas also testified that in early 1865 Mudd had predicted that Lincoln and his cabinet &quot;would be killed in six or seven weeks&quot;.

On June 29, Mudd was found guilty with the others. The testimony of Louis J. Weichmann was crucial in obtaining the convictions. According to historian Edward Steers, the testimony presented by former slaves was also crucial, but it faded from public memory. Mudd escaped execution by one vote and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Surratt, Powell, Atzerodt, and Herold were hanged at the Old Penitentiary at the Washington Arsenal on July 7, 1865.

==Imprisonment==
Mudd, O&#x27;Laughlen, Arnold, and Spangler were imprisoned at Fort Jefferson, in the Dry Tortugas, about west of Key West, Florida. The fort housed Union Army deserters and held about 600 prisoners when Mudd and the others arrived. Prisoners lived on the second tier of the fort, in unfinished, open-air gun rooms called casemates. Mudd and his three companions lived in the casemate directly above the fort&#x27;s main entrance, called the sally port. In September 1865, two months after Mudd arrived, the control of Fort Jefferson was transferred from the 161st New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment to the 82nd US Colored Troops.

On September 25, 1865, Mudd attempted to escape from Fort Jefferson by stowing away on the transport &quot;Thomas A. Scott&quot;. He was quickly discovered and placed, along with Arnold, O&#x27;Laughlen, Spangler, and George St. Leger Grenfell, in a large empty ground-level gunroom that soldiers referred to as &quot;the dungeon&quot;. The men were let out of the dungeon every working day for 12 hours and were required to wear leg irons. However, following a December 22 letter from his wife to President Johnson, the War Department ordered the discontinuance of the shackles and the move to better quarters, which was accomplished by January.

After three months in the dungeon, Mudd and the others were returned to the general prison population. However, because of his attempted escape, Mudd lost his privilege of working in the prison hospital and was assigned to work in the prison carpentry shop with Spangler.

There was an outbreak of yellow fever in the fall of 1867 at the fort. O&#x27;Laughlen eventually died of it on September 23. The prison doctor died, and Mudd agreed to take over the position. He was able to help stem the spread of the disease. The soldiers in the fort wrote a petition to Johnson in October 1867 stating the degree of Mudd&#x27;s assistance: &quot;He inspired the hopeless with courage and by his constant presence in the midst of danger and infection... [Many] doubtless owe their lives to the care and treatment they received at his hands.&quot; Probably as a reward for his work in the yellow fever epidemic, Mudd was reassigned from the carpentry shop to a clerical job in the Provost Marshal&#x27;s office, where he remained until his pardon.

==Later life==

The influence of his defense attorney, Thomas Ewing Jr., who had connections in President Johnson&#x27;s administration, was one reason why Mudd was pardoned by Johnson on February 8, 1869. He was released from prison on March 8, 1869, and returned to his home in Maryland on March 20, 1869. On March 2, 1869, three weeks after he pardoned Mudd, Johnson also pardoned Spangler and Arnold.
When Mudd returned home, well-wishing friends and strangers, as well as inquiring newspaper reporters, besieged him. Mudd was very reluctant to talk to the press because he felt it had misquoted him in the past. He gave one interview to the &quot;New York Herald&quot; after his release but immediately regretted it, and complained that the article had several factual errors and misrepresented his work during the yellow fever epidemic. On the whole, though, Mudd continued to enjoy the support of his friends and neighbors. He resumed his medical practice and slowly brought the family farm back to productivity. In 1873, Spangler traveled to the Mudd farm, where Mudd and his wife welcomed him. Spangler lived with the Mudd family for about 18 months, earning his keep by doing carpentry, gardening, and other farm chores, until Spangler&#x27;s death on February 7, 1875.

Mudd always had an interest in politics. In prison, he learned about political happenings by reading the newspapers that were sent to him. After his release, he again became active in community affairs. In 1874, he was elected chief officer of the local farmers association, the Bryantown Grange. In 1876, he was elected vice president of the local Democratic Tilden-Hendricks presidential election committee. Tilden lost that year to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes in a hotly-disputed election. The next year, Mudd ran as a Democratic candidate for the Maryland House of Delegates, but was defeated by the popular Republican William Mitchell.

Mudd&#x27;s ninth child, Mary Eleanor &quot;Nettie&quot; Mudd, was born in 1878. In 1880, the Port Tobacco &quot;Times&quot; reported that Mudd&#x27;s barn which contained almost 8000 lb. of tobacco, two horses, a wagon, and farm implements was destroyed by fire.

==Death==
Mudd was just 49 years old when he died of pneumonia, on January 10, 1883, and was buried in the cemetery at St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church in Bryantown, the same church in which he once met Booth.

==Rehabilitation attempts==

The degree of Samuel Mudd&#x27;s culpability has remained controversial. Some claim that Mudd was innocent of any wrongdoing, including Mudd&#x27;s grandson Richard Mudd, and that he had merely been imprisoned for treating a man who came to his house late at night with a fractured leg. Over a century after the assassination, Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan both wrote letters to Richard Mudd in which they argued that his grandfather had committed no crime. However, others, including authors Edward Steers, Jr. and James Swanson, assert that there is evidence that Samuel Mudd visited Booth three times in the months before the failed kidnapping attempt.

The first time was November 1864 when Booth was looking for help in his kidnapping plot and was directed to Mudd by agents of the Confederate Secret Service. In December, Booth again met with Mudd and spent the night at his farm. Later that December, Mudd went to Washington and introduced Booth to Confederate agent John Surratt. Additionally, George Atzerodt testified that Booth sent supplies to Mudd&#x27;s house in preparation for the kidnapping plan. Mudd lied to the authorities who came to his house after the assassination, claiming that he did not recognize the man who showed up on his doorstep in need of treatment, and giving them false information about where Booth and Herold went. He also hid the monogrammed boot that he had cut off Booth&#x27;s injured leg behind a panel in his attic, but the thorough search of Mudd&#x27;s house soon revealed this further piece of evidence which was later used against him.

Contradicting the above statement that Booth&#x27;s boot was only found after a search is the testimony of Lieutenant Alexander Lovett that Mudd turned the boot over to him, saying he had cut it off of Booth&#x27;s leg. Furthermore, direct trial testimonies of four witnesses during May 17, 1865 report the same thing. The testimonies are as follows:
*William Williams, &quot;She said that the man with the broken leg had left his boot in the bed. She then went and brought the boot down.&quot;
*Simon Gavacan, &quot;His wife then went up stairs and brought down a boot and a razor&quot;. 
*Joshua Lloyd, &quot;Mrs. Mudd brought us the boot, and when the Doctor saw that we had the boot, he admitted that Booth had been there&quot;.
*Lieutenant Alexander Lovett, &quot;It was not until after we had been in the house some minutes, and one of the men said we should have to search the house, that Dr. Mudd told us the boot had been found, and his wife brought it to us&quot;. This direct record of Lt. Lovett&#x27;s testimony differs from the transcripts of Williams (2012).

One hypothesis is that Mudd was originally complicit in the kidnapping plot, likely as the person whom the conspirators would have turned to for medical treatment in case Lincoln was injured, and that Booth thus remembered the doctor and went to his house to get help in the early hours of April 15.
Mudd&#x27;s grandson Richard unsuccessfully tried to clear his grandfather&#x27;s name of the stigma of aiding Booth. In 1951, he published &quot;The Mudd Family of the United States&quot;, a two-volume history of the Mudd family beginning with Thomas Mudd, who arrived from England in 1665. A second edition was published in 1969. His papers detailed his attempts to clear his grandfather&#x27;s name; they were donated to Georgetown University&#x27;s Lauinger Library after his death in 2002. They are available to the public in the Special Collections Department.

In 1992, Representatives Steny Hoyer and Thomas W. Ewing introduced House Bill 1885 to overturn the conviction, but it failed in committee. Mudd then turned to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records, which recommended that the conviction be overturned on the basis that Mudd should have been tried by a civilian court. The recommendation was rejected by Acting Army Assistant Secretary William D. Clark. Mudd attempted several other legal venues, ending in 2003 when the US Supreme Court refused to hear the case because the deadline for filing had been missed.

The Dr. Samuel A. Mudd House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The house on the Booth&#x27;s Escape Scenic Byway is operated today as a historic house museum.

==Portrayals==

Mudd&#x27;s life was the subject of a 1936 film, &quot;The Prisoner of Shark Island&quot;, directed by John Ford and scripted by Nunnally Johnson. Mudd was portrayed by Warner Baxter. Film critic Leonard Maltin in his &quot;Classic Movie Guide&quot; (2015) described Baxter&#x27;s performance as &quot;superb&quot;.

A radio adaptation of &quot;The Prisoner of Shark Island&quot; aired, as an episode of the radio series Lux Radio Theater, with Gary Cooper as Dr. Mudd, on May 2, 1938, in which significant dramatic license was used by introducing fictional characters and altering several of the known facts of the case for melodramatic expediency. For example, Fort Jefferson was never called &quot;Shark Island&quot;.

Another production, with the same title, aired on the radio series Encore Theatre in 1946.

Another film, &quot;The Ordeal of Dr. Mudd&quot;, was made in 1980, starring Dennis Weaver as Mudd. All of these productions espoused the point of view that Mudd was essentially innocent of any conspiracy.

Roger Mudd (1928–2021), an Emmy Award-winning journalist, television host and former CBS, NBC, and PBS news anchor, was related to Samuel Mudd, but he was not a descendant, as has mistakenly been reported.

Samuel Mudd&#x27;s life was the subject of an episode of the TV western &quot;Laramie&quot;, &quot;Time of the Traitor&quot; which aired in 1962.

On the episode &quot;Swiss Diplomacy&quot; on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, the First Lady and cardiac surgeon, Dr. Abby Bartlet commented on the duty of a physician to treat an injured patient despite potential legal repercussions. She responded to Mudd&#x27;s conviction: &quot;So that&#x27;s the way it goes. You set the leg.&quot;

Samuel Mudd&#x27;s name is sometimes given as the origin of the phrase &quot;your name is mud,&quot; as in, for example, the 2007 feature film &quot;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&quot;. However, according to an online etymology dictionary, the phrase has its earliest known recorded instance in 1823, ten years before Mudd&#x27;s birth, and it is based on an obsolete sense of the word &quot;mud&quot; meaning &quot;a stupid twaddling fellow.&quot;

Mudd was portrayed by Matt Walsh in the 2024 Apple TV+ miniseries series &quot;Manhunt&quot;.

<doc id="28814" wikidata="Q170460" url="?curid=28814" title="Secure Shell">
<text>The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH Protocol) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution.

SSH was designed for Unix-like operating systems as a replacement for Telnet and unsecured remote Unix shell protocols, such as the Berkeley Remote Shell (rsh) and the related rlogin and rexec protocols, which all use insecure, plaintext methods of authentication, like passwords.

Since mechanisms like Telnet and Remote Shell are designed to access and operate remote computers, sending the authentication tokens (e.g. username and password) for this access to these computers across a public network in an unsecured way poses a great risk of 3rd parties obtaining the password and achieving the same level of access to the remote system as the telnet user. Secure Shell mitigates this risk through the use of encryption mechanisms that are intended to hide the contents of the transmission from an observer, even if the observer has access to the entire data stream.

Finnish computer scientist Tatu Ylönen designed SSH in 1995 and provided an implementation in the form of two commands, and , as secure replacements for and , respectively. Subsequent development of the protocol suite proceeded in several developer groups, producing several variants of implementation. The protocol specification distinguishes two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2. The most commonly implemented software stack is OpenSSH, released in 1999 as open-source software by the OpenBSD developers. Implementations are distributed for all types of operating systems in common use, including embedded systems.

SSH applications are based on a client–server architecture, connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server. SSH operates as a layered protocol suite comprising three principal hierarchical components: the &quot;transport layer&quot; provides server authentication, confidentiality, and integrity; the &quot;user authentication protocol&quot; validates the user to the server; and the &quot;connection protocol&quot; multiplexes the encrypted tunnel into multiple logical communication channels.

== Definition ==
SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow it to authenticate the user, if necessary.

SSH may be used in several methodologies. In the simplest manner, both ends of a communication channel use automatically generated public-private key pairs to encrypt a network connection, and then use a password to authenticate the user.

When the public-private key pair is generated by the user manually, the authentication is essentially performed when the key pair is created, and a session may then be opened automatically without a password prompt. In this scenario, the public key is placed on all computers that must allow access to the owner of the matching private key, which the owner keeps private. While authentication is based on the private key, the key is never transferred through the network during authentication. SSH only verifies that the same person offering the public key also owns the matching private key.

In all versions of SSH it is important to verify unknown public keys, i.e. associate the public keys with identities, before accepting them as valid. Accepting an attacker&#x27;s public key without validation will authorize an unauthorized attacker as a valid user.

==Authentication: OpenSSH key management==
On Unix-like systems, the list of authorized public keys is typically stored in the home directory of the user that is allowed to log in remotely, in the file codice_1. This file is respected by SSH only if it is not writable by anything apart from the owner and root. When the public key is present on the remote end and the matching private key is present on the local end, typing in the password is no longer required. However, for additional security the private key itself can be locked with a passphrase.

The private key can also be looked for in standard places, and its full path can be specified as a command line setting (the option codice_2 for ssh). The ssh-keygen utility produces the public and private keys, always in pairs.

==Use==

SSH is typically used to log into a remote computer&#x27;s shell or command-line interface (CLI) and to execute commands on a remote server. It also supports mechanisms for tunneling, forwarding of TCP ports and X11 connections and it can be used to transfer files using the associated SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) or Secure Copy Protocol (SCP).

SSH uses the client–server model. An SSH client program is typically used for establishing connections to an SSH daemon, such as sshd, accepting remote connections. Both are commonly present on most modern operating systems, including macOS, most distributions of Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris and OpenVMS. Notably, versions of Windows prior to Windows 10 version 1709 do not include SSH by default, but proprietary, freeware and open source versions of various levels of complexity and completeness did and do exist (see Comparison of SSH clients). In 2018 Microsoft began porting the OpenSSH source code to Windows and in Windows 10 version 1709, an official Win32 port of OpenSSH is now available.

File managers for UNIX-like systems (e.g. Konqueror) can use the FISH protocol to provide a split-pane GUI with drag-and-drop. The open source Windows program WinSCP provides similar file management (synchronization, copy, remote delete) capability using PuTTY as a back-end. Both WinSCP and PuTTY are available packaged to run directly off a USB drive, without requiring installation on the client machine. Crostini on ChromeOS comes with OpenSSH by default. Setting up an SSH server in Windows typically involves enabling a feature in the Settings app.

SSH is important in cloud computing to solve connectivity problems, avoiding the security issues of exposing a cloud-based virtual machine directly on the Internet. An SSH tunnel can provide a secure path over the Internet, through a firewall to a virtual machine.

The IANA has assigned TCP port 22, UDP port 22 and SCTP port 22 for this protocol. IANA had listed the standard TCP port 22 for SSH servers as one of the well-known ports as early as 2001. SSH can also be run using SCTP rather than TCP as the connection oriented transport layer protocol.

==Historical development==
===Version 1===
In 1995, Tatu Ylönen, a researcher at Helsinki University of Technology in Finland designed the first version of the protocol (now called SSH-1) prompted by a password-sniffing attack at his university network. The goal of SSH was to replace the earlier rlogin, TELNET, FTP and rsh protocols, which did not provide strong authentication nor guarantee confidentiality. He chose the port number 22 because it is between codice_3 (port 23) and codice_4 (port 21).

Ylönen released his implementation as freeware in July 1995, and the tool quickly gained in popularity. Towards the end of 1995, the SSH user base had grown to 20,000 users in fifty countries.

In December 1995, Ylönen founded SSH Communications Security to market and develop SSH. The original version of the SSH software used various pieces of free software, such as GNU libgmp, but later versions released by SSH Communications Security evolved into increasingly proprietary software.

It was estimated that by 2000 the number of users had grown to 2 million.

===Version 2===
In 2006, after being discussed in a working group named &quot;secsh&quot;, a revised version of the SSH protocol, SSH-2 was adopted as a standard. This version offers improved security and new features, but is not compatible with SSH-1. For example, it introduces new key-exchange mechanisms like Diffie–Hellman key exchange, improved data integrity checking via message authentication codes like MD5 or SHA-1, which can be negotiated between client and server. SSH-2 also adds stronger encryption methods like AES which eventually replaced weaker and compromised ciphers from the previous standard like 3-des. New features of SSH-2 include the ability to run any number of shell sessions over a single SSH connection. Due to SSH-2&#x27;s superiority and popularity over SSH-1, some implementations such as libssh (v0.8.0+), Lsh and Dropbear eventually supported only the SSH-2 protocol.

===Version 1.99===
In January 2006, well after version 2.1 was established, specified that an SSH server supporting 2.0 as well as prior versions should identify its protocol version as 1.99. This version number does not reflect a historical software revision, but a method to identify backward compatibility.

===OpenSSH and OSSH===
In 1999, developers, desiring availability of a free software version, restarted software development from the 1.2.12 release of the original SSH program, which was the last released under an open source license. This served as a code base for Björn Grönvall&#x27;s OSSH software. Shortly thereafter, OpenBSD developers forked Grönvall&#x27;s code and created OpenSSH, which shipped with Release 2.6 of OpenBSD. From this version, a &quot;portability&quot; branch was formed to port OpenSSH to other operating systems.

, OpenSSH was the single most popular SSH implementation, being the default version in a large number of operating system distributions. OSSH meanwhile has become obsolete. OpenSSH continues to be maintained and supports the SSH-2 protocol, having expunged SSH-1 support from the codebase in the OpenSSH 7.6 release.

=== Future ===

In 2023, an alternative to traditional SSH was proposed under the name SSH3 by PhD student François Michel and Professor Olivier Bonaventure and its code has been made open source. This new version implements the original SSH Connection Protocol but operates on top of HTTP/3, which runs on QUIC. It offers multiple features such as:

* Faster session establishment, reducing the number of Round-trip delays from 5-7 to 3.
* High security: while SSHv2 relies on its own protocols, SSH3 leverages TLS 1.3, QUIC, and HTTP.
* UDP port forwarding
* X.509 certificates
* OpenID Connect

However, the name SSH3 is under discussion, and the project aims to rename itself to a more suitable name. The discussion stems from the fact that this new implementation significantly revises the SSH protocol, suggesting it should not be called SSH3.

==Uses==
SSH is a protocol that can be used for many applications across many platforms including most Unix variants (Linux, the BSDs including Apple&#x27;s macOS, and Solaris), as well as Microsoft Windows. Some of the applications below may require features that are only available or compatible with specific SSH clients or servers. For example, using the SSH protocol to implement a VPN is possible, but presently only with the OpenSSH server and client implementation.
* For login to a shell on a remote host (replacing Telnet and rlogin)
* For executing a single command on a remote host (replacing rsh)
* For setting up automatic (passwordless) login to a remote server (for example, using OpenSSH)
* In combination with rsync to back up, copy and mirror files efficiently and securely
* For forwarding a port
* For tunneling (not to be confused with a VPN, which routes packets between different networks, or bridges two broadcast domains into one).
* For using as a full-fledged encrypted VPN. Note that only OpenSSH server and client supports this feature.
* For forwarding X from a remote host (possible through multiple intermediate hosts)
* For browsing the web through an encrypted proxy connection with SSH clients that support the SOCKS protocol.
* For securely mounting a directory on a remote server as a filesystem on a local computer using SSHFS.
* For automated remote monitoring and management of servers through one or more of the mechanisms discussed above.
* For development on a mobile or embedded device that supports SSH.
* For securing file transfer protocols.

===File transfer protocols===
The Secure Shell protocols are used in several file transfer mechanisms.
* Secure copy (SCP), which evolved from RCP protocol over SSH
* rsync, intended to be more efficient than SCP. Generally runs over an SSH connection.
* SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), a secure alternative to FTP (not to be confused with FTP over SSH or FTPS)
* Files transferred over shell protocol (FISH), released in 1998, which evolved from Unix shell commands over SSH
* Fast and Secure Protocol (FASP), aka &quot;Aspera&quot;, uses SSH for control and UDP ports for data transfer.

==Architecture==
The SSH protocol has a layered architecture with three separate components:
* The &quot;transport layer&quot; () typically uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) of TCP/IP, reserving port number 22 as a server listening port. This layer handles initial key exchange as well as server authentication, and sets up encryption, compression, and integrity verification. It exposes to the upper layer an interface for sending and receiving plaintext packets with a size of up to 32,768 bytes each, but more can be allowed by each implementation. The transport layer also arranges for key re-exchange, usually after 1 GB of data has been transferred or after one hour has passed, whichever occurs first.
* The &quot;user authentication layer&quot; () handles client authentication, and provides a suite of authentication algorithms. Authentication is &quot;client-driven&quot;: when one is prompted for a password, it may be the SSH client prompting, not the server. The server merely responds to the client&#x27;s authentication requests. Widely used user-authentication methods include the following:
** &quot;password&quot;: a method for straightforward password authentication, including a facility allowing a password to be changed. Not all programs implement this method.
** &quot;publickey&quot;: a method for public-key-based authentication, usually supporting at least DSA, ECDSA or RSA keypairs, with other implementations also supporting X.509 certificates.
** &quot;keyboard-interactive&quot; (): a versatile method where the server sends one or more prompts to enter information and the client displays them and sends back responses keyed-in by the user. Used to provide one-time password authentication such as S/Key or SecurID. Used by some OpenSSH configurations when PAM is the underlying host-authentication provider to effectively provide password authentication, sometimes leading to inability to log in with a client that supports just the plain &quot;password&quot; authentication method.
** GSSAPI authentication methods which provide an extensible scheme to perform SSH authentication using external mechanisms such as Kerberos 5 or NTLM, providing single sign-on capability to SSH sessions. These methods are usually implemented by commercial SSH implementations for use in organizations, though OpenSSH does have a working GSSAPI implementation.
* The &quot;connection layer&quot; () defines the concept of channels, channel requests, and global requests, which define the SSH services provided. A single SSH connection can be multiplexed into multiple logical channels simultaneously, each transferring data bidirectionally. Channel requests are used to relay out-of-band channel-specific data, such as the changed size of a terminal window, or the exit code of a server-side process. Additionally, each channel performs its own flow control using the receive window size. The SSH client requests a server-side port to be forwarded using a global request. Standard channel types include:
** &quot;shell&quot; for terminal shells, SFTP and exec requests (including SCP transfers)
** &quot;direct-tcpip&quot; for client-to-server forwarded connections
** &quot;forwarded-tcpip&quot; for server-to-client forwarded connections
* The SSHFP DNS record (RFC 4255) provides the public host key fingerprints in order to aid in verifying the authenticity of the host.

This open architecture provides considerable flexibility, allowing the use of SSH for a variety of purposes beyond a secure shell. The functionality of the transport layer alone is comparable to Transport Layer Security (TLS); the user-authentication layer is highly extensible with custom authentication methods; and the connection layer provides the ability to multiplex many secondary sessions into a single SSH connection, a feature comparable to BEEP and not available in TLS.

==Algorithms==
* EdDSA, ECDSA, RSA and DSA for public-key cryptography.
* ECDH and Diffie–Hellman for key exchange.
* HMAC, AEAD and UMAC for MAC.
* AES (and deprecated RC4, 3DES, DES) for symmetric encryption.
* AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 for AEAD encryption.
* SHA (and deprecated MD5) for key fingerprint.

==Vulnerabilities==
===SSH-1===
In 1998, a vulnerability was described in SSH 1.5 which allowed the unauthorized insertion of content into an encrypted SSH stream due to insufficient data integrity protection from CRC-32 used in this version of the protocol. A fix known as SSH Compensation Attack Detector was introduced into most implementations. Many of these updated implementations contained a new integer overflow vulnerability that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SSH daemon, typically root.

In January 2001 a vulnerability was discovered that allows attackers to modify the last block of an IDEA-encrypted session. The same month, another vulnerability was discovered that allowed a malicious server to forward a client authentication to another server.

Since SSH-1 has inherent design flaws which make it vulnerable, it is now generally considered obsolete and should be avoided by explicitly disabling fallback to SSH-1. Most modern servers and clients support SSH-2.

===CBC plaintext recovery===
In November 2008, a theoretical vulnerability was discovered for all versions of SSH which allowed recovery of up to 32 bits of plaintext from a block of ciphertext that was encrypted using what was then the standard default encryption mode, CBC. The most straightforward solution is to use CTR, counter mode, instead of CBC mode, since this renders SSH resistant to the attack.

===Suspected decryption by NSA===
On December 28, 2014 &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; published classified information leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden which suggests that the National Security Agency may be able to decrypt some SSH traffic. The technical details associated with such a process were not disclosed. A 2017 analysis of the CIA hacking tools &quot;BothanSpy&quot; and &quot;Gyrfalcon&quot; suggested that the SSH protocol was not compromised.

=== Terrapin attack ===

A novel man-in-the-middle attack against most current ssh implementations was discovered in 2023. It was named the Terrapin attack by its discoverers. However, the risk is mitigated by the requirement to intercept a genuine ssh session, and that the attack is restricted in its scope, fortuitously resulting mostly in failed connections. The ssh developers have stated that the major impact of the attack is to degrade the keystroke timing obfuscation features of ssh. The vulnerability was fixed in OpenSSH 9.6, but requires both client and server to be upgraded for the fix to be fully effective.

<doc id="28819" wikidata="Q5532418" url="?curid=28819" title="Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead">
<text>&quot;Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead&quot; is a catchphrase that originated in 1975 during the first season of &quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot; (now called &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, or &quot;SNL&quot;) and which mocked the weeks-long media reports of the impending death of Francisco Franco. It was one of the first catchphrases from the series to enter the general lexicon.

== Origin ==
The death (on November 20, 1975) of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco during the first season of &quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot; originated the phrase. Franco&#x27;s presumed imminent death had been a headline story on NBC News and other news organizations for several weeks. On slow news days, United States network television newscasters sometimes noted that Franco was still alive.

Following Franco&#x27;s death, Chevy Chase, host of &quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot;&#x27;s comedic news segment &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, announced Franco&#x27;s death and read a statement from former president Richard Nixon: &quot;General Franco was a loyal friend and ally of the United States. He earned worldwide respect for Spain through firmness and fairness.&quot; As an ironic counterpoint to this, a picture was displayed behind Chase, showing Franco giving the Roman salute alongside Adolf Hitler.

In subsequent weeks, Chase developed the joke into a parody of the earlier news coverage of Franco&#x27;s illness, treating his death as the top story. &quot;This breaking news just in&quot;, Chase would announce – &quot;Generalissimo Francisco Franco is &quot;still&quot; dead!&quot; Occasionally, Chase would change the wording slightly in attempts to keep the joke fresh, e.g. &quot;Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still valiantly holding on in his fight to remain dead.&quot; The joke was sometimes combined with another running gag in which Garrett Morris, &quot;head of the New York School for the Hard of Hearing&quot; would cup his hands around his mouth and shout the news as Chase read it. The gag ran until early 1977, with occasional callbacks in later seasons.

== Legacy ==
The phrase has remained in use since Franco&#x27;s death. James Taranto&#x27;s &quot;Best of the Web Today&quot; column at OpinionJournal.com used the phrase as a tag for newspaper headlines that indicate something is still happening when it should be obvious. On February 8, 2007, during Jack Cafferty&#x27;s segment on CNN&#x27;s &quot;The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer&quot; on the day of her death, he asked the host: &quot;Is Anna Nicole Smith still dead, Wolf?&quot; It was also used now and then on &quot;NBC News Overnight&quot; in the early 1980s, and Keith Olbermann occasionally used it on &quot;Countdown&quot;. In 2013, it experienced a brief resurgence in a different context, when it began appearing on social media a few days after the death of Spanish filmmaker Jesús Franco.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; used the headline &quot;Generalísimo Francisco Franco Is Still Dead – And His Statues Are Next&quot; on its front page March 2, 2009. The newspaper used it once again on its front page in the headline &quot;Generalísimo Francisco Franco Is Still Dead – But for some not dead enough&quot; on August 21, 2015, when it reported about critics calling to enforce a 2007 anti-Franco law in Madrid and to rename streets and plazas, after the last election had ended the 24-year reign of conservatives in the city council.

Although &quot;SNL&quot;″s use is the most widely known, it is predated by the John Garfield Still Dead&#x27; syndrome,&quot; which originated as a result of extensive coverage in the wake of actor John Garfield&#x27;s death and funeral in 1952.

After a brief &quot;in memoriam&quot; during &quot;SNL&quot;″s 40th Anniversary Special on February 15, 2015, Bill Murray ended the segment with the famous phrase which &quot;just came in from Spain.&quot;

The phrase is listed in &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Catchphrases&quot;.

<text>Edward James &quot;Son&quot; House Jr. (March 21, 1902 – October 19, 1988) was an American Delta blues singer and guitarist, noted for his highly emotional style of singing and slide guitar playing.

After years of hostility to secular music, as a preacher and for a few years also working as a church pastor, he turned to blues performance at the age of 25. He quickly developed a unique style by applying the rhythmic drive, vocal power and emotional intensity of his preaching to the newly learned idiom. In a short career interrupted by a spell in Parchman Farm penitentiary, he developed his musicianship to the point that Charley Patton, the foremost blues artist of the Mississippi Delta region, invited him to share engagements and to accompany him to a 1930 recording session for Paramount Records.

Issued at the start of the Great Depression, the records did not sell and did not lead to national recognition. Locally, House remained popular, and in the 1930s, together with Patton&#x27;s associate Willie Brown, he was the leading musician of Coahoma County. There he was a formative influence on Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters. In 1941 and 1942, House and the members of his band were recorded by Alan Lomax and John W. Work for the Library of Congress and Fisk University. The following year, he left the Delta for Rochester, New York, and gave up music.

In 1964, Alan Wilson, co-founder of the band Canned Heat, found House and had him listen to his old recordings. He encouraged him to find his way back to the music and from this collaboration, &quot;Father of Folk Blues&quot; was born. Wilson even played second guitar on “Empire State Express” and the harp on ”Levee Camp Moan”. Son&#x27;s manager Dick Waterman said,” Al Wilson helped Son House find Son House”. He relearned his repertoire and established a career as an entertainer, performing for young, mostly white audiences in coffeehouses, at folk festivals and on concert tours during the American folk music revival, billed as a &quot;folk blues&quot; singer. He recorded several albums and some informally taped concerts have also been issued as albums. In 2017, his single &quot;Preachin&#x27; the Blues&quot; was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===

House was born in the hamlet of Lyon, north of Clarksdale, Mississippi, the second of three brothers, and lived in the rural Mississippi Delta until his parents separated when he was about seven or eight years old. His father, Eddie House Sr., was a musician, playing the tuba in a band with his brothers and sometimes playing the guitar. He was a church member but also a drinker; he left the church for a time as a result of his drinking, but then gave up alcohol and became a Baptist deacon. Young Eddie House adopted the family commitment to religion and churchgoing. He also absorbed the family love of music but confined himself to singing, showing no interest in the family instrumental band, and hostile to the blues on religious grounds.

When House&#x27;s parents separated, his mother took him to Tallulah, Louisiana, across the Mississippi River from Vicksburg, Mississippi. When he was in his early teens, they moved to Algiers, New Orleans. Recalling these years, he would later speak of his hatred of blues and his passion for churchgoing (he described himself as &quot;churchy&quot; and &quot;churchified&quot;). At fifteen, probably while living in Algiers, he began preaching sermons.

At the age of nineteen, while living in the Delta, he married Carrie Martin, an older woman from New Orleans. This was a significant step for House; he married in church and against family opposition. The couple moved to her hometown of Centerville, Louisiana to help run her father&#x27;s farm. After a couple of years, feeling used and disillusioned, House recalled, &quot;I left her hanging on the gatepost, with her father tellin&#x27; me to come back so we could plow some more.&quot; Around the same time, probably 1922, House&#x27;s mother died. In later years, he was still angry about his marriage and said of Carrie, &quot;She wasn&#x27;t nothin&#x27; but one of them New Orleans whores&quot;.

House&#x27;s resentment of farming extended to the many menial jobs he took as a young adult. He moved frequently, on one occasion taking off to East Saint Louis to work in a steel plant. The one job he enjoyed was on a Louisiana horse ranch, which later he celebrated by wearing a cowboy hat in his performances. He found an escape from manual labor when, following a conversion experience (&quot;getting religion&quot;) in his early twenties, he was accepted as a paid pastor, first in the Baptist Church and then in the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church. However, he fell into habits which conflicted with his calling, drinking like his father and probably also womanizing. This led him, after several years of conflict, to leave the church, ceasing his full-time commitment although he continued to preach sermons from time to time.

===Blues performer===

In 1927, at the age of 25, House underwent a change of musical perspective as rapid and dramatic as a religious conversion. In a hamlet south of Clarksdale, he heard one of his drinking companions, either James McCoy or Willie Wilson (his recollections differed), playing bottleneck guitar, a style he had never heard before. He immediately changed his attitude about the blues, bought a guitar from a musician called Frank Hoskins and within weeks was playing with Hoskins, McCoy and Wilson. Two songs he learned from McCoy would later be among his best known, &quot;My Black Mama&quot; and &quot;Preachin&#x27; the Blues&quot;. Another source of inspiration was Rube Lacey, a much better known performer who had recorded for Columbia Records in 1927 (no titles were released) and for Paramount Records in 1928 (two titles were released). In an astonishingly short time, with only these four musicians as models, House developed to a professional standard a blues style based on his religious singing and simple bottleneck guitar style.

Around 1927 or 1928, he had been playing in a juke joint when a man went on a shooting spree, wounding House in the leg, and he allegedly shot the man dead. House received a 15-year sentence at the Mississippi State Penitentiary (Parchman Farm), of which he served two years between 1928 and 1929. He credited his re-examination and release to an appeal by his family, but also spoke of the intervention by the influential white planter for whom they worked. The date of the killing and the duration of his sentence are unclear; House gave different accounts to different interviewers, and searches by his biographer Daniel Beaumont found no details in the court records of Coahoma County or in the archive of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.

Upon his release in 1929 or early 1930, House was strongly advised to leave Clarksdale and stay away. He walked to Jonestown and caught a train to the small town of Lula, Mississippi, sixteen miles north of Clarksdale and eight miles from the blues hub of Helena, Arkansas. Coincidentally, the great star of Delta blues, Charley Patton, was also in virtual exile in Lula, having been expelled from his base on the Dockery Plantation. With his partner Willie Brown, Patton dominated the local market for professional blues performance. Patton watched House busking when he arrived penniless at Lula station, but did not approach him. He observed House&#x27;s showmanship attracting a crowd to the café and bootleg whiskey business of a woman called Sara Knight. Patton invited House to be a regular musical partner with him and Brown. House formed a liaison with Knight, and both musicians profited from association with her bootlegging activities. The musical partnership is disputed by Patton&#x27;s biographers Stephen Calt and Gayle Dean Wardlow. They consider that House&#x27;s musicianship was too limited to play with Patton and Brown, who were also rumoured to be estranged at the time. They also cite one statement by House that he did not play for dances in Lula. Beaumont concluded that House became a friend of Patton&#x27;s, traveling with him to gigs but playing separately.

=== Recording ===
In 1930, Art Laibly of Paramount Records traveled to Lula to persuade Patton to record several more sides in Grafton, Wisconsin. Along with Patton came House, Brown, and the pianist Louise Johnson, all of whom recorded sides for the label. House recorded nine songs during that session, eight of which were released, but they were commercial failures. He did not record again commercially for 35 years, but he continued to play with Patton and Brown, and with Brown after Patton&#x27;s death in 1934. During this time, House worked as a tractor driver for various plantations in the Lake Cormorant area.

Alan Lomax recorded House for the Library of Congress in 1941. Willie Brown, the mandolin player Fiddlin&#x27; Joe Martin, and the harmonica player Leroy Williams played with House on these recordings. Lomax returned to the area in 1942, where he recorded House once more.

House then faded from the public view, moving to Rochester, New York, in 1943, and working as a railroad porter for the New York Central Railroad and as a chef.

=== Rediscovery ===
In 1964, after a long search of the Mississippi Delta region by Nick Perls, Dick Waterman and Phil Spiro, House was &quot;rediscovered&quot; in Rochester, New York working at a train station. He had been retired from the music business for many years and was unaware of the 1960s folk blues revival and international enthusiasm for his early recordings.

He subsequently toured extensively in the United States and Europe and recorded for CBS Records. Like Mississippi John Hurt, he was welcomed into the music scene of the 1960s and played at the Newport Folk Festival in 1964, the New York Folk Festival in July 1965, and the October 1967 European tour of the American Folk Festival, along with Skip James and Bukka White.

The young guitarist Alan Wilson (later of Canned Heat) was a fan of House&#x27;s. The producer John Hammond asked Wilson, who was just 22 years old, to teach &quot;Son House how to play like Son House,&quot; because Wilson had such a good knowledge of blues styles. House subsequently recorded the album &quot;Father of Folk Blues&quot;, later reissued as a 2-CD set &quot;Father of Delta Blues: The Complete 1965 Sessions&quot;. House performed with Wilson live, as can be heard on &quot;Levee Camp Moan&quot; on the album &quot;John the Revelator: The 1970 London Sessions&quot;.

House appeared in Seattle on March 19, 1968, arranged by the Seattle Folklore Society. The concert was recorded by Bob West and issued on Acola Records as a CD in 2006. The Arcola CD also included an interview of House recorded on November 15, 1969 in Seattle.

In the summer of 1970, House toured Europe once again, including an appearance at the Montreux Jazz Festival; a recording of his London concerts was released by Liberty Records. He also played at the Two Days of Blues Festival in Toronto in 1974. On an appearance on the TV arts show &quot;Camera Three&quot;, he was accompanied by the blues guitarist Buddy Guy.

Ill health plagued House in his later years, and in 1974 he retired once again. He later moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he remained until his death from cancer of the larynx. He had been married five times and had two daughters, Beatrice and Sally. He was buried at the Mt. Hazel Cemetery. Members of the Detroit Blues Society raised money through benefit concerts to put a monument on his grave.

==Honors==
In 2007, House was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Tunica, Mississippi.

In 2017, his single &quot;Preachin&#x27; the Blues&quot; was inducted in to the Blues Hall of Fame.

<doc id="28822" wikidata="Q852857" url="?curid=28822" title="Sex worker">
<text>A sex worker is a person who provides sex work, either on a regular or occasional basis. The term is used in reference to those who work in all areas of the sex industry. According to one view, sex work is voluntary &quot;and is seen as the commercial exchange of sex for money or goods&quot;. Thus it differs from sexual exploitation, or the forcing of a person to commit sexual acts.

== Terminology ==

The term &quot;sex worker&quot; was coined in 1978 by sex worker activist Carol Leigh. Its use became popularized after publication of the anthology, &quot;Sex Work: Writings By Women In The Sex Industry&quot; in 1987, edited by Frédérique Delacoste and Priscilla Alexander. The term &quot;sex worker&quot; has since spread into much wider use, including in academic publications, by NGOs and labor unions, and by governmental and intergovernmental agencies, such as the World Health Organization. The term is listed in the Oxford English Dictionary and Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Dictionary.

The term &quot;sex worker&quot; is used by some types of sex workers (i.e. prostitutes) to avoid invoking the stigma associated with the word &quot;prostitute&quot;. Using the term &quot;sex worker&quot; rather than &quot;prostitute&quot; also allows more members of the sex industry to be represented and helps ensure that individuals who are actually prostitutes are not singled out and associated with the negative connotations of &quot;prostitute&quot;. In addition, choosing to use the term &quot;sex worker&quot; rather than &quot;prostitute&quot; shows ownership over the individuals&#x27; career choices. Some argue that those who prefer the term &quot;sex worker&quot; wish to separate their occupation from their person. Describing someone as a sex worker recognizes that the individual may have many different facets, and are not necessarily defined by their job.

The term is strongly opposed, however, by many who are morally or politically opposed to the sex industry, such as social conservatives, anti-prostitution feminists, and other prohibitionists. Such groups view prostitution variously as a crime or as victimization, and see the term &quot;sex work&quot; as legitimizing criminal activity or exploitation as a type of labor.

== In practice ==
Sex work can take the form of prostitution, stripping or lap dancing, performance in pornography, phone or internet sex, or any other exchange of sexual services for financial or material gain. Sex workers who include sexual intercourse as part of their services are considered full-service sex workers. The variety in the tasks encompassed by sex work leads to a large range in both severity and nature of risks that sex workers face in their occupations. Sex workers can act independently as individuals, work for a company or corporation, or work as part of a brothel. All of the above can be undertaken either by free choice or by coercion, or, as some argue, along a continuum between conflict and agency. Sex workers may also be hired to be companions on a trip or to perform sexual services within the context of a trip; either of these can be voluntary or forced labor.

=== Motivations ===
Sex workers may be any gender and exchange sexual services or favors for money or other gifts. The motives of sex workers vary widely and can include debt, coercion, survival, or simply as a way to earn a living. Sexual empowerment is another possible reason why people engage in sex work. One Canadian study found that a quarter of the sex workers interviewed started sex work because they found it &quot;appealing&quot;. The flexibility to choose hours of work and the ability to select one&#x27;s own client base may also contribute to the appeal of sex work when compared to other service industry jobs. Sex work may also be a way to fund addiction. This line of work can be fueled by an individual&#x27;s addiction to illegal substances before entering the industry or being introduced to these substances after entering the industry.

For camming services, motivations can vary when engaging in sex with real-life versus virtual partners. A 2023 study found that sex workers providing camming services were more likely to engage in sex with virtual partners for resources and specific types of sexual experiences (e.g., kink). In contrast, they engaged in sex more often with real-life partners for physical pleasure, motivated by the physical desirability of their partner, and to express love and commitment. However, for many other motivations, such as stress reduction, self-esteem boost, emotional expression, or utilitarian reasons, there were no significant differences in frequency of engagement with real-life versus virtual partners.

These motives also align with varying climates surrounding sex work in different communities and cultures. In some cases, sex work is linked to tourism.

Transgender people are more likely than the general population to do sex work, particularly trans women and trans people of color. In a study of female Indian sex workers, illiteracy and lower social status were more prevalent than among the general female population.

One study of sex work in Tijuana, Mexico, found that the majority of sex workers there are young, female, and heterosexual. Many of these studies attempt to use smaller samples of sex workers and pimps in order to extrapolate about larger populations of sex workers. One report on the underground sex trade in the United States used known data on the illegal drug and weapon trades and interviews with sex workers and pimps in order to draw conclusions about the number of sex workers in eight American cities. However, studies like this one can come under scrutiny for a perceived emphasis on the activities and perspectives of pimps and other sex work managers rather than those of sex work providers themselves. Another criticism is that sex trafficking may not be adequately assessed in relation to sex work in these studies.

Many studies struggle to gain demographic information about the prevalence of sex work, as many countries or cities have laws prohibiting prostitution or other sex work. In addition, sex trafficking, or forced sex work, is also difficult to quantify due to its underground and covert nature. In addition, finding a representative sample of sex workers in a given city can be nearly impossible because the size of the population itself is unknown. Maintaining privacy and confidentiality in research is also difficult because many sex workers may face prosecution and other consequences if their identities are revealed.

==Discrimination==
Sex workers may be stereotyped as deviant, hypersexual, sexually risky, and substance abusive. Sex workers may cope with this stigmatization in ways such as hiding their occupation from non-sex workers, social withdrawal, and creating a false self to perform at work. Sex-work-related stigma may help perpetuate rape culture and can lead to slut-shaming.

Sex work is also often conflated with sex trafficking, despite the fact that most sex workers choose to consensually engage in the sex trade. For example, the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act in the United States was passed to ostensibly protect victims of sex trafficking but included language making it illegal to advertise consensual sex online. Such laws have a significantly negative impact on sex workers.

Globally, sex workers encounter barriers in accessing health care, legislation, legal resources, and labor rights. In a study of U.S. sex workers, 43% of interview participants reported exposure to intimate partner violence, physical violence, armed physical violence, and sexual violence in the forms of sexual coercion and rape. In this same study, a sex worker reported, &quot;in this lifestyle, nothing&#x27;s safe&quot;. Sex workers may experience police abuse as well, as the police may use their authority to intimidate sex workers. Police officers in some countries have been reported to exploit street-based sex workers&#x27; fear of incarceration to force them to have sex with the police without payment, sometimes still arresting them after having coerced sex. Police may also compromise sex workers&#x27; safety, often holding sex workers responsible for crimes perpetrated against them because of the stigma attached to their occupation. There is growth in advocacy organizations to reduce and erase prejudice and stigma against sex work, and to provide more support and resources for sex workers.

== Legal dimensions of sex work ==

Depending on local law, sex workers&#x27; activities may be regulated, controlled, tolerated, or prohibited. In most countries, even those where sex work is legal, sex workers may be stigmatized and marginalized, which may prevent them from seeking legal redress for discrimination (e.g., racial discrimination by a strip club owner), non-payment by a client, assault or rape. Sex worker advocates have identified this as whorephobia.

The legality of different types of sex work varies within and between regions of the world. For example, while pornography is legal in the United States, prostitution is illegal in most parts of the US. However, in other regions of the world, both pornography and prostitution are illegal; in others, both are legal. One example of a country in which pornography, prostitution, and all professions encompassed under the umbrella of sex work are all legal is New Zealand. Under the Prostitution Reform Act of New Zealand, laws and regulations have been put into place in order to ensure the safety and protection of its sex workers. For example, since the implementation of the Prostitution Reform Act, &quot;any person seeking to open a larger brothel, where more than four sex workers will be working requires a Brothel Operators Certificate, which certifies them as a suitable person to exercise control over sex workers in the workplace. [In addition,] sex workers operating in managed premises have access to labour rights and human rights protection and can pursue claims before the courts, like any other worker or employee.&quot; In regions where sex work is illegal, advocates for sex workers&#x27; rights argue that the covert nature of illegal prostitution is a barrier to access to legal resources. However, some who oppose the legalization of prostitution argue that sex work is inherently exploitative and can never be legalized or practiced in a way that respects the rights of those who perform it.

There are many arguments against legalizing prostitution/sex work. In one study, women involved in sex work were interviewed and asked if they thought it should be made legal. They answered that they thought it should not, as it would put women at higher risk from violent customers if it were considered legitimate work, and they would not want their friends or family entering the sex industry to earn money. Another argument is that legalizing sex work would increase the demand for it, and women should not be treated as sexual merchandise. A study showed that in countries that have legalized prostitution, there was an increase in human trafficking. The studies also showed that legalizing sex work led to an increase in sex trafficking, which is another reason people give for making sex work illegal. An argument against legalizing sex work is to keep children from being involved in this industry. Children who have been exploited suffer long-term negative consequences.

There are also arguments for legalizing prostitution/sex work. One major argument for legalizing prostitution is that women should have a right to do what they want with their own bodies. The government should not have a say in what they do for work, and if they want to sell their bodies it is their own decision. Another common argument for legalizing prostitution is that enforcing prostitution laws is a waste of money. Some believe prostitution will continue to persist despite whatever laws and regulations are implemented against it. In arguing for the decriminalization of sex work, the Minister of Justice of the Netherlands expanded upon this argument in court when stating that, &quot;prostitution has existed for a long time and will continue to do so…Prohibition is not the way to proceed…One should allow for voluntary prostitution. The authorities can then regulate prostitution, [and] it can become healthy, safe, transparent, and cleansed from criminal side-effects.&quot; People who wish to legalize prostitution do not see enforcing laws against sex work as effective and think the money is better spent elsewhere. Many people also argue that legalization of prostitution will lead to less harm for the sex workers. They argue that the decriminalization of sex work will decrease the exploitation of sex workers by third parties such as pimps and managers. A final argument for the legalization of sex work is that prostitution laws are unconstitutional. Some argue that these laws go against people&#x27;s rights to free speech and privacy.

== Risk reduction ==
Risk reduction in sex work is a highly debated topic. &quot;Abolitionism&quot; and &quot;nonabolitionism&quot; or &quot;empowerment&quot; are regarded as opposing ways in which risk reduction is approached. While abolitionism would call for an end to all sex work, empowerment would encourage the formation of networks among sex workers and enable them to prevent STIs and other health risks by communicating with each other. Both approaches aim to reduce rates of disease and other negative effects of sex work.

In addition, sex workers themselves have disputed the dichotomous nature of abolitionism and nonabolitionism, advocating instead a focus on sex workers&#x27; rights. In 1999, the Network of Sex Worker Projects claimed that &quot;Historically, anti-trafficking measures have been more concerned with protecting &#x27;innocent&#x27; women from becoming prostitutes than with ensuring the human rights of those in the sex industry. Penelope Saunders, a sex workers&#x27; rights advocate, claims that the sex workers&#x27; rights approach considers more of the historical context of sex work than either abolitionism or empowerment. In addition, Jo Doezema has written that the dichotomy of the voluntary and forced approaches to sex work has served to deny sex workers agency.

=== Health ===
Sex workers are unlikely to disclose their work to healthcare providers. This can be due to embarrassment, fear of disapproval, or a disbelief that sex work can have effects on their health. The criminalization of sex work in many places can also lead to a reluctance to disclose for fear of being turned in for illegal activities. There are very few legal protections for sex workers due to criminalization; thus, in many cases, a sex worker reporting violence to a healthcare provider may not be able to take legal action against their aggressor.

Health risks of sex work relate primarily to sexually transmitted infections and to drug use. In one study, nearly 40% of sex workers who visited a health center reported illegal drug use. In general, transgender women sex workers have a higher risk of contracting HIV than cisgender male and female sex workers and transgender women who are not sex workers.

The reason transgender women are at higher risk for developing HIV is their combination of risk factors. They face biological, personal, relational, and structural risks that all increase their chances of getting HIV. Biological factors include incorrect condom usage because of erectile dysfunction from hormones taken to become more feminine and receptive anal intercourse without a condom which is a high risk for developing HIV. Personal factors include mental health issues that lead to increased sexual risk, such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse provoked through lack of support, violence, etc. Structural risks include involvement in sex work being linked to poverty, substance abuse, and other factors that are more prevalent in transgender women based on their tendency to be socially marginalized and not accepted for challenging gender norms. The largest risk for HIV is unprotected sex with male partners, and studies have been emerging that show men who have sex with transgender women are more likely to use drugs than men that do not.

Condom use is one way to mitigate the risk of contracting an STI. However, negotiating condom use with one&#x27;s clients and partners is often an obstacle to practicing safer sex. While there is not much data on rates of violence against sex workers, many sex workers do not use condoms due to the fear of resistance and violence from clients. Some countries also have laws prohibiting condom possession; this reduces the likelihood that sex workers will use condoms. Increased organization and networking among sex workers has been shown to increase condom use by increasing access to and education about STI prevention. Brothels with strong workplace health practices, including the availability of condoms, have also increased condom use among their workers.

====Health concerns of exotic dancers====
In order to protect themselves from the stigma of sex work, many dancers resort to othering themselves. Othering involves constructing oneself as superior to one&#x27;s peers, and the dancer persona provides an internal boundary that separates the &quot;authentic&quot; from the stripper self. This practice creates a significant amount of stress for the dancers, in turn leading many to resort to using drugs and alcohol to cope. Since it is so widespread, the use of drugs has become normalized in the exotic dance scene. 

Despite this normalization, passing as nonusers, or covering as users of less maligned drugs, is necessary. This is because strippers concurrently attribute a strong moral constitution to those that resist the drug atmosphere; it is a testament to personal strength and willpower. It is also an occasion for dancers to &quot;other&quot; fellow strippers. Valorizing resistance to the drug space discursively positions &quot;good&quot; strippers against such a drug locale and indicates why dancers are motivated to closet hard drug use.&lt;br&gt;Stigma causes strippers to hide their lifestyles from friends and family alienating themselves from a support system. Further, the stress of trying to hide their lifestyles from others due to fear of scrutiny affects the mental health of dancers.

=== Forced sex work ===

Forced sex work is when an individual enters into any sex trade due to coercion rather than by choice. Forced sex work increases the likelihood that a sex worker will contract HIV/AIDS or another sexually transmitted infection, particularly when an individual enters sex work before the age of 18. In addition, even when sex workers do consent to certain sex acts, they are often forced or coerced into others (often anal intercourse) by clients. Sex workers may also experience strong resistance to condom use by their clients, which may extend into a lack of consent by the worker to any sexual act performed in the encounter; this risk is magnified when sex workers are trafficked or forced into sex work.

Forced sex work often involves deception - workers are told that they can make a living and are then not allowed to leave. This deception can cause ill effects on the mental health of many sex workers. In addition, an assessment of studies estimates that between 40% and 70% of sex workers face violence within a year. Currently, there is little support for migrant workers in many countries, including those who have been trafficked to a location for sex.

== Advocacy ==
Sex worker&#x27;s rights advocates argue that sex workers should have the same basic human and labor rights as other working people. For example, the Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour calls for the legalization of sex work, the elimination of state regulations that are more repressive than those imposed on other workers and businesses, the right to recognition and protection under labour and employment laws, the right to form and join professional associations or unions, and the right to legally cross borders to work. Advocates also want to see changes in legal practices involving sex work, the Red Umbrella Project has pushed for the decriminalization of condoms and changes to New York&#x27;s sex workers diversion program. Advocacy for the interests of sex workers can come from a variety of sources, including non-governmental organizations, labor rights organizations, governments, or sex workers themselves. In Latin America and the Caribbean, sex worker advocacy dates back to the late 19th century in Havana, Cuba. A catalyst in the movement being a newspaper published by Havana sex workers. This publication went by the name &quot;La Cebolla&quot;, created by Las Horizontales. Each year in London, The Sexual Freedom Awards is held to honor the most notable advocates and pioneers of sexual freedom and sex workers&#x27; rights in the UK, where sex work is essentially legal.

=== Unionization of sex work ===
The unionization of sex workers is a recent development. The first organization within the contemporary sex workers&#x27; rights movement was Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics (COYOTE), founded in 1973 in San Francisco, California. Many organizations in Western countries were established in the decade after the founding of COYOTE. Currently, a small number of sex worker unions exist worldwide. One of the largest is the International Union of Sex Workers, headquartered in the United Kingdom. The IUSW advocates for the rights of all sex workers, whether they chose freely or were coerced to enter the trade, and promotes policies that benefit the interests of sex workers both in the UK and abroad. Many regions are home to sex worker unions, including Latin America, Brazil, Canada, Europe, and Africa.

In unionizing, many sex workers face issues relating to communication and to the legality of sex work. Because sex work is illegal in many places where they wish to organize, it is difficult to communicate with other sex workers in order to organize. There is also concern with the legitimacy of sex work as a career and an activity that merits formal organizing, largely because of the sexism often present in sex work and the devaluation of sex work as not comparable to other paid labor and employment.

A factor affecting the unionization of sex work is that many sex workers belong to populations that historically have not had a strong representation in labor unions. While this unionization can be viewed as a way of empowering sex workers and granting them agency within their profession, it is also criticized as implicitly lending its approval to sexism and power imbalances already present in sex work. Unionization also implies a submission to or operation within the systems of capitalism, which is of concern to some feminists.

====Unionizing exotic dancers====
Performers in general are problematic to categorize because they often exercise a high level of control over their work product, one characteristic of an independent contractor. Additionally, their work can be artistic in nature and often done on a freelance basis. Often, the work of performers does not possess the obvious attributes of employees such as regular working hours, places, or duties. Consequently, employers misclassify them because they are unsure of their workers&#x27; status, or they purposely misclassify them to take advantage of independent contractors&#x27; low costs. Exotic dance clubs are one such employer that purposely misclassifies their performers as independent contractors.

There are additional hurdles in terms of self-esteem and commitment to unionize. On the most basic level, dancers themselves must have the desire to unionize for collective action. For those who wish not to conform to group activity or want to remain independent, a union may seem as controlling as club management since joining a union would obligate them to pay dues and abide by decisions made through majority vote, with or without their personal approval.

In the &quot;Lusty Lady&quot; case study, this strip club was the first all-woman-managed club to successfully unionize in 1996. Some of the working conditions they were able to address included &quot;protest[ing] racist hiring practices, customers being allowed to videotape dancers without their consent via one-way mirrors, inconsistent disciplinary policies, lack of health benefits, and an overall dearth of job security&quot;. Unionizing exotic dancers can certainly bring better work conditions and fair pay, but it is difficult to do at times because of their dubious employee categorization. Also, as is the case with many other unions, dancers are often reluctant to join them. This reluctance can be due to many factors, ranging from the cost of joining a union to the dancers believing they do not need union support because they will not be exotic dancers for a long enough period of time to justify joining a union.

=== Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) ===
NGOs often play a large role in outreach to sex workers, particularly in HIV and STI prevention efforts. However, NGO outreach to sex workers for HIV prevention is sometimes less coordinated and organized than similar HIV prevention programs targeted at different groups (such as men who have sex with men). This lack of organization may be due to the legal status of prostitution and other sex work in the country in question; in China, many sex work and drug abuse NGOs do not formally register with the government and thus run many of their programs on a small scale and discreetly.

While some NGOs have increased their programming to improve conditions within the context of sex work, these programs are criticized at times due to their failure to dismantle the oppressive structures of prostitution, particularly forced trafficking. Some scholars believe that advocating for rights within the institution of prostitution is not enough; rather, programs that seek to empower sex workers must empower them to leave sex work as well as improve their rights within the context of sex work.

<text>Stéphane Mallarmé ( , ; ; 18 March 1842 – 9 September 1898), pen name of Étienne Mallarmé, was a French poet and critic. He was a major French symbolist poet, and his work anticipated and inspired several revolutionary artistic schools of the early 20th century, such as Cubism, Futurism, Dadaism, and Surrealism.

==Biography==
Mallarmé was born in Paris. He was a boarder at the &quot;Pensionnat des Frères des écoles chrétiennes à Passy&quot; between 6 or 9 October 1852 and March 1855. He worked as an English teacher and spent much of his life in relative poverty but was famed for his &quot;salons&quot;, occasional gatherings of intellectuals at his house on the rue de Rome for discussions of poetry, art and philosophy. The group became known as &quot;les Mardistes,&quot; because they met on Tuesdays (in French, &quot;mardi&quot;), and through it Mallarmé exerted considerable influence on the work of a generation of writers. For many years, those sessions, where Mallarmé held court as judge, jester, and king, were considered the heart of Paris intellectual life. Regular visitors included W.B. Yeats, Rainer Maria Rilke, Paul Valéry, Stefan George, Paul Verlaine, and many others.

Along with other members of &quot;La Revue Blanche&quot; such as Jules Renard, Julien Benda and Ioannis Psycharis, Mallarmé was a Dreyfusard.

On 10 August 1863, he married Maria Christina Gerhard. They had two children, Geneviève in 1864 and Anatole in 1871. Anatole died in 1879. Mallarmé died in Valvins (present-day Vulaines-sur-Seine), near Fontainebleau, on September 9, 1898.

==Style==
Mallarmé&#x27;s earlier work owes a great deal to the style of Charles Baudelaire who was recognised as the forerunner of literary Symbolism. Mallarmé&#x27;s later &quot;fin de siècle&quot; style, on the other hand, anticipates many of the fusions between poetry and the other arts that were to blossom in the next century. Most of this later work explored the relationship between content and form, between the text and the arrangement of words and spaces on the page. This is particularly evident in his last major poem, &quot;Un coup de dés jamais n&#x27;abolira le hasard&quot; (&#x27;A roll of the dice will never abolish chance&#x27;) of 1897.

Some consider Mallarmé one of the French poets most difficult to translate into English. The difficulty is due in part to the complex, multilayered nature of much of his work, but also to the important role that the sound of the words, rather than their meaning, plays in his poetry. When recited in French, his poems allow alternative meanings which are not evident on reading the work on the page. For example, Mallarmé&#x27;s &quot;Sonnet en &#x27;-yx&quot;&#x27; opens with the phrase &quot;ses purs ongles&quot; (&#x27;her pure nails&#x27;), whose first syllables when spoken aloud sound very similar to the words &quot;c&#x27;est pur son&quot; (&#x27;it&#x27;s pure sound&#x27;). Indeed, the &#x27;pure sound&#x27; aspect of his poetry has been the subject of musical analysis and has inspired musical compositions. These phonetic ambiguities are very difficult to reproduce in a translation which must be faithful to the meaning of the words.

==Influence==

===General poetry===

Mallarmé&#x27;s poetry has been the inspiration for several musical pieces, notably Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; (1894), a free interpretation of Mallarmé&#x27;s poem &quot;L&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; (1876), which creates powerful impressions by the use of striking but isolated phrases. Maurice Ravel set Mallarmé&#x27;s poetry to music in &quot;Trois poèmes de Mallarmé&quot; (1913). Other composers to use his poetry in song include Darius Milhaud (&quot;Chansons bas de Stéphane Mallarmé&quot;, 1917) and Pierre Boulez (&quot;Pli selon pli&quot;, 1957–62).

Man Ray&#x27;s last film, entitled &quot;Les Mystères du Château de Dé (The Mystery of the Chateau of Dice)&quot; (1929), was greatly influenced by Mallarmé&#x27;s work, prominently featuring the line &quot;A roll of the dice will never abolish chance&quot;.

Mallarmé is referred to extensively in the latter section of Joris-Karl Huysmans&#x27; , where Des Esseintes describes his fervour-infused enthusiasm for the poet: &quot;These were Mallarmé&#x27;s masterpieces and also ranked among the masterpieces of prose poetry, for they combined a style so magnificently that in itself it was as soothing as a melancholy incantation, an intoxicating melody, with irresistibly suggestive thoughts, the soul-throbs of a sensitive artist whose quivering nerves vibrate with an intensity that fills you with a painful ecstasy.&quot; [p. 198, Robert Baldick translation]

The critic and translator Barbara Johnson has emphasized Mallarmé&#x27;s influence on twentieth-century French criticism and theory: &quot;It was largely by learning the lesson of Mallarmé that critics like Roland Barthes came to speak of &#x27;the death of the author&#x27; in the making of literature. Rather than seeing the text as the emanation of an individual author&#x27;s intentions, structuralists and deconstructors followed the paths and patterns of the linguistic signifier, paying new attention to syntax, spacing, intertextuality, sound, semantics, etymology, and even individual letters. The theoretical styles of Jacques Derrida, Julia Kristeva, Maurice Blanchot, and especially Jacques Lacan also owe a great deal to Mallarmé&#x27;s &#x27;critical poem.&#x27;&quot;

===&quot;Un coup de dés&quot;===

It has been suggested that &quot;much of Mallarmé&#x27;s work influenced the conception of hypertext, with his purposeful use of blank space and careful placement of words on the page, allowing multiple non-linear readings of the text. This becomes very apparent in his work &quot;Un coup de dés&quot;.&quot;

In 1990, Greenhouse Review Press published D. J. Waldie&#x27;s American translation of &quot;Un coup de dés&quot; in a letterpress edition of 60 copies, its typography and format based on examination of the final (or near final) corrected proofs of the poem in the collection of Harvard&#x27;s Houghton Library.

Prior to 2004, &quot;Un coup de dés&quot; was never published in the typography and format conceived by Mallarmé. In 2004, 90 copies on vellum of a new edition were published by Michel Pierson et Ptyx. This edition reconstructs the typography originally designed by Mallarmé for the projected Vollard edition in 1897 and which was abandoned after the sudden death of the author in 1898. All the pages are printed in the format (38 cm by 28 cm) and in the typography chosen by the author. The reconstruction has been made from the proofs which are kept in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, taking into account the written corrections and wishes of Mallarmé and correcting certain errors on the part of the printers Firmin-Didot.

A copy of this edition is in the Bibliothèque François-Mitterrand. Copies have been acquired by the Bibliothèque littéraire Jacques-Doucet and University of California, Irvine, as well as by private collectors. A copy has been placed in the Museum Stéphane Mallarmé at Vulaines-sur-Seine, Valvins, where Mallarmé lived and died and where he made his final corrections on the proofs prior to the projected printing of the poem.

In 2012, the French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux published &quot;The Number and the Siren&quot;, a rigorous attempt at &#x27;deciphering&#x27; the poem on the basis of a unique interpretation of the phrase &#x27;the unique Number, which cannot be another.&#x27;

In 2015, Wave Books published &quot;A Roll of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance&quot;, a dual-language edition of the poem, translated by Robert Bononno and Jeff Clark (designer). Another dual-language edition, translated by Henry Weinfield, was published by University of California Press in 1994.

The poet and visual artist Marcel Broodthaers created a purely graphical version of &quot;Un coup de dés&quot;, using Mallarmé&#x27;s typographical layout but with the words replaced by black bars. In 2018, Apple Pie Editions published &quot;un coup de des jamais n&#x27;abolira le hasard: translations&quot; by Eric Zboya, an English edition that transforms the poem not only through erasure, but through graphic imaging software.

<text>A submarine (or sub) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater. (It differs from a submersible, which has more limited underwater capability.) The term &quot;submarine&quot; is also sometimes used historically or informally to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots, or to medium-sized or smaller vessels (such as the midget submarine and the wet sub). Submarines are referred to as &quot;boats&quot; rather than &quot;ships&quot; regardless of their size.

Although experimental submarines had been built earlier, submarine design took off during the 19th century, and submarines were adopted by several navies. They were first used widely during World War I (1914–1918), and are now used in many navies, large and small. Their military uses include: attacking enemy surface ships (merchant and military) or other submarines; aircraft carrier protection; blockade running; nuclear deterrence; stealth operations in denied areas when gathering intelligence and doing reconnaissance; denying or influencing enemy movements; conventional land attacks (for example, launching a cruise missile); and covert insertion of frogmen or special forces. Their civilian uses include: marine science; salvage; exploration; and facility inspection and maintenance. Submarines can be modified for specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions and undersea cable repair. They are also used in the tourism industry and in undersea archaeology. Modern deep-diving submarines derive from the bathyscaphe, which evolved from the diving bell.

Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical (or conical) ends and a vertical structure, usually located amidships, which houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes. In modern submarines, this structure is called the &quot;sail&quot; in American usage and &quot;fin&quot; in European usage. A feature of earlier designs was the &quot;conning tower&quot;: a separate pressure hull above the main body of the boat that enabled the use of shorter periscopes. There is a propeller (or pump jet) at the rear, and various hydrodynamic control fins. Smaller, deep-diving, and specialty submarines may deviate significantly from this traditional design. Submarines dive and resurface by using diving planes and by changing the amount of water and air in ballast tanks to affect their buoyancy.

Submarines encompass a wide range of types and capabilities. They range from small, autonomous examples, such as one- or two-person subs that operate for a few hours, to vessels that can remain submerged for six months, such as the Russian (the biggest submarines ever built). Submarines can work at depths that are greater than what is practicable (or even survivable) for human divers.

==History==
=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;submarine&quot; means &#x27;underwater&#x27; or &#x27;under-sea&#x27; (as in submarine canyon, submarine pipeline) though as a noun it generally refers to a vessel that can travel underwater. The term is a contraction of &quot;submarine boat&quot; and occurs as such in several languages, e.g. French (), and Spanish (), although others retain the original term, such as Dutch (), German (), Swedish (), and Russian (: ), all of which mean &#x27;submarine boat&#x27;. By naval tradition, submarines are usually referred to as &quot;boats&quot; rather than as &quot;ships&quot;, regardless of their size. Although referred to informally as &quot;boats&quot;, U.S. submarines employ the designation USS (United States Ship) at the beginning of their names, such as . In the Royal Navy, the designation HMS can refer to &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Ship&quot; or &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Submarine&quot;, though the latter is sometimes rendered &quot;HMS/m&quot; and submarines are generally referred to as &quot;boats&quot; rather than &quot;ships&quot;.

===Early human-powered submersibles===
====16th and 17th centuries====
According to a report in &quot;Opusculum Taisnieri&quot; published in 1562:
In 1578, the English mathematician William Bourne recorded in his book &quot;Inventions or Devises&quot; one of the first plans for an underwater navigation vehicle. A few years later the Scottish mathematician and theologian John Napier wrote in his &quot;Secret Inventions&quot; (1596) that &quot;These inventions besides devises of sayling under water with divers other devises and strategems for harming of the enemyes by the Grace of God and worke of expert Craftsmen I hope to perform.&quot; It is unclear whether he carried out his idea.

Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont (1553–1613) created detailed designs for two types of air-renovated submersible vehicles. They were equipped with oars, autonomous floating snorkels worked by inner pumps, portholes and gloves used for the crew to manipulate underwater objects. Ayanaz planned to use them for warfare, using them to approach enemy ships undetected and set up timed gunpowder charges on their hulls.

The first submersible of whose construction there exists reliable information was designed and built in 1620 by Cornelis Drebbel, a Dutchman in the service of James I of England. It was propelled by means of oars.

====18th century====
By the mid-18th century, over a dozen patents for submarines/submersible boats had been granted in England. In 1747, Nathaniel Symons patented and built the first known working example of the use of a ballast tank for submersion. His design used leather bags that could fill with water to submerge the craft. A mechanism was used to twist the water out of the bags and cause the boat to resurface. In 1749, the Gentlemen&#x27;s Magazine reported that a similar design had initially been proposed by Giovanni Borelli in 1680. Further design improvement stagnated for over a century, until application of new technologies for propulsion and stability.

The first military submersible was (1775), a hand-powered acorn-shaped device designed by the American David Bushnell to accommodate a single person. It was the first verified submarine capable of independent underwater operation and movement, and the first to use screws for propulsion.

====19th century====
In 1800, France built , a human-powered submarine designed by American Robert Fulton. They gave up on the experiment in 1804, as did the British, when they reconsidered Fulton&#x27;s submarine design.

In 1850, Wilhelm Bauer&#x27;s was built in Germany. It remains the oldest known surviving submarine in the world.

In 1864, late in the American Civil War, the Confederate navy&#x27;s became the first military submarine to sink an enemy vessel, the Union sloop-of-war , using a gun-powder-filled keg on a spar as a torpedo charge. The &quot;Hunley&quot; also sank. The explosion&#x27;s shock waves may have killed its crew instantly, preventing them from pumping the bilge or propelling the submarine.

In 1866, was the first submarine to successfully dive, cruise underwater, and resurface under the crew&#x27;s control. The design by German American Julius H. Kroehl (in German, &quot;Kröhl&quot;) incorporated elements that are still used in modern submarines.

In 1866, was built at the Chilean government&#x27;s request by Karl Flach, a German engineer and immigrant. It was the fifth submarine built in the world and, along with a second submarine, was intended to defend the port of Valparaiso against attack by the Spanish Navy during the Chincha Islands War.

===Mechanically powered submarines===
Submarines could not be put into widespread or routine service use by navies until suitable engines were developed. The era from 1863 to 1904 marked a pivotal time in submarine development, and several important technologies appeared. A number of nations built and used submarines. Diesel electric propulsion became the dominant power system and equipment such as the periscope became standardized. Countries conducted many experiments on effective tactics and weapons for submarines, which led to their large impact in World War I.

====1863–1904====
The first submarine not relying on human power for propulsion was the French (&quot;Diver&quot;), launched in 1863, which used compressed air at . Narcís Monturiol designed the first air-independent and combustion-powered submarine, , which was launched in Barcelona, Spain in 1864.

The submarine became feasible as potential weapon with the development of the Whitehead torpedo, designed in 1866 by British engineer Robert Whitehead, the first practical self-propelled torpedo. The spar torpedo that had been developed earlier by the Confederate States Navy was considered to be impracticable, as it was believed to have sunk both its intended target, and &quot;H. L. Hunley&quot;, the submarine that deployed it.

The Irish inventor John Philip Holland built a model submarine in 1876 and in 1878 demonstrated the Holland I prototype. This was followed by a number of unsuccessful designs. In 1896, he designed the Holland Type VI submarine, which used internal combustion engine power on the surface and electric battery power underwater. Launched on 17 May 1897 at Navy Lt. Lewis Nixon&#x27;s Crescent Shipyard in Elizabeth, New Jersey, &quot;Holland VI&quot; was purchased by the United States Navy on 11 April 1900, becoming the Navy&#x27;s first commissioned submarine, christened .

Discussions between the English clergyman and inventor George Garrett and the Swedish industrialist Thorsten Nordenfelt led to the first practical steam-powered submarines, armed with torpedoes and ready for military use. The first was &quot;Nordenfelt I&quot;, a 56-tonne, vessel similar to Garrett&#x27;s ill-fated (1879), with a range of , armed with a single torpedo, in 1885.
A reliable means of propulsion for the submerged vessel was only made possible in the 1880s with the advent of the necessary electric battery technology. The first electrically powered boats were built by Isaac Peral y Caballero in Spain (who built ), Dupuy de Lôme (who built ) and Gustave Zédé (who built &quot;Sirène&quot;) in France, and James Franklin Waddington (who built &quot;Porpoise&quot;) in England. Peral&#x27;s design featured torpedoes and other systems that later became standard in submarines.

Commissioned in June 1900, the French steam and electric employed the now typical double-hull design, with a pressure hull inside the outer shell. These 200-ton ships had a range of over underwater. The French submarine &quot;Aigrette&quot; in 1904 further improved the concept by using a diesel rather than a gasoline engine for surface power. Large numbers of these submarines were built, with seventy-six completed before 1914.

The Royal Navy commissioned five s from Vickers, Barrow-in-Furness, under licence from the Holland Torpedo Boat Company from 1901 to 1903. Construction of the boats took longer than anticipated, with the first only ready for a diving trial at sea on 6 April 1902. Although the design had been purchased entirely from the US company, the actual design used was an untested improvement to the original Holland design using a new petrol engine.

These types of submarines were first used during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. Due to the blockade at Port Arthur, the Russians sent their submarines to Vladivostok, where by 1 January 1905 there were seven boats, enough to create the world&#x27;s first &quot;operational submarine fleet&quot;. The new submarine fleet began patrols on 14 February, usually lasting for about 24 hours each. The first confrontation with Japanese warships occurred on 29 April 1905 when the Russian submarine &quot;Som&quot; was fired upon by Japanese torpedo boats, but then withdrew.

====World War I====
Military submarines first made a significant impact in World War I. Forces such as the U-boats of Germany saw action in the First Battle of the Atlantic, and were responsible for sinking , which was sunk as a result of unrestricted submarine warfare and is often cited among the reasons for the entry of the United States into the war.

At the outbreak of the war, Germany had only twenty submarines available for combat, although these included vessels of the diesel-engined &quot;U-19&quot; class, which had a sufficient range of and speed of to allow them to operate effectively around the entire British coast., By contrast, the Royal Navy had a total of 74 submarines, though of mixed effectiveness. In August 1914, a flotilla of ten U-boats sailed from their base in Heligoland to attack Royal Navy warships in the North Sea in the first submarine war patrol in history.

The U-boats&#x27; ability to function as practical war machines relied on new tactics, their numbers, and submarine technologies such as combination diesel–electric power system developed in the preceding years. More submersibles than true submarines, U-boats operated primarily on the surface using regular engines, submerging occasionally to attack under battery power. They were roughly triangular in cross-section, with a distinct keel to control rolling while surfaced, and a distinct bow. During World War I more than 5,000 Allied ships were sunk by U-boats.

The British responded to the German developments in submarine technology with the creation of the K-class submarines. However, these submarines were notoriously dangerous to operate due to their various design flaws and poor maneuverability.

====World War II====


During World War II, Germany used submarines to devastating effect in the Battle of the Atlantic, where it attempted to cut Britain&#x27;s supply routes by sinking more merchant ships than Britain could replace. These merchant ships were vital to supply Britain&#x27;s population with food, industry with raw material, and armed forces with fuel and armaments. Although the U-boats had been updated in the interwar years, the major innovation was improved communications, encrypted using the Enigma cipher machine. This allowed for mass-attack naval tactics (&quot;Rudeltaktik&quot;, commonly known as &quot;wolfpack&quot;), which ultimately ceased to be effective when the U-boat&#x27;s Enigma was cracked. By the end of the war, almost 3,000 Allied ships (175 warships, 2,825 merchantmen) had been sunk by U-boats. Although successful early in the war, Germany&#x27;s U-boat fleet suffered heavy casualties, losing 793 U-boats and about 28,000 submariners out of 41,000, a casualty rate of about 70%.

The Imperial Japanese Navy operated the most varied fleet of submarines of any navy, including &quot;Kaiten&quot; crewed torpedoes, midget submarines ( and es), medium-range submarines, purpose-built supply submarines and long-range fleet submarines. They also had submarines with the highest submerged speeds during World War II (s) and submarines that could carry multiple aircraft (s). They were also equipped with one of the most advanced torpedoes of the conflict, the oxygen-propelled Type 95. Nevertheless, despite their technical prowess, Japan chose to use its submarines for fleet warfare, and consequently were relatively unsuccessful, as warships were fast, maneuverable and well-defended compared to merchant ships.

The submarine force was the most effective anti-ship weapon in the American arsenal. Submarines, though only about 2 percent of the U.S. Navy, destroyed over 30 percent of the Japanese Navy, including 8 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship and 11 cruisers. US submarines also destroyed over 60 percent of the Japanese merchant fleet, crippling Japan&#x27;s ability to supply its military forces and industrial war effort. Allied submarines in the Pacific War destroyed more Japanese shipping than all other weapons combined. This feat was considerably aided by the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s failure to provide adequate escort forces for the nation&#x27;s merchant fleet.

During World War II, 314 submarines served in the US Navy, of which nearly 260 were deployed to the Pacific. When the Japanese attacked Hawaii in December 1941, 111 boats were in commission; 203 submarines from the , , and es were commissioned during the war. During the war, 52 US submarines were lost to all causes, with 48 directly due to hostilities. US submarines sank 1,560 enemy vessels, a total tonnage of 5.3 million tons (55% of the total sunk).

The Royal Navy Submarine Service was used primarily in the classic Axis blockade. Its major operating areas were around Norway, in the Mediterranean (against the Axis supply routes to North Africa), and in the Far East. In that war, British submarines sank 2 million tons of enemy shipping and 57 major warships, the latter including 35 submarines. Among these is the only documented instance of a submarine sinking another submarine while both were submerged. This occurred when engaged ; the &quot;Venturer&quot; crew manually computed a successful firing solution against a three-dimensionally maneuvering target using techniques which became the basis of modern torpedo computer targeting systems. Seventy-four British submarines were lost, the majority, forty-two, in the Mediterranean.

====Cold-War military models====

The first launch of a cruise missile (SSM-N-8 Regulus) from a submarine occurred in July 1953, from the deck of , a World War II fleet boat modified to carry the missile with a nuclear warhead. &quot;Tunny&quot; and its sister boat, , were the United States&#x27; first nuclear deterrent patrol submarines. In the 1950s, nuclear power partially replaced diesel–electric propulsion. Equipment was also developed to extract oxygen from sea water. These two innovations gave submarines the ability to remain submerged for weeks or months. Most of the naval submarines built since that time in the US, the Soviet Union (now Russia), the UK, and France have been powered by a nuclear reactor.

In 1959–1960, the first ballistic missile submarines were put into service by both the United States () and the Soviet Union () as part of the Cold War nuclear deterrent strategy.

During the Cold War, the US and the Soviet Union maintained large submarine fleets that engaged in cat-and-mouse games. The Soviet Union lost at least four submarines during this period: was lost in 1968 (a part of which the CIA retrieved from the ocean floor with the Howard Hughes-designed ship &quot;Glomar Explorer&quot;), in 1970, in 1986, and in 1989 (which held a depth record among military submarines—). Many other Soviet subs, such as (the first Soviet nuclear submarine, and the first Soviet sub to reach the North Pole) were badly damaged by fire or radiation leaks. The US lost two nuclear submarines during this time: due to equipment failure during a test dive while at its operational limit, and due to unknown causes.

During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Pakistan Navy&#x27;s sank the Indian frigate . This was the first sinking by a submarine since World War II. During the same war, , a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine on loan to Pakistan from the US, was sunk by the Indian Navy. It was the first submarine combat loss since World War II. In 1982 during the Falklands War, the Argentine cruiser was sunk by the British submarine , the first sinking by a nuclear-powered submarine in war. Some weeks later, on 16 June, during the Lebanon War, an unnamed Israeli submarine torpedoed and sank the Lebanese coaster &quot;Transit&quot;, which was carrying 56 Palestinian refugees to Cyprus, in the belief that the vessel was evacuating anti-Israeli militias. The ship was hit by two torpedoes, managed to run aground but eventually sank. There were 25 dead, including her captain. The Israeli Navy disclosed the incident in November 2018.

==Usage==
===Military===


Before and during World War II, the primary role of the submarine was anti-surface ship warfare. Submarines would attack either on the surface using deck guns, or submerged using torpedoes. They were particularly effective in sinking Allied transatlantic shipping in both World Wars, and in disrupting Japanese supply routes and naval operations in the Pacific in World War II.

Mine-laying submarines were developed in the early part of the 20th century. The facility was used in both World Wars. Submarines were also used for inserting and removing covert agents and military forces in special operations, for intelligence gathering, and to rescue aircrew during air attacks on islands, where the airmen would be told of safe places to crash-land so the submarines could rescue them. Submarines could carry cargo through hostile waters or act as supply vessels for other submarines.

Submarines could usually locate and attack other submarines only on the surface, although managed to sink with a four torpedo spread while both were submerged. The British developed a specialized anti-submarine submarine in WWI, the R class. After WWII, with the development of the homing torpedo, better sonar systems, and nuclear propulsion, submarines also became able to hunt each other effectively.

The development of submarine-launched ballistic missile and submarine-launched cruise missiles gave submarines a substantial and long-ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from cluster bombs to nuclear weapons.

The primary defense of a submarine lies in its ability to remain concealed in the depths of the ocean. Early submarines could be detected by the sound they made. Water is an excellent conductor of sound (much better than air), and submarines can detect and track comparatively noisy surface ships from long distances. Modern submarines are built with an emphasis on stealth. Advanced propeller designs, extensive sound-reducing insulation, and special machinery help a submarine remain as quiet as ambient ocean noise, making them difficult to detect. It takes specialized technology to find and attack modern submarines.
Active sonar uses the reflection of sound emitted from the search equipment to detect submarines. It has been used since WWII by surface ships, submarines and aircraft (via dropped buoys and helicopter &quot;dipping&quot; arrays), but it reveals the emitter&#x27;s position, and is susceptible to counter-measures.

A concealed military submarine is a real threat, and because of its stealth, can force an enemy navy to waste resources searching large areas of ocean and protecting ships against attack. This advantage was vividly demonstrated in the 1982 Falklands War when the British nuclear-powered submarine sank the Argentine cruiser . After the sinking the Argentine Navy recognized that they had no effective defense against submarine attack, and the Argentine surface fleet withdrew to port for the remainder of the war. An Argentine submarine remained at sea, however.

===Civilian===
Although the majority of the world&#x27;s submarines are military, there are some civilian submarines, which are used for tourism, exploration, oil and gas platform inspections, and pipeline surveys. Some are also used in illegal activities.

The Submarine Voyage ride opened at Disneyland in 1959, but although it ran under water, it was not a true submarine, as it ran on tracks and was open to the atmosphere. The first tourist submarine was , which went into service in 1964 at Expo64. By 1997, there were 45 tourist submarines operating around the world. Submarines with a crush depth in the range of are operated in several areas worldwide, typically with bottom depths around , with a carrying capacity of 50 to 100 passengers.

In a typical operation a surface vessel carries passengers to an offshore operating area and loads them into the submarine. The submarine then visits underwater points of interest such as natural or artificial reef structures. To surface safely without danger of collision the location of the submarine is marked with an air release and movement to the surface is coordinated by an observer in a support craft.

A recent development is the deployment of so-called narco-submarines by South American drug smugglers to evade law enforcement detection. Although they occasionally deploy true submarines, most are self-propelled semi-submersibles, where a portion of the craft remains above water at all times. In September 2011, Colombian authorities seized a 16-meter-long submersible that could hold a crew of 5, costing about $2 million. The vessel belonged to FARC rebels and had the capacity to carry at least 7 tonnes of drugs.

==Technology==
===Buoyancy and trim===

All surface ships, as well as surfaced submarines, are in a positively buoyant condition, weighing less than the volume of water they would displace if fully submerged. To submerge hydrostatically, a ship must have negative buoyancy, either by increasing its own weight or decreasing its displacement of water. To control their displacement and weight, submarines have ballast tanks, which can hold varying amounts of water and air.

For general submersion or surfacing, submarines use the main ballast tanks (MBTs), which are ambient pressure tanks, filled with water to submerge or with air to surface. While submerged, MBTs generally remain flooded, which simplifies their design, and on many submarines, these tanks are a section of the space between the light hull and the pressure hull. For more precise control of depth, submarines use smaller depth control tanks (DCTs)—also called hard tanks (due to their ability to withstand higher pressure) or trim tanks. These are variable buoyancy pressure vessels, a type of buoyancy control device. The amount of water in depth control tanks can be adjusted to hydrostatically change depth or to maintain a constant depth as outside conditions (mainly water density) change. Depth control tanks may be located either near the submarine&#x27;s center of gravity, to minimise the effect on trim, or separated along the length of the hull so they can also be used to adjust static trim by transfer of water between them.

When submerged, the water pressure on a submarine&#x27;s hull can reach for steel submarines and up to for titanium submarines like , while interior pressure remains relatively unchanged. This difference results in hull compression, which decreases displacement. Water density also marginally increases with depth, as the salinity and pressure are higher. This change in density incompletely compensates for hull compression, so buoyancy decreases as depth increases. A submerged submarine is in an unstable equilibrium, having a tendency to either sink or float to the surface. Keeping a constant depth requires continual operation of either the depth control tanks or control surfaces.

Submarines in a neutral buoyancy condition are not intrinsically trim-stable. To maintain desired longitudinal trim, submarines use forward and aft trim tanks. Pumps move water between the tanks, changing weight distribution and pitching the sub up or down. A similar system may be used to maintain transverse trim.

===Control surfaces===
The hydrostatic effect of variable ballast tanks is not the only way to control the submarine underwater. Hydrodynamic maneuvering is done by several control surfaces, collectively known as diving planes or hydroplanes, which can be moved to create hydrodynamic forces when a submarine moves longitudinally at sufficient speed. In the classic cruciform stern configuration, the horizontal stern planes serve the same purpose as the trim tanks, controlling the trim. Most submarines additionally have forward horizontal planes, normally placed on the bow until the 1960s but often on the sail on later designs, where they are closer to the center of gravity and can control depth with less effect on the trim.
An obvious way to configure the control surfaces at the stern of a submarine is to use vertical planes to control yaw and horizontal planes to control pitch, which gives them the shape of a cross when seen from astern of the vessel. In this configuration, which long remained the dominant one, the horizontal planes are used to control the trim and depth and the vertical planes to control sideways maneuvers, like the rudder of a surface ship.

Alternatively, the rear control surfaces can be combined into what has become known as an X-stern or an X-form rudder. Although less intuitive, such a configuration has turned out to have several advantages over the traditional cruciform arrangement. First, it improves maneuverability, horizontally as well as vertically. Second, the control surfaces are less likely to get damaged when landing on, or departing from, the seabed as well as when mooring and unmooring alongside. Finally, it is safer in that one of the two diagonal lines can counteract the other with respect to vertical as well as horizontal motion if one of them accidentally gets stuck.
The x-stern was first tried in practice in the early 1960s on the USS &quot;Albacore&quot;, an experimental submarine of the US Navy. While the arrangement was found to be advantageous, it was nevertheless not used on US production submarines that followed due to the fact that it requires the use of a computer to manipulate the control surfaces to the desired effect. Instead, the first to use an x-stern in standard operations was the Swedish Navy with its &quot;Sjöormen&quot; class, the lead submarine of which was launched in 1967, before the &quot;Albacore&quot; had even finished her test runs. Since it turned out to work very well in practice, all subsequent classes of Swedish submarines (&quot;Näcken&quot;, &quot;Västergötland&quot;, &quot;Gotland&quot;, and &quot;Blekinge&quot; class) have or will come with an x-rudder.

The Kockums shipyard responsible for the design of the x-stern on Swedish submarines eventually exported it to Australia with the &quot;Collins&quot; class as well as to Japan with the &quot;Sōryū&quot; class. With the introduction of the type 212, the German and Italian Navies came to feature it as well. The US Navy with its &quot;Columbia&quot; class, the British Navy with its &quot;Dreadnought&quot; class, and the French Navy with its &quot;Barracuda&quot; class are all about to join the x-stern family. Hence, as judged by the situation in the early 2020s, the x-stern is about to become the dominant technology.

When a submarine performs an emergency surfacing, all depth and trim control methods are used simultaneously, together with propelling the boat upwards. Such surfacing is very quick, so the vessel may even partially jump out of the water, potentially damaging submarine systems.

===Hull===
====Overview====
Modern submarines are cigar-shaped. This design, also used in very early submarines, is sometimes called a &quot;teardrop hull&quot;. It reduces hydrodynamic drag when the sub is submerged, but decreases the sea-keeping capabilities and increases drag while surfaced. Since the limitations of the propulsion systems of early submarines forced them to operate surfaced most of the time, their hull designs were a compromise. Because of the slow submerged speeds of those subs, usually, well below 10 kt (18 km/h), the increased drag for underwater travel was acceptable. Late in World War II, when technology allowed faster and longer submerged operation and increased aircraft surveillance forced submarines to stay submerged, hull designs became teardrop shaped again to reduce drag and noise. was a unique research submarine that pioneered the American version of the teardrop hull form (sometimes referred to as an &quot;Albacore hull&quot;) of modern submarines. On modern military submarines the outer hull is covered with a layer of sound-absorbing rubber, or anechoic plating, to reduce detection.

The occupied pressure hulls of deep-diving submarines such as are spherical instead of cylindrical. This allows a more even distribution of stress and efficient use of materials to withstand external pressure as it gives the most internal volume for structural weight and is the most efficient shape to avoid buckling instability in compression. A frame is usually affixed to the outside of the pressure hull, providing attachment for ballast and trim systems, scientific instrumentation, battery packs, syntactic flotation foam, and lighting.

A raised tower on top of a standard submarine accommodates the periscope and electronics masts, which can include radio, radar, electronic warfare, and other systems. It might also include a snorkel mast. In many early classes of submarines (see history), the control room, or &quot;conn&quot;, was located inside this tower, which was known as the &quot;conning tower&quot;. Since then, the conn has been located within the hull of the submarine, and the tower is now called the &quot;sail&quot; or &quot;fin&quot;. The conn is distinct from the &quot;bridge&quot;, a small open platform in the top of the sail, used for observation during surface operation.

&quot;Bathtubs&quot; are related to conning towers but are used on smaller submarines. The bathtub is a metal cylinder surrounding the hatch that prevents waves from breaking directly into the cabin. It is needed because surfaced submarines have limited freeboard, that is, they lie low in the water. Bathtubs help prevent swamping the vessel.

====Single and double hulls====
Modern submarines and submersibles usually have, as did the earliest models, a single hull. Large submarines generally have an additional hull or hull sections outside. This external hull, which actually forms the shape of submarine, is called the outer hull (&quot;casing&quot; in the Royal Navy) or light hull, as it does not have to withstand a pressure difference. Inside the outer hull there is a strong hull, or pressure hull, which withstands sea pressure and has normal atmospheric pressure inside.

As early as World War I, it was realized that the optimal shape for withstanding pressure conflicted with the optimal shape for seakeeping and minimal drag at the surface, and construction difficulties further complicated the problem. This was solved either by a compromise shape, or by using two layered hulls: the internal strength hull for withstanding pressure, and an external fairing for hydrodynamic shape. Until the end of World War II, most submarines had an additional partial casing on the top, bow and stern, built of thinner metal, which was flooded when submerged. Germany went further with the Type XXI, a general predecessor of modern submarines, in which the pressure hull was fully enclosed inside the light hull, but optimized for submerged navigation, unlike earlier designs that were optimized for surface operation.
After World War II, approaches split. The Soviet Union changed its designs, basing them on German developments. All post-World War II heavy Soviet and Russian submarines are built with a double hull structure. American and most other Western submarines switched to a primarily single-hull approach. They still have light hull sections in the bow and stern, which house main ballast tanks and provide a hydrodynamically optimized shape, but the main cylindrical hull section has only a single plating layer. Double hulls are being considered for future submarines in the United States to improve payload capacity, stealth and range.

====Pressure hull====

The pressure hull is generally constructed of thick high-strength steel with a complex structure and high strength reserve, and is separated by watertight bulkheads into several compartments. There are also examples of more than two hulls in a submarine, like the , which has two main pressure hulls and three smaller ones for control room, torpedoes and steering gear, with the missile launch system between the main hulls, all surrounded and supported by the outer light hydrodynamic hull. When submerged the pressure hull provides most of the buoyancy for the whole vessel.

The dive depth cannot be increased easily. Simply making the hull thicker increases the structural weight and requires reduction of onboard equipment weight, and increasing the diameter requires a proportional increase in thickness for the same material and architecture, ultimately resulting in a pressure hull that does not have sufficient buoyancy to support its own weight, as in a bathyscaphe. This is acceptable for civilian research submersibles, but not military submarines, which need to carry a large equipment, crew, and weapons load to fulfill their function. Construction materials with greater specific strength and specific modulus are needed.

WWI submarines had hulls of carbon steel, with a maximum depth. During WWII, high-strength alloyed steel was introduced, allowing depths. High-strength alloy steel remains the primary material for submarines today, with depths, which cannot be exceeded on a military submarine without design compromises. To exceed that limit, a few submarines were built with titanium hulls. Titanium alloys can be stronger than steel, lighter, and most importantly, have higher immersed specific strength and specific modulus. Titanium is also not ferromagnetic, important for stealth. Titanium submarines were built by the Soviet Union, which developed specialized high-strength alloys. It has produced several types of titanium submarines. Titanium alloys allow a major increase in depth, but other systems must be redesigned to cope, so test depth was limited to for the , the deepest-diving combat submarine. An may have successfully operated at , though continuous operation at such depths would produce excessive stress on many submarine systems. Titanium does not flex as readily as steel, and may become brittle after many dive cycles. Despite its benefits, the high cost of titanium construction led to the abandonment of titanium submarine construction as the Cold War ended. Deep-diving civilian submarines have used thick acrylic pressure hulls. Although the specific strength and specific modulus of acrylic are not very high, the density is only 1.18g/cm3, so it is only very slightly denser than water, and the buoyancy penalty of increased thickness is correspondingly low.

The deepest deep-submergence vehicle (DSV) to date is &quot;Trieste&quot;. On 5 October 1959, &quot;Trieste&quot; departed San Diego for Guam aboard the freighter &quot;Santa Maria&quot; to participate in &quot;Project Nekton&quot;, a series of very deep dives in the Mariana Trench. On 23 January 1960, &quot;Trieste&quot; reached the ocean floor in the Challenger Deep (the deepest southern part of the Mariana Trench), carrying Jacques Piccard (son of Auguste) and Lieutenant Don Walsh, USN. This was the first time a vessel, crewed or uncrewed, had reached the deepest point in the Earth&#x27;s oceans. The onboard systems indicated a depth of , although this was later revised to and more accurate measurements made in 1995 have found the Challenger Deep slightly shallower, at .

Building a pressure hull is difficult, as it must withstand pressures at its required diving depth. When the hull is perfectly round in cross-section, the pressure is evenly distributed, and causes only hull compression. If the shape is not perfect, the hull deflects more in some places and buckling instability is the usual failure mode. Inevitable minor deviations are resisted by stiffener rings, but even a one-inch (25 mm) deviation from roundness results in over 30 percent decrease of maximal hydrostatic load and consequently dive depth. The hull must therefore be constructed with high precision. All hull parts must be welded without defects, and all joints are checked multiple times with different methods, contributing to the high cost of modern submarines. (For example, each attack submarine costs US$2.6 billion, over US$200,000 per ton of displacement.)

===Propulsion===

The first submarines were propelled by humans. The first mechanically driven submarine was the 1863 French , which used compressed air for propulsion. Anaerobic propulsion was first employed by the Spanish &quot;Ictineo II&quot; in 1864, which used a solution of zinc, manganese dioxide, and potassium chlorate to generate sufficient heat to power a steam engine, while also providing oxygen for the crew. A similar system was not employed again until 1940 when the German Navy tested a hydrogen peroxide-based system, the Walter turbine, on the experimental V-80 submarine and later on the naval and type XVII submarines; the system was further developed for the British , completed in 1958.

Until the advent of nuclear marine propulsion, most 20th-century submarines used electric motors and batteries for running underwater and combustion engines on the surface, and for battery recharging. Early submarines used gasoline (petrol) engines but this quickly gave way to kerosene (paraffin) and then diesel engines because of reduced flammability and, with diesel, improved fuel-efficiency and thus also greater range. A combination of diesel and electric propulsion became the norm.

Initially, the combustion engine and the electric motor were in most cases connected to the same shaft so that both could directly drive the propeller. The combustion engine was placed at the front end of the stern section with the electric motor behind it followed by the propeller shaft. The engine was connected to the motor by a clutch and the motor in turn connected to the propeller shaft by another clutch.

With only the rear clutch engaged, the electric motor could drive the propeller, as required for fully submerged operation. With both clutches engaged, the combustion engine could drive the propeller, as was possible when operating on the surface or, at a later stage, when snorkeling. The electric motor would in this case serve as a generator to charge the batteries or, if no charging was needed, be allowed to rotate freely. With only the front clutch engaged, the combustion engine could drive the electric motor as a generator for charging the batteries without simultaneously forcing the propeller to move.

The motor could have multiple armatures on the shaft, which could be electrically coupled in series for slow speed and in parallel for high speed (these connections were called &quot;group down&quot; and &quot;group up&quot;, respectively).

====Diesel–electric transmission====

While most early submarines used a direct mechanical connection between the combustion engine and the propeller, an alternative solution was considered as well as implemented at a very early stage. That solution consists in first converting the work of the combustion engine into electric energy via a dedicated generator. This energy is then used to drive the propeller via the electric motor and, to the extent required, for charging the batteries. In this configuration, the electric motor is thus responsible for driving the propeller at all times, regardless of whether air is available so that the combustion engine can also be used or not.

Among the pioneers of this alternative solution was the very first submarine of the Swedish Navy, (later renamed &quot;Ub no 1&quot;), launched in 1904. While its design was generally inspired by the first submarine commissioned by the US Navy, USS &quot;Holland&quot;, it deviated from the latter in at least three significant ways: by adding a periscope, by replacing the gasoline engine by a semidiesel engine (a hot-bulb engine primarily meant to be fueled by kerosene, later replaced by a true diesel engine) and by severing the mechanical link between the combustion engine and the propeller by instead letting the former drive a dedicated generator. By so doing, it took three significant steps toward what was eventually to become the dominant technology for conventional (i.e., non-nuclear) submarines.
In the following years, the Swedish Navy added another seven submarines in three different classes (, , and ) using the same propulsion technology but fitted with true diesel engines rather than semidiesels from the outset. Since by that time, the technology was usually based on the diesel engine rather than some other type of combustion engine, it eventually came to be known as diesel–electric transmission.

Like many other early submarines, those initially designed in Sweden were quite small (less than 200 tonnes) and thus confined to littoral operation. When the Swedish Navy wanted to add larger vessels, capable of operating further from the shore, their designs were purchased from companies abroad that already had the required experience: first Italian (Fiat-Laurenti) and later German (A.G. Weser and IvS). As a side-effect, the diesel–electric transmission was temporarily abandoned.

However, diesel–electric transmission was immediately reintroduced when Sweden began designing its own submarines again in the mid-1930s. From that point onwards, it has been consistently used for all new classes of Swedish submarines, albeit supplemented by air-independent propulsion (AIP) as provided by Stirling engines beginning with HMS &quot;Näcken&quot; in 1988.
Another early adopter of diesel–electric transmission was the US Navy, whose Bureau of Engineering proposed its use in 1928. It was subsequently tried in the S-class submarines , , and before being put into production with the &quot;Porpoise&quot; class of the 1930s. From that point onwards, it continued to be used on most US conventional submarines.

Apart from the British U-class and some submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy that used separate diesel generators for low speed running, few navies other than those of Sweden and the US made much use of diesel–electric transmission before 1945. After World War II, by contrast, it gradually became the dominant mode of propulsion for conventional submarines. However, its adoption was not always swift. Notably, the Soviet Navy did not introduce diesel–electric transmission on its conventional submarines until 1980 with its &quot;Paltus&quot; class.

If diesel–electric transmission had only brought advantages and no disadvantages in comparison with a system that mechanically connects the diesel engine to the propeller, it would undoubtedly have become dominant much earlier. The disadvantages include the following:
* It entails a loss of fuel-efficiency as well as power by converting the output of the diesel engine into electricity. While both generators and electric motors are known to be very efficient, their efficiency nevertheless falls short of 100 percent.
* It requires an additional component in the form of a dedicated generator. Since the electric motor is always used to drive the propeller it can no longer step in to take on generator service as well.
* It does not allow the diesel engine and the electrical motor to join forces by simultaneously driving the propeller mechanically for maximum speed when the submarine is surfaced or snorkeling. This may, however, be of little practical importance inasmuch as the option it prevents is one that would leave the submarine at a risk of having to dive with its batteries at least partly depleted.

The reason why diesel–electric transmission has become the dominant alternative in spite of these disadvantages is of course that it also comes with many advantages and that, on balance, these have eventually been found to be more important. The advantages include the following:
* It reduces external noise by severing the direct and rigid mechanical link between the relatively noisy diesel engine(s) on the one hand and the propeller shaft(s) and hull on the other. With stealth being of paramount importance to submarines, this is a very significant advantage.
* It increases the readiness to dive, which is of course of vital importance for a submarine. The only thing required from a propulsion point of view is to shut down the diesel(s).
* It makes the speed of the diesel engine(s) temporarily independent of the speed of the submarine. This in turn often makes it possible to run the diesel(s) at close to optimal speed from a fuel-efficiency as well as durability point of view. It also makes it possible to reduce the time spent surfaced or snorkeling by running the diesel(s) at maximum speed without affecting the speed of the submarine itself.
* It eliminates the clutches otherwise required to connect the diesel engine, the electric motor, and the propeller shaft. This in turn saves space, increases reliability and reduces maintenance costs.
* It increases flexibility with regard to how the driveline components are configured, positioned, and maintained. For example, the diesel no longer has to be aligned with the electric motor and propeller shaft, two diesels can be used to power a single propeller (or vice versa), and one diesel can be turned off for maintenance as long as a second is available to provide the required amount of electricity.
* It facilitates the integration of additional primary sources of energy, beside the diesel engine(s), such as various kinds of air-independent power (AIP) systems. With one or more electric motors always driving the propeller(s), such systems can easily be introduced as yet another source of electric energy in addition to the diesel engine(s) and the batteries.

====Snorkel====

During World War II the Germans experimented with the idea of the &quot;schnorchel&quot; (snorkel) from captured Dutch submarines but did not see the need for them until rather late in the war. The &quot;schnorchel&quot; is a retractable pipe that supplies air to the diesel engines while submerged at periscope depth, allowing the boat to cruise and recharge its batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth.

Especially as first implemented however, it turned out to be far from a perfect solution. There were problems with the device&#x27;s valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather. Since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat&#x27;s compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Speed was limited to , lest the device snap from stress. The &quot;schnorchel&quot; also created noise that made the boat easier to detect with sonar, yet more difficult for the on-board sonar to detect signals from other vessels. Finally, allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the &quot;schnorchel&quot; mast could be detected beyond visual range.

While the snorkel renders a submarine far less detectable, it is thus not perfect. In clear weather, diesel exhausts can be seen on the surface to a distance of about three miles, while &quot;periscope feather&quot; (the wave created by the snorkel or periscope moving through the water) is visible from far off in calm sea conditions. Modern radar is also capable of detecting a snorkel in calm sea conditions.
The problem of the diesels causing a vacuum in the submarine when the head valve is submerged still exists in later model diesel submarines but is mitigated by high-vacuum cut-off sensors that shut down the engines when the vacuum in the ship reaches a pre-set point. Modern snorkel induction masts have a fail-safe design using compressed air, controlled by a simple electrical circuit, to hold the &quot;head valve&quot; open against the pull of a powerful spring. Seawater washing over the mast shorts out exposed electrodes on top, breaking the control, and shutting the &quot;head valve&quot; while it is submerged. US submarines did not adopt the use of snorkels until after WWII.

====Air-independent propulsion====


During World War II, German Type XXI submarines (also known as &quot;Elektroboote&quot;) were the first submarines designed to operate submerged for extended periods. Initially they were to carry hydrogen peroxide for long-term, fast air-independent propulsion, but were ultimately built with very large batteries instead. At the end of the War, the British and Soviets experimented with hydrogen peroxide/kerosene (paraffin) engines that could run surfaced and submerged. The results were not encouraging. Though the Soviet Union deployed a class of submarines with this engine type (codenamed by NATO), they were considered unsuccessful.

The United States also used hydrogen peroxide in an experimental midget submarine, X-1. It was originally powered by a hydrogen peroxide/diesel engine and battery system until an explosion of her hydrogen peroxide supply on 20 May 1957. X-1 was later converted to use diesel–electric drive.

Today several navies use air-independent propulsion. Notably Sweden uses Stirling technology on the and s. The Stirling engine is heated by burning diesel fuel with liquid oxygen from cryogenic tanks. A newer development in air-independent propulsion is hydrogen fuel cells, first used on the German Type 212 submarine, with nine 34 kW or two 120 kW cells. Fuel cells are also used in the new Spanish s although with the fuel stored as ethanol and then converted into hydrogen before use.

One new technology that is being introduced starting with the Japanese Navy&#x27;s eleventh &quot;Sōryū&quot;-class submarine (JS &quot;Ōryū&quot;) is a more modern battery, the lithium-ion battery. These batteries have about double the electric storage of traditional batteries, and by changing out the lead-acid batteries in their normal storage areas plus filling up the large hull space normally devoted to AIP engine and fuel tanks with many tons of lithium-ion batteries, modern submarines can actually return to a &quot;pure&quot; diesel–electric configuration yet have the added underwater range and power normally associated with AIP equipped submarines.

====Nuclear power====

Steam power was resurrected in the 1950s with a nuclear-powered steam turbine driving a generator. By eliminating the need for atmospheric oxygen, the time that a submarine could remain submerged was limited only by its food stores, as breathing air was recycled and fresh water distilled from seawater. More importantly, a nuclear submarine has unlimited range at top speed. This allows it to travel from its operating base to the combat zone in a much shorter time and makes it a far more difficult target for most anti-submarine weapons. Nuclear-powered submarines have a relatively small battery and diesel engine/generator powerplant for emergency use if the reactors must be shut down.

Nuclear power is now used in all large submarines, but due to the high cost and large size of nuclear reactors, smaller submarines still use diesel–electric propulsion. The ratio of larger to smaller submarines depends on strategic needs. The US Navy, French Navy, and the British Royal Navy operate only nuclear submarines, which is explained by the need for distant operations. Other major operators rely on a mix of nuclear submarines for strategic purposes and diesel–electric submarines for defense. Most fleets have no nuclear submarines, due to the limited availability of nuclear power and submarine technology.

Diesel–electric submarines have a stealth advantage over their nuclear counterparts. Nuclear submarines generate noise from coolant pumps and turbo-machinery needed to operate the reactor, even at low power levels. Some nuclear submarines such as the American can operate with their reactor coolant pumps secured, making them quieter than electric subs. A conventional submarine operating on batteries is almost completely silent, the only noise coming from the shaft bearings, propeller, and flow noise around the hull, all of which stops when the sub hovers in mid-water to listen, leaving only the noise from crew activity. Commercial submarines usually rely only on batteries, since they operate in conjunction with a mother ship.

Several serious nuclear and radiation accidents have involved nuclear submarine mishaps. The reactor accident in 1961 resulted in 8 deaths and more than 30 other people were over-exposed to radiation. The reactor accident in 1968 resulted in 9 fatalities and 83 other injuries. The accident in 1985 resulted in 10 fatalities and 49 other radiation injuries.

====Alternative====
Oil-fired steam turbines powered the British K-class submarines, built during World War I and later, to give them the surface speed to keep up with the battle fleet. The K-class subs were not very successful, however.

Toward the end of the 20th century, some submarines—such as the British &quot;Vanguard&quot; class—began to be fitted with pump-jet propulsors instead of propellers. Though these are heavier, more expensive, and less efficient than a propeller, they are significantly quieter, providing an important tactical advantage.

===Armament===
The success of the submarine is inextricably linked to the development of the torpedo, invented by Robert Whitehead in 1866. His invention (essentially the same now as it was 140 years ago), allowed the submarine make the leap from novelty to a weapon of war. Prior to the development and miniaturization of sonar sensitive enough to track a submerged submarine, attacks were exclusively restricted to ships and submarines operating near or at the surface. Targeting of unguided torpedoes was initially done by eye, but by World War II analog targeting computers began to proliferate, being able to calculate basic firing solutions. Nonetheless, multiple &quot;straight-running&quot; torpedoes could be required to ensure a target was hit. With at most 20 to 25 torpedoes stored on board, the number of attacks a submarine could make was limited. To increase combat endurance starting in World War I submarines also functioned as submersible gunboats, using their deck guns against unarmed targets, and diving to escape and engage enemy warships. The initial importance of these deck guns encouraged the development of the unsuccessful Submarine Cruiser such as the French and the Royal Navy&#x27;s and M-class submarines. With the arrival of anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft, guns became more for defense than attack. A more practical method of increasing combat endurance was the external torpedo tube, loaded only in port.

The ability of submarines to approach enemy harbours covertly led to their use as minelayers. Minelaying submarines of World War I and World War II were specially built for that purpose. Modern submarine-laid mines, such as the British Mark 5 Stonefish and Mark 6 Sea Urchin, can be deployed from a submarine&#x27;s torpedo tubes.

After World War II, both the US and the USSR experimented with submarine-launched cruise missiles such as the SSM-N-8 Regulus and P-5 Pyatyorka. Such missiles required the submarine to surface to fire its missiles. They were the forerunners of modern submarine-launched cruise missiles, which can be fired from the torpedo tubes of submerged submarines, for example, the US BGM-109 Tomahawk and Russian RPK-2 Viyuga and versions of surface-to-surface anti-ship missiles such as the Exocet and Harpoon, encapsulated for submarine launch. Ballistic missiles can also be fired from a submarine&#x27;s torpedo tubes, for example, missiles such as the anti-submarine SUBROC. With internal volume as limited as ever and the desire to carry heavier warloads, the idea of the external launch tube was revived, usually for encapsulated missiles, with such tubes being placed between the internal pressure and outer streamlined hulls. Guided torpedoes also proliferated extensively during and after World War II, even further increasing the combat endurance and lethality of submarines and allowing them to engage other submarines at depth (with the latter now being one of the primary missions of the modern attack submarine).

The strategic mission of the SSM-N-8 and the P-5 was taken up by submarine-launched ballistic missile beginning with the US Navy&#x27;s Polaris missile, and subsequently the Poseidon and Trident missiles.

Germany is working on the torpedo tube-launched short-range IDAS missile, which can be used against ASW helicopters, as well as surface ships and coastal targets.

===Sensors===
A submarine can have a variety of sensors, depending on its missions. Modern military submarines rely almost entirely on a suite of passive and active sonars to locate targets. Active sonar relies on an audible &quot;ping&quot; to generate echoes to reveal objects around the submarine. Active systems are rarely used, as doing so reveals the sub&#x27;s presence. Passive sonar is a set of sensitive hydrophones set into the hull or trailed in a towed array, normally trailing several hundred feet behind the sub. The towed array is the mainstay of NATO submarine detection systems, as it reduces the flow noise heard by operators. Hull mounted sonar is employed in addition to the towed array, as the towed array can not work in shallow depth and during maneuvering. In addition, sonar has a blind spot &quot;through&quot; the submarine, so a system on both the front and back works to eliminate that problem. As the towed array trails behind and below the submarine, it also allows the submarine to have a system both above and below the thermocline at the proper depth; sound passing through the thermocline is distorted resulting in a lower detection range.

Submarines also carry radar equipment to detect surface ships and aircraft. Submarine captains are more likely to use radar detection gear than active radar to detect targets, as radar can be detected far beyond its own return range, revealing the submarine. Periscopes are rarely used, except for position fixes and to verify a contact&#x27;s identity.

Civilian submarines, such as the or the Russian &quot;Mir&quot; submersibles, rely on small active sonar sets and viewing ports to navigate. The human eye cannot detect sunlight below about underwater, so high intensity lights are used to illuminate the viewing area.

===Navigation===

Early submarines had few navigation aids, but modern subs have a variety of navigation systems. Modern military submarines use an inertial guidance system for navigation while submerged, but drift error unavoidably builds over time. To counter this, the crew occasionally uses the Global Positioning System to obtain an accurate position. The periscope—a retractable tube with a prism system that provides a view of the surface—is only used occasionally in modern submarines, since the visibility range is short. The and s use photonics masts rather than hull-penetrating optical periscopes. These masts must still be deployed above the surface, and use electronic sensors for visible light, infrared, laser range-finding, and electromagnetic surveillance. One benefit to hoisting the mast above the surface is that while the mast is above the water the entire sub is still below the water and is much harder to detect visually or by radar.

===Communication===
Military submarines use several systems to communicate with distant command centers or other ships. One is VLF (very low frequency) radio, which can reach a submarine either on the surface or submerged to a fairly shallow depth, usually less than . ELF (extremely low frequency) can reach a submarine at greater depths, but has a very low bandwidth and is generally used to call a submerged sub to a shallower depth where VLF signals can reach. A submarine also has the option of floating a long, buoyant wire antenna to a shallower depth, allowing VLF transmissions by a deeply submerged boat.

By extending a radio mast, a submarine can also use a &quot;burst transmission&quot; technique. A burst transmission takes only a fraction of a second, minimizing a submarine&#x27;s risk of detection.

To communicate with other submarines, a system known as Gertrude is used. Gertrude is basically a sonar telephone. Voice communication from one submarine is transmitted by low power speakers into the water, where it is detected by passive sonars on the receiving submarine. The range of this system is probably very short, and using it radiates sound into the water, which can be heard by the enemy.

Civilian submarines can use similar, albeit less powerful systems to communicate with support ships or other submersibles in the area.

===Life support systems===
With nuclear power or air-independent propulsion, submarines can remain submerged for months at a time. Conventional diesel submarines must periodically resurface or run on snorkel to recharge their batteries. Most modern military submarines generate breathing oxygen by electrolysis of fresh water (using a device called an &quot;Electrolytic Oxygen Generator&quot;). Emergency oxygen can be produced by burning sodium chlorate candles. Atmosphere control equipment includes a Carbon dioxide scrubber, which uses a spray of monoethanolamine (MEA) absorbent to remove the gas from the air, after which the MEA is heated in a boiler to release the CO2 which is then pumped overboard. Emergency scrubbing can also be done with lithium hydroxide, which is consumable. A machine that uses a catalyst to convert carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide (removed by the scrubber) and bonds hydrogen produced from the ship&#x27;s storage battery with oxygen in the atmosphere to produce water, is also used. An atmosphere monitoring system samples the air from different areas of the ship for nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, R-12 and R-114 refrigerants, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and other gases. Poisonous gases are removed, and oxygen is replenished by use of an oxygen bank located in a main ballast tank. Some heavier submarines have two oxygen bleed stations (forward and aft). The oxygen in the air is sometimes kept a few percent less than atmospheric concentration to reduce fire risk.

Fresh water is produced by either an evaporator or a reverse osmosis unit. The primary use for fresh water is to provide feedwater for the reactor and steam propulsion plants. It is also available for showers, sinks, cooking and cleaning once propulsion plant needs have been met. Seawater is used to flush toilets, and the resulting &quot;blackwater&quot; is stored in a sanitary tank until it is blown overboard using pressurized air or pumped overboard by using a special sanitary pump. The blackwater-discharge system requires skill to operate, and isolation valves must be closed before discharge. The German Type VIIC boat was lost with casualties because of human error while using this system. Water from showers and sinks is stored separately in &quot;grey water&quot; tanks and discharged overboard using drain pumps.

Trash on modern large submarines is usually disposed of using a tube called a Trash Disposal Unit (TDU), where it is compacted into a galvanized steel can. At the bottom of the TDU is a large ball valve. An ice plug is set on top of the ball valve to protect it, the cans atop the ice plug. The top breech door is shut, and the TDU is flooded and equalized with sea pressure, the ball valve is opened and the cans fall out assisted by scrap iron weights in the cans. The TDU is also flushed with seawater to ensure it is completely empty and the ball valve is clear before closing the valve.

==Crew==
A typical nuclear submarine has a crew of over 80; conventional boats typically have fewer than 40. The conditions on a submarine can be difficult because crew members must work in isolation for long periods of time, without family contact, and in cramped conditions. Submarines normally maintain radio silence to avoid detection. Operating a submarine is dangerous, even in peacetime, and many submarines have been lost in accidents.

===Women===
Most navies prohibited women from serving on submarines, even after they had been permitted to serve on surface warships. The Royal Norwegian Navy became the first navy to allow women on its submarine crews in 1985. The Royal Danish Navy allowed female submariners in 1988. Others followed suit including the Swedish Navy (1989), the Royal Australian Navy (1998), the Spanish Navy (1999), the German Navy (2001) and the Canadian Navy (2002). In 1995, Solveig Krey of the Royal Norwegian Navy became the first female officer to assume command on a military submarine, HNoMS &quot;Kobben&quot;.

On 8 December 2011, British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced that the UK&#x27;s ban on women in submarines was to be lifted from 2013. Previously there were fears that women were more at risk from a build-up of carbon dioxide in the submarine. But a study showed no medical reason to exclude women, though pregnant women would still be excluded. Similar dangers to the pregnant woman and her fetus barred women from submarine service in Sweden in 1983, when all other positions were made available for them in the Swedish Navy. Today, pregnant women are still not allowed to serve on submarines in Sweden. However, the policymakers thought that it was discriminatory with a general ban and demanded that women should be tried on their individual merits and have their suitability evaluated and compared to other candidates. Further, they noted that a woman complying with such high demands is unlikely to become pregnant. In May 2014, three women became the RN&#x27;s first female submariners.

Women have served on US Navy surface ships since 1993, and , began serving on submarines for the first time. Until presently, the Navy allowed only three exceptions to women being on board military submarines: female civilian technicians for a few days at most, women midshipmen on an overnight during summer training for Navy ROTC and Naval Academy, and family members for one-day dependent cruises. In 2009, senior officials, including then-Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, Joint Chief of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen, and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead, began the process of finding a way to implement women on submarines. The US Navy rescinded its &quot;no women on subs&quot; policy in 2010.

Both the US and British navies operate nuclear-powered submarines that deploy for periods of six months or longer. Other navies that permit women to serve on submarines operate conventionally powered submarines, which deploy for much shorter periods—usually only for a few months. Prior to the change by the US, no nation using nuclear submarines permitted women to serve on board.

In 2011, the first class of female submarine officers graduated from Naval Submarine School&#x27;s Submarine Officer Basic Course (SOBC) at the Naval Submarine Base New London. Additionally, more senior ranking and experienced female supply officers from the surface warfare specialty attended SOBC as well, proceeding to fleet Ballistic Missile (SSBN) and Guided Missile (SSGN) submarines along with the new female submarine line officers beginning in late 2011. By late 2011, several women were assigned to the &quot;Ohio&quot;-class ballistic missile submarine . On 15 October 2013, the US Navy announced that two of the smaller &quot;Virginia&quot;-class attack submarines, and , would have female crew-members by January 2015.

In 2020, Japan&#x27;s national naval submarine academy accepted its first female candidate.

===Abandoning the vessel===

In an emergency, submarines can contact other ships to assist in rescue, and pick up the crew when they abandon ship. The crew can use escape sets such as the Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment to abandon the submarine via an escape trunk, which is a small airlock compartment that provides a route for crew to escape from a downed submarine at ambient pressure in small groups, while minimising the amount of water admitted to the submarine. The crew can avoid lung injury from over-expansion of air in the lungs due to the pressure change known as pulmonary barotrauma by maintaining an open airway and exhaling during the ascent. Following escape from a pressurized submarine, in which the air pressure is higher than atmospheric due to water ingress or other reasons, the crew is at risk of developing decompression sickness on return to surface pressure.

An alternative escape means is via a deep-submergence rescue vehicle that can dock onto the disabled submarine, establish a seal around the escape hatch, and transfer personnel at the same pressure as the interior of the submarine. If the submarine has been pressurised the survivors can lock into a decompression chamber on the submarine rescue ship and transfer under pressure for safe surface decompression.

<text>The Second Epistle to the Thessalonians is a book from the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is traditionally attributed to Paul the Apostle, with Timothy as a co-author. Modern biblical scholarship is divided on whether the epistle was written by Paul; some scholars believe Paul wrote this epistle, but others reject its authenticity based on what they see as differences in style and theology between this and the First Epistle to the Thessalonians.

Scholars who support its authenticity view it as having been written around 51–52 AD, shortly after the First Epistle. Those who see it as a later composition assign a date of around 80–115 AD.

The original text was written in Koine Greek.

==Composition==


The authenticity of this epistle is still in widespread dispute. Even assuming that it is authentic, this epistle was not sent by Paul alone, but by three people: Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy. 

As Professor Ernest Best, New Testament scholar, explains the problem:

The structures of the two letters (to which Best refers) include opening greetings (1 Thessalonians 1:1a, 2 Thessalonians 1:1–2) and closing benedictions (1 Thessalonians 5:28, 2 Thessalonians 3:16d–18) which frame two, balancing, sections (AA&#x27;). In 2 Thessalonians these begin with similar successions of nine Greek words, at 1:3 and 2:13. The opening letter section (1:3–2:12) itself comprises two halves, 1:3–12 (where the introductory piece, A, is 1:3–5; the first development, B, is 1:6–10; and the paralleling and concluding development, B&#x27;, is 1:11–12) and 2:1–12 (with pieces: A 2:1–4, B 2:5–7, B&#x27; 2:8–12).

The second, balancing, letter section (2:13–3:16c) also comprises two halves: 2:13–3:5 (with pieces: A 2:13–14, B 2:15–17, B&#x27; 3:1–5) and 3:6–16c (with pieces: A 3:6–9, B 3:10–12, B&#x27; 3:13-16c). Of the twelve pieces in 2 Thessalonians, seven begin with &#x27;brother&#x27; introductions. Of the eighteen pieces in 1 Thessalonians, fourteen begin with &#x27;brother&#x27; introductions. In both letters, the sections balance in size and focus, and in many details. In 2 Thessalonians, in 2:5 and 3:10, for example, there is a structural balance of the use of &quot;when I was with you...&quot; and &quot;when we were with you...&quot;.

===Support for authenticity===
One piece of evidence for the authenticity of the epistle is that it was included in Marcion&#x27;s canon and the Muratorian fragment. It was also mentioned by name by Irenaeus, and quoted by Ignatius, Justin, and Polycarp.

G. Milligan argued that a church which possessed an authentic letter of Paul would be unlikely to accept a fake addressed to them. This argument was similarly supported by Colin Nicholl, who has put forward a substantial argument for the authenticity of Second Thessalonians. He points out that &quot;the pseudonymous view is[...] more vulnerable than most of its advocates conceded.[...] The lack of consensus regarding a date and destination[...] reflects a dilemma for this position: on the one hand, the date needs to be early enough for the letter to have been accepted as Pauline[...] [on] the other hand, the date and destination need to be such that the author could be confident that no contemporary of 1 Thessalonians [...] could have exposed 2 Thessalonians as a[...] forgery.&quot;

Another scholar who argues for the authenticity of this letter is Jerome Murphy-O&#x27;Connor. Admitting that there are stylistic problems between 2 Thessalonians and 1 Thessalonians, he argues that part of the problem is due to the composite nature of 2 Thessalonians. Murphy-O&#x27;Connor, along with many others scholars, argues that the current text of 2 Thessalonians is the product of merging two or more authentic letters of Paul. Once the text of this interpolated letter is removed and the two letters compared, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor asserts that this objection is &quot;drastically weakened&quot;, and concludes, &quot;The arguments against the authenticity of 2 Thessalonians are so weak that it is preferable to accept the traditional ascription of the letter to Paul.&quot;

Those who believe Paul was the author of 2 Thessalonians also note how Paul drew attention to the authenticity of the letter by signing it himself: &quot;I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, which is how I write in every letter.&quot; Bruce Metzger writes, &quot;Paul calls attention to his signature, which was added by his own hand as a token of genuineness to every letter of his (3:17).&quot; While some draw attention to this verse as an excessive attempt of a forging author to convince his readers of authenticity, a parallel stock phrase has been noted by some in the authentic Galatians 6:11. A parallel has also been noted among Cyprian where he stresses in his 9th epistle, under potential fears of the circulation of a forged letter, that examination of the style of the signature should be used in order to authenticate the letter: &quot;examine whether both the writing and the signature are yours and write back to us what the matter is in truth.&quot;

Other scholars who hold to authenticity include Gregory Beale, Gene L. Green, Ivor H Jones, Leon Morris, Ben Witherington III, Paul Foster, and Kretzmann. According to Leon Moris in 1986, the majority of current scholars at that time still held to Paul&#x27;s authorship of 2 Thessalonians.

===Opposition to authenticity===
At least as early as 1798, when Johann Ernst Christian Schmidt published his opinion, Paul&#x27;s authorship of this epistle was questioned. More recent challenges to this traditional belief came from scholars such as William Wrede in 1903 and Alfred Loisy in 1933, who challenged the traditional view of the authorship.

Regarding Nicholl&#x27;s argument for authenticity, on the one hand, it is worth noting that at least some forged Pauline letters were written well after a date modern scholars might deem early enough for the letter to be considered Pauline, such as the Third Epistle to the Corinthians, estimated to have been written around 160-170 CE; forgers were not forced to write close in time to the writers they imitated. On the other hand, it is not clear that a forger would need to ensure his writing was not contemporaneous with 1 Thessalonians if he was not actually writing the letter to Thessalonica; furthermore, if Nicholls is correct in believing 2 Thessalonians to be authentic, then Paul in 2 Thessalonians 2:2 provides evidence that forgeries in his name already existed in his own lifetime, discrediting his argument that forgers would take care to write far enough apart in time to ensure contemporaries could not denounce the forgery.

In his book &quot;Forged&quot;, New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman puts forward some of the most common arguments against the authenticity of 2 Thessalonians. For example, he argues that the views concerning the Second Coming of Christ expressed in 2 Thessalonians differ so strikingly from those found in 1 Thessalonians that they cannot be written by the same author.

Several modern scholars agree with Ehrman that 2 Thessalonians was not written by Paul but by an associate or disciple after his death. Scholars include Beverly Roberts Gaventa, Vincent Smiles, Udo Schnelle, Eugene Boring, and Joseph Kelly. Norman Perrin observes, &quot;The best understanding of 2 Thessalonians[...] is to see it as a deliberate imitation of 1 Thessalonians, updating the apostle&#x27;s thought.&quot; Perrin bases this claim on his hypothesis that prayer at the time usually treated God the Father as ultimate judge, rather than Jesus.

== Background ==
Thessalonica was the second city in Europe where Paul helped to create an organized Christian community. At some point after the first letter was sent, probably soon, some of the Thessalonians grew concerned over whether those who had died would share in the parousia. This letter was written in response to this concern. The problem then arises, as Raymond Brown points out, whether this letter is an authentic writing of Paul or written by one of his followers in his name.

If this letter is authentic, then it might have been written soon after Paul&#x27;s first letter to this community—or possibly years later. Brown notes that Paul &quot;most likely visited Thessalonica several times in his journeys to Macedonia&quot;. However, if the letter is not authentic, Brown notes that &quot;in some ways interpretation becomes more complex.&quot; Brown believes that the majority of scholars who advocate pseudonymity would place it towards the end of the first century, the same time that Revelation was written. These scholars emphasize the appearance of &quot;that man of sin&quot; in the second chapter of this letter, whether this personage is identified with the Antichrist of 1 John and Revelation, or with a historical person like Caligula.

==Content==

The traditional view is that the second epistle to the Thessalonians was probably written from Corinth not many months after the first.

Biblical commentator and pastor John MacArthur writes, &quot;The emphasis is on how to maintain a church with an effective testimony in proper response to sound eschatology and obedience to the truth.&quot;

Paul opens the letter praising this church for their faithfulness and perseverance in the face of persecution:

The letter contains a whole chapter regarding the second advent of Christ, among other themes and instructions.

From the inference of 2:1–2, the Thessalonians were faced with a false teaching, saying that Christ had already returned. This error is corrected in chapter 2 (2:1–12), where Paul tells the Thessalonians that a great tribulation must occur before Christ&#x27;s return. Seeing as how this series of events has not yet happened, his argument reads, Christ cannot have returned yet. He then expresses thanks that his readers were the elect of God, chosen for salvation and saved by his grace through faith, and thus not susceptible to the deception of the &quot;Great Apostasy,&quot; (2 Thessalonians 2:13–14) first mentioned here as is the &quot;Katechon&quot; (2 Thessalonians 2:6–7).

In 2 Thessalonians 2:15, Paul instructs his readers to &quot;[h]old fast to the traditions (, ) which you were taught, whether by word of mouth or by our letter.&quot; Quoting this verse, in his &quot;On the Holy Spirit&quot;, Basil the Great writes, &quot;These [traditions] have been passed on by word of mouth from Paul or from the other apostles, without necessarily being written down,&quot; and mentions the Trinitarian confession of faith as an example of &quot;unwritten tradition&quot;. Cyril of Jerusalem shares a similar view in his &quot;Catechetical Lectures&quot;, argues that the traditions stated by Paul should be preserved and memorized, at a minimum in the form of the Creed. In his homily on this verse, John Chrysostom differentiates oral tradition from written tradition. At that time, the oral tradition has been defined as the &quot;tradition&quot; and the written tradition as &quot;Scripture&quot;, united together in &quot;the authenticity of their apostolic origin&quot;. Everett Ferguson says Paul&#x27;s reference to tradition implicates that &quot;what was delivered was from the Lord&quot;, and John Stott calls the tradition () &quot;apostolic &#x27;tradition.

The letter continues by encouraging the Thessalonian church to stand firm in their faith, and to &quot;keep away from every brother who leads an unruly life and not according to the tradition which you received from us[...] do not associate with him, so that he will be put to shame. Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother&quot; (2 Thessalonians 3:6–7, 14–15).

Paul ends this letter by saying, &quot;I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all&quot; (2 Thessalonians 3:17–18). Macarthur writes, &quot;Paul added an identifying signature (cf. 1 Corinthians 16:21; Colossians 4:18) so his readers could be sure he was truly the author.&quot;

A passage from this book reading &quot;For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat&quot;, (3:10), was later adapted by Vladimir Lenin as an adage of the Soviet Union: &quot;he who does not work, neither shall he eat&quot;.

<text>A poetry slam is a competitive art event in which poets perform spoken word poetry before a live audience and a panel of judges. While formats can vary, slams are often loud and lively, with audience participation, cheering and dramatic delivery.

Poetry slams began in Chicago in the 1980s, with the first slam competition designed to move poetry recitals from academia to a popular audience. American poet Marc Smith, believing the poetry scene at the time was &quot;too structured and stuffy&quot;, began experimenting by attending open-microphone poetry readings, and then turning them into slams by introducing the element of competition.

The performances at a poetry slam are judged as much on enthusiasm and style as content, and poets may compete as individuals or in teams. The judging is often handled by a panel of judges, typically five, who are usually selected from the audience. Sometimes the poets are judged by audience response.

==History==

American poet Marc Smith was credited with starting the poetry slam at the Get Me High Lounge in Chicago in November 1984. In July 1986, the original slam moved to its permanent home, the Green Mill Jazz Club. In 1987, the Ann Arbor Poetry Slam was founded by Vince Keuter and eventually made its home at the Heidelberg (moving later 2010, 2013, and 2015 to its new home at Espresso Royale). In August 1988, the first poetry slam held in New York City was hosted by Bob Holman at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. In 1990, the first National Poetry Slam took place at Fort Mason, San Francisco. This slam included teams from Chicago and San Francisco, and an individual poet from New York. Soon afterward, poetry slam increased popularity allowed some poets to make full-time careers in performance and competition, touring the United States and eventually the world.

In 1999, National Poetry Slam, held in major cities each year, was in Chicago. The event was covered nationally by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;60 Minutes&quot; (CBS). &quot;60 Minutes&quot; taped a 20 segment on slam poetry with live poetry scenes at Chopin Theatre.

In 2001, the grounding of aircraft following the September 11 attacks left a number of performers stranded in cities they had been performing in. After the attacks, a new wave of poetry slam started within San Francisco.

, the National Poetry Slam featured 72 certified teams, culminating in five days of competition.

Today, there are poetry slam competitions in a number of countries around the globe.

Poetry Slam, Inc. used to sanction three major annual poetry competitions (for poets 18+) on a national and international scale: the National Poetry Slam (NPS), the individual World Poetry Slam (iWPS), and the Women of the World Poetry Slam (WoWPS). The last National Poetry Slam took place in Chicago 2018, after which PSi&#x27;s voting body elected to cease its three major 2019 poetry slams. The WoWPS has been held since 2020 through a new website.

==Format==
In a poetry slam, members of the audience are chosen by a master of ceremonies or host to act as judges for the event. In the national slam, there are five judges, but smaller slams generally have three. After each poet performs, each judge awards a score to that poem. Scores generally range between zero and ten. The highest and lowest score are dropped, giving each performance a rating between zero and thirty points.

Before the competition begins, the host will often bring up a &quot;sacrificial&quot; poet, whom the judges will score in order to calibrate their judging.

A single round at a standard slam consists of performances by all eligible poets. Most slams last multiple rounds, and many involve the elimination of lower-scoring poets in successive rounds. An elimination format might run 8-4-2; eight poets in the first round, four in the second, and two in the last. Some slams do not eliminate poets at all. The Green Mill usually runs its slams with six poets in the first round. At the end of the slam, the poet with the highest number of points earned is the winner.

The Boston Poetry Slam takes a different approach; it uses the 8-4-2 three-round format, but the poets go head-to-head in separate bouts within the round.

Props, costumes, and music are forbidden in slams, which differs greatly from its immediate predecessor, performance poetry. Hedwig Gorski, the founder of performance poetry as a distinct genre, saw props, costumes, and music as essential for a complete theatrical experience while also following theorist Jerzy Grotowski&#x27;s Poor Theater by blurring lines between the real person, actor, and speakers in scripted literary art. Other rules for slams enforce a time limit of three minutes (and a grace period of ten seconds), after which a poet&#x27;s score may be docked according to how long the poem exceeded the limit. Many youth slams, however, allow the poets up to three and a half minutes on stage. The slams at the Individual World Poetry Slam and Women of the World Poetry Slam competitions had a 1-minute round, a 2-minute round, a 3-minute round, and a 4-minute round.

==Competition types==

In an &quot;Open Slam&quot;, the most common slam type, competition is open to all who wish to compete, given the number of slots available. In an &quot;Invitational Slam&quot;, only those invited to do so may compete.

In 1998, spoken word poet Emanuel Xavier created the House of Xavier and the Glam Slam, an annual downtown arts event staged at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe (and later at the Bowery Poetry Club). The fusion of ball culture and poetry slam competitions featured four open categories such as Best Erotic Poem in Sexy Underwear or Lingerie, Best Verbal Vogue and Best Love Poem in Fire Engine Red (alternately Best Bitter Break Up Poem in Blue). Winners of each category received a trophy and went on to compete for the Grand Prize title of Glam Slam Champion. The annual competition was first held in New York City and then London until 2010.

Poetry Slam, Inc., holds several national and international competitions, including the Individual World Poetry Slam, the National Poetry Slam and The Women of the World Poetry Slam. The current (2013) IWPS champion was Ed Mabrey. Ed Mabrey was the only three-time IWPS champion in the history of the event. The current (2013) National Poetry Slam Team champions are Slam New Orleans (SNO), who have won the competition for the second year in a row. The current (2014) Women of the World Poetry Slam Champion was Dominique Christina.

From 10 to 11 December 2016 Salzburg, Austria, held a world-record poetry slam competition (28 hours of classic slam poetry) and broke the so-far-record of Nuremberg, Germany (25 hours), by Michl Jakob. The winner of the competition (Friedrich Herrmann) scored one point better in the finals than the second ranked (Darryl Kiermeier). The event was organized by Lukas Wagner (Slamlabor) and took place in the SN-Saal of the Salzburger Nachrichten.

Similar to the House of Xavier&#x27;s Glam Slam, a &quot;Theme Slam&quot; was one in which all performances must conform to a specified theme, genre, or formal constraint. Themes may include Nerd, Erotica, Queer, Improv, or other conceptual limitations. In theme slams, poets can sometimes be allowed to break &quot;traditional&quot; slam rules. For instance, they sometimes allow performance of work by another poet (e.g. the &quot;Dead Poet Slam&quot;, in which all work must be by a deceased poet). They can also allow changes on the restrictions on costumes or props (e.g. the Swedish &quot;Triathlon&quot; slams that allow for a poet, musician, and dancer to all take the stage at the same time), changing the judging structure (e.g. having a specific guest judge), or changing the time limits (e.g. a &quot;1-2-3&quot; slam with three rounds of one minute, two minutes, and three minutes, respectively).

Although theme slams may seem restricting in nature, slam venues frequently use them to advocate participation by particular and perhaps underrepresented demographics (which vary from slam to slam), like younger poets and women.

==Poem==
Poetry slams can feature a broad range of voices, styles, cultural traditions, and approaches to writing and performance. The originator of performance poetry, Hedwig Gorski, credits slam poetry for carrying on the poetics of ancient oral poetry designed to grab attention in barrooms and public squares.
Some poets are closely associated with the vocal delivery style found in hip-hop music and draw heavily on the tradition of dub poetry, a rhythmic and politicized genre belonging to black and particularly West Indian culture. Others employ an unrhyming narrative formula. Some use traditional theatrical devices including shifting voices and tones, while others may recite an entire poem in ironic monotone. Some poets use nothing but their words to deliver a poem, while others stretch the boundaries of the format, tap-dancing or beatboxing or using highly choreographed movements.

What is a dominant/successful style one year may not be passed to the next. Cristin O&#x27;Keefe Aptowicz, slam poet and author of &quot;Words in Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam&quot;, was quoted in an interview on the Best American Poetry blog as saying:

One of the more interesting end products (to me, at least) of this constant shifting is that poets in the slam always worry that something—a style, a project, a poet—will become so dominant that it will kill the scene, but it never does. Ranting hipsters, freestyle rappers, bohemian drifters, proto-comedians, mystical shamans and gothy punks have all had their time at the top of the slam food chain, but in the end, something different always comes along and challenges the poets to try something new.
One of the goals of a poetry slam is to challenge the authority of anyone who claims absolute authority over literary value. No poet is beyond critique, as everyone is dependent upon the goodwill of the audience. Since only the poets with the best cumulative scores advance to the final round of the night, the structure assures that the audience gets to choose from whom they will hear more poetry. Audience members furthermore become part of each poem&#x27;s presence, thus breaking down the barriers between poet/performer, critic, and audience.

Bob Holman, a poetry activist and former slammaster of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, once called the movement &quot;the democratization of verse&quot;. In 2005, Holman was also quoted as saying: &quot;The spoken word revolution is led a lot by women and by poets of color. It gives a depth to the nation&#x27;s dialogue that you don&#x27;t hear on the floor of Congress. I want a floor of Congress to look more like a National Poetry Slam. That would make me happy.&quot;

==Criticism==
At the 1993 National Poetry Slam in San Francisco, a participating team from Canada (Kedrick James, Alex Ferguson and John Sobol) wrote, printed and circulated an instant broadside titled &quot;Like Lambs to the Slammer&quot;, that criticized what they perceived as the complacency, conformity, and calculated tear-jerking endemic to the poetry slam scene. Over time, slam poetry has been criticized for lacking depth and for its features, e.g., &quot;slam voice,&quot; which may limit the range of emotion it can express.

In an interview in the &quot;Paris Review&quot;, literary critic Harold Bloom wrote

I can&#x27;t bear these accounts I read in the &quot;Times&quot; and elsewhere of these poetry slams, in which various young men and women in various late-spots are declaiming rant and nonsense at each other. The whole thing is judged by an applause meter which is actually not there, but might as well be. This isn&#x27;t even silly; it is the death of art.

Poet and lead singer of King Missile, John S. Hall, has also long been a vocal opponent, taking issue with such factors as its inherently competitive nature and what he considers its lack of stylistic diversity. He recalls seeing his first slam, at the Nuyorican Poets Café: &quot;...I hated it. And it made me really uncomfortable and ... it was very much like a sport, and I was interested in poetry in large part because it was like the antithesis of sports. ... [I]t seemed to me like a very macho, masculine form of poetry and not at all what I was interested in.&quot;

The poet Tim Clare offers a &quot;for and against&quot; account of the phenomenon in &quot;Slam: A Poetic Dialogue&quot;.

Ironically, slam poetry movement founder Marc Smith has been critical of the commercially successful Def Poetry television and Broadway live stage shows produced by Russell Simmons, decrying it as &quot;an exploitive entertainment [program that] diminished the value and aesthetic of performance poetry&quot;.

==International awards and Poetry Slam World Cup==
At the European level, the European Poetry Slam Championship (or European Slampionship) takes place every year.

The Poetry Slam World Cup (Coupe du Monde de Slam, organised in France) also takes place every year. In 2022, Italy won the XVI Poetry Slam World Cup for the second time, represented by performance artist, writer, poet, and actor Lorenzo Maragoni, member of the artistic collective WOW - Incendi Spontanei, same as the former world champion Giuliano Logos.


==Academia==
As of 2011, four poets who have competed at National Poetry Slam have won National Endowment of the Arts (NEA) Fellowships for Literature:
* Hal Sirowitz (who was on the Nuyorican Poets Cafe Poetry Slam team in 1993) won an NEA Fellowship in Poetry in 1994
* Jeffrey McDaniel (who was on numerous DC and California slam teams in the mid to late 1990s) won an NEA Fellowship in Poetry in 2003
* Cristin O&#x27;Keefe Aptowicz (who was on the NYC-Urbana Poetry Slam team in 1998, 2001, 2003 and 2010) won an NEA Fellowship in Poetry in 2011

As of 2017, one poet who has competed at National Poetry Slam has won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry: Tyehimba Jess, who competed as a part of Chicago&#x27;s Green Mill team twice.

A number of poets belong to both academia and slam: 
* Jeffrey McDaniel slammed on several poetry slam teams, and has since published several books and currently teaches at Sarah Lawrence College. 
* Patricia Smith, a four-time national slam champion, went on to win several prestigious literary awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship and an NEA Fellowship, and being inducted into the International Literary Hall of Fame for Writers of African Descent in 2006. 
* Bob Holman founded the Nuyorican Poetry Slam has taught for years at the New School, Bard, Columbia and NYU. Craig Arnold won the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition and has competed at slams. 
* Kip Fulbeck, a professor of art at the University of California, Santa Barbara competed in slam in the early-1990s and initiated the first spoken word course to be taught as part of a college art program&#x27;s core curriculum. 
* Javon Johnson was national slam poetry champion in 2003 and 2004, wrote his dissertation on slam poetry and published an article in text and performance quarterly about black masculinity and sexism in the slam community. 
* Susan Somers-Willett wrote the book &quot;The Cultural Politics of Slam Poetry&quot;, exploring the relationships between slam, identity, and politics. 
* Karyna McGlynn has devoted much attention to the merging of the poetry slam community and the academic community in her works.

Henry S. Taylor, winner of the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, competed in the 1997 National Poetry Slam as an individual and placed 75th out of 150.

While slam poetry has often been ignored in traditional higher learning institutions, it slowly is finding its way into courses and programs of study. For example, at Berklee College of Music, in Boston, slam poetry is now available as a minor course of study.

==Youth movement==
Slam poetry has found popularity as a form of self-expression among many teenagers. Young Chicago Authors (YCA) provides workshops, mentoring, and competition opportunities to youth in the Chicago area. Every year YCA presents Louder Than a Bomb, the world&#x27;s largest team-based youth slam and subject of a documentary by the same name. San Francisco-based a non-profit organization Youth Speaks Inc has also been running the Brave New Voices poetry festival since 1998. The youth poetry slam movement was the focus of a documentary film series produced by HBO and released in 2009. It featured poets from Youth Speaks, Urban Word, Louder than a Bomb and other related youth poetry slam organizations.

In a 2005 interview, one of slam&#x27;s best known poets Saul Williams praised the youth poetry slam movement, explaining:
In 2012, more than 12,000 young people took part in an England-wide youth slam &quot;Shake the Dust&quot;, organized by Apples and Snakes as part of the London 2012 Festival. An Open Letter to Honey Singh, a rap video featuring Rene Sharanya Verma performing at Delhi Poetry Slam, went viral on YouTube receiving over 1.5 million hits.

==In Africa==
In 2017 poet Malika Outtara estimated that there were only fifteen African women slam poets in total.

===Burkina Faso===
One of the most notable figures in the slam scene in Burkina Faso is Malika Outtara. In 2019 she set up the Slamazone Foundation of which she is President, in order to fund raise for social issues in her country.

===Egypt===
Slam Poetry has been in Egypt since the twentieth century and was introduced by Hussain Shafiq al-Misry. According to al-Misry, having a variety jobs gave him the experience to understand the struggles of Egyptian people in different classes of life. He had good knowledge of Arabic literature, grammar and some commonly used foreign words as well as slang; which he used to form Halamantishi poetry. Muhammad Ragab Bayyoumi in 1986 wrote an article entitled Hussein Shafiq al-Misry: Ustaz la Tilmeeth lah&quot; (Hussein Shafiq al-Misry: A Teacher with No Student of His) in which he introduced al-Misry&#x27;s poems and explained al-Misry&#x27;s literary poetry techniques. In Egypt Performance Poetry is new in popularity, the term &quot;Ash-Shi&#x27;r al-Mu&#x27;adda&quot; was recently introduced as the term for performance poetry. Poets such as  Bayram At-Tunisi, Ahmad Rami, and Kamel Ash-Shennawy paved the way after al-Misry with lyrical slam poems that use a melodic rhythm to attract the audience.

==In Japan==
In Japan, Katsunori Kusunoki, a professor of communications at Toyo University, found a way to incorporate slam poetry into his students’ lives; allowing them to showcase their competitiveness and love of poetry by putting together “poetry boxing” matches. Kusunoki created annual “poetry boxing” tournaments in order to provide a medium for expression and social interaction . The rules are “16 boxers face off in pairs in competitions of stand-up verse that last for three minutes. Winners compete in series of challenges such as timed presentation and a round of improvised jousting.” A master of ceremonies adds to the event by providing nicknames for the competitors. Kusunoki&#x27;s goal was to try to get his students to open up by breaking language barriers and expressing themselves.

<text>A sestina (, from &quot;sesto&quot;, sixth; Old Occitan: &quot;cledisat&quot; ; also known as &quot;sestine&quot;, &quot;sextine&quot;, &quot;sextain&quot;) is a fixed verse form consisting of six stanzas of six lines each, normally followed by a three-line envoi. The words that end each line of the first stanza are used as line endings in each of the following stanzas, rotated in a set pattern.

The invention of the form is usually attributed to Arnaut Daniel, a troubadour of 12th-century Provence, and the first sestinas were written in the Occitan language of that region. The form was cultivated by his fellow troubadours, then by other poets across Continental Europe in the subsequent centuries; they contributed to what would become the &quot;standard form&quot; of the sestina. The earliest example of the form in English appeared in 1579, though they were rarely written in Britain until the end of the 19th century. The sestina remains a popular poetic form, and many sestinas continue to be written by contemporary poets.

==History==

The oldest-known sestina is &quot;Lo ferm voler qu&#x27;el cor m&#x27;intra&quot;, written around 1200 by Arnaut Daniel, a troubadour of Aquitanian origin; he refers to it as &quot;cledisat&quot;, meaning, more or less, &quot;interlock&quot;. Hence, Daniel is generally considered the form&#x27;s inventor, though it has been suggested that he may only have innovated an already existing form. Nevertheless, two other original troubadouric sestinas are recognised, the best known being &quot;Eras, pus vey mon benastruc&quot; by Guilhem Peire Cazals de Caortz; there are also two contrafacta built on the same end-words, the best known being &quot;Ben gran avoleza intra&quot; by Bertran de Born. These early sestinas were written in Old Occitan; the form started spilling into Italian with Dante in the 13th century; by the 15th, it was used in Portuguese by Luís de Camões.

The involvement of Dante and Petrarch in establishing the sestina form, together with the contributions of others in the country, account for its classification as an Italian verse form—despite not originating there. The result was that the sestina was re-imported into France from Italy in the 16th century. Pontus de Tyard was the first poet to attempt the form in French, and the only one to do so prior to the 19th century; he introduced a partial rhyme scheme into his sestina.

===English===
An early version of the sestina in Middle English is the &quot;Hymn to Venus&quot; by Elizabeth Woodville (1437–1492); it is an &quot;elaboration&quot; on the form, found in one single manuscript. It is a six-stanza poem that praises Venus, the goddess of love, and consists of six seven-line stanzas in which the first line of each stanza is also its last line, and the lines of the first stanza provide the first lines for each subsequent stanza.

The first appearance of the sestina in English print is &quot;Ye wastefull woodes&quot;, comprising lines 151–89 of the August Æglogue in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Calendar&quot;, published in 1579. It is in unrhymed iambic pentameter, but the order of end-words in each stanza is non-standard – ending 123456, 612345, etc. – each stanza promoting the previous final end-word to the first line, but otherwise leaving the order intact; the envoi order is (1) 2 / (3) 4 / (5) 6. This scheme was set by the Spaniard Gutierre de Cetina.

Although they appeared in print later, Philip Sidney&#x27;s three sestinas may have been written earlier, and are often credited as the first in English. The first published (toward the end of Book I of &quot;The Countess of Pembroke&#x27;s Arcadia&quot;, 1590) is the double sestina &quot;Ye Goatherd Gods&quot;. In this variant the standard end-word pattern is repeated for twelve stanzas, ending with a three-line envoi, resulting in a poem of 75 lines. Two others were published in subsequent editions of the &quot;Arcadia&quot;. The second, &quot;Since wailing is a bud of causeful sorrow&quot;, is in the &quot;standard&quot; form. Like &quot;Ye Goatherd Gods&quot; it is written in unrhymed iambic pentameter and uses exclusively feminine endings, reflecting the Italian &quot;endecasillabo&quot;. The third, &quot;Farewell, O sun, Arcadia&#x27;s clearest light&quot;, is the first rhyming sestina in English: it is in iambic pentameters and follows the standard end-word scheme, but rhymes ABABCC in the first stanza (the rhyme scheme necessarily changes in each subsequent stanza, a consequence of which is that the 6th stanza is in rhyming couplets). Sidney uses the same envoi structure as Spenser. William Drummond of Hawthornden published two sestinas (which he called &quot;sextains&quot;) in 1616, which copy the form of Sidney&#x27;s rhyming sestina. After this, there is an absence of notable sestinas for over 250 years, with John Frederick Nims noting that, &quot;... there is not a single sestina in the three volumes of the Oxford anthologies that cover the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&quot;

In the 1870s, there was a revival of interest in French forms, led by Andrew Lang, Austin Dobson, Edmund Gosse, W. E. Henley, John Payne, and others. The earliest sestina of this period is Algernon Charles Swinburne&#x27;s &quot;Sestina&quot;. It is in iambic pentameter rhyming ABABAB in the first stanza; each stanza begins by repeating the previous end-words 6 then 1, but the following 4 lines repeat the remaining end-words &quot;ad lib&quot;; the envoi is (1) 4 / (2) 3 / (5) 6. In the same volume (&quot;Poems and Ballads, Second Series&quot;, 1878) Swinburne introduces a &quot;double sestina&quot; (&quot;The Complaint of Lisa&quot;) that is unlike Sidney&#x27;s: it comprises 12 stanzas of 12 iambic pentameter lines each, the first stanza rhyming ABCABDCEFEDF. Similar to his &quot;Sestina&quot;, each stanza first repeats end-words 12 then 1 of the previous stanza; the rest are &quot;ad lib&quot;. The envoi is (12) 10 / (8) 9 / (7) 4 / (3) 6 / (2) 1 / (11) 5.

From the 1930s, a revival of the form took place across the English-speaking world, led by poets such as W. H. Auden, and the 1950s were described as the &quot;age of the sestina&quot; by James E. B. Breslin. &quot;Sestina: Altaforte&quot; by Ezra Pound, &quot;Paysage moralisé&quot; by W. H. Auden, and &quot;Sestina&quot; by Elizabeth Bishop are distinguished modern examples of the sestina. &quot;Histoire&quot; by Harry Mathews adds an additional Oulipian constraint: the end words wildly misusing ideological or prejudicial terms. The sestina remains a popular closed verse form, and many sestinas continue to be written by contemporary poets; notable examples include &quot;Six Bad Poets&quot; by Christopher Reid, &quot;The Guest Ellen at the Supper for Street People&quot; by David Ferry and &quot;IVF&quot; by Kona Macphee.

==Form==
Although the sestina has been subject to many revisions throughout its development, there remain several features that define the form. The sestina is composed of six stanzas of six lines (sixains), followed by a stanza of three lines (a tercet). There is no rhyme within the stanzas; instead the sestina is structured through a recurrent pattern of the words that end each line, a technique known as &quot;lexical repetition&quot;.

In the original form composed by Daniel, each line is of ten syllables, except the first of each stanza which are of seven. The established form, as developed by Petrarch and Dante, was in hendecasyllables. Since then, changes to the line length have been a relatively common variant, such that Stephanie Burt has written: &quot;sestinas, as the form exists today, [do not] require expertise with inherited meter ...&quot;.

The pattern that the line-ending words follow is often explained if the numbers 1 to 6 are allowed to stand for the end-words of the first stanza. Each successive stanza takes its pattern based upon a bottom-up pairing of the lines of the preceding stanza (i.e., last and first, then second-from-last and second, then third-from-last and third). Given that the pattern for the first stanza is 123456, this produces 615243 in the second stanza, numerical series which corresponds, as Paolo Canettieri has shown, to the way in which the points on the dice are arranged. This genetic hypothesis is supported by the fact that Arnaut Daniel was a strong dice player and various images related to this game are present in his poetic texts.

Another way of visualising the pattern of line-ending words for each stanza is by the procedure known as &quot;retrogradatio cruciata&quot;, which may be rendered as &quot;backward crossing&quot;. The second stanza can be seen to have been formed from three sets of pairs (6–1, 5–2, 4–3), or two triads (1–2–3, 4–5–6). The 1–2–3 triad appears in its original order, but the 4–5–6 triad is reversed and superimposed upon it.

The pattern of the line-ending words in a sestina is represented both numerically and alphabetically in the following table:

The sixth stanza is followed by a tercet that is known variably by the French term envoi, the Occitan term tornada, or, with reference to its size in relation to the preceding stanzas, a &quot;half-stanza&quot;. It consists of three lines that include all six of the line-ending words of the preceding stanzas. This should take the pattern of 2–5, 4–3, 6–1 (numbers relative to the first stanza); the first end-word of each pair can occur anywhere in the line, while the second must end the line. However, the end-word order of the envoi is no longer strictly enforced.

The sestina has been subject to some variations, with changes being made to both the size and number of stanzas, and also to individual line length. A &quot;double sestina&quot; is the name given to either: two sets of six six-line stanzas, with a three-line envoy (for a total of 75 lines), or twelve twelve-line stanzas, with a six-line envoy (for a total of 150 lines). Examples of either variation are rare; &quot;Ye Goatherd Gods&quot; by Philip Sidney is a notable example of the former variation, while &quot;The Complaint of Lisa&quot; by Algernon Charles Swinburne is a notable example of the latter variation. In the former variation, the original pattern of line-ending words, i.e. that of the first stanza, recurs in the seventh stanza, and thus the entire change of pattern occurs twice throughout. In the second variation, the pattern of line-ending words returns to the starting sequence in the eleventh stanza; thus it does not, unlike the &quot;single&quot; sestina, allow for every end-word to occupy each of the stanza ends; end-words 5 and 10 fail to couple between stanzas.

==Effect==
The structure of the sestina, which demands adherence to a strict and arbitrary order, produces several effects within a poem. Stephanie Burt notes that, &quot;The sestina has served, historically, as a complaint&quot;, its harsh demands acting as &quot;signs for deprivation or duress&quot;. The structure can enhance the subject matter that it orders; in reference to Elizabeth Bishop&#x27;s &quot;A Miracle for Breakfast&quot;, David Caplan suggests that the form&#x27;s &quot;harshly arbitrary demands echo its subject&#x27;s&quot;. Nevertheless, the form&#x27;s structure has been criticised; Paul Fussell considers the sestina to be of &quot;dubious structural expressiveness&quot; when composed in English and, irrespective of how it is used, &quot;would seem to be [a form] that gives more structural pleasure to the contriver than to the apprehender&quot;.

Margaret Spanos highlights &quot;a number of corresponding levels of tension and resolution&quot; resulting from the structural form, including: structural, semantic and aesthetic tensions. She believes that the aesthetic tension, which results from the &quot;&quot;conception&quot; of its mathematical completeness and perfection&quot;, set against the &quot;&quot;experiences&quot; of its labyrinthine complexities&quot; can be resolved in the apprehension of the &quot;harmony of the whole&quot;.

The strength of the sestina, according to Stephen Fry, is the &quot;repetition and recycling of elusive patterns that cannot be quite held in the mind all at once&quot;. For Shanna Compton, these patterns are easily discernible by newcomers to the form; she says that: &quot;Even someone unfamiliar with the form&#x27;s rules can tell by the end of the second stanza ... what&#x27;s going on ...&quot;.

==Examples==

* The 1972 television play &quot;Between Time and Timbuktu&quot;, based on the writings of Kurt Vonnegut, is about a poet-astronaut who wanted to compose a sestina in outer space. Vonnegut wrote a sestina for the production.

<doc id="28830" wikidata="Q7366" url="?curid=28830" title="Song">
<text>A song is a musical composition performed by the human voice. The voice often carries the melody (a series of distinct and fixed pitches) using patterns of sound and silence. Songs have a structure to them, such as the common ABA form, and are usually made of sections that are repeated or performed with variation later. A song without instruments is said to be a cappella.

Written words created specifically for music, or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music, it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs composed in a simple style that are learned informally by ear are often referred to as folk songs. Songs composed for the mass market, designed to be sung by professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows, are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers, and lyricists; art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed in studios and an audio recording is made, or they are performed live for audience. (In some cases a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded.) Songs may also appear in theatre (e.g., opera), films and TV shows.

A song may be for a solo singer, a lead singer supported by background singers, a duet, trio, or larger ensemble involving more voices singing in harmony, although the term is generally not used for large classical music vocal forms including opera and oratorio, which use terms such as aria and recitative instead. A song can be sung without accompaniment by instrumentalists (a cappella) or accompanied by instruments. In popular music, a singer may perform with an acoustic guitarist, pianist, organist, accordionist, or a backing band. In jazz, a singer may perform with a single pianist, a small combo (such as a trio or quartet), or with a big band. A Classical singer may perform with a single pianist, a small ensemble, or an orchestra. In jazz and blues, singers often learn songs by ear and they may improvise some melody lines. In Classical music, melodies are written by composers in sheet music format, so singers learn to read music.

Songs with more than one voice to a part singing in polyphony or harmony are considered choral works. Songs can be broadly divided into many different forms and types, depending on the criteria used. Through semantic widening, a broader sense of the word &quot;song&quot; may refer to instrumentals, such as the 19th century &quot;Songs Without Words&quot; pieces for solo piano.

==Genres==

===Art===

Art songs are songs created for performance by classical artists, often with piano or other instrumental accompaniment, although they can be sung solo. Art songs require strong vocal technique, an understanding of language, diction, and poetry for interpretation. Though such singers may also perform popular or folk songs on their programs, these characteristics and the use of poetry are what distinguish art songs from popular songs. Art songs are a tradition from most European countries, and now other countries with classical music traditions. German-speaking communities use the term art song (&quot;Kunstlied&quot;) to distinguish so-called serious compositions from folk songs (&quot;Volkslied&quot;). The lyrics are often written by a poet or lyricist and the music separately by a composer. Art songs may be more formally complicated than popular or folk songs, though many early Lieder by the likes of Franz Schubert are in simple strophic form. The accompaniment of European art songs is considered as an important part of the composition. Some art songs are so revered that they take on characteristics of national identification.

Art songs emerge from the tradition of singing romantic love songs, often to an ideal or imaginary person and from religious songs. The troubadours and bards of Europe began the documented tradition of romantic songs, continued by the Elizabethan lutenists. Some of the earliest art songs are found in the music of Henry Purcell. The tradition of the romance, a love song with a flowing accompaniment, often in triple meter, entered opera in the 19th century and spread from there throughout Europe. It expanded into popular music and became one of the underpinnings of popular songs. While a romance generally has a simple accompaniment, art songs tend to have complicated, sophisticated accompaniments that underpin, embellish, illustrate or provide contrast to the voice. Sometimes the accompaniment performer has the melody, while the voice sings a more dramatic part.

===Folk===

Folk songs are songs of often anonymous origin (or are public domain) that are transmitted orally. They are frequently a major aspect of national or cultural identity. Art songs often approach the status of folk songs when people forget who the author was. Folk songs are also frequently transmitted non-orally (that is, as sheet music), especially in the modern era. Folk songs exist in almost every culture. The German term &quot;Volkslied&quot; was coined in the late 18th century, in the process of collecting older songs and writing new ones. Popular songs may eventually become folk songs by the same process of detachment from their source. Folk songs are more or less in the public domain by definition, though there are many folk song entertainers who publish and record copyrighted original material. This tradition led also to the singer-songwriter style of performing, where an artist has written confessional poetry or personal statements and sings them set to music, most often with guitar accompaniment.

There are many genres of popular songs, including torch songs, ballads, novelty songs, anthems, rock, blues and soul songs as well as indie music. Other commercial genres include rapping. Folk songs include ballads, lullabies, love songs, mourning songs, dance songs, work songs, ritual songs and many more.

====Sporting====
A sporting song is a folk song that celebrates fox hunting, horse racing, gambling and other recreations.

Although songs about boxers and successful racehorses were common in the nineteenth century, few are performed by current singers. In particular, fox-hunting is considered politically incorrect. The most famous song about a foxhunter, &quot;D&#x27;ye ken John Peel&quot; was included in &quot;The National Song Book&quot; in 1906 and is now often heard as a marching tune. A. L. Lloyd recorded two EPs of sporting ballads; &quot;Bold Sportsmen All&quot; (1958) and &quot;Gamblers and Sporting Blades (Songs of the Ring and the Racecourse)&quot; (1962). The High Level Ranters and Martin Wyndham-Read recorded an album called &quot;English Sporting Ballads&quot; in 1977. &quot;The Prospect Before Us&quot; (1976) by The Albion Dance Band contains two rarely heard hunting songs.

===Lute===

The term lute song is given to a music style from the late 16th century to early 17th century, late Renaissance to early Baroque, that was predominantly in England and France. Lute songs were generally in strophic form or verse repeating with a homophonic texture. The composition was written for a solo voice with an accompaniment, usually the lute. It was not uncommon for other forms of accompaniments such as bass viol or other string instruments, and could also be written for more voices. The composition could be performed either solo or with a small group of instruments.

===Part===

A part song, part-song or partsong is a form of choral music that consists of a secular (vs. ecclesiastical) song written or arranged for several vocal parts. Part songs are commonly sung by an SATB choir, but sometimes for an all-male or all-female ensemble.

===Patter===

The patter song is characterized by a moderately fast to very fast tempo with a rapid succession of rhythmic patterns in which each syllable of text corresponds to one note. It is a staple of comic opera, especially Gilbert and Sullivan, but it has also been used in musicals and elsewhere.

<doc id="28833" wikidata="Q756715" url="?curid=28833" title="Sir Gawain and the Green Knight">
<text>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is a late 14th-century chivalric romance in Middle English alliterative verse. The author is unknown; the title was given centuries later. It is one of the best-known Arthurian stories, with its plot combining two types of folk motifs: the beheading game and the exchange of winnings. Written in stanzas of alliterative verse, each of which ends in a rhyming bob and wheel, it draws on Welsh, Irish, and English stories, as well as the French chivalric tradition. It is an important example of a chivalric romance, which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest that tests his prowess. It remains popular in modern English renderings from J. R. R. Tolkien, Simon Armitage, and others, as well as through film and stage adaptations.

The story describes how Sir Gawain, who was not yet a knight of King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table, accepts a challenge from a mysterious &quot;Green Knight&quot; who dares any man to strike him with his axe if he will take a return blow in a year and a day. Gawain accepts and beheads him, after which the Green Knight stands, picks up his head, and reminds Gawain of the appointed time. In his struggles to keep his bargain, Gawain demonstrates chivalry and loyalty until his honour is called into question by a test involving the lord and the lady of the castle at which he is a guest. The poem survives in one manuscript, Cotton Nero A.x., which also includes three religious narrative poems: &quot;Pearl&quot;, &quot;Cleanness&quot;, and &quot;Patience&quot;. All four are written in a North West Midlands dialect of Middle English, and are thought to be by the same author, dubbed the &quot;Pearl Poet&quot; or &quot;Gawain Poet&quot;.

==Synopsis==

In Camelot on New Year&#x27;s eve, King Arthur&#x27;s court is exchanging gifts and waiting for the feasting to start, when the king asks to see or hear of an exciting adventure. A gigantic figure, entirely green in appearance and riding a green horse, rides unexpectedly into the hall. He wears no armour but bears an axe in one hand and a holly bough in the other. Refusing to fight anyone there on the grounds that they are all too weak, he insists he has come for a friendly Christmas game: someone is to strike him once with his axe, on the condition that the Green Knight may return the blow in a year and a day. The axe will belong to whoever accepts this deal. King Arthur is prepared to accept the challenge when it appears no other knight will dare, but Sir Gawain, youngest of Arthur&#x27;s knights and his nephew, asks for the honour instead. The giant bends and bares his neck before him and Gawain neatly beheads him in one stroke. However, the Green Knight neither falls nor falters, but instead reaches out, picks up his severed head, and mounts his horse. The Green Knight shows his bleeding head to Queen Guinevere, while it reminds Gawain that the two must meet again at the Green Chapel in a year and a day, before the knight rides away. Gawain and Arthur admire the axe, hang it up as a trophy, and encourage Guinevere to treat the whole matter lightly.

As the date approaches, Sir Gawain leaves to find the Green Chapel and keep his part of the bargain. Many adventures and battles are alluded to but not described, until Gawain comes across a splendid castle, where he meets the lord of the castle and his beautiful wife, who are pleased to have such a renowned guest. Also present is an old and ugly lady, unnamed but treated with great honour by all. Gawain tells them of his New Year&#x27;s appointment at the Green Chapel, and that he has only a few days remaining. The lord laughs, explaining that there is a path that will take him to the chapel less than two miles away, and proposes that Gawain rest at the castle until then. Relieved and grateful, Gawain agrees.

The lord proposes a bargain to Gawain: he goes hunting every day, and he will give Gawain whatever he catches, on the condition that Gawain give him whatever he may gain during the day; Gawain accepts. After he leaves, his wife visits Gawain&#x27;s bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts, he allows her nothing but a single kiss. When the lord returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, Gawain gives a kiss to him without divulging its source. The next day the lady returns to Gawain, who again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted boar for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, but once her advances are denied, she offers Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses, but she pleads that he at least take her sash, a girdle of green and gold silk. The sash, the lady assures him, is charmed, and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die the next day, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three kisses. The lady has Gawain swear that he will keep the gift secret from her husband. That evening, the lord returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses; Gawain does not mention the sash.

The next day, Gawain binds the sash around his waist. Outside the Green Chapel – only an earthen mound containing a cavern – he finds the Green Knight sharpening an axe. As promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing, Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain does not flinch with the second swing, but again, the Green Knight withholds the full force of his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain&#x27;s nerve. Angrily, Gawain tells him to deliver his blow, and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain&#x27;s neck, and ending the game. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet, and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be none other than the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the unnamed &quot;elderly lady&quot; Gawain saw at the castle, who is the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur&#x27;s stepsister, who intended to test Arthur&#x27;s knights and frighten Guinevere to death. The nick Gawain suffered at the third stroke was because of his attempt to conceal the gift of the sash. Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully, but the Green Knight laughs and pronounces him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the sash as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The Knights of the Round Table absolve him of the blame and decide that henceforth each will wear a green sash in recognition of Gawain&#x27;s adventure and as a reminder to be honest.

==&quot;Gawain Poet&quot;==
Though the real name of the &quot;&quot;Gawain&quot; Poet&quot; (or poets) is unknown, some inferences about them can be drawn from an informed reading of their works. The manuscript of &quot;Gawain&quot; is known in academic circles as Cotton Nero A.x., following a naming system used by one of its owners, the 16th-century Sir Robert Bruce Cotton, a collector of medieval English texts. Before the &quot;Gawain&quot; manuscript came into Cotton&#x27;s possession, it was in the library of Henry Savile in Yorkshire. Little is known about its previous ownership, and until 1824, when the manuscript was introduced to the academic community in a second edition of Thomas Warton&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;, edited by Richard Price, it was almost entirely unknown. Even then, the &quot;Gawain&quot; poem was not published in its entirety until 1839, which is when it was given its present title. Now held in the British Library, it has been dated to the late 14th century, meaning the poet was a contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer, author of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, though it is unlikely that they ever met, and the Gawain poet&#x27;s English is considerably different from Chaucer&#x27;s. The three other works found in the same manuscript as &quot;Gawain&quot; (commonly known as &quot;Pearl&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot;, and &quot;Cleanness&quot; or &quot;Purity&quot;) are often considered to be written by the same author. However, the manuscript containing these poems was transcribed by a copyist and not by the original poet. Although nothing explicitly suggests that all four poems are by the same poet, comparative analysis of dialect, verse form, and diction have pointed towards single authorship.

What is known today about the poet is general. J. R. R. Tolkien and E.V. Gordon, after reviewing the text&#x27;s allusions, style, and themes, concluded in 1925:


The most commonly suggested candidate for authorship is John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire. He is known to have lived in the dialect region of the Gawain Poet and is thought to have written the poem &quot;St. Erkenwald&quot;, which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to &quot;Gawain&quot;. &quot;St. Erkenwald&quot;, however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain Poet&#x27;s era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial, and most critics consider the Gawain Poet an unknown.

==Verse form==
The 2,530 lines and 101 stanzas that make up &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; are written in what linguists call the &quot;Alliterative Revival&quot; style of alliterative verse typical of the 14th century. Instead of focusing on a metrical syllabic count and rhyme, the alliterative form of this period usually relied on the agreement of a pair of stressed syllables at the beginning of the line and another pair at the end. Each line always includes a pause, called a &quot;caesura&quot;, at some point after the first two stresses, dividing it into two half-lines. Although he follows the form of his day, the Gawain Poet was freer with convention than his or her predecessors. The poet broke the alliterative lines into variable-length groups and ended these nominal stanzas with a rhyming section of five lines known as the &quot;bob and wheel&quot;, in which the &quot;bob&quot; is a very short line, sometimes of only two syllables, followed by the &quot;wheel,&quot; longer lines with internal rhyme.

==Similar stories==

The earliest known story to feature a beheading game is the 8th-century Middle Irish tale &quot;Bricriu&#x27;s Feast&quot;. This story parallels &quot;Gawain&quot; in that, like the Green Knight, Cú Chulainn&#x27;s antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A beheading exchange also appears in the late 12th-century &quot;Life of Caradoc&quot;, a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;. A notable difference in this story is that Caradoc&#x27;s challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. Lancelot is given a beheading challenge in the early 13th-century &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing to come to the same place in a year to put his head in the same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight, because many others had failed this test of chivalry.

The stories &quot;The Girl with the Mule&quot; (alternately titled &quot;The Mule Without a Bridle&quot;) and &quot;&quot; feature Gawain in beheading game situations. In &quot;Hunbaut,&quot; Gawain cuts off a man&#x27;s head and, before he can replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle to stave off the advances of women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include &quot;Yder&quot;, the Lancelot-Grail, &quot;Hunbaut&quot;, and &quot;The Knight with the Sword&quot;. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually, the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested to see whether or not he will remain chaste in trying circumstances.

In the first branch of the medieval Welsh collection of tales known as The Four Branches of the Mabinogi, Pwyll exchanges places for a year with Arawn, the lord of Annwn (the Otherworld). Despite having his appearance changed to resemble Arawn exactly, Pwyll does not have sexual relations with Arawn&#x27;s wife during this time, thus establishing a lasting friendship between the two men. This story may, then, provide a background to Gawain&#x27;s attempts to resist the wife of the Green Knight; thus, the story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight may be seen as a tale which combines elements of the Celtic beheading game and seduction test stories. Additionally, in both stories a year passes before the completion of the conclusion of the challenge or exchange. Some scholars disagree with this interpretation, however, as Arawn seems to have accepted the notion that Pwyll may reciprocate with his wife, making it less of a &quot;seduction test&quot; per se, as seduction tests typically involve a Lord and Lady conspiring to seduce a knight, seemingly &quot;against&quot; the wishes of the Lord.

After the writing of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, several similar stories followed. &quot;The Greene Knight&quot; (15th–17th century) is a rhymed retelling of nearly the same tale. In it, the plot is simplified, motives are more fully explained, and some names are changed. Another story, &quot;The Turke and Gowin&quot; (15th century), begins with a Turk entering Arthur&#x27;s court and asking, &quot;Is there any will, as a brother, To give a buffett and take another?&quot; At the end of this poem the Turk, rather than buffeting Gawain back, asks the knight to cut off his head, which Gawain does. The Turk then praises Gawain and showers him with gifts. &quot;The Carle of Carlisle&quot; (17th century) also resembles &quot;Gawain&quot; in a scene in which the Carle (Churl), a lord, takes Sir Gawain to a chamber where two swords are hanging and orders Gawain to cut off his head or suffer his own to be cut off. Gawain obliges and strikes, but the Carle rises, laughing and unharmed. Unlike the &quot;Gawain&quot; poem, no return blow is demanded or given.

==Themes==

=== Temptation and testing ===

At the heart of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; is the test of Gawain&#x27;s adherence to the code of chivalry. The typical temptation fable of medieval literature presents a series of tribulations assembled as tests or &quot;proofs&quot; of moral virtue. The stories often describe several individuals&#x27; failures after which the main character is tested. Success in the proofs will often bring immunity or good fortune. Gawain&#x27;s ability to pass the tests of his host are of utmost importance to his survival, though he does not know it. It is only by fortuity or &quot;instinctive-courtesy&quot; that Sir Gawain can pass his test. Gawain does not realise, however, that these tests are all orchestrated by the lord, Bertilak de Hautdesert.
In addition to the laws of chivalry, Gawain must respect another set of laws concerning courtly love. The knight&#x27;s code of honour requires him to do whatever a asks. Gawain must accept the girdle from the Lady, but he must also keep the promise he has made to his host that he will give whatever he gains that day. Gawain chooses to keep the girdle out of fear of death, thus breaking his promise to the host but honouring the lady. Upon learning that the Green Knight is actually his host (Bertilak), he realises that although he has completed his quest, he has failed to be virtuous. This test demonstrates the conflict between honour and knightly duties. In breaking his promise, Gawain believes he has lost his honour and failed in his duties.

===Hunting and seduction===
Scholars have frequently noted the parallels between the three hunting scenes and the three seduction scenes in &quot;Gawain&quot;. They are generally agreed that the fox chase has significant parallels to the third seduction scene, in which Gawain accepts the girdle from Bertilak&#x27;s wife. Gawain, like the fox, fears for his life and is looking for a way to avoid death from the Green Knight&#x27;s axe. Like his counterpart, he resorts to trickery to save his skin. The fox uses tactics so unlike the first two animals, and so unexpectedly, that Bertilak has the hardest time hunting it. Similarly, Gawain finds the Lady&#x27;s advances in the third seduction scene more unpredictable and challenging to resist than her previous attempts. She changes her evasive language, typical of courtly love relationships, to a more assertive style. Her dress, modest in earlier scenes, is suddenly voluptuous and revealing.

The deer- and boar-hunting scenes are less clearly connected, although scholars have attempted to link each animal to Gawain&#x27;s reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect the deer hunt with the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. Deer hunts of the time, like courtship, had to be done according to established rules. Women often favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned. The sequence describing the deer hunt is unspecific and nonviolent, with an air of relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a similar vein, with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire exchange is humorously portrayed.

The boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, laden with detail. Boars were (and are) much more difficult to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak with his back to the ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak&#x27;s wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely, she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.
Masculinity has also been associated with hunting. The theme of masculinity is present throughout. In an article by Vern L. Bullough, &quot;Being a Male in the Middle Ages,&quot; he discusses Sir Gawain and how normally, masculinity is often viewed in terms of being sexually active. He notes that Sir Gawain is not part of this normalcy.

===Nature and chivalry===
Some argue that nature represents a chaotic, lawless order which is in direct confrontation with the civilisation of Camelot throughout &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. The green horse and rider that first invade Arthur&#x27;s peaceful halls are iconic representations of nature&#x27;s disturbance. Nature is presented throughout the poem as rough and indifferent, constantly threatening the order of men and courtly life. Nature invades and disrupts order in the major events of the narrative, both symbolically and through the inner nature of humanity. This element appears first with the disruption caused by the Green Knight, later when Gawain must fight off his natural lust for Bertilak&#x27;s wife, and again when Gawain breaks his vow to Bertilak by choosing to keep the green girdle, valuing survival over virtue. Represented by the sin-stained girdle, nature is an underlying force, forever within man and keeping him imperfect (in a chivalric sense). In this view, Gawain is part of a wider conflict between nature and chivalry, an examination of the ability of man&#x27;s order to overcome the chaos of nature.

Several critics have made exactly the opposite interpretation, reading the poem as a comic critique of the Christianity of the time, particularly as embodied in the Christian chivalry of Arthur&#x27;s court. In its zeal to extirpate all traces of paganism, Christianity had cut itself off from the sources of life in nature and the female. The green girdle represents all the pentangle lacks. The Arthurian enterprise is doomed unless it can acknowledge the unattainability of the ideals of the Round Table, and, for the sake of realism and wholeness, recognise and incorporate the pagan values represented by the Green Knight.

The chivalry that is represented within &quot;Gawain&quot; is one which was constructed by court nobility. The violence that is part of this chivalry is steeply contrasted by the fact that King Arthur&#x27;s court is Christian, and the initial beheading event takes place while celebrating Christmas. The violence of an act of beheading seems to be counterintuitive to chivalric and Christian ideals, and yet it is seen as part of knighthood.

The question of politeness and chivalry is a main theme during Gawain&#x27;s interactions with Bertilak&#x27;s wife. He cannot accept her advances or else lose his honour, and yet he cannot utterly refuse her advances or else risk upsetting his hostess. Gawain plays a very fine line and the only part where he appears to fail is when he conceals the green girdle from Bertilak.

===Games===
The word (game) is found 18 times in &quot;Gawain&quot;. Its similarity to the word (man), which appears 21 times, has led some scholars to see men and games as centrally linked. Games at this time were seen as tests of worthiness, as when the Green Knight challenges the court&#x27;s right to its good name in a &quot;Christmas game&quot;. The &quot;game&quot; of exchanging gifts was common in Germanic cultures. If a man received a gift, he was obliged to provide the giver with a better gift or risk losing his honour, almost like an exchange of blows in a fight (or in a &quot;beheading game&quot;). The poem revolves around two games: an exchange of beheading and an exchange of winnings. These appear at first to be unconnected. However, a victory in the first game will lead to a victory in the second. Elements of both games appear in other stories; however, the linkage of outcomes is unique to &quot;Gawain&quot;.

===Times and seasons===
Times, dates, seasons, and cycles within &quot;Gawain&quot; are often noted by scholars because of their symbolic nature. The story starts on New Year&#x27;s Eve with a beheading and culminates one year later on the next New Year&#x27;s Day. Gawain leaves Camelot on All Saints Day and arrives at Bertilak&#x27;s castle on Christmas Eve. Furthermore, the Green Knight tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel in &quot;a year and a day&quot;—in other words, the next New Year&#x27;s Day. Some scholars interpret the yearly cycles, each beginning and ending in winter, as the poet&#x27;s attempt to convey the inevitable fall of all things good and noble in the world. Such a theme is strengthened by the image of Troy, a powerful nation once thought to be invincible which, according to the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, fell to the Greeks because of pride and ignorance. The Trojan connection shows itself in the presence of two nearly identical descriptions of Troy&#x27;s destruction. The poem&#x27;s first line reads: &quot;Since the siege and the assault were ceased at Troy&quot; and the final stanzaic line (before the bob and wheel) is &quot;After the siege and the assault were ceased at Troy&quot;.

==Symbolism==

===The Green Knight===

Scholars have puzzled over the Green Knight&#x27;s symbolism since the discovery of the poem. British medievalist C. S. Lewis said the character was &quot;as vivid and concrete as any image in literature&quot; and scholar J. A. Burrow said he was the &quot;most difficult character&quot; to interpret in &quot;Sir Gawain&quot;. His major role in Arthurian literature is that of a judge and tester of knights, thus he is at once terrifying, friendly, and mysterious. He appears in only two other poems: &quot;The Greene Knight&quot; and &quot;King Arthur and King Cornwall&quot;. Scholars have attempted to connect him to other mythical characters, such as Jack in the green of English tradition and to Al-Khidr, but no definitive connection has yet been established.

He represents a mix of two traditional figures in romance and other medieval narratives: &quot;the literary green man&quot; and &quot;the literary wild man.&quot; The Green Knight challenges Gawain to rise to the ideals of honour and religious practices. His name, the Green Knight, shows his opposition to nature: the colour green represents forces of nature, and the word &quot;knight&quot; connects him to society and civilisation. While the Green Knight represents the primitive, and uncivilised side of man&#x27;s nature, he also opposes nature as well. The description of the Green Knight, which he shares with his green horse, shows the central idea of human nature&#x27;s potential.

=== The colour green ===

Given the varied and even contradictory interpretations of the colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous. In English folklore and literature, green was traditionally used to symbolise nature and its associated attributes: fertility and rebirth. Stories of the medieval period also used it to allude to love and the base desires of man. Because of its connection with faeries and spirits in early English folklore, green also signified witchcraft, devilry and evil. It can also represent decay and toxicity. When combined with gold, as with the Green Knight and the girdle, green was often seen as representing youth&#x27;s passing. In Celtic mythology, green was associated with misfortune and death, and therefore avoided in clothing. The green girdle, originally worn for protection, became a symbol of shame and cowardice; it is finally adopted as a symbol of honour by the knights of Camelot, signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; this displays both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour green.

There is a possibility, as Alice Buchanan has argued, that the colour green is erroneously attributed to the Green Knight because of the poet&#x27;s mistranslation or misunderstanding of the Irish word , which could either mean grey or green, or the identical word in Cornish. has been used to denote a range of colours: light blues, greys, and greens of the sea and grass.

In the Death of Curoi (one of the Irish stories from &quot;Bricriu&#x27;s Feast&quot;), Curoi stands in for Bertilak, and is often called &quot;the man of the grey mantle&quot; which corresponds to Welsh Brenin Llwyd or Gwynn ap Nudd. Though the words usually used for grey in the Death of Curoi are or , roughly meaning milk-coloured and shadowy respectively, in later works featuring a green knight, the word is used and may have been the basis of misunderstanding.

===Girdle===

The girdle&#x27;s symbolic meaning, in &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, has been construed in a variety of ways. Interpretations range from sexual to spiritual. Those who argue for the sexual inference view the girdle as a &quot;trophy&quot;. It is not entirely clear if the &quot;winner&quot; is Sir Gawain or the Lady, Bertilak&#x27;s wife. The girdle is given to Gawain by the Lady to keep him safe when he confronts the Green Knight. When Bertilak comes home from his hunting trip, Gawain does not reveal the girdle to his host; instead, he hides it. This introduces a spiritual interpretation, that Gawain&#x27;s acceptance of the girdle is a sign of his faltering faith in God, at least in the face of death. To some, the Green Knight is Christ, who overcomes death, while Gawain is the Every Christian, who in his struggles to follow Christ faithfully, chooses the easier path. In &quot;Sir Gawain&quot;, the easier choice is the girdle, which promises what Gawain most desires. Faith in God, alternatively, requires one&#x27;s acceptance that what one most desires does not always coincide with what God has planned. It is arguably best to view the girdle not as an either–or situation, but as a complex, multi-faceted symbol that acts to test Gawain in many ways. While Gawain can resist Bertilak&#x27;s wife&#x27;s sexual advances, he is unable to resist the powers of the girdle. Gawain is operating under the laws of chivalry which, evidently, have rules that can contradict each other. In the story of Sir Gawain, Gawain finds himself torn between doing what a damsel asks (accepting the girdle) and keeping his promise (returning anything given to him while his host is away). 
===Pentangle=== 
The poem contains the first recorded use of the word &quot;pentangle&quot; in English. It contains the only representation of such a symbol on Gawain&#x27;s shield in the Gawain literature. What is more, the poet uses a total of 46 lines to describe the meaning of the pentangle; no other symbol in the poem receives as much attention or is described in such detail. The poem describes the pentangle as a symbol of faithfulness and an (endless knot). From lines 640 to 654, the five points of the pentangle relate directly to Gawain in five ways: five senses, his five fingers, his faith found in the five wounds of Christ, the five joys of Mary (whose face was on the inside of the shield) and finally friendship, fraternity, purity, politeness, and pity (traits that Gawain possessed around others). In line 625, it is described as (a sign set by Solomon). Solomon, the third king of Israel, in the 10th century BC, was said to have the mark of the pentagram on his ring, which he received from the archangel Michael. The pentagram seal on this ring was said to give Solomon power over demons.

Along these lines, some academics link the Gawain pentangle to magical traditions. In Germany, the symbol was called a (nightmare spirit&#x27;s foot) and was placed on household objects to keep out evil. The symbol was also associated with magical charms that, if recited or written on a weapon, would call forth magical forces. However, concrete evidence tying the magical pentagram to Gawain&#x27;s pentangle is scarce.

Gawain&#x27;s pentangle also symbolises the &quot;phenomenon of physically endless objects signifying a temporally endless quality.&quot; Many poets use the symbol of the circle to show infinity or endlessness, but Gawain&#x27;s poet insisted on using something more complex. In medieval number theory, the number five is considered a &quot;circular number&quot;, since it &quot;reproduces itself in its last digit when raised to its powers&quot;. Furthermore, it replicates itself geometrically; that is, every pentangle has a smaller pentagon that allows a pentangle to be embedded in it and this &quot;process may be repeated forever with decreasing pentangles&quot;. Thus, by reproducing the number five, which in medieval number symbolism signified incorruptibility, Gawain&#x27;s pentangle represents his eternal incorruptibility.

===The Lady&#x27;s ring===
Gawain&#x27;s refusal of the Lady&#x27;s ring has major implications for the remainder of the story. While the modern student may tend to pay more attention to the girdle as the eminent object offered by her, readers in the time of Gawain would have noticed the significance of the offer of the ring as they believed that rings, and especially the embedded gems, had talismanic properties similarly done by the Gawain-poet in &quot;Pearl&quot;. This is especially true of the Lady&#x27;s ring, as scholars believe it to be a ruby or carbuncle, indicated when the Gawain-Poet describes it as a (fiery sun). This red colour can be seen as symbolising royalty, divinity, and the Passion of the Christ, something that Gawain as a knight of the Round Table would strive for, but this colour could also represent the negative qualities of temptation and covetousness. Given the importance of magic rings in Arthurian romance, this remarkable ring would also have been believed to protect the wearer from harm just as the Lady claims the girdle will.

===Numbers===
The poet highlights number symbolism to add symmetry and meaning to the poem. For example, three kisses are exchanged between Gawain and Bertilak&#x27;s wife; Gawain is tempted by her on three separate days; Bertilak goes hunting three times, and the Green Knight swings at Gawain three times with his axe. The number two also appears repeatedly, as in the two beheading scenes, two confession scenes, and two castles. The five points of the pentangle, the poet adds, represent Gawain&#x27;s virtues, for he is (faithful in five and many times five). The poet goes on to list the ways in which Gawain is virtuous: all five of his senses are without fault; his five fingers never fail him, and he always remembers the five wounds of Christ, as well as the five joys of the Virgin Mary. The fifth five is Gawain himself, who embodies the five moral virtues of the code of chivalry: &quot;friendship, generosity, chastity, courtesy, and piety&quot;. All of these virtues reside, as the poet says, in (the endless knot) of the pentangle, which forever interlinks and is never broken. This intimate relationship between symbol and faith allows for rigorous allegorical interpretation, especially in the physical role that the shield plays in Gawain&#x27;s quest. Thus, the poet makes Gawain the epitome of perfection in knighthood through number symbolism.
The number five is also found in the structure of the poem itself. &quot;Sir Gawain&quot; is 101 stanzas long, traditionally organised into four &#x27;fitts&#x27; of 21, 24, 34, and 22 stanzas. These divisions, however, have since been disputed; scholars have begun to believe that they are the work of the copyist and not of the poet. The surviving manuscript features a series of capital letters added after the fact by another scribe, and some scholars argue that these additions were an attempt to restore the original divisions. These letters divide the manuscript into nine parts. The first and last parts are 22 stanzas long. The second and second-to-last parts are only one stanza long, and the middle five parts are eleven stanzas long. The number eleven is associated with transgression in other medieval literature (being one more than ten, a number associated with the Ten Commandments). Thus, this set of five elevens (55 stanzas) creates the perfect mix of transgression and incorruption, suggesting that Gawain is faultless in his faults.

===Wounds===
At the story&#x27;s climax, Gawain is wounded superficially in the neck by the Green Knight&#x27;s axe. During the medieval period, the body and the soul were believed to be so intimately connected that wounds were considered an outward sign of inward sin. The neck, specifically, was believed to correlate with the part of the soul related to will, connecting the reasoning part (the head) and the courageous part (the heart). Gawain&#x27;s sin resulted from using his will to separate reasoning from courage. By accepting the girdle from the lady, he employs reason to do something less than courageous—evade death in a dishonest way. Gawain&#x27;s wound is thus an outward sign of an internal wound. The Green Knight&#x27;s series of tests shows Gawain the weakness that has been in him all along: the desire to use his will pridefully for personal gain, rather than submitting his will in humility to God. The Green Knight, by engaging with the greatest knight of Camelot, also reveals the moral weakness of pride in all of Camelot, and therefore all of humanity. However, the wounds of Christ, believed to offer healing to wounded souls and bodies, are mentioned throughout the poem in the hope that this sin of prideful &quot;stiffneckedness&quot; will be healed among fallen mortals.

==Interpretations==

=== &quot;Gawain&quot; as medieval romance ===
Many critics argue that &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; should be viewed as a romance. Medieval romances typically recount the marvellous adventures of a chivalrous, heroic knight, often of super-human ability, who abides by chivalry&#x27;s strict codes of honour and demeanour, embarks upon a quest and defeats monsters, thereby winning the favour of a lady. Thus, medieval romances focus not on love and sentiment (as the term &quot;romance&quot; implies today), but on adventure.

Gawain&#x27;s function, as medieval scholar Alan Markman says, &quot;is the function of the romance hero … to stand as the champion of the human race, and by submitting to strange and severe tests, to demonstrate human capabilities for good or bad action.&quot; Through Gawain&#x27;s adventure, it becomes clear that he is merely human. The reader becomes attached to this human view amidst the poem&#x27;s romanticism, relating to Gawain&#x27;s humanity while respecting his knightly qualities. Gawain &quot;shows us what moral conduct is. We shall probably not equal his behaviour, but we admire him for pointing out the way.&quot;

In viewing the poem as a medieval romance, many scholars see it as intertwining chivalric and courtly love laws under the English Order of the Garter. A slightly altered version of the Order&#x27;s motto, &quot;Honi soit qui mal y pense&quot;, or &quot;Shamed be he who finds evil here,&quot; has been added, in a different hand, at the end of the poem. Some critics describe Gawain&#x27;s peers wearing girdles of their own as linked to the origin of the Order of the Garter. However, in the parallel poem &quot;The Greene Knight&quot;, the lace is white, not green, and is considered the origin of the collar worn by the Knights of the Bath, not the Order of the Garter. Still, a possible connection to the Order is not beyond the realm of possibility.

===Christian interpretations===
The poem is in many ways deeply Christian, with frequent references to the fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by looking at it in the context of the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare &quot;Sir Gawain&quot; to the other three poems of the &quot;Gawain&quot; manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret &quot;Gawain&quot; similarly. Comparing it to the poem &quot;Cleanness&quot; (also known as &quot;Purity&quot;), for example, they see it as a story of the apocalyptic fall of a civilisation, in &quot;Gawain&#x27;s&quot; case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like Noah, separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God&#x27;s representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain&#x27;s experience and wear garters themselves. In &quot;Cleanness&quot; the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.

One of the key points stressed in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. &quot;Gawain&quot; was written around the time of the Black Death and Peasants&#x27; Revolt, events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture. However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, often viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight&#x27;s presence as a representative of God problematic.

While the character of the Green Knight is usually not viewed as a representation of Christ in &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, critics do acknowledge a parallel. Lawrence Besserman, a specialist in medieval literature, explains that &quot;the Green Knight is not a figurative representative of Christ. But the idea of Christ&#x27;s divine/human nature provides a medieval conceptual framework that supports the poet&#x27;s serious/comic account of the Green Knight&#x27;s supernatural/human qualities and actions.&quot; This duality exemplifies the influence and importance of Christian teachings and views of Christ in the era of the Gawain Poet.

Furthermore, critics note the Christian reference to Christ&#x27;s crown of thorns at the conclusion of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. After Gawain returns to Camelot and tells his story regarding the newly acquired green sash, the poem concludes with a brief prayer and a reference to &quot;the thorn-crowned God&quot;. Besserman theorises that &quot;with these final words the poet redirects our attention from the circular girdle-turned-sash (a double image of Gawain&#x27;s &quot;&quot;: untruth/renown) to the circular Crown of Thorns (a double image of Christ&#x27;s humiliation turned triumph).&quot;

Throughout the poem, Gawain encounters numerous trials testing his devotion and faith in Christianity. When Gawain sets out on his journey to find the Green Chapel, he finds himself lost, and only after praying to the Virgin Mary does he find his way. As he continues his journey, Gawain once again faces anguish regarding his inevitable encounter with the Green Knight. Instead of praying to Mary, as before, Gawain places his faith in the girdle given to him by Bertilak&#x27;s wife. From the Christian perspective, this leads to disastrous and embarrassing consequences for Gawain as he is forced to re-evaluate his faith when the Green Knight points out his betrayal. Another interpretation sees the work in terms of the perfection of virtue, with the pentangle representing the moral perfection of the connected virtues, the Green Knight as Christ exhibiting perfect fortitude, and Gawain as slightly imperfect in fortitude by virtue of flinching when under the threat of death.

An analogy is also made between Gawain&#x27;s trial and the Biblical test that Adam encounters in the Garden of Eden. Adam succumbs to Eve just as Gawain surrenders to Bertilak&#x27;s wife by accepting the girdle. Although Gawain sins by putting his faith in the girdle and not confessing when he is caught, the Green Knight pardons him, thereby allowing him to become a better Christian by learning from his mistakes. Through the various games played and hardships endured, Gawain finds his place within the Christian world.

===Feminist interpretations===

Feminist literary critics see the poem as portraying women&#x27;s ultimate power over men. Morgan le Fay and Bertilak&#x27;s wife, for example, are the most powerful characters in the poem—Morgan especially, as she begins the game by enchanting the Green Knight. The girdle and Gawain&#x27;s scar can be seen as symbols of feminine power, each of them diminishing Gawain&#x27;s masculinity. Gawain&#x27;s misogynist passage, in which he blames all his troubles on women and lists the many men who have fallen prey to women&#x27;s wiles, further supports the feminist view of ultimate female power in the poem.

In contrast, others argue that the poem focuses mostly on the opinions, actions, and abilities of men. For example, on the surface, it appears that Bertilak&#x27;s wife is a strong leading character. By adopting the masculine role, she appears to be an empowered individual, particularly in the bedroom scene. This is not entirely the case, however. While the Lady is being forward and outgoing, Gawain&#x27;s feelings and emotions are the focus of the story, and Gawain stands to gain or lose the most. The Lady &quot;makes the first move&quot;, so to speak, but Gawain decides what is to become of those actions. He, therefore, is in charge of the situation and even the relationship.

In the bedroom scene, both the negative and positive actions of the Lady are motivated by her desire. Her feelings cause her to step out of the typical female role and into that of the male, thus becoming more empowered. At the same time, those same actions make the Lady appear adulterous; some scholars compare her with Eve in the Bible. By convincing Gawain to take her girdle, i.e., the apple, the pact made with Bertilak—and therefore the Green Knight—is broken. Based on this, Gawain portrays himself, in what is often called his &quot;antifeminist diatribe&quot; later on, as a &quot;good man seduced&quot;.

===Postcolonial interpretations===

From 1350 to 1400—the period in which the poem is thought to have been written— there were several Welsh rebellions against English rule, including one by Owain Lawgoch in 1372 and another by Owain Glyndŵr in 1400. The Gawain poet uses a North West Midlands dialect common in the England–Wales border, potentially placing him in the midst of such conflicts. Patricia Clare Ingham is credited with first viewing the poem through the lens of postcolonialism, and since then a great deal of dispute has emerged over the extent to which colonial differences between the English and Welsh play a role in the poem. Most critics agree that gender plays a role but differ about whether it supports the poem&#x27;s colonial ideals or supplants them as the English and Welsh cultures interact in the poem.

A large amount of critical debate also surrounds the poem as it relates to the bi-cultural political landscape of the time. Some argue that Bertilak is an example of the hybrid Anglo-Welsh culture found on the England–Wales border. They therefore view the poem as a reflection of a hybrid culture that played the two cultures off one another to create a new set of cultural rules and traditions. Other scholars, however, argue that historically there was much violence between the Welsh and English into the 15th century, creating a situation far removed from the more friendly hybridisation suggested by Ingham. To support this argument further, it is suggested that the poem creates an &quot;us versus them&quot; scenario contrasting the knowledgeable and civilised English with the uncivilised borderlands home to Bertilak and the other monsters that Gawain encounters.

In contrast to such postcolonial analyses, others argue that the land of Hautdesert, Bertilak&#x27;s territory, has been misrepresented or ignored in modern criticism. They suggest that it is a land with its own moral agency, one that plays a central role in the story. Bonnie Lander, for example, argues that the denizens of Hautdesert are &quot;intelligently immoral&quot;, choosing to follow certain codes and rejecting others, a position which creates a &quot;distinction … of moral insight versus moral faith&quot;. Lander thinks that the border dwellers are more sophisticated because they do not unthinkingly embrace the chivalric codes but challenge them in a philosophical, and—in the case of Bertilak&#x27;s appearance at Arthur&#x27;s court—literal sense. Lander&#x27;s argument about the superiority of the denizens of Hautdesert hinges on the lack of self-awareness present in Camelot, which leads to an unthinking populace that frowns on individualism. In this view, it is not Bertilak and his people, but Arthur and his court, who are the monsters.

===Gawain&#x27;s journey===
Several scholars have attempted to find a real-world correspondence for Gawain&#x27;s journey to the Green Chapel. The Anglesey islands, for example, are mentioned in the poem. They exist today as a single island off the coast of Wales. In line 700, Gawain is said to pass the (Holy Head), believed by many scholars to be either Holywell or the Cistercian abbey of Poulton in Pulford. Holywell is associated with the beheading of Saint Winifred. As the story goes, Winifred was a virgin who was beheaded by a local leader after she refused his sexual advances. Her uncle, another saint, put her head back in place and healed the wound, leaving only a white scar. The parallels between this story and Gawain&#x27;s make this area a likely candidate for the journey.

Gawain&#x27;s trek leads him directly into the centre of the Pearl Poet&#x27;s dialect region, where the candidates for the locations of the Castle at Hautdesert and the Green Chapel stand. Hautdesert is thought to be in the area of Swythamley in northwest Midland, as it lies in the writer&#x27;s dialect area and matches the topographical features described in the poem. The area is also known to have housed all of the animals hunted by Bertilak (deer, boar, fox) in the 14th century. The Green Chapel is thought to be in either Lud&#x27;s Church or Wetton Mill, as these areas closely match the descriptions given by the author. Ralph Elliott located the chapel (two miles hence) from the old manor house at Swythamley Park at (the bottom of a valley) on a hillside (&quot;loke a littel on þe launde on þi lyfte honde&quot;) in an enormous fissure (). Several have tried to replicate this expedition and others such as Michael W. Twomey have created a virtual tour of Gawain&#x27;s journey entitled &#x27;Travels with Sir Gawain&#x27; that include photographs of landscapes mentioned and particular views mentioned in the text.

===Homoerotic interpretations===
According to Queer scholar Richard Zeikowitz, the Green Knight represents a threat to homosocial friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight&#x27;s beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight&#x27;s attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur&#x27;s court and poses a threat to their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain&#x27;s embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed, and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, Zeikowitz claims the Green Knight blurs the lines between male homosociality and homosexuality, presumed knowledge of premodern artistic portrayals of female homosociality and homosexuality being largely doubtful, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.

Queer scholar Carolyn Dinshaw argues that the poem may have been a response to accusations that Richard II had a male lover—an attempt to re-establish the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures were trying to make the distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. She asserts that the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. According to Dinshaw, in his other poem &quot;Cleanness&quot;, he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail, and she sees this alleged &#x27;obsession&#x27; as carrying over to &quot;Gawain&quot; in his descriptions of the Green Knight.

Beyond this, Dinshaw proposes that Gawain can be read as a woman-like figure. In her view, he is the passive one in the advances of Bertilak&#x27;s wife, as well as in his encounters with Bertilak himself, where he acts the part of a woman in kissing the man. However, while the poem does have homosexual elements, these elements are brought up by the poet to establish heterosexuality as the normal lifestyle of Gawain&#x27;s world. The poem does this by making the kisses between the Lady and Gawain sexual in nature but rendering the kisses between Gawain and Bertilak &quot;unintelligible&quot; to the medieval reader. In other words, the poet portrays kisses between a man and a woman as having the possibility of leading to sex, while in a heterosexual world, kisses between a man and a man are portrayed as having no such possibility.

==Modern adaptations==

=== Books ===
Though the surviving manuscript dates from the fourteenth century, the first published version of the poem did not appear until as late as 1839, when Sir Frederic Madden of the British Museum recognised the poem as worth reading. Madden&#x27;s scholarly, Middle English edition of the poem was followed in 1898 by the first Modern English translation – a prose version by literary scholar Jessie Weston. In 1925, J. R. R. Tolkien and E. V. Gordon published a scholarly edition of the Middle English text of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;; a revised edition of this text was prepared by Norman Davis and published in 1967. The book, featuring a text in Middle English with extensive scholarly notes, is frequently confused with the translation into Modern English that Tolkien prepared, along with translations of &quot;Pearl&quot; and &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot;, late in his life. Many editions of the latter work, first published in 1975, shortly after his death, list Tolkien on the cover as author rather than translator.

Many translations into Modern English are available. Notable translators include Jessie Weston, whose 1898 prose translation and 1907 poetic translation took many liberties with the original; Theodore Banks, whose 1929 translation was praised for its adaptation of the language to modern usage; and Marie Borroff, whose imitative translation was first published in 1967 and &quot;entered the academic canon&quot; in 1968, in the second edition of the &quot;Norton Anthology of English Literature&quot;. In 2010, her (slightly revised) translation was published as a Norton Critical Edition, with a foreword by Laura Howes. In 2007, Simon Armitage, who grew up near the Gawain poet&#x27;s purported residence, published a translation which attracted attention in the US and the United Kingdom, and was published in the United States by Norton.

=== Art ===
Many 20th and 21st-century editions of the poem are, like the manuscript, illustrated. For centuries the poem&#x27;s titular characters were not the subject of artists&#x27; interest, not even for the Pre-Raphaelites, though the poem was the inspiration for Christina Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;The Prince’s Progress&quot; (1866). This changed in the beginning of the 20th century, with five images by Frederic Lawrence (in an Arts and Crafts style) for a 1912 edition. Herbert Cole illustrated Ernest Rhys and Grace Rhys&#x27;s &quot;English Fairy Tales&quot; (1913), and included an image of the Green Knight entering King Arthur&#x27;s court, the same scene Diana Sudyka represented for the cover of Simon Armitage&#x27;s 2008 edition of his translation, published by the London Folio Society. British artist and designer Dorothea Braby produced six color engravings for Gwyn Jones&#x27;s 1952 translation; critic Muriel Whitaker noted that Braby&#x27;s color scheme points to symbolic dualities, &quot;warmth and coldness, natural and supernatural, courtliness and barbarity, sensuous castle life and rigorous forest hunts&quot;. John Howe, known for his work for J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, created a landscape featuring Gawain and the Green Knight for the jacket cover of Tolkien&#x27;s translation in HarperCollins&#x27; 1996 publication of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot;. Commenting on Howe&#x27;s image, John Gentile notes a connection to the wild man trope, emphasizing the Green Knight&#x27;s &quot;beard and long hair as well as his holly cluster all show[ing] some connection to the image of the medieval Wild Man&quot;. The artist Clive Hicks-Jenkins produced fourteen screenprints for a 2018 special edition of Armitage&#x27;s translation; these images where also exhibited in 2018 at MOMA Machynlleth art gallery in Wales. Michael Eden comments that, while varied and nuanced, at least five of these images &quot;show a key shift from romance and fairytale-like imagery to a horror aesthetic&quot;.

===Film and television===
The poem has been adapted to film three times, twice by writer-director Stephen Weeks: first as &quot;Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; 1973 which features Nigel Green in his final theatrical film as the Green Knight and Murray Head as Gawain, and again in 1984 as &quot;Sword of the Valiant: The Legend of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, featuring Miles O&#x27;Keeffe as Gawain and Sean Connery as the Green Knight. Both films have been criticised for deviating from the poem&#x27;s plot, described by critic Mark Kermode as &quot;cod antics&quot;. Also, Bertilak and the Green Knight are never connected. On 30 July 2021, &quot;The Green Knight&quot; was released, directed by American filmmaker David Lowery for A24 and starring Dev Patel as Gawain and Ralph Ineson as the Green Knight, albeit with some significant deviations from the original story.

There have been at least two television adaptations, J.M. Phillips’s, Gawain and the Green Knight in 1991, adapted by David Rudkin (responsible for folk-horror classic Penda’s Fen) was a T.V play made by Thames Television, and the animated &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; in 2002. The BBC broadcast a documentary presented by Simon Armitage in which the journey depicted in the poem is traced, using what are believed to be the actual locations. A partial adaptation appears in the &quot;Adventure Time&quot; episode &quot;Seventeen,&quot; which breaks from the original story after the main character, Finn, decapitates the Green Knight.

===Theatre===
The Tyneside Theatre company presented a stage version of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; at the University Theatre, Newcastle at Christmas 1971. It was directed by Michael Bogdanov and adapted for the stage from the translation by Brian Stone.

In 1992 Simon Corble created an adaptation with medieval songs and music for The Midsommer Actors&#x27; Company. Corble later wrote a substantially revised version which was produced indoors at the O&#x27;Reilly Theatre, Oxford in February 2014.

===Opera===
&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; was first adapted as an opera in 1978 by the composer Richard Blackford on commission from the village of Blewbury, Oxfordshire. The libretto was written for the adaptation by the children&#x27;s novelist John Emlyn Edwards. The &quot;Opera in Six Scenes&quot; was subsequently recorded by Decca between March and June 1979 and released on the Argo label in November 1979.

&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; was adapted into an opera called &quot;Gawain&quot; by Harrison Birtwistle, first performed in 1991. Birtwistle&#x27;s opera was praised for maintaining the complexity of the poem while translating it into lyric, musical form. Another operatic adaptation is Lynne Plowman&#x27;s &quot;Gwyneth and the Green Knight&quot;, first performed in 2002. This opera uses &quot;Sir Gawain&quot; as the backdrop but refocuses the story on Gawain&#x27;s female squire, Gwyneth, who is trying to become a knight. Plowman&#x27;s version was praised for its approachability, as its target is the family audience and young children, but criticised for its use of modern language and occasional preachy nature.

<text>Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood (; b. 1940;, ) is a Pakistani nuclear engineer and a scholar of Islamic studies. He has been living in anonymity in Islamabad, authoring books on the relationship between Islam and science.

Having spent a distinguished career in the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), he founded the Ummah Tameer-e-Nau (UTN) in 1999 – a right-wing organisation that was banned and sanctioned by the United States in 2001. Mahmood was among those who were listed and sanctioned by the Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee in December 2001. He was also sanctioned as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the United States&#x27; Office of Foreign Assets Control, with an address lisiting of the Al-Qaeda Wazir Akbar Khan safe house, Kabul.

==Life and education==

Mahmood was born in Amritsar, Punjab, British India to a Punjabi Muslim family. There are conflicting reports concerning his date of birth; his personal admission noted the birth year as 1940, while the UN reports estimated as 1938. His father, Chaudhry Muhammad Sharif Khan, was a local &quot;zamindar&quot; (lit. feudal lord). His family emigrated from India to Pakistan following religious violence during the partition of India in 1947; the family settled in Lahore, Punjab.

After graduating with distinctions from a local high school standing at top of his class, Mahmood was awarded a scholarship and enrolled at the Government College University to study electrical engineering. After spending a semester, he transferred to the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science with honours in 1960. His credentials led him to join the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) where he gained another scholarship to study in the United Kingdom.

In 1962, Mahmood went to attend the University of Manchester where he studied for a double master&#x27;s degree. First completing a masters&#x27; programme in control systems in 1965, he then received another master&#x27;s degree in nuclear engineering in 1969 from the University of Manchester. While in Manchester, Mahmood was an expert on the Manhattan Project and was reportedly in contact with South African scientists in discussing the jet-nozzle method for uranium enrichment. However, it remains unclear how much interaction was taken place during that time.

== Producing electricity with Djinns ==
While Mahmood wrote many books, many of his claims and researches were notorious such as producing electricity from djinns after capturing them.

== Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission ==

Mahmood joined the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) in 1968, joining the Nuclear Physics Division at the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH) working under Dr. Naeem Ahmad Khan. His collaboration took place with Samar Mubarakmand, Hafeez Qureshi, and he was a vital member of the group before it was discontinued in 1970. Mahmood was one of the foremost experts on civilian reactor technology and was a senior engineer at the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP I)— the first commercial nuclear power plant in Pakistan. He gained notability and publicity in the Pakistan Physics Society for inventing a scientific instrument, the &#x27;SBM probe&#x27;, to detect leaks in steam pipes, a problem that was affecting nuclear plants all over the world and is still used worldwide.

After witnessing the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, which saw the unconditional surrender of Pakistan in 1971, Mahmood attended the winter seminar at Multan and delivered a speech on atomic science. On 20 January 1972, the President of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, approved a crash atomic weapon programme, under Munir Ahmad Khan, for the sake of &quot;national survival.&quot; Nevertheless, Mahmood continued his work at the KANUPP I engineering division.

In the aftermath of &#x27;Smiling Buddha&#x27;, a surprise nuclear test conducted by India in May 1974, Munir Ahmad appointed Mahmood as the director of the enrichment division at PAEC, where the majority of calculations were conducted by Dr. Khalil Qureshi– a physical chemist. Mahmood analysed the gaseous diffusion, gas centrifuge, jet-nozzle and molecular laser isotope separation method for uranium-enrichment; recommending the gas centrifuge method as economical. After submitting the report, Mahmood was asked to depart to the Netherlands to interview Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan on behalf of President Bhutto in 1974. In 1975, his proposal was approved and the work on uranium enrichment started with Mahmood as its director, a move that irked the more qualified but more difficult to manage Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, who had coveted the job for himself. His relations with Dr. Khan remains extremely tense and the pairs disagreed with each other and developed differences at great height. In private meetings with Munir Ahmad, Mahmood often complained and pictured him as &quot;egomaniac&quot;. In 1976, Mahmood was removed from the enrichment division, Project-706, by Abdul Qadeer Khan, and Khan moved the enrichment division at the Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL) under military control.

Eventually, Munir Ahmad removed Mahmood from other classified works and posted him back to the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP-I) with no reason given as a principal engineer. In the 1980s, Munir Ahmad secured Mahmood a job as project manager for the construction of the Khushab Reactor (Khushab-I) where he served as chief engineer and aided with designing the coolant systems. In 1998, he was promoted as a director of the nuclear power division and held that position until 1999.

After the reactor went critical in April 1998, Mahmood said in an interview: &quot;&quot;This reactor (can produce enough plutonium for two to three nuclear weapons per year) Pakistan had &quot;acquired the capability to produce... boosted thermonuclear weapons and hydrogen bombs&quot;.&quot; In 1998, Mahmood was honoured with the Sitara-e-Imtiaz award in a ceremony by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

In 1998, he was promoted as a director of the nuclear power division and held that position until 1999.

==Radical politics and Ummah Tameer-e-Nau==

Though publicly endorsing the 1998 decision to carry out the Chagai-I nuclear tests by Prime Minister Sharif, Mahmood began appearing on news channels as an outspoken opponent of Sharif, as Mahmood vehemently opposed Pakistan becoming a signatory state of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) just like down south neighbour India. In Pakistan&#x27;s popular news channels and newspapers, Mahmood gave numerous interviews, wrote articles, and lobbied against Sharif when learning that the Prime Minister had been willing to sign anti-nuclear weapon treaties, prompting the Pakistan Government to forcefully transfer Mahmood to a non-technical position at PAEC.

Seeking premature retirement from PAEC in 1999, Mahmood moved towards publishing books and articles involving the relationship between Islam and science. Mahmood founded the Ummah Tameer-e-Nau (UTN)– a right-wing organisation– with his close associates. In 2000, he began attending lectures and religious sessions with Dr. Israr Ahmed who would later influence his political views and philosophy. Through UTN, Mahmood stepped into more radical politics, and began visiting Afghanistan where he wanted to be focused on rebuilding educational institutions, hospitals, and relief work.

In August 2001, Mahmood and his colleague Chaudhry Abdul Majeed at the UTN met with Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Describing the meeting, the &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial quoted:&quot;There is little doubt that Mahmood talked to the two al-Qaeda leaders about nuclear weapons, or that Al Qaeda desperately wanted the bomb&quot;.

== 2001 debriefing and detention ==

Since 1999 and 2000 onwards, Pakistan&#x27;s intelligence community had been tracking and monitoring Mahmood whose bushy beard advertised his deep attachment to the Afghan Taliban. After the September 11 attacks in the United States, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) launched a criminal investigation against him, leveling charges of unauthorized travel to Afghanistan. Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, George Tenet, later described intelligence reports of his meeting with Al Qaeda as &quot;&quot;frustratingly vague&quot;.&quot; When asked by Pakistani and American investigators about the nature of Ummah Tameer-e-Nau&#x27;s (UTN) work and discussions, Mahmood said that he had nothing to do with the al-Qaeda and was only working on humanitarian issues like food, health and education. Investigators from Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were astonished and surprised at the extent of his nuclear weapons knowledge.

During his debriefing, his son Dr. Asim Mahmood, a family medicine doctor, told ISI officials that: &quot;My father [Mahmood] did meet with Osama bin Laden and Osama Bin Laden seemed interested in that matter but my father showed no interest in the matter as he met him for food, water and healthcare matters on which his charity was working&quot;.

The FIA criminal probe continued for four months and yielded no concrete results. Pressure from Pakistani society and court inquiries against the FIA&#x27;s criminal probe led to Mahmood&#x27;s release in 2001. His family did confirm his release but had been constantly under surveillance by the FIA; his name was placed on the &quot;Exit Control Lists&quot; so he is not allowed to travel out of Pakistan. Since his release, Mahmood has been out of the public eye and lives a quiet life in Islamabad, devoting most of his time to writing books and doing research work on Islam and science.

Dr. Bashir Syed, former president of the Association of Pakistani Scientists and Engineers of North America (APSENA), said: &quot;I know both of these persons and can tell you there is not an iota of truth that both these respected scientists and friends will do anything to harm the interest of their own country.&quot;

== Mahmood-Hoodbhoy debates ==
Mahmood has written over fifteen books, the most well-known being &quot;The Mechanics of Doomsday and Life After Death&quot;, which is an analysis of the events leading to doomsday in light of scientific theories and Quranic knowledge. However, his scientific arguments and theories have been challenged by some prominent scientists in Pakistan. His religiosity and eccentricity began troubling the Pakistan Physics Society; his peers often quoted him as &quot;a rather strange man&quot;.

In 1988, Mahmood was invited to the University of Islamabad to deliver a lecture on science. During his lecture at the university&#x27;s &#x27;Physics Hall&#x27; he and several other academicians debated his book. While debating, a well known Pakistani nuclear physicist, Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy, and Mahmood, had an acrimonious public debate. Hoodbhoy had severely criticised Mahmood&#x27;s theories and the notion of Islamic science in general, calling it &quot;ludicrous science.&quot; Mahmood protested that Dr. Hoodbhoy misrepresented his views, quoting: &quot;This is crossing all limits of decency,&quot; he wrote. &quot;But should one expect any honesty or decency from anti-Islamic sources?&quot;

=== Literature and Cosmology ===
In his writings and speeches, Mahmood has advocated for nuclear sharing with other Islamic nations which he believed would give rise to Muslim dominance in the world. He has also written a tafseer of the Quran in English.

Mahmood is reported to be fascinated &quot;with the role sunspots played in triggering the French and Russian Revolutions, World War II and assorted anti-colonial uprisings.&quot; According to his book &quot;&quot;Cosmology and Human Destiny&quot;, Mahmood argued that sunspots have influenced major human events, including the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, and World War II. He concluded that governments across the world &quot;are already being subjected to great emotional aggression under the catalytic effect of the abnormally high sunspot activity under which they are most likely to adapt aggression as the natural solution for their problems&quot;. In this book, first published in 1998, he predicted that the period from 2007 to 2014 would be of great turmoil and destruction in the world. Other books written by him include a biography of the Islamic prophet Muhammad titled &quot;First and the Last&quot;, while his other books are focused more on the relation between Islam and science like &quot;Miraculous Quran&quot;, &quot;Life After Death and Doomsday&quot;, and &quot;Kitab-e-Zindagi&quot; (in Urdu).

One passage of the book reportedly states: &quot;At the international level, terrorism will rule; and in this scenario use of mass destruction weapons cannot be ruled out. Millions, by 2020, may die through mass destruction weapons, hunger, disease, street violence, terrorist attacks, and suicide.&quot;&quot;

Mahmood&#x27;s lifelong friend, Member of Parliament Farhatullah Babar, who is currently serving as a spokesperson for the President of Pakistan, while talking to media, said: &quot;Mahmood predicted in &quot;Cosmology and Human Destiny&quot; that &quot;the year 2002 was likely to be a year of maximum sunspot activity. It means upheaval, particularly on the South Asia, with the possibility of nuclear exchanges&quot;.&quot;

Mahmood has published papers concerning djinni, which are described in the Quran as beings made of fire. He has proposed that djinni could be tapped to solve the energy crisis. &quot;I think that if we develop our souls, we can develop communication with them,&quot; Mahmood said about djinni in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in a 1988 interview: &quot;Every new idea has its opponents,&quot; he added. &quot;But there is no reason for this controversy over Islam and science because there is no conflict between Islam and science.&quot;

== New York Times comments ==
The New York Times has described Mahmood as &quot;an autodidact intellectual with grand aspirations,&quot; and noted that &quot;his fellow scientists at PAEC began to wonder if Mahmood was mentally sound.&quot; Mahmood made it clear that he believed Pakistan&#x27;s bomb was &quot;the property of the whole Ummah,&quot; referring to the worldwide Muslim community. &quot;This guy was our ultimate nightmare,&quot; an American intelligence official told the Times in late 2001. He has been awarded a gold medal by the Pakistan Academy of Sciences.

<text>A Roman siege tower or breaching tower (or in the Middle Ages, a belfry) is a specialized siege engine, constructed to protect assailants and ladders while approaching the defensive walls of a fortification. The tower was often rectangular with four wheels with its height roughly equal to that of the wall or sometimes higher to allow archers or crossbowmen to stand on top of the tower and shoot arrows or quarrels into the fortification. Because the towers were wooden and thus flammable, they had to have some non-flammable covering of iron or fresh animal skins.

Evidence for use of siege towers in Ancient Egypt and Anatolia dates to the Bronze Age. They were used extensively in warfare of the ancient Near East after the Late Bronze Age collapse, and in Egypt by Kushites from Sudan who founded the 25th dynasty. During classical antiquity they were common among Hellenistic Greek armies of the 4th century BC and later Roman armies of Europe and the Mediterranean, while also seeing use in ancient China during the Warring States Period and Han dynasty. Siege towers were of unwieldy dimensions and, like trebuchets, were therefore mostly constructed on site of the siege. Taking considerable time to construct, siege towers were mainly built if the defense of the opposing fortification could not be overcome by ladder assault (&quot;escalade&quot;), by mining, or by breaking walls or gates with tools such as battering rams.

The siege tower sometimes housed spearmen, pikemen, and swordsmen or archers and crossbowmen, who shot arrows and quarrels at the defenders. Because of the size of the tower it would often be the first target of large stone catapults, but it had its own projectiles with which to retaliate.

Siege towers were used to get troops over an enemy curtain wall. When a siege tower was near a wall, it would drop a gangplank between it and the wall. Troops could then rush onto the walls and into the castle or city. Some siege towers also had battering rams which they used to bash down the defensive walls around a city or a castle gate.

==Ancient use==
In the First Intermediate Period tomb of General Intef at Thebes (modern Luxor, Egypt), a mobile siege tower is shown in the battle scenes. In modern Harpoot, Turkey, an artistically Akkadian style stone carved relief dated circa 2000 BC was found depicting a siege tower, the earliest known visual depiction from Anatolia (although siege towers were later described in Hittite cuneiform writing).

Siege towers were used by the armies of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 9th century BC, under Ashurnasirpal II (r. 884 BC – 859 BC). Reliefs from his reign, and subsequent reigns, depict siege towers in use with a number of other siege works, including ramps and battering rams.
Centuries after they were employed in Assyria, the use of the siege tower spread throughout the Mediterranean. During the siege of Memphis in the 8th century BC, siege towers were built by Kush for the army led by Piye (founder of the Nubian 25th dynasty), in order to enhance the efficiency of Kushite archers and slingers. 
After leaving Thebes, Piye&#x27;s first objective was besieging Ashmunein. Having assembled his army for their lack of success so far, the King then undertook the personal supervision of operations including the erection of a siege tower from which Kushite archers could fire down into the city.

During the siege of Syracuse in 413 BC, Athenians erected a siege tower on ship hull. Alexander did the same at Tyre (322 BC) as did Marcellus in Syracuse (214 BC). Towers were used against both land and naval targets. At the time of Emperor Aggripa, ship towers were built with a lighter, collapsible design that could be stowed flat on the deck when not in use, lowering the center of gravity.

The biggest siege towers of antiquity, such as the Hellenistic Greek &quot;Helepolis&quot; (meaning &quot;The Taker of Cities&quot; in Greek) of the siege of Rhodes in 305 BC by Demetrius I of Macedon, could be as high as and as wide as . Such large engines would require a rack and pinion to be moved effectively. It was manned by 200 soldiers and was divided into nine stories; the different levels housed various types of catapults and ballistae. Subsequent siege towers down through the centuries often had similar engines.

However, large siege towers could be defeated by the defenders by flooding the ground in front of the wall, creating a moat that caused the tower to get bogged in the mud. The siege of Rhodes illustrates the important point that the larger siege towers needed level ground. Many castles and hill-top towns and forts were virtually invulnerable to siege tower attack simply due to topography. Smaller siege towers might be used on top of siege-mounds, made of earth, rubble and timber mounds in order to overtop a defensive wall. For example, the remains of such a siege-ramp at Masada, Israel built by the Romans during the siege of Masada (72–73 AD) have survived and can still be seen today.

On the other hand, almost all the largest cities were on large rivers, or the coast, and so did have part of their circuit wall vulnerable to these towers. Furthermore, the tower for such a target might be prefabricated elsewhere and brought dismantled to the target city by water. In some rare circumstances, such towers were mounted on ships to assault the coastal wall of a city: at the Roman siege of Cyzicus during the Third Mithridatic War, for example, towers were used in conjunction with more conventional siege weapons.

One of the oldest references to the mobile siege tower in Ancient China was a written dialogue primarily discussing naval warfare. In the Chinese &quot;Yuejueshu&quot; (Lost Records of the State of Yue) written by the later Han dynasty author Yuan Kang in the year 52 AD, Wu Zixu (526 BC – 484 BC) purportedly discussed different ship types with King Helü of Wu (r. 514 BC – 496 BC) while explaining military preparedness. Before labeling the types of warships used, Wu said:

==Medieval and later use==

With the collapse of the Western Roman Empire into independent states, and the Eastern Roman Empire on the defensive, the use of siege towers reached its height during the medieval period. Siege towers were used when the Avars laid siege unsuccessfully to Constantinople in 626, as the &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot; recounts:

At this siege, the attackers also made use mobile armoured shelters known as sows or cats, which were used throughout the medieval period and allowed workers to fill in moats with protection from the defenders (thus levelling the ground for the siege towers to be moved to the walls). However, the construction of a sloping talus at the base of a castle wall (as was common in crusader fortification) could have reduced the effectiveness of this tactic to an extent.

Siege towers also became more elaborate during the medieval period; at the siege of Kenilworth in 1266, for example, 200 archers and 11 catapults operated from a single tower. Even then, the siege lasted almost a year, making it the longest siege in all of English history. They were not invulnerable either, as during the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, Ottoman siege towers were sprayed by the defenders with Greek fire.

Siege towers became vulnerable and obsolete with the development of large cannon. They had only ever existed to get assaulting troops over high walls and towers and large cannons also made high walls obsolete as fortification took a new direction. However, later constructions known as &quot;battery towers&quot; took on a similar role in the gunpowder age; like siege-towers, these were built out of wood on-site for mounting siege artillery. One of these was built by the Russian military engineer Ivan Vyrodkov during the siege of Kazan in 1552 (as part of the Russo-Kazan Wars), and could hold ten large-calibre cannon and fifty lighter cannons. Likely, it was a development of the gulyay-gorod (that is a mobile fortification assembled on wagons or sleds from prefabricated wall-sized shields with holes for cannons). Later battery towers were often used by the Ukrainian Cossacks.

During the Imjin War, the Japanese utilized siege towers to scale the walls of Jinju but were beaten back several times by Korean cannons. In the early 19th century, the Joseon Army utilized siege towers to lay siege to Jeonju where the last of Hong Gyeong-Rae&#x27;s Rebellion made their stand but were beaten back several times by the rebels.

==Modern parallels==

In modern warfare, some vehicles used by police tactical units, counterterrorists, and special forces can be fitted with mechanical assault ladders with ramps. These are essentially modernized siege towers with elements of escalade ladders, and are used to raid a structure through its upper levels. These assault ladders are not as large or as tall as their predecessors, and are typically only capable of reaching roughly the third or fourth floor of a structure.

On 1 March 2007, police officers entered Ungdomshuset in Copenhagen, Denmark using boom cranes in a manner similar to siege towers. The officers were placed in containers that the crane operators raised and placed against the structure&#x27;s windows, from which the officers then entered.

In Islamic terminology &quot;sharīʿah&quot; refers to immutable, intangible divine law; contrary to &quot;fiqh&quot;, which refers to its interpretations by Islamic scholars. Sharia, or fiqh as traditionally known, has always been used alongside customary law from the very beginning in Islamic history; has been elaborated and developed over the centuries by legal opinions issued by qualified jurists – reflecting the tendencies of different schools – and integrated and with various economic, penal and administrative laws issued by Muslim rulers; and implemented for centuries by judges in the courts until recent times, when secularism was widely adopted in Islamic societies.

Traditional theory of Islamic jurisprudence recognizes four sources for Ahkam al-sharia: the Qur&#x27;an, &quot;sunnah&quot; (or authentic ahadith), &quot;ijma&quot; (lit. consensus) (may be understood as &quot;ijma al-ummah&quot; () – a whole Islamic community consensus, or &quot;ijma al-aimmah&quot; () – a consensus by religious authorities), and &quot;analogical reasoning&quot;. It distinguishes two principal branches of law, &quot;rituals &quot;and social dealings; subsections family law, relationships (commercial, political / administrative) and criminal law, in a wide range of topics assigning actions – capable of settling into different categories according to different understandings – to categories mainly as: mandatory, recommended, neutral, abhorred, and prohibited. Beyond legal norms, Sharia also enters many areas that are considered private practises today, such as belief, worshipping, ethics, clothing and lifestyle, and gives to those in command duties to intervene and regulate them.

Over time with the necessities brought by sociological changes, on the basis of interpretative studies legal schools have emerged, reflecting the preferences of particular societies and governments, as well as Islamic scholars or imams on theoretical and practical applications of laws and regulations. Legal schools of Sunni Islam — Hanafi, Maliki, Shafiʽi and Hanbali etc.— developed methodologies for deriving rulings from scriptural sources using a process known as &quot;ijtihad&quot;, a concept adopted by Shiism in much later periods meaning mental effort which broke away politically from mainstream Islamic thought in an early period according to tradition. Although Sharia is presented in addition to its other aspects by the contemporary Islamist understanding, as a form of governance some researchers approach traditional sīrah narratives with skepticism, and early history of Islam, (which has been modelled and exalted by most Muslims) seeing it not as a period when Sharia was dominant, but a kind of &quot;secular Arabic expansion&quot; and they dated the formation of Islamic identity to a much later period.

Approaches to Sharia in the 21st century vary widely, and the role and mutability of Sharia in a changing world has become an increasingly debated topic in Islam. Beyond sectarian differences, fundamentalists advocate the complete and uncompromising implementation of &quot;exact/pure sharia&quot; without modifications, while modernists argue that it can/should be brought into line with human rights and other contemporary issues such as democracy, minority rights, freedom of thought, women&#x27;s rights and banking by new jurisprudences. In Muslim majority countries, traditional laws have been widely used with or changed by European models. Judicial procedures and legal education have been brought in line with European practice likewise. While the constitutions of most Muslim-majority states contain references to Sharia, its rules are largely retained only in family law and penalties in some. The Islamic revival of the late 20th century brought calls by Islamic movements for full implementation of Sharia, including &quot;hudud&quot; corporal punishments, such as stoning through various propaganda methods ranging from civilian activities to terrorism.

== Etymology and usage ==
=== Contemporary usage ===
The word &quot;sharīʿah&quot; is used by Arabic-speaking peoples of the Middle East to designate a prophetic religion in its totality. For example, &quot;sharīʿat Mūsā&quot; means law or religion of Moses and &quot;sharīʿatu-nā&quot; can mean &quot;our religion&quot; in reference to any monotheistic faith. Within Islamic discourse, &quot;šarīʿah&quot; refers to religious regulations governing the lives of Muslims. For many Muslims, the word means simply &quot;justice,&quot; and they will consider any law that promotes justice and social welfare to conform to Sharia. Sharia is the first of Four Doors and the lowest level on the path to God in Sufism and in branches of Islam that are influenced by Sufism, such as Ismailism and Alawism. It is necessary to reach from Sharia to Tariqa, from there to Ma&#x27;rifa and finally to haqiqa. In each of these gates, there are 10 levels that the dervish must pass through.

Jan Michiel Otto summarizes the evolutionary stages of understanding by distinguishing four meanings conveyed by the term &quot;Sharia&quot; in discourses.
* &quot;Divine, abstract sharia&quot;: In this sense, Sharia is a rather abstract concept which leaves ample room for various concrete interpretations by humans.
* &quot;Classical sharia&quot;: This is the body of Islamic rules, principles and cases compiled by religious scholars during the first two centuries after Muhammad, including &quot;Ijtihād&quot;
* &quot;Historical sharia(s)&quot;: This includes the entire body of all principles, rules, cases and interpretations developed and transmitted throughout a history of more than one thousand years across the entire Muslim world, since the closing of the gate of free interpretation up to the present.
* &quot;Contemporary sharia(s)&quot;: This contains the full spectrum of principles, rules, cases and interpretations developed and applied at present. Migration, modernisation and new technologies of information and communication have decreased the dominance of the legal schools of classical sharia.

A related term &quot;&quot; (, Islamic law), which was borrowed from European usage in the late 19th century, is used in the Muslim world to refer to a legal system in the context of a modern state.

=== Etymology ===
The primary meanings of the Arabic word &quot;šarīʿah&quot;, derived from the root &quot;š-r-ʕ&quot;. The lexicographical studies records two major areas of the word can appear without religious connotation. In texts evoking a pastoral or nomadic environment, &quot;šarīʿah&quot; and its derivatives refers to watering animals at a permanent water-hole or to the seashore. One another area of use relates to notions of stretched or lengthy. The word is cognate with the Hebrew &quot;saraʿ&quot; שָׂרַע and is likely to be the origin of the meaning &quot;way&quot; or &quot;path&quot;. Some scholars describe it as an archaic Arabic word denoting &quot;pathway to be followed&quot; (analogous to the Hebrew term Halakhah [&quot;The Way to Go&quot;]), or &quot;path to the water hole&quot; and argue that its adoption as a metaphor for a divinely ordained way of life arises from the importance of water in an arid desert environment.

=== Use in religious texts ===
In the Quran, and its cognate occur once each, with the meaning &quot;way&quot; or &quot;path&quot;. The word was widely used by Arabic-speaking Jews during the Middle Ages, being the most common translation for the word in the 10th-century Arabic translation of the Torah by Saʿadya Gaon. A similar use of the term can be found in Christian writers. The Arabic expression ( ) is a common translation for ( in Hebrew) and ( in Greek in the New Testament [Rom. 7: 22]). In Muslim literature, designates the laws or message of a prophet or God, in contrast to , which refers to a scholar&#x27;s interpretation thereof.

In older English-language law-related works in the late 19th/early 20th centuries, the word used for Sharia was sheri. It, along with the French variant , was used during the time of the Ottoman Empire, and is from the Turkish .

==Historical origins==
According to the traditionalist (&quot;Atharī&quot;) Muslim view, the major precepts of Sharia were passed down directly from the Islamic prophet Muhammad without &quot;historical development&quot; and the emergence of Islamic jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;) also goes back to the lifetime of Muhammad. In this view, his companions and followers took what he did and approved of as a model (sunnah) and transmitted this information to the succeeding generations in the form of hadith. These reports led first to informal discussion and then systematic legal thought, articulated with greatest success in the eighth and ninth centuries by the master jurists Abu Hanifa, Malik ibn Anas, al-Shafi&#x27;i, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who are viewed as the founders of the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafiʿi, and Hanbali legal schools (&quot;madhāhib&quot;) of Sunni jurisprudence.
Modern historians have presented alternative theories of the formation of fiqh while they have accepted the general outlines of the traditionalist account at first. In the late 19th century, an influential revisionist hypothesis was advanced by Ignác Goldziher and elaborated by Joseph Schacht in the mid-20th century. Schacht and other scholars argued that having conquered much more populous agricultural and urban societies with already existing laws and legal needs, the initial Muslim efforts to formulate legal norms
regarded the Quran and Muhammad&#x27;s hadiths as just one source of law, with jurist personal opinions, the legal practice of conquered peoples, and the decrees and decisions of the caliphs also being valid sources. According to this theory, most canonical hadiths did not originate with Muhammad but were actually created at a later date, despite the efforts of hadith scholars to weed out fabrications.
After it became accepted that legal norms must be formally grounded in scriptural sources, proponents of rules of jurisprudence supported by the hadith would extend the chains of transmission of the hadith back to Muhammad&#x27;s companions. In his view, the real architect of Islamic jurisprudence was al-Shafi&#x27;i, who formulated this idea (that legal norms must be formally grounded in scriptural sources) and other elements of classical legal theory in his work &quot;al-risala&quot;, but who was preceded by a body of Islamic law not based on primacy of Muhammad&#x27;s hadiths.

Some articles that may be considered precursors of Sharia law and rituals can be found in the pre-Islamic Arabic Religions; Hajj, salāt and zakāt could be seen in pre-Islamic Safaitic-Arabic inscriptions, and continuity can be observed in many details, especially in today&#x27;s hajj and umrah rituals. The veiling order, which distinguishes between slaves and free women in Islam, also coincides with similar distinctions seen in pre-Islamic civilizations.
Qisas was a practice used as a resolution tool in inter-tribal conflicts in pre-Islamic Arab society. The basis of this resolution was that a member from the tribe to which the murderer belonged was handed over to the victim&#x27;s family for execution, equivalent to the social status of the murdered person. The &quot;condition of social equivalence&quot; meant the execution of a member of the murderer&#x27;s tribe who was equivalent to the murdered person. For example, only a slave could be killed for a slave, and a woman for a woman. In other cases, &quot;compensatory payment (Diya)&quot; could be paid to the family of the murdered. On top of this pre-Islamic understanding added a debate about whether a Muslim can be executed for a non-Muslim during the Islamic period. The main verse for implementation in Islam is Al Baqara 178: &quot;Believers! Retaliation is ordained for you regarding the people who were killed. Free versus free, slave versus slave, woman versus woman. Whoever is forgiven by the brother of the slain for a price, let him abide by the custom and pay the price well.&quot;

Modern historians generally adopt intermediate positions regarding origins, suggesting that early Islamic jurisprudence developed out of a combination of administrative and popular practices shaped by the religious and ethical precepts of Islam. It continued some aspects of pre-Islamic laws and customs of the lands that fell under Muslim rule in the aftermath of the early conquests and modified others, aiming to meet the practical need of establishing Islamic norms of behavior and adjudicating disputes arising in the community. Juristic thought gradually developed in study circles, where independent scholars met to learn from a local master and discuss religious topics. At first, these circles were fluid in their membership, but with time distinct regional legal schools crystallized around shared sets of methodological principles. As the boundaries of the schools became clearly delineated, the authority of their doctrinal tenets came to be vested in a master jurist from earlier times, who was henceforth identified as the school&#x27;s founder. In the course of the first three centuries of Islam, all legal schools came to accept the broad outlines of classical legal theory, according to which Islamic law had to be firmly rooted in the Quran and hadith.

== Traditional jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;) ==

&quot;Fiqh&quot; is traditionally divided into the fields of &quot;uṣūl al-fiqh&quot; (lit. the roots of &quot;fiqh&quot;), which studies the theoretical principles of jurisprudence, and &quot;furūʿ al-fiqh&quot; (lit. the branches of &quot;fiqh&quot;), which is devoted to elaboration of rulings on the basis of these principles.

=== Principles of jurisprudence (&quot;uṣūl al-fiqh&quot;) ===

Classical Islamic jurisprudence refers how to elaborate and interpret religious sources that are considered reliable within the framework of &quot;procedural principles&quot; within its context such as linguistic and &quot;rhetorical tools&quot; to derive judgments for new situations by taking into account certain purposes and mesalih. Textual phrases usually dealt with under simple antithetical headings: general and particular, command and prohibition, obscure and clear, truth and metaphor. It also comprises methods for establishing authenticity of hadith and for determining when the legal force of a scriptural passage is abrogated by a passage revealed at a later date.

The sources of judgment in classical fiqh are roughly divided into two: Manqūlāt (Quran and hadith) and Aqliyyāt (ijma, qiyas, ijtihad and others). Some of them (Aqliyyāt) are considered to be the product of scholastic theology and Aristotelian logic. It was an important area of debate among traditional fiqh scholars how much space should be given to rational methods in creating provisions such as extracting provisions from religious texts, as well as expanding, restricting, abolishing or postponing these provisions according to new situations, considering the purpose and benefit, together with new sociologies, in the face of changing conditions.

In this context, in the Classical period, the ulema were divided into groups (among other divisions such as political divisions) regarding the place of &quot;&#x27;Aql&quot; vis-à-vis naql: those who rely on narration (Atharists, Ahl al-Hadith), those who rely on reason (Ahl al-Kalām, Mu&#x27;tazila and Ahl al-Ra&#x27;y) and those who tried to find a middle way between the two attitudes such as Abu al-Hasan al-Ash&#x27;ari in theology (syncretists). In the classical age of Islam, there were violent conflicts between rationalists (aqliyyun; al-muʿtazila, kalamiyya) and traditionalist (naqliyyun, literalists, Ahl al-Hadith) groups and sects regarding the Quran and hadith or the place of reason in understanding the Quran and hadith, as can be seen in the Mihna example. Although the rationalists initially seemed to gain the upper hand in this conflict, with the rise of literalism, the Mutazila sank into history and literalism continued to live by gaining supporters.

In this context, the formulation of the Sunni view can be summarized as follows; Human reason is a gift from God which should be exercised to its fullest capacity. However, use of reason alone is insufficient to distinguish right from wrong, and rational argumentation must draw its content from the body of transcendental knowledge revealed in the Quran and through the sunnah of Muhammad. In addition to the Quran and sunnah, the classical theory of Sunni fiqh recognizes two other sources of law: juristic consensus (&quot;ijmaʿ&quot;) and analogical reasoning (&quot;qiyas&quot;). It therefore studies the application and limits of analogy, as well as the value and limits of consensus, along with other methodological principles, some of which are accepted by only certain legal schools. This interpretive apparatus is brought together under the rubric of &quot;ijtihad&quot;, which refers to a jurist&#x27;s exertion in an attempt to arrive at a ruling on a particular question.

The theory of Twelver Shia jurisprudence parallels that of Sunni schools with some differences, such as recognition of reason (&quot;ʿaql&quot;) as a source of law in place of &quot;qiyas&quot; and extension of the notion of sunnah to include traditions of the imams.

==== Sources for Ahkam al-Sharia ====

Islamic scholar Rashid Rida (1865–1935 CE) lists the four basic sources of Islamic law, agreed upon by all Sunni Muslims: &quot;the [well-known] sources of legislation in Islam are four: the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot;, the &quot;Sunnah&quot;, the consensus of the &quot;ummah&quot; and &quot;ijtihad&quot; undertaken by competent jurists&quot; 

While traditional understanding strongly denies that Quran may have changed,(Al Hejr:9) the authenticity of hadiths could only be questioned through the chain of narration, though some western researchers suggests that primary sources may have also been evolved.
* &quot;Quran&quot;: in Islam, the Quran is considered to be the most sacred source of law. According to classical mainstream jurists, the verses of the Quran that were &quot;revealed later&quot; in Islamic language may have restricted or abolished the earlier verses. Therefore, deciding which verses of the Quran will be used, in addition to other knowledge and skills, may be the job of lawyers who know these issues in detail. Whether the Sunnah could limit the Quran remained a matter of debate. Fiqh sects are schools of understanding that try to determine the actions that people should do or avoid based on the Quran and hadiths. Hanafi sect requires that in order for something to be considered fard, it must be clearly commanded in the Qur&#x27;an &quot;according to logical and grammatical requirements such as addressee, order and scope, etc.&quot;, expressions that do not meet this condition are placed in the &quot;wujub&quot; class, which expresses a lower level of necessity. Some of these fiqh results (ahkam) may also indicate exaggeration of statements, generalizations taken out of context, and imperative broadening of scope.

A small number of verses in the Quran are about general rules of governance, inheritance, marriage, crime and punishment. Although the Quran does not impose a specific legal-management system, it emphasizes custom in nearly 40 verses and commands justice. (An-Nahl; 90) The practices prescribed in the Quran are considered as reflections of contextual legal understandings, as can be clearly seen in some examples such as Qisas and diya. The following statement in the Quran is thought to be the general rule of testimony in Islamic jurisprudence, except for crime and punishment – for example, debt, shopping, etc.; O believers! When you contract a loan for a fixed period of time, commit it to writing...with justice. Call upon two of your men to witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice will witness so if one of the women forgets the other may remind her... Rules of inheritance was also mentioned in the Quran, in regards to certain family members having their share..

In a different example, in the necklace story of Aisha, called Asbab al-Nuzul for surah An-Nur :11-20 four witnesses were required for the accusation of adultery. In addition, those who made accusations that did not meet the specified conditions would be punished with 80 lashes. The jurisprudence of later periods stipulates that witnesses must be men, covering all hadd crimes and people who did not have credibility and honesty in society (slaves, non-adl; sinners, infidels) could not testify against believers. In addition, the Islamic judiciary did not require proof of the issues defined as tazir. The statement in the Qur&#x27;an that determines the status of slaves in community is; &quot;ma malakat aymanuhum&quot; meaning &quot;those whom your right hands possess&quot;.

Of the few criminal cases listed as crimes in the Quran, only a few of them are punished by the classical books of Sharia as determined by the verses of the Quran and are called hudud laws. How the verse Al-Ma&#x27;idah 33, which describes the crime of hirabah, should be understood is a matter of debate even today. The verse talks about the punishment of criminals by killing, hanging, having their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides, and being exiled from the earth, in response to an -abstract- crime such as &quot;fighting against Allah and His Messenger&quot;. Today, commentators – in the face of the development of the understanding of law and the increasing reactions to corporal punishment- claim that the verse determines the punishment of &quot;concrete sequential criminal acts&quot; – such as massacre, robbery and rape – in addition to rebellion against the legitimate government, and that the punishment to be given depends on the existence of these preconditions. 
* &quot;Sunnah&quot; / &quot;Hadith&quot;:Although hadiths have largely replaced the sunnah in orthodoxy legislation today, according to some research, the opposite was true in the early Islamic society. Sunnah originally meant a tradition that did not contain the definition of good and bad. Later, &quot;good traditions&quot; began to be referred to as sunnah and the concept of &quot;Muhammad&#x27;s sunnah&quot; was established. Muhammad&#x27;s sunnah gave way to the &quot;hadiths of Muhammad&quot; which were transmitted orally, then recorded in corpuses and systematized and purified within following centuries. According to Harald Motzki and Daniel W. Brown the earliest Islamic legal reasonings that have come down to us were &quot;virtually hadith-free&quot;, but gradually, over the course of second century A.H. &quot;the infiltration and incorporation of Prophetic hadiths into Islamic jurisprudence&quot; took place. The value of customs (see also: urf, ma&#x27;ruf) manifests itself in the classification of food and drinks as halal and haram; Some jurists such as Al- Shafi&#x27;i and Ibn Qudamah have determined the haram/halal criterion as &quot;compatibility or contradiction with the Arab&#x27;s customary habits and nature&quot;. 

Although for many Muslim sects, hadith was second to that of the Quran in authority, the majority of Sharia rules derived from hadith rather than the Quran. The body of hadith provides more detailed and practical legal guidance, but it was recognized early on that not all of them were authentic. Early Islamic scholars developed personal criteria for evaluating their authenticity by assessing trustworthiness of the individuals listed in their transmission chains. These studies narrowed down the vast corpus of prophetic traditions to several thousand &quot;sound (seeming to collectors)&quot; hadiths, which were collected in several canonical compilations. The hadiths which enjoyed concurrent transmission were deemed mutawatir; however, the vast majority of hadiths were handed down by only one or a few transmitters and were therefore seen to yield only probable knowledge. The uncertainty was further compounded by ambiguity of the language contained in some hadiths and Quranic passages. Disagreements on the relative merits and interpretation of the textual sources allowed legal scholars considerable leeway in formulating alternative rulings.

In Imam Malik&#x27;s usage, hadith did not consist only of the words claimed to belong to Muhammad as is the case with Shiite Muslims. While hadith does not appear to be an important source of decision for early fiqh scholars such as Abu Hanifa, for later scholars, hadith is perceived as the words of Muhammad merely and is considered as a strong and separate source of decision alongside the Quran. Today, Quranists do not consider hadiths as a valid source of religious rulings.
* &quot;Ijma&quot;: it is the consensus that could in principle elevate a ruling based on probable evidence to absolute certainty. This classical doctrine drew its authority from a series of hadiths stating that the Islamic community could never agree on an error. This form of consensus was technically defined as agreement of all competent jurists in any particular generation, acting as representatives of the community. However, the practical difficulty of obtaining and ascertaining such an agreement meant that it had little impact on legal development. A more pragmatic form of consensus, which could be determined by consulting works of prominent jurists, was used to confirm a ruling so that it could not be reopened for further discussion. The cases for which there was a consensus account form less than 1 percent of the body of classical jurisprudence.
* &quot;Qiyas&quot;: it is the Analogical reasoning that is used to derive a ruling for a situation not addressed in the scripture by analogy with a scripturally based rule. In a classic example, the Quranic prohibition of drinking wine is extended to all intoxicating substances, on the basis of the &quot;cause&quot; (&quot;ʿilla&quot;) shared by these situations, which in this case is identified to be intoxication. Since the cause of a rule may not be apparent, its selection commonly occasioned controversy and extensive debate. Majority of Sunni Muslims view &quot;Qiyas&quot; as a central Pillar of &quot;Ijtihad&quot;. On the other hand; Zahirites, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Al-Bukhari, early Hanbalites, etc rejected &quot;Qiyas&quot; amongst the Sunnis. Twelver Shia jurisprudence also does not recognize the use of &quot;qiyas&quot;, but relies on reason (&quot;ʿ&#x27;aql&quot;) in its place.

===== Aims of Sharia and public interest =====

&quot;Maqāṣid&quot; (aims or purposes) of Sharia and &quot;maṣlaḥa&quot; (welfare or public interest) are two related classical doctrines which have come to play an increasingly prominent role in modern times. Abū Hāmid al-Ghazālī, Izz al-Din ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam and Abu Ishaq al-Shatibi used maslaha and madasıd as equivalent terms. Synonyms for the term maqāṣid aš-šarīʿa are the expressions maqāṣid aš-šāriʿ (&quot;intentions of the legislature&quot;), maqāṣid at-tašrīʿ (&quot;intentions of the legislature &quot;), ruḥ aš -šarīʿa (&quot;Spirit of Sharia&quot;), ḥikmat at-tašrīʿ (&quot;Wisdom of Legislation&quot;) and falsafat at-tašrīʿ (&quot;Philosophy of Legislation&quot;).

They were first clearly articulated by al-Ghazali (d. 1111), who argued that &quot;Maqāṣid&quot; and &quot;maslaha&quot; was God&#x27;s general purpose in revealing the divine law, and that its specific aim was preservation of five essentials of human well-being: religion, life, intellect, offspring, and property.

Although most classical-era jurists recognized &quot;maslaha&quot; and &quot;maqasid&quot; as important legal principles, they held different views regarding the role they should play in Islamic law. Some jurists viewed them as auxiliary rationales constrained by scriptural sources and analogical reasoning. Others regarded them as an &quot;independent&quot; source of law, whose general principles could override specific inferences based on the letter of scripture. Taking maqasid and maslaha as an &quot;independent&quot; source of sharia – rather than an auxiliary one – will pave the way for the re-critique and reorganization of ahkam in the context of maqasid and maslaha, thus (including hudud), which is often criticized in terms of today&#x27;s values and seen as problematic, in terms of the purposes of Sharia and social benefits will be replaced by new ones. Abdallah bin Bayyah goes further with an approach that prioritizes purpose and benefit among the sources of Sharia and declares it to be the heart of &quot;usul-al fiqh&quot;.
While the latter view was held by a minority of classical jurists, in modern times it came to be championed in different forms by prominent scholars who sought to adapt Islamic law to changing social conditions by drawing on the intellectual heritage of traditional jurisprudence. These scholars expanded the inventory of &quot;maqasid&quot; to include such aims of Sharia as reform and women&#x27;s rights (Rashid Rida); justice and freedom (Mohammed al-Ghazali); and human rights and dignity (Yusuf al-Qaradawi).

==== Ijtihad ====

Ijtihad refers to independent reasoning by an expert in Islamic law, or exertion of a jurist&#x27;s mentality in finding a solution to a legal question in contrast with &quot;taqlid&quot; (conformity to precedent ijtihad). According to theory, &quot;ijtihad&quot; requires expertise in the Arabic language, theology, religious texts, and principles of jurisprudence (&quot;usul al-fiqh&quot;), and is not employed where authentic and trusted texts (Qur&#x27;an and hadith) are considered unambiguous with regard to the question, or where there is an existing scholarly consensus (&quot;ijma&quot;). An Islamic scholar who perform &quot;ijtihad&quot; is called &quot;mujtahid&quot;. In the general understanding, beyond the limitation of ijtihad to those situations that do not have a clear ruling in the Quran and hadiths, scholars who have the ability to give general judgments are also ranked with definitions such as &quot;mujtahid mutlaq&quot;, &quot;mujtahid in sect&quot;, &quot;mujtahid in issue&quot;. Rulings based on ijtihad are not decisions that require obligatory implementation for other Muslims.

Throughout the first five Islamic centuries, &quot;ijtihad&quot; continued to practise amongst Sunni Muslims. The controversy surrounding &quot;ijtihad&quot; started with the beginning of the twelfth century. By the 14th century, Islamic Fiqh prompted leading Sunni jurists to state that the main legal questions had been addressed and then &quot;ijtihad&quot; was gradually restricted. In the modern era, this gave rise to a perception amongst Orientalist scholars and sections of the Muslim public that the so-called &quot;gate of &quot;ijtihad&quot;&quot; was closed at the start of the classical era.

Starting from the 18th century, Islamic reformers began calling for abandonment of &quot;taqlid&quot; and emphasis on &quot;ijtihad&quot;, which they saw as a return to Islamic origins. The advocacy of &quot;ijtihad&quot; has been particularly associated with Islamic Modernism and Salafiyya movements. Among contemporary Muslims in the West there have emerged new visions of &quot;ijtihad&quot; which emphasize substantive moral values over traditional juridical undertandings.

Shia jurists did not use the term &quot;ijtihad&quot; until the 12th century. With the exception of Zaydis, the early Imami Shia were unanimous in censuring &quot;Ijtihad&quot; in the field of law (&quot;Ahkam&quot;) until the Shiite embrace of various doctrines of Mu&#x27;tazila and classical Sunnite &quot;Fiqh&quot;. After the victory of the &quot;Usulis&quot; who based law on principles (usul) over the &quot;Akhbaris&quot; (&quot;traditionalists&quot;) who emphasized on reports or traditions (&quot;khabar&quot;) by the 19th century, &quot;Ijtihad&quot; would become a mainstream Shia practice.

The classical process of ijtihad combined these generally recognized principles with other methods, which were not adopted by all legal schools, such as &quot;istihsan&quot; (juristic preference), &quot;istislah&quot; (consideration of public interest) and &quot;istishab&quot; (presumption of continuity).

Considering that, as a rule, there was a hierarchy and power ranking among the sources of Sharia; for example, a subcategory or an auxiliary source will not be able to eliminate a provision clearly stated in the main source or prohibit a practice that was not prohibited though it was known and practiced during the prophetic period. If we look at an example such as the abolition of the validity of Mut&#x27;a marriage, is touched upon in the Quran 4:24, and not prohibited (Sunnis translate the words used in the relevant verse with terms used to describe the ordinary marriage event) according to Sunnis is banned by Muhammad towards the end of his lifetime, and according to Shiites, by Omar, &quot;according to his own opinion&quot; and reliying on power. The Shiite sect did not accept the jurisprudence of Omar, whose political and religious authority they rejected from the beginning.

==== Ahkam al-shar&#x27;iyya (Decision types; labels) ====

Fiqh is concerned with ethical standards as much as with legal norms, seeking to establish not only what is and is not legal, but also what is morally right and wrong. Sharia rulings fall into one of five categories known as &quot;the five decisions&quot; (&quot;al-aḥkām al-khamsa&quot;): mandatory (&quot;farḍ&quot; or &quot;wājib&quot;), recommended (&quot;mandūb&quot; or &quot;mustaḥabb&quot;), neutral (&quot;mubāḥ&quot;), reprehensible (&quot;makrūh&quot;), and forbidden (&quot;ḥarām&quot;).

It is a sin or a crime to perform a forbidden action or not to perform a mandatory action. Reprehensible acts should be avoided, but they are not considered to be sinful or punishable in court. Avoiding reprehensible acts and performing recommended acts is held to be subject of reward in the afterlife, while neutral actions entail no judgment from God. Jurists disagree on whether the term &quot;ḥalāl&quot; covers the first three or the first four categories. The legal and moral verdict depends on whether the action is committed out of necessity (&quot;ḍarūra&quot;) and on the underlying intention (&quot;niyya&quot;), as expressed in the legal maxim &quot;acts are [evaluated according] to intention.&quot;
Hanafi fiqh does not consider both terms as synonymous and makes a distinction between &quot;fard&quot; and &quot;wajib&quot;; In Hanafi fiqh, two conditions are required to impose the fard rule. 1. Nass, (only verses of the Qur&#x27;an can be accepted as evidence here, not hadiths) 2.The expression of the text referring to the subject must be clear and precise enough not to allow other interpretations. The term wajib is used for situations that do not meet the second of these conditions.
However, this understanding may not be sufficient to explain every situation. For example, Hanafis accept 5 daily prayers as fard. However, some religious groups such as Quranists and Shiites, who do not doubt that the Quran existing today is a religious source, infer from the same verses that it is clearly ordered to pray 2 or 3 times, not 5 times. In addition, in religious literature, wajib is widely used for all kinds of religious requirements, without expressing any fiqh definition.

As seen above and in many other examples, classifications and labels have a relative character shaped by the understanding of the people and groups who make them. For example, believing in the existence and miracles of Awliya is presented as a &quot;condition&quot; for orthodox Islam by many prominent Sunni creed writers such as Al-Tahawi and Nasafi and is accepted in traditional Sunnis and Shi&#x27;ism. However, this understanding, along with expressions of respect and visits to the graves of saints, are seen as unacceptable heresy by puritanical and revivalist Islamic movements such as Salafism, Wahhabism and Islamic Modernism.
About six verses address the way a woman should dress when in public; Muslim scholars have differed as how to understand these verses, with some stating that a Hijab is a command (fard) to be fulfilled and others say simply not.

The statement in the Qur&#x27;an that determines the status of slaves and concubines in the understanding of Sharia is as follows; &quot;ma malakat aymanuhum&quot; or &quot;milk al-yamin&quot; meaning &quot;those whom your right hands possess&quot;. It is often stated today that Sharia provides many rights to slaves and aims to eradicate slavery over time. However, the sexual use of female slaves was considered within their definition of &quot;property&quot;, and with a few exceptions, unrestricted sexual use as well as their physical exploitation were approved in traditional Islamic law by the ulama.

A special religious decision, which is &quot;specific to&quot; a person, group, institution, event, situation, belief and practice in different areas of life, and usually includes the approval/disapproval of a judgment, is called fatwa. Tazir penalties, which are outside the Qisas and Hudud laws, have not been codified, and their discretion and implementation are under the initiative and authority of the judge or political authority. Mustafa Öztürk points out some another developments in the Islamic creed, leading changes in ahkam such as determining the conditions of takfir according to theologians; First Muslims believed that God lived in the sky as Ahmad Ibn Hanbal says: &quot;Whoever says that Allah is everywhere is a heretic, an infidel, should be invited to repent, but if he does not, be killed.&quot; This understanding changes later and gives way to the understanding that &quot;God cannot be assigned a place and He is everywhere.&quot;

Judgment that concerns individuals is personal and, for example, in an Islamic Qisas or compensation decisions, jurist must take into account &quot;personal labels&quot; such as the gender, freedom, religious and social status such as mu&#x27;min, kafir, musta&#x27;min, dhimmi, apostate, etc. Similar distinctions also apply to witnessing practices, which have a fundamental value in the establishment of judicial provisions, such as the identification of the criminals. Islamic preachers constantly emphasize the importance of adalah, and in trials, the judge is not expected to observe equality among those on trial, but is expected to act fairly or balanced. Traditional fiqh states that legal and religious responsibility begins with rushd.

=== Branches and details (&quot;furūʿ al-fiqh&quot;) ===
The domain of &quot;furūʿ al-fiqh&quot; (lit. branches of fiqh) is traditionally divided into &quot;ʿibādāt&quot; (rituals or acts of worship) and &quot;muʿāmalāt&quot; (social relations). Many jurists further divided the body of substantive jurisprudence into &quot;the four quarters&quot;, called rituals, sales, marriage and injuries. Each of these terms figuratively stood for a variety of subjects. For example, the quarter of sales would encompass partnerships, guaranty, gifts, and bequests, among other topics. Juristic works were arranged as a sequence of such smaller topics, each called a &quot;book&quot; (&quot;kitab&quot;). The special significance of ritual was marked by always placing its discussion at the start of the work.

Some historians distinguish a field of Islamic criminal law, which combines several traditional categories. Several crimes with scripturally prescribed punishments are known as &quot;hudud&quot;. Jurists developed various restrictions which in many cases made them virtually impossible to apply. Other crimes involving intentional bodily harm are judged according to a version of &quot;lex talionis&quot; that prescribes a punishment analogous to the crime (&quot;qisas&quot;), but the victims or their heirs may accept a monetary compensation (&quot;diya&quot;) or pardon the perpetrator instead; only &quot;diya&quot; is imposed for non-intentional harm. Other criminal cases belong to the category of &quot;taʿzīr&quot;, where the goal of punishment is correction or rehabilitation of the culprit and its form is largely left to the judge&#x27;s discretion. 

Which crime falls into which category may vary depending on understanding. For example, according to some verses and hadiths, those who avoided alms and prayers were the ones to be fought against,) and according to some understandings, they were people who had abandoned religion – theologians debated whether worship was a part of faith – and according to classical fiqh sects, they were people who should be killed. However, even if today&#x27;s dominant understanding defines the abandonment of worship as sinfulness, does not approve of giving worldly punishment for them. However, in Sharia governments, their testimony against a devout Muslim may not be accepted, they may be humiliated and barred from certain positions because of this tag. In practice, since early on in Islamic history, criminal cases were usually handled by ruler-administered courts or local police using procedures which were only loosely related to Sharia.
The two major genres of &quot;furūʿ&quot; literature are the &quot;mukhtasar&quot; (concise summary of law) and the &quot;mabsut&quot; (extensive commentary). &quot;Mukhtasars&quot; were short specialized treatises or general overviews that could be used in a classroom or consulted by judges. A &quot;mabsut&quot;, which usually provided a commentary on a &quot;mukhtasar&quot; and could stretch to dozens of large volumes, recorded alternative rulings with their justifications, often accompanied by a proliferation of cases and conceptual distinctions. The terminology of juristic literature was conservative and tended to preserve notions which had lost their practical relevance. At the same time, the cycle of abridgement and commentary allowed jurists of each generation to articulate a modified body of law to meet changing social conditions. Other juristic genres include the &quot;qawāʿid&quot; (succinct formulas meant to aid the student remember general principles) and collections of fatwas by a particular scholar.

Classical jurisprudence has been described as &quot;one of the major intellectual achievements of Islam&quot; and its importance in Islam has been compared to that of theology in Christianity.

===Schools of law===
The main Sunni schools of law (&quot;madhhabs&quot;) are the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali madhhabs. They emerged in the ninth and tenth centuries and by the twelfth century almost all jurists aligned themselves with a particular madhhab. These four schools recognize each other&#x27;s validity and they have interacted in legal debate over the centuries. Rulings of these schools are followed across the Muslim world without exclusive regional restrictions, but they each came to dominate in different parts of the world. For example, the Maliki school is predominant in North and West Africa; the Hanafi school in South and Central Asia; the Shafi&#x27;i school in Lower Egypt, East Africa, and Southeast Asia; and the Hanbali school in North and Central Arabia. The first centuries of Islam also witnessed a number of short-lived Sunni madhhabs. The Zahiri school, which is commonly identified as extinct, continues to exert influence over legal thought. The development of Shia legal schools occurred along the lines of theological differences and resulted in formation of the Twelver, Zaidi and Ismaili madhhabs, whose differences from Sunni legal schools are roughly of the same order as the differences among Sunni schools. The Ibadi legal school, distinct from Sunni and Shia madhhabs, is predominant in Oman.

The transformations of Islamic legal institutions in the modern era have had profound implications for the madhhab system. Legal practice in most of the Muslim world has come to be controlled by government policy and state law, so that the influence of the madhhabs beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system. State law codification commonly utilized the methods of &quot;takhayyur&quot; (selection of rulings without restriction to a particular madhhab) and &quot;talfiq&quot; (combining parts of different rulings on the same question). Legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional ulema as interpreters of the resulting laws. Global Islamic movements have at times drawn on different madhhabs and at other times placed greater focus on the scriptural sources rather than classical jurisprudence. The Hanbali school, with its particularly strict adherence to the Quran and hadith, has inspired conservative currents of direct scriptural interpretation by the Salafi and Wahhabi movements. Other currents, such as networks of Indonesian ulema and Islamic scholars residing in Muslim-minority countries, have advanced liberal interpretations of Islamic law without focusing on traditions of a particular madhhab.

==Pre-modern Islamic legal system==
=== Jurists ===
Sharia was traditionally interpreted by muftis. During the first few centuries of Islam, muftis were private legal specialists who normally also held other jobs. They issued fatwas (legal opinions), generally free of charge, in response to questions from laypersons or requests for consultation coming from judges, which would be stated in general terms. Fatwas were regularly upheld in courts, and when they were not, it was usually because the fatwa was contradicted by a more authoritative legal opinion. The stature of jurists was determined by their scholarly reputation. The majority of classical legal works, written by author-jurists, were based in large part on fatwas of distinguished muftis. These fatwas functioned as a form of legal precedent, unlike court verdicts, which were valid only for the given case. Although independent muftis never disappeared, from the 12th century onward Muslim rulers began to appoint salaried muftis to answer questions from the public. Over the centuries, Sunni muftis were gradually incorporated into state bureaucracies, while Shia jurists in Iran progressively asserted an autonomous authority starting from the early modern era.
Islamic law was initially taught in study circles that gathered in mosques and private homes. The teacher, assisted by advanced students, provided commentary on concise treatises of law and examined the students&#x27; understanding of the text. This tradition continued to be practiced in &quot;madrasas&quot;, which spread during the 10th and 11th centuries. Madrasas were institutions of higher learning devoted principally to study of law, but also offering other subjects such as theology, medicine, and mathematics. The madrasa complex usually consisted of a mosque, boarding house, and a library. It was maintained by a &quot;waqf&quot; (charitable endowment), which paid salaries of professors, stipends of students, and defrayed the costs of construction and maintenance. At the end of a course, the professor granted a license (&quot;ijaza&quot;) certifying a student&#x27;s competence in its subject matter. Students specializing in law would complete a curriculum consisting of preparatory studies, the doctrines of a particular madhhab, and training in legal disputation, and finally write a dissertation, which earned them a license to teach and issue fatwas.

=== Courts ===
A judge (qadi) was in charge of the qadi&#x27;s court (&quot;mahkama&quot;), also called the Sharia court. Qadis were trained in Islamic law, though not necessarily to a level required to issue fatwas. Court personnel also included a number of assistants performing various roles. Judges were theoretically independent in their decisions, though they were appointed by the ruler and often experienced pressure from members of the ruling elite where their interests were at play. The role of qadis was to evaluate the evidence, establish the facts of the case, and issue a verdict based on the applicable rulings of Islamic jurisprudence. The qadi was supposed to solicit a fatwa from a mufti if it was unclear how the law should be applied to the case. Since Islamic legal theory does not recognize the distinction between private and public law, court procedures were identical for civil and criminal cases, and required a private plaintiff to produce evidence against the defendant. The main type of evidence was oral witness testimony. The standards of evidence for criminal cases were so strict that a conviction was often difficult to obtain even for apparently clear-cut cases. Most historians believe that because of these stringent procedural norms, qadi&#x27;s courts at an early date lost their jurisdiction over criminal cases, which were instead handled in other types of courts.

If an accusation did not result in a verdict in a qadi&#x27;s court, the plaintiff could often pursue it in another type of court called the &quot;mazalim&quot; court, administered by the ruler&#x27;s council. The rationale for &quot;mazalim&quot; (lit. wrongs, grievances) courts was to address the wrongs that Sharia courts were unable to address, including complaints against government officials. Islamic jurists were commonly in attendance and a judge often presided over the court as a deputy of the ruler. &quot;Mazalim&quot; verdicts were supposed to conform to the spirit of Sharia, but they were not bound by the letter of the law or the procedural restrictions of qadi&#x27;s courts.

The police (&quot;shurta&quot;), which took initiative in preventing and investigating crime, operated its own courts. Like the mazalim courts, police courts were not bound by the rules of Sharia and had the powers to inflict discretionary punishments. Another office for maintaining public order was the &quot;muhtasib&quot; (market inspector), who was charged with preventing fraud in economic transactions and infractions against public morality. The &quot;muhtasib&quot; took an active role in pursuing these types of offenses and meted out punishments based on local custom.

=== Socio-political context ===
The social fabric of pre-modern Islamic societies was largely defined by close-knit communities organized around kinship groups and local neighborhoods. Conflicts between individuals had the potential to escalate into a conflict between their supporting groups and disrupt the life of the entire community. Court litigation was seen as a last resort for cases where informal mediation had failed. This attitude was reflected in the legal maxim &quot;amicable settlement is the best verdict&quot; (&quot;al-sulh sayyid al-ahkam&quot;). In court disputes, qadis were generally less concerned with legal theory than with achieving an outcome that enabled the disputants to resume their previous social relationships. This could be accomplished by avoiding a total loss for the losing side or simply giving them a chance to articulate their position in public and obtain a measure of psychological vindication. Islamic law required judges to be familiar with local customs, and they exercised a number of other public functions in the community, including mediation and arbitration, supervision of public works, auditing waqf finances, and looking after the interests of orphans.

Unlike pre-modern cultures where the ruling dynasty promulgated the law, Islamic law was formulated by religious scholars without involvement of the rulers. The law derived its authority not from political control, but rather from the collective doctrinal positions of the legal schools (madhhabs) in their capacity as interpreters of the scriptures. The ulema (religious scholars) were involved in management of communal affairs and acted as representatives of the Muslim population vis-à-vis the ruling dynasties, who before the modern era had limited capacity for direct governance. Military elites relied on the ulema for religious legitimation, with financial support for religious institutions being one of the principal means through which these elites established their legitimacy. In turn, the ulema depended on the support of the ruling elites for the continuing operation of religious institutions. Although the relationship between secular rulers and religious scholars underwent a number of shifts and transformations in different times and places, this mutual dependence characterized Islamic history until the start of the modern era. Additionally, since Sharia contained few provisions in several areas of public law, Muslim rulers were able to legislate various collections of economic, criminal and administrative laws outside the jurisdiction of Islamic jurists, the most famous of which is the &quot;qanun&quot; promulgated by Ottoman sultans beginning from the 15th century. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707) issued a hybrid body of law known as Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, based on Hanafi fatwas as well as decisions of Islamic courts, and made it applicable to all religious communities on the Indian subcontinent. This early attempt to turn Islamic law into semi-codified state legislation sparked rebellions against Mughal rule.

==== Women, non-Muslims, slaves ====

In both the rules of civil disputes and application of penal law, classical Sharia distinguishes between men and women, between Muslims and non-Muslims, and between free persons and slaves.
Traditional Islamic law assumes a patriarchal society with a man at the head of the household. Different legal schools formulated a variety of legal norms which could be manipulated to the advantage of men or women, but women were generally at a disadvantage with respect to the rules of inheritance and witness testimony, where in some cases a woman&#x27;s witness testimony is effectively treated as half of that of a man. Various financial obligations imposed on the husband acted as a deterrent against unilateral divorce and commonly gave the wife financial leverage in divorce proceedings. Women were active in Sharia courts as both plaintiffs and defendants in a wide variety of cases, though some opted to be represented by a male relative.

Sharia was intended to regulate affairs of the Muslim community. Non-Muslims residing under Islamic rule had the legal status of dhimmi, which entailed a number of protections, restrictions, freedoms and legal inequalities, including payment of the jizya tax. Dhimmi communities had legal autonomy to adjudicate their internal affairs. Cases involving litigants from two different religious groups fell under jurisdiction of Sharia courts, where (unlike in secular courts) testimony of non-Muslim witnesses against a Muslim was inadmissible in criminal cases or at all. This legal framework was implemented with varying degree of rigor. In some periods or towns, all inhabitants apparently used the same court without regard for their religious affiliation. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb imposed Islamic law on all his subjects, including provisions traditionally applicable only to Muslims, while some of his predecessors and successors are said to have abolished jizya. According to Ottoman records, non-Muslim women took their cases to a Sharia court when they expected a more favorable outcome on marital, divorce and property questions than in Christian and Jewish courts. Over time, non Muslims in the Ottoman Empire could be more or less likely to use Islamic courts. For example, in 1729 at the Islamic court in Galata only two percent of cases involved non-Muslims whereas in 1789 non-Muslims were a part of thirty percent of cases. Ottoman court records also reflect the use of Islamic courts by formerly non-Muslim women. As it was illegal for non-Muslims to own Muslims and for non-Muslim men to marry Muslim women in the Ottoman empire, conversion to Islam would have been an option for non-Muslim women to free themselves of a spouse or master they did not want to subject to. However, this would likely lead to them being shunned by their former community.
Classical fiqh acknowledges and regulates slavery as a legitimate institution. It granted slaves certain rights and protections, improving their status relative to Greek and Roman law, and restricted the scenarios under which people could be enslaved. However, slaves could not inherit or enter into a contract, and were subject to their master&#x27;s will in a number of ways. The labor and property of slaves were owned by the master, who was also entitled to sexual submission of his unmarried slaves.

Formal legal disabilities for some groups coexisted with a legal culture that viewed Sharia as a reflection of universal principles of justice, which involved protection of the weak against injustices committed by the strong. This conception was reinforced by the historical practice of Sharia courts, where peasants &quot;almost always&quot; won cases against oppressive landowners, and non-Muslims often prevailed in disputes against Muslims, including such powerful figures as the governor of their province. In family matters the Sharia court was seen as a place where the rights of women could be asserted against their husband&#x27;s transgressions.

==Modern legal reforms==
===Under colonial rule===
Starting from the 17th century, European powers began to extend political influence over lands ruled by Muslim dynasties, and by the end of the 19th century, much of the Muslim world came under colonial domination. The first areas of Islamic law to be impacted were usually commercial and criminal laws, which impeded colonial administration and were soon replaced by European regulations. Islamic commercial laws were also replaced by European (mostly French) laws in Muslim states which retained formal independence, because these states increasingly came to rely on Western capital and could not afford to lose the business of foreign merchants who refused to submit to Islamic regulations.
The first significant changes to the legal system of British India were initiated in the late 18th century by the governor of Bengal Warren Hastings. Hastings&#x27; plan of legal reform envisioned a multi-tiered court system for the Muslim population, with a middle tier of British judges advised by local Islamic jurists, and a lower tier of courts operated by qadis. Hastings also commissioned a translation of the classic manual of Hanafi fiqh, &quot;Al-Hidayah&quot;, from Arabic into Persian and then English, later complemented by other texts. These translations enabled British judges to pass verdicts in the name of Islamic law based on a combination of Sharia rules and common law doctrines, and eliminated the need to rely on consultation by local ulema, whom they mistrusted. In the traditional Islamic context, a concise text like &quot;Al-Hidayah&quot; would be used as a basis for classroom commentary by a professor, and the doctrines thus learned would be mediated in court by judicial discretion, consideration of local customs and availability of different legal opinions that could fit the facts of the case. The British use of &quot;Al-Hidayah&quot;, which amounted to an inadvertent codification of Sharia, and its interpretation by judges trained in Western legal traditions anticipated later legal reforms in the Muslim world.

British administrators felt that Sharia rules too often allowed criminals to escape punishment, as exemplified by Hastings&#x27; complaint that Islamic law was &quot;founded on the most lenient principles and on an abhorrence of bloodshed&quot;. In the course of the 19th century, criminal laws and other aspects of the Islamic legal system in India were supplanted by British law, with the exception of Sharia rules retained in family laws and some property transactions. Among other changes, these reforms brought about abolition of slavery, prohibition of child marriage, and a much more frequent use of capital punishment. The resulting legal system, known as &quot;Anglo-Muhammadan law&quot;, was treated by the British as a model for legal reforms in their other colonies. Like the British in India, colonial administrations typically sought to obtain precise and authoritative information about indigenous laws, which prompted them to prefer classical Islamic legal texts over local judicial practice. This, together with their conception of Islamic law as a collection of inflexible rules, led to an emphasis on traditionalist forms of Sharia that were not rigorously applied in the pre-colonial period and served as a formative influence on the modern identity politics of the Muslim world.

===Ottoman Empire===

During the colonial era, Muslim rulers concluded that they could not resist European pressure unless they modernized their armies and built centrally administered states along the lines of Western models. In the Ottoman Empire, the first such changes in the legal sphere involved placing the formerly independent waqfs under state control. This reform, passed in 1826, enriched the public treasury at the expense of the waqfs, thereby depleting the financial support for traditional Islamic legal education. Over the second half of the 19th century, a new hierarchical system of secular courts was established to supplement and eventually replace most religious courts. Students hoping to pursue legal careers in the new court system increasingly preferred attending secular schools over the traditional path of legal education with its dimming financial prospects. 

The Tanzimat reforms of the 19th century saw reorganization of both Islamic civil law and sultanic criminal law after the model of the Napoleonic Code. In the 1870s, a codification of civil law and procedure (excepting marriage and divorce), called the &quot;Mecelle&quot;, was produced for use in both Sharia and secular courts. It adopted the Turkish language for the benefit of the new legal class who no longer possessed competence in the Arabic idiom of traditional jurisprudence. The code was based on Hanafi law, and its authors selected minority opinions over authoritative ones when they were felt to better &quot;suit the present conditions&quot;. The Mecelle was promulgated as a &quot;qanun&quot; (sultanic code), which represented an unprecedented assertion of the state&#x27;s authority over Islamic civil law, traditionally the preserve of the ulema. The 1917 Ottoman Law of Family Rights adopted an innovative approach of drawing rules from minority and majority opinions of all Sunni madhhabs with a modernizing intent. The Republic of Turkey, which emerged after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, abolished its Sharia courts and replaced Ottoman civil laws with the Swiss Civil Code, but Ottoman civil laws remained in force for several decades in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and Iraq.

===Nation states===
Westernization of legal institutions and expansion of state control in all areas of law, which began during the colonial era, continued in nation-states of the Muslim world. Sharia courts at first continued to exist alongside state courts as in earlier times, but the doctrine that sultanic courts should implement the ideals of Sharia was gradually replaced by legal norms imported from Europe. Court procedures were also brought in line with European practice. Though the Islamic terms &quot;qadi&quot; and &quot;mahkama&quot; (qadi&#x27;s/Sharia court) were preserved, they generally came to mean judge and court in the Western sense. While in the traditional Sharia court all parties represented themselves, in modern courts they are represented by professional lawyers educated in Western-style law schools, and the verdicts are subject to review in an appeals court. In the 20th century, most countries abolished a parallel system of Sharia courts and brought all cases under a national civil court system.

In most Muslim-majority countries, traditional rules of classical fiqh have been largely preserved only in family law. In some countries religious minorities such as Christians or Shia Muslims have been subject to separate systems of family laws. Many Muslims today believe that contemporary Sharia-based laws are an authentic representation of the pre-modern legal tradition. In reality, they generally represent the result of extensive legal reforms made in the modern era. As traditional Islamic jurists lost their role as authoritative interpreters of the laws applied in courts, these laws were codified by legislators and administered by state systems which employed a number of devices to effect changes, including:
* Selection of alternative opinions from traditional legal literature (&quot;takhayyur&quot;), potentially among multiple madhhabs or denominations, and combining parts of different rulings (&quot;talfiq&quot;).
* Appeal to the classical doctrines of necessity (&quot;darura&quot;), public interest (&quot;maslaha&quot;), and the objectives (&quot;maqasid&quot;) of Sharia, which played a limited role in classical fiqh, but were now given wider utilitarian applications.
* Changes in administrative law that grant the courts discretionary powers to restrict certain practices which are not forbidden by substantive law (e.g., polygamy), in some cases imposing penal sanctions as additional deterrence.
* Modernist interpretation of Islamic scriptures without adherence to the rules or methodologies of traditional jurisprudence, known as &quot;neo-ijtihad&quot;.

The most powerful influence on liberal reformist thought came from the work of the Egyptian Islamic scholar Muhammad ʿAbduh (1849–1905). Abduh viewed only Sharia rules pertaining to religious rituals as inflexible, and argued that the other Islamic laws should be adapted based on changing circumstances in consideration of social well-being. Following precedents of earlier Islamic thinkers, he advocated restoring Islam to its original purity by returning to the Quran and the sunna instead of following the medieval schools of jurisprudence. He championed a creative approach to ijtihad that involved direct interpretation of scriptures as well as the methods of &quot;takhayyur&quot; and &quot;talfiq&quot;.

One of the most influential figures in modern legal reforms was the Egyptian legal scholar Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri (1895–1971), who possessed expertise in both Islamic and Western law. Sanhuri argued that reviving Islamic legal heritage in a way that served the needs of contemporary society required its analysis in light of the modern science of comparative law. He drafted the civil codes of Egypt (1949) and Iraq (1951) based on a variety of sources, including classical fiqh, European laws, existing Arab and Turkish codes, and the history of local court decisions. Sanhuri&#x27;s Egyptian code incorporated few classical Sharia rules, but he drew on traditional jurisprudence more frequently for the Iraqi code. Sanhuri&#x27;s codes were subsequently adopted in some form by most Arab countries.

Aside from the radical reforms of Islamic family law carried out in Tunisia (1956) and Iran (1967), governments often preferred to make changes that made a clear break from traditional Sharia rules by imposing administrative hurdles rather than changing the rules themselves, in order to minimize objections from religious conservatives. Various procedural changes have been made in a number of countries to restrict polygamy, give women greater rights in divorce, and eliminate child marriage. Inheritance has been the legal domain least susceptible to reform, as legislators have been generally reluctant to tamper with the highly technical system of Quranic shares. Some reforms have faced strong conservative opposition. For example, the 1979 reform of Egyptian family law, promulgated by Anwar Sadat through presidential decree, provoked an outcry and was annulled in 1985 by the supreme court on procedural grounds, to be later replaced by a compromise version. The 2003 reform of Moroccan family law, which sought to reconcile universal human rights norms and the country&#x27;s Islamic heritage, was drafted by a commission that included parliamentarians, religious scholars and feminist activists, and the result has been praised by international rights groups as an example of progressive legislation achieved within an Islamic framework.

=== Islamization ===

The Islamic revival of the late 20th century brought the topic of Sharia to international attention in the form of numerous political campaigns in the Muslim world calling for full implementation of Sharia. A number of factors have contributed to the rise of these movements, classified under the rubric of Islamism or political Islam, including the failure of authoritarian secular regimes to meet the expectations of their citizens, and a desire of Muslim populations to return to more culturally authentic forms of socio-political organization in the face of a perceived cultural invasion from the West. Shiite leaders such as Ayatollah Khomeini drew on leftist anticolonialist rhetoric by framing their call for Sharia as a resistance struggle. They accused secular leaders of corruption and predatory behavior, and claimed that a return to Sharia would replace despotic rulers with pious leaders striving for social and economic justice. In the Arab world these positions are often encapsulated in the slogan &quot;Islam is the solution&quot; (&quot;al-Islam huwa al-hall&quot;).

Full implementation of Sharia theoretically refers to expanding its scope to all fields of law and all areas of public life. In practice, Islamization campaigns have focused on a few highly visible issues associated with the conservative Muslim identity, particularly women&#x27;s hijab and the &quot;hudud&quot; criminal punishments (whipping, stoning and amputation) prescribed for certain crimes. For many Islamists, &quot;hudud&quot; punishments are at the core of the divine Sharia because they are specified by the letter of scripture rather than by human interpreters. Modern Islamists have often rejected, at least in theory, the stringent procedural constraints developed by classical jurists to restrict their application. To the broader Muslim public, the calls for Sharia often represent, even more than any specific demands, a vague vision of their current economic and political situation being replaced by a &quot;just utopia&quot;.

A number of legal reforms have been made under the influence of these movements, starting from the 1970s when Egypt and Syria amended their constitutions to specify Sharia as the basis of legislation. The Iranian Revolution of 1979 represented a watershed for Shiism advocates, demonstrating that it was possible to replace a secular regime with a theocracy. Several countries, including Iran, Pakistan, Sudan, and some Nigerian states have incorporated hudud rules into their criminal justice systems, which, however, retained fundamental influences of earlier Westernizing reforms. In practice, these changes were largely symbolic, and aside from some cases brought to trial to demonstrate that the new rules were being enforced, hudud punishments tended to fall into disuse, sometimes to be revived depending on the local political climate. The supreme courts of Sudan and Iran have rarely approved verdicts of stoning or amputation, and the supreme courts of Pakistan and Nigeria have never done so. Nonetheless, Islamization campaigns have also had repercussions in several other areas of law, leading to curtailment of rights of women and religious minorities, and in the case of Sudan contributing to the breakout of a civil war.

Advocates of Islamization have often been more concerned with ideology than traditional jurisprudence and there is no agreement among them as to what form a modern Sharia-based &quot;Islamic state&quot; should take. This is particularly the case for the theorists of Islamic economics and Islamic finance, who have advocated both free-market and socialist economic models. The notion of &quot;Sharia-compliant&quot; finance has become an active area of doctrinal innovation and its development has had a major impact on business operations around the world.

== Contemporary applications ==

According to human rights groups, some of the classical Sharia practices involve serious violations of basic human rights, gender equality and freedom of expression, and the practices of countries governed by Sharia are criticized. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg (ECtHR) ruled in several cases that Sharia is &quot;incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy&quot;. &quot;Human rights concept&quot; have been categorically excluded by the governments of countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia under Sharia, claiming that it belongs to secular and western values, while the Cairo conference by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation declared that human rights can only be respected if they are compatible with Islam.

=== Muslim-majority countries ===
The legal systems of most Muslim-majority countries can be classified as either secular or mixed. Sharia plays no role in secular legal systems. In mixed legal systems, Sharia rules are allowed to influence some national laws, which are codified and may be based on European or Indian models, and the central legislative role is played by politicians and modern jurists rather than the ulema (traditional Islamic scholars).

Saudi Arabia and some other Persian Gulf states possess what may be called classical Sharia systems, where national law is largely uncodified and formally equated with Sharia, with ulema playing a decisive role in its interpretation. Iran has adopted some features of classical Sharia systems, while also maintaining characteristics of mixed systems, like codified laws and a parliament.

==== Constitutional law ====
Constitutions of many Muslim-majority countries refer to Sharia as a source or the main source of law, though these references are not in themselves indicative of how much the legal system is influenced by Sharia, and whether the influence has a traditionalist or modernist character. The same constitutions usually also refer to universal principles such as democracy and human rights, leaving it up to legislators and the judiciary to work out how these norms are to be reconciled in practice. Conversely, some countries (e.g., Algeria), whose constitution does not mention Sharia, possess Sharia-based family laws. Nisrine Abiad identifies Bahrain, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia as states with &quot;strong constitutional consequences of Sharia &quot;on the organization and functioning of power&quot;.

==== Family law ====
Except for secular systems, Muslim-majority countries possess Sharia-based laws dealing with family matters (marriage, inheritance, etc.). These laws generally reflect influence of various modern-era reforms and tend to be characterized by ambiguity, with traditional and modernist interpretations often manifesting themselves in the same country, both in legislation and court decisions. In some countries (e.g., parts of Nigeria), people can choose whether to pursue a case in a Sharia or secular court.

==== Criminal law ====

Countries in the Muslim world generally have criminal codes influenced by civil law or common law, and in some cases a combination of Western legal traditions. Saudi Arabia has never adopted a criminal code and Saudi judges still follow traditional Hanbali jurisprudence. In the course of Islamization campaigns, several countries (Libya, Pakistan, Iran, Sudan, Mauritania, and Yemen) inserted Islamic criminal laws into their penal codes, which were otherwise based on Western models. In some countries only &quot;hudud&quot; penalties were added, while others also enacted provisions for &quot;qisas&quot; (law of retaliation) and &quot;diya&quot; (monetary compensation). Iran subsequently issued a new &quot;Islamic Penal Code&quot;. The criminal codes of Afghanistan and United Arab Emirates contain a general provision that certain crimes are to be punished according to Islamic law, without specifying the penalties. Some Nigerian states have also enacted Islamic criminal laws. Laws in the Indonesian province of Aceh provide for application of discretionary (&quot;ta&#x27;zir&quot;) punishments for violation of Islamic norms, but explicitly exclude &quot;hudud&quot; and &quot;qisas&quot;. Brunei has been implementing a &quot;Sharia Penal Code&quot;, which includes provisions for stoning and amputation, in stages since 2014. The countries where &quot;hudud&quot; penalties are legal do not use stoning and amputation routinely, and generally apply other punishments instead.

==== Property law ====
Sharia recognizes the concept of &quot;haqq&quot;. &quot;Haqq&quot; refers to personal rights of the individual and the right to generate and accumulate wealth. The various ways in which property can be acquired under Sharia are purchase, inheritance, bequest, physical or mental effort, &quot;diya&quot; and donations. Certain concepts relating to property under Sharia are &quot;Mulk&quot;, &quot;Waqf&quot;, &quot;Mawat&quot; and &quot;Motasarruf&quot;.

=== Court procedures ===


Sharia courts traditionally do not rely on lawyers; plaintiffs and defendants represent themselves. In Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which have preserved traditional procedure in Sharia courts, trials are conducted solely by the judge, and there is no jury system. There is no pre-trial discovery process, and no cross-examination of witnesses. Unlike common law, judges&#x27; verdicts do not set binding precedents under the principle of &quot;stare decisis&quot;, and unlike civil law, Sharia is left to the interpretation in each case and has no formally codified universal statutes.

The rules of evidence in Sharia courts traditionally prioritize oral testimony, and witnesses must be Muslim. In criminal cases, women witnesses are unacceptable in stricter, traditional interpretations of Sharia, such as those found in Hanbali jurisprudence, which forms the basis of law in Saudi Arabia.

====Evidences / testimonies====
In Criminal cases: A confession, an oath, or the oral testimony of Muslim witnesses are the main evidence admissible in traditional sharia courts for hudud crimes, i.e., the religious crimes of adultery, fornication, rape, accusing someone of illicit sex but failing to prove it, apostasy, drinking intoxicants and theft.

According to classical jurisprudence, testimony must be from at least two free Muslim male witnesses, or one Muslim male and two Muslim females, who are not related parties and who are of sound mind and reliable character. Testimony to establish the crime of adultery, fornication or rape must be from four Muslim male witnesses, with some fiqhs allowing substitution of up to three male with six female witnesses; however, at least one must be a Muslim male.

Forensic evidence (&quot;i.e.&quot;, fingerprints, ballistics, blood samples, DNA etc.) and other circumstantial evidence may likewise rejected in hudud cases in favor of eyewitnesses in some modern interpretations. In the case of regulations that were part of local Malaysian legislation that did not go into effect, this could cause severe difficulties for women plaintiffs in rape cases. In Pakistan, DNA evidence is rejected in paternity cases on the basis of legislation that favors the presumption of children&#x27;s legitimacy, while in sexual assault cases DNA evidence is regarded as equivalent to expert opinion and evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

In civil cases; recommends written financial contracts with reliable witnesses, although there is dispute about equality of female testimony.

Marriage is solemnized as a written financial contract, in the presence of two Muslim male witnesses, and it includes a brideprice (Mahr) payable from a Muslim man to a Muslim woman. The brideprice is considered by a Sharia court as a form of debt. Written contracts were traditionally considered paramount in Sharia courts in the matters of dispute that are debt-related, which includes marriage contracts. Written contracts in debt-related cases, when notarized by a judge, is deemed more reliable.

In commercial and civil contracts, such as those relating to exchange of merchandise, agreement to supply or purchase goods or property, and others, oral contracts and the testimony of Muslim witnesses historically triumphed over written contracts. Islamic jurists traditionally held that written commercial contracts may be forged. Timur Kuran states that the treatment of written evidence in religious courts in Islamic regions created an incentive for opaque transactions, and the avoidance of written contracts in economic relations. This led to a continuation of a &quot;largely oral contracting culture&quot; in Muslim-majority nations and communities.

In lieu of written evidence, oaths are traditionally accorded much greater weight; rather than being used simply to guarantee the truth of ensuing testimony, they are themselves used as evidence. Plaintiffs lacking other evidence to support their claims may demand that defendants take an oath swearing their innocence, refusal thereof can result in a verdict for the plaintiff. Taking an oath for Muslims can be a grave act; one study of courts in Morocco found that lying litigants would often &quot;maintain their testimony right up to the moment of oath-taking and then to stop, refuse the oath, and surrender the case.&quot; Accordingly, defendants are not routinely required to swear before testifying, which would risk casually profaning the Quran should the defendant commit perjury.

==== Diya ====
In classical jurisprudence monetary compensation for bodily harm (&quot;diya&quot; or blood money) is assessed differently for different classes of victims. For example, for Muslim women the amount was half that assessed for a Muslim man. &quot;Diya&quot; for the death of a free Muslim man is twice as high as for Jewish and Christian victims according to the Maliki and Hanbali madhhabs and three times as high according to Shafi&#x27;i rules. Several legal schools assessed &quot;diya&quot; for Magians (&quot;majus&quot;) at one-fifteenth the value of a free Muslim male.

Modern countries which incorporate classical &quot;diya&quot; rules into their legal system treat them in different ways. The Pakistan Penal Code modernized the Hanafi doctrine by eliminating distinctions between Muslims and non-Muslims. In Iran, &quot;diya&quot; for non-Muslim victims professing one of the faiths protected under the constitution (Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians) was made equal to &quot;diya&quot; for Muslims in 2004, though according to a 2006 US State Department report, the penal code still discriminates against other religious minorities and women. According to Human Rights Watch and the US State Department, in Saudi Arabia Jewish or Christian male plaintiffs are entitled to half the amount a Muslim male would receive, while for all other non-Muslim males the proportion is one-sixteenth.

=== Role of fatwas ===

The spread of codified state laws and Western-style legal education in the modern Muslim world has displaced traditional muftis from their historical role of clarifying and elaborating the laws applied in courts. Instead, fatwas have increasingly served to advise the general public on other aspects of Sharia, particularly questions regarding religious rituals and everyday life. Modern fatwas deal with topics as diverse as insurance, sex-change operations, moon exploration and beer drinking. Most Muslim-majority states have established national organizations devoted to issuing fatwas, and these organizations to a considerable extent replaced independent muftis as religious guides for the general population. State-employed muftis generally promote a vision of Islam that is compatible with state law of their country.

Modern public and political fatwas have addressed and sometimes sparked controversies in the Muslim world and beyond. Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s proclamation condemning Salman Rushdie to death for his novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; is credited with bringing the notion of fatwa to world&#x27;s attention, although some scholars have argued that it did not qualify as one. Together with later militant fatwas, it has contributed to the popular misconception of the fatwa as a religious death warrant.

Modern fatwas have been marked by an increased reliance on the process of &quot;ijtihad&quot;, i.e. deriving legal rulings based on an independent analysis rather than conformity with the opinions of earlier legal authorities (&quot;taqlid&quot;), and some of them are issued by individuals who do not possess the qualifications traditionally required of a mufti. The most notorious examples are the fatwas of militant extremists. When Osama bin Laden and his associates issued a fatwa in 1998 proclaiming &quot;jihad against Jews and Crusaders&quot;, many Islamic jurists, in addition to denouncing its content, stressed that bin Laden was not qualified to either issue a fatwa or proclaim a jihad. New forms of ijtihad have also given rise to fatwas that support such notions as gender equality and banking interest, which are at variance with classical jurisprudence.

In the internet age, a large number of websites provide fatwas in response to queries from around the world, in addition to radio shows and satellite television programs offering call-in fatwas. Erroneous and sometimes bizarre fatwas issued by unqualified or eccentric individuals in recent times have sometimes given rise to complaints about a &quot;chaos&quot; in the modern practice of issuing fatwas. There exists no international Islamic authority to settle differences in interpretation of Islamic law. An International Islamic Fiqh Academy was created by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, but its legal opinions are not binding. The vast amount of fatwas produced in the modern world attests to the importance of Islamic authenticity to many Muslims. However, there is little research available to indicate to what extent Muslims acknowledge the authority of different muftis or heed their rulings in real life.

=== Role of &quot;hisba&quot; ===

The classical doctrine of &quot;hisba&quot;, associated with the Quranic injunction of &quot;enjoining good and forbidding wrong&quot;, refers to the duty of Muslims to promote moral rectitude and intervene when another Muslim is acting wrongly. Historically, its legal implementation was entrusted to a public official called &quot;muhtasib&quot; (market inspector), who was charged with preventing fraud, disturbance of public order and infractions against public morality. This office disappeared in the modern era everywhere in the Muslim world, but it was revived in Arabia by the first Saudi state, and later instituted as a government committee responsible for supervising markets and public order. It has been aided by volunteers enforcing attendance of daily prayers, gender segregation in public places, and a conservative notion of hijab. Committee officers were authorized to detain violators before a 2016 reform. With the rising international influence of Wahhabism, the conception of &quot;hisba&quot; as an individual obligation to police religious observance has become more widespread, which led to the appearance of activists around the world who urge fellow Muslims to observe Islamic rituals, dress code, and other aspects of Sharia.

In Iran, &quot;hisba&quot; was enshrined in the constitution after the 1979 Revolution as a &quot;universal and reciprocal duty&quot;, incumbent upon both the government and the people. Its implementation has been carried out by official committees as well as volunteer forces (&quot;basij&quot;). Elsewhere, policing of various interpretations of Sharia-based public morality has been carried out by the Kano State Hisbah Corps in the Nigerian state of Kano, by &quot;Wilayatul Hisbah&quot; in the Aceh province of Indonesia, by the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice in the Gaza Strip, and by the Taliban during their 1996–2001 and 2021–present rule of Afghanistan. Religious police organizations tend to have support from conservative currents of public opinion, but their activities are often disliked by other segments of the population, especially liberals, urban women, and younger people.

In Egypt, a law based on the doctrine of hisba had for a time allowed a Muslim to sue another Muslim over beliefs that may harm society, though because of abuses it has been amended so that only the state prosecutor may bring suit based on private requests. Before the amendment was passed, a hisba suit brought by a group of Islamists against the liberal theologian Nasr Abu Zayd on charges of apostasy led to the annulment of his marriage. The law was also invoked in an unsuccessful blasphemy suit against the feminist author Nawal El Saadawi. Hisba has also been invoked in several Muslim-majority countries as rationale for blocking pornographic content on the internet and for other forms of faith-based censorship.

=== Muslim-minority countries ===
Sharia also plays a role beyond religious rituals and personal ethics in some countries with Muslim minorities. For example, in Israel Sharia-based family laws are administered for the Muslim population by the Ministry of Justice through the Sharia Courts. In India, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act provides for the use of Islamic law for Muslims in several areas, mainly related to family law. In England, the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal makes use of Sharia family law to settle disputes, though this limited adoption of Sharia is controversial.

== Support and opposition ==

=== Support ===
A 2013 survey based on interviews of 38,000 Muslims, randomly selected from urban and rural parts in 39 countries using area probability designs, by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found that a majority—in some cases &quot;overwhelming&quot; majority—of Muslims in a number of countries support making &quot;Sharia&quot; or &quot;Islamic law&quot; the law of the land, including Afghanistan (99%), Iraq (91%), Niger (86%), Malaysia (86%), Pakistan (84%), Morocco (83%), Bangladesh (82%), Egypt (74%), Indonesia (72%), Jordan (71%), Uganda (66%), Ethiopia (65%), Mali (63%), Ghana (58%), and Tunisia (56%). In Muslim regions of Southern-Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the support is less than 50%: Russia (42%), Kyrgyzstan (35%), Tajikistan (27%), Kosovo (20%), Albania (12%), Turkey (12%), Kazakhstan (10%), Azerbaijan (8%). Regional averages of support were 84% in South Asia, 77% in Southeast Asia, 74% in the Middle-East/North Africa, 64%, in Sub-Saharan Africa, 18% in Southern-Eastern Europe, and 12% in Central Asia .

However, while most of those who support implementation of Sharia favor using it in family and property disputes, fewer supported application of severe punishments such as whippings and cutting off hands, and interpretations of some aspects differed widely. According to the Pew poll, among Muslims who support making Sharia the law of the land, most do not believe that it should be applied to non-Muslims. In the Muslim-majority countries surveyed this proportion varied between 74% (of 74% in Egypt) and 19% (of 10% in Kazakhstan), as percentage of those who favored making Sharia the law of the land.

In all of the countries surveyed, respondents were more likely to define Sharia as &quot;the revealed word of God&quot; rather than as &quot;a body of law developed by men based on the word of God&quot;. In analyzing the poll, Amaney Jamal has argued that there is no single, shared understanding of the notions &quot;Sharia&quot; and &quot;Islamic law&quot; among the respondents. In particular, in countries where Muslim citizens have little experience with rigid application of Sharia-based state laws, these notions tend to be more associated with Islamic ideals like equality and social justice than with prohibitions. Other polls have indicated that for Egyptians, the word &quot;Sharia&quot; is associated with notions of political, social and gender justice.

In 2008, Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has suggested that Islamic and Orthodox Jewish courts should be integrated into the British legal system alongside ecclesiastical courts to handle marriage and divorce, subject to agreement of all parties and strict requirements for protection of equal rights for women. His reference to the Sharia sparked a controversy. Later that year, Nicholas Phillips, then Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, stated that there was &quot;no reason why Sharia principles [...] should not be the basis for mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution.&quot; A 2008 YouGov poll in the United Kingdom found 40% of Muslim students interviewed supported the introduction of Sharia into British law for Muslims. Michael Broyde, professor of law at Emory University specializing in alternative dispute resolution and Jewish law, has argued that Sharia courts can be integrated into the American religious arbitration system, provided that they adopt appropriate institutional requirements as American rabbinical courts have done.

=== Opposition ===
In the Western world, Sharia has been called a source of &quot;hysteria&quot;, &quot;more controversial than ever&quot;, the one aspect of Islam that inspires &quot;particular dread&quot;. On the Internet, &quot;dozens of self-styled counter-jihadis&quot; emerged to campaign against Sharia law, describing it in strict interpretations resembling those of Salafi Muslims. Also, fear of Sharia law and of the ideology of extremism among Muslims as well as certain congregations donating money to terrorist organizations within the Muslim community reportedly spread to mainstream conservative Republicans in the United States. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich won ovations calling for a federal ban on Sharia law.
The issue of &quot;liberty versus Sharia&quot; was called a &quot;momentous civilisational debate&quot; by right-wing pundit Diana West.
In 2008 in Britain, the future Prime Minister (David Cameron) declared his opposition to &quot;any expansion of Sharia law in the UK.&quot; In Germany, in 2014, the Interior Minister (Thomas de Maizière) told a newspaper (&quot;Bild&quot;), &quot;Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil.&quot;

Some countries and jurisdictions have explicit bans on Sharia law. In Canada, for example, sharia law has been explicitly banned in Quebec by a 2005 unanimous vote of the National Assembly, while the province of Ontario allows family law disputes to be arbitrated only under Ontario law. In the U.S., opponents of Sharia have sought to ban it from being considered in courts, where it has been routinely used alongside traditional Jewish and Catholic laws to decide legal, business, and family disputes subject to contracts drafted with reference to such laws, as long as they do not violate secular law or the U.S. constitution. After failing to gather support for a federal law making observing Sharia a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison, anti-Sharia activists have focused on state legislatures. By 2014, bills aimed against use of Sharia have been introduced in 34 states and passed in 11. A notable example of this would be 2010 Oklahoma State Question 755, which sought to permanently ban the use of Sharia law in courts. While approved by voters, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals placed an injunction on the law. Citing the unconstitutionality of the law&#x27;s impartial focus on a specific religion, the law was struck down and never took effect. These bills have generally referred to banning foreign or religious law in order to thwart legal challenges.

According to Jan Michiel Otto, Professor of Law and Governance in Developing Countries at Leiden University, &quot;[a]nthropological research shows that people in local communities often do not distinguish clearly whether and to what extent their norms and practices are based on local tradition, tribal custom, or religion. Those who adhere to a confrontational view of Sharia tend to ascribe many undesirable practices to Sharia and religion overlooking custom and culture, even if high-ranking religious authorities have stated the opposite.&quot;

== Contemporary debates and controversies ==
=== Compatibility with democracy ===
It has been argued that the extent to which Sharia is compatible with democracy depends on how it is culturally interpreted, with a cultural position that Sharia represents the human attempt to interpret God&#x27;s message associated with a greater preference for democracy than an Islamist interpretation that Sharia law is the literal word of God.

==== General Muslim views ====
Scholars John L. Esposito and DeLong-Bas distinguish four attitudes toward Sharia and democracy prominent among contemporary Muslims:
* Advocacy of democratic ideas, often accompanied by a belief that they are compatible with Islam, which can play a public role within a democratic system, as exemplified by many protestors who took part in the Arab Spring uprisings;
* Support for democratic procedures such as elections, combined with religious or moral objections toward some aspects of Western democracy seen as incompatible with Sharia, as exemplified by Islamic scholars like Yusuf al-Qaradawi;
* Rejection of democracy as a Western import and advocacy of traditional Islamic institutions, such as shura (consultation) and ijma (consensus), as exemplified by supporters of absolute monarchy and radical Islamist movements;
* Belief that democracy requires restricting religion to private life, held by a minority in the Muslim world.

According to Polls conducted by Gallup and PEW in Muslim-majority countries; most Muslims see no contradiction between democratic values and religious principles, desiring neither a theocracy, nor a secular democracy, but rather a political model where democratic institutions and values can coexist with the values and principles of Sharia.

==== Islamic political theories ====
Muslih and Browers identify three major perspectives on democracy among prominent Muslims thinkers who have sought to develop modern, distinctly Islamic theories of socio-political organization conforming to Islamic values and law:
* The rejectionist Islamic view, elaborated by Sayyid Qutb and Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, condemns imitation of foreign ideas, drawing a distinction between Western democracy and the Islamic doctrine of &quot;shura&quot; (consultation between ruler and ruled). This perspective, which stresses comprehensive implementation of Sharia, was widespread in the 1970s and 1980s among various movements seeking to establish an Islamic state, but its popularity has diminished in recent years.
* The moderate Islamic view stresses the concepts of &quot;maslaha&quot; (public interest), &quot;ʿadl&quot; (justice), and &quot;shura&quot;. Islamic leaders are considered to uphold justice if they promote public interest, as defined through &quot;shura&quot;. In this view, &quot;shura&quot; provides the basis for representative government institutions that are similar to Western democracy, but reflect Islamic rather than Western values. Hasan al-Turabi, Rashid al-Ghannushi, and Yusuf al-Qaradawi have advocated different forms of this view.
* The liberal Islamic view is influenced by Muhammad Abduh&#x27;s emphasis on the role of reason in understanding religion. It stresses democratic principles based on pluralism and freedom of thought. Authors like Fahmi Huwaidi and Tariq al-Bishri have constructed Islamic justifications for full citizenship of non-Muslims in an Islamic state by drawing on early Islamic texts. Others, like Mohammed Arkoun and Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd, have justified pluralism and freedom through non-literalist approaches to textual interpretation. Abdolkarim Soroush has argued for a &quot;religious democracy&quot; based on religious thought that is democratic, tolerant, and just. Islamic liberals argue for the necessity of constant reexamination of religious understanding, which can only be done in a democratic context.

==== European Court of Human Rights ====
In 1998 the Constitutional Court of Turkey banned and dissolved Turkey&#x27;s Refah Party over its announced intention to introduce Sharia-based laws, ruling that it would change Turkey&#x27;s secular order and undermine democracy. On appeal by Refah the European Court of Human Rights determined that &quot;sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy&quot;. Refah&#x27;s Sharia-based notion of a &quot;plurality of legal systems, grounded on religion&quot; was ruled to contravene the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It was determined that it would &quot;do away with the State&#x27;s role as the guarantor of individual rights and freedoms&quot; and &quot;infringe the principle of non-discrimination between individuals as regards their enjoyment of public freedoms, which is one of the fundamental principles of democracy&quot;. In an analysis, Maurits S. Berger found the ruling to be &quot;nebulous&quot; and surprising from a legal point of view, since the Court neglected to define what it meant by &quot;Sharia&quot; and would not, for example, be expected to regard Sharia rules for Islamic rituals as contravening European human rights values. Kevin Boyle also criticized the decision for not distinguishing between extremist and mainstream interpretations of Islam and implying that peaceful advocacy of Islamic doctrines (&quot;an attitude which fails to respect [the principle of secularism]&quot;) is not protected by the European Convention provisions for freedom of religion.

=== Compatibility with human rights ===
Governments of several predominantly Muslim countries have criticized the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) for its perceived failure to take into account the cultural and religious context of non-Western countries. Iran declared in the UN assembly that UDHR was &quot;a secular understanding of the Judeo-Christian tradition&quot;, which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law. Islamic scholars and Islamist political parties consider &#x27;universal human rights&#x27; arguments as imposition of a non-Muslim culture on Muslim people, a disrespect of customary cultural practices and of Islam. In 1990, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, a group representing all Muslim-majority nations, met in Cairo to respond to the UDHR, then adopted the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam.

Ann Elizabeth Mayer points to notable absences from the Cairo Declaration: provisions for democratic principles, protection for religious freedom, freedom of association and freedom of the press, as well as equality in rights and equal protection under the law. Article 24 of the Cairo declaration states that &quot;all the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic &quot;shari&#x27;a&quot;&quot;.

In 2009, the journal &quot;Free Inquiry&quot; summarized the criticism of the Cairo Declaration in an editorial: &quot;We are deeply concerned with the changes to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by a coalition of Islamic states within the United Nations that wishes to prohibit any criticism of religion and would thus protect Islam&#x27;s limited view of human rights. In view of the conditions inside the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Syria, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Afghanistan, we should expect that at the top of their human rights agenda would be to rectify the legal inequality of women, the suppression of political dissent, the curtailment of free expression, the persecution of ethnic minorities and religious dissenters—in short, protecting their citizens from egregious human rights violations. Instead, they are worrying about protecting Islam.&quot;

H. Patrick Glenn states that Sharia is structured around the concept of mutual obligations of a collective, and it considers individual human rights as potentially disruptive and unnecessary to its revealed code of mutual obligations. In giving priority to this religious collective rather than individual liberty, the Islamic law justifies the formal inequality of individuals (women, non-Islamic people). Bassam Tibi states that Sharia framework and human rights are incompatible. Abdel al-Hakeem Carney, in contrast, states that Sharia is misunderstood from a failure to distinguish &quot;Sharia&quot; from &quot;siyasah&quot; (politics).

==== Blasphemy ====
In classical fiqh, blasphemy refers to any form of cursing, questioning or annoying God, Muhammad or anything considered sacred in Islam, including denying one of the Islamic prophets or scriptures, insulting an angel or refusing to accept a religious commandment. Jurists of different schools prescribed different punishment for blasphemy against Islam, by Muslims and non-Muslims, ranging from imprisonment or fines to the death penalty. In some cases, Sharia allows non-Muslims to escape death by converting and becoming a devout follower of Islam. In the modern Muslim world, the laws pertaining to blasphemy vary by country, and some countries prescribe punishments consisting of fines, imprisonment, flogging, hanging, or beheading.

Blasphemy laws were rarely enforced in pre-modern Islamic societies, but in the modern era some states and radical groups have used charges of blasphemy in an effort to burnish their religious credentials and gain popular support at the expense of liberal Muslim intellectuals and religious minorities.

Blasphemy, as interpreted under Sharia, is controversial. Representatives of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation have petitioned the United Nations to condemn &quot;defamation of religions&quot; because &quot;Unrestricted and disrespectful freedom of opinion creates hatred and is contrary to the spirit of peaceful dialogue&quot;. The Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam subjects free speech to unspecified Sharia restrictions: Article 22(a) of the Declaration states that &quot;Everyone shall have the right to express his opinion freely in such manner as would not be contrary to the principles of the Shariah.&quot; Others, in contrast, consider blasphemy laws to violate freedom of speech, stating that freedom of expression is essential to empowering both Muslims and non-Muslims, and point to the abuse of blasphemy laws in prosecuting members of religious minorities, political opponents, and settling personal scores. In Pakistan, blasphemy laws have been used to convict more than a thousand people, about half of them Ahmadis and Christians. While none have been legally executed, two Pakistani politicians, Shahbaz Bhatti and Salmaan Taseer, have been assassinated over their criticism of the blasphemy laws. The Pakistani blasphemy laws are based upon colonial-era legislation which made it a &quot;crime to disturb a religious assembly, trespass on burial grounds, insult religious beliefs or intentionally destroy or defile a place or an object of worship&quot;, with these laws being modified between 1980 and 1986 by the military government of General Zia-ul Haq to make them more severe. A number of clauses were added by the government in order to &quot;Islamicise&quot; the laws and deny the Muslim character of the Ahmadi minority.

==== Apostasy ====

According to Islam, apostasy from Islam is a sin while Al-Baqara 256 says &quot;there is no compulsion in religion&quot;. Typically there is a waiting period to allow the apostate time to repent and to return to Islam. Wael Hallaq writes that &quot;[in] a culture whose lynchpin is religion, religious principles and religious morality, apostasy is in some way equivalent to high treason in the modern nation-state&quot;. Early Islamic jurists set the standard for apostasy from Islam so high that practically no apostasy verdict could be passed before the 11th century, but later jurists lowered the bar for applying the death penalty, allowing judges to interpret the apostasy law in different ways, which they did sometimes leniently and sometimes strictly. In the late 19th century, the use of criminal penalties for apostasy fell into disuse, although civil penalties were still applied.

Some Islamic jurists continue to regard apostasy as a crime deserving the death penalty. A number of liberal and progressive Islamic scholars have argued that apostasy should not be viewed as a crime.
 Others argue that the death penalty is an inappropriate punishment, inconsistent with the Qur&#x27;anic verses such as Al-Baqara 256 containing &quot;no compulsion in religion&quot;; or that it was a man-made rule enacted in the early Islamic community to prevent and punish the equivalent of desertion or treason, and should be enforced only if apostasy becomes a mechanism of public disobedience and disorder (&quot;fitna&quot;). According to Khaled Abou El Fadl, moderate Muslims do not believe that apostasy requires punishment. The death penalty or other punishment for apostasy in Islam is a violation of universal human rights, and an issue of freedom of faith and conscience.

Twenty-three Muslim-majority countries, , penalized apostasy from Islam through their criminal laws.
, apostasy from Islam was a capital offense in Afghanistan, Brunei, Mauritania, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. In other countries, Sharia courts could use family laws to void the Muslim apostate&#x27;s marriage and to deny child-custody rights as well as inheritance rights. In the years 1985–2006, four individuals were legally executed for apostasy from Islam: &quot;one in Sudan in 1985; two in Iran, in 1989 and 1998; and one in Saudi Arabia in 1992.&quot; While modern states have rarely prosecuted apostasy, the issue has a &quot;deep cultural resonance&quot; in some Muslim societies and Islamists have tended to exploit it for political gain. In a 2008–2012 Pew Research Center poll, public support for capital punishment for apostasy among Muslims ranged from 78% in Afghanistan to less than 1% in Kazakhstan, reaching over 50% in 6 of the 20 countries surveyed.

==== LGBTQ rights ====
Homosexual intercourse is illegal in classical Sharia, with different penalties, including capital punishment, stipulated depending on the situation and legal school. In pre-modern Islam, the penalties prescribed for homosexual acts were &quot;to a large extent theoretical&quot; according to the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot;, owing in part to stringent procedural requirements for their harsher (&quot;hudud&quot;) forms and in part to prevailing social tolerance toward same-sex relationships. Historical instances of prosecution for homosexual acts are rare, and those which followed Sharia rules are even rarer. Public attitudes toward homosexuality in the Muslim world turned more negative starting from the 19th century through the gradual spread of Islamic fundamentalist movements such as Salafism and Wahhabism, and under the influence of sexual notions prevalent in Europe at that time. A number of Muslim-majority countries have retained criminal penalties for homosexual acts enacted under colonial rule. In recent decades, prejudice against LGBT individuals in the Muslim world has been exacerbated by increasingly conservative attitudes and the rise of Islamist movements, resulting in Sharia-based penalties enacted in several countries. The death penalty for homosexual acts is currently a legal punishment in Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, some northern states in Nigeria, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, parts of Somalia, and Yemen, all of which have Sharia-based criminal laws. It is unclear whether the laws of Afghanistan and United Arab Emirates provide for the death penalty for gay sex, &quot;as they have never been carried out&quot;. Criminalization of consensual homosexual acts and especially making them liable to capital punishment has been condemned by international rights groups. According to polls, the level of social acceptance for homosexuality ranges from 52% among Muslims in the U.S. to less than 10% in a number of Muslim-majority nations.

==== Women ====
===== Personal status and child marriage =====
Shari&#x27;a is the basis for personal status laws in most Islamic-majority nations. These personal status laws determine rights of women in matters of marriage, divorce and child custody. A 2011 UNICEF report mentions that Sharia law provisions are different for women in financial matters than from general human rights provisions. In many countries, in legal proceedings relating to Sharia-based personal status law, in financial cases a woman&#x27;s testimony is worth half of a man&#x27;s before a court.

The 1917 codification of Islamic family law in the Ottoman empire distinguished between the age of competence for marriage, which was set at 18 for boys and 17 for girls, and the minimum age for marriage, which followed the traditional Hanafi limits of 12 for boys and 9 for girls. Marriage below the age of competence was permissible only if proof of sexual maturity was accepted in court, while marriage under the minimum age was forbidden. During the 20th century, most countries in the Middle East followed the Ottoman precedent in defining the age of competence, while raising the minimum age to 15 or 16 for boys and 13–16 for girls. Marriage below the age of competence is subject to approval by a judge and the legal guardian of the adolescent. Egypt diverged from this pattern by setting the age limits of 18 for boys and 16 for girls, without a distinction between competence for marriage and minimum age.

===== Property rights =====
Islamic law granted Muslim women certain legal rights, such as property rights which women in the West did not possess until &quot;comparatively recent times&quot;. Starting with the 20th century, Western legal systems evolved to expand women&#x27;s rights, but women&#x27;s rights in the Muslim world have to varying degree remained tied to the Quran, hadiths and their traditional interpretations by Islamic jurists. Sharia grants women the right to inherit property from other family members, and these rights are detailed in the Quran. A woman&#x27;s inheritance can be unequal if she inherits from her father as daughters inherit half as much as their brothers.

===== Domestic violence =====
Jonathan A.C. Brown says:
The vast majority of the ulama across the Sunni schools of law inherited the Prophet&#x27;s unease over domestic violence and placed further restrictions on the evident meaning of the &#x27;Wife Beating Verse&#x27;. A leading Meccan scholar from the second generation of Muslims, Ata&#x27; bin Abi Rabah, counseled a husband not to beat his wife even if she ignored him but rather to express his anger in some other way. Darimi, a teacher of both Tirmidhi and Muslim bin Hajjaj as well as a leading early scholar in Iran, collected all the Hadiths showing Muhammad&#x27;s disapproval of beating in a chapter entitled &#x27;The Prohibition on Striking Women&#x27;. A thirteenth-century scholar from Granada, Ibn Faras, notes that one camp of ulama had staked out a stance forbidding striking a wife altogether, declaring it contrary to the Prophet&#x27;s example and denying the authenticity of any Hadiths that seemed to permit beating. Even Ibn Hajar, the pillar of late medieval Sunni Hadith scholarship, concludes that, contrary to what seems to be an explicit command in the Qur&#x27;an, the Hadiths of the Prophet leave no doubt that striking one&#x27;s wife to discipline her actually falls under the Shariah ruling of &#x27;strongly disliked&#x27; or &#x27;disliked verging on prohibited&#x27;.

The Surah 4:34, in the Quran, has been debated for domestic violence and also has been the subject to varied interpretations. According to some interpretations, Sharia condones certain forms of domestic violence against women, when a husband suspects &quot;nushuz&quot; (disobedience, disloyalty, rebellion, ill conduct) in his wife only after admonishing and staying away from the bed does not work. These interpretations have been criticized as inconsistent with women&#x27;s rights in domestic abuse cases. Musawah, CEDAW, KAFA and other organizations have proposed ways to modify Sharia-inspired laws to improve women&#x27;s rights in Muslim-majority nations, including women&#x27;s rights in domestic abuse cases.

Others believe that wife-beating is not consistent with a more modernist perspective of the Quran. Many Imams and scholars who learned Shariah in traditional Islamic seminaries object to the misuse of this verse to justify domestic violence. Muslims for White Ribbon Campaign was launched in 2010 with Imams and Muslim leaders committing to join with others to work to end violence against women. Khutbah campaigns were held in many parts of the world to speak out against domestic violence and encourage Muslim congregants to eradicate domestic abuse.

===== Rape =====
Rape is considered a serious crime in the Sharia law since the Islamic prophet Muhammad ordered rapists to be punished by stoning. The terms &quot;ghasaba&quot; and &quot;ightasaba&quot; have been used by traditional jurists when discussing sexual assault and its punishment. Imam Al-Shāfi&#x27;ī defined rape as: &quot;Forcing a woman to commit zinā against her will&quot;. To the Ḥanafis, illegal intercourse is considered rape when there is no consent and no deliberate action from the victim. In Mālik&#x27;s view, rape refers to any kind of unlawful sexual intercourse by usurpation and without consent. This includes instances when the condition of the victims prevents them from expressing their resistance, such as insanity, sleep or being under age. The Hanbalites, similar to the Mālikites, consider the use of any kind of force as a denial of consent from the victim. The threat of starvation or suffering the cold of winter are also regarded as against one&#x27;s will.

==== Slavery ====

Sharia authorized the institution of slavery, using the words &quot;abd&quot; (slave) and the phrase &quot;ma malakat aymanukum&quot; (&quot;that which your right hand owns&quot;) to refer to women slaves, seized as captives of war. Under Islamic law, Muslim men could have sexual relations with female captives and slaves. Sharia, in Islam&#x27;s history, provided a religious foundation for enslaving non-Muslim women and men, but allowed for the manumission of slaves. A slave woman who bore a child to her Muslim master (&quot;umm al-walad&quot;) could not be sold, becoming legally free upon her master&#x27;s death, and the child was considered free and a legitimate heir of the father.

==== Terrorism ====
Some extremists have used their interpretation of Islamic scriptures and Sharia, in particular the doctrine of jihad, to justify acts of war and terror against Muslim as well as non-Muslim individuals and governments. The expert on terrorism Rachel Ehrenfeld wrote that the &quot;Sharia&#x27;s finance (Islamic banking) is a new weapon in the arsenal of what might be termed fifth-generation warfare (5GW)&quot;. However, Sharia-compliant financing actually requires a person to stay away from weapons manufacturing.

In classical fiqh, the term &quot;jihad&quot; refers to armed struggle against oppressors. Classical jurists developed an elaborate set of rules pertaining to jihad, including prohibitions on harming those who are not engaged in combat. According to Bernard Lewis, &quot;[a]t no time did the classical jurists offer any approval or legitimacy to what we nowadays call terrorism&quot; and the terrorist practice of suicide bombing &quot;has no justification in terms of Islamic theology, law or tradition&quot;. In the modern era the notion of jihad has lost its jurisprudential relevance and instead gave rise to an ideological and political discourse. While modernist Islamic scholars have emphasized defensive and non-military aspects of jihad, some radicals have advanced aggressive interpretations that go beyond the classical theory. For al-Qaeda ideologues, in jihad all means are legitimate, including targeting Muslim non-combatants and the mass killing of non-Muslim civilians.

Some modern ulema, such as Yusuf al-Qaradawi and Sulaiman Al-Alwan, have supported attacks against Israeli army reservists and hence should be considered as soldiers, while Hamid bin Abdallah al-Ali declared that suicide attacks in Chechnya were justified as a &quot;sacrifice&quot;. Many prominent Islamic scholars, including al-Qaradawi himself, have issued condemnations of terrorism in general terms. For example, Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia has stated that &quot;terrorizing innocent people [...] constitute[s] a form of injustice that cannot be tolerated by Islam&quot;, while Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, Grand Imam of al-Azhar and former Grand Mufti of Egypt has stated that &quot;attacking innocent people is not courageous; it is stupid and will be punished on the Day of Judgment&quot;.

== Comparison with other legal systems ==
=== Jewish law ===

Islamic legal tradition has a number of parallels with Judaism. In both religions, revealed law holds a central place, in contrast to Christianity which does not possess a body of revealed law, and where theology rather than law is considered to be the principal field of religious study. Both Islamic and Jewish law (&quot;Halakha&quot;) are derived from formal textual revelations (Quran and Pentateuch) as well as less formal, orally transmitted prophetic traditions (&quot;hadith&quot; and &quot;mishna&quot;). According to some scholars, the words &quot;sharia&quot; and &quot;halakha&quot; both mean literally &quot;the path to follow&quot;. The &quot;fiqh&quot; literature parallels rabbinical law developed in the Talmud, with fatwas being analogous to rabbinic &quot;responsa&quot;.

However, the emphasis on &quot;qiyas&quot; in classical Sunni legal theory is both more explicitly permissive than Talmudic law with respect to authorizing individual reason as a source of law, and more implicitly restrictive, in excluding other, unauthorized forms of reasoning.

=== Common law systems ===

Early Islamic law developed a number of legal concepts that anticipated similar such concepts that later appeared in English common law. Similarities exist between the royal English contract protected by the action of debt and the Islamic &quot;Aqd&quot;, between the English assize of novel disseisin and the Islamic &quot;Istihqaq&quot;, and between the English jury and the Islamic &quot;Lafif&quot; in classical Maliki jurisprudence. The law schools known as Inns of Court also parallel Madrasahs. The methodology of legal precedent and reasoning by analogy (&quot;Qiyas&quot;) are also similar in both the Islamic and common law systems, as are the English trust and agency institutions to the Islamic &quot;Waqf&quot; and &quot;Hawala&quot; institutions, respectively.

Elements of Islamic law also have other parallels in Western legal systems. For example, the influence of Islam on the development of an international law of the sea can be discerned alongside that of the Roman influence. George Makdisi has argued that the madrasa system of attestation paralleled the legal scholastic system in the West, which gave rise to the modern university system. The triple status of &quot;faqih&quot; (&quot;master of law&quot;), &quot;mufti&quot; (&quot;professor of legal opinions&quot;) and &quot;mudarris&quot; (&quot;teacher&quot;), conferred by the classical Islamic legal degree, had its equivalents in the medieval Latin terms &quot;magister&quot;, &quot;professor&quot; and &quot;doctor&quot;, respectively, although they all came to be used synonymously in both East and West.

Makdisi suggested that the medieval European doctorate, &quot;licentia docendi&quot; was modeled on the Islamic degree &quot;ijazat al-tadris wa-l-ifta&quot;, of which it is a word-for-word translation, with the term &quot;ifta&quot;&#x27; (issuing of fatwas) omitted. He also argued that these systems shared fundamental freedoms: the freedom of a professor to profess his personal opinion and the freedom of a student to pass judgement on what he is learning.

There are differences between Islamic and Western legal systems. For example, Sharia classically recognizes only natural persons, and never developed the concept of a legal person, or corporation, i.e., a legal entity that limits the liabilities of its managers, shareholders, and employees; exists beyond the lifetimes of its founders; and that can own assets, sign contracts, and appear in court through representatives. Interest prohibitions imposed secondary costs by discouraging record keeping and delaying the introduction of modern accounting. Such factors, according to Timur Kuran, have played a significant role in retarding economic development in the Middle East. However, the rise of monopoly wealth and corporations have proven to also be detrimental to the economic equality of a society. Ziauddin Sardar also suggests that the promotion of equitable wealth distribution and suppression of monopoly capital are a part of Islam&#x27;s message that emphasises genuine equity and justice.

<doc id="28841" wikidata="Q234764" url="?curid=28841" title="Sunnah">
<text> or sunnat, is the body of traditions and practices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad that constitute a model for Muslims to follow. The sunnah is what all the Muslims of Muhammad&#x27;s time supposedly saw, followed, and passed on to the next generations. Differing from the Sunni Muslims, the largest Islamic denomination, is that of Shia, who prioritize the role of Imams in interpreting the sunnah and that the true interpreters are the Twelve Imams, and Sufi who hold that Muhammad transmitted the values of sunnah &quot;through a series of Sufi teachers&quot;.

According to classical Islamic theories, the sunnah is primarily documented by hadith—which are the verbally-transmitted record of the teachings, actions, deeds, sayings, and silent approvals or disapprovals attributed to Muhammad—and alongside the Quran (the book of Islam) are the divine revelation (&quot;wahy&quot;) delivered through Muhammad that make up the primary sources of Islamic law, beliefs, and theology. The sunnah is classified into different types based on Muhammad&#x27;s actions: his specific words (&quot;Sunnah Qawliyyah&quot;), his actions such as habits and practices (&quot;Sunnah Fiiliyyah&quot;), and silent approvals (&quot;Sunnah Taqririyyah&quot;).

Historically, in pre-Islamic Arabia, the term &quot;sunnah&quot; referred to &#x27;manner of acting&#x27;, (Urf) whether good or bad and recording of it was also an Arabian tradition. Later, &quot;good traditions&quot; began to be referred to as sunnah and the concept of &quot;Muhammad&#x27;s sunnah&quot; was established. During the early Islamic period, it included precedents set by both Muhammad, and his companions. In addition, the sunnah of Muhammad was not necessarily associated with hadith. The strict focus of Mohammad&#x27;s example—especially as recorded in hadith—as the only authoratative source of &quot;sunnah&quot; was established later, particularly by the scholar Al-Shafi‘i ( 820 CE), in the late second century of Islam. The term &quot;as-sunnah&quot; (, ) then eventually came to be viewed as synonymous with the sunnah of Muhammad, based on hadith reports, distinct from other practices. 

According to Muslim belief, Muhammad was the best exemplar for Muslims, with the Quran instructing followers to emulate his conduct and enjoin his followers to obey him. The sunnah serves as a guide not only for fundamental religious practices such as salat (prayer), but for &quot;even the most mundane activities&quot;, such as the order in which to cut fingernails or the proper length of a beard. Additionally, in Islamic jurisprudence, the term &quot;sunnah&quot; can also refer to optional religious duties, such as sunnah salat (sunnah prayers), which are encouraged but not obligatory.
==Definitions and usage==
&#x27; ( ; : &#x27; ) is an Arabic word that means: 
*&quot;habit&quot; or &quot;usual practice&quot; (USC glossary); 
*&quot;habitual practice, customary procedure or action, norm, usage sanctioned by tradition&quot; (Wehr Dictionary); 
*&quot;a body of established customs and beliefs that make up a tradition&quot; (Oxford Islamic Studies Online); 
*&quot;a path, a way, a manner of life&quot; (M. A. Qazi);
*&quot;precedent&quot; or &quot;way of life&quot; (pre-Islamic definition, Joseph Schacht and Ignác Goldziher).

Its religious definition can be:
* &quot;the Sunna of the Prophet, i.e., his sayings and doings, later established as legally binding precedents&quot; (along with the Law established by the Quran) (Hans Wehr); 
* &quot;All of the traditions and practices of the Prophet&quot; of Islam, &quot;that have become models to be followed&quot; by Muslims (M. A. Qazi);
* &quot;the body of traditional social and legal custom and practice of the Islamic community&quot; (Encyclopædia Britannica);
*&quot;the actions and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad&quot; (Oxford Islamic Studies Online).
* &quot;&quot;Al-Hikma&quot; (wisdom)&quot;, as per definition of Shafi&#x27;i school in his book, ar-Risala, based on his interpretation of Qur&#x27;an chapter Al Imran .

Islam Web gives two slightly different definitions:
*&quot;the statements, actions and approvals (or disapprovals) of Prophet Muhammad&quot;, (definition used by &quot;legal theorists&quot;); 
*&quot;anything narrated from or about the Prophet... either before or after he became a prophet, of his statements, actions, confirmations, biography, and his physical character and attributes&quot; (used by scholars of hadith).
It was first used with the meaning of &quot;law&quot; in the Syro-Roman law book before it became widely used in Islamic jurisprudence.

=== Sunnah and hadith ===

In the context of biographical records of Muhammad, sunnah often stands synonymous with hadith since most of the personality traits of Muhammad are known from descriptions of him, his sayings and his actions from hadith. According to Seyyed Nasr, the hadith contains the words of Muhammad, while the sunnah contains his words and actions along with pre-Islamic practices of which he approved. In the context of sharia, Malik ibn Anas and the Hanafi scholars are assumed to have differentiated between the two: for example Malik is said to have rejected some traditions that reached him because, according to him, they were against the &quot;established practice of the people of Medina&quot;.
=== &quot;Sunnah Salat&quot; ===

In addition to being &quot;the way&quot; of Islam or the traditional social and legal custom and practice of the Islamic community, sunnah is often used as a synonym for &quot;mustahabb&quot; (encouraged) rather than &quot;wajib&quot;/&quot;fard&quot; (obligatory), regarding some commendable action (usually the saying of a prayer).

=== &quot;Ahl as-Sunnah&quot; ===

Sunni Muslims are also referred to as &quot;Ahl as-Sunnah wa&#x27;l-Jamā&#x27;ah&quot; (&quot;people of the tradition and the community (of Muhammad)&quot;) or &quot;Ahl as-Sunnah&quot; for short. Some early Sunnî Muslim scholars (such as Abu Hanifa, al-Humaydî, Ibn Abî &#x27;Âsim, Abû Dâwûd, and Abû Nasr al-Marwazî) reportedly used the term &quot;the sunnah&quot; narrowly to refer to Sunni Doctrine as opposed to the creeds of Shia and other non-Sunni Islamic sects. Sunnah literally means &quot;face&quot;, &quot;nature&quot;, &quot;lifestyle&quot;, etc. In the time of Muhammad&#x27;s companion, newly converted Muslims accepted and rejected some set of creed by using reason. So many early Muslim scholars started writing books on creed entitled as &quot;sunnah&quot;.

=== In the Quran ===
The word &quot;sunna&quot; appears several times in the Qur&#x27;an, but there is no specific mention of sunnah of the messenger or prophet (&quot;sunnat al-rasool&quot;, &quot;sunnat al-nabi&quot; or &quot;sunna al-nabawiyyah&quot;), i.e. the way/practice of Muhammad (there are several verses calling on Muslims to obey Muhammad—see below). Four verses (8.38, 15.13, 18.55) use the expression &quot;sunnat al-awwalin&quot;, which is thought to mean &quot;the way or practice of the ancients&quot;. It is described as something &quot;that has passed away&quot; or prevented unbelievers from accepting God. &quot;Sunnat Allah&quot; (the &quot;way of God&quot;) appears eight times in five verses. In addition, verse 17.77 talks of both the way of other, earlier Muslim messengers (Ibrahim, Musa, etc.), and of &quot;our way&quot;, i.e. God&#x27;s way:
This indicates to some scholars (such as Javed Ahmad Ghamidi) that sunnah predates both the Quran and Muhammad, and is actually the tradition of the prophets of God, specifically the tradition of Abraham. Christians, Jews and the Arab descendants of Ishmael, the Arabized Arabs or Ishmaelites, when Muhammad reinstituted this practice as an integral part of Islam.

==History and etymology==
Prior to the &quot;golden age of classical Islamic jurisprudence&quot;, the &quot;ancient schools&quot; of law prevailed.

The traditions not directly sourced from hadith or practice of Muhammad and instead traced solely to some Sahabah were also acknowledged as a source of jurisprudence. These were regarded by scholars of Islam – such as Nawawi – as &quot;unrecorded hadith&quot; which, while not explicitly attributed to Muhammad himself – were clearly practiced by the first generation of Muhammad&#x27;s followers. Al-Nawawi has listed Zubayr ibn al-Awwam&#x27;s ruling regarding ethics of sitting down during eating and drinking in his book, Riyadh as Shaliheen, by basing the ethic in az-Zubayr practice, which was narrated by his son, Abdulah. Another manners and ethic ruling based on az-Zubayr is the prohibition of sleeping after Sübuh, as well as the one concerning the ethics of sitting down while drinking.

Other examples of this kind of &quot;sunnah&quot; also include:

*the difference in the number of lashes used to punish alcohol consumption, Caliph Ali reported that (Muhammad and Abu Bakr ordered 40 lashes, Umar 80) — &quot;All this is sunna&quot;;
*Umar&#x27;s deathbed instructions on where Muslims should seek guidance: from the Qur&#x27;an, the early Muslims (&quot;muhajirun&quot;) who emigrated to Medina with Muhammad, the Medina residents who welcomed and supported the &quot;muhajirun&quot; (the &quot;ansar&quot;), the people of the desert, and the protected communities of Jews and Christians (&quot;ahl al-dhimma&quot;); hadith of Muhammad are not mentioned.

According to historians (particularly Daniel W. Brown), the classical Islamic definition of sunnah as the customs and practices of Muhammad (only) was not the original one.

In al-Ṭabarī&#x27;s history of early Islam, the term &quot;Sunnah of the Prophet&quot; is not only used &quot;surprisingly infrequently&quot;, but used to refer to &quot;political oaths or slogans used by rebels&quot;, or &quot;a general standard of justice and right conduct&quot;, and not &quot;to specific precedents set by Muhammad&quot;, let alone hadith. An early theological writing by Hasan al-Basri (&quot;Risala fi&#x27;l Qadar&quot;) also is &quot;empty of references to specific cases&quot; when mentioning &quot;Sunnah of the Prophet&quot;.
Daniel Brown states that the first extant writings of Islamic legal reasoning were &quot;virtually hadith-free&quot; and argues that other examples of a lack of connection between sunnah and hadith can be found in:
*&quot;Kitāb al-Irjāʾ&quot; of al-Hasan b. Muhammad b. al-Hanafiyya; 
*the first letter of Abdallah ibn Ibad to Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan;
*and the &quot;Risāla&quot; of Abu Hanifa addressed to ʿUthman al-Battī&quot;.

According to one source (Ahmad Kazemi Moussavi and Karim Douglas Crow), early Sunni scholars often considered sunnah equivalent to the biography of Muhammed (&quot;sira&quot;). As the hadith came to be better documented and the scholars who validated them gained prestige, the sunnah came often to be known mostly through the hadith, especially as variant or fictional biographies of Muhammad spread.

===Four Madhhabs===

The golden age, starting with the creation of the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i, Hanbali, and other schools of fiqh in the second century of Islam, limited sunnah to &quot;traditions traced back to the Prophet Muhammad himself&quot; (&quot;sunna al-nabawiyyah&quot;). The ancient regional schools of law, located in several major cities of the new Arab empire of Islam, including Mecca, Kufa, Basra, and Syria, had a more flexible definition of sunnah than is now commonly used. This being the &quot;acceptable norms&quot; or &quot;custom&quot;, which included examples of Muhammad&#x27;s companions, the rulings of the Caliphs, and practices that &quot;had gained general acceptance among the jurists of that school&quot;.

Abū ʿAbdullāh Muhammad ibn Idrīs al-Shāfiʿī (150–204 AH), known as al-Shafi&#x27;i, argued against flexible sunnah and the use of precedents from multiple sources, emphasizing the final authority of a hadith of Muhammad, so that even the Qur&#x27;an was &quot;to be interpreted in the light of traditions (i.e. hadith), and not vice versa&quot;. While the sunnah has often been called &quot;second to the Quran&quot;, hadith has also been said to &quot;rule over and interpret the Quran&quot;.
Al-Shafiʿi &quot;forcefully argued&quot; that the sunnah stands &quot;on equal footing with the Quran&quot; (according to scholar Daniel Brown), both being divine revelation. As Al-Shafi&#x27;i put it, &quot;the command of the Prophet is the command of God&quot; This, though, contradicts another point Shafi made, which was the sunnah was below the Quran.

Sunnah of Muhammad outranked all other, and &quot;broad agreement&quot; developed that &quot;hadith must be the basis for authentication of any sunnah&quot;, (according to M. O. Farooq). Al-Shafiʿi&#x27;s success was such that later writers &quot;hardly ever thought of sunnah as comprising anything but that of the Prophet&quot;.

===Systemization of hadith===

While the earliest Muslim lawyers &quot;felt no obligation&quot; to provide documentation of hadith when arguing their case, and the sunnah was not recorded and written during Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime, (according to scholar Khaled Abou El Fadl), all this changed with the triumph of al-Shafi&#x27;i and a &quot;broad agreement&quot; that hadith should be used to authenticate sunnah (according to M. O. Farooq), over the course of the second century, when legal works began incorporating Prophetic hadith.

Hadith was now systematically collected and documented, but several generations having passed since the time of its occurrence meant that &quot;many of the reports attributed to the Prophet are apocryphal or at least are of dubious historical authenticity&quot; (according to Abou El Fadl). &quot;In fact, one of the most complex disciplines in Islamic jurisprudence is one which attempts to differentiate between authentic and inauthentic traditions.&quot;

===Classical Islam===

Islam jurists divide sunnah into that which has no legal consequences – &quot;al-sunna al-ʿādīyah&quot; (the &quot;personal habits and preferences&quot; of Muhammad); and that which is binding on Muslims – &quot;al-sunna al-hudā&quot;. The literalist Zāhirī school disagrees holding that there was no sunnah whose fulfillment is not rewarded or neglect punished, while classical Islam holds that following non-binding &quot;al-sunna al-ʿādīyah&quot; is meritorious but not obligatory.

Sufis see the &quot;division between binding and non-binding&quot; sunnah as &quot;meaningless&quot;. Muhammad is &quot;al-insān al-kāmil&quot;, the perfect man, &quot;labib-Allah&quot; beloved of God, an intercessor, a &quot;channel of divine light&quot;. Imitating his every action is &quot;the ultimate expression&quot; of piety. or in the words of Al-Ghazālī: 
===Modernist Islam===
In the 19th century, &quot;social and political turmoil&quot; starting with the decline of the Mughal Empire, caused some Muslims to seek a more humanized figure of Muhammad. The miracle-performing &quot;larger than life&quot; prophetic figure was de-emphasized in favor of &quot;a practical model for restoration of the Muslim community&quot;, a virtuous, progressive social reformer. Nasserist Egypt, for example, celebrated the &quot;imam of socialism&quot; rather than the cosmic &quot;perfect man&quot;. One who argued against the idea of sunnah as divine revelation, and for the idea that Muhammad&#x27;s mission was simply to transmit the Quran was Ghulam Ahmed Perwez (1903–1985). He quoted the Quranic verse &quot;The messenger has no duty except to proclaim [the message]&quot; (Q.5:99), and pointed out several other verses where God corrects something Muhammad has done or said (8:67), (9:43), (66:1), thus demonstrating Muhammad&#x27;s lack of supernatural knowledge.

This era of rapid social and technological change, decline of Muslim power, and replacement of classical madhhab by Western-inspired legal codes in Muslim lands, also suggested a turn away from the &quot;detailed precedents in civil and political affairs&quot;, called for by traditional hadith, &quot;for if worldly matters require detailed prophetic guidance, then every age will require a new prophet to accommodate changing circumstances&quot;.

===Islamic revivalism===
With de-colonialization in the late 20th century, a new Islamic revival emerged. Activists rather than theorists, they sought &quot;to restore Islam to ascendency&quot;, and in particular to restore Sharia to the law of the lands of Islam it had been before being replaced by &quot;secular, Western-inspired law codes&quot; of colonialism and modernity. Like modernists, revivalists &quot;vehemently rejected&quot; &quot;taqlid&quot; and were not particularly interested in the classical schools of law (&quot;madhhab&quot;). But revivalists like Abul A&#x27;la Maududi and Mustafa al-Siba&#x27;i support for &quot;the authority of sunnah and the authenticity of hadith in general&quot; was &quot;unwavering&quot;, as was their opposition to &quot;Hadith denialism&quot;. At the same time they agreed that restoring relevant Sharia required &quot;some reformulation&quot; of the law, which would require a return to sources, which required agreement on how the sources were to be &quot;interpreted and understand&quot; and reassessment of hadith. This involved examining hadith content (&quot;matn&quot;) for its spirit and relevance &quot;within the context of the Sharia as a whole&quot; according to the method of scholars of Islamic law (&quot;fuqaha&quot;) and weeding out corrupted hadith inconsistent with &quot;reason, with human nature, and with historical conditions&quot;. Shibli Nomani, Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, Rashid Rida, and Mohammed al-Ghazali being proponents of this effort.

==Alternatives to classical hadith based sunnah==
Although &quot;most writers agree&quot;, including skeptics, that &quot;sunnah and hadith must stand or fall together&quot;, some (Fazlur Rahman Malik, Javed Ahmad Ghamidi) have attempted to &quot;establish a basis for sunnah independent of hadith&quot;, working around problem of hadith authenticity raised by modernist and Western critics, while reaching back to pre-al-Shafiʿi meaning of sunnah.

===&quot;Living sunnah&quot;===
In the 1960s, Fazlur Rahman Malik, an Islamic modernist and former head of Pakistan&#x27;s Central Institute for Islamic Research, advanced another idea for how the (prophetic) sunnah—the normative example of Muhammad—should be understood: as &quot;a general umbrella concept&quot; but not one &quot;filled with absolutely specific content&quot;, or that was static over the centuries. He argued that Muhammad had come as a &quot;moral reformer&quot; and not a &quot;pan-legit&quot;, and that the specifics of the sunnah would be agreed upon community of his followers, evolving with changing times as a &quot;living and on-going process&quot;. He accepted the criticism of Western and Muslim scholars that the content of many hadith and isnad (chain of transmitters) had been tampered with by Muslims trying to prove the Muhammad had made a specific statement—but this did not make them fraudulent or forgeries, because if &quot;Hadith verbally speaking does not go back to the Prophet, its spirit certainly does&quot;. Instead these collections of ahadith of al-Bukhari and al-Muslim&#x27;s were &quot;ijma&quot; (consensus or agreement of the Muslim scholars—which is another classical source of Islamic law). Doing so, they follow the spirit of Muhammad&#x27;s mission, and &quot;resurrect&quot; the legal methodology of the pre-Shafi&#x27;i &quot;Ancient schools&quot;. But just as second and third century Muslims could re-formulate hadith and law around a prophetic spirit, so can modern Muslims—redefining &quot;riba&quot; and replacing medieval laws against bank interest with measures that help the poor without harming economic productivity.

===Sunnah from practice not hadith===
Some of the most basic and important features of the sunnah – worship rituals like &quot;salat&quot; (ritual prayer), &quot;zakat&quot; (ritual tithing), &quot;hajj&quot; (pilgrimage to Mecca), &quot;sawm&quot; (dawn to dusk fasting during Ramadan) – are known to Muslim from being passed down &#x27;from the many to the many&#x27; (according to scholars of fiqh such as Al-Shafi&#x27;i), bypassing books of hadith, (which were more often consulted for answers to details not agreed upon or not frequently practiced) and issues of authenticity.

Modernist Rashid Rida thought this &quot;the only source of sunnah that is beyond dispute&quot;. S.M. Yusuf argued &quot;practice is best transmitted through practice&quot;, and a more reliable way to establish sunnah than hadith. He also believed that the passing down of practice from generation to generation independent of hadith explained why early schools of law did not differentiate between sunnah of the caliphate and sunnah of the prophet.
According to Javed Ahmad Ghamidi, another Modernist, this passing down by continuous practice of the Muslim community (which also indicates consensus, &quot;ijma&quot;) was similar to how the Qur’ān has been &quot;received by the &quot;ummah&quot;&quot; (Muslim community) through the consensus of the Muhammad&#x27;s companions and through their perpetual recitation. Consequently, Ghamidi sees this more limited sunnah of continuous practice as the true sunnah – equally authentic to the Quran, but shedding orthodox sunnah and avoiding problematic basis of the hadith.

===&quot;Inner states&quot;===
Sufi thinkers &quot;emphasized personal spirituality and piety rather than the details of fiqh&quot;.
According to the view of some Sufi Muslims who incorporate both the outer and inner reality of Muhammad, the deeper and true sunnah are the noble characteristics and inner state of Muhammad – &quot;Khuluqin Azim&quot; or &quot;Exalted Character&quot;. To them Muhammad&#x27;s attitude, his piety, the quality of his character constitute the truer and deeper aspect of what it means by sunnah in Islam, rather than the external aspects alone. They argue that the external custom of Muhammad loses its meaning without the inner attitude and also many hadiths are simply custom of the Arabs, not something that is unique to Muhammad.

==Basis of importance==
The Qur&#x27;an contains numerous commands to follow Muhammad. Among the Quranic verses quoted as demonstrating the importance of hadith/sunnah to Muslims are:
Which appears in several verses: , , , 



The teachings of &quot;wisdom&quot; (&quot;hikma&quot;) have been declared to be a function of Muhammad along with the teachings of the scripture. Several Quranic verses mention &quot;wisdom&quot; (&quot;hikmah&quot;) coupled with &quot;scripture&quot; or &quot;the book&quot; (i.e. the Quran) – &quot;al-kitāb wa al-ḥikma&quot;. Mainstream scholars starting with al-Shafi&#x27;i believe &quot;hikma&quot; refers to the sunnah, and this connection between sunnah and the Quran is evidence of the sunnah&#x27;s divinity and authority.
* – &quot;For Allah hath sent down to thee the Book and wisdom and taught thee what thou Knewest not (before): and great is the Grace of Allah unto thee.&quot; 
* – &quot;...but remember Allah&#x27;s grace upon you and that which He hath revealed unto you of the Scripture and of wisdom, whereby He doth exhort you.&quot; 
* – &quot;And bear in mind which is recited in your houses of the revelations of God and of wisdom.&quot;

Therefore, along with the Quran, the &quot;sunnah&quot; was revealed. Modern Sunni scholars have examined both the &quot;sira&quot; and the &quot;hadith&quot; in order to justify modifications to jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;). Hense, the imitation of Muhammad helps Muslims to know and be loved by God.

Another piece of evidence for the divinity of the Sunnah—according to its supporters—are verses in the Quran that refer to revelations not found &quot;in&quot; the Quran. For example, there is no verse mentioning the original direction of prayer (the &quot;qibla&quot;) in the Quran, but God in the Quran does say He appointed the original qibla (). Other events mentioned in the Quran that already happened without Quranic command or description include a dream in which Muhammad would enter Mecca (); Muhammad&#x27;s marriage to Zayd&#x27;s ex-wife (); and the dispute over the division of spoils after the Battle of Badr ; all &quot;definitive proof that besides the Quran other commands came to the Prophet by the agency of waḥy&quot;, according to revivalist Abul A&#x27;la Maududi.
Yet another piece of evidence offered is that &quot;Prophet witness&quot; is &quot;the chief guarantee&quot; of what is divine revelation. In other words, &quot;Muslims only know the Quran is revelation because of Muhammad&#x27;s testimony to this fact. If prophetic word is not to be trusted, then the Quran itself is open to suspicion.&quot; Since the Quran is not, the sunnah must be trustworthy.

===Alternative view===
The minority argument against the sunnah of Muhammad being divine revelation (&quot;waḥy&quot;) goes back to the &quot;ahl al-Kalam&quot; who al-Shāfiʿī argued against in the second century of Islam. Their modern &quot;Quranists&quot;, the modern successors of the &quot;ahl al-Kalam&quot;, argue that the sunnah falls short of the standard of the Quran in divinity. Specifically because
#with the exception of the &quot;ḥadīth qudsī&quot;, sunnah was not revealed and transmitted verbatim, as was the Quran; it was often transmitted giving the sense or gist of what was said (known as &quot;bi&#x27;l-maʿnā&quot;);
#the process of revelation was not &quot;external, entirely independent of the influence of the messenger&quot;; it bares the &quot;personality&quot; or &quot;mentality&quot; (&quot;baṣīrat&quot;) of Muhammad;
#unlike the Quran, it was not &quot;preserved in writing&quot; until over a century after Muhammad&#x27;s death, which opens the question of how much corruption and/or error entered the writings and why, if it was divinely revealed, eternal truth, orders were not given to the earliest Muslims to write it down as they were for the Quran.

===Providing examples===
According to John Burton, paraphrasing Al-Shafi&#x27;i, &quot;it must be remembered that the Quran text are couched in very general terms which it is the function of the sunnah to expand and elucidate, to make God&#x27;s meaning absolutely clear.&quot;
There are a number of verses in the Quran where &quot;to understand the context, as well as the meaning&quot;, Muslims need to refer to the record of the life and example of Muhammad.

It is thought that verses 16:44 and 64 indicate that Muhammed&#x27;s mission &quot;is not merely that of a deliveryman who simply delivers the revelation from Allah to us, rather, he has been entrusted with the most important task of explaining and illustrating&quot; the Quran.

For example, while the Quran presents the general principles of praying, fasting, paying zakat, or making pilgrimage, they are presented &quot;without the illustration found in Hadith, for these acts of worship remain as abstract imperatives in the Qur&#x27;an&quot;.

==Types of sunnah==
Sunnah upon which &quot;fiqh&quot; is based may be divided into:
* &quot;Sunnah Qawliyyah&quot; – the sayings of Muhammad, generally synonymous with &quot;hadith&quot;, since the sayings of Muhammad are noted down by the companions and called &quot;hadith&quot;.
* &quot;Sunnah Fiiliyyah&quot; – the actions of Muhammad, including both religious and worldly actions.
* &quot;Sunnah Taqririyyah&quot; – the approvals of Muhammad regarding the actions of the Companions which occurred in two different ways:
** When Muhammad kept silent for an action and did not oppose it.
** When Muhammad showed his pleasure and smiled for a companion&#x27;s action.

It may be also divided into sunnah that is binding for Muslims and that which is not. Ibn Qutaybah (213-276 AH) distinguished between:
#sunnah &quot;brought by Gabriel&quot;; 
#sunnah from &quot;Muhammad&#x27;s own ra&#x27;y and is binding, but subject to revision&quot;;
#&quot;non-binding sunnah&quot;, which Muslims are not subject to &quot;penalty for failure to follow&quot;.
In the terminology of &quot;fiqh&quot; (Islamic jurisprudence), sunnah denotes whatever though not obligatory, is &quot;firmly established (&quot;thabata&quot;) as called for (&quot;matlub&quot;)&quot; in Islam &quot;on the basis of a legal proof (&quot;dalîl shar`î&quot;).

===Sciences of sunnah===

According to scholar Gibril Fouad Haddad, the &quot;sciences of the Sunnah&quot; (&quot;&#x27;ulûm as-Sunna&quot;) refer to:
== In Shia community ==
Shia Muslims do not follow the &quot;Kutub al-Sittah&quot; (six major hadith collections) followed in Sunni Islam, therefore in Shia and Sunni Islam, the sunnah refer to different collections of religious canonical literature.

The primary collections of Shia community were written by three authors known as the &quot;Three Muhammads&quot;, and they are:

*&quot;Kitab al-Kafi&quot; by Muhammad ibn Ya&#x27;qub al-Kulayni al-Razi (329 AH);
*&quot;Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih&quot; by Ibn Babawayh and &quot;Tahdhib al-Ahkam&quot;; and
*&quot;Al-Istibsar&quot;, both by Shaykh Tusi.

Unlike Akhbari Twelver Shiites, Usuli Twelver Shiite scholars do not believe that everything in the four major books of the Shia is authentic.

In Shia &quot;hadees&quot; one often finds sermons attributed to Ali in The Four Books or in the Nahj al-Balagha.

<doc id="28845" wikidata="Q318529" url="?curid=28845" title="Safe sex">
<text>Safe sex is sexual activity using methods or contraceptive devices (such as condoms) to reduce the risk of transmitting or acquiring sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especially HIV. &quot;Safe sex&quot; is also sometimes referred to as safer sex or protected sex to indicate that some safe sex practices do not eliminate STI risks. It is also sometimes used colloquially to describe methods aimed at preventing pregnancy that may or may not also lower STI risks.

The concept of &quot;safe sex&quot; emerged in the 1980s as a response to the global AIDS epidemic, and possibly more specifically to the AIDS crisis in the United States. Promoting safe sex is now one of the main aims of sex education and STI prevention, especially reducing new HIV infections. Safe sex is regarded as a harm reduction strategy aimed at reducing the risk of STI transmission.

Although some safe sex practices (like condoms) can also be used as birth control (&quot;contraception&quot;), most forms of contraception do not protect against STIs. Likewise, some safe sex practices, such as partner selection and low-risk sex behavior, might not be effective forms of contraception.

==History==

Although strategies for avoiding STIs like syphilis and gonorrhea have existed for centuries and the term &quot;safe sex&quot; existed in English as early as the 1930s, the use of the term to refer to STI-risk reduction dates to the mid-1980s in the United States. It emerged in response to the HIV/AIDS crisis.

A year before the HIV virus was isolated and named, the San Francisco chapter of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence published a small pamphlet titled &quot;Play Fair!&quot; out of concern over widespread STIs among the city&#x27;s gay male population. It specifically named illnesses (Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma and pneumocystis pneumonia) that would later be understood as symptoms of advanced HIV disease (or AIDS). The pamphlet advocated a range of safe-sex practices, including abstinence, condoms, personal hygiene, use of personal lubricants, and STI testing/treatment. It took a casual, sex-positive approach while also emphasizing personal and social responsibility. In May 1983—the same month HIV was isolated and named in France—the New York City-based HIV/AIDS activists Richard Berkowitz and Michael Callen published similar advice in their booklet, &quot;How to Have Sex in an Epidemic: One Approach&quot;. Both publications included recommendations that are now standard advice for reducing STI (including HIV) risks.

Safe sex as a form of STI risk reduction appeared in journalism as early as 1984, in the British publication &quot;The Daily Intelligencer&quot;: &quot;The goal is to reach about 50 million people with messages about safe sex and AIDS education.&quot;

Although &quot;safe sex&quot; is used by individuals to refer to protection against both pregnancy and HIV/AIDS or other STI transmissions, the term was born in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It is believed that the term &quot;safe sex&quot; was used in the professional literature in 1984, in the content of a paper on the psychological effect that HIV/AIDS may have on gay and bisexual men.
A year later, the same term appeared in an article in &quot;The New York Times.&quot; This article emphasized that most specialists advised their AIDS patients to practice safe sex. The concept included limiting the number of sexual partners, using prophylactics, avoiding bodily fluid exchange, and resisting the use of drugs that reduced inhibitions for high-risk sexual behavior. Moreover, in 1985, the first safe sex guidelines were established by the &#x27;Coalition for Sexual Responsibilities&#x27;. According to these guidelines, safe sex was practiced by using condoms also when engaging in anal or oral sex.

Although the term &quot;safe sex&quot; was primarily used in reference to sexual activity between men, in 1986 the concept was spread to the general population. Various programs were developed with the aim of promoting safe sex practices among college students. These programs were focused on promoting the use of the condom, a better knowledge about the partner&#x27;s sexual history and limiting the number of sexual partners. The first book on this subject appeared in the same year. The book was entitled &quot;Safe Sex in the Age of AIDS&quot;, and had 88 pages that described both positive and negative approaches to sexual life. Sexual behavior could be safe (kissing, hugging, massage, body-to-body rubbing, mutual masturbation, exhibitionism, phone sex, and use of separate sex toys); possibly safe (use of condoms); or unsafe.

In 1997, specialists in this matter promoted the use of condoms as the most accessible safe sex method (besides abstinence) and they called for TV commercials featuring condoms. During the same year, the Catholic Church in the United States issued their own &quot;safer sex&quot; guidelines on which condoms were listed, though two years later the Vatican urged chastity and heterosexual marriage, attacking the American Catholic bishops&#x27; guidelines.

A study carried out in 2006 by Californian specialists showed that the most common definitions of safe sex are condom use (68% of the interviewed subjects), abstinence (31.1% of the interviewed subjects), monogamy (28.4% of the interviewed subjects) and safe partner (18.7% of the interviewed subjects).

The term &quot;safer sex&quot; in Canada and the United States has gained greater use by health workers, reflecting that risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections in various sexual activities is a continuum. The term &quot;safe sex&quot; is still in common use in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.

&quot;Safer sex&quot; is thought to be a more aggressive term which may make it more obvious to individuals that any type of sexual activity carries a certain degree of risk.

The term &quot;safe love&quot; has also been used, notably by the French Sidaction in the promotion of men&#x27;s underpants incorporating a condom pocket and including the red ribbon symbol in the design, which were sold to support the charity.

==Practices==
A range of safe-sex practices are commonly recommended by Sexual Health Educators and Public Health Agencies. Many of these practices can reduce (but not eliminate) risk of transmitting or acquiring STIs.

===Phone sex/cybersex/sexting===
Sexual activities, such as phone sex, cybersex, and sexting, that do not include direct contact with the skin or bodily fluids of sexual partners, carry no STI risks and, thus, are forms of safe sex.

===Non-penetrative sex===

A range of sex acts called &quot;non-penetrative sex&quot; or &quot;outercourse&quot; can significantly reduce STI risks. Non-penetrative sex includes practices such as kissing, mutual masturbation, manual sex, rubbing or stroking. According to the Health Department of Western Australia, this sexual practice may prevent pregnancy and most STIs. However, non-penetrative sex may not protect against infections that can be transmitted via skin-to-skin contact, such as herpes and human papilloma virus. Mutual masturbation and manual sex carry some STI risk, especially if there is skin contact or shared bodily fluids with sexual partners, although the risks are significantly lower than many other sexual activities.

===Condoms, dental dams, gloves===

Barriers, such as condoms, dental dams, and medical gloves can prevent contact with body fluids (such as blood, vaginal fluid, semen, rectal mucus), and other means of transmitting STIs (like skin, hair and shared objects) during sexual activity.
* External condoms can be used to cover the penis, hands, fingers, or other body parts during sexual penetration or oral sex. They are most frequently made of latex, and can also be made out of synthetic materials including polyurethane and polyisoprene.
* Internal condoms (also called female condoms) are inserted into the vagina or anus prior to sexual penetration. These condoms are made of either polyurethane or nitrile. If external and internal condoms are used at the same time, they may break due to friction between the materials during sexual activity.
* A dental dam (originally used in dentistry) is a sheet of latex typically used for protection between the mouth and the vulva or anus when engaging in oral sex. 
* Medical gloves and finger cots made out of latex, vinyl, nitrile, or polyurethane can cover hands or fingers during manual sex or may be used as a makeshift dental dam during oral sex.
* Condoms, dental dams, and gloves can also be used to cover sex toys such as dildos during sexual stimulation or penetration. If a sex toy is to be used in more than one orifice or partner, a condom/dental dam/glove can be used over it and changed when the toy is moved.

Oil-based lubrication can break down the structure of latex condoms, dental dams or gloves, reducing their effectiveness for STI protection.

While use of external condoms can reduce STI risks during sexual activity, they are not 100% effective. One study has suggested condoms might reduce HIV transmission by 85% to 95%; effectiveness beyond 95% was deemed unlikely because of slippage, breakage, and incorrect use. It also said, &quot;In practice, inconsistent use may reduce the overall effectiveness of condoms to as low as 60–70%&quot;.p. 40.

===Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)===

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (often abbreviated as &quot;PrEP&quot;) is the use of prescription drugs by those who do not have HIV to prevent HIV infection. PrEP drugs are taken &quot;prior&quot; to HIV exposure to prevent the transmission of the virus, usually between sexual partners. PrEP drugs do not prevent other STI infections or pregnancy.

As of 2018, the most-widely approved form of &quot;PrEP&quot; combines two drugs (tenofovir and emtricitabine) in one pill. That drug combination is sold under the brand name Truvada by Gilead Sciences. It is also sold in generic formulations worldwide. Other drugs and modalities are being studied for use as PrEP.

Different countries have approved different protocols for using the tenofovir/emtricitabine-combination drug as &quot;PrEP&quot;. That two-drug combination has been shown to prevent HIV infection in different populations when taken daily, intermittently, and on demand. Numerous studies have found the tenofovir/emtricitabine combination to be over 90% effective at preventing HIV transmission between sexual partners. AVAC has developed a tool to track trends in PrEP uptake across the globe. 

===Treatment as prevention===

Treatment as Prevention (often abbreviated as &quot;TasP&quot;) is the practice of testing for and treating HIV infection as a way to prevent further spread of the virus. Those having knowledge of their HIV-positive status can use safe-sex practices to protect themselves and their partners (such as using condoms, sero-sorting partners, or choosing less-risky sexual activities). And, because HIV-positive people with durably suppressed or undetectable amounts of HIV in their blood &quot;cannot transmit HIV to sexual partners&quot;, sexual activity with HIV-positive partners on effective treatment is a form of safe sex (to prevent HIV infection). This fact has given rise to the concept of &quot;U=U&quot; (&quot;Undetectable = Untransmittable&quot;).

===Other forms of safe sex===
Other methods proven effective at reducing STI risks during sexual activity are:
* Immunization against certain sexually-transmitted viruses. The most common vaccines protect against hepatitis B and human papilloma virus (HPV), which can cause cervical cancer, penile cancer, oral cancer, and genital warts. Immunization before initiation of sexual activity increases effectiveness of these vaccines. HPV vaccines are recommended for all teen girls and women as well as teen boys and men through age 26 and 21 respectively.
* Limiting numbers of sexual partners, particularly casual sexual partners, or restricting sexual activity to those who know and share their STI status, can also reduce STI risks. Monogamy or polyfidelity, practiced faithfully, is very safe (as far as STIs are concerned) when all partners are non-infected. However, many monogamous people have been infected with sexually transmitted infections by partners who are sexually unfaithful, have used injection drugs, or were infected by previous sexual partners. The same risks apply to polyfidelitous people, who face higher risks depending on how many people are in the polyfidelitous group.
* Communication with sexual partners about sexual history and STI status, preferred safe sex practices, and acceptable risks for partnered sexual activities.
* Engaging in less-risky sexual activities. In general, solo sexual activities are less risky than partnered activities. Sexual penetration of orifices (mouth, vagina, anus) and sharing body fluids (such as semen, blood, vaginal fluids, and rectal mucus) between sexual partners carry the most risk for STIs.
* Regular STI testing and treatment, especially by those who are sexually active with more than one casual sexual partner. It is possible to attain and show proof of STD-free-verification through online dating apps and websites.
* Penile circumcision. Some research suggests that circumcising (removing) the foreskin of the penis can reduce the risk of contracting HIV. Some advocacy groups dispute these findings.

==Ineffective methods==
Most methods of contraception are not effective at preventing the spread of STIs. This includes birth control pills, vasectomy, tubal ligation, periodic abstinence, IUDs and many non-barrier methods of pregnancy prevention. However, condoms, when used correctly, significantly reduces the risks of STI transmission and unwanted pregnancy.

The spermicide nonoxynol-9 has been claimed to reduce the likelihood of STI transmission. However, a technical report from 2001 by the World Health Organization has shown that nonoxynol-9 is an irritant and can produce tiny tears in mucous membranes, which may increase the risk of transmission by offering pathogens more easy points of entry into the system. They reported that nonoxynol-9 lubricant do not have enough spermicide to increase contraceptive effectiveness cautioned they should not be promoted. There is no evidence that spermicidal condoms are better at preventing STD transmission compared to condoms that do not have spermicide. If used properly, spermicidal condoms can prevent pregnancy, but there is still an increased risk that nonoxynyl-9 can irritate the skin, making it more susceptible for infections.

The use of a diaphragm or contraceptive sponge provides some women with better protection against certain sexually transmitted infections, but they are not effective for all STIs.

Hormonal methods of preventing pregnancy (such as oral contraceptives [i.e. &#x27;The pill&#x27;], depoprogesterone, hormonal IUDs, the vaginal ring, and the patch) offer no protection against STIs. The copper intrauterine device and the hormonal intrauterine device provide an up to 99% protection against pregnancies but no protection against STIs. Women with copper intrauterine device &quot;may&quot; be subject to greater risk of infection from bacterial infectious such as gonorrhea or chlamydia, although this is debated.

Coitus interruptus (or &quot;pulling out&quot;), in which the penis is removed from the vagina or mouth before ejaculation, may reduce transmission of STIs but still carries significant risk. This is because pre-ejaculate, a fluid that oozes from the penile urethra before ejaculation, may contain STI pathogens. Additionally, the microbes responsible for some diseases, including genital warts and syphilis, can be transmitted through skin-to-skin or mucous membrane contact.

==Anal sex==
Unprotected anal penetration is considered a high-risk sexual activity because the thin tissues of the anus and rectum can be easily damaged. Slight injuries can allow the passage of bacteria and viruses, including HIV. This includes penetration of the anus by fingers, hands, or sex toys such as dildos. Also, condoms may be more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex, increasing the risk of STI transmission.

The main risk that individuals are exposed to when performing anal sex is the transmission of HIV. Other possible infections include hepatitis A, B and C; intestinal parasite infections like &quot;Giardia&quot;; and bacterial infections such as &quot;Escherichia coli.&quot;

Anal sex should be avoided by couples in which one of the partners has been diagnosed with an STI until the treatment has proven to be effective.

In order to make anal sex safer, the couple must ensure that the anal area is clean and the bowel empty and the partner on whom anal penetration occurs should be able to relax. Regardless of whether anal penetration occurs by using a finger or the penis, the condom is the best barrier method to prevent transmission of STI. Enemas should not be used as they can increase the risk of HIV infection and lymphogranuloma venereum proctitis.

Since the rectum can be easily damaged, the use of lubricants is highly recommended even when penetration occurs by using the finger. Especially for beginners, using a condom on the finger is both a protection measure against STI and a lubricant source. Most condoms are lubricated and they allow less painful and easier penetration. Oil-based lubricants damage latex and should not be used with condoms; water-based and silicone-based lubricants are available instead. Non-latex condoms are available for people who are allergic to latex made out of polyurethane or polyisoprene. Polyurethane condoms can safely be used with oil-based lubricant. The &quot;female condom&quot; may also be used effectively by the anal receiving partner.

Anal stimulation with a sex toy requires similar safety measures to anal penetration with a penis, in this case using a condom on the sex toy in a similar way.

It is important that the man washes and cleans his penis after anal intercourse if he intends to penetrate the vagina. Bacteria from the rectum are easily transferred to the vagina, which may cause vaginal and urinary tract infections.

When anal–oral contact occurs, protection is required since this is a risky sexual behavior in which illnesses such as hepatitis A or STIs can be easily transmitted, as well as enteric infections. The dental dam or plastic wrap are effective protection means whenever anilingus is performed.

==Sex toys==

Putting a condom on a sex toy provides better sexual hygiene and can help to prevent transmission of infections if the sex toy is shared, provided the condom is replaced when used by a different partner. Some sex toys are made of porous materials, and pores retain viruses and bacteria, which makes it necessary to clean sex toys thoroughly, preferably with use of cleaners specifically for sex toys. Glass is non-porous and medical grade glass sex toys more easily sterilized between uses.

In cases in which one of the partners is treated for an STI, it is recommended that the couple not use sex toys until the treatment has proved to be effective.

All sex toys have to be properly cleaned after use. The way in which a sex toy is cleaned varies on the type of material it is made of. Some sex toys can be boiled or cleaned in a dishwasher. Most of the sex toys come with advice on the best way to clean and store them and these instructions should be carefully followed. A sex toy should be cleaned not only when it is shared with other individuals but also when it is used on different parts of the body (such as mouth, vagina or anus).

A sex toy should regularly be checked for scratches or breaks that can be breeding ground for bacteria. It is best if the damaged sex toy is replaced by a new undamaged one. Even more hygiene protection should be considered by pregnant women when using sex toys. Sharing any type of sex toy that may draw blood, like whips or needles, is not recommended, and is not safe.

When using sex toys in the anus, sex toys &quot;...can easily get lost&quot; as &quot;rectal muscles contract and can suck an object up and up, potentially obstructing the colon&quot;; to prevent this serious problem, sex toy users are advised to use sex &quot;...toys with a flared base or a string&quot;.

==Abstinence==
Sexual abstinence reduces STIs and pregnancy risks associated with sexual contact, but STIs may also be transmitted through non-sexual means, or by rape. HIV may be transmitted through contaminated needles used in tattooing, body piercing, or injections. Medical or dental procedures using contaminated instruments can also spread HIV, while some health-care workers have acquired HIV through occupational exposure to accidental injuries with needles. Evidence does not support the use of abstinence-only sex education. Abstinence-only sex education programs have been found to be ineffective in decreasing rates of HIV infection in the developed world and unplanned pregnancy. Abstinence-only sex education primarily relies on the consequences of character and morality while health care professionals are concerned about matters regarding health outcomes and behaviors. Though abstinence is the best course to prevent pregnancy and STIs, in reality, it leaves young people without the information and skills they need to avoid unwanted pregnancies and STIs.
