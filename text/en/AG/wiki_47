<text>The Band was a Canadian-American rock band formed in Toronto, Ontario, in 1957. It consisted of the Canadians Rick Danko (bass, guitar, vocals, fiddle), Garth Hudson (organ, keyboards, accordion, saxophone), Richard Manuel (piano, drums, vocals) and Robbie Robertson (guitar, piano, percussion) and the American Levon Helm (drums, vocals, mandolin, guitar, bass). The Band&#x27;s music combined elements of Americana, folk, rock, jazz and country, which influenced artists including George Harrison, Elton John, the Grateful Dead, Eric Clapton, and Wilco.

Between 1958 and 1963, the group was known as the Hawks and were the backing band for rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins. In the mid-1960s, they gained recognition for backing Bob Dylan on his 1966 concert tour as Dylan&#x27;s first electric band. After leaving Dylan and changing their name to the Band, they released their 1968 debut &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; and its succeeding album, 1969&#x27;s &quot;The Band&quot; to critical acclaim and commercial success. According to AllMusic, &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; influenced several generations of musicians. Pink Floyd member Roger Waters deemed it the &quot;second-most influential record in the history of rock and roll&quot;, and music journalist Al Aronowitz called it &quot;country soul ... a sound never heard before&quot;. Their most popular songs included &quot;The Weight&quot; (1968), &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot; (1969), and &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot; (1969).

The Band performed their farewell concert on November 25, 1976. Footage from the event was released in 1978 as the concert film &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, directed by Martin Scorsese. It would be the last performance of the original five members. After five years apart, Danko, Hudson, Helm, and Manuel reunited in 1983 for a tour without Robertson, who had taken up a new career as a producer and composer for film soundtracks. Manuel died in 1986, but the remaining three members continued to tour and occasionally released new albums of studio material until Danko&#x27;s death in 1999, after which the remaining members broke up for good. Helm would go on to have a successful solo career, winning multiple Grammy Awards in the folk and Americana categories until his 2012 death, while Hudson worked as a featured session musician. Robertson died in 2023 and Hudson in 2025. Jim Weider and Randy Ciarlante, who each joined the group at much later dates in the 1980s and 1990s, are the only surviving members of The Band. 

Music critic Bruce Eder described The Band as &quot;one of the most popular and influential rock groups in the world, their music embraced by critics ... as seriously as the music of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.&quot; The Band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked them 50th on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;, and ranked &quot;The Weight&quot; 41st on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2008, the group received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and in 2014, were inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

==History==
===1957–1964: The Hawks===

The future members of The Band first played together as the Hawks, the backing group for Toronto-based rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins. Levon Helm began playing with the group in 1957, then became their fulltime drummer after graduating from high school in 1958. Helm journeyed with Hawkins from Arkansas to Ontario, where they were joined by Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, and finally Garth Hudson. Latter-day Band member Stan Szelest was also in the group at that time. Hawkins&#x27;s act was popular in and around Toronto and nearby Hamilton, and he had an effective way of eliminating his musical competition: when a promising band appeared, Hawkins would hire their best musicians for his own group; Robertson, Danko, and Manuel came under Hawkins&#x27;s tutelage this way.

While most of the Hawks were eager to join Hawkins&#x27;s group, getting Hudson to join was more difficult. Having earned a college degree, Hudson planned on a career as a music teacher, and was only interested in playing rock music as a hobby. The Hawks admired his wild, full-bore organ style and asked him repeatedly to join. Hudson finally agreed, under the condition that the Hawks each pay him $10 per week to be their instructor and purchase a new state-of-the-art Lowrey organ; all music theory questions were directed to Hudson.

With Hawkins, they recorded a few singles in this period and became well known as the best rock group in the thriving Toronto music scene. Hawkins regularly convened all-night rehearsals following long club shows, with the result that the young musicians quickly developed their instrumental skills.

In late 1963, the group split from Hawkins over personal differences. They had grown tired of playing the same songs so often and wanted to perform original material, and they were also wary of Hawkins&#x27;s heavy-handed leadership. He would fine the Hawks if they brought their girlfriends to the clubs (fearing it might reduce the numbers of &quot;available&quot; girls who came to performances) or if they smoked marijuana.

Robertson later said, &quot;Eventually, [Hawkins] built us up to the point where we outgrew his music and had to leave. He shot himself in the foot, really, by sharpening us into such a crackerjack band that we had to go on out into the world, because we knew what his vision was for himself, and we were all younger and more ambitious musically.&quot;

Upon leaving Hawkins, the group was briefly known as the Levon Helm Sextet, with a sixth member, saxophonist Jerry Penfound, and then as Levon and the Hawks after Penfound&#x27;s departure. In 1965, they released a single on Ware Records under the name the Canadian Squires, but they returned as Levon and the Hawks for a recording session for Atco later that year. Also in 1965, Helm and the band met blues singer and harmonica player Sonny Boy Williamson. They wanted to record with him, offering to become his backing band, but Williamson died not long after their meeting.

Later in 1965, American musician Bob Dylan hired the group as his backing band for his U.S. tour in 1965 and world tour in 1966. Following the 1966 tour, the group moved with help from Dylan and his manager, Albert Grossman, to Saugerties, New York, where they made the informal 1967 recordings that became &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;, the basis for their 1968 debut album, &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;. Because they were always referred to simply as &quot;the band&quot; to various frontmen and the locals in Woodstock, Helm said the name &quot;The Band&quot; worked well when the group came into its own. The group decided on it as their official name and began performing under it from 1968 onward. Dylan continued to collaborate with The Band over the course of their career, most notably in a joint 1974 tour.

===1965–1967: With Bob Dylan===
In late summer 1965, Bob Dylan was looking for a backup band for his first U.S. &quot;electric&quot; tour. Levon and the Hawks were recommended by blues singer John P. Hammond, who earlier that year had recorded with Helm, Hudson and Robertson on his Vanguard album &quot;So Many Roads&quot;. Around the same time, one of their friends from Toronto, Mary Martin, was working as secretary to Dylan&#x27;s manager, Albert Grossman. She told Dylan to visit the group at Le Coq d&#x27;Or Tavern, a club on Yonge Street, in Toronto—though Robertson recollects it was the Friar&#x27;s Tavern, just down the street. Her advice to Dylan: &quot;You &quot;gotta&quot; see these guys.&quot;

After hearing The Band play and meeting with Robertson, Dylan invited Helm and Robertson to join his backing band. After two concerts backing Dylan, Helm and Robertson told Dylan of their loyalty to their bandmates and told him that they would continue with him only if he hired all of the Hawks. Dylan accepted and invited Levon and the Hawks to tour with him. The group was receptive to the offer, knowing it could give them the wider exposure they craved. They thought of themselves as a tightly rehearsed rock and rhythm and blues group and knew Dylan mostly from his early acoustic folk and protest music. Furthermore, they had little inkling of how internationally popular Dylan had become.

With Dylan, the Hawks played a series of concerts from September 1965 through May 1966, billed as &quot;Bob Dylan and the Band&quot;. The tours were marked by Dylan&#x27;s reportedly copious use of amphetamines. Some, though not all, of the Hawks joined in the excesses. Most of the concerts were met with heckling and disapproval from folk music purists. Helm was so affected by the negative reception that he left the tour after a little more than one month and sat out the rest of that year&#x27;s concerts, as well as the world tour in 1966. Helm spent much of this period working on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico.

During and between tours, Dylan and the Hawks attempted several recording sessions, but with less than satisfying results. Sessions in October and November yielded just one usable single (&quot;Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?&quot;), and two days of recording in January 1966 for what was intended to be Dylan&#x27;s next album, &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, resulted in &quot;One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)&quot;, which was released as a single a few weeks later and was subsequently selected for the album. On &quot;One of Us Must Know&quot;, Dylan was backed by drummer Bobby Gregg, bassist Danko (or Bill Lee), guitarist Robbie Robertson, pianist Paul Griffin, and Al Kooper (who was more a guitarist than an organist) playing organ. Frustrated by the slow progress in the New York studio, Dylan accepted the suggestion of producer Bob Johnston and moved the recording sessions to Nashville. In Nashville, Robertson&#x27;s guitar was prominent on the &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; recordings, especially in the song &quot;Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat&quot;, but the other members of the Hawks did not attend the sessions.

During the European leg of their 1966 world tour, Mickey Jones replaced Sandy Konikoff on drums. Dylan and the Hawks played at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester on May 17, 1966. The gig became legendary when, near the end of Dylan&#x27;s electric set, an audience member shouted &quot;Judas!&quot; After a pause, Dylan replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe you. You&#x27;re a liar!&quot; He then turned to the Hawks and said, &quot;Play it fucking loud!&quot; With that, they launched into an acidic version of &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;.

The Manchester performance was widely bootlegged (and mistakenly placed at the Royal Albert Hall). In a 1971 review for &quot;Creem&quot;, critic Dave Marsh wrote, &quot;My response is that crystallization of everything that is rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll music, at its finest, was to allow my jaw to drop, my body to move, to leap out of the chair ... It is an experience that one desires simply to share, to play over and over again for those he knows thirst for such pleasure. If I speak in an almost worshipful sense about this music, it is not because I have lost perspective, it is precisely because I have found it, within music, yes, that was made five years ago. But it is there and unignorable.&quot; When the concert finally saw an official release as &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The &quot;Royal Albert Hall&quot; Concert&quot; in 1998, critic Richie Unterberger declared the record &quot;an important document of rock history.&quot;

On July 29, 1966, while on a break from touring, Dylan was injured in a motorcycle accident that precipitated his retreat into semi-seclusion in Woodstock, New York. For a while, the Hawks returned to the bar and roadhouse touring circuit, sometimes backing other singers, including a brief stint with Tiny Tim. Dylan invited the Hawks to join him in Woodstock in February 1967, and Danko, Hudson, and Manuel rented a large pink house, which they named &quot;Big Pink&quot;, in nearby West Saugerties, New York. The next month (initially without Helm) they commenced recording a much-bootlegged and influential series of demos, initially at Dylan&#x27;s house in Woodstock and later at Big Pink, which were released partially on LP as &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot; in 1975 and in full in 2014. A track-by-track review of the bootleg was detailed by Jann Wenner in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, in which the band members were explicitly named and given the collective name &quot;the Crackers&quot;. While Helm was not involved in the initial recording, he did perform in later sessions and in overdubs recorded in 1975 before the album&#x27;s release.

===1968–1972: Initial success with &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; self-titled album===

The sessions with Dylan ended in October 1967, with Helm having rejoined the group by that time, and the Hawks began writing their own songs at Big Pink. When they went into the recording studio, they still did not have a name for themselves. Stories vary as to the manner in which they ultimately adopted the name &quot;The Band&quot;. In &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, Manuel claimed that they wanted to call themselves either &quot;the Honkies&quot; or &quot;the Crackers&quot; (which they used when backing Dylan for a January 1968 concert tribute to Woody Guthrie), but these names were vetoed by their record label; Robertson suggests that during their time with Dylan everyone just referred to them as &quot;the band&quot; and the name stuck. Initially they disliked the moniker, but eventually they grew to like it, thinking it both humble and presumptuous. In 1969, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; referred to them as &quot;the band from Big Pink&quot;.

Their debut album, &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; was released in July 1968 and was widely acclaimed. It included three songs written or co-written by Dylan (&quot;This Wheel&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, &quot;Tears of Rage&quot; and &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;) as well as &quot;The Weight&quot;, which became one of their best-known songs after it was used in the 1969 film &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. While a thematic continuity ran through the music, the musical style varied from song to song.
In early 1969, after the success of &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;, The Band went on tour, starting with an appearance at Winterland Ballroom. They performed at the Woodstock Festival (their performance was not included in the famed &quot;Woodstock&quot; film because of legal complications), and later that year they performed with Dylan at the UK Isle of Wight Festival (several songs from which were subsequently included on Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Self Portrait&quot; album). That same year, they left for Los Angeles to record their follow-up, &quot;The Band&quot; (1969). From their rustic appearance on the cover to the songs and arrangements within, the album stood in contrast to other popular music of the day. Several other artists had already made similar stylistic moves, notably Dylan, on &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; (1967), which was written during the &quot;Basement Tapes&quot; sessions, and the Byrds, on &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; (1968), which featured two &quot;Basement Tapes&quot; covers. &quot;The Band&quot; featured songs that evoked old-time rural America, from the Civil War in &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot; to the unionization of farm workers in &quot;King Harvest (Has Surely Come)&quot;.

These first two records were produced by John Simon, who was practically a group member: he aided in arrangements in addition to playing occasional piano and tuba. Simon reported that he was often asked about the distinctive horn sections featured so effectively on the first two albums: people wanted to know how they had achieved such memorable sounds. Simon stated that, besides Hudson (an accomplished saxophonist), the others had only rudimentary horn skills, and achieved their sound simply by creatively using their limited technique.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; lavished praise on The Band in this era, giving them more attention than perhaps any other group in the magazine&#x27;s history; Greil Marcus&#x27;s articles contributed to The Band&#x27;s mystique. The Band was also featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; (January 12, 1970), the first rock group after the Beatles, over two years earlier, to achieve this rare distinction. David Attie&#x27;s unused photographs for this cover—among the very few studio portraits taken during the Band&#x27;s prime—have only recently been discovered, and were featured in Daniel Roher&#x27;s Robbie Robertson documentary &quot;Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band&quot;, as well as having their own four-page spread in Harvey Kubernik and Ken Kubernik&#x27;s “The Story of the Band: From &quot;Big Pink&quot; to &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;” (Sterling Publishing, 2018).

A critical and commercial triumph, &quot;The Band&quot;, along with works by the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers, established a musical template (dubbed country rock) that paved the way to the Eagles. Both &quot;Big Pink&quot; and &quot;The Band&quot; also influenced their musical contemporaries. Eric Clapton and George Harrison cited The Band as a major influence on their musical direction in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Clapton later revealed that he wanted to join the group. While he never did join, he recruited all of the members of The Band as well as other roots rock performers for his 1976 album &quot;No Reason to Cry&quot;.

Following their second album, The Band embarked on their first tour as a lead act. The anxiety of fame was clear, as the group&#x27;s songs turned to darker themes of fear and alienation: the influence on their next work is self-explanatory. &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (1970) was engineered by musician-engineer-producer Todd Rundgren and recorded on stage at the iconic &quot;Woodstock Playhouse&quot;. As with their previous, self-titled record, Robertson was credited with most of the songwriting. Initial critical reaction was positive, but it was seen as a disappointment from the previous two albums for various reasons. After recording &quot;Stage Fright&quot;, The Band was among the acts participating in the Festival Express, an all-star rock concert tour of Canada by train that also included Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead and future Band member Richard Bell (at the time he was a member of Joplin&#x27;s band). In the concert documentary film, released in 2003, Danko can be seen participating in a drunken jam session with Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, John Dawson, and Joplin while singing &quot;Ain&#x27;t No More Cane&quot;.

At about this time, Robertson began exerting greater control over The Band, a point of contention between him and Helm. Helm charges Robertson with authoritarianism and greed, while Robertson suggests his increased efforts in guiding the group were largely because Danko, Helm, and Manuel were becoming more unreliable due to their heroin usage. Robertson insists he did his best to coax Manuel into writing more songs, only to see him descend into addiction.

Despite mounting problems among the group members, The Band forged ahead with their next album, &quot;Cahoots&quot; (1971). &quot;Cahoots&quot; featured Dylan&#x27;s &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot;, &quot;4% Pantomime&quot; (with Van Morrison), and &quot;Life Is a Carnival&quot;, the last featuring a horn arrangement by Allen Toussaint. Toussaint&#x27;s contribution was a critical addition to The Band&#x27;s next project, and the group would later record two songs written by Toussaint: &quot;Holy Cow&quot; on &quot;Moondog Matinee&quot; and &quot;You See Me&quot; on &quot;Jubilation&quot;. In late December 1971, The Band recorded the live album &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;, which was released in the summer of 1972. On &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;, they were bolstered by the addition of a horn section, with arrangements written by Toussaint. Dylan appeared on stage on New Year&#x27;s Eve and performed four songs with the group, including a version of &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot;.

===1973–1975: Move to Shangri-La===
In 1973, The Band released the covers album &quot;Moondog Matinee&quot;. There was no tour in support of the album, which garnered mixed reviews. However, on July 28, 1973, they played at Summer Jam at Watkins Glen, a massive concert that took place at the Grand Prix Raceway outside Watkins Glen, New York. The event, which was attended by over 600,000 fans, also featured the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers Band. It was during this event that discussions began about a possible tour with Bob Dylan. By late 1973, Danko, Helm, Hudson and Manuel had joined them, and the first order of business was backing Dylan on his album &quot;Planet Waves&quot;. The album was released concurrently with their joint 1974 tour, in which they played 40 shows in North America during January and February 1974. Later that year, the tour was documented on the live album &quot;Before the Flood&quot;.

During this time, The Band brought in &quot;Planet Waves&quot; producer Rob Fraboni to help design a music studio for the group. By 1975, the studio, Shangri-La, was completed. That year, The Band recorded and released &quot;Northern Lights – Southern Cross&quot;, their first album of new material since 1971. All eight songs were written solely by Robertson. Despite comparatively poor record sales, the album is favored by critics and fans. Levon Helm regards this album highly in his book, &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s on Fire&quot;: &quot;It was the best album we had done since &quot;The Band&quot;.&quot; The album also produced more experimentation from Hudson, switching to synthesizers, showcased on &quot;Jupiter Hollow&quot;.

===1976–1978: &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;===

By the mid-1970s, Robbie Robertson was weary of touring. After &quot;Northern Lights – Southern Cross&quot; failed to meet commercial expectations, much of the group&#x27;s 1976 tour was confined to theaters and smaller arenas in secondary markets (including the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, the Long Island Arena and the Champlain Valley Expo in Essex Junction, Vermont), culminating in an opening slot for the ascendant ZZ Top at the Nashville Fairgrounds in September. In early September, Richard Manuel suffered a severe neck injury in a boating accident in Texas, prompting Robertson to urge The Band to retire from live performances after staging a &quot;farewell concert&quot; known as &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;. Following an October 30 appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, the event, including turkey dinner for the audience of 5,000, was held on November 25 (Thanksgiving Day) of 1976 at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, California, and featured a horn section with arrangements by Allen Toussaint and an all-star lineup of guests, including Canadian artists Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. Two of the guests were fundamental to The Band&#x27;s existence and growth: Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan. Other guests they admired (and in most cases had worked with before) included Muddy Waters, Dr. John, Van Morrison, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Ron Wood, Bobby Charles, Neil Diamond, and Paul Butterfield. The concert was filmed by Robertson&#x27;s friend, filmmaker Martin Scorsese.

In 1977, The Band released their seventh studio album &quot;Islands&quot;, which fulfilled their record contract with Capitol so that a planned &quot;Last Waltz&quot; film and album could be released on the Warner Bros. label. &quot;Islands&quot; contained a mix of originals and covers, and was the last with The Band&#x27;s original lineup. That same year, the group recorded soundstage performances with country singer Emmylou Harris (&quot;Evangeline&quot;) and gospel-soul group the Staple Singers (&quot;The Weight&quot;); Scorsese combined these new performances—as well as interviews he had conducted with the group—with the 1976 concert footage. The resulting concert film–documentary was released in 1978, along with a three-LP soundtrack.

Helm later wrote about &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; in his autobiography, &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, in which he made the case that it had been primarily Robbie Robertson&#x27;s project and that Robertson had forced The Band&#x27;s breakup on the rest of the group. Robertson offered a different take in a 1986 interview: &quot;I made my big statement. I did the movie, I made a three-record album about it—and if this is only my statement, not theirs, I&#x27;ll accept that. They&#x27;re saying, &#x27;Well, that was really his trip, not our trip.&#x27; Well, fine. I&#x27;ll take the best music film that&#x27;s ever been made, and make it my statement. I don&#x27;t have any problems with that. None at all.&quot;

The original quintet would perform together one last time: on March 1, 1978 after the late set of a Rick Danko solo show at The Roxy, the group performed &quot;Stage Fright&quot;, &quot;The Shape I&#x27;m In&quot;, and &quot;The Weight&quot; for an encore. Although the members of the group intended to continue working on studio projects, they drifted apart after the release of &quot;Islands&quot; in March 1977.

===1983–1989: Reformation and the death of Richard Manuel===
The Band resumed touring in 1983 without Robertson. Accomplished musician from Woodstock, NY, Jim Weider became lead guitarist. Robertson had found success with a solo career and as a Hollywood music producer. As a result of their diminished popularity, they performed in theaters and clubs as headliners and took support slots in larger venues for onetime peers such as the Grateful Dead and Crosby, Stills and Nash.

After a performance in Winter Park, Florida, on March 4, 1986, Manuel hanged himself, aged 42, in his motel room. He had suffered for many years from alcoholism and drug addiction and had been clean and sober for several years beginning in 1978 but had begun drinking and using drugs again by 1984. Manuel&#x27;s position as pianist was filled by old friend Stan Szelest (who died not long after) and then by Richard Bell. Bell had played with Ronnie Hawkins after the departure of the original Hawks, and was best known from his days as a member of Janis Joplin&#x27;s Full Tilt Boogie Band.

The Band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame at the 1989 Juno Awards, where Robertson was reunited with original members Danko and Hudson. With Canadian country rock superstars Blue Rodeo as a back-up band, &quot;Music Express&quot; called the 1989 Juno appearance a symbolic &quot;passing of the torch&quot; from The Band to Blue Rodeo.

===1990–1999: Return to final recording and the death of Rick Danko===
In 1990, Capitol Records began to re-release the records from the 1970s. The remaining three members continued to tour and record albums with a succession of musicians filling Manuel&#x27;s and Robertson&#x27;s roles. The Band appeared at Bob Dylan&#x27;s 30th anniversary concert in New York City in October 1992, where they performed their version of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot;. In 1993, the group released their eighth studio album, &quot;Jericho&quot;. &quot;Jericho&quot; was their first album recorded since &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; 17 years prior, and also their first studio album since &quot;Islands&quot;. Without Robbie Robertson as primary lyricist, much of the songwriting for the album came from outside of the group. Also that year, The Band, along with Ronnie Hawkins, Bob Dylan, and other performers, appeared at U.S. President Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1993 &quot;Blue Jean Bash&quot; inauguration party.

In 1994, The Band performed at Woodstock &#x27;94. Later that year Robertson appeared with Danko and Hudson as the Band for the second time since the original group broke up. The occasion was the induction of The Band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Helm, who had been at odds with Robertson for years over accusations of stolen songwriting credits, did not attend. In February 1996, The Band with the Crickets recorded &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, released on the tribute album &quot;Not Fade Away (Remembering Buddy Holly)&quot;. The Band released two more albums after &quot;Jericho&quot;: &quot;High on the Hog&quot; (1996) and &quot;Jubilation&quot; (1998), the latter of which included guest appearances by Eric Clapton and John Hiatt. Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998 and was unable to sing for several years but he eventually regained the use of his voice.

In 1998, the group revealed they were working on a follow-up album to &quot;Jubilation&quot; that has not been released.

The final song the group recorded together was their 1999 version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot;, which they contributed to the Dylan tribute album &quot;Tangled Up in Blues&quot;. On December 10, 1999, Rick Danko died in his sleep at the age of 55. Following his death, The Band broke up for good. The final configuration of the group included Richard Bell (piano), Randy Ciarlante (drums), and Jim Weider (guitar).

=== 2000–present ===
In 2002, Robertson bought all other former members&#x27; financial interests in the group (with the exception of Helm&#x27;s), giving him major control of the presentation of the group&#x27;s material, including latter-day compilations. Richard Bell died of multiple myeloma in June 2007.

The Band received a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award on February 9, 2008, but there was no reunion of former members. In honor of the event, Helm held a Midnight Ramble in Woodstock. He continued to perform and released several albums. On April 17, 2012, it was announced via Helm&#x27;s official website that he was in the &quot;final stages of cancer&quot;; he died two days later.

In December 2020, it was announced that the third album of The Band, &quot;Stage Fright&quot;, would get an expanded reissue. The album has alternate versions of some songs.

Robbie Robertson died at the age of 80 on August 9, 2023, after battling prostate cancer. 

Garth Hudson, the last living original member, died at the age of 87 on January 21, 2025.

====Members&#x27; other endeavours====
In 1977, Rick Danko released his eponymous debut solo album, which featured the other four members of The Band on various tracks. In 1984, Danko joined members of the Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers, and others in the touring company that made up &quot;The Byrds Twenty-Year Celebration&quot;. Several members of the tour performed solo songs to start the show, including Danko, who performed &quot;Mystery Train&quot;. Danko also released two collaborative albums with Eric Andersen and Jonas Fjeld, along with some live and compilation albums in the 1990s and 2000s; many of the latter records were produced by Aaron L. Hurwitz and are on the Breeze Hill/Woodstock Records Label.

In the late 1970s and 1980s, Helm released several solo albums and toured with a band called Levon Helm and the RCO Allstars. He also began an acting career with his role as Loretta Lynn&#x27;s father in &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. Helm received praise for his narration and supporting role opposite Sam Shepard in 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;. In 1997, a CD by Levon Helm and the Crowmatix, &quot;Souvenir&quot;, was released. Beginning sometime in the 1990s, Helm regularly performed Midnight Ramble concerts at his home and studio in Woodstock, New York, and toured. In 2007 Helm released a new album, an homage to his southern roots called &quot;Dirt Farmer&quot;, which was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album on February 9, 2008. &quot;Electric Dirt&quot; followed in 2009 and won the inaugural Grammy Award for Best Americana Album. His 2011 live album &quot;Ramble at the Ryman&quot; won in the same category.

After he left The Band, Robbie Robertson became a music producer and wrote film soundtracks (including acting as music supervisor for several of Scorsese&#x27;s films) before beginning a solo career with his Daniel Lanois-produced eponymous album in 1987. Robertson continued mostly scoring films until his death in 2023.

Hudson released two solo CDs, &quot;The Sea to the North&quot; in 2001, produced by Aaron (Professor Louie) Hurwitz, and &quot;Live at the Wolf&quot; in 2005, both featuring his wife, Maud, on vocals. He also kept busy as an in-demand studio musician. He featured extensively on recordings of the Call and country-indie star Neko Case. Hudson contributed an original electronic score to an off-Broadway production of &quot;Dragon Slayers&quot;, written by Stanley Keyes and directed by Brad Mays in 1986 at the Union Square Theatre in New York, which was restaged with a new cast in Los Angeles in 1990. In 2010, Hudson released &quot;Garth Hudson Presents: A Canadian Celebration of The Band&quot;, featuring Canadian artists covering songs that were recorded by The Band.

In 2012, Jim Weider launched The Weight Band, performing covers of The Band&#x27;s music, alongside former members of the Levon Helm Band and Rick Danko Group. The Weight Band performed in a nationally broadcast PBS special, Infinity Hall Live, featuring new music. Following the show, the band announced a self-titled album of new music. The Weight Band also hosts Camp Cripple Creek, which celebrates the legacy of the Woodstock Sound. Past guests have included Jackie Greene, &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; producer John Simon and John Sebastian.

Manuel had few projects outside The Band; he and the rest of The Band contributed to Eric Clapton&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;No Reason to Cry&quot;. It included an original composition by Manuel and featured his vocals and drumming on several tracks. Manuel later worked on several film scores with Hudson and Robertson, including &quot;Raging Bull&quot; and &quot;The Color of Money&quot;. &quot;Whispering Pines: Live at the Getaway&quot; was released in 2002.

==Musical style==

The Band&#x27;s music fused many elements: although primarily incorporating old country music and early rock and roll, the rhythm section often was reminiscent of Stax- or Motown-style rhythm and blues, and Robertson cites Curtis Mayfield and the Staple Singers as major influences, resulting in a of many musical genres. Singers Manuel, Danko, and Helm each brought a distinctive voice to The Band: Helm&#x27;s Southern accent was prevalent in his raw and powerful vocals, Danko sang tenor with a distinctively choppy enunciation, and Manuel alternated between falsetto and a soulful baritone. The singers regularly blended in harmonies. Though the singing was more or less evenly shared among the three, both Danko and Helm have stated that they saw Manuel as The Band&#x27;s &quot;lead&quot; singer.

Every member was a multi-instrumentalist. There was little instrument-switching when they played live, but when recording, the musicians could make up different configurations in service of the songs. Hudson in particular was able to coax a wide range of timbres from his Lowrey organ. Helm&#x27;s drumming was often praised: critic Jon Carroll declared that Helm was &quot;the only drummer who can make you cry,&quot; while prolific session drummer Jim Keltner admits to appropriating several of Helm&#x27;s techniques. Producer John Simon is often cited as a &quot;sixth member&quot; of The Band for producing and playing on &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;, co-producing and playing on &quot;The Band&quot;, and playing on other songs up through The Band&#x27;s 1993 reunion album &quot;Jericho&quot;.

==Copyright controversy==
Robertson is credited as writer or co-writer of the majority of The Band&#x27;s songs and, as a result, has received most of the songwriting royalties generated from the music. This would become a point of contention, especially for Helm. In his 1993 autobiography, &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band&quot;, Helm disputed the validity of the songwriting credits as listed on the albums and explained that the Band&#x27;s songs were developed in collaboration with all members. Danko concurred with Helm: &quot;I think Levon&#x27;s book hits the nail on the head about where Robbie and Albert Grossman and some of those people went wrong and when The Band stopped being The Band ... I&#x27;m truly friends with everybody but, hey—it could happen to Levon, too. When people take themselves too seriously and believe too much in their own bullshit, they usually get in trouble.&quot; Robertson denied that Helm had written any of the songs attributed to Robertson. The studio albums recorded by Levon Helm as a solo artist—&quot;Levon Helm&quot; (1978), &quot;American Son&quot;, &quot;Levon Helm&quot; (1982), &quot;Dirt Farmer&quot;, and &quot;Electric Dirt&quot;—contain only one song crediting him as songwriter (&quot;Growin&#x27; Trade&quot;, co-written with Larry Campbell).

==Legacy==
The Band has influenced numerous bands, songwriters and performers, including the Grateful Dead, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, Led Zeppelin, Elvis Costello, Elton John, Phish, and Pink Floyd. The album &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;, in particular, is credited with contributing to Clapton&#x27;s decision to leave the supergroup Cream. In his introduction of The Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 he had heard the album, &quot;and it changed my life.&quot; The band Nazareth took their name from a line in &quot;The Weight&quot;. Guitarist Richard Thompson has acknowledged the album&#x27;s influence on Fairport Convention&#x27;s &quot;Liege and Lief&quot;, and journalist John Harris has suggested that The Band&#x27;s debut also influenced the spirit of the Beatles&#x27; back-to-basics album &quot;Let It Be&quot; as well as the Rolling Stones&#x27; string of roots-infused albums that began with &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;. George Harrison said that his song &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was heavily influenced by The Band and that, while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it. Meanwhile, &quot;The Weight&quot; has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles. In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group&#x27;s influence, &quot;We certainly didn&#x27;t want everybody to go out and get a banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we&#x27;re going to do now is go to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and record four sides, four psychedelic songs. Total freak-me songs. Just to show that we have no hard feelings. Just pretty good rock and roll.&quot;

In the 1990s, a new generation of bands influenced by The Band began to gain popularity, including Counting Crows, the Wallflowers, and the Black Crowes. Counting Crows indicated this influence with their tribute to the late Richard Manuel, &quot;If I Could Give All My Love (Richard Manuel Is Dead)&quot;, from their album &quot;Hard Candy&quot;. The Black Crowes frequently cover songs by The Band during live performances, such as &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;, which appears on their DVD/CD &quot;Freak &#x27;n&#x27; Roll into the Fog&quot;. They have also recorded at Helm&#x27;s studio in Woodstock.

The Hold Steady was formed after members Craig Finn and Tad Kubler watched &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;. Rick Danko and Robbie Robertson are name-checked in the lyrics of &quot;The Swish&quot; from the Hold Steady&#x27;s 2004 debut album &quot;Almost Killed Me&quot;. Also that year, southern rock-revivalists Drive-By Truckers released the Jason Isbell penned track &quot;Danko/Manuel&quot; on the album &quot;The Dirty South&quot;.

The Band also inspired Grace Potter, of Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, to form the band in 2002. In an interview with the Montreal Gazette, Potter said, &quot;The Band blew my mind. I thought if this is what Matt [Burr] meant when he said &#x27;Let&#x27;s start a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band,&#x27; ... that was the kind of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band I could believe in.&quot;

A tribute album, entitled &quot;Endless Highway: The Music of the Band&quot;, released in January 2007, included contributions from My Morning Jacket, Death Cab for Cutie, Gomez, Guster, Bruce Hornsby, Jack Johnson and ALO, Lee Ann Womack, the Allman Brothers Band, Blues Traveler, Jakob Dylan, Rosanne Cash, and others.

Members of Wilco, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, the Shins, Dr Dog, Yellowbirds, Ween, Furthur, and other bands staged The Complete Last Waltz in 2012 and 2013. Their performances included all 41 songs from the original 1976 concert in sequence, even those edited out of the film. Musical director Sam Cohen of Yellowbirds claims &quot;the movie is pretty ingrained in me. I&#x27;ve watched it probably 100 times.&quot;

An incarnation of the Band&#x27;s legacy, The Weight Band, originated inside the barn of Levon Helm in 2012 when Jim Weider and Randy Ciarlante, both former members of The Band, were performing &quot;Songs of the Band&quot; with Garth Hudson, Jimmy Vivino and Byron Isaacs. In July 2017, PBS&#x27;s Infinity Hall Live program began airing a televised performance by The Weight Band, featuring Band covers and new music by the band.

Every year on the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving, Dayton, Ohio NPR affiliate WYSO and The Dayton Art Institute host a tribute to &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;. Frequently selling out, the show features more than 30 local musicians. A similar event takes place annually in Madison, Wisconsin, on the Saturday night after Thanksgiving.

The Band are the subjects of the 2019 documentary film &quot;Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band&quot;, which premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival.

The Band is the subject of an extensive historical podcast, &quot;The Band: A History&quot;, currently covering the entire history of the group.

<text>In musical terminology, tempo (Italian for &#x27;time&#x27;; plural &#x27;tempos&#x27;, or from the Italian plural), measured in beats per minute, is the speed or pace of a given composition, and is often also an indication of the composition&#x27;s character or atmosphere. In classical music, tempo is typically indicated with an instruction at the start of a piece (often using conventional Italian terms) and, if a specific metrical pace is desired, is usually measured in beats per minute (BPM). In modern classical compositions, a &quot;metronome mark&quot; in beats per minute, indicating only measured speed and not any form of expression, may supplement or replace the normal tempo marking, while in modern genres like electronic dance music, tempo will typically simply be stated in BPM.

Tempo (the underlying pulse of the music) is one of the three factors that give a piece of music its texture. The others are meter, which is indicated by a time signature, and articulation, which determines how each note is sounded and how notes are grouped into larger units. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a vital skill for a musical performer, tempo is malleable. Depending on the genre of a piece of music and the performers&#x27; interpretation, a piece may be played with slight variations in tempo, known as tempo rubato, or significant variations. In ensembles, the tempo is often maintained by having players synchronise with a conductor or with a specific instrumentalist, for instance the first violin or the drummer.

==Measurement ==
Although tempo is described or indicated in many different ways, including with a range of words (e.g., &quot;Slowly&quot;, &quot;Adagio&quot;, and so on), it is typically measured in beats per minute (bpm or BPM). For example, a tempo of 60 beats per minute signifies one beat per second, while a tempo of 120 beats per minute is twice as rapid, signifying two beats every second. The note value of a beat will typically be that indicated by the denominator of the time signature. For instance, in time, the beat will be a crotchet, or quarter note.

This measurement and indication of tempo became increasingly popular during the first half of the 19th century, after Johann Nepomuk Maelzel invented the metronome. Beethoven was one of the first composers to use the metronome; in the 1810s he published metronomic indications for the eight symphonies he had composed up to that time.

With the advent of modern electronics, beats per minute became an extremely precise measure. Music sequencers use the bpm system to denote tempo. In popular music genres such as electronic dance music, accurate knowledge of a tune&#x27;s bpm is important to DJs for the purposes of beatmatching.

The speed of a piece of music can also be gauged according to measures per minute (mpm) or bars per minute (bpm), the number of measures of the piece performed in one minute. This measure is commonly used in ballroom dance music.

==Choosing speed==
In different musical contexts, different instrumental musicians, singers, conductors, bandleaders, music directors or other individuals will select the tempo of a song or piece. In a popular music or traditional music group or band, the bandleader or drummer may select the tempo. In popular and traditional music, whoever is setting the tempo often counts out one or two bars in tempo. In some songs or pieces in which a singer or solo instrumentalist begins the work with a solo introduction (prior to the start of the full group), the tempo they set will provide the tempo for the group. In an orchestra or concert band, the conductor normally sets the tempo. In a marching band, the drum major may set the tempo. In a sound recording, in some cases a record producer may set the tempo for a song (although this would be less likely with an experienced bandleader). Differences in tempo and its interpretation can differ between cultures, as shown by Curt Sachs when comparing Tunisian with Western Classical melodies, while certain genres display rhythmic variation in line with its forms, as occurs with flamenco and its &quot;palos&quot;.

==Musical vocabulary==

In classical music, it is customary to describe the tempo of a piece by one or more words, most commonly in Italian, in addition to or instead of a metronome mark in beats per minute. Italian is typically used because it was the language of most composers during the time these descriptions became commonplace in the Western musical lexicon. Some well-known Italian tempo indications include &quot;Allegro&quot; (English &quot;Cheerful&quot;), &quot;Andante&quot; (&quot;Walking-pace&quot;) and &quot;Presto&quot; (&quot;Quickly&quot;). This practice developed during the 17th and 18th centuries, the baroque and classical periods. In the earlier Renaissance music, performers understood most music to flow at a tempo defined by the tactus (roughly the rate of the human heartbeat). The mensural time signature indicated which note value corresponded to the tactus.

In the Baroque period, pieces would typically be given an indication, which might be a tempo marking (e.g. &quot;Allegro&quot;), or the name of a dance (e.g. &quot;Allemande&quot; or &quot;Sarabande&quot;), the latter being an indication both of tempo and of metre. Any musician of the time was expected to know how to interpret these markings based on custom and experience. In some cases, however, these markings were simply omitted. For example, the first movement of Bach&#x27;s Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 has no tempo or mood indication whatsoever. Despite the increasing number of explicit tempo markings, musicians still observe conventions, expecting a minuet to be at a fairly stately tempo, slower than a Viennese waltz; a perpetuum mobile quite fast, and so on. Genres imply tempos, and thus, Ludwig van Beethoven wrote &quot;In tempo d&#x27;un Menuetto&quot; over the first movement of his Piano Sonata Op. 54, though that movement is not a minuet.

Many tempo markings also indicate mood and expression. For example, &quot;presto&quot; and &quot;allegro&quot; both indicate a speedy execution (&quot;presto&quot; being faster), but &quot;allegro&quot; also connotes joy (from its original meaning in Italian). &quot;Presto&quot;, on the other hand, simply indicates speed. Additional Italian words also indicate tempo and mood. For example, the &quot;agitato&quot; in the &quot;Allegro agitato&quot; of the last movement of George Gershwin&#x27;s piano concerto in F has both a tempo indication (undoubtedly faster than a usual &quot;Allegro&quot;) and a mood indication (&quot;agitated&quot;).

Often, composers (or music publishers) name movements of compositions after their tempo (or mood) marking. For instance, the second movement of Samuel Barber&#x27;s first String Quartet is an &quot;Adagio&quot;.
===Basic tempo markings===
Here follows a list of common tempo markings. The beats per minute (bpm) values are very rough approximations for time, and vary widely according to composers and works. A metronome marking cannot be deduced from one of the descriptive Italian or non-Italian terms alone. Where both metronome marking and a word indication occur together, the verbal cue is often also intended to express a style or feeling, which a metronome marking alone cannot do.

It is therefore important to remember that the exact sense of many of these terms has changed over time. One striking example is the use of the term &quot;Allegretto&quot;. Between its early use in the 18th century and its later use from the 19th century onwards, it has experienced a slight increment in the tempo that it is intended to denote. Originally it implied a tempo very slightly faster than &quot;Andante&quot;, whereas now it is often used to indicate one that is just a little slower than &quot;Allegro&quot;. A similar fate has befallen the terms &quot;Adagietto&quot; and &quot;Andantino&quot;. Likewise, the terms &quot;Largo&quot; and &quot;Adagio&quot; have experienced a considerable shift with regards to the tempi, in beats per minute, that they are required to express: A modern &quot;Largo&quot; is slower than &quot;Adagio&quot;, but in the Baroque period it was faster.

====Approximately from the slowest to the fastest====
* &quot;Larghissimo&quot; – extremely slow, slowest type of tempo (24 bpm and under)
* &quot;Adagissimo&quot; and &quot;Grave&quot; – very slow and solemn (24–40 bpm)
* &quot;Largo&quot; – slow and broad (40–66 bpm)

* &quot;Moins&quot; – less, as in &quot;Moins vite&quot; (less fast)
* &quot;Modéré&quot; – at a moderate tempo
* &quot;Vif&quot; – lively
* &quot;Très&quot; – very, as in &quot;Très vif&quot; (very lively)
* &quot;Vite&quot; – fast
* &quot;Rapide&quot; – rapidly

Erik Satie was known to write extensive tempo (and character) markings by defining them in a poetical and literal way, as in his Gnossiennes.

====German tempo markings====
Many composers have used German tempo markings. Typical German tempo markings are:

* &quot;Kräftig&quot; – vigorous or powerful
* &quot;Langsam&quot; – slowly
* &quot;Lebhaft&quot; – lively (mood)
* &quot;Mäßig&quot; – moderately
* &quot;Rasch&quot; – quickly
* &quot;Schnell&quot; – fast
* &quot;Bewegt&quot; – animated, with motion
One of the first German composers to use tempo markings in his native language was Ludwig van Beethoven, but only sparsely. Robert Schumann followed afterwards with increasingly specific markings, and later composers like Hindemith and Mahler would further elaborate on combined tempo and mood instructions in German. For example, the second movement of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 is marked , indicating a slowish folk-dance-like movement, with some awkwardness and much vulgarity in the execution. Mahler would also sometimes combine German tempo markings with traditional Italian markings, as in the first movement of his sixth symphony, marked (Energetically quick, but not too much. Violent, but vigorous.)

====English tempo markings====
English indications, for example &#x27;quickly&#x27;, have also been used, by Benjamin Britten and Percy Grainger, among many others. In jazz and popular music lead sheets and fake book charts, terms like &#x27;fast&#x27;, &#x27;laid back&#x27;, &#x27;steady rock&#x27;, &#x27;medium&#x27;, &#x27;medium-up&#x27;, &#x27;ballad&#x27;, &#x27;brisk&#x27;, &#x27;brightly&#x27;, &#x27;up&#x27;, &#x27;slowly&#x27;, and similar style indications may appear. In some lead sheets and fake books, both tempo and genre are indicated, e.g., &#x27;slow blues&#x27;, &#x27;fast swing&#x27;, or &#x27;medium Latin&#x27;. The genre indications help rhythm section instrumentalists use the correct style. For example, if a song says &#x27;medium shuffle&#x27;, the drummer plays a shuffle drum pattern; if it says &#x27;fast boogie-woogie&#x27;, the piano player plays a boogie-woogie bassline.

&#x27;Show tempo&#x27;, a term used since the early days of vaudeville, describes the traditionally brisk tempo (usually 160–170 bpm) of opening songs in stage revues and musicals.

Humourist Tom Lehrer uses facetious English tempo markings in his anthology &quot;Too Many Songs by Tom Lehrer&quot;. For example, &quot;National Brotherhood Week&quot; is to be played &#x27;fraternally&#x27;; &quot;We Will All Go Together&quot; is marked &#x27;eschatologically&#x27;; and &#x27;Masochism Tango&#x27; has the tempo &#x27;painstakingly&#x27;. His English contemporaries Flanders and Swann have similarly marked scores, with the music for their song &quot;The Whale (Moby Dick)&quot; shown as &#x27;oceanlike and vast&#x27;.

==Variation through a piece==

Tempo is not necessarily fixed. Within a piece (or within a movement of a longer work), a composer may indicate a complete change of tempo, often by using a double bar and introducing a new tempo indication, often with a new time signature and/or key signature.

It is also possible to indicate a more or less gradual change in tempo, for instance with an &quot;accelerando&quot; (speeding up) or &quot;ritardando&quot; (&quot;rit&quot;., slowing down) marking. Indeed, some compositions chiefly comprise &quot;accelerando&quot; passages, for instance Monti&#x27;s &quot;Csárdás&quot;, or the Russian Civil War song Echelon Song.

On the smaller scale, tempo rubato refers to changes in tempo within a musical phrase, often described as some notes &#x27;borrowing&#x27; time from others.

===Terms for change in tempo===

Composers may use expressive marks to adjust the tempo:

* &quot;Accelerando&quot; – speeding up (abbreviation: &quot;accel.&quot;); the opposite of ritardando. It is defined by gradually increasing the tempo until the next tempo mark is noted. It is either marked by a dashed line or simply its abbreviation.
* &quot;Affrettando&quot; – speeding up with a suggestion of anxiety
* &quot;Allargando&quot; – growing broader; decreasing tempo, usually near the end of a piece
* &quot;Calando&quot; – going slower (and usually also softer)
* &quot;Doppio movimento&quot; / &quot;doppio più mosso&quot; – double-speed
* &quot;Doppio più lento&quot; – half-speed
* &quot;Lentando&quot; – gradually slowing, and softer
* &quot;Meno mosso&quot; – less movement; slower
* &quot;Meno moto&quot; – less motion
* &quot;Più mosso&quot; – more movement; faster
* &quot;Mosso&quot; – movement, more lively; quicker, much like &quot;più mosso&quot;, but not as extreme
* &quot;Precipitando&quot; – hurrying; going faster/forward
* &quot;Rallentando&quot; – a gradual slowing down (abbreviation: &quot;rall.&quot;)
* &quot;Ritardando&quot; – slowing down gradually; also see rallentando and ritenuto (abbreviations: &quot;rit.&quot;, &quot;ritard.&quot;) sometimes replaces allargando.
* &quot;Ritenuto&quot; – slightly slower, but achieved more immediately than &quot;rallentando or&quot; &quot;ritardando&quot;; a sudden decrease in tempo; temporarily holding back. (Note that the abbreviation for &quot;ritenuto&quot; can also be &quot;rit.&quot; Thus a more specific abbreviation is &quot;riten.&quot; Also, sometimes &quot;ritenuto&quot; does not reflect a tempo change but rather a &#x27;character&#x27; change.)
* &quot;Rubato&quot; – free adjustment of tempo for expressive purposes, literally &quot;stolen&quot;—so more strictly, to take time from one beat to slow another
* &quot;Slargando&quot; – gradually slowing down, literally &quot;slowing down&quot;, &quot;widening&quot; or &quot;stretching&quot;
* &quot;Stretto&quot; – in a faster tempo, often used near the conclusion of a section. (Note that in fugal compositions, the term &quot;stretto&quot; refers to the imitation of the subject in close succession, before the subject is completed, and as such, suitable for the close of the fugue. Used in this context, the term is not necessarily related to tempo.)
* &quot;Stringendo&quot; – pressing on faster, literally &quot;tightening&quot;
* &quot;Tardando&quot; – slowing down gradually (same as &quot;ritardando&quot;)
*&quot;Tempo Primo&quot; – resume the original tempo

While the base tempo indication (such as &quot;Allegro&quot;) typically appears in large type above the staff, adjustments typically appear below the staff or, in the case of keyboard instruments, in the middle of the grand staff.

They generally designate a &quot;gradual&quot; change in tempo; for immediate tempo shifts, composers normally just provide the designation for the new tempo. (Note, however, that when &quot;Più mosso&quot; or &quot;Meno mosso&quot; appears in large type above the staff, it functions as a new tempo, and thus implies an immediate change.) Several terms, e.g., &quot;assai&quot;, &quot;molto&quot;, &quot;poco&quot;, &quot;subito&quot;, control how large and how gradual a change should be (see common qualifiers).

After a tempo change, a composer may return to a previous tempo in two ways:

* &quot;a tempo&quot; – returns to the base tempo after an adjustment (e.g. &quot;ritardando ... a tempo&quot; undoes the effect of the ritardando).
* &quot;Tempo primo&quot; or &quot;Tempo Io&quot; – denotes an immediate return to the piece&#x27;s original base tempo after a section in a different tempo (e.g. &quot;Allegro ... Lento ... Moderato ... Tempo Io&quot; indicates a return to the &quot;Allegro&quot;). This indication often functions as a structural marker in pieces in binary form.

These terms also indicate an immediate, not a gradual, tempo change. Although they are Italian, composers tend to employ them even if they have written their initial tempo marking in another language.

===Tempo–rhythm interaction===

One difficulty in defining tempo is the dependence of its perception on rhythm, and, conversely, the dependence of rhythm perception on tempo. Furthermore, the tempo-rhythm interaction is context dependent, as explained by Andranik Tangian using an example of the leading rhythm of ″Promenade″ from Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;:

This rhythm is perceived as it is rather than as the first three events repeated at a double tempo (denoted as R012 = repeat from 0, one time, twice faster):

However, the motive with this rhythm in the Mussorgsky&#x27;s piece

is rather perceived as a repeat

This context-dependent perception of tempo and rhythm is explained by the principle of correlative perception, according to which data are perceived in the simplest way. From the viewpoint of Kolmogorov&#x27;s complexity theory, this means such a representation of the data that minimizes the amount of memory.

The example considered suggests two alternative representations of the same rhythm: as it is, and as the rhythm-tempo interaction — a two-level representation in terms of a generative rhythmic pattern and a &quot;tempo curve&quot;. Table 1 displays these possibilities both with and without pitch, assuming that one duration requires one byte of information, one byte is needed for the pitch of one tone, and invoking the repeat algorithm with its parameters R012 takes four bytes. As shown in the bottom row of the table, the rhythm without pitch requires fewer bytes if it is &quot;perceived&quot; as it is, without repetitions and tempo leaps. On the contrary, its melodic version requires fewer bytes if the rhythm is &quot;perceived&quot; as being repeated at a double tempo.

Thus, the loop of interdependence of rhythm and tempo is overcome due to the simplicity criterion, which &quot;optimally&quot; distributes the complexity of perception between rhythm and tempo. In the above example, the repetition is recognized because of additional repetition of the melodic contour, which results in a certain redundancy of the musical structure, making the recognition of the rhythmic pattern &quot;robust&quot; under tempo deviations. Generally speaking, the more redundant the &quot;musical support&quot; of a rhythmic pattern, the better its recognizability under augmentations and diminutions, that is, its distortions are perceived as tempo variations rather than rhythmic changes:

==Modern classical music==

Twentieth-century classical music introduced a wide range of approaches to tempo, particularly thanks to the influence of modernism and later postmodernism.

While many composers have retained traditional tempo markings, sometimes requiring greater precision than in any preceding period, others have begun to question basic assumptions of the classical tradition like the idea of a consistent, unified, repeatable tempo. Graphic scores show tempo and rhythm in a variety of ways. Polytemporal compositions deliberately utilise performers playing at marginally different speeds. John Cage&#x27;s compositions approach tempo in diverse ways. For instance, &quot;4′33″&quot; has a defined duration, but no actual notes, while As Slow as Possible has defined proportions but no defined duration, with one performance intended to last 639 years.

== Beatmatching ==

In popular music genres such as disco, house music and electronic dance music, beatmatching is a technique that DJs use that involves speeding up or slowing down a record (or CDJ player, a speed-adjustable CD player for DJ use) to match the tempo of a previous or subsequent track, so both can be seamlessly mixed. Having beatmatched two songs, the DJ can either seamlessly crossfade from one song to another, or play both tracks simultaneously, creating a layered effect.

DJs often beatmatch the underlying tempos of recordings, rather than their strict bpm value suggested by the kick drum, particularly when dealing with high tempo tracks. A 240 bpm track, for example, matches the beat of a 120 bpm track without slowing down or speeding up, because both have an underlying tempo of 120 quarter notes per minute. Thus, some soul music (around 75–90 bpm) mixes well with a drum and bass beat (from 150 to 185 bpm). When speeding up or slowing down a record on a turntable, the pitch and tempo of a track are linked: spinning a disc 10% faster makes both pitch and tempo 10% higher. Software processing to change the pitch without changing the tempo is called pitch-shifting. The opposite operation, changing the tempo without changing the pitch, is called time-stretching.

<text>Tommy James and the Shondells is an American rock band formed in Niles, Michigan, in 1964. The band has had two No. 1 singles in the U.S.: &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; (1966), the band&#x27;s only RIAA Certified Gold record, and &quot;Crimson and Clover&quot; (1969). The band also charted twelve other top 40 hits, including five in the Hot 100&#x27;s Top 10: &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; (1967), &quot;Mirage&quot; (1967), &quot;Mony Mony&quot; (1968), &quot;Sweet Cherry Wine&quot; (1969), and &quot;Crystal Blue Persuasion&quot; (1969).

==History==

===Origins===
The band The Echoes formed in 1959 in Niles, Michigan, then evolved into Tom and the Tornadoes, with 12-year-old Tommy James (then known as Tommy Jackson) as lead singer. While attending Niles High School in Niles, Michigan, the group released its first single, &quot;Long Pony Tail&quot;, in 1962.

In 1964, James renamed the band the Shondells because the name &quot;sounded good&quot; and in honor of nearby Fort Wayne&#x27;s own Troy Shondell, famous for his 1961 release &quot;This Time&quot;. At this time, the band included Tommy James (vocals and guitar), Larry Coverdale (lead guitar), Larry Wright (bass), Craig Villeneuve (keyboards) and Jim Payne (drums). In February 1964 the band recorded the Jeff Barry–Ellie Greenwich song &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; (originally a B-side by the Raindrops). As James could often be found playing at Niles High School events, his popularity locally continued to grow. James&#x27; version of &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; sold respectably in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois, but Snap Records, the label under which &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; was originally released, had no national distribution. The band toured the eastern Midwest, but no other market took to the song. The single failed to chart nationally and the Shondells disbanded in 1965 after its members graduated from high school.

After first considering taking a job outside of music, James decided to form a new band, the Koachmen, with Shondells guitarist Larry Coverdale and members of a rival group called the Spinners (not the hit-making group from Detroit). The Koachmen played a circuit of clubs in the Midwest through the summer and fall of 1965, but returned to Niles in February 1966, after the gigs dried up, to plot their next move.

===Hanky Panky===

Meanwhile, in 1965, Pittsburgh dance promoter Bob Mack had unearthed the forgotten single &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, playing it at various dance parties, and radio stations there touted it as an &quot;exclusive&quot;. Listener response encouraged regular play and demand soared. Bootleggers responded by printing 80,000 black market copies of the recording, which were sold in Pennsylvania stores.

James first learned of all this activity in April 1966 after getting a telephone call from Pittsburgh disc jockey &quot;Mad Mike&quot; Metro(vich) asking him to come and perform the song. James attempted to contact other members of the Shondells, but they had all moved away, joined the service or gotten married and left the music business altogether. There remains disagreement over the role of Metrovich in the recording. In his book, &quot;Me, The Mob and the Music&quot;, James credits Pittsburgh dance promoter Bob Mack and never mentions Metrovich.

In April 1966 James went by himself to make promotional appearances in Pittsburgh in nightclubs and on local television. Bob Mack made his dance club bands available to James for promotional appearances, but nothing seemed to fit until a guitarist from one of the bands took James to the Thunderbird Lounge in Greensburg, where he recruited a quintet that was playing there called the Raconteurs – Joe Kessler (guitar), Ron Rosman (keyboards), George Magura (saxophone and piano), Mike Vale (bass) and Vincent Pietropaoli (drums) – as the new Shondells. &quot;I had no group, and I had to put one together really fast,&quot; recalled James. &quot;I was in a Greensburg, PA club one night, and I walked up to a group that was playing that I thought was pretty good and asked them if they wanted to be the Shondells. They said yes, and off we went.&quot;

With a touring group to promote the single, James went to New York City, where he sold the master of &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; to Roulette Records, at which time he changed his last name to James. With national promotion, the single became a No. 1 hit in July 1966. He signed with Leonard Stogel and Associates for management. In 1967 Kessler and Pietropaoli were forced to leave after a dispute when planned monies were not remitted to them by Roulette, a label closely associated with organized crime, and whose head, Morris Levy, was the inspiration for the Herman &quot;Hesh&quot; Rabkin character on &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. They were replaced by Eddie Gray (guitar) and Peter Lucia (drums); Magura departed as well.

===Tommy James and the Shondells===
At first, Tommy James and &quot;his&quot; Shondells played straightforward rock and roll, but they soon became associated with the budding bubblegum music genre. James disputes this, saying that Super K Productions &quot;bubblegum&quot; producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz approached his record company (run by Morris Levy) looking for songwriting jobs. Levy spurned Kasenetz and Katz, so they went elsewhere and became successful with such bands as the 1910 Fruitgum Company. Bubblegum is generally traced to the success of the 1968 Fruitgum Company hit &quot;Simon Says&quot;. Tommy rejects the &quot;bubblegum&quot; label for his music. In early 1967 songwriter Ritchie Cordell gave them the No. 4 hit &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; and the No. 10 hit &quot;Mirage&quot;. In 1968, James had a No. 3 hit with &quot;Mony Mony&quot;. Co-written by James, Cordell, Cordell&#x27;s writing partner Bo Gentry, and Bobby Bloom, &quot;Mony Mony&quot; reached No. 3 in the US and was a British No. 1 in 1968. The title was inspired by a flashing sign for Mutual Of New York visible from James&#x27;s apartment balcony in New York. He followed it with &quot;Do Something to Me&quot;. The &quot;Crimson &amp; Clover&quot; album marked the start of the band&#x27;s psychedelic style.

The group toured with Vice President Hubert Humphrey during his 1968 presidential campaign, for which Humphrey showed his appreciation by writing the liner notes for their next album &quot;Crimson &amp; Clover&quot;, which was released in December 1968. From late 1968, the group began writing their own songs, with James and Lucia penning the psychedelic-tinged classic &quot;Crimson and Clover&quot;, which was recorded and mixed by Bruce Staple, with James tackling vocal duties and playing many of the instruments himself, and featured the creative use of studio effects such as delay and tremolo.

Further hits included &quot;Sweet Cherry Wine&quot;, &quot;Crystal Blue Persuasion&quot;, and &quot;Ball of Fire&quot;, all from 1969. They also produced &quot;Sugar on Sunday&quot;, later covered by the Clique. As the band embraced the sounds of psychedelia, they were invited to perform at Woodstock, but declined. 

The group continued until 1970.

=== Hog Heaven ===
At a concert in Birmingham, Alabama, in March 1970, an exhausted James collapsed after coming off stage from a reaction to drugs and was pronounced dead. He was not dead, however, and decided to move to the country to rest and recuperate, and left the band. His four bandmates carried on for a short while under the name Hog Heaven, recording two albums (one &quot;self-titled&quot; on Roulette Records in March 1971 and the second recorded in 1971, but unreleased until 2008), and landing one Hot 100 hit, &quot;Happy&quot;, at number 98, but disbanded soon afterwards.

In a 1970 side project, James wrote and produced the No. 7 hit single &quot;Tighter, Tighter&quot; for the group Alive N Kickin&#x27;. James launched a solo career in 1970 that yielded two notable hits over a 10-year span, &quot;Draggin&#x27; the Line&quot; (1971) and &quot;Three Times in Love&quot; (1980).

===Covers by other artists===
During the 1980s, the group&#x27;s songbook produced major hits for three other artists: Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts&#x27; version of &quot;Crimson and Clover&quot; (No. 7 in 1982), Tiffany&#x27;s &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; and Billy Idol&#x27;s &quot;Mony Mony&quot; (back-to-back No. 1 singles in November 1987). Other Shondells covers have been performed by acts as disparate as psychobilly ravers the Cramps, new wave singer Lene Lovich, country music veteran Dolly Parton, and the Boston Pops orchestra.

===1980s and later===
In the mid-1980s, Tommy James began touring in oldies packages with other acts from the 1960s sometimes billed as Tommy James &amp; the Shondells, although he is the group&#x27;s only original member. A Greenwich Village nightclub appearance was filmed and released as &quot;Tommy James &amp; the Shondells: Live! At The Bitter End&quot;. 

On January 6, 1987, original drummer Peter P. Lucia Jr. died of a heart attack while playing golf at the age of 39.

In 2008 &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; was covered by Tom Jones and released on his &quot;24 Hours&quot; album.

In 2009 James and the surviving Shondells, Gray, Vale and Rosman, reunited to record music for a soundtrack of a proposed film based on James&#x27; autobiography, &quot;Me, the Mob, and the Music&quot;, released in February 2010. 

In March 2011 the Tommy James song &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; (co-written with Peter Lucia) became a top 20 hit in the Netherlands for UK singer Don Fardon after his version had been used in a Vodafone commercial. 

In 2012 &quot;Crystal Blue Persuasion&quot; was used in the eighth episode of Season 5 of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, &quot;Gliding Over All&quot;, during a montage depicting the process involved to bring main character Walter White&#x27;s methamphetamine operation and its signature blue crystal meth to an international level.

In 2015 Gray, Vale, and Rosman decided to reunite and form their new group, The Crystal Blue Band. They recruited their longtime friend and drummer Mike Wilps to replace the late Peter Lucia. That group disbanded in 2022.

==Recognition==
In 2008 Tommy James and The Shondells were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

<text>Tunnel in the Sky is a juvenile science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, published in 1955 by Scribner&#x27;s as one of the Heinlein juveniles. The story describes a group of students sent on a survival test to an uninhabited planet, who soon realise they are stranded there. The themes of the work include the difficulties of growing up and the nature of man as a social animal.

==Plot summary==
In the future, Malthusian overpopulation on Earth has been averted by the invention of teleportation, called the &quot;Ramsbotham jump&quot;, which sends the excess population to colonize other planets. However, the costs of operating the technology mean that colony planets remain isolated from Earth until they can produce something to justify two-way trade. Because modern technology requires a supporting infrastructure, the colonists employ easily maintained technology similar to that of 19th century pioneers (such as Conestoga wagons and horses rather than tractors).

Rod Walker, a high-school student, dreams of becoming a professional colonist. The final test of his Advanced Survival class involves staying alive on an unfamiliar planet for between two and ten days. Students may team up and equip themselves with whatever gear they can carry, but they are otherwise completely on their own. They are told only that the challenges are neither insurmountable nor unreasonable. On test day, students walk through a Ramsbotham portal and find themselves alone on a strange planet, but reasonably close to the designated pickup point. Rod, acting on his older sister&#x27;s advice, takes hunting knives and basic survival gear, but no high-tech weaponry, on the grounds that the latter could make him overconfident. The last advice that the students receive is to &quot;watch out for stobor&quot;.

On the second day a thief ambushes Rod and knocks him unconscious. He wakes up to find all that he has left is a spare knife hidden under a bandage. In his desperate concentration on survival, he loses track of time. Eventually, he teams up with Jacqueline &quot;Jack&quot; Daudet, a student from another class whom he initially mistakes for a male. When she tells him that more than ten days have elapsed without contact, he realizes that something has gone wrong and they are stranded.

Rod and Jack start recruiting other survivors to build a settlement for long-term survival, and Rod becomes the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of a community that eventually grows to around 75 people. Disagreements reveal the need to elect a government for the new town. Rod has no taste for politics or administration and is happy to have Grant Cowper, an older college student and born politician, elected as mayor. Grant proves to be much better at talking than getting things done. Despite disagreeing with many of Grant&#x27;s policies, Rod supports him. Grant ignores Rod&#x27;s warning that they are living in a dangerously hard-to-defend location and that they should move to a cave system that he has found. When an indigenous species that the humans had regarded as harmless suddenly changes its behavior and stampedes through the camp, the settlement is devastated and Grant is killed. The citizens elect Rod as their new mayor.

Heinlein tracks the social development of the frontier community of educated young Westerners deprived of technology, followed by their society&#x27;s abrupt dissolution when Earth reestablishes contact. After nearly two years of isolation, the culture shock experienced by the survivors highlights for them and the reader the pain and uncertainty of becoming an adult by reversing the process abruptly. Each of the students returns from being a self-responsible member of an autonomous community to being regarded as a youth.

All of the students go back to Earth willingly enough except for Rod, who has great difficulty reverting from the status of head of a small but sovereign state to a teenager whom the adult rescuers casually brush aside. However, his teacher (and now brother-in-law) and his sister persuade him to change his mind. His teacher also informs Rod that his warning against &quot;stobor&quot; (&quot;robots&quot; spelled backwards) was just a way of personalizing the dangers of an unknown planet to instill fear and caution in the students, as all students receive the same warning, regardless of the planet they are sent to for the final exam.

Years later, Rod accomplishes his heart&#x27;s desire: preparing to lead a formal colonization party to another planet.

==Themes==
As in &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, which had been published a year earlier, isolation reveals the true natures of the students as individuals, but it also demonstrates some of the constants of human existence as a social animal. Its underlying themes run counter to those in &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, however, in that it shows a belief in the inherent strength of humans as proto-adults who can self-organize rather than descend into barbarism. Some of the students fall victim to their own foolishness, and others turn out to be thugs, but that is a part of human nature, just as the counter-trends take the group as a whole towards the beginnings of a stable society. The numerous political crises of the fledgling colony illustrate the need for legitimacy in a government appropriate for the society it administers, another common theme in Heinlein&#x27;s books. In both its romanticization of the pioneer and its glorification of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; as the toughest player in the Darwinian game, it presages themes developed further in books like &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. Unusual for science fiction at the time, but quite typical of Heinlein&#x27;s works, the novel portrays several competent and intelligent female characters.

The earlier part of the book makes a reference to a war - some generations before the book&#x27;s plot begins - in which China conquered and colonized Australia. The remnants of Australia&#x27;s original population - evidently referring to both Aboriginal Australians and European-descended Australians - were evacuated to New Zealand. The Chinese then engaged in a giant engineering project to reclaim Australia&#x27;s central desert, but it soon became a vast overpopulated slum. In the book&#x27;s present, the Chinese are colonizing marginal planets with harsh conditions, which nobody else wants, miserable peasants forced to move there against their will. All that has little bearing on the book&#x27;s main plot, serving mainly to demonstrate the strong Malthusian pressures which inflicted Earth until the way to colonize other planets by matter transmitter was found.

==Rod&#x27;s ethnicity==
Heinlein Society member and researcher Robert James has noted that Heinlein wrote a letter in which he &quot;firmly states&quot; that Rod Walker is black. According to James, &quot;The most telling evidence is that everybody in &#x27;Tunnel&#x27; expects Rod to end up with Caroline, who is explicitly described as black.&quot; In recognition of this, the cover illustration of a full cast audio version of the work was revised to &quot;show Rod with his correct ethnicity.&quot;

<text>The Jupiter trojans, commonly called trojan asteroids or simply trojans, are a large group of asteroids that share the planet Jupiter&#x27;s orbit around the Sun. Relative to Jupiter, each trojan librates around one of Jupiter&#x27;s stable Lagrange points: either &#x27;, existing 60° ahead of the planet in its orbit, or&#x27;, 60° behind. Jupiter trojans are distributed in two elongated, curved regions around these Lagrangian points with an average semi-major axis of about 5.2 AU.

The first Jupiter trojan discovered, 588 Achilles, was spotted in 1906 by German astronomer Max Wolf. More than 9,800 Jupiter trojans have been found . By convention, they are each named from Greek mythology after a figure of the Trojan War, hence the name &quot;trojan&quot;. The total number of Jupiter trojans larger than 1 km in diameter is believed to be about , approximately equal to the number of asteroids larger than 1 km in the asteroid belt. Like main-belt asteroids, Jupiter trojans form families.

, many Jupiter trojans showed to observational instruments as dark bodies with reddish, featureless spectra. No firm evidence of the presence of water, or any other specific compound on their surface has been obtained, but it is thought that they are coated in tholins, organic polymers formed by the Sun&#x27;s radiation. The Jupiter trojans&#x27; densities (as measured by studying binaries or rotational lightcurves) vary from 0.8 to 2.5 g·cm−3. Jupiter trojans are thought to have been captured into their orbits during the early stages of the Solar System&#x27;s formation or slightly later, during the migration of giant planets.

The term &quot;Trojan Asteroid&quot; specifically refers to the asteroids co-orbital with Jupiter, but the general term &quot;trojan&quot; is sometimes more generally applied to other small Solar System bodies with similar relationships to larger bodies: Mars trojans, Neptune trojans, Uranus trojans and Earth trojans are known to exist. Temporary Venus trojans and Saturn trojans exist, as well as for 1 Ceres and 4 Vesta. The term &quot;Trojan asteroid&quot; is normally understood to specifically mean the Jupiter trojans because the first Trojans were discovered near Jupiter&#x27;s orbit and Jupiter currently has by far the most known Trojans.

== Observational history ==
In 1772, Italian-born mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, in studying the restricted three-body problem, predicted that a small body sharing an orbit with a planet but lying 60° ahead or behind it will be trapped near these points. The trapped body will librate slowly around the point of equilibrium in a tadpole or horseshoe orbit. These leading and trailing points are called the and Lagrange points. The first asteroids trapped in Lagrange points were observed more than a century after Lagrange&#x27;s hypothesis. Those associated with Jupiter were the first to be discovered.

E. E. Barnard made the first recorded observation of a trojan, (identified as A904 RD at the time), in 1904, but neither he nor others appreciated its significance at the time. Barnard believed he had seen the recently discovered Saturnian satellite Phoebe, which was only two arc-minutes away in the sky at the time, or possibly an asteroid. The object&#x27;s identity was not understood until its orbit was calculated in 1999.

The first accepted discovery of a trojan occurred in February 1906, when astronomer Max Wolf of Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory discovered an asteroid at the Lagrangian point of the Sun–Jupiter system, later named 588 Achilles. In 1906–1907 two more Jupiter trojans were found by fellow German astronomer August Kopff (624 Hektor and 617 Patroclus). Hektor, like Achilles, belonged to the swarm (&quot;ahead&quot; of the planet in its orbit), whereas Patroclus was the first asteroid known to reside at the Lagrangian point (&quot;behind&quot; the planet). By 1938, 11 Jupiter trojans had been detected. This number increased to 14 only in 1961. As instruments improved, the rate of discovery grew rapidly: by January 2000, a total of 257 had been discovered; by May 2003, the number had grown to 1,600. there are 4,601 known Jupiter trojans at and 2,439 at .

== Nomenclature ==
The custom of naming all asteroids in Jupiter&#x27;s and points after famous heroes of the Trojan War was suggested by Johann Palisa of Vienna, who was the first to accurately calculate their orbits.

Asteroids in the leading () orbit are named after Greek heroes (the &quot;Greek node or camp&quot; or &quot;Achilles group&quot;), and those at the trailing () orbit are named after the heroes of Troy (the &quot;Trojan node or camp&quot;). The asteroids 617 Patroclus and 624 Hektor were named before the Greece/Troy rule was devised, resulting in a &quot;Greek spy&quot;, Patroclus, in the Trojan node and a &quot;Trojan spy&quot;, Hector, in the Greek node.

In 2018, at its 30th General Assembly in Vienna, the International Astronomical Union amended the naming convention for Jupiter trojans, allowing for asteroids with &quot;H&quot; larger than 12 (that is, a mean diameter smaller than approximately 22 kilometers, for an assumed albedo of 0.057) to be named after Olympic athletes, because there are now far more known Jupiter trojans than available names of Greek and Trojan warriors that fought in the Trojan war.

== Numbers and mass ==
Estimates of the total number of Jupiter trojans are based on deep surveys of limited areas of the sky. The swarm is believed to hold between 160,000 and 240,000 asteroids with diameters larger than 2 km and about 600,000 with diameters larger than 1 km. If the swarm contains a comparable number of objects, there are more than Jupiter trojans 1 km in size or larger. For the objects brighter than absolute magnitude 9.0 the population is probably complete. These numbers are similar to that of comparable asteroids in the asteroid belt. The total mass of the Jupiter trojans is estimated at 0.0001 of the mass of Earth or one-fifth of the mass of the asteroid belt.

Two more recent studies indicate that the above numbers may overestimate the number of Jupiter trojans by several-fold. This overestimate is caused by (1) the assumption that all Jupiter trojans have a low albedo of about 0.04, whereas small bodies may have an average albedo as high as 0.12; (2) an incorrect assumption about the distribution of Jupiter trojans in the sky. According to the new estimates, the total number of Jupiter trojans with a diameter larger than 2 km is and in the L4 and L5 swarms, respectively. These numbers would be reduced by a factor of 2 if small Jupiter trojans are more reflective than large ones.

The number of Jupiter trojans observed in the swarm is slightly larger than that observed in . Because the brightest Jupiter trojans show little variation in numbers between the two populations, this disparity is probably due to observational bias. Some models indicate that the swarm may be slightly more stable than the swarm.

The largest Jupiter trojan is 624 Hektor, which has a mean diameter of 203 ± 3.6 km. There are few large Jupiter trojans in comparison to the overall population. With decreasing size, the number of Jupiter trojans grows very quickly down to 84 km, much more so than in the asteroid belt. A diameter of 84 km corresponds to an absolute magnitude of 9.5, assuming an albedo of 0.04. Within the 4.4–40 km range the Jupiter trojans&#x27; size distribution resembles that of the main-belt asteroids. Nothing is known about the masses of the smaller Jupiter trojans. The size distribution suggests that the smaller Trojans may be the products of collisions by larger Jupiter trojans.

== Orbits ==
Jupiter trojans have orbits with radii between 5.05 and 5.35 AU (the mean semi-major axis is 5.2 ± 0.15 AU), and are distributed throughout elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points; each swarm stretches for about 26° along the orbit of Jupiter, amounting to a total distance of about 2.5 AU. The width of the swarms approximately equals two Hill&#x27;s radii, which in the case of Jupiter amounts to about 0.6 AU. Many of Jupiter trojans have large orbital inclinations relative to Jupiter&#x27;s orbital plane—up to 40°.

Jupiter trojans do not maintain a fixed separation from Jupiter. They slowly librate around their respective equilibrium points, periodically moving closer to Jupiter or farther from it. Jupiter trojans generally follow paths called tadpole orbits around the Lagrangian points; the average period of their libration is about 150 years. The amplitude of the libration (along the Jovian orbit) varies from 0.6° to 88°, with the average being about 33°. Simulations show that Jupiter trojans can follow even more complicated trajectories when moving from one Lagrangian point to another—these are called horseshoe orbits (currently no Jupiter Trojan with such an orbit is known, though one is known for Neptune).

=== Dynamical families and binaries ===
Discerning dynamical families within the Jupiter trojan population is more difficult than it is in the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified. Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.

In 2001, 617 Patroclus was the first Jupiter trojan to be identified as a binary asteroid. The binary&#x27;s orbit is extremely close, at 650 km, compared to 35,000 km for the primary&#x27;s Hill sphere. The largest Jupiter trojan—624 Hektor— is probably a contact binary with a moonlet.

== Physical properties ==
Jupiter trojans are dark bodies of irregular shape. Their geometric albedos generally vary between 3 and 10%. The average value is 0.056 ± 0.003 for the objects larger than 57 km, and 0.121 ± 0.003 (R-band) for those smaller than 25 km. The asteroid 4709 Ennomos has the highest albedo (0.18) of all known Jupiter trojans. Little is known about the masses, chemical composition, rotation or other physical properties of the Jupiter trojans.

=== Rotation ===
The rotational properties of Jupiter trojans are not well known. Analysis of the rotational light curves of 72 Jupiter trojans gave an average rotational period of about 11.2 hours, whereas the average period of the control sample of asteroids in the asteroid belt was 10.6 hours. The distribution of the rotational periods of Jupiter trojans appeared to be well approximated by a Maxwellian function, whereas the distribution for main-belt asteroids was found to be non-Maxwellian, with a deficit of periods in the range 8–10 hours. The Maxwellian distribution of the rotational periods of Jupiter trojans may indicate that they have undergone a stronger collisional evolution compared to the asteroid belt.

In 2008 a team from Calvin College examined the light curves of a debiased sample of ten Jupiter trojans, and found a median spin period of 18.9 hours. This value was significantly higher than that for main-belt asteroids of similar size (11.5 hours). The difference could mean that the Jupiter trojans possess a lower average density, which may imply that they formed in the Kuiper belt (see below).

=== Composition ===
Spectroscopically, the Jupiter trojans mostly are D-type asteroids, which predominate in the outer regions of the asteroid belt. A small number are classified as P or C-type asteroids. Their spectra are red (meaning that they reflect more light at longer wavelengths) or neutral and featureless. No firm evidence of water, organics or other chemical compounds has been obtained . 4709 Ennomos has an albedo slightly higher than the Jupiter-trojan average, which may indicate the presence of water ice. Some other Jupiter Trojans, such as 911 Agamemnon and 617 Patroclus, have shown very weak absorptions at 1.7 and 2.3 μm, which might indicate the presence of organics. The Jupiter trojans&#x27; spectra are similar to those of the irregular moons of Jupiter and, to a certain extent, comet nuclei, though Jupiter trojans are spectrally very different from the redder Kuiper belt objects. A Jupiter trojan&#x27;s spectrum can be matched to a mixture of water ice, a large amount of carbon-rich material (charcoal), and possibly magnesium-rich silicates. The composition of the Jupiter trojan population appears to be markedly uniform, with little or no differentiation between the two swarms.

A team from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii announced in 2006 that it had measured the density of the binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8 g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480 g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may not be a good indicator of asteroid origin.

== Origin and evolution ==

Two main theories have emerged to explain the formation and evolution of the Jupiter trojans. The first suggests that the Jupiter trojans formed in the same part of the Solar System as Jupiter and entered their orbits while it was forming. The last stage of Jupiter&#x27;s formation involved runaway growth of its mass through the accretion of large amounts of hydrogen and helium from the protoplanetary disk; during this growth, which lasted for only about 10,000 years, the mass of Jupiter increased by a factor of ten. The planetesimals that had approximately the same orbits as Jupiter were caught by the increased gravity of the planet. The capture mechanism was very efficient—about 50% of all remaining planetesimals were trapped. This hypothesis has two major problems: the number of trapped bodies exceeds the observed population of Jupiter trojans by four orders of magnitude, and the present Jupiter trojan asteroids have larger orbital inclinations than are predicted by the capture model. Simulations of this scenario show that such a mode of formation also would inhibit the creation of similar trojans for Saturn, and this has been borne out by observation: to date no trojans have been found near Saturn. In a variation of this theory Jupiter captures trojans during its initial growth then migrates as it continues to grow. During Jupiter&#x27;s migration the orbits of objects in horseshoe orbits are distorted causing the L4 side of these orbits to be over occupied. As a result, an excess of trojans is trapped on the L4 side when the horseshoe orbits shift to tadpole orbits as Jupiter grows. This model also leaves the Jupiter trojan population 3–4 orders of magnitude too large.

The second theory proposes that the Jupiter trojans were captured during the migration of the giant planets described in the Nice model. In the Nice model the orbits of the giant planets became unstable years after the Solar System&#x27;s formation when Jupiter and Saturn crossed their 1:2 mean-motion resonance. Encounters between planets resulted in Uranus and Neptune being scattered outward into the primordial Kuiper belt, disrupting it and throwing millions of objects inward. When Jupiter and Saturn were near their 1:2 resonance the orbits of pre-existing Jupiter trojans became unstable during a secondary resonance with Jupiter and Saturn. This occurred when the period of the trojans&#x27; libration about their Lagrangian point had a 3:1 ratio to the period at which the position where Jupiter passes Saturn circulated relative to its perihelion. This process was also reversible allowing a fraction of the numerous objects scattered inward by Uranus and Neptune to enter this region and be captured as Jupiter&#x27;s and Saturn&#x27;s orbits separated. These new trojans had a wide range of inclinations, the result of multiple encounters with the giant planets before being captured. This process can also occur later when Jupiter and Saturn cross weaker resonances.

In a revised version of the Nice model Jupiter trojans are captured when Jupiter encounters an ice giant during the instability. In this version of the Nice model one of the ice giants (Uranus, Neptune, or a lost fifth planet) is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is scattered outward by Jupiter causing the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn to quickly separate. When Jupiter&#x27;s semi-major axis jumps during these encounters existing Jupiter trojans can escape and new objects with semi-major axes similar to Jupiter&#x27;s new semi-major axis are captured. Following its last encounter the ice giant can pass through one of the libration points and perturb their orbits leaving this libration point depleted relative to the other. After the encounters end some of these Jupiter trojans are lost and others captured when Jupiter and Saturn are near weak mean motion resonances such as the 3:7 resonance via the mechanism of the original Nice model.

The long-term future of the Jupiter trojans is open to question, because multiple weak resonances with Jupiter and Saturn cause them to behave chaotically over time. Collisional shattering slowly depletes the Jupiter trojan population as fragments are ejected. Ejected Jupiter trojans could become temporary satellites of Jupiter or Jupiter-family comets. Simulations show that the orbits of up to 17% of Jupiter trojans are unstable over the age of the Solar System. Levison et al. believe that roughly 200 ejected Jupiter trojans greater than 1 km in diameter might be travelling the Solar System, with a few possibly on Earth-crossing orbits. Some of the escaped Jupiter trojans may become Jupiter-family comets as they approach the Sun and their surface ice begins evaporating.

== Exploration ==
On 4 January 2017 NASA announced that &quot;Lucy&quot; was selected as one of their next two Discovery Program missions. &quot;Lucy&quot; is set to explore seven Jupiter trojans. It was launched on October 16, 2021, and will arrive at the Trojan cloud in 2027 after two Earth gravity assists and a fly-by of a main-belt asteroid. It will then return to the vicinity of Earth for another gravity assist to take it to Jupiter&#x27;s Trojan cloud where it will visit 617 Patroclus.

<text>In mathematics and formal logic, a theorem is a statement that has been proven, or can be proven. The &quot;proof&quot; of a theorem is a logical argument that uses the inference rules of a deductive system to establish that the theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms and previously proved theorems.

In mainstream mathematics, the axioms and the inference rules are commonly left implicit, and, in this case, they are almost always those of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC), or of a less powerful theory, such as Peano arithmetic. Generally, an assertion that is explicitly called a theorem is a proved result that is not an immediate consequence of other known theorems. Moreover, many authors qualify as &quot;theorems&quot; only the most important results, and use the terms &quot;lemma&quot;, &quot;proposition&quot; and &quot;corollary&quot; for less important theorems.

In mathematical logic, the concepts of theorems and proofs have been formalized in order to allow mathematical reasoning about them. In this context, statements become well-formed formulas of some formal language. A theory consists of some basis statements called &quot;axioms&quot;, and some &quot;deducing rules&quot; (sometimes included in the axioms). The theorems of the theory are the statements that can be derived from the axioms by using the deducing rules. This formalization led to proof theory, which allows proving general theorems about theorems and proofs. In particular, Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems show that every consistent theory containing the natural numbers has true statements on natural numbers that are not theorems of the theory (that is they cannot be proved inside the theory).

As the axioms are often abstractions of properties of the physical world, theorems may be considered as expressing some truth, but in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is &quot;experimental&quot;, the justification of the truth of a theorem is purely deductive.
A &quot;conjecture&quot; is a tentative proposition that may evolve to become a theorem if proven true.

==Theoremhood and truth==
Until the end of the 19th century and the foundational crisis of mathematics, all mathematical theories were built from a few basic properties that were considered as self-evident; for example, the facts that every natural number has a successor, and that there is exactly one line that passes through two given distinct points. These basic properties that were considered as absolutely evident were called postulates or axioms; for example Euclid&#x27;s postulates. All theorems were proved by using implicitly or explicitly these basic properties, and, because of the evidence of these basic properties, a proved theorem was considered as a definitive truth, unless there was an error in the proof. For example, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle equals 180°, and this was considered as an undoubtable fact.

One aspect of the foundational crisis of mathematics was the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries that do not lead to any contradiction, although, in such geometries, the sum of the angles of a triangle is different from 180°. So, the property &quot;the sum of the angles of a triangle equals 180°&quot; is either true or false, depending whether Euclid&#x27;s fifth postulate is assumed or denied. Similarly, the use of &quot;evident&quot; basic properties of sets leads to the contradiction of Russell&#x27;s paradox. This has been resolved by elaborating the rules that are allowed for manipulating sets.

This crisis has been resolved by revisiting the foundations of mathematics to make them more rigorous. In these new foundations, a theorem is a well-formed formula of a mathematical theory that can be proved from the axioms and inference rules of the theory. So, the above theorem on the sum of the angles of a triangle becomes: &quot;Under the axioms and inference rules of Euclidean geometry, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle equals 180°&quot;. Similarly, Russell&#x27;s paradox disappears because, in an axiomatized set theory, the &quot;set of all sets&quot; cannot be expressed with a well-formed formula. More precisely, if the set of all sets can be expressed with a well-formed formula, this implies that the theory is inconsistent, and every well-formed assertion, as well as its negation, is a theorem.

In this context, the validity of a theorem depends only on the correctness of its proof. It is independent from the truth, or even the significance of the axioms. This does not mean that the significance of the axioms is uninteresting, but only that the validity of a theorem is independent from the significance of the axioms. This independence may be useful by allowing the use of results of some area of mathematics in apparently unrelated areas.

An important consequence of this way of thinking about mathematics is that it allows defining mathematical theories and theorems as mathematical objects, and to prove theorems about them. Examples are Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems. In particular, there are well-formed assertions than can be proved to not be a theorem of the ambient theory, although they can be proved in a wider theory. An example is Goodstein&#x27;s theorem, which can be stated in Peano arithmetic, but is proved to be not provable in Peano arithmetic. However, it is provable in some more general theories, such as Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.

==Epistemological considerations==
Many mathematical theorems are conditional statements, whose proofs deduce conclusions from conditions known as hypotheses or premises. In light of the interpretation of proof as justification of truth, the conclusion is often viewed as a necessary consequence of the hypotheses. Namely, that the conclusion is true in case the hypotheses are true—without any further assumptions. However, the conditional could also be interpreted differently in certain deductive systems, depending on the meanings assigned to the derivation rules and the conditional symbol (e.g., non-classical logic).

Although theorems can be written in a completely symbolic form (e.g., as propositions in propositional calculus), they are often expressed informally in a natural language such as English for better readability. The same is true of proofs, which are often expressed as logically organized and clearly worded informal arguments, intended to convince readers of the truth of the statement of the theorem beyond any doubt, and from which a formal symbolic proof can in principle be constructed.

In addition to the better readability, informal arguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic ones—indeed, many mathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates the validity of a theorem, but also explains in some way &quot;why&quot; it is obviously true. In some cases, one might even be able to substantiate a theorem by using a picture as its proof.

Because theorems lie at the core of mathematics, they are also central to its aesthetics. Theorems are often described as being &quot;trivial&quot;, or &quot;difficult&quot;, or &quot;deep&quot;, or even &quot;beautiful&quot;. These subjective judgments vary not only from person to person, but also with time and culture: for example, as a proof is obtained, simplified or better understood, a theorem that was once difficult may become trivial. On the other hand, a deep theorem may be stated simply, but its proof may involve surprising and subtle connections between disparate areas of mathematics. Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem is a particularly well-known example of such a theorem.

== Informal account of theorems ==

Logically, many theorems are of the form of an indicative conditional: &quot;If A, then B&quot;. Such a theorem does not assert &quot;B&quot; — only that &quot;B&quot; is a necessary consequence of &quot;A&quot;. In this case, &quot;A&quot; is called the &quot;hypothesis&quot; of the theorem (&quot;hypothesis&quot; here means something very different from a conjecture), and &quot;B&quot; the &quot;conclusion&quot; of the theorem. The two together (without the proof) are called the &quot;proposition&quot; or &quot;statement&quot; of the theorem (e.g. &quot;If A, then B&quot; is the &quot;proposition&quot;). Alternatively, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; can be also termed the &quot;antecedent&quot; and the &quot;consequent&quot;, respectively. The theorem &quot;If &quot;n&quot; is an even natural number, then &quot;n&quot;/2 is a natural number&quot; is a typical example in which the hypothesis is &quot;&quot;n&quot; is an even natural number&quot;, and the conclusion is &quot;&quot;n&quot;/2 is also a natural number&quot;.

In order for a theorem to be proved, it must be in principle expressible as a precise, formal statement. However, theorems are usually expressed in natural language rather than in a completely symbolic form—with the presumption that a formal statement can be derived from the informal one.

It is common in mathematics to choose a number of hypotheses within a given language and declare that the theory consists of all statements provable from these hypotheses. These hypotheses form the foundational basis of the theory and are called axioms or postulates. The field of mathematics known as proof theory studies formal languages, axioms and the structure of proofs.
Some theorems are &quot;trivial&quot;, in the sense that they follow from definitions, axioms, and other theorems in obvious ways and do not contain any surprising insights. Some, on the other hand, may be called &quot;deep&quot;, because their proofs may be long and difficult, involve areas of mathematics superficially distinct from the statement of the theorem itself, or show surprising connections between disparate areas of mathematics. A theorem might be simple to state and yet be deep. An excellent example is Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, and there are many other examples of simple yet deep theorems in number theory and combinatorics, among other areas.

Other theorems have a known proof that cannot easily be written down. The most prominent examples are the four color theorem and the Kepler conjecture. Both of these theorems are only known to be true by reducing them to a computational search that is then verified by a computer program. Initially, many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof, but it has become more widely accepted. The mathematician Doron Zeilberger has even gone so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved. Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation, including polynomial identities, trigonometric identities and hypergeometric identities.

==Relation with scientific theories==

Theorems in mathematics and theories in science are fundamentally different in their epistemology. A scientific theory cannot be proved; its key attribute is that it is falsifiable, that is, it makes predictions about the natural world that are testable by experiments. Any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness of the scientific theory, or at least limits its accuracy or domain of validity. Mathematical theorems, on the other hand, are purely abstract formal statements: the proof of a theorem cannot involve experiments or other empirical evidence in the same way such evidence is used to support scientific theories.
Nonetheless, there is some degree of empiricism and data collection involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems. By establishing a pattern, sometimes with the use of a powerful computer, mathematicians may have an idea of what to prove, and in some cases even a plan for how to set about doing the proof. It is also possible to find a single counter-example and so establish the impossibility of a proof for the proposition as-stated, and possibly suggest restricted forms of the original proposition that might have feasible proofs.

For example, both the Collatz conjecture and the Riemann hypothesis are well-known unsolved problems; they have been extensively studied through empirical checks, but remain unproven. The Collatz conjecture has been verified for start values up to about 2.88 × 1018. The Riemann hypothesis has been verified to hold for the first 10 trillion non-trivial zeroes of the zeta function. Although most mathematicians can tolerate supposing that the conjecture and the hypothesis are true, neither of these propositions is considered proved.

Such evidence does not constitute proof. For example, the Mertens conjecture is a statement about natural numbers that is now known to be false, but no explicit counterexample (i.e., a natural number &quot;n&quot; for which the Mertens function &quot;M&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) equals or exceeds the square root of &quot;n&quot;) is known: all numbers less than 1014 have the Mertens property, and the smallest number that does not have this property is only known to be less than the exponential of 1.59 × 1040, which is approximately 10 to the power 4.3 × 1039. Since the number of particles in the universe is generally considered less than 10 to the power 100 (a googol), there is no hope to find an explicit counterexample by exhaustive search.

The word &quot;theory&quot; also exists in mathematics, to denote a body of mathematical axioms, definitions and theorems, as in, for example, group theory (see mathematical theory). There are also &quot;theorems&quot; in science, particularly physics, and in engineering, but they often have statements and proofs in which physical assumptions and intuition play an important role; the physical axioms on which such &quot;theorems&quot; are based are themselves falsifiable.

==Terminology==
A number of different terms for mathematical statements exist; these terms indicate the role statements play in a particular subject. The distinction between different terms is sometimes rather arbitrary, and the usage of some terms has evolved over time.
* An &quot;axiom&quot; or &quot;postulate&quot; is a fundamental assumption regarding the object of study, that is accepted without proof. A related concept is that of a &quot;definition&quot;, which gives the meaning of a word or a phrase in terms of known concepts. Classical geometry discerns between axioms, which are general statements; and postulates, which are statements about geometrical objects. Historically, axioms were regarded as &quot;self-evident&quot;; today they are merely &quot;assumed&quot; to be true.
* A &quot;conjecture&quot; is an unproved statement that is believed to be true. Conjectures are usually made in public, and named after their maker (for example, Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture and Collatz conjecture). The term &quot;hypothesis&quot; is also used in this sense (for example, Riemann hypothesis), which should not be confused with &quot;hypothesis&quot; as the premise of a proof. Other terms are also used on occasion, for example &quot;problem&quot; when people are not sure whether the statement should be believed to be true. Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem was historically called a theorem, although, for centuries, it was only a conjecture.

* A &quot;theorem&quot; is a statement that has been proven to be true based on axioms and other theorems.
* A &quot;proposition&quot; is a theorem of lesser importance, or one that is considered so elementary or immediately obvious, that it may be stated without proof. This should not be confused with &quot;proposition&quot; as used in propositional logic. In classical geometry the term &quot;proposition&quot; was used differently: in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; (), all theorems and geometric constructions were called &quot;propositions&quot; regardless of their importance.
* A &quot;lemma&quot; is an &quot;accessory proposition&quot; - a proposition with little applicability outside its use in a particular proof. Over time a lemma may gain in importance and be considered a &quot;theorem&quot;, though the term &quot;lemma&quot; is usually kept as part of its name (e.g. Gauss&#x27;s lemma, Zorn&#x27;s lemma, and the fundamental lemma).
* A &quot;corollary&quot; is a proposition that follows immediately from another theorem or axiom, with little or no required proof. A corollary may also be a restatement of a theorem in a simpler form, or for a special case: for example, the theorem &quot;all internal angles in a rectangle are right angles&quot; has a corollary that &quot;all internal angles in a &quot;square&quot; are right angles&quot; - a square being a special case of a rectangle.
* A &quot;generalization&quot; of a theorem is a theorem with a similar statement but a broader scope, from which the original theorem can be deduced as a special case (a &quot;corollary&quot;). 

Other terms may also be used for historical or customary reasons, for example:

* An &quot;identity&quot; is a theorem stating an equality between two expressions, that holds for any value within its domain (e.g. Bézout&#x27;s identity and Vandermonde&#x27;s identity).
* A &quot;rule&quot; is a theorem that establishes a useful formula (e.g. Bayes&#x27; rule and Cramer&#x27;s rule).
* A &quot;law&quot; or &quot;principle&quot; is a theorem with wide applicability (e.g. the law of large numbers, law of cosines, Kolmogorov&#x27;s zero–one law, Harnack&#x27;s principle, the least-upper-bound principle, and the pigeonhole principle).

A few well-known theorems have even more idiosyncratic names, for example, the division algorithm, Euler&#x27;s formula, and the Banach–Tarski paradox.

==Layout==

A theorem and its proof are typically laid out as follows:

:&quot;Theorem&quot; (name of the person who proved it, along with year of discovery or publication of the proof)
:&quot;Statement of theorem (sometimes called the &quot;proposition&quot;)&quot;
:&quot;Proof&quot;
:&quot;Description of proof&quot;
:&quot;End&quot;

The end of the proof may be signaled by the letters Q.E.D. (&quot;quod erat demonstrandum&quot;) or by one of the tombstone marks, such as &quot;□&quot; or &quot;∎&quot;, meaning &quot;end of proof&quot;, introduced by Paul Halmos following their use in magazines to mark the end of an article.

The exact style depends on the author or publication. Many publications provide instructions or macros for typesetting in the house style.

It is common for a theorem to be preceded by definitions describing the exact meaning of the terms used in the theorem. It is also common for a theorem to be preceded by a number of &quot;propositions&quot; or &quot;lemmas&quot; which are then used in the proof. However, lemmas are sometimes embedded in the proof of a theorem, either with nested proofs, or with their proofs presented after the proof of the theorem.

Corollaries to a theorem are either presented between the theorem and the proof, or directly after the proof. Sometimes, corollaries have proofs of their own that explain why they follow from the theorem.

==Lore==

It has been estimated that over a quarter of a million theorems are proved every year.

The well-known aphorism, , is probably due to Alfréd Rényi, although it is often attributed to Rényi&#x27;s colleague Paul Erdős (and Rényi may have been thinking of Erdős), who was famous for the many theorems he produced, the number of his collaborations, and his coffee drinking.

The classification of finite simple groups is regarded by some to be the longest proof of a theorem. It comprises tens of thousands of pages in 500 journal articles by some 100 authors. These papers are together believed to give a complete proof, and several ongoing projects hope to shorten and simplify this proof. Another theorem of this type is the four color theorem whose computer generated proof is too long for a human to read. It is among the longest known proofs of a theorem whose statement can be easily understood by a layman.

==Theorems in logic==

In mathematical logic, a formal theory is a set of sentences within a formal language. A sentence is a well-formed formula with no free variables. A sentence that is a member of a theory is one of its theorems, and the theory is the set of its theorems. Usually a theory is understood to be closed under the relation of logical consequence. Some accounts define a theory to be closed under the semantic consequence relation (formula_1), while others define it to be closed under the syntactic consequence, or derivability relation (formula_2).

For a theory to be closed under a derivability relation, it must be associated with a deductive system that specifies how the theorems are derived. The deductive system may be stated explicitly, or it may be clear from the context. The closure of the empty set under the relation of logical consequence yields the set that contains just those sentences that are the theorems of the deductive system.

In the broad sense in which the term is used within logic, a theorem does not have to be true, since the theory that contains it may be unsound relative to a given semantics, or relative to the standard interpretation of the underlying language. A theory that is inconsistent has all sentences as theorems.

The definition of theorems as sentences of a formal language is useful within proof theory, which is a branch of mathematics that studies the structure of formal proofs and the structure of provable formulas. It is also important in model theory, which is concerned with the relationship between formal theories and structures that are able to provide a semantics for them through interpretation.

Although theorems may be uninterpreted sentences, in practice mathematicians are more interested in the meanings of the sentences, i.e. in the propositions they express. What makes formal theorems useful and interesting is that they may be interpreted as true propositions and their derivations may be interpreted as a proof of their truth. A theorem whose interpretation is a true statement &quot;about&quot; a formal system (as opposed to &quot;within&quot; a formal system) is called a &quot;metatheorem&quot;.

Some important theorems in mathematical logic are:
* Compactness of first-order logic 
* Completeness of first-order logic
* Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems of first-order arithmetic
* Consistency of first-order arithmetic 
* Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem
* Church-Turing theorem of undecidability 
* Löb&#x27;s theorem 
* Löwenheim–Skolem theorem
* Lindström&#x27;s theorem
* Craig&#x27;s theorem 
* Cut-elimination theorem

=== Syntax and semantics ===
The concept of a formal theorem is fundamentally syntactic, in contrast to the notion of a &quot;true proposition,&quot; which introduces semantics. Different deductive systems can yield other interpretations, depending on the presumptions of the derivation rules (i.e. belief, justification or other modalities). The soundness of a formal system depends on whether or not all of its theorems are also validities. A validity is a formula that is true under any possible interpretation (for example, in classical propositional logic, validities are tautologies). A formal system is considered semantically complete when all of its theorems are also tautologies.

<text>Tool is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1990. It consists of vocalist Maynard James Keenan, guitarist Adam Jones, drummer Danny Carey and bassist Justin Chancellor, who replaced founding member Paul D&#x27;Amour in 1995. Tool has won four Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping charts in several countries.

The band has released five studio albums, one EP and one box set. They emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, &quot;Undertow&quot; (1993), and became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement with the release of their follow-up album &quot;Ænima&quot; in 1996. The group&#x27;s efforts to combine musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued with &quot;Lateralus&quot; (2001) and &quot;10,000 Days&quot; (2006), gaining critical acclaim and international commercial success. Their fifth studio album &quot;Fear Inoculum&quot; was released on August 30, 2019, to widespread critical acclaim. Prior to its release, the band had sold more than 13 million albums in the US alone.

Due to Tool&#x27;s incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band has been described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock. The relationship between the band and the music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship, and the band&#x27;s insistence on privacy.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Opiate&quot; (1989–1992)===

During the 1980s, each of the future members of Tool moved to Los Angeles. Both Paul D&#x27;Amour and Adam Jones wanted to enter the film industry, while Maynard James Keenan, who had studied visual arts in Michigan, worked as a pet store remodeler. Danny Carey and Keenan performed for Green Jellÿ, and Carey played with Carole King and Pigmy Love Circus.

Keenan and Jones met through a mutual friend in 1989. After Keenan played Jones a tape recording of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming a new band. They started jamming together while searching for a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by Tom Morello, an old high school friend of Jones and former member of Electric Sheep. Carey began playing in their sessions because he &quot;felt kinda sorry for them&quot;, as other invited musicians were not showing up. Tool&#x27;s lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced the members to bassist D&#x27;Amour. Early on, the band fabricated the story that it formed because of the pseudophilosophy &quot;lachrymology&quot;. Although &quot;lachrymology&quot; was also cited as an inspiration for the band&#x27;s name, Keenan later explained the members&#x27; intentions differently: &quot;Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It&#x27;s a big dick. It&#x27;s a wrench. ... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out whatever it is you need to find out, or whatever it is you&#x27;re trying to achieve.&quot;

After almost two years of practicing and performing locally in the Los Angeles area, the band was approached by record companies, and eventually signed a record deal with Zoo Entertainment. In March 1992, Zoo released the band&#x27;s first effort, &quot;Opiate&quot;. Described by the band as &quot;slam and bang&quot; heavy music and the &quot;hardest sounding&quot; six songs they had written to that point, the EP included the singles &quot;Hush&quot; and &quot;Opiate&quot;. The band&#x27;s first music video, &quot;Hush&quot;, promoted their dissenting views about the then-prominent Parents Music Resource Center and its advocacy of the censorship of music. The video featured the band members naked with their genitalia covered by Parental Advisory stickers and their mouths covered by duct tape. The band began touring with Rollins Band, Fishbone, Rage Against the Machine, White Zombie, and Corrosion of Conformity, to positive responses, which Janiss Garza of &quot;RIP Magazine&quot; summarized in September 1992 as a &quot;buzz&quot; and &quot;a strong start&quot;.

===&quot;Undertow&quot; (1993–1994)===

The following year, at a time when alternative rock and grunge were at their height, Tool released their first full-length album, &quot;Undertow&quot; (1993). It expressed more diverse dynamics than &quot;Opiate&quot; and included songs the band had chosen not to publish on their previous release, when they had opted for a heavier sound. The band began touring again as planned, with an exception in May 1993. Tool was scheduled to play at the Garden Pavilion in Hollywood but learned at the last minute that the venue belonged to the Church of Scientology, which was perceived as a clash with &quot;the band&#x27;s ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts their development as a human being.&quot; Keenan &quot;spent most of the show baa-ing like a sheep at the audience.&quot;

Tool later played several concerts during the Lollapalooza festival tour, and was moved from the second stage to the main stage by the group&#x27;s manager and the festival co-founder Ted Gardner. At the last concert of Lollapalooza in Tool&#x27;s hometown Los Angeles, comedian Bill Hicks introduced the band. Hicks had become a friend of the band members and an influence on them after being mentioned in &quot;Undertow&quot;&#x27;s liner notes. He jokingly asked the audience of 10,000 people to stand still and help him look for a lost contact lens. The boost in popularity gained from these concerts helped &quot;Undertow&quot; to be certified gold by the RIAA in September 1993 and to achieve platinum status in 1995, despite being sold with censored album artwork by distributors such as Wal-Mart. The single &quot;Sober&quot; became a hit single by March 1994 and won the band &quot;Billboard&quot;″s &quot;Best Video by a New Artist&quot; award for the accompanying stop motion music video.

With the release of Tool&#x27;s follow-up single &quot;Prison Sex&quot;, the band again became the target of censorship. The song&#x27;s lyrics and video dealt with child abuse, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan&#x27;s lyrics begin with: &quot;It took so long to remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I&#x27;m breathing so I guess I&#x27;m still alive ... I&#x27;ve got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed and my throat wide open.&quot; The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his &quot;surrealistic interpretation&quot; of the subject matter. While some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as &quot;metaphoric&quot;, the American branch of MuchMusic (which asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing) deemed the music video too graphic and obscene, and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.

===&quot;Ænima&quot; and &quot;Salival&quot; (1995–2000)===

In September 1995, the band began writing and recording its second studio album. At that time Tool experienced its only lineup change to date, with bassist D&#x27;Amour leaving the band amicably to pursue other projects. According to Carey, D&#x27;Amour left the band because he wanted to play guitar rather than bass. Justin Chancellor, a member of former tourmate band Peach, eventually replaced D&#x27;Amour during the recording of the album, having been chosen over competitors such as Kyuss&#x27;s Scott Reeder, Filter&#x27;s Frank Cavanaugh, Pigmy Love Circus&#x27;s E. Shepherd Stevenson, Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27;s Eric Avery, and ZAUM&#x27;s Marco Fox.

On September 17, 1996, Tool released its second full-length album, &quot;Ænima&quot; (&quot;ON-ima&quot;). The band enlisted the help of producer David Bottrill, who had produced some of King Crimson&#x27;s albums, while Jones collaborated with Cam de Leon to create &quot;Ænima&quot;″s Grammy-nominated artwork. The album was dedicated to stand-up comedian Bill Hicks, who had died two-and-a-half years earlier. The band intended to raise awareness about Hicks&#x27;s material and ideas, because they felt that Tool and Hicks &quot;were resonating similar concepts&quot;. In particular, &quot;Ænima&quot;″s final track &quot;Third Eye&quot; is preceded by a clip of Hicks&#x27; performances, and the lenticular casing of the &quot;Ænima&quot; album packaging as well as the chorus of the title track &quot;Ænema&quot; make reference to a sketch from Hicks&#x27;s &quot;Arizona Bay&quot;, in which he contemplates the idea of Los Angeles falling into the Pacific Ocean.

The first single, &quot;Stinkfist&quot;, garnered limited airplay. It was shortened by radio programmers, MTV (U.S.) renamed the music video of &quot;Stinkfist&quot; to &quot;Track No. 1&quot; due to offensive connotations, and the lyrics of the song were altered. Responding to fan complaints about censorship, Matt Pinfield of MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot; expressed regret on air by waving his fist in front of his face while introducing the video and explaining the name change.

A tour began in October 1996, two weeks after &quot;Ænima&quot;″s release. Following numerous appearances in the United States and Europe, Tool headed for Australia and New Zealand in late March 1997. Eventually returning to the United States, Tool appeared at Lollapalooza &#x27;97 in July, this time as a headliner, where they gained critical praise from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;Ænima&quot; eventually matched Tool&#x27;s successful debut album in sales, and the progressive-influenced album landed the band at the head of the alternative metal genre. It featured the Grammy Award-winning &quot;Ænema&quot; and appeared on &quot;Best Albums of 1996&quot; lists in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and &quot;Terrorizer&quot;. It was eventually certified triple platinum by the RIAA on March 4, 2003. In 1998, Tool joined the Ozzfest tour in the United States as the co-headliner act before Ozzy Osbourne. The band accepted on the condition that Melvins had to join it as well because, as stated by its frontman Buzz Osborne, they &quot;wanted at least one band on the tour that they liked&quot;, despite the dissuasions from the tour organizers.

Two legal battles then began that interfered with the band&#x27;s working on another release. Volcano Entertainment—the successor of Tool&#x27;s by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment—alleged contract violations by Tool and filed a lawsuit. According to Volcano, Tool had violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After Tool filed a counter-suit stating that Volcano had failed to use a renewal option in their contract, the parties settled out of court. In December 1998 Tool agreed to a new contract, a three-record joint venture deal. Then in 2000, the band dismissed their long-time manager Ted Gardner, who then sued the band over his commission. During this time, Keenan joined the band A Perfect Circle, which was founded by long-time Tool guitar tech Billy Howerdel, while Jones joined The Melvins&#x27; Buzz Osborne and Carey drummed with Dead Kennedys&#x27; Jello Biafra on side projects. Although there were rumors that Tool was breaking up, Chancellor, Jones, and Carey were working on new material while waiting for Keenan to return. In 2000, the &quot;Salival&quot; box set (CD/VHS or CD/DVD) was released, effectively putting an end to the rumors. The CD contained one new original track, a cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;No Quarter&quot;, a live version of Peach&#x27;s &quot;You Lied&quot;, and revised versions of old songs. The VHS and the DVD each contained four music videos, plus a bonus music video for &quot;Hush&quot; on the DVD. Although &quot;Salival&quot; did not yield any singles, the hidden track &quot;Maynard&#x27;s Dick&quot; (which dates back to the &quot;Opiate&quot; era) briefly found its way to FM radio when several DJs chose to play it on air under the title &quot;Maynard&#x27;s Dead&quot;.

===&quot;Lateralus&quot; (2001–2005)===

In January 2001, Tool announced a new album, &quot;Systema Encéphale&quot;, along with a 12-song track list containing titles such as &quot;Riverchrist&quot;, &quot;Numbereft&quot;, &quot;Encephatalis&quot;, &quot;Musick&quot;, and &quot;Coeliacus&quot;. File-sharing networks such as Napster were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles&#x27; names. A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled &quot;Lateralus&quot;; the name &quot;Systema Encéphale&quot; and the track list had been a ruse. &quot;Lateralus&quot; and the corresponding tours would take Tool a step further toward art rock and progressive rock territory. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote in an attempt to summarize the album that &quot;Drums, bass and guitars move in jarring cycles of hyperhowl and near-silent death march ... The prolonged running times of most of &quot;Lateralus&quot;″ thirteen tracks are misleading; the entire album rolls and stomps with suitelike purpose.&quot; Joshua Klein of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; expressed his opinion that &quot;Lateralus&quot;, with its 79 minutes and relatively complex and long songs—topped by the ten-and-a-half-minute music video for &quot;Parabola&quot;—posed a challenge to fans and music programming alike.

The album became a worldwide success, reaching No.1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart in its debut week. Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for the song &quot;Schism&quot;. During the band&#x27;s acceptance speech, Carey stated that he would like to thank his parents (for putting up with him) and Satan, and bassist Chancellor concluded: &quot;I want to thank my dad for doing my mom.&quot;

Extensive touring throughout 2001 and 2002 supported &quot;Lateralus&quot; and included a personal highlight for the band: a 10-show joint mini-tour with King Crimson in August 2001. Comparisons between the two were made, MTV describing the bands as &quot;the once and future kings of progressive rock&quot;. Keenan stated of the minitour: &quot;For me, being on stage with King Crimson is like Lenny Kravitz playing with Led Zeppelin, or Britney Spears onstage with Debbie Gibson.&quot; Although the end of the tour in November 2002 seemed to signal the start of another hiatus for the band, they did not become completely inactive. While Keenan recorded and toured with A Perfect Circle, the other band members released an interview and a recording of new material, both exclusive to the fan club. The &quot;double vinyl four-picture disc&quot; edition of &quot;Lateralus&quot; was first released as a limited autographed edition exclusively available to fan club members and publicly released on August 23, 2005. On December 20 the two DVDs were released, one containing the single &quot;Schism&quot; and the other &quot;Parabola&quot;, a remix by Lustmord, and a music video with commentary by David Yow and Jello Biafra.

===&quot;10,000 Days&quot; (2006–2009)===
Fifteen years into the band&#x27;s career, Tool had acquired what Dan Epstein of &quot;Revolver&quot; described as a devoted &quot;cult&quot; following, and as details about the band&#x27;s next album emerged, such as the influence of &quot;Lateralus&quot; tourmates Fantômas and Meshuggah, controversy surrounding the new Tool album surfaced with speculation over song titles and pre-release rumors of leaked songs. Speculation over possible album titles was dismissed with a news item on the official Tool website, announcing that the new album&#x27;s name was &quot;10,000 Days&quot;. Nevertheless, speculation continued, with allegations that &quot;10,000 Days&quot; was merely a &quot;decoy&quot; album to fool audiences. The rumor was proven false when a leaked copy of the album was distributed via filesharing networks a week prior to its official release.

The album opener, &quot;Vicarious&quot;, premiered on U.S. radio stations on April 17, 2006. The album premiered on May 2 in the U.S. and debuted at the top spots of various international charts. &quot;10,000 Days&quot; sold 564,000 copies in its opening week in the U.S. and was number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, doubling the sales of Pearl Jam&#x27;s self-titled album, its closest competitor. However, &quot;10,000 Days&quot; was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor &quot;Lateralus&quot;.

Prior to the release of &quot;10,000 Days&quot;, a tour kicked off at Coachella on April 30. The touring schedule was similar to the &quot;Lateralus&quot; tour of 2001; supporting acts were Isis and Mastodon. During a short break early the next year, after touring Australia and New Zealand, drummer Carey suffered a biceps tear during a skirmish with his girlfriend&#x27;s dog, casting uncertainty on the band&#x27;s upcoming concerts in North America. Carey underwent surgery on February 21 and several performances had to be postponed. Back on tour by April, Tool appeared on June 15 as a headliner at the Bonnaroo Music Festival with a guest appearance from Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s Tom Morello on &quot;Lateralus&quot;. Meanwhile, &quot;Vicarious&quot; was a nominee for Best Hard Rock Performance and &quot;10,000 Days&quot; won Best Recording Package at the 49th Grammy Awards. The music video for &quot;Vicarious&quot; was released on DVD on December 18. The band&#x27;s 2009 summer tour began on July 18 in Commerce City, Colorado, at the Mile High Music Festival. They headlined Lollapalooza 2009 and a show on August 22 for the Epicenter Festival in Pomona, California.

===&quot;Fear Inoculum&quot; (2012–2022)===

Their Tool Winter Tour played dates across the U.S. and Canada in January and February 2012. The band played at Ozzfest Japan on May 12, 2013. On July 15, 2014, Carey and Jones informed &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that family commitments and an ongoing lawsuit are the key reasons for the delayed fifth album. Carey said to the music publication that one untitled track is &quot;pretty much done&quot;. In March 2015, Jones revealed that the lawsuit had been settled in the band&#x27;s favor, and as such, the band was turning their focus towards recording the album. He said that he hoped the album would be finished before the end of 2015 but emphasized that the band would not rush their work to meet an arbitrary deadline. In January 2016, Tool undertook a tour of the United States. While it was reported in February 2017 that Keenan had entered the studio to work on vocals for the fifth Tool album, it was later reported that the album was not scheduled for release in 2017. Still, the band announced a North American tour starting in May. A month later, Chancellor revealed that the new Tool album was &quot;about 90-percent there&quot;, while Carey claimed in separate interviews that it would &quot;definitely&quot; be released in 2018. In February 2018, Jones revealed that Keenan was working on lyrics for the album, and that the band would begin recording in March. In June 2018, during his acceptance speech for the Icon Award at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards, Keenan stated &quot;I&#x27;ll go on record now saying you&#x27;re gonna see some new music next year.&quot;

 On September 11, 2018, Keenan announced via Twitter that production on the record was progressing and that vocals had been written, before suggesting a 2019 release. In January 2019, Keenan announced that he had completed recording his vocals for the album &quot;months ago.&quot; While Carey mentioned aiming for a mid-April release date, Keenan later explained that between May and July was a more realistic time frame to wrap up production and release the album. On May 5, 2019, the band debuted two new songs live at the Welcome to Rockville Festival in Jacksonville, Florida called &quot;Descending&quot; and &quot;Invincible&quot;. Three days later, it was confirmed that the band&#x27;s new album is scheduled to be released on August 30, 2019. On July 29, 2019, Keenan confirmed the album would be titled &quot;Fear Inoculum&quot;. The title track was released as a single on August 7, the band&#x27;s first release in 13 years.

On August 2, 2019, Tool&#x27;s discography (with the exception of &quot;Salival&quot;) became available on music streaming platforms. Tool was one of the last major holdouts to release their music digitally, as their record deal was signed before the rise in streaming and not revisited until before &quot;Fear Inoculum&quot;. The release resulted in every Tool release entering several international charts, breaking several &quot;Billboard&quot; chart records. Keenan later said he regretted not moving to streaming platforms sooner, as it reduced Tool&#x27;s exposure to new audiences.

&quot;Fear Inoculum&quot; was launched on August 30 and became Tool&#x27;s third U.S. number one. On January 26, 2020, the band won the Best Metal Performance for their song &quot;7empest&quot; at the 62nd Grammy Awards Their other nomination, &quot;Fear Inoculum&quot;, lost the Best Rock Song category to Gary Clark Jr.

In June 2020, Tool canceled its upcoming North American tour after postponing a handful of dates due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The following August, Carey noted that the band had entered a hiatus, but that he still hoped they would reconvene in the future to record an EP, which the band would have more freedom in releasing due to no longer being signed to a record label. On October 27, 2020, an instrumental song titled &quot;The Witness&quot; was released featuring Jones, Chancellor, and Carey, and featuring production from Barresi, though the song was credited to Jones, not the band itself.

&quot;Opiate&quot; was re-recorded and released as &quot;Opiate²&quot; or &quot;Opiate Squared&quot; on March 1, 2022. It is almost twice as long as the original and includes the same lyrics as the live version, plus the extended instrumental midsection. A music video directed by Dominic Hailstone was released on March 18, 2022, to commemorate the EP&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

===Upcoming sixth studio album (2022–present)===
In March 2022, Carey announced they were working on new material for their sixth studio album, noting that &quot;..it won&#x27;t take us this long for the next one. We even had some stuff left over from the last one that we&#x27;ll develop. We have head starts on three or four new songs.&quot; In October 2023, Chancellor reiterated this, and noted he hoped the band would enter the studio to record in 2024 after finishing touring. In January 2024, Carey mentioned the new album has the possibility of having a shorter track lengths, noting that &quot;we could just go back to doing an &quot;Undertow&quot; [type of] record. That&#x27;s kind of appealing to me.&quot; In February 2025, Chancellor announced Tool will &quot;dedicate the next three months&quot; in the studio to &quot;organizing [their] ideas&quot; for new music.

==Musical style and influences==

===Musical style===
Tool&#x27;s musical style has been described as alternative metal, art rock, post-metal, progressive rock, progressive metal, and heavy metal. Tool was described by Patrick Donovan of &quot;The Age&quot; as &quot;the thinking person&#x27;s metal band. Cerebral and visceral, soft and heavy, melodic and abrasive, tender and brutal, familiar and strange, western and eastern, beautiful and ugly, taut yet sprawling and epic, they are a tangle of contradictions.&quot; Tool has gained critical praise from the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;″s C.B. Liddell for their complex and ever-evolving sound. Describing their general sound, AllMusic refers to them as &quot;grinding, post-Jane&#x27;s Addiction heavy metal&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; sees similarities to &quot;Led Zeppelin&#x27;s heaving, battering guitar riffs and Middle Eastern modes&quot;. Their 2001 work &quot;Lateralus&quot; was compared by AllMusic to Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Meddle&quot; (1971), but thirty years later and altered by &quot;Tool&#x27;s impulse to cram every inch of infinity with hard guitar meat and absolute dread&quot;. Tool had been labelled as post-metal in 1993 and 1996, as well as in 2006, after the term came into popularity. A component of Tool&#x27;s song repertoire relies on the use of unusual time signatures. For instance, Chancellor describes the time signature employed on the first single from &quot;Lateralus&quot;, &quot;Schism&quot;, as &quot;six&quot; and &quot;six-and-a-half&quot; and that it later &quot;goes into all kinds of other times&quot;. Further examples include the album&#x27;s title track, which also displays shifting rhythms, as do &quot;10,000 Days&quot;: &quot;Wings for Marie (Pt 1)&quot; and &quot;10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)&quot;.

Beyond this aspect of the band&#x27;s sound, each band member experiments within his wide musical scope. &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine described Chancellor&#x27;s bass playing as having a &quot;thick midrange tone, guitar-style techniques, and elastic versatility&quot;. As an example of this, the magazine mentioned the use of a wah effect by hammering &quot;the notes with the left hand and using the bass&#x27;s tone controls to get a tone sweep&quot;, such as on the song &quot;The Patient&quot;, from &quot;Lateralus&quot;.

Completing the band&#x27;s rhythm section, drummer Carey uses polyrhythms, tabla-style techniques, and the incorporation of custom electronic drum pads to trigger samples, such as prerecorded tabla and octoban sounds.

Keenan&#x27;s ability as a vocalist has been characterized more subjectively by the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;: After his performance during an Alice in Chains reunion concert in 2005, freelancer Travis Hay saw him as &quot;a natural fit at replacing Layne Staley&quot;. Regarding his role in A Perfect Circle and Tool, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;both groups rely on Mr. Keenan&#x27;s ability to dignify emotions like lust, anger and disgust, the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity&quot;.

According to &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine, Jones does not rely on any one particular guitar-playing technique but rather combines many techniques. For example, AllMusic wrote that he &quot;alternately utiliz[es] power chords, scratchy noise, chiming arpeggios, and a quiet minimalism&quot; in &quot;Sober&quot;. Additionally, the band uses forms of instrumental experimentation, like the use of a &quot;pipe bomb microphone&quot; (a guitar pickup mounted inside a brass cylinder) and a talk box guitar solo on &quot;Jambi&quot;.

The band puts an emphasis on the sound of their songs and attempts to reduce the effect lyrics can have on the perception of songs by not releasing song lyrics with their albums, although they eventually released the lyrics for &quot;Fear Inoculum&quot; for that album&#x27;s CD. Lyrical arrangements are often given special attention, such as in &quot;Lateralus&quot;. The number of syllables per line in the lyrics to &quot;Lateralus&quot; correspond to an arrangement of the Fibonacci numbers and the song &quot;Jambi&quot; uses and makes a reference to the common metrical foot iamb. The lyrics on &quot;Ænima&quot; and &quot;Lateralus&quot; focus on philosophy and spirituality—specific subjects range from organized religion in &quot;Opiate&quot;, to evolution and Jungian psychology in &quot;Forty-Six &amp; 2&quot; and transcendence in &quot;Lateralus&quot;. On &quot;10,000 Days&quot;, Keenan wanted to explore issues more personal to him: the album name and title track refer to the twenty-seven years during which his mother suffered from complications of a stroke until her death in 2003.

===Influences===

In 1997, Tool named King Crimson, Melvins, and Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Passion&quot; as influences. In describing their wide range of styles, critics have noted that they are &quot;influenced as much by Pink Floyd as by the Sex Pistols.&quot; In a 1993 interview, Adam Jones mentioned Joni Mitchell, King Crimson, Depeche Mode, and country music as being among their inspirations. In 1997, Maynard James Keenan named &quot;Hejira&quot; by Joni Mitchell, &quot;Holy Money&quot;/&quot;Greed&quot; by Swans, &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; by Led Zeppelin, &quot;Red&quot; by King Crimson, and &quot;Passion&quot; by Peter Gabriel as his five favorite records. Danny Carey cited Neil Peart from Rush, Bill Bruford and Alan White of Yes as his biggest rock influences, in addition to Bruford&#x27;s adventurousness in electronic drums. In the same way, Jones stated that Robert Fripp&#x27;s performances with King Crimson caused him to &quot;wake up&quot; to music as a teen. Furthermore, he acknowledged the other King Crimson guitarists, Adrian Belew and Trey Gunn, along with Buzz Osborne from the Melvins, as his biggest influences.

Tool have constantly expressed the massive impact that progressive rock pioneers King Crimson have had on their music; on a 2001 tour with them, Keenan joked: &quot;Now you know who we ripped off. Just don&#x27;t tell anyone, especially the members of King Crimson.&quot; Carey said that listening to the &quot;Discipline&quot; album upon its 1981 release &quot;revolutionized&quot; his musical perspective in terms of polyrhythms and the balance between the instruments. In 1997, Keenan explained how the composition process of Tool reflected that of King Crimson: &quot;They&#x27;re very much into listening to each other; even though they might have a basic structure that they&#x27;re following, it&#x27;s about fitting themselves in with each other.&quot; Contrary to these statements, longtime King Crimson member Robert Fripp has downplayed any influence his band had on Tool. In an interview, Fripp touched on how the two bands relate to each other, stating &quot;Do you hear the influence? There&#x27;s just one figure where I hear an influence, just one. It was a piece we were developing that we dropped. And it&#x27;s almost exactly the same figure: three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar. So I do not think you could have heard it. That&#x27;s the only thing.&quot; He also said, 

The band&#x27;s long build-ups of intensity were largely inspired by the Melvins. The latter&#x27;s influence on Tool is most explicit in &quot;Undertow&quot;, and some authors have described Tool&#x27;s music as a progressive take on Melvins. On the other hand, Keenan&#x27;s exotic modulations were influenced by world music; in his twenties, the singer was immersed in that type of music, thus when Peter Gabriel reunited several musicians whom Keenan already knew of for &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; soundtrack, which mixed their traditional styles with modern ambient music, it became a major revelation for him.

Other reported influences of Tool include Fantômas, Devo, Bill Hicks, Rush, Helmet, Faith No More, Bauhaus, Meshuggah, David Bowie, Mike Patton, Dave Lombardo, and Jane&#x27;s Addiction.

===Influence on other artists===
Writers HP Newquist and Rich Maloof attribute to Tool an influence on modern metal in their book &quot;The New Metal Masters&quot;. Sean Richardson of &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; sees System of a Down, Deftones, and Korn as examples of Tool&#x27;s &quot;towering influence&quot; on the genre. Keenan&#x27;s style of singing has been seen as heavily influencing artists such as Pete Loeffler of Chevelle, Benjamin Burnley of Breaking Benjamin, Will Martin of Earshot, and Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit.

==Visual arts==
Part of Tool&#x27;s work as a band is to incorporate influences of other works of art in their music videos, live shows, and album packaging. Adam Jones doubles as the band&#x27;s art director and director of their music videos. Another expression of this is an official website &quot;dedicated to the arts and influences&quot; on the band.

===Music videos===

The band has released eight music videos but made personal appearances in only the first two, which the band states is to prevent people from &quot;latching onto the personalities involved rather than listening to the music.&quot; With the exception of &quot;Hush&quot; and &quot;Vicarious&quot; all of Tool&#x27;s music videos feature stop motion animation to some extent. The videos are created primarily by Adam Jones, often in collaboration with artists such as Chet Zar, Alex Grey, and Osseus Labyrint.

The &quot;Sober&quot; music video in particular attracted much attention. Jones explained that it does not contain a storyline, but that his intentions were to summon personal emotions with its imagery. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described this imagery as &quot;evil little men dwell in a dark dungeon with meat coursing through pipes in the wall&quot; and called it a &quot;groundbreaking&quot;, &quot;epic&quot; clip. &quot;Billboard&quot; voted it &quot;Best Video by a New Artist&quot;.

The video for &quot;Vicarious&quot; was released on DVD on December 18, 2007. The video is the first by Tool to be produced entirely through the use of CGI.

===Album artwork===
Jones is responsible for most of the band&#x27;s artwork concepts. The album &quot;Undertow&quot; features a ribcage sculpture by Jones on its cover and photos contributed by the band members. Later albums included artwork by collaborating artists: &quot;Ænima&quot; and &quot;Salival&quot; featured works by Cam de Leon; &quot;Lateralus&quot; and &quot;10,000 Days&quot; were created with the help of Alex Grey. The releases garnered positive critical reception, with a music journalist of the Associated Press attributing to the band a reputation for innovative album packaging.

Both &quot;Ænima&quot; and &quot;10,000 Days&quot; were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Recording Package, but while the former failed to win in 1997, the latter did win in 2007. Jones created packaging for &quot;10,000 Days&quot; that features a pair of stereoscopic lenses for viewing 3-D artwork and photos. Jones, a lifelong fan of stereoscopic photography, wanted the packaging to be unique and to reflect the 1970s artwork he appreciates. The CD packaging for &quot;Fear Inoculum&quot; included a rechargeable 4 inch HD video screen and a speaker which played a hidden track along with a video when opened and also included a 36-page booklet.

===Live shows===
Following its first tours in the early 1990s, Tool has performed as a headline act in world tours and major festivals such as Lollapalooza (1997 and 2009), Coachella (1999 and 2006), Voodoo Fest (2001 and 2016), Download Festival (2006 and 2019), Roskilde (2001 and 2006), Big Day Out (2007 and 2011), Bonnaroo (2007 and 2022), All Points West Music &amp; Arts Festival (2009), and Epicenter (2009). They have been joined on stage by numerous artists such as Buzz Osborne and Scott Reeder on several occasions; Tom Morello and Zack de la Rocha during their 1991 tour; Layne Staley in Hawaii, 1993; Tricky, Robert Fripp, Mike Patton, Dave Lombardo, Brann Dailor of Mastodon, and experimental arts duo Osseus Labyrint during their 2001–02 &quot;Lateralus&quot; tour; and Kirk Hammett, Phil Campbell, Serj Tankian, and Tom Morello during their 2006–07 tour. They have covered songs by Led Zeppelin, Ted Nugent, Peach, Kyuss, the Dead Kennedys, and the Ramones.

Live shows on Tool&#x27;s headline tour incorporate an unorthodox stage setting and video display. Keenan and Carey line up in the back on elevated platforms, while Jones and Chancellor stand in the front, toward the sides of the stage. Keenan often faces the backdrop or the sides of the stage rather than the audience. No followspots or live cameras are used; instead, the band employs extensive backlighting to direct the focus away from the band members and toward large screens in the back and the crowd. Breckinridge Haggerty, the band&#x27;s live video designer, says that the resulting dark spaces on stage &quot;are mostly for Maynard&quot;. He explains, &quot;[a] lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when he&#x27;s trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience. He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows.&quot; The big screens are used to play back &quot;looped clips that aren&#x27;t tracked to a song like a music video. The band has never used any sort of timecode. They’ve always made sure the video can change on-the-fly, in a way that can be improvised. ... The show is never the same twice.&quot; During the &quot;10,000 Days&quot; tour, the video material consisted of over six hours of material, created by Jones, his wife Camella Grace, Chet Zar, Meats Meier, and Haggerty. Some of the material created by Zar has been released on his DVD &quot;Disturb the Normal&quot;.

<doc id="30979" wikidata="Q1196836" url="?curid=30979" title="The Six Million Dollar Man">
<text>The Six Million Dollar Man is an American science fiction and action adventure television series, running from 1973 to 1978, about a former astronaut, USAF Colonel Steve Austin, portrayed by Lee Majors. After being seriously injured in a NASA test flight crash, Austin is rebuilt (at considerable expense, hence the title of the series) with bionic implants that give him superhuman strength, speed and vision. Austin is then employed as a secret agent by a fictional U.S. government office titled OSI. The series was based on Martin Caidin&#x27;s 1972 novel &quot;Cyborg&quot;, which was the working title of the series during pre-production.

Following three television films intended as pilots, which all aired in 1973, &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; television series aired on the ABC network as a regular episodic series for five seasons from 1974 to 1978. Steve Austin became a pop culture icon of the 1970s.

A spin-off television series, &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, featuring the lead female character Jaime Sommers, ran from 1976 to 1978. During this time, several crossover episodes were produced. Three television movies featuring both bionic characters were also produced from 1987 to 1994.

==Plot==

===Original series===
When NASA astronaut USAF Colonel Steve Austin is severely injured in the crash of an experimental lifting body aircraft, he is &quot;rebuilt&quot; in an operation that costs $6 million (equivalent to $41.5 million in 2024). His right arm, both legs and left eye are replaced with &quot;bionic&quot; implants that enhance his strength, speed and vision far above human norms: he can run at speeds of over , and his eye has a 20:1 zoom lens and infrared capabilities, while his bionic limbs all have the equivalent power of a bulldozer. He uses his enhanced abilities to work for the OSI (Office of Scientific Intelligence) as a secret agent.

Caidin&#x27;s novel &quot;Cyborg&quot; was a best-seller when it was published in 1972. He followed it up with three sequels, &quot;Operation Nuke&quot;, &quot;High Crystal&quot;, and &quot;Cyborg IV&quot;, respectively about a black market in nuclear weapons, a &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; scenario, and fusing Austin&#x27;s bionic hardware to a spaceplane.

In March 1973, &quot;Cyborg&quot; was loosely adapted as a made-for-TV movie titled &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; starring Majors as Austin. The producers&#x27; first choice was Monte Markham. (When re-edited for the later series, it was re-titled &quot;The Moon and the Desert, Parts I and II&quot;.) The adaptation was done by writer Howard Rodman, working under the pseudonym of Henri Simoun. The film, which was nominated for a Hugo Award, modified Caidin&#x27;s plot and notably made Austin a civilian astronaut rather than a colonel in the United States Air Force. Absent were some of the standard features of the later series: the electronic sound effects, the slow-motion running, and the character of Oscar Goldman. Instead, another character named Oliver Spencer, played by Darren McGavin, was Austin&#x27;s supervisor, of an organization here called the Office of Strategic Operations, or &quot;OSO&quot;. (In the novels, &quot;OSO&quot; stood for Office of Special Operations. The CIA did have an Office of Scientific Intelligence in the 1970s.) The lead scientist involved in implanting Austin&#x27;s bionic hardware, Rudy Wells, was played in the pilot by Martin Balsam, then on an occasional basis in the series by Alan Oppenheimer, and, finally, as a series regular, by Martin E. Brooks. Austin did not use the enhanced capabilities of his bionic eye during the first TV movie.

The first movie was a major ratings success and was followed by two more made-for-TV movies in October and November 1973 as part of ABC&#x27;s rotating &quot;Movie of the Week&quot; series. The first was titled &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man: &quot;Wine, Women and War&quot;&quot;, and the second was titled &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man: &quot;The Solid Gold Kidnapping&quot;&quot;. The first of these two bore strong resemblances to Caidin&#x27;s second &quot;Cyborg&quot; novel, &quot;Operation Nuke&quot;; the second, however, was an original story. This was followed in January 1974 by the debut of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; as a weekly hour-long series. The latter two movies, produced by Glen A. Larson, notably introduced a James Bond flavor to the series and reinstated Austin&#x27;s status from the novels as an Air Force colonel; the hour-long series, produced by Harve Bennett, dispensed with the James Bond-gloss of the movies, and portrayed a more down-to-earth Austin. (Majors said of Austin, &quot;[He] hates...the whole idea of spying. He finds it repugnant, degrading. If he&#x27;s a James Bond, he&#x27;s the most reluctant one we&#x27;ve ever had.&quot;) Use of deadly force by Austin - frequent in Caidin&#x27;s novels and employed occasionally in the movies and early episodes - also decreased as the series progressed.

The show was very popular during its run and introduced several pop culture elements of the 1970s, such as the show&#x27;s opening catchphrase (&quot;We can rebuild him; we have the technology&quot;, voiced over by Richard Anderson in his role of Oscar Goldman), the slow motion action sequences, and the accompanying &quot;electronic&quot; sound effects. The slow motion action sequences were originally referred to as &quot;&quot;Kung Fu&quot; slow motion&quot; in popular culture (due to its use in that 1970s martial arts television series), although according to &quot;The Bionic Book&quot; by Herbie J. Pilato, the use of slow motion on the series was inspired by its use by NFL Films.

In 1975, a two-part episode titled &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, written for television by Kenneth Johnson, introduced the lead character Jaime Sommers (played by Lindsay Wagner), a professional tennis player who rekindled an old romance with Austin, only to experience a parachuting accident that resulted in her being given bionic parts similar to Austin. Ultimately, her body &quot;rejected&quot; her bionic hardware and she died. The character was very popular, however, and the following season it was revealed that she had survived, having been saved by an experimental cryogenic procedure, and she was given her own spin-off series, &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;. This spin-off ran until 1978 when both it and &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; were simultaneously cancelled, though the two series were on different networks when their final seasons aired.

===Television movie reunions===
Steve Austin and Jaime Sommers returned in three subsequent made-for-television movies: &quot;The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman&quot; (1987), &quot;Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman&quot; (1989) which featured Sandra Bullock in an early role as a new bionic woman; and &quot;Bionic Ever After?&quot; (1994) in which Austin and Sommers finally marry. Majors reprised the role of Steve Austin in all three productions, which also featured Richard Anderson and Martin E. Brooks, and Lindsay Wagner reprising the role of Jaime Sommers. The reunion films addressed the partial amnesia Sommers had suffered during the original series, and all three featured Majors&#x27; son, Lee Majors II, as OSI agent Jim Castillian. The first two movies were written in the anticipation of creating new bionic characters in their own series, but nothing further was seen of the new characters introduced in those produced. The third TV movie was intended as a finale.

==Cast==
* Steve Austin (played by Lee Majors), the lead character
* Oscar Goldman (played by Richard Anderson), Director of the OSI
* Rudy Wells (played by Martin Balsam, 1st pilot episode; Alan Oppenheimer, 2nd and 3rd pilot episodes, seasons 1 &amp; 2 and 1 episode in season 3; Martin E. Brooks, seasons 3–5, as well as on &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; and in three movies), Austin&#x27;s physician and primary overseer of the medical aspects of bionic technology
* Jaime Sommers (played by Lindsay Wagner—recurring)
* Peggy Callahan (played by Jennifer Darling—recurring), secretary to Oscar Goldman
* Oliver Spencer (played by Darren McGavin), director of the OSO in the pilot

==Production==
===Opening sequence===
The crash footage during the opening credits is from the M2-F2 crash that occurred on May 10, 1967. Test pilot Bruce Peterson&#x27;s lifting body aircraft hit the ground at approximately and tumbled six times, but Peterson survived what appeared to be a fatal accident, though he later lost an eye to infection. In the episode &quot;The Deadly Replay&quot;, Oscar Goldman refers to the lifting body aircraft in which Austin crashed as the HL-10, stating, &quot;We&#x27;ve rebuilt the HL-10.&quot; The HL-10 is the aircraft first seen in the original pilot movie before the accident flight. In the 1987 TV film &quot;The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman&quot;, Austin refers to the craft as the &quot;M3-F5&quot;, which was the name used for the aircraft that crashed in the original &quot;Cyborg&quot; novel.

In the opening sequence, a narrator (series producer Harve Bennett) identifies the protagonist, &quot;Steve Austin, astronaut. A man barely alive.&quot; Richard Anderson, in character as Oscar Goldman, then intones off-camera, &quot;Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We have the capability to make the world&#x27;s first bionic man. Steve Austin will &quot;be&quot; that man. Better than he was before. Better . . . stronger . . . faster.&quot; During the first season, beginning with &quot;Population: Zero&quot;, Anderson, as Goldman, intoned more simply, &quot;We can rebuild him. We have the technology. We can make him better than he was. Better . . . stronger . . . faster.&quot; During the operation, as his bionics are being fitted, a list of items and numbers is displayed and lists his power plant as &quot;atomic&quot;.

===Theme music===
The opening and closing credits of the &quot;Wine, Women &amp; War&quot; and &quot;The Solid Gold Kidnapping&quot; telefilms used a theme song written by Glen A. Larson, and sung by Dusty Springfield, backed by Ron &quot;Escalade&quot; Piscina. This song was also used in the initial promotion of the series.

However, when the weekly series began, the song was replaced by an instrumental theme by Oliver Nelson. The first regular episode, &quot;Population: Zero&quot;, introduced a new element to the opening sequence: a voiceover by Oscar Goldman stating the rationale behind creating a bionic man. The first season narration and opening credits arrangement of Nelson&#x27;s theme were shorter than that used in the second and subsequent seasons.

===Steve Austin&#x27;s bionics===
To maintain the show&#x27;s plausibility, producer Kenneth Johnson set very specific limits on Steve Austin&#x27;s abilities. He elaborated, &quot;When you&#x27;re dealing with the area of fantasy, if you say, &#x27;Well, they&#x27;re bionic so they can do whatever they want,&#x27; then it gets out of hand, so you&#x27;ve got to have really, really tight rules. [Steve and Jaime] can jump up two stories but not three. They can jump down three stories but not four.&quot;

Austin&#x27;s superhuman enhancements are:

* A bionic left eye:
: It has a 20.2:1 zoom lens along with a night vision function (as well as the restoration of normal vision). The figure of 20.2:1 is taken from the faux computer graphics in the opening credits; the figure 20:1 is mentioned twice in the series, in the episode &quot;Population: Zero&quot; and &quot;Secret of Bigfoot&quot;. Austin&#x27;s bionic eye also has other features, such as an infrared filter used frequently to see in the dark and also to detect heat (as in the episode &quot;The Pioneers&quot;), and the ability to view humanoid beings moving too fast for a normal eye to see (as in the story arc &quot;The Secret of Bigfoot&quot;). One early episode shows the eye as a deadly accurate targeting device for his throwing arm.
: In Caidin&#x27;s original novels, Austin&#x27;s eye was depicted as simply a camera (which had to be physically removed after use) and Austin remained blind in the eye. Later, Austin gained the ability to shoot a laser from the eye. The Charlton Comics comic book spin-off from the series also established that Austin&#x27;s bionic eye could shoot a laser beam (as demonstrated in the first issues of the color comic), but neither function was shown on television.

* Bionic legs:
: These allow him to run at tremendous speed and make great leaps. Austin&#x27;s upper speed limit was never firmly established, although a speed of is commonly quoted since this figure is shown on a speed gauge during the opening credits. The highest speed ever shown in the series on a speed gauge is in &quot;The Pal-Mir Escort&quot;; however, the later revival films suggested that he could run approximately . A faster top speed is possible, as an episode of the &quot;Bionic Woman&quot; spin-off entitled &quot;Winning Is Everything&quot; shows female cyborg Jaime Sommers outrunning a race car going . In &quot;Secret of Bigfoot&quot; it is stated that he can leap high. In the later TV movies, Austin is shown leaping heights that clearly appear to be far in excess of this.

* A bionic right arm:
: It has the equivalent strength of a bulldozer; that the arm contains a Geiger counter was established in &quot;Doomsday and Counting&quot;, the sixth episode of the first season.

The implants have a major flaw in that extreme cold interferes with their functions and can disable them given sufficient exposure. However, when Austin returns to a warmer temperature, the implants quickly regain full functionality. The first season also established that Austin&#x27;s bionics malfunction in the micro-gravity of space, though Austin&#x27;s bionics are later modified to rectify this. The bionic eye is vulnerable to ultrasonic attack, resulting in blindness and dizziness. It is not explained how Austin&#x27;s organic body is able to withstand the stress of either bionic hardware weight or performance of superhuman feats.

To indicate to viewers that Austin was using his bionic enhancements, sequences with him performing superhuman tasks were presented in slow-motion and accompanied by an electronic &quot;dit dit dit dit&quot; sound effect. (This characteristic sound effect was actually first used in season 1 episode 4, &quot;Day of the Robot&quot;, not during use of Austin&#x27;s bionics but with the robotic clone of Major Fred Sloan, played by actor John Saxon, during the final fight scene.) When the bionic eye was used, the camera zoomed in on Austin&#x27;s face, followed by an extreme close-up of his eye; his point of view usually included a crosshair motif accompanied by a beeping sound-effect. In early episodes, different ways of presenting Austin&#x27;s powers were tested, including a heartbeat sound effect that predated the electronic sound, and in the three original made-for-TV movies, no sound effects or slow-motion were used, with Austin&#x27;s actions shown at normal speed (except for his running, which used trick photography); the slow-motion portrayal was introduced with the first hour-long episode, &quot;Population: Zero&quot;.

==Episodes==

The series consists of three TV-movies, five seasons of episodes, and three more TV-movies.

==Novels==
Martin Caidin wrote four novels featuring his original version of Steve Austin beginning in 1972 with &quot;Cyborg&quot;. Although several other writers such as Mike Jahn later wrote a number of novelizations based upon the TV series, in most cases these writers chose to base their character upon the literary version of Austin rather than the TV show version. As a result, several of the novelizations have entire scenes and in one case an ending that differed from the original episodes, as the cold-blooded killer of Caidin&#x27;s novels handled things somewhat differently from his non-killing TV counterpart. For example, the Jahn book &quot;International Incidents&quot;, an adaptation of the episode &quot;Love Song for Tanya&quot;, ends with Austin using the poison dart gun in his bionic hand to kill an enemy agent; since the TV version of the character lacked this weapon, the villain was simply captured in the episode as broadcast.

===Original novels===
(all by Martin Caidin)
* &quot;Cyborg&quot; (1972)
* &quot;Operation Nuke&quot; (1973)
* &quot;High Crystal&quot; (1974)
* &quot;Cyborg IV&quot; (1975)

(Of the above, only &quot;Cyborg&quot; was adapted for television.)

===Novelizations===
* &quot;Wine, Women and War&quot; – Mike Jahn
* &quot;Solid Gold Kidnapping&quot; – Evan Richards
* &quot;Pilot Error&quot; – Jay Barbree
* &quot;The Rescue of Athena One&quot; – Jahn (two similarly themed episodes combined into one storyline)
* &quot;The Secret of Bigfoot Pass&quot; (UK title, &quot;The Secret of Bigfoot&quot;) – Jahn
* &quot;International Incidents&quot; – Jahn (this volume adapted several episodes into one interconnected storyline)

==Other adaptations==
===Comics===
Charlton Comics published both a color comic book and a black and white, illustrated magazine, featuring original adventures as well as differing adaptations of the original TV movie. While the comic book was closely based upon the series, and geared toward a young audience, the magazine was darker and more violent and seemed to be based more upon the literary version of the character, aimed at adult readers. Both magazines were cancelled around the same time the TV series ended. Artists Howard Chaykin and Neal Adams were frequent contributors to both publications. Steve Kahn, who had previously published magazines on the Beatles and the teen fan magazine FLiP, worked with MCA and Charlton in overseeing and publishing these books.

A British comic strip version was also produced, written by Angus P. Allan, drawn by Martin Asbury and printed in TV comic &quot;Look-In&quot; (around the time both TV series ended in 1978, it and &quot;Look-In&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Bionic Woman&quot; strip merged into one title called &quot;Bionic Action&quot;). A series of standalone comic strips was printed on the packaging of a series of model kits by Fundimensions based upon the series. In Colombia, a black and white comic book series was published in the late 70s, with art and stories by Jorge Peña. This series was licensed by Universal studios to Greco (Grupo Editorial Colombiano), then known as Editora Cinco, now part of Grupo Editorial Televisa. In France, &quot;Télé-Junior&quot;, a magazine devoted to comic book adaptations of all sorts of TV series and cartoons also featured a &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot; comic (under its French title, &quot;L&#x27;Homme qui valait trois milliards&quot;, i.e. &quot;The Three Billion Dollar Man&quot;) with art by Pierre Le Goff and stories by P. Tabet and Bodis. A tradepaperback reprinting several episodes from the magazine was released in October, 1980.

In 1996, a new comic book series entitled &quot;Bionix&quot; was announced, to be published by Maximum Press. The comic was to have been an updated version of both the &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and the &quot;Bionic Woman&quot; and feature new renditions of the two characters. Although the magazine was advertised in comic book trade publications, it was ultimately never published.

On August 24, 2011, Dynamite Comics published the first issue of &quot;The Bionic Man&quot;, an adaptation written by Kevin Smith based upon a screenplay he&#x27;d written for a never-produced 1990s motion picture version of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;. After concluding the adaptation in the spring of 2012 the comic series moved on to original stories, as well as a re-imagining of the original TV series&#x27; &quot;Secret of Bigfoot&quot; storyline. A spin-off comic re-imagining &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; followed a few months later, and in January 2013 Dynamite launched a crossover mini-series, &quot;The Bionic Man vs. The Bionic Woman&quot;. The artwork in these series, covers and interiors, varies between Austin being rendered in the likeness of Lee Majors and not. As 2014 began, Dynamite discontinued its reboot titles and replaced them with a new ongoing series, &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man Season 6&quot;, continuing the adventures of Austin from the conclusion of the 1977–78 season and featuring not only the likeness of Lee Majors, but also other recurring actors such as Richard Anderson, as well as Darren McGavin as Oliver Spencer from the first TV movie. Jaime Sommers was reintroduced from issue 3, with a spin-off comic series, &quot;The Bionic Woman Season 4&quot;, announced in June 2014 with a scheduled launch in the fall of 2014. Dynamite has since published crossover titles pairing Jaime with characters from &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; and the Lynda Carter version of DC Comics&#x27; Wonder Woman, and a crossover featuring Steve encountering characters from &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;.

===Audiobooks===
Peter Pan Records and its sister company Power Records published several record albums featuring original dramatized stories (including an adaptation of the pilot film), several of which were also adapted as comic books designed to be read along with the recording. Three albums&#x27; worth of stories were released, one of which featured Christmas-themed stories. Individual stories were also released in other formats, including singles.

===Film===
Universal Pictures developed a screenplay in 1995 with Kevin Smith, but the outing never materialized. In December 2001, it was announced that Universal had pacted with Dimension Films on the project after Dimension president Bob Weinstein saw its potential as a franchise. Universal retained film rights to the original TV show, while Dimension purchased the rights to the &quot;Cyborg&quot; novel, as well as Caidin&#x27;s three other novels in the series: &quot;Operation Nuke&quot;, &quot;High Crystal&quot; and &quot;Cyborg IV&quot;. Larry Gordon and Scott Faye were going to produce with Paul Rosenberg&#x27;s Collision Entertainment. Smith&#x27;s screenplay was later adapted for &quot;The Bionic Man&quot;, an ongoing comic book series launched in 2011 by Dynamite Comics.

In October 2002, Trevor Sands was hired to write a new screenplay, titled &quot;The Six Billion Dollar Man&quot;, but Dimension scrapped it when actor Jim Carrey pitched a comedic take on the material for him to star in, with Scot Armstrong as writer and Todd Phillips as director/co-writer. Filming was expected to begin in 2004.

In a July 2006 interview at San Diego Comic-Con, Richard Anderson (who played Oscar Goldman in the series) stated that he was involved with producing a movie of the series, but the rights were at the time in litigation between Miramax and Universal.

On November 6, 2014, it was announced that a feature film, tentatively titled &quot;The Six Billion Dollar Man&quot;, would go into production. Mark Wahlberg was set to play Colonel Steve Austin, with Peter Berg as director. Filming was to begin in early 2015, for a theatrical release the following year. On November 2, 2015, it was reported that Berg had left the film and had been replaced by Damian Szifron, who will also write the film. Filming was to begin in September 2016 with a December 22, 2017 release date.

In December 2017, The Weinstein Company sold the film&#x27;s rights to Warner Bros. As of January 2018, they hoped to start filming the movie in mid 2018. In April 2018, they set an early to mid 2019 release for the film. The film was moved to June 5, 2020, until &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot; took over the release date, and in April 2019, Travis Knight and Bill Dubuque replaced Szifron as director and writer.

==Cultural influence==
In Brazil, under the military dictatorship, some important government officials, previously elected by direct suffrage, were appointed by the president, or elected indirectly, out of a shortlist picked by the president. These politicians were called &quot;bionic&quot; (&quot;biônicos&quot;), due to the series&#x27; popularity, and the association with the perceived extraordinary power and influence held by the appointed officials. Between 1964 and 1985, Brazil came to have &quot;bionic&quot; senators, governors and mayors. With the 1988 Constitution of Brazil, all &quot;bionic&quot; appointments were abolished.

In Israel, the series was retitled &quot;The Man Worth Millions&quot; since &quot;six million&quot; evoked memories of The Holocaust; specifically the most commonly quoted estimate of the number of Jewish victims.

In Indonesia, the comedy group Warkop released a 1981 parody comedy film of the series &quot;&quot;, with the title being simply a direct translation.

==Award==
In 2003, Lee Majors won TV Land&#x27;s &quot;Superest Superhero&quot; award.

==Home media==
Universal Playback released the first two seasons of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; on DVD in Region 2 and Region 4 in 2005–2006. The first three seasons were also released on the Italian market (Region 2) in late 2008. The season 1 release also features the three pilot movies that preceded the weekly series.

The Region 1 (North American) release, along with that of &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; was one of the most eagerly awaited; its release had been withheld for many years due to copyright issues regarding the original novel. In fact, with the exception of a few episodes released in the DiscoVision format in the early 1980s and a single VHS release of the two-part &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; storyline that same decade, the series as a whole had never been released in North America in any home video format.

On July 21, 2010, Time Life (under license from Universal) announced the release of a complete series box set of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on November 23, 2010. The 40-disc set features all 99 episodes of the series as well as the three pilot films and the three reunion TV-movies which also feature Jaime Sommers, along with several episodes of &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; that were part of inter-series crossovers (i.e. part one aired on one series, and part two on another) in order to include complete storylines. In addition, the set features extensive bonus features including interviews and featurettes with all major cast members and the set comes encased in collectible packaging that includes a sound chip, activated when the box is opened, that plays back part of the first season opening credits dialogue. The release is available directly through Time-Life&#x27;s &quot;6mdm&quot; website as well a through several third-party on-line vendors.

In November 2011, Universal Pictures began releasing individual season sets of the series on DVD, available in retail stores. It has subsequently released all five seasons. The fifth and final season was released on February 18, 2014.

Several episodes of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; actually saw their North American DVD debut several weeks in advance of the box set, as Universal Home Video included the three &quot;crossover&quot; episodes that helped launch &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; as bonuses on the October 19, 2010 DVD release of Season 1 of &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;.

On October 13, 2015, Universal Pictures released a retail version of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man - The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

In Region 2, Fabulous Films acquired the rights to the series in 2012 and subsequently released seasons 3–5 on DVD on October 1, 2012. It also re-released the first two seasons on February 25, 2013. A 40-disc complete series boxset was released on April 2, 2012.

On May 2, 2022, Shout Factory announced the complete series is scheduled to be released on Blu-ray July 12, 2022. It will also feature crossover episodes and six films.

<text>A Tory () is an individual who supports a political philosophy known as Toryism, based on a British version of traditionalist conservatism which upholds the established social order as it has evolved through the history of Great Britain. The Tory ethos has been summed up with the phrase &quot;God, King (or Queen), and Country&quot;. Tories are monarchists, were historically of a high church Anglican religious heritage, and were opposed to the liberalism of the Whig party.

The philosophy originates from the Cavaliers, a royalist faction which supported the House of Stuart during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The Tories, a British political party which emerged during the late 17th century, was a reaction to the Whig-controlled Parliaments that succeeded the Cavalier Parliament. As a political term, Tory was a term derived from the Irish language, that was first used in English politics during the Exclusion Crisis of 1678–1681.

It also has exponents in other parts of the former British Empire, such as the Loyalists of British America, who opposed secession during the American War of Independence. Loyalists who fled to the Canadas at the end of the conflict, known as the United Empire Loyalists, formed the support base for political cliques in Upper and Lower Canada. Toryism remains prominent in the politics of Canada and the United Kingdom. The British Conservative Party and Conservative Party of Canada, and their supporters, continue to be referred to as Tories. Adherents to traditional Toryism in contemporary times are referred to as High Tories, who typically defend the ideas of hierarchy, natural order, and aristocracy.

==Etymology==
The word Tory originates from an Irish term that was phonetically anglicised. Several Irish words have been suggested as the etymological root for the word &quot;Tory&quot;. The Irish word &quot;toruidhe&quot; or &quot;toruighe&quot;, meaning &quot;to pursue&quot; or &quot;to hunt&quot;, is suggested as the origin for the term &quot;Tory&quot;. From the 1500s to 1600s, the term &quot;Tory&quot; first emerged to refer to the Irish who were dispossessed of their lands and took to the woods, forming themselves into bands that subsisted on wild animals and goods taken from settlers. After these activities were suppressed, the term lost its original signification with English-speakers and was used to describe &quot;an outlaw papist&quot; or a &quot;robber that is noted for outrages and cruelty&quot;. The Irish peasantry also used the term &quot;Tory&quot; to refer to an outlaw or a miscreant of any kind into the 19th century. However, because later Conservative and anti-revolutionary parties assumed the term &quot;Tory&quot;, it has also been suggested that the word originated from the Irish word &quot;toir&quot;, meaning to give, grant and bestow; or &quot;toirbhearl&quot;, meaning efficiency, bounty or munificence.

By the 1640s, the term was used in the English language to refer to dispossessed Irish Catholics. It was also used to refer to isolated Irish rebels and guerrillas resisting Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s conquest of Ireland, who were allied with Cavaliers through treaty with the Parliament of Confederate Ireland. It was later used to refer to dispossessed Catholic Irish in Ulster following the Restoration. Tory was also used to refer to a rapparee and later applied to Confederates or Cavaliers in arms.

The term &quot;Tory&quot; was first introduced in England by Titus Oates, who used the term to describe individuals from Ireland sent to assassinate him and his supporters. Oates continued to refer to his opponents as &quot;Tories&quot; until his death. The word entered English politics during the 1680s, emerging as a pejorative term to describe supporters of James II of England during the Exclusion Crisis and his hereditary right to inherit the throne despite his Catholic religion. After this, the term &quot;Tory&quot; began to be used as a colloquial term, alongside the word &quot;Whig&quot;, to describe the two major political factions/parties in British politics. Initially, both terms were used in a pejorative manner, although both later became acceptable terms to use in literary speech to describe either political party. The suffix &quot;-ism&quot; was quickly added to both &quot;Whig&quot; and &quot;Tory&quot; to make Whiggism and Toryism, meaning the principles and methods of each faction.

During the American Revolution, the term &quot;Tory&quot; was used interchangeably with the term &quot;Loyalist&quot; in the Thirteen Colonies to refer to colonists who remained loyal to the Crown during the conflict. The term contrasts the colloquial term used to describe supporters of the revolution, &quot;Patriots&quot; or &quot;Whigs&quot;.

Towards the end of Charles II&#x27;s reign (1660–1685) there was some debate about whether his brother, James, Duke of York, should be allowed to accede to the throne because of James&#x27;s Catholicism. &quot;Whigs&quot;, originally a reference to Scottish cattle-drovers (stereotypically radical anti-Catholic Covenanters), was the abusive term directed at those who wanted to exclude James on the grounds that he was a Catholic. Those who were not prepared to exclude James were labelled &quot;Abhorrers&quot; and later &quot;Tories&quot;. Titus Oates applied the term &quot;Tory&quot;, which then signified an Irish robber, to those who would not believe in his Popish Plot and the name gradually became extended to all who were supposed to have sympathy with the Catholic Duke of York.

===United Kingdom===

The Tory political faction originally emerged within the Parliament of England to uphold the legitimist rights of James II to succeed his brother Charles II to the thrones of the three kingdoms. James became a Catholic at a time when the state institutions were fiercely independent from the Catholic Church—this was an issue for the Exclusion Crisis supporting Patricians, the political heirs to the nonconformist Roundheads and Covenanters. During the Exclusion Crisis, the word Tory was applied in the Kingdom of England as a nickname to the opponents of the bill, called the Abhorrers. The word &quot;Tory&quot; had connotations of Papist and outlaw derived from its previous use in Ireland.

There were two Tory ministries after James II acceded to the throne: the first led by the Earl of Rochester, the second by Lord Belasyse. A significant faction took part in the Glorious Revolution the military coup d&#x27;état that ousted James II with the Whigs to defend the Church of England and definitive Protestantism. A large but dwindling faction of Tories continued to support James in exile and his Stuart heirs to the throne, especially in 1714 after the Hanoverian Succession by George I, the first Hanoverian monarch. Although only a minority of Tories gave their adhesion to the Jacobite risings, this was used by the Whigs to discredit the Tories and paint them as traitors. After the advent of the Prime Ministerial system under the Whig Robert Walpole, Lord Bute&#x27;s premiership in the reign of George III marked a revival. Under the Corn Laws (1815–1846) a majority of Tories supported protectionist agrarianism with tariffs being imposed at the time for higher food prices, self-sufficiency and enhanced wages in rural employment.

English Tories from the time of the Glorious Revolution up until the Reform Act 1832 were characterised by strong monarchist tendencies, support for the Church of England and hostility to radical reform, while the Tory party was an actual organisation which held power intermittently throughout the same period. Conservatism began to emerge in the late 18th century—it synthesised moderate Whig economic policies and many Tory social values to create a new political philosophy and faction in opposition to the French Revolution. Edmund Burke and William Pitt the Younger led the way in this. Interventionism and strong armed forces were to prove a hallmark of Toryism under subsequent prime ministers. The word &quot;Conservative&quot; began to be used in place of Tory during the 1830s, as Robert Peel&#x27;s followers began to re-interpret elements of Tory tradition under a banner of support for social reform and free trade. The party was eventually succeeded by the Conservative and Unionist Party, with the term &quot;Tory&quot; enduring to become an interchangeable phrase with &quot;Conservative&quot;.

===Canada===

The term &quot;Tory&quot; was first used to designate the pre-Confederation British ruling classes of Upper Canada and Lower Canada, known as the Family Compact and the Château Clique, an elite within the governing classes and often members within a section of society known as the United Empire Loyalists. The United Empire Loyalists were American loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies who resettled elsewhere in British North America during or after the American Revolutionary War.

In post-Confederation Canada, the terms &quot;Red Tory&quot; and &quot;Blue Tory&quot; have long been used to describe the two wings of the Conservative and previously the Progressive Conservative (PC) parties. The dyadic tensions originally arose out of the 1854 political union of British-Canadian Tories, French-Canadian traditionalists and the monarchist and loyalist leaning sections of the emerging commercial classes at the time—many of whom were uncomfortable with the pro-American and annexationist tendencies within the liberal Clear Grits. Tory strength and prominence in the political culture was a feature of life in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Ontario and Manitoba.

By the 1930s, the factions within Canadian Toryism were associated with either the urban business elites, or with rural traditionalists from the country&#x27;s hinterland. A &quot;Red Tory&quot; is a member of the more moderate wing of the party (in the manner of John Farthing and George Grant). They are generally unified by their adherence to British traditions in Canada.

Throughout the course of Canadian history, the Conservative Party was generally controlled by MacDonaldian Tory elements, which in Canada meant an adherence to the English-Canadian traditions of Monarchy, Empire-Commonwealth, parliamentary government, nationalism, protectionism, social reform and eventually acceptance of the necessity of the welfare state.

By the 1970s, the Progressive Conservative Party was a Keynesian-consensus party. With the onset of stagflation in the 1970s, some Canadian Tories came under the influence of neo-liberal developments in the United Kingdom and the United States, which highlighted the policies for privatization and supply-side interventions. In Canada, these Tories have been labelled neoconservatives—which has a somewhat different connotation in the United States. By the early 1980s, there was no clear neoconservative in the Tory leadership cadre, but Brian Mulroney (who became leader in 1983) eventually came to adopt many policies from the Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan governments.

As Mulroney took the Progressive Conservative Party further in this direction, with policy initiatives in the areas of deregulation, privatization, free-trade and a consumption tax called the Goods and services tax (GST), many traditionally-minded Tories became concerned that a political and cultural schism was occurring within the party.

The 1986 creation of the Reform Party of Canada attracted some of the neo-liberals and social conservatives away from the Tory party and as some of the neoconservative policies of the Mulroney government proved unpopular, some of the provincial-rights elements moved towards Reform as well. In 1993, Mulroney resigned rather than fight an election based on his record after almost nine years in power. This left the Progressive Conservatives in disarray and scrambling to understand how to make Toryism relevant in provinces such as Quebec, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia that had never had a strong Tory tradition and political culture.

Thereafter in the 1990s, the Progressive Conservatives were a small party in the House of Commons of Canada and could only exert legislative pressure on the government through their power in the Senate of Canada. Eventually, through death and retirements, this power waned. Joe Clark returned as leader, but the schism with the Reformers effectively watered down the combined Blue and Red Tory vote in Canada.

By the late 1990s, there was talk of the necessity of uniting the right in Canada, to deter further Liberal Party majorities. Many Tories—both red and blue—opposed such moves, while others took the view that all would have to be pragmatic if there was any hope of reviving a strong party system. The Canadian Alliance party (as the Reform Party had become) and some leading Tories came together on an informal basis to see if they could find common ground. While Progressive Conservative Leader Joe Clark rebuffed the notion, the talks moved ahead and eventually in December 2003, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative parties voted to rejoin into a new party called the Conservative Party of Canada.

After the merger of the Progressive Conservatives with the Canadian Alliance in 2003, there was debate as to whether the &quot;Tory&quot; appellation should survive at the federal level. Commentators speculated that some Alliance members would take offence to the term. Nevertheless, it was officially adopted by the merged party during the 2004 leadership convention. Stephen Harper, former leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and Prime Minister from 2006 to 2015, regularly refers to himself as a Tory and says the new party is a natural evolution of the conservative political movement. However, there were some dissident Red Tories who were against the merger. They formed the rival Progressive Canadian Party.

===United States===
The term &quot;Loyalist&quot; was used in the American Revolution for those who remained loyal to the British Crown. About 80% of the Loyalists remained in the United States after the war. The 60,000 or so Loyalists who settled in Nova Scotia, Quebec, the Bahamas, or returned to Great Britain after the American War of Independence are known as United Empire Loyalists.

On 12 February 1798, Thomas Jefferson (of the Democratic-Republican Party) described the conservative Federalist Party as &quot;[a] political Sect [...] believing that the executive is the branch of our government which the most needs support, [who] are called federalists, sometimes aristocrats or monocrats, and sometimes Tories, after the corresponding sect in the English Government of exactly the same definition&quot;. However, that was clearly a hostile description by the Federalists&#x27; foes of whom Jefferson was one and not a name used by the Federalists themselves. The Federalist Party was dissolved in 1835 with no successor parties.

Later the Democratic-Republican Party splintered in different parties, with the two dissidences being the National Republican Party and the Whig Party. The rest of the party would become the Democratic Party. The National Republican Party would then merge with the Whig Party, giving rise to what would be called the Second Party System. Although the Whig Party adopted its name from its British counterpart, the term &quot;Tories&quot; had already completely fallen out of favour in the US.

During the American Civil War, Confederate forces commonly referred to Southern Unionists as &quot;Tories&quot;, drawing a parallel with the Tories of the American Revolutionary War. To the Confederates, Southern Unionists symbolized a direct challenge to their political aspirations and were viewed as &quot;traitors to the white race&quot;. Conversely, Unionists regarded Southern Unionists as a loyal segment of the Southern population, swept by the tide of succession, and whom the foundations of Reconstruction would be built.

====Texas Revolution====
In Texas in 1832–1836, support for the Texas Revolution was not unanimous. The &quot;Tories&quot; were men who supported the Mexican government. The Tories generally were long-term property holders whose roots were outside of the lower south. They typically had little interest in politics and sought conciliation rather than war. The Tories wanted to preserve the economic, political and social gains that they enjoyed as citizens of Mexico and the revolution threatened to jeopardize those gains.

==Current usage==
&quot;Tory&quot; has become shorthand for a member of the Conservative Party or for the party in general in Canada and the UK, and can be used interchangeably with the word &quot;Conservative&quot;.

===North America===
In the United States, &quot;Tory&quot; is often used as a historical term to describe supporters of Great Britain during the American Revolution. However, in Canadian parlance, British supporters during the revolution are called &quot;Loyalists&quot;, with the term &quot;Tory&quot; being used as a contemporary political term.

In Canada, a &quot;Tory&quot; refers to a member of the Conservative Party of Canada, while the party as a whole are colloquially referred to as the &quot;Tories&quot;. It is also used to refer to the party&#x27;s predecessor, including the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. In addition to the federal Conservative Party, the terms have also been used to describe provincial Conservative/Progressive Conservative parties and their members. LGBTory is an advocacy group for LGBT supporters of the Conservative Party of Canada and provincial conservative parties.

The terms &quot;Blue Tory&quot; and &quot;Red Tory&quot; describe two factions of Canada&#x27;s federal and provincial conservative parties. The former leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, Tim Hudak, adopted the term &quot;Purple Tory&quot; to characterize himself, aiming to avoid the strong ideological stance and instead provide a conciliatory position between Blue Tories and Red Tories. The term &quot;Pink Tory&quot; is also used by Canadian politics as a pejorative term to describe a conservative party member who is perceived as liberal.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, the Conservative and Unionist Party is often colloquially referred to as the &quot;Tories&quot;, both by themselves and by opponents, and also in the media. Members and voters of the party are also often referred to as &quot;Tories&quot; as well. The British Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s own style guide permits the use of the term &quot;Tory&quot;, although requires the term &quot;Conservative&quot; be used in its first instance.

In Scotland, the term &quot;Tory&quot; is used to describe members and supporters of the Scottish Conservatives, or to accuse other parties of being insufficiently opposed to that party. For example, members and supporters of the Scottish Labour Party (especially those from the &quot;Blairite and Brownite&quot; factions) may be referred to as &quot;Red Tories&quot; by traditional Labour members and advocates of an independent Scotland such as members and supporters of the Scottish National Party, the Alba Party (formerly Solidarity), the Scottish Socialist Party and the Scottish Greens. Similarly, Labour supporters have referred to SNP members and supporters as being &quot;Tartan Tories&quot;.

===Australia===
In Australia, &quot;Tory&quot; is occasionally used as a pejorative term by members of the Australian Labor Party to refer to conservative members of the Liberal Party of Australia and National Party of Australia parties (who are in a long-standing coalition). The term is not used anywhere near as often as in the UK and Canada, and it is rare – though not unheard of – for members of those parties to self-describe as &#x27;Tories&#x27;.

Writing in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Michael Persse notes the impact of &#x27;Liberal Toryism&#x27; on the colonial era Australian statesman William Charles Wentworth when he was in Britain. Chief Justice Garfield Barwick titled his memoir &quot;A Radical Tory&quot;. The newspaper of the University of Sydney Conservative Club is named &quot;The Sydney Tory&quot;. A moderate faction of the Australian Greens has been pejoratively dubbed the &quot;Tree Tories&quot; by the hard left faction.

<doc id="30981" wikidata="Q17978" url="?curid=30981" title="Toronto Transit Commission">
<text>The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) is the primary public transport agency in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, operating the majority of the city&#x27;s bus and rail services. It is the oldest and largest of the urban transit service providers in the Greater Toronto Area, with numerous connections to systems serving its surrounding municipalities.

Established as the Toronto Transportation Commission in 1921, the TTC owns and operates three rapid transit lines with 70 stations, over 150 bus routes, and 9 streetcar lines. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of . The TTC is the most heavily used urban mass transit system in Canada.

==History==

Public transit in Toronto started in 1849 with a privately operated transit service. In later years, the city operated some routes, but in 1921 assumed control over all routes and formed the Toronto Transportation Commission to operate them. During this period, streetcars provided the bulk of the service. In 1954, the TTC adopted its present name, opened the first subway line, and greatly expanded its service area to cover the newly formed municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (which eventually amalgamated into the present City of Toronto). The system has evolved to feature a wide network of surface routes with the subway lines as the backbone. On February 17, 2008, the TTC made many service improvements, reversing more than a decade of service reductions and only minor improvements.

In addition to buses, streetcars, and subways, the TTC also operated the Toronto Island ferry service from 1927 to 1962, when it was transferred to the Metro Parks and Culture department (now Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation). The TTC also operated a suburban and regional intercity bus operator, Gray Coach Lines, from 1927 to 1990. Gray Coach used interurban coaches to link Toronto to points throughout southern Ontario. In addition, Gray Coach operated tour buses in association with Gray Line Tours. The main terminal was the Metropolitan Toronto Bus Terminal on Elizabeth Street north of Dundas Street, downtown. In 1954, Gray Coach expanded further when it acquired suburban routes from independent bus operators not merged with the TTC as it expanded to cover Metro Toronto. By the 1980s, Gray Coach faced fierce competition in the interurban service in the GTA. The TTC sold Gray Coach Lines in 1990 to Stagecoach Holdings, which split the operation between Greyhound Canada and the government of Ontario three years later.

The Gloucester subway cars, the first version of TTC subway cars, known as &quot;red rockets&quot; because of their bright red exterior, have been retired. The current T-series trains also have a red interior color scheme. The name lives on as the TTC uses the phrase to advertise the service, such as &quot;Ride the Rocket&quot; in advertising material, &quot;Rocket&quot; in the names of some express buses, and the new &quot;Toronto Rocket&quot; subway cars, which began revenue operation on July 21, 2011. Another common slogan is &quot;The Better Way&quot;.

===Finances===
The TTC recovered 69.6 percent of its operating costs from the fare box in 2017. From its creation in 1921 until 1971, the TTC was self-supporting both for capital and operations (it had to pay property taxes until 1967). Through the Great Depression and World War II, it accumulated reserves that allowed it to expand considerably after the war, both with subways and major steady growth of its bus services into the suburbs. It was not until 1971 that the Metro Toronto government and the province started to provide operational funding, required primarily due to rising costs of delivering transit to low-density suburbs in Metro Toronto and large wage increases. Deficits and government funding soared throughout the 1970s and 1980s, followed by service cuts and a period of ridership decline in the 1990s, partly attributable to recession.

In 1997, the Progressive Conservative government under Premier Mike Harris implemented the &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot; which, among other things, cut in provincial financing support for the Eglinton West subway line, and cut $718million in municipal transit support, placing the entire burden of financing the system on municipalities and leaving the TTC with a $95.8million/year funding shortfall. The TTC cut back service with a significant curtailment put into effect on February 18, 1996. Since then, the TTC has consistently been in financial difficulties. Service cuts were averted in 2007, though, when Toronto City Council voted to introduce new taxes to help pay for city services, including the TTC. As a result, since 2011, the TTC became the largest transit operator in Anglo-America not to receive provincial or state funding. The TTC has received federal funding for capital projects from as early as 2009. The TTC is also considered one of the costliest transit systems per fare price in North America. For the 2011 operating year, the TTC had a projected operating budget of $1.45billion. Revenue from fares covered approximately 70 percent of the budget, whereas the remaining 30 percent originated from the City. From 2009 through 2011, provincial and federal funding amounted to 0 percent of the budget. In contrast to this, the Société de transport de Montréal receives approximately 10 percent of its operating budget from the Quebec provincial government, and OC Transpo receives 9 percent of its funding from the province. The fairness of preferentially funding transit in specific Canadian cities has been questioned by citizens.

On August 12, 2020, the Province of Ontario promised $404million for TTC operations to compensate for reduced ridership and revenue loss during the COVID-19 pandemic, with more funding to come later. The TTC projected a shortfall of $700million in 2020.

==Operations==
===Buses===
Buses are a large part of TTC operations today. However, before about 1960, they played a minor role compared to streetcars. Buses began to operate in the city in 1921, and became necessary for areas without streetcar service. After an earlier experiment in the 1920s, trolley buses were used on a number of routes starting in 1947, but all trolley bus routes were converted to bus operation between 1991 and 1993. The TTC always used the term &quot;trolley coach&quot; to refer to its trackless electric vehicles. Hundreds of old buses have been replaced with the low-floor Orion VII, and the TTC has acquired many hybrid electric buses. The TTC&#x27;s hybrid buses were first put on the road in 2006; these were followed by the newer 500 Orion VII Next Generation Hybrids in 2008. A new order brought the total number of hybrids to over 500, second only to New York City. Older TTC Orion VIIs from 2001 to 2006 feature the standard &quot;breadbox&quot; style, whereas newer buses, from 2007 onwards, feature Orion&#x27;s new, more stylish body. With a total of 2,031 buses, the TTC is the third-largest transit bus operator in North America, behind the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City (more than 5,600) and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (2,911).

The TTC also runs Wheel-Trans, a paratransit service for the physically disabled with special low-floor buses designed to accommodate wheelchairs and to make boarding easier for ambulatory customers with limited mobility.

The TTC ordered 153 Nova LFS Artic articulated buses with all newly ordered buses in service by January 2015. At long, the Nova LFS Artics hold about 112 passengers, compared with 65 on a standard bus.

===Subway===
The Toronto subway system consists of three lines:

* Line 1 Yonge–University: Canada&#x27;s first subway line. A U-shaped mostly north–south line that opened in 1954 and was last extended in 2017.
* Line 2 Bloor–Danforth: An east–west line that opened in 1966 and was last extended in 1980.
* Line 4 Sheppard: An east–west line that opened in 2002.

From 1985 until 2023, Line 3 Scarborough, a partly elevated light metro line served the district of Scarborough.

The three subway lines are served by 678 cars grouped in trains of four cars on Line 4 Sheppard, and six cars on Line 1 Yonge–University and Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. The three subway lines share non-revenue track connections and use the same technology. The rolling stock in use consists of the Toronto Rocket trains on Lines 1 and 4 and the T-series trains on Line 2. Line 3 Scarborough had a fleet of 28 S-series cars grouped into trains of four cars each and was not compatible with other subway lines, given that the S-series cars used . It shared no track connections or equipment. Due to the increasing difficulty of performing critical maintenance work on the S-series trains, the existing Line 3 Scarborough service was initially scheduled to be decommissioned permanently in November 2023; instead, the line closed four months ahead of schedule after a derailment on July 24, 2023. The line has been replaced by TTC bus service until the Line 2 Scarborough subway extension to Sheppard and McCowan opens for revenue service in 2030 at the earliest.

All subway lines provide service seven days a week from approximately 5:45 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. the following day (last train runs at approximately 1:45 a.m. in each direction) except for Sundays, when start of service is delayed until approximately 8:00 a.m. During the overnight periods, the subway and its stations are closed to enable maintenance at track level and in the stations themselves. Overnight service is provided by buses and streetcars operating above ground. These overnight routes are issued numbers in the 300-series and are referred to as Blue Night routes, indicated by a typical TTC bus stop sign with a blue band added.

====Projects under construction====

Line 5 Eglinton, which uses light rail vehicles, is under construction. It will run underground in the central part of the line from west of Keele Street to Laird Drive, with most of the remainder of the route travelling at grade, though Science Centre station will be underground. The full first phase of the route will span across the city, from in York to Kennedy station in Scarborough.

Line 6 Finch West is an , 18-stop light rail line under construction, extending west in a dedicated right-of-way lane from Finch West station on Line 1 Yonge–University to the Humber College&#x27;s North Campus in Etobicoke. The line is forecast to provide approximately 14.6million rides a year, or 40,000 a day, by 2031. It has an estimated cost of $1.2billion.

The Ontario Line, which is a rapid transit line and successor to the Relief Line, is expected to be completed by 2030. The Ontario government estimates the line&#x27;s cost at $10.9billion for the stretch from Ontario Place to Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue East at Science Centre station (part of the under-construction Line 5). It is the largest single expansion in Toronto subway history.

The Line 2 Bloor–Danforth extension is a subway extension, which will continue Line 2 east towards McCowan Road and north towards Scarborough City Centre and to a new terminal at the intersection of McCowan Road and Sheppard Avenue. The $5.5-billion extension will replace the defunct Line 3 Scarborough and is expected to be complete in 2030 at the earliest.

The Eglinton Crosstown West extension will extend the under-construction Line 5 Eglinton west to Renforth station and Pearson International Airport by 2030 or 2031 and will be mostly underground. The line will travel through all six of Toronto&#x27;s districts that were amalgamated in 1998 and bring the subway to Mississauga.

====Future plans====
There is currently one priority TTC expansion plan:

* The Yonge North subway extension is an extension of Line 1 Yonge–University proposed by the government of Ontario, nearly identical to the existing planned Yonge Subway Extension proposed by the City of Toronto, Metrolinx, and York Region. It would extend Line 1 into Richmond Hill in York Region. The line would travel north from Finch station to Richmond Hill Centre Terminal at Highway 7 and Yonge Street. The estimated cost for the project is $5.4billion, and it is projected to open after the Ontario Line has been completed.

Previous plans called for a second, eastward extension of Line 5 to the University of Toronto Scarborough campus, though this has since been replaced with plans for a separate Eglinton East LRT.

Metrolinx is studying an extension of Line 4 Sheppard, to replace the former Sheppard East LRT project, which would likely connect with the Line 2 Bloor–Danforth extension at McCowan Road and Sheppard Avenue.

===Streetcars===

Toronto&#x27;s streetcar system is one of the few in North America still operating along street-running tracks. It has been operating since the mid-19th century. Horsecar service started in 1861, and 600 V DC overhead electric service began in 1892. New TTC routes since the 1940s have generally been operated by other modes of transportation, and the less busy streetcar routes have also been converted. Streetcar routes are now focused on the downtown area, although two run farther from the core: one being on St. Clair Avenue, from Lake Ontario on average, served by the 512 St. Clair streetcar route, and another on Lake Shore Boulevard (the western portion of 501 Queen), which runs through the Etobicoke district nearly to the city limits with Mississauga at Etobicoke Creek in Long Branch.

Up until 1995, the TTC operated a fleet of 765 PCC-type streetcars, 540 of which it purchased new. The rest were purchased as other cities sold their PCC streetcar fleets.

From 1987 until September 2019, the TTC operated two-car Articulated Light Rail Vehicle (ALRV) streetcars, a longer version of the Canadian Light Rail Vehicle (CLRV) streetcars.

Following the retirement of the TTC&#x27;s CLRV streetcars on December 29, 2019, the entire TTC streetcar fleet consists of the low-floor Flexity Outlook vehicles from Bombardier Transportation, the first of which entered service on the 510 Spadina route on August 31, 2014.

==Services==
===Fares===
Since March 1, 2015, children 12 and under have been able to ride the TTC for free year-round. As of August 15, 2023, the TTC&#x27;s fare payment system consists of cash fares, Presto cards and Presto tickets. Customers also have the option to pay the equivalent of the adult single-ride TTC Presto card fare prices by tapping a contactless credit or debit card on TTC Presto fare readers. Although legacy fare media products, such as concession tickets (for youths ages 13 to 19 and seniors 65 or older), tokens, and physical day passes (including weekend family and group day passes) are no longer available for the general public to purchase from the TTC, they are still accepted as valid fare payments, but only until June 1, 2025. As of January 1, 2019, TTC monthly passes and the 12-month pass are only available on Presto, following the phase-out of the TTC&#x27;s own monthly Metropass and the Metropass discount plan (MDP). Since April 3, 2023, the adult cash fare and single-ride Presto tickets has been $3.35 for a single trip. Since April 3, 2023, the cost of adult single fares using a Presto card has been $3.30. The Fair Pass program allows those eligible for the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) or Ontario Works to receive a discount when using a Presto card.
The Presto card is an electronic unified contactless smart card–based fare payment system, owned and managed by Metrolinx, for use across the TTC transit network, along with several other transit service providers throughout the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) including the Metrolinx-owned GO Transit, Union Pearson Express services and on OC Transpo in Ottawa. The TTC also provides limited-use paper Presto tickets, mainly for occasional riders, which come in 1-ride, 2-ride and day pass varieties. Users tap their Presto card or ticket on a Presto reader as they enter a TTC station or vehicle. Either their fare is automatically paid through stored value, verifies if the Presto user has a valid TTC transit pass on it, or validates the TTC&#x27;s two-hour Presto transfer. Their card or ticket then acts as proof-of-payment (POP) to present to TTC staff such as fare inspectors, who carry hand-held devices to verify Presto fare payments, upon request. , Presto readers are available at the entrances of all subway stations and on all buses and streetcars.

Unlike the Presto card, Presto tickets can only be used on TTC services (subway and surface vehicles within the City of Toronto). They are not reloadable and cannot be used on any other transit service providers that use Presto.

===Schedules and route information===
On December 15, 2008, the TTC launched a new Next Vehicle Arrival System (NVAS) to indicate the time of arrival of the next vehicle along a given route. All TTC streetcars have been upgraded with Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and now operate with NVIS.

Real-time route information can be accessed from the Next Vehicle Arrival System (NVAS) from the City of Toronto Open Data initiative via SMS by texting the stop number displayed on the bus/streetcar stop pole, or with an app that uses NVAS data.

Route information can also be accessed by phone. Individual route schedules are available online.

Additional TTC information is circulated by &quot;What&#x27;s On&quot; and &quot;Rocket Rider / TTC Customer News&quot; pamphlets on some vehicles. Information can be accessed in person at the TTC head office (Davisville station at 1900 Yonge Street), as well as at a TTC Info Centre, which opened in 2018, at Union station. Twitter users can communicate with TTCHelps for inquiries.
Most subway stations are equipped with OneStop media screens that display the time until the next train, and other information. The next vehicle feature is available on LCD screens in all stations. Since mid-2011, all buses and streetcars have had the tracking feature enabled, accessible free online and by SMS for commuters.

On February 3, 2010, the TTC launched an online trip planner, which allows commuters to plan their routes and transfers on the TTC&#x27;s website. However, since its launch, the trip planner has remained in beta mode with many bugs remaining to be fixed. In October 2010, the TTC integrated its trip planner with Google Maps. Transit information in Toronto has been available in Apple Maps since the release of iOS 9 in September 2015, when Apple Inc. first launched support for public transit data.

===Connecting transit===
====Connecting GTA transit agencies====

The TTC connects with other transit systems of the Greater Toronto Area. GO Transit, Union Pearson Express, MiWay, York Region Transit (YRT), Brampton Transit, and Durham Region Transit (DRT) are connected to the TTC via some of Toronto&#x27;s subway stations, GO Transit&#x27;s commuter rail stations, and other hubs like Toronto Pearson International Airport. In addition to Union Station, there are 6 other stations where the TTC subway network and GO Transit commuter rail lines intersect.

Some bus routes of the surrounding local transit agencies run on Toronto streets along with TTC buses, mainly to reach TTC subway stations. Examples of this include YRT buses travelling on Yonge Street en route to Finch Bus Terminal, MiWay buses travelling on various streets in Etobicoke en route to Kipling Bus Terminal and DRT buses travelling on various streets in Scarborough en route to Scarborough Centre station. However, by law, other local transit agencies are prohibited from carrying passengers wholly within the City of Toronto. Therefore, YRT, DRT and MiWay buses can only drop off passengers inbound and pick up passengers outbound while within the boundaries of Toronto.

Originally, there were no free or discounted transfers between suburban agencies (which still have separate fare structures) and the TTC. But on February 26, 2024, Ontario&#x27;s One Fare Program, a GTA-wide fare integration program allowing free or discounted transfers between the TTC and other GTA transit systems (within either a two-hour or three-hour window), was implemented. However, the policy only applies to fare payments made via Presto, credit, or debit card; customers ineligible to receive free or discounted transfers are still required to pay a double fare.

====Connecting inter-city transit agencies====
Via Rail and Amtrak connect with the TTC at Union Station, while Ontario Northland, Megabus, TOK Coachlines and US-bound Greyhound intercity coaches connect with the TTC at the Union Station, Scarborough Centre, , and Yorkdale bus terminals.

===Cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity===
The communication system used by surface vehicles is called the Communications and Information System. It was piloted in the 1970s, implemented in 1991, and is now deployed on all TTC surface vehicles.

==== Subway wireless services ====

The TTC has provided Wi-Fi through its TConnect service since 2013.

In August 2023, Rogers implemented 5G wireless service at all the TTC&#x27;s downtown stations and within the tunnels between them.

In September 2023, the federal government imposed new licence conditions requiring that cellphone and data services be available on the entire subway network by the end of 2026 and that all mobile wireless carriers, including Telus and Bell, have access to it.

, all downtown subway stations and some west-end stations, as well as the tunnels connecting them, have Rogers 5G wireless service. The service is available to customers of Rogers and Freedom Mobile; however, customers of other carriers (such as Bell and Telus) can make 911 calls. 5G wireless service is available between Bloor–Yonge and Dupont stations on Line 1, and between Castle Frank and Keele stations on Line 2. The stations and tunnels between Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station and Sheppard West station on Line 1 have a non-5G service.

In December 2024, the TTC said that the service would be discontinued on December 27, 2024. 

===Accessibility===
The Wheel-Trans door-to-door service has been available since the mid-1970s. Since the 1990s, the TTC has focused on providing accessible services on conventional bus routes, the RT and subway. 56 of the 75 stations on Lines 1, 2, and 3 are wheel-chair accessible are equipped with elevators, and all stations on Line 4 are fully accessible. In December 2011, all bus routes became accessible with the retirement of the commission&#x27;s last inaccessible buses. On August 31, 2014, the commission launched its new fleet of low-floor Bombardier&#x27;s Flexity Outlook streetcars. With the decommissioning of the last of the commission&#x27;s CLRV vehicles on December 29, 2019, all TTC streetcar routes are now served by low-floor Flexity vehicles.

As per &quot;Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act&quot; (AODA) guidelines, all surface vehicles and subway trains have been equipped with the on-board Automatic Next Stop Announcement System since February 2008. It operates over speakers indicating the next stop. A digital orange LED destination sign on streetcars and buses as well as the Toronto Rocket subway trains display the name of the upcoming streets/stations as the vehicle progresses on its route.

All TTC revenue service vehicles are equipped with external speakers that play automated announcements of the route and destination of vehicle travel.

==Infrastructure==
===Stations, stops and terminals===
Most TTC surface routes terminate at loops, side streets, or subway stations. The TTC is one of the few mass transit systems in Canada where many surface routes can be accessed inside a paid-fare zone common to other routes or subway lines. This feature allows boarding via the back doors at terminals, reduces the usage of paper transfers, and the need of operators to check for proof-of-payment. However, if people are caught entering fare-paid terminals illegally from the street, they could be fined $500 for fare evasion. With the exception of , , , , and , all subway stations&#x27; off-street terminals are within the fare-paid area.
The shelters in the system are installed and maintained under contracts with Astral Media (later became a part of by Bell Media) (with CBS Outdoor since 2006 and previously Viacom Media) and Toronto Transportation Services. Approximately 4,100 shelters are managed by Toronto Transportation. Some shelters are solar powered and include next vehicle arrival displays.

There are four versions of shelters found in the city:

* Kramer Design Associates Ltd/Cantilevered arch roof – newest version being installed
** Cantilever arch roof canopy – used on the 512 St. Clair streetcar line
* Contemporary or Barrel vault dome roof – some by Daytech and installed by Viacom/CBS are found mostly in suburbs like Scarborough
** Barrel vault dome canopy – select stations with streetcar platforms
* Traditional flat top – older version in the former city of Toronto and variants in Etobicoke
** High Capacity Traditional – used on 510 Spadina streetcar line
* Classic shelters – oldest version without advertisements and found mostly in the suburbs outside of Toronto&#x27;s pre-1998 limits

There are ten sets (men and women) of public washrooms located on the TTC system, all at subway stations that are major transfer points, at the ends of subway lines, or former ends of subway lines. All (with the exception of and Vaughan Metropolitan Centre stations, which only connect with regional buses) are located within the fare paid area and thus available only to TTC passengers.

===Headquarters and facilities===

TTC buses and streetcars are operated out of a number of garages and carhouses located around the city and are serviced at several other facilities. The surface routes are divided into several divisions. Individual divisions have a manager, an on-duty mobile supervisor, a CIS communications centre, and a garage facility tasked with managing the division&#x27;s vehicle fleet and routes.

TTC Head Office is in the William McBrien Building, located at 1900 Yonge Street at Davisville Avenue, which opened in 1957. The Davisville station bus bay occupies part of the building&#x27;s ground floor. The previous TTC Headquarters was at Yonge and Front Streets in the Toronto Board of Trade Building, which was later demolished.

There are plans to relocate the head office to a yet-to-be-built site at 4050 Yonge Street near York Mills Road. The site is a commuter parking lot with a TTC entrance to York Mills station. Build Toronto is charged with helping the commission relocate, but it is facing political opposition from many mayoral candidates.

===Commuter parking lots===
The Toronto Parking Authority on behalf of the TTC operates 30 commuter parking lots, all at subway stations, with a total of 13,981 parking spaces. Effective April 1, 2009, it eliminated free parking for Metropass holders. All passengers using parking facilities during peak hours must now pay for the service. The rates vary by location from $2.00 to $7.00 between 5:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. on weekdays, with lots offering discounted or free parking at other times. All TTC-owned lots are open (uncovered) parking lots; however, certain lots are located in covered garages, such as the Yorkdale lot, which is located in the namesake shopping centre&#x27;s underground parking garage.

==Safety==

===Safety programs===
Safety features provided by the TTC include:

* Request Stop: all passengers travelling alone on surface routes (9 pm – 5 am, excluding streetcar routes) can ask the driver to stop at points between bus stops. The program started in 1991, due in part to the activities of serial rapist and killer Paul Bernardo. On October 13, 2011, after many requests from the public and, finally, a letter by LGBTQ+ rights group Queer Ontario, the TTC announced that it would make the Request Stop Program available to all passengers in need; from 1991 to 2011, the program was only available to women.
* Designated Waiting Areas (DWA) on rapid transit platforms: these are well-lit, have intercoms, are monitored by security cameras, and are near the location where the guard car stops.
* Toronto paramedics: stationed at key locations within the subway system during the morning and evening rush to assist with medical emergencies and provide a faster emergency response. This also reduces delays on the rapid transit system.
* Emergency Power Cut stations: indicated by a blue beacon and located on both ends of all rapid transit platforms with a PAX telephone that can be used contact the Transit Control Centre&#x27;s emergency line (3555).
* Yellow Emergency Alarm (formerly &quot;Passenger Assistance Alarm&quot;): yellow strips on all subway cars since 1977 and on the Flexity Outlook streetcars since their introduction in 2014.
* Emergency stopping mechanisms (Passenger/Guard Emergency Valve or PGEV): on the T1 trains and Line 3 Scarborough trains (except for the Toronto Rocket subway trains, which use a two-way intercom for passenger communication with the train crew as with the Flexity streetcars)
* Approximately 12,000 cameras monitoring activities at subway stations and on buses, streetcars and Toronto Rocket subway trains.
* Underground Alert messages: displayed on the subway platform video screens to notify passengers about criminals.
* TTC Transit Enforcement Unit: consisting of fare inspectors and special constables

====Crisis Link====
In June 2011, the TTC announced a new suicide prevention program called &quot;Crisis Link&quot; aimed at people who are in a station and in immediate danger of performing self-harm. Special speed dial buttons have been installed on payphones in station Designated Waiting Areas that &quot;link&quot; the caller to a 24-hour crisis counselling service provided by Distress Centres of Toronto. Signage has also been placed in high-risk areas of the station platform directing those at risk to use the service. The program includes 141 speed dial buttons on the system&#x27;s payphones and 200 posters placed on station platforms.

====ThisIsWhere initiative and SafeTTC mobile app====
In September 2017, the TTC created an iOS/iPadOS and Android app called ThisIsWhere that allows users to report harassment and other personal safety incidents to the TTC. The name was later changed to &quot;SafeTTC&quot; and launched on September 6, 2017.

===Transit Enforcement Unit===
From 1997 to 2011, the TTC employed special constables, who were responsible for safety and security and had similar policing powers to Toronto Police Service officers. During the phase-out of the special constables, the Toronto Police reinstated its Transit Patrol Unit, which had been cancelled in the mid-1990s. The special constables were replaced by bylaw enforcement officers known as transit enforcement officers, as part of the TTC&#x27;s Transit Enforcement Unit.

The negotiation between TTC and the Toronto Police Services Board took place in 2013 resulting in restored special constable status and peace officer authority.

There is a difference between special constables and fare inspectors. Fare inspectors have no authority to detain a person, and so it is possible to simply walk away with no repercussions. In contrast, special constables have the same authority as police officers.

====Bylaws enforced====
The TTC&#x27;s By-law No. 1 is a by-law governing the actions of passengers and employees while on Commission property. It can be enforced by a &quot;proper authority&quot; which is defined in the by-law as: &quot;an employee or agent of the TTC wearing a TTC uniform; an employee or agent of the TTC carrying an identification card issued by the TTC; or a municipal police officer.&quot; The by-law covers rules regarding fare payment and conduct while in the system. Effective October 12, 2009, a revised version of the by-law has been issued. Revisions include the restriction of placing feet or &quot;any object that may soil&quot; on seats, the prohibition against using offensive language (including via the user-generated displays at Pioneer Village station, which are part of the public art installation &quot;LightSpell&quot;, although the displays have not yet been activated), and the provision that one must give up their seat to a person with a disability or pregnancy in priority seating areas.

===Communications===

The TTC uses three primary voice and data communication systems. The first is the system used by Operations, Security and Maintenance. This system operates on five UHF conventional frequencies. Channels 1, 3, 4 and 5 are used for day-to-day operations, while Channel 2 is reserved for the Wheel-Trans service.

The second system, the Communications and Information System (CIS), is used by buses and streetcars, and employs transmission facilities throughout the city. Conceived in the late 1970s and fully implemented in 1991, it consists of a computer unit on board each bus and streetcar, called the Transit Radio Unified Microprocessor (TRUMP). This is attached to a transponder receiver, which allows CIS operators to track the location of the vehicle using a computational system known as dead reckoning. The TRUMP unit also allows vehicle and CIS operators to send and receive text messages for such things as short turns and route adjustments. There is also the option of voice-based communication between the vehicle and CIS operators. With the introduction of NextBus technology to provide real-time arrival information, the CIS has been updated to use a combination of GPS data and the previous dead reckoning (signpost-based) system. In the event that internally managed TTC communications are unavailable, the TRUMP unit operates on Bell Mobility&#x27;s CDMA network to communicate with divisional operations and transit control.
In 2012, the TTC began research into transitioning from the outdated and antiquated CIS to a newer computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system. Utilizing this technology would help improve headways, provide more reliable communications and allow divisional supervisors to locate vehicles in real time (the current GPS system only sends location updates every 20 seconds). Implementation of the system, later named the Vehicle Information System &amp; Integrated Operations Network (VISION), began in 2016, with the contract for associated equipment awarded to Clever Devices ULC. After extensive testing, deployment of VISION on vehicles in revenue service began in the summer of 2018, with plans to fully equip the entire bus and streetcar fleet by 2019.

The third system, known as the &quot;wayside system&quot;, consists of UHF MPT-1327 Trunking radio sets used by the three heavy-rail subway lines. They replaced older devices which communicated by the third rail, and are divided into separate systems representing their respective subway lines. This trunking system allows Transit Control to communicate directly with a single train, a zone encompassing several trains, or the entire line. (Line 3 Scarborough uses a single channel UHF system, much the same as the system used by operations staff.)

All of these systems can be monitored by a scanner capable of the UHF Low band (406–430 MHz). Numeric codes—often referring to people or positions (299 Bloor – Subway Line mechanic at Bloor)—are also announced through the radio and the overhead paging system. The TTC also has several &quot;Plans&quot; (&quot;Plan A&quot; through &quot;Plan G&quot;) that are used in emergencies but are not announced on the PA system and only referred to on the radio.

====OneStop media system====

The TTC, in partnership with Pattison OneStop (formerly OneStop Media Group), have installed large LCD television screens in most subway stations throughout the system except on Line 3 Scarborough and at the Toronto–York Spadina Subway Extension ( to ) stations. The new media system replaced the old &quot;Subway Online&quot; system, which were decommissioned.

The signs feature advertising, news headlines and weather information. From its inception in 2005 until December 31, 2017, the news feed and advertising for television programs were supplied under a contract with Bell Media&#x27;s 24-hour local cable television news service, CP24. Since January 1, 2018, the service has been provided by Global Television Network&#x27;s Toronto television station CIII-DT 41, which is owned by Corus Entertainment. The signs also provide TTC-specific information regarding service changes and delays, information pertaining to using the system, and Toronto Police Service alerts about suspects. The system can also be used when an Amber alert is issued, which also may include announcements via the PA system.

In September 2008, Dundas station was the first to feature a &quot;Next Train&quot; announcement integrated into the signage. The system has been expanded to many other stations since its initial rollout. Since mid-July 2009, the majority of stations have been equipped with this service and since January 2018 – coinciding with a content provider switch from CP24 to Global News – the next train arrival time notices were also updated to provide the line number and the destination of the next train. The TYSSE stations have screens that display the arrival times for the next two or three trains. Unlike the older screens, these screens neither display news nor weather headlines provided by Global News.

==Governance==
As an agency of the City of Toronto, the City has full authority over the TTC&#x27;s mandate and structure. The TTC is responsible to Toronto City Council through its board, composed of members of council and citizens, led by the chair.

=== Constituting legislation ===
The &quot;Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act&quot; established the modern day &quot;Toronto Transit Commission&quot; from the &quot;Toronto Transportation Commission&quot; in 1954. When the &quot;City of Toronto Act&quot; was last updated in 2006, the TTC was continued under the updated act. Toronto Municipal Code, chapter 279 stipulates additional fiscal and policy requirements for the TTC, as well as sets out the requirements for the TTC board. The TTC itself regulates the use of its system via TTC By-law No. 1, the most current revision being the 2009 revision.

=== Board and chair ===
The TTC board consists of ten members: six Toronto City Council members and four citizens. The citizen members are nominated through an independent public process by the Civic Appointments committee. The mayor of Toronto appoints the chair of the TTC, currently Jamaal Myers. The chair must be a member of Toronto City Council. The board elects a vice-chair from among its members.
==Management and personnel==
The TTC has more than 12,000 employees. Most are operators, but the commission also employs supervisors, custodians and a wide range of skilled tradespeople who work on vehicles and critical subway and surface infrastructure.

The day-to-day operations of the TTC are managed by the chief executive officer (formerly the chief general manager or CGM). Greg Percy became the interim CEO under an eight-month contract in September 2024 after the departure of Rick Leary at the end of August 2024; Leary had succeeded Andy Byford in January 2018. Percy has an eight-month contract as interim CEO.

In 2022, TTC employees were surveyed by their union as part of Transit Worker Assault Awareness Day. 73 percent of those surveyed (out of approximately 3,100 people) reported experiencing workplace violence. In March 2023, Jennifer McKelvie, the deputy mayor of Toronto, requested section 269.01 of the Canadian &quot;Criminal Code&quot; be amended to include assault against transit workers.

=== Executive personnel ===

* Greg Percy, interim chief executive officer
* Fortunato Monaco, chief operations and infrastructure officer

===Station managers===
In 2013, the TTC assigned group station managers on most subway lines and hired an additional manager upon the opening of the Line 1 extension to Vaughan:

* Lines 1 Yonge–University and 4 Sheppard
** Finch to St. Clair on Line 1 and Line 4
** St. Andrew to Summerhill
** Yorkdale to Osgoode
** Vaughan Metropolitan Centre to Wilson
* Lines 2 Bloor–Danforth and formerly 3 Scarborough
** Broadview to Kennedy on Line 2 and Line 3 (until Line 3&#x27;s closure in July 2023)
** Castle Frank to Spadina
** Bathurst to Kipling

===Labour disputes===
Unionized workers of the TTC workers have performed strike actions numerous times since 1952. At the request of Mayor Rob Ford and Toronto City Council, on March 30, 2011, the Province of Ontario passed legislation classifying the TTC an essential service, which removed the employees&#x27; right to strike. On May 8, 2023, a Superior Court judge overturned the designation on the basis that the TTC did not meet the judicial definition of an &quot;essential service&quot; and therefore the restrictions on striking were unconstitutional.

====2024 averted strike====
A TTC strike was set to begin on June 7, 2024, at 12:01 a.m. if a deal between the TTC and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113 was not reached. The previous April, union members had voted overwhelmingly in favour of strike action if necessary, after their previous collective agreement expired at the end of March 2024. However, the TTC and the union reached a tentative agreement at approximately 11:30 p.m. on June 6, 2024, and so the strike was averted.

The key issues for the union and its members related to job security, protections against contracting out jobs, and improvements in benefits for active members and pensioners. The president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113, Marvin Alfred, confirmed the next morning that a tentative agreement had been reached late the night before and that talks had continued until almost 4 a.m. &quot;What we have right now is a deal&quot;, he said. &quot;We have something signed, but we&#x27;re still preparing and making sure we can have something tangible for our membership,&quot; he told CBC Radio&#x27;s Metro Morning.

===2018 benefits fraud investigation===
In 2018, as a result of their involvement in a health insurance scam involving Healthy Fit, an orthotics shop, 223 employees were dismissed or forced to retire early, while ten faced criminal charges.

==Subsidiaries==
Beside the main transit operations, the TTC has subsidiaries:

* TTC Insurance Company Ltd. — deals with insurance risks from operations; established 1994
* Toronto Transit Infrastructure Ltd. — provides advisory services on infrastructure projects
* Toronto Coach Terminal Inc. — handled the operations of the Toronto Coach Terminal, which was closed in 2021

<text>Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and androgen in males. In humans, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testicles and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair. It is associated with increased aggression, sex drive, dominance, courtship display, and a wide range of behavioral characteristics. In addition, testosterone in both sexes is involved in health and well-being, where it has a significant effect on overall mood, cognition, social and sexual behavior, metabolism and energy output, the cardiovascular system, and in the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty, accumulation of adipose fat tissue within the body, anxiety and depression, sexual performance issues, and bone loss.

Excessive levels of testosterone in men may be associated with hyperandrogenism, higher risk of heart failure, increased mortality in men with prostate cancer, and male pattern baldness.

Testosterone is a steroid hormone from the androstane class containing a ketone and a hydroxyl group at positions three and seventeen respectively. It is biosynthesized in several steps from cholesterol and is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites. It exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor. In humans and most other vertebrates, testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and, to a lesser extent, the ovaries of females. On average, in adult males, levels of testosterone are about seven to eight times as great as in adult females. As the metabolism of testosterone in males is more pronounced, the daily production is about 20 times greater in men. Females are also more sensitive to the hormone.

In addition to its role as a natural hormone, testosterone is used as a medication to treat hypogonadism and breast cancer. Since testosterone levels decrease as men age, testosterone is sometimes used in older men to counteract this deficiency. It is also used illicitly to enhance physique and performance, for instance in athletes. The World Anti-Doping Agency lists it as S1 Anabolic agent substance &quot;prohibited at all times&quot;.

==Biological effects==

=== Effects on physiological development ===
In general, androgens such as testosterone promote protein synthesis and thus growth of tissues with androgen receptors. Testosterone can be described as having anabolic and androgenic (virilising) effects, though these categorical descriptions are somewhat arbitrary, as there is a great deal of mutual overlap between them. The relative potency of these effects can depend on various factors and is a topic of ongoing research. Testosterone can either directly exert effects on target tissues or be metabolized by 5α-reductase into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or aromatized to estradiol (E2). Both testosterone and DHT bind to an androgen receptor; however, DHT has a stronger binding affinity than testosterone and may have more androgenic effect in certain tissues at lower levels.
* &quot;Anabolic effects&quot; include growth of muscle mass and strength, increased bone density and strength, and stimulation of linear growth and bone maturation.
* &quot;Androgenic effects&quot; include maturation of the sex organs, particularly the penis, and the formation of the scrotum in the fetus, and after birth (usually at puberty) a deepening of the voice, growth of facial hair (such as the beard) and axillary (underarm) hair. Many of these fall into the category of male secondary sex characteristics.

Testosterone effects can also be classified by the age of usual occurrence. For postnatal effects in both males and females, these are mostly dependent on the levels and duration of circulating free testosterone.

==== Before birth ====
Effects before birth are divided into two categories, classified in relation to the stages of development.

The first period occurs between 4 and 6 weeks of the gestation. Examples include genital virilisation such as midline fusion, phallic urethra, scrotal thinning and rugation, and phallic enlargement; although the role of testosterone is far smaller than that of dihydrotestosterone. There is also development of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles.

During the second trimester, androgen level is associated with sex formation. Specifically, testosterone, along with anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) promote growth of the Wolffian duct and degeneration of the Müllerian duct respectively. This period affects the femininization or masculinization of the fetus and can be a better predictor of feminine or masculine behaviours such as sex typed behaviour than an adult&#x27;s own levels. Prenatal androgens apparently influence interests and engagement in gendered activities and have moderate effects on spatial abilities. Among women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a male-typical play in childhood correlated with reduced satisfaction with the female gender and reduced heterosexual interest in adulthood.

==== Early infancy ====
Early infancy androgen effects are the least understood. In the first weeks of life for male infants, testosterone levels rise. The levels remain in a pubertal range for a few months, but usually reach the barely detectable levels of childhood by 4–7 months of age. The function of this rise in humans is unknown. It has been theorized that brain masculinization is occurring since no significant changes have been identified in other parts of the body. The male brain is masculinized by the aromatization of testosterone into estradiol, which crosses the blood–brain barrier and enters the male brain, whereas female fetuses have α-fetoprotein, which binds the estrogen so that female brains are not affected.

==== Before puberty ====
Before puberty, effects of rising androgen levels occur in both boys and girls. These include adult-type body odor, increased oiliness of skin and hair, acne, pubarche (appearance of pubic hair), axillary hair (armpit hair), growth spurt, accelerated bone maturation, and facial hair.

==== Pubertal ====
Pubertal effects begin to occur when androgen has been higher than normal adult female levels for months or years. In males, these are usual late pubertal effects, and occur in women after prolonged periods of heightened levels of free testosterone in the blood. The effects include:
* Growth of spermatogenic tissue in testicles, male fertility, penis or clitoris enlargement, increased libido and frequency of erection or clitoral engorgement occurs.
* Growth of jaw, brow, chin, and nose and remodeling of facial bone contours, in conjunction with human growth hormone occurs.
* Completion of bone maturation and termination of growth. This occurs indirectly via estradiol metabolites and hence more gradually in men than women.
* Increased muscle strength and mass, shoulders become broader and rib cage expands, deepening of voice, growth of the Adam&#x27;s apple.
* Enlargement of sebaceous glands. This might cause acne, subcutaneous fat in face decreases.
* Pubic hair extends to thighs and up toward umbilicus, development of facial hair (sideburns, beard, moustache), loss of scalp hair (androgenetic alopecia), increase in chest hair, periareolar hair, perianal hair, leg hair, armpit hair.

==== Adult ====
Testosterone is necessary for normal sperm development. It activates genes in Sertoli cells, which promote differentiation of spermatogonia. It regulates acute hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HTA axis) response under dominance challenge. Androgens including testosterone enhance muscle growth. Testosterone also regulates the population of thromboxane A2 receptors on megakaryocytes and platelets and hence platelet aggregation in humans.

Adult testosterone effects are more clearly demonstrable in males than in females, but are likely important to both sexes. Some of these effects may decline as testosterone levels might decrease in the later decades of adult life.

The brain is also affected by this sexual differentiation; the enzyme aromatase converts testosterone into estradiol that is responsible for masculinization of the brain in male mice. In humans, masculinization of the fetal brain appears, by observation of gender preference in patients with congenital disorders of androgen formation or androgen receptor function, to be associated with functional androgen receptors.

There are some differences between a male and female brain that may be due to different testosterone levels, one of them being size: the male human brain is, on average, larger.

=== Health effects ===
Testosterone does not appear to increase the risk of developing prostate cancer. In people who have undergone testosterone deprivation therapy, testosterone increases beyond the castrate level have been shown to increase the rate of spread of an existing prostate cancer.

Conflicting results have been obtained concerning the importance of testosterone in maintaining cardiovascular health. Nevertheless, maintaining normal testosterone levels in elderly men has been shown to improve many parameters that are thought to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, such as increased lean body mass, decreased visceral fat mass, decreased total cholesterol, and improved glycemic control.

High androgen levels are associated with menstrual cycle irregularities in both clinical populations and healthy women. There also can be effects in unusual hair growth, acne, weight gain, infertility, and sometimes even scalp hair loss. These effects are seen largely in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). For women with PCOS, hormones like birth control pills can be used to help lessen the effects of this increased level of testosterone.

Attention, memory, and spatial ability are key cognitive functions affected by testosterone in humans. Preliminary evidence suggests that low testosterone levels may be a risk factor for cognitive decline and possibly for dementia of the Alzheimer&#x27;s type, a key argument in life extension medicine for the use of testosterone in anti-aging therapies. Much of the literature, however, suggests a curvilinear or even quadratic relationship between spatial performance and circulating testosterone, where both hypo- and hypersecretion (deficient- and excessive-secretion) of circulating androgens have negative effects on cognition.

==== Immune system and inflammation ====
Testosterone deficiency is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and mortality, which are also sequelae of chronic inflammation. Testosterone plasma concentration inversely correlates to multiple biomarkers of inflammation including CRP, interleukin 1 beta, interleukin 6, TNF alpha and endotoxin concentration, as well as leukocyte count. As demonstrated by a meta-analysis, substitution therapy with testosterone results in a significant reduction of inflammatory markers. These effects are mediated by different mechanisms with synergistic action. In androgen-deficient men with concomitant autoimmune thyroiditis, substitution therapy with testosterone leads to a decrease in thyroid autoantibody titres and an increase in thyroid&#x27;s secretory capacity (SPINA-GT).

==== Medical use ====
Testosterone is used as a medication for the treatment of male hypogonadism, gender dysphoria, and certain types of breast cancer. This is known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), which maintains serum testosterone levels in the normal range. Decline of testosterone production with age has led to interest in androgen replacement therapy. It is unclear if the use of testosterone for low levels due to aging is beneficial or harmful.

Testosterone is included in the World Health Organization&#x27;s list of essential medicines, which are the most important medications needed in a basic health system. It is available as a generic medication. It can be administered as a cream or transdermal patch that is applied to the skin, by injection into a muscle, as a tablet that is placed in the cheek, or by ingestion.

Common side effects from testosterone medication include acne, swelling, and breast enlargement in males. Serious side effects may include liver toxicity, heart disease (though a randomized trial found no evidence of major adverse cardiac events compared to placebo in men with low testosterone), and behavioral changes. Women and children who are exposed may develop virilization. It is recommended that individuals with prostate cancer not use the medication. It can cause harm if used during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

2020 guidelines from the American College of Physicians support the discussion of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low levels of testosterone who have sexual dysfunction. They recommend yearly evaluation regarding possible improvement and, if none, to discontinue testosterone; physicians should consider intramuscular treatments, rather than transdermal treatments, due to costs and since the effectiveness and harm of either method is similar. Testosterone treatment for reasons other than possible improvement of sexual dysfunction may not be recommended.

No immediate short term effects on mood or behavior were found from the administration of doses of testosterone for 10 weeks on 43 healthy men.

=== Behavioural correlations ===

====Sexual arousal====
Testosterone levels follow a circadian rhythm that peaks early each day, regardless of sexual activity.

In women, correlations may exist between positive orgasm experience and testosterone levels. Studies have shown small or inconsistent correlations between testosterone levels and male orgasm experience, as well as sexual assertiveness in both sexes.

Sexual arousal and masturbation in women produce small increases in testosterone concentrations. The plasma levels of various steroids significantly increase after masturbation in men and the testosterone levels correlate to those levels.

====Mammalian studies====
Studies conducted in rats have indicated that their degree of sexual arousal is sensitive to reductions in testosterone. When testosterone-deprived rats were given medium levels of testosterone, their sexual behaviours (copulation, partner preference, etc.) resumed, but not when given low amounts of the same hormone. Therefore, these mammals may provide a model for studying clinical populations among humans with sexual arousal deficits such as hypoactive sexual desire disorder.

Every mammalian species examined demonstrated a marked increase in a male&#x27;s testosterone level upon encountering a female. The reflexive testosterone increases in male mice is related to the male&#x27;s initial level of sexual arousal.

In non-human primates, it may be that testosterone in puberty stimulates sexual arousal, which allows the primate to increasingly seek out sexual experiences with females and thus creates a sexual preference for females. Some research has also indicated that if testosterone is eliminated in an adult male human or other adult male primate&#x27;s system, its sexual motivation decreases, but there is no corresponding decrease in ability to engage in sexual activity (mounting, ejaculating, etc.).

In accordance with sperm competition theory, testosterone levels are shown to increase as a response to previously neutral stimuli when conditioned to become sexual in male rats. This reaction engages penile reflexes (such as erection and ejaculation) that aid in sperm competition when more than one male is present in mating encounters, allowing for more production of successful sperm and a higher chance of reproduction.

====Males====
In men, higher levels of testosterone are associated with periods of sexual activity.

Men who watch a sexually explicit movie have an average increase of 35% in testosterone, peaking at 60–90 minutes after the end of the film, but no increase is seen in men who watch sexually neutral films. Men who watch sexually explicit films also report increased motivation and competitiveness, and decreased exhaustion. A link has also been found between relaxation following sexual arousal and testosterone levels.

====Females====
Androgens may modulate the physiology of vaginal tissue and contribute to female genital sexual arousal. Women&#x27;s level of testosterone is higher when measured pre-intercourse vs. pre-cuddling, as well as post-intercourse vs. post-cuddling. There is a time lag effect when testosterone is administered, on genital arousal in women. In addition, a continuous increase in vaginal sexual arousal may result in higher genital sensations and sexual appetitive behaviors.

When females have a higher baseline level of testosterone, they have higher increases in sexual arousal levels but smaller increases in testosterone, indicating a ceiling effect on testosterone levels in females. Sexual thoughts also change the level of testosterone but not the level of cortisol in the female body, and hormonal contraceptives may affect the variation in testosterone response to sexual thoughts.

Testosterone may prove to be an effective treatment in female sexual arousal disorders, and is available as a dermal patch. There is no FDA-approved androgen preparation for the treatment of androgen insufficiency; however, it has been used as an off-label use to treat low libido and sexual dysfunction in older women. Testosterone may be a treatment for postmenopausal women as long as they are effectively estrogenized.

====Romantic relationships====
Falling in love has been linked with decreases in men&#x27;s testosterone levels while mixed changes are reported for women&#x27;s testosterone levels. There has been speculation that these changes in testosterone result in the temporary reduction of differences in behavior between the sexes. However, the testosterone changes observed do not seem to be maintained as relationships develop over time.

Men who produce less testosterone are more likely to be in a relationship or married, and men who produce more testosterone are more likely to divorce. Marriage or commitment could cause a decrease in testosterone levels. Single men who have not had relationship experience have lower testosterone levels than single men with experience. It is suggested that these single men with prior experience are in a more competitive state than their non-experienced counterparts. Married men who engage in bond-maintenance activities such as spending the day with their spouse or child have no different testosterone levels compared to times when they do not engage in such activities. Collectively, these results suggest that the presence of competitive activities rather than bond-maintenance activities is more relevant to changes in testosterone levels.

Men who produce more testosterone are more likely to engage in extramarital sex. Testosterone levels do not rely on physical presence of a partner; testosterone levels of men engaging in same-city and long-distance relationships are similar. Physical presence may be required for women who are in relationships for the testosterone–partner interaction, where same-city partnered women have lower testosterone levels than long-distance partnered women.

====Fatherhood====
Fatherhood decreases testosterone levels in men, suggesting that the emotions and behaviour tied to paternal care decrease testosterone levels. In humans and other species that utilize allomaternal care, paternal investment in offspring is beneficial to said offspring&#x27;s survival because it allows the two parents to raise multiple children simultaneously. This increases the reproductive fitness of the parents because their offspring are more likely to survive and reproduce. Paternal care increases offspring survival due to increased access to higher quality food and reduced physical and immunological threats. This is particularly beneficial for humans since offspring are dependent on parents for extended periods of time and mothers have relatively short inter-birth intervals.

While the extent of paternal care varies between cultures, higher investment in direct child care has been seen to be correlated with lower average testosterone levels as well as temporary fluctuations. For instance, fluctuation in testosterone levels when a child is in distress has been found to be indicative of fathering styles. If a father&#x27;s testosterone levels decrease in response to hearing their baby cry, it is an indication of empathizing with the baby. This is associated with increased nurturing behavior and better outcomes for the infant.

====Motivation====
Testosterone levels play a major role in risk-taking during financial decisions. Higher testosterone levels in men reduce the risk of becoming or staying unemployed. Research has also found that heightened levels of testosterone and cortisol are associated with an increased risk of impulsive and violent criminal behavior. On the other hand, elevated testosterone in men may increase their generosity, primarily to attract a potential mate.

==== Aggression and criminality ====

Most studies support a link between adult criminality and testosterone. Nearly all studies of juvenile delinquency and testosterone are not significant. Most studies have found testosterone to be associated with behaviors or personality traits linked with antisocial behavior and alcoholism. Many studies have been undertaken on the relationship between more general aggressive behavior, and feelings, and testosterone. About half of studies have found a relationship and about half, no relationship. Studies have found that testosterone facilitates aggression by modulating vasopressin receptors in the hypothalamus.

There are two theories on the role of testosterone in aggression and competition. The first is the challenge hypothesis which states that testosterone would increase during puberty, thus facilitating reproductive and competitive behavior which would include aggression. It is therefore the challenge of competition among males that facilitates aggression and violence. Studies conducted have found direct correlation between testosterone and dominance, especially among the most violent criminals in prison who had the highest testosterone. The same research found fathers (outside competitive environments) had the lowest testosterone levels compared to other males.

The second theory is similar and known as &quot;evolutionary neuroandrogenic (ENA) theory of male aggression&quot;. Testosterone and other androgens have evolved to masculinize a brain to be competitive, even to the point of risking harm to the person and others. By doing so, individuals with masculinized brains as a result of pre-natal and adult life testosterone and androgens, enhance their resource acquiring abilities to survive, attract and copulate with mates as much as possible. The masculinization of the brain is not just mediated by testosterone levels at the adult stage, but also testosterone exposure in the womb. Higher pre-natal testosterone indicated by a low digit ratio as well as adult testosterone levels increased risk of fouls or aggression among male players in a soccer game. Studies have found higher pre-natal testosterone or lower digit ratio to be correlated with higher aggression.

The rise in testosterone during competition predicted aggression in males, but not in females. Subjects who interacted with handguns and an experimental game showed rise in testosterone and aggression. Natural selection might have evolved males to be more sensitive to competitive and status challenge situations, and that the interacting roles of testosterone are the essential ingredient for aggressive behaviour in these situations. Testosterone mediates attraction to cruel and violent cues in men by promoting extended viewing of violent stimuli. Testosterone-specific structural brain characteristic can predict aggressive behaviour in individuals.

The &quot;Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences&quot; has found anabolic steroid use (which increases testosterone) to be higher in teenagers, and this was associated with increased violence. Studies have found administered testosterone to increase verbal aggression and anger in some participants.

A few studies indicate that the testosterone derivative estradiol might play an important role in male aggression. Estradiol is known to correlate with aggression in male mice. Moreover, the conversion of testosterone to estradiol regulates male aggression in sparrows during breeding season. Rats who were given anabolic steroids that increase testosterone were also more physically aggressive to provocation as a result of &quot;threat sensitivity&quot;.

The relationship between testosterone and aggression may also function indirectly, as it has been proposed that testosterone does not amplify tendencies towards aggression, but rather amplifies whatever tendencies will allow an individual to maintain social status when challenged. In most animals, aggression is the means of maintaining social status. However, humans have multiple ways of obtaining status. This could explain why some studies find a link between testosterone and pro-social behaviour, if pro-social behaviour is rewarded with social status. Thus the link between testosterone and aggression and violence is due to these being rewarded with social status. The relationship may also be one of a &quot;permissive effect&quot; whereby testosterone does elevate aggression levels, but only in the sense of allowing average aggression levels to be maintained; chemically or physically castrating the individual will reduce aggression levels (though not eliminate them) but the individual only needs a small-level of pre-castration testosterone to have aggression levels to return to normal, which they will remain at even if additional testosterone is added. Testosterone may also simply exaggerate or amplify existing aggression; for example, chimpanzees who receive testosterone increases become more aggressive to chimps lower than them in the social hierarchy, but will still be submissive to chimps higher than them. Testosterone thus does not make the chimpanzee indiscriminately aggressive, but instead amplifies his pre-existing aggression towards lower-ranked chimps.

In humans, testosterone appears more to promote status-seeking and social dominance than simply increasing physical aggression. When controlling for the effects of belief in having received testosterone, women who have received testosterone make fairer offers than women who have not received testosterone.

==== Fairness ====

Testosterone might encourage fair behavior. For one study, subjects took part in a behavioral experiment where the distribution of a real amount of money was decided. The rules allowed both fair and unfair offers. The negotiating partner could subsequently accept or decline the offer. The fairer the offer, the less probable a refusal by the negotiating partner. If no agreement was reached, neither party earned anything. Test subjects with an artificially enhanced testosterone level generally made better, fairer offers than those who received placebos, thus reducing the risk of a rejection of their offer to a minimum. Two later studies have empirically confirmed these results. However men with high testosterone were significantly 27% less generous in an ultimatum game.

==Biological activity==

===Free testosterone===
Lipophilic hormones (soluble in lipids but not in water), such as steroid hormones, including testosterone, are transported in water-based blood plasma through specific and non-specific proteins. Specific proteins include sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which binds testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and other sex steroids. Non-specific binding proteins include albumin. The part of the total hormone concentration that is not bound to its respective specific carrier protein is the free part. As a result, testosterone which is not bound to SHBG is called &quot;free testosterone&quot;. Only the free amount of testosterone can bind to an androgenic receptor, which means it has biological activity. While a significant portion of testosterone is bound to SHBG, a small fraction of testosterone (1%-2%) is bound to albumin and the binding of testosterone to albumin is weak and can be reversed easily; as such, both albumin-bound and unbound testosterone are considered to be bioavailable testosterone. This binding plays an important role in regulating the transport, tissue delivery, bioactivity, and metabolism of testosterone. At the tissue level, testosterone dissociates from albumin and quickly diffuses into the tissues. The percentage of testosterone bound to SHBG is lower in men than in women. Both the free fraction and the one bound to albumin are available at the tissue level (their sum constitutes the bioavailable testosterone), while SHBG effectively and irreversibly inhibits the action of testosterone. The relationship between sex steroids and SHBG in physiological and pathological conditions is complex, as various factors may influence the levels of plasma SHBG, affecting bioavailability of testosterone.

===Steroid hormone activity===
The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of multiple mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as dihydrotestosterone), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Androgens such as testosterone have also been found to bind to and activate membrane androgen receptors.

Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5α-reductase. 5α-DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than testosterone, so that its androgenic potency is about 5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects.

Androgen receptors occur in many different vertebrate body system tissues, and both males and females respond similarly to similar levels. Greatly differing amounts of testosterone prenatally, at puberty, and throughout life account for a share of biological differences between males and females.

The bones and the brain are two important tissues in humans where the primary effect of testosterone is by way of aromatization to estradiol. In the bones, estradiol accelerates ossification of cartilage into bone, leading to closure of the epiphyses and conclusion of growth. In the central nervous system, testosterone is aromatized to estradiol. Estradiol rather than testosterone serves as the most important feedback signal to the hypothalamus (especially affecting LH secretion). In many mammals, prenatal or perinatal &quot;masculinization&quot; of the sexually dimorphic areas of the brain by estradiol derived from testosterone programs later male sexual behavior.

===Neurosteroid activity===
Testosterone, via its active metabolite 3α-androstanediol, is a potent positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor.

Testosterone has been found to act as an antagonist of the TrkA and p75NTR, receptors for the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF), with high affinity (around 5 nM). In contrast to testosterone, DHEA and DHEA sulfate have been found to act as high-affinity agonists of these receptors.

Testosterone is an antagonist of the sigma-1 receptor (Ki = 1,014 or 201 nM). However, the concentrations of testosterone required for binding the receptor are far above even total circulating concentrations of testosterone in adult males (which range between 10 and 35 nM).

==Biochemistry==
===Biosynthesis===
Like other steroid hormones, testosterone is derived from cholesterol . The first step in the biosynthesis involves the oxidative cleavage of the side-chain of cholesterol by cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc, CYP11A1), a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 oxidase with the loss of six carbon atoms to give pregnenolone. In the next step, two additional carbon atoms are removed by the CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum to yield a variety of C19 steroids. In addition, the 3β-hydroxyl group is oxidized by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to produce androstenedione. In the final and rate limiting step, the C17 keto group androstenedione is reduced by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to yield testosterone.

The largest amounts of testosterone (&gt;95%) are produced by the testes in men, while the adrenal glands account for most of the remainder. Testosterone is also synthesized in far smaller total quantities in women by the adrenal glands, thecal cells of the ovaries, and, during pregnancy, by the placenta. In the testes, testosterone is produced by the Leydig cells. The male generative glands also contain Sertoli cells, which require testosterone for spermatogenesis. Like most hormones, testosterone is supplied to target tissues in the blood where much of it is transported bound to a specific plasma protein, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).

====Regulation====
In males, testosterone is synthesized primarily in Leydig cells. The number of Leydig cells in turn is regulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In addition, the amount of testosterone produced by existing Leydig cells is under the control of LH, which regulates the expression of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.

The amount of testosterone synthesized is regulated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–testicular axis . When testosterone levels are low, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is released by the hypothalamus, which in turn stimulates the pituitary gland to release FSH and LH. These latter two hormones stimulate the testis to synthesize testosterone. Finally, increasing levels of testosterone through a negative feedback loop act on the hypothalamus and pituitary to inhibit the release of GnRH and FSH/LH, respectively.

Factors affecting testosterone levels may include:
* Age: Testosterone levels gradually reduce as men age. This effect is sometimes referred to as andropause or late-onset hypogonadism.
* Exercise: Resistance training increases testosterone levels acutely, however, in older men, that increase can be avoided by protein ingestion. Endurance training in men may lead to lower testosterone levels.
* Nutrients: Vitamin A deficiency may lead to sub-optimal plasma testosterone levels. The secosteroid vitamin D in levels of 400–1000 IU/d (10–25 μg/d) raises testosterone levels. Zinc deficiency lowers testosterone levels but over-supplementation has no effect on serum testosterone. There is limited evidence that low-fat diets may reduce total and free testosterone levels in men.
* Weight loss: Reduction in weight may result in an increase in testosterone levels. Fat cells synthesize the enzyme aromatase, which converts testosterone, the male sex hormone, into estradiol, the female sex hormone. However no clear association between body mass index and testosterone levels has been found.
* Miscellaneous: &quot;Sleep&quot;: (REM sleep) increases nocturnal testosterone levels. 
* Behavior: Dominance challenges can, in some cases, stimulate increased testosterone release in men. 
* Foods: Natural or man-made antiandrogens including spearmint tea reduce testosterone levels. Licorice can decrease the production of testosterone and this effect is greater in females.

===Distribution===
The plasma protein binding of testosterone is 98.0 to 98.5%, with 1.5 to 2.0% free or unbound. It is bound 65% to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and 33% bound weakly to albumin.

===Metabolism===
Both testosterone and 5α-DHT are metabolized mainly in the liver. Approximately 50% of testosterone is metabolized via conjugation into testosterone glucuronide and to a lesser extent testosterone sulfate by glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases, respectively. An additional 40% of testosterone is metabolized in equal proportions into the 17-ketosteroids androsterone and etiocholanolone via the combined actions of 5α- and 5β-reductases, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and 17β-HSD, in that order. Androsterone and etiocholanolone are then glucuronidated and to a lesser extent sulfated similarly to testosterone. The conjugates of testosterone and its hepatic metabolites are released from the liver into circulation and excreted in the urine and bile. Only a small fraction (2%) of testosterone is excreted unchanged in the urine.

In the hepatic 17-ketosteroid pathway of testosterone metabolism, testosterone is converted in the liver by 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase into 5α-DHT and the inactive 5β-DHT, respectively. Then, 5α-DHT and 5β-DHT are converted by 3α-HSD into 3α-androstanediol and 3α-etiocholanediol, respectively. Subsequently, 3α-androstanediol and 3α-etiocholanediol are converted by 17β-HSD into androsterone and etiocholanolone, which is followed by their conjugation and excretion. 3β-Androstanediol and 3β-etiocholanediol can also be formed in this pathway when 5α-DHT and 5β-DHT are acted upon by 3β-HSD instead of 3α-HSD, respectively, and they can then be transformed into epiandrosterone and epietiocholanolone, respectively. A small portion of approximately 3% of testosterone is reversibly converted in the liver into androstenedione by 17β-HSD.

In addition to conjugation and the 17-ketosteroid pathway, testosterone can also be hydroxylated and oxidized in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. 6β-Hydroxylation and to a lesser extent 16β-hydroxylation are the major transformations. The 6β-hydroxylation of testosterone is catalyzed mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP3A5 and is responsible for 75 to 80% of cytochrome P450-mediated testosterone metabolism. In addition to 6β- and 16β-hydroxytestosterone, 1β-, 2α/β-, 11β-, and 15β-hydroxytestosterone are also formed as minor metabolites. Certain cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 can also oxidize testosterone at the C17 position to form androstenedione.

Two of the immediate metabolites of testosterone, 5α-DHT and estradiol, are biologically important and can be formed both in the liver and in extrahepatic tissues. Approximately 5 to 7% of testosterone is converted by 5α-reductase into 5α-DHT, with circulating levels of 5α-DHT about 10% of those of testosterone, and approximately 0.3% of testosterone is converted into estradiol by aromatase. 5α-Reductase is highly expressed in the male reproductive organs (including the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and epididymides), skin, hair follicles, and brain and aromatase is highly expressed in adipose tissue, bone, and the brain. As much as 90% of testosterone is converted into 5α-DHT in so-called androgenic tissues with high 5α-reductase expression, and due to the several-fold greater potency of 5α-DHT as an AR agonist relative to testosterone, it has been estimated that the effects of testosterone are potentiated 2- to 3-fold in such tissues.

===Levels===
Total levels of testosterone in the body have been reported as 264 to 916 ng/dL (nanograms per deciliter) in non-obese European and American men age 19 to 39 years, while mean testosterone levels in adult men have been reported as 630 ng/dL. Although commonly used as a reference range, some physicians have disputed the use of this range to determine hypogonadism. Several professional medical groups have recommended that 350 ng/dL generally be considered the minimum normal level, which is consistent with previous findings. Levels of testosterone in men decline with age. In women, mean levels of total testosterone have been reported to be 32.6 ng/dL. In women with hyperandrogenism, mean levels of total testosterone have been reported to be 62.1 ng/dL.



==Measurement==
In measurements of testosterone in blood samples, different assay techniques can yield different results. Immunofluorescence assays exhibit considerable variability in quantifying testosterone concentrations in blood samples due to the cross-reaction of structurally similar steroids, leading to overestimating the results. In contrast, the liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method is more desirable: it offers superior specificity and precision, making it a more suitable choice for this application.

Testosterone&#x27;s bioavailable concentration is commonly determined using the Vermeulen calculation or more precisely using the modified Vermeulen method, which considers the dimeric form of sex hormone-binding globulin.

Both methods use chemical equilibrium to derive the concentration of bioavailable testosterone: in circulation, testosterone has two major binding partners, albumin (weakly bound) and sex hormone-binding globulin (strongly bound). These methods are described in detail in the accompanying figure.

== Distribution ==
Testosterone has been detected at variably higher and lower levels among men of various nations and from various backgrounds, explanations for the causes of this have been relatively diverse.

People from nations of the Eurasian Steppe and Central Asia, such as Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, have consistently been detected to have had significantly elevated levels of testosterone, while people from Central European and Baltic nations such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia and Estonia have been found to have had significantly decreased levels of testosterone.

The region with the highest-ever tested levels of testosterone is Chita, Russia, the people group with the highest ever tested levels of testosterone were the Yakuts.

==History and production==

A testicular action was linked to circulating blood fractions – now understood to be a family of androgenic hormones – in the early work on castration and testicular transplantation in fowl by Arnold Adolph Berthold (1803–1861). Research on the action of testosterone received a brief boost in 1889, when the Harvard professor Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard (1817–1894), then in Paris, self-injected subcutaneously a &quot;rejuvenating elixir&quot; consisting of an extract of dog and guinea pig testicle. He reported in &quot;The Lancet&quot; that his vigor and feeling of well-being were markedly restored but the effects were transient, and Brown-Séquard&#x27;s hopes for the compound were dashed. Suffering the ridicule of his colleagues, he abandoned his work on the mechanisms and effects of androgens in human beings.

In 1927, the University of Chicago&#x27;s Professor of Physiologic Chemistry, Fred C. Koch, established easy access to a large source of bovine testicles – the Chicago stockyards – and recruited students willing to endure the tedious work of extracting their isolates. In that year, Koch and his student, Lemuel McGee, derived 20 mg of a substance from a supply of 40 pounds of bovine testicles that, when administered to castrated roosters, pigs and rats, re-masculinized them. The group of Ernst Laqueur at the University of Amsterdam purified testosterone from bovine testicles in a similar manner in 1934, but the isolation of the hormone from animal tissues in amounts permitting serious study in humans was not feasible until three European pharmaceutical giants – Schering (Berlin, Germany), Organon (Oss, Netherlands) and Ciba – began full-scale steroid research and development programs in the 1930s.

The Organon group in the Netherlands were the first to isolate the hormone, identified in a May 1935 paper &quot;On Crystalline Male Hormone from Testicles (Testosterone)&quot;. They named the hormone &quot;testosterone&quot;, from the stems of &quot;testicle&quot; and &quot;sterol&quot;, and the suffix of &quot;ketone&quot;. The structure was worked out by Schering&#x27;s Adolf Butenandt, at the &quot;Chemisches Institut&quot; of Technical University in Gdańsk.

The chemical synthesis of testosterone from cholesterol was achieved in August that year by Butenandt and Hanisch. Only a week later, the Ciba group in Zurich, Leopold Ruzicka (1887–1976) and A. Wettstein, published their synthesis of testosterone. These independent partial syntheses of testosterone from a cholesterol base earned both Butenandt and Ruzicka the joint 1939 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Testosterone was identified as 17β-hydroxyandrost-4-en-3-one (C19H28O2), a solid polycyclic alcohol with a hydroxyl group at the 17th carbon atom. This also made it obvious that additional modifications on the synthesized testosterone could be made, i.e., esterification and alkylation.

The partial synthesis in the 1930s of abundant, potent testosterone esters permitted the characterization of the hormone&#x27;s effects, so that Kochakian and Murlin (1936) were able to show that testosterone raised nitrogen retention (a mechanism central to anabolism) in the dog, after which Allan Kenyon&#x27;s group was able to demonstrate both anabolic and androgenic effects of testosterone propionate in eunuchoidal men, boys, and women. The period of the early 1930s to the 1950s has been called &quot;The Golden Age of Steroid Chemistry&quot;, and work during this period progressed quickly.

Like other androsteroids, testosterone is manufactured industrially from microbial fermentation of plant cholesterol (e.g., from soybean oil). In the early 2000s, the steroid market weighed around one million tonnes and was worth $10 billion, making it the 2nd largest biopharmaceutical market behind antibiotics.

==Other species==
Testosterone is observed in most vertebrates. Testosterone and the classical nuclear androgen receptor first appeared in gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates). Agnathans (jawless vertebrates) such as lampreys do not produce testosterone but instead use androstenedione as a male sex hormone. Fish make a slightly different form called 11-ketotestosterone. Its counterpart in insects is ecdysone. The presence of these ubiquitous steroids in a wide range of animals suggest that sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history.

<doc id="30984" wikidata="Q53268" url="?curid=30984" title="Toyota">
<text>is a Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Toyota City, Aichi, Japan. It was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda and incorporated on August 28, 1937. Toyota is the largest automobile manufacturer in the world, producing about 10 million vehicles per year.

The company was founded as a spinoff of Toyota Industries, a machine maker started by Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro&#x27;s father. Both companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world. While still a department of Toyota Industries, the company developed its first product, the Type A engine, in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA.

After World War II, Toyota benefited from Japan&#x27;s alliance with the United States to learn from American automakers and other companies, which gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the small company into a leader in the industry and was the subject of many academic studies.

In the 1960s, Toyota took advantage of the rapidly growing Japanese economy to sell cars to a growing middle-class, leading to the development of the Toyota Corolla, which became the world&#x27;s all-time best-selling automobile. The booming economy also funded an international expansion that allowed Toyota to grow into one of the largest automakers in the world, the largest company in Japan and the ninth-largest company in the world by revenue, . Toyota was the world&#x27;s first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million vehicles per year, a record set in 2012, when it also reported the production of its 200 millionth vehicle. By September 2023, total production reached 300 million vehicles.

Toyota was praised for being a leader in the development and sales of more fuel-efficient hybrid electric vehicles, starting with the introduction of the original Toyota Prius in 1997. The company now sells more than 40 hybrid vehicle models around the world. More recently, the company has also been criticized for being slow to adopt all-electric vehicles, instead focusing on the development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, like the Toyota Mirai, a technology that is much costlier and has fallen far behind electric batteries in terms of adoption.

, the Toyota Motor Corporation produces vehicles under four brands: Daihatsu, Hino, Lexus and the namesake Toyota. The company also holds a 20% stake in Subaru Corporation, a 5.1% stake in Mazda, a 4.9% stake in Suzuki, a 4.6% stake in Isuzu, a 3.8% stake in Yamaha Motor Corporation, and a 2.8% stake in Panasonic, as well as stakes in vehicle manufacturing joint-ventures in China (FAW Toyota and GAC Toyota), the Czech Republic (TPCA), India (Toyota Kirloskar) and the United States (MTMUS).

Toyota is listed on the London Stock Exchange, Nagoya Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where its stock is a component of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Core30 indices.

==History==
===1920s–1930s===

In 1924, Sakichi Toyoda invented the Toyoda Model G Automatic loom. The principle of &quot;jidoka&quot;, which means the machine stops itself when a problem occurs, became later a part of the Toyota Production System. Looms were built on a small production line. In 1929, the patent for the automatic loom was sold to the British company Platt Brothers, generating the starting capital for automobile development.

Under the direction of the founder&#x27;s son, Kiichiro Toyoda, Toyoda Automatic Loom Works established an Automobile Division on September 1, 1933, and formally declared its intention to begin manufacturing automobiles on January 29, 1934. A prototype Toyota Type A engine was completed on September 25, 1934, with the company&#x27;s first prototype sedan, the A1, completed the following May. As Kiichiro had limited experience with automobile production, he initially focused on truck production; the company&#x27;s first truck, the G1, was completed on August 25, 1935, and debuted on November 21 in Tokyo, becoming the company&#x27;s first production model. Modeled on a period Ford truck, the G1 sold for ¥2,900, ¥200 cheaper than the Ford truck. A total of 379 G1 trucks were ultimately produced.

In April 1936, Toyoda&#x27;s first passenger car, the Model AA, was completed. The sales price was ¥3,350, ¥400 cheaper than Ford or GM cars. The company&#x27;s plant at Kariya was completed in May. In July, the company filled its first export order, with four G1 trucks exported to northeastern China. On September 19, 1936, the Japanese imperial government officially designated Toyota Automatic Loom Works as an automotive manufacturer.

Vehicles were originally sold under the name &quot;Toyoda&quot; (トヨダ), from the family name of the company&#x27;s founder, Kiichirō Toyoda. In September 1936, the company ran a public competition to design a new logo. Of 27,000 entries, the winning entry was the three Japanese &quot;katakana&quot; letters for &quot;Toyoda&quot; in a circle. However, Rizaburo Toyoda, who had married into the family and was not born with that name, preferred &quot;Toyota&quot; () because it took eight brush strokes (a lucky number) to write in Japanese, was visually simpler (leaving off the diacritic at the end), and with a voiceless consonant instead of a voiced one (voiced consonants are considered to have a &quot;murky&quot; or &quot;muddy&quot; sound compared to voiceless consonants, which are &quot;clear&quot;).

Since &quot;toyoda&quot; literally means &quot;fertile rice paddies&quot;, changing the name also prevented the company from being associated with old-fashioned farming. The newly formed word was trademarked and the company began trading on August 28, 1937, as the Toyota Motor Company Ltd. Kiichiro&#x27;s brother-in-law Rizaburo Toyoda was appointed the firm&#x27;s first president, with Kiichiro as vice-president. Toyota Automatic Loom Works formally transferred automobile manufacturing to the new entity on September 29.

The Japanese government supported the company by preventing foreign competitors Ford and General Motors from importing automobiles into Japan.

At the onset of World War II, Toyota almost exclusively produced standard-sized trucks for the Japanese Army, which paid one-fifth of the price in advance and the remainder in cash upon delivery.

===1940s===
Japan was heavily damaged in World War II and Toyota&#x27;s plants, which were used for the war effort, were not spared. On August 14, 1945, one day before the surrender of Japan, Toyota&#x27;s Koromo Plant was bombed by the Allied forces. After the surrender, the U.S.-led occupying forces banned passenger car production in Japan. However, automakers like Toyota were allowed to begin building trucks for civilian use, in an effort to rebuild the nation&#x27;s infrastructure. The U.S. military also contracted with Toyota to repair its vehicles.

By 1947, there was an emerging global Cold War between the Soviet Union and the U.S., who had been allies in World War II. U.S. priorities shifted (the &quot;Reverse Course&quot;) from punishing and reforming Japan to ensuring internal political stability, rebuilding the economy, and, to an extent, remilitarizing Japan. Under these new policies, in 1949, Japanese automakers were allowed to resume passenger car production, but at the same time, a new economic stabilization program to control inflation plunged the automotive industry into a serious shortage of funds, while many truck owners defaulted on their loans. Ultimately, the Bank of Japan, the central bank of the country, bailed out the company, with demands that the company institute reforms.

=== 1950s ===
As the 1950s began, Toyota emerged from its financial crisis a smaller company, closing factories and laying off workers. Meanwhile, the Korean War broke out, and being located so close to the battlefront, the U.S. Army placed an order for 1,000 trucks from Toyota. The order helped to rapidly improve the struggling company&#x27;s business performance. In 1950, company executives, including Kiichiro&#x27;s cousin Eiji Toyoda, took a trip to the United States where they trained at the Ford Motor Company and observed the operations of dozens of U.S. manufacturers. The knowledge they gained during the trip, along with what the company learned making looms, gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the company into a leader in the manufacturing industry.

Toyota started developing its first full-fledged passenger car, the Toyopet Crown, in 1952. Prior to the Crown, Toyota had been outsourcing the design and manufacturing of auto bodies, which were then mounted on truck frames made by Toyota. The project was a major test for Toyota, who would need to build bodies and develop a new chassis that would be comfortable, but still stand up to the muddy, slow, unpaved roads common in Japan at the time. The project had been championed for many years by founder Kiichiro Toyoda, who died suddenly on March 27, 1952. The first prototypes were completed in June 1953 and began extensive testing, before the Crown went on sale in August 1955. The car was met with positive reviews from around the world.

After the introduction of the Crown, Toyota began aggressively expanding into the export market; the company entered Saudi Arabia for the first time in 1955 with Land Cruisers, following an agreement reached with Abdul Latif Jameel (founder of his company of the same name); Toyota also brought Land Cruisers into neighboring Yemen in 1956. In 1958, Toyota established a production facility in Brazil, the company&#x27;s first outside of Japan.

Toyota entered the United States market in 1958, attempting to sell the Toyopet Crown. The company faced problems almost immediately. The company had to confront for the first time how its name sounded to native speakers of the English language; namely, &quot;Toyota&quot; has the English word &quot;toy&quot; in its first syllable. Toyota Motor Sales, USA&#x27;s first sales administrator James F. McGraw bluntly told his new Japanese supervisors after joining the company in 1959: &quot;&#x27;Toy&#x27; sounds like a toy and toys break&quot;. The Crown was a flop in the U.S. market, with buyers finding it overpriced and underpowered (because it was designed for endurance on the bad roads of Japan, not high-speed performance on the good roads of America). In response, exports of the Crown to the United States were suspended in the early 1960s in favor of the Land Cruiser and the Tiara.

After Kiichiro&#x27;s death, his cousin Eiji Toyoda led the company for the two decades. Eiji helped establish the company&#x27;s first plant independent from the Loom Works plant.

===1960s–1970s===

At the start of the 1960s, the Japanese economy was booming, a period that came to be known as the Japanese economic miracle. As the economy grew, so did the income of everyday people, who now could afford to purchase a vehicle. At the same time, the Japanese government heavily invested in improving road infrastructure. To take advantage of the moment, Toyota and other automakers started offering affordable economy cars like the Toyota Corolla, which became the world&#x27;s all-time best-selling automobile.

Toyota also found success in the United States in 1965 with the Toyota Corona compact car, which was redesigned specifically for the American market with a more powerful engine. The Corona helped increase U.S. sales of Toyota vehicles to more than 20,000 units in 1966 (a threefold increase) and helped the company become the third-best-selling import brand in the United States by 1967. Toyota&#x27;s first manufacturing investment in the United States came in 1972 when the company struck a deal with Atlas Fabricators, to produce truck beds in Long Beach, in an effort to avoid the 25% &quot;chicken tax&quot; on imported light trucks. By importing the truck as an incomplete chassis cab (the truck without a bed), the vehicle only faced a 4% tariff. Once in the United States, Atlas would build the truck beds and attach them to the trucks. The partnership was successful and two years later, Toyota purchased Atlas.

In Southeast Asia, Toyota made efforts to establish domestic production in the Philippines and Indonesia in early 1970s. In the Philippines, it partnered with local company Delta Motor Corporation. Toyota assisted Delta Motor with capital procurement and technology transfers. In 1973, Delta Motor commenced operations at a new plant, beginning local production of engine blocks for the Toyota Corona 12R engine and other parts. In Indonesia, Toyota established Toyota Astra Motor as a joint venture with local partner Astra International in 1971, and conducted significant retooling at the PT Gaya Motor assembly plant. The plant began assembling various models, including the Toyota Corona, Toyota Land Cruiser, large trucks, and the Toyota Corolla, with production surpassing 10,000 vehicles by 1973. For both countries, Toyota developed a basic utility vehicle (BUV) with the local partners to meet local needs and support technology transfers, in response to domestic production policies in Asia. The first prototype of the BUV was completed in January 1975. The BUV was launched as the Toyota Tamaraw in the Philippines in December 1976, and as the Toyota Kijang in June 1977. The vehicle was well received in both countries.

The energy crisis of the 1970s was a major turning point in the American auto industry. Before the crisis, large and heavy vehicles with powerful but inefficient engines were common. But in the years after, consumers started demanding high-quality and fuel-efficient small cars. Domestic automakers, in the midst of their malaise era, struggled to build these cars profitably, but foreign automakers like Toyota were well positioned. This, along with growing anti-Japanese sentiment, prompted the U.S. Congress to consider import restrictions to protect the domestic auto industry.

The 1960s also saw the slight opening of the Japanese auto market to foreign companies. In an effort to strengthen Japan&#x27;s auto industry ahead of the market opening, Toyota purchased stakes in other Japanese automakers. That included a stake in Hino Motors, a manufacturer of large commercial trucks, buses and diesel engines, along with a 16.8 percent stake in Daihatsu, a manufacturer of kei cars, the smallest highway-legal passenger vehicles sold in Japan. That began what became a long-standing partnership between Toyota and the two companies.

===1980s===
After the successes of the 1970s, and the threats of import restrictions, Toyota started making additional investments in the North American market in the 1980s. In 1981, Japan agreed to voluntary export restraints, which limited the number of vehicles the nation would send to the United States each year, leading Toyota to establish assembly plants in North America. The U.S. government also closed the loophole that allowed Toyota to pay lower taxes by building truck beds in America.

Also in 1981, Eiji Toyoda stepped down as president and assumed the title of chairman. He was succeeded as president by Shoichiro Toyoda, the son of the company&#x27;s founder. Within months, Shoichiro started to merge Toyota&#x27;s sales and production organizations, and in 1982 the combined companies became the Toyota Motor Corporation. The two groups were described as &quot;oil and water&quot; and it took years of leadership from Shoichiro to successfully combine them into one organization.

In Japan, Toyota offered mid-level luxury cars that were a class below the Crown and Century and offered hardtop coupes and sedans. The Supra, Mark II, Cresta and Chaser offered several trim packages with different engine displacements to provide buyers with annual road tax advantages. At the same time, sports cars like Celica, Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno sold very well.

Efforts to open a Toyota assembly plant in the United States started in 1980, with the company proposing a joint-venture with the Ford Motor Company. Those talks broke down in July 1981. Eventually in 1984, the company struck a deal with General Motors (GM) to establish a joint-venture vehicle manufacturing plant called NUMMI (New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.) in Fremont, California. GM saw the joint venture as a way to get access to a quality small car and an opportunity to learn about The Toyota Way and the Toyota Production System. For Toyota, the factory gave the company its first manufacturing base in North America allowing it to avoid any future tariffs on imported vehicles and saw GM as a partner who could show them how to navigate the American labor environment. The plant would be led by Tatsuro Toyoda, the younger brother of company president Shoichiro Toyoda. The first Toyota assembled in America, a white Corolla, rolled off the line at NUMMI on October 7, 1986.

Toyota received its first Japanese Quality Control Award at the start of the 1980s and began participating in a wide variety of motorsports. Conservative Toyota held on to rear-wheel-drive designs for longer than most; while a clear first in overall production they were only third in production of front-wheel-drive cars in 1983, behind Nissan and Honda. In part due to this, Nissan&#x27;s Sunny managed to squeeze by the Corolla in numbers built that year.

Before the decade was out, Toyota introduced Lexus, a new division that was formed to market and service luxury vehicles in international markets. Prior to the debut of Lexus, Toyota&#x27;s two existing flagship models, the Crown and Century, both catered exclusively for the Japanese market and had little global appeal that could compete with international luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar. The company had been developing the brand and vehicles in secret since August 1983, at a cost of over US$1 billion. The LS 400 flagship full-size sedan debuted in 1989 to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.

===1990s===

In the 1990s, Toyota began to branch out from producing mostly compact cars by adding many larger and more luxurious vehicles to its lineup, including a full-sized pickup, the T100 (and later the Tundra), several lines of SUVs, a sport version of the Camry, known as the Camry Solara. They would also launch newer iterations of their sports cars, namely the MR2, Celica, and Supra during this era.

In Japan, Toyota continued to cater to the growing demand for mid-level luxury cars and offered several conventional and pillared hardtops sedans at its Japanese dealership network. The Soarer, Mark II, Cresta, Chaser, Corona EXiV, and Carina ED found many buyers. At the same time, sports cars like the Supra, Celica, MR2, Corolla Levin, Sprinter Trueno, and even the subcompact Starlet GT reflected a time of prosperity.

December 1997 saw the introduction of the first-generation Toyota Prius, the first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid car. The vehicle would be produced exclusively for the Japanese market for the first two years.

With a major presence in Europe, due to the success of Toyota Team Europe in motorsport, the corporation decided to set up Toyota Motor Europe Marketing and Engineering, TMME, to help market vehicles in the continent. Two years later, Toyota set up a base in the United Kingdom, TMUK, as the company&#x27;s cars had become very popular among British drivers. Bases in Indiana, Virginia, and Tianjin were also set up.

Toyota also increased its ownership of Daihatsu during this period. In 1995, Toyota increased its shareholding in the company to 33.4 percent, giving Toyota the ability to veto shareholder resolutions at the annual meeting. In 1998, Toyota increased its holding in the company to 51.2 percent, becoming the majority shareholder.

On September 29, 1999, the company decided to list itself on the New York and London Stock Exchanges.

The later half of the 1990s would also see the Toyoda brothers step back from the company their father had founded. In 1992, Shoichiro Toyoda would shift to become chairman, allowing his brother Tatsuro to become president, a job he held until his retirement in 1995. Shoichiro would step down as chairman in 1999. Both would retain honorary advisory roles in the company. Hiroshi Okuda would lead the company as president from 1995 until 1999 when he became chairman and the President&#x27;s office would be filled by Fujio Cho.

===2000s===
In August 2000, exports began of the Prius. In 2001, Toyota acquired its long time partner, truck and bus manufacturer Hino Motors. In 2002, Toyota entered Formula One competition and established a manufacturing joint venture in France with French automakers Citroën and Peugeot. A youth-oriented marque for North America, Scion, was introduced in 2003. Toyota ranked eighth on Forbes 2000 list of the world&#x27;s leading companies for the year 2005. Also in 2005, Fujio Cho would shift to become chairman of Toyota and would be replaced as president by Katsuaki Watanabe.

In 2007, Toyota released an update of its full-sized truck, the Tundra, produced in two American factories, one in Texas and one in Indiana. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; named the 2007 Toyota Camry &quot;Car of the Year&quot; for 2007. It also began the construction of two new factories, one in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, and the other in Blue Springs, Mississippi, USA.

The company was number one in global automobile sales for the first quarter of 2008.

Toyota was hit by the global financial crisis of 2008 as it was forced in December 2008 to forecast its first annual loss in 70 years. In January 2009, it announced the closure of all of its Japanese plants for 11 days to reduce output and stocks of unsold vehicles.

In October 2009, Toyota announced that they were establishing an office in South Korea and launched the Camry sedan, Camry hybrid, Prius and the RAV4 during the launching event at the Grand Hyatt Seoul.

Between 2009 and 2011, Toyota conducted recalls of millions of vehicles after reports that several drivers experienced unintended acceleration. The recalls were to prevent a front driver&#x27;s side floor mat from sliding into the foot pedal well, causing the pedals to become trapped and to correct the possible mechanical sticking of the accelerator pedal. At least 37 were killed in crashes allegedly related to unintended acceleration, approximately 9 million cars and trucks were recalled, Toyota was sued for personal injuries and wrongful deaths, paid to settle a class action lawsuit to compensate owners for lost resale value, and paid a criminal penalty to the United States government over accusations that it had intentionally hid information about safety defects and had made deceptive statements to protect its brand image.

Amid the unintended acceleration scandal, Katsuaki Watanabe stepped down as company president. He was replaced by Akio Toyoda, grandson of company founder Kiichiro Toyoda, on June 23, 2009. Akio had been with Toyota since 1984, working jobs in production, marketing and product development, and took a seat on the board of directors in 2000. Akio&#x27;s promotion by the board marked the return of a member of the Toyoda family to the top leadership role for the first time since 1999.

=== 2010s ===
In 2011, Toyota, along with large parts of the Japanese automotive industry, suffered from a series of natural disasters. The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami led to a severe disruption of the supplier base and a drop in production and exports. Severe flooding during the 2011 monsoon season in Thailand affected Japanese automakers that had chosen Thailand as a production base. Toyota is estimated to have lost production of 150,000 units to the tsunami and production of 240,000 units to the floods.

On February 10, 2014, it was announced that Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia by the end of 2017. The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable, the high cost of local manufacture, and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market. The company planned to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017, and retain its Altona plant for other functions. The workforce was expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300. Both Ford Motor Company and General Motors (Holden) followed suit, ending Australian production in 2016 and 2017 respectively.

The automaker narrowly topped global sales for the first half of 2014, selling 5.1 million vehicles in the six months ending June 30, 2014, an increase of 3.8% on the same period the previous year. Volkswagen AG, which recorded sales of 5.07 million vehicles, was close behind.

In August 2014, Toyota announced it would be cutting its spare-parts prices in China by up to 35%. The company admitted the move was in response to a probe foreshadowed earlier in the month by China&#x27;s National Development and Reform Commission of Toyota&#x27;s Lexus spare-parts policies, as part of an industry-wide investigation into what the Chinese regulator considers exorbitantly high prices being charged by automakers for spare parts and after-sales servicing.

In November 2015, the company announced that it would invest over the next five years into artificial intelligence and robotics research. In 2016, Toyota invested in Uber. In 2020, a corporate governance report showed that Toyota owns 10.25 million shares of Uber, which was valued at $292.46 million as of March 30, 2020. According to Reuters, this was roughly 0.6 percent of Uber&#x27;s outstanding shares.

In March 2016, Toyota partnered with Yanmar to create a fiberglass pleasure boat using Yanmar outboard marine diesel engines or Toyota inboard engines.

In August 2016, the company purchased all remaining assets of Daihatsu, making the manufacturer of small cars a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota.

On August 27, 2018, Toyota announced an investment of in Uber&#x27;s autonomous cars.

In October 2019, Toyota backed the Trump Administration&#x27;s proposal that federal authority should override California&#x27;s ability to set its own emissions standards for automobiles. The proposal would reduce California&#x27;s 2025 fuel efficiency standard from about 54.5 to 37 MPG. This shift by Toyota away from fuel efficiency damaged the company&#x27;s reputation as a green brand.

===2020s===
By 2020, Toyota reclaimed its position as the largest automaker in the world, surpassing Volkswagen. It sold 9.528 million vehicles globally despite an 11.3% drop in sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes subsidiaries Daihatsu and Hino Motors.

On April 2, 2020, BYD and Toyota announced a new joint venture between the two companies called BYD Toyota EV Technology Co., Ltd., with the aim of &quot;developing BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) that appeal to customers.&quot;

In March 2021, Toyota, its subsidiary Hino, and Isuzu announced the creation of a strategic partnership between the three companies. Toyota acquired a 4.6% stake in Isuzu while the latter plans to acquire Toyota shares for an equivalent value. The three companies said they would form a new joint venture by April called Commercial Japan Partnership Technologies Corporation with the aim of developing fuel cell and electric light trucks. Toyota would own an 80% stake in the venture while Hino and Isuzu would own 10% each.

In April 2021, Toyota said that it will buy Lyft&#x27;s self-driving technology unit for $550 million and merge it with its newly created Woven Planet Holdings automation division.

In June 2021, the company defended its donations to the United States Republican lawmakers after they voted against certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, saying it did not believe it was &quot;appropriate to judge members of Congress&quot; for that one vote. A report by Axios found that Toyota was the top donor to 2020 election objectors, by a substantial margin. The company then reversed course in July 2021 and ceased donations to election objectors, releasing a statement saying it understood that its PAC&#x27;s donations to those objectors, which far outpaced those of any other company, &quot;troubled some stakeholders.&quot; Toyota resumed donations after a six-month pause.

In December 2021, Toyota announced that it would invest ($70 billion at 2021 exchange rate) in electric vehicles by 2030, launch 30 EV models worldwide by that year, and set a sales target of 3.5 million electric vehicles in 2030.

Toyota will increase its software engineer intake to around 40% to 50% of all technical hires from the second quarter of 2022, the move plans to address a transformation to so-called CASE — connected, autonomous, shared and electric — technologies in an environment of intensifying global competition.

In 2021, Toyota told some of its suppliers to increase their semiconductor inventory levels from the conventional three months to five months in response to the COVID-19 chip shortage. The &quot;just-in-time&quot; supply chain in which parts are only delivered when necessary, had already been revised after the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami in Japan, lifting inventories across the entire procurement network. The time it takes Toyota to turn over its inventory increased by around 40% during the past ten years, to 36.36 days .

In June 2022, Toyota recalled 2,700 of its first mass-produced all-electric vehicles due to worries that their wheels could fall off during driving. It was discovered that the bolts on the bZ4X&#x27;s wheels could loosen up to the point where the wheel simply detaches from the car, causing a loss of control over the vehicle and possible accident.

In August 2022, Toyota pledged up to $5.6 billion towards electric vehicle battery production and announced an increase in investment in its plant near Greensboro, North Carolina. Also in 2022, Toyota managed to maintain its position as the world&#x27;s best-selling automaker for the third year in a row.

In 2022, Toyota signed a deal with the British government to develop hydrogen-powered pickup trucks. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is investing in the research scheme, based at Burnaston, with a further coming through the Advanced Propulsion Centre UK (APC).

In January 2023, Toyota CEO and President Akio Toyoda announced that he was stepping down and passing the position on to Koji Sato. Akio is the great-grandson of company founder Rizaburo Toyoda. Sato had previously run Lexus, Toyota&#x27;s luxury car brand. The change is set to take effect on April 1, 2023.

In 2023, after negotiating with the unions, Toyota implemented the largest increase in employee wages in 20 years.

In July 2024, Toyota announced plans to build an electric car cell plant in Fukuoka and export them to the rest of Asia.

In October 18 2024, Toyota announced to return to Formula 1 after a 15-year absence, partnering with the US-based Haas team.

In November 2024, Toyota and Joby Aviation completed an air taxi test flight in Japan using an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Toyota had invested $394 million to Joby as part of a strategic alliance on commercial manufacturing.

==Product line==

Toyota officially lists approximately 70 different models sold under its namesake brand, including sedans, coupes, vans, trucks, hybrids, and crossovers. Many of these models are produced as passenger sedans, which range from the subcompact Toyota Yaris, compact Corolla, to mid-size Camry and full-size Avalon. Minivans include the Innova, Alphard/Vellfire, Sienna, and others. Several small cars, such as the xB and tC, were sold under the Scion brand.

===SUVs and crossovers===

Toyota SUV and crossover line-up grew quickly in the late 2010s to 2020s due to the market shift to SUVs. Toyota crossovers range from the subcompact Yaris Cross and C-HR, compact Corolla Cross and RAV4, to midsize Harrier/Venza and Kluger/Highlander. Other crossovers include the Raize, Urban Cruiser. Toyota SUVs range from the midsize Fortuner to full-size Land Cruiser. Other SUVs include the Rush, Prado, FJ Cruiser, 4Runner, and Sequoia.
===Pickup trucks===
Toyota first entered the pickup truck market in 1947 with the SB that was only sold in Japan and limited Asian markets. It was followed in 1954 by the RK (renamed in 1959 as the Stout) and in 1968 by the compact Hilux. With continued refinement, the Hilux (simply known as the Pickup in some markets) became famous for being extremely durable and reliable. Extended cab and crew cab versions were eventually added, and Toyota continues to produce them today under various names depending on the market in various cab lengths, with gasoline or diesel engines, and 2WD and 4WD versions.

In North America, the Hilux became a major model for the company, leading the company to launch the Tacoma in 1995. The Tacoma was based on the Hilux, but with a design intended to better suit the needs of North American consumers who often use pickup trucks as personal vehicles. The design was a success and the Tacoma became the best-selling compact pickup in North America.

After the success of its compact Hilux pickups in North America, Toyota decided to enter the full-size pickup market, which was traditionally dominated by domestic automakers. The company introduced the T100 for the 1993 US model year. The T100 had a full-size long bed, but suspension and engine characteristics were similar to that of a compact pickup. Sales were disappointing and the T100 was criticized for having a small V6 engine (especially compared to the V8 engines common in American full-size trucks), lacking an extended-cab version, being too small, and too expensive (because of the 25% tariff on imported trucks). In 1995, Toyota added the more powerful V6 engine from the new Tacoma to the T100 and also added an extended cab version. In 1999, Toyota replaced the T100 with the larger Tundra, which would be built in the US with a V8 engine and styling that more closely matched other American full-size trucks.

===Luxury vehicles===

In the Japanese home market, Toyota has two flagship models: the Crown premium sedan and the Century limousine.

In the 1980s, Toyota wanted to expand its luxury car offerings but realized that existing Japanese-market flagship models had little global appeal and could not compete with established brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar or the Acura and Infiniti marquees being launched by Japanese competitors.

Before the decade was out, Toyota introduced Lexus, a new division that was formed to market and service luxury vehicles in markets outside of Japan. The company developed the brand and its vehicles in secret since August 1983, at a cost of over US$1 billion. The Lexus LS flagship full-size sedan debuted in 1989 to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque. Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, convertible and SUV models.

The Lexus brand was introduced to the Japanese market in 2005, previously all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque.

===Buses===
The Toyota Coaster is a minibus introduced in 1969 that seats 17 passengers. The Coaster is widely used in Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Australia, but also in the developing world for minibus operators in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, the Caribbean, and South America to operate as public transportation.

==Technology==
===Hybrid electric vehicles===

Toyota is the world&#x27;s leader in sales of hybrid electric vehicles, one of the largest companies to encourage the mass-market adoption of hybrid vehicles across the globe, and the first to commercially mass-produce and sell such vehicles, with the introduction of the XW10 Toyota Prius in 1997. The company&#x27;s hybrid technology is called Hybrid Synergy Drive, and it was later applied to many vehicles in Toyota&#x27;s product lineup, starting first with the Camry and the technology was also brought to the luxury Lexus division.

, Toyota Motor Corporation sells 44 Toyota and Lexus hybrid passenger car models in over 90 countries and regions around the world, and the carmaker has sold over 15 million hybrid vehicles since 1997. The Prius family is the world&#x27;s top-selling hybrid gasoline-electric vehicle nameplate with almost 4 million units sold worldwide as of January 2017.

===Hydrogen fuel-cell===

In 2002, Toyota began a development and demonstration program to test the Toyota FCHV, a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell vehicle based on the Toyota Highlander production SUV. Toyota also built a FCHV bus based on the Hino Blue Ribbon City low-floor bus. Toyota has built several prototypes/concepts of the FCHV since 1997, including the Toyota FCHV-1, FCHV-2, FCHV-3, FCHV-4, and Toyota FCHV-adv. The Toyota FCV-R fuel cell concept car was unveiled at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show. The FCV-R sedan seats four and has a fuel cell stack including a 70 MPa high-pressure hydrogen tank, which can deliver a range of under the Japanese JC08 test cycle. Toyota said the car was planned for launch in about 2015.

In August 2012, Toyota announced its plans to start retail sales of a hydrogen fuel-cell sedan in California in 2015. Toyota expects to become a leader in this technology. The prototype of its first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle will be exhibited at the November 2013 Tokyo Motor Show, and in the United States at the January 2014 Consumer Electronics Show.

Toyota&#x27;s first hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles to be sold commercially, the Toyota Mirai (Japanese for &quot;future&quot;), was unveiled at the November 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show. In January 2015, it was announced that production of the Mirai fuel cell vehicle would increase from 700 units in 2015 to approximately 2,000 in 2016 and 3,000 in 2017. Sales in Japan began on December 15, 2014, at a price of (~). The Japanese government plans to support the commercialization of fuel-cell vehicles with a subsidy of (~). Retail sales in the U.S. began in August 2015 at a price of before any government incentives. Initially, the Mirai will only be available in California. The market release in Europe is slated for September 2015, and initially will be available only in the UK, Germany, and Denmark, followed by other countries in 2017. Pricing in Germany starts at (~) plus VAT ().

In 2015, Toyota released 5,600 patents for free use until 2020, hoping to promote global development of hydrogen fuel-cell technology.

Since the mid-2010s, Toyota has increased its focus on building hydrogen powered trucks. It first showcased a heavy-duty semi-truck tractor in 2017 and in 2023 announced a kit to convert existing diesel-powered truck engines to use hydrogen. In late 2022, the company signed an government deal with the UK&#x27;s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to help it develop a hydrogen-powered Hilux pickup truck.

===Plug-in hybrids===

The Prius Plug-In Hybrid Concept was exhibited in late 2009, and shortly after, a global demonstration program involving 600 pre-production test cars began. The vehicles were leased to fleet and government customers, and were equipped with data tracking devices to allow Toyota to monitor the car&#x27;s performance. The vehicle was based on the third-generation Toyota Prius and outfitted with two additional lithium-ion batteries beyond the normal hybrid battery pack. The additional batteries were used to operate the car with minimal use of the internal combustion engine until they are depleted, at which point they are disengaged from the system. They are not used in tandem with the main hybrid battery pack.

After the conclusion of the demonstration program, the production version of the Prius Plug-in Hybrid was unveiled in September 2011. The production Prius Plug-in had a maximum electric-only speed of , and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the vehicle as having a range of in blended mode (mostly electric, but supplemented by the internal combustion engine). Toyota ultimately only did a small production run with 75,400 vehicles being produced between 2012 and 2016.

The second-generation Prius Plug-in (renamed the Prius Prime in the US) was unveiled in early 2016. Unlike the prior generation, where the plug-in battery was limited by being added to the existing Prius, this model would be developed in tandem with the fourth-generation Prius, allowing Toyota to increase the range to , with a top speed of , without needing the assistance of the internal combustion engine. The second-generation Prius Plug-in went on sale starting in late 2016, with Toyota expecting to sell up to 60,000 units globally per year.

A second plug-in hybrid model, the Toyota RAV4 PHV (RAV4 Prime in the US) was unveiled in December 2019. The vehicle has an EPA-estimated of all-electric range and generates a combined , enabling it to be Toyota&#x27;s second fastest car currently in production (behind the GR Supra 3.0 sports car). Sales started in mid-2020.

===Battery electric vehicles===
Toyota has been criticized for being slow to add battery electric vehicles to its lineup. It has been publicly skeptical of battery-electric vehicles, instead focusing on hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and actively lobbying against government mandates to transition to zero-emissions vehicles.

, only a small proportion of the vehicles the company sells are of battery electric, which has prompted criticism by some environmental and public interest groups. The company plans to increase its sales of electric vehicles to 3.5 million per year by 2030. However, the company has stated that it believes other technologies, including hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, will continue to play a role in the future of the company.

Toyota created the first generation Toyota RAV4 EV (Electric Vehicle) as a compliance car after the California Air Resources Board mandated in the late 1990s that every automaker offer a zero-emissions vehicle. A total of 1,484 were leased and/or sold in California from 1997 to 2003, when the state dropped its mandate under legal pressure from lawsuits filed by automakers.

A second generation of the RAV4 EV was developed in 2010 as part of a deal with Tesla. The production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from Tesla. The RAV4 EV had a limited production run with just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014. According to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was &quot;marred by clashes between engineers&quot;.

Starting in 2009, Toyota introduced three generations of concept electric vehicles called the FT-EV built on a modified Toyota iQ platform. In late-2012, the company announced plans to build a production version of the car called the Toyota iQ EV (Scion iQ EV in the US, Toyota eQ in Japan), but ultimately production was cut back to 100 cars for special fleet use in Japan and the U.S. only.

In late 2012, Toyota announced that it would back away from fully electric vehicles, after producing less than 5,000. At the time, the company&#x27;s vice chairman, Takeshi Uchiyamada, said: &quot;&quot;The current capabilities of electric vehicles do not meet society&#x27;s needs, whether it may be the distance the cars can run, or the costs, or how it takes a long time to charge&quot;.&quot;

A shift in Toyota&#x27;s formerly battery-agnostic posture could be seen as early as 2016, when Toyota&#x27;s CFO Takahiko Ijichi &quot;sent a strong signal that Toyota soon plans to jump on the battery bandwagon and make electric cars despite expressing skeptical views about their range and charging times,&quot; as the Wall Street Journal wrote. Toyota said it would make and sell battery-electric vehicles if and where regulations and markets demand.

A year later, Toyota outlined its electric-vehicle plans for between 2020 and 2030 to the press in Tokyo, saying it would introduce &quot;more than 10&quot; battery-electric vehicles worldwide by the early 2020s, beginning in China, and later in Japan, Europe, the US and India.

In April 2019, Toyota introduced the C-HR EV, its first mass-produced pure electric model in China along with an identical twin called the IZOA EV. It went on sale in April 2020 and May 2020 respectively. Nikkei reported in October 2020 that Toyota had only sold less than 2,000 units in the first eight months of the year.

Toyota introduced the C+pod in late 2020, a 2-seater kei car with an estimated range of and a top speed of .

In December 2020, Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda stated that electric cars are excessively &quot;hyped&quot; and that, in Japan, they would not necessarily reduce carbon dioxide emissions since electricity is mostly generated by burning coal and natural gas in the country. He also said that the infrastructure needed for Japan to switch fully to EVs would cost between $135 billion and $358 billion and switching only to EVs would cost millions of jobs and make cars less affordable.

In April 2021, Toyota revealed the bZ4X, an electric crossover SUV that will be the first vehicle built on a dedicated electric platform called e-TNGA when it goes on sale in mid-2022. It is the first model of the bZ (&quot;beyond Zero&quot;) series of battery electric vehicles. The company has also stated that there will be seven &quot;bZ&quot; models to be launched globally out of 15 BEV models by 2025.

In June 2021, Transport &amp; Environment ranked Toyota as the least ready OEM to transition to battery electric vehicles by 2030, stating: &quot;Toyota has not set a target for 2030 and it plans to produce just 10% BEVs in 2025. It is expected to rely on polluting hybrid technologies.&quot;

In December 2021, Toyota announced in Tokyo plans for 30 battery-electric models by 2030, to sell 3.5 million BEVs per year by that date, and that its premium-brand Lexus will be 100% battery-operated by 2030 in North America, Europe, and China. The company announced investments of $70 billion into the company&#x27;s electrification.

In a session in parallel with the G-7 Meeting 2023 May, Akio Toyoda said that battery electric vehicles are not solely the future, instead offering a mix of battery electric, internal combustion engine-equipped and hydrogen cars.

Toyota has been developing solid-state batteries in partnership with Panasonic, in which the company has more than a thousand patents covering solid-state batteries by late 2020. The technology has been implemented on the Toyota LQ concept. Toyota hopes the technology could increase efficiency of battery electric vehicles by 30 percent, which in turn would reduce battery costs by the same amount.

===Autonomous vehicles===

Toyota is also regarded as lagging when it comes to developing smart car technology. Although the company unveiled its first self-driving test vehicle in 2017, and has been developing its own self-driving technology named &quot;Chauffeur&quot; (intended for full self-driving) and &quot;Guardian&quot; (a driver assist system), neither of these has been introduced into any production vehicles.

The company had set up a large research and development operation by 2018, spending almost US$4 billion to start an autonomous vehicle research institute in California&#x27;s Silicon Valley and another ¥300 billion on a similar research institute in Tokyo that would partner with fellow Toyota Group companies and automotive suppliers Aisin Seiki and Denso.

Toyota has also been collaborating with autonomous vehicle technology developers and, in some cases, purchasing the companies. Toyota has acquired the autonomous vehicle division of ride-hailing service Lyft for $550 million, invested a total of US$1 billion in competing ride-hailing service Uber&#x27;s self-driving vehicle division, invested $400 million in autonomous vehicle technology company Pony.ai, and announced a partnership with Chinese electronics e-commerce company Cogobuy to build a &quot;Smart Car Ecosystem.&quot;

In December 2020, Toyota showcased the 20-passenger &quot;e-Palette&quot; shared autonomous vehicle, which saw its first major use at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Toyota has announced it intends to have the vehicle available for commercial applications before 2025.

Since February 2021, Toyota has been building the &quot;Woven City&quot; which it calls a &quot;175-acre high tech, sensor-laden metropolis&quot; at the foot of Mount Fuji. When completed in 2024, the Woven City will be used to run tests on autonomous vehicles for deliveries, transport and mobile shops, with the city&#x27;s residents participating in the living laboratory experiment.

==Motorsports==

Toyota has been involved in many global motorsports series, providing vehicles, engines and other auto parts under both the Toyota and Lexus brands.

Toyota Gazoo Racing (GR) is Toyota&#x27;s performance brand that is used in many of the world&#x27;s major motorsports contests. Toyota Gazoo Racing Europe, based in Cologne, Germany, competes in the FIA World Endurance Championship, while the Finland-based Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT participates in the FIA World Rally Championship. Toyota Gazoo Racing South Africa competes in the Dakar Rally. Between 2002 and 2009, the Toyota Racing team competed in Formula One. Toyota won the highest class of the 24 Hours of Le Mans 5 consecutive times from 2018 to 2022, competing with the Toyota TS050 Hybrid and Toyota GR010 Hybrid.

Toyota Racing Development USA (TRD USA) is responsible for participation in major motorsports contests in the United States including NASCAR, NHRA, Indy Racing League and Formula Drift.

Toyota also makes engines and other auto parts for other Japanese motorsports including Super Formula, Super GT, Formula 3, and Toyota Racing Series.

==Non-automotive activities==
===Aerospace===
Toyota is a minority shareholder in Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation, having invested in the new venture which will produce the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, slated for first deliveries in 2017. Toyota has also studied participation in the general aviation market and contracted with Scaled Composites to produce a proof of concept aircraft, the TAA-1, in 2002.

===Pleasure boats===
In 1997, building on a previous partnership with Yamaha Marine, Toyota created &quot;Toyota Marine&quot;, building private ownership motorboats, currently sold only in Japan. A small network in Japan sells the luxury craft at 54 locations, called the &quot;Toyota Ponam&quot; series, and in 2017, a boat was labeled under the Lexus brand name starting May 26, 2017.

===Philanthropy===

Toyota works with nonprofits to improve their processes and operations such as the Food Bank For New York City.

===Robotics===

In 2004, Toyota showcased its trumpet-playing robot. Toyota has been developing multitask robots destined for elderly care, manufacturing, and entertainment. A specific example of Toyota&#x27;s involvement in robotics for the elderly is the Brain Machine Interface. Designed for use with wheelchairs, it &quot;allows a person to control an electric wheelchair accurately, almost in real-time&quot;, with his or her mind. The thought controls allow the wheelchair to go left, right, and forward with a delay between thought and movement of just 125 milliseconds. Toyota also played a part in the development of Kirobo, a &#x27;robotic astronaut&#x27;.

In 2017, the company introduced T-HR3, a humanoid robot with the ability to be remotely controlled. The robot can copy the motions of a connected person. The 2017 version used wires for the connection but the 2018 version used 5G from a distance up to .

===Sewing machine brand===
Aisin, another member of the Toyota Group of companies, uses the same Toyota wordmark logo to market its home-use sewing machines. Aisin was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda after he founded the Toyota Motor Corporation. According to Aisin, he was so pleased with the first sewing machine, he decided to apply the same Toyota branding as his auto business, despite the companies being independent from each other.

===Carbon removal===
Toyota Ventures, along with JetBlue Technology Ventures and Parley for the Oceans, is among the corporate investors that have invested $40 million in the Air Company, a carbon negative vodka distiller and perfume and hand sanitizer manufacturer that uses heterogeneous catalysis to convert captured carbon into ethanol.

===Environmental initiatives===

Toyota states it is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and it has set a goal to reduce its overall carbon emissions by 90% by 2050, compared to 2010 levels.

The company has invested heavily in solar energy, with a goal to install solar panels on the rooftops of all its dealerships worldwide by 2050. In addition, Toyota has partnered with various renewable energy companies to promote the use of wind and solar power, including a recent partnership with ENEOS Corporation to develop hydrogen refueling stations in Japan.

Toyota has launched a program called &quot;Global Environmental Challenge&quot; 2050 which is a comprehensive initiative aimed at reducing the environmental impact of Toyota&#x27;s operations. The challenge includes six environmental goals that Toyota aims to achieve by 2050, including reducing carbon emissions, minimizing water usage, promoting the recycling and reuse of materials, and promoting the use of renewable energy. The company has also implemented a variety of initiatives to promote sustainability across its supply chain, including efforts to reduce waste, water usage, and promote sustainable agriculture. For example, Toyota has implemented a zero-waste initiative at its manufacturing plants, aiming to send zero waste to landfills.

==Controversies==
=== Corrosion lawsuit ===
In November 2016, Toyota agreed to pay $3.4 billion to settle allegations that roughly one-and-a-half million of its Tacoma, Tundra, and Sequoia pickup trucks and SUVs had been outfitted with frames prone to corrosion and perforation. According to court papers, the corrosion could reach levels high enough to compromise the vehicle&#x27;s structural integrity.

=== Death from overwork ===
On February 9, 2002, Kenichi Uchino, aged 30 years, a quality control manager, collapsed then died at work. On January 2, 2006, an unnamed chief engineer of the Camry Hybrid, aged 45 years, died from heart failure in his bed.

===Fines for environmental breaches===
In 2003, Toyota was fined $34 million for violating the United States Clean Air Act, as 2.2 million vehicles it sold had defective smog-control computers.

In January 2021, Toyota was fined $180 million for delays in reporting emissions-related defects to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) between 2005 and 2015. The acting U.S. attorney said that the delays &quot;likely led to delayed or avoided emissions-related recalls&quot;, although Toyota stated that despite the delays in reporting the issues to the EPA, it had notified customers and fixed the cars with the emissions defects. At the time, this was the biggest civil penalty ever levied for violating the EPA&#x27;s emission reporting requirements.

=== 2009–2011 unintended acceleration recalls ===
Between 2009 and 2011 Toyota, under pressure from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), conducted recalls of millions of vehicles after reports that several drivers experienced unintended acceleration. The first recall, in November 2009, was to prevent a front driver&#x27;s side floor mat from sliding into the foot pedal well, causing the pedals to become trapped. The second recall, in January 2010, was begun after some crashes were shown not to have been caused by floor mats and may be caused by possible mechanical sticking of the accelerator pedal. Worldwide, approximately 9 million cars and trucks were impacted by the recalls.

NHTSA received reports of a total of 37 deaths allegedly related to unintended acceleration, although an exact number was never verified. As a result of the problems, Toyota faced nearly 100 lawsuits from the families of those killed, drivers who were injured, vehicle owners who lost resale value, and investors who saw a drop in the value of their shares. While most of the personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits were settled confidentially, Toyota did spend more than to settle a class action lawsuit to compensate owners for lost resale value, and the company agreed to pay a criminal penalty to the United States government over accusations that it had intentionally hid information about safety defects from the public and had made deceptive statements to protect its brand image. The penalty was the largest ever levied against a car company.

=== Takata airbag recalls ===
Toyota was impacted by a recall of faulty airbag inflators made by Takata. The inflators can explode, shooting metal fragments into the vehicle cabin. Millions of vehicles produced between 2000 and 2014 were impacted by the recall, with some needing multiple repairs. , over 100 million Takata air bag inflators worldwide have been recalled by more than 20 carmakers.

=== June 2010 Chinese labour strike ===
On June 21, 2010, a Chinese labor strike happened in Tianjin Toyoda Gosei Co, Tianjin. Workers demanded better wages and treatment.

=== Extremist usage ===
In 2015, U.S. officials asked Toyota how the Islamic State was in possession of so many Toyota trucks. Toyota cars have also been documented to have been used by other extremist organizations such as the Taliban, Hamas, Al-shabab and Somali pirates. Toyota representatives have said the company has a strict policy to not sell vehicles to potential purchasers who may use or modify them for paramilitary or terrorist activities and that it cannot track aftermarket sales and that it has worked with the U.S Treasury to brief them on Toyota&#x27;s supply chain on the Middle East.

=== Misleading marketing ===
In its marketing, Toyota has often referred to its non-plug-in hybrid vehicles as &quot;self-charging hybrid&quot; vehicles. The use of the term has caused some criticism that this is misleading, as some consumers were led to erroneously believe that these vehicles charge their batteries on their own when the vehicles are not used. Complaints about self-charging hybrid advertising were recorded in Ireland, although the complaints were rejected by the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland. However, in 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Authority banned the adverts outright in Norway, stating: &quot;It is misleading to give the impression that the power to the hybrid battery is free of charge, since the electricity produced by the car has consumption of gasoline as a necessary condition.&quot;

Electric vehicle website IrishEVs criticised Toyota Ireland for paying University College Dublin to conduct a study of only seven examples of their hybrid cars over seven days to make a press release about the efficiency of the vehicles. The website also criticised Toyota Ireland for using opinion polls to substantiate a claim about their emissions on Twitter.

===Safety-related misconduct by Daihatsu===
In April 2023, it was revealed that Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu had cheated by rigging some models to perform better in crash tests than actual production cars. The vehicles in question had a notch in the interior panel of the front door which avoided the possibility of the collision creating a sharp edge that could have injured an occupant when the side airbag deployed. This notch was present on the tested vehicles but not on vehicles sold to the public.

The issue affected four models, the Toyota Yaris Ativ (also known as the Vios), Perodua Axia, Toyota Agya, and an undisclosed upcoming product. No recall was conducted over the issue.

In December 2023, Daihatsu halted shipments of 64 models, including two dozens branded as Toyota, after safety investigations uncovered misconduct far greater in scope than previously expected. In some models, the test speeds and results of headrest impact tests were falsified. In models such as the TownAce and Pixis Joy, the airbag control unit used in testing was different from the part installed on vehicles sold to the public. Affected markets included Japan as well as Bolivia, Cambodia, Chile, Ecuador, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Thailand, Uruguay, and Vietnam.

On 29 January 2024, Koji Sato publicly apologized to customers, dealers and suppliers for the flawed testing.

==Corporate affairs==
Toyota is headquartered in the city of Toyota, which was named Koromo until 1951, when it changed its name to match the automaker. Toyota City is located in the Aichi Prefecture of Japan. The main headquarters of Toyota is located in a four-story building that has been described as &quot;modest&quot;. In 2013, company CEO Akio Toyoda reported that it had difficulties retaining foreign employees at the headquarters due to the lack of amenities in the city.

Surrounding the headquarters are the 14-story Toyota Technical Center and the Honsha plant (which was established in 1938). Toyota and its Toyota Group affiliates operate a total of 17 manufacturing facilities in Aichi Prefecture and a total of 32 plants in Japan.

Toyota also operates offices in Bunkyo, Tokyo, and Nakamura-ku, Nagoya.

=== Worldwide presence ===

Outside of Japan, as one of the world&#x27;s largest automotive manufacturer by production volume, Toyota has factories in most parts of the world. The company assembles vehicles in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela.

Additionally, the company also has joint venture, licensed, or contract factories in China, France, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Taiwan, the United States, and Vietnam.

==== North America ====

Toyota Motor North America is headquartered in Plano, Texas, and operates as a holding company for all operations of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Toyota&#x27;s operations in North America began on October 31, 1957, and the current company was established in 2017 from the consolidation of three companies: Toyota Motor North America, Inc., which controlled Toyota&#x27;s corporate functions; Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. which handled marketing, sales, and distribution in the United States; and Toyota Motor Engineering &amp; Manufacturing North America which oversaw operations at all assembly plants in the region. While all three companies continue to exist in legal name, they operate as one company out of one headquarters campus.

Toyota has a large presence in the United States with six major assembly plants in Huntsville, Alabama, Georgetown, Kentucky, Princeton, Indiana, San Antonio, Texas, Buffalo, West Virginia, and Blue Springs, Mississippi. In 2018, Toyota and Mazda announced a joint venture plant that will produce vehicles in Huntsville, Alabama, starting in 2021.

It has started producing larger trucks, such as the new Tundra, to go after the full-size pickup market in the United States. Toyota is also pushing hybrid electric vehicle in the US such as the Prius, Camry Hybrid, Highlander Hybrid, and various Lexus products. Toyota never introduced diesel motor options in its North American products, including pickup trucks.

Toyota Canada Inc., which is part of Toyota Motor North America, handles marketing, sales, and distribution in Canada. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada operates three assembly plants: two in Cambridge, Ontario and one in Woodstock, Ontario. In 2006, Toyota&#x27;s subsidiary Hino Motors opened a heavy duty truck plant, also in Woodstock, employing 45 people and producing 2,000 trucks annually.

====Europe/Western Asia====

Toyota Motor Europe is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, and oversees all operations of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Europe and western Asia. Toyota&#x27;s operations in Europe began in 1963. Toyota has a significant presence in Europe with nine production facilities in Kolín, Czech Republic, Burnaston, England, Deeside, England, Onnaing, France, Jelcz-Laskowice, Poland, Wałbrzych, Poland, Ovar, Portugal, Saint Petersburg, Russia, and Arifiye, Turkey. Toyota also operates a joint venture plant with Citroën and Peugeot in Valenciennes, France.

====Australia====
In 1963, Australia was one of the first countries to assemble Toyotas outside Japan. However, in February 2014, Toyota was the last of Australia&#x27;s major automakers to announce the end of production in Australia. The closure of Toyota&#x27;s Australian plant was completed on October 3, 2017, and had produced a total 3,451,155 vehicles. At its peak in October 2007, Toyota manufactured 15,000 cars a month. Before Toyota, Ford and GM&#x27;s Holden had announced similar moves, all citing an unfavorable currency and attendant high manufacturing costs.

==Company strategy==
===The Toyota Way===

The Toyota Way is a set of principles and behaviors that underlie the company&#x27;s approach to management and production (which is further defined as the Toyota Production System).

The company has been developing its corporate philosophy since 1948 and passing it on as implicit knowledge to new employees, but as the company expanded globally, leaders officially identified and defined the Toyota Way in 2001. Toyota summarized it under two main pillars: continuous improvement and respect for people. Under the continuous improvement pillar are three principles: challenge (form a long-term vision), kaizen (a continual improvement process), and genchi genbutsu (&quot;go and see&quot; the process to make correct decisions). Under the respect for people pillar are two principles: respect and teamwork.

In 2004, Dr. Jeffrey Liker, a University of Michigan professor of industrial engineering, published &quot;The Toyota Way&quot;. In his book, Liker calls the Toyota Way &quot;a system designed to provide the tools for people to continually improve their work.&quot; According to Liker, there are 14 principles of The Toyota Way that can be organized into four themes: (1) long-term philosophy, (2) the right process will produce the right results, (3) add value to the organization by developing your people, and (4) continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning. The 14 principles are further defined in the Wikipedia article on The Toyota Way.

===Toyota Production System===
The Toyota Way also helped shape the company&#x27;s approach to production, where it was an early pioneer of what would become known as lean manufacturing. The company defines the Toyota Production System under two main pillars: just-in-time (make only what is needed, only when it is needed, and only in the amount that is needed) and Jidoka (automation with a human touch).

The origin of the Toyota Production System is in dispute, with three stories of its origin: (1) that during a 1950 trip to train with the Ford Motor Company, company executives also studied the just-in-time distribution system of the grocery store company Piggly-Wiggly, (2) that they followed the writings of W. Edwards Deming, and (3) they learned the principles from a WWII US government training program (Training Within Industry).

After developing the Toyota Production System in its own facilities, the company began teaching the system to its parts suppliers in the 1990s. Other companies were interested in the instruction, and Toyota later started offering training sessions. The company also has donated the training to non-profit groups to increase their efficiency and thus ability to serve people.

===Logo and branding===
In 1936, Toyota entered the passenger car market with its Model AA and held a competition to establish a new logo emphasizing speed for its new product line. After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to &quot;Toyota&quot; from the family name &quot;Toyoda&quot;, which means rice paddy. The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune. The original logo was a heavily stylized version of the katakana characters for Toyota ().

As the company started to expand internationally in the late 1950s, the katakana character logo was supplemented by various wordmarks with the English form of the company name in all capital letters, &quot;TOYOTA.&quot;

Toyota introduced a worldwide logo in October 1989 to commemorate the 50th year of the company, and to differentiate it from the newly released luxury Lexus brand. The logo consists of three ovals that combine to form the letter &quot;T&quot;, which stands for Toyota. Toyota says that the overlapping of the two perpendicular ovals inside the larger oval represents the mutually beneficial relationship and trust between the customer and the company while the larger oval surrounding both of these inner ovals represents the &quot;global expansion of Toyota&#x27;s technology and unlimited potential for the future&quot;. The new logo started appearing on all printed material, advertisements, dealer signage, and most vehicles in 1990.

For the Japanese market, the Toyota logo tends to be relegated to the back of the vehicle only - the more prominent badging on the grille is typically model specific, with Corollas receiving a stylized &quot;C&quot; and the Crown a crown badge, for instance.

In countries or regions using traditional Chinese characters, e.g. Hong Kong and Taiwan, Toyota is known as &quot;豐田&quot;. In countries using simplified Chinese characters (e.g. China and Singapore), Toyota is written as &quot;丰田&quot; (pronounced as &quot;Fēngtián&quot; in Mandarin Chinese and &quot;Hɔng Tshan&quot; in Minnanese). These are the same characters as the founding family&#x27;s name &quot;Toyoda&quot; in Japanese.

Toyota still uses the katakana character logo as its corporate emblem in Japan, including on the headquarters building, and some special edition models still use the &quot;TOYOTA&quot; wordmark on the grille as a nod to the company&#x27;s heritage.

On July 15, 2015, the company was delegated its own generic top-level domain, .toyota.

===Sport sponsorships===

Toyota sponsors several teams and has purchased naming rights for several venues, and even competitions, including:
* Toyota Alvark Tokyo, basketball team
* Toyota Arena, Ontario, California
* Toyota Cup
* Toyota Center, Houston, Texas
* Toyota Center, Kennewick, Washington
* Toyota Field, San Antonio, Texas
* Toyota Park, Bridgeview, Illinois
* Toyota Sports Center, El Segundo, California
* Toyota Stadium, Georgetown, Kentucky
* Toyota Stadium, Frisco, Texas

, Toyota is an official sponsor of Cricket Australia, the England and Wales Cricket Board and the Australian Football League.

In March 2015, Toyota became a sponsor for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games in the form of supplying vehicles and communications between vehicles, starting in 2018. In May 2024, Toyota announced that it will not be extending the contract after the 2024 games in Paris, due the company reportedly being unhappy with how the IOC has used its sponsorship money. Toyota hopes to retain its contract with the International Paralympic Committee.

Toyota had previously sponsored football clubs Fortuna Köln (1998–2000), Valencia (2003–2008), Fiorentina (1999–2002 and 2004–2010), Perugia (2002–2004), Catania (2003–2004) and Valenciennes (2005–2012).

<text>A tabloid is a newspaper format characterized by its compact size, smaller than a broadsheet. The term originates from the 19th century, when the London-based pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome &amp; Co. used the term to describe compressed pills, later adopted by newspapers to denote condensed content. There are two main types of tabloid newspaper: red tops and compact, distinguished by editorial style.

Red top tabloids are distinct from broadsheet newspapers, which traditionally cater to more affluent, educated audiences with in-depth reporting and analysis. However, the line between tabloids and broadsheets has blurred in recent decades, as many broadsheet newspapers have adopted tabloid or compact formats to reduce costs and attract readers. 

Globally, the tabloid format has been adapted to suit regional preferences and media landscapes. In countries like Germany and Australia, tabloids such as &quot;Bild&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; have significant readerships and political clout.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;tabloid&quot; comes from the name given by the London-based pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome &amp; Co. to the compressed tablets they marketed as &quot;Tabloid&quot; pills in the late 1880s. The connotation of &quot;tabloid&quot; was soon applied to other small compressed items. A 1902 item in London&#x27;s &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot; noted, &quot;The proprietor intends to give in tabloid form all the news printed by other journals.&quot; Thus &quot;tabloid journalism&quot; in 1901, originally meant a paper that condensed stories into a simplified, easily absorbed format. The term preceded the 1918 reference to smaller sheet newspapers that contained the condensed stories.

==Types==
Tabloid newspapers, especially in the United Kingdom, vary widely in their target market, political alignment, editorial style, and circulation. Thus, various terms have been coined to describe the subtypes of this versatile paper format. There are, broadly, two main types of tabloid newspaper: &quot;red top&quot; and &quot;compact&quot;. The distinction is largely of editorial style; both red top and compact tabloids span the width of the political spectrum from socialism to capitalist conservatism, although red-top tabloids, on account of their historically working-class target market, generally embrace populism to some degree. Red top tabloids are so named due to their tendency, in British and Commonwealth usage, to have their mastheads printed in red ink; the term &quot;compact&quot; was coined to avoid the connotation of the word &quot;tabloid&quot;, which implies a red top tabloid, and has lent its name to tabloid journalism, which is journalism after the fashion of red top reporters.

===Red top tabloids===

Red top tabloids, named after their distinguishing red mastheads, employ a form of writing known as tabloid journalism; this style emphasizes features such as sensational crime stories, astrology, gossip columns about the personal lives of celebrities and sports stars, and junk food news. Celebrity gossip columns which appear in red top tabloids and focus on their sexual practices, misuse of narcotics, and the private aspects of their lives often border on, and sometimes cross the line of defamation.

Red tops tend to be written with a simplistic, straightforward vocabulary and grammar; their layout usually gives greater prominence to the picture than to the word. The writing style of red top tabloids is often accused of sensationalism and extreme political bias; red tops have been accused of deliberately igniting controversy and selectively reporting on attention-grabbing stories, or those with shock value. In the extreme case, tabloids have been accused of lying or misrepresenting the truth to increase circulation.

Examples of British red top newspapers include &quot;The Sun&quot;, the &quot;Daily Star&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. Although not using red mastheads, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Daily Express&quot; also use the &#x27;tabloid journalism&#x27; model.

===Compact tabloids===

In contrast to red-top tabloids, compacts use an editorial style more closely associated with broadsheet newspapers. In fact, most compact tabloids formerly used the broadsheet paper size, but changed to accommodate reading in tight spaces, such as on a crowded commuter bus or train. The term &quot;compact&quot; was coined in the 1970s by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, one of the earlier newspapers to make the change, although it now once again calls itself a tabloid. The purpose behind this was to avoid the association of the word &quot;tabloid&quot; with the flamboyant, salacious editorial style of the red top newspaper.

The early converts from broadsheet format made the change in the 1970s; two British papers that took this step at the time were the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. In 2003, &quot;The Independent&quot; also made the change for the same reasons, quickly followed by &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;The Morning Star&quot; had always used the tabloid size, but stands in contrast to both the red top papers and the former broadsheets; although &quot;The Morning Star&quot; emphasizes hard news, it embraces socialism and is circulated mostly among blue-collar labourers.

Compact tabloids, just like broadsheet- and Berliner-format newspapers, span the political spectrum from progressive to conservative and from capitalist to socialist.

==International use==
===Africa===
In Morocco, &quot;Maroc Soir&quot;, launched in November 2005, is published in tabloid format.

In South Africa, the Bloemfontein-based daily newspaper &quot;Volksblad&quot; became the first serious broadsheet newspaper to switch to tabloid, but only on Saturdays. Despite the format being popular with its readers, the newspaper remains broadsheet on weekdays. This is also true of Pietermaritzburg&#x27;s daily, &quot;The Witness&quot; in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The &quot;Daily Sun&quot;, published by Naspers, has since become South Africa&#x27;s biggest-selling daily newspaper and is aimed primarily at the black working class. It sells over 500,000 copies per day, reaching approximately 3,000,000 readers. Besides offering a sometimes satirical view of the seriousness of mainstream news, the &quot;Daily Sun&quot; also covers fringe theories and paranormal claims such as tikoloshes, ancestral visions and all things supernatural. It is also published as the &quot;Sunday Sun&quot;.

In Mauritius, the popular afternoon newspaper &quot;Le Mauricien&quot; shifted from tabloid (1908–2008) to the Berliner format (2008–2013) and now adopts a compact format with 32 pages during the week and 48 pages on Saturday.

===Asia===

In Bangladesh, the Daily became the first and is now the largest circulated Bengali language tabloid in the world.

In Georgia, the weekly English-language newspaper &quot;The Financial&quot; switched to a compact format in 2005 and doubled the number of pages in each issue. Other Georgian-language newspapers have tested compact formats in the early 1990s.

Tabloid journalism is still an evolving concept in India&#x27;s print media. The first tabloid, &quot;Blitz&quot; was started by Russi Karanjia on February 1, 1941 with the words &quot;Our Blitz, India&#x27;s Blitz against Hitler!&quot;. &quot;Blitz&quot; was first published in English and then branched out with Hindi, Marathi and Urdu versions. In 1974, Russi&#x27;s daughter Rita founded the &quot;Cine Blitz&quot; magazine. In 2005, &quot;Times of India&quot; brought out a dedicated Mumbai tabloid newspaper, &quot;Mumbai Mirror&quot;, which gives prominence to Mumbai-related stories and issues. &quot;Tehelka&quot; started as a news portal in 2000. It broke the story about match-fixing in Indian and International Cricket and the sting operation on defence deals in the Indian Army. In 2007, it closed shop and reappeared in tabloid form, and has been appreciated for its brand of investigative journalism. Other popular tabloid newspapers in English media are &quot;Mid-Day&quot;, an afternoon newspaper published out of and dedicated to Mumbai and business newspapers like &quot;MINT&quot;. There are numerous tabloids in most of India&#x27;s official languages. There is an all youth tabloid by the name of TILT – The ILIKE Times.

In Indonesia, tabloids include Bola, &quot;GO&quot; (Gema Olahraga, defunct), &quot;Soccer&quot; (defunct), &quot;Fantasy&quot; (defunct), &quot;Buletin Sinetron&quot; (defunct), &quot;Pro TV&quot; (defunct), &quot;Citra&quot; (defunct), &quot;Genie&quot;, &quot;Bintang Indonesia (Indonesian Stars)&quot;, &quot;Nyata&quot;, &quot;Wanita Indonesia&quot; (Women of Indonesia), &quot;Cek and Ricek&quot;, and &quot;Nova&quot;.

In Oman, &quot;TheWeek&quot; is a free, 48-page, all-colour, independent weekly published from Muscat in the Sultanate of Oman. Oman&#x27;s first free newspaper was launched in March 2003 and has now gone on to gather what is believed to be the largest readership for any publication in Oman. Ms Mohana Prabhakar is the managing editor of the publication. &quot;TheWeek&quot; is audited by BPA Worldwide, which has certified its circulation as being a weekly average of 50,300.

In Pakistan, &quot;Khabrain&quot; is a tabloid newspaper popular within the lower middle class. This news group introduced a new paper, &quot;Naya Akhbar&quot; which is comparably more sensational. At the local level, many sensational tabloids can be seen but, unlike &quot;Khabrain&quot; or other big national newspapers, they are distributed only on local levels in districts.

Tabloids in the Philippines are usually written in local languages, like Tagalog or Bisaya, one of the listed top Tagalog tabloids is &quot;Bulgar&quot;, but some are written in English, like the &quot;People&#x27;s Journal&quot; and &quot;Tempo&quot;. Like their common journalistic connotations, Philippine tabloids usually report sensationalist crime stories and celebrity gossip, and some tabloids feature topless photos of girls. Several tabloids are vernacular counterparts of English broadsheet newspapers by the same publisher, like &quot;Pilipino Star Ngayon&quot; (&quot;The Philippine Star&quot;), &quot;Bandera&quot; (&quot;Philippine Daily Inquirer&quot;), and &quot;Balita&quot; (&quot;Manila Bulletin&quot;). In the Southern Philippines, a new weekly tabloid, &quot;The Mindanao Examiner&quot;, now includes media services, such as photography and video production, into its line as a source to finance the high cost of printing and other expenses. It is also into independent film making.

===Europe===
The Berliner format, used by many prominent European newspapers, is sized between the tabloid and the broadsheet. In a newspaper context, the term &quot;Berliner&quot; is generally used only to describe size, not to refer to other qualities of the publication. The biggest tabloid (and newspaper in general) in Europe, by circulation, is Germany&#x27;s &quot;Bild&quot;, with around 2.5 million copies (down from above 5 million in the 1980s). Although its paper size is bigger, its style was copied from the British tabloids.

In Denmark, tabloids in the British sense are known as &#x27;formiddagsblade&#x27; (before-noon newspapers), the two biggest being &quot;BT&quot; and . The old more serious newspaper &quot;Berlingske Tidende&quot; shifted from broadsheet to tabloid format in 2006, while keeping the news profile intact.

In Finland, the biggest newspaper and biggest daily subscription newspaper in the Nordic countries changed its size from broadsheet to tabloid on 8 January 2013.

In France, the &quot;Nice Matin&quot; (or &quot;Le Dauphiné&quot;), a popular Southern France newspaper changed from Broadsheet to Tabloid on 8 April 2006. They changed the printing format in one day after test results showed that 74% liked the Tabloid format compared to Broadsheet. But the most famous tabloid dealing with crime stories is &quot;Le Nouveau Détective,&quot; created in the early 20th century. This weekly tabloid has a national circulation.

In the Netherlands, several newspapers have started publishing tabloid versions of their newspapers, including one of the major &#x27;quality&#x27; newspapers, NRC Handelsblad, with &quot;nrc•next&quot; (ceased 2021) in 2006. Two free tabloid newspapers were also introduced in the early 2000s, &#x27;Metro and Sp!ts (ceased 2014), mostly for distribution in public transportation. In 2007, a third and fourth free tabloid appeared, &#x27;De Pers&#x27; (ceased 2012) and &#x27;DAG&#x27; (ceased 2008). De Telegraaf, came in broadsheet but changed to tabloid in 2014.

In Norway, close to all newspapers have switched from the broadsheet to the tabloid format, which measures 280 x 400 mm. The three biggest newspapers are &quot;Dagbladet&quot;, &quot;VG&quot;, and &quot;Aftenposten&quot;.

In Poland, the newspaper &quot;Fakt&quot;, sometimes &quot;Super Express&quot; is considered as tabloid.

In the United Kingdom, three previously broadsheet daily newspapers—&quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;—have switched to tabloid size in recent years, and two—&quot;Daily Express&quot; and &quot;Daily Mail&quot;—in former years, although &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Scotsman&quot; call the format &quot;compact&quot; to avoid the down-market connotation of the word &quot;tabloid&quot;. Similarly, when referring to the down-market tabloid newspapers the alternative term &quot;red-top&quot; (referring to their traditionally red-coloured mastheads) is increasingly used, to distinguish them from the up- and middle-market compact newspapers. The Morning Star also comes in tabloid format; however, it avoids celebrity stories, and instead favours issues relating to labour unions.

===North America===
In Canada many newspapers of Postmedia&#x27;s &quot;Sun&quot; brand are in tabloid format including &quot;The Province&quot;, a newspaper for the British Columbia market. The Canadian publisher Black Press publishes newspapers in the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta in both tabloid ( wide by deep) and what it calls &quot;tall tab&quot; format, where the latter is wide by deep, larger than tabloid but smaller than the broadsheets it also publishes.

In the United States, daily tabloids date back to the founding of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; in 1919, followed by the &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot;, and the &quot;New York Evening Graphic&quot; in the 1920s. Competition among those three for crime, sex and celebrity news was considered a scandal to the mainstream press of the day. The tabloid format is used by a number of respected and indeed prize-winning American papers. Prominent U.S. tabloids include the &quot;New York Post&quot;, the &quot;Daily News&quot; and &quot;Newsday&quot; in New York, the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, &quot;The Bakersfield Californian&quot; and &quot;La Opinión&quot; in California, &quot;The Jersey Journal&quot; and &quot;The Trentonian&quot; in New Jersey, the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;, the &quot;Delaware County Daily Times&quot; and &quot;The Citizens&#x27; Voice&quot;, &quot;The Burlington Free Press&quot;, &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, and the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;. US tabloids that ceased publication include Denver&#x27;s &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;.

===Oceania===
In Australia, tabloids include &quot;The Advertiser&quot;, the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;, &quot;The Sun-Herald&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Courier Mail&quot;, &quot;The West Australian&quot;, &quot;The Mercury&quot;, &quot;the Hamilton Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Portland Observer&quot;, &quot;The Casterton News&quot; and &quot;The Melbourne Observer&quot;.

===South America===

In Argentina, one of the country&#x27;s two main newspapers, &quot;Clarín&quot;, is a tabloid.

In Brazil, many newspapers are tabloids, including sports daily &quot;Lance!&quot; (which circulates in cities such as Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo), most publications currently and formerly owned by Grupo RBS (especially the Porto Alegre daily &quot;Zero Hora&quot;), and, in March 2009, Rio de Janeiro-based &quot;O Dia&quot; switched to tabloid from broadsheet, though, several years later, it reverted to being a broadsheet. Its sister publication, &quot;Meia Hora&quot; has always been a tabloid, but in slightly smaller format than &quot;O Dia&quot; and &quot;Lance!&quot;.

==As a weekly alternative newspaper==

The more recent usage of the term &#x27;tabloid&#x27; refers to weekly or semi-weekly newspapers in tabloid format. Many of these are essentially straightforward newspapers, publishing in tabloid format, because subway and bus commuters prefer to read smaller-size newspapers due to lack of space.
These newspapers are distinguished from the major daily newspapers, in that they purport to offer an &quot;alternative&quot; viewpoint, either in the sense that the paper&#x27;s editors are more locally oriented, or that the paper is editorially independent from major media conglomerates.

Other factors that distinguish &quot;alternative&quot; weekly tabloids from the major daily newspapers are their less-frequent publication, and that they are usually free to the user, since they rely on ad revenue. Alternative weekly tabloids may concentrate on local and neighbourhood-level issues, and on entertainment in bars, theatres, or other such venues.

Alternative tabloids can be positioned as upmarket (quality) newspapers, to appeal to the better-educated, higher-income sector of the market; as middle-market (popular); or as downmarket (sensational) newspapers, which emphasize sensational crime stories and celebrity gossip. In each case, the newspapers will draw their advertising revenue from different types of businesses or services. An upmarket weekly&#x27;s advertisers are often organic grocers, boutiques, and theatre companies while a downmarket&#x27;s may have those of trade schools, supermarkets, and the sex industry. Both usually contain ads from local bars, auto dealers, movie theaters, and a classified ads section.

<doc id="30988" wikidata="Q483889" url="?curid=30988" title="Tibetan Buddhism">
<text>Tibetan Buddhism is a form of Buddhism practiced in Tibet, Bhutan and Mongolia. It also has a sizable number of adherents in the areas surrounding the Himalayas, including the Indian regions of Ladakh, Darjeeling, Sikkim, and Zangnan (Arunachal Pradesh), as well as in Nepal. Smaller groups of practitioners can be found in Central Asia, some regions of China such as Northeast China, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and some regions of Russia, such as Tuva, Buryatia, and Kalmykia.

Tibetan Buddhism evolved as a form of Mahāyāna Buddhism stemming from the latest stages of Indian Buddhism (which included many Vajrayāna elements). It thus preserves many Indian Buddhist tantric practices of the post-Gupta early medieval period (500–1200 CE), along with numerous native Tibetan developments. In the pre-modern era, Tibetan Buddhism spread outside of Tibet primarily due to the influence of the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), founded by Kublai Khan, who ruled China, Mongolia, and parts of Siberia. In the Modern era, Tibetan Buddhism has spread outside of Asia because of the efforts of the Tibetan diaspora (1959 onwards). As the Dalai Lama escaped to India, the Indian subcontinent is also known for its renaissance of Tibetan Buddhism monasteries, including the rebuilding of the three major monasteries of the Gelug tradition.

Apart from classical Mahāyāna Buddhist practices like the ten perfections, Tibetan Buddhism also includes tantric practices, such as deity yoga and the Six Dharmas of Naropa, as well as methods that are seen as transcending tantra, like Dzogchen. Its main goal is Buddhahood. The primary language of scriptural study in this tradition is classical Tibetan.

Tibetan Buddhism has four major schools, namely Nyingma (8th century), Kagyu (11th century), Sakya (1073), and Gelug (1409). The Jonang is a smaller school that exists, and the Rimé movement (19th century), meaning &quot;no sides&quot;, is a more recent non-sectarian movement that attempts to preserve and understand all the different traditions. The predominant spiritual tradition in Tibet before the introduction of Buddhism was Bon, which has been strongly influenced by Tibetan Buddhism (particularly the Nyingma school). While each of the four major schools is independent and has its own monastic institutions and leaders, they are closely related and intersect with common contact and dialogue. 
==Nomenclature==
The native Tibetan term for Buddhism is &quot;The Dharma of the insiders&quot; (&quot;nang chos&quot;) or &quot;The Buddha Dharma of the insiders&quot; (&quot;nang pa sangs rgyas pa&#x27;i chos&quot;). &quot;Insider&quot; means someone who seeks the truth not outside but within the nature of mind. This is contrasted with other forms of organized religion, which are termed &quot;chos lugs&quot; (dharma system)&quot;.&quot; For example, Christianity is termed &quot;Yi shu&#x27;i chos lugs&quot; (Jesus dharma system)&quot;.&quot;

Westerners unfamiliar with Tibetan Buddhism initially turned to China for understanding. In Chinese, the term used is &quot;Lamaism&quot; (literally, &quot;doctrine of the lamas&quot;: &quot;lama jiao&quot;) to distinguish it from a then-traditional Chinese Buddhism ( &quot;fo jiao&quot;). The term was taken up by western scholars, including Hegel, as early as 1822. Insofar as it implies a discontinuity between Indian and Tibetan Buddhism, the term has been discredited.

Another term, &quot;Vajrayāna&quot; (Tibetan: &quot;dorje tegpa&quot;) is occasionally misused for Tibetan Buddhism. More accurately, Vajrayāna signifies a certain subset of practices and traditions that are not only part of Tibetan Buddhism but also prominent in other Buddhist traditions such as Chinese Esoteric Buddhism and Shingon in Japan.

In the west, the term &quot;Indo-Tibetan Buddhism&quot; has become current in acknowledgement of its derivation from the latest stages of Buddhist development in northern India. &quot;Northern Buddhism&quot; is sometimes used to refer to Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, for example, in the Brill &quot;Dictionary of Religion.&quot;

Another term, &quot;Himalayan&quot; (or &quot;Trans-Himalayan&quot;) Buddhism is sometimes used to indicate how this form of Buddhism is practiced not just in Tibet but throughout the Himalayan Regions.

The Provisional Government of Russia, by a decree of 7 July 1917, prohibited the appellation of Buryat and Kalmyk Buddhists as &quot;Lamaists&quot; in official papers. After the October revolution the term &quot;Buddho-Lamaism&quot; was used for some time by the Bolsheviks with reference to Tibetan Buddhism, before they finally reverted, in the early 1920s, to a more familiar term &quot;Lamaism&quot;, which remains in official and scholarly usage in Russia to this day.

==History==
===Pre–6th century===
During the 3rd century CE, Buddhism began to spread into the Tibetan region, and its teachings affected the Bon religion in the Kingdom of Zhangzhung.

===First dissemination (7th–9th centuries)===
While some stories depict Buddhism in Tibet before this period, the religion was formally introduced during the Tibetan Empire (7th–9th century CE). Sanskrit Buddhist scriptures from India were first translated into Tibetan under the reign of the Tibetan king Songtsän Gampo (618–649 CE). This period also saw the development of the Tibetan writing system and classical Tibetan.

In the 8th century, King Trisong Detsen (755–797 CE) established it as the official religion of the state and commanded his army to wear robes and study Buddhism. Trisong Detsen invited Indian Buddhist scholars to his court, including Padmasambhāva (8th century CE) and Śāntarakṣita (725–788), who are considered the founders of Nyingma (&quot;The Ancient Ones)&quot;, the oldest tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. Padmasambhava, who is considered by the Tibetans as Guru Rinpoche (&quot;Precious Master&quot;), is also credited with building the first monastery building named &quot;Samye&quot; around the late 8th century. According to some legend, it is noted that he pacified the Bon demons and made them the core protectors of Dharma. Modern historians also argue that Trisong Detsen and his followers adopted Buddhism as an act of international diplomacy, especially with the major power of those times such as China, India, and states in Central Asia that had strong Buddhist influence in their culture.

Yeshe Tsogyal, the most important female in the Nyingma Vajrayana lineage, was a member of Trisong Detsen&#x27;s court and became Padmasambhava&#x27;s student before gaining enlightenment. Trisong Detsen also invited the Chan master Moheyan to transmit the Dharma at Samye Monastery. Some sources state that a debate ensued between Moheyan and the Indian master Kamalaśīla, without consensus on the victor, and some scholars consider the event to be fictitious.

===Era of fragmentation (9th–10th centuries)===
A reversal in Buddhist influence began under King Langdarma (r. 836–842), and his death was followed by the so-called &quot;Era of Fragmentation&quot;, a period of disunity during the 9th and 10th centuries. During this era, the political centralization of the earlier Tibetan Empire collapsed and civil wars ensued.

In spite of this loss of state power and patronage however, Buddhism survived and thrived in Tibet. According to Geoffrey Samuel this was because &quot;Tantric (Vajrayana) Buddhism came to provide the principal set of techniques by which Tibetans dealt with the dangerous powers of the spirit world [...] Buddhism, in the form of Vajrayana ritual, provided a critical set of techniques for dealing with everyday life. Tibetans came to see these techniques as vital for their survival and prosperity in this life.&quot; This includes dealing with the local gods and spirits (&quot;sadak&quot; and &quot;shipdak),&quot; which became a specialty of some Tibetan Buddhist lamas and ngagpas (&quot;mantrikas&quot;, mantra specialists).

===Second dissemination (10th–12th centuries)===

The late 10th and 11th centuries saw a revival of Buddhism in Tibet with the founding of &quot;New Translation&quot; (&quot;Sarma&quot;) lineages as well as the appearance of &quot;hidden treasures&quot; (&quot;terma&quot;) literature which reshaped the Nyingma tradition.
In 1042 the Bengali saint, Atiśa (982–1054) arrived in Tibet at the invitation of a west Tibetan king and further aided dissemination of Buddhist values in Tibetan culture and in consequential affairs of state.

His erudition supported the translation of major Buddhist texts, which evolved into the canons of Bka&#x27;-&#x27;gyur (Translation of the Buddha Word) and Bstan-&#x27;gyur (Translation of Teachings). The &quot;Bka&#x27;-&#x27;gyur&quot; has six main categories: (1) Tantra, (2) Prajñāpāramitā, (3) Ratnakūṭa Sūtra, (4) Avataṃsaka Sūtra, (5) Other sutras, and (6) Vinaya. The &quot;Bstan-&#x27;gyur&quot; comprises 3,626 texts and 224 volumes on such things as hymns, commentaries and suppplementary tantric material.

Atiśa&#x27;s chief disciple, Dromtön founded the Kadampa school of Tibetan Buddhism, one of the first Sarma schools. The Sakya (&quot;Grey Earth&quot;) school, was founded by Khön Könchok Gyelpo (1034–1102), a disciple of the great scholar, Drogmi Shākya. It is headed by the Sakya Trizin, and traces its lineage to the mahasiddha Virūpa.

Other influential Indian teachers include Tilopa (988–1069) and his student Nāropā (probably died ca. 1040). Their teachings, via their student Marpa, are the foundations of the Kagyu (&quot;Oral lineage&quot;) tradition&quot;,&quot; which focuses on the practices of Mahāmudrā and the Six Dharmas of Nāropā. One of the most famous Kagyu figures was the hermit Milarepa, an 11th-century mystic. The Dagpo Kagyu was founded by the monk Gampopa who merged Marpa&#x27;s lineage teachings with the monastic Kadam tradition.

All the sub-schools of the Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism surviving today, including the Drikung Kagyu, the Drukpa Kagyu and the Karma Kagyu, are branches of the Dagpo Kagyu. The Karma Kagyu school is the largest of the Kagyu sub-schools and is headed by the Karmapa.

===Mongol dominance (13th–14th centuries)===
Tibetan Buddhism exerted a strong influence from the 11th century CE among the peoples of Inner Asia, especially the Mongols, and Tibetan and Mongolian Buddhism influenced each other. This was done with the help of Kublai Khan and Mongolian theologians influenced by the Church of the East.

The Mongols invaded Tibet in 1240 and 1244. They eventually annexed Amdo and Kham and appointed the great scholar and abbot Sakya Pandita (1182–1251) as Viceroy of Central Tibet in 1249.

In this way, Tibet was incorporated into the Mongol Empire, with the Sakya hierarchy retaining nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols retained structural and administrative rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention. Tibetan Buddhism was adopted as the &quot;de facto&quot; state religion by the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) of Kublai Khan.

It was also during this period that the Tibetan Buddhist canon was compiled, primarily led by the efforts of the scholar Butön Rinchen Drup (1290–1364). A part of this project included the carving of the canon into wood blocks for printing, and the first copies of these texts were kept at Narthang monastery.

Tibetan Buddhism in China was also syncretized with Chinese Buddhism and Chinese folk religion.

===From family rule to Ganden Phodrang government (14th–18th centuries)===

With the decline and end of the Mongol Yuan dynasty, Tibet regained independence and was ruled by successive local families from the 14th to the 17th century.

Jangchub Gyaltsän (1302–1364) became the strongest political family in the mid 14th century. During this period the reformist scholar Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419) founded the Gelug school which would have a decisive influence on Tibet&#x27;s history. The Ganden Tripa is the nominal head of the Gelug school, though its most influential figure is the Dalai Lama. The Ganden Tripa is an appointed office and not a reincarnation lineage. The position can be held by an individual for seven years and this has led to more Ganden Tripas than Dalai Lamas.

Internal strife within the Phagmodrupa dynasty, and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions, led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family Rinpungpa, based in Tsang (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435.

In 1565, the Rinpungpa family was overthrown by the Tsangpa Dynasty of Shigatse, which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the Karma Kagyu sect. They would play a pivotal role in the events which led to the rise of power of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s in the 1640s.
In China, Tibetan Buddhism continued to be patronized by the elites of the Ming Dynasty. According to David M. Robinson, during this era, Tibetan Buddhist monks &quot;conducted court rituals, enjoyed privileged status and gained access to the jealously guarded, private world of the emperors&quot;. The Ming Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424) promoted the carving of printing blocks for the Kangyur, now known as &quot;the Yongle Kanjur&quot;, and seen as an important edition of the collection.

The Ming Dynasty also supported the propagation of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia during this period. Tibetan Buddhist missionaries also helped spread the religion in Mongolia. It was during this era that Altan Khan the leader of the Tümed Mongols, converted to Buddhism, and allied with the Gelug school, conferring the title of Dalai Lama to Sonam Gyatso in 1578.

During a Tibetan civil war in the 17th century, Sonam Choephel (1595–1657 CE), the chief regent of the 5th Dalai Lama, conquered and unified Tibet to establish the &quot;Ganden Phodrang&quot; government with the help of the Güshi Khan of the Khoshut Mongols. The &quot;Ganden Phodrang&quot; and the successive Gelug tulku lineages of the Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas maintained regional control of Tibet from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries.

===Qing rule (18th–20th centuries)===

The Qing dynasty (1644–1912) established a Chinese rule over Tibet after a Qing expeditionary force defeated the Dzungars (who controlled Tibet) in 1720, and lasted until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912. The Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty supported Tibetan Buddhism, especially the Gelug sect, during most of their rule. The reign of the Qianlong Emperor (respected as the Emperor Manjushri) was the high mark for this promotion of Tibetan Buddhism in China, with the visit of the 6th Panchen Lama to Beijing, and the building of temples in the Tibetan style, such as Xumi Fushou Temple, the Puning Temple and Putuo Zongcheng Temple (modeled after the potala palace).

This period also saw the rise of the Rimé movement, a 19th-century nonsectarian movement involving the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma schools of Tibetan Buddhism, along with some Bon scholars. Having seen how the Gelug institutions pushed the other traditions into the corners of Tibet&#x27;s cultural life, scholars such as Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820–1892) and Jamgön Kongtrül (1813–1899) compiled together the teachings of the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma, including many near-extinct teachings. Without Khyentse and Kongtrul&#x27;s collecting and printing of rare works, the suppression of Buddhism by the Communists would have been much more final. The Rimé movement is responsible for a number of scriptural compilations, such as the &quot;Rinchen Terdzod&quot; and the &quot;Sheja Dzö&quot;.

During the Qing, Tibetan Buddhism also remained the major religion of the Mongols under Qing rule (1635–1912), as well as the state religion of the Kalmyk Khanate (1630–1771), the Dzungar Khanate (1634–1758) and the Khoshut Khanate (1642–1717).

===20th century===

In 1912, following the fall of the Qing Dynasty, Tibet became de facto independent under the 13th Dalai Lama government based in Lhasa, maintaining the current territory of what is now called the Tibetan Autonomous Region.

During the Republic of China (1912–1949), the &quot;Chinese Tantric Buddhist Revival Movement&quot; () took place, and important figures such as Nenghai (, 1886–1967) and Master Fazun (, 1902–1980) promoted Tibetan Buddhism and translated Tibetan works into Chinese. This movement was severely damaged during the Cultural Revolution, however.

After the Battle of Chamdo, Tibet was annexed by China in 1950. In 1959 the 14th Dalai Lama and a great number of clergy and citizenry fled the country, to settle in India and other neighbouring countries. The events of the Cultural Revolution (1966–76) saw religion as one of the main political targets of the Chinese Communist Party, and most of the several thousand temples and monasteries in Tibet were destroyed, with many monks and lamas imprisoned. During this time, private religious expression, as well as Tibetan cultural traditions, were suppressed. Much of the Tibetan textual heritage and institutions were destroyed, and monks and nuns were forced to disrobe.

Outside of Tibet, however, there has been a renewed interest in Tibetan Buddhism in places such as Nepal and Bhutan.

Meanwhile, the spread of Tibetan Buddhism in the Western world was accomplished by many of the refugee Tibetan Lamas who escaped Tibet, such as Akong Rinpoche and Chögyam Trungpa who in 1967 were founders of Kagyu Samye Ling the first Tibetan Buddhist Centre to be established in the West.

After the liberalization policies in China during the 1980s, the religion began to recover with some temples and monasteries being reconstructed. Tibetan Buddhism is now an influential religion in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and overseas Chinese communities. However, the Chinese government retains strict control over Tibetan Buddhist Institutions in the PRC. Quotas on the number of monks and nuns are maintained, and their activities are closely supervised.

Within the Tibetan Autonomous Region, violence against Buddhists has been escalating since 2008. Widespread reports document the arrests and disappearances of nuns and monks, while the Chinese government classifies religious practices as &quot;gang crime&quot;. Reports include the demolition of monasteries, forced disrobing, forced reeducation, and detentions of nuns and monks, especially those residing at Yarchen Gar&#x27;s center, the most highly publicized.

===21st century===
Today, Tibetan Buddhism is adhered to widely in the Tibetan Plateau, Mongolia, northern Nepal, Kalmykia (on the north-west shore of the Caspian), Siberia (Tuva and Buryatia), the Russian Far East and northeast China. It is the state religion of Bhutan. The Indian regions of Sikkim and Ladakh, both formerly independent kingdoms, are also home to significant Tibetan Buddhist populations, as are the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh (which includes Dharamshala and the district of Lahaul-Spiti), West Bengal (the hill stations of Darjeeling and Kalimpong) and Arunachal Pradesh. Religious communities, refugee centers and monasteries have also been established in South India.

The 14th Dalai Lama is the leader of the Tibetan government in exile which was initially dominated by the Gelug school, however, according to Geoffrey Samuel:The Dharamsala administration under the Dalai Lama has nevertheless managed, over time, to create a relatively inclusive and democratic structure that has received broad support across the Tibetan communities in exile. Senior figures from the three non-Gelukpa Buddhist schools and from the Bonpo have been included in the religious administration, and relations between the different lamas and schools are now on the whole very positive. This is a considerable achievement, since the relations between these groups were often competitive and conflict-ridden in Tibet before 1959, and mutual distrust was initially widespread. The Dalai Lama&#x27;s government at Dharamsala has also continued under difficult circumstances to argue for a negotiated settlement rather than armed struggle with China.

In the wake of the Tibetan diaspora, Tibetan Buddhism has also gained adherents in the West and throughout the world. Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and centers were first established in Europe and North America in the 1960s, and most are now supported by non-Tibetan followers of Tibetan lamas. Some of these westerners went on to learn Tibetan, undertake extensive training in the traditional practices and have been recognized as lamas. Fully ordained Tibetan Buddhist Monks have also entered Western societies in other ways, such as working academia.

Samuel sees the character of Tibetan Buddhism in the West as

==Teachings==

Tibetan Buddhism upholds classic Buddhist teachings such as the four noble truths (Tib. &quot;pakpé denpa shyi&quot;), anatman (not-self, &quot;bdag med&quot;), the five aggregates (&quot;phung po&quot;) karma and rebirth, and dependent arising (&quot;rten cing ’brel bar ’byung ba&quot;). They also uphold various other Buddhist doctrines associated with Mahāyāna Buddhism (&quot;theg pa chen po&quot;) as well as the tantric Vajrayāna tradition.

===Buddhahood and Bodhisattvas===

The Mahāyāna goal of spiritual development is to achieve the enlightenment of Buddhahood in order to help all other sentient beings attain this state. This motivation is called &quot;bodhicitta&quot; (mind of awakening)—an altruistic intention to become enlightened for the sake of all sentient beings. &quot;Bodhisattvas&quot; (Tib. &quot;jangchup semba,&quot; literally &quot;awakening hero&quot;) are revered beings who have conceived the will and vow to dedicate their lives with &quot;bodhicitta&quot; for the sake of all beings.

Widely revered Bodhisattvas in Tibetan Buddhism include Avalokiteshvara, Manjushri, Vajrapani, and Tara. The most important Buddhas are the five Buddhas of the Vajradhatu mandala as well as the Adi Buddha (first Buddha), called either Vajradhara or Samantabhadra.

Buddhahood is defined as a state free of the obstructions to liberation as well as those to omniscience (&quot;sarvajñana&quot;). When one is freed from all mental obscurations, one is said to attain a state of continuous bliss mixed with a simultaneous cognition of emptiness, the true nature of reality. In this state, all limitations on one&#x27;s ability to help other living beings are removed. Tibetan Buddhism teaches methods for achieving Buddhahood more quickly (known as the Vajrayāna path).

It is said that there are countless beings who have attained Buddhahood. Buddhas spontaneously, naturally and continuously perform activities to benefit all sentient beings. However it is believed that one&#x27;s &quot;karma&quot; could limit the ability of the Buddhas to help them. Thus, although Buddhas possess no limitation from their side on their ability to help others, sentient beings continue to experience suffering as a result of the limitations of their own former negative actions.

An important schema which is used in understanding the nature of Buddhahood in Tibetan Buddhism is the &quot;Trikaya&quot; (Three bodies) doctrine.

=== The Bodhisattva path ===
A central schema for spiritual advancement used in Tibetan Buddhism is that of the five paths (Skt. &quot;pañcamārga&quot;; Tib. &quot;lam nga&quot;) which are:

# The path of accumulation – in which one collects wisdom and merit, generates bodhicitta, cultivates the four foundations of mindfulness and right effort (the &quot;four abandonments&quot;).
# The path of preparation – Is attained when one reaches the union of calm abiding and higher insight meditations (see below) and one becomes familiar with emptiness. 
# The path of seeing – one perceives emptiness directly, all thoughts of subject and object are overcome, one becomes an &quot;arya&quot;.
# The path of meditation – one removes subtler traces from one&#x27;s mind and perfects one&#x27;s understanding. 
# The path of no more learning – which culminates in Buddhahood.

The schema of the five paths is often elaborated and merged with the concept of the &quot;bhumis&quot; or the bodhisattva levels.

===Lamrim===

&quot;Lamrim&quot; (&quot;stages of the path&quot;) is a Tibetan Buddhist schema for presenting the stages of spiritual practice leading to liberation. In Tibetan Buddhist history there have been many different versions of &quot;lamrim&quot;, presented by different teachers of the Nyingma, Kagyu and Gelug schools (the Sakya school uses a different system named &quot;Lamdre&quot;). However, all versions of the &quot;lamrim&quot; are elaborations of Atiśa&#x27;s 11th-century root text &quot;A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment&quot; (&quot;Bodhipathapradīpa&quot;).

Atisha&#x27;s &quot;lamrim&quot; system generally divides practitioners into those of &quot;lesser&quot;, &quot;middling&quot; and &quot;superior&quot; scopes or attitudes:
*The lesser person is to focus on the preciousness of human birth as well as contemplation of death and impermanence.
*The middling person is taught to contemplate karma, dukkha (suffering) and the benefits of liberation and refuge. 
*The superior scope is said to encompass the four Brahmaviharas, the bodhisattva vow, the six paramitas as well as Tantric practices.

Although &quot;lamrim&quot; texts cover much the same subject areas, subjects within them may be arranged in different ways and with different emphasis depending on the school and tradition it belongs to. Gampopa and Tsongkhapa expanded the short root-text of Atiśa into an extensive system to understand the entire Buddhist philosophy. In this way, subjects like karma, rebirth, Buddhist cosmology and the practice of meditation are gradually explained in logical order.

===Vajrayāna===

Tibetan Buddhism incorporates Vajrayāna (&quot;Vajra vehicle&quot;), &quot;Secret Mantra&quot; (Skt. &quot;Guhyamantra&quot;) or Buddhist Tantra, which is espoused in the texts known as the Buddhist Tantras (dating from around the 7th century CE onwards).

Tantra (Tib. &quot;rgyud&quot;, &quot;continuum&quot;) generally refers to forms of religious practice which emphasize the use of unique ideas, visualizations, mantras, and other practices for inner transformation. The Vajrayana is seen by most Tibetan adherents as the fastest and most powerful vehicle for enlightenment because it contains many skillful means (&quot;upaya&quot;) and because it takes the effect (Buddhahood itself, or Buddha nature) as the path (and hence is sometimes known as the &quot;effect vehicle&quot;, &quot;phalayana&quot;).

An important element of Tantric practice are tantric deities and their mandalas. These deities come in peaceful (&quot;shiwa&quot;) and fierce (&quot;trowo&quot;) forms.

Tantric texts also generally affirm the use of sense pleasures and other defilements in Tantric ritual as a path to enlightenment, as opposed to non-Tantric Buddhism which affirms that one must renounce all sense pleasures. These practices are based on the theory of transformation which states that negative or sensual mental factors and physical actions can be cultivated and transformed in a ritual setting. As the &quot;Hevajra Tantra&quot; states:

Those things by which evil men are bound, others turn into means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, by passion too it is released, but by heretical Buddhists this practice of reversals is not known.

Another element of the Tantras is their use of transgressive practices, such as drinking taboo substances such as alcohol or sexual yoga. While in many cases these transgressions were interpreted only symbolically, in other cases they are practiced literally.

===Philosophy===

The Indian Buddhist Madhyamaka (&quot;Middle Way&quot; or &quot;Centrism&quot;) philosophy, also called &quot;Śūnyavāda&quot; (the emptiness doctrine) is the dominant Buddhist philosophy in Tibetan Buddhism. In Madhyamaka, the true nature of reality is referred to as &quot;Śūnyatā&quot;, which is the fact that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence or essence (&quot;svabhava&quot;). Madhyamaka is generally seen as the highest philosophical view by most Tibetan philosophers, but it is interpreted in numerous different ways.

The other main Mahayana philosophical school, Yogācāra has also been very influential in Tibetan Buddhism, but there is more disagreement among the various schools and philosophers regarding its status. While the Gelug school generally sees Yogācāra views as either false or provisional (i.e. only pertaining to conventional truth), philosophers in the other three main schools, such as Ju Mipham and Sakya Chokden, hold that Yogācāra ideas are as important as Madhyamaka views.
In Tibetan Buddhist scholasticism, Buddhist philosophy is traditionally propounded according to a hierarchical classification of four classical Indian philosophical schools, known as the &quot;four tenets&quot; (Tib. &quot;drubta shyi&quot;, Sanskrit: siddhānta). While the classical tenets-system is limited to four tenets (Vaibhāṣika, Sautrāntika, Yogācāra, and Madhyamaka), there are further sub-classifications within these different tenets (see below). This classification does not include Theravada, the only surviving of the 18 classical schools of Buddhism. It also does not include other Indian Buddhist schools, such as Mahasamghika and Pudgalavada.

Two tenets belong to the path referred to as the Hinayana (&quot;lesser vehicle&quot;) or Sravakayana (&quot;the disciples&#x27; vehicle&quot;), and are both related to the north Indian Sarvastivada tradition:
* Vaibhāṣika (). The primary source for the Vaibhāṣika in Tibetan Buddhism is the &quot;Abhidharma-kośa&quot; of Vasubandhu and its commentaries. This Abhidharma system affirms an atomistic view of reality which states ultimate reality is made up of a series of impermanent phenomena called &quot;dharmas&quot;. It also defends eternalism regarding the philosophy of time, as well the view that perception directly experiences external objects.
* Sautrāntika (). The main sources for this view is the &quot;Abhidharmakośa&quot;, as well as the work of Dignāga and Dharmakīrti. As opposed to Vaibhāṣika, this view holds that only the present moment exists (presentism), as well as the view that we do not directly perceive the external world only the mental images caused by objects and our sense faculties.

The other two tenets are the two major Indian Mahayana philosophies:
* Yogācāra, also called &quot;Vijñānavāda&quot; (the doctrine of consciousness) and &quot;Cittamātra&quot; (&quot;Mind-Only&quot;, ). Yogacārins base their views on texts from Maitreya, Asaṅga and Vasubandhu. Yogacara is often interpreted as a form of Idealism due to its main doctrine, the view that only ideas or mental images exist (&quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot;). Some Tibetan philosophers interpret Yogācāra as the view that the mind (&quot;citta&quot;) exists in an ultimate sense, because of this, it is often seen as inferior to Madhyamaka. However, other Tibetan thinkers deny that the Indian Yogacāra masters held the view of the ultimate existence of the mind, and thus, they place Yogācāra on a level comparable to Madhyamaka. This perspective is common in the Nyingma school, as well as in the work of the Third Karmapa, the Seventh Karmapa and Jamgon Kongtrul.
* Madhyamaka () – The philosophy of Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva, which affirms that everything is empty of essence (&quot;svabhava&quot;) and is ultimately beyond concepts. There are various further classifications, sub-schools and interpretations of Madhymaka in Tibetan Buddhism and numerous debates about various key disagreements remain a part of Tibetan Buddhist scholasticism today. One of the key debates is that between the rangtong (self-empty) interpretation and the shentong (other empty) interpretation. Another major disagreement is the debate on the Svātantrika Madhyamaka method and the Prasaṅgika method. There are further disagreements regarding just how useful an intellectual understanding of emptiness can be and whether emptiness should only be described as an absolute negation (the view of Tsongkhapa).

The tenet systems are used in monasteries and colleges to teach Buddhist philosophy in a systematic and progressive fashion, each philosophical view being seen as more subtle than its predecessor. Therefore, the four tenets can be seen as a gradual path from a rather easy-to-grasp, &quot;realistic&quot; philosophical point of view, to more and more complex and subtle views on the ultimate nature of reality, culminating in the philosophy of the Mādhyamikas, which is widely believed to present the most sophisticated point of view. Non-Tibetan scholars point out that historically, Madhyamaka predates Yogacara, however.

==Texts and study==

Study of major Buddhist Indian texts is central to the monastic curriculum in all four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Memorization of classic texts as well as other ritual texts is expected as part of traditional monastic education. Another important part of higher religious education is the practice of formalized debate.

The canon was mostly finalized in the 13th century, and divided into two parts, the Kangyur (containing sutras and tantras) and the Tengyur (containing &quot;shastras&quot; and commentaries). The Nyingma school also maintains a separate collection of texts called the Nyingma Gyubum, assembled by Ratna Lingpa in the 15th century and revised by Jigme Lingpa.

Among Tibetans, the main language of study is classical Tibetan, however, the Tibetan Buddhist canon was also translated into other languages, such as Mongolian and Manchu.

During the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, many texts from the Tibetan canon were also translated into Chinese.

Numerous texts have also recently been translated into Western languages by Western academics and Buddhist practitioners.

=== Sutras ===
Among the most widely studied sutras in Tibetan Buddhism are Mahāyāna sutras such as the &quot;Perfection of Wisdom&quot; or &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot; sutras, and others such as the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra,&quot; and the &quot;Samādhirāja Sūtra.&quot;

According to Tsongkhapa, the two authoritative systems of Mahayana Philosophy (viz. that of Asaṅga – Yogacara and that of Nāgārjuna – Madhyamaka) are based on specific Mahāyāna sūtras: the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Questions of Akṣayamati&quot; (&quot;Akṣayamatinirdeśa Sūtra&quot;) respectively. Furthermore, according to Thupten Jinpa, for Tsongkhapa, &quot;at the heart of these two hermeneutical systems lies their interpretations of the Perfection of Wisdom sūtras, the archetypal example being the &quot;Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines&quot;.&quot;

===Treatises of the Indian masters===
The study of Indian Buddhist treatises called &quot;shastras&quot; is central to Tibetan Buddhist scholasticism. Some of the most important works are those by the six great Indian Mahayana authors which are known as the Six Ornaments and Two Supreme Ones (Tib. &quot;gyen druk chok nyi&quot;, Wyl. &quot;rgyan drug mchog gnyis&quot;), the six being: Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Asanga, Vasubandhu, Dignaga, and Dharmakirti and the two being: Gunaprabha and Shakyaprabha (or Nagarjuna and Asanga depending on the tradition).

Since the late 11th century, traditional Tibetan monastic colleges generally organized the exoteric study of Buddhism into &quot;five great textual traditions&quot; (&quot;zhungchen-nga&quot;). 
# Abhidharma
#* Asanga&#x27;s &quot;Abhidharma-samuccaya&quot;
#* Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Abhidharma-kośa&quot;
# Prajnaparamita
#* &quot;Abhisamayalankara&quot;
#* Shantideva&#x27;s &quot;Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra&quot;
# Madhyamaka
#* Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;
#* Aryadeva&#x27;s &quot;Four Hundred Verses&quot; (&quot;Catuhsataka&quot;)
#* Candrakīrti&#x27;s &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra&quot;
#* Śāntarakṣita&#x27;s &quot;Madhyamākalaṃkāra&quot;
#* Shantideva&#x27;s &quot;Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra&quot;
# Pramana
#* Dharmakirti&#x27;s &quot;Pramāṇavarttika&quot;
#* Dignāga&#x27;s &quot;Pramāṇa-samuccaya&quot;
# Vinaya
#*Gunaprabha&#x27;s &quot;Vinayamula Sutra&quot;

===Other important texts===
Also of great importance are the &quot;Five Treatises of Maitreya&quot; including the influential &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;, a compendium of the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; literature, and the &quot;Mahayanasutralankara&quot;, a text on the Mahayana path from the Yogacara perspective, which are often attributed to Asanga. Practiced focused texts such as the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi-Śāstra&quot; and Kamalaśīla&#x27;s &quot;Bhāvanākrama&quot; are the major sources for meditation.

While the Indian texts are often central, original material by key Tibetan scholars is also widely studied and collected into editions called &quot;sungbum&quot;. The commentaries and interpretations that are used to shed light on these texts differ according to tradition. The Gelug school for example, use the works of Tsongkhapa, while other schools may use the more recent work of Rimé movement scholars like Jamgon Kongtrul and Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso.

A corpus of extra-canonical scripture, the treasure texts (&quot;terma&quot;) literature is acknowledged by Nyingma practitioners, but the bulk of the canon that is not commentary was translated from Indian sources. True to its roots in the &quot;Pāla&quot; system of North India, however, Tibetan Buddhism carries on a tradition of eclectic accumulation and systematisation of diverse Buddhist elements, and pursues their synthesis. Prominent among these achievements have been the Stages of the Path and mind training literature, both stemming from teachings by the Indian scholar Atiśa.

===Tantric literature===

In Tibetan Buddhism, the Buddhist Tantras are divided into four or six categories, with several sub-categories for the highest Tantras.

In the Nyingma, the division is into &quot;Outer Tantras&quot; (Kriyayoga, Charyayoga, Yogatantra); and &quot;Inner Tantras&quot; (Mahayoga, Anuyoga, Atiyoga/Dzogchen), which correspond to the &quot;Anuttarayoga-tantra&quot;. For the Nyingma school, important tantras include the &quot;Guhyagarbha Tantra&quot;, the &quot;Guhyasamaja Tantra,&quot; the &quot;Kulayarāja Tantra&quot; and the 17 Dzogchen Tantras.

In the Sarma schools, the division is:

* Kriya-yoga – These have an emphasis on purification and ritual acts and include texts like the &quot;Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa&quot;.
* Charya-yoga – Contain &quot;a balance between external activities and internal practices&quot;, mainly referring to the &quot;Mahāvairocana Abhisaṃbodhi Tantra.&quot;
* Yoga-tantra, is mainly concerned with internal yogic techniques and includes the &quot;Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra.&quot;
* Anuttarayoga-tantra, contains more advanced techniques such as subtle body practices and is subdivided into: 
**Father tantras, which emphasize illusory body and completion stage practices and includes the &quot;Guhyasamaja Tantra&quot; and &quot;Yamantaka Tantra&quot;.
**Mother tantras, which emphasize the development stage and clear light mind and includes the &quot;Hevajra Tantra&quot; and &quot;Cakrasamvara Tantra.&quot;
**Non-dual tantras, which balance the above elements, and mainly refers to the &quot;Kalacakra Tantra&quot;

The root tantras themselves are almost unintelligible without the various Indian and Tibetan commentaries, therefore, they are never studied without the use of the tantric commentarial apparatus.

===Transmission and realization===
There is a long history of oral transmission of teachings in Tibetan Buddhism. Oral transmissions by lineage holders traditionally can take place in small groups or mass gatherings of listeners and may last for seconds (in the case of a mantra, for example) or months (as in the case of a section of the Tibetan Buddhist canon). It is held that a transmission can even occur without actually hearing, as in Asanga&#x27;s visions of Maitreya.

An emphasis on oral transmission as more important than the printed word derives from the earliest period of Indian Buddhism, when it allowed teachings to be kept from those who should not hear them. Hearing a teaching (transmission) readies the hearer for realization based on it. The person from whom one hears the teaching should have heard it as one link in a succession of listeners going back to the original speaker: the Buddha in the case of a &quot;sutra&quot; or the author in the case of a book. Then the hearing constitutes an authentic lineage of transmission. Authenticity of the oral lineage is a prerequisite for realization, hence the importance of lineages.

== Practices ==
In Tibetan Buddhism, practices are generally classified as either Sutra (or &quot;Pāramitāyāna&quot;) or Tantra (&quot;Vajrayāna or Mantrayāna&quot;), though exactly what constitutes each category and what is included and excluded in each is a matter of debate and differs among the various lineages. According to Tsongkhapa for example, what separates Tantra from Sutra is the practice of Deity yoga. Furthermore, the adherents of the Nyingma school consider Dzogchen to be a separate and independent vehicle, which transcends both sutra and tantra.

While it is generally held that the practices of Vajrayāna are not included in Sutrayāna, all Sutrayāna practices are common to Vajrayāna practice. Traditionally, Vajrayāna is held to be a more powerful and effective path, but potentially more difficult and dangerous and thus they should only be undertaken by the advanced who have established a solid basis in other practices.

=== Pāramitā ===

The &quot;pāramitās&quot; (perfections, transcendent virtues) is a key set of virtues which constitute the major practices of a bodhisattva in non-tantric Mahayana. They are:

# &quot;Dāna pāramitā&quot;: generosity, giving (Tibetan: སབྱིན་པ &quot;sbyin-pa&quot;)
# &quot;Śīla pāramitā:&quot; virtue, morality, discipline, proper conduct (ཚུལ་ཁྲིམས &quot;tshul-khrims&quot;)
# &quot; pāramitā&quot;: patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance (བཟོད་པ &quot;bzod-pa&quot;)
# &quot;Vīrya pāramitā&quot;: energy, diligence, vigor, effort (བརྩོན་འགྲུས &quot;brtson-’grus&quot;)
# &quot;Dhyāna pāramitā&quot;: one-pointed concentration, meditation, contemplation (བསམ་གཏན &quot;bsam-gtan&quot;)
# &quot;Prajñā pāramitā&quot;: wisdom, knowledge (ཤེས་རབ &quot;shes-rab&quot;)

The practice of &quot;dāna&quot; (giving) while traditionally referring to offerings of food to the monastics can also refer to the ritual offering of bowls of water, incense, butter lamps and flowers to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas on a shrine or household altar. Similar offerings are also given to other beings such as hungry ghosts, dakinis, protector deities, and local divinities.

Like other forms of Mahayana Buddhism, the practice of the five precepts and bodhisattva vows is part of Tibetan Buddhist moral (&quot;sila&quot;) practice. In addition to these, there are also numerous sets of Tantric vows, termed samaya, which are given as part of Tantric initiations.

Compassion (&quot;karuṇā&quot;) practices are also particularly important in Tibetan Buddhism. One of the foremost authoritative texts on the Bodhisattva path is the &quot;Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra&quot; by Shantideva. In the eighth section entitled &quot;Meditative Concentration&quot;, Shantideva describes meditation on Karunā as thus:

A popular compassion meditation in Tibetan Buddhism is &quot;tonglen&quot; (sending and taking love and suffering respectively). Practices associated with Chenrezig (Avalokiteshvara), also tend to focus on compassion.

=== Samatha and Vipaśyanā ===

The 14th Dalai Lama defines meditation (&quot;bsgom pa&quot;) as &quot;familiarization of the mind with an object of meditation.&quot; Traditionally, Tibetan Buddhism follows the two main approaches to meditation or mental cultivation (&quot;bhavana&quot;) taught in all forms of Buddhism, śamatha (Tib. &quot;Shine&quot;) and vipaśyanā (&quot;lhaktong&quot;).

The practice of śamatha (calm abiding) is one of focusing one&#x27;s mind on a single object such as a Buddha figure or the breath. Through repeated practice one&#x27;s mind gradually becomes more stable, calm and happy. It is defined by Takpo Tashi Namgyal as &quot;fixing the mind upon any object so as to maintain it without distraction...focusing the mind on an object and maintaining it in that state until finally it is channeled into one stream of attention and evenness.&quot; The nine mental abidings is the main progressive framework used for śamatha in Tibetan Buddhism.

Once a meditator has reached the ninth level of this schema they achieve what is termed &quot;pliancy&quot; (Tib. &quot;shin tu sbyangs pa&quot;, Skt. &quot;prasrabdhi&quot;), defined as &quot;a serviceability of mind and body such that the mind can be set on a virtuous object of observation as long as one likes; it has the function of removing all obstructions.&quot; This is also said to be very joyful and blissful for the body and the mind.

The other form of Buddhist meditation is vipaśyanā (clear seeing, higher insight), which in Tibetan Buddhism is generally practiced after having attained proficiency in śamatha. This is generally seen as having two aspects, one of which is analytic meditation, which is based on contemplating and thinking rationally about ideas and concepts. As part of this process, entertaining doubts and engaging in internal debate over them is encouraged in some traditions. The other type of vipaśyanā is a non-analytical, &quot;simple&quot; yogic style called &quot;trömeh&quot; in Tibetan, which means &quot;without complication&quot;.

A meditation routine may involve alternating sessions of vipaśyanā to achieve deeper levels of realization, and samatha to consolidate them.

=== Preliminary practices ===
Vajrayāna is believed by Tibetan Buddhists to be the fastest method for attaining Buddhahood but for unqualified practitioners it can be dangerous. To engage in it one must receive an appropriate initiation (also known as an &quot;empowerment&quot;) from a lama who is fully qualified to give it. The aim of preliminary practices (&quot;ngöndro&quot;) is to start the student on the correct path for such higher teachings. Just as Sutrayāna preceded Vajrayāna historically in India, so sutra practices constitute those that are preliminary to tantric ones.

Preliminary practices include all &quot;Sutrayāna&quot; activities that yield merit like hearing teachings, prostrations, offerings, prayers and acts of kindness and compassion, but chief among the preliminary practices are realizations through meditation on the three principal stages of the path: renunciation, the altruistic bodhicitta wish to attain enlightenment and the wisdom realizing emptiness. For a person without the basis of these three in particular to practice Vajrayāna can be like a small child trying to ride an unbroken horse.

The most widespread preliminary practices include: taking refuge, prostration, Vajrasattva meditation, mandala offerings and guru yoga. The merit acquired in the preliminary practices facilitates progress in Vajrayāna. While many Buddhists may spend a lifetime exclusively on sutra practices, an amalgam of the two to some degree is common. For example, in order to train in calm abiding, one might visualize a tantric deity.

==== Guru yoga ====
As in other Buddhist traditions, an attitude of reverence for the teacher, or guru, is also highly prized. At the beginning of a public teaching, a &quot;lama&quot; will do prostrations to the throne on which he will teach due to its symbolism, or to an image of the Buddha behind that throne, then students will do prostrations to the lama after he is seated. Merit accrues when one&#x27;s interactions with the teacher are imbued with such reverence in the form of guru devotion, a code of practices governing them that derives from Indian sources. By such things as avoiding disturbance to the peace of mind of one&#x27;s teacher, and wholeheartedly following his prescriptions, much merit accrues and this can significantly help improve one&#x27;s practice.

There is a general sense in which any Tibetan Buddhist teacher is called a &quot;lama&quot;. A student may have taken teachings from many authorities and revere them all as &quot;lamas&quot; in this general sense. However, he will typically have one held in special esteem as his own root guru and is encouraged to view the other teachers who are less dear to him, however more exalted their status, as embodied in and subsumed by the root guru.

One particular feature of the Tantric view of teacher student relationship is that in Tibetan Buddhist Tantra, one is instructed to regard one&#x27;s guru as an awakened Buddha.

=== Esotericism and vows ===
In Vajrayāna particularly, Tibetan Buddhists subscribe to a voluntary code of self-censorship, whereby the uninitiated do not seek and are not provided with information about it. This self-censorship may be applied more or less strictly depending on circumstances such as the material involved. A depiction of a mandala may be less public than that of a deity. That of a higher tantric deity may be less public than that of a lower. The degree to which information on Vajrayāna is now public in western languages is controversial among Tibetan Buddhists.

Buddhism has always had a taste for esotericism since its earliest period in India. Tibetans today maintain greater or lesser degrees of confidentiality also with information on the &quot;vinaya&quot; and emptiness specifically. In Buddhist teachings generally, too, there is caution about revealing information to people who may be unready for it.

Practicing tantra also includes the maintaining of a separate set of vows, which are called &quot;Samaya (dam tshig)&quot;. There are various lists of these and they may differ depending on the practice and one&#x27;s lineage or individual guru. Upholding these vows is said to be essential for tantric practice and breaking them is said to cause great harm.

=== Ritual ===
There has been a &quot;close association&quot; between the religious and the secular, the spiritual and the temporal in Tibet. The term for this relationship is &quot;chos srid zung &#x27;brel.&quot; Traditionally Tibetan lamas have tended to the lay populace by helping them with issues such as protection and prosperity. Common traditions have been the various rites and rituals for mundane ends, such as purifying one&#x27;s karma, avoiding harm from demonic forces and enemies, and promoting a successful harvest. Divination and exorcism are examples of practices a lama might use for this.
Ritual is generally more elaborate than in other forms of Buddhism, with complex altar arrangements and works of art (such as mandalas and thangkas), many ritual objects, hand gestures (&quot;mudra&quot;), chants, and musical instruments.
A special kind of ritual called an initiation or empowerment (Sanskrit: &quot;Abhiseka&quot;, Tibetan: &quot;Wangkur&quot;) is central to Tantric practice. These rituals consecrate a practitioner into a particular Tantric practice associated with individual mandalas of deities and mantras. Without having gone through initiation, one is generally not allowed to practice the higher Tantras.

Another important ritual occasion in Tibetan Buddhism is that of mortuary rituals which are supposed to assure that one has a positive rebirth and a good spiritual path in the future. Of central importance to Tibetan Buddhist &quot;Ars moriendi&quot; is the idea of the bardo (Sanskrit: &quot;antarābhava&quot;), the intermediate or liminal state between life and death. Rituals and the readings of texts such as the &quot;Bardo Thodol&quot; are done to ensure that the dying person can navigate this intermediate state skillfully. Cremation and sky burial are traditionally the main funeral rites used to dispose of the body.

=== Mantra ===

The use of (mainly Sanskrit) prayer formulas, incantations or phrases called mantras (Tibetan: &quot;sngags&quot;) is another widespread feature of Tibetan Buddhist practice. So common is the use of mantras that Vajrayana is also sometimes called &quot;Mantrayāna&quot; (the mantra vehicle). Mantras are widely recited, chanted, written or inscribed, and visualized as part of different forms of meditation. Each mantra has symbolic meaning and will often have a connection to a particular Buddha or Bodhisattva. Each deity&#x27;s mantra is seen as symbolizing the function, speech and power of the deity.

Tibetan Buddhist practitioners repeat mantras like Om Mani Padme Hum in order to train the mind, and transform their thoughts in line with the divine qualities of the mantra&#x27;s deity and special power. Tibetan Buddhists see the etymology of the term mantra as meaning &quot;mind protector&quot;, and mantras is seen as a way to guard the mind against negativity.

According to Lama Zopa Rinpoche:Mantras are effective because they help keep your mind quiet and peaceful, automatically integrating it into one-pointedness. They make your mind receptive to very subtle vibrations and thereby heighten your perception. Their recitation eradicates gross negativities and the true nature of things can then be reflected in your mind&#x27;s resulting clarity. By practising a transcendental mantra, you can in fact purify all the defiled energy of your body, speech, and mind.Mantras also serve to focus the mind as a samatha (calming) practice as well as a way to transform the mind through the symbolic meaning of the mantra. In Buddhism, it is important to have the proper intention, focus and faith when practicing mantras, if one does not, they will not work. Unlike in Hinduism, mantras are not believed to have inherent power of their own, and thus without the proper faith, intention and mental focus, they are just mere sounds. Thus according to the Tibetan philosopher Jamgon Ju Mipham:

if a mantra is thought to be something ordinary and not seen for what it is, it will not be able to perform its intended function. Mantras are like non-conceptual wish-fulfilling jewels. Infusing one&#x27;s being with the blessings of mantra, like the form of a moon reflected on a body of water, necessitates the presence of faith and other conditions that set the stage for the spiritual attainments of mantra. Just as the moon&#x27;s reflection cannot appear without water, mantras cannot function without the presence of faith and other such factors in one&#x27;s being.

Mantras are part of the highest tantric practices in Tibetan Buddhism, such as Deity Yoga and are recited and visualized during tantric sadhanas. Thus, Tsongkhapa says that mantra &quot;protects the mind from ordinary appearances and conceptions&quot;. This is because in Tibetan Buddhist Tantric praxis, one must develop a sense that everything is divine.

=== Tantric sadhana and yoga ===

In what is called &quot;higher yoga tantra&quot; the emphasis is on various spiritual practices, called yogas (&quot;naljor&quot;) and sadhanas (&quot;druptap&quot;) which allow the practitioner to realize the true nature of reality.

&quot;Deity Yoga&quot; (Tibetan: &quot;lha&#x27;i rnal &#x27;byor&quot;; Sanskrit: &quot;Devata-yoga&quot;) is a fundamental practice of Vajrayana Buddhism involving visualization of mental images consisting mainly of Buddhist deities such as Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and fierce deities, along mantra repetition. According to Geoffrey Samuel:If Buddhahood is a source of infinite potentiality accessible at any time, then the Tantric deities are in a sense partial aspects, refractions of that total potentiality. Visualizing one of these deities, or oneself identifying with one of them, is not, in Tibetan Tantric thought, a technique to worship an external entity. Rather, it is a way of accessing or tuning into something that is an intrinsic part of the structure of the universe—as of course is the practitioner him or herself.Deity yoga involves two stages, the generation stage (&quot;utpattikrama&quot;) and the completion stage (&quot;nispannakrama&quot;). In the generation stage, one dissolves the mundane world and visualizes one&#x27;s chosen deity (&quot;yidam&quot;), its mandala and companion deities, resulting in identification with this divine reality.

In the completion stage, one dissolves the visualization of and identification with the yidam in the realization ultimate reality. Completion stage practices can also include subtle body energy practices, such as &quot;tummo&quot; (lit. &quot;Fierce Woman&quot;, Skt. &quot;caṇḍālī,&quot; inner fire), as well as other practices that can be found in systems such as the Six Yogas of Naropa (like Dream Yoga, Bardo Yoga and Phowa) and the Six Vajra-yogas of Kalacakra.

=== Dzogchen and Mahamudra ===
Another form of high level Tibetan Buddhist practice are the meditations associated with the traditions of Mahāmudrā (&quot;Great Seal&quot;) and Dzogchen (&quot;Great Perfection&quot;). These traditions focus on direct experience of the very nature of reality, which is variously termed &quot;dharmakaya&quot;, buddha nature, or the &quot;basis&#x27; (&quot;gzhi&quot;). These techniques do not rely on deity yoga methods but on direct pointing-out instruction from a master and are often seen as the most advanced form of Buddhist practice. The instructions associated with these approaches to meditation and realization are collectively referred to as mind teachings since both provide practical guidance on the &quot;recognition of the nature of mind.&quot;

The views and practices associated with Dzogchen and Mahāmudrā are also often seen as the culmination of the Buddhist path. In some traditions, they are seen as a separate vehicle to liberation. In the Nyingma school (as well as in Bon), Dzogchen is considered to be a separate and independent vehicle (also called Atiyoga), as well as the highest of all vehicles. Similarly, in Kagyu, Mahāmudrā is sometimes seen as a separate vehicle, the &quot;Sahajayana&quot; (Tibetan: &quot;lhen chig kye pa&quot;), also known as the vehicle of self-liberation.

== Institutions and clergy ==


Buddhist monasticism is an important part of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, all the major and minor schools maintain large monastic institutions based on the Mulasarvastivada Vinaya (monastic rule) and many religious leaders come from the monastic community. That being said, there are also many religious leaders or teachers (called &quot;Lamas&quot; and &quot;Gurus&quot;) which are not celibate monastics. According to Geoffrey Samuel this is where &quot;religious leadership in Tibetan Buddhism contrasts most strongly with much of the rest of the Buddhist world.&quot;

According to Namkhai Norbu, in Tibet, Tibetan lamas had four main types of lifestyles:

those who were monks, living in monasteries; those who lived a lay life, with their homes in villages; lay masters who lived as tent-dwelling nomads, travelling with their disciples, in some cases following their herds; and those who were yogis, often living in caves.

Lamas are generally skilled and experienced tantric practitioners and ritual specialists in a specific initiation lineage and may be laypersons or monastics. They act not just as teachers, but as spiritual guides and guardians of the lineage teachings that they have received through a long and intimate process of apprenticeship with their Lamas.

Tibetan Buddhism also includes a number of lay clergy and lay tantric specialists, such as &quot;Ngagpas&quot; (Skt. &quot;mantrī&quot;), &quot;Gomchens&quot;, &quot;Serkyims&quot;, and &quot;Chödpas&quot; (practitioners of Chöd). According to Samuel, in the more remote parts of the Himalayas, communities were often led by lay religious specialists. Thus, while the large monastic institutions were present in the regions of the Tibetan plateau which were more centralized politically, in other regions they were absent and instead smaller &quot;gompas&quot; and more lay oriented communities prevailed.

Samuel outlines four main types of religious communities in Tibet:

* Small communities of lay practitioners attached to a temple and a lama. Lay practitioners might stay in the &quot;gompa&quot; for periodic retreats.
* Small communities of celibate monastics attached to a temple and a lama, often part of a village.
* Medium to large communities of celibate monastics. These could maintain several hundred monks and might have extensive land holdings, be financially independent, and sometimes also act as trading centers.
* Large teaching monasteries with thousands of monks, such as the big Gelug establishments of Sera (with over 6000 monks in the first half of the 20th century) and Drepung (over 7000).

In some cases a lama is the leader of a spiritual community. Some lamas gain their title through being part of particular family which maintains a lineage of hereditary lamas (and are thus often laypersons). One example is the Sakya family of Kon, who founded the Sakya school and another is the hereditary lamas of Mindrolling monastery.

In other cases, lamas may be seen as &quot;tülkus&quot; (&quot;incarnations&quot;). Tülkus are figures which are recognized as reincarnations of a particular bodhisattva or a previous religious figure. They are often recognized from a young age through the use of divination and the use of the possessions of the deceased lama, and therefore are able to receive extensive training. They are sometimes groomed to become leaders of monastic institutions. Examples include the Dalai Lamas and the Karmapas, each of which are seen as key leaders in their respective traditions.

The system of incarnate lamas is popularly held to be a Tibetan alteration to Indian Buddhism.

Another title unique to Tibetan Buddhism is that of Tertön (treasure discoverer), who are considered capable of revealing or discovering special revelations or texts called Termas (lit. &quot;hidden treasure&quot;). They are also associated with the idea of &quot;beyul&quot; (&quot;hidden valleys&quot;), which are power places associated with deities and hidden religious treasures.

Tibetan teachers, including the Dalai Lamas, occasionally consult oracles for advice.

===Women in Tibetan Buddhism===

Women in Tibetan society, though still unequal, tended to have a relatively greater autonomy and power than in surrounding societies. This might be because of the smaller household sizes and low population density in Tibet. Women traditionally took many roles in Tibetan Buddhism, from lay supporters, to monastics, lamas and tantric practitioners.

There is evidence for the importance of female practitioners in Indian Tantric Buddhism and pre-modern Tibetan Buddhism. At least one major lineage of tantric teachings, the Shangpa Kagyu, traces itself to Indian female teachers and there have been a series of important female Tibetan teachers, such as Yeshe Tsogyal and Machig Labdrön. It seems that even though it might have been more difficult for women to become serious tantric yoginis, it was still possible for them to find lamas that would teach them high tantric practices.

Some Tibetan women become lamas by being born in one of the hereditary lama families such as Mindrolling Jetsün Khandro Rinpoche and Sakya Jetsün Kushok Chimey Luding. There have also been cases of influential female lamas who were also tertöns, such as Sera Khandro, Tare Lhamo and Ayu Khandro.

Some of these figures were also tantric consorts (&quot;sangyum, kandroma&quot;) with male lamas, and thus took part in the sexual practices associated with the highest levels of tantric practice.

==== Eastern nuns ====
While monasticism is practiced there by women, it is much less common (2 percent of the population in the 20th century compared to 12 percent of men). Nuns were also much less respected by Tibetan society than monks and may receive less lay support than male monastics.

Traditionally, Tibetan Buddhist nuns were also not &quot;fully ordained&quot; as bhikṣuṇīs (who take the full set of monastic vows in the Vinaya). When Buddhism traveled from India to Tibet, apparently the quorum of bhikṣuṇīs required for bestowing full ordination never reached Tibet. Despite an absence of ordination there, bhikṣuṇīs did travel to Tibet. A notable example was the Sri Lankan nun Candramālī, whose work with Śrījñāna () resulted in the tantric text &quot;Śrīcandramāla Tantrarāja&quot;.

There are accounts of fully ordained Tibetan women, such as the Samding Dorje Phagmo (1422–1455), who was once ranked the highest female master and tulku in Tibet, but very little is known about the exact circumstances of their ordination.

In the modern era, Tibetan Buddhist nuns have taken full ordinations through East Asian Vinaya lineages. The Dalai Lama has authorized followers of the Tibetan tradition to be ordained as nuns in traditions that have such ordination. The official lineage of Tibetan Buddhist bhikṣuṇīs recommenced on 23 June 2022 in Bhutan when 144 nuns, most of them Butanese, were fully ordained.

====Western nuns and lamas====
Buddhist author Michaela Haas notes that Tibetan Buddhism is undergoing a sea change in the West, with women playing a much more central role.

Freda Bedi was a British woman who was the first Western woman to take ordination in Tibetan Buddhism, which occurred in 1966. Pema Chödrön was the first American woman to be ordained as a Buddhist nun in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.

In 2010 the first Tibetan Buddhist nunnery in America, Vajra Dakini Nunnery in Vermont, was officially consecrated. It offers novice ordination and follows the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism. The abbot of the Vajra Dakini nunnery is Khenmo Drolma, an American woman, who is the first bhikṣuṇī in the Drikung lineage of Buddhism, having been ordained in Taiwan in 2002. She is also the first westerner, male or female, to be installed as an abbot in the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism, having been installed as the abbot of the Vajra Dakini Nunnery in 2004. The Vajra Dakini Nunnery does not follow The Eight Garudhammas.

In April 2011, the Institute for Buddhist Dialectical Studies (IBD) in Dharamsala, India, conferred the degree of geshe, a Tibetan Buddhist academic degree for monastics, on Kelsang Wangmo, a German nun, thus making her the world&#x27;s first female geshe. In 2013 Tibetan women were able to take the geshe exams for the first time. In 2016 twenty Tibetan Buddhist nuns became the first Tibetan women to earn geshe degrees.

Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo gained international attention in the late 1980s as the first Western woman to be a Penor Rinpoche enthroned tulku within the Nyingma Palyul.

==Major lineages==
The Tibetan Rime (non-sectarian) scholar Jamgon Kongtrul, in his &quot;Treasury of Knowledge,&quot; outlines the &quot;Eight Great Practice Lineages&quot; which were transmitted to Tibet. His approach is not concerned with &quot;schools&quot; or sects, but rather focuses on the transmission of crucial meditation teachings. They are:

#The Nyingma traditions, associated with the first transmission figures such as Shantarakshita, Padmasambhava and King Trisong Deutsen and with Dzogchen teachings.
#The Kadam Lineage, associated with Atisha and his pupil Dromtön (1005–1064).
#Lamdré, traced back to the Indian Mahasiddha Virupa, and today preserved in the Sakya school.
#Marpa Kagyu, the lineage which stems from Marpa, Milarepa and Gampopa, practices Mahamudra and the Six Dharmas of Naropa, and includes the four major and eight minor Kagyu lineages.
#Shangpa Kagyu, the lineage of Niguma
#Shyijé and Chöd which originate from Padampa Sangyé and Machig Labdrön.
#Dorje Naljor Druk (the &#x27;Six Branch Practice of Vajrayoga&#x27;) which is derived from the Kalachakra lineage.
#Dorje sumgyi nyendrup (&#x27;Approach and Accomplishment of the Three Vajras&#x27;), from the mahasiddha Orgyenpa Rinchen Pal.

==Tibetan Buddhist schools==
There are various schools or traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. The four main traditions overlap markedly, such that &quot;about eighty percent or more of the features of the Tibetan schools are the same&quot;. Differences include the use of apparently, but not actually, contradictory terminology, opening dedications of texts to different deities and whether phenomena are described from the viewpoint of an unenlightened practitioner or of a Buddha. On questions of philosophy, there has historically been disagreement regarding the nature of Yogacara and Buddha-nature teachings (and whether these are of expedient meaning or ultimate meaning), which still colours the current presentations of &quot;sunyata&quot; (emptiness) and ultimate reality.

The 19th century Rimé movement downplayed these differences, as still reflected in the stance of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, who states that there are no fundamental differences between these schools. However, there are still philosophical disagreements between the different traditions, such as the debate regarding rangtong and shentong interpretations of Madhyamaka philosophy.

The four major schools are sometimes divided into the Nyingma (or &quot;Old Translation&quot;) and Sarma (or &quot;New Translation&quot;) traditions, which follow different canons of scripture (the Nyingma Gyubum along with Termas and the Tengyur-Kangyur respectively).

Each school also traces itself to a certain lineage going back to India as well as certain important Tibetan founders. While all the schools share most practices and methods, each school tends to have a certain preferred focus (see table below). Another common but trivial differentiation is into the Yellow Hat (Gelug) and Red Hat (non-Gelug) sects.

The features of each major school (along with one influential minor school, Jonang) is as follows:

In his work, &quot;The Four Dharma Traditions of the Land of Tibet&quot;, Mipham Rinpoche described the four main schools as follows:

There is another minor sect, the Bodong school. This tradition was founded in 1049 by the Kadam teacher Mudra Chenpo, who also established the Bodong E Monastery. Its most famous teacher was Bodong Penchen Lénam Gyelchok (1376–1451) who authored over one hundred and thirty-five volumes. This tradition is also known for maintaining a female tulku lineage of incarnated lamas called the Samding Dorje Phagmo.

While Yungdrung Bon considers itself a separate religion with pre-Buddhist origins, and it is considered as non-Buddhist by the main Tibetan traditions, it shares so many similarities and practices with mainstream Tibetan Buddhism that some scholars such as Geoffrey Samuel see it as &quot;essentially a variant of Tibetan Buddhism&quot;. Yungdrung Bon is closely related to Nyingma Buddhism, and includes Dzogchen teachings, similar deities, rituals and forms of monasticism.

<text>A thermocouple, also known as a &quot;thermoelectrical thermometer&quot;, is an electrical device consisting of two dissimilar electrical conductors forming an electrical junction. A thermocouple produces a temperature-dependent voltage as a result of the Seebeck effect, and this voltage can be interpreted to measure temperature. Thermocouples are widely used as temperature sensors.

Commercial thermocouples are inexpensive, interchangeable, are supplied with standard connectors, and can measure a wide range of temperatures. In contrast to most other methods of temperature measurement, thermocouples are self-powered and require no external form of excitation. The main limitation with thermocouples is accuracy; system errors of less than one degree Celsius (°C) can be difficult to achieve.

Thermocouples are widely used in science and industry. Applications include temperature measurement for kilns, gas turbine exhaust, diesel engines, and other industrial processes. Thermocouples are also used in homes, offices and businesses as the temperature sensors in thermostats, and also as flame sensors in safety devices for gas-powered appliances.

==Principle of operation==

In 1821, the German physicist Thomas Johann Seebeck discovered that a magnetic needle held near a circuit made up of two dissimilar metals got deflected when one of the dissimilar metal junctions was heated. At the time, Seebeck referred to this consequence as thermo-magnetism. The magnetic field he observed was later shown to be due to thermo-electric current. In practical use, the voltage generated at a single junction of two different types of wire is what is of interest as this can be used to measure temperature at very high and low temperatures. The magnitude of the voltage depends on the types of wire being used. Generally, the voltage is in the microvolt range and care must be taken to obtain a usable measurement. Although very little current flows, power can be generated by a single thermocouple junction. Power generation using multiple thermocouples, as in a thermopile, is common.

The standard configuration of a thermocouple is shown in the figure. The dissimilar conductors contact at the measuring (aka hot) junction and at the reference (aka cold) junction. The thermocouple is connected to the electrical system at its reference junction. The figure shows the measuring junction on the left, the reference junction in the middle and represents the rest of the electrical system as a voltage meter on the right.

The temperature &quot;T&quot;sense is obtained via 
a characteristic function &quot;E&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) for the type of thermocouple which requires inputs: measured voltage &quot;V&quot; and reference junction temperature &quot;T&quot;ref. The solution to the equation &quot;E&quot;(&quot;T&quot;sense) = &quot;V&quot; + &quot;E&quot;(&quot;T&quot;ref) yields &quot;T&quot;sense. Sometimes these details are hidden inside a device that packages the reference junction block (with &quot;T&quot;ref thermometer), voltmeter, and equation solver.

===Seebeck effect===

The Seebeck effect refers to the development of an electromotive force across two points of an electrically conducting material when there is a temperature difference between those two points.
Under open-circuit conditions where there is no internal current flow, the gradient of voltage (formula_1) is directly proportional to the gradient in temperature (formula_2):
:formula_3
where formula_4 is a temperature-dependent material property known as the Seebeck coefficient.

The standard measurement configuration shown in the figure shows four temperature regions and thus four voltage contributions:
# Change from formula_5 to formula_6, in the lower copper wire.
# Change from formula_6 to formula_8, in the alumel wire.
# Change from formula_8 to formula_6, in the chromel wire.
# Change from formula_6 to formula_5, in the upper copper wire.

The first and fourth contributions cancel out exactly, because these regions involve the same temperature change and an identical material.
As a result, formula_5 does not influence the measured voltage.
The second and third contributions do not cancel, as they involve different materials.

The measured voltage turns out to be
:formula_14
where formula_15 and formula_16 are the Seebeck coefficients of the conductors attached to the positive and negative terminals of the voltmeter, respectively (chromel and alumel in the figure).

===Characteristic function===

The thermocouple&#x27;s behaviour is captured by a characteristic function formula_17, which needs only to be consulted at two arguments:
:formula_18
In terms of the Seebeck coefficients, the characteristic function is defined by
:formula_19
The constant of integration in this indefinite integral has no significance, but is conventionally chosen such that formula_20.

Thermocouple manufacturers and metrology standards organizations such as NIST provide tables of the function formula_17 that have been measured and interpolated over a range of temperatures, for particular thermocouple types (see &quot;External links&quot; section for access to these tables).

===Reference junction===

To obtain the desired measurement of formula_8, it is not sufficient to just measure formula_23.
The temperature at the reference junctions formula_6 must also be known.
Two strategies are often used here:
* &quot;Ice bath&quot;: The reference junction block is maintained at a known temperature as it is immersed in a semi-frozen bath of distilled water at atmospheric pressure. The precise temperature of the melting point phase transition acts as a natural thermostat, fixing formula_6 to 0 °C. 
* Reference junction sensor (known as &quot;&quot;): The reference junction block is allowed to vary in temperature, but the temperature is measured at this block using a separate temperature sensor. This secondary measurement is used to compensate for temperature variation at the junction block. The thermocouple junction is often exposed to extreme environments, while the reference junction is often mounted near the instrument&#x27;s location. Semiconductor thermometer devices are often used in modern thermocouple instruments.

In both cases the value formula_26 is calculated, then the function formula_17 is searched for a matching value. The argument where this match occurs is the value of formula_8:
:formula_29.

==Practical concerns==
Thermocouples ideally should be very simple measurement devices, with each type being characterized by a precise formula_17 curve, independent of any other details.
In reality, thermocouples are affected by issues such as alloy manufacturing uncertainties, aging effects, and circuit design mistakes/misunderstandings.

===Circuit construction===
A common error in thermocouple construction is related to cold junction compensation. If an error is made on the estimation of formula_31, an error will appear in the temperature measurement. For the simplest measurements, thermocouple wires are connected to copper far away from the hot or cold point whose temperature is measured; this reference junction is then assumed to be at room temperature, but that temperature can vary. Because of the nonlinearity in the thermocouple voltage curve, the errors in formula_31 and formula_33 are generally unequal values. Some thermocouples, such as Type B, have a relatively flat voltage curve near room temperature, meaning that a large uncertainty in a room-temperature formula_31 translates to only a small error in formula_33.

Junctions should be made in a reliable manner, but there are many possible approaches to accomplish this.
For low temperatures, junctions can be brazed or soldered; however, it may be difficult to find a suitable flux and this may not be suitable at the sensing junction due to the solder&#x27;s low melting point.
Reference and extension junctions are therefore usually made with screw terminal blocks.
For high temperatures, the most common approach is the spot weld or crimp using a durable material.

One common myth regarding thermocouples is that junctions must be made cleanly without involving a third metal, to avoid unwanted added EMFs.
This may result from another common misunderstanding that the voltage is generated at the junction. In fact, the junctions should in principle have uniform internal temperature; therefore, no voltage is generated at the junction. The voltage is generated in the thermal gradient, along the wire.

A thermocouple produces small signals, often microvolts in magnitude. Precise measurements of this signal require an amplifier with low input offset voltage and with care taken to avoid thermal EMFs from self-heating within the voltmeter itself. If the thermocouple wire has a high resistance for some reason (poor contact at junctions, or very thin wires used for fast thermal response), the measuring instrument should have high input impedance to prevent an offset in the measured voltage. A useful feature in thermocouple instrumentation will simultaneously measure resistance and detect faulty connections in the wiring or at thermocouple junctions.

===Metallurgical grades===

While a thermocouple wire type is often described by its chemical composition, the actual aim is to produce a pair of wires that follow a standardized formula_17 curve.

Impurities affect each batch of metal differently, producing variable Seebeck coefficients.
To match the standard behaviour, thermocouple wire manufacturers will deliberately mix in additional impurities to &quot;dope&quot; the alloy, compensating for uncontrolled variations in source material.
As a result, there are standard and specialized grades of thermocouple wire, depending on the level of precision demanded in the thermocouple behaviour.
Precision grades may only be available in matched pairs, where one wire is modified to compensate for deficiencies in the other wire.

A special case of thermocouple wire is known as &quot;extension grade&quot;, designed to carry the thermoelectric circuit over a longer distance.
Extension wires follow the stated formula_17 curve but for various reasons they are not designed to be used in extreme environments and so they cannot be used at the sensing junction in some applications.
For example, an extension wire may be in a different form, such as highly flexible with stranded construction and plastic insulation, or be part of a multi-wire cable for carrying many thermocouple circuits.
With expensive noble metal thermocouples, the extension wires may even be made of a completely different, cheaper material that mimics the standard type over a reduced temperature range.

===Aging ===

Thermocouples are often used at high temperatures and in reactive furnace atmospheres. In this case, the practical lifetime is limited by thermocouple aging. The thermoelectric coefficients of the wires in a thermocouple that is used to measure very high temperatures may change with time, and the measurement voltage accordingly drops. The simple relationship between the temperature difference of the junctions and the measurement voltage is only correct if each wire is homogeneous (uniform in composition). As thermocouples age in a process, their conductors can lose homogeneity due to chemical and metallurgical changes caused by extreme or prolonged exposure to high temperatures. If the aged section of the thermocouple circuit is exposed to a temperature gradient, the measured voltage will differ, resulting in error.

Aged thermocouples are only partly modified; for example, being unaffected in the parts outside the furnace. For this reason, aged thermocouples cannot be taken out of their installed location and recalibrated in a bath or test furnace to determine error. This also explains why error can sometimes be observed when an aged thermocouple is pulled partly out of a furnace—as the sensor is pulled back, aged sections may see exposure to increased temperature gradients from hot to cold as the aged section now passes through the cooler refractory area, contributing significant error to the measurement. Likewise, an aged thermocouple that is pushed deeper into the furnace might sometimes provide a more accurate reading if being pushed further into the furnace causes the temperature gradient to occur only in a fresh section.

==Types==

Certain combinations of alloys have become popular as industry standards. Selection of the combination is driven by cost, availability, convenience, melting point, chemical properties, stability, and output. Different types are best suited for different applications. They are usually selected on the basis of the temperature range and sensitivity needed. Thermocouples with low sensitivities (B, R, and S types) have correspondingly lower resolutions. Other selection criteria include the chemical inertness of the thermocouple material and whether it is magnetic or not. Standard thermocouple types are listed below with the positive electrode (assuming formula_38) first, followed by the negative electrode.

===Nickel-alloy thermocouples===
====Type E====
Type E (chromel–constantan) has a high output (68 μV/°C), which makes it well suited to cryogenic use. Additionally, it is non-magnetic.
Wide range is −270 °C to +740 °C
and narrow range is −110 °C to +140 °C.

====Type J====
Type J (iron–constantan) has a more restricted range (−40 °C to +1200 °C) than type K but higher sensitivity of about 50 μV/°C. The Curie point of the iron (770 °C) causes a smooth change in the characteristic, which determines the upper-temperature limit. Note, the European/German Type L is a variant of the type J, with a different specification for the EMF output (reference DIN 43712:1985-01).

The positive wire is made of hard iron, while the negative wire consists of softer copper-nickel. Due to its iron content, the J-type is slightly heavier and the positive wire is magnetic. It is highly vulnerable to corrosion in reducing atmospheres, which can lead to significant degradation of the thermocouple&#x27;s performance.

====Type K====
Type K (chromel–alumel) is the most common general-purpose thermocouple with a sensitivity of approximately 41 μV/°C. It is inexpensive, and a wide variety of probes are available in its −200 °C to +1350 °C (−330 °F to +2460 °F) range. Type K was specified at a time when metallurgy was less advanced than it is today, and consequently characteristics may vary considerably between samples. One of the constituent metals, nickel, is magnetic; a characteristic of thermocouples made with magnetic material is that they undergo a deviation in output when the material reaches its Curie point, which occurs for type K thermocouples at around 185 °C. 

They operate very well in oxidizing atmospheres. If, however, a mostly reducing atmosphere (such as hydrogen with a small amount of oxygen) comes into contact with the wires, the chromium in the chromel alloy oxidizes. This reduces the emf output, and the thermocouple reads low. This phenomenon is known as &quot;green rot&quot;, due to the color of the affected alloy. Although not always distinctively green, the chromel wire will develop a mottled silvery skin and become magnetic. An easy way to check for this problem is to see whether the two wires are magnetic (normally, chromel is non-magnetic).

Hydrogen in the atmosphere is the usual cause of green rot. At high temperatures, it can diffuse through solid metals or an intact metal thermowell. Even a sheath of magnesium oxide insulating the thermocouple will not keep the hydrogen out.

Green rot does not occur in atmospheres sufficiently rich in oxygen, or oxygen-free. A sealed thermowell can be filled with inert gas, or an oxygen scavenger (e.g. a sacrificial titanium wire) can be added. Alternatively, additional oxygen can be introduced into the thermowell. Another option is using a different thermocouple type for the low-oxygen atmospheres where green rot can occur; a type N thermocouple is a suitable alternative.

====Type M====
Type M (82%Ni/18%Mo–99.2%Ni/0.8%Co, by weight) are used in vacuum furnaces for the same reasons as with type C (described below). Upper temperature is limited to 1400 °C. It is less commonly used than other types.

==== Type N ====
Type N (Nicrosil–Nisil) thermocouples are suitable for use between −270 °C and +1300 °C, owing to its stability and oxidation resistance. Sensitivity is about 39 μV/°C at 900 °C, slightly lower compared to type K.

Designed at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) of Australia, by Noel A. Burley, type-N thermocouples overcome the three principal characteristic types and causes of thermoelectric instability in the standard base-metal thermoelement materials:
#A gradual and generally cumulative drift in thermal EMF on long exposure at elevated temperatures. This is observed in all base-metal thermoelement materials and is mainly due to compositional changes caused by oxidation, carburization, or neutron irradiation that can produce transmutation in nuclear reactor environments. In the case of type-K thermocouples, manganese and aluminium atoms from the KN (negative) wire migrate to the KP (positive) wire, resulting in a down-scale drift due to chemical contamination. This effect is cumulative and irreversible.
#A short-term cyclic change in thermal EMF on heating in the temperature range about 250–650 °C, which occurs in thermocouples of types K, J, T, and E. This kind of EMF instability is associated with structural changes such as magnetic short-range order in the metallurgical composition.
#A time-independent perturbation in thermal EMF in specific temperature ranges. This is due to composition-dependent magnetic transformations that perturb the thermal EMFs in type-K thermocouples in the range about 25–225 °C, and in type J above 730 °C.

The Nicrosil and Nisil thermocouple alloys show greatly enhanced thermoelectric stability relative to the other standard base-metal thermocouple alloys because their compositions substantially reduce the thermoelectric instabilities described above. This is achieved primarily by increasing component solute concentrations (chromium and silicon) in a base of nickel above those required to cause a transition from internal to external modes of oxidation, and by selecting solutes (silicon and magnesium) that preferentially oxidize to form a diffusion-barrier, and hence oxidation-inhibiting films.

Type N thermocouples are suitable alternative to type K for low-oxygen conditions where type K is prone to green rot. They are suitable for use in vacuum, inert atmospheres, oxidizing atmospheres, or dry reducing atmospheres. They do not tolerate the presence of sulfur.

====Type T====
Type T (copper–constantan) thermocouples are suited for measurements in the −200 to 350 °C range. Often used as a differential measurement, since only copper wire touches the probes. Since both conductors are non-magnetic, there is no Curie point and thus no abrupt change in characteristics. Type-T thermocouples have a sensitivity of about 43 μV/°C. Note that copper has a much higher thermal conductivity than the alloys generally used in thermocouple constructions, and so it is necessary to exercise extra care with thermally anchoring type-T thermocouples. A similar composition is found in the obsolete Type U in the German specification DIN 43712:1985-01.

===Platinum/rhodium-alloy thermocouples===

Types B, R, and S thermocouples use platinum or a platinum/rhodium alloy for each conductor. These are among the most stable thermocouples, but have lower sensitivity than other types, approximately 10 μV/°C. Type B, R, and S thermocouples are usually used only for high-temperature measurements due to their high cost and low sensitivity. For type R and S thermocouples, HTX platinum wire can be used in place of the pure platinum leg to strengthen the thermocouple and prevent failures from grain growth that can occur in high temperature and harsh conditions.

====Type B====
Type B (70%Pt/30%Rh–94%Pt/6%Rh, by weight) thermocouples are suited for use at up to 1800 °C. Type-B thermocouples produce the same output at 0 °C and 42 °C, limiting their use below about 50 °C. The emf function has a minimum around 21 °C (for 21.020262 °C emf=-2.584972 μV), meaning that cold-junction compensation is easily performed, since the compensation voltage is essentially a constant for a reference at typical room temperatures.

====Type R====
Type R (87%Pt/13%Rh–Pt, by weight) thermocouples are used 0 to 1600 °C. Type R Thermocouples are quite stable and capable of long operating life when used in clean, favorable conditions. When used above 1100 °C ( 2000 °F), these thermocouples must be protected from exposure to metallic and non-metallic vapors. Type R is not suitable for direct insertion into metallic protecting tubes. Long term high temperature exposure causes grain growth which can lead to mechanical failure and a negative calibration drift caused by Rhodium diffusion to pure platinum leg as well as from Rhodium volatilization. This type has the same uses as type S, but is not interchangeable with it.

====Type S====
Type S (90%Pt/10%Rh–Pt, by weight) thermocouples, similar to type R, are used up to 1600 °C. Before the introduction of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90), precision type-S thermocouples were used as the practical standard thermometers for the range of 630 °C to 1064 °C, based on an interpolation between the freezing points of antimony, silver, and gold. Starting with ITS-90, platinum resistance thermometers have taken over this range as standard thermometers.

===Tungsten/rhenium-alloy thermocouples===
These thermocouples are well-suited for measuring extremely high temperatures. Typical uses are hydrogen and inert atmospheres, as well as vacuum furnaces. They are not used in oxidizing environments at high temperatures because of embrittlement. A typical range is 0 to 2315 °C, which can be extended to 2760 °C in inert atmosphere and to 3000 °C for brief measurements.

Pure tungsten at high temperatures undergoes recrystallization and becomes brittle. Therefore, types C and D are preferred over type G in some applications.

In presence of water vapor at high temperature, tungsten reacts to form tungsten(VI) oxide, which volatilizes away, and hydrogen. Hydrogen then reacts with tungsten oxide, after which water is formed again. Such a &quot;water cycle&quot; can lead to erosion of the thermocouple and eventual failure. In high temperature vacuum applications, it is therefore desirable to avoid the presence of traces of water.

An alternative to tungsten/rhenium is tungsten/molybdenum, but the voltage–temperature response is weaker and has minimum at around 1000 K.

The thermocouple temperature is limited also by other materials used. For example beryllium oxide, a popular material for high temperature applications, tends to gain conductivity with temperature; a particular configuration of sensor had the insulation resistance dropping from a megaohm at 1000 K to 200 ohms at 2200 K. At high temperatures, the materials undergo chemical reaction. At 2700 K beryllium oxide slightly reacts with tungsten, tungsten-rhenium alloy, and tantalum; at 2600 K molybdenum reacts with BeO, tungsten does not react. BeO begins melting at about 2820 K, magnesium oxide at about 3020 K.

====Type C====
(95%W/5%Re–74%W/26%Re, by weight) maximum temperature will be measured by type-c thermocouple is 2329 °C.

(97%W/3%Re–75%W/25%Re, by weight)

====Type G====
(W–74%W/26%Re, by weight)

===Others===

====Chromel–gold/iron-alloy thermocouples====

In these thermocouples (chromel–gold/iron alloy), the negative wire is gold with a small fraction (0.03–0.15 atom percent) of iron. The impure gold wire gives the thermocouple a high sensitivity at low temperatures (compared to other thermocouples at that temperature), whereas the chromel wire maintains the sensitivity near room temperature. It can be used for cryogenic applications (1.2–300 K and even up to 600 K). Both the sensitivity and the temperature range depend on the iron concentration. The sensitivity is typically around 15 μV/K at low temperatures, and the lowest usable temperature varies between 1.2 and 4.2 K.

====Type P (noble-metal alloy) or &quot;Platinel II&quot;====
Type P (55%Pd/31%Pt/14%Au–65%Au/35%Pd, by weight) thermocouples give a thermoelectric voltage that mimics the type K over the range 500 °C to 1400 °C, however they are constructed purely of noble metals and so shows enhanced corrosion resistance. This combination is also known as Platinel II.

====Platinum/molybdenum-alloy thermocouples====
Thermocouples of platinum/molybdenum-alloy (95%Pt/5%Mo–99.9%Pt/0.1%Mo, by weight) are sometimes used in nuclear reactors, since they show a low drift from nuclear transmutation induced by neutron irradiation, compared to the platinum/rhodium-alloy types.

====Iridium/rhodium alloy thermocouples====
The use of two wires of iridium/rhodium alloys can provide a thermocouple that can be used up to about 2000 °C in inert atmospheres.

====Pure noble-metal thermocouples Au–Pt, Pt–Pd====
Thermocouples made from two different, high-purity noble metals can show high accuracy even when uncalibrated, as well as low levels of drift. Two combinations in use are gold–platinum and platinum–palladium. Their main limitations are the low melting points of the metals involved (1064 °C for gold and 1555 °C for palladium). These thermocouples tend to be more accurate than type S, and due to their economy and simplicity are even regarded as competitive alternatives to the platinum resistance thermometers that are normally used as standard thermometers.

====HTIR-TC (High Temperature Irradiation Resistant) thermocouples====
HTIR-TC offers a breakthrough in measuring high-temperature processes. Its characteristics are: durable and reliable at high temperatures, up to at least 1700 °C; resistant to irradiation; moderately priced; available in a variety of configurations - adaptable to each application; easily installed. Originally developed for use in nuclear test reactors, HTIR-TC may enhance the safety of operations in future reactors. This thermocouple was developed by researchers at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).

===Comparison of types===
The table below describes properties of several different thermocouple types. Within the tolerance columns, &quot;T&quot; represents the temperature of the hot junction, in degrees Celsius. For example, a thermocouple with a tolerance of ±0.0025×&quot;T&quot; would have a tolerance of ±2.5 °C at 1000 °C.

==Thermocouple insulation==

=== Wires insulation ===
The wires that make up the thermocouple must be insulated from each other everywhere, except at the sensing junction. Any additional electrical contact between the wires, or contact of a wire to other conductive objects, can modify the voltage and give a false reading of temperature.

Plastics are suitable insulators for low temperatures parts of a thermocouple, whereas ceramic insulation can be used up to around 1000 °C. Other concerns (abrasion and chemical resistance) also affect the suitability of materials.

When wire insulation disintegrates, it can result in an unintended electrical contact at a different location from the desired sensing point. If such a damaged thermocouple is used in the closed loop control of a thermostat or other temperature controller, this can lead to a runaway overheating event and possibly severe damage, as the false temperature reading will typically be lower than the sensing junction temperature. Failed insulation will also typically outgas, which can lead to process contamination. For parts of thermocouples used at very high temperatures or in contamination-sensitive applications, the only suitable insulation may be vacuum or inert gas; the mechanical rigidity of the thermocouple wires is used to keep them separated.

===Table of insulation materials===
Temperature ratings for insulations may vary based on what the overall thermocouple construction cable consists of.

Note: T300 is a new high-temperature material that was recently approved by UL for 300 °C operating temperatures.

==Applications==
Thermocouples are suitable for measuring over a large temperature range, from −270 up to 3000 °C (for a short time, in inert atmosphere). Applications include temperature measurement for kilns, gas turbine exhaust, diesel engines, other industrial processes and fog machines. They are less suitable for applications where smaller temperature differences need to be measured with high accuracy, for example the range 0–100 °C with 0.1 °C accuracy. For such applications thermistors, silicon bandgap temperature sensors and resistance thermometers are more suitable.

===Steel industry===
Type B, S, R and K thermocouples are used extensively in the steel and iron industries to monitor temperatures and chemistry throughout the steel making process. Disposable, immersible, type S thermocouples are regularly used in the electric arc furnace process to accurately measure the temperature of steel before tapping. The cooling curve of a small steel sample can be analyzed and used to estimate the carbon content of molten steel.

===Gas appliance safety===
Many gas-fed heating appliances such as ovens and water heaters make use of a pilot flame to ignite the main gas burner when required. If the pilot flame goes out, unburned gas may be released, which is an explosion risk and a health hazard. To prevent this, some appliances use a thermocouple in a fail-safe circuit to sense when the pilot light is burning. The tip of the thermocouple is placed in the pilot flame, generating a voltage which operates the supply valve which feeds gas to the pilot. So long as the pilot flame remains lit, the thermocouple remains hot, and the pilot gas valve is held open. If the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple temperature falls, causing the voltage across the thermocouple to drop and the valve to close.

Where the probe may be easily placed above the flame, a rectifying sensor may often be used instead. With part ceramic construction, they may also be known as flame rods, flame sensors or flame detection electrodes.

Some combined main burner and pilot gas valves (mainly by Honeywell) reduce the power demand to within the range of a single universal thermocouple heated by a pilot (25 mV open circuit falling by half with the coil connected to a 10–12 mV, 0.2–0.25 A source, typically) by sizing the coil to be able to hold the valve open against a light spring, but only after the initial turning-on force is provided by the user pressing and holding a knob to compress the spring during lighting of the pilot. These systems are identifiable by the &quot;press and hold for x minutes&quot; in the pilot lighting instructions. (The holding current requirement of such a valve is much less than a bigger solenoid designed for pulling the valve in from a closed position would require.) Special test sets are made to confirm the valve let-go and holding currents, because an ordinary milliammeter cannot be used as it introduces more resistance than the gas valve coil. Apart from testing the open circuit voltage of the thermocouple, and the near short-circuit DC continuity through the thermocouple gas valve coil, the easiest non-specialist test is substitution of a known good gas valve.

Some systems, known as millivolt control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both open and close the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed to ensure that the main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.

Out of concern about energy wasted by the standing pilot flame, designers of many newer appliances have switched to an electronically controlled pilot-less ignition, also called intermittent ignition. With no standing pilot flame, there is no risk of gas buildup should the flame go out, so these appliances do not need thermocouple-based pilot safety switches. As these designs lose the benefit of operation without a continuous source of electricity, standing pilots are still used in some appliances. The exception is later model instantaneous (aka &quot;tankless&quot;) water heaters that use the flow of water to generate the current required to ignite the gas burner; these designs also use a thermocouple as a safety cut-off device in the event the gas fails to ignite, or if the flame is extinguished.

===Thermopile radiation sensors===
Thermopiles are used for measuring the intensity of incident radiation, typically visible or infrared light, which heats the hot junctions, while the cold junctions are on a heat sink. It is possible to measure radiative intensities of only a few μW/cm2 with commercially available thermopile sensors. For example, some laser power meters are based on such sensors; these are specifically known as thermopile laser sensor.

The principle of operation of a thermopile sensor is distinct from that of a bolometer, as the latter relies on a change in resistance.

===Manufacturing===
Thermocouples can generally be used in the testing of prototype electrical and mechanical apparatus. For example, switchgear under test for its current carrying capacity may have thermocouples installed and monitored during a heat run test, to confirm that the temperature rise at rated current does not exceed designed limits.

===Power production===

A thermocouple can produce current to drive some processes directly, without the need for extra circuitry and power sources. For example, the power from a thermocouple can activate a valve when a temperature difference arises. The electrical energy generated by a thermocouple is converted from the heat which must be supplied to the hot side to maintain the electric potential. A continuous transfer of heat is necessary because the current flowing through the thermocouple tends to cause the hot side to cool down and the cold side to heat up (the Peltier effect).

Thermocouples can be connected in series to form a thermopile, where all the hot junctions are exposed to a higher temperature and all the cold junctions to a lower temperature. The output is the sum of the voltages across the individual junctions, giving larger voltage and power output. In a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, the radioactive decay of transuranic elements as a heat source has been used to power spacecraft on missions too far from the Sun to use solar power.

Thermopiles heated by kerosene lamps were used to run batteryless radio receivers in isolated areas. There are commercially produced lanterns that use the heat from a candle to run several light-emitting diodes, and thermoelectrically powered fans to improve air circulation and heat distribution in wood stoves.

===Process plants===
Chemical production and petroleum refineries will usually employ computers for logging and for limit testing the many temperatures associated with a process, typically numbering in the hundreds. For such cases, a number of thermocouple leads will be brought to a common reference block (a large block of copper) containing the second thermocouple of each circuit. The temperature of the block is in turn measured by a thermistor. Simple computations are used to determine the temperature at each measured location.

===Thermocouple as vacuum gauge===

A thermocouple can be used as a vacuum gauge over the range of approximately 0.001 to 1 torr absolute pressure. In this pressure range, the mean free path of the gas is comparable to the dimensions of the vacuum chamber, and the flow regime is neither purely viscous nor purely molecular. In this configuration, the thermocouple junction is attached to the centre of a short heating wire, which is usually energised by a constant current of about 5 mA, and the heat is removed at a rate related to the thermal conductivity of the gas.

The temperature detected at the thermocouple junction depends on the thermal conductivity of the surrounding gas, which depends on the pressure of the gas. The potential difference measured by a thermocouple is proportional to the square of pressure over the low- to medium-vacuum range. At higher (viscous flow) and lower (molecular flow) pressures, the thermal conductivity of air or any other gas is essentially independent of pressure. The thermocouple was first used as a vacuum gauge by Voege in 1906. The mathematical model for the thermocouple as a vacuum gauge is quite complicated, as explained in detail by Van Atta, but can be simplified to:
: formula_39
where &quot;P&quot; is the gas pressure, &quot;B&quot; is a constant that depends on the thermocouple temperature, the gas composition and the vacuum-chamber geometry, &quot;V&quot;0 is the thermocouple voltage at zero pressure (absolute), and &quot;V&quot; is the voltage indicated by the thermocouple.

The alternative is the Pirani gauge, which operates in a similar way, over approximately the same pressure range, but is only a 2-terminal device, sensing the change in resistance with temperature of a thin electrically heated wire, rather than using a thermocouple.

<text>A thermistor is a semiconductor type of resistor in which the resistance is strongly dependent on temperature. The word &quot;thermistor&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;thermal&quot; and &quot;resistor&quot;. The varying resistance with temperature allows these devices to be used as temperature sensors, or to control current as a function of temperature. Some thermistors have decreasing resistance with temperature, while other types have increasing resistance with temperature. This allows them to be used for limiting current to cold circuits, e.g. for inrush current protection, or for limiting current to hot circuits, e.g. to prevent thermal runaway. 

Thermistors are categorized based on their conduction models. &quot;Negative-temperature-coefficient&quot; (NTC) thermistors have &quot;less&quot; resistance at &quot;higher&quot; temperatures, while &quot;positive-temperature-coefficient&quot; (PTC) thermistors have &quot;more&quot; resistance at &quot;higher&quot; temperatures.

NTC thermistors are widely used as inrush-current limiters and temperature sensors, while PTC thermistors are used as self-resetting overcurrent protectors and self-regulating heating elements. An operational temperature range of a thermistor is dependent on the probe type and is typically between .

== Types ==

Depending on materials used, thermistors are classified into two types:

*With &quot;NTC&quot; thermistors, resistance decreases as temperature rises; usually because electrons are bumped up by thermal agitation from the valence band to the conduction band. An NTC is commonly used as a temperature sensor, or in series with a circuit as an inrush current limiter.
*With &quot;PTC&quot; thermistors, resistance increases as temperature rises; usually because of increased thermal lattice agitations, particularly those of impurities and imperfections. PTC thermistors are commonly installed in series with a circuit, and used to protect against overcurrent conditions, as resettable fuses.

Thermistors are generally produced using powdered metal oxides. With vastly improved formulas and techniques over the past 20 years, NTC thermistors can now achieve accuracies over wide temperature ranges such as ±0.1 °C or ±0.2 °C from 0 °C to 70 °C with excellent long-term stability. NTC thermistor elements come in many styles such as axial-leaded glass-encapsulated (DO-35, DO-34 and DO-41 diodes), glass-coated chips, epoxy-coated with bare or insulated lead wire and surface-mount, as well as thin film versions. The typical operating temperature range of a thermistor is −55 °C to +150 °C, though some glass-body thermistors have a maximal operating temperature of +300 °C.

Thermistors differ from resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) in that the material used in a thermistor is generally a ceramic or polymer, while RTDs use pure metals. The temperature response is also different; RTDs are useful over larger temperature ranges, while thermistors typically achieve a greater precision within a limited temperature range, typically −90 °C to 130 °C.

==Basic operation==
Assuming, as a first-order approximation, that the relationship between resistance and temperature is linear, then
: formula_1
where
: formula_2, change in resistance,
: formula_3, change in temperature,
: formula_4, first-order temperature coefficient of resistance.

Depending on type of the thermistor in question the formula_4 may be either positive or negative.

If formula_4 is positive, the resistance increases with increasing temperature, and the device is called a &quot;positive-temperature-coefficient&quot; (&quot;PTC&quot;) &quot;thermistor&quot;, or &quot;posistor&quot;. There are two types of PTC resistor&quot;switching thermistor&quot; and &quot;silistor&quot;. If formula_4 is negative, the resistance decreases with increasing temperature, and the device is called a &quot;negative-temperature-coefficient&quot; (&quot;NTC&quot;) &quot;thermistor&quot;. Resistors that are not thermistors are designed to have a formula_4 as close to 0 as possible so that their resistance remains nearly constant over a wide temperature range.

Instead of the temperature coefficient &quot;k&quot;, sometimes the &quot;temperature coefficient of resistance&quot; formula_9 (&quot;alpha sub T&quot;) is used. It is defined as
: formula_10
This formula_9 coefficient should not be confused with the formula_12 parameter below.

== Construction and materials ==

Thermistors are typically built by using metal oxides. They&#x27;re typically pressed into a bead, disk, or cylindrical shape and then encapsulated with an impermeable material such as epoxy or glass.

NTC thermistors are manufactured from oxides of the iron group of metals: e.g. chromium (CrO, Cr2O3), manganese (e.g. MnO), cobalt (CoO), iron (iron oxides), and nickel (NiO, Ni2O3). these oxides form a ceramic body with terminals composed of conductive metals such as silver, nickel, and tin.

PTCs are usually prepared from barium (Ba), strontium, or lead titanates (e.g. PbTiO3).

Thermistors can also be produced by resonant acoustic mixing of the previously mentioned oxides, followed by a sintering process. This effort reduces production time and can eliminate the calcination step entirely.

==Steinhart–Hart equation==

In practical devices, the linear approximation model (above) is accurate only over a limited temperature range. Over wider temperature ranges, a more complex resistance–temperature transfer function provides a more faithful characterization of the performance. The Steinhart–Hart equation is a widely used third-order approximation:
: formula_13
where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are called the Steinhart–Hart parameters and must be specified for each device. &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature, and &quot;R&quot; is the resistance. The equation is not dimensionally correct, since a change in the units of R results in an equation with a different form, containing a formula_14 term. In practice, the equation gives good numerical results for resistances expressed in ohms or kΩ, but the coefficients a, b, and c must be stated with reference to the unit. To give resistance as a function of temperature, the above cubic equation in formula_15 can be solved, the real root of which is given by
:formula_16
where
:formula_17

The error in the Steinhart–Hart equation is generally less than 0.02 °C in the measurement of temperature over a 200 °C range. As an example, typical values for a thermistor with a resistance of 3 kΩ at room temperature (25 °C = 298.15 K, R in Ω) are:
:formula_18

==&quot;B&quot; or &quot;β&quot; parameter equation==
NTC thermistors can also be characterised with the &quot;B&quot; (or &quot;β&quot;) parameter equation, which is essentially the Steinhart–Hart equation with formula_19, formula_20 and formula_21,

: formula_22

where the temperatures and the &quot;B&quot; parameter are in kelvins, and &quot;R&quot;0 is the resistance of the thermistor at temperature &quot;T&quot;0 (25 °C = 298.15 K). Solving for &quot;R&quot; yields

: formula_23

or, alternatively,

: formula_24

where formula_25.

This can be solved for the temperature:

: formula_26

The &quot;B&quot;-parameter equation can also be written as formula_27. This can be used to convert the function of resistance vs. temperature of a thermistor into a linear function of formula_28 vs. formula_29. The average slope of this function will then yield an estimate of the value of the &quot;B&quot; parameter.

==Conduction model==

===NTC (negative temperature coefficient)===

Many NTC thermistors are made from a pressed disc, rod, plate, bead or cast chip of semiconducting material such as sintered metal oxides. They work because raising the temperature of a semiconductor increases the number of active charge carriers by promoting them into the &quot;conduction band&quot;. The more charge carriers that are available, the more current a material can conduct. In certain materials like ferric oxide (Fe2O3) with titanium (Ti) doping an &quot;n-type&quot; semiconductor is formed and the charge carriers are electrons. In materials such as nickel oxide (NiO) with lithium (Li) doping a &quot;p-type&quot; semiconductor is created, where holes are the charge carriers.

This is described in the formula
: formula_30
where
: formula_31 = electric current (amperes),
: formula_32 = density of charge carriers (count/m3),
: formula_33 = cross-sectional area of the material (m2),
: formula_34 = drift velocity of electrons (m/s),
: formula_35 = charge of an electron (formula_36 coulomb).

Over large changes in temperature, calibration is necessary. Over small changes in temperature, if the right semiconductor is used, the resistance of the material is linearly proportional to the temperature. There are many different semiconducting thermistors with a range from about 0.01 kelvin to 2,000 kelvins (−273.14 °C to 1,700 °C).

The IEC standard symbol for a NTC thermistor includes a &quot;−t°&quot; under the rectangle.

===PTC (positive temperature coefficient)===
Most PTC thermistors are made from doped polycrystalline ceramic (containing barium titanate (BaTiO3) and other compounds) which have the property that their resistance rises suddenly at a certain critical temperature. Barium titanate is ferroelectric and its dielectric constant varies with temperature. Below the Curie point temperature, the high dielectric constant prevents the formation of potential barriers between the crystal grains, leading to a low resistance. In this region the device has a small negative temperature coefficient. At the Curie point temperature, the dielectric constant drops sufficiently to allow the formation of potential barriers at the grain boundaries, and the resistance increases sharply with temperature. At even higher temperatures, the material reverts to NTC behaviour.

Another type of thermistor is a silistor (a thermally sensitive silicon resistor). Silistors employ silicon as the semiconductive component material. Unlike ceramic PTC thermistors, silistors have an almost linear resistance-temperature characteristic. Silicon PTC thermistors have a much smaller drift than an NTC thermistor. They are stable devices which are hermetically sealed in an axial leaded glass encapsulated package.

Barium titanate thermistors can be used as self-controlled heaters; for a given voltage, the ceramic will heat to a certain temperature, but the power used will depend on the heat loss from the ceramic.

The dynamics of PTC thermistors being powered lends to a wide range of applications. When first connected to a voltage source, a large current corresponding to the low, cold, resistance flows, but as the thermistor self-heats, the current is reduced until a limiting current (and corresponding peak device temperature) is reached. The current-limiting effect can replace fuses. In the degaussing circuits of many CRT monitors and televisions an appropriately chosen thermistor is connected in series with the degaussing coil. This results in a smooth current decrease for an improved degaussing effect. Some of these degaussing circuits have auxiliary heating elements to heat the thermistor (and reduce the resulting current) further.

Another type of PTC thermistor is the polymer PTC, which is sold under brand names such as &quot;Polyswitch&quot; &quot;Semifuse&quot;, and &quot;Multifuse&quot;. This consists of plastic with carbon grains embedded in it. When the plastic is cool, the carbon grains are all in contact with each other, forming a conductive path through the device. When the plastic heats up, it expands, forcing the carbon grains apart, and causing the resistance of the device to rise, which then causes increased heating and rapid resistance increase. Like the BaTiO3 thermistor, this device has a highly nonlinear resistance/temperature response useful for thermal or circuit control, not for temperature measurement. Besides circuit elements used to limit current, self-limiting heaters can be made in the form of wires or strips, useful for heat tracing. PTC thermistors &quot;latch&quot; into a hot / high resistance state: once hot, they stay in that high resistance state, until cooled.
The effect can be used as a primitive latch/memory circuit, the effect being enhanced by using two PTC thermistors in series, with one thermistor cool, and the other thermistor hot.

The IEC standard symbol for a PTC thermistor includes a &quot;+t°&quot; under the rectangle.

==Self-heating effects==
When a current flows through a thermistor, it generates heat, which raises the temperature of the thermistor above that of its environment. If the thermistor is being used to measure the temperature of the environment, this electrical heating may introduce a significant error (an observer effect) if a correction is not made. Alternatively, this effect itself can be exploited. It can, for example, make a sensitive air-flow device employed in a sailplane rate-of-climb instrument, the electronic variometer, or serve as a timer for a relay as was formerly done in telephone exchanges.

The electrical power input to the thermistor is just

: formula_37

where &quot;I&quot; is current, and &quot;V&quot; is the voltage drop across the thermistor. This power is converted to heat, and this heat energy is transferred to the surrounding environment. The rate of transfer is well described by Newton&#x27;s law of cooling:

: formula_38

where &quot;T&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is the temperature of the thermistor as a function of its resistance &quot;R&quot;, formula_39 is the temperature of the surroundings, and &quot;K&quot; is the &quot;dissipation constant&quot;, usually expressed in units of milliwatts per degree Celsius. At equilibrium, the two rates must be equal:

: formula_40

The current and voltage across the thermistor depend on the particular circuit configuration. As a simple example, if the voltage across the thermistor is held fixed, then by Ohm&#x27;s law we have formula_41, and the equilibrium equation can be solved for the ambient temperature as a function of the measured resistance of the thermistor:

: formula_42

The dissipation constant is a measure of the thermal connection of the thermistor to its surroundings. It is generally given for the thermistor in still air and in well-stirred oil. Typical values for a small glass-bead thermistor are 1.5 mW/°C in still air and 6.0 mW/°C in stirred oil. If the temperature of the environment is known beforehand, then a thermistor may be used to measure the value of the dissipation constant. For example, the thermistor may be used as a flow-rate sensor, since the dissipation constant increases with the rate of flow of a fluid past the thermistor.

The power dissipated in a thermistor is typically maintained at a very low level to ensure insignificant temperature measurement error due to self-heating. However, some thermistor applications depend upon significant &quot;self-heating&quot; to raise the body temperature of the thermistor well above the ambient temperature, so the sensor then detects even subtle changes in the thermal conductivity of the environment. Some of these applications include liquid-level detection, liquid-flow measurement and air-flow measurement.

==Applications==

===PTC===
* As current-limiting devices for circuit protection, as replacements for fuses. Current through the device causes a small amount of resistive heating. If the current is large enough to generate heat more quickly than the device can lose it to its surroundings, the device heats up, causing its resistance to increase. This creates a self-reinforcing effect that drives the resistance upwards, therefore limiting the current.
* As timers in the degaussing coil circuit of most CRT displays. When the display unit is initially switched on, current flows through the thermistor and degaussing coil. The coil and thermistor are intentionally sized so that the current flow will heat the thermistor to the point that the degaussing coil shuts off in under a second. For effective degaussing, it is necessary that the magnitude of the alternating magnetic field produced by the degaussing coil decreases smoothly and continuously, rather than sharply switching off or decreasing in steps; the PTC thermistor accomplishes this naturally as it heats up. A degaussing circuit using a PTC thermistor is simple, reliable (for its simplicity), and inexpensive.
* As heaters, in the automotive industry, to provide cabin heating (in addition to heating provided by a heat pump or the waste heat of an internal combustion engine), or to heat diesel fuel in cold conditions before engine injection.
* In temperature-compensated voltage-controlled oscillators in synthesizers.
* In lithium battery protection circuits.
* In an electrically actuated wax motor to provide the heat necessary to expand the wax.
* Many electric motors and dry type power transformers incorporate PTC thermistors in their windings. When used in conjunction with a monitoring relay they provide overtemperature protection to prevent insulation damage. The equipment manufacturer selects a thermistor with a highly non-linear response curve where resistance increases dramatically at the maximum allowable winding temperature, causing the relay to operate.
*To prevent thermal runaway in electronic circuits. Many electronic devices, for example bipolar transistors, draw more power as they get hotter. Commonly, such circuits contain ordinary resistors to limit the current available and prevent the device from overheating. However, in some applications, PTC thermistors allow better performance than resistors.
*To prevent current hogging in electronic circuits. Current hogging can occur when electronic devices are connected in parallel. In severe cases, current hogging can cause cascading failure of all the devices. A PTC thermistor attached in series with each device can assure the current is divided reasonably evenly between the devices. 
*In crystal oscillators for temperature compensation, medical equipment temperature control, and industrial automation, silicon PTC thermistors display a nearly linear positive temperature coefficient (0.7%/°C). A linearization resistor can be added if further linearization is needed.

===NTC===
* As a thermometer for low-temperature measurements of the order of 10 K.
* As an inrush current limiter device in power supply circuits, they present a higher resistance initially, which prevents large currents from flowing at turn-on, and then heat up and become much lower resistance to allow higher current flow during normal operation. These thermistors are usually much larger than measuring type thermistors, and are purposely designed for this application.
* As sensors in automotive applications to monitor fluid temperatures like the engine coolant, cabin air, external air or engine oil temperature, and feed the relative readings to control units like the ECU and to the dashboard.
* To monitor the temperature of an incubator.
* Thermistors are also commonly used in modern digital thermostats and to monitor the temperature of battery packs while charging.
* Thermistors are often used in the hot ends of 3D printers; they monitor the heat produced and allow the printer&#x27;s control circuitry to keep a constant temperature for melting the plastic filament.
* In the food handling and processing industry, especially for food storage systems and food preparation. Maintaining the correct temperature is critical to prevent foodborne illness.
* Throughout the consumer appliance industry for measuring temperature. Toasters, coffee makers, refrigerators, freezers, hair dryers, etc. all rely on thermistors for proper temperature control.
* NTC thermistors come in bare and lugged forms, the former is for point sensing to achieve high accuracy for specific points, such as laser diode die, etc.
* For measurement of temperature profile inside the sealed cavity of a convective (thermal) inertial sensor.
*Thermistor Probe Assemblies offer protection of the sensor in harsh environments. The thermistor sensing element can be packaged into a variety of enclosures for use in industries such as HVAC/R, Building Automation, Pool/Spa, Energy and Industrial Electronics. Enclosures can be made out of stainless steel, aluminum, copper brass or plastic and configurations include threaded (NPT, etc.), flanged (with mounting holes for ease of installation) and straight (flat tip, pointed tip, radius tip, etc.). Thermistor probe assemblies are very rugged and are highly customizable to fit the application needs. Probe assemblies have gained in popularity over the years as improvements in research, engineering and manufacturing techniques have been made.
* UL Recognized NTC thermistors in the XGPU2 category helps save equipment manufacturers time and money when applying for safety approvals for their end product. DO-35 hermetically sealed glass encapsulated thermistors can operate up to 250 °C which gives them an advantage in many applications when UL is requested for a sensing element.

==History==
The first NTC thermistor was discovered in 1833 by Michael Faraday, who reported on the semiconducting behavior of silver sulfide. Faraday noticed that the resistance of silver sulfide decreased dramatically as temperature increased. (This was also the first documented observation of a semiconducting material.)

Because early thermistors were difficult to produce and applications for the technology were limited, commercial production of thermistors did not begin until the 1930s. A commercially viable thermistor was invented by Samuel Ruben in 1930.

<text>A thermometer is a device that measures temperature (the hotness or coldness of an object) or temperature gradient (the rates of change of temperature in space). A thermometer has two important elements: (1) a temperature sensor (e.g. the bulb of a mercury-in-glass thermometer or the pyrometric sensor in an infrared thermometer) in which some change occurs with a change in temperature; and (2) some means of converting this change into a numerical value (e.g. the visible scale that is marked on a mercury-in-glass thermometer or the digital readout on an infrared model). Thermometers are widely used in technology and industry to monitor processes, in meteorology, in medicine (&quot;medical thermometer&quot;), and in scientific research.

== A standard scale ==

While an individual thermometer is able to measure degrees of hotness, the readings on two thermometers cannot be compared unless they conform to an agreed scale. Today there is an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale. Internationally agreed temperature scales are designed to approximate this closely, based on fixed points and interpolating thermometers. The most recent official temperature scale is the International Temperature Scale of 1990. It extends from to approximately .

== History ==
Sparse and conflicting historical records make it difficult to pinpoint the invention of the thermometer to any single person or date with certitude. In addition, given the many parallel developments in the thermometer&#x27;s history and its many gradual improvements over time, the instrument is best viewed not as a single invention, but an evolving technology.

=== Ancient developments ===
Early pneumatic devices and ideas from antiquity provided inspiration for the thermometer&#x27;s invention during the Renaissance period.

==== Philo of Byzantium ====
In the 3rd century BC, Philo of Byzantium documented his experiment with a tube submerged in a container of liquid on one end and connected to an air-tight, hollow sphere on the other. When air in the sphere is heated with a candle or by exposing it to the sun, expanding air exits the sphere and generates bubbles in the vessel. As air in the sphere cools, a partial vacuum is created, sucking liquid up into the tube. Any changes in the position of the liquid will now indicate whether the air in the sphere is getting hotter or colder.

Translations of Philo&#x27;s experiment from the original ancient Greek were utilized by Robert Fludd sometime around 1617 and used as the basis for his air thermometer.

==== Hero of Alexandria ====
In his book, &quot;Pneumatics&quot;, Hero of Alexandria (10–70 AD) provides a recipe for building a &quot;Fountain which trickles by the Action of the Sun&#x27;s Rays,&quot; a more elaborate version of Philo&#x27;s pneumatic experiment but which worked on the same principle of heating and cooling air to move water around. Translations of the ancient work &quot;Pneumatics&quot; were introduced to late 16th century Italy and studied by many, including Galileo Galilei, who had read it by 1594.

==== First temperature scale with a fixed point ====

The Roman Greek physician Galen is given credit for introducing two concepts important to the development of a scale of temperature and the eventual invention of the thermometer. First, he had the idea that hotness or coldness may be measured by &quot;degrees of hot and cold.&quot; He also conceived of a fixed reference temperature, a mixture of equal amounts of ice and boiling water, with four degrees of heat above this point and four degrees of cold below. 16th century physician Johann Hasler developed body temperature scales based on Galen&#x27;s theory of degrees to help him mix the appropriate amount of medicine for patients.

=== Late Renaissance developments ===

==== Thermoscope ====

In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, several European scientists, notably Galileo Galilei and Italian physiologist Santorio Santorio developed devices with an air-filled glass bulb, connected to a tube, partially filled with water. As the air in the bulb warms or cools, the height of the column of water in the tube falls or rises, allowing an observer to compare the current height of the water to previous heights to detect relative changes of the heat in the bulb and its immediate environment. Such devices, with no scale for assigning a numerical value to the height of the liquid, are referred to as a &quot;thermoscope&quot; because they provide an observable indication of sensible heat (the modern concept of temperature was yet to arise).

==== Air thermometer ====
The difference between a thermoscope and a thermometer is that the latter has a scale.

Given this, the possible inventors of the thermometer are usually considered to be Galileo, Santorio, Dutch inventor Cornelis Drebbel, or British mathematician Robert Fludd. Though Galileo is often said to be the inventor of the thermometer, there is no surviving document that he actually produced any such instrument.

==== The first diagrams ====
The first clear diagram of a thermoscope was published in 1617 by Giuseppe Biancani (1566 – 1624); the first showing a scale and thus constituting a thermometer was by Santorio Santorio in 1625. This was a vertical tube, closed by a bulb of air at the top, with the lower end opening into a vessel of water. The water level in the tube was controlled by the expansion and contraction of the air, so it was what we would now call an air thermometer.

==== Coining of &quot;thermometer&quot; ====
The word thermometer (in its French form) first appeared in 1624 in &quot;La Récréation Mathématique&quot; by Jean Leurechon, who describes one with a scale of 8 degrees. The word comes from the Greek words , &quot;thermos&quot;, meaning &quot;hot&quot; and μέτρον, &quot;metron&quot;, meaning &quot;measure&quot;.

==== Sealed liquid-in-glass thermometer ====
The above instruments suffered from the disadvantage that they were also barometers, i.e. sensitive to air pressure. In 1629, Joseph Solomon Delmedigo, a student of Galileo and Santorio in Padua, published what is apparently the first description and illustration of a sealed liquid-in-glass thermometer. It is described as having a bulb at the bottom of a sealed tube partially filled with brandy. The tube had a numbered scale. Delmedigo did not claim to have invented this instrument. Nor did he name anyone else as its inventor. In about 1654, Ferdinando II de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany (1610–1670) did produce such an instrument, the first modern-style thermometer, dependent on the expansion of a liquid and independent of air pressure. Many other scientists experimented with various liquids and designs of thermometer. However, each inventor and each thermometer was unique — there was no standard scale.

==== Early attempts at standardization ====
Early attempts at standardization added a single reference point such as the freezing point of water. The use of two references for graduating the thermometer is said to have been introduced by Joachim Dalence in 1668, although Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) in 1665 had already suggested the use of graduations based on the melting and boiling points of water as standards and, in 1694, Carlo Renaldini (1615–1698) proposed using them as fixed points along a universal scale. In 1701, Isaac Newton (1642–1726/27) proposed a scale of 12 degrees between the melting point of ice and body temperature.

===Precision thermometry===

In 1714, scientist and inventor Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit invented a reliable thermometer, using mercury instead of alcohol and water mixtures. In 1724, he proposed a temperature scale which now (slightly adjusted) bears his name. In 1742, Anders Celsius (1701–1744) proposed a scale with zero at the boiling point and 100 degrees at the freezing point of water, though the scale which now bears his name has them the other way around. French entomologist René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur invented an alcohol thermometer and, temperature scale in 1730, that ultimately proved to be less reliable than Fahrenheit&#x27;s mercury thermometer.

The first physician to use thermometer measurements in clinical practice was Herman Boerhaave (1668–1738). In 1866, Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt (1836–1925) invented a clinical thermometer that produced a body temperature reading in five minutes as opposed to twenty. In 1999, Dr. Francesco Pompei of the Exergen Corporation introduced the world&#x27;s first temporal artery thermometer, a non-invasive temperature sensor which scans the forehead in about two seconds and provides a medically accurate body temperature.

==Registering==
Traditional thermometers were all non-registering thermometers. That is, the thermometer did not hold the temperature reading after it was moved to a place with a different temperature. Determining the temperature of a pot of hot liquid required the user to leave the thermometer in the hot liquid until after reading it. If the non-registering thermometer was removed from the hot liquid, then the temperature indicated on the thermometer would immediately begin changing to reflect the temperature of its new conditions (in this case, the air temperature). Registering thermometers are designed to hold the temperature indefinitely, so that the thermometer can be removed and read at a later time or in a more convenient place. Mechanical registering thermometers hold either the highest or lowest temperature recorded until manually re-set, e.g., by shaking down a mercury-in-glass thermometer, or until an even more extreme temperature is experienced. Electronic registering thermometers may be designed to remember the highest or lowest temperature, or to remember whatever temperature was present at a specified point in time.

Thermometers increasingly use electronic means to provide a digital display or input to a computer.

==Physical principles of thermometry==

Thermometers may be described as empirical or absolute. Absolute thermometers are calibrated numerically by the thermodynamic absolute temperature scale. Empirical thermometers are not in general necessarily in exact agreement with absolute thermometers as to their numerical scale readings, but to qualify as thermometers at all they must agree with absolute thermometers and with each other in the following way: given any two bodies isolated in their separate respective thermodynamic equilibrium states, all thermometers agree as to which of the two has the higher temperature, or that the two have equal temperatures. For any two empirical thermometers, this does not require that the relation between their numerical scale readings be linear, but it does require that relation to be strictly monotonic. This is a fundamental character of temperature and thermometers.

As it is customarily stated in textbooks, taken alone, the so-called &quot;zeroth law of thermodynamics&quot; fails to deliver this information, but the statement of the zeroth law of thermodynamics by James Serrin in 1977, though rather mathematically abstract, is more informative for thermometry: &quot;Zeroth Law – There exists a topological line formula_1 which serves as a coordinate manifold of material behaviour. The points formula_2 of the manifold formula_1 are called &#x27;hotness levels&#x27;, and formula_1 is called the &#x27;universal hotness manifold&#x27;.&quot; To this information there needs to be added a sense of greater hotness; this sense can be had, independently of calorimetry, of thermodynamics, and of properties of particular materials, from Wien&#x27;s displacement law of thermal radiation: the temperature of a bath of thermal radiation is proportional, by a universal constant, to the frequency of the maximum of its frequency spectrum; this frequency is always positive, but can have values that tend to zero. Another way of identifying hotter as opposed to colder conditions is supplied by Planck&#x27;s principle, that when a process of isochoric adiabatic work is the sole means of change of internal energy of a closed system, the final state of the system is never colder than the initial state; except for phase changes with latent heat, it is hotter than the initial state.

There are several principles on which empirical thermometers are built, as listed in the section of this article entitled &quot;Primary and secondary thermometers&quot;. Several such principles are essentially based on the constitutive relation between the state of a suitably selected particular material and its temperature. Only some materials are suitable for this purpose, and they may be considered as &quot;thermometric materials&quot;. Radiometric thermometry, in contrast, can be only slightly dependent on the constitutive relations of materials. In a sense then, radiometric thermometry might be thought of as &quot;universal&quot;. This is because it rests mainly on a universality character of thermodynamic equilibrium, that it has the universal property of producing blackbody radiation.

===Thermometric materials===
There are various kinds of empirical thermometer based on material properties.

Many empirical thermometers rely on the constitutive relation between pressure, volume and temperature of their thermometric material. For example, mercury expands when heated.

If it is used for its relation between pressure and volume and temperature, a thermometric material must have three properties:

(1) Its heating and cooling must be rapid. That is to say, when a quantity of heat enters or leaves a body of the material, the material must expand or contract to its final volume or reach its final pressure and must reach its final temperature with practically no delay; some of the heat that enters can be considered to change the volume of the body at constant temperature, and is called the latent heat of expansion at constant temperature; and the rest of it can be considered to change the temperature of the body at constant volume, and is called the specific heat at constant volume. Some materials do not have this property, and take some time to distribute the heat between temperature and volume change.

(2) Its heating and cooling must be reversible. That is to say, the material must be able to be heated and cooled indefinitely often by the same increment and decrement of heat, and still return to its original pressure, volume and temperature every time. Some plastics do not have this property;

(3) Its heating and cooling must be monotonic. That is to say, throughout the range of temperatures for which it is intended to work,

:(a) at a given fixed pressure,

::either (i) the volume increases when the temperature increases, or else (ii) the volume decreases when the temperature increases;

::but not (i) for some temperatures and (ii) for others; or

:(b) at a given fixed volume,

::either (i) the pressure increases when the temperature increases, or else (ii) the pressure decreases when the temperature increases;

::but not (i) for some temperatures and (ii) for others.

At temperatures around about 4 °C, water does not have the property (3), and is said to behave anomalously in this respect; thus water cannot be used as a material for this kind of thermometry for temperature ranges near 4 °C.

Gases, on the other hand, all have the properties (1), (2), and (3)(a)(α) and (3)(b)(α). Consequently, they are suitable thermometric materials, and that is why they were important in the development of thermometry.

===Constant volume thermometry===
According to Preston (1894/1904), Regnault found constant pressure air thermometers unsatisfactory, because they needed troublesome corrections. He therefore built a constant volume air thermometer. Constant volume thermometers do not provide a way to avoid the problem of anomalous behaviour like that of water at approximately 4 °C.

===Radiometric thermometry===
Planck&#x27;s law very accurately quantitatively describes the power spectral density of electromagnetic radiation, inside a rigid walled cavity in a body made of material that is completely opaque and poorly reflective, when it has reached thermodynamic equilibrium, as a function of absolute thermodynamic temperature alone. A small enough hole in the wall of the cavity emits near enough blackbody radiation of which the spectral radiance can be precisely measured. The walls of the cavity, provided they are completely opaque and poorly reflective, can be of any material indifferently. 

==Primary and secondary thermometers==
A thermometer is called primary or secondary based on how the raw physical quantity it measures is mapped to a temperature. As summarized by Kauppinen et al., &quot;For primary thermometers the measured property of matter is known so well that temperature can be calculated without any unknown quantities. Examples of these are thermometers based on the equation of state of a gas, on the velocity of sound in a gas, on the thermal noise voltage or current of an electrical resistor, and on the angular anisotropy of gamma ray emission of certain radioactive nuclei in a magnetic field.&quot;

In contrast, &quot;Secondary thermometers are most widely used because of their convenience. Also, they are often much more sensitive than primary ones. For secondary thermometers knowledge of the measured property is not sufficient to allow direct calculation of temperature. They have to be calibrated against a primary thermometer at least at one temperature or at a number of fixed temperatures. Such fixed points, for example, triple points and superconducting transitions, occur reproducibly at the same temperature.&quot;

==Calibration==

Thermometers can be calibrated either by comparing them with other calibrated thermometers or by checking them against known fixed points on the temperature scale. The best known of these fixed points are the melting and boiling points of pure water. (Note that the boiling point of water varies with pressure, so this must be controlled.)

The traditional way of putting a scale on a liquid-in-glass or liquid-in-metal thermometer was in three stages:
#Immerse the sensing portion in a stirred mixture of pure ice and water at atmospheric pressure and mark the point indicated when it had come to thermal equilibrium.
#Immerse the sensing portion in a steam bath at standard atmospheric pressure and again mark the point indicated.
#Divide the distance between these marks into equal portions according to the temperature scale being used.

Other fixed points used in the past are the body temperature (of a healthy adult male) which was originally used by Fahrenheit as his upper fixed point ( to be a number divisible by 12) and the lowest temperature given by a mixture of salt and ice, which was originally the definition of . (This is an example of a frigorific mixture.) As body temperature varies, the Fahrenheit scale was later changed to use an upper fixed point of boiling water at .

These have now been replaced by the defining points in the International Temperature Scale of 1990, though in practice the melting point of water is more commonly used than its triple point, the latter being more difficult to manage and thus restricted to critical standard measurement. Nowadays manufacturers will often use a thermostat bath or solid block where the temperature is held constant relative to a calibrated thermometer. Other thermometers to be calibrated are put into the same bath or block and allowed to come to equilibrium, then the scale marked, or any deviation from the instrument scale recorded. For many modern devices calibration will be stating some value to be used in processing an electronic signal to convert it to a temperature.

==Precision, accuracy, and reproducibility==

The &quot;precision&quot; or &quot;resolution&quot; of a thermometer is simply to what fraction of a degree it is possible to make a reading. For high temperature work it may only be possible to measure to the nearest 10 °C or more. Clinical thermometers and many electronic thermometers are usually readable to 0.1 °C. Special instruments can give readings to one thousandth of a degree. However, this precision does not mean the reading is true or accurate, it only means that very small changes can be observed.

A thermometer calibrated to a known fixed point is accurate (i.e. gives a true reading) at that point. The invention of the technology to measure temperature led to the creation of scales of temperature. In between fixed calibration points, interpolation is used, usually linear. This may give significant differences between different types of thermometer at points far away from the fixed points. For example, the expansion of mercury in a glass thermometer is slightly different from the change in resistance of a platinum resistance thermometer, so these two will disagree slightly at around 50 °C. There may be other causes due to imperfections in the instrument, e.g. in a liquid-in-glass thermometer if the capillary tube varies in diameter.

For many purposes reproducibility is important. That is, does the same thermometer give the same reading for the same temperature (or do replacement or multiple thermometers give the same reading)? Reproducible temperature measurement means that comparisons are valid in scientific experiments and industrial processes are consistent. Thus if the same type of thermometer is calibrated in the same way its readings will be valid even if it is slightly inaccurate compared to the absolute scale.

An example of a reference thermometer used to check others to industrial standards would be a platinum resistance thermometer with a digital display to 0.1 °C (its precision) which has been calibrated at 5 points against national standards (−18, 0, 40, 70, 100 °C) and which is certified to an accuracy of ±0.2 °C.

According to British Standards, correctly calibrated, used and maintained liquid-in-glass thermometers can achieve a measurement uncertainty of ±0.01 °C in the range 0 to 100 °C, and a larger uncertainty outside this range: ±0.05 °C up to 200 or down to −40 °C, ±0.2 °C up to 450 or down to −80 °C.

== Indirect methods of temperature measurement ==
;Thermal expansion
: Utilizing the property of thermal expansion of various phases of matter.
: Pairs of solid metals with different expansion coefficients can be used for bi-metal mechanical thermometers. Another design using this principle is Breguet&#x27;s thermometer.
: Some liquids possess relatively high expansion coefficients over a useful temperature ranges thus forming the basis for an alcohol or mercury thermometer. Alternative designs using this principle are the reversing thermometer and Beckmann differential thermometer.
: As with liquids, gases can also be used to form a gas thermometer.

;Pressure
: Vapour pressure thermometer

;Density
: Galileo thermometer

;Thermochromism
: Some compounds exhibit thermochromism at distinct temperature changes. Thus by tuning the phase transition temperatures for a series of substances the temperature can be quantified in discrete increments, a form of digitization. This is the basis for a liquid crystal thermometer.

;Band edge thermometry (BET)
: Band edge thermometry (BET) takes advantage of the temperature-dependence of the band gap of semiconductor materials to provide very precise optical (&quot;i.e.&quot; non-contact) temperature measurements. BET systems require a specialized optical system, as well as custom data analysis software.
: All objects above absolute zero emit blackbody radiation for which the spectra is directly proportional to the temperature. This property is the basis for a pyrometer or infrared thermometer and thermography. It has the advantage of remote temperature sensing; it does not require contact or even close proximity unlike most thermometers. At higher temperatures, blackbody radiation becomes visible and is described by the colour temperature. For example a glowing heating element or an approximation of a star&#x27;s surface temperature.

;Fluorescence
: Phosphor thermometry

;Optical absorbance spectra
: Fiber optical thermometer

;Electrical resistance
: Resistance thermometer which use materials such as Balco alloy
: Thermistor
: Coulomb blockade thermometer

;Electrical potential
: Thermocouples are useful over a wide temperature range from cryogenic temperatures to over 1000°C, but typically have an error of ±0.5-1.5°C.
: Silicon bandgap temperature sensors are commonly found packaged in integrated circuits with accompanying ADC and interface such as I2C. Typically they are specified to work within about —50 to 150°C with accuracies in the ±0.25 to 1°C range but can be improved by binning.

;Electrical resonance
: Quartz thermometer

;Nuclear magnetic resonance
: Chemical shift is temperature dependent. This property is used to calibrate the thermostat of NMR probes, usually using methanol or ethylene glycol. This can potentially be problematic for internal standards which are usually assumed to have a defined chemical shift (e.g 0 ppm for TMS) but in fact exhibit a temperature dependence.

;Magnetic susceptibility
: Above the Curie temperature, the magnetic susceptibility of a paramagnetic material exhibits an inverse temperature dependence. This phenomenon is the basis of a magnetic cryometer.

== Applications ==

Thermometers utilize a range of physical effects to measure temperature. Temperature sensors are used in a wide variety of scientific and engineering applications, especially measurement systems. Temperature systems are primarily either electrical or mechanical, occasionally inseparable from the system which they control (as in the case of a mercury-in-glass thermometer). Thermometers are used in roadways in cold weather climates to help determine if icing conditions exist. Indoors, thermistors are used in climate control systems such as air conditioners, freezers, heaters, refrigerators, and water heaters. Galileo thermometers are used to measure indoor air temperature, due to their limited measurement range.

Such liquid crystal thermometers (which use thermochromic liquid crystals) are also used in mood rings and used to measure the temperature of water in fish tanks.

Fiber Bragg grating temperature sensors are used in nuclear power facilities to monitor reactor core temperatures and avoid the possibility of nuclear meltdowns.

=== Nanothermometry ===
Nanothermometry is an emergent research field dealing with the knowledge of temperature in the sub-micrometric scale. Conventional thermometers cannot measure the temperature of an object which is smaller than a micrometre, and new methods and materials have to be used. Nanothermometry is used in such cases. Nanothermometers are classified as luminescent thermometers (if they use light to measure temperature) and thermometers (systems where thermometric properties are not directly related to luminescence).

=== Cryometer ===

Thermometers used specifically for low temperatures.

=== Medical ===

*Ear thermometers tend to be an infrared thermometer.
*Forehead thermometer is an example of a liquid crystal thermometer.
*Rectal and oral thermometers have typically been mercury but have since largely been superseded by NTC thermistors with a digital readout.

Various thermometric techniques have been used throughout history such as the Galileo thermometer to thermal imaging.
Medical thermometers such as mercury-in-glass thermometers, infrared thermometers, pill thermometers, and liquid crystal thermometers are used in health care settings to determine if individuals have a fever or are hypothermic.

=== Food and food safety ===
Thermometers are important in food safety, where food at temperatures within can be prone to potentially harmful levels of bacterial growth after several hours which could lead to foodborne illness. This includes monitoring refrigeration temperatures and maintaining temperatures in foods being served under heat lamps or hot water baths.
Cooking thermometers are important for determining if a food is properly cooked. In particular meat thermometers are used to aid in cooking meat to a safe internal temperature while preventing over cooking. They are commonly found using either a bimetallic coil, or a thermocouple or thermistor with a digital readout.
Candy thermometers are used to aid in achieving a specific water content in a sugar solution based on its boiling temperature.

=== Environmental ===
*Indoor-outdoor thermometer
*Heat meter uses a thermometer to measure rate of heat flow.
*Thermostats have used bimetallic strips but digital thermistors have since become popular.
Alcohol thermometers, infrared thermometers, mercury-in-glass thermometers, recording thermometers, thermistors, and Six&#x27;s thermometers (maximum-minimum thermometer) are used in meteorology and climatology in various levels of the atmosphere and oceans. Aircraft use thermometers and hygrometers to determine if atmospheric icing conditions exist along their flight path. These measurements are used to initialize weather forecast models. Thermometers are used in roadways in cold weather climates to help determine if icing conditions exist and indoors in climate control systems.
