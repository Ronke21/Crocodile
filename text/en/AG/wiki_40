<text>Tunnels &amp; Trolls (abbreviated &quot;T&amp;T&quot;) is a fantasy role-playing game designed by Ken St. Andre and first published in 1975 by Flying Buffalo. The second modern role-playing game published, it was written by Ken St. Andre to be a more accessible alternative to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and is suitable for solitaire, group, and play-by-mail gameplay.

==History==
Ken St. Andre, a public librarian in Phoenix, Arizona, liked the idea of fantasy role-playing after reading a friend&#x27;s &quot;D&amp;D&quot; rule books but found the actual rules confusing, so he wrote his own. &quot;I just wanted something I could play with my friends at a reasonable price, with reasonable equipment,” he said. The first edition of &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; was self-published in April 1975. Flying Buffalo Inc. published a second edition of &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; in June 1975, which soon became a serious competitor to &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; had similar game statistics, character classes, and adventures to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; but used a magic system based on points and used only six-sided dice. According to Michael Tresca, &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; explained its rules better overall, and &quot;brought a sense of impish fun to the genre&quot;.

The game underwent several modifications between the original release and when the 5th edition of the rules was published in 1979. This edition was also translated and published abroad in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Finland, Japan, and it entered these markets before &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; did in most cases.

In 1999, &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine named &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; one of &quot;The Millennium&#x27;s Most Underrated Games&quot;. Editor Scott Haring said of the game &quot;everybody knows this was the second ever fantasy roleplaying game ... But to dismiss it as just an opportunistic ripoff would be grossly unfair. Flying Buffalo&#x27;s &quot;T&amp;T&quot; had its own zany feel – it was much less serious than &quot;D&amp;D&quot; – and a less-complicated game system.&quot;

In 2005, Flying Buffalo updated the 5th edition rules with a &quot;5.5&quot; publication that added about 40 pages of extra material. That same year, Fiery Dragon Productions produced a &quot;30th Anniversary Edition&quot; under license in a tin box complete with CD, map, monster counters, and two new versions of the rules. Ken St. Andre used the opportunity to extensively update the style of play and introduce new role-playing concepts, such as character level determined by character attribute statistics instead of arbitrary numbers of experience points. The &quot;30th Anniversary&quot; rules are generally known as the 7th edition. The 7th edition also introduced a skills system. The 7.5 edition was released in 2008 by Fiery Dragon, being an update and clarification on the 30th Anniversary Edition.

In 2012, &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; was re-introduced in French-speaking markets by Grimtooth under license by Flying Buffalo. The French rulebook, which is officially the 8th edition, is based on the 7th edition, but includes elements taken from the 5.5 edition as well as clarifications by Ken St. Andre. The interior artwork includes the illustrations of the 5th edition, plus new inks by Liz Danforth. Several other products (solos and GM adventures) have been released via Lulu.com, and others have been announced.

The production work for the 8th edition prompted Flying Buffalo to start working on a Deluxe (9th) Edition of the rulebook. As Rick Loomis, head of Flying Buffalo Inc., put it, &quot;The French edition came out so beautiful that now that I have run out of 5.5, I am not satisfied to just reprint 5.5. I wanted to have a deluxe edition even better than the French one. (Competition is what drives us to be better!)&quot;. &quot;Deluxe Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot;, written by St. Andre with additional design input and editing from longtime players Liz Danforth and James &quot;Bear&quot; Peters, was published in August 2015.

In July 2021, Webbed Sphere bought Flying Buffalo, along with its catalog, but not including its Play By Mail games. In 2023, Webbed Sphere terminated licenses previously granted by Rick Loomis and Flying Buffalo to third party publishers of Tunnels &amp; Trolls products. During their ownership of the company and the Tunnels &amp; Trolls intellectual property, Webbed Sphere did not release any new versions of the game.

In May 2023, Webbed Sphere sold Tunnels &amp; Trolls, in addition to Flying Buffalo&#x27;s entire range of role-playing games, including the Citybook and Grimtooth products, as well as Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes, to Rebellion Unplugged&#x27;s table top role playing game division.

==Setting==
The 5th edition &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; core ruleset does not detail a specific setting, saying only that gameplay occurs in &quot;a world somewhat but not exactly similar to Tolkien&#x27;s Middle Earth.&quot; In an interview in 1986, Ken St. Andre stated that &quot;my conception of the &quot;T&amp;T&quot; world was based on &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot; as it would have been done by Marvel Comics in 1974 with Conan, Elric, the Gray Mouser and a host of badguys thrown in.&quot;

The current Deluxe Edition includes Ken St. Andre&#x27;s house campaign setting, Trollworld, along with additional material by early players Jim &quot;Bear&quot; Peters and Liz Danforth.

==Gameplay==

===Prime attributes===
Eight prime attributes define characters in &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot;:

*Strength (ST) determines which weapons the character can use and how much the character can carry. It also serves as magic points in 5th and earlier editions.
*Intelligence (IQ) measures the character&#x27;s ability to think and remember facts.
*Luck (LK) affects combat results and saving throws.
*Constitution (CON) measures how healthy the character is and how much damage the character can take before being killed.
*Dexterity (DEX) represents agility, nimbleness and affects marksmanship.
*Charisma (CHR) represents attractiveness and leadership ability.

Later editions add the following prime attributes:

*Wizardry (WIZ) replaces Strength for powering magic points. Also called Power (POW) in the 5.5 Edition.
*Speed (SPD) represents reaction speed and, in some editions, movement rate.

A new character begins with a randomly generated score for each attribute, determined by rolling three six-side dice.

===Character races===
The rules recommend that novice players create human characters but also offer the options of elves, dwarves, and hobbits. Other races like leprechauns and fairies serve as additional character options. A character&#x27;s race affects his or her attributes. A player may also choose to play as a &quot;monster race&quot; such as a zombie or vampire.

===Character classes===
Players also choose a character class for their character. The two base classes are Warriors and Wizards. Wizards can cast spells but have combat limitations. While Warriors cannot cast magic, they are allowed the full use of weapons, and armor is twice as effective in blocking damage. Rogues and Warrior-Wizards are also available as character classes. Both classes combine the abilities of the Warrior and the Wizard. Rogues in &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot;, unlike the Rogue classes in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, are not thieves, but could be more accurately described as &#x27;Rogue Wizards&#x27;. Rogues are limited in their spell-casting abilities, can use the same range of combat weapons and armor as a warrior, and do not receive the Warrior&#x27;s armor bonus or the Wizard&#x27;s spell-creating ability. Warrior-Wizards are not so limited, but the player must be lucky with the dice when creating the character: high minimum attribute scores are required. Later editions include new classes such as Specialist Mage, Paragon (a renaming of the Warrior-Wizard), Leader, and Ranger.

===Starting equipment and money===
New characters begin with a number of gold pieces determined by rolling three six-sided dice and multiplying the total by ten. These gold pieces can be used to buy weapons, armor, and other equipment.

===Combat===
Combat is handled by comparing dice rolls between a character and his opponent. Both sides roll a number of dice determined by which weapon is in use, then modify the appropriate result by &quot;personal adds&quot;. Totals are compared, with the higher roll damaging the opposing combatant by the difference in totals. Armor absorbs this damage taken, and any amount remaining is subtracted from the Constitution attribute.

&quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; is unusual among roleplaying games in conducting mass combat resolution with one set of rolls, as the above system applies to combat between any number of opponents.

Personal adds are determined by Strength, Luck, and Dexterity. For every point above 12 possessed in each of these attributes, the character receives a one-point bonus to his personal adds. Similarly, for every point below 9 possessed in each of these attributes, the character receives a one-point penalty.

In the 7th Edition, the formula was changed to include Speed in the personal adds. This also applies to the Deluxe Edition.

The 5.5, 7th and Deluxe editions include &#x27;spite damage&#x27; whereby each &quot;6&quot; rolled on the combat dice causes a minimum of one damage to be inflicted on the opposing side, regardless of armor or the respective combat totals. This helped resolve the interminable stalemate that could occur between evenly matched, heavily armored opponents.

===Saving rolls===
The Saving Roll (SR) is used during combat to break a stalemate or overcome the characters being outmatched as well as for use of ranged weapons. The SR is also used in all other tests of skill or luck the characters may be presented with by the GM or solo adventure. Checks are made using a character&#x27;s attribute plus 2d6 (doubles add and roll over) against a difficulty level based on the task at hand. For every level of saving roll the formula is 15+5x, with x being the level of difficulty. This was one of the earliest uses of this mechanic in RPGs.

==Reception==
In the third issue of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot;, Brant Bates called the first edition of &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; &quot;very playable, and a lot of fun&quot;, and recommended it for fantasy fans who are &quot;not purists.&quot;

Lewis Pulsipher reviewed &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #2, and stated that &quot;T&amp;T is much more limited than D&amp;D in every way. Anyone who likes T&amp;T will sooner or later &#x27;graduate&#x27; to the much more satisfying (and much more widely played) D&amp;D.&quot;

Five years later, in the March–April 1980 edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (Issue 27), Steve Jackson said of the 5th edition, &quot;On the whole, a good book, worth the price for any adventure gamer just for the ideas and comments it holds. A &quot;must&quot; for anyone playing T&amp;T with an earlier edition.&quot;

That same year, in the July 1980 edition of &quot;Ares&quot; (Issue 3), Eric Goldberg dismissed the 5th edition as &quot;a pleasant puff piece&quot;, although he agreed that since 1st edition, &quot;the production values have increased from amateur status to a nearly professional standard.&quot; However, he did not recommend it, saying, &quot;the game will be passed over by all but the completist; there are better buys on the market now.&quot;

In the 1980 book &quot;The Complete Book of Wargames&quot;, game designer Jon Freeman commented, &quot;&quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; was specifically designed to be a cheaper and simpler &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. It&#x27;s both — and faster — but not better. Several new editions over the past few years have added a few suggestions and clarifications, but there are still nearly as many holes in the rules as there were in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.&quot; Freeman specifically had issues with the lack of monster lists, treasure lists, and thief abilities, and found combat to be &quot;unsatisfyingly gross.&quot; He also objected to the &quot;tacky&quot; names for spells such as Too-Bad Toxin, Dum-Dum and Upsidaisy, saying that they &quot;lend the game an air of &quot;Ali Baba and the Three Stooges&quot;. Freeman gave this game an Overall Evaluation of only &quot;Fair&quot;, concluding, &quot;There are better alternatives available.&quot;

Ken Rolston reviewed &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; for &quot;Different Worlds&quot; magazine and stated that &quot;&quot;T&amp;T&quot; is a system which I believe compares favorably with the other FRP systems available, and one which I believe is worth your attention. I have enjoyed the years I have played the system, and I believe &quot;T&amp;T&quot; represents a particularly attractive philosophy of FRP - a philosophy that deserves your consideration whether you play the &quot;T&amp;T&quot; system or not.&quot;

In the August 1992 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 184), Rick Swan liked several aspects of the 5th edition: &quot;What the combat system lacks in realism, it makes up for in simplicity and speed&quot; and &quot;Players... will find the magic system to be exceptionally clever.&quot; Swan criticized the imprecision of the rules, calling them &quot;a hairsplitter&#x27;s delight&quot;, as well as the simplicity of the monster ratings, which meant &quot;there’s no meaningful distinction between fighting a giant slug and a drunken swordsman.&quot; But he concluded that the simplicity of the rules was its own virtue, especially for new players. &quot;The &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; game is by no means the most sophisticated alternative to the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game — the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game, the Avalon Hill Game Company&#x27;s &quot;Runequest&quot; game, and even the new &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; game are all better designs — but it’s certainly the easiest to learn. A beginner should be able to master it in an afternoon, and a veteran will probably nail it in under an hour.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan called this &quot;One of the earliest and most enduring fantasy RPGs.&quot; Swan thought that &quot;With its streamlined systems, &quot;T&amp;T&quot; is the perfect choice for players who react to charts and tables like vampires react to crosses.&quot; Swan admitted that &quot;Combat is painfully abstract&quot; and noted that there were apparently no limits to how much a character&#x27;s attributes can increase. Despite these problems, Swan gave the game a solid rating of 3 out of 4. 

In a 1996 reader poll undertaken by &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, &quot;Tunnels and Trolls&quot; was ranked 32nd. Paul Pettengale, the magazine&#x27;s editor, called &quot;T&amp;T&quot; &quot;pretty crude&quot;, noting its early release, and said &quot;It&#x27;s probably here for nostalgic reasons.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;By embracing simplicity, &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; is the first major divergence [from &quot;D&amp;D&quot;] in RPG design, one that would eventually turn into a sturdy branch of the RPG family tree, full of stripped down, minimalist fruit ... At a glance, &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; and &quot;Thousand Year Old Vampire&quot; (2019) have very little in common, but deep down, there is an unbroken line of descent.&quot;

==List of &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; publications==
&quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; was also the first system to publish a series of fantasy-themed gamebooks - adventures which are designed to be played by one person, without the need for a referee. At least twenty such adventures were published by Flying Buffalo. The &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series achieved great popularity using this format. Both &quot;T&amp;T&quot;&#x27;s simplicity and its reliance on use of six-sided dice (as compared to the various polyhedral dice used by Dungeons and Dragons) contributed to its success in this format.

===&quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; magazine===
&quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; was the &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; magazine published by Flying Buffalo. In Ken St. Andre&#x27;s editorial in the first issue (Winter 1978) the magazine was described as a &quot;&#x27;zine based around T&amp;T specifically and fantasy role-playing in general&quot;.

===Reference publications===
A number of books were published that support GMs by giving them ideas for &quot;traps&quot; and other tools for creating adventures when designing a dungeon or adventure. One example is the Grimtooth&#x27;s Traps series, authored by Paul O&#x27;Connor (and others), that is a listing of traps that GMs can insert into their adventures.

==Spin-offs==
&quot;Monsters! Monsters!&quot; is a subset of the &quot;T&amp;T&quot; rules tailored to playing monsters. It is fully compatible with 5th edition. Copyright dates listed are 1976 and 1979, published by Metagaming and then Flying Buffalo. It is occasionally reprinted as photocopies by the author, Ken St. Andre. It is now available from Flying Buffalo.

&quot;Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes&quot; is a variant system credited to Michael A. Stackpole. Publication was by Flying Buffalo, who released it in 1983, and Sleuth Publications Ltd. in 1986. While the basics are the same, it adds a skill system, changes the time scale of combat rounds, and includes rules for modern weapons.

===Video games===
In the 1980s, a ColecoVision adaptation was announced but never released.

In 1990 a computer version (&quot;Crusaders of Khazan&quot;) was published by New World Computing, which embedded portions of many of the favorite old solo modules. &quot;Crusaders of Khazan&quot; is included in the &quot;30th Anniversary Edition&quot; tin, but not the PDF version.

In 2008, an Amiga and Windows adaptation was released by James Jacobs.

In 2017, MetaArcade has published &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls Adventures&quot; for iOS and Android, an adaptation of &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; featuring over 20 classic quests. According to MetaArcade, new content will be published on a regular basis.

<doc id="30601" wikidata="Q2207501" url="?curid=30601" title="Trombetas River">
<text>The Trombetas is a large river on the northern side of the Amazon River.

==Course==

The Trombetas is long, and is navigable by 500 ton vessels for a stretch of . The Trombetas river gives birth to very many rivers, including the Anamu river.
It is formed by the junction of the Poana and Anuma rivers on the border between Brazil and Guyana.
Where it meets the Paraná de Sapucuá it takes the name of lower Trombetas, and reaches up to in width, with the stream divided by several long and narrow islands.
It runs through the municipalities of Oriximiná, Terra Santa, Óbidos and Faro.
The river basin has an area of about , with an intricate pattern of tributaries including the Poana, Anamu, Turuna, Inhabu, Mapuera and Paru de Oeste.
In the Saracá-Taquera National Forest the main streams in the Trombetas basin are the Papagaio, Água Fria, Moura, Jamari, Ajará, Terra Preta and Saracá.

Its confluence with the Amazon is just west of the town of Óbidos, Pará in Brazil. Its sources is in the Guiana highlands, but its long course is frequently interrupted by violent currents, rocky barriers, and rapids. The inferior zone of the river, as far up as the first fall, the Porteira, has but little broken water and is low and swampy; but above the long series of cataracts and rapids the character and aspect of the valley completely change, and the climate is much better. The river is navigable for above its mouth.
The river reaches its highest levels in April and May, since the rainy season usually peaks in April.

==Region==

The river flows through the Uatuma-Trombetas moist forests ecoregion.
The river basin lies partly within the Grão-Pará Ecological Station, the largest fully protected tropical forest conservation unit on the planet.
South of the ecological station it flows through the Trombetas State Forest from north to south.

<text>The Tigre River () is a Peruvian tributary of the Marañón River west of the Nanay River. It is navigable for from its confluence with the Marañón. It forms from the confluence of the Ecuadorian rivers Conambo and Pintoyacu at the Peruvian border. Like the Nanay, it flows entirely in the plains. Its mouth is west of the junction of the Ucayali River with the Marañón. Continuing west from the Tigre along the Marañón River are the Parinari, Chambira, and Nucuray, all short lowland streams, resembling the Nanay in character. &quot;Tigre&quot; is Spanish for &quot;tiger&quot;, the vernacular name in the region for the Jaguar .

<doc id="30603" wikidata="Q2089987" url="?curid=30603" title="Twelve-bar blues">
<text>The twelve-bar blues (or blues changes) is one of the most prominent chord progressions in popular music. The blues progression has a distinctive form in lyrics, phrase, chord structure, and duration. In its basic form, it is predominantly based on the I, IV, and V chords of a key. Mastery of the blues and rhythm changes are &quot;critical elements for building a jazz repertoire&quot;.

== Background ==
The blues originated from a combination of work songs, spirituals, and early southern country music. The music was passed down through oral tradition. It was first written down by W. C. Handy, an African American composer and band leader. Its popularity led to the creation of &quot;race records&quot; and the popularity of blues singers like Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey. The style of music heard on race records was later called &quot;rhythm and blues&quot; (R &amp; B). As the music became more popular, more people wanted to perform it. General patterns that existed in the blues were formalized, one of these being the 12-bar blues.

==Basic progression==
The basic progression for a 12-bar blues may be represented in several ways. 
It is shown in its simplest form, without the common &quot;quick change&quot;, turnarounds, or seventh chords. For variations, see the following section.
*Chord notation in the key of C:

*Functional notationchords are represented by T to indicate the tonic, S for the subdominant, and D for the dominant:

*Roman numeral notationI represents the tonic, IV the sub-dominant, and V the dominant:

==Variations==
=== Shuffle blues ===
In the original form, the dominant chord continued through the tenth bar; later on, the V–IV–I–I &quot;shuffle blues&quot; pattern became standard in the third set of four bars:

=== Quick to four ===

The common quick-change, quick to four, or quick four variation uses the subdominant or IV chord in the second bar.

=== Seventh chords ===
Seventh chords are a type of chord that includes the 7th scale degree (that is, the 7th note of the scale). There are different types of 7th chords such as major 7ths, dominant 7ths, minor 7ths, half diminished 7ths, and fully diminished 7ths. These chords are similar with slight changes, but are all centered around the same key center. Dominant 7th chords are generally used throughout a blues progression. The addition of dominant 7th chords as well as the inclusion of other types of 7th chords (i.e. minor and diminished 7ths) are often used just before a change, and more changes can be added. A more complicated example might look like this, where &quot;7&quot; indicates a seventh chord:

=== Bebop blues ===
This progression is similar to Charlie Parker&#x27;s &quot;Now&#x27;s the Time&quot;, &quot;Billie&#x27;s Bounce&quot;, Sonny Rollins&#x27;s &quot;Tenor Madness&quot;, and many other bop tunes. Peter Spitzer describes it as &quot;a bop soloist&#x27;s cliche to arpeggiate this chord [A79 (V/ii = VI79)] from the 3 up to the 9.&quot;


=== Minor blues ===
There are also minor twelve-bar blues, such as John Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;Equinox&quot; and &quot;Mr. P.C.&quot;. The chord on the fifth scale degree may be major (V7) or minor (v7). Major and minor can also be mixed together, a signature characteristic of the music of Charles Brown.


===Other variations===
&quot;W. C. Handy codified this blues form to help musicians communicate chord changes.&quot; Many variations are possible. The length of sections may be varied to create eight-bar blues or sixteen-bar blues.

== Melodic line ==
As the chords of a 12-bar blues follow a form, so does the melodic line. The melodic line might just be the melody of the piece or it might also include lyrics. The melody and lyrics frequently follow an AA&#x27;B form, meaning one phrase is played then repeated (perhaps with a slight alteration), then something new is played. This pattern is frequently used in the blues and in musical genres that have their roots in the blues.

<doc id="30604" wikidata="Q1219196" url="?curid=30604" title="Trimalchio">
<text>Trimalchio is a character in the 1st-century AD Roman work of fiction &quot;Satyricon&quot; by Petronius. He features as the ostentatious, nouveau-riche host in the section titled the &quot;Cēna Trīmalchiōnis&quot; (The Banquet of Trimalchio, often translated as &quot;Dinner with Trimalchio&quot;). Trimalchio is an arrogant former slave who has become quite wealthy as a wine merchant. The name &quot;Trimalchio&quot; is formed from the Greek prefix τρις and the Semitic מלך (melech) in its occidental form Malchio or Malchus. The fundamental meaning of the root is &quot;King&quot;, and the name &quot;Trimalchio&quot; would thus mean &quot;Thrice King&quot; or &quot;greatest King&quot;.

==Character description==
His full name is &quot;Gaius Pompeius Trimalchio Maecenatianus&quot;; the references to Pompey and Maecenas in his name serve to enhance his ostentatious character. His wife&#x27;s name is Fortunata, a former slave and chorus girl. Trimalchio is known for throwing lavish dinner parties, where his numerous slaves bring course after course of exotic delicacies, such as live birds sewn up inside a pig, live birds inside fake eggs which the guests have to &quot;collect&quot; themselves, and a dish to represent every sign of the zodiac.

The &quot;Satyricon&quot; has a lengthy description of Trimalchio&#x27;s proposed tomb (71–72), which is ostentatious and lavish. By the end of the banquet, Trimalchio&#x27;s drunken showiness leads to the entire household acting out his funeral, all for his own amusement and egotism.

==Cultural references==
The term &quot;Trimalchio&quot; has become shorthand for the worst excesses of the nouveau riche.

* Trimalchio and Trimalchio&#x27;s dinner is referenced in many English novels, from &quot;The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle&quot; (1758) to &quot;Pompeii&quot; (2003).
* There is a single mention of Trimalchio in F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; as his showy parties and background parallel those of Gatsby: Chapter 7 begins, &quot;It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night – and, as obscurely as it began, his career as Trimalchio was over.&quot; &quot;Trimalchio&quot; and &quot;Trimalchio in West Egg&quot; were among Fitzgerald&#x27;s working titles for the novel. In the 2013 movie adaptation, a minor character is named Trimalchio.
* Trimalchio&#x27;s feast is alluded to in the short story &quot;Toga Party&quot; by John Barth, which was included in &quot;The Best American Short Stories 2007&quot;, in reference to Tom and Patsy Hardison&#x27;s lavish toga party.
* Thomas Love Peacock mentions Trimalchio and Niceros in his preface to &quot;Rhododaphne&quot; (1818).
* Albert Pike in the &quot;Entered Apprentice&quot; chapter of his Scottish Rite Freemasonry text &quot;Morals &amp; Dogma&quot; (1871) references Trimalchio as an example of a legislator who spends the public purse lavishly or extravagantly – operating from their own vices and egotism. He counsels Scottish Rite Freemasons to stand against such lawmakers.
* In &quot;The Triumph of Love&quot; by Geoffrey Hill (1998), Trimalchio appears throughout the poem as one of its many personae.
* C. P. Snow references Trimalchio in Chapter 28 of &quot;In Their Wisdom&quot; (1974). The self-made magnate Swaffield hosts a party in order to restore favour with influential figures within the Conservative party, “…he acted as though giving a Cabinet Minister a good dinner was likely to make him a friend for life. Would it have been better, sceptics could have pondered, to avoid the ghost of Trimalchio and give that Cabinet Minister a cheese sandwich at the local pub?”. The party was held on Thursday 20 July 1972 at 27 Hill Street, W1, “There were, though, considerable departures from Trimalchio about the July party. It had to be stately, Swaffield decided before he got down to planning…”.
*DBC Pierre&#x27;s novel &quot;Lights Out in Wonderland&quot; climaxes with a dinner party closely modeled on that of Trimalchio.

<text>In geometry, a tetrahedron (: tetrahedra or tetrahedrons), also known as a triangular pyramid, is a polyhedron composed of four triangular faces, six straight edges, and four vertices. The tetrahedron is the simplest of all the ordinary convex polyhedra.

The tetrahedron is the three-dimensional case of the more general concept of a Euclidean simplex, and may thus also be called a 3-simplex.

The tetrahedron is one kind of pyramid, which is a polyhedron with a flat polygon base and triangular faces connecting the base to a common point. In the case of a tetrahedron, the base is a triangle (any of the four faces can be considered the base), so a tetrahedron is also known as a &quot;triangular pyramid&quot;.

Like all convex polyhedra, a tetrahedron can be folded from a single sheet of paper. It has two such nets.

For any tetrahedron there exists a sphere (called the circumsphere) on which all four vertices lie, and another sphere (the insphere) tangent to the tetrahedron&#x27;s faces.

== Regular tetrahedron ==
A regular tetrahedron is a tetrahedron in which all four faces are equilateral triangles. In other words, all of its faces are the same size and shape (congruent) and all edges are the same length. The regular tetrahedron is the simplest convex deltahedron, a polyhedron in which all of its faces are equilateral triangles; there are seven other convex deltahedra.

The regular tetrahedron is also one of the five regular Platonic solids, a set of polyhedrons in which all of their faces are regular polygons. Known since antiquity, the Platonic solid is named after the Greek philosopher Plato, who associated those four solids with nature. The regular tetrahedron was considered as the classical element of fire, because of his interpretation of its sharpest corner being most penetrating.

The regular tetrahedron is self-dual, meaning its dual is another regular tetrahedron. The compound figure comprising two such dual tetrahedra form a &quot;stellated octahedron&quot; or &quot;stella octangula&quot;. Its interior is an octahedron, and correspondingly, a regular octahedron is the result of cutting off, from a regular tetrahedron, four regular tetrahedra of half the linear size (i.e., rectifying the tetrahedron). 

The tetrahedron is yet related to another two solids: By truncation the tetrahedron becomes a &quot;truncated tetrahedron&quot;. The dual of this solid is the triakis tetrahedron, a regular tetrahedron with four triangular pyramids attached to each of its faces. i.e., its kleetope.

Regular tetrahedra alone do not tessellate (fill space), but if alternated with regular octahedra in the ratio of two tetrahedra to one octahedron, they form the alternated cubic honeycomb, which is a tessellation. Some tetrahedra that are not regular, including the Schläfli orthoscheme and the Hill tetrahedron, can tessellate.

=== Measurement ===

Consider a regular tetrahedron with edge length formula_1. The height of a regular tetrahedron is formula_2. Its surface area is four times the area of an equilateral triangle: formula_3
Obtaining the volume is one-third of the base times the height, the general formula for a pyramid, or by dissecting a cube into a tetrahedron and four triangular pyramids..
formula_4

Its dihedral angle—the angle formed by two planes in which adjacent faces lie—is formula_5 Its vertex–center–vertex angle—the angle between lines from the tetrahedron center to any two vertices—is formula_6 denoted the tetrahedral angle. It is the angle between Plateau borders at a vertex. Its value in radians is the length of the circular arc on the unit sphere resulting from centrally projecting one edge of the tetrahedron to the sphere. In chemistry, it is also known as the tetrahedral bond angle.
The radii of its circumsphere formula_7, insphere formula_8, midsphere formula_9, and exsphere formula_10 are:
formula_11
For a regular tetrahedron with side length formula_12 and circumsphere radius formula_7, the distances formula_14 from an arbitrary point in 3-space to its four vertices satisfy the equations:
formula_15

With respect to the base plane the slope of a face (2) is twice that of an edge (), corresponding to the fact that the &quot;horizontal&quot; distance covered from the base to the apex along an edge is twice that along the median of a face. In other words, if &quot;C&quot; is the centroid of the base, the distance from &quot;C&quot; to a vertex of the base is twice that from &quot;C&quot; to the midpoint of an edge of the base. This follows from the fact that the medians of a triangle intersect at its centroid, and this point divides each of them in two segments, one of which is twice as long as the other (see proof).

Its solid angle at a vertex subtended by a face is formula_16 or approximately 0.55129 steradians, 1809.8 square degrees, and 0.04387 spats.

=== Cartesian coordinates ===
One way to construct a regular tetrahedron is by using the following Cartesian coordinates, defining the four vertices of a tetrahedron with edge length 2, centered at the origin, and two-level edges:
formula_17

Expressed symmetrically as 4 points on the unit sphere, centroid at the origin, with lower face parallel to the formula_18 plane, the vertices are:
formula_19
with the edge length of formula_20.

A regular tetrahedron can be embedded inside a cube in two ways such that each vertex is a vertex of the cube, and each edge is a diagonal of one of the cube&#x27;s faces. For one such embedding, the Cartesian coordinates of the vertices are
formula_21
This yields a tetrahedron with edge-length formula_22, centered at the origin. For the other tetrahedron (which is dual to the first), reverse all the signs. These two tetrahedra&#x27;s vertices combined are the vertices of a cube, demonstrating that the regular tetrahedron is the 3-demicube, a polyhedron that is by alternating a cube. This form has Coxeter diagram and Schläfli symbol formula_23.

=== Symmetry ===

The vertices of a cube can be grouped into two groups of four, each forming a regular tetrahedron, showing one of the two tetrahedra in the cube. The symmetries of a regular tetrahedron correspond to half of those of a cube: those that map the tetrahedra to themselves, and not to each other. The tetrahedron is the only Platonic solid not mapped to itself by point inversion.
The regular tetrahedron has 24 isometries, forming the symmetry group known as full tetrahedral symmetry formula_24. This symmetry group is isomorphic to the symmetric group formula_25. They can be categorized as follows:
* It has rotational tetrahedral symmetry formula_26. This symmetry is isomorphic to alternating group formula_27—the identity and 11 proper rotations—with the following conjugacy classes (in parentheses are given the permutations of the vertices, or correspondingly, the faces, and the unit quaternion representation):
** identity (identity; 1)
** 2 conjugacy classes corresponding to positive and negative rotations about an axis through a vertex, perpendicular to the opposite plane, by an angle of ±120°: 4 axes, 2 per axis, together( , etc., and , etc.; ).
** rotation by an angle of 180° such that an edge maps to the opposite edge: , etc.; )
* reflections in a plane perpendicular to an edge: 6
* reflections in a plane combined with 90° rotation about an axis perpendicular to the plane: 3 axes, 2 per axis, together 6; equivalently, they are 90° rotations combined with inversion (x is mapped to −x): the rotations correspond to those of the cube about face-to-face axes

===Orthogonal projections of the regular tetrahedron===
The regular tetrahedron has two special orthogonal projections, one centered on a vertex or equivalently on a face, and one centered on an edge. The first corresponds to the A2 Coxeter plane.

===Cross section of regular tetrahedron===

The two skew perpendicular opposite edges of a regular tetrahedron define a set of parallel planes. When one of these planes intersects the tetrahedron the resulting cross section is a rectangle. When the intersecting plane is near one of the edges the rectangle is long and skinny. When halfway between the two edges the intersection is a square. The aspect ratio of the rectangle reverses as you pass this halfway point. For the midpoint square intersection the resulting boundary line traverses every face of the tetrahedron similarly. If the tetrahedron is bisected on this plane, both halves become wedges.

This property also applies for tetragonal disphenoids when applied to the two special edge pairs.

===Spherical tiling===
The tetrahedron can also be represented as a spherical tiling (of spherical triangles), and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection. This projection is conformal, preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.
=== Helical stacking ===

Regular tetrahedra can be stacked face-to-face in a chiral aperiodic chain called the Boerdijk–Coxeter helix.

In four dimensions, all the convex regular 4-polytopes with tetrahedral cells (the 5-cell, 16-cell and 600-cell) can be constructed as tilings of the 3-sphere by these chains, which become periodic in the three-dimensional space of the 4-polytope&#x27;s boundary surface.
==Irregular tetrahedra==
Tetrahedra which do not have four equilateral faces are categorized and named by the symmetries they do possess.

If all three pairs of opposite edges of a tetrahedron are perpendicular, then it is called an &quot;orthocentric tetrahedron&quot;. When only one pair of opposite edges are perpendicular, it is called a semi-orthocentric tetrahedron.
In a &quot;trirectangular tetrahedron&quot; the three face angles at &quot;one&quot; vertex are right angles, as at the corner of a cube.

An isodynamic tetrahedron is one in which the cevians that join the vertices to the incenters of the opposite faces are concurrent.

An isogonic tetrahedron has concurrent cevians that join the vertices to the points of contact of the opposite faces with the inscribed sphere of the tetrahedron.


===Disphenoid===
A disphenoid is a tetrahedron with four congruent triangles as faces; the triangles necessarily have all angles acute. The regular tetrahedron is a special case of a disphenoid. Other names for the same shape include bisphenoid, isosceles tetrahedron and equifacial tetrahedron.
===Orthoschemes===

A 3-orthoscheme is a tetrahedron where all four faces are right triangles. A 3-orthoscheme is not a disphenoid, because its opposite edges are not of equal length. It is not possible to construct a disphenoid with right triangle or obtuse triangle faces.

An orthoscheme is an irregular simplex that is the convex hull of a tree in which all edges are mutually perpendicular. In a 3-dimensional orthoscheme, the tree consists of three perpendicular edges connecting all four vertices in a linear path that makes two right-angled turns. The 3-orthoscheme is a tetrahedron having two right angles at each of two vertices, so another name for it is birectangular tetrahedron. It is also called a quadrirectangular tetrahedron because it contains four right angles.

Coxeter also calls quadrirectangular tetrahedra &quot;characteristic tetrahedra&quot;, because of their integral relationship to the regular polytopes and their symmetry groups. For example, the special case of a 3-orthoscheme with equal-length perpendicular edges is characteristic of the cube, which means that the cube can be subdivided into instances of this orthoscheme. If its three perpendicular edges are of unit length, its remaining edges are two of length and one of length , so all its edges are edges or diagonals of the cube. The cube can be dissected into six such 3-orthoschemes four different ways, with all six surrounding the same cube diagonal. The cube can also be dissected into 48 &quot;smaller&quot; instances of this same characteristic 3-orthoscheme (just one way, by all of its symmetry planes at once). The characteristic tetrahedron of the cube is an example of a Heronian tetrahedron.

Every regular polytope, including the regular tetrahedron, has its characteristic orthoscheme. There is a 3-orthoscheme, which is the &quot;characteristic tetrahedron of the regular tetrahedron&quot;. The regular tetrahedron is subdivided into 24 instances of its characteristic tetrahedron by its planes of symmetry. The 24 characteristic tetrahedra of the regular tetrahedron occur in two mirror-image forms, 12 of each.
If the regular tetrahedron has edge length 𝒍 = 2, its characteristic tetrahedron&#x27;s six edges have lengths , , around its exterior right-triangle face (the edges opposite the &quot;characteristic angles&quot; 𝟀, 𝝉, 𝟁), plus , , (edges that are the &quot;characteristic radii&quot; of the regular tetrahedron). The 3-edge path along orthogonal edges of the orthoscheme is , , , first from a tetrahedron vertex to an tetrahedron edge center, then turning 90° to an tetrahedron face center, then turning 90° to the tetrahedron center. The orthoscheme has four dissimilar right triangle faces. The exterior face is a 60-90-30 triangle which is one-sixth of a tetrahedron face. The three faces interior to the tetrahedron are: a right triangle with edges , , , a right triangle with edges , , , and a right triangle with edges , , .

===Space-filling tetrahedra===
A space-filling tetrahedron packs with directly congruent or enantiomorphous (mirror image) copies of itself to tile space. The cube can be dissected into six 3-orthoschemes, three left-handed and three right-handed (one of each at each cube face), and cubes can fill space, so the characteristic 3-orthoscheme of the cube is a space-filling tetrahedron in this sense. (The characteristic orthoscheme of the cube is one of the Hill tetrahedra, a family of space-filling tetrahedra. All space-filling tetrahedra are scissors-congruent to a cube.)

A disphenoid can be a space-filling tetrahedron in the directly congruent sense, as in the disphenoid tetrahedral honeycomb. Regular tetrahedra, however, cannot fill space by themselves (moreover, it is not scissors-congruent to any other polyhedra which can fill the space, see Hilbert&#x27;s third problem). The tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb fills space with alternating regular tetrahedron cells and regular octahedron cells in a ratio of 2:1.

===Fundamental domains===
An irregular tetrahedron which is the fundamental domain of a symmetry group is an example of a Goursat tetrahedron. The Goursat tetrahedra generate all the regular polyhedra (and many other uniform polyhedra) by mirror reflections, a process referred to as Wythoff&#x27;s kaleidoscopic construction.

For polyhedra, Wythoff&#x27;s construction arranges three mirrors at angles to each other, as in a kaleidoscope. Unlike a cylindrical kaleidoscope, Wythoff&#x27;s mirrors are located at three faces of a Goursat tetrahedron such that all three mirrors intersect at a single point. (The Coxeter-Dynkin diagram of the generated polyhedron contains three &quot;nodes&quot; representing the three mirrors. The dihedral angle between each pair of mirrors is encoded in the diagram, as well as the location of a single &quot;generating point&quot; which is multiplied by mirror reflections into the vertices of the polyhedron.)

Among the Goursat tetrahedra which generate 3-dimensional honeycombs we can recognize an orthoscheme (the characteristic tetrahedron of the cube), a double orthoscheme (the characteristic tetrahedron of the cube face-bonded to its mirror image), and the space-filling disphenoid illustrated above. The disphenoid is the double orthoscheme face-bonded to its mirror image (a quadruple orthoscheme). Thus all three of these Goursat tetrahedra, and all the polyhedra they generate by reflections, can be dissected into characteristic tetrahedra of the cube.
===Isometries of irregular tetrahedra===
The isometries of an irregular (unmarked) tetrahedron depend on the geometry of the tetrahedron, with 7 cases possible. In each case a 3-dimensional point group is formed. Two other isometries (C3, [3]+), and (S4, [2+,4+]) can exist if the face or edge marking are included. Tetrahedral diagrams are included for each type below, with edges colored by isometric equivalence, and are gray colored for unique edges.
== Subdivision and similarity classes ==
Tetrahedra subdivision is a process used in computational geometry and 3D modeling to divide a tetrahedron into several smaller tetrahedra. This process enhances the complexity and detail of tetrahedral meshes, which is particularly beneficial in numerical simulations, finite element analysis, and computer graphics. One of the commonly used subdivision methods is the Longest Edge Bisection (LEB), which identifies the longest edge of the tetrahedron and bisects it at its midpoint, generating two new, smaller tetrahedra. When this process is repeated multiple times, bisecting all the tetrahedra generated in each previous iteration, the process is called iterative LEB. 

A similarity class is the set of tetrahedra with the same geometric shape, regardless of their specific position, orientation, and scale. So, any two tetrahedra belonging to the same similarity class may be transformed to each other by an affine transformation. The outcome of having a limited number of similarity classes in iterative subdivision methods is significant for computational modeling and simulation. It reduces the variability in the shapes and sizes of generated tetrahedra, preventing the formation of highly irregular elements that could compromise simulation results.

The iterative LEB of the regular tetrahedron has been shown to produce only 8 similarity classes. Furthermore, in the case of nearly equilateral tetrahedra where their two longest edges are not connected to each other, and the ratio between their longest and their shortest edge is less than or equal to formula_28, the iterated LEB produces no more than 37 similarity classes.

== General properties ==
===Volume===
The volume of a tetrahedron can be obtained in many ways. It can be given by using the formula of the pyramid&#x27;s volume: 
formula_29
where formula_30 is the base&#x27; area and formula_31 is the height from the base to the apex. This applies for each of the four choices of the base, so the distances from the apices to the opposite faces are inversely proportional to the areas of these faces. Another way is by dissecting a triangular prism into three pieces.

Given the vertices of a tetrahedron in the following:
formula_32
The volume of a tetrahedron can be ascertained in terms of a determinant formula_33, or any other combination of pairs of vertices that form a simply connected graph. Comparing this formula with that used to compute the volume of a parallelepiped, we conclude that the volume of a tetrahedron is equal to of the volume of any parallelepiped that shares three converging edges with it.

The absolute value of the scalar triple product can be represented as the following absolute values of determinants:
:formula_34orformula_35whereformula_36are expressed as row or column vectors.

Hence
:formula_37whereformula_38

where formula_39, formula_40, and formula_41, which gives
:formula_42
where &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot; are the plane angles occurring in vertex d. The angle &quot;α&quot;, is the angle between the two edges connecting the vertex d to the vertices b and c. The angle &quot;β&quot;, does so for the vertices a and c, while &quot;γ&quot;, is defined by the position of the vertices a and b.

If we do not require that d = 0 then
:formula_43

Given the distances between the vertices of a tetrahedron the volume can be computed using the Cayley–Menger determinant:
:formula_44
where the subscripts represent the vertices and &quot;d&quot; is the pairwise distance between them – i.e., the length of the edge connecting the two vertices. A negative value of the determinant means that a tetrahedron cannot be constructed with the given distances. This formula, sometimes called Tartaglia&#x27;s formula, is essentially due to the painter Piero della Francesca in the 15th century, as a three-dimensional analogue of the 1st century Heron&#x27;s formula for the area of a triangle.

Let formula_12, formula_46, and formula_47 be the lengths of three edges that meet at a point, and formula_48, formula_49, and formula_50 be those of the opposite edges. The volume of the tetrahedron formula_51 is:
formula_52
where
formula_53
The above formula uses six lengths of edges, and the following formula uses three lengths of edges and three angles.
formula_54
The volume of a tetrahedron can be ascertained by using the Heron formula. Suppose formula_55, formula_51, formula_57, formula_58. formula_59, and formula_60 are the lengths of the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges as in the following image. Here, the first three form a triangle, with formula_58 opposite formula_55, formula_59 opposite formula_51, and formula_60 opposite formula_57. Then,
formula_67
where
formula_68
and
formula_69

Any plane containing a bimedian (connector of opposite edges&#x27; midpoints) of a tetrahedron bisects the volume of the tetrahedron.

For tetrahedra in hyperbolic space or in three-dimensional elliptic geometry, the dihedral angles of the tetrahedron determine its shape and hence its volume. In these cases, the volume is given by the Murakami–Yano formula, after Jun Murakami and Masakazu Yano. However, in Euclidean space, scaling a tetrahedron changes its volume but not its dihedral angles, so no such formula can exist.

Any two opposite edges of a tetrahedron lie on two skew lines, and the distance between the edges is defined as the distance between the two skew lines. Let formula_70 be the distance between the skew lines formed by opposite edges formula_12 and formula_72 as calculated here. Then another formula for the volume of a tetrahedron formula_51 is given by
formula_74

===Properties analogous to those of a triangle===
The tetrahedron has many properties analogous to those of a triangle, including an insphere, circumsphere, medial tetrahedron, and exspheres. It has respective centers such as incenter, circumcenter, excenters, Spieker center and points such as a centroid. However, there is generally no orthocenter in the sense of intersecting altitudes.

Gaspard Monge found a center that exists in every tetrahedron, now known as the Monge point: the point where the six midplanes of a tetrahedron intersect. A midplane is defined as a plane that is orthogonal to an edge joining any two vertices that also contains the centroid of an opposite edge formed by joining the other two vertices. If the tetrahedron&#x27;s altitudes do intersect, then the Monge point and the orthocenter coincide to give the class of orthocentric tetrahedron.

An orthogonal line dropped from the Monge point to any face meets that face at the midpoint of the line segment between that face&#x27;s orthocenter and the foot of the altitude dropped from the opposite vertex.

A line segment joining a vertex of a tetrahedron with the centroid of the opposite face is called a &quot;median&quot; and a line segment joining the midpoints of two opposite edges is called a &quot;bimedian&quot; of the tetrahedron. Hence there are four medians and three bimedians in a tetrahedron. These seven line segments are all concurrent at a point called the &quot;centroid&quot; of the tetrahedron. In addition the four medians are divided in a 3:1 ratio by the centroid (see Commandino&#x27;s theorem). The centroid of a tetrahedron is the midpoint between its Monge point and circumcenter. These points define the &quot;Euler line&quot; of the tetrahedron that is analogous to the Euler line of a triangle.

The nine-point circle of the general triangle has an analogue in the circumsphere of a tetrahedron&#x27;s medial tetrahedron. It is the twelve-point sphere and besides the centroids of the four faces of the reference tetrahedron, it passes through four substitute &quot;Euler points&quot;, one third of the way from the Monge point toward each of the four vertices. Finally it passes through the four base points of orthogonal lines dropped from each Euler point to the face not containing the vertex that generated the Euler point.

The center &quot;T&quot; of the twelve-point sphere also lies on the Euler line. Unlike its triangular counterpart, this center lies one third of the way from the Monge point &quot;M&quot; towards the circumcenter. Also, an orthogonal line through &quot;T&quot; to a chosen face is coplanar with two other orthogonal lines to the same face. The first is an orthogonal line passing through the corresponding Euler point to the chosen face. The second is an orthogonal line passing through the centroid of the chosen face. This orthogonal line through the twelve-point center lies midway between the Euler point orthogonal line and the centroidal orthogonal line. Furthermore, for any face, the twelve-point center lies at the midpoint of the corresponding Euler point and the orthocenter for that face.

The radius of the twelve-point sphere is one third of the circumradius of the reference tetrahedron.

There is a relation among the angles made by the faces of a general tetrahedron given by
:formula_75

where &quot;α&quot; is the angle between the faces &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;.

The geometric median of the vertex position coordinates of a tetrahedron and its isogonic center are associated, under circumstances analogous to those observed for a triangle. Lorenz Lindelöf found that, corresponding to any given tetrahedron is a point now known as an isogonic center, &quot;O&quot;, at which the solid angles subtended by the faces are equal, having a common value of π sr, and at which the angles subtended by opposite edges are equal. A solid angle of π sr is one quarter of that subtended by all of space. When all the solid angles at the vertices of a tetrahedron are smaller than π sr, &quot;O&quot; lies inside the tetrahedron, and because the sum of distances from &quot;O&quot; to the vertices is a minimum, &quot;O&quot; coincides with the geometric median, &quot;M&quot;, of the vertices. In the event that the solid angle at one of the vertices, &quot;v&quot;, measures exactly π sr, then &quot;O&quot; and &quot;M&quot; coincide with &quot;v&quot;. If however, a tetrahedron has a vertex, &quot;v&quot;, with solid angle greater than π sr, &quot;M&quot; still corresponds to &quot;v&quot;, but &quot;O&quot; lies outside the tetrahedron.

===Geometric relations===
A tetrahedron is a 3-simplex. Unlike the case of the other Platonic solids, all the vertices of a regular tetrahedron are equidistant from each other (they are the only possible arrangement of four equidistant points in 3-dimensional space, for an example in electromagnetism cf. Thomson problem).

The above embedding divides the cube into five tetrahedra, one of which is regular. In fact, five is the minimum number of tetrahedra required to compose a cube. To see this, starting from a base tetrahedron with 4 vertices, each added tetrahedra adds at most 1 new vertex, so at least 4 more must be added to make a cube, which has 8 vertices.

Inscribing tetrahedra inside the regular compound of five cubes gives two more regular compounds, containing five and ten tetrahedra.

Regular tetrahedra cannot tessellate space by themselves, although this result seems likely enough that Aristotle claimed it was possible. However, two regular tetrahedra can be combined with an octahedron, giving a rhombohedron that can tile space as the tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb.

On otherhand, several irregular tetrahedra are known, of which copies can tile space, for instance the characteristic orthoscheme of the cube and the disphenoid of the disphenoid tetrahedral honeycomb. The complete list remains an open problem.

If one relaxes the requirement that the tetrahedra be all the same shape, one can tile space using only tetrahedra in many different ways. For example, one can divide an octahedron into four identical tetrahedra and combine them again with two regular ones. (As a side-note: these two kinds of tetrahedron have the same volume.)

The tetrahedron is unique among the uniform polyhedra in possessing no parallel faces.

===A law of sines for tetrahedra and the space of all shapes of tetrahedra===


A corollary of the usual law of sines is that in a tetrahedron with vertices &quot;O&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, we have
:formula_76

One may view the two sides of this identity as corresponding to clockwise and counterclockwise orientations of the surface.

Putting any of the four vertices in the role of &quot;O&quot; yields four such identities, but at most three of them are independent: If the &quot;clockwise&quot; sides of three of them are multiplied and the product is inferred to be equal to the product of the &quot;counterclockwise&quot; sides of the same three identities, and then common factors are cancelled from both sides, the result is the fourth identity.

Three angles are the angles of some triangle if and only if their sum is 180° (π radians). What condition on 12 angles is necessary and sufficient for them to be the 12 angles of some tetrahedron? Clearly the sum of the angles of any side of the tetrahedron must be 180°. Since there are four such triangles, there are four such constraints on sums of angles, and the number of degrees of freedom is thereby reduced from 12 to 8. The four relations given by this sine law further reduce the number of degrees of freedom, from 8 down to not 4 but 5, since the fourth constraint is not independent of the first three. Thus the space of all shapes of tetrahedra is 5-dimensional.

=== Law of cosines for tetrahedra ===
Let formula_77, formula_78, formula_79, formula_80 be the points of a tetrahedron. Let formula_81 be the area of the face opposite vertex formula_82 and let formula_83 be the dihedral angle between the two faces of the tetrahedron adjacent to the edge formula_84. The law of cosines for a tetrahedron, which relates the areas of the faces of the tetrahedron to the dihedral angles about a vertex, is given by the following relation:
formula_85

=== Interior point ===
Let &quot;P&quot; be any interior point of a tetrahedron of volume &quot;V&quot; for which the vertices are &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;, and for which the areas of the opposite faces are &quot;F&quot;a, &quot;F&quot;b, &quot;F&quot;c, and &quot;F&quot;d. Then

:formula_86

For vertices &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;, interior point &quot;P&quot;, and feet &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, and &quot;M&quot; of the perpendiculars from &quot;P&quot; to the faces, and suppose the faces have equal areas, then

:formula_87

===Inradius===

Denoting the inradius of a tetrahedron as &quot;r&quot; and the inradii of its triangular faces as &quot;r&quot;&quot;i&quot; for &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, 3, 4, we have

:formula_88

with equality if and only if the tetrahedron is regular.

If &quot;A&quot;&quot;1&quot;, &quot;A&quot;&quot;2&quot;, &quot;A&quot;&quot;3&quot; and &quot;A&quot;&quot;4&quot; denote the area of each faces, the value of &quot;r&quot; is given by

:formula_89.

This formula is obtained from dividing the tetrahedron into four tetrahedra whose points are the three points of one of the original faces and the incenter. Since the four subtetrahedra fill the volume, we have formula_90.

===Circumradius===

Denote the circumradius of a tetrahedron as &quot;R&quot;. Let &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; be the lengths of the three edges that meet at a vertex, and &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; the length of the opposite edges. Let &quot;V&quot; be the volume of the tetrahedron. Then

:formula_91

===Circumcenter===
The circumcenter of a tetrahedron can be found as intersection of three bisector planes. A bisector plane is defined as the plane centered on, and orthogonal to an edge of the tetrahedron.
With this definition, the circumcenter of a tetrahedron with vertices ,, can be formulated as matrix-vector product:
:formula_92
In contrast to the centroid, the circumcenter may not always lay on the inside of a tetrahedron.
Analogously to an obtuse triangle, the circumcenter is outside of the object for an obtuse tetrahedron.

===Centroid===
The tetrahedron&#x27;s center of mass can be computed as the arithmetic mean of its four vertices, see Centroid.

===Faces===

The sum of the areas of any three faces is greater than the area of the fourth face.

==Integer tetrahedra==

There exist tetrahedra having integer-valued edge lengths, face areas and volume. These are called Heronian tetrahedra. One example has one edge of 896, the opposite edge of 990 and the other four edges of 1073; two faces are isosceles triangles with areas of and the other two are isosceles with areas of , while the volume is .

A tetrahedron can have integer volume and consecutive integers as edges, an example being the one with edges 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 and volume 48.

==Related polyhedra and compounds==
A regular tetrahedron can be seen as a triangular pyramid.
A regular tetrahedron can be seen as a degenerate polyhedron, a uniform &quot;digonal antiprism&quot;, where base polygons are reduced digons.
A regular tetrahedron can be seen as a degenerate polyhedron, a uniform dual &quot;digonal trapezohedron&quot;, containing 6 vertices, in two sets of colinear edges.
A truncation process applied to the tetrahedron produces a series of uniform polyhedra. Truncating edges down to points produces the octahedron as a rectified tetrahedron. The process completes as a birectification, reducing the original faces down to points, and producing the self-dual tetrahedron once again.
This polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of regular polyhedra with Schläfli symbols {3,&quot;n&quot;}, continuing into the hyperbolic plane.
The tetrahedron is topologically related to a series of regular polyhedra and tilings with order-3 vertex figures.


An interesting polyhedron can be constructed from five intersecting tetrahedra. This compound of five tetrahedra has been known for hundreds of years. It comes up regularly in the world of origami. Joining the twenty vertices would form a regular dodecahedron. There are both left-handed and right-handed forms, which are mirror images of each other. Superimposing both forms gives a compound of ten tetrahedra, in which the ten tetrahedra are arranged as five pairs of stellae octangulae. A stella octangula is a compound of two tetrahedra in dual position and its eight vertices define a cube as their convex hull.

The square hosohedron is another polyhedron with four faces, but it does not have triangular faces.

The Szilassi polyhedron and the tetrahedron are the only two known polyhedra in which each face shares an edge with each other face. Furthermore, the Császár polyhedron (itself is the dual of Szilassi polyhedron) and the tetrahedron are the only two known polyhedra in which every diagonal lies on the sides.

==Applications==

===Numerical analysis===

In numerical analysis, complicated three-dimensional shapes are commonly broken down into, or approximated by, a polygonal mesh of irregular tetrahedra in the process of setting up the equations for finite element analysis especially in the numerical solution of partial differential equations. These methods have wide applications in practical applications in computational fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, electromagnetic fields, civil engineering, chemical engineering, naval architecture and engineering, and related fields.

===Structural engineering===
A tetrahedron having stiff edges is inherently rigid. For this reason it is often used to stiffen frame structures such as spaceframes.

===Fortification===
Tetrahedrons are used in caltrops to provide an area denial weapon. This is due to their nature of having a sharp corner that always points upwards.

Large concrete tetrahedrons have been used as anti-tank measures, or as Tetrapods to break down waves at coastlines.

===Aviation===
At some airfields, a large frame in the shape of a tetrahedron with two sides covered with a thin material is mounted on a rotating pivot and always points into the wind. It is built big enough to be seen from the air and is sometimes illuminated. Its purpose is to serve as a reference to pilots indicating wind direction.

===Chemistry===

The tetrahedron shape is seen in nature in covalently bonded molecules. All sp3-hybridized atoms are surrounded by atoms (or lone electron pairs) at the four corners of a tetrahedron. For instance in a methane molecule () or an ammonium ion (), four hydrogen atoms surround a central carbon or nitrogen atom with tetrahedral symmetry. For this reason, one of the leading journals in organic chemistry is called &quot;Tetrahedron&quot;. The central angle between any two vertices of a perfect tetrahedron is arccos(−), or approximately 109.47°.

Water, , also has a tetrahedral structure, with two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs of electrons around the central oxygen atoms. Its tetrahedral symmetry is not perfect, however, because the lone pairs repel more than the single O–H bonds.

Quaternary phase diagrams of mixtures of chemical substances are represented graphically as tetrahedra.

However, quaternary phase diagrams in communication engineering are represented graphically on a two-dimensional plane.

There are molecules with the shape based on four nearby atoms whose bonds form the sides of a tetrahedral structure, such as white phosphorus allotrope and tetra-&quot;t&quot;-butyltetrahedrane, known derivative of the hypothetical tetrahedrane.

===Electricity and electronics===

If six equal resistors are soldered together to form a tetrahedron, then the resistance measured between any two vertices is half that of one resistor.

Since silicon is the most common semiconductor used in solid-state electronics, and silicon has a valence of four, the tetrahedral shape of the four chemical bonds in silicon is a strong influence on how crystals of silicon form and what shapes they assume.

===Color space===

Tetrahedra are used in color space conversion algorithms specifically for cases in which the luminance axis diagonally segments the color space (e.g. RGB, CMY).

===Games===

The Royal Game of Ur, dating from 2600 BC, was played with a set of tetrahedral dice.

Especially in roleplaying, this solid is known as a 4-sided die, one of the more common polyhedral dice, with the number rolled appearing around the bottom or on the top vertex. Some Rubik&#x27;s Cube-like puzzles are tetrahedral, such as the Pyraminx and Pyramorphix.

===Geology===

The tetrahedral hypothesis, originally published by William Lowthian Green to explain the formation of the Earth, was popular through the early 20th century.

===Popular culture===

Stanley Kubrick originally intended the monolith in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; to be a tetrahedron, according to Marvin Minsky, a cognitive scientist and expert on artificial intelligence who advised Kubrick on the HAL 9000 computer and other aspects of the movie. Kubrick scrapped the idea of using the tetrahedron as a visitor who saw footage of it did not recognize what it was and he did not want anything in the movie regular people did not understand.

The tetrahedron with regular faces is a solution to an old puzzle asking to form four equilateral triangles using six unbroken matchsticks. The solution places the matchsticks along the edges of a tetrahedron.

==Tetrahedral graph==

The skeleton of the tetrahedron (comprising the vertices and edges) forms a graph, with 4 vertices, and 6 edges. It is a special case of the complete graph, K4, and wheel graph, W4. It is one of 5 Platonic graphs, each a skeleton of its Platonic solid.

<text>Track cycling is a bicycle racing sport usually held on specially built banked tracks or velodromes using purpose-designed track bicycles.

==History==

Track cycling has been around since at least 1870. When track cycling was in its infancy, it was held on velodromes similar to the ones used today. These velodromes consisted of two straights and slightly banked turns, though they varied more in length and material than the modern 250 m track.

One appeal of indoor track racing was that spectators could be easily controlled, and hence an entrance fee could be charged, making track racing a lucrative sport. Early track races attracted crowds of up to 2,000 people. Indoor tracks also enabled year-round cycling for the first time. The main early centers for track racing in Britain were Birmingham, Sheffield, Liverpool, Manchester and London.

The most noticeable changes in over a century of track cycling have concerned the bikes themselves, engineered to be lighter and more aerodynamic to enable ever-faster times.

Track cycling has been featured in every modern Olympic Games except the 1912 Games. Women&#x27;s track cycling events were first included in the modern Olympics in 1988. The sport was moved indoors since 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, mainly because of the hot weather.

Along the decades, track lengths have been gradually reduced. Early velodromes varied in length between 130 and 500 metres long. By the 1960s to 1989, a standard length of length was commonly used for international competitions. Since 1990, international velodromes are built with a length of , though tracks of many lengths are still in use.

==Main centres==
Track cycling is particularly popular in Europe, notably Belgium, France, Germany and the United Kingdom where it is often used as off-season training by road racers who can frequently be seen at professional six-day events (races entered by two-rider teams.)

In the United States, track racing reached a peak of popularity in the 1930s when six-day races were held in Madison Square Garden in New York. The word &quot;Madison&quot; is still used as the name for a type of race.

In Japan, the keirin race format is a very popular betting sport. The sport is well-regarded, and riders are extensively trained through the Japanese Keirin School.

==Race formats==

Track cycling events fit into two broad categories: sprint races and endurance races. Riders will typically fall into one category and not compete in the other.

===Bicycles===

The bicycles used are optimized for track racing; they are fixed-gear bicycles without freewheel or brakes, with narrow tires inflated to high pressure. Frame and other components are designed for rigidity and lightness, to give maximum speed over the distance of the race (sprint or longer).

=== Sprint ===

Sprint races are generally between 3 and 8 laps in length and focus on raw sprinting power and race tactics over a small number of laps to defeat opponents. Sprint riders train specifically to compete in races of this length, and do not generally compete in endurance events.

The main sprint events are:

*Sprint
*Team sprint
*Keirin
*Track time trial
=== Endurance ===
Endurance races are held over longer distances. These races test the riders&#x27; endurance capacity, as well as tactics and speed. The length of track endurance events varies by race type, whether it is a part of the Omnium or not, and the gender of the competitors. Many track endurance riders also compete in road cycling events.

The main endurance events are:

*Individual pursuit
*Team pursuit
*Scratch race
*Points race
*Madison
*Omnium
== Major competitive events ==

=== Olympic Games ===

There were six events in track cycling at the Olympics in 2024: team sprint, match sprint, keirin, omnium, team pursuit, and Madison. The Madison was added in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics held in 2021; the other races had been held in previous Games. There are separate races of each type for men and women; until the 2012 Summer Olympics there were fewer events for women.

=== World Championships ===

The UCI Track Cycling World Championships are held every year, usually in March or April at the end of the winter track season. There are currently (2024) 22 events in the World Championships, 11 for men and 11 for women. Qualification places are determined by different countries performance during the World Cup Classic series held through the season.

=== World Cup ===

The UCI Track Cycling World Cup series consists of six meetings, held in different countries beginning annually in October, and finishing in January. These meetings include 17 of the 19 events (excluding the omnium for men and women) that take place in a World Championship over three days.

Events won and points scored by the riders throughout this series count towards qualification places individually and for their nation in the World Championships at the end of the season. The overall leader in each event may wear a white points leaders jersey at each race, with the overall winner at the end of the season may keep the jersey and wear it at the World Championships. Riders compete for either national teams or trade teams, though the future of trade teams is unknown after controversial decisions by the UCI to eliminate World Cup events, and replace them with Nation&#x27;s Cup events.

=== Ranking ===

The UCI Track Cycling World Ranking is based upon the results in all UCI-sanctioned races over a twelve-month period. The ranking includes an individual and a nations ranking and includes the disciplines: individual pursuit, points race, scratch, sprint, time trial, keirin, omnium, team pursuit, team sprint and madison.

== Gender in track cycling ==
Women&#x27;s track cycling was only introduced as an Olympic sport in 1988, and women were not permitted to compete in the same number of events as men until 2012. Though men and women currently compete in the same number of events, there are still significant differences between men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s races of the same type. For example, in the team sprint, men race three riders over three laps, whereas women race two riders over two laps, and men&#x27;s individual pursuit is a 4 km race and women only race 3 km. It is also the case that women race shorter distances than men in mass start events such as stand-alone scratch and points races, and omnium events.

In many cycling sports, women raced shorter distances, are paid less, and receive less air-time. It was not until 2018 that the UCI mandated minimum wages for women&#x27;s cycling at all. It is unclear how this will impact female track cyclists, as track cycling is generally not an athlete&#x27;s primary source of income (rather they are road cyclists selected for specific events by their national team). There is no talk of changing race distances to create gender parity in time for the 2020 Olympics.

In 2018, Veronica Ivy (then known as Rachel McKinnon) became the first transgender World Champion in any sport, with a victory in the Masters Women Age 35-44 age category. In 2019, Ivy became a repeat champion in the same discipline. Though met with some criticism, Ivy holds her title as transgender athletes are permitted to compete as per the International Olympic Committee.

==Riding position==
Aerodynamic drag is a significant factor in both road and track racing. Frames are often constructed of moulded carbon fiber, for a lightweight design. More recently, track bikes have employed airfoil designs on the tubes of the frame to reduce aerodynamic drag.

Given the importance of aerodynamics, the riders&#x27; sitting position becomes extremely important. The riding position is similar to the road racing position, but is ultimately dependent on the frame geometry of the bicycle and the handlebars used. Handlebars on track bikes used for longer events such as the points race are similar to the drop bars found on road bicycles. However, in the sprint event the rider&#x27;s position is more extreme compared with a road rider. The bars are lower and the saddle is higher and more forward. Bars are often narrower with a deeper drop. Carbon fiber bars of many shapes, as opposed to lighter alloys, are used by many riders for their higher stiffness and durability.

In timed events such as the pursuit and the time trial, riders often use aerobars or &#x27;triathlon bars&#x27; similar to those found on road time trial bicycles, allowing the rider to position the arms closer together in front of the body. This results in a more horizontal back and presents the minimum frontal area to reduce drag. Aerobars can be separate bars that are attached to time trial or bull horn bars, or they can be part of a one-piece monocoque design. Use of aerobars is permitted only in pursuit and time trial events.

Formats of track cycle races are also heavily influenced by aerodynamics. If one rider closely follows, they draft or slipstream another, because the leading rider pushes air around themselves; any rider closely following has to push out less air than the lead rider and thus can travel at the same speed while expending less effort. This fact has led to a variety of racing styles that allow skilled riders or teams to exploit this tactical advantage, as well as formats that simply test strength, speed and endurance.

During the early 1990s in individual pursuit events, some riders, including Graeme Obree, adopted a straight-armed &quot;Superman&quot;-like position with their arms fully extended horizontally, but this position was subsequently outlawed by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the sport&#x27;s ruling body.

== Records ==
In addition to regular track racing, tracks are also the venue for many speed records. These are over either a fixed distance or for a fixed period of time. Generally, time trial events (200 m, 500 m, 1 km, and Individual Pursuit) will be recorded for both gender categories as well as several age categories on each track, for each nation, and for the world.

One of the most heavily contested records is the hour record, which involves simply riding as far as possible in one hour.

The history of the hour record has been attempted by some of the greatest names in cycling from both road and track racing (including, among others, Major Taylor, Henri Desgrange, Fausto Coppi, Anna Wilson, Eddy Merckx, Francesco Moser, Jeannie Longo and Tony Rominger).

Attempts are generally made at velodromes with a reputation for being fast. Recently, these have mostly been at high-altitude locations, such as Mexico City, Mexico or Aguascalientes, Mexico, where the thinner air results in lower aerodynamic drag, offsetting the added difficulty of breathing. Innovations in equipment and the rider&#x27;s position on the bike have also led to dramatic improvements in the hour record, but have also been a source of controversy (see Graeme Obree).

In 2019, the Pan Am Championships held at the newly built velodrome in Cochabamba, Bolivia, Kelsey Mitchell and Nicholas Paul broke the 200 m world records in their respective gender categories. The track proved fast for many other events, with Pan Am records being set in nearly all timed events.

<text>The individual pursuit is a track cycling event where two cyclists begin the race from a stationary position on opposite sides of the track. 
It is held at over for men and women. The riders start at the same time and set off to complete the race distance in the fastest time. They ride on the pursuit line at the bottom of the track to find the fastest line, with each rider trying to catch the other who started on the other side. If the catch is achieved, the successful pursuer is the winner. However, they can continue the rest of the race distance to set the fastest time in a qualifying race or a record in a final.

==Qualification and race format==

The first round of the competition at major events is the qualifying round. This still involves two riders on the track at the same time but they are not directly competing against each other but attempting to set the fastest time to progress in the competition. In the Olympic Games the top riders progress into knock out rounds, with the top two surviving into the Gold and Silver medal race and next two into the Bronze Medal race. In the World Championships or World Cup Classic events, the top two riders from the qualifying round progress directly to the Gold and Silver medal race while the third and fourth qualifiers fight it out for Bronze.

, the IOC &quot;approved a UCI recommendation to restructure track events at the 2012 Games in London, including the abandonment of individual pursuit events.&quot;

==Notable individual pursuiters==

===Men===
The last men&#x27;s Olympic champion in this event was Great Britain&#x27;s Bradley Wiggins. , the men&#x27;s world champion is Italy&#x27;s Jonathan Milan.

<text>The team pursuit is a track cycling event similar to the individual pursuit, except that two teams, each of up to four riders, compete, starting on opposite sides of the velodrome.

== Race format ==
Both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s events are competed over a distance of 4 km, by a team of 4 riders. Prior to the start of the 2012–13 season the women&#x27;s event was competed over a distance of 3 km, by a team of 3 riders.

As with the individual pursuit, the objective is to cover the distance in the fastest time or to catch and overtake the other team in a final. Riders in a team follow each other closely in line, drafting to minimize total drag, and periodically the lead rider (who works the hardest) peels off the front, swings up the track banking and rejoins the team at the rear. The position of the third rider is pivotal because final times are measured as the third team member&#x27;s front wheel crosses the finishing line. Since the winning team is decided by the third rider, it is common for one rider to take a &quot;death pull&quot;, pedaling very hard before the finish to tow the teammates, which means that this rider cannot maintain the group-pace afterwards. This allows their teammates to briefly recover behind them before they make a final three-person acceleration towards the finish line.

=== Qualifying ===
The first round of the competition at major events is the qualifying round. This still involves two teams on the track at the same time: they are not directly competing against each other but attempting to set the fastest time to progress in the competition. In the Olympic Games since 2012, the top teams progress into knock-out rounds, with the top two surviving into the gold- and silver-medal race and the top two teams from all remaining compete in the bronze-medal race. Prior to 2012, the two losers of the knock-out rounds would race for the bronze medal; this change was instituted to encourage performance from all qualifying teams since all would have a chance to race for a medal depending on their performance. In the World Championships or World Cup Classic events the top two teams from the qualifying round progress directly to the gold- and silver-medal race while the third and fourth qualifiers compete for bronze.

<text>The track time trial is a track cycling event where cyclists compete individually against the clock to record the fastest time over the specified distance from a standing start.

==Time trial bikes==
Track time trial bikes differ from normal track bikes in two major ways; firstly they have disc or 3–5 spoked wheels, and secondly they often use aero-bars to allow the rider to adopt a more aerodynamic riding position. The frames are often more streamlined to reduce air resistance.

== Men – 1000 m time trial ==
At the UCI Track World Championships, the distance for senior men is 1000 m, hence the event&#x27;s alternative name, the &#x27;Kilo&#x27;, short for kilometre. Junior men also race 1000 m. Being such a short, high-intensity event, the kilo is popular with riders who specialise in the sprint. The Kilo time trial was removed from the Olympics programme after 2004 to make way for BMX racing. This led to a number of Kilo riders, most notably Chris Hoy, to begin focusing on other sprint events.

This event is a race against the clock from a standing start over 1000 m. Most indoor tracks are 250 m in length, so a kilo is usually held over four laps. Other common track lengths are 167 m (six laps), 333 m (three laps) or 400 m (2.5 laps). Riders will keep to the black line at the bottom of the track to ensure they have to cover the least distance over the 1000 m. Riders usually only get one attempt to set a time, and the winner of the event is simply the rider to post the quickest time.

A fast time at the elite level is around 1 minute 5 seconds.

The world record is 55.433 seconds (64.943 km/h), set by Jeffrey Hoogland in 2023 at the Aguascalientes Velodrome in Aguascalientes, Mexico.

== Women – 500 m time trial ==
The Women&#x27;s version of the event is held over 500 m. Other than the race distance this is the same as the men&#x27;s Kilo event, with the fastest rider over the distance declared the winner. This event was also removed from the Olympic programme after 2004 to make way for BMX.

The world record is held by Russian rider Anastasia Voynova; set on 17 October 2015 in Grenchen, Switzerland during the European championships with 32.794 seconds (54.888 km/h).

==Flying 200 m time trial==
The flying 200 m time trial (so-called because riders have a flying start, as opposed to the standing start in the kilo/500 m) is rarely held on its own. It is more commonly used as the qualifying event for the sprint competition, or as part of an Omnium competition. Velodromes have a line painted across the track at 200 m before the finish line, for this purpose. Therefore, the size the track will determine where the 200-meter line is (for 250 m tracks, it is about two-thirds of the way through the first bend; for 200-meter tracks, it is the finish line; for 400-meter tracks, it is the start line in the back straight). The clock will start as they cross this line and stop when they reach the finish line.

Depending on the size of the track, riders have between one and three laps to build up speed before the clock starts. They will ride around the very top of the track as they near the start line, then drop down to the bottom to gain as much speed as possible from rolling down the steep inclined banking. The Flying 200 m is ridden on a standard track bike (drop handlebars, spoked front wheel) when it is part of the Sprint competition, and often during the Omnium as well so riders need have only one bike. Disc front wheel is permitted for sprint qualification round. UCI rules and regulations Article 1.3.018

A fast time at the elite level is just above 10 seconds for men, 11 seconds for women.

The world record of 9.100 seconds was set by Nicholas Paul of Trinidad and Tobago at the Elite Pan American Track Cycling Championships in Cochabamba, Bolivia on September 6, 2019.

The Olympic Record of 9.551 seconds was set by Jason Kenny of Great Britain at the Rio 2016 Olympics, beating his own Olympic Record of 9.713 seconds set at the 2012 London Olympics.

<doc id="30616" wikidata="Q2597988" url="?curid=30616" title="Points race">
<text>A points race is a mass start track cycling event involving large numbers of riders simultaneously on track. It was an Olympic event for men from 1984 to 2008 and for women from 1996 to 2008. Since 2012, the points race has been one of the omnium events in the Olympics.

==Description ==
The races are run over 40 km for men and 25 km for women in UCI championships. A sprint is held every ten laps, with 5, 3, 2, and 1 point(s) being awarded to the top four finishers in each sprint. The winner of the race is the one to have the most points at the end of the race. In addition to the sprints, any riders managing to lap the main field are awarded an extra 20 points. This is therefore a popular way of gaining the points required to win the race and leads to many such attempts to gain a lap during the race.

Different tactics can be employed to win the race. Some riders may sit back in the main bunch conserving energy, only attacking for the sprints to gain points. Other riders may attempt to gain the lead early on in the race and try to defend the advantage. The most common breakaways seen in the points race are groups of two to five riders, sharing the work to enable them to gain a lap. Although it is a difficult feat to gain the lap on your own, it is not uncommon for the top riders to be able to do this in order to win the race.

At the Olympic Games and World Championships qualification is determined by performance at the World Cup Classics events throughout the season. At the World Cup Classics meetings two heats usually take place to decide qualification for the final. These are commonly half the race distance of the final.

==Variations==

===The Snowball===

The snowball is a variation on the points race where every sprint, only the first-place finisher is awarded any points. The number of points awarded increases with each sprint: the first sprint gives one point, the second gives two points, the third gives three points, etc. The sprints are also more frequent than in the normal points race, and can happen every lap or every two laps. In the case of a tie, the order of the final sprint is used to break the tie.

===Point-a-Lap or Course Des Primes===

The point-a-lap (course de primes), as its name would imply, a variation on the points race where a single point is awarded to the first rider to finish each lap. Typically more points are awarded on the final lap, going several riders deep.

===Tempo===

The tempo race is the second event of the new Omnium format. It lasts 7.5 km (30 laps on a 250-m-track) for women and 10 km (40 laps on a 250-m-track) for men. During this race one point is awarded to the first rider each lap from the end of the fifth lap. If a rider gains a lap, they score 20 points; if a rider loses a lap, they lose 20 points.

<text>The Madison is a relay race event in track cycling, named after the first Madison Square Garden in New York, and known as the &quot;American race&quot; in French (&quot;course à l&#x27;américaine&quot;) and as &quot;Americana&quot; in Spanish and in Italian.

==The race==
The Madison is a race in which the team which completes the most laps wins. Tied positions are split by points awarded for placings at a series of sprints at intervals during the race. Teams usually have two riders but occasionally three. Riders in each team take turns, with only one rider per team racing at any time. After resting, riders can return to the race. To take over, the replacement rider has to be touched, pushed, often on the shorts, or hurled by the departing team member by a hand-sling.

How long each rider stays in the race is for the rider&#x27;s team to decide. Originally, riders took stints of several hours and the resting rider could sleep or have a meal. That was easier in earlier six-day races because hours could pass without riders attempting to break away from the others. As races became more intensive, both riders from a team began riding simultaneously, one going fast on the shortest racing line around the base of the track and the other idling higher up until that rider&#x27;s turn to take over. Modern six-day races last less than 12 hours a day and the Madison is now only a featured part, so staying on the track throughout is more feasible.

The Madison is a feature of six-day races, but it can also be a separate race, as in the Olympic Games. It has its own championships and specialist riders. UCI-sanctioned Madison races have a total distance of .

==History==
The Madison began as a way of circumventing laws passed in New York in the US, aimed at restricting the exhaustion of cyclists taking part in six-day races.

According to a contemporary newspaper clipping retained by Major Taylor:

The riders are becoming peevish and fretful. The wear and tear upon their nerves and their muscles, and the loss of sleep make them so. If their desires are not met with on the moment, they break forth with a stream of abuse. Nothing pleases them. These outbreaks do not trouble the trainers with experience, for they understand the condition the men are in.

The condition included delusions and hallucinations. Riders wobbled and frequently fell. But the riders were often well paid, especially since more people came to watch them as their condition worsened. Promoters in New York paid Teddy Hale $5,000 when he won in 1896 and he won &quot;like a ghost, his face as white as a corpse, his eyes no longer visible because they&#x27;d retreated into his skull,&quot; as one report had it.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; said in 1897:

An athletic contest in which participants &quot;go queer&quot; in their heads, and strain their powers until their faces become hideous with the tortures that rack them, is not sport. It is brutality. Days and weeks of recuperation will be needed to put the Garden racers in condition, and it is likely that some of them will never recover from the strain.

Alarmed, New York and Illinois ruled in 1898 that no competitor could race for more than 12 hours a day. The promoter of the event at Madison Square Garden, reluctant to close his stadium for half the day, realized that giving each rider a partner with whom he could share the racing meant the race could still go on 24 hours a day but that no one rider would exceed the 12-hour limit. Speeds rose, distances grew, crowds increased, money poured in. Where Charlie Miller rode alone, the Australian Alf Goullet and a decent partner could ride .

The fastest known average speed of a Madison men&#x27;s race is , achieved by the Australian duo of Sam Welsford and Leigh Howard, at the world cup race in Glasgow, United Kingdom, 9 November 2019.

===Origins of the name Madison Racing===

The term &quot;Madison Racing&quot; derives essentially from a sequence of local New York City names honoring President James Madison. A lodge had been built at what was then the prominent and northernmost waypoint into and out of New York City. In honor of the recently deceased president, the cottage was named Madison Cottage. After the demise of Madison cottage, the site gave rise to a park, in turn named Madison Square, which remains today.
A series of four sports venues subsequently took their names from Madison Square — each named, one after the other, &quot;Madison Square Gardens. &quot; The first two were located directly adjacent to (and took their name from) Madison Square. The second &quot;Madison Square Gardens&quot; (1890–1925) became a prominent cycling venue, and gave rise to the track cycle racing that ultimately carried the name &quot;Madison Racing.&quot;

==The full rules==

The official rules of the Madison, which are traditionally regarded as being hard to follow, are stated as follows by British Cycling, the British Governing Body of Cycling:

* Teams shall be of two or three riders wearing the same colours and number: in the Olympics and World Championships, participants compete in pairs.
* There must be one rider of each team in the race at all times.
* Riders may relieve each other at any time during the race.
* Changing shall take place below the stayers line, and as near to the inside edge of the track as practicable.
* Relieved riders must take up a position outside the stayers line as soon as it is safe and practicable.
* Changing shall be by one rider drawing level with the other and touching to denote relief.
* The touch may be a push or handsling.
* The winners of the race shall be the team which gains the most laps on the other teams.
* If two or more teams are on the same lap, the result shall be determined by the team which has won the most sprint points during the race.
* Should there be an equality of laps and points, the winners shall be the best placed team in the final sprint.
* The race shall end when the leading team has completed the distance.
* Lapped riders need not fulfill lost laps, and shall be placed as so many laps behind the winners.
* At pre-determined times during the race there will be sprints for points, with the first four teams over the line gaining 5, 3, 2 and 1 points respectively.
* A whistle shall be blown to indicate one lap to go before a sprint.
* A bell will be rung at the start of the last lap.
* Teams that rejoin the field after gaining or losing laps, shall be eligible for sprint points.
* Should one member of a team suffer a puncture or mishap, that rider will be allowed to rejoin the race. However, his/her partner should rejoin the race within two laps being covered by the field from the point at which the incident occurred. The Chief Commissaire will pair the rider in the race with another team which is at the same relative position in the race. The rider will ride &#x27;in and out&#x27; with the nominated member of the other team until his/her partner rejoins the race.
* Any team retiring from the race shall inform the Chief Commissaire immediately.
* Teams may be disciplined by losing points, losing laps or disqualification for misconduct, unfair and/or dangerous riding.
* The Chief Commissaire may neutralise a race should it be considered necessary to do so (i.e. in the case of a crash involving several teams or the track becoming unsafe and/or impracticable for use).
* The Chief Commissaire may terminate a race before the full distance should it be considered essential to do so.
* The Chief Commissaire may withdraw teams who fall too many laps behind or who, in their opinion, may constitute a danger to other riders.

The Madison was an Olympic event for men in 2000, 2004 and 2008, but was dropped ahead of the 2012 London Olympics, in part for reasons of gender equality as there was no equivalent race for women at that time.

In June 2017, the International Olympic Committee announced that the Madison would be added to the Olympic programme for the 2020 Summer Olympics. The 2020 Games includes a relaunch of the men&#x27;s Madison event, as well as the introduction of the women&#x27;s Madison as an Olympic event for the first time. The inaugural women&#x27;s event was won by Katie Archibald and Laura Kenny for Team GB.

<text>The sprint or match sprint is a track cycling event involving between two and four riders, though it is usually run as a one-on-one match race between opponents who, unlike in the individual pursuit, start next to each other. Men&#x27;s sprint has been an Olympic event at every games except 1904 (which had races at seven different distances) and 1912 (which had no track cycling events). Women&#x27;s sprints have been contested at every Olympics since 1988.

==Racing style==
Depending on the size of the velodrome, this event can be from 250 m to 1000 m. Unlike the sprints in athletics, these events do not usually start with riders sprinting from the starting line and they are not confined to lanes. The early parts of each race will often be highly tactical with riders pedalling slowly, as they carefully jockey for position, often trying to force their opponents up high on the track in an attempt to get their rivals to make the first move. Some even bring their bicycles to a complete stop, balanced upright with both feet still on the pedals and both hands on the handle bars (a track stand), in an attempt to make the other rider take the lead. Track stands can only be held for a certain time and it is not permissible to go backwards in a track stand by rocking backwards and forwards as the judge will be following the track stand from the bottom of the track. The reason for this behaviour, as in many track cycling events, is both aerodynamics and tactics.

When racing at high speed, the rider who manages to stay just behind their opponent can draft, expending less effort. By riding behind the &#x27;lead out&#x27; rider, the second rider reduces the aerodynamic drag felt. Just before the finish, the trailing rider pulls out of the slipstream, and aided by fresher legs, may be able to overtake the opponent before the line. To prevent this, the leading rider may choose to accelerate quickly before the last lap, hoping to catch their opponent off guard and establish a large enough gap to negate the aerodynamic effect or to keep the speed high enough to prevent their opponent from completing a pass.

During the race, the &quot;lead out&quot; rider may choose to hug the measurement line on the inside of the track giving them the shortest path around the track. Likewise, they may choose to hug the sprinter&#x27;s line (a red line 85 cm up track) to force their opponent to come higher over the top of them. The sprinter&#x27;s line defines the sprinter&#x27;s lane; once the sprint is initiated riders may not drop into the sprinter&#x27;s lane or cross out of the lane unless they have a clear lead over their opponent.

==Rules==
As defined by Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) rules, the first round of competition used to qualify for the sprint competition is the flying 200 m time trial. In this round each rider completes two to three warm up laps and then completes the final 200 m, which is usually just under a lap. The number of riders that qualify for the sprint rounds depends on the competition; in World Cup competitions, 16 riders will advance and in a world championship, 24 riders will advance. The top riders are seeded in the following rounds, meaning the fastest qualifier will face the slowest qualifier and so on. Knock-out rounds then proceed, initially on a one race basis and then on a best-of three-race format from the quarter-final stage. Riders defeated in the earlier rounds may get a chance to continue in the competition through the repechage races.

The Netherlands and Canada currently hold two of the major titles in this event. Harrie Lavreysen is Olympic men&#x27;s sprint champion, and Ellesse Andrews is the Olympic women&#x27;s sprint champion.

==Variants==
===Keirin===

The Keirin is a variant of the sprint in which a higher number (usually 6–8, or 9 in Japan) of sprinters compete in a very different format. Riders are paced in the early laps by (and are required to stay behind) a Derny motorcycle, which slowly increases the speed of the race from 25 km/h to about 50 km/h. It then leaves the track with about 600–700 m remaining. The first rider across the finish line in the high-speed (sometimes 70 km/h) finish is the winner.

===Team sprint===
The men&#x27;s team sprint (also known as the Olympic sprint) is a short distance three-man team pursuit held over three laps of a velodrome. Like the (much longer) team pursuit event, two teams race against each other, starting on opposite sides of the track, but at the end of the first lap, the leading rider in each team drops out of the race by riding up the banking leaving the second rider to lead for the second lap; at the end of the second lap, the second rider does the same, leaving the third rider to complete the last lap on his own. In the women&#x27;s event, teams of two compete over a two-lap distance. The team sprint has been an Olympic event for men since 2000 and for women since 2012.

===Chariot===
The chariot is a short, usually one lap, race. Depending on track size, between four and eight cyclists start from a standing start, and do an all out sprint for one lap. The first rider across the finish line is the winner.</text><links>

<doc id="30619" wikidata="Q774176" url="?curid=30619" title="Keirin">
<text>– literally &quot;racing cycle&quot; – is a form of motor-paced cycle racing in which track cyclists sprint for victory following a speed-controlled start behind a motorized or non-motorized pacer. It was developed in Japan around 1948 for gambling purposes and became an official event at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
Riders use brakeless fixed-gear bicycles.
Races are typically long: 6 laps on a track, 4 laps on a track, or 4 laps on a track. Lots are drawn to determine starting positions for the sprint riders behind the pacer, which is usually a motorcycle, but can be a derny, electric bicycle or tandem bicycle. Riders must remain behind the pacer for 3 laps on a track. The pacer starts at , gradually increasing to by its final circuit. The pacer leaves the track before the end of the race (3 laps on a track). The winner&#x27;s finishing speed can exceed .

Competition keirin races are conducted over several rounds with one final. Some eliminated cyclists can try again in the repechages.

==World championships==

Keirin, in its modified form, has been a UCI men&#x27;s World Championship event since 1980 and a UCI women&#x27;s World Championship event since 2002. Danny Clark of Australia and Li Na of China were the first UCI world champions. The 2019 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s world champions are Matthijs Büchli of Netherlands and Lee Wai Sze of Hong Kong.

==Olympics==
Keirin made its debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney as a men&#x27;s event, after being admitted into the Olympics in December 1996. The women&#x27;s event was added for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

A BBC News investigation, reported in July 2008, found evidence that following admission into the Olympics, the Union Cycliste Internationale required (in writing) the Japan Keirin Association to support UCI projects in &quot;material terms&quot;; over a period of time the association subsequently gave US$3 million to UCI in consideration of &quot;the excellent relationship the UCI has with representatives of the Olympic movement&quot;. The UCI and its then-president, Hein Verbruggen, denied any wrongdoing.

At the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, the Men&#x27;s keirin took place on 7 and 8 August 2021, with 30 cyclists from 18 nations competing, and the gold medal going to Jason Kenny from Great Britain. The Women&#x27;s keirin took place on 4 and 5 August 2021, with 29 cyclists from 18 nations competing, and the gold medal going to Shanne Braspennincx from The Netherlands.

==Keirin in Japan ==

Track cycling began as one of four allowed betting sports in Japan in 1948, and has since become very popular there. In 1957, the Nihon Jitensha Shinkōkai (NJS; Japan Bicycle Association) was founded to establish a uniform system of standards for the sport in Japan. Today keirin racing is regulated by the JKA Foundation. In 2011, the sum of bets placed on keirin races exceeded ¥600 billion (approximately US$5 billion), and the number of attendees in the races was approximately 4.9 million people.

Aspiring professional keirin riders in Japan compete for entrance into the Japan Keirin School. The 10 percent of applicants who are accepted then undergo a strict 15-hours-per-day training regimen. Those who pass final examination must still be approved by the Japan Keirin Association before being allowed to compete.

Japanese races for women were reintroduced in July 2012, under the title of &quot;Girls Keirin&quot; (ガールズケイリン). Women were previously permitted to participate from 1949 until 1964. Like the men, the women must also undergo a strict training regimen at the Keirin School.

===Champions from Japan===
 was one of the first Japanese keirin athletes to compete outside of his native country, Nakano holds the best matched sprint record as a track cyclist at the UCI Track World Championships with a record of ten consecutive professional Sprint World Track Cycling Championship wins from 1977 to 1986 against mostly western European pro track cyclists, although he never won the Keirin World Championship. At that time, many leading sprint riders were from the Eastern bloc countries and competed in separate &quot;amateur&quot; events.

Katsuaki Matsumoto (1928-2021) is the all-time professional keirin athlete with the most wins - 1341 - over his career (he retired in 1981 at the age of 53).

===Typical race===
Keirin races in Japan begin with the cyclists parading to the starting blocks, bowing as they enter the track and again as they position their bikes for the start of the race. Every participant is assigned a number and a colour for identification and betting purposes.

At the sound of the gun, the cyclists leave their starting blocks and settle into a position behind the pacer, who is another keirin bicyclist wearing purple with orange stripes. Cyclists initially settle into different groups, referred to as &quot;lines&quot;, where they try to work together with others to maximize their chance of winning.

As the pace quickens, the pacer will usually depart the track with between one and two laps remaining, though the actual location where the pacer leaves varies with every race. With laps remaining, officials begin sounding a bell or gong, increasing in frequency until the bicyclists come around to begin the final lap.

Keirin ovals are divided into specific areas: The two straightaways (homestretch and backstretch), the four turns (corners), and two locations called the &quot;centre&quot;, referring to the area between corners 1 and 2 (1 centre) and corners 3 and 4 (2 centre).

The race is monitored by referees. Two of the referees are stationed in towers along the backstretch (2nd and 3rd corners), while others review the homestretch area from a control room using closed-circuit cameras. Once the race has finished, a referee can signal a possible rule violation by illuminating a red light at the corner nearest to where the infraction may have occurred, or by waving a red flag. Judges then examine the video of the race and decide if a competitor committed a rules violation and should be disqualified. Once the order of finish is finalised, the race is declared official and the winning bets are paid.

===Ranks===
There are a total of six ranks that competitors can obtain in Japanese keirin racing. SS is the highest rank, followed by S1, S2, A1, A2 and A3. All new keirin graduates begin their careers with an A3 rank and work their way up by competing in keirin events.

The color of the shorts worn by each keirin competitor indicates rank. Those in A-class (A1, A2, A3) wear black shorts with a green stripe and white stars. S-class competitors (S1 and S2) wear a red stripe instead of a green stripe. Those in the elite SS class wear red shorts with a black stripe, white stars and special insignia. Introduced in 2007, the SS ranking is assigned by the NJS every December to the top nine Keirin athletes. These nine compete in that year&#x27;s Keirin Grand Prix and retain their rank until the following December.

===Distances===
The distance of each race depends on gender and rank. For men, distances for those ranked A3 are at 1,600 meters, while all others compete at 2,000 meters. The finals of some of the top graded events are run at a longer distance of 2,400 meters. The season-ending Keirin Grand Prix is held at 2,800 meters.

All events for women are currently run at 1,600 meters. There are usually small variances in distance based on the size of the track.

===Race grades===
A race meeting at any given keirin velodrome in Japan is assigned a grade. The highest graded events are GP, GI (G1), GII (G2) and GIII (G3), reserved only for S-class riders. Underneath those are FI (F1) events, which are open to both S-class and A-class riders. The lowest graded events, FII (F2), are reserved for A-class riders.

The GP grade designation is reserved for the Keirin Grand Prix, a three-day meet held at the end of December for the year&#x27;s top keirin competitors. The meet ultimately concludes with the Grand Prix race itself, which determines the annual Keirin racing champion.

As of 2018, a selection committee determines the competitors for the Grand Prix race using the following priority:

* Winners of each of the six GI events during the year,
* Japanese medal winners of individual cycling events during the Summer Olympic Games, or in non-Olympic years, the UCI Track Cycling World Championships,
* Competitors specifically recognized by the selection committee, and
* Competitors that have earned the most prize money from Keirin events during the year.

Also part of the Grand Prix meet is the Young Grand Prix, which is open to the best of those that have begun competing in Keirin within the last three years; it is the only Keirin race of the year in which both S-class and A-class compete in the same race. A new addition to the meet in 2012 was the Girls&#x27; Grand Prix for the sport&#x27;s top female competitors.

Another prestigious event on the annual keirin racing calendar is the GI Japan Championship. Held every May over a period of six days, it is the longest single race meeting of the year.

Each of the keirin velodromes are generally permitted to host one event per year of either GI, GII or GIII designation. The remaining events at each track consist of a combination of FI and FII races for a total of approximately 70 race days per year. On average there is one GI or GII event every month and one GIII meeting per week on the annual calendar.

===Top Keirin events===
As of 2024, the top events on the Keirin racing calendar are as follows:&lt;br&gt;
※＝&quot;Girls Keirin&quot;
===Race schedule===
Keirin velodromes follow the same basic schedule of races when conducting a race meeting. On the first day of competition, the better keirin competitors are assigned to races of higher caliber, while others are assigned to low-caliber races. Keirin racers are guaranteed to compete on each day of the meeting unless they are disqualified from a race or retire from the meet for any reason - in which case alternate competitors are called up to fill in the lower-caliber races.

Below is a schedule of races conducted during a typical three-day FI event (open to both S-class and A-class riders).

====Day 1====
*Races 1–5: (low caliber)
**First four or five finishers in each race advance to Day 2 Semifinals
*Race 6: (high caliber)
**All riders compete in Day 2 Semifinals

After six races, S-class riders compete:
*Races 7–10: 
**First three or four finishers in each race advance to Day 2 Semifinals
*Race 11: 
**All riders compete in Day 2 Semifinals

====Day 2====
*Races 1–2: 
**First two finishers in each race advance to Day 3 Special
*Race 3: 
**First five finishers advance to Day 3 Special
*Races 4–6: 
**First three finishers in each race advance to Day 3 Final

S-class riders then compete to advance:
*Races 7–8: 
**First one or two finishers in each race advance to Day 3 Special
*Races 9–11: 
**First three finishers in each race advance to Day 3 Final

====Day 3====
*Races 1–2: 
*Races 3–5: 
*Races 6–7: 
*Race 8: 
*Race 9: 
*Race 10: 
*Race 11: 

===Betting===
Bets that can be made on Keirin races include, but are not limited to:
* – selecting the first two finishers in exact order
* – first two finishers in any order
* – first three finishers in exact order
* – first three finishers in any order
* - selecting two to finish in the top three, in any order.
Some wagers cannot be placed if there is a small number of competitors in the race.

During major race meets, some jackpot wagers are offered:
* Dokanto! 4 two – selecting the exacta in four consecutive (typically the last four) races.
* Dokanto! 7 – this is what would be called a Pick 7 in horse racing in that the bettor selects the winner of each of the last seven races of the day.

The money bet into the Dokanto wagers can carry over if there are no winning tickets, even to subsequent race meets at another velodrome in the country.

In extraordinary circumstances, races have been declared no-contests, forcing velodromes to refund millions of yen in bets. Such results are generally known as a . A race at Shizuoka velodrome on 2 January 2008 was declared a failure when the back wheel of the pacer&#x27;s bicycle nicked the bicycle of an actual competitor, causing him to fall. In a race at Iwaki-Taira Velodrome on 14 December 2008, separate infractions resulted in the disqualification of the entire field; all but one of the competitors were handed a one-year suspension by the velodrome after the race. The suspensions were lifted four months later.

===Equipment===

As a result of the parimutuel gambling that surrounds keirin racing in Japan, The Nihon Jitensha Shinkōkai (Japanese Bicycle Association or NJS)— now under the JKA Foundation— developed a strict system of standards for bicycles and tools to ensure that no rider will have any advantage based on equipment. All components must be made using NJS-approved materials and techniques, and the frames themselves must be handmade by an NJS-certified builder. For example, the bicycles frames used in Japanese Keirin races must be made from chromoly steel using traditional techniques like brazing, and wheels must have exactly 36 spokes per wheel. 

Popular frame manufacturers include Nagasawa, 3Rensho, Makino, Kalavinka, Level, Bridgestone, Panasonic, and Samson. Other components come from Japanese manufacturers like Shimano, Nitto, Hatta, MKS, Kashimax, and Sugino. Because the primary goal of the NJS is to support the Japanese manufacturing industry, its bureaucracy is typically resistant to the certification of foreign manufacturers&#x27; components. The few exceptions to this are Italian cycling equipment manufacturers Campagnolo and Cinelli, which received NJS certification for some components.

Exceptions to these rules include Girls&#x27; Keirin and Keirin Evolution. Girls&#x27; Keirin allows for a limited set of non-NJS tires, stems, saddles, and carbon-fiber frames and wheels. Manufacturers of the frames used in Girls&#x27; Keirin are Boma, Bridgestone, Gan Well, Kalavinka, Bomber, and MBK. Keirin Evolution participants may use any frames or components approved by the NJS, UCI, or JCF. NJS-approved equipment is not required for keirin races sanctioned by the UCI or its local national sporting associations, including UCI-sanctioned races in Japan.

The NJS standard does not necessarily relate to quality or standard of manufacture, though NJS-approved equipment often sells for more than comparable equipment because of its niche use, strict build requirements, and finite availability.

<text>In computability theory, a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a model of computation, a computer&#x27;s instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be Turing-complete or computationally universal if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine (devised by English mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing). This means that this system is able to recognize or decode other data-manipulation rule sets. Turing completeness is used as a way to express the power of such a data-manipulation rule set. Virtually all programming languages today are Turing-complete.

A related concept is that of Turing equivalence two computers P and Q are called equivalent if P can simulate Q and Q can simulate P. The Church–Turing thesis conjectures that any function whose values can be computed by an algorithm can be computed by a Turing machine, and therefore that if any real-world computer can simulate a Turing machine, it is Turing equivalent to a Turing machine. A universal Turing machine can be used to simulate any Turing machine and by extension the purely computational aspects of any possible real-world computer.

To show that something is Turing-complete, it is enough to demonstrate that it can be used to simulate some Turing-complete system. No physical system can have infinite memory, but if the limitation of finite memory is ignored, most programming languages are otherwise Turing-complete.

==Non-mathematical usage==
In colloquial usage, the terms &quot;Turing-complete&quot; and &quot;Turing-equivalent&quot; are used to mean that any real-world general-purpose computer or computer language can approximately simulate the computational aspects of any other real-world general-purpose computer or computer language. In real life, this leads to the practical concepts of computing virtualization and emulation.

Real computers constructed so far can be functionally analyzed like a single-tape Turing machine (which uses a &quot;tape&quot; for memory); thus the associated mathematics can apply by abstracting their operation far enough. However, real computers have limited physical resources, so they are only linear bounded automaton complete. In contrast, the abstraction of a universal computer is defined as a device with a Turing-complete instruction set, infinite memory, and infinite available time.

==Formal definitions==
In computability theory, several closely related terms are used to describe the computational power of a computational system (such as an abstract machine or programming language):

;Turing completeness
: A computational system that can compute every Turing-computable function is called Turing-complete (or Turing-powerful). Alternatively, such a system is one that can simulate a universal Turing machine.
;Turing equivalence
: A Turing-complete system is called Turing-equivalent if every function it can compute is also Turing-computable; i.e., it computes precisely the same class of functions as do Turing machines. Alternatively, a Turing-equivalent system is one that can simulate, and be simulated by, a universal Turing machine. (All known physically-implementable Turing-complete systems are Turing-equivalent, which adds support to the Church–Turing thesis.)
;(Computational) universality
: A system is called universal with respect to a class of systems if it can compute every function computable by systems in that class (or can simulate each of those systems). Typically, the term &#x27;universality&#x27; is tacitly used with respect to a Turing-complete class of systems. The term &quot;weakly universal&quot; is sometimes used to distinguish a system (e.g. a cellular automaton) whose universality is achieved only by modifying the standard definition of Turing machine so as to include input streams with infinitely many 1s.

==History==
Turing completeness is significant in that every real-world design for a computing device can be simulated by a universal Turing machine. The Church–Turing thesis states that this is a law of mathematics that a universal Turing machine can, in principle, perform any calculation that any other programmable computer can. This says nothing about the effort needed to write the program, or the time it may take for the machine to perform the calculation, or any abilities the machine may possess that have nothing to do with computation.

Charles Babbage&#x27;s analytical engine (1830s) would have been the first Turing-complete machine if it had been built at the time it was designed. Babbage appreciated that the machine was capable of great feats of calculation, including primitive logical reasoning, but he did not appreciate that no other machine could do better. From the 1830s until the 1940s, mechanical calculating machines such as adders and multipliers were built and improved, but they could not perform a conditional branch and therefore were not Turing-complete.

In the late 19th century, Leopold Kronecker formulated notions of computability, defining primitive recursive functions. These functions can be calculated by rote computation, but they are not enough to make a universal computer, because the instructions that compute them do not allow for an infinite loop. In the early 20th century, David Hilbert led a program to axiomatize all of mathematics with precise axioms and precise logical rules of deduction that could be performed by a machine. Soon it became clear that a small set of deduction rules are enough to produce the consequences of any set of axioms. These rules were proved by Kurt Gödel in 1930 to be enough to produce every theorem.

The actual notion of computation was isolated soon after, starting with Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem. This theorem showed that axiom systems were limited when reasoning about the computation that deduces their theorems. Church and Turing independently demonstrated that Hilbert&#x27;s (decision problem) was unsolvable, thus identifying the computational core of the incompleteness theorem. This work, along with Gödel&#x27;s work on general recursive functions, established that there are sets of simple instructions, which, when put together, are able to produce any computation. The work of Gödel showed that the notion of computation is essentially unique.

In 1941 Konrad Zuse completed the Z3 computer. Zuse was not familiar with Turing&#x27;s work on computability at the time. In particular, the Z3 lacked dedicated facilities for a conditional jump, thereby precluding it from being Turing complete. However, in 1998, it was shown by Rojas that the Z3 is capable of simulating conditional jumps, and therefore Turing complete in theory. To do this, its tape program would have to be long enough to execute every possible path through both sides of every branch.

The first computer capable of conditional branching in practice, and therefore Turing complete in practice, was the ENIAC in 1946. Zuse&#x27;s Z4 computer was operational in 1945, but it did not support conditional branching until 1950.

==Computability theory==
Computability theory uses models of computation to analyze problems and determine whether they are computable and under what circumstances. The first result of computability theory is that there exist problems for which it is impossible to predict what a (Turing-complete) system will do over an arbitrarily long time.

The classic example is the halting problem: create an algorithm that takes as input a program in some Turing-complete language and some data to be fed to &quot;that&quot; program, and determines whether the program, operating on the input, will eventually stop or will continue forever. It is trivial to create an algorithm that can do this for &quot;some&quot; inputs, but impossible to do this in general. For any characteristic of the program&#x27;s eventual output, it is impossible to determine whether this characteristic will hold.

This impossibility poses problems when analyzing real-world computer programs. For example, one cannot write a tool that entirely protects programmers from writing infinite loops or protects users from supplying input that would cause infinite loops.

One can instead limit a program to executing only for a fixed period of time (timeout) or limit the power of flow-control instructions (for example, providing only loops that iterate over the items of an existing array). However, another theorem shows that there are problems solvable by Turing-complete languages that cannot be solved by any language with only finite looping abilities (i.e., languages that guarantee that every program will eventually finish to a halt). So any such language is not Turing-complete. For example, a language in which programs are guaranteed to complete and halt cannot compute the computable function produced by Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument on all computable functions in that language.

==Turing oracles==
A computer with access to an infinite tape of data may be more powerful than a Turing machine: for instance, the tape might contain the solution to the halting problem or some other Turing-undecidable problem. Such an infinite tape of data is called a Turing oracle. Even a Turing oracle with random data is not computable (with probability 1), since there are only countably many computations but uncountably many oracles. So a computer with a random Turing oracle can compute things that a Turing machine cannot.

==Digital physics==

All known laws of physics have consequences that are computable by a series of approximations on a digital computer. A hypothesis called digital physics states that this is no accident because the universe itself is computable on a universal Turing machine. This would imply that no computer more powerful than a universal Turing machine can be built physically.

==Examples==
The computational systems (algebras, calculi) that are discussed as Turing-complete systems are those intended for studying theoretical computer science. They are intended to be as simple as possible, so that it would be easier to understand the limits of computation. Here are a few:
* Automata theory
* Formal grammar (language generators)
* Formal language (language recognizers)
* Lambda calculus
* Post–Turing machines
* Process calculus

Most programming languages (their abstract models, maybe with some particular constructs that assume finite memory omitted), conventional and unconventional, are Turing-complete. This includes:
* All general-purpose languages in wide use.
** Procedural programming languages such as C, Pascal.
** Object-oriented languages such as Java, Smalltalk or C#.
** Multi-paradigm languages such as Ada, C++, Common Lisp, Fortran, JavaScript, Object Pascal, Perl, Python, R.
* Most languages using less common paradigms:
** Functional languages such as Lisp and Haskell.
** Logic programming languages such as Prolog.
** General-purpose macro processor such as m4.
** Declarative languages such as SQL and XSLT.
** VHDL and other hardware description languages.
** TeX, a typesetting system.
** Esoteric programming languages, a form of mathematical recreation in which programmers work out how to achieve basic programming constructs in an extremely difficult but mathematically Turing-equivalent language.

Some rewrite systems are Turing-complete.

Turing completeness is an abstract statement of ability, rather than a prescription of specific language features used to implement that ability. The features used to achieve Turing completeness can be quite different; Fortran systems would use loop constructs or possibly even goto statements to achieve repetition; Haskell and Prolog, lacking looping almost entirely, would use recursion. Most programming languages are describing computations on von Neumann architectures, which have memory (RAM and register) and a control unit. These two elements make this architecture Turing-complete. Even pure functional languages are Turing-complete.

Turing completeness in declarative SQL is implemented through recursive common table expressions. Unsurprisingly, procedural extensions to SQL (PLSQL, etc.) are also Turing-complete. This illustrates one reason why relatively powerful non-Turing-complete languages are rare: the more powerful the language is initially, the more complex are the tasks to which it is applied and the sooner its lack of completeness becomes perceived as a drawback, encouraging its extension until it is Turing-complete.

The untyped lambda calculus is Turing-complete, but many typed lambda calculi, including System F, are not. The value of typed systems is based in their ability to represent most typical computer programs while detecting more errors.

Rule 110 and Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, both cellular automata, are Turing-complete.

===Unintentional Turing completeness===
Some software and video games are Turing-complete by accident, i.e. not by design.

Software:

* Microsoft Excel

Games:
* &quot;Dwarf Fortress&quot;
* &quot;Opus Magnum&quot;
* &quot;Minecraft&quot;
* Infinite-grid Minesweeper

Social media:
* &quot;Habbo Hotel&quot;

Computational languages:
* C++ templates
* printf format string
* TypeScript&#x27;s type system
* x86 assembly&#x27;s MOV instruction

Biology:
* Chemical reaction networks and enzyme-based DNA computers have been shown to be Turing-equivalent

==Non-Turing-complete languages==
Many computational languages exist that are not Turing-complete. One such example is the set of regular languages, which are generated by regular expressions and which are recognized by finite automata. A more powerful but still not Turing-complete extension of finite automata is the category of pushdown automata and context-free grammars, which are commonly used to generate parse trees in an initial stage of program compiling. Further examples include some of the early versions of the pixel shader languages embedded in Direct3D and OpenGL extensions.

In total functional programming languages, such as Charity and Epigram, all functions are total and must terminate. Charity uses a type system and control constructs based on category theory, whereas Epigram uses dependent types. The LOOP language is designed so that it computes only the functions that are primitive recursive. All of these compute proper subsets of the total computable functions, since the full set of total computable functions is not computably enumerable. Also, since all functions in these languages are total, algorithms for recursively enumerable sets cannot be written in these languages, in contrast with Turing machines.

Although (untyped) lambda calculus is Turing-complete, simply typed lambda calculus is not.

<text>The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American prison drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella &quot;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption&quot;. The film tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis &quot;Red&quot; Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles.

Darabont purchased the film rights to King&#x27;s story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over eight weeks. Two weeks after submitting his script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine, principal photography took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio, with the Ohio State Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many stars for the role of Andy, including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Costner. Thomas Newman provided the film&#x27;s score.

While &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; received critical acclaim upon its release—particularly for its story and the performances of Robbins and Freeman, it was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from the films &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, the general unpopularity of prison films, its lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered confusing for audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven Academy Award nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film&#x27;s box-office gross to $73.3 million.

Over 320,000 VHS rental copies were shipped throughout the United States, and on the strength of its award nominations and word of mouth, it became the top video rental of 1995. The broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock Entertainment by Turner Broadcasting System, and it was shown regularly on the TNT network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. Decades after release, the film is still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration or naming it a favorite in various surveys, leading to its recognition as one of the greatest films of all time. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Plot ==

In 1947, Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne arrives at Shawshank State Prison to serve two consecutive life sentences for murdering his wife and her lover. He is befriended by Ellis Boyd &quot;Red&quot; Redding, a contraband smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures for him a rock hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth. Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently raped by &quot;the Sisters&quot; gang, led by Bogs Diamond.

In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After the Sisters beat Andy to near-death, Hadley cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to a minimum security hospital; Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton assigns Andy to the prison&#x27;s decrepit library, ostensibly to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, but in reality, to leverage Andy&#x27;s financial expertise for managing the finances of the warden and other prison staff. Andy also starts writing weekly letters to the state legislature, requesting funding to improve the library.

Brooks is paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, but cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself. After years of Andy&#x27;s ceaseless letters, the legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;; Andy plays an excerpt over the public address system, experiencing a moment of personal freedom before he is punished with solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains to a dismissive Red that hope is what gets him through his sentence. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias &quot;Randall Stephens.&quot;

In 1965, Andy and Red befriend Tommy Williams, a young inmate convicted of burglary. Andy helps Tommy pass his General Educational Development exam, and Tommy later reveals that his cellmate at another prison confessed to committing the murders for which Andy was convicted. When Andy informs Norton, the warden refuses to act. Although Andy promises to keep the money laundering a secret, Norton has Hadley kill Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt and sends Andy to solitary confinement. Norton then threatens to destroy the library, strip Andy of guard protection, and transfer him to harsher conditions if he refuses to continue with his scheme.

A dishevelled Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months. He tells a skeptical Red that he dreams of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican town on the Pacific coast where he can start anew. He asks Red to promise, once he is released, to travel to a specific hayfield near Buxton and recover a package that Andy buried there. Red worries that Andy is suicidal, especially after learning that he asked a fellow inmate for a rope. 

At the next day&#x27;s roll call, the guards find Andy&#x27;s cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at the poster hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over nearly two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking with him Norton&#x27;s suit, shoes, and the ledger containing evidence of the money laundering and corruption at Shawshank. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and withdraws over $370,000 of the laundered money from several banks, before mailing the ledger to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.

The following year, Red is paroled after serving 40 years, but struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter inviting him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole by traveling to Mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. He finds Andy on a beach, and the reunited friends happily embrace.

==Analysis==
The film has been interpreted as being grounded in Christian mysticism. Andy is offered as a messianic, Christ-like figure, with Red describing him early in the film as having an aura that engulfs and protects him from Shawshank. The scene in which Andy and several inmates tar the prison roof can be seen as a recreation of the Last Supper, with Andy obtaining beer/wine for the twelve inmates/disciples as Freeman describes them as the &quot;lords of all creation&quot; invoking Jesus&#x27; blessing. Director Frank Darabont responded that this was not his deliberate intention, but he wanted people to find their own meaning in the film. The discovery of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; record is described in the screenplay as akin to finding the Holy Grail, bringing the prisoners to a halt, and causing the sick to rise up in their beds.

Early in the film, Warden Norton quotes Jesus Christ to describe himself to Andy, saying, &quot;I am the light of the world&quot;, declaring himself Andy&#x27;s savior, but this description can also reference Lucifer, the bearer of light. Indeed, the warden does not enforce the general rule of law, but chooses to enforce his own rules and punishments as he sees fit, becoming a law unto himself, like the behavior of Satan. The warden has also been compared to former United States President Richard Nixon. Norton&#x27;s appearance and public addresses can be seen to mirror Nixon&#x27;s. Similarly, Norton projects an image of a holy man, speaking down sanctimoniously to the servile masses while running corrupt scams, like those of which Nixon was accused.
Zihuatanejo has been interpreted as an analog for heaven or paradise. In the film, Andy describes it as a place with no memory, offering absolution from his sins by forgetting about them or allowing them to be washed away by the Pacific Ocean, whose name means &quot;peaceful&quot;. The possibility of escaping to Zihuatanejo is only raised after Andy admits that he feels responsible for his wife&#x27;s death. Similarly, Red&#x27;s freedom is only earned once he accepts he cannot save himself or atone for his sins. Freeman has described Red&#x27;s story as one of salvation as he is not innocent of his crimes, unlike Andy, who finds redemption.

While some Christian viewers interpret Zihuatanejo as heaven, film critic Mark Kermode wrote that it can also be interpreted as a Nietzschean form of guiltlessness achieved outside traditional notions of good and evil, where the amnesia offered is the destruction rather than forgiveness of sin, meaning Andy&#x27;s aim is secular and atheistic. Just as Andy can be interpreted as a Christ-like figure, he can be seen as a Zarathustra-like prophet offering escape through education and the experience of freedom. Film critic Roger Ebert argued that &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is an allegory for maintaining one&#x27;s feeling of self-worth when placed in a hopeless position. Andy&#x27;s integrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where integrity is lacking.

Robbins himself believes that the concept of Zihuatanejo resonates with audiences because it represents a form of escape that can be achieved after surviving for many years within whatever &quot;jail&quot; someone finds themselves in, whether a bad relationship, job, or environment. Robbins said that it is important that such a place exists for us. Isaac M. Morehouse suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or imprisoned, even in freedom, based on their outlooks on life. Philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described freedom as an ongoing project that requires attention and resilience, without which a person begins to be defined by others or institutions, mirroring Red&#x27;s belief that inmates become dependent on the prison to define their lives. Andy displays resilience through rebellion, by playing music over the prison loudspeaker, and refusing to continue with the money-laundering scam.

Many elements can be considered as tributes to the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the film &quot;Gilda&quot; (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; (1945). The interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject that is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation. Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses a film reel to help fight them off. At the end of the film, Andy passes through a hole in his cell hidden by a movie poster to escape both his cell and ultimately Shawshank.

Andy and Red&#x27;s relationship has been described as a nonsexual story between two men that few other films offer, as the friendship is not built on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship with women. Philosopher Alexander Hooke argued that Andy and Red&#x27;s true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.

==Production==

===Development===

Frank Darabont first collaborated with author Stephen King in 1983 on the short film adaptation of &quot;The Woman in the Room&quot;, buying the rights from him for $1—a Dollar Deal that King used to help new directors build a résumé by adapting his short stories. After receiving his first screenwriting credit in 1987 for &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot;, Darabont returned to King with $5,000 to purchase the rights to adapt &quot;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption&quot;, a 96-page novella from King&#x27;s 1982 collection &quot;Different Seasons&quot;, written to explore genres other than the horror stories for which he was commonly known. Although King did not understand how the story, largely focused on Red contemplating his fellow prisoner Andy, could be turned into a feature film, Darabont believed it was &quot;obvious&quot;. King never cashed the $5,000 check from Darabont; he later framed it and returned it to Darabont accompanied by a note which read: &quot;In case you ever need bail money. Love, Steve.&quot;

Five years later, Darabont wrote the script over an eight-week period. He expanded on elements of King&#x27;s story. Brooks, who in the novella is a minor character who dies in a retirement home, became a tragic character who eventually hanged himself. Tommy, who in the novella trades his evidence exonerating Andy for transfer to a nicer prison, in the screenplay is murdered on the orders of Warden Norton, who is a composite of several warden characters in King&#x27;s story. Darabont opted to create a single warden character to serve as the primary antagonist. Among his inspirations, Darabont listed the works of director Frank Capra, including &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939) and &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946), describing them as tall tales; Darabont likened &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; to a tall tale more than a prison movie. He also cited &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990) as an inspiration on the use of dialogue to illustrate the passage of time in the script, and the prison drama &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (1962) directed by John Frankenheimer. While later scouting filming locations, Darabont happened upon Frankenheimer who was scouting for his own prison-set project &quot;Against the Wall&quot;. Darabont recalled that Frankenheimer took time out from his scouting to provide Darabont with encouragement and advice.

At the time, prison-based films were not considered likely box-office successes, but Darabont&#x27;s script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainment producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories and reaction to the script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock Entertainment did not produce &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;. Director and Castle Rock Entertainment co-founder Rob Reiner also liked the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million and $3 million to allow him to direct it himself. Reiner, who had previously adapted King&#x27;s 1982 novella &quot;The Body&quot; into the 1986 film &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, planned to cast Tom Cruise as Andy and Harrison Ford as Red.

Castle Rock Entertainment offered to finance any other film Darabont wanted to develop. Darabont seriously considered the offer, citing growing up poor in Los Angeles, believing it would elevate his standing in the industry, and that Castle Rock Entertainment could have contractually fired him and given the film to Reiner anyway, but he chose to remain the director, saying in a 2014 &quot;Variety&quot; interview, &quot;you can continue to defer your dreams in exchange for money and, you know, die without ever having done the thing you set out to do&quot;. Reiner served as Darabont&#x27;s mentor on the project, instead. Within two weeks of showing the script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont had a $25 million budget to make his film (taking a $750,000 screenwriting and directing salary plus a percentage of the net profits), and pre-production began in January 1993.

===Casting===

Morgan Freeman was cast at the suggestion of producer Liz Glotzer, who ignored the novella&#x27;s character description of a white Irishman, nicknamed &quot;Red&quot;. Freeman&#x27;s character alludes to the choice when queried by Andy on why he is called Red, replying &quot;Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m Irish.&quot; Freeman opted not to research his role, saying &quot;acting the part of someone who&#x27;s incarcerated doesn&#x27;t require any specific knowledge of incarceration ... because men don&#x27;t change. Once you&#x27;re in that situation, you just toe whatever line you have to toe.&quot; Darabont was already aware of Freeman from his minor role in another prison drama, &quot;Brubaker&quot; (1980), while Tim Robbins had been excited to work alongside Freeman, having grown up watching him in &quot;The Electric Company&quot; children&#x27;s television show.

Darabont looked initially at some of his favorite actors, such as Gene Hackman and Robert Duvall, for the role of Andy Dufresne, but they were unavailable; Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman were also considered. Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Kevin Costner were offered, and passed on the role—Hanks due to his starring role in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, and Costner because he had the lead in &quot;Waterworld&quot;. Johnny Depp, Nicolas Cage, and Charlie Sheen were also considered for the role at different stages. Cruise attended table readings of the script, but declined to work for the inexperienced Darabont. Darabont said he cast Robbins after seeing his performance in the 1990 psychological horror &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;. When Robbins was cast, he insisted that Darabont use experienced cinematographer Roger Deakins, who had worked with him on &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot;. To prepare for the role, Robbins observed caged animals at a zoo, spent an afternoon in solitary confinement, spoke with prisoners and guards, and had his arms and legs shackled for a few hours.

Cast initially as young convict Tommy, Brad Pitt dropped out following his success in &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;, and the role went to a debuting Gil Bellows. James Gandolfini passed on portraying prison rapist Bogs. Bob Gunton was filming &quot;Demolition Man&quot; (1993) when he went to audition for the role of Warden Norton. To convince the studio that Gunton was right for the part, Darabont and producer Niki Marvin arranged for him to record a screen test on a day off from &quot;Demolition Man&quot;. They had a wig made for him as his head was shaved for his &quot;Demolition Man&quot; role. Gunton wanted to portray Norton with hair as this could then be grayed to convey his on-screen aging as the film progressed. Gunton performed his screen test with Robbins, which was filmed by Deakins. After being confirmed for the role, he used the wig in the film&#x27;s early scenes until his hair regrew. Gunton said that Marvin and Darabont saw that he understood the character, which went in his favor, as did the fact his height was similar to Robbins&#x27;, allowing Andy to believably use the warden&#x27;s suit.

Portraying the head guard Byron Hadley, Clancy Brown was given the opportunity to speak with former guards by the production&#x27;s liaison officer but declined, believing it would not be a good thing to say that his brutal character was in any way inspired by Ohio state correctional officers. William Sadler, who portrays Heywood, said that Darabont had approached him in 1989 on the set of the &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; television series, where he was a writer, about starring in the adaptation he was intending to make. Freeman&#x27;s son Alfonso has a cameo as a young Red in mug shot photos, and as a prisoner shouting &quot;fresh fish&quot; as Andy arrives at Shawshank. Among the extras used in the film were the former warden and former inmates of the reformatory, and active guards from a nearby incarceration facility. The novella&#x27;s original title attracted several people to audition for the nonexistent role of Rita Hayworth, including a man in drag clothing.

===Filming===

On a $25 million budget, principal photography took place over three months between June and August 1993. Filming regularly required up to 18-hour workdays, six days a week. Freeman described filming as tense, saying, &quot;Most of the time, the tension was between the cast and director. I remember having a bad moment with the director, had a few of those.&quot; Freeman referred to Darabont&#x27;s requiring multiple takes of scenes, which he considered had no discernible differences. For example, the scene where Andy first approaches Red to procure a rock hammer took nine hours to film and featured Freeman throwing and catching a baseball with another inmate throughout it. The number of takes that were shot resulted in Freeman turning up to filming the following day with his arm in a sling. Freeman sometimes simply refused to do the additional takes. Robbins said that the long days were difficult. Darabont felt that making the film taught him a lot, &quot;A director really needs to have an internal barometer to measure what any given actor needs.&quot; He found his most frequent struggles were with Deakins. Darabont favored more scenic shots, while Deakins felt that not showing the outside of the prison added a sense of claustrophobia, and it meant that when a wide scenic shot was used, it had more impact.

Marvin spent five months scouting prisons across the United States and Canada, looking for a site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison with the security difficulties that would entail. Marvin eventually chose the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio, to serve as the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, citing its Gothic-style stone and brick buildings. The facility had been shuttered three years earlier in 1990, due to inhumane living conditions.

The 15-acre reformatory, housing its own power plant and farm, was partially torn down shortly after filming was completed, leaving the main administration building and two cellblocks. Several of the interior shots of the specialized prison facilities, such as the admittance rooms and the warden&#x27;s office, were shot in the reformatory. The interior of the boarding room used by Brooks and Red was in the administration building; exterior shots of the boarding house were taken elsewhere. Internal scenes in the prison cellblocks were filmed on a sound stage built inside a nearby shuttered Westinghouse Electric factory. Since Darabont wanted the inmates&#x27; cells to face each other, almost all the cellblock scenes were shot on a purpose-built set housed in the Westinghouse factory, except for the scene featuring Elmo Blatch&#x27;s admission of guilt for the crimes for which Andy was convicted. It was filmed in one of the actual prison&#x27;s more confined cells. Scenes were also filmed in Mansfield, as well as neighboring Ashland, Ohio. The oak tree under which Andy buries his letter to Red was located near Malabar Farm State Park, in Lucas, Ohio; it was destroyed by winds in 2016.
Just as a prison in Ohio stood in for a fictional one in Maine, the beach scene showing Andy and Red&#x27;s reunion in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, was actually shot in the Caribbean on the island of Saint Croix, one of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The beach at &#x27;Zihuatanejo&#x27; is the Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge, a protected area for leatherback sea turtles. Scenes shot in Upper Sandusky included the prison wood shop scene where Red and his fellow inmates hear &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (the woodshop is now called the Shawshank Woodshop), and the opening court scene which was shot at the Wyandot County Courthouse. Other shooting locations included Pugh Cabin in Malabar Farm State Park, where Andy sits outside as his wife engages in an affair, Butler, Ohio, stood in for Buxton, Maine, and the Bissman Building in Mansfield served as the halfway house where Brooks stayed following his release.

For the scene depicting Andy&#x27;s escape from the prison, Darabont envisioned Andy using his miniature rock hammer to break into the sewage pipe, but he determined that this was not realistic. He opted instead to use a large piece of rock. While the film portrays the iconic scene of Andy escaping to freedom through a sewer pipe described as a &quot;river of shit&quot;, Robbins crawls through a mixture of water, chocolate syrup, and sawdust. The stream into which Robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designer Terence Marsh. The production team dammed the stream to make it deeper and used chlorination to partially decontaminate it. Of the scene, Robbins said, &quot;when you&#x27;re doing a film, you want to be a good soldier—you don&#x27;t want to be the one [who] gets in the way. So you will do things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety.&quot; The scene was intended to be much longer and more dramatic, detailing Andy&#x27;s escape across a field and onto a train, but with only a single night available to film the sequence, it was shortened to showing Andy standing triumphant in the water. Of his own work, Deakins considers the scene to be one of his least favorite, saying that he &quot;over-lit&quot; it. In response, Darabont disagreed with Deakins&#x27; self-assessment. He said that the time and precision taken by Deakins, and their limited filming schedule, meant he had to be precise in what he could film and how. In a 2019 interview, he stated that he regretted that this meant he could not film a close up of Robbins&#x27; face as he climbed down out of the hole from his cell.

As for the scene where Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins&#x27; idea for Andy to turn the music up and not shut it off. While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth in &quot;Gilda&quot; (1946), they were originally intended to be watching Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol. As the footage was too costly to procure from Paramount Pictures, producer Niki Marvin approached &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;″s domestic distribution rights-holder Columbia Pictures, which offered a list of lower-priced titles, one of which was &quot;Gilda&quot;. As filming took place mainly in and around the prison, scenes were often shot in near chronological order respective of the different eras depicted throughout the story. This aided the actors&#x27; performances as their real-life relationships evolved alongside those of their respective characters. Darabont commented that the scene in which Andy tells Red about his dreams of going to Mexico, was one of the last filmed and one that he most revisited in recollecting on the film&#x27;s production. He praised Robbins and Freeman for completing the scene in only a few takes.
===Post-production===
The final cut of the theatrically released film runs for 142 minutes, and was dedicated to the memory of Allen Greene, Darabont&#x27;s former agent, who died during filming from AIDS. The film&#x27;s first edit ran for nearly two and a half hours, which Glotzer considered &quot;long&quot;, and several scenes were cut including a longer sequence of Red adjusting to life after incarceration; Darabont said that in test screenings the audience seemed to be getting impatient with the scene as they were already convinced that Red would not make it. Another scene cut for time showed a prison guard investigating Andy&#x27;s escape tunnel; this was thought to slow down the action. The film originally had a cold open that played out Andy&#x27;s crime, with his trial playing throughout the opening credits, but these scenes were edited together to create a more &quot;punchy&quot; opening. One scripted scene, which Darabont described as his best work, was left unfilmed because of the shooting schedule. In the scene, a dreaming Red is sucked into the poster of Rita Hayworth to find himself alone and insignificant on the Pacific shore, saying &quot;I am terrified, there is no way home.&quot; Darabont said that he regretted being unable to capture the scene.

In Darabont&#x27;s original vision for the end of the film, Red is seen riding a bus towards the Mexican border, leaving his fate ambiguous. Glotzer insisted on including the scene of Red and Andy reuniting in Zihuatanejo. She said Darabont felt this was a &quot;commercial, sappy&quot; ending, but Glotzer wanted the audience to see them together. Castle Rock agreed to finance filming for the scene without requiring its inclusion, guaranteeing Darabont the final decision. The scene originally featured a longer reunion in which Andy and Red recited dialogue from their first meeting, but Darabont said it had a &quot;golly-gee-ain&#x27;t-we-cute&quot; quality and excised it. The beach reunion was test audiences&#x27; favorite scene; both Freeman and Robbins felt it provided the necessary closure. Darabont agreed to include the scene after seeing the test audience reactions, saying: &quot;I think it&#x27;s a magical and uplifting place for our characters to arrive at the end of their long saga...&quot;

===Music===

The film&#x27;s score was composed by Thomas Newman. He felt that it already elicited such strong emotions without music that he found it difficult to compose one that would elevate scenes without distracting from them. The piece, &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot;, plays during Andy&#x27;s escape from Shawshank and originally had a three-note motif, but Darabont felt it had too much of a &quot;triumphal flourish&quot; and asked that it be toned down to a single-note motif. &quot;So Was Red&quot;, played following Red&#x27;s release from prison, and leading to his discovery of Andy&#x27;s cache, became one of Newman&#x27;s favorite pieces. The piece was initially written for a solo oboe, until Newman reluctantly agreed to add harmonica—a reference to the harmonica Red receives from Andy to continue his message of hope. According to Darabont, harmonica player Tommy Morgan &quot;casually delivered something dead-on perfect on the first take&quot;, and this is heard in the finished film. Newman&#x27;s score was so successful that excerpts from it were used in movie trailers for years afterwards.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
Leading up to its release, the film was test screened with the public. These were described as &quot;through the roof&quot;, and Glotzer said they were some of the best she had seen. It was decided to mostly omit Stephen King&#x27;s name from any advertising, as the studio wanted to attract a &quot;more prestigious audience&quot;, who might reject a film from a writer known mostly for pulp fiction works such as &quot;The Shining&quot; and &quot;Cujo&quot;.

Following early September premieres at the Renaissance Theatre in Mansfield, and the Toronto International Film Festival, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; began a limited North American release on September 23, 1994. During its opening weekend, the film grossed $727,327 from 33 theaters—an average of $22,040 per theater. Following a Hollywood tradition of visiting different theaters on opening night to see the audiences view their film live, Darabont and Glotzer went to the Cinerama Dome, but found no one there. Glotzer claimed that the pair actually sold two tickets outside the theater with the promise that if the buyers did not like the film, they could ask Castle Rock for a refund. While critics praised the film, Glotzer believed that a lackluster review from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; pushed crowds away. It received a wide release on October 14, 1994, expanding to a total of 944 theaters to earn $2.4 million—an average of $2,545 per theater—finishing as the number-nine film of the weekend, behind sex-comedy &quot;Exit to Eden&quot; ($3 million), and just ahead of the historical drama &quot;Quiz Show&quot; ($2.1 million), which was in its fifth week at the cinemas. &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; closed in late November 1994, after 10 weeks with an approximate total gross of $16 million. It was considered a box-office bomb, failing to recoup its $25 million budget, not including marketing costs and the cinema exhibitors&#x27; cuts.

The film was also competing with &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; ($108 million), which also premiered October 14 following its Palme d&#x27;Or award win, and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; ($330 million), which was in the middle of a successful 42-week theatrical run. Both films would become quotable cultural phenomena. A general audience trend towards action films starring the likes of Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger was also considered to work against the commercial success of &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;. Freeman blamed the title, saying it was unmemorable, while Robbins recalled fans asking: &quot;What was that &quot;Shinkshonk Reduction&quot; thing?&quot;. Several alternative titles had been posited before the release due to concerns that it was not a marketable title. The low box office was also blamed on a lack of female characters to broaden the audience demographics, the general unpopularity of prison films, and the bleak tone used in its marketing.

After being nominated for several Oscars in early 1995, the film was re-released between February and March, earning a further $12 million. In total, the film grossed $28.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $45 million from other markets for a worldwide total of $73.3 million. In the United States, it became the 51st-highest-grossing film of 1994, and the 21st-highest-grossing R-rated film of 1994.

===Post-theatrical===
Despite its disappointing box-office returns, in what was then considered a risky move, Warner Home Video shipped 320,000 rental video copies throughout the United States in 1995. It went on to become the top rented film of that year. Positive recommendations, repeat customer viewings, and being well received by both male and female audiences were considered key to the film&#x27;s rental success.

Ted Turner&#x27;s Turner Broadcasting System had acquired Castle Rock Entertainment in 1993, which enabled his television channel, TNT, to obtain the cable-broadcast rights to the film. According to Glotzer, because of the low box-office numbers, TNT could air the film at a very low cost, but still charge premium advertising rates. The film began airing regularly on the network in June 1997. Television airings of the film accrued record-breaking numbers, and its repeated broadcast was considered essential to turning the film into a cultural phenomenon after its poor box-office performance. Darabont felt the turning point for the film&#x27;s success was the Academy Award nominations, saying &quot;nobody had heard of the movie, and that year on the Oscar broadcast, they were mentioning this movie seven times&quot;. In 1996, the rights to &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; were acquired by Warner Bros. Pictures, following the merger of its parent company Time Warner with the Turner Broadcasting System.

In the United Kingdom, the film was watched by viewers on the subscription television channel Film4 in 2006, making it the year&#x27;s second most-watched film on subscription digital television.

By 2013, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; had aired on 15 basic cable networks, and in that year occupied 151 hours of airtime, rivaling &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983), and behind only &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; (1993). It was in the top 15% of movies among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 on the Spike, Up, Sundance TV, and Lifetime channels. Despite its mainly male cast, it was the most-watched movie on the female-targeted OWN network. In a 2014 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article, based on the margins studios take from box office returns, home media sales, and television licensing, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; had made an estimated $100 million. Jeff Baker, then-executive vice president and general manager of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, said that the home video sales had earned about $80 million. While finances for licensing the film for television are unknown, in 2014, current and former Warner Bros. executives confirmed that it was one of the highest-valued assets in the studio&#x27;s $1.5 billion library. That same year, Gunton said that by its tenth anniversary in 2004, he was still earning six-figure residual payments, and was still earning a &quot;substantial income&quot; from it, which was considered unusual so many years after its release.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; opened to generally positive reviews. Some reviewers compared the film to other well-received prison dramas, including &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot;, &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;, and &quot;Riot in Cell Block 11&quot;. Gene Siskel said that, like &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is an inspirational drama about overcoming overbearing authority. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Owen Gleiberman said that Freeman makes the Red character feel genuine and &quot;lived-in&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Freeman was quietly impressive, but lamented that Red&#x27;s role in the film had limited range, restricted to observing Andy. She considered Freeman&#x27;s commanding performance made him a much stronger figure than simply an observer. Maslin said that Freeman&#x27;s performance was especially moving when describing how dependent Red had become on living within the prison walls. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Leonard Klady suggested that Freeman had the &quot;showier&quot; role, allowing him &quot;a grace and dignity that came naturally&quot;, without ever becoming banal, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Desson Howe called Freeman a &quot;master&quot; of comedic and poignant cadence. Even Kenneth Turan&#x27;s &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; review, which Glotzer credited with derailing the film&#x27;s box-office success, praised Freeman, saying his &quot;effortless screen presence lends &quot;Shawshank&quot; the closest thing to credibility it can manage&quot;.

Of Robbins&#x27; performance, Gleiberman said that in his &quot;laconic-good-guy, neo-Gary Cooper role, [Robbins] is unable to make Andy connect with the audience&quot;. Conversely, Maslin said that Andy has the more subdued role, but that Robbins portrays him intensely, and effectively depicts the character as he transitions from new prisoner to aged father figure, and Klady stated that his &quot;riveting, unfussy ... precise, honest, and seamless&quot; performance anchors the film. Howe said that while the character is &quot;cheesily messianic&quot; for easily charming everyone to his side, comparing him to &quot;Forrest Gump goes to jail&quot;, Robbins exudes the perfect kind of innocence to sell the story. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stated that both Freeman and Robbins gave outstanding, layered performances that imbued their characters with individuality, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Peter Travers said that the pair created something &quot;undeniably powerful and moving&quot;. Gunton and Brown were deemed by Klady as &quot;extremely credible in their villainy&quot;, while Howe countered that Gunton&#x27;s warden was a clichéd character who extols religious virtues while having people murdered.

Maslin called the film an impressive directorial debut that tells a gentle tale with a surprising amount of loving care, while Klady said the only failings came when Darabont focused for too long on supporting characters, or embellished a secondary story. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said that both the directing and writing were crisp, while criticizing the film&#x27;s long running time. Klady said that the length and tone, while tempered by humor and unexpected events, would dampen the film&#x27;s mainstream appeal, but the story offered a fascinating portrait of the innate humanity of the inmates. Gleiberman disliked that the prisoners&#x27; crimes were overlooked to portray them more as good guys. Turan similarly objected to what he perceived as extreme violence and rape scenes, and making most of the prisoners seem like a &quot;bunch of swell and softhearted guys&quot; to cast the prison experience in a &quot;rosy glow&quot;. Klady summarized the film as &quot;estimable and haunting entertainment&quot;, comparing it to a rough diamond with small flaws, but Howe criticized it for deviating with multiple subplots, and pandering by choosing to resolve the story with Andy and Red&#x27;s reunion, rather than leaving the mystery. Ebert noted that the story works because it is not about Andy as the hero, but how Red perceives him.

Deakins&#x27; cinematography was roundly praised, with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; calling it &quot;foreboding&quot; and &quot;well-crafted&quot;, and Travers saying &quot;the everyday agonies of prison life are meticulously laid out ... you can almost feel the frustration and rage seeping into the skin of the inmates&quot;. Gleiberman praised the choice of scenery, writing &quot;the moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality; you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison walls&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said of Newman&#x27;s score, &quot;at its best moments, alights with radiant textures and sprightly grace notes, nicely emblematic of the film&#x27;s central theme&quot;, and Klady described it as &quot;the right balance between the somber and the absurd&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1995, the most for a Stephen King film adaptation: Best Picture (Marvin), Best Actor (Freeman), Best Adapted Screenplay (Darabont), Best Cinematography (Deakins), Best Film Editing (Richard Francis-Bruce), Best Sound (Robert J. Litt, Elliot Tyson, Michael Herbick, and Willie D. Burton), and Best Original Score (Newman, his first Academy Award nomination). It did not win in any category. It received two Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture for Freeman, and Best Screenplay for Darabont.

Robbins and Freeman were both nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role at the inaugural Screen Actors Guild Awards in 1995. Darabont was nominated for a Directors Guild of America award in 1994 for Best Director of a feature film, and a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Deakins won the American Society of Cinematographers award for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography, while producer Niki Marvin was nominated for a 1994 Golden Laurel Award by the Producers Guild of America.

==Legacy==

Darabont later adapted and directed two other King stories, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Mist&quot; (2007). In a 2016 interview, King said that &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; was his favorite adaptation of his work, alongside &quot;Stand by Me&quot;.

The oak tree, under which Andy leaves a note for Red directing him to Zihuatanejo, became a symbol of hope for its role in the film, and is considered iconic. In 2016, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the tree attracted thousands of visitors annually. The tree was partially destroyed on July 29, 2011, when it was split by lightning, and news of the damage was reported by U.S. and international publications. The tree was completely felled by strong winds on or around July 22, 2016, and its vestiges were cut down in April 2017. The remains were turned into &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; memorabilia, including rock hammers and magnets.

The prison site, which was planned to be fully torn down after filming, became a tourist attraction. The Mansfield Reformatory Preservation Society, a group of enthusiasts of the film, purchased the building and site from Ohio for one dollar in 2000 and took up maintaining it as a historical landmark, both as its purpose as a prison and as the filming site. A 2019 report estimated the attraction to be earning $16 million in annual revenue. Many of the rooms and props remain there, including the false pipe through which Andy escapes, and a portion of the oak tree from the finale, after it was damaged in 2011. The surrounding area is also visited by fans, while local businesses market &quot;Shawshanwiches&quot; and Bundt cakes in the shape of the prison. According to the Mansfield/Richland County Convention and Visitors Bureau (later renamed Destination Mansfield), tourism in the area had increased every year since &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; premiered, and in 2013 drew in 18,000 visitors and over $3 million to the local economy. As of 2019, Destination Mansfield operates the Shawshank Trail, a series of 15 marked stops around locations related to the film across Mansfield, Ashland, Upper Sandusky, and St Croix. The trail earned $16.9 million in revenue in 2018.

In late August 2014, a series of events was held in Mansfield to celebrate the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary including a screening of the film at the Renaissance Theatre, a bus tour of certain filming locations, and a cocktail party at the reformatory. Cast from the film attended some of the events, including Gunton, Scott Mann, Renee Blaine, and James Kisicki. The 25th anniversary was similarly celebrated in August 2019. Guests included Darabont, Blaine, Mann, Gunton, Alfonso Freeman, Bellows, Rolston, Claire Slemmer, and Frank Medrano. Darabont stated that only at this event, the first time he had returned to Mansfield, was he able to realize the lasting impact of the film, stating, &quot;It is a very surreal feeling to be back all these years later and people are still talking about it.&quot;

===Critical reassessment===
Contemporary review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an 89% approval rating from 146 critics, with an average rating of 8.30/10. The consensus reads, &quot;Steeped in old-fashioned storytelling and given evergreen humanity by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; chronicles the hardship of incarceration patiently enough to come by its uplift honestly.&quot; The film also has a score of 82 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 22 critics indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

In 1999, film critic Roger Ebert listed &quot;Shawshank&quot; on his list of &quot;The Great Movies&quot;. The American Film Institute ranked the film number 72 on its 2007 AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) list, outranking &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (76) and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (94) which were released the same year. It was also number 23 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers (2006) list charting inspiring films.

In 2005, the Writers Guild of America listed Darabont&#x27;s screenplay at number 22 on its list of the 101 greatest screenplays, and in 2006, Film4 listed it number 13 on its list of 50 Films to See Before You Die. In 2014, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; was named Hollywood&#x27;s fourth-favorite film, based on a survey of 2,120 Hollywood-based entertainment industry members; entertainment lawyers skewed the most towards the film. In 2017, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named it the 17th-best prison film ever made, and &quot;USA Today&quot; listed it as one of the 50 best films of all time. In 2019, &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; listed its ending as one of the best of all time.

&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; appeared on several lists of the greatest films of the 1990s, by outlets including: &quot;Paste&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; (2012), &quot;Complex&quot; (2013), CHUD.com (2014), MSN (2015), &quot;TheWrap&quot;, &quot;Maxim&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (all 2017).

===Cultural influence===
In November 2014, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences celebrated the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary with a special one-night screening at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California. In 2015, the film was selected by the United States Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Darabont responded: &quot;I can think of no greater honor than for &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; to be considered part of our country&#x27;s cinematic legacy.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; said that the word &quot;Shawshank&quot; could be used to instantly convey images of a prison.

The significant and enduring public appreciation for the film has often been difficult for critics to define. In an interview, Freeman said, &quot;About everywhere you go, people say, ″&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;—greatest movie I ever saw″&quot; and that such praise &quot;Just comes out of them&quot;. Robbins said, &quot;I swear to God, all over the world—all over the world—wherever I go, there are people who say, &#x27;That movie changed my life. In a separate interview, Stephen King said, &quot;If that isn&#x27;t the best [adaptation of my works], it&#x27;s one of the two or three best, and certainly, in moviegoers&#x27; minds, it&#x27;s probably the best because it generally rates at the top of these surveys they have of movies. ... I never expected anything to happen with it.&quot; In a 2014 &quot;Variety&quot; article, Robbins claimed that South African politician Nelson Mandela told him about his love for the film, while it has been cited as a source of inspiration by several sportsmen including Jonny Wilkinson (UK), Agustín Pichot (Argentina), Al Charron (Canada), and Dan Lyle (USA), and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. Gunton said he had encountered fans in Morocco, Australia, South America, Germany, France, and Bora Bora. Director Steven Spielberg said that the film was &quot;a chewing-gum movie—if you step on it, it sticks to your shoe&quot;. Speaking on the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary, Darabont said that older generations were sharing it with younger generations, contributing to its longevity.

It has been the number-one film on IMDb&#x27;s user-generated Top 250 since 2008, when it surpassed &quot;The Godfather&quot;, having remained at or near the top since the late 1990s. In the United Kingdom, readers of &quot;Empire&quot; voted the film as the best of the 1990s, the greatest film of all time in 2006, and it placed number four on &quot;Empire&quot;″s 2008 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot; and their 2017 list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Movies&quot;. In March 2011, the film was voted by BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra listeners as their favorite film of all time. It regularly appears on &quot;Empire&quot;″s top 100 films, was named the greatest film to not win the Academy Award for Best Picture in a 2013 poll by Sky UK (it lost to &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;), and ranked as Britain&#x27;s favorite film in a 2015 YouGov poll. When the British Film Institute analyzed the demographic breakdown of the YouGov poll, it noted that &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; was not the top-ranked film in any group, but was the only film to appear in the top 15 of every age group, suggesting it is able to connect with every polled age group, unlike &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; which fared better with younger voters, and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) with older voters.

A 2017 poll conducted by Gatwick Airport also identified the film as the fourth-best to watch while in flight. When English film critic Mark Kermode interviewed a host of United States moviegoers, they compared it to a &quot;religious experience&quot;. It was also voted as New Zealand&#x27;s favorite film in a 2015 poll. Lasting fan appreciation has led to it being considered one of the most beloved films of all time.

<text>The Residents are an American art collective and art rock band best known for their avant-garde music and multimedia works. Since their first official release, &quot;Meet the Residents&quot; (1974), they have released over 60 albums, numerous music videos and short films, three CD-ROM projects, and ten DVDs over the course of over half a century. They have undertaken seven major world tours and scored multiple films. Pioneers in exploring the potential of CD-ROM and similar technologies, the Residents have won several awards for their multimedia projects. They founded Ralph Records, a record label focusing on avant-garde music, in 1972.

Throughout the group&#x27;s existence, the individual members have ostensibly attempted to work anonymously, preferring to have attention focused on their art. Much speculation and rumor has focused on this aspect of the group. In public, they appear silent and costumed, often wearing eyeball helmets, top hats and tails—a costume now recognized as their signature iconography. In 2017, Hardy Fox, long known to be associated with the Residents, identified himself as the band&#x27;s co-founder and primary composer; he died in 2018.

==History==

===1965–1972: Origins and Residents Unincorporated===

The artists who became the Residents met in high school in Shreveport, Louisiana, in the early 1960s. Around 1965, they began making their first amateur home tape recordings and making art together with a number of friends. In 1966, intending to join the flourishing hippie movement, they headed west for San Francisco, but when their truck broke down in San Mateo, California, they decided to remain there.

While attempting to make a living, the group purchased crude recording equipment and began to refine their recording and editing skills, as well as photography, painting, and anything remotely to do with art that they could afford. The Residents have acknowledged the existence of at least two unreleased reel-to-reel items from this era, titled &quot;The Ballad of Stuffed Trigger&quot; and &quot;Rusty Coathangers for the Doctor&quot;. The Cryptic Corporation has confirmed that their archives contain many tapes dating back decades, but because they were recorded before the group officially became the Residents, the band did not consider them part of its discography. However, some of these recordings, along with their demo albums &quot;The Warner Bros. Album,&quot; and &quot;Baby Sex&quot;, would be released on the archival CD &quot;A Nickle If Your Dick&#x27;s This Big&quot; in 2019.

Word of the unnamed group&#x27;s experimentation spread, and in 1969 British guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Philip Lithman, later known as Snakefinger, began to participate with them. Around this time they also met the mysterious (and perhaps apocryphal) N. Senada, whom Lithman had picked up during an expedition in Bavaria. The two Europeans became great influences and life-long collaborators with the group.

In 1971, the group sent a reel-to-reel demo tape to Hal Halverstadt at Warner Bros., as he had signed Captain Beefheart, one of the group&#x27;s heroes, to the label. Halverstadt was not impressed with &quot;The Warner Bros. Album&quot;, but gave it an &quot;A for Ariginality&quot;. Because the band had not included a name in the return address, the rejection slip was addressed to &quot;Residents&quot;. The group decided to use this name, first becoming Residents Uninc., then shortening it to the current name.

The first known public performance of the Residents, Uninc. was at the Boarding House in San Francisco in 1971. The brief, guerrilla-style performance took the audience by surprise. A photo from it, showing Lithman playing violin with his pinky &quot;about to strike the violin like a snake&quot;, originated the stage name he used for the rest of his life, Snakefinger. Later in 1971, a second tape was completed called &quot;Baby Sex&quot;, featuring a long collage partially consisting of recordings from the Boarding House performance. The cover art for the tape box was a silk-screened copy of an old photo depicting a woman fellating a small child, an example of the extremely confrontational and deliberately puerile visual and lyrical style the group adopted during this period.

===1972–1980: &quot;Classic&quot; era===

====&quot;Santa Dog&quot;, &quot;Meet the Residents&quot;, &quot;Not Available&quot; &amp; &quot;The Third Reich &#x27;n Roll&quot; (1972–1976)====

In early 1972, the band left San Mateo and relocated to 20 Sycamore St, San Francisco; a studio they named &quot;El Ralpho&quot;, which boasted a completely open ground floor (seemingly ideal for a sound stage), allowing the group to expand their operations and also begin preliminary work on their most ambitious project up to that point, a full-length film entitled &quot;Vileness Fats&quot;, which consumed most of their attention for the next four years. Intended to be the first-ever long form music video, the Residents saw this project as an opportunity to create the ultimate cult film. After four years of filming (from 1972 to 1976) the project was reluctantly cancelled because of time, space, and monetary constraints. Fifteen hours of footage was shot for the project, yet only approximately 35 minutes of that footage has ever been released.

The group also formed Ralph Records at this time, as a small, independent label to release and promote their own work. In 1972, to inaugurate the new business, the group recorded and pressed the &quot;Santa Dog&quot; EP, their first recorded output to be released to the public. Designed to resemble a Christmas card from an insurance company, the EP consisted of two 7&quot; singles, one song on each side. The four songs were presented as being by four different bands (Ivory &amp; the Braineaters, Delta Nudes, the College Walkers, and Arf &amp; Omega featuring the Singing Lawnchairs), with only a small note on the interior of the gatefold sleeve mentioning the participation of &quot;Residents, Uninc.&quot;

They sent copies of &quot;Santa Dog&quot; to west coast radio stations with no response until Bill Reinhardt, program director of KBOO-FM in Portland, Oregon, received a copy and played it heavily on his show. Reinhardt met the Residents at their studio at 20 Sycamore St. in the summer of 1973 with the news of his broadcasts. The Residents gave Reinhardt exclusive access to all their recordings, including copies of the original masters of &quot;Stuffed Trigger&quot;, &quot;Baby Sex&quot;, and &quot;The Warner Bros. Album&quot;.

Throughout this point, the group had been manipulating old tapes they had collected and regularly recording jam sessions, and these recordings eventually became the group&#x27;s debut full-length album, &quot;Meet the Residents&quot;, which was released in 1974 on Ralph. To aid in promoting the group, Reinhardt was given 50 of the first 1,000 copies of &quot;Meet the Residents&quot;. Some were sent to friends, listeners and critics, and two dozen were left for sale on consignment at the Music Millennium record store, where they sat unsold for months. KBOO DJ Barry Schwam (a.k.a. Schwump, who also recorded with the Residents) promoted them on his program as well. Eventually, KBOO airplay attracted a cult following.Following the release of &quot;Meet the Residents&quot;, the group began working on a follow-up entitled &quot;Not Available&quot;. Following N. Senada&#x27;s theory of obscurity, the LP was recorded and compiled completely in private, and would not be released until the group had completely forgotten about its existence.

During breaks in the sessions for &quot;Vileness Fats&quot;, the group recorded their next project, entitled &quot;The Third Reich &#x27;n Roll&quot;, over the course of a year between October 1974 and October 1975. The album consisted of two side-long medleys of the band covering popular songs from 1950s and 1960s, whilst toying with the concept of the popularity of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll being comparable to that of the rise of Nazism in the 1930s. The resulting LP was released in 1976, and was the group&#x27;s first project to feature a music video, created by syncing an old video of the group performing with an edited version of &quot;Swastikas on Parade&quot;.

After &quot;the Third Reich &#x27;n Roll&quot;″s release, a group of enterprising friends and collaborators from their early days in San Mateo — Homer Flynn, Hardy Fox, Jay Clem and John Kennedy — also joined the group in San Francisco, forming what became the Cryptic Corporation to manage and represent the band. Clem became the band&#x27;s spokesman; Fox edited, produced and compiled the band&#x27;s increasingly prolific output; Flynn was already handling the group&#x27;s cover design and promotional art under the banner of Pore Know Graphics; and Kennedy took the role of &quot;President&quot; (admittedly a fairly empty title, as overall responsibilities were handled more or less equally by the four). The Cryptic Corporation took over the day-to-day operations of Ralph Records, and provided the band with an improved public relations platform.

Shortly after the introduction of the Cryptic Corporation, the Residents recorded their &quot;Satisfaction&quot; single, the B-side of which featured the Residents&#x27; first work with the ARP Odyssey, the first synthesizer owned by the group, purchased by the Cryptics.

====&quot;Eskimo&quot;, &quot;Fingerprince&quot;, &quot;Duck Stab&quot;, &amp; rise in popularity (1976–1979)====
Following &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, the group began recording &quot;Eskimo&quot; in April 1976; a concept album based upon the Theory of Phonetic Organisation that suggests that music should not be confined to chords and structures, but instead should simply be a collection of fascinating noises. The album featured acoustic soundscapes inspired by Inuit culture, whilst parodying American ignorance of other cultures. The &quot;Eskimo&quot; sessions lasted many years, and featured many divergences, the first of which, in November 1976, resulted in &quot;Fingerprince&quot;, a collection of unused recordings from &quot;the Third Reich &#x27;n Roll&quot;, &quot;Not Available&quot;, and &quot;Eskimo&quot; sessions.

&quot;Fingerprince&quot; received considerable coverage in the British press, and was the first LP by the group to receive any critical attention when Jon Savage reviewed the album and its two predecessors favorably for the December 31st issue of Sounds magazine. This review gained the group considerable attention, with many of their previously unsold mail-order items being sold seemingly overnight. The sudden success of &quot;Fingerprince&quot; and its predecessors caused the group to briefly halt production on &quot;Eskimo&quot; to create something more appealing to their newfound audience.

The Residents followed up &quot;Fingerprince&quot; with their &quot;Duck Stab!&quot; EP – their most accessible release up to that point. This EP got the band some attention from the press (namely &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Sounds&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;), and was followed in 1978 by the &quot;Duck Stab/Buster &amp; Glen&quot; album, which paired the EP with a similar, concurrently recorded EP which had not been released separately. The group then continued work on &quot;Eskimo&quot;, which proved a very difficult project, marked by many conflicts between the band and their management which led to a number of delays in the release date.

The sudden attention afforded to them by the success of the &quot;Duck Stab!&quot; EP and &quot;Satisfaction&quot; single required an album release as soon as possible to help fund the band&#x27;s spiraling recording costs, and to meet the demand for new Residents material. This forced the release of the band&#x27;s long-shelved &quot;second album&quot; &quot;Not Available&quot; in 1978. The Residents were not bothered by this deviation from the original plan not to release the album, as the 1978 release ultimately did not affect the philosophical conditions under which it was originally recorded.

&quot;Eskimo&quot; was finally released in 1979 to much acclaim, even making it to the final list for nominations for a Grammy award in 1980, although the album wasn&#x27;t nominated. Rather than being songs in the orthodox sense, the compositions on &quot;Eskimo&quot; sounded like &quot;live-action stories&quot; without dialogue. The cover art of &quot;Eskimo&quot; also presents the first instance of the group wearing eyeball masks and tuxedos, which was later considered by many to be the group&#x27;s signature costume. The Residents had only intended to wear these costumes for the cover of &quot;Eskimo&quot;, but adopted the costumes in the longer term as it provided them with a unique and recognisable image.

The group followed &quot;Eskimo&quot; with &quot;Commercial Album&quot; in 1980. The LP featured 40 songs, each exactly one minute in length. Around this time, two short films were made in collaboration with Graeme Whifler: &quot;One Minute Movies&quot;, consisting of four music videos for tracks from the &quot;Commercial Album&quot;; and a video for &quot;Hello Skinny&quot; from the &quot;Duck Stab&quot; LP. Created at a time when MTV (and what later became known as &quot;music video&quot; in general) was in its infancy, the group&#x27;s videos were in heavy rotation since they were among the few music videos available to broadcasters.

===1981–1990: New technology and live performances===

====&quot;Mark of the Mole&quot; &amp; The Mole Show (1981–1983)====

The Residents&#x27; follow up to &quot;Commercial Album&quot; was &quot;Mark of the Mole&quot;, released in 1981. The album was a reaction to the group feeling betrayed by a suddenly disinterested music press.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Mark of the Mole&quot;, the Residents purchased one of the first ever E-mu Emulator samplers, number #00005 specifically. The instrument was revolutionary for the band, as the sampling capacities of the keyboard not only allowed them to recreate instruments the members were not able to play, but also gave them the opportunity to create their meticulously crafted studio sound in a live setting. The first album the band recorded using the emulator was &quot;The Tunes of Two Cities&quot;, the second part of the Mole Trilogy, which was nearly entirely recorded using the Emulator.

Following the release of &quot;Cities&quot; The Residents also released the EP &quot;Intermission&quot;. Then they started rehearsing for a possible live show, eventually developing their first touring project, the Mole Show, a theatrical retelling of their &quot;Mark of the Mole&quot; album. The band debuted the show with a test performance, on April 10, 1982, before a tour of California in October, and a European tour throughout mid 1983. The show featured Penn Jillette as the narrator, playing a similar role as he had previously done with the Ralph Records 10th Anniversary radio special.

A third leg, featuring dates in New York, was booked, but had to be cancelled after one performance due to lack of funding. Following the Mole Show, the band was broke, and as such attempted to recoup some of their losses with several archival releases, including a collection of outtakes called &quot;Residue&quot; in 1983, and a VHS containing recordings from the Mole Show as well as a newly scored edit of &quot;Vileness Fats&quot; footage.

====The American Composers Series, 13th Anniversary Show, and the end of Ralph (1984–1987)====
Deciding to take a break from part three of the Mole Trilogy, the Residents began a new project entitled the &quot;American Composers Series&quot;, a planned series of 10 albums which would pay tribute to pop artists and instrumental composers from the United States. The first result of this pairing was &quot;George &amp; James&quot;, featuring the music of George Gershwin and James Brown. Following the release of &quot;George &amp; James&quot;, the Residents finally abandoned part three of the Mole Trilogy, choosing instead to record a fourth entry entitled &quot;The Big Bubble&quot;, featuring very stripped-down instrumentation in order to portray a fictional garage rock band. No further entries into the Mole Trilogy have been recorded, and the project is considered abandoned.

When &quot;The Big Bubble&quot; was released in Japan by Wave Records, it was an unquestioned success, its popularity resulting in Wave funding a two-week tour of Japan for the group in October 1985. The tour was successful, and re-ignited the group&#x27;s interest in creating live performances. As a result, they eventually embarked on their 13th Anniversary world tour, ranging from 1985 to 1987, with Snakefinger playing electric guitar. As for studio work, the group eventually released their second entry in the American Composers series, &quot;Stars &amp; Hank Forever&quot;, featuring the music of Hank Williams and John Philip Sousa. Their version of the Williams song &quot;Kaw-liga&quot; was particularly successful in the emerging club scene.

Due to licensing costs and the emerging CD format, the American Composers series was later abandoned. &quot;Stars &amp; Hank Forever&quot; was the last Residents project Snakefinger played on, as he died of a heart attack in July 1987.

Following the release of the &quot;13th Anniversary Show&quot; LP in 1986 and a cover of &quot;Hit the Road Jack&quot; in 1987, the Cryptic Corporation resigned control of Ralph Records over to Tom &amp; Sheenah Timony, and the Residents signed to Rykodisc. Tom and Sheenah later turned Ralph into a new label, T.E.C. Tones, and established the Residents&#x27; official fan club from 1988 to 1993: UWEB (Uncle Willie&#x27;s Eyeball Buddies).

====&quot;God in Three Persons&quot; and &quot;Cube E&quot; (1987–1990)====
After two compilation CDs titled &quot;Heaven?&quot; and &quot;Hell!&quot;, the Residents&#x27; first new project for Ryko was titled &quot;God in Three Persons&quot;, an hour-long poem in the form of a spoken-word rock opera. This was the first new Residents album to be released on CD, and the last Residents project to be entirely recorded on analog tape, as the group moved on to MIDI technology; their first venture into MIDI was scoring episodes for &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; in 1987. Despite initially mixed critical and commercial reaction, &quot;God in Three Persons&quot; today is considered one of the group&#x27;s masterworks.

On November 18, 1987, at a party in Amsterdam for Boudisque Records, the Residents&#x27; European label, they premiered a new work titled &quot;Buckaroo Blues&quot;, a suite of cowboy songs. After a choreographed TELE5 appearance in April 1988, this suite was coupled with a second one titled &quot;Black Barry&quot;, a suite of &quot;black music&quot; (that is, blues and gospel), and formed the first act of the Residents&#x27; next touring project, &quot;Cube-E: The History of American Music in 3EZ Pieces&quot;. After the show&#x27;s debut in New York, on July 21, 1989, it was decided to add a third act consisting of covers of Elvis Presley songs, completing the equation &quot;Cowboy music + Black music = Rock and roll.&quot; The show took on a much more theatrical approach than the 13th Anniversary tour, with elaborate set designs, costumes, lighting and choreography. &quot;Cube-E&quot; toured from September 1989 to November 1990, and was successful, both critically and financially.

A studio version of the third act was also released and titled &quot;The King &amp; Eye&quot;. The album was recorded at Different Fur Studios and released on Enigma Records around the time the tour began in September 1989. Further television work was also being done for MTV, with the Residents scoring and doing voice work for &quot;Liquid Television&quot; and the Henry Selick-directed pilot &quot;Slow Bob in the Lower Dimensions.&quot;

===1990–1997: Multimedia projects===
====&quot;Freak Show&quot;, CD-ROMs, and the 25th anniversary (1991–1997)====
Recordings for a new studio album were worked on during breaks in the Cube-E tour, and shortly after the tour, &quot;Freak Show&quot; was released. An album detailing the lives and personalities of fictional carnival freaks, the &quot;Freak Show&quot; project spawned many other iterations, such as a graphic novel in collaboration with comic artists from Dark Horse, such as Brian Bolland and Matt Howarth, and a promotional video created with the help of New York artist John Sanborn, which also presented a music video for &quot;Harry the Head&quot;, animated by computer artist Jim Ludtke; both artists went on to collaborate with the Residents on many further projects.

A partnership with Voyager in 1992 allowed the Residents to develop a laserdisc titled &quot;Twenty Twisted Questions&quot; to celebrate their twentieth anniversary. Along with this laserdisc, a studio album was recorded, titled &quot;Our Finest Flowers&quot;. Not quite a &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation, many tracks on the album borrow elements from previous songs in the Residents&#x27; catalog.

The Residents&#x27; collaboration with Jim Ludtke resulted in the creation of the &quot;Freak Show&quot; and &quot;Bad Day on the Midway&quot; CD-ROMs. Both of these projects featured many other collaborations with visual artists, including returning collaborators from the &quot;Freak Show&quot; graphic novel, such as Richard Sala and Dave McKean. The Residents enjoyed quite a bit of critical and financial success with these CD-ROMs, winning several industry awards. However, during early development stages for a third CD-ROM, titled &quot;I Murdered Mommy&quot;, their distributor Inscape was forced to dissolve due to oversaturation and obsoletion of the CD-ROM market.

Despite majorly occupying themselves with CD-ROM development, the Residents still remained musically active, releasing an enhanced CD album titled &quot;Gingerbread Man&quot; (an observation and study of nine fictional characters) in 1994, and scoring the Discovery Channel documentary series &quot;Hunters&quot; in 1995. &quot;Freak Show&quot; also got a live adaptation in November 1995, at the Archa Theater in Prague. While the Residents did act as music and stage directors for the show, they did not actually perform; the music was conducted and performed by Czech band Už Jsme Doma, while actors and dancers played their roles on stage.

&quot;Freak Show Live&quot; was the last iteration of the &quot;Freak Show&quot; brand; while a DVD was being developed in 2003, the early death of animator Jim Ludtke immediately halted the project.

Around this time, singer/performer Molly Harvey was recruited to work with the group. While her first appearance in a Residents project was the &quot;Gingerbread Man&quot; album, she officially became a member of the group in 1997, with a one-off performance at the Popkomm festival in Germany titled &quot;Disfigured Night&quot;. This performance later became the second act of a special 25th anniversary show at the Fillmore in San Francisco, in October 1997.

=== 1998–2009: New collaborators / The 2nd millennium ===
==== Return to touring: &quot;Wormwood&quot;, &quot;Icky Flix&quot;, and &quot;Demons Dance Alone&quot; (1998–2005) ====
Due to the collapse of the CD-ROM market, a collective decision was made to tour again. While keeping up with their theatrical tendencies by regular use of costumes and stage props, the Residents also performed and recorded with a team of guest musicians: the aforementioned Molly Harvey (vocals), Nolan Cook (guitar), Carla Fabrizio (arrangements and vocals), Toby Dammit (drums), and later on in 2002, Eric Drew Feldman (keyboards). Some of the band members, notably Feldman and Fabrizio, went on to collaborate with the group on numerous other projects up until the present time, while Cook eventually became a full-time band member. Fabrizio&#x27;s connections with the Balinese gamelan ensemble Gamelan Sekar Jaya allowed for occasional collaborations between the two groups during this period.

The first tour with this new band formation was for the 1998 album , a collection of songs depicting typically gruesome stories from the Holy Bible, mostly from the Old Testament. While the studio album only featured Harvey, Fabrizio and Dammit as guests (with Dammit only taking occasional vocal duties), the band was mostly fully formed by the time of the show&#x27;s live debut at the Fillmore in October 1998. The Wormwood show toured up to July 1999, and featured drastically different arrangements of songs from the album, mostly darker and heavier, as well as new or unused material related to the concept. Some of these arrangements were recorded for a studio album titled &quot;&quot;, and a DVD of the live show was released in 2005.

The same band formation later toured to promote the Residents&#x27; first DVD, &quot;Icky Flix&quot;, a compilation of most of the group&#x27;s music videos, as well as new animated videos and a re-recorded soundtrack, to celebrate the group&#x27;s upcoming 30th anniversary. These re-recorded arrangements were performed on the show as their corresponding videos played from the DVD onto a screen.

On the event of the September 11 attacks, the Residents were still touring &quot;Icky Flix&quot; in Europe. The resulting fear and anxiety caused by the attacks resulted in the recording of &quot;Demons Dance Alone&quot; in 2002. While not a direct response to the events, the songs on the album portrayed the negative emotions felt by the group and its individual members; this was reflected in the album&#x27;s subsequent tour, which took place from October 2002 to September 2003. The group&#x27;s next major album, the 2005 &quot;Animal Lover&quot;, contained lyrics of a similarly tragic nature, although in a more abstract manner. The album also contained a booklet with stories which presented the songs from the point of view of animals. &quot;Animal Lover&quot; was also the first Residents album to be released on the Mute label, which was solely responsible for the Residents&#x27; major releases until 2008.

&quot;Animal Lover&quot; is currently the last Residents album to feature Molly Harvey, who moved to Atlanta to live with her husband at the time. Her last appearance as a member of the Residents was at a small series of shows titled &quot;The Way We Were&quot; at the &quot;What is Music?&quot; festival in Australia. The show&#x27;s setlist was a career retrospective much in the style of the 13th Anniversary tour, the last time the Residents had toured Australia.

===2005–2009: The &quot;Storyteller&quot; era===
====Narrative albums and &quot;The Bunny Boy&quot; (2006–2009)====
Due to the increasing numbers of illegal downloads of music on the Internet, which considerably decreased product sales, the Residents attempted a new artistic medium: the radio drama, in the form of a paid podcast distributed through Apple&#x27;s iTunes service. This podcast, titled &quot;The River of Crime&quot; (a first-person tale of an individual&#x27;s obsession with crime and criminals), ran for five weekly episodes in 2006 before its cancellation due to inconveniences surrounding the podcast&#x27;s promotion on iTunes, thereby discouraging further production.

Aside from &quot;Animal Lover&quot;, the group&#x27;s partnership with Mute produced three more albums: &quot;Tweedles&quot; in 2006 (a first-person character study of a sexually successful yet emotionally unavailable vampiric figure), &quot;The Voice of Midnight&quot; in 2007 (a retelling of the E.T.A. Hoffmann story &quot;Der Sandmann&quot;), and &quot;The Bunny Boy&quot; in 2008 (a first-person narrative and character study of the titular Bunny in search of his missing brother).

While &quot;Tweedles&quot; and &quot;The Voice of Midnight&quot; have not yet been developed further (aside from instrumental releases such as &quot;The UGHS!&quot; in 2009), &quot;The Bunny Boy&quot; proved a very accessible concept. A YouTube video series of the same name was done to promote and further elaborate on the project. The series was partially interactive; fans could communicate with Bunny via e-mail, and some of the interactions may or may not have altered the course of the series&#x27; plot (a book containing some of Bunny&#x27;s correspondence was published by Bandits Mages in 2019). Soon afterwards the album was toured from October to December 2008. A second season of the video series was shown in 2009, somewhat officially ending the project.

===2010–2016: Randy, Chuck &amp; Bob===

Making a decision to shift focus from studio work to touring, and to enhance their show&#x27;s portability, the Residents changed their live band to a &quot;power trio&quot; formation, and in a sort of meta stunt, appear to &quot;unmask&quot; themselves as lead singer / frontman &quot;Randy,&quot; composer / keyboardist &quot;Charles &#x27;Chuck&#x27; Bobuck,&quot; and guitarist Nolan Cook as &quot;Bob&quot; – although all three band members were still costumed: &quot;Randy&quot; donned an old man mask and wore an overcoat with oversized red tie and shoes; &quot;Chuck&quot; and &quot;Bob&quot; wore red jackets, special goggles and fake dreadlocks. There was also mention of a fourth band member, drummer &quot;Carlos,&quot; who allegedly had left the music business to take care of his mother in Mexico; however, despite being credited as singer in the group&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Coochie Brake&quot;, there is no further evidence of &quot;Carlos&quot; having ever been a real band member.

This new band formation debuted in the &quot;Talking Light&quot; tour, which ran from January 2010 to April 2011. While the setlist once again consisted of assorted songs from the band&#x27;s repertoire (although with greatly reworked arrangements), the show also featured newly written &quot;ghost stories,&quot; in which a video of a narrator telling said stories was projected onto the stage while the band performed in a somewhat improvisational manner. These &quot;ghost stories&quot; were loosely threaded by the presence of television, TV commercials, and industrialized products such as Oscar Mayer hot dogs or Betty Crocker Pudding Roll-ups – although these weren&#x27;t endorsements; these products were simply a minor element integrated into the stories, not unlike product placement. In between certain songs, &quot;Randy&quot; also spoke to the audience, introducing the band and later describing his own history with supernatural appearances, and his subsequent fear of mirrors. The tour was financially successful, and the band continued to perform in this formation with only minor changes in stage and costume design.

In the next couple of years, &quot;Randy&quot; took on an increased role as frontman of the band, starting a &quot;personal&quot; Tumblr blog where he wrote mostly about life experiences and trivia regarding the Residents&#x27; history, as well as promoting his &quot;solo&quot; show, &quot;Sam&#x27;s Enchanted Evening&quot;, which was presented in various incarnations between June 2010 and March 2012 with collaborators Joshua Raoul Brody and Carla Fabrizio. More akin to musical theater than a concert, the show focused on the titular Sam&#x27;s life story, with the singer alternating between monologues and cover performances of various songs that were important in his life. During this period, the Residents also collaborated with Belgian dancer/choreographer Grace Ellen Barkey from Needcompany, composing the music for a show titled &quot;Mush-Room&quot; in 2013.

In 2014, &quot;Randy&quot; maintained a series of vlogs with the help of director Don Hardy, titled &quot;In My Room&quot; and later &quot;Randyland&quot;, elaborating further on his experiences, both with the Residents and with events in his personal life. The blog currently has been inactive since January 6, 2019. Composer &quot;Charles Bobuck&quot; also maintained a series of personal writings on the Residents&#x27; website titled &quot;The Test Tube of Tomorrow&quot;, and occasionally release music under this name, usually material deemed unfitting for the Residents concept. Bobuck&#x27;s writings were much more detailed and biographical, and his music much more abstract, often referred to as &quot;contraptions&quot; rather than compositions.

The group&#x27;s 40th anniversary tour, &quot;The Wonder of Weird&quot;, also elaborated on the &quot;Randy, Chuck &amp; Bob&quot; concept, although guised as an anthology show – lead singer Randy once more spoke to the audience between songs, briefly discussing the band&#x27;s history as he slowly grew depressed with the state of the band and his own life, occasionally leaving the stage and prompting the remaining band members to improvise. The show toured from January to May 2013.

This band formation toured once more in 2014 with a show called &quot;Shadowland&quot;, retrofittingly subtitled &quot;part three of the &#x27;Randy, Chuck &amp; Bob&#x27; trilogy.&quot; Initially a one-off week of performances in Europe, the show was eventually brought back in March 2015, coinciding with the premiere of the &quot;Theory of Obscurity&quot; film – a documentary on the history of the band, directed by Don Hardy and produced by Barton Bishoff and Josh Keppel – at the SXSW Film Festival. This show was the last time &quot;Charles Bobuck&quot; performed with the band, as he decided to quit the touring business due to increasing health problems. He eventually quit the Residents altogether in 2016, revealing his identity as Hardy Fox of the Cryptic Corporation, and continued to make music as a solo artist until his death in October 2018.

&quot;Shadowland&quot; then toured from August 2015 to July 2016, with Eric Drew Feldman (as Bobuck&#x27;s cousin &quot;Rico&quot;) replacing Fox on keyboards, as well as production on future Residents projects. The show was mostly similar to the previous two tours, with a setlist of various reworked songs from the group&#x27;s repertoire, and occasional video interludes in the vein of &quot;Talking Light&quot;, with different characters discussing their experiences with birth, reincarnation and near-death.

=== 2017–present: &quot;Metal Meat &amp; Bone&quot;, &quot;Triple Trouble&quot; and the &quot;pREServed&quot; series===
In March 2017, the Residents presented their new lineup, advertised as &quot;The Real Residents&quot;: &quot;Tyrone&quot; on vocals, &quot;Eekie&quot; (Nolan Cook) on guitar, &quot;Erkie&quot; (Eric Feldman) on keyboards, and &quot;Cha Cha&quot; on drums and percussion. Shortly after a preview of their &quot;In Between Dreams&quot; tour in Japan, the group released their first studio album since &quot;Coochie Brake&quot;, titled &quot;The Ghost of Hope&quot;, describing real train wreck stories from the 19th and early 20th century. The album was released on Cherry Red Records, the Residents&#x27; current label, and promoted with a single, and their first music video since 2001&#x27;s &quot;Icky Flix&quot; – &quot;Rushing Like a Banshee,&quot; directed by John Sanborn. Although &quot;The Ghost of Hope&quot; was not toured, the Residents played both sides of the &quot;Rushing Like a Banshee&quot; single on the &quot;In Between Dreams&quot; show, which ran from October 2017 up to February 2019 and followed a loose theme, much like &quot;Shadowland&quot;, this time of dreams.

During the tour, the Residents worked on new projects. Their next album, &quot;Intruders&quot;, released in October 2018, was advertised along with the &quot;I am a Resident!&quot; concept, which started as a sort of officially endorsed tribute project: fans would submit their interpretations of Residents songs, and the group would collect their favorites into an album. After the number of submissions vastly exceeded their expectations, the group decided to change the project into a type of collage, even recording segments and overdubs of their own. The final album was released to contributors in May 2018, and worldwide in August 2018.

In July 2018, the Residents also published their second novel (the first being a novelization of their game &quot;Bad Day on the Midway&quot; in 2012). The book, entitled &quot;The Brick-Eaters&quot;, was described as &quot;an absurdist buddy movie story featuring a very tall internet content screener teaming up with an aging career criminal whose primary companions are an oxygen bottle and a .44 Magnum&quot;.

The group also began their ongoing &quot;pREServed&quot; reissue series in January 2018 – deluxe editions of the major albums in the band&#x27;s discography, containing brand new remasters and unreleased recordings from the band&#x27;s archives, previously in the care of Hardy Fox before he quit the group.

During the &quot;In Between Dreams&quot; tour, the Residents also previewed songs from their &quot;upcoming blues album,&quot; which was eventually titled &quot;Metal, Meat &amp; Bone: The Songs of Dyin&#x27; Dog&quot;. The premise of the album was to present the long-lost recordings of a fictional albino blues singer named Alvin Snow, also known as &quot;Dyin&#x27; Dog.&quot; The Residents would present the original &quot;Dyin&#x27; Dog demos&quot; on one disc and their own interpretations of the same songs on another disc. The album was released in July 2020 and promoted with two music videos for the Residents&#x27; new versions of &quot;Bury My Bone&quot; and &quot;DIE! DIE! DIE!&quot;, the latter being sung by alternative rock musician and Pixies frontman Black Francis.
&quot;Metal, Meat &amp; Bone&quot; was promoted during the Residents&#x27; &#x27;Dog Stab!&#x27; tour in 2021 (following numerous cancellations and postponements on account of the COVID-19 pandemic) – the show, currently marketed as &quot;the 50th anniversary show,&quot; presented songs from the new album as well as new arrangements of songs from their 1978 album, &quot;Duck Stab / Buster &amp; Glen&quot;. The band will continue this tour with dates currently set for 2023.

To celebrate the group&#x27;s 50th anniversary, a retrospective coffee table book, &quot;The Residents: A Sight for Sore Eyes, Vol. 1&quot; by author Aaron Tanner, was announced. The book contains never-before-seen photos, quotes from celebrities influenced by the group, and a 7&quot; single dating to the group&#x27;s &quot;Not Available&quot; era.

On May 13 and 14 2022, the Residents performed their &quot;God In Three Persons&quot; album live two more times, at the Presidio Theatre in San Francisco. The Residents presented themselves as a six-piece band at this show, with visuals created by John Sanborn. The visuals featured videos starring Jiz Lee, who portrays the twins.

The Residents&#x27; film &quot;Triple Trouble&quot; debuted in Chicago on July 29, 2022. It is composed of new footage shot during the COVID-19 pandemic and includes material from the Vileness Fats project.

On January 26, 2023, The Residents embarked on their 50th anniversary tour. The tour features selections from Duck Stab, Metal, Meat &amp; Bone, and &#x27;an eclectic collection of fan favorites.&#x27; On US dates of the tour, the show was opened with their feature film &quot;Triple Trouble&quot;. It is expected to conclude on April 19. The tour saw the group perform a free webcast show at &quot;WXPN&quot; on March 31.

==Identity==
In the group&#x27;s early days, many rumors circulated about its membership. As the cover art of &quot;Meet the Residents&quot; was a parody of the Beatles&#x27; 1964 North American release, &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot;, rumors circulated that the Residents were actually the Beatles, even specifically naming George Harrison. Many other rumors have come and gone over the years, one being that &#x27;60s experimental band Cromagnon shared members with the band. Les Claypool, frontman of rock band Primus, and Gerald Casale of new wave band Devo claimed to have been accused of being members of the band; and Mark Mothersbaugh (also of Devo) is alleged to have played keyboards during the band&#x27;s 13th-anniversary tour.

Since the late 1970s, much of the speculation about the members&#x27; identities has involved the group&#x27;s management team, the Cryptic Corporation. It was formed in 1976 as a corporation in California by Jay Clem, Homer Flynn, Hardy W. Fox, and John Kennedy. All but Fox have denied having been band members. Clem and Kennedy left the Corporation in 1982. The Residents members do not grant interviews, although Flynn, Fox, and Clem have conducted interviews on behalf of the group.

In a July 2017 newsletter, Fox confirmed that Jay Clem&#x27;s voice was featured uncredited on &quot;Whoopy Snorp&quot; and that The Residents often used his voice on early recordings to add a sense of variety. Fox insisted that as Clem became more invested in running Ralph Records, he became less interested in The Residents&#x27; studio work and that the &quot;Not Available&quot; sessions would have been his last time in the studio - although Fox seemed unsure if Clem was involved in the production of that album at all.

Nolan Cook, a prominent collaborator in the band&#x27;s live and studio work (and a live member of I Am Spoonbender) denied in an interview that Fox and Flynn were the Residents. However, some consider Cook himself a member of the band, as he is known to wear the same head coverings as the group in live shows, and wore the trademark eyeball mask on the Wormwood Tour. He also played the part of &quot;Bob&quot; during the &quot;Randy&quot;, &quot;Chuck&quot;, and &quot;Bob&quot; trilogy of shows.

William Poundstone, author of the &quot;Big Secrets&quot; books, compared voiceprints of a Flynn lecture with those of spoken word segments from the Residents discography in his book &quot;Biggest Secrets&quot;. He concluded, &quot;The similarities in the spectograms second the convincing subjective impression that the voices are identical&quot;, and that &quot;it is possible that the creative core of the Residents is the duo of Flynn and Fox.&quot; A subset of that belief is that Flynn is the lyricist and that Fox writes the music. The online database of the performance rights organization BMI (of which the Residents and their publishing company, Pale Pachyderm Publishing [Warner-Chappell] have been members for their entire careers) lists Flynn and Fox as the composers of all original Residents songs, including pre-1974 songs from the &quot;Residents Unincorporated&quot; years.

Simon Reynolds wrote in his book &quot;Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984&quot; that &quot;the Residents and their representatives were one and the same,&quot; and elaborated further on one of his blogs, stating that &quot;this was something that anybody who had any direct dealings with Ralph figured out sooner rather than later.&quot; Reynolds quotes Helios Creed, who identifies the Residents as a keyboardist named &quot;H,&quot; a singer named &quot;Homer,&quot; and &quot;this other guy called John.&quot; - Creed&#x27;s only involvement with The Residents was contributing three tracks to the Ralph Records compilation &quot;Subterranean Modern&quot; in 1979 with his group Chrome; the only group on the compilation to not be signed to Ralph Records. Peter Principle of Tuxedomoon, signed to Ralph between 1979 and 1984, claimed that he and others &quot;eventually figured out that the guy doing the graphics and the engineer in the studio were, in fact, the Residents.&quot;Cryptic openly admits the group&#x27;s artwork is done by Flynn (among others) under various names that, put together, become &quot;Pornographics&quot;, but the pseudonym is rarely spelled the same way twice (examples: Porno Graphics, Pore No Graphix, Pore-Know Graphics); and that Fox is the sound engineer – meaning that he is the main producer, engineer, mixer, and editor of all their recordings. (Since 1976, all of the Residents&#x27; recordings have listed their producer as the Cryptic Corporation, presumably meaning Fox in particular.)

From 2010 to 2016, the Residents referred to themselves in concert as the characters &quot;Randy Rose&quot;, &quot;Chuck Bobuck&quot;, and &quot;Bob&quot;, and referred to a former member of the band, &quot;Carlos&quot;, who left the group following a disagreement with &quot;Randy&quot;. There is speculation that &quot;Carlos&quot; is Carlos Cadona. Better known by his stage name, &quot;6025,&quot; Cadona was in the original lineup of the Dead Kennedys and appears on a live album by Snakefinger. &quot;Carlos&quot; may also refer to Carla Fabrizio, a touring member of the Residents from 1998 to 2008.

&quot;Bob&quot; is speculated to be guitarist and longtime collaborator Nolan Cook, as Cook is often the only credited collaborator on the &quot;Randy, Chuck, &amp; Bob&quot; albums, such as &quot;Talking Light: Bimbo&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Shadowland&quot;.

&quot;Chuck&quot;, or &quot;Charles Bobuck&quot;, was the group&#x27;s primary songwriter; he also released a series of solo albums (or &quot;contraptions&quot;) under this name during the &quot;Randy, Chuck and Bob&quot; era. Chuck retired from live performance due to ill health in 2015, and ultimately retired from the Residents altogether following the release of the &quot;Theory of Obscurity&quot; documentary film. Eric Drew Feldman replaced him and performed under the name &quot;Rico&quot; from 2015 to 2016.

In the liner notes featured on the 2020 reissue of Phillip Perkins&#x27; &quot;King of the World&quot; album, Perkins confirms that he was a member of the Residents during their &quot;Assorted Secrets&quot; lineup, best known for &quot;The Mole Show&quot;. On his BayImproviser biography Perkins states that he worked closely with the Residents between 1979 and 1984. He had previously been credited as the lighting designer on the Mole Show Roxy LP, and as engineer on original versions of &quot;Stars &amp; Hank Forever&quot;, as well as on reissues of &quot;The Tune of Two Cities&quot; and &quot;The Snakey Wake&quot;. Considering this, his time working with the group roughly would have been from 1979 to 1987. In a 2021 interview, Perkins nonchalantly referred to his fellow players on The Mole Show as &#x27;H&#x27; and &#x27;Homer&#x27; on Emulators. and &#x27;Tom&#x27; on Roland Jupiter 8.

===Hardy Fox===
In October 2017, former Residents manager Hardy Fox identified himself as both the anonymous primary composer and producer for the Residents as well as the pseudonymous Charles Bobuck. Fox was born in Longview, Texas, where his father worked in the oil industry; his mother was a nurse. The family moved several times, and Fox graduated from Rayville High School in Louisiana in 1963. He then studied art and business at Louisiana Tech University, where he met Homer Flynn, and graduated in 1967.

In September 2018, Fox added to his website the dates &quot;1945–2018&quot;, although he was known to be alive (but unwell) after the dates were published. Fox died on October 30, 2018, from brain cancer, aged 73. He was identified in obituaries as the co-founder and primary composer of the Residents. On December 14, 2018, the official Residents mailing list acknowledged Fox as &quot;engineer, producer and sometime composer of much of the Residents’ best-loved work&quot;.

=== Frequent collaborators ===
Since their inception, the Residents have had a number of credited collaborators. These collaborators, despite not being anonymous, can be considered by some definition Residents.

==== 1971–1975 ====
During the band&#x27;s formative years, its main members consisted of &#x27;the Singing Resident&#x27;, Hardy Fox, jazz pianist James Whittaker, and bassist Bob Tagney, the latter two credited as writers on the 2018 LP release of &quot;The Warner Brothers&quot; album. This lineup, along with Snakefinger, who joined the group in Autumn of 1971, are credited as members of &#x27;&quot;The Delta Nudes,&quot;&#x27; (a retroactive group name applied to recordings involving members of The Residents made prior to 1974,) on the 2013 demos compilation, &quot;The Delta Nudes&#x27; Greatest Hiss&quot;. Bob Tagney and James Whittaker are also credited on the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Meet the Residents;&quot; Whittaker, as the pianist on &quot;Spotted Pinto Bean&quot;, and Tagney as bassist on &quot;Infant Tango&quot;. Female vocalist Pamela Zeibak was also one of the Residents&#x27; frequent collaborators during this period, with credits on &quot;The Delta Nudes Greatest Hiss&quot;, &quot;Meet the Residents&quot;, &quot;The Third Reich &#x27;n Roll&quot;, and &quot;Fingerprince&quot;. She also performed vocals on &#x27;Spotted Pinto Bean&#x27; at the group&#x27;s debut live performance in 1976.

Prior that performance, Joshua Raoul Brody began working with the Residents after he was invited to the set of their film &quot;Vileness Fats&quot;. After this, he began working with the group anonymously by arranging the backing vocals on their &quot;Satisfaction&quot; single. In the 1980s, Brody began to receive credit for his work with the Residents under the pseudonym &quot;Raoul N. Di Seimbote&quot;, but by 1987, was using his birth name. Brody most recently worked with the Residents on their 2023 &#x27;Secret&#x27; live show.

==== 1976–1987 ====
In early 1976, Snakefinger returned to the US and continued his collaborations with the Residents. Snakefinger was credited as a general performer on all Residents albums (minus &quot;Not Available&quot;) from &quot;Fingerprince&quot; to &quot;Commercial Album&quot;. During this period, he also released two solo albums, which The Residents co-wrote and co-produced. In 1981 he began writing and recording material without their involvement, and only appeared on a small handful of tracks on their albums from &quot;The Tunes of Two Cities&quot; to &quot;Stars &amp; Hank Forever&quot;. Lithman also toured with the Residents as an unmasked guest from October 1985 to January 1987, before his death on July 1, 1987.

Also in 1976, drummer Don Jakovich started working with the band, making credited appearances on &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, &quot;Fingerprince&quot;, Snakefinger&#x27;s &quot;Chewing Hides the Sound&quot;, and &quot;Commercial Album&quot;. He also performed with them in costume as part of their June 1976 live performance.

Following the disbanding of Henry Cow, former members Chris Cutler and Fred Frith began making appearances on Residents material as drummer and guitarist respectively. Frith first appeared with the Residents on the &quot;Subterranean Modern&quot; compilation, and Cutler on the &quot;Eskimo&quot; album. The following year both featured on &quot;Commercial Album&quot;, with Frith receiving the credit of &#x27;Extra Hard Working Guest Musician&#x27;.

Nessie Lessons, the wife of Hardy Fox, began to make appearances on Residents releases between 1980 and 1983. Initially as an uncredited female vocalist, Lessons was first credited on &quot;The Tunes of Two Cities&quot;, toured with the band from 1982 to 1983. Her final work as a regular collaborator was on the song &quot;HellNo&quot;, for the soundtrack to the 1984 film &quot;The Census Taker,&quot; and was later featured on &quot;Our Finest Flowers&quot;.

For The Mole Show, the Residents employed four dancers: Kathleen French, Carol Werner LeMaitre, Sarah McLennan Walker and Chris Van Ralte. Carol LeMaitre and Sarah McLennan went on to portray two Residents on stage during the 13th Anniversary Show and also dance in &quot;Cube-E&quot;.

==== 1987–1993 ====
Starting in 1987, the Residents began working with female vocalist Laurie Amat, who went on to become the Residents&#x27; primary female vocalist for much of the 1990s. Her final role as a regular collaborator was on the 1998 &quot;&quot; album. Another female vocalist from this period was Diane Alden, who first appeared on the &quot;Freak Show&quot; album; she once again worked with the group until &quot;Wormwood&quot;. Tony Janssen, who was first credited as an engineer on the band&#x27;s &quot;Cube-E&quot; album, eventually became a male vocalist for the band and provided the voice of Tex the Barker in their Freak Show projects.

==== 1994–2014 ====
During recording of their &quot;Gingerbread Man&quot; album, the Singing Resident met future singer Molly Harvey at a coffee shop; he invited her to record vocals for the song &quot;The Old Woman&quot;. Following this she became a regular member of the Residents&#x27; team of collaborators, and appeared on all of their major albums and live shows until 2005&#x27;s &quot;Animal Lover&quot;. Also appearing for the first time on &quot;Gingerbread Man&quot; was Isabelle Barbier, a young actress who made occasional appearances with the Residents until &quot;The Ghost of Hope&quot; in 2017.

The Residents&#x27; 1998–2000 &quot;&quot; project introduced three important figures in Residents history, Carla Fabrizio, Nolan Cook and Toby Dammit. Dammit briefly played with the Residents live from 1999 to 2003, and performed on the &quot;Demons Dance Alone&quot; album. Carla played with the Residents in concert until the 2008 Bunny Boy tour, and has worked with the band on their studio albums as recently as 2020. Nolan Cook has acted as the Residents&#x27; lead guitarist both in concert and in the studio for over twenty years now, and was credited as guitarist on their 2023 &quot;God In Three Persons&quot; concert film. On February 20th, 2024, The Residents publicly announced they would no longer be working with Nolan Cook. Cook later revealed in a Facebook comment that he had ceased working with The Residents on April 20th, 2023, but had intended to partake in their cancelled April 2024 tour. 

In the years following Molly Harvey&#x27;s departure, professional voice actress Gerri Lawlor began to make regular appearances on the Residents spoken-word projects, &quot;Tweedles&quot;, &quot;The River of Crime&quot;, &quot;The Voice of Midnight&quot; and &quot;Lonely Teenager&quot;. Corey Rosen also began working with the Residents during this time, on &quot;The River of Crime&quot;, &quot;The Voice of Midnight&quot;, and &quot;The Bunny Boy&quot; web series.

==== 2015–present ====
Following the departure of Hardy Fox in 2015, Eric Drew Feldman was once again asked to help with duties previously undertaken by Fox. Along with Feldman, performers Laurie Hall and Peter Whitehead began appearing on Residents releases starting with &quot;The Ghost of Hope&quot;. Hall also appeared on &quot;Intruders&quot;, which introduced Sivan Lioncub.

The line-up of collaborators as featured on the Residents&#x27; 2020 album &quot;Metal Meat &amp; Bone&quot; includes Eric Drew Feldman, Carla Fabrizio, Nolan Cook, Peter Whitehead, and Sivan Lioncub. Their 2022 &quot;Triple Trouble&quot; soundtrack album features Eric Drew Feldman as co-writer, co-arranger and co-producer along with The Residents; Feldman is the only credited musical collaborator on this release.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
The Residents&#x27; albums generally fall into two categories: deconstructions of Western popular music, and complex conceptual pieces composed around a theme, theory or plot. The group is noted for surrealistic lyrics and sound, with a disregard for conventional music composition. The Residents&#x27; musical style encompasses art rock, art pop, avant-pop, avant-rock, electronic, industrial, dark ambient, ambient, electronica, industrial dance, talking blues, alternative rock, noise rock and post-punk. The Residents have been described as pioneers of punk rock, art rock and techno.

===Influences===
The Residents have claimed to have been influenced by N. Senada (which may be a play on &quot;Ensenada&quot;, &quot;en se nada&quot; meaning &quot;in himself nothing,&quot; &quot;no sé nada&quot; meaning &quot;I don&#x27;t know anything&quot; or &quot;enseñada&quot;, a form of the past participle meaning &quot;taught&quot;), who they alleged was a Bavarian composer and music theorist who formulated the &quot;Theory of Obscurity&quot; and the &quot;Theory of Phonetic Organization&quot;. His &quot;Theory of Obscurity&quot; states that an artist can only produce pure art when the expectations and influences of the outside world are not taken into consideration; while his &quot;Theory of Phonetic Organization&quot; states, &quot;the musician should put the sounds first, building the music up from [them] rather than developing the music, then working down to the sounds that make it up.&quot;

There is a debate as to whether or not Senada, supposedly having been born in 1907 and dying in 1993 at the age of 86, actually existed, or was simply an invention of the Residents. It is frequently speculated that, if real, N. Senada may have been the famous avant-garde composer and instrument designer Harry Partch, the influence of whose work may be heard in Residents compositions such as &quot;Six Things to a Cycle&quot;; his death is also referenced in the song &quot;Death in Barstow&quot;. Another rumor speculates that N. Senada may have been Captain Beefheart, because in the late 1960s Beefheart and his &quot;Magic Band&quot; lived in a residence on Ensenada Drive in Woodland Hills, California, while recording &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; and &quot;Safe as Milk&quot;; Beefheart&#x27;s influence can also be heard in early Residents works. The Residents also sent an early demo tape to the Warner Brothers executive Hal Halverstadt, who had signed Beefheart.

According to the Residents, in 1937, N. Senada premiered his masterpiece, &quot;Pollex Christi&quot;, which means either &quot;Thumb of Christ&quot; or &quot;Big Toe of Christ&quot;. This work mainly consisted of borrowed pieces from other composers, namely Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot; and Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, among others. He also left large holes in the work so that the performers could insert music of their choosing, thus &quot;becoming composers themselves&quot;. Senada justified his work with &quot;house&quot; analogies claiming that he did not make the &quot;bricks&quot; but &quot;cemented them together&quot;; he was not the &quot;architect&quot;, just the &quot;builder&quot;. N. Senada allegedly collaborated with the Residents on their work prior to &quot;Santa Dog&quot; and &quot;Meet the Residents&quot;, and then disappeared. He resurfaced in the mid-1970s, returning from an Arctic expedition and bearing a sealed bottle of pure Arctic air; this served as inspiration for the &quot;Eskimo&quot; project.

<doc id="30632" wikidata="Q7673903" url="?curid=30632" title="Tacitus on Jesus">
<text>The Roman historian and senator Tacitus referred to Jesus, his execution by Pontius Pilate, and the existence of early Christians in Rome in his final work, &quot;Annals&quot; (written c. AD 116), .

The context of the passage is the six-day Great Fire of Rome that burned much of the city in AD 64 during the reign of Roman Emperor Nero. The passage is one of the earliest non-Christian references to the origins of Christianity, the execution of Christ described in the canonical gospels, and the presence and persecution of Christians in 1st-century Rome.

There are two points of vocabulary in the passage. First, Tacitus may have used the word &quot;Chrestians&quot; () for Christians, but then speaks of &quot;Christ&quot; () as the origin of that name. Second, he calls Pilate a &quot;procurator&quot;, even though other sources indicate that he had the title &quot;prefect&quot;. Scholars have proposed various hypotheses to explain these peculiarities.

The scholarly consensus is that Tacitus&#x27;s reference to the execution of Jesus by Pontius Pilate is both authentic, and of historical value as an independent Roman source. However, Tacitus does not reveal the source of his information. There are several hypotheses as to what sources he may have used.

Tacitus provides non-Christian confirmation of the crucifixion of Jesus. Scholars view it as establishing three separate facts about Rome around AD 60: (i) that there was a sizable number of Christians in Rome at the time, (ii) that it was possible to distinguish between Christians and Jews in Rome, and (iii) that at the time pagans made a connection between Christianity in Rome and its origin in Roman Judaea.

Tacitus is one of the non-Christian writers of the time who mentioned Jesus and early Christianity along with Flavius Josephus, Pliny the Younger, and Suetonius.

==The passage and its context==
The &quot;Annals&quot; passage (), which has been subjected to much scholarly analysis, follows a description of the six-day Great Fire of Rome that burned much of Rome in July 64 AD. The key part of the passage (translation from Latin by A. J. Church and W. J. Brodribb, 1876):
Tacitus then describes the torture of Christians:
The exact cause of the fire remains uncertain, but much of the population of Rome suspected that Emperor Nero had started the fire himself. To divert attention from himself, Nero accused the Christians of starting the fire and persecuted them, making this the first documented confrontation between Christians and the authorities in Rome. Tacitus suggested that Nero used the Christians as scapegoats.

As with almost all ancient Greek and Latin literature, no original manuscripts of the &quot;Annals&quot; exist. The surviving copies of Tacitus&#x27; major works derive from two principal manuscripts, known as the &quot;Medicean manuscripts&quot;, which are held in the Laurentian Library in Florence, Italy. The second of them (Plut. 68.2), as the only one containing books xi–xvi of the &quot;Annales&quot;, is the oldest witness to the passage describing Christians. Scholars generally agree that this codex was written in the 11th century at the Benedictine abbey of Monte Cassino and its end refers to &quot;Abbas Raynaldus cu...&quot; who was most probably one of the two abbots of that name at the abbey during that period.

==Points of vocabulary==

===Christians and Chrestians===
The passage states:

In 1902 Georg Andresen commented on the appearance of the first &#x27;i&#x27; and subsequent gap in the earliest extant, 11th century, copy of the &quot;Annals&quot; in Florence, suggesting that the text had been altered, and an &#x27;e&#x27; had originally been in the text, rather than this &#x27;i&#x27;. &quot;With ultra-violet examination of the MS the alteration was conclusively shown. It is impossible today to say who altered the letter &quot;e&quot; into an &quot;i&quot;.&quot; Since the alteration became known it has given rise to debates among scholars as to whether Tacitus deliberately used the term &quot;Chrestians&quot;, or if a scribe made an error during the Middle Ages. It has been stated that both the terms Christians and Chrestians had at times been used by the general population in Rome to refer to early Christians. Robert E. Van Voorst states that many sources indicate that the term Chrestians was also used among the early followers of Jesus by the second century. The term Christians appears only three times in the New Testament, the first usage () giving the origin of the term. In all three cases the uncorrected Codex Sinaiticus in Greek reads &quot;Chrestianoi&quot;. In Phrygia a number of funerary stone inscriptions use the term Chrestians, with one stone inscription using both terms together, reading: &quot;Chrestians for Christians&quot;.

Adolf von Harnack argued that Chrestians was the original wording, and that Tacitus deliberately used &quot;Christus&quot; immediately after it to show his own superior knowledge compared to the population at large. Robert Renehan has stated that it was natural for a Roman to mix the two words that sounded the same, that Chrestianos was the original word in the &quot;Annals&quot; and not an error by a scribe. Van Voorst has stated that it was unlikely for Tacitus himself to refer to Christians as Chrestianos i.e. &quot;useful ones&quot; given that he also referred to them as &quot;hated for their shameful acts&quot;. Eddy and Boyd see no major impact on the authenticity of the passage or its meaning regardless of the use of either term by Tacitus.

Whatever the original wording of Tacitus, another ancient source about the Neronian persecution, by Suetonius, apparently speaks of &quot;Christians&quot;: &quot;In Suetonius&#x27; &quot;Nero 16.2&quot;, &quot;, however, seems to be the original reading.&quot;

===The rank of Pilate===

Pilate&#x27;s rank while he was governor of Judaea appeared in a Latin inscription on the Pilate Stone which called him a prefect, while this Tacitean passage calls him a procurator. Josephus refers to Pilate with the generic Greek term (), or governor. Tacitus records that Claudius was the ruler who gave procurators governing power. After Herod Agrippa&#x27;s death in AD 44, when Judea reverted to direct Roman rule, Claudius gave procurators control over Judea.

Various theories have been put forward to explain why Tacitus should use the term &quot;procurator&quot; when the archaeological evidence indicates that Pilate was a prefect. Jerry Vardaman theorizes that Pilate&#x27;s title was changed during his stay in Judea and that the Pilate Stone dates from the early years of his administration. Baruch Lifshitz postulates that the inscription would originally have mentioned the title of &quot;procurator&quot; along with &quot;prefect&quot;. L.A. Yelnitsky argues that the use of &quot;procurator&quot; in &quot;Annals&quot; 15.44.3 is a Christian interpolation. S.G.F. Brandon suggests that there is no real difference between the two ranks. John Dominic Crossan states that Tacitus &quot;retrojected&quot; the title procurator which was in use at the time of Claudius back onto Pilate who was called prefect in his own time. Bruce Chilton and Craig Evans as well as Van Voorst state that Tacitus apparently used the title &quot;procurator&quot; because it was more common at the time of his writing and that this variation in the use of the title should not be taken as evidence to doubt the correctness of the information Tacitus provides. Warren Carter states that, as the term &quot;prefect&quot; has a military connotation, while &quot;procurator&quot; is civilian, the use of either term may be appropriate for governors who have a range of military, administrative and fiscal responsibilities.

Louis Feldman says that Philo (who died AD 50) and Josephus also use the term &quot;procurator&quot; for Pilate. As both Philo and Josephus wrote in Greek, neither of them actually used the term &quot;procurator&quot;, but the Greek word (), which is regularly translated as &quot;procurator&quot;. Philo also uses this Greek term for the governors of Egypt (a prefect), of Asia (a proconsul) and Syria (a legate). Werner Eck, in his list of terms for governors of Judea found in the works of Josephus, shows that, while in the early work, &quot;The Jewish War&quot;, Josephus uses &quot;epitropos&quot; less consistently, the first governor to be referred to by the term in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; was Cuspius Fadus, (who was in office AD 44–46). Feldman notes that Philo, Josephus and Tacitus may have anachronistically confused the timing of the titles—prefect later changing to procurator. Feldman also notes that the use of the titles may not have been rigid, for Josephus refers to Cuspius Fadus both as &quot;prefect&quot; and &quot;procurator&quot;.

==Authenticity==
Most scholars hold the passage to be authentic and that Tacitus was the author. Classicists observe that in a recent assessment by latinists on the passage, they unanimously deemed the passage authentic and noted that no serious Tacitean scholar believes it to be an interpolation.

Suggestions that the passage may have been a complete forgery have been generally rejected by scholars. John P. Meier states that there is no historical or archaeological evidence to support the argument that a scribe may have introduced the passage into the text. Scholars such as Bruce Chilton, Craig Evans, Paul Eddy and Gregory Boyd agree with John Meier&#x27;s statement that &quot;Despite some feeble attempts to show that this text is a Christian interpolation in Tacitus, the passage is obviously genuine&quot;.

Tacitus was a patriotic Roman senator. His writings show no sympathy towards Christians, or knowledge of who their leader was. His characterization of &quot;Christian abominations&quot; may have been based on the rumors in Rome that during the Eucharist rituals Christians ate the body and drank the blood of their God, interpreting the ritual as cannibalism. Andreas Köstenberger states that the tone of the passage towards Christians is far too negative to have been authored by a Christian scribe. Van Voorst also states that the passage is unlikely to be a Christian forgery because of the pejorative language used to describe Christianity.

Tacitus was about seven years old at the time of the Great Fire of Rome, and like other Romans as he grew up he would have most likely heard about the fire that destroyed most of the city, and Nero&#x27;s accusations against Christians. When Tacitus wrote his account, he was the governor of the province of Asia, and as a member of the inner circle in Rome he would have known of the official position with respect to the fire and the Christians.

William L. Portier has stated that the references to Christ and Christians by Tacitus, Josephus and the letters to Emperor Trajan by Pliny the Younger are consistent, which reaffirms the validity of all three accounts.

== Sources used by Tacitus ==
The majority of scholars consider the passage to be genuinely by Tacitus. However, he does not reveal the source of his information. For this reason, some scholars have debated the historical value of the passage.

Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz argue that Tacitus at times had drawn on earlier historical works now lost to us, and he may have used official sources from a Roman archive in this case; however, if Tacitus had been copying from an official source, some scholars would expect him to have labelled Pilate correctly as a &quot;prefect&quot; rather than a &quot;procurator&quot;. Theissen and Merz state that Tacitus gives us a description of widespread prejudices about Christianity and a few precise details about &quot;Christus&quot; and Christianity, the source of which remains unclear. However, Paul Eddy has stated that given his position as a senator, Tacitus was also likely to have had access to official Roman documents of the time and did not need other sources.

Scholars have also debated the issue of hearsay in the reference by Tacitus. Charles Guignebert argued that &quot;So long as there is that possibility [that Tacitus is merely echoing what Christians themselves were saying], the passage remains quite worthless&quot;. R. T. France states that the Tacitus passage is at best just Tacitus repeating what he had heard through Christians. However, Paul Eddy has stated that as Rome&#x27;s preeminent historian, Tacitus was generally known for checking his sources and was not in the habit of reporting gossip.

Tacitus was a member of the &quot;Quindecimviri sacris faciundis&quot;, a council of priests whose duty it was to supervise foreign religious cults in Rome, which as Van Voorst points out, makes it reasonable to suppose that he would have acquired knowledge of Christian origins through his work with that body.

== Historical value ==
Depending on the sources Tacitus used, the passage is potentially of historical value regarding Jesus, early Christianity, and its persecution under emperor Nero.

Regarding Jesus, Van Voorst states that &quot;of all Roman writers, Tacitus gives us the most precise information about Christ&quot;. Crossan considers the passage important in establishing that Jesus existed and was crucified, and states: &quot;That he was crucified is as sure as anything historical can ever be, since both Josephus and Tacitus... agree with the Christian accounts on at least that basic fact.&quot; Eddy and Boyd state that it is now &quot;firmly established&quot; that Tacitus provides a non-Christian confirmation of the crucifixion of Jesus. Biblical scholar Bart D. Ehrman wrote: &quot;Tacitus&#x27;s report confirms what we know from other sources, that Jesus was executed by order of the Roman governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate, sometime during Tiberius&#x27;s reign.&quot;

However, some scholars question the value of the passage given that Tacitus was born 25 years after Jesus&#x27; death.

Regarding early Christianity, scholars generally consider Tacitus&#x27;s reference to be of historical value as an independent Roman source that is in unison with other historical records. James D. G. Dunn considers the passage as useful in establishing facts about early Christians, e.g. that there was a sizable number of Christians in Rome around AD 60. Dunn states that Tacitus seems to be under the impression that Christians were some form of Judaism, although distinguished from them. Raymond E. Brown and John P. Meier state that in addition to establishing that there was a large body of Christians in Rome, the Tacitus passage provides two other important pieces of historical information, namely that by around AD 60 it was possible to distinguish between Christians and Jews in Rome and that even pagans made a connection between Christianity in Rome and its origin in Judea.

Regarding the Neronian persecution, the scholarly consensus is that it really took place.
Questioning this consensus, Weaver notes that Tacitus spoke of the persecution of Christians, but no other Christian author wrote of this persecution for a hundred years.
Brent Shaw has argued that Tacitus was relying on Christian and Jewish legendary sources that portrayed Nero as the Antichrist for the information that Nero persecuted Christians and that in fact, no persecution under Nero took place.
Shaw has questioned if the passage represents &quot;some modernizing or updating of the facts&quot; to reflect the Christian world at the time the text was written.

Shaw&#x27;s views have received strong criticism and have generally not been accepted by the scholarly consensus: Christopher P. Jones (Harvard University) answered to Shaw and refuted his arguments, noting that the Tacitus&#x27;s anti-Christian stance makes it unlikely that he was using Christian sources; he also noted that the Epistle to the Romans of Paul the Apostle clearly points to the fact that there was indeed a clear and distinct Christian community in Rome in the 50s and that the persecution is also mentioned by Suetonius in &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot;. Larry Hurtado was also critical of Shaw&#x27;s argument, dismissing it as &quot;vague and hazy&quot;.
Brigit van der Lans and Jan N. Bremmer also dismissed Shaw&#x27;s argument, noting that the Neronian persecution is recorded in many 1st-century Christian writings, such as the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Book of Revelation, the apocryphal Ascension of Isaiah, the First Epistle of Peter, the Gospel of John and the First Epistle of Clement; they also argued that &quot;Chrestianus, Christianus&quot;, and &quot;Χριστιανός&quot; were probably terms invented by the Romans in the 50s and then adopted by Christians themselves.
John Granger Cook also rebuked Shaw&#x27;s thesis, arguing that &quot;Chrestianus, Christianus&quot;, and &quot;Χριστιανός&quot; are not creations of the second century and that Roman officials were probably aware of the &quot;Chrestiani&quot; in the 60s.
Barry S. Strauss also rejects Shaw&#x27;s argument.

==Other early sources==
Tacitus is not the only non-Christian writer of the time who mentioned Jesus and early Christianity.

The earliest known references to Christianity are found in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, a 20-volume work written by the Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus around 93–94 AD, during the reign of emperor Domitian. As it stands now, this work includes two references to Jesus and Christians (in and ), and also a reference to John the Baptist (in ).

The next known reference to Christianity was written by Pliny the Younger, who was the Roman governor of Bithynia and Pontus during the reign of emperor Trajan. Around 111 AD, Pliny wrote a letter to emperor Trajan. As it stands now, the letter is requesting guidance on how to deal with suspected Christians who appeared before him in trials he was holding at that time. Tacitus&#x27; references to Nero&#x27;s persecution of Christians in the Annals were written around 115 AD, a few years after Pliny&#x27;s letter but also during the reign of emperor Trajan.

Another notable early author was Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus, who wrote the &quot;Lives of the Twelve Caesars&quot; around 122 AD, during the reign of emperor Hadrian. In this work, Suetonius apparently described why Jewish Christians were by emperor Claudius, and also the by Nero, who was the heir and successor of Claudius.

<text>The Fantasy Trip (TFT) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game designed by Steve Jackson and published in segments by Metagaming Concepts starting in 1977 and culminating in 1980. In 2019, Steve Jackson Games republished it as &quot;The Fantasy Trip Legacy Edition&quot;.

==Description==
In fantasy role-playing games (RPGs) of the mid-1970s, epitomized by TSR&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, players first randomly determine key attributes of their character such as strength, dexterity and intelligence before choosing a character class that will make the best use of the highest scores.

&quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot; was the first RPG to use a &quot;point-buy&quot; system. Instead of rolling dice to determine the player divides a pool of 32 points between Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence. Higher Strength is related to better health. Higher Dexterity gives a better chance of hitting an opponent. Higher Intelligence allows for more powerful spells to be cast. Armor reduces the amount of incoming damage, but at the cost of Dexterity. Casting a spell comes at the cost of Strength.

The basic rules are outlined in two publications, &quot;The Fantasy Trip: Melee&quot; and &quot;The Fantasy Trip: Wizard&quot;.

===&quot;Melee&quot;===
&quot;Melee&quot; introduces a simple, fast-playing, man-to-man tactical combat boardgame that came with a small blank hex map, a counter sheet of men, monsters, and weapons (for any weapons dropped in combat), as well as a 17-page rulebook.

Every character has a Strength and Dexterity attribute. Strength governs how much damage a figure can take and the size of weapons which can be used; heavier weapons increase the damage one inflicts in combat. Dexterity determines how likely one is to hit one&#x27;s opponent. Armor can be worn, but while this reduces the amount of damage taken in combat, it lowers one&#x27;s Dexterity.

===&quot;Wizard&quot;===
Wizard&#x27;s 32-page rulebook includes most of the &quot;Melee&quot; combat system but with a new a magic system. Intelligence is a third attribute that determines magical ability — a high IQ score allows the use of more varied and powerful spells. However, casting a spell will temporarily drain a character&#x27;s Strength score, limiting the number of spells one can cast before requiring rest to regain Strength.

===&quot;In the Labyrinth&quot;===
Released as an 80-page, 8 × 11 saddle-stitched book, &quot;In the Labyrinth: Game Masters&#x27; Campaign and Adventure Guide&quot; adds a role-playing system and fantasy-world background to &quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot;. (Released simultaneously and in the same format were &quot;Advanced Melee&quot; and &quot;Advanced Wizard&quot;, which greatly expand and revise the physical and magical combat systems.)

The three books together formed the complete &quot;Fantasy Trip&quot; game system. As in the original MicroGames, each character has Strength, Dexterity and IQ attributes. New (human) characters begin with 8 points of each trait, and the player has 8 extra points to add to any or all of the abilities as desired.

&quot;In the Labyrinth&quot; also introduces a point-buy skill system, an extension and generalization of the magic system inherited from &quot;Wizard&quot;. Each character has one talent or skill point per point of IQ, and each skill has a skill point cost as well as a minimum IQ to learn it.

==Publication history==

===The concept===
American game designer Steve Jackson became interested in the first fantasy role-playing game, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, when it was first published in 1974. However, Jackson did not like either the long and complex rules nor the character creation system with its randomly determined attributes. As RPG historian St Horvath noted, house rules became a common way &quot;to reduce randomness in favor of giving the player some sort of leeway in creating the sort of character they &quot;want&quot; to play.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s solution as a game designer working for Metagaming Concepts was to design a new role-playing game system with a much simpler set of rules. Jackson&#x27;s system also used a &quot;point-buy&quot; system for determining attributes.

Metagaming Concepts had just started publishing their MicroGame line, small and simple games packaged in either a ziplock bag or a thin plastic case. Jackson&#x27;s science fiction wargame &quot;Ogre&quot; was the first in the series. MicroGame #3, published in 1977, was the first part of Jackson&#x27;s new RPG, a game titled &quot;The Fantasy Trip: Melee&quot;. This was followed in 1978 by MicroGame #6, &quot;The Fantasy Trip: Wizard&quot;.

Response to &quot;Melee&quot; and &quot;Wizard&quot; was good, and Metagaming quickly produced a &quot;MicroQuest&quot; line of small adventures that used these rules, ultimately producing eight in the series from 1978 to 1981.

===&quot;TFT&quot; RPG===
Although &quot;Melee&quot; and &quot;Wizard&quot; established combat and magic rules, Jackson wanted produce a complete RPG. He revised and expanded both &quot;Melee&quot; and &quot;Wizard&quot;, adding more combat rules, more weapons, more magical items, and rules for the gamemaster, as well as a complete adventure that used the new rules. He submitted this for publication, assuming it would be released as one product. However, Metagaming president Howard Thompson disagreed with Jackson&#x27;s approach, believing that it was too complex.

After Howard made changes to the game, Jackson was not shown the final proofs, and Howard published &quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot; RPG as four separate books: &quot;Advanced Melee&quot;; &quot;Advanced Wizard&quot;; &quot;In the Labyrinth&quot; (a gamemaster&#x27;s guide); and an adventure titled &quot;Tollenkar&#x27;s Lair&quot;. Jackson was so incensed that he left Metagaming in 1980 to found his own company, Steve Jackson Games.

Metagaming published several adventure for &quot;TFT&quot;, including &quot;Warrior Lords of Darok&quot; and &quot;Forest Lords of Dihad&quot;, published in 1982 for &quot;The Land Beyond the Mountains&quot; campaign setting in partnership with Gamelords. The &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; licensed campaign setting, published by Chaosium in 1981, also included character statistics and notes for use with &quot;TFT&quot;.

Two Metagaming-published magazines, &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; and &quot;Interplay&quot; featured &quot;TFT&quot; material, including designer notes, setting expansions, and alternate rules.

In 1983, Thompson closed down Metagaming and sold most of its assets. Jackson tried to purchase the rights to &quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot;, but Thompson&#x27;s asking price of $250,000 was much too high, and &quot;TFT&quot; went out of print. This led Jackson to begin work on a new &quot;third generation&quot; role-playing system that eventually became &quot;GURPS&quot; (the Generic Universal Role-Playing System), which was strongly influenced by &quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot;.

In 1988, Hobby Japan released a Japanese-language edition of &quot;TFT&quot; under the name . It combined in a single volume the rules from &quot;Melee&quot; and &quot;Wizard&quot; along with the MicroQuests &quot;Death Test&quot;, &quot;Death Test 2&quot;, &quot;Grail Quest&quot;, &quot;Treasure of the Silver Dragon&quot;, and &quot;Treasure of Unicorn Gold&quot;.

===Jackson reclaims &quot;TFT&quot;===
In December 2017, Jackson announced he had exercised an option under U.S. law for an author to unilaterally terminate a grant of publication rights between 35 and 40 years after publication, which allowed him to regain rights to &quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot;. In July 2018, Steve Jackson Games launched a Kickstarter campaign to reissue &quot;Melee&quot;, &quot;Wizard&quot;, and a &quot;TFT Legacy Edition&quot; boxed set with the expanded &quot;In the Labyrinth&quot; rules, among other materials. The revived &quot;TFT&quot; proved a success for Steve Jackson Games, raising more than $450,000 in 2018, and the company has committed to expanding and continued support for &quot;TFT&quot;.

===&quot;The Fantasy Trip Legacy Edition&quot; 2019===
On December 26, 2017, Steve Jackson announced he had re-acquired the rights for the &quot;TFT&quot; products he authored for Metagaming, specifically &quot;Melee&quot;, &quot;Wizard&quot;, &quot;Death Test&quot;, &quot;Death Test 2&quot;, &quot;Advanced Melee&quot;, &quot;Advanced Wizard&quot;, &quot;In the Labyrinth&quot;, and &quot;Tollenkar&#x27;s Lair&quot;. This was accomplished through the provisions of 17 U.S. Code § 203, which allows authors to reclaim works after 35 years. The process &quot;took well over a year&quot; and &quot;was also not cheap&quot;, according to Jackson, but it allowed for the revival of &quot;TFT&quot; by Steve Jackson Games.

On July 23, 2018, Steve Jackson Games opened a Kickstarter campaign for &quot;The Fantasy Trip Legacy Edition&quot; including updated versions of all the works reclaimed from Metagaming; the new version of &quot;In the Labyrinth&quot; incorporated &quot;Advanced Melee&quot; and &quot;Advanced Wizard&quot;, as originally envisioned by Jackson. The Kickstarter campaign was funded the same day. The game was released for retail sale on April 17, 2019.

Subsequently, Steve Jackson Games has kickstarted a group of &quot;TFT&quot; accessories, &quot;Decks of Destiny&quot;, as well as a new &quot;TFT&quot; zine, &quot;Hexagram&quot;. Additional supporting materials, including adventures, solo/programmed adventures, Quick Quests, and beastiaries are also planned. The company also announced a licensing structure allowing other companies to produce material for &quot;TFT&quot;; the first such licensed project was a series of five adventures published by Gaming Ballistic in 2019.

==Reception==
Ronald Pehr reviewed &quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 31. Pehr commented that &quot;&quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot; is an excellent FRP game system. I&#x27;d have liked it to be better organized and a few dollars cheaper. Those who purchase it anyway will be very glad they did.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;&quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot; [was] the first RPG to use a point-buy skill system. Point-buy allows players direct, fine-grain control over how their character is created and developed over time.&quot; Horvath concluded, &quot;The result is a flexible and intuitive system filled with promise.&quot;

*3204 — &quot;Treasure of the Silver Dragon&quot; (MQ#4). This solo adventure contained clues to a silver dragon figurine hidden somewhere in the United States. The 31 troy ounce dragon was found by Thomas Davidson, who was awarded with a $10,000 check in addition to the figurine.
*3205 — &quot;Security Station&quot; (MQ#5). A dungeon crawl through a high-tech fallout shelter.
*3206 — &quot;Treasure of Unicorn Gold&quot; (MQ#6). Identical in concept to &quot;Treasure of the Silver Dragon&quot;, except the quest was for a small golden unicorn. No prize was awarded before Metagaming folded, and the disposition of the gold unicorn was not announced. See the link below to a website claiming to have nearly solved the mystery of the unicorn&#x27;s hiding place.
*3207 — &quot;Master of the Amulets&quot; (MQ#7). A simple hex-crawl adventure where the player explores a valley and picks up many magical amulets laying about.
*3208 — &quot;Orb Quest&quot; (MQ#8)
*2201 — &quot;Tollenkar&#x27;s Lair&quot;
*2202 — &quot;The Warrior Lords of Darok&quot;. The first module released in a series called &quot;The Land Beyond the Mountains&quot;, a full campaign setting designed exclusively for TFT. This detailed the province of Darok, whose inhabitants worship a mean and nasty god of war and fire. This land was to be detailed over the course of several modules, but only this and &quot;The Forest Lords of Dihad&quot; were released before Metagaming&#x27;s demise. Planned modules would have detailed the provinces of &quot;Muipoco&quot; and &quot;Soukor&quot;, and two or more cities, the provincial capitals. The city modules for the capitals of Darok and Dihad were redesigned and released under other names by Game Lords Ltd.
*GL-1970 — &quot;The Forest Lords of Dihad&quot;. Published by Gamelords. The last &quot;TFT&quot; release before the closing of Metagaming.
*2301 — &quot;The Fantasy Master&#x27;s Codex&quot;. Originally called the &quot;TFT Yearbook&quot;, this was planned to be a supplement that would be updated annually to include rules changes, expansions and new rules interpretations. It was also planned to include variants and expansions submitted by &quot;TFT&quot; players. Only one was released.
*2302 — &quot;The Fantasy Masters&#x27; Screen&quot;. A cardboard screen to hide notes and maps from the players, featuring useful reference charts and tables for game play; it was similar in concept to the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Screen&quot; produced by TSR for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.
*5102 — &quot;Dragons of UnderEarth&quot;. A compact set of fantasy role-playing rules derived from &quot;Melee&quot;, &quot;Wizard&quot; and &quot;ITL&quot;, with simplified rules for combat and magic.
*3118 — &quot;The Lords of UnderEarth&quot;. This was a separate MicroGame of large-scale combat, but was developed to work with &quot;TFT&quot; as a system for combat involving large numbers of troops. It featured a set of conversions for building units based on &quot;TFT&quot; characters. It also featured a setting that could be used as a very large dungeon environment.
*The Fantasy Trip Character Record Sheets published by Fantasimulations Associates.
*&quot;Shaylle: Soldier City&quot;. Developed by Gamelords for &quot;The Land Beyond the Mountains&quot; setting, but when Metagaming went out of business the module was rewritten and issued as &quot;City of the Sacred Flame&quot; (GL-1934) for use with the Thieves&#x27; Guild rules system. The history section was heavily redone and the main non-player character&#x27;s names are changed, but many of the area descriptions and the adventures remain essentially unchanged. At least one quest in this module still has the original NPC&#x27;s name unchanged.
*&quot;Intrigue in Plaize&quot;. Developed by Gamelords for &quot;The Land Beyond the Mountains&quot; setting, but when Metagaming went out of business the module was rewritten and issued as &quot;Within the Tyrant&#x27;s Demesne&quot; (GL-1935) for use with the Thieves&#x27; Guild rules system. As with &quot;City of the Sacred Flame&quot;, the history is rewritten, but many descriptions and references remain largely unchanged.
*&quot;Conquerors of UnderEarth&quot; (CUE). Slated to be an adventure module for use with the &quot;Dragons of UnderEarth&quot; system. It was never released but had at least progressed to the draft stage. &quot;Interplay&quot; #8 gave several details, stating that &quot;it deals with Adventurers entering a Goblin fortress and encountering organized military units, and as such often involves 10–20 or more fighters in a battle.&quot; Since &quot;CUE&quot; was fairly streamlined, it lent itself to these sorts of encounters.
Beyond these products, additional supplements were in various stages of playtest, design, and development when Metagaming shuttered. Among these, according to a February 1982 company memo, were &quot;High Noon&quot;, an old west rules set; &quot;In the Name of Justice&quot; and &quot;Herodium&quot;, comic book superheroes rules sets; an adventure, &quot;Nosferatu&quot;; and a campaign setting, &quot;The Inner Sea&quot;.

==Fan activity and retro-clones==
A number of dedicated fanzines supported the original publication. Lester W. Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Fantasy Forum&quot; ran from 1987 to 1992 with a total of ten issues. &quot;Inept Adept&quot; and &quot;Goblin Keep&quot; published two issues each. A fourth fanzine, &quot;Vindicator&quot;, was devoted to MicroGames in general but did include some material specific to &quot;TFT&quot;. &quot;Vindicator&quot; published at least 14 issues from 1995 to 1998. A number of tribute and fan websites preserved and expanded &quot;TFT&quot; over the years, including a long-running E-mail discussion list archived at tft.brainiac.com.

At least two game companies have developed material inspired by and largely compatible with &quot;TFT&quot;, similar to retroclone games. Dark City Games has offered &quot;MicroQuest&quot;-style programmed adventures since 2005 for its &quot;Heroes of the Ancient World&quot; system, as well as &quot;TFT&quot;-compatible rules and adventures for wild west and science-fiction genres. &quot;Heroes &amp; Other Worlds&quot; similarly builds on &quot;TFT&quot;, albeit with greater deviation from the original rules.

<text>The Taliban (; ), which also refers to itself by its state name, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, is an Afghan political and militant movement with an ideology comprising elements of Pashtun nationalism and the Deobandi movement of Islamic fundamentalism. It ruled approximately 75% of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, before it was overthrown by an American invasion after the September 11 attacks carried out by the Taliban&#x27;s ally al-Qaeda. The Taliban recaptured Kabul in August 2021 following the departure of coalition forces, after 20 years of Taliban insurgency, and now controls the entire country. The Taliban government is not recognized by any country and has been internationally condemned for restricting human rights, including women&#x27;s rights to work and have an education.

The Taliban emerged in 1994 as a prominent faction in the Afghan Civil War and largely consisted of students from the Pashtun areas of east and south Afghanistan, who had been educated in traditional Islamic schools (). Under the leadership of Mullah Omar (), the movement spread through most of Afghanistan, shifting power away from the Mujahideen warlords. In 1996, the group established the First Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The Taliban&#x27;s government was opposed by the Northern Alliance militia, which seized parts of northeast Afghanistan and maintained international recognition as a continuation of the Islamic State of Afghanistan.

During their rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban enforced a strict interpretation of &quot;Sharia&quot;, or Islamic law, and were widely condemned for massacres against Afghan civilians, harsh discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities, denial of UN food supplies to starving civilians, destruction of cultural monuments, banning women from school and most employment, and prohibition of most music. The Taliban committed a cultural genocide against Afghans by destroying their historical and cultural texts, artifacts and sculptures. The Taliban held control of most of the country until the United States invasion of Afghanistan in December 2001. Many members of the Taliban fled to neighboring Pakistan.

After being overthrown, the Taliban launched an insurgency to fight the US-backed Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in the War in Afghanistan. In May 2002, exiled members formed the Council of Leaders based in Quetta, Pakistan. Under Hibatullah Akhundzada&#x27;s leadership, in May 2021, the Taliban launched a military offensive, that culminated in the fall of Kabul in August 2021 and the Taliban regaining control. The Islamic Republic was dissolved and the Islamic Emirate reestablished. Following their return to power, the Afghanistan government budget lost 80% of its funding and food insecurity became widespread. The Taliban returned Afghanistan to many policies implemented under its previous rule, including banning women from holding almost any jobs, requiring women to wear head-to-toe coverings such as the burqa, blocking women from travelling without male guardians, banning female speech and banning all education for girls.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Taliban&quot; is Pashto, (), meaning &quot;students&quot;, the plural of . This is a loanword from Arabic (), using the Pashto plural ending &quot;-ān&quot; . (In Arabic () means not &quot;students&quot; but rather &quot;two students&quot;, as it is a dual form, the Arabic plural being ()—occasionally causing some confusion to Arabic speakers.) Since becoming a loanword in English, &quot;Taliban&quot;, besides a plural noun referring to the group, has also been used as a singular noun referring to an individual. For example, John Walker Lindh has been referred to as &quot;an American Taliban&quot; rather than &quot;an American Talib&quot; in domestic media. This is different in Afghanistan, where a member or a supporter of the group is referred to as a &quot;Talib&quot; (طَالِبْ) or its plural &quot;Talib-ha&quot; (طَالِبْهَا). In other definitions, Taliban means &#x27;seekers&#x27;.

In English, the spelling &quot;Taliban&quot; has gained predominance over the spelling &quot;Taleban&quot;. In American English, the definite article is used, the group is referred to as &quot;the Taliban&quot;, rather than &quot;Taliban&quot;. In English-language media in Pakistan, the definite article is always omitted. Both Pakistani and Indian English-language media tend to name the group &quot;Afghan Taliban&quot;, thus distinguishing it from the Pakistani Taliban. Additionally, in Pakistan, the word &quot;Talibans&quot; is often used when referring to more than one Taliban member.

In Afghanistan, the Taliban is frequently called the (), Dari term which means &#x27;Taliban group&#x27;. As per Dari/Persian grammar, there is no &quot;the&quot; prefix. Meanwhile, in Pashto, a determiner is normally used and as a result, the group is normally referred to as per Pashto grammar: () or ().

== Background ==


=== Soviet intervention in Afghanistan (1978–1992) ===

After the Soviet Union intervened and occupied Afghanistan in 1979, Islamic mujahideen fighters waged a war against Soviet forces. During the Soviet–Afghan War, nearly all of the Taliban&#x27;s original leaders had fought for either the Hezb-i Islami Khalis or the Harakat-i Inqilab-e Islami factions of the Mujahideen.

Pakistan&#x27;s President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq feared that the Soviets were also planning to invade Balochistan, Pakistan, so he sent Akhtar Abdur Rahman to Saudi Arabia to garner support for the Afghan resistance against Soviet occupation forces. A while later, the US CIA and the Saudi Arabian General Intelligence Directorate (GID) funnelled funding and equipment through the Pakistani Inter-Service Intelligence Agency (ISI) to the Afghan mujahideen. About 90,000 Afghans, including Mullah Omar, were trained by Pakistan&#x27;s ISI during the 1980s.

=== Afghan Civil War (1992–1996) ===

In April 1992, after the fall of the Soviet-backed régime of Mohammad Najibullah, many Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement, the Peshawar Accord, which created the Islamic State of Afghanistan and appointed an interim government for a transitional period. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar&#x27;s Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, Hezbe Wahdat, and Ittihad-i Islami did not participate. The state was paralysed from the start, due to rival groups contending for total power over Kabul and Afghanistan.

Hekmatyar&#x27;s Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin party refused to recognise the interim government, and in April infiltrated Kabul to take power for itself, thus starting this civil war. In May, Hekmatyar started attacks against government forces and Kabul. Hekmatyar received operational, financial and military support from Pakistan&#x27;s ISI. With that help, Hekmatyar&#x27;s forces were able to destroy half of Kabul. Iran assisted the Hezbe Wahdat forces of Abdul-Ali Mazari. Saudi Arabia supported the Ittihad-i Islami faction. The conflict between these militias also escalated into war.

Due to this sudden initiation of civil war, working government departments, police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly created Islamic State of Afghanistan did not have time to form. Atrocities were committed by individuals inside different factions. Ceasefires, negotiated by representatives of the Islamic State&#x27;s newly appointed Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Massoud, President Sibghatullah Mojaddedi and later President Burhanuddin Rabbani (the interim government), or officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), commonly collapsed within days. The countryside in northern Afghanistan, parts of which were under the control of Defense Minister Massoud, remained calm and some reconstruction took place. The city of Herat under the rule of Islamic State ally Ismail Khan also witnessed relative calm. Meanwhile, southern Afghanistan was neither under the control of foreign-backed militias nor the government in Kabul, but was ruled by local leaders such as Gul Agha Sherzai and their militias.

== History ==

The Taliban movement originated in Pashtun nationalism, and its ideological underpinnings are with that of broader Afghan society. The Taliban&#x27;s roots lie in the religious schools of Kandahar and were influenced significantly by foreign support, particularly from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, during the Soviet–Afghan War. They emerged in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, capturing Kandahar and expanding their control across the country; they became involved in a war with the Northern Alliance. The international response to the Taliban varied, with some countries providing support while others opposed and did not recognize their regime.

During their rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban implemented strict religious regulations, notably affecting women&#x27;s rights and cultural heritage. This period included significant ethnic persecution and the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan. After the US-led invasion in 2001, the Taliban were ousted from power but regrouped and launched an insurgency that lasted two decades.

The Taliban returned to power in 2021 following the US withdrawal. Their efforts to establish the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan continue, with education policies and international relations, including internal and external challenges faced by the Taliban regime.

=== 2021 offensive and return to power ===

In mid 2021, the Taliban led a major offensive in Afghanistan during the withdrawal of US troops from the country, which gave them control of over half of Afghanistan&#x27;s 421 districts as of 23 July 2021. By mid-August 2021, the Taliban controlled every major city in Afghanistan; following the near seizure of the capital Kabul, the Taliban occupied the Presidential Palace after the incumbent President Ashraf Ghani fled Afghanistan to the United Arab Emirates. Ghani&#x27;s Asylum was confirmed by the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation on 18 August 2021. Remaining Afghan forces under the leadership of Amrullah Saleh, Ahmad Massoud, and Bismillah Khan Mohammadi retreated to Panjshir to continue resistance.

==== Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (2021–present) ====
The Taliban had &quot;seized power from an established government backed by some of the world&#x27;s best-equipped militaries&quot;; and as an ideological insurgent movement dedicated to &quot;bringing about a truly Islamic state&quot; its victory has been compared to that of the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949 or Iranian Revolution of 1979, with their &quot;sweeping&quot; remake of society. However, as of 2021–2022, senior Taliban leaders have emphasized the &quot;softness&quot; of their revolution and how they desired &quot;good relations&quot; with the United States, in discussions with American journalist Jon Lee Anderson.

Anderson notes that the Taliban&#x27;s war against any &quot;graven images&quot;, so vigorous in their early rule, has been abandoned, perhaps made impossible by smartphones and Instagram. One local observer (Sayed Hamid Gailani) has argued the Taliban have not killed &quot;a lot&quot; of people after returning to power. Women are seen out on the street, Zabihullah Mujahid (acting Deputy Minister of Information and Culture) noted there are still women working in a number of government ministries, and claimed that girls will be allowed to attend secondary education when bank funds are unfrozen and the government can fund &quot;separate&quot; spaces and transportation for them.

When asked about the slaughter of Hazara Shia by the first Taliban régime, Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban nominee for Ambassador to the U.N. told Anderson &quot;The Hazara Shia for us are also Muslim. We believe we are one, like flowers in a garden.&quot; In late 2021, journalists from &quot;The New York Times&quot; embedded with a six-man Taliban unit tasked with protecting the Shi&#x27;ite Sakhi Shrine in Kabul from the Islamic State, noting &quot;how seriously the men appeared to take their assignment.&quot; The unit&#x27;s commander said that &quot;We do not care which ethnic group we serve, our goal is to serve and provide security for Afghans.&quot; In response to &quot;international criticism&quot; over lack of diversity, an ethnic Hazara was appointed deputy health minister, and an ethnic Tajik appointed deputy trade minister.

On the other hand, the Ministry of Women&#x27;s Affairs has been closed and its building is the new home of Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. According to Anderson, some women still employed by the government are &quot;being forced to sign in at their jobs and then go home, to create the illusion of equity&quot;; and the appointment of ethnic minorities has been dismissed by an &quot;adviser to the Taliban&quot; as tokenism.

Reports have &quot;circulated&quot; of
&quot;Hazara farmers being forced from their land by ethnic Pashtuns, of raids of activists&#x27; homes, and of extrajudicial executions of former government soldiers and intelligence agents&quot;.
According to a Human Rights Watch&#x27;s report released in November 2021, the Taliban killed or forcibly disappeared more than 100 former members of the Afghan security forces in the three months since the takeover in just the four provinces of Ghazni, Helmand, Kandahar, and Kunduz. According to the report, the Taliban identified targets for arrest and execution through intelligence operations and access to employment records that were left behind. Former members of the security forces were also killed by the Taliban within days of registering with them to receive a letter guaranteeing their safety.

Despite Taliban claims that the ISIS has been defeated, IS carried out suicide bombings in October 2021 at Shia mosques in Kunduz and Kandahar, killing over 115 people. As of late 2021, there were still &quot;sticky bomb&quot; explosions &quot;every few days&quot; in the capital Kabul.

Explanations for the relative moderation of the new Taliban government and statements from its officials such as – &quot;We have started a new page. We do not want to be entangled with the past,&quot; –?include that it did not expect to take over the country so quickly and still had &quot;problems to work out among&quot; their factions&quot;; that $7 billion in Afghan government funds in US banks has been frozen, and that the 80% of the previous government&#x27;s budget that came from &quot;the United States, its partners, or international lenders&quot;, has been shut off, creating serious economic crisis; according to the U.N. World Food Program country director, Mary Ellen McGroarty, as of late 2021, early 2022 &quot;22.8 million Afghans are already severely food insecure, and seven million of them are one step away from famine&quot;; and that the world community has &quot;unanimously&quot; asked the Taliban &quot;to form an inclusive government, ensure the rights of women and minorities and guarantee that Afghanistan will no more serve as the launching pad for global terrorist operations&quot;, before it recognizes the Taliban government. In conversation with journalist Anderson, senior Taliban leaders implied that the harsh application of sharia during their first era of rule in the 1990s was necessary because of the &quot;depravity&quot; and &quot;chaos&quot; that remained from the Soviet occupation, but that now &quot;mercy and compassion&quot; were the order of the day. This was contradicted by former senior members of the Ministry of Women&#x27;s Affairs, one of which who told Anderson, &quot;they will do anything to convince the international community to give them financing, but eventually I&#x27;ll be forced to wear the burqa again. They are just waiting.&quot;

After Taliban retook power in 2021, border clashes erupted between the Taliban with its neighbors includes Iran and Pakistan, leading to casualties on both sides.

In the early months of Taliban rule, international journalists have had some access to Afghanistan. In February 2022, several international journalists, including Andrew North were detained. The Committee to Protect Journalists described their detention as &quot;a sad reflection of the overall decline of press freedom and increasing attacks on journalists under Taliban rule.&quot; The journalists were released after several days. Subsequently, watchdog organizations have continued to document a number of arrests of local journalists, as well as barring access to international journalists.

The country&#x27;s small community of Sikhs - who form Afghanistan&#x27;s second largest religion - as well as Hindus, have reportedly been prevented from celebrating their holidays as of 2023 by the Taliban government. Despite this, the Taliban in a later statement praised the communities and assured that their private land and property will be secured. In April 2024, the former sole Sikh member of parliament, Narendra Singh Khalsa, returned to Afghanistan for the first time since the collapse of the Republic.

=====Current education policy=====
In September 2021, the government ordered primary schools to reopen for both sexes and announced plans to reopen secondary schools for male students, without committing to do the same for female students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham-Harrison 09/17/21&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While the Taliban stated that female college students will be able to resume higher education provided that they are segregated from male students (and professors, when possible),&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters 09/12/21&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that &quot;if the high schools do not reopen for girls, the commitments to allow university education would become meaningless once the current cohort of students graduated.&quot; Higher Education Minister Abdul Baqi Haqqani said that female university students will be required to observe proper hijab, but did not specify if this required covering the face.

Kabul University reopened in February 2022, with female students attending in the morning and males in the afternoon. Other than the closure of the music department, few changes to the curriculum were reported. Female students were officially required to wear an abaya and a hijab to attend, although some wore a shawl instead. Attendance was reportedly low on the first day.

In March 2022, the Taliban abruptly halted plans to allow girls to resume secondary school education even when separated from males. At the time, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that apart from university students, &quot;sixth is now the highest grade girls may attend&quot;. The Afghan Ministry of Education cited the lack of an acceptable design for female student uniforms.

On December 20, 2022, in violation of their prior promises, the Taliban banned female students from attending higher education institutions with immediate effect. The following day, December 21, 2022, the Taliban instituted a ban on all education for all girls and women around the country alongside a ban on female staff in schools, including teaching professions. Teaching was one of the last few remaining professions open to women.

== Ideology and aims ==

The Taliban&#x27;s ideology has been described as an &quot;innovative form of &quot;sharia&quot; combining Pashtun tribal codes&quot;, or Pashtunwali, with radical Deobandi interpretations of Islam favoured by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and its splinter groups. Their ideology was a departure from the Islamism of the anti-Soviet mujahideen rulers and the radical Islamists inspired by the Sayyid Qutb (Ikhwan). The Taliban have said they aim to restore peace and security to Afghanistan, including Western troops leaving, and to enforce &quot;Sharia&quot;, or Islamic law, once in power.

According to journalist Ahmed Rashid, at least in the first years of their rule, the Taliban adopted Deobandi and Islamist anti-nationalist beliefs, and they opposed &quot;tribal and feudal structures&quot;, removing traditional tribal or feudal leaders from leadership roles.

The Taliban strictly enforced their ideology in major cities like Herat, Kabul, and Kandahar. But in rural areas, the Taliban had little direct control, and as a result, they promoted village jirgas, so in rural areas, they did not enforce their ideology as stringently as they enforced it in cities.

=== Ideological influences ===
The Taliban&#x27;s religious/political philosophy, especially during its first régime from 1996 to 2001, was heavily advised and influenced by Grand Mufti Rashid Ahmed Ludhianvi and his works. Its operating political and religious principles since its founding, however, was modelled on those of Abul A&#x27;la Maududi and the Jamaat-e-Islami movement.

==== Pashtun cultural influences ====
The Taliban, being largely Pashtun tribesmen, frequently follow a pre-Islamic cultural tribal code which is focused on preserving honour. Pashtunwali strongly influences decisions in regards to other social matters. It is best described as subconscious social values and attitudes which promote various qualities such as bravery, preserving honour, being hospitable to all guests, seeking revenge and justice if one has been wronged, and providing sanctuary to anyone who seeks refuge, even if it is an enemy. However, non-Pashtuns and others usually criticize some of the values such as the Pashtun practice of equally dividing inheritances among sons, even though the Qur&#x27;an clearly states that women are supposed to receive one-half of a man&#x27;s share.

According to Ali A. Jalali and Lester Grau, the Taliban &quot;received extensive support from Pashtuns across the country who thought that the movement might restore their national dominance. Even Pashtun intellectuals in the West, who differed with the Taliban on many issues, expressed support for the movement on purely ethnic grounds.&quot;

=== Islamic rules under Deobandi philosophy ===
Written works published by the group&#x27;s Commission of Cultural Affairs including &quot;Islami Adalat&quot;, &quot;De Mujahid Toorah De Jihad Shari Misalay, and Guidance to the Mujahideen&quot; outlined the core of the Taliban Islamic Movement&#x27;s philosophy regarding jihad, sharia, organization, and conduct. The Taliban régime interpreted the &quot;Sharia&quot; law in accordance with the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence and the religious edicts of Mullah Omar. The Taliban, Mullah Omar in particular, emphasised dreams as a means of revelation.

==== Prohibitions ====
The Taliban forbade the consumption of pork and alcohol, the use of many types of consumer technology such as music with instrumental accompaniments, television, filming, and the Internet, as well as most forms of art such as paintings or photography, participation in sports, including football and chess; Recreational activities such as kite-flying and the keeping of pigeons and other pets were also forbidden, and the birds were killed according to the Taliban&#x27;s rules. Movie theatres were closed and repurposed as mosques. The celebration of the Western and Iranian New Years was also forbidden. Taking photographs and displaying pictures and portraits were also forbidden, because the Taliban considered them forms of idolatry. This extended even to &quot;blacking out illustrations on packages of baby soap in shops and painting over road-crossing signs for livestock.

Women were banned from working, girls were forbidden to attend schools or universities, were required to observe &quot;purdah&quot; (physical separation of the sexes) and &quot;awrah&quot; (concealing the body with clothing), and to be accompanied by male relatives outside their households; those who violated these restrictions were punished. Men were forbidden to shave their beards and they were also required to let them grow and keep them long according to the Taliban&#x27;s rules, and they were also required to wear turbans outside their households. Prayer was made compulsory and those men who did not respect the religious obligation after the &quot;azaan&quot; were arrested. Gambling was banned, and the Taliban punished thieves by amputating their hands or feet. In 2000, the Taliban&#x27;s leader Mullah Omar officially banned opium cultivation and drug trafficking in Afghanistan; the Taliban succeeded in nearly eradicating the majority of the opium production (99%) by 2001. During the Taliban&#x27;s governance of Afghanistan, drug users and dealers were both severely persecuted.

==== Views on the Bamyan Buddhas ====
In 1999, Mullah Omar issued a decree in which he called for the protection of the Buddha statues at Bamyan, two 6th-century monumental statues of standing buddhas which were carved into the side of a cliff in the Bamyan valley in the Hazarajat region of central Afghanistan. But in March 2001, the Taliban destroyed the statues, following a decree by Mullah Omar which stated: &quot;all the statues around Afghanistan must be destroyed.&quot;

Yahya Massoud, brother of the anti-Taliban and resistance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud, recalls the following incident after the destruction of the Buddha statues at Bamyan:

==== Views on &quot;bacha bazi&quot; ====

The Afghan custom of &quot;bacha bazi&quot;, a form of pederastic sexual slavery, child sexual abuse and pedophilia which is traditionally practiced in various provinces of Afghanistan between older men and young adolescent &quot;dancing boys&quot;, was also forbidden under the six-year rule of the Taliban régime. Under the rule of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, it carried the death penalty.

The practice remained illegal during the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan&#x27;s rule, but the laws were seldom enforced against powerful offenders and police had reportedly been complicit in related crimes. A controversy arose during the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan&#x27;s rule, after allegations surfaced that US government forces in Afghanistan after the invasion of the country deliberately ignored &quot;bacha bazi&quot;. The US military responded by claiming the abuse was largely the responsibility of the &quot;local Afghan government&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post 09/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban has criticized the US role in the abuse of Afghan children.

=== Attitudes towards other Muslim communities ===
Unlike other Islamic fundamentalist organizations, the Taliban are not Salafists. Although wealthy Arab nations had brought Salafist Madrasas to Afghanistan during the Soviet war in the 1980s, the Taliban&#x27;s strict Deobandi leadership suppressed the Salafi movement in Afghanistan after it first came to power in the 1990s. Following the 2001 US invasion, the Taliban and Salafists joined forces in order to wage a common war against NATO forces, but Salafists were relegated to small groups which were under the Taliban&#x27;s command.

The Taliban are averse to debating doctrine with other Muslims and &quot;did not allow even Muslim reporters to question [their] edicts or to discuss interpretations of the Qur&#x27;an.&quot;

==== Opposition to Salafism ====
Following the Taliban victory, a nationwide campaign was launched against influential Salafi factions suspected of past ties to the ISIS–K. The Taliban closed most Salafi mosques and seminaries in 16 provinces, including Nangarhar, and detained clerics it accused of supporting the Islamic State.

==== Shia Islam ====
During the period of the first Taliban rule (1996 to 2001), the Taliban attempted to sway Shias, particularly Hazaras, to their side, making deals with a number of Shia political figures, as well as securing the support of some Shia religious scholars. One of these was Ustad Muhammad Akbari, a Shia Hazara politician who separated from Abdul-Ali Mazari&#x27;s Islamic Unity Party to form the National Islamic Unity Party, thereafter politically aligning himself and his group, which gained the support of the majority of Islamic Unity Party members in the Hazara hinterland, with the Taliban. Another significant Shia political figure in the administration of the first Islamic Emirate was Sayed Gardizi, a Sayed Hazara from Gardiz, who was appointed as the &quot;wuluswal&quot; (district governor) of Yakawlang district, being the only Shia to hold the position of district governor during the period of the first Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

At the same time, however, certain incidents caused distrust between the Taliban and Afghan Shias. The 1998 Mazar-i-Sharif massacre was the most significant, having taken place in response to ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdur-Rashid Dustum&#x27;s betrayal and subsequent massacre of Taliban fighters, as well as false rumors that Hazaras had beheaded senior Taliban leader Mawlawi Ihsanullah Ihsan at the grave of Abdul-Ali Mazari, which led to the massacre of a significant number of Hazaras. The commander responsible for the massacre, Abdul-Manan Niazi, later became notable for his opposition to the Taliban&#x27;s leadership, having formed the rebellious High Council of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in 2015, before being killed, reportedly by the Taliban themselves.

The desire of the Taliban leadership to expand the group&#x27;s relations with Afghan Shias continued after the American invasion of Afghanistan and the group&#x27;s return to insurgency. Some time following the American Invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Taliban published &quot;A Message to the Mujahid People of Iraq and Afghanistan&quot; by Mullah Omar, in which he condemned sectarianism whilst jointly addressing the people of Iraq and Afghanistan, saying:&quot;It&#x27;s incumbent upon all Muslims to thwart all the cursed plots of the cunning enemy, and to not give him the opportunity to light the fires of disagreement amongst the Muslims. A major component of American policy is to categorize the Muslims in Iraq with the labels of Shī’ah and Sunnī, and in Afghanistan with the labels of Pashtun, Tājīk, Hazārah and Uzbek, in order to decrease the severity and strength of the popular uprisings and the accompanying armed resistance. […] As such, I request the brothers in Iraq to put behind them the differences that exist in the name of Shī’ah and Sunnī, and to fight in unity against the occupying enemy, for victory is not possible without unity.&quot;Multiple Hazara Shia Taliban commanders took part in the Taliban insurgency, primarily from Bamyan and Daikundi provinces. Among the Qarabaghi tribe of Shia Hazaras, a number of fighters voluntarily joined the Taliban, due to their close relations with the nearby Taliban-supporting Sunni Pashtun population. Additionally, a pro-government Shia Hazara militia from Gizab district of Daikundi province, called Fedayi, defected and pledged allegiance to the Taliban a few years prior to 2016, with a reported size of 50 fighters.

In reaction to the 2011 Afghanistan Ashura bombings, which targeted Shia Afghans in Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif, the Taliban published &quot;Sectarian Killings; A Dangerous Enemy Conspiracy&quot; by Taliban official Abdul-Qahhar Balkhi, in which he stated:
&quot;In Afghanistan, Sunnis and Shias have co-existed for centuries. They live communal lives and participate in their mutual festivities. And for centuries they have fought shoulder to shoulder against foreign invaders. [...] The majority of Shia populations in Bamyan, Daikundi and Hazarajat [have] actively aided and continue to support the Mujahideen against the foreigners and their puppets. The foreign occupiers seek to ignite the flames of communal hatred and violence between Sunnis and Shias in Afghanistan. [...] The followers of Islam will only ever reclaim their rightful place in this world if they forgo their petty differences and unite as a single egalitarian body.&quot;
In recent years, the Taliban have once again attempted to court Shiites, appointing a Shia cleric as a regional governor and recruiting Hazaras to fight against ISIS–K, in order to distance themselves from their past reputation and improve their relations with the Shia-led Government of Iran. After the 2021 Taliban offensive, which led to the restoration of the Islamic Emirate, senior Taliban officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Salam Hanafi and Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, have stressed the importance of unity between Shiites and Sunnis in Afghanistan and promised to protect the Shiite community. The Ministry of Virtue and Vice have also agreed to hire Shia Ulama in order to implement the ministry&#x27;s religious edicts. In general, the Taliban has maintained peace with most Muslims in the Shiite community, although the 2022 Balkhab uprising resulted in the deaths of some Hazaras.

=== Consistency of the Taliban&#x27;s ideology ===
The Taliban&#x27;s ideology is not static. Before its capture of Kabul, members of the Taliban talked about stepping aside once a government of &quot;good Muslims&quot; took power and once law and order were restored. The decision-making process of the Taliban in Kandahar was modelled on the Pashtun tribal council (&quot;jirga&quot;), together with what was believed to be the early Islamic model. Discussion was followed by the building of a consensus by the believers.

As the Taliban&#x27;s power grew, Mullah Omar made decisions without consulting the &quot;jirga&quot; or visiting other parts of the country. He visited the capital, Kabul, only twice while he was in power. Taliban spokesman Mullah Wakil explained:

Another sign that the Taliban&#x27;s ideology was evolving was Mullah Omar&#x27;s 1999 decree in which he called for the protection of the Buddha statues at Bamyan and the destruction of them in 2001.

=== Evaluations and criticisms ===
The author Ahmed Rashid suggests that the devastation and hardship which resulted from the Soviet invasion and the period which followed it influenced the Taliban&#x27;s ideology. It is said that the Taliban did not include scholars who were learned in Islamic law and history. The refugee students, brought up in a totally male society, not only had no education in mathematics, science, history or geography, but also had no traditional skills of farming, herding, or handicraft-making, nor even knowledge of their tribal and clan lineages. In such an environment, war meant employment, peace meant unemployment. Dominating women simply affirmed manhood. For their leadership, rigid fundamentalism was a matter not only of principle, but also of political survival. Taliban leaders &quot;repeatedly told&quot; Rashid that &quot;if they gave women greater freedom or a chance to go to school, they would lose the support of their rank and file.&quot;
The Taliban have been criticized for their strictness towards those who disobeyed their imposed rules, and Mullah Omar has been criticized for titling himself Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin.

Mullah Omar was criticized for calling himself Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin on the grounds that he lacked scholarly learning, tribal pedigree, or connections to the Prophet&#x27;s family. Sanction for the title traditionally required the support of all of the country&#x27;s ulema, whereas only some 1,200 Pashtun Taliban-supporting Mullahs had declared that Omar was the Amir. According to Ahmed Rashid, &quot;no Afghan had adopted the title since 1834, when King Dost Mohammed Khan assumed the title before he declared jihad against the Sikh kingdom in Peshawar. But Dost Mohammed was fighting foreigners, while Omar had declared jihad against other Afghans.&quot;

Another criticism was that the Taliban called their 20% tax on truckloads of opium &quot;zakat&quot;, which is traditionally limited to 2.5% of the zakat-payers&#x27; disposable income (or wealth).

The Taliban have been compared to the 7th-century Kharijites who developed extreme doctrines which set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to &quot;takfir&quot;, whereby they declared that other Muslims were unbelievers and deemed them worthy of death.

In particular, the Taliban have been accused of &quot;takfir&quot; towards Shia. After the August 1998 slaughter of 8,000 mostly Shia Hazara non-combatants in Mazar-i-Sharif, Mullah Abdul Manan Niazi, the Taliban commander of the attack and the new governor of Mazar, who was later killed by the Taliban after forming the rebellious High Council of the Islamic Emirate, declared from Mazar&#x27;s central mosque:
Last year you rebelled against us and killed us. From all your homes you shot at us. Now we are here to deal with you. The Hazaras are not Muslims and now have to kill Hazaras. You either accept to be Muslims or leave Afghanistan. Wherever you go we will catch you. If you go up we will pull you down by your feet; if you hide below, we will pull you up by your hair.Carter Malkasian, in one of the first comprehensive historical works on the Afghan war, argues that the Taliban are oversimplified in most portrayals. While Malkasian thinks that &quot;oppressive&quot; remains the best word to describe them, he points out that the Taliban managed to do what multiple governments and political players failed to: bring order and unity to the &quot;ungovernable land&quot;. The Taliban curbed the atrocities and excesses of the Warlord period of the civil war from 19921996. Malkasian further argues that the Taliban&#x27;s imposing of Islamic ideals upon the Afghan tribal system was innovative and a key reason for their success and durability. Given that traditional sources of authority had been shown to be weak in the long period of civil war, only religion had proved strong in Afghanistan. In a period of 40 years of constant conflict, the traditionalist Islam of the Taliban proved to be far more stable, even if the order they brought was &quot;an impoverished peace&quot;.

== Condemned practices ==
The Taliban have been internationally condemned for their harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic &quot;Sharia&quot; law, which has resulted in their brutal treatment of many Afghans. During their rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban enforced a strict interpretation of &quot;Sharia&quot;, or Islamic law. The Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians, denied UN food supplies to 160,000 starving civilians, and conducted a policy of scorched earth, burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes. While the Taliban controlled Afghanistan, they banned activities and media including paintings, photography, and movies that depicted people or other living things. They also prohibited music with instrumental accompaniments, with the exception of the daf, a type of frame drum. The Taliban prevented girls and young women from attending school, banned women from working jobs outside of healthcare (male doctors were prohibited from treating women), and required that women be accompanied by a male relative and wear a burqa at all times when in public. If women broke certain rules, they were publicly whipped or executed. The Taliban harshly discriminated against religious and ethnic minorities during their rule and they have also committed a cultural genocide against the people of Afghanistan by destroying numerous monuments, including the famous 1500-year-old Buddhas of Bamiyan. According to the United Nations, the Taliban and their allies were responsible for 76% of Afghan civilian casualties in 2010, and 80% in 2011 and 2012. The group is internally funded by its involvement in the illegal drug trade which it participates in by producing and trafficking in narcotics such as heroin, extortion, and kidnapping for ransom. They also seized control of mining operations in the mid-2010s that were illegal under the previous government.

=== Massacre campaigns ===
According to a 55-page report by the United Nations, the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians. UN officials stated that there had been &quot;15 massacres&quot; between 1996 and 2001. They also said, that &quot;[t]hese have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the [Taliban] Ministry of Defense or to Mullah Omar himself.&quot; &quot;These are the same type of war crimes as were committed in Bosnia and should be prosecuted in international courts&quot;, one UN official was quoted as saying. The documents also reveal the role of Arab and Pakistani support troops in these killings. Bin Laden&#x27;s so-called 055 Brigade was responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians. The report by the United Nations quotes &quot;eyewitnesses in many villages describing Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people&quot;. The Taliban&#x27;s former ambassador to Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, in late 2011 stated that cruel behaviour under and by the Taliban had been &quot;necessary&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the United Nations accused the Taliban of denying emergency food by the UN&#x27;s World Food Programme to 160,000 hungry and starving people &quot;for political and military reasons&quot;. The UN said the Taliban were starving people for their military agenda and using humanitarian assistance as a weapon of war.

On 8 August 1998, the Taliban launched an attack on Mazar-i-Sharif. Of 1500 defenders only 100 survived the engagement. Once in control the Taliban began to kill people indiscriminately. At first shooting people in the street, they soon began to target Hazaras. Women were raped, and thousands of people were locked in containers and left to suffocate. This ethnic cleansing left an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 people dead. At this time ten Iranian diplomats and a journalist were killed. Iran assumed the Taliban had murdered them, and mobilised its army, deploying men along the border with Afghanistan. By the middle of September there were 250,000 Iranian personnel stationed on the border. Pakistan mediated and the bodies were returned to Tehran towards the end of the month. The killings of the diplomats had been carried out by Sipah-e-Sahaba, a Pakistani Sunni group with close ties to the ISI. They burned orchards, crops and destroyed irrigation systems, and forced more than 100,000 people from their homes with hundreds of men, women and children still unaccounted for.

In a major effort to retake the Shomali Plains to the north of Kabul from the United Front, the Taliban indiscriminately killed civilians, while uprooting and expelling the population. Among others, Kamal Hossein, a special reporter for the UN, reported on these and other war crimes. In Istalif, a town famous for handmade potteries and which was home to more than 45,000 people, the Taliban gave 24 hours&#x27; notice to the population to leave, then completely razed the town leaving the people destitute.

In 1999, the town of Bamian was taken, hundreds of men, women and children were executed. Houses were razed and some were used for forced labour. There was a further massacre at the town of Yakaolang in January 2001. An estimated 300 people were murdered, along with two delegations of Hazara elders who had tried to intercede.

By 1999, the Taliban had forced hundreds of thousands of people from the Shomali Plains and other regions conducting a policy of scorched earth burning homes, farm land and gardens.

=== Human trafficking ===
Several Taliban and al-Qaeda commanders ran a network of human trafficking, abducting ethnic minority women and selling them into sex slavery in Afghanistan and Pakistan. &quot;Time&quot; magazine writes: &quot;The Taliban often argued that the restrictions they placed on women were actually a way of revering and protecting the opposite sex. The behavior of the Taliban during the six years they expanded their rule in Afghanistan made a mockery of that claim.&quot;

The targets for human trafficking were especially women from the Tajik, Uzbek, Hazara and other non-Pashtun ethnic groups in Afghanistan. Some women preferred to commit suicide over slavery, killing themselves. During one Taliban and al-Qaeda offensive in 1999 in the Shomali Plains alone, more than 600 women were kidnapped. Arab and Pakistani al-Qaeda militants, with local Taliban forces, forced them into trucks and buses. &quot;Time&quot; magazine writes: &quot;The trail of the missing Shomali women leads to Jalalabad, not far from the Pakistan border. There, according to eyewitnesses, the women were penned up inside Sar Shahi camp in the desert. The more desirable among them were selected and taken away. Some were trucked to Peshawar with the apparent complicity of Pakistani border guards. Others were taken to Khost, where bin Laden had several training camps.&quot; Officials from relief agencies say, the trail of many of the vanished women leads to Pakistan where they were sold to brothels or into private households to be kept as slaves.

=== Oppression of women ===



Brutal repression of women was widespread under the Taliban and it received significant international condemnation. Abuses were myriad and violently enforced by the religious police. For example, the Taliban issued edicts forbidding women from being educated, forcing girls to leave schools and colleges. Women who were leaving their houses were required to be accompanied by a male relative and were obligated to wear the &quot;burqa&quot;, a traditional dress covering the entire body except for a small slit out of which to see. Those women who were accused of disobedience were publicly beaten. In one instance, a young woman named Sohaila was charged with adultery after she was caught walking with a man who was not a relative; she was publicly flogged in Ghazi Stadium, receiving 100 lashes. Female employment was restricted to the medical sector, where male medical personnel were prohibited from treating women and girls. This extensive ban on the employment of women further resulted in the widespread closure of primary schools, as almost all teachers prior to the Taliban&#x27;s rise had been women, further restricting access to education not only to girls but also to boys. Restrictions became especially severe after the Taliban took control of the capital. In February 1998, for instance, religious police forced all women off the streets of Kabul and issued new regulations which ordered people to blacken their windows so that women would not be visible from outside.

====Ban on women&#x27;s participation in the healthcare sector====
In December 2024, the Taliban&#x27;s health ministry banned women from being trained in nursing and midwifery, according to media reports confirmed by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. This was a reversal of an earlier February 2024 decision to permit basic medical training for women. According to &quot;NPR&quot;, the health ministry had lobbied for an exemption from the general ban on women&#x27;s education in the healthcare sector because &quot;in some provinces, the Taliban does not allow women to seek treatment from male medical professionals.&quot; The Taliban&#x27;s ban on basic medical training for women was widely condemned by human rights organizations as a danger to the health and well-being of Afghan women and children, with Afghanistan already having among the highest maternal mortality ratios in the world according to 2020 data, before the Taliban&#x27;s 2021 seizure of power. For example, Heather Barr of Human Right Watch stated: &quot;If you ban women from being treated by male healthcare professionals, and then you ban women from training to become healthcare professionals, the consequences are clear: women will not have access to healthcare and will die as a result.&quot; The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) stated that the ban &quot;is profoundly discriminatory, short-sighted and puts the lives of women and girls at risk in multiple ways.&quot;

=== Violence against civilians ===
According to the United Nations, the Taliban and its allies were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009, 75% in 2010 and 80% in 2011.

According to Human Rights Watch, the Taliban&#x27;s bombings and other attacks which have led to civilian casualties &quot;sharply escalated in 2006&quot; when &quot;at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at non-combatants.&quot;
The United Nations reported that the number of civilians killed by both the Taliban and pro-government forces in the war rose nearly 50% between 2007 and 2009. The high number of civilians killed by the Taliban is blamed in part on their increasing use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), &quot;for instance, 16 IEDs have been planted in girls&#x27; schools&quot; by the Taliban.

In 2009, Colonel Richard Kemp, formerly Commander of British forces in Afghanistan and the intelligence coordinator for the British government, drew parallels between the tactics and strategy of Hamas in Gaza to those of the Taliban. Kemp wrote:

=== Discrimination against Hindus and Sikhs ===
Hindus and Sikhs have lived in Afghanistan since historic times and they were prominent minorities in Afghanistan, well-established in terms of academics and businesses. After the Afghan Civil War they started to migrate to India and other nations. After the Taliban established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, they imposed strict &quot;Sharia&quot; laws which discriminated against Hindus and Sikhs and caused the size of Afghanistan&#x27;s Hindu and Sikh populations to fall at a very rapid rate because they emigrated from Afghanistan and established diasporas in the Western world. The Taliban issued decrees that forbade non-Muslims from building places of worship but allowed them to worship at existing holy sites, forbade non-Muslims from criticizing Muslims, ordered non-Muslims to identify their houses by placing a yellow cloth on their rooftops, forbade non-Muslims from living in the same residence as Muslims, and required that non-Muslim women wear a yellow dress with a special mark so that Muslims could keep their distance from them (Hindus and Sikhs were mainly targeted). The Taliban announced in May 2001 that it would force Afghanistan&#x27;s Hindu population to wear special badges, which has been compared to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. In general, the Taliban treated the Sikhs better than Afghan Shiites, Hindus and Christians.

=== Relationship with other religious groups ===

Along with Hindus, the small Christian community was also persecuted by the Taliban. Violence against Western aid workers and Christians was common during the Afghan conflict.

On several occasions between 2008 and 2012, the Taliban claimed that they assassinated Western and Afghani medical or aid workers in Afghanistan, because they feared that the polio vaccine would make Muslim children sterile, because they suspected that the &#x27;medical workers&#x27; were really spies, or because they suspected that the medical workers were proselytizing Christianity.

In August 2008, three Western women (British, Canadian, US) who were working for the aid group &#x27;International Rescue Committee&#x27; were murdered in Kabul. The Taliban claimed that they killed them because they were foreign spies. In October 2008, the British woman Gayle Williams working for Christian UK charity &#x27;SERVE Afghanistan&#x27; – focusing on training and education for disabled persons – was murdered near Kabul. Taliban claimed they killed her because her organisation &quot;was preaching Christianity in Afghanistan&quot;. In all 2008 until October, 29 aid workers, 5 of whom non-Afghanis, were killed in Afghanistan.

In August 2010, the Taliban claimed that they murdered 10 medical aid workers while they were passing through Badakhshan Province on their way from Kabul to Nuristan Province – but the Afghan Islamic party/militia Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin has also claimed responsibility for those killings. The victims were six Americans, one Briton, one German and two Afghanis, working for a self-proclaimed &quot;non-profit, Christian organization&quot; which is named &#x27;International Assistance Mission&#x27;. The Taliban stated that they murdered them because they were proselytizing Christianity and possessing which were translated into the Dari language when they were encountered. IAM contended that they &quot;were not missionaries&quot;.

In December 2012, unidentified gunmen killed four female UN polio-workers in Karachi in Pakistan; the Western news media suggested that there was a connection between the outspokenness of the Taliban and objections to and suspicions of such &#x27;polio vaccinations&#x27;. Eventually in 2012, a Pakistani Taliban commander in North Waziristan in Pakistan banned polio vaccinations, and in March 2013, the Afghan government was forced to suspend its vaccination efforts in Nuristan Province because the Taliban was extremely influential in the province. However, in May 2013, the Taliban&#x27;s leaders changed their stance on polio vaccinations, saying that the vaccine is the only way to prevent polio and they also stated that they will work with immunization volunteers as long as polio workers are &quot;unbiased&quot; and &quot;harmonized with the regional conditions, Islamic values and local cultural traditions.&quot;
During the first period of Taliban rule, only two known Jews were left in Afghanistan, Zablon Simintov and Isaac Levy (c. 1920–2005). Levy relied on charity to survive, while Simintov ran a store selling carpets and jewelry until 2001. They lived on opposite sides of the dilapidated Kabul synagogue. They kept denouncing each other to the authorities, and both spent time in jail for continuously &quot;arguing&quot;. The Taliban also confiscated the synagogue&#x27;s Torah scroll. However, the two men were later released from prison when Taliban officials became annoyed by their arguing. After August 2021, the last Jew Simintov and his relative left Afghanistan, ended centuries of Jewish presence in the country.

=== Restrictions on modern education ===
Before the Taliban came to power, education was highly regarded in Afghanistan and Kabul University attracted students from Asia and the Middle East. However, the Taliban imposed restrictions on modern education, banned the education of females, only allowed Islamic religious schools to stay open and only encouraged the teaching of the Qur&#x27;an. Around half of all of the schools in Afghanistan were destroyed. The Taliban have carried out brutal attacks on teachers and students and they have also threatened parents and teachers.
As per a 1998 UNICEF report, 9 out of 10 girls and 2 out of 3 boys did not enroll in schools. By 2000, fewer than 4–5% of all Afghan children were being educated at the primary school level and even fewer of them were being educated at higher secondary and university levels.

Attacks on educational institutions, students and teachers and the forced enforcement of Islamic teachings have even continued after the Taliban were deposed from power. In December 2017, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that over 1,000 schools had been destroyed, damaged or occupied and 100 teachers and students had been killed by the Taliban.

=== Cultural genocide ===
The Taliban have committed a cultural genocide against the Afghan people by destroying their historical and cultural texts, artifacts and sculptures.

In the early 1990s, the National Museum of Afghanistan was attacked and looted numerous times, resulting in the loss of 70% of the 100,000 artifacts of Afghan culture and history which were then on display.

On 11 August 1998, the Taliban destroyed the Puli Khumri Public Library. The library contained a collection of over 55,000 books and old manuscripts, one of the most valuable and beautiful collections of Afghanistan&#x27;s cultural works according to the Afghan people.

On 2 March 2001, the Buddhas of Bamiyan were destroyed with dynamite, on orders from the Taliban&#x27;s leader Mullah Omar.

In October of the same year, the Taliban &quot;took sledgehammers and axes to thousands of years’ worth of artifacts&quot; in the National Museum of Afghanistan, destroying at least 2,750 ancient works of art.

Afghanistan has a rich musical culture, where music plays an important part in social functions like births and marriages and it has also played a major role in uniting an ethnically diverse country. However, since it came to power and even after it was deposed, the Taliban has banned most music, including cultural folk music, and it has also attacked and killed a number of musicians.

=== Ban on entertainment and recreational activities ===
During their first rule of Afghanistan which lasted from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban banned many recreational activities and games, such as association football, kite flying, and chess. Mediums of entertainment such as televisions, cinemas, music with instrumental accompaniments, VCRs and satellite dishes were also banned. Also included on the list of banned items were &quot;musical instruments and accessories&quot; and all visual representation of living creatures. However, the daf, a type of frame drum, wasn&#x27;t banned.

It was reported that when Afghan children were caught kiting, a highly popular activity, they were beaten. When Khaled Hosseini learned through a 1999 news report that the Taliban had banned kite flying, a restriction he found particularly cruel, the news &quot;struck a personal chord&quot; for him, as he had grown up with the sport while living in Afghanistan. Hosseini was motivated to write a 25-page short story about two boys who fly kites in Kabul that he later developed into his first novel, &quot;The Kite Runner&quot;.

=== Forced conscription and conscription of children ===

According to the testimony of Guantanamo captives before their Combatant Status Review Tribunals, the Taliban, in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers, also conscripted men to staff its civil service – both done at gunpoint.

According to a report from Oxford University, the Taliban made widespread use of the conscription of children in 1997, 1998 and 1999. The report states that during the civil war that preceded the Taliban régime, thousands of orphaned boys joined various militia for &quot;employment, food, shelter, protection and economic opportunity.&quot; The report said that during its initial period, the Taliban &quot;long depended upon cohorts of youth&quot;. Witnesses stated that each land-owning family had to provide one young man and $500 in expenses. In August of that year 5000 students aged between 15 and 35 left madrassas in Pakistan to join the Taliban.

== Leadership and organization ==

;Kandahar faction and Haqqani network
According to Jon Lee Anderson the Taliban government is &quot;said to be profoundly divided&quot; between the Kandahar faction and the Haqqani network, with a mysterious dispearance of deputy Prime Minister Abdul Ghani Baradar for &quot;several days&quot; in mid-September 2021 explained by rumours of injury after a brawl with other Taliban. The Kandahar faction is named for the city that Mullah Omar came from and where he founded the Taliban, and is described as &quot;insular&quot; and &quot;rural&quot;, interested &quot;primarily&quot; with &quot;ruling its home turf&quot;. It includes Haibatullah Akhundzada, Mullah Yaqoob, Abdul Ghani Baradar (see below).

The family-based Haqqani network, by contrast are &quot;closely linked to Pakistan&#x27;s secret services&quot;, &quot;interested in global jihad&quot;, with its founder (Jalaluddin Haqqani) &quot;connected&quot; the Taliban with Osama bin Laden. It is named for its founder Jalaluddin Haqqani and is currently led by Sirajuddin Haqqani, and includes Khalil Haqqani, Mawlawi Mohammad Salim Saad.
With Sirajuddin Haqqani as acting interior minister, as of February 2022, the network has control of &quot;a preponderance of security positions in Afghanistan&quot;.

Taliban leadership have denied tension between factions. Suhail Shaheen states &quot;there is &quot;one&quot; Taliban&quot;, and Zabihullah Mujahid (acting Deputy Minister of Information and Culture), even maintains &quot;there is no Haqqani network.&quot;

=== Current leadership ===
The top members of the Taliban as an insurgency, as of August 2021, are:
*Haibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban&#x27;s Supreme Leader since 2016, a religious scholar from Kandahar province.
*Abdul Ghani Baradar, co-founder of the movement alongside Mullah Omar, was deputy Prime Minister as of March 2022. From Uruzgan province, he was imprisoned in Pakistan before his release at the request of the United States.
*Mullah Yaqoob, the son of the Taliban&#x27;s founder Mullah Omar and leader of the group&#x27;s military operations.
*Sirajuddin Haqqani, leader of the Haqqani network is acting interior minister as of February 2022, with authority over police and intelligence services. He oversees the group&#x27;s financial and military assets between the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The U.S. government has a $10 million bounty for his arrest brought on by several terrorist attacks on hotels and the Indian Embassy.
*Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, former head of the group&#x27;s political office in Doha. From Logar province, he holds a university master&#x27;s degree and trained as a cadet at the Indian Military Academy.
*Abdul Hakim Ishaqzai, chief negotiatior of the group&#x27;s political office in Doha, replacing Stanikzai in 2020. Heads the Taliban&#x27;s powerful council of religious scholars.
*Suhail Shaheen, Taliban nominee for Ambassador to the U.N.; former spokesperson of the Taliban&#x27;s political office in Doha. University educated in Pakistan, he was editor of the English language &quot;Kabul Times&quot; in the 1990s and served as a deputy ambassador to Pakistan at the time.
*Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban&#x27;s spokesperson since 2007. He revealed himself to the public for the first time after the group&#x27;s capture of Kabul in 2021.

All the top leadership of the Taliban are ethnic Pashtuns, more specifically those belonging of the Ghilzai confederation.

=== Overview ===

Until his death in 2013, Mullah Mullah Omar was the supreme commander of the Taliban. Mullah Akhtar Mansour was elected as his replacement in 2015, and following Mansour&#x27;s killing in a May 2016 US drone strike, Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada became the group&#x27;s leader.

The Taliban initially enjoyed goodwill from Afghans weary of the warlords&#x27; corruption, brutality, and incessant fighting.
This popularity was not universal, particularly among non-Pashtuns.

In 2001, the Taliban, &quot;de jure&quot;, controlled 85% of Afghanistan. &quot;De facto&quot; the areas under its direct control were mainly Afghanistan&#x27;s major cities and highways. Tribal khans and warlords had &quot;de facto&quot; direct control over various small towns, villages, and rural areas.
Rashid described the Taliban government as &quot;a secret society run by Kandaharis ... mysterious, secretive, and dictatorial.&quot; They did not hold elections, as their spokesman explained:

They modelled their decision-making process on the Pashtun tribal council (&quot;jirga&quot;), together with what they believed to be the early Islamic model. Discussion was followed by a building of a consensus by the &quot;believers&quot;. Before capturing Kabul, there was talk of stepping aside once a government of &quot;good Muslims&quot; took power, and law and order were restored.

As the Taliban&#x27;s power grew, decisions were made by Mullah Omar without consulting the &quot;jirga&quot; and without consulting other parts of the country. He visited the capital, Kabul, only twice while in power. Instead of an election, their leader&#x27;s legitimacy came from an oath of allegiance (&quot;Bay&#x27;ah&quot;), in imitation of the Prophet and the first four Caliphs. On 4 April 1996, Mullah Omar had &quot;the Cloak of the Prophet Mohammed&quot; taken from its shrine for the first time in 60 years. Wrapping himself in the relic, he appeared on the roof of a building in the center of Kandahar while hundreds of Pashtun mullahs below shouted &quot;Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin!&quot; (Commander of the Faithful), in a pledge of support. Taliban spokesman Mullah Wakil explained:

The Taliban were very reluctant to share power, and since their ranks were overwhelmingly Pashtun they ruled as overlords over the 60% of Afghans from other ethnic groups. In local government, such as Kabul city council or Herat, Taliban loyalists, not locals, dominated, even when the Pashto-speaking Taliban could not communicate with the roughly half of the population who spoke Dari or other non-Pashtun tongues. Critics complained that this &quot;lack of local representation in urban administration made the Taliban appear as an occupying force.&quot;

=== Organization and governance ===
Consistent with the governance of the early Muslims was the absence of state institutions and the absence of &quot;a methodology for command and control&quot;, both of which are standard today, even in non-Westernized states. The Taliban did not issue press releases or policy statements, nor did they hold regular press conferences. The basis for this structure was Grand Mufti Rashid Ahmed Ludhianvi&#x27;s &quot;Obedience to the Amir,&quot; as he served as a mentor to the Taliban&#x27;s leadership. The outside world and most Afghans did not even know what their leaders looked like, because photography was banned. The &quot;regular army&quot; resembled a lashkar or traditional tribal militia force with only 25,000 men (of whom 11,000 were non-Afghans).

Cabinet ministers and deputies were mullahs with a &quot;madrasah education&quot;. Several of them, such as the Minister of Health and the Governor of the State bank, were primarily military commanders who left their administrative posts and fought whenever they were needed. Military reverses that trapped them behind enemy lines or led to their deaths increased the chaos in the national administration. At the national level, &quot;all senior Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara bureaucrats&quot; were replaced &quot;with Pashtuns, whether qualified or not&quot;. Consequently, the ministries &quot;by and large ceased to function&quot;.

The Ministry of Finance did not have a budget nor did it have a &quot;qualified economist or banker&quot;. Mullah Omar collected and dispersed cash without bookkeeping.

== Economic activities ==
The Kabul money markets responded positively during the first weeks of the Taliban occupation (1996). But the Afghani soon fell in value. They imposed a 50% tax on any company operating in the country, and those who failed to pay were attacked. They also imposed a 6% import tax on anything brought into the country, and by 1998 had control of the major airports and border crossings which allowed them to establish a monopoly on all trade. By 2001, the per capita income of the 25 million population was under $200, and the country was close to total economic collapse. As of 2007 the economy had begun to recover, with estimated foreign reserves of three billion dollars and a 13% increase in economic growth.

Under the Transit treaty between Afghanistan and Pakistan, a massive network for smuggling developed. It had an estimated turnover of 2.5 billion dollars with the Taliban receiving between $100 and $130 million per year. These operations along with the trade from the Golden Crescent financed the war in Afghanistan and also had the side effect of destroying start up industries in Pakistan. Ahmed Rashid also explained that the Afghan Transit Trade agreed on by Pakistan was &quot;the largest official source of revenue for the Taliban.&quot;

Between 1996 and 1999, Mullah Omar reversed his opinions on the drug trade, apparently as it only harmed kafirs. The Taliban controlled 96% of Afghanistan&#x27;s poppy fields and made opium its largest source of taxation. Taxes on opium exports became one of the mainstays of Taliban income and their war economy. According to Rashid, &quot;drug money funded the weapons, ammunition and fuel for the war.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Finance Minister of the United Front, Wahidullah Sabawoon, declared the Taliban had no annual budget but that they &quot;appeared to spend US$300 million a year, nearly all of it on war.&quot; He added that the Taliban had come to increasingly rely on three sources of money: &quot;poppy, the Pakistanis and bin Laden.&quot;

In an economic sense it seems he had little choice, as the war of attrition continued with the Northern Alliance the income from continued opium production was all that prevented the country from starvation. By 2000, Afghanistan accounted for an estimated 75% of the world&#x27;s supply and in 2000 grew an estimated 3276 tonnes of opium from poppy cultivation on 82,171 hectares. At this juncture Omar passed a decree banning the cultivation of opium, and production dropped to an estimated 74 metric tonnes from poppy cultivation on 1,685 hectares. Many observers say the ban – which came in a bid for international recognition at the United Nations – was only issued in order to raise opium prices and increase profit from the sale of large existing stockpiles. 1999 had yielded a record crop and had been followed by a lower but still large 2000 harvest. The trafficking of accumulated stocks by the Taliban continued in 2000 and 2001. In 2002, the UN mentioned the &quot;existence of significant stocks of opiates accumulated during previous years of bumper harvests.&quot; In September 2001 – before the 11 September attacks against the United States – the Taliban allegedly authorised Afghan peasants to sow opium again.

There was also an environmental toll to the country, heavy deforestation from the illegal trade in timber with hundreds of acres of pine and cedar forests in Kunar Province and Paktya being cleared. Throughout the country millions of acres were denuded to supply timber to the Pakistani markets, with no attempt made at reforestation, which has led to significant environmental damage. By 2001, when the Afghan Interim Administration took power the country&#x27;s infrastructure was in ruins, Telecommunications had failed, the road network was destroyed and Ministry of Finance buildings were in such a state of disrepair some were on the verge of collapse. On 6 July 1999, then president Bill Clinton signed into effect executive order 13129. This order implemented a complete ban on any trade between America and the Taliban régime and on 10 August they froze £5,000,000 in Ariana assets. On 19 December 2000, UN resolution 1333 was passed. It called for all assets to be frozen and for all states to close any offices belonging to the Taliban. This included the offices of Ariana Afghan Airlines. In 1999, the UN had passed resolution 1267 which had banned all international flights by Ariana apart from preapproved humanitarian missions.

According to the lawsuit, filed in December 2019 in the D.C. District Court on behalf of Gold Star families, some US defense contractors involved in Afghanistan made illegal &quot;protection payments&quot; to the Taliban, funding a &quot;Taliban-led terrorist insurgency&quot; that killed or wounded thousands of Americans in Afghanistan. In 2009, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the &quot;protection money&quot; was &quot;one of the major sources of funding for the Taliban.&quot;

It is estimated that in 2020 the Taliban had an income of $1.6 billion, mostly from drugs, mining, extortion and taxes, donations and exports.

On 2 November 2021, the Taliban required that all economic transactions in Afghanistan use Afghanis and banned the use of all foreign currency.

In 2022 construction on the Qosh Tepa Canal began in northern Afghanistan.

On 20 April 2024, the Taliban decided to abolish Afghanistan&#x27;s pension system as Hibatullah Akhundzada claimed it was “un-Islamic”, which prompted protests by retirees and older veterans of the Afghan Armed Forces in Kabul. The protest was dispersed by the Taliban.

== International relations ==

During the war, the Taliban were supported by several militant outfits which include the Haqqani network, Al-Qaeda and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. Several countries like China, Iran, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia and Saudi Arabia allegedly support the Taliban. However, all of their governments deny providing any support to the Taliban. Likewise, the Taliban also deny receiving any foreign support from any country. At its peak, formal diplomatic recognition of the Taliban&#x27;s government was acknowledged by three nations: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. In the past, the United Arab Emirates and Turkmenistan were also alleged to have provided support to the Taliban. It is designated by some countries as a terrorist organization.

During its time in power (1996–2001), at its height ruling 90% of Afghanistan, the Taliban régime, or Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, gained diplomatic recognition from only three states: the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, all of which provided substantial aid. The most other nations and organizations, including the United Nations, recognised the government of the Islamic State of Afghanistan (1992–2002) (parts of whom were part of the United Front, also called Northern Alliance) as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. Regarding its relations with the rest of the world, the Taliban&#x27;s Emirate of Afghanistan held a policy of isolationism: &quot;The Taliban believe in non-interference in the affairs of other countries and similarly desire no outside interference in their country&#x27;s internal affairs&quot;.

Traditionally, the Taliban were supported by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, while Iran, Russia, Turkey, India, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan formed an anti-Taliban alliance and supported the Northern Alliance. After the fall of the Taliban régime at the end of 2001, the composition of the Taliban supporters changed. According to a study by scholar Antonio Giustozzi, in the years 2005 to 2015 most of the financial support came from the states Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, and Qatar, as well as from private donors from Saudi Arabia, from al-Qaeda and, for a short period of time, from the Islamic State. About 54 percent of the funding came from foreign governments, 10 percent from private donors from abroad, and 16 percent from al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. In 2014, the amount of external support was close to $900 million.

Following the Taliban&#x27;s ascension to power, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan&#x27;s model of governance has been widely criticized by the international community, despite the government&#x27;s repeated calls for international recognition and engagement. Acting Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund stated that his interim administration has met all conditions required for official recognition. In a bid to gain recognition, the Taliban sent a letter in September 2021 to the UN to accept Suhail Shaheen as Permanent Representative of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan – a request that had already been rejected by the UN Credentials Committee in 2021.

With regards to international relations after the Taliban seizure of Afghanistan in 2021, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen told the Russian news agency &quot;Sputnik&quot;: &quot;Of course, we won&#x27;t have any relations with Israel. We want to have relations with other countries; Israel is not among these countries. We would like to have relations with all the regional countries and neighbouring countries as well as Asian countries.&quot;

On 10 October 2021, Russia hosted the Taliban for talks in Moscow in an effort to boost its influence across Central Asia. Officials from 10 different countries – Russia, China, Pakistan, India, Iran and five formerly Soviet Central Asian states – attended the talks, which were held during the Taliban&#x27;s first official trip to Europe since their return to power in mid-August 2021. The Taliban won backing from the 10 regional powers for the idea of a United Nations donor conference to help the country stave off economic collapse and a humanitarian catastrophe, calling for the UN to convene such a conference as soon as possible to help rebuild the country. Russian officials also called for action against Islamic State (IS) fighters, who Russia said have started to increase their presence in Afghanistan since the Taliban&#x27;s takeover. The Taliban delegation, which was led by Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Salam Hanafi, said that &quot;Isolating Afghanistan is in no one&#x27;s interests,&quot; arguing that the extremist group did not pose any security threat to any other country. The Taliban asked the international community to recognize its government, but no country has yet recognized the new Afghan government.

On 23 January 2022, a Taliban delegation arrived in Oslo, and closed-door meetings were held during the Taliban&#x27;s first official trip to Western Europe and second official trip to Europe since their return to power. Western diplomats told the Taliban that humanitarian aid to Afghanistan would be tied to an improvement in human rights. The Taliban delegation, led by acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, met senior French foreign ministry officials, Britain&#x27;s special envoy Nigel Casey, EU Special Representative for Afghanistan and members of the Norwegian foreign ministry. This followed the announcement by the UN Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee that the committee would extend a travel ban exemption until 21 March 2022 for 14 listed Taliban members to continue attending talks, along with a limited asset-freeze exemption for the financing of exempted travel. However, the Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said that the international community&#x27;s call for the formation of an inclusive government was a political &quot;excuse&quot; after the 3-day Oslo visit.

At the United Nations Security Council meeting in New York on 26 January 2022, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said the Oslo talks appeared to have been &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;genuine&quot;. Norway says the talks do &quot;not represent a legitimisation or recognition of the Taliban&quot;. In the same meeting, the Russian Federation&#x27;s delegate said attempts to engage the Taliban through coercion are counter-productive, calling on Western states and donors to return frozen funds. China&#x27;s representative said the fact that aid deliveries have not improved since the adoption of UNSC 2615 (2021) proves that the issue has been politicized, as some parties seek to use assistance as a bargaining chip.

Iran, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, the Russian Federation, and China were the first countries to accept the diplomatic credentials of Taliban-appointed envoys, although this is not equivalent to official recognition.

On 4 July 2024, the Russian president Vladimir Putin stated that Taliban is an ally of Russia in the fight against terrorism.

In November 2024, Afghanistan&#x27;s Foreign Ministry announced that Taliban officials would attend the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29), marking the country&#x27;s first participation since the Taliban regained control in 2021. Afghanistan had been unable to attend previous climate summits due to the lack of international recognition of the Taliban government. Despite this, the Taliban&#x27;s environmental officials emphasized that climate change should be viewed as a humanitarian issue rather than a political one, arguing that addressing it transcends political disputes.

After the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, the Taliban congratulated the Syrian opposition and &quot;the people of Syria&quot;, hoping for &quot;a peaceful, unified and stable system&quot;.

=== Designation as a terrorist organization ===

=== United Nations and NGOs ===
Despite the aid of United Nations (UN) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) given (see § Afghanistan during Taliban rule), the Taliban&#x27;s attitude in 1996–2001 toward the UN and NGOs was often one of suspicion. The UN did not recognise the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, most foreign donors and aid workers were non-Muslims, and the Taliban vented fundamental objections to the sort of &#x27;help&#x27; the UN offered. As the Taliban&#x27;s Attorney General Maulvi Jalil-ullah Maulvizada put it in 1997:

In July 1998, the Taliban closed &quot;all NGO offices&quot; by force after those organisations refused to move to a bombed-out former Polytechnic College as ordered. One month later the UN offices were also shut down.

Around 2000, the UN drew up sanctions against officials and leaders of Taliban, because of their harbouring Osama bin Laden. Several of the Taliban leaders have subsequently been killed.

In 2009, British Foreign Secretary Ed Miliband and US Secretary Hillary Clinton called for talks with &#x27;regular Taliban fighters&#x27; while bypassing their top leaders who supposedly were &#x27;committed to global jihad&#x27;. Kai Eide, the top UN official in Afghanistan, called for talks with Taliban at the highest level, suggesting Mullah Omareven though Omar dismissed such overtures as long as foreign troops were in Afghanistan.

In 2010, the UN lifted sanctions on the Taliban, and requested that Taliban leaders and others be removed from terrorism watch lists. In 2010 the US and Europe announced support for President Karzai&#x27;s latest attempt to negotiate peace with the Taliban.

==In popular media==
The Taliban were portrayed in Khaled Hosseini&#x27;s popular 2003 novel &quot;The Kite Runner&quot; and its 2007 film adaption. The Taliban have also been portrayed in American film, most notably in &quot;Lone Survivor&quot; (2013) which is based on a real-life story. Hindi cinema have also portrayed the Taliban in &quot;Kabul Express&quot; (2006), and &quot;Escape from Taliban&quot; (2003) which is based on a real-life novel &quot;A Kabuliwala&#x27;s Bengali Wife&quot;, whose author Sushmita Banerjee was shot dead by the Taliban in 2013.

<text>Terrorism, in its broadest sense, is the use of violence against non-combatants to achieve political or ideological aims. The term is used in this regard primarily to refer to intentional violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants. There are various different definitions of terrorism, with no universal agreement about it. Different definitions of terrorism emphasize its randomness, its aim to instill fear, and its broader impact beyond its immediate victims.

Modern terrorism, evolving from earlier iterations, employs various tactics to pursue political goals, often leveraging fear as a strategic tool to influence decision makers. By targeting densely populated public areas such as transportation hubs, airports, shopping centers, tourist attractions, and nightlife venues, terrorists aim to instill widespread insecurity, prompting policy changes through psychological manipulation and undermining confidence in security measures.

The terms &quot;terrorist&quot; and &quot;terrorism&quot; originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but became widely used internationally and gained worldwide attention in the 1970s during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Basque conflict and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001. The Global Terrorism Database, maintained by the University of Maryland, College Park, has recorded more than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths between 2000 and 2014.

Various organizations have used terrorism to achieve their objectives. These include left-wing and right-wing political organizations, nationalist groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. In recent decades, hybrid terrorist organizations have emerged, incorporating both military and political arms.

==Etymology and definition==

=== Etymology ===

The term &quot;terrorism&quot; itself was originally used to describe the actions of the Jacobin Club during the &quot;Reign of Terror&quot; in the French Revolution. &quot;Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible&quot;, said Jacobin leader Maximilien Robespierre. In 1795, Edmund Burke denounced the Jacobins for letting &quot;thousands of those hell-hounds called Terrorists ... loose on the people&quot; of France. John Calvin&#x27;s rule over Geneva in the 16th century has also been described as a reign of terror.

The terms &quot;terrorism&quot; and &quot;terrorist&quot; gained renewed currency in the 1970s as a result of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Basque separatist group, ETA, and the operations of groups such as the Red Army Faction. Leila Khaled was described as a terrorist in a 1970 issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine. A number of books on terrorism were published in the 1970s. The topic came further to the fore after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and again after the 2001 September 11 attacks and the 2002 Bali bombings.

=== Definition ===
No definition of terrorism has gained universal agreement. Challenges emerge due to the politically and emotionally charged nature of the term, the double standards used in applying it, and disagreement over the nature of terrorist acts and limits of the right to self-determination. Harvard law professor Richard Baxter, a leading expert on the law of war, was a skeptic: &quot;We have cause to regret that a legal concept of &#x27;terrorism&#x27; was ever inflicted upon us. The term is imprecise; it is ambiguous; and above all, it serves no operative legal purpose.&quot;

Different legal systems and government agencies employ diverse definitions of terrorism, with governments showing hesitation in establishing a universally accepted, legally binding definition. Title 18 of the United States Code defines terrorism as acts that are intended to intimidate or coerce civilians or government. The international community has been slow to formulate a universally agreed, legally binding definition of this crime, and has been unable to conclude a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that incorporates a single, all-encompassing, legally binding, criminal law definition of terrorism. These difficulties arise from the fact that the term &quot;terrorism&quot; is politically and emotionally charged. The international community has instead adopted a series of sectoral conventions that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities.

Counterterrorism analyst Bruce Hoffman has noted that it is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism; experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus. In 1992, terrorism studies scholar Alex P. Schmid proposed a simple definition to the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) as &quot;peacetime equivalents of war crimes&quot;, but it was not accepted. In 2006, it was estimated that there were over 109 different definitions of terrorism.

== History ==
=== Pre-modern terrorism ===
Early published studies like Paul Wilkinson considered terrorism a product of 19th-century revolutionary politics. Technological developments like the pistol and dynamite made possible the relentless onslaught of successful attacks and assassinations that shook the 19th-century. For the most part, scholars considered terrorism a modern phenomenon until David C. Rapoport published his seminal article &quot;Fear and Trembling: Terrorism in Three Religious Traditions&quot; in 1984. 

Rapoport proposed three case studies to demonstrate &quot;ancient lineage&quot; of religious terrorism, which he called &quot;sacred terror&quot;: the &quot;Thugs&quot;, the Assassins and the Jewish Sicarii Zealots. Rapoport argued religious terrorism has been ongoing since ancient times and that &quot;there are signs that it is reviving in new and unusual forms&quot;. He is the first to propose that religious doctrines were more important than political rationales for some terrorist groups. Rapoport&#x27;s work has since become the basis of the model of &quot;New Terrorism&quot; proposed by Bruce Hoffman and developed by other scholars. &quot;New Terrorism&quot; has had an unparalleled impact on policymaking. Critics have pointed out that the model is politically charged and over-simplified. The underlying historical assertions have received less critical attention. According to &quot;The Oxford Handbook on the History of Terrorism&quot;:

Since the publication of Rapoport&#x27;s article, it has become seemingly pre-requisite for standard works on terrorism to cite the three case studies and to reproduce uncritically its findings. In lieu of empirical research, authors tend to crudely paraphrase Rapoport and the assumed relevance of &quot;Thuggee&quot; to the study of modern terrorism is taken for granted. Yet the significance of the article is not simply a matter of citations―it has also provided the foundation for what has become known as the &quot;New Terrorism&quot; paradigm. While Rapoport did not suggest which late 20th century groups might exemplify the implied recurrence of &quot;holy terror&quot;, Bruce Hoffman, recognized today as one of the world&#x27;s leading terrorism experts, did not hesitate to do so. A decade after Rapoport&#x27;s article. Hoffman picked up the mantle and taking the three case studies as inspiration, he formulated a model of contemporary &quot;holy terror&quot; or, as he defined it, &quot;terrorism motivated by a religious imperative&quot;. Completely distinct from &quot;secular terrorists&quot;, Hoffman argued that &quot;religious terrorists&quot; carry out indiscriminate acts of violence as a divine duty with no consideration for political efficacy―their aim is transcendental and &quot;holy terror&quot; constitutes an end in itself. Hoffman&#x27;s concept has since been taken up and developed by a number of other writers, including Walter Laquer, Steven Simon and Daniel Benjamen, and rebranded as the &quot;New Terrorism&quot;.

=== Modern era (1850-present) ===

Arguably, the first organization to use modern terrorist techniques was the Irish Republican Brotherhood, founded in 1858 as a revolutionary Irish nationalist group that carried out attacks in England. The group initiated the Fenian dynamite campaign in 1881, one of the first modern terror campaigns. Instead of earlier forms of terrorism based on political assassination, this campaign used timed explosives with the express aim of sowing fear in the very heart of metropolitan Britain, in order to achieve political gains.

Another early terrorist-type group was Narodnaya Volya, founded in Russia in 1878 as a revolutionary anarchist group inspired by Sergei Nechayev and &quot;propaganda by the deed&quot; theorist Carlo Pisacane. The group developed ideas—such as targeted killing of the &#x27;leaders of oppression&#x27;, which were to become the hallmark of subsequent violence by small non-state groups, and they were convinced that the developing technologies of the age—such as the invention of dynamite, which they were the first anarchist group to make widespread use of—enabled them to strike directly and with discrimination. In 1920 Leon Trotsky wrote &quot;Terrorism and Communism&quot; to justify the Red Terror and defend the moral superiority of revolutionary terrorism.

The assassination of the Empress of Austria Elisabeth in 1898 resulted in the International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists, the first international conference against terrorism.

According to Bruce Hoffman of the RAND Corporation, in 1980, 2 out of 64 terrorist groups were categorized as having religious motivation while in 1995, almost half (26 out of 56) were religiously motivated with the majority having Islam as their guiding force.

== Types of terrorism ==

Depending on the country, the political system, and the time in history, the types of terrorism are varying.


In early 1975, the Law Enforcement Assistant Administration in the United States formed the National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals. One of the five volumes that the committee wrote was titled &quot;Disorders and Terrorism&quot;, produced by the Task Force on Disorders and Terrorism under the direction of H. H. A. Cooper, Director of the Task Force staff.

The Task Force defines terrorism as &quot;a tactic or technique by means of which a violent act or the threat thereof is used for the prime purpose of creating overwhelming fear for coercive purposes&quot;. It classified disorders and terrorism into seven categories:
* Civil disorder – A form of collective violence interfering with the peace, security, and normal functioning of the community.
* Political terrorism – Violent criminal behaviour designed primarily to generate fear in the community, or substantial segment of it, for political purposes.
* Non-Political terrorism – Terrorism that is not aimed at political purposes, but which exhibits &quot;conscious design to create and maintain a high degree of fear for coercive purposes, but the end is individual or collective gain rather than the achievement of a political objective&quot;.
* Anonymous terrorism – In the two decades prior to 2016–19, &quot;fewer than half&quot; of all terrorist attacks were either &quot;claimed by their perpetrators or convincingly attributed by governments to specific terrorist groups&quot;. A number of theories have been advanced as to why this has happened.
* Quasi-terrorism – The activities incidental to the commission of crimes of violence that are similar in form and method to genuine terrorism, but which nevertheless lack its essential ingredient. It is not the main purpose of the quasi-terrorists to induce terror in the immediate victim as in the case of genuine terrorism, but the quasi-terrorist uses the modalities and techniques of the genuine terrorist and produces similar consequences and reaction. For example, the fleeing felon who takes hostages is a quasi-terrorist, whose methods are similar to those of the genuine terrorist but whose purposes are quite different.
* Limited political terrorism – Genuine political terrorism is characterized by a revolutionary approach; limited political terrorism refers to &quot;acts of terrorism which are committed for ideological or political motives but which are not part of a concerted campaign to capture control of the state&quot;.
* Official or state terrorism – &quot;referring to nations whose rule is based upon fear and oppression that reach similar to terrorism or such proportions&quot;. It may be referred to as Structural Terrorism defined broadly as terrorist acts carried out by governments in pursuit of political objectives, often as part of their foreign policy.
Other sources have defined the typology of terrorism in different ways, for example, broadly classifying it into domestic terrorism and international terrorism, or using categories such as vigilante terrorism or insurgent terrorism. Some ways the typology of terrorism may be defined are:
* Political terrorism
**Sub-state terrorism
***Social revolutionary terrorism
***Nationalist-separatist terrorism
***Religious extremist terrorism
**** Religious fundamentalist Terrorism
**** New religions terrorism
*** Right-wing terrorism
*** Left-wing terrorism
**** Communist terrorism
** State-sponsored terrorism
** State terrorism
* Criminal terrorism
* Pathological terrorism

=== Religious terrorism ===

According to the Global Terrorism Index by the University of Maryland, College Park, religious extremism has overtaken national separatism and become the main driver of terrorist attacks around the world. Since 9/11 there has been a five-fold increase in deaths from terrorist attacks. The majority of incidents over the past several years can be tied to groups with a religious agenda. Before 2000, it was nationalist separatist terrorist organizations such as the IRA and Chechen rebels who were behind the most attacks. The number of incidents from nationalist separatist groups has remained relatively stable in the years since while religious extremism has grown. The prevalence of Islamist groups in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria is the main driver behind these trends.

The emergence of Hezbollah in 1982 marked a pivotal moment in terrorism&#x27;s history. The Shiite Islamist group, rooted in Lebanon, drew inspiration from the Iranian Revolution and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini&#x27;s teachings, responding to the 1982 Lebanon War. Beyond pursuing revolutionary goals, Hezbollah members were deeply concerned about the social conditions of Shiite communities across the Middle East. Their activities in Lebanon during the 1980s garnered support among local Shiites, leading to the rise of smaller terrorist groups, notably the Islamic Jihad.

Hamas, the main Islamist movement in the Palestinian territories, was formed by Palestinian imam Ahmed Yassin in 1987. Some scholars, including constitutional law professor Alexander Tsesis, have voiced concerns over the Hamas Charter&#x27;s apparent advocacy of genocidal aspirations. In the periods of 1994–1996 and 2001–2007, Hamas orchestrated a series of suicide bombings, primarily directed at civilian targets in Israel, killing over 1,000 Israeli civilians.

Five of the terrorist groups that have been most active since 2001 are Hamas, Boko Haram, al-Qaeda, the Taliban and ISIL. These groups have been most active in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. Eighty percent of all deaths from terrorism occurred in these five countries. In 2015 four Islamic extremist groups were responsible for 74% of all deaths from Islamic terrorism: ISIS, Boko Haram, the Taliban, and al-Qaeda, according to the Global Terrorism Index 2016. Since approximately 2000, these incidents have occurred on a global scale, affecting not only Muslim-majority states in Africa and Asia, but also states with non-Muslim majority such as United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Russia, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, Israel, China, India and Philippines. Such attacks have targeted both Muslims and non-Muslims, however the majority affect Muslims themselves.
Terrorism in Pakistan has become a great problem. From the summer of 2007 until late 2009, more than 1,500 people were killed in suicide and other attacks on civilians for reasons attributed to a number of causes—sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims; easy availability of guns and explosives; the existence of a &quot;Kalashnikov culture&quot;; an influx of ideologically driven Muslims based in or near Pakistan, who originated from various nations around the world and the subsequent war against the pro-Soviet Afghans in the 1980s which blew back into Pakistan; the presence of Islamist insurgent groups and forces such as the Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba. On July 2, 2013, in Lahore, 50 Muslim scholars of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) issued a collective fatwa against suicide bombings, the killing of innocent people, bomb attacks, and targeted killings declaring them as Haraam or forbidden.

In 2015, the Southern Poverty Law Center released a report on domestic terrorism in the United States. The report (titled &quot;The Age of the Wolf&quot;) analyzed 62 incidents and found that, between 2009 and 2015, &quot;more people have been killed in America by non-Islamic domestic terrorists than jihadists.&quot; The &quot;virulent racist and antisemitic&quot; ideology of the ultra-right wing Christian Identity movement is usually accompanied by anti-government sentiments. Adherents of Christian Identity are not connected with specific Christian denominations, and they believe that whites of European descent can be traced back to the &quot;Lost Tribes of Israel&quot;. Adherents have committed hate crimes, bombings and other acts of terrorism, including the Centennial Olympic Park bombing. Its influence ranges from the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups to the anti-government militia and sovereign citizen movements.

== Causes and motivations ==

Terrorist acts frequently have a political purpose based on self-determination claims, ethnonationalist frustrations, single issue causes (like abortion or the environment), or other ideological or religious causes that terrorists claim are a moral justification for their violent acts.

===Choice of terrorism as a tactic===
Individuals and groups choose terrorism as a tactic because it can:
* Act as a form of asymmetric warfare in order to directly force a government to agree to demands
* Intimidate a group of people into capitulating to the demands in order to avoid future injury
* Get attention and thus political support for a cause
* Directly inspire more people to the cause (such as revolutionary acts) – propaganda of the deed
* Indirectly inspire more people to the cause by provoking a hostile response or over-reaction from enemies to the cause

Attacks on &quot;collaborators&quot; are used to intimidate people from cooperating with the state in order to undermine state control. This strategy was used in Ireland, in Kenya, in Algeria and in Cyprus during their independence struggles.

Stated motives for the September 11 attacks included inspiring more fighters to join the cause of repelling the United States from Muslim countries with a successful high-profile attack. The attacks prompted some criticism from domestic and international observers regarding perceived injustices in U.S. foreign policy that provoked the attacks, but the larger practical effect was that the United States government declared a War on Terror that resulted in substantial military engagements in several Muslim-majority countries. Various commentators have inferred that al-Qaeda expected a military response and welcomed it as a provocation that would result in more Muslims fight the United States. Some commentators believe that the resulting anger and suspicion directed toward innocent Muslims living in Western countries and the indignities inflicted upon them by security forces and the general public also contributes to radicalization of new recruits. Despite criticism that the Iraqi government had no involvement with the September 11 attacks, Bush declared the 2003 invasion of Iraq to be part of the War on Terror. The resulting backlash and instability enabled the rise of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the temporary creation of an Islamic caliphate holding territory in Iraq and Syria, until ISIL lost its territory through military defeats.

Attacks used to draw international attention to struggles that are otherwise unreported have included the Palestinian airplane hijackings in 1970 and the 1975 Dutch train hostage crisis.

===Causes motivating terrorism===
Specific political or social causes have included:
* Independence or separatist movements
* Irredentist movements
* Adoption of a particular political philosophy, such as socialism (left-wing terrorism), anarchism, or fascism (possibly through a coup or as an ideology of an independence or separatist movement)
* Environmental protection (eco-terrorism)
* Supremacism of a particular group
** Preventing a rival group from sharing or occupying a particular territory (such as by discouraging immigration or encouraging flight)
** Subjugation of a particular population (such as lynching of African Americans)
* Spread or dominance of a particular religion – religious terrorism
* Ending perceived government oppression
* Responding to a violent act (for example, tit-for-tat attacks in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, in The Troubles in Northern Ireland, or Timothy McVeigh&#x27;s revenge for the Waco siege and Ruby Ridge incident)

Causes for right-wing terrorism have included white nationalism, ethnonationalism, fascism, anti-socialism, the anti-abortion movement, and tax resistance.

Sometimes terrorists on the same side fight for different reasons. For example, in the Chechen–Russian conflict secular Chechens using terrorist tactics fighting for national independence are allied with radical Islamist terrorists who have arrived from other countries.

===Personal and social factors===

Various personal and social factors may influence the personal choice of whether to join a terrorist group or attempt an act of terror, including:
* Identity, including affiliation with a particular culture, ethnicity, or religion
* Previous exposure to violence
* Financial reward (for example, the Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund)
* Mental illness
* Social isolation
* Perception that the cause responds to a profound injustice or indignity

A report conducted by Paul Gill, John Horgan and Paige Deckert found that for &quot;lone wolf&quot; terrorists:
* 43% were motivated by religious beliefs
* 32% had pre-existing mental health disorders, while many more are found to have mental health problems upon arrest
* At least 37% lived alone at the time of their event planning or execution, a further 26% lived with others, and no data were available for the remaining cases
* 40% were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event
* 19% subjectively experienced being disrespected by others
* 14% percent experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assault

Ariel Merari, a psychologist who has studied the psychological profiles of suicide terrorists since 1983 through media reports that contained biographical details, interviews with the suicides&#x27; families, and interviews with jailed would-be suicide attackers, concluded that they were unlikely to be psychologically abnormal. In comparison to economic theories of criminal behaviour, Scott Atran found that suicide terrorists exhibit none of the socially dysfunctional attributes—such as fatherless, friendless, jobless situations—or suicidal symptoms. By which he means, they do not kill themselves simply out of hopelessness or a sense of &#x27;having nothing to lose&#x27;.

Abrahm suggests that terrorist organizations do not select terrorism for its political effectiveness. Individual terrorists tend to be motivated more by a desire for social solidarity with other members of their organization than by political platforms or strategic objectives, which are often murky and undefined.

Michael Mousseau shows possible relationships between the type of economy within a country and ideology associated with terrorism. Many terrorists have a history of domestic violence.

== Democracy and domestic terrorism ==
Terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate political freedom, and it is least common in the most democratic nations.

Some examples of terrorism in non-democratic nations include ETA in Spain under Francisco Franco (although the group&#x27;s activities increased sharply after Franco&#x27;s death), the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in pre-war Poland, the Shining Path in Peru under Alberto Fujimori, the Kurdistan Workers Party when Turkey was ruled by military leaders and the ANC in South Africa.

According to Boaz Ganor, &quot;Modern terrorism sees the liberal democratic state, in all its variations, as the perfect launching pad and a target for its attacks. Moreover, some terrorist organizations—particularly Islamist-jihadist organizations—have chosen to cynically exploit democratic values and institutions to gain power and status, promote their interests, and achieve internal and international legitimacy&quot;. Jihadist militants have shown an ambivalent view towards democracy, as they both exploit it for their ends and oppose it in their ideology. Various quotes from jihadist leaders note their disdain for democracy and their efforts to undermine it in favor of Islamic rule. Democracies, such as Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Israel, Indonesia, India, Spain, Germany, Italy and the Philippines, have all experienced domestic terrorism.

While a democratic nation espousing civil liberties may claim a sense of higher moral ground than other regimes, an act of terrorism within such a state may cause a dilemma: whether to maintain its civil liberties and thus risk being perceived as ineffective in dealing with the problem; or alternatively to restrict its civil liberties and thus risk delegitimizing its claim of supporting civil liberties. For this reason, homegrown terrorism has started to be seen as a greater threat, as stated by former CIA Director Michael Hayden. This dilemma, some social theorists would conclude, may very well play into the initial plans of the acting terrorist(s); namely, to delegitimize the state and cause a systematic shift towards anarchy via the accumulation of negative sentiments towards the state system.

== Perpetrators ==

The perpetrators of acts of terrorism can be individuals, groups, or states. According to some definitions, clandestine or semi-clandestine state actors may carry out terrorist acts outside the framework of a state of war. The most common image of terrorism is that it is carried out by small and secretive cells, highly motivated to serve a particular cause and many of the most deadly operations in recent times, such as the September 11 attacks, the London underground bombing, 2008 Mumbai attacks and the 2002 Bali bombings were planned and carried out by a close clique, composed of close friends, family members and other strong social networks. These groups benefited from the free flow of information and efficient telecommunications to succeed where others had failed.

Over the years, much research has been conducted to distill a terrorist profile to explain these individuals&#x27; actions through their psychology and socio-economic circumstances. Some specialists highlight the lack of evidence supporting the idea that terrorists are typically psychologically disturbed. The careful planning and detailed execution seen in many terrorist acts are not characteristics generally associated with mentally unstable individuals. Others, like Roderick Hindery, have sought to discern profiles in the propaganda tactics used by terrorists. Some security organizations designate these groups as &quot;violent non-state actors&quot;. A 2007 study by economist Alan B. Krueger found that terrorists were less likely to come from an impoverished background (28 percent versus 33 percent) and more likely to have at least a high-school education (47 percent versus 38 percent). Another analysis found only 16 percent of terrorists came from impoverished families, versus 30 percent of male Palestinians, and over 60 percent had gone beyond high school, versus 15 percent of the populace.

To avoid detection, a terrorist will look, dress, and behave normally until executing the assigned mission. Some claim that attempts to profile terrorists based on personality, physical, or sociological traits are not useful. The physical and behavioral description of the terrorist could describe almost any normal person. The majority of terrorist attacks are carried out by military age men, aged 16 to 40.

=== Non-state groups ===

Groups not part of the state apparatus of in opposition to the state are most commonly referred to as a &quot;terrorist&quot; in the media.

According to the Global Terrorism Database, the most active terrorist group in the period 1970 to 2010 was Shining Path (with 4,517 attacks), followed by Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), Irish Republican Army (IRA), Basque Fatherland and Freedom (ETA), Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Taliban, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, New People&#x27;s Army, National Liberation Army of Colombia (ELN), and Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).

Israel has had problems with religious terrorism even before independence in 1948. During British mandate over Palestine, the secular Irgun were among the Zionist groups labelled as terrorist organisations by the British authorities and United Nations, for violent terror attacks against Britons and Arabs. Another extremist group, the Lehi, openly declared its members as &quot;terrorists&quot;. Historian William Cleveland stated many Jews justified any action, even terrorism, taken in the cause of the creation of a Jewish state. In 1995, Yigal Amir assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. For Amir, killing Rabin was an exemplary act that symbolized the fight against an illegitimate government that was prepared to cede Jewish Holy Land to the Palestinians. Members of Kach, a Jewish ultranationalist party, employed terrorist tactics in pursuit of what they viewed as religious imperatives. Israel and a few other countries have designated the party as a terrorist group.
=== Funding ===
State sponsors have constituted a major form of funding; for example, Palestine Liberation Organization, Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and other groups sometimes considered to be terrorist organizations, were funded by the Soviet Union. Iran has provided funds, training, and weapons to organizations such as Lebanese Shi’ite group Hezbollah, the Yemenite Houthi movement, and Palestinian factions such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Iranian funding for Hamas is estimated to reach several hundred million dollars annually. These groups and others have played significant roles in Iran&#x27;s foreign policy and served as proxies in conflicts. The Stern Gang received funding from Italian Fascist officers in Beirut to undermine the British authorities in Palestine.

&quot;Revolutionary tax&quot; is another major form of funding, and essentially a euphemism for &quot;protection money&quot;. Revolutionary taxes &quot;play a secondary role as one other means of intimidating the target population&quot;.

Other major sources of funding include kidnapping for ransoms, smuggling (including wildlife smuggling), fraud, and robbery. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant has reportedly received funding &quot;via private donations from the Gulf states&quot;. Irish Republican militants, primarily the Provisional Irish Republican Army and the Irish National Liberation Army, and Loyalist paramilitaries, primarily the Ulster Volunteer Force and Ulster Defence Association, received far more financing from criminal and legitimate activities within the British Isles than overseas donations, including Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and NORAID (see Paramilitary finances in the Troubles for more information).

The Financial Action Task Force is an inter-governmental body whose mandate, since October 2001, has included combating terrorist financing.

== Tactics ==
Terrorist attacks are often targeted to maximize fear and publicity, most frequently using explosives.
Terrorist groups usually methodically plan attacks in advance, and may train participants, plant undercover agents, and raise money from supporters or through organized crime. Communications occur through modern telecommunications, or through old-fashioned methods such as couriers. There is concern about terrorist attacks employing weapons of mass destruction. Some academics have argued that while it is often assumed terrorism is intended to spread fear, this is not necessarily true, with fear instead being a by-product of the terrorist&#x27;s actions, while their intentions may be to avenge fallen comrades or destroy their perceived enemies.

Terrorism is a form of asymmetric warfare and is more common when direct conventional warfare will not be effective because opposing forces vary greatly in power. Yuval Harari argues that the peacefulness of modern states makes them paradoxically more vulnerable to terrorism than pre-modern states. Harari argues that because modern states have committed themselves to reducing political violence to almost zero, terrorists can, by creating political violence, threaten the very foundations of the legitimacy of the modern state. This is in contrast to pre-modern states, where violence was a routine and recognised aspect of politics at all levels, making political violence unremarkable. Terrorism thus shocks the population of a modern state far more than a pre-modern one and consequently the state is forced to overreact in an excessive, costly and spectacular manner, which is often what the terrorists desire.

The type of people terrorists will target is dependent upon the ideology of the terrorists. A terrorist&#x27;s ideology will create a class of &quot;legitimate targets&quot; who are deemed as its enemies and who are permitted to be targeted. This ideology will also allow the terrorists to place the blame on the victim, who is viewed as being responsible for the violence in the first place.

=== Attack types ===
Stabbing attacks, a historical tactic, have reemerged as a prevalent form of terrorism in the 21st century, notably during the 2010s and 2020s. This resurgence originated with the GIA in the 1990s and later expanded among Palestinian terrorists and Islamic State militants. The trend gained momentum with a wave of &quot;lone wolf&quot; terrorist stabbing attacks by Palestinians targeting Israelis beginning in 2015. Subsequently, this pattern extended to Europe during the surge of Islamic terrorism in the 2010s, witnessing &quot;at least&quot; 10 stabbing attacks allegedly motivated by Islamic extremism by the spring of 2017, with France experiencing a notable concentration of such incidents.

=== Media spectacle ===
Terrorists may attempt to use the media to spread their message or manipulate their target audience. Shamil Basayev used this tactic during the Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis and again in the Moscow theater hostage crisis. Terrorists may also target national symbols for attention. Walter Lacquer wrote that &quot;terrorism was always, to a large extent, about public relations and propaganda (&#x27;Propaganda by Deed&#x27; had been the slogan in the nineteenth century)&quot;.

The El Al Flight 426 hijacking is considered a turning point for modern terrorism studies. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) realized they could combine the tactics of targeting national symbols and civilians (in this case as hostages) to generate a mass media spectacle. Zehdi Labib Terzi made a public statement about this in 1976: &quot;The first several hijackings aroused the consciousness of the world and awakened the media and world opinion much more ― and more effectively ― than 20 years of pleading at the United Nations&quot;.

==== Mass media ====
Mass media exposure may be a primary goal of those carrying out terrorism, to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media. Some consider this to be manipulation and exploitation of the media.

The Internet has created a new way for groups to spread their messages. This has created a cycle of measures and counter measures by groups in support of and in opposition to terrorist movements. The United Nations has created its own online counterterrorism resource.

The mass media will, on occasion, censor organizations involved in terrorism (through self-restraint or regulation) to discourage further terrorism. This may encourage organizations to perform more extreme acts of terrorism to be shown in the mass media. Conversely James F. Pastor explains the significant relationship between terrorism and the media, and the underlying benefit each receives from the other:

Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously spoke of the close connection between terrorism and the media, calling publicity &#x27;the oxygen of terrorism&#x27;.

=== Terrorism and tourism ===
The connection between terrorism and tourism has been widely studied since the 1997 Luxor massacre, during which 62 people, including 58 foreign nationals, were killed by Islamist group al-Jama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya in an archaeological site in Egypt. In the 1970s, the targets of terrorists were politicians and chiefs of police while now, international tourists and visitors are selected as the main targets of attacks. The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, were the symbolic center, which marked a new epoch in the use of civil transport against the main power of the planet. From this event onwards, the spaces of leisure that characterized the pride of West were conceived as dangerous and frightful.

== Counterterrorism strategies ==

Responses to terrorism are broad in scope. They can include re-alignments of the political spectrum and reassessments of fundamental values.

Specific types of responses include:
* Targeted laws, criminal procedures, deportations, and enhanced police powers
* Target hardening, such as locking doors or adding traffic barriers
* Preemptive or reactive military action
* Increased intelligence and surveillance activities
* Preemptive humanitarian activities
* More permissive interrogation and detention policies

=== Terrorism research ===

Terrorism research, also called terrorism studies, or terrorism and counter-terrorism research, is an academic field which seeks to understand the causes of terrorism, how to prevent it, as well as its impact in the broadest sense. Terrorism research can be carried out in both military and civilian contexts, for example by research centres such as the British Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence, the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, and the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism (ICCT). There are several academic journals devoted to the field, including &quot;Perspectives on Terrorism&quot;.

=== International agreements ===
One of the agreements that promote the international legal counterterrorist framework is the Code of Conduct Towards Achieving a World Free of Terrorism that was adopted at the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2018. The Code of Conduct was initiated by Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Its main goal is to implement a wide range of international commitments to counterterrorism and establish a broad global coalition towards achieving a world free of terrorism by 2045. The Code was signed by more than 70 countries.

=== Response in the United States ===

According to a report by Dana Priest and William M. Arkin in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States.&quot;

America&#x27;s thinking on how to defeat radical Islamists is split along two very different schools of thought. Republicans, typically follow what is known as the Bush Doctrine, advocate the military model of taking the fight to the enemy and seeking to democratize the Middle East. Democrats, by contrast, generally propose the law enforcement model of better cooperation with nations and more security at home. In the introduction of the &quot;U.S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual&quot;, Sarah Sewall states the need for &quot;U.S. forces to make securing the civilian, rather than destroying the enemy, their top priority. The civilian population is the center of gravity—the deciding factor in the struggle... Civilian deaths create an extended family of enemies—new insurgent recruits or informants—and erode support of the host nation.&quot; Sewall sums up the book&#x27;s key points on how to win this battle: &quot;Sometimes, the more you protect your force, the less secure you may be... Sometimes, the more force is used, the less effective it is... The more successful the counterinsurgency is, the less force can be used and the more risk must be accepted... Sometimes, doing nothing is the best reaction.&quot; This strategy, often termed &quot;courageous restraint&quot;, has certainly led to some success on the Middle East battlefield. However, it does not address the fact that terrorists are mostly homegrown.

=== Ending terrorist groups ===
Jones and Libicki (2008) created a list of all the terrorist groups they could find that were active between 1968 and 2006. They found 648. Of those, 136 splintered and 244 were still active in 2006. Of the ones that ended, 43% converted to nonviolent political actions, like the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland; 40% were defeated by law enforcement; 7% (20 groups) were defeated by military force; and 10% succeeded.

42 groups became large enough to be labeled an insurgency; 38 of those had ended by 2006. Of those, 47% converted to nonviolent political actors. Only 5% were ended by law enforcement, and 21% were defeated by military force. 26% won. Jones and Libicki concluded that military force may be necessary to deal with large insurgencies but are only occasionally decisive, because the military is too often seen as a bigger threat to civilians than the terrorists. To avoid that, the rules of engagement must be conscious of collateral damage and work to minimize it.

Another researcher, Audrey Cronin, lists six primary ways that terrorist groups end:
# Capture or killing of a group&#x27;s leader (Decapitation)
# Entry of the group into a legitimate political process (Negotiation)
# Achievement of group aims (Success)
# Group implosion or loss of public support (Failure)
# Defeat and elimination through brute force (Repression)
# Transition from terrorism into other forms of violence (Reorientation)

== State and state sponsored-terrorism ==

=== State terrorism ===


As with &quot;terrorism&quot; the concept of &quot;state terrorism&quot; is controversial. The Chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee has stated that the committee was conscious of 12 international conventions on the subject, and none of them referred to state terrorism, which was not an international legal concept. If states abused their power, they should be judged against international conventions dealing with war crimes, international human rights law, and international humanitarian law. Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that it is &quot;time to set aside debates on so-called &#x27;state terrorism&#x27;. The use of force by states is already thoroughly regulated under international law&quot;. He made clear that, &quot;regardless of the differences between governments on the question of the definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on is that any deliberate attack on innocent civilians [or non-combatants], regardless of one&#x27;s cause, is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism.&quot;
State terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts committed by governmental agents or forces. This involves the use of state resources employed by a state&#x27;s foreign policies, such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism. Professor of Political Science Michael Stohl cites the examples that include the German bombing of London, the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the Allied firebombing of Dresden, and the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. He argues that &quot;the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents.&quot; He cites the first strike option as an example of the &quot;terror of coercive diplomacy&quot; as a form of this, which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using nuclear weapons in &quot;crisis management&quot; and he argues that the institutionalized form of terrorism has occurred as a result of changes that took place following World War II. In this analysis, state terrorism exhibited as a form of foreign policy was shaped by the presence and use of weapons of mass destruction, and the legitimizing of such violent behavior led to an increasingly accepted form of this behavior by the state.

Charles Stewart Parnell described William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s Irish Coercion Act as terrorism in his &quot;no-Rent manifesto&quot; in 1881, during the Irish Land War. The concept is used to describe political repressions by governments against their own civilian populations with the purpose of inciting fear. For example, taking and executing civilian hostages or extrajudicial elimination campaigns are commonly considered &quot;terror&quot; or terrorism, for example during the Red Terror or the Great Terror. Such actions are often described as democide or genocide, which have been argued to be equivalent to state terrorism. Empirical studies on this have found that democracies have little democide. Western democracies, including the United States, have supported state terrorism and mass killings, with some examples being the Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66 and Operation Condor.

=== State-sponsored terrorism ===
A state can sponsor terrorism by funding or harboring a terrorist group. Opinions as to which acts of violence by states consist of state-sponsored terrorism vary widely. When states provide funding for groups considered by some to be terrorist, they rarely acknowledge them as such.

== Impact and debate ==
Terrorism is a charged term. It is often used with the connotation of something that is morally wrong. Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups. While legislation defining terrorism as a crime has been adopted in many states, the distinction between activism and terrorism remains a complex and debated matter. There is no consensus as to whether terrorism should be regarded as a war crime. State terrorism is that perpetrated by nation states, but is not considered such by the state conducting it, making legality a grey area. Countries sometimes opt to ignore terrorist activities committed by allies.

The use of the term in the Israel–Palestine conflict has given rise to controversies concerning the vagueness of how terrorists are defined and identified. 

Media outlets who wish to convey impartiality may limit their usage of &quot;terrorist&quot; and &quot;terrorism&quot; because they are loosely defined, potentially controversial in nature, and subjective terms.

=== Pejorative use ===
The term &quot;terrorism&quot; is often used to abuse or denounce opposite parties, either governments or non-state groups. An example of this is the &quot;terruqueo&quot; political attack used by right-wing groups in Peru to target leftist groups or those opposed to the neoliberal &quot;status quo&quot;, likening opponents to guerrilla organizations from the internal conflict in Peru.

Those labeled &quot;terrorists&quot; by their opponents rarely identify themselves as such, but it was not always so. While a multitude of terms like separatist, freedom fighter, liberator, revolutionary, vigilante, militant, paramilitary, guerrilla, rebel, patriot, have come into use, (including some culturally specific terms borrowed from other languages like Jihadi, mujahideen, and fedayeen), the unwillingness to self-identify as terrorists began when parties in a conflict started to describe each other as terrorists pejoratively. As an example, when Vera Zasulich attacked a Russian official known for abusing prisoners she told the court &quot;I am not a criminal, I am a terrorist!&quot;. The stunned court acquitted Zazulich when they realized that she was trying to become a martyr. She was carried out of the courtroom on the shoulders of the crowd.

Some groups and individuals have openly admitted to using &quot;terrorist tactics&quot; even while maintaining distance from the pejorative term in their self-descriptions. The Zionist militant group Lohamei Herut Yisrael admitted that they used terrorist tactics but used the euphemism &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; to describe themselves (&quot;Lohamei Herut Yisrael&quot; means &quot;Freedom Fighters for Israel&quot;.)

In his book &quot;Inside Terrorism&quot; Bruce Hoffman offered an explanation of why the term &quot;terrorism&quot; becomes distorted:

The pejorative connotations of the word can be summed up in the aphorism, &quot;One man&#x27;s terrorist is another man&#x27;s freedom fighter&quot;. This is exemplified when a group using irregular military methods is an ally of a state against a mutual enemy, but later falls out with the state and starts to use those methods against its former ally.

Groups accused of terrorism understandably prefer terms reflecting legitimate military or ideological action. Leading terrorism researcher Professor Martin Rudner, director of the Canadian Centre of Intelligence and Security Studies at Ottawa&#x27;s Carleton University, defines &quot;terrorist acts&quot; as unlawful attacks for political or other ideological goals, and said: 

Labelling opponents as &quot;terrorists&quot; has been used as a tactic to evade the usual laws of war against things such as assassinations and other extrajudicial killing, particularly by Israel and the United States. Some international legal opinions suggest that terrorist activities by their very nature &quot;deny&quot; the civilian nature of an ostensibly civilian participant. 
Some groups, when involved in a &quot;liberation&quot; struggle, have been called &quot;terrorists&quot; by the Western governments or media. Later, these same persons, as leaders of the liberated nations, are called &quot;statesmen&quot; by similar organizations. Two examples of this phenomenon are the Nobel Peace Prize laureates Menachem Begin and Nelson Mandela. WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange has been called a &quot;terrorist&quot; by Sarah Palin and Joe Biden. 

Inversely, some groups like the Afghan Mujahideen that were labelled as &quot;freedom fighters&quot; later became &quot;terrorists&quot; as alliances shifted. During the Second World War, the Malayan People&#x27;s Anti-Japanese Army were allied with the British, but during the Malayan Emergency, members of its successor organisation (the Malayan National Liberation Army) started campaigns against them, and were branded &quot;terrorists&quot; as a result.

<doc id="30638" wikidata="Q309907" url="?curid=30638" title="Thomas Malory">
<text>Sir Thomas Malory was an English writer, the author of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, the classic English-language chronicle of the Arthurian legend, compiled and in most cases translated from French sources. The most popular version of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; was published by the famed London printer William Caxton in 1485. Much of Malory&#x27;s life history is obscure, but he identified himself as a &quot;knight prisoner&quot;, apparently reflecting that he was either a criminal, a prisoner-of-war, or suffering some other type of confinement. Malory&#x27;s identity has never been confirmed. Since modern scholars began researching his identity the most widely accepted candidate has been Sir Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel in Warwickshire, who was imprisoned at various times for criminal acts and possibly also for political reasons during the Wars of the Roses. Recent work by Cecelia Lampp Linton, however, presents new evidence in support of Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers, Yorkshire.

==Identity==
Most of what is known about Malory stems from the accounts describing him in the prayers found in the Winchester Manuscript of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. He is described as a &quot;&quot;, distinguishing him from several other candidates also bearing the name Thomas Malory in the 15th century when &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; was written.

At the end of the &quot;Tale of King Arthur&quot; (Books I–IV in the printing by William Caxton) is written: &quot;For this was written by a knight prisoner Thomas Malleorre, that God send him good recovery.&quot; At the end of &quot;The Tale of Sir Gareth&quot; (Caxton&#x27;s Book VII): &quot;And I pray you all that readeth this tale to pray for him that this wrote, that God send him good deliverance soon and hastily.&quot; At the conclusion of the &quot;Tale of Sir Tristram&quot; (Caxton&#x27;s VIII–XII): &quot;Here endeth the second book of Sir Tristram de Lyones, which was drawn out of the French by Sir Thomas Malleorre, knight, as Jesu be his help.&quot; Finally, at the conclusion of the whole book: &quot;The Most Piteous Tale of the Morte Arthure Sanz Gwerdon par le shyvalere Sir Thomas Malleorre, knight, Jesu aide ly pur votre bon mercy.&quot;, a mix of English and French roughly meaning: &quot;The most pitiable tale of the Death of [King] Arthur, without reward for/by the knight Sir Thomas Malory; Jesus aid him by your good mercy.&quot;

However, all these are replaced by Caxton with a final colophon reading: &quot;I pray you all gentlemen and gentlewomen that readeth this book of Arthur and his knights, from the beginning to the ending, pray for me while I am alive, that God send me good deliverance and when I am dead, I pray you all pray for my soul. For this book was ended the ninth year of the reign of King Edward the Fourth by Sir Thomas Maleore, knight, as Jesu help him for his great might, as he is the servant of Jesu both day and night.&quot;

With the exception of the first sentence of the final colophon, all the above references to Thomas Malory as a knight are, grammatically speaking, in the third person singular, which leaves open the possibility that they were added by a copyist, either in Caxton&#x27;s workshop or elsewhere. However, scholarly consensus is that these references to knighthood refer to a real person and that that person is the author of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;.

The author was educated, as most of his material &quot;was drawn out of the French,&quot; which suggests a degree of French fluency indicating that he might have been from a wealthy family. A claimant&#x27;s age must also fit the time of writing; as described below, this has been a major point of contention among all modern scholars for determining the author&#x27;s identity.

==Candidates==
Since the late 19th century there has been a great deal of scholarly research into the identity of Sir Thomas Malory, author of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. As detailed below, the earliest modern investigations suggested that Sir Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel was the only Thomas Malory living in 15th-century England who was a knight. However, the apparently great age of this candidate at the time of the work&#x27;s completion has always been a source of contention. In the early 20th century, scholarly revelations of this candidate&#x27;s extensive criminal record and multiple imprisonments threw further doubt on the matter because of a perceived discordance with the chivalric ideals espoused in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. The discovery of the Winchester Manuscript in 1934 revealed that the author was in some form of imprisonment at the time of writing; this has generally been taken to support the candidate from Newbold Revel, though the support is ambiguous because that candidate&#x27;s extensive prison record does not actually include the time of writing.

These tensions have inspired scholars to propose alternative identities; most notably, Thomas Malory of Papworth St. Agnes and Moreton Corbet and Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers and Studley Royal. Both are much less attested in the documentary record than the candidate from Newbold Revel. As described in detail below: neither is clearly recorded as having been a knight, but both come from knightly families and could plausibly have been knighted. Both seem to have been of a more appropriate age at the time of writing, but neither is known to have been imprisoned at any time.

To date, no candidate for authorship has ever consistently commanded widespread support other than Malory of Newbold Revel. However, despite the evidence for other candidates being &quot;no more than circumstantial&quot;, eminent scholars suggest that the question of the author&#x27;s identity is both critically important and yet unresolved. However, Linton argues that Malory of Hutton Conyers was a knight of the church, and as her recent work garners scholarly attention, it may bring the matter into different focus.

===Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel===
Since George Lyman Kittredge, a professor at Harvard, published the first significant investigation into Malory&#x27;s identity in 1894, the primary candidate for authorship has been Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel in Warwickshire. Kittredge discovered a record of this Malory&#x27;s service under Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick in William Dugdale&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities of Warwickshire&quot; (1656), stating of Sir Thomas:
In modern English:
Dugdale&#x27;s history also revealed that this Malory had served as a Member of Parliament, and recorded the date of his death, the location of his tomb, and many other details of his life and family. As Dugdale lived in Warwickshire and apparently had access to Malory&#x27;s home and direct descendants during a time when &quot;Le Morte&quot; remained very popular and was still being printed, scholars have noted that any mention of his authoring &quot;Le Morte&quot; is conspicuously absent in Dugdale&#x27;s record. To date, however, this candidate for authorship remains the only Thomas Malory known to be living at the time of writing who was clearly recorded as having been a knight.

Kittredge accepted the details of Dugdale&#x27;s history at face value: specifically, that he was commissioned to serve at Calais under Henry V; a campaign which took place in 1414–15. Under this view, Malory would have been a junior officer in Henry V&#x27;s famous Battle of Agincourt – a member of what William Shakespeare cemented in popular memory as the Band of Brothers in the famous St. Crispin&#x27;s Day Speech. However, subsequent scholars have questioned this interpretation, suggesting that Dugdale&#x27;s record was erroneous and that Malory instead served under Henry VI, at an action in Calais in 1436 – a brief mobilization which was disbanded without combat and which Dugdale, in their view, erroneously called a siege. P.J.C. Field suggests that the first public record of this Malory in 1439 is an indication of when he reached the date of his majority (at the age of 21).

Scholars consider the question of this timeline to be important in determining authorship, as the original timeline would place Malory&#x27;s birth in the early to mid 1390s. He would therefore have been at least 75 when &quot;Le Morte&quot; was completed, as he must have been at least in his late teens or early 20s at the time of his commission: his peers of the same rank in Dugdale&#x27;s record were in their mid- to late-twenties. According to the alternate timeline, his birth would have been around 1415-1418 and his age would have been a much more reasonable 55 to 58 years when &quot;Le Morte&quot; was completed.

William Matthews emphasizes the importance of Malory&#x27;s age thus: &quot;There is considerable evidence that the medieval view was that by sixty a man was bean fodder and forage, ready for nothing but death&#x27;s pit... it might be best to find out how old the Warwickshire knight really was in 1469.&quot; Researching the question, Matthews made an original discovery: Sir William Dugdale&#x27;s surviving 15th century notes and papers in the Bodleian Library on the Agincourt campaign contain a lengthy military roster (apparently in Dugdale&#x27;s own hand) with the following detail:

Because this original French note perfectly matches the English translation in Dugdale&#x27;s published work, and because a number of the other knights listed on the same commission roster are known to have died long before 1436, Matthews concludes that these commissions cannot refer to the 1436 campaign; and therefore Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel must have been commissioned into Henry V&#x27;s Agincourt campaign around 1414 or 1415, confirming Kittredge&#x27;s original timeline and making this Malory in his mid-70s to early 80s at the time the book was completed. Matthews asserts, &quot;seventy-five is no age at all to be writing &quot;Le Morte Darthur&quot; in prison.&quot;

Linton comes to Dugdale&#x27;s defense, disputing the need for an alternative timeline. She notes that scholars have accepted Dugdale&#x27;s account of this Malory without question, except for the matter of his age. She agrees with other scholars that Dugdale knew the Malorys of Newbold Revel and suggests that he would have certainly made the connection between this Malory and &quot;Le Morte&quot; if there were any connection to be made.

Much more detail was added to Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel&#x27;s biography by Edward Hicks in 1928, revealing that this Thomas Malory had been imprisoned as a thief, bandit, kidnapper, attempted murderer, and rapist; which hardly seemed in keeping with the high chivalric standards of his book. Helen Cooper referred to his life as one that &quot;reads more like an account of exemplary thuggery than chivalry&quot;. Shortly before his death, C. S. Lewis stated that this issue was a grave one for readers of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;.

E. K. Chambers emphasizes the importance of the problem by quoting the author himself:

In Modern English:

Chambers comments, &quot;Surely the Sir Thomas of Monks Kirby [the parish in which Malory of Newbold Revel lived] could not have written this without a twinge.&quot;

Sir Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel was born to Sir John Malory of Winwick, Northamptonshire, who had served as a Justice of the Peace in Warwickshire and as a Member of Parliament, and Lady Phillipa Malory, heiress of Newbold. He was knighted before 8 October 1441, became a professional soldier, and served under Henry de Beauchamp, 1st Duke of Warwick. While it is not recorded how he became distinguished, he acted as an elector in Northamptonshire. However, in 1443 he and accomplice Eustace Barnaby were accused of attacking, kidnapping, and stealing 40 pounds&#x27; worth of goods from Thomas Smythe, though nothing came of this charge. He married a woman named Elizabeth Walsh, with whom he had at least one son, named Robert, and possibly one or two other children. Despite the criminal charges against him, he seems to have remained in good standing with his peers because in that same year, Malory was elected by the men of Warwickshire to Parliament to serve as a knight of the shire for the rest of 1443, and was appointed to a royal commission charged with the distribution of money to impoverished towns in Warwickshire. In 1449–50, he was returned as member of Parliament for Great Bedwyn, a seat controlled by the Duke of Buckingham.

Malory&#x27;s status changed abruptly in 1451 when he was accused of ambushing Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, a prominent Lancastrian in the Wars of the Roses, along with 26 other men sometime in 1450. The accusation was never proved. Later in 1451, he was accused of extorting 100 shillings from Margaret King and William Hales of Monks Kirby, and then of committing the same crime against John Mylner for 20 shillings. He was also accused of breaking into the house of Hugh Smyth of Monks Kirby in 1450, stealing 40 pounds&#x27; worth of goods and raping Smyth&#x27;s wife, and with attacking her again in Coventry eight weeks later. At this period, a charge of rape could also apply to some acts of consensual sex and some nonsexual crimes; several scholars have suggested that the accusation did not refer to rape as it is now defined. However, Field&#x27;s analysis of the specific Latin terminology of the charges concludes that they were intended to refer to actual rapes.

On 15 March 1451, Malory and 19 others were ordered to be arrested. Nothing came of this and, in the following months, Malory and his cohorts were charged with a series of crimes, especially violent robberies. At one point, he was arrested and imprisoned in Maxstoke Castle, but he escaped, swam the moat, and returned to Newbold Revel. Nellie Slayton Aurner points out that most of these crimes seem to have been targeted at the property and followers of the Duke of Buckingham; and that as Malory was a supporter of the family of Buckingham&#x27;s former rival, the Duke of Warwick, there may have been a political motive behind either Malory&#x27;s attacks or Buckingham and others bringing charges against him. Aurner suggests that Malory&#x27;s enemies tried to slander him, giving evidence that the Duke of Buckingham was Malory&#x27;s long-time enemy.

Malory finally came to trial on 23 August 1451, in Nuneaton, a town in the heartland of Buckingham&#x27;s power and a place where Malory found little favour as a supporter of the Beauchamps. Those accused included Malory and several others; there were numerous charges. Malory was convicted and sent to the Marshalsea Prison in London, where he remained for a year. He demanded a retrial with a jury of men from his own county. Although this never took place, he was released. By March 1452, he was back in the Marshalsea, from which he escaped two months later, possibly by bribing the guards and gaolers. After a month, he was back in prison yet again, and this time he was held until the following May, when he was released on bail of 200 pounds, paid by a number of his fellow magnates from Warwickshire. Malory later ended up in custody in Colchester, accused of still more crimes, involving robbery and the stealing of horses. Once again, he escaped and once again was apprehended and returned to Marshalsea Prison.

From Malory&#x27;s first criminal charge in 1443 through his eighth charge in 1451 after several escapes from captivity, little was done to contain his actions. In 1451, a royal arrest order was issued, followed by increasing fines on the lords overseeing his imprisonment in case of his escape, culminating in a maximum fine of 2000 lbs set by the King&#x27;s Bench in June 1455. As Malory aged through several subsequent imprisonments, fines for his escape decreased to 1000 lbs and then 450 lbs in January and October 1457, and then 100 lbs if not captured when he was somehow at large again despite no formal release in 1458. Malory was released as part of a general pardon at the accession of King Edward IV in 1461.

After 1461, few records survive which scholars agree refer to Malory of Newbold Revel. In 1468–1470, King Edward IV issued four more general pardons which specifically excluded a Thomas Malory. The first of these names Malory a knight; and applied to participants in a campaign in Northumberland in the North of England by members of the Lancastrian faction. Field interprets these pardon-exclusions to refer to Malory of Newbold Revel, suggesting that Malory changed his allegiance from York to Lancaster, and that he was involved in a conspiracy with Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick to overthrow King Edward. Matthews, having shown that Malory of Newbold Revel was likely in his seventies by the time of the Northumberland campaign and living much further to the South, interprets this record as referring to a different candidate for authorship.

No record survives of Malory of Newbold Revel (or any other Thomas Malory) being in prison at the time &quot;Le Morte&quot; was completed. As Field describes, &quot;Repeated scholarly searches of legal records have found no trace of arrest, charge, trial, or verdict&quot; that would place any Thomas Malory in prison at the time documented by the author in the Winchester manuscript. Field suggests that Malory&#x27;s political rivals &quot;simply put him in prison without formal charge&quot; and that he could have been released from prison in October 1470, at the collapse of the Yorkist regime and the temporary return to the throne of Henry VI.

In 1462, Malory settled his estate on his son Robert and, in 1466 or 1467, Robert fathered a son named Nicholas, Malory&#x27;s grandson and ultimate heir. Malory died on 14 March 1471 and was buried in Christ Church Greyfriars, near Newgate Prison. His interment there suggests that his misdeeds had been forgiven and that he possessed some wealth. However, it was certified at the granting of probate that he owned little wealth of his own, having settled his estate on his son in 1462. Malory&#x27;s grandson Nicholas eventually inherited his lands and was appointed High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1502.

Dugdale, writing in the early to mid-17th century, recorded that the following inscription had been engraved on Malory&#x27;s tomb: &quot;HIC JACET DOMINUS THOMAS MALLERE, VALENS MILES OB 14 MAR 1470 DE PAROCHIA DE MONKENKIRBY IN COM WARICINI,&quot; meaning: &quot;Here lies Lord Thomas Mallere, Valiant Soldier. Died 14 March 1470 [new calendar 1471], in the parish of Monkenkirby in the county of Warwick.&quot; The tomb itself had been lost when Greyfriars was destroyed in 1538 under King Henry VIII in the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

Linton, in her defense of Dugdale&#x27;s account, notes that he never offered a connection between the Newbold Revel Malory and &quot;Le Morte,&quot; even though the book was well known in Dugdale&#x27;s time.

===Thomas Malory of Papworth St. Agnes===
Shortly after Kittredge&#x27;s original article on Malory of Newbold Revel, a second candidate was presented in an 1897 article in &quot;Athenaeum&quot; by A.T. Martin, who proposed that the author was Thomas Malory of Papworth St Agnes on the Huntingdonshire-Cambridgeshire border. Martin&#x27;s argument was based on a will made at Papworth on 16 September 1469 and proved at Lambeth Palace on 27 October the same year. This identification was taken seriously for some time by editors of Malory, including Alfred W. Pollard, the noted bibliographer, who included it in his edition of Malory published in 1903.

This Thomas Malory was born on 6 December 1425 at Moreton Corbet Castle, Shropshire, the eldest son of Sir William Mallory, member of Parliament for Cambridgeshire, who had married Margaret, the widow of Robert Corbet of Moreton Corbet. Thomas inherited his father&#x27;s estates in 1425 and was placed in the wardship of the King, initially as a minor, but later (for reasons unknown) remaining there until within four months of his death in 1469.

Richard R. Griffin later provided further support for this candidate in &quot;The Authorship Question Reconsidered&quot;. Published after Matthews&#x27;s book promoting the Hutton Conyers candidate (as described below), Griffin makes several arguments; most notably that the Papworth candidate&#x27;s dialect would match that of &quot;Le Morte&quot; more closely than either of the other candidates. As detailed below, a leading dialect expert identified the language of &quot;Le Morte&quot; as being most characteristic of Lincolnshire. Griffith points out that while the current candidate lived in Shropshire as a child and on the Cambridgeshire-Huntingdonshire border in adulthood, both his father and grandfather were from Lincolnshire; and that neither of the other two major candidates had any known connection to Lincolnshire.

Little else is known of this Malory, apart from one peculiar incident discovered by William Matthews. A collection of Chancery proceedings includes a petition brought against Malory by Richard Kyd, parson of Papworth, claiming that Malory ambushed him on a November evening and took him from Papworth to Huntingdon, and then to Bedford and on to Northampton, all the while threatening his life and demanding that he either forfeit his church to Malory or give him 100 pounds. The outcome of this case is unknown, but it seems to indicate that this Malory was something other than an ordinary country gentleman. However, while this candidate&#x27;s father and several other close family members were knights, no clear evidence survives showing that this Malory was ever actually knighted.

===Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers===
The third contender emerged in the mid-20th century: Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers and Studley Royal in Yorkshire. This claim was put forward in 1966 in &quot;The Ill-Framed Knight: A Skeptical Inquiry into the Identity of Sir Thomas Malory&quot; by William Matthews, a British professor who taught at UCLA (and also transcribed the diary of Samuel Pepys). This contender is also championed by Linton.

Matthews makes many arguments for this candidate, with his main focus on linguistic clues both in the Winchester manuscript and the Caxton edition of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;; including distinctive dialectal and stylistic elements such as alliteration that are characteristic of northerly writing. His claim drew scholarly attention including a review co-written by eminent medievalist E. F. Jacob and the famed linguist Angus McIntosh. Neither reviewer accepted Matthews&#x27;s claims entirely. Jacob agrees that the dialect of &quot;Le Morte&quot; is not that of Warwickshire, deferring to McIntosh for a more detailed dialectal analysis while noting that Matthews makes a good case for reopening the question of Malory&#x27;s identity. Linton, however, disputes several of McIntosh&#x27;s arguments, presenting a data driven analysis of the dialect in the &quot;Morte.&quot; Besides this analysis, she dismisses some of McIntosh&#x27;s arguments as trivial, noting quibbles between what dialect is northern and what is northerly, for example.

McIntosh&#x27;s dialectal analysis states that: “To put the matter simply, the original &quot;Le Morte Darthur&quot; contained various forms which are too northerly for the everyday language of Newbold Revel”. While McIntosh does not specifically support Matthews&#x27; claim of an origin in the Hutton Conyers area of Yorkshire, he ultimately concludes that the language would have been &quot;most at home&quot; in Lincolnshire but is characteristic of roughly anywhere north of a line from Chester to the Wash (see inset map). He suggests that Malory “simply had access to, and was deeply steeped in, far more northerly romance material&quot; than the specific texts which he is thought to have used.

Two central elements of Matthews&#x27;s argument for the Hutton Conyers candidate include his evidence of the advanced age of the Newbold Revel candidate at the time of writing, described in that section above; and Matthews&#x27; analysis of the exclusion of a &quot;Thomas Malarie, knight&quot; from a general pardon issued in 1468. The question of the identity of the Malory listed in this document is widely regarded as critical to the final identification of the author. In Field&#x27;s words: &quot;the Sir Thomas Malory who was exempted from pardon must have been the author of the &quot;Morte&quot;. No other conclusion is possible.&quot; While Field&#x27;s conclusion is widely accepted, Linton suggests he has attributed it to the wrong Malory, arguing that Malory of Hutton Conyers, a close associate of Neville, is the likely knight exempted from that pardon.

The pardon applied to a group of Lancastrians in a military campaign in the winter of 1462 in the Northern county of Northumberland near the Scottish border. Matthews shows that Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers was closely related to the &quot;Humphrey Neville, knight&quot; listed just before him in the short list of those excluded. Matthews also points out that this Northern campaign was geographically much closer to Hutton Conyers in Yorkshire than to Newbold Revel, and concludes that the document referred to the Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers - not to Malory of Newbold Revel, who was a Yorkist and would have been something in excess of 70 years old; far too old to have taken part in this Northern military campaign. Matthews therefore promotes this document as strong evidence that Malory of Hutton Conyers was indeed a knight after all and the author of the &quot;Morte&quot;. Linton offers additional evidence to illustrate the close connection between Humphrey Neville and Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers.

Matthews&#x27;s interpretation was not universally accepted, primarily because he could not find evidence that the Yorkshireman was a knight. Linton, however, has removed that principal objection, providing extensive detail about the Malorys of Yorkshire and offering evidence that Thomas of Yorkshire was a Knight Hospitaller, a knight of the church. She also examines the provenance of some of the known sources of the Morte and demonstrates that this Malory would have had ready access to these documents.

In spite of Matthews&#x27;s strong evidence of the Newbold Revel knight&#x27;s advanced age, Field has long argued that the 1468 exclusion from pardon refers to Malory of Newbold Revel and instead shows that that candidate changed his lifelong Yorkist loyalty to become a Lancastrian. It seems equally plausible, however, to realize that the Knight Hospitaller from Hutton Conyers, who was close to Neville, was excluded from pardon, rather than to think the Newbold Revel knight changed political stripes.

Outside of the contested pardon-exclusion, Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers was not recorded as having been a knight in the generally accepted secular sense, though his elder brother John and most of his recent forefathers were knights. If to accept Linton&#x27;s argument that the Yorkshire Thomas was a Knight Hospitaller, the primary objection to his authorship is removed and the contradictions presented by the Newbold Revel knight become irrelevant.

===Thomas Malory of Wales===
Even only a few years after the original publication of &quot;Le Morte&quot;, there was speculation as to Malory&#x27;s identity. The earliest identification was made by John Bale, a 16th-century antiquarian, who declared that Malory was Welsh, hailing from &quot;Mailoria&quot; on the River Dee. This theory received further support from Sir John Rhys, who proclaimed in 1893 that the alternative spelling indicated an area straddling the border between England and North Wales, Maleore in Flintshire and Maleor in Denbighshire. On this theory, Malory may have been related to Edward Rhys Maelor, a 15th-century Welsh poet. It was also suggested by antiquary John Leland that he was Welsh, identifying &quot;Malory&quot; with &quot;Maelor&quot;. However, most modern scholars have disregarded this early work on the basis that no such place as &quot;Mailoria&quot; has ever been identified on the Dee or elsewhere; no Welsh Thomas Malory appears in the surviving historical record; and Malory identified himself as English rather than Welsh.

== Works ==
Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; (&quot;The Death of Arthur&quot;) is the source of the modern form of most Arthurian mythology, and is the only major work of English literature between Geoffrey Chaucer, around a century earlier, and Shakespeare, around a century later. It has been called the first English novel. Malory&#x27;s main sources for his work included Arthurian French prose romances, mainly the Vulgate (&quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot;) and Post-Vulgate cycles, Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;), and two anonymous English works called the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot; and the Stanzaic &quot;Morte Arthur&quot;.

The entire work is eight romances that span twenty-one books with 507 chapters, which was said to be considerably shorter than the original French sources, despite its vast size. Malory was responsible for organizing these diverse sources and consolidating them into a cohesive whole. The work was originally titled &quot;The Whole Book of King Arthur and of His Noble Knights of the Round Table&quot;, but printer William Caxton changed it to &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; (originally &quot;Le Morte Darthur&quot;) before he printed it in 1485, as well as making several other editorial changes. According to one theory, the eight romances were originally intended to be separate, but Caxton altered them to be more unified.

There has been some argument among critics that Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; was primarily intended as a political commentary of Malory&#x27;s own era. Malory portrays an initially idyllic past under the strong leadership of King Arthur and his knights, but as intrigue and infighting develop, the utopic kingdom collapses, which may have been intended as a parallel and a warning against the infighting taking place during the Wars of the Roses. The seemingly contradictory changes in King Arthur&#x27;s character throughout the work have been argued to support the theory that Arthur represents different eras and reigns throughout the tales. This argument has also been used to attempt to reconcile Malory&#x27;s doubtful reputation as a person who continually changed sides with the unexpected idealism of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. It remains a matter of some debate whether this was a deliberate commentary or an imaginative fiction influenced by the political climate. All these arguments depend upon acceptance of the Newbold Revel Malory as the author.

The sources of the romances that make up &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, and Malory&#x27;s treatment of those sources, correspond to some degree with those of a poem called &quot;The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle&quot;; they also both end with a similarly worded prayer to be released from imprisonment. This has led some scholars in recent years to believe that Malory may have been the author of the poem.

==In fiction==
A young Malory appears as a character at the end of T. H. White&#x27;s book &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; (1958), which was based on &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. This cameo is included in the Broadway musical &quot;Camelot&quot; (1960), and in its film adaptation (1967), where his name is given as &quot;Tom of Warwick&quot;; reflecting the general acceptance of Malory of Newbold Revel (in Warwickshire) as the author through most of the 20th century, despite the criminal history of that candidate in his later life.

In addition to White&#x27;s treatment, many other modern versions of the Arthurian legend have their roots in Malory, including John Boorman&#x27;s film &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981). The discovery of Malory&#x27;s book and its acquisition by William Caxton form key elements in &quot;The Load of Unicorn&quot; (1959), a children&#x27;s novel by Cynthia Harnett.

<doc id="30641" wikidata="Q465395" url="?curid=30641" title="The Black Cat (short story)">
<text>&quot;The Black Cat&quot; is a short story by the American writer Edgar Allan Poe. It was first published in the August 19, 1843, edition of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. In the story, an unnamed narrator has a strong affection for pets until he perversely turns to abusing them. His favorite, a pet black cat, bites him one night and the narrator punishes it by cutting its eye out and then hanging it from a tree. The home burns down but one remaining wall shows a burned outline of a cat hanging from a noose. He soon finds another black cat, similar to the first except for a white mark on its chest, but he develops a hatred for it as well. He attempts to kill the cat with an axe but his wife stops him; instead, the narrator murders his wife. He conceals the body behind a brick wall in his basement. The police soon come and, after the narrator&#x27;s tapping on the wall is met with a shrieking sound, they find not only the wife&#x27;s corpse but also the black cat that had been accidentally walled in with the body and alerted them with its cry.

The story is a study of the psychology of guilt, often paired in analysis with Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;. In both, a murderer carefully conceals his crime and believes himself unassailable, but eventually breaks down and reveals himself, impelled by a nagging reminder of his guilt. &quot;The Black Cat&quot;, which also features questions of sanity versus insanity, is Poe&#x27;s strongest warning against the dangers of alcoholism.

== Plot ==
The story is presented as a first-person narrative, using an unnamed unreliable narrator who is awaiting execution. He describes his lifelong love of animals and the many pets that he and his wife have taken in, including a large black cat named Pluto. The narrator and Pluto become particularly fond of each other, but after several years the narrator becomes an alcoholic and begins to mistreat his pets. After a night of heavy drinking, he believes that Pluto is avoiding him and seizes the cat, only to suffer a bite on his hand. Enraged, he gouges out one of the cat&#x27;s eyes.

From that moment on, Pluto flees in terror at the narrator&#x27;s approach; the narrator feels remorse for his cruelty at first, but soon becomes increasingly irritated at the cat&#x27;s behavior. In a sudden fit of rage, he ties a noose around Pluto&#x27;s neck and hangs it from a tree, where it dies. The narrator&#x27;s house mysteriously burns down that night; he, his wife, and their servant escape unharmed but lose all their possessions. The house collapses, except for one wall that displays the indented image of a gigantic cat with a noose around its neck. The narrator is initially disturbed by this phenomenon but soon constructs a plausible explanation, thinking that someone may have cut the cat&#x27;s corpse down from the tree and thrown it into the bedroom to wake him during the fire, where it struck a patch of fresh plaster.

Feeling guilty for his actions, the narrator subsequently finds another black cat at a tavern and adopts it. This cat is roughly the same size as Pluto and is also missing one eye, but has a large patch of white fur on its chest that Pluto lacked. Over time, the narrator begins to fear and loathe the cat, as it reminds him of his cruelty toward Pluto, and sees to his horror that the white patch is slowly taking the shape of a gallows. He tries to kill the cat with an axe, but his wife stops him; infuriated at her interference, he kills her instead and hides her corpse in a cellar wall. Upon finishing his work, he finds that the cat has disappeared and is able to sleep freely at night.

Four days later, the police search the house but can find no trace of the narrator&#x27;s missing wife. He accompanies them into the cellar, boasting of the sturdiness of its walls and striking the one he has built to conceal his wife&#x27;s corpse. An unearthly howl issues from behind it, shattering the narrator&#x27;s mental state completely. The police tear down the wall and find the corpse, with the cat alive and sitting atop its head, having been walled in with it.

== Publication history ==

&quot;The Black Cat&quot; was first published in the August 19, 1843, issue of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. At the time, the publication was using the temporary title &quot;United States Saturday Post&quot;. The story was reprinted in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and &quot;The Pensacola Gazette&quot; that same year. Readers immediately responded favorably to the story, spawning parodies including Thomas Dunn English&#x27;s &quot;The Ghost of the Grey Tadpole&quot;.

== Analysis ==
Like the narrator in Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, the narrator of &quot;The Black Cat&quot; is of questionable sanity. In the beginning of the tale, the narrator says that he would be &quot;mad indeed&quot; should he expect a reader to believe the story, implying that he has already been accused of madness.

The extent to which the narrator claims to have loved his animals suggests mental instability in the form of having “too much of a good thing”. His partiality for animals substitutes “the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man”. Since the narrator&#x27;s wife shares his love of animals, he likely thinks of her as another pet, seeing as he distrusts and dislikes humans. Additionally, his failure to understand his excessive love of animals foreshadows his inability to explain his motives for his actions.

One of Poe&#x27;s darkest tales, &quot;The Black Cat&quot; includes his strongest denunciation of alcohol. The narrator&#x27;s perverse actions are brought on by his alcoholism, a &quot;disease&quot; and &quot;fiend&quot; which also destroys his personality. The use of the black cat evokes various superstitions, including the idea voiced by the narrator&#x27;s wife that they are all witches in disguise. Poe owned a black cat. In his &quot;Instinct vs Reason – A Black Cat&quot; he stated: &quot;The writer of this article is the owner of one of the most remarkable black cats in the world – and this is saying much; for it will be remembered that black cats are all of them witches.&quot; In Scottish and Irish mythology, the Cat-sìth is described as being a black cat with a white spot on its chest, not unlike the cat the narrator finds in the tavern. The eponymous cat is named Pluto after the Roman god of the Underworld.

Although Pluto is a neutral character at the beginning of the story, he becomes antagonistic in the narrator&#x27;s eyes once the narrator becomes an alcoholic. The alcohol pushes the narrator into fits of intemperance and violence, to the point at which everything angers him – Pluto in particular, who is always by his side, becomes the malevolent witch who haunts him even while avoiding his presence. When the narrator cuts Pluto&#x27;s eye from its socket, this can be seen as symbolic of self-inflicted partial blindness to his own vision of moral goodness.

The fire that destroys the narrator&#x27;s house symbolizes the narrator&#x27;s &quot;almost complete moral disintegration&quot;. The only remainder is the impression of Pluto upon the wall, which represents his unforgivable and incorrigible sin.

From a rhetorician&#x27;s standpoint, an effective scheme of omission that Poe employs is diazeugma, or using many verbs for one subject; it omits pronouns. Diazeugma emphasizes actions and makes the narrative swift and brief.

== Adaptations ==
*In 1910–11, Futurist artist Gino Severini painted &quot;The Black Cat&quot; in direct reference to Poe&#x27;s short story.

* &quot;Unheimliche Geschichten&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Uncanny Stories&quot;, &quot;The Living Dead&quot;) is a 1932 German horror film which merges three Poe short stories and Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;The Suicide Club&quot;.

* Universal Pictures made two films titled &quot;The Black Cat&quot;, one in 1934, starring Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff, and another in 1941, starring Lugosi and Basil Rathbone. Both films claimed to have been &quot;suggested by&quot; Poe&#x27;s story, but neither bears any resemblance to the tale, aside from the presence of a black cat. Elements of Poe&#x27;s story were, however, used in the 1934 film &quot;Maniac&quot;.

*&quot;The Black Cat&quot; was adapted into a seven-page comic strip in &quot;Yellowjacket Comics&quot; #1 (1944).
*Sept. 18, 1947, &quot;Mystery in the Air&quot; radio program with Peter Lorre as the protagonist in &quot;The Black Cat&quot;. Note: the cat&#x27;s eye is not gouged out. Instead, the cat&#x27;s ear is torn.
*The middle segment of director Roger Corman&#x27;s 1962 anthology film &quot;Tales of Terror&quot; combines the story of &quot;The Black Cat&quot; with that of another Poe tale, &quot;The Cask of Amontillado.&quot; This version stars Peter Lorre as the main character (given the name Montresor Herringbone) and Vincent Price as Fortunato Luchresi. The amalgamation of the two stories provides a motive for the murderer: Fortunato has an affair with Montresor&#x27;s wife.
*In 1966, &quot;The Black Cat&quot;, a version directed by Harold Hoffman and loosely based on Poe&#x27;s story, was released starring Robert Frost, Robyn Baker and Sadie French.
*In 1970, Czech writer Ludvík Vaculík made many references to &quot;A Descent into the Maelström&quot;, as well as &quot;The Black Cat&quot;, in his novel &quot;&quot;.
*In 1972, Poe&#x27;s story was adapted in the Italian horror-giallo film &quot;Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key&quot;, directed by Sergio Martino and starring Edwige Fenech, Anita Strindberg and Luigi Pistilli. 
*In 1973, James Stewart recorded a reading of &quot;The Black Cat&quot; for BBC Radio.
*Writer/director Lucio Fulci&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;The Black Cat&quot; is loosely based on Poe&#x27;s tale.
*The 1990 film &quot;Two Evil Eyes&quot; presents two Poe tales, &quot;The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar&quot; and &quot;The Black Cat.&quot; The former was written and directed by George A. Romero, while the latter was written and directed by Dario Argento. This version stars Harvey Keitel in the lead role.
*In 1997, a compilation of Poe&#x27;s work was released on a double CD entitled &quot;Closed on Account of Rabies&quot;, with various celebrities lending their voices to the tales. &quot;The Black Cat&quot; was read by avant-garde performer Diamanda Galás.
*&quot;The Black Cat&quot; was adapted and performed with &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; as &quot;Poe, Times Two: Twin tales of mystery, murder...and mortar&quot;—a double-bill of short, one-man plays written and performed by Greg Oliver Bodine. First produced in NYC at Manhattan Theatre Source in 2007, and again at WorkShop Theater Company in 2011. Part of the 2012 season at Cape May Stage in Cape May, NJ.
*&quot;The Black Cat&quot; is the 11th episode of the second season (2007) of the television series &quot;Masters of Horror&quot;. It was directed by Stuart Gordon, and features Jeffrey Combs as Poe. The plot essentially retells the short story in a semi-autobiographical manner, with Poe himself undergoing a series of events involving a black cat which he used to inspire the story of the same name.
*In 2012, Big Fish Games released a point and click mystery game loosely based on the story called &quot;Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s The Black Cat: Dark Tales&quot;
*In 2011, Hyper Aware Theater Company produced &quot;The Black Cat&quot;, one of several Poe stage adaptations written by Lance Tait, as part of its “Gutterdrunk: The Poe Revisions” in New York City. Ava Caridad has written that in this stage adaptation the “unreliable narrator [has been changed] from male to female”... and this narrator has been split “into two separate characters representing one person.”
* The 2020 Ahoy Comics comic book &quot;Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s Snifter of Blood&quot; #1 includes a pastiche of the story by Paul Cornell and Russell Braun under the title &quot;The Black Cat Dog&quot;. As the title suggests, the cat is replaced by a dog, who also narrates the story. However, he refuses to see his master in a bad light and is utterly unaware of the man&#x27;s hatred or guilt.
* The fourth episode of the 2023 series &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; titled &quot;The Black Cat&quot; is loosely based on the story.

<text>&quot;Golden Brown&quot; is a song by English rock band the Stranglers, released as a 7-inch single on EMI&#x27;s Liberty label in 1982. Noted for its distinctive harpsichord instrumentation, it was the second single released from the band&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;La Folie&quot; (1981). The single peaked at No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, making it the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in the country. It has also been recorded by many other artists.

==Composition==
The main body of the song has a triple metre waltz rhythm, with beats grouped in threes, but the instrumental parts add an extra beat to create a phrase of thirteen beats. The thirteen beats appear in the sheet music as alternating bars of and , which has also been described as three bars of followed by one bar of . Sheet music of &quot;Golden Brown&quot; on musicnotes.com is published in B-flat minor.

The music was largely written by keyboardist Dave Greenfield and drummer Jet Black, with lyrics by singer/guitarist Hugh Cornwell. The music was adapted from an unused part of &quot;Second Coming&quot;, a track which featured on their previous album.

According to bassist Jean-Jacques Burnel, the song&#x27;s atypical style for the group was intended to defy expectations: &quot;The whole thing about that song is it really represented us sticking our fingers up to our detractors&quot;.

===Lyrics===
In his 2001 book &quot;The Stranglers Song by Song&quot;, Cornwell states: Golden Brown&#x27; works on two levels. It&#x27;s about heroin and also about a girl... both provided me with pleasurable times.&quot;

==Release and reception==
Initially, the band&#x27;s label was hesitant to release the song as a single. Burnel recalled, &quot;We had to insist on it being released. We&#x27;d been taken over by EMI and they thought we were awful – and they hated &#x27;Golden Brown&#x27;. They said: this song, you can&#x27;t dance to it, you&#x27;re finished&quot;. The label ultimately released the song during the Christmas season, leaving it to compete with Christmas songs. Burnel stated, &quot;They thought, it&#x27;s weak, it&#x27;s gonna die, it&#x27;s gonna drown in the tsunami of Christmas shit… but it didn&#x27;t. It developed legs of its own, it became a worldwide hit&quot;.

Originally featured on the group&#x27;s album &quot;La folie&quot;, which was released in November 1981, and later on the US pressings of &quot;Feline&quot; (1983), &quot;Golden Brown&quot; was released as a single in January 1982, and was accompanied by a music video. The single reached No. 2 in the official UK Singles Chart in February 1982. David Hamilton, disc jockey on the middle-of-the-road and comparatively conservative BBC Radio 2, made the single his &quot;record of the week&quot;. In a 2017 interview for Dutch television station Top 2000 a gogo, Hugh Cornwell said that he believed the song would have made it to the top spot if bassist Burnel had not told the press that it was about heroin, at which point broadcasters removed it from their playlists. &quot;I would have waited till it got to Number 1 and then said it,&quot; he commented. EMI instead blamed the single&#x27;s failure to reach the top spot on sales of both the studio and live single releases of the Jam&#x27;s &quot;Town Called Malice&quot;, the number one single at the time, being counted together. The song also reached the Top 10 in Ireland, Flanders, the Netherlands, and Australia.

In 1995, Black, Burnel and Greenfield appeared with impressionist Rory Bremner on his satirical Christmas special performing a parody version of the song about future Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who was then Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer.

In a 2012 BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the nation&#x27;s favourite singles to have peaked at number two, &quot;Golden Brown&quot; ranked fifth.

In January 2014, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the song at No. 488 on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

==Music video==

The video for &quot;Golden Brown&quot; was directed by Lindsey Clennell. It depicts the band members as explorers in Egypt in the 1920s and performers for a fictional &quot;Radio Cairo&quot;.

The video is intercut with stock footage of the Giza pyramid complex, the Mir-i-Arab Madrasah in Bukhara, the Shah Mosque in Isfahan, the Great Sphinx, sailing feluccas, Bedouins riding camels, and camel racing in the United Arab Emirates. The performance scenes were filmed in the Leighton House Museum in Holland Park, London, which was also featured in the video for &quot;Gold&quot; by Spandau Ballet in 1983.

<text>Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band that singer-songwriter-guitarist Pete Shelley and singer-songwriter Howard Devoto formed in Manchester in 1976. During their career, the band combined elements of punk rock, power pop, and pop punk. They achieved commercial success with singles that fuse pop craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy; these singles were later collected on &quot;Singles Going Steady&quot;, an acclaimed compilation album music journalist and critic Ned Raggett described as a &quot;punk masterpiece&quot;.

Devoto left the band in 1977 and formed Magazine, after which Pete Shelley became the principal singer-songwriter. The classic lineup of Shelley, Steve Diggle (guitar), Steve Garvey (bass) and John Maher (drums) recorded Buzzcocks&#x27; first three albums, after which the band broke up in 1981 following a dispute with their record label. The band reunited in 1989 and released six more albums before Shelley&#x27;s death in 2018. Prolific members during that time included Tony Barber (bass) and Phil Barker (drums). The band has remained active, being anchored by long-time guitarist Diggle, who has since also assumed lead vocal duties. As of 2019, the band consists of Diggle, Danny Farrant (drums), Chris Remington (bass) and touring member Mani Perazzoli (guitar, backing vocals). This line-up released the band&#x27;s tenth album, &quot;Sonics in the Soul&quot; in 2022.

== Career ==
=== Early years ===
Howard Trafford, a student at Bolton Institute of Technology who had been involved in electronic music, placed a notice in the college looking for musicians to play The Velvet Underground&#x27;s song &quot;Sister Ray&quot;. Fellow student Peter McNeish, who had played in a rock band called Jets of Air, responded to the notice.

By late 1975, Trafford and McNeish had recruited a drummer and formed an early version of what would become Buzzcocks. The band formed in February 1976; McNeish assumed the stage name Pete Shelley and Trafford named himself Howard Devoto.

Devoto and Shelley chose the name &quot;Buzzcocks&quot; after reading the headline &quot;It&#x27;s the Buzz, Cock!&quot; in a review of the television series &quot;Rock Follies&quot; in &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine. The &quot;buzz&quot; is the excitement of playing on stage and &quot;cock&quot; is northern English slang meaning &quot;friend&quot;. They thought the name captured the excitement of the nascent punk scene and had humorous sexual connotations following Pete Shelley&#x27;s time working in a Bolton adult shop.

Buzzcocks performed live for the first time on 1 April 1976 at their college. Garth Davies played bass guitar and Mick Singleton, who also played in local band Black Cat Bone, played drums.

After reading an &quot;NME&quot; review of Sex Pistols&#x27; first performance, in February 1976, Shelley and Devoto travelled to High Wycombe together to see Sex Pistols. Shelley and Devoto were impressed by the show and arranged for Sex Pistols to perform at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester in June 1976. Buzzcocks intended to play at this concert but the other musicians dropped out, and Shelley and Devoto were unable to recruit replacements in time for the gig. Once they had recruited bass guitarist Steve Diggle and drummer John Maher, Buzzcocks made their debut opening for Sex Pistols&#x27; second Manchester concert on 20 July 1976 at the same venue. A brief clip of Devoto-era Buzzcocks performing the Troggs&#x27; &quot;I Can&#x27;t Control Myself&quot; appears in the documentary &quot;Punk: Attitude&quot;, which was directed by Don Letts. Buzzcocks made their London debut at The Screen on the Green in support of the Clash and Sex Pistols, while the next month they played the two-day 100 Club Punk Festival, which was organised by Malcolm McLaren, and would later replace the Damned on the Anarchy in the UK Tour.

In between these live performances, Buzzcocks began developing their own material and recorded an 11-track demo at Stockport Studios which was eventually released in 1991. By the end of the year, Buzzcocks had recorded and released a four-track EP called &quot;Spiral Scratch&quot;, which they released on their own label New Hormones, making them one of the first punk groups to establish an independent record label. The EP was produced by Martin Hannett at Indigo Sound Studios; the music was roughly recorded, insistently repetitive and energetic. The EP was re-released in September 1979 and reached number 31 in the charts.

In March 1977, Devoto announced his departure from the band, expressing his dissatisfaction at the direction punk was taking in his statement: &quot;I don&#x27;t like movements. What was once unhealthily fresh is now a clean old hat&quot;. He returned to college for a year then formed a band called Magazine. Pete Shelley took on the vocal duties for Buzzcocks and moved away from social commentary to adolescent themes. Steve Diggle switched from bass to guitar, and Garth Davies—also known as Garth Smith—rejoined Buzzcocks to play bass. The band joined The Clash as support on their White Riot tour.

=== Mainstream success ===
The new line-up signed with United Artists Records (UA) at Electric Circus, Manchester, on 16 August 1977, the day Elvis Presley died. The first UA Buzzcocks single &quot;Orgasm Addict&quot; was released in October 1977; It was the start of a collaboration with producer Martin Rushent that would last until the end of the decade. The band embarked on a headlining tour, during which Smith was found to be unreliable and was replaced with Steve Garvey.

Buzzcocks&#x27; next single &quot;What Do I Get?&quot;, which was released in February 1978, reached number 37 in the UK chart. It was followed the next month by their debut album &quot;Another Music in a Different Kitchen&quot;, which reached number 15 in the chart. In May, the band embarked on the Entertaining Friends tour while a third single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind&quot; reached number 55 in the singles chart. In July, a fourth single &quot;Love You More&quot; reached number 34. The band spent mid 1978 recording their second album &quot;Love Bites&quot;, which reached number 13 in the chart. After a 26-date UK tour, Buzzcocks gained success as their single &quot;Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve)&quot; reached number 12 in the UK chart in October 1978. In December, the band released the single &quot;Promises&quot;, which reached number 20 in the UK chart. The single&#x27;s B-side &quot;Lipstick&quot; shared the same ascending progression of notes in its chorus as Magazine&#x27;s first single &quot;Shot By Both Sides&quot;, which was released earlier that year.

In 1979, Buzzcocks prepared for their first European tour while working on new material. In March, the band released the single &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Happy Nowadays&quot;, which reached number 29 in the chart. The tour that followed culminated at Hammersmith Odeon; the concert was recorded and released in 1992 as &quot;Entertaining Friends&quot;. in mid 1979, the band completed the recording of their third album while a second single &quot;Harmony in my Head&quot; reached number 32 in August. Prior to their first venture to the US, I.R.S. Records released the band&#x27;s singles compilation &quot;Singles Going Steady&quot; there.

The band&#x27;s third album &quot;A Different Kind of Tension&quot; was released the end of September 1979 and reached number 26 in the chart while the band completed a second UK tour. The album&#x27;s single &quot;You Say You Don&#x27;t Love Me&quot; failed to chart. A period of inactivity lasted until September 1980 when the double-A side &quot;Why She&#x27;s A Girl From The Chainstore/Are Everything&quot; was released. It reached number 61 and was the band&#x27;s last charting single. Two further singles &quot;Strange Thing&quot; and &quot;Running Free&quot; failed to chart while the band embarked on a truncated UK tour.

=== Break-up and reunion ===

After recording demos for a fourth album, Buzzcocks disbanded in 1981; Shelley took up a solo career, and Diggle and Maher formed Flag of Convenience and released several singles between 1982 and 1989. Garvey formed Motivation and joined Blue Orchids, moving to New York shortly afterwards to continue with Motivation. Maher had joined Wah! by the time Buzzcocks broke up; as of 2012, he owned John Maher Racing, a vintage Volkswagen performance-tuning workshop on the Isle of Harris, Scotland.

Between 1988 and 1989, EMI re-released much of Buzzcocks&#x27; back catalogue on Compact Disc (CD), as well as a Peel Sessions album and a box set called &quot;Product&quot;. This prompted the band to reform with the original line-up for a world tour. Maher was briefly replaced with The Smiths drummer Mike Joyce. In 1991, Buzzcocks released new material on the four-track EP &quot;Alive Tonight&quot;. In the US, interest in the band increased after I.R.S. Records released the compilation album &quot;Operator&#x27;s Manual: Buzzcocks Best&quot;. It was followed two years later by the fourth studio album &quot;Trade Test Transmissions&quot;.

In 1992, bassist Tony Barber and drummer Phil Barker joined Buzzcocks; this line-up toured with Nirvana in 1994, one of Nirvana&#x27;s last tours. In 1996, Buzzcocks released the live album &quot;French&quot;, which was recorded in Paris the previous year. Also in 1996, the band&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;All Set&quot; was released. Buzcocks continued to tour and in September 1999, they released the album &quot;Modern&quot;.

In 2000, Mute Records released the 1976 demos that were recorded while Devoto was in the band as &quot;Time&#x27;s Up&quot;, which had long been available as a bootleg. This album includes alternative takes of all the tracks from the EP &quot;Spiral Scratch&quot; and early versions of tracks that later appeared on &quot;Another Music in a Different Kitchen&quot;.

===21st century===
in 2002, Shelley and Devoto collaborated for the first time since 1976, producing the album &quot;Buzzkunst&quot;, &quot;Kunst&quot; being the German word for &#x27;Art&#x27;. The album is a mix of electronic music and punk. Buzzcocks toured as support for Pearl Jam in 2003 and released their seventh, self-titled studio album.

In 2005, as a tribute to BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel, Shelley re-recorded &quot;Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve)&quot; with a group including Roger Daltrey, David Gilmour, Peter Hook, Elton John, Robert Plant and several contemporaneous bands. Proceeds from the single were donated to Amnesty International. Shelley also performed the song live with Plant, Daltrey, Gilmour, Hook and Jeff Beck at the 2005 UK Music Hall of Fame.

In April 2006, Barker left Buzzcocks and was replaced with Danny Farrant. In March 2006, the band released their eighth studio album &quot;Flat-Pack Philosophy&quot; on Cooking Vinyl Records. On the supporting tour, Buzzcocks played on a leg of the mid-2006 Vans Warped Tour and made an appearance at Maxïmo Park&#x27;s homecoming gig in Newcastle upon Tyne on 15 December 2007. In April 2008, Barber left the band and was replaced with Chris Remington.

In January 2009, Buzzcocks embarked on a UK and European tour, the &quot;Another Bites Tour&quot;, in which they played their first two albums in full, as well as an encore of their other hits.

In the same year, Buzzcocks played in Serbia for the second time at the EXIT festival in Novi Sad. Their song &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I Touch It&quot; was played in the second episode of the sixth season of the television series &quot;Entourage&quot;. On 9 November 2009, Buzzcocks gave a performance on a small balcony overlooking Dame Street, Dublin, for the viral music show BalconyTV.

In December 2009, the band played as the main support act for The Courteeners. In August 2011, they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire. 

On 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy, Buzzcocks performed with the original line-up, including Devoto. On 26 May 2012, the band announced for the first time they would headline Thursday night at Empress Ballroom at Rebellion Festival in Blackpool, performing with Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

On 1 May 2014, Buzzcocks released the album &quot;The Way&quot; via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014, they played &quot;a brief but triumphant set&quot; at Riot Fest in Chicago, Illinois, US. In October 2014, they toured the UK for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support. 

In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour &quot;Buzzcocks 40&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I Touch It&quot; was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game &quot;&#x27;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;.

=== Shelley&#x27;s death and aftermath ===
Pete Shelley died on 6 December 2018 from a suspected heart attack at his home in Tallinn, Estonia.

In June 2019, Buzzcocks performed with several guest vocalists as a tribute to Shelley. The concert had been planned before his death. Steve Diggle said that Buzzcocks would continue, with the post-Shelley Buzzcocks being a &#x27;new era&#x27;. &quot;Sonics in the Soul&quot;, the band&#x27;s first album without Shelley, was released in September 2022. It featured Diggle on all vocals, and included a tribute to Shelley in the form of the track &quot;You&#x27;ve Changed Everything Now&quot;.

== Style ==

Buzzcocks are a punk rock band that exhibit &quot;crisp melodies&quot;, &quot;driving guitars&quot; and &quot;biting lyrics&quot;. According to Mark Deming of AllMusic, that instead of drawing on political lyrical themes, the band &quot;brought an intense, brilliant vigor to the three-minute pop song, powered by Shelley&#x27;s alternately funny and anguished lyrics about adolescence and love, backed by melodies and hooks that were concise and memorable.&quot; Buzzcocks&#x27; distinctive sound combines catchy pop melodies with punk guitar energy, backed by an unusually tight and skilled rhythm section. They grew in musical and lyrical sophistication; by the end, they were quoting American writer William S. Burroughs&#x27; &quot;A Different Kind of Tension&quot;, declaiming their catechism in the anthem &quot;I Believe&quot;, and tuning in to a fantasy radio station on which their songs could be heard (&quot;Radio Nine&quot;).
== Legacy ==
Buzzcocks have had a significant impact on American punk, hardcore, and alternative rock acts, being cited as an influence by Dead Kennedys guitarist East Bay Ray, Parquet Courts, Hüsker Dü, Superchunk, and Dag Nasty.

Buzzcocks&#x27; name was combined with the title of Sex Pistols&#x27; album &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; to create the title of the long-running UK comedy television panel game show &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. Diggle said in his autobiography he and Shelley only granted the BBC use of their name under the impression it would be a one-off, probably unsuccessful, pilot, and that they are now mildly disgruntled the name is more readily associated in Britain with the series than with their band. Shelley appeared on the programme in 2000, when host Mark Lamarr introduced Shelley by saying without Buzzcocks &quot;there&#x27;d be no Smiths or Radiohead, and this show would be called &quot;Never Mind Joan Armatrading&quot;&quot;.

Mark Deming of AllMusic called Buzzcocks &quot;one of the best, most influential punk bands of all time&quot;.

<doc id="30647" wikidata="Q2477230" url="?curid=30647" title="Tidal acceleration">
<text>Tidal acceleration is an effect of the tidal forces between an orbiting natural satellite (e.g. the Moon) and the primary planet that it orbits (e.g. Earth). The acceleration causes a gradual recession of a satellite in a prograde orbit (satellite moving to a higher orbit, away from the primary body, with a lower orbital velocity and hence a longer orbital period), and a corresponding slowdown of the primary&#x27;s rotation. See supersynchronous orbit. The process eventually leads to &quot;tidal locking&quot;, usually of the smaller body first, and later the larger body (e.g. theoretically with Earth-Moon system in 50 billion years). The Earth–Moon system is the best-studied case.

The similar process of tidal deceleration occurs for satellites that have an orbital period that is shorter than the primary&#x27;s rotational period, or that orbit in a retrograde direction. These satellites will have a higher and higher orbital velocity and a shorter and shorter orbital period, until a final collision with the primary. See subsynchronous orbit.

The naming is somewhat confusing, because the average speed of the satellite relative to the body it orbits is &quot;decreased&quot; as a result of tidal acceleration, and &quot;increased&quot; as a result of tidal deceleration. This conundrum occurs because a positive acceleration at one instant causes the satellite to loop farther outward during the next half orbit, decreasing its average speed. A continuing positive acceleration causes the satellite to spiral outward with a decreasing speed and angular rate, resulting in a negative acceleration of angle. A continuing negative acceleration has the opposite effect.

== Earth–Moon system ==
=== Discovery history of the secular acceleration ===
Edmond Halley was the first to suggest, in 1695, that the mean motion of the Moon was apparently getting faster, by comparison with ancient eclipse observations, but he gave no data. (It was not yet known in Halley&#x27;s time that what is actually occurring includes a slowing-down of Earth&#x27;s rate of rotation: see also Ephemeris time – History. When measured as a function of mean solar time rather than uniform time, the effect appears as a positive acceleration.) In 1749 Richard Dunthorne confirmed Halley&#x27;s suspicion after re-examining ancient records, and produced the first quantitative estimate for the size of this apparent effect: a centurial rate of +10″ (arcseconds) in lunar longitude, which is a surprisingly accurate result for its time, not differing greatly from values assessed later, &quot;e.g.&quot; in 1786 by de Lalande, and to compare with values from about 10″ to nearly 13″ being derived about a century later.

Pierre-Simon Laplace produced in 1786 a theoretical analysis giving a basis on which the Moon&#x27;s mean motion should accelerate in response to perturbational changes in the eccentricity of the orbit of Earth around the Sun. Laplace&#x27;s initial computation accounted for the whole effect, thus seeming to tie up the theory neatly with both modern and ancient observations.

However, in 1854, John Couch Adams caused the question to be re-opened by finding an error in Laplace&#x27;s computations: it turned out that only about half of the Moon&#x27;s apparent acceleration could be accounted for on Laplace&#x27;s basis by the change in Earth&#x27;s orbital eccentricity. Adams&#x27; finding provoked a sharp astronomical controversy that lasted some years, but the correctness of his result, agreed upon by other mathematical astronomers including C. E. Delaunay, was eventually accepted. The question depended on correct analysis of the lunar motions, and received a further complication with another discovery, around the same time, that another significant long-term perturbation that had been calculated for the Moon (supposedly due to the action of Venus) was also in error, was found on re-examination to be almost negligible, and practically had to disappear from the theory. A part of the answer was suggested independently in the 1860s by Delaunay and by William Ferrel: tidal retardation of Earth&#x27;s rotation rate was lengthening the unit of time and causing a lunar acceleration that was only apparent.

It took some time for the astronomical community to accept the reality and the scale of tidal effects. But eventually it became clear that three effects are involved, when measured in terms of mean solar time. Beside the effects of perturbational changes in Earth&#x27;s orbital eccentricity, as found by Laplace and corrected by Adams, there are two tidal effects (a combination first suggested by Emmanuel Liais). First there is a real retardation of the Moon&#x27;s angular rate of orbital motion, due to tidal exchange of angular momentum between Earth and Moon. This increases the Moon&#x27;s angular momentum around Earth (and moves the Moon to a higher orbit with a lower orbital speed). Secondly, there is an apparent increase in the Moon&#x27;s angular rate of orbital motion (when measured in terms of mean solar time). This arises from Earth&#x27;s loss of angular momentum and the consequent increase in length of day.

=== Effects of Moon&#x27;s gravity ===
The plane of the Moon&#x27;s orbit around Earth lies close to the plane of Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun (the ecliptic), rather than in the plane of the Earth&#x27;s rotation (the equator) as is usually the case with planetary satellites. The mass of the Moon is sufficiently large, and it is sufficiently close, to raise tides in the matter of Earth. Foremost among such matter, the water of the oceans bulges out both towards and away from the Moon. If the material of the Earth responded immediately, there would be a bulge directly toward and away from the Moon. In the solid Earth tides, there is a delayed response due to the dissipation of tidal energy. The case for the oceans is more complicated, but there is also a delay associated with the dissipation of energy since the Earth rotates at a faster rate than the Moon&#x27;s orbital angular velocity. This lunitidal interval in the responses causes the tidal bulge to be carried forward. Consequently, the line through the two bulges is tilted with respect to the Earth-Moon direction exerting torque between the Earth and the Moon. This torque boosts the Moon in its orbit and slows the rotation of Earth.

As a result of this process, the mean solar day, which has to be 86,400 equal seconds, is actually getting longer when measured in SI seconds with stable atomic clocks. (The SI second, when adopted, was already a little shorter than the current value of the second of mean solar time.) The small difference accumulates over time, which leads to an increasing difference between our clock time (Universal Time) on the one hand, and International Atomic Time and ephemeris time on the other hand: see ΔT. This led to the introduction of the leap second in 1972 to compensate for differences in the bases for time standardization.

In addition to the effect of the ocean tides, there is also a tidal acceleration due to flexing of Earth&#x27;s crust, but this accounts for only about 4% of the total effect when expressed in terms of heat dissipation.

If other effects were ignored, tidal acceleration would continue until the rotational period of Earth matched the orbital period of the Moon. At that time, the Moon would always be overhead of a single fixed place on Earth. Such a situation already exists in the Pluto–Charon system. However, the slowdown of Earth&#x27;s rotation is not occurring fast enough for the rotation to lengthen to a month before other effects make this irrelevant: about 1 to 1.5 billion years from now, the continual increase of the Sun&#x27;s radiation will likely cause Earth&#x27;s oceans to vaporize, removing the bulk of the tidal friction and acceleration. Even without this, the slowdown to a month-long day would still not have been completed by 4.5 billion years from now when the Sun will probably evolve into a red giant and likely destroy both Earth and the Moon.

Tidal acceleration is one of the few examples in the dynamics of the Solar System of a so-called secular perturbation of an orbit, i.e. a perturbation that continuously increases with time and is not periodic. Up to a high order of approximation, mutual gravitational perturbations between major or minor planets only cause periodic variations in their orbits, that is, parameters oscillate between maximum and minimum values. The tidal effect gives rise to a quadratic term in the equations, which leads to unbounded growth. In the mathematical theories of the planetary orbits that form the basis of ephemerides, quadratic and higher order secular terms do occur, but these are mostly Taylor expansions of very long time periodic terms. The reason that tidal effects are different is that unlike distant gravitational perturbations, friction is an essential part of tidal acceleration, and leads to permanent loss of energy from the dynamic system in the form of heat. In other words, we do not have a Hamiltonian system here.

=== Angular momentum and energy ===
The gravitational torque between the Moon and the tidal bulge of Earth causes the Moon to be constantly promoted to a slightly higher orbit and Earth to be decelerated in its rotation. As in any physical process within an isolated system, total energy and angular momentum are conserved. Effectively, energy and angular momentum are transferred from the rotation of Earth to the orbital motion of the Moon (however, most of the energy lost by Earth (−3.78 TW) is converted to heat by frictional losses in the oceans and their interaction with the solid Earth, and only about 1/30th (+0.121 TW) is transferred to the Moon). The Moon moves farther away from Earth (+38.30±0.08 mm/yr), so its potential energy, which is still negative (in Earth&#x27;s gravity well), increases, i. e. becomes less negative. It stays in orbit, and from Kepler&#x27;s 3rd law it follows that its average angular velocity actually decreases, so the tidal action on the Moon actually causes an angular deceleration, i.e. a negative acceleration (−25.97±0.05&quot;/century2) of its rotation around Earth. The actual speed of the Moon also decreases. Although its kinetic energy decreases, its potential energy increases by a larger amount, i. e. Ep = -2Ec (Virial Theorem).

The rotational angular momentum of Earth decreases and consequently the length of the day increases. The &quot;net&quot; tide raised on Earth by the Moon is dragged ahead of the Moon by Earth&#x27;s much faster rotation. Tidal friction is required to drag and maintain the bulge ahead of the Moon, and it dissipates the excess energy of the exchange of rotational and orbital energy between Earth and the Moon as heat. If the friction and heat dissipation were not present, the Moon&#x27;s gravitational force on the tidal bulge would rapidly (within two days) bring the tide back into synchronization with the Moon, and the Moon would no longer recede. Most of the dissipation occurs in a turbulent bottom boundary layer in shallow seas such as the European Shelf around the British Isles, the Patagonian Shelf off Argentina, and the Bering Sea.

The dissipation of energy by tidal friction averages about 3.64 terawatts of the 3.78 terawatts extracted, of which 2.5 terawatts are from the principal M lunar component and the remainder from other components, both lunar and solar.

An &quot;equilibrium tidal bulge&quot; does not really exist on Earth because the continents do not allow this mathematical solution to take place. Oceanic tides actually rotate around the ocean basins as vast &quot;gyres&quot; around several &quot;amphidromic points&quot; where no tide exists. The Moon pulls on each individual undulation as Earth rotates—some undulations are ahead of the Moon, others are behind it, whereas still others are on either side. The &quot;bulges&quot; that actually do exist for the Moon to pull on (and which pull on the Moon) are the net result of integrating the actual undulations over all the world&#x27;s oceans.

=== Historical evidence ===
This mechanism has been working for 4.5 billion years, since oceans first formed on Earth, but less so at times when much or most of the water was ice. There is geological and paleontological evidence that Earth rotated faster and that the Moon was closer to Earth in the remote past. &quot;Tidal rhythmites&quot; are alternating layers of sand and silt laid down offshore from estuaries having great tidal flows. Daily, monthly and seasonal cycles can be found in the deposits. This geological record is consistent with these conditions 620 million years ago: the day was 21.9±0.4 hours, and there were 13.1±0.1 synodic months/year and 400±7 solar days/year. The average recession rate of the Moon between then and now has been 2.17±0.31 cm/year, which is about half the present rate. The present high rate may be due to near resonance between natural ocean frequencies and tidal frequencies.

Analysis of layering in fossil mollusc shells from 70 million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous period, shows that there were 372 days a year, and thus that the day was about 23.5 hours long then.

=== Quantitative description of the Earth–Moon case ===
The motion of the Moon can be followed with an accuracy of a few centimeters by lunar laser ranging (LLR). Laser pulses are bounced off corner-cube prism retroreflectors on the surface of the Moon, emplaced during the Apollo missions of 1969 to 1972 and by Lunokhod 1 in 1970 and Lunokhod 2 in 1973. Measuring the return time of the pulse yields a very accurate measure of the distance. These measurements are fitted to the equations of motion. This yields numerical values for the Moon&#x27;s secular deceleration, i.e. negative acceleration, in longitude and the rate of change of the semimajor axis of the Earth–Moon ellipse. From the period 1970–2015, the results are:

: −25.97 ± 0.05 arcsecond/century2 in ecliptic longitude
: +38.30 ± 0.08 mm/yr in the mean Earth–Moon distance

This is consistent with results from satellite laser ranging (SLR), a similar technique applied to artificial satellites orbiting Earth, which yields a model for the gravitational field of Earth, including that of the tides. The model accurately predicts the changes in the motion of the Moon.

Finally, ancient observations of solar eclipses give fairly accurate positions for the Moon at those moments. Studies of these observations give results consistent with the value quoted above.

The other consequence of tidal acceleration is the deceleration of the rotation of Earth. The rotation of Earth is somewhat erratic on all time scales (from hours to centuries) due to various causes. The small tidal effect cannot be observed in a short period, but the cumulative effect on Earth&#x27;s rotation as measured with a stable clock (ephemeris time, International Atomic Time) of a shortfall of even a few milliseconds every day becomes readily noticeable in a few centuries. Since some event in the remote past, more days and hours have passed (as measured in full rotations of Earth) (Universal Time) than would be measured by stable clocks calibrated to the present, longer length of the day (ephemeris time). This is known as ΔT. Recent values can be obtained from the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). A table of the actual length of the day in the past few centuries is also available.

From the observed change in the Moon&#x27;s orbit, the corresponding change in the length of the day can be computed (where &quot;cy&quot; means &quot;century&quot;, d day, s second, ms millisecond, 10−3 s, and ns nanosecond, 10−9 s):

: +2.4 ms/d/century or +88 s/cy2 or +66 ns/d2.

However, from historical records over the past 2700 years the following average value is found:

: +1.72 ± 0.03 ms/d/century or +63 s/cy2 or +47 ns/d2. (i.e. an accelerating cause is responsible for -0.7 ms/d/cy)

By twice integrating over the time, the corresponding cumulative value is a parabola having a coefficient of T2 (time in centuries squared) of (1/2) 63 s/cy2 :

: Δ&quot;T&quot; = (1/2) 63 s/cy2 T2 = +31 s/cy2 T2.

Opposing the tidal deceleration of Earth is a mechanism that is in fact accelerating the rotation. Earth is not a sphere, but rather an ellipsoid that is flattened at the poles. SLR has shown that this flattening is decreasing. The explanation is that during the ice age large masses of ice collected at the poles, and depressed the underlying rocks. The ice mass started disappearing over 10000 years ago, but Earth&#x27;s crust is still not in hydrostatic equilibrium and is still rebounding (the relaxation time is estimated to be about 4000 years). As a consequence, the polar diameter of Earth increases, and the equatorial diameter decreases (Earth&#x27;s volume must remain the same). This means that mass moves closer to the rotation axis of Earth, and that Earth&#x27;s moment of inertia decreases. This process alone leads to an increase of the rotation rate (phenomenon of a spinning figure skater who spins ever faster as they retract their arms). From the observed change in the moment of inertia the acceleration of rotation can be computed: the average value over the historical period must have been about −0.6 ms/d/century. This largely explains the historical observations.

== Other cases of tidal acceleration ==

Most natural satellites of the planets undergo tidal acceleration to some degree (usually small), except for the two classes of tidally decelerated bodies. In most cases, however, the effect is small enough that even after billions of years most satellites will not actually be lost. The effect is probably most pronounced for Mars&#x27;s second moon Deimos, which may become an Earth-crossing asteroid after it leaks out of Mars&#x27;s grip.
The effect also arises between different components in a binary star.

Moreover, this tidal effect isn&#x27;t solely limited to planetary satellites; it also manifests between different components within a binary star system. The gravitational interactions within such systems can induce tidal forces, leading to fascinating dynamics between the stars or their orbiting bodies, influencing their evolution and behavior over cosmic timescales.

== Tidal deceleration ==

This comes in two varieties:

Mercury and Venus are believed to have no satellites chiefly because any hypothetical satellite would have suffered deceleration long ago and crashed into the planets due to the very slow rotation speeds of both planets; in addition, Venus also has retrograde rotation.

<text>Timor (, , ) is an island at the southern end of Maritime Southeast Asia, in the north of the Timor Sea. The island is divided between the sovereign states of Timor-Leste in the eastern part and Indonesia in the western part. The Indonesian part, known as West Timor, constitutes part of the province of East Nusa Tenggara. Within West Timor lies an exclave of Timor-Leste called Oecusse District. The island covers an area of . The name is a variant of &quot;timur&quot;, Malay for &quot;east&quot;; it is so called because it lies at the eastern end of the Lesser Sunda Islands. Mainland Australia is less than 500 km away, separated by the Timor Sea.

== Language, ethnic groups and religion == 

Anthropologists identify eleven distinct ethno-linguistic groups in Timor. The largest are the Atoni of western Timor and the Tetum of central and eastern Timor. Most indigenous Timorese languages belong to the Timor–Babar branch of the Austronesian languages spoken throughout the Indonesian archipelago. Although lexical evidence is lacking, the non-Austronesian languages of Timor are thought to be related to languages spoken on Halmahera and in Western New Guinea. Some are so mixed that it is difficult to tell which family they descend from.

The official languages of Timor-Leste are Tetum and Portuguese, while in West Timor it is Indonesian, although Uab Meto is the local Atoni language spoken throughout Kupang, South Central Timur and North Central Timur Regencies. Indonesian, a standardized dialect of Malay, is also widely spoken and understood in Timor-Leste.

Christianity is the dominant religion throughout the island of Timor, at about 90% of the population. However, it is unequally distributed as West Timor is 58% Protestant and 37% Catholic, and Timor-Leste is 98% Catholic and 1% Protestant. Islam and animism make up most of the remainder at about 5% each across the island.

== Geography ==
Timor is located north of Australia and Oceania, and is one of the easternmost Sunda Islands. Together with Sumba, Babar and associated smaller islands, Timor forms the southern outer archipelago of the Lesser Sunda Islands with the inner islands of Flores, Alor and Wetar to the north, and beyond them Sulawesi. 

Timor is the principal island of the Outer Banda Arc, which is being uplifted by arc-continent collision with the Australian continent. Timor consists mostly of rocks from the Australian continental margin that are accreted to the Banda Arc. It occupies a forearc position in front of the active volcanic arc that forms the islands in the Flores region to the north. The orientation of the main axis of the island also differs from its neighbors. These features have been explained as the result of being on the northern edge of the Indo-Australian Plate as it meets the Eurasian Plate and pushes into Southeast Asia. The climate includes a long dry season (April-November) with hot winds blowing over from Australia. Rivers on the island include the North and South Laclo Rivers in Timor-Leste. The mountains, which reach up to nearly 3000m elevation are one of the most mature parts of the Banda Range, which stretches from Sumba to Seram. Mutis is the highest mountain in West Timor and Ramelau is the highest mountain in Timor Leste.

The largest towns on the island are the provincial capital of Kupang in West Timor, Indonesia and the Portuguese colonial towns of Dili the capital, and Baucau in Timor-Leste. Poor roads make transport to inland areas difficult, especially in Timor-Leste. Sources of revenue include gas and oil in the Timor Sea, coffee growing and tourism.

== Geology ==
Timor is an aerially exposed portion of the Banda Forearc formed by collision of Eurasian oceanic crust and continental crust of the Australian plate. This is a unique convergent margin where a thick continental margin is forced under thinner oceanic crust. The result is a large accretionary wedge of imbricated thrust sheets composed of Cretaceous and Tertiary distal material of the Australian continental margin thrust on top of Australian continental shelf deposits. Timor is well known for its structural complexity. Debate continues about the nature of deformation of continental crust. Some researchers advocate shallow thin-skinned deformation, while others favor shallow thin-skinned with some basement deformation.

Timor also has potential for significant petroleum development. Onshore and offshore exploration efforts have been attempted with varying success. Timor host dozens of natural oil and gas seeps with most exploration concentrated on the north end of the Island where oil seeps are prevalent. Carbon rich shales from the island have been found with TOC up to 23%. Such shales buried deep in the subsurface could act as high-quality source rocks. Jurassic marine shoreface and turbidite sands of the Plover and Militia Formations are proven reservoirs in the North Australian Shelf. Over pressured Upper Jurassic silt and mudstones shales may also provide adequate seals for hydrocarbons. Research focusing on the structure of deformed basement rocks provides insight into possible onshore and offshore structural and stratigraphic traps for future petroleum development.

=== West Timor ===

West Timor is part of the East Nusa Tenggara province. It was formerly split into the City of Kupang (a &quot;kabupaten&quot; or regency-level administrative area) and four regencies (kabupaten); from west to east these are: Kupang, Timor Tengah Selatan (South Central Timor), Timor Tengah Utara (North Central Timor) and Belu. However, a fifth regency – Malaka – was in 2012 formed from the southern half of Belu Regency. Note that the administrative area has shrunk as Rote Ndao Regency (Rote and Ndoa islands to the southwest) and Sabu Raijua Regency (the Savu Islands further west) were split off in 2002 and 2009 respectively from Kupang Regency. The island accounts for 35.5% of the provincial population.

=== Timor-Leste ===

Timor-Leste is divided into thirteen municipalities, which in turn are subdivided into 65 administrative posts, 442 &quot;sucos&quot; (villages), and 2,225 &quot;aldeias&quot; (hamlets).

== Flora and fauna ==

Timor and its offshore islands such as Atauro, a former place of exile increasingly known for its beaches and coral, as well as Jaco along with Wetar and the other Barat Daya Islands to the northeast constitute the Timor and Wetar deciduous forests ecoregion. The natural vegetation was tropical dry broadleaf forests with an undergrowth of shrubs and grasses supporting a rich wildlife. However much of the original forest has been cleared for farming, especially on the coasts of Timor and on the smaller islands like Atauro. Apart from one large block in the centre of Timor only patches remain. This ecoregion is part of the Wallacea area with a mixture of plants and animals of Asian and Australasian origin; it lies in the western part of Wallacea, in which Asian species predominate.

Many trees are deciduous or partly deciduous, dropping their leaves during the dry season, there are also evergreen and thorn trees in the woodland. Typical trees of the lowland slopes include &quot;Sterculia foetida&quot;, &quot;Calophyllum teysmannii&quot; and &quot;Aleurites moluccanus&quot;.

During the Pleistocene epoch, Timor was the abode of extinct giant monitor lizards similar to the Komodo dragon. Like Flores, Sumba and Sulawesi, Timor was also once a habitat of extinct dwarf stegodonts, relatives of elephants.

Fauna of today includes a number of endemic species such as the distinctive Timor shrew and Timor rat. The northern common cuscus, a marsupial of Australasian origin occurs as well, but is thought to be introduced. The island have a great number of birds, mainly of Asian origin with some of Australasian origin. There is a total of 250 species of which twenty four are endemic, due to the relative isolation of Timor, including five threatened species; the slaty cuckoo-dove, Wetar ground dove, Timor green pigeon, Timor imperial pigeon, and iris lorikeet.

Saltwater crocodiles are found in the wetlands whereas reticulated pythons can be found in forests and grasslands of Timor. However, the population sizes and status are unknown.

Frog species in Timor include &quot;Duttaphrynus melanostictus&quot;, &quot;Hoplobatrachus tigerinus&quot;, &quot;Limnonectes timorensis&quot;, &quot;Litoria everetti&quot;, and &quot;Polypedates leucomystax&quot;. A new species of microlyhid frog belonging to the genus &quot;Kaloula&quot; has also recently been discovered in Timor.

Late Cretaceous fossils of marine vertebrates are known from Timor-Leste deposits. These include mosasaurs such as &quot;Globidens timorensis&quot;, lamniforme sharks, coelacanths and the choristodere &quot;Champsosaurus&quot;.

== History ==

The earliest historical record about Timor island is the 13th-century Chinese &quot;Zhu Fan Zhi&quot;, where it is called &quot;Ti-wu&quot; and is noted for its sandalwood. Later on, in the 14th-century Javanese Nagarakretagama, Canto 14, &quot;Timur&quot; is identified as an island within Majapahit&#x27;s realm. Timor was incorporated into ancient Javanese, Chinese and Indian trading networks of the 14th century as an exporter of aromatic sandalwood, slaves, honey and wax, and was settled by both the Portuguese, in the end of the 16th century, and the Dutch, based in Kupang, in the mid-17th century.

As the nearest island with a European settlement at the time, Timor was the destination of William Bligh and seamen loyal to him following the infamous mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot; in 1789. It was also where survivors of the wrecked , sent to arrest the &quot;Bounty&quot; mutineers, landed in 1791 after that ship sank in the Great Barrier Reef.

The island has been politically divided in two parts for centuries. The Dutch and Portuguese fought for control of the island until it was divided by treaty in 1859, but they still did not formally resolve the matter of the boundary until 1912. West Timor, was known as Dutch Timor until 1949 when it became Indonesian Timor, a part of the nation of Indonesia which was formed from the old Netherlands East Indies; while East Timor was known as Portuguese Timor, a Portuguese colony until 1975. It includes the exclave of Oecussi-Ambeno in West Timor.

Although Portugal was neutral during World War II, in December 1941, Portuguese Timor was occupied by Australian and Dutch forces, which were expecting a Japanese invasion. This Australian military intervention dragged Portuguese Timor into the Pacific War but it also slowed the Japanese expansion. When the Japanese did occupy Timor, in February 1942, a 400-strong Dutch-Australian force and large numbers of Timorese volunteers engaged them in a one-year guerrilla campaign. After the allied evacuation in February 1943 the East Timorese continued fighting the Japanese, with comparatively little collaboration with the enemy taking place. This assistance cost the civilian population dearly: Japanese forces burned many villages and seized food supplies. The Japanese occupation resulted in the deaths of 40,000–70,000 Timorese.

Following the military coup in Portugal in 1974 the Portuguese began to withdraw from Timor. The subsequent internal unrest and fear of the communist Fretilin party led to an invasion by Indonesia, who opposed the concept of an independent East Timor. In 1975, East Timor was annexed by Indonesia and became known as &quot;Timor Timur&quot; or &#x27;Tim-Tim&#x27; for short. It was regarded by Indonesia as the country&#x27;s 27th province, but this was never recognised by the United Nations (UN) or Portugal.

The people of East Timor, through Falintil the military wing of Fretilin, resisted 35,000 Indonesian troops in a prolonged guerrilla campaign, but the whole island remained under Indonesian control until a referendum held in 1999 under a UN-sponsored agreement between Indonesia and Portugal in which its people rejected the offer of autonomy within Indonesia. The UN then temporarily governed East Timor until it became independent as Timor-Leste in 2002 under the presidency of Falintil leader Xanana Gusmão. Political strife continued, as the new nation coped with poverty. Nevertheless, the UN presence was much reduced.

A group of people on the Indonesian side of Timor have been reported active since 2001 trying to establish a Great Timor state. However, there is no real evidence that the people of West Timor, most of whom are ethnically Atoni, the traditional enemy of the East Timorese, have any interest in such a union. Furthermore, the current government of Timor-Leste recognizes the existing boundary.

<text>Tetracycline, sold under various brand names, is an antibiotic in the tetracyclines family of medications, used to treat a number of infections, including acne, cholera, brucellosis, plague, malaria, and syphilis. It is available in oral and topical formulations.
Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and loss of appetite. Other side effects include poor tooth development if used by children less than eight years of age, kidney problems, and sunburning easily. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. It works by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacteria.
Tetracycline was patented in 1953 and was approved for prescription use in 1954. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Tetracycline is available as a generic medication. Tetracycline was originally made from bacteria of the genus &quot;Streptomyces&quot;.

==Medical uses==

=== Spectrum of activity ===
Tetracyclines have a broad spectrum of antibiotic action. Originally, they possessed some level of bacteriostatic activity against almost all medically relevant aerobic and anaerobic bacterial genera, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, with a few exceptions, such as &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;Proteus&quot; spp., which display intrinsic resistance. However, acquired (as opposed to inherent) resistance has proliferated in many pathogenic organisms and greatly eroded the formerly vast versatility of this group of antibiotics. Resistance amongst &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; spp., &quot;Streptococcus&quot; spp., &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, anaerobes, members of the Enterobacteriaceae, and several other previously sensitive organisms is now quite common. Tetracyclines remain especially useful in the management of infections by certain obligately intracellular bacterial pathogens such as &quot;Chlamydia&quot;, &quot;Mycoplasma&quot;, and &quot;Rickettsia&quot;. They are also of value in spirochaetal infections, such as syphilis, and Lyme disease. Certain rare or exotic infections, including anthrax, plague, and brucellosis, are also susceptible to tetracyclines. Tetracycline tablets were used in the plague outbreak in India in 1994. Tetracycline is first-line therapy for Rocky Mountain spotted fever (&quot;Rickettsia&quot;), Lyme disease (&quot;B. burgdorferi&quot;), Q fever (&quot;Coxiella&quot;), psittacosis, &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;, and nasal carriage of meningococci.

It is also one of a group of antibiotics which together may be used to treat peptic ulcers caused by bacterial infections. The mechanism of action for the antibacterial effect of tetracyclines relies on disrupting protein translation in bacteria, thereby damaging the ability of microbes to grow and repair; however, protein translation is also disrupted in eukaryotic mitochondria leading to effects that may confound experimental results.

The following list presents MIC susceptibility data for some medically significant microorganisms:
* &quot;Escherichia coli:&quot; 1 / to &gt;128 μg/mL
* &quot;Shigella&quot; : 1 μg/mL to 128 μg/mL

===Anti-eukaryote use===
The tetracyclines also have activity against certain eukaryotic parasites, including those responsible for diseases such as dysentery caused by an amoeba, malaria (a plasmodium), and balantidiasis (a ciliate).

===Use as a biomarker===

Since tetracycline is absorbed into bone, it is used as a marker of bone growth for biopsies in humans. Tetracycline labeling is used to determine the amount of bone growth within a certain period of time, usually a period around 21 days. Tetracycline is incorporated into mineralizing bone and can be detected by its fluorescence. In &quot;double tetracycline labeling&quot;, a second dose is given 11–14 days after the first dose, and the amount of bone formed during that interval can be calculated by measuring the distance between the two fluorescent labels.

Tetracycline is also used as a biomarker in wildlife to detect consumption of medicine- or vaccine-containing baits.

== Side effects ==
Use of tetracycline antibiotics can:
* Discolor permanent teeth (yellow-gray-brown), from prenatal period through childhood and adulthood. Children receiving long- or short-term therapy with a tetracycline or glycylcycline may develop permanent brown discoloration of the teeth.
* Be inactivated by calcium ions, so are not to be taken with milk, yogurt, and other dairy products
* Be inactivated by aluminium, iron, and zinc ions, not to be taken at the same time as indigestion remedies (some common antacids and over-the-counter heartburn medicines)
* Cause skin photosensitivity, so exposure to the sun or intense light is not recommended
* Cause drug-induced lupus, and hepatitis
* Cause microvesicular fatty liver
* Cause tinnitus
* Cause epigastric pain
* Interfere with methotrexate by displacing it from the various protein-binding sites
* Cause breathing complications, as well as anaphylactic shock, in some individuals
* Affect bone growth of the fetus, so should be avoided during pregnancy
* Fanconi syndrome may result from ingesting expired tetracyclines.

Caution should be exercised in long-term use when breastfeeding. Short-term use is safe; bioavailability in milk is low to nil. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), cases of Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and erythema multiforme associated with doxycycline use have been reported, but a causative role has not been established.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Tetracycline inhibits protein synthesis by blocking the attachment of charged tRNA at the P site peptide chain. Tetracycline blocks the A-site so that a hydrogen bond is not formed between the amino acids. Tetracycline binds to the 30S and 50S subunit of microbial ribosomes. Thus, it prevents the formation of a peptide chain. The action is usually not inhibitory and irreversible even with the withdrawal of the drug. Mammalian cells are not vulnerable to the effect of Tetracycline as these cells contain no 30S ribosomal subunits so do not accumulate the drug. This accounts for the relatively small off-site effect of tetracycline on human cells.

===Mechanisms of resistance===
Bacteria usually acquire resistance to tetracycline from horizontal transfer of a gene that either encodes an efflux pump or a ribosomal protection protein. Efflux pumps actively eject tetracycline from the cell, preventing the build up of an inhibitory concentration of tetracycline in the cytoplasm. Ribosomal protection proteins interact with the ribosome and dislodge tetracycline from the ribosome, allowing for translation to continue.

== History ==

=== Discovery ===
The tetracyclines, a large family of antibiotics, were discovered by Benjamin Minge Duggar in 1948 as natural products, and first prescribed in 1948. Benjamin Duggar, working under Yellapragada Subbarow at Lederle Laboratories, discovered the first tetracycline antibiotic, chlortetracycline (Aureomycin), in 1945. The structure of Aureomycin was elucidated in 1952 and published in 1954 by the Pfizer-Woodward group. After the discovery of the structure, researchers at Pfizer began chemically modifying aureomycin by treating it with hydrogen in the presence of a palladized carbon catalyst. This chemical reaction replaced a chlorine moiety with a hydrogen, creating a compound named tetracycline via hydrogenolysis. Tetracycline displayed higher potency, better solubility, and more favorable pharmacology than the other antibiotics in its class, leading to its FDA approval in 1954. The new compound was one of the first commercially successful semi-synthetic antibiotics that was used, and laid the foundation for the development of Sancycline, Minocycline, and later the Glycylcyclines.

===Evidence in antiquity===
Tetracycline has a high affinity for calcium and is incorporated into bones during the active mineralization of hydroxyapatite. When incorporated into bones, tetracycline can be identified using ultraviolet light.

There is evidence that early inhabitants of Northeastern Africa consumed tetracycline antibiotics. Nubian mummies from between 350 and 550 A.D. were found to exhibit patterns of fluorescence identical with that of modern tetracycline labelled bone.

It is conjectured that the beer brewed by the Nubians was the source of the tetracycline found in these bones.

==Society and culture==

===Economics===
According to data from EvaluatePharma and published in the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, in the USA the price of tetracycline rose from $0.06 per 250-mg pill in 2013 to $4.06 a pill in 2015. The &quot;Globe&quot; described the &quot;big price hikes of some generic drugs&quot; as a &quot;relatively new phenomenon&quot; which has left most pharmacists &quot;grappling&quot; with large upswings&quot; in the &quot;costs of generics, with &#x27;overnight&#x27; price changes sometimes exceeding 1,000%.&quot;

===Brand names===
It is marketed under the brand names Sumycin, Tetracyn, and Panmycin, among others. Actisite is a thread-like fiber formulation used in dental applications.

It is also used to produce several semisynthetic derivatives, which together are known as the tetracycline antibiotics. The term &quot;tetracycline&quot; is also used to denote the four-ring system of this compound; &quot;tetracyclines&quot; are related substances that contain the same four-ring system.

===Media===
Due to the drug&#x27;s association with fighting infections, it serves as the main &quot;commodity&quot; in the science fiction series Aftermath, with the search for tetracycline becoming a major preoccupation in later episodes.

Tetracycline is also represented in Bohemia Interactive&#x27;s survival sandbox, DayZ. In the game, players may find the antibiotic to treat the common cold, influenza, cholera and infected wounds, but does not portray any side effects associated with tetracycline.

==Research==
===Genetic engineering===
In genetic engineering, tetracycline is used in transcriptional activation. It has been used as an engineered &quot;control switch&quot; in chronic myelogenous leukemia models in mice. Engineers were able to develop a retrovirus that induced a particular type of leukemia in mice, and could then &quot;switch&quot; the cancer on and off through tetracycline administration. This could be used to grow the cancer in mice and then halt it at a particular stage to allow for further experimentation or study.

A technique being developed for the control of the mosquito species &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; (the infection vector for yellow fever, dengue fever, Zika fever, and several other diseases) uses a strain that is genetically modified to require tetracycline to develop beyond the larval stage. Modified males raised in a laboratory develop normally as they are supplied with this chemical and can be released into the wild. Their subsequent offspring inherit this trait, but find no tetracycline in their environments, so never develop into adults.

<text>A transposable element (TE), also transposon, or jumping gene, is a type of mobile genetic element, a nucleic acid sequence in DNA that can change its position within a genome, sometimes creating or reversing mutations and altering the cell&#x27;s genetic identity and genome size.

Transposition often results in duplication of the same genetic material. The discovery of mobile genetic elements earned Barbara McClintock a Nobel Prize in 1983. Further research into transposons has potential for use in gene therapy, and the finding of new drug targets in personalized medicine. The vast number of variables in the transposon makes data analytics difficult but combined with other sequencing technologies significant advances may be made in the understanding and treatment of disease.

Transposable elements make up about half of the genome in a eukaryotic cell, accounting for much of human genetic diversity. Although TEs are selfish genetic elements, many are important in genome function and evolution. Transposons are also very useful to researchers as a means to alter DNA inside a living organism.

There are at least two classes of TEs: Class I TEs or retrotransposons generally function via reverse transcription, while Class II TEs or DNA transposons encode the protein transposase, which they require for insertion and excision, and some of these TEs also encode other proteins.

== Discovery by Barbara McClintock ==

Barbara McClintock discovered the first TEs in maize (&quot;Zea mays&quot;) at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. McClintock was experimenting with maize plants that had broken chromosomes.

In the winter of 1944–1945, McClintock planted corn kernels that were self-pollinated, meaning that the silk (style) of the flower received pollen from its own anther. These kernels came from a long line of plants that had been self-pollinated, causing broken arms on the end of their ninth chromosomes. As the maize plants began to grow, McClintock noted unusual color patterns on the leaves. For example, one leaf had two albino patches of almost identical size, located side by side on the leaf. McClintock hypothesized that during cell division certain cells lost genetic material, while others gained what they had lost. However, when comparing the chromosomes of the current generation of plants with the parent generation, she found certain parts of the chromosome had switched position. This refuted the popular genetic theory of the time that genes were fixed in their position on a chromosome. McClintock found that genes could not only move but they could also be turned on or off due to certain environmental conditions or during different stages of cell development.

McClintock also showed that gene mutations could be reversed. She presented her report on her findings in 1951, and published an article on her discoveries in &quot;Genetics&quot; in November 1953 entitled &quot;Induction of Instability at Selected Loci in Maize&quot;.

At the 1951 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium where she first publicized her findings, her talk was met with silence. Her work was largely dismissed and ignored until the late 1960s–1970s when, after TEs were found in bacteria, it was rediscovered. She was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1983 for her discovery of TEs, more than thirty years after her initial research.

== Classification ==

Transposable elements represent one of several types of mobile genetic elements. TEs are assigned to one of two classes according to their mechanism of transposition, which can be described as either &quot;copy and paste&quot; (Class I TEs) or &quot;cut and paste&quot; (Class II TEs).

=== Retrotransposon ===

Class I TEs are copied in two stages: first, they are transcribed from DNA to RNA, and the RNA produced is then reverse transcribed to DNA. This copied DNA is then inserted back into the genome at a new position. The reverse transcription step is catalyzed by a reverse transcriptase, which is often encoded by the TE itself. The characteristics of retrotransposons are similar to retroviruses, such as HIV.

Despite the potential negative effects of retrotransposons, like inserting itself into the middle of a necessary DNA sequence, which can render important genes unusable, they are still essential to keep a species&#x27; ribosomal DNA intact over the generations, preventing infertility.

Retrotransposons are commonly grouped into three main orders:
* Retrotransposons, with long terminal repeats (LTRs), which encode reverse transcriptase, similar to retroviruses
* Retroposons, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs, LINE-1s, or L1s), which encode reverse transcriptase but lack LTRs, and are transcribed by RNA polymerase II
* Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) do not encode reverse transcriptase and are transcribed by RNA polymerase III

Retroviruses can also be considered TEs. For example, after the conversion of retroviral RNA into DNA inside a host cell, the newly produced retroviral DNA is integrated into the genome of the host cell. These integrated DNAs are termed &quot;proviruses&quot;. The provirus is a specialized form of eukaryotic retrotransposon, which can produce RNA intermediates that may leave the host cell and infect other cells. The transposition cycle of retroviruses has similarities to that of prokaryotic TEs, suggesting a distant relationship between the two.

=== DNA transposons ===

The cut-and-paste transposition mechanism of class II TEs does not involve an RNA intermediate. The transpositions are catalyzed by several transposase enzymes. Some transposases non-specifically bind to any target site in DNA, whereas others bind to specific target sequences. The transposase makes a staggered cut at the target site producing sticky ends, cuts out the DNA transposon and ligates it into the target site. A DNA polymerase fills in the resulting gaps from the sticky ends and DNA ligase closes the sugar-phosphate backbone. This results in target site duplication and the insertion sites of DNA transposons may be identified by short direct repeats (a staggered cut in the target DNA filled by DNA polymerase) followed by inverted repeats (which are important for the TE excision by transposase).

Cut-and-paste TEs may be duplicated if their transposition takes place during S phase of the cell cycle, when a donor site has already been replicated but a target site has not yet been replicated. Such duplications at the target site can result in gene duplication, which plays an important role in genomic evolution.

Not all DNA transposons transpose through the cut-and-paste mechanism. In some cases, a replicative transposition is observed in which a transposon replicates itself to a new target site (e.g. helitron).

Class II TEs comprise less than 2% of the human genome, making the rest Class I.

=== Autonomous and non-autonomous ===
Transposition can be classified as either &quot;autonomous&quot; or &quot;non-autonomous&quot; in both Class I and Class II TEs. Autonomous TEs can move by themselves, whereas non-autonomous TEs require the presence of another TE to move. This is often because dependent TEs lack transposase (for Class II) or reverse transcriptase (for Class I).

Activator element (&quot;Ac&quot;) is an example of an autonomous TE, and dissociation elements (&quot;Ds&quot;) is an example of a non-autonomous TE. Without &quot;Ac,&quot; &quot;Ds&quot; is not able to transpose.

=== Class III ===
Some researchers also identify a third class of transposable elements, which has been described as &quot;a grab-bag consisting of transposons that don&#x27;t clearly fit into the other two categories&quot;. Examples of such TEs are the Foldback (FB) elements of &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, the TU elements of &quot;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus&quot;, and Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Elements.

== Distribution ==
Approximately 64% of the maize genome is made up of TEs, as is 44% of the human genome, and almost half of murine genomes.
New discoveries of transposable elements have shown the exact distribution of TEs with respect to their transcription start sites (TSSs) and enhancers. A recent study found that a promoter contains 25% of regions that harbor TEs. It is known that older TEs are not found in TSS locations because TEs frequency starts as a function once there is a distance from the TSS. A possible theory for this is that TEs might interfere with the transcription pausing or the first-intro splicing. Also as mentioned before, the presence of TEs closed by the TSS locations is correlated to their evolutionary age (number of different mutations that TEs can develop during the time).

== Examples ==

* The first TEs were discovered in maize (&quot;Zea mays&quot;) by Barbara McClintock in 1948, for which she was later awarded a Nobel Prize. She noticed chromosomal insertions, deletions, and translocations caused by these elements. These changes in the genome could, for example, lead to a change in the color of corn kernels. About 64% of the maize genome consists of TEs. The Ac/Ds system described by McClintock are Class II TEs. Transposition of Ac in tobacco has been demonstrated by B. Baker.
* In the pond microorganism, &quot;Oxytricha&quot;, TEs play such a critical role that when removed, the organism fails to develop.
* One family of TEs in the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; are called &quot;P elements&quot;. They seem to have first appeared in the species only in the middle of the twentieth century; within the last 50 years, they spread through every population of the species. Gerald M. Rubin and Allan C. Spradling pioneered technology to use artificial P elements to insert genes into &quot;Drosophila&quot; by injecting the embryo.
* In bacteria, TEs usually carry an additional gene for functions other than transposition, often for antibiotic resistance. In bacteria, transposons can jump from chromosomal DNA to plasmid DNA and back, allowing for the transfer and permanent addition of genes such as those encoding antibiotic resistance (multi-antibiotic resistant bacterial strains can be generated in this way). Bacterial transposons of this type belong to the Tn family. When the transposable elements lack additional genes, they are known as insertion sequences.
* In humans, the most common TE is the Alu sequence. It is approximately 300 bases long and can be found between 300,000 and one million times in the human genome. Alu alone is estimated to make up 15–17% of the human genome.
* Mariner-like elements are another prominent class of transposons found in multiple species, including humans. The Mariner transposon was first discovered by Jacobson and Hartl in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. This Class II transposable element is known for its uncanny ability to be transmitted horizontally in many species. There are an estimated 14,000 copies of Mariner in the human genome comprising 2.6 million base pairs. The first mariner-element transposons outside of animals were found in &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;.
* Mu phage transposition is the best-known example of replicative transposition.
* In Yeast genomes (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;) there are five distinct retrotransposon families: Ty1, Ty2, Ty3, Ty4 and Ty5.
* A helitron is a TE found in eukaryotes that is thought to replicate by a rolling-circle mechanism.
* In human embryos, two types of transposons combined to form noncoding RNA that catalyzes the development of stem cells. During the early stages of a fetus&#x27;s growth, the embryo&#x27;s inner cell mass expands as these stem cells enumerate. The increase of this type of cells is crucial, since stem cells later change form and give rise to all the cells in the body. 
* In peppered moths, a transposon in a gene called cortex caused the moths&#x27; wings to turn completely black. This change in coloration helped moths to blend in with ash and soot-covered areas during the Industrial Revolution.
* &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; carries a large and diverse number of TEs. This analysis by Matthews et al. 2018 also suggests this is common to all mosquitoes.

== Negative effects ==
Transposons have coexisted with eukaryotes for thousands of years and through their coexistence have become integrated in many organisms&#x27; genomes. Colloquially known as &#x27;jumping genes&#x27;, transposons can move within and between genomes allowing for this integration.

While there are many positive effects of transposons in their host eukaryotic genomes, there are some instances of mutagenic effects that TEs have on genomes leading to disease and malignant genetic alterations.

=== Mechanisms of mutagenesis ===
TEs are mutagens and due to the contribution to the formation of new cis-regulatory DNA elements that are connected to many transcription factors that are found in living cells; TEs can undergo many evolutionary mutations and alterations. These are often the causes of genetic disease, and gives the potential lethal effects of ectopic expression.

TEs can damage the genome of their host cell in different ways:

* A transposon or a retrotransposon that inserts itself into a functional gene can disable that gene.
* After a DNA transposon leaves a gene, the resulting gap may not be repaired correctly.
* Multiple copies of the same sequence, such as Alu sequences, can hinder precise chromosomal pairing during mitosis and meiosis, resulting in unequal crossovers, one of the main reasons for chromosome duplication.

TEs use a number of different mechanisms to cause genetic instability and disease in their host genomes.

* Expression of disease-causing, damaging proteins that inhibit normal cellular function.
** Many TEs contain promoters which drive transcription of their own transposase. These promoters can cause aberrant expression of linked genes, causing disease or mutant phenotypes.

== Diseases ==
Diseases often caused by TEs include

* Hemophilia A and B
** LINE1 (L1) TEs that land on the human Factor VIII have been shown to cause haemophilia
* Severe combined immunodeficiency
** Insertion of L1 into the APC gene causes colon cancer, confirming that TEs play an important role in disease development.
* Porphyria
**Insertion of Alu element into the PBGD gene leads to interference with the coding region and leads to acute intermittent porphyria (AIP).
* Predisposition to cancer
**LINE1(L1) TE&#x27;s and other retrotransposons have been linked to cancer because they cause genomic instability.
* Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
**Caused by SVA transposable element insertion in the fukutin (FKTN) gene which renders the gene inactive.
* Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease and other Tauopathies
** Transposable element dysregulation can cause neuronal death, leading to neurodegenerative disorders

== Rate of transposition, induction and defense ==
One study estimated the rate of transposition of a particular retrotransposon, the Ty1 element in &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;. Using several assumptions, the rate of successful transposition event per single Ty1 element came out to be about once every few months to once every few years. Some TEs contain heat-shock like promoters and their rate of transposition increases if the cell is subjected to stress, thus increasing the mutation rate under these conditions, which might be beneficial to the cell.

Cells defend against the proliferation of TEs in a number of ways. These include piRNAs and siRNAs, which silence TEs after they have been transcribed.

If organisms are mostly composed of TEs, one might assume that disease caused by misplaced TEs is very common, but in most cases TEs are silenced through epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling and piRNA, such that little to no phenotypic effects nor movements of TEs occur as in some wild-type plant TEs. Certain mutated plants have been found to have defects in methylation-related enzymes (methyl transferase) which cause the transcription of TEs, thus affecting the phenotype.

One hypothesis suggests that only approximately 100 LINE1 related sequences are active, despite their sequences making up 17% of the human genome. In human cells, silencing of LINE1 sequences is triggered by an RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism. Surprisingly, the RNAi sequences are derived from the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the LINE1, a long terminal which repeats itself. Supposedly, the 5′ LINE1 UTR that codes for the sense promoter for LINE1 transcription also encodes the antisense promoter for the miRNA that becomes the substrate for siRNA production. Inhibition of the RNAi silencing mechanism in this region showed an increase in LINE1 transcription.

== Evolution ==

TEs are found in almost all life forms, and the scientific community is still exploring their evolution and their effect on genome evolution. It is unclear whether TEs originated in the last universal common ancestor, arose independently multiple times, or arose once and then spread to other kingdoms by horizontal gene transfer. While some TEs confer benefits on their hosts, most are regarded as selfish DNA parasites. In this way, they are similar to viruses. Various viruses and TEs also share features in their genome structures and biochemical abilities, leading to speculation that they share a common ancestor.

Because excessive TE activity can damage exons, many organisms have acquired mechanisms to inhibit their activity. Bacteria may undergo high rates of gene deletion as part of a mechanism to remove TEs and viruses from their genomes, while eukaryotic organisms typically use RNA interference to inhibit TE activity. Nevertheless, some TEs generate large families often associated with speciation events. Evolution often deactivates DNA transposons, leaving them as introns (inactive gene sequences). In vertebrate animal cells, nearly all 100,000+ DNA transposons per genome have genes that encode inactive transposase polypeptides. The first synthetic transposon designed for use in vertebrate (including human) cells, the Sleeping Beauty transposon system, is a Tc1/mariner-like transposon. Its dead (&quot;fossil&quot;) versions are spread widely in the salmonid genome and a functional version was engineered by comparing those versions. Human Tc1-like transposons are divided into Hsmar1 and Hsmar2 subfamilies. Although both types are inactive, one copy of Hsmar1 found in the SETMAR gene is under selection as it provides DNA-binding for the histone-modifying protein. Many other human genes are similarly derived from transposons. Hsmar2 has been reconstructed multiple times from the fossil sequences.

The frequency and location of TE integrations influence genomic structure and evolution and affect gene and protein regulatory networks during development and in differentiated cell types. Large quantities of TEs within genomes may still present evolutionary advantages, however. Interspersed repeats within genomes are created by transposition events accumulating over evolutionary time. Because interspersed repeats block gene conversion, they protect novel gene sequences from being overwritten by similar gene sequences and thereby facilitate the development of new genes. TEs may also have been co-opted by the vertebrate immune system as a means of producing antibody diversity. The V(D)J recombination system operates by a mechanism similar to that of some TEs. TEs also serve to generate repeating sequences that can form dsRNA to act as a substrate for the action of ADAR in RNA editing.

TEs can contain many types of genes, including those conferring antibiotic resistance and the ability to transpose to conjugative plasmids. Some TEs also contain integrons, genetic elements that can capture and express genes from other sources. These contain integrase, which can integrate gene cassettes. There are over 40 antibiotic resistance genes identified on cassettes, as well as virulence genes.

Transposons do not always excise their elements precisely, sometimes removing the adjacent base pairs; this phenomenon is called exon shuffling. Shuffling two unrelated exons can create a novel gene product or, more likely, an intron.

Some non-autonomous DNA TEs found in plants can capture coding DNA from genes and shuffle them across the genome. This process can duplicate genes in the genome (a phenomenon called transduplication), and can contribute to generate novel genes by exon shuffling.

=== Evolutionary drive for TEs on the genomic context ===
There is a hypothesis that states that TEs might provide a ready source of DNA that could be co-opted by the cell to help regulate gene expression. Research showed that many diverse modes of TEs co-evolution along with some transcription factors targeting TE-associated genomic elements and chromatin are evolving from TE sequences. Most of the time, these particular modes do not follow the simple model of TEs and regulating host gene expression.

== Applications ==
Transposable elements can be harnessed in laboratory and research settings to study genomes of organisms and even engineer genetic sequences. The use of transposable elements can be split into two categories: for genetic engineering and as a genetic tool.

=== Genetic engineering ===

* Insertional mutagenesis uses the features of a TE to insert a sequence. In most cases, this is used to remove a DNA sequence or cause a frameshift mutation.
** In some cases the insertion of a TE into a gene can disrupt that gene&#x27;s function in a reversible manner where transposase-mediated excision of the DNA transposon restores gene function.
** This produces plants in which neighboring cells have different genotypes.
** This feature allows researchers to distinguish between genes that must be present inside of a cell in order to function (cell-autonomous) and genes that produce observable effects in cells other than those where the gene is expressed.

=== Genetic tool ===
In addition to the qualities mentioned for Genetic engineering, a Genetic tool also:-
* Used for analysis of gene expression and protein functioning in signature-tagging mutagenesis.
** This analytical tool allows researchers the ability to determine phenotypic expression of gene sequences. Also, this analytic technique mutates the desired locus of interest so that the phenotypes of the original and the mutated gene can be compared.

=== Specific applications ===

* TEs are also a widely used tool for mutagenesis of most experimentally tractable organisms. The Sleeping Beauty transposon system has been used extensively as an insertional tag for identifying cancer genes.
* The Tc1/mariner-class of TEs Sleeping Beauty transposon system, awarded Molecule of the Year in 2009, is active in mammalian cells and is being investigated for use in human gene therapy.
* TEs are used for the reconstruction of phylogenies by the means of presence/absence analyses. Transposons can act as biological mutagen in bacteria.
* Common organisms which the use of Transposons has been well developed are:
**&quot;Drosophila&quot;
** &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;
** &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;

== &quot;De novo&quot; repeat identification ==

&quot;De novo&quot; repeat identification is an initial scan of sequence data that seeks to find the repetitive regions of the genome, and to classify these repeats. Many computer programs exist to perform &quot;de novo&quot; repeat identification, all operating under the same general principles. As short tandem repeats are generally 1–6 base pairs in length and are often consecutive, their identification is relatively simple. Dispersed repetitive elements, on the other hand, are more challenging to identify, due to the fact that they are longer and have often acquired mutations. However, it is important to identify these repeats as they are often found to be transposable elements (TEs).

&quot;De novo&quot; identification of transposons involves three steps: 1) find all repeats within the genome, 2) build a consensus of each family of sequences, and 3) classify these repeats. There are three groups of algorithms for the first step. One group is referred to as the k-mer approach, where a k-mer is a sequence of length k. In this approach, the genome is scanned for overrepresented k-mers; that is, k-mers that occur more often than is likely based on probability alone. The length k is determined by the type of transposon being searched for. The k-mer approach also allows mismatches, the number of which is determined by the analyst. Some k-mer approach programs use the k-mer as a base, and extend both ends of each repeated k-mer until there is no more similarity between them, indicating the ends of the repeats. Another group of algorithms employs a method called sequence self-comparison. Sequence self-comparison programs use databases such as AB-BLAST to conduct an initial sequence alignment. As these programs find groups of elements that partially overlap, they are useful for finding highly diverged transposons, or transposons with only a small region copied into other parts of the genome. Another group of algorithms follows the periodicity approach. These algorithms perform a Fourier transformation on the sequence data, identifying periodicities, regions that are repeated periodically, and are able to use peaks in the resultant spectrum to find candidate repetitive elements. This method works best for tandem repeats, but can be used for dispersed repeats as well. However, it is a slow process, making it an unlikely choice for genome-scale analysis.

The second step of &quot;de novo&quot; repeat identification involves building a consensus of each family of sequences. A consensus sequence is a sequence that is created based on the repeats that comprise a TE family. A base pair in a consensus is the one that occurred most often in the sequences being compared to make the consensus. For example, in a family of 50 repeats where 42 have a T base pair in the same position, the consensus sequence would have a T at this position as well, as the base pair is representative of the family as a whole at that particular position, and is most likely the base pair found in the family&#x27;s ancestor at that position. Once a consensus sequence has been made for each family, it is then possible to move on to further analysis, such as TE classification and genome masking in order to quantify the overall TE content of the genome.

== Adaptive TEs ==

Transposable elements have been recognized as good candidates for stimulating gene adaptation, through their ability to regulate the expression levels of nearby genes. Combined with their &quot;mobility&quot;, transposable elements can be relocated adjacent to their targeted genes, and control the expression levels of the gene, dependent upon the circumstances.

The study conducted in 2008, &quot;High Rate of Recent Transposable Element–Induced Adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, used &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; that had recently migrated from Africa to other parts of the world, as a basis for studying adaptations caused by transposable elements. Although most of the TEs were located on introns, the experiment showed a significant difference in gene expressions between the population in Africa and other parts of the world. The four TEs that caused the selective sweep were more prevalent in &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; from temperate climates, leading the researchers to conclude that the selective pressures of the climate prompted genetic adaptation. From this experiment, it has been confirmed that adaptive TEs are prevalent in nature, by enabling organisms to adapt gene expression as a result of new selective pressures.

However, not all effects of adaptive TEs are beneficial to the population. In the research conducted in 2009, &quot;A Recent Adaptive Transposable Element Insertion Near Highly Conserved Developmental Loci in Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, a TE, inserted between Jheh 2 and Jheh 3, revealed a downgrade in the expression level of both of the genes. Downregulation of such genes has caused &quot;Drosophila&quot; to exhibit extended developmental time and reduced egg to adult viability. Although this adaptation was observed in high frequency in all non-African populations, it was not fixed in any of them. This is not hard to believe, since it is logical for a population to favor higher egg to adult viability, therefore trying to purge the trait caused by this specific TE adaptation.

At the same time, there have been several reports showing the advantageous adaptation caused by TEs. In the research done with silkworms, &quot;An Adaptive Transposable Element insertion in the Regulatory Region of the EO Gene in the Domesticated Silkworm&quot;, a TE insertion was observed in the cis-regulatory region of the EO gene, which regulates molting hormone 20E, and enhanced expression was recorded. While populations without the TE insert are often unable to effectively regulate hormone 20E under starvation conditions, those with the insert had a more stable development, which resulted in higher developmental uniformity.

These three experiments all demonstrated different ways in which TE insertions can be advantageous or disadvantageous, through means of regulating the expression level of adjacent genes. The field of adaptive TE research is still under development and more findings can be expected in the future.

== TEs participates in gene control networks ==
Recent studies have confirmed that TEs can contribute to the generation of transcription factors. However, how this process of contribution can have an impact on the participation of genome control networks. TEs are more common in many regions of the DNA and it makes up 45% of total human DNA. Also, TEs contributed to 16% of transcription factor binding sites. A larger number of motifs are also found in non-TE-derived DNA, and the number is larger than TE-derived DNA. All these factors correlate to the direct participation of TEs in many ways of gene control networks.

<text>Trypsin is an enzyme in the first section of the small intestine that starts the digestion of protein molecules by cutting long chains of amino acids into smaller pieces. It is a serine protease from the PA clan superfamily, found in the digestive system of many vertebrates, where it hydrolyzes proteins. Trypsin is formed in the small intestine when its proenzyme form, the trypsinogen produced by the pancreas, is activated. Trypsin cuts peptide chains mainly at the carboxyl side of the amino acids lysine or arginine. It is used for numerous biotechnological processes. The process is commonly referred to as trypsinogen proteolysis or trypsinization, and proteins that have been digested/treated with trypsin are said to have been trypsinized.

Trypsin was discovered in 1876 by Wilhelm Kühne. Although many sources say that Kühne named trypsin from the Ancient Greek word for rubbing, &#x27;tripsis&#x27;, because the enzyme was first isolated by rubbing the pancreas with glass powder and alcohol, in fact Kühne named trypsin from the Ancient Greek word &#x27;thrýpto&#x27; which means &#x27;I break&#x27; or &#x27;I break apart&#x27;.

== Function ==

In the duodenum, trypsin catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, breaking down proteins into smaller peptides. The peptide products are then further hydrolyzed into amino acids via other proteases, rendering them available for absorption into the blood stream. Tryptic digestion is a necessary step in protein absorption, as proteins are generally too large to be absorbed through the lining of the small intestine.

Trypsin is produced as the inactive zymogen trypsinogen in the pancreas. When the pancreas is stimulated by cholecystokinin, it is then secreted into the first part of the small intestine (the duodenum) via the pancreatic duct. Once in the small intestine, the enzyme enterokinase (also called enteropeptidase) activates trypsinogen into trypsin by proteolytic cleavage. The trypsin then activates additional trypsin, chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase.

== Mechanism ==
The enzymatic mechanism is similar to that of other serine proteases. These enzymes contain a catalytic triad consisting of histidine-57, aspartate-102, and serine-195. This catalytic triad was formerly called a charge relay system, implying the abstraction of protons from serine to histidine and from histidine to aspartate, but owing to evidence provided by NMR that the resultant alkoxide form of serine would have a much stronger pull on the proton than does the imidazole ring of histidine, current thinking holds instead that serine and histidine each have effectively equal share of the proton, forming short low-barrier hydrogen bonds therewith. By these means, the nucleophilicity of the active site serine is increased, facilitating its attack on the amide carbon during proteolysis. The enzymatic reaction that trypsin catalyzes is thermodynamically favorable, but requires significant activation energy (it is &quot;kinetically unfavorable&quot;). In addition, trypsin contains an &quot;oxyanion hole&quot; formed by the backbone amide hydrogen atoms of Gly-193 and Ser-195, which through hydrogen bonding stabilize the negative charge which accumulates on the amide oxygen after nucleophilic attack on the planar amide carbon by the serine oxygen causes that carbon to assume a tetrahedral geometry. Such stabilization of this tetrahedral intermediate helps to reduce the energy barrier of its formation and is concomitant with a lowering of the free energy of the transition state. Preferential binding of the transition state is a key feature of enzyme chemistry.

The negative aspartate residue (Asp 189) located in the catalytic pocket (S1) of trypsin is responsible for attracting and stabilizing positively charged lysine and/or arginine, and is, thus, responsible for the specificity of the enzyme. This means that trypsin predominantly cleaves proteins at the carboxyl side (or &quot;C-terminal side&quot;) of the amino acids lysine and arginine except when either is bound to a C-terminal proline, although large-scale mass spectrometry data suggest cleavage occurs even with proline. Trypsin is considered an endopeptidase, i.e., the cleavage occurs within the polypeptide chain rather than at the terminal amino acids located at the ends of polypeptides.

== Properties ==
Human trypsin has an optimal operating temperature of about 37 °C. In contrast, the Atlantic cod has several types of trypsins for the poikilotherm fish to survive at different body temperatures. Cod trypsins include trypsin I with an activity range of and maximal activity at , as well as trypsin Y with a range of and a maximal activity at .

As a protein, trypsin has various molecular weights depending on the source. For example, a molecular weight of 23.3 kDa is reported for trypsin from bovine and porcine sources.

The activity of trypsin is not affected by the enzyme inhibitor tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, TPCK, which deactivates chymotrypsin.

Trypsin should be stored at very cold temperatures (between −20 and −80 °C) to prevent autolysis, which may also be impeded by storage of trypsin at pH 3 or by using trypsin modified by reductive methylation. When the pH is adjusted back to pH 8, activity returns.

== Isozymes ==

These human genes encode proteins with trypsin enzymatic activity:

Other isoforms of trypsin may also be found in other organisms.

== Clinical significance ==

Activation of trypsin from proteolytic cleavage of trypsinogen in the pancreas can lead to a series of events that cause pancreatic self-digestion, resulting in pancreatitis. One consequence of the autosomal recessive disease cystic fibrosis is a deficiency in transport of trypsin and other digestive enzymes from the pancreas. This leads to the disorder termed meconium ileus, which involves intestinal obstruction (ileus) due to overly thick meconium, which is normally broken down by trypsin and other proteases, then passed in feces.

==Applications==
Trypsin is available in high quantity in pancreases, and can be purified rather easily. Hence, it has been used widely in various biotechnological processes.

In a tissue culture lab, trypsin is used to resuspend cells adherent to the cell culture dish wall during the process of harvesting cells. Some cell types adhere to the sides and bottom of a dish when cultivated &quot;in vitro&quot;. Trypsin is used to cleave proteins holding the cultured cells to the dish, so that the cells can be removed from the plates.

Trypsin can also be used to dissociate dissected cells (for example, prior to cell fixing and sorting).

Trypsin can be used to break down casein in breast milk. If trypsin is added to a solution of milk powder, the breakdown of casein causes the milk to become translucent. The rate of reaction can be measured by using the amount of time needed for the milk to turn translucent.

Trypsin is commonly used in biological research during proteomics experiments to digest proteins into peptides for mass spectrometry analysis, e.g. in-gel digestion. Trypsin is particularly suited for this, since it has a very well defined specificity, as it hydrolyzes only the peptide bonds in which the carbonyl group is contributed either by an arginine or lysine residue.

Trypsin can also be used to dissolve blood clots in its microbial form and treat inflammation in its pancreatic form.

In veterinary medicine, trypsin is an ingredient in wound spray products, such as Debrisol, to dissolve dead tissue and pus in wounds in horses, cattle, dogs, and cats.

In India, Trypsin - Chymotrypsin is widely prescribed for inflammation reduction during laryngitis and surgery recovery. Use outside India is not well documented and most papers written on its effectivity in the aforementioned situations have been funded by Torrent Pharmaceuticals which is one major brand that makes these tablets in India.
=== In food ===
Commercial protease preparations usually consist of a mixture of various protease enzymes that often includes trypsin. These preparations are widely used in food processing:
* as a baking enzyme to improve the workability of dough
* in the extraction of seasonings and flavorings from vegetable or animal proteins and in the manufacture of sauces 
* to control aroma formation in cheese and milk products 
* to improve the texture of fish products 
* to tenderize meat 
* during cold stabilization of beer 
* in the production of hypoallergenic food where proteases break down specific allergenic proteins into nonallergenic peptides, for example, proteases are used to produce hypoallergenic baby food from cow&#x27;s milk, thereby diminishing the risk of babies developing milk allergies.

==Trypsin inhibitor==

To prevent the action of active trypsin in the pancreas, which can be highly damaging, inhibitors such as BPTI and SPINK1 in the pancreas and α1-antitrypsin in the serum are present as part of the defense against its inappropriate activation. Any trypsin prematurely formed from the inactive trypsinogen is then bound by the inhibitor. The protein-protein interaction between trypsin and its inhibitors is one of the tightest bound, and trypsin is bound by some of its pancreatic inhibitors nearly irreversibly. In contrast with nearly all known protein assemblies, some complexes of trypsin bound by its inhibitors do not readily dissociate after treatment with 8M urea.

Trypsin inhibitors can serve as tools when addressing metabolic and obesity disorders. Metabolic disorders, obesity, and being overweight are known to increase non-communicable chronic disease prevalence. It is of public health policy interest to explore various ways to mitigate this occurrence including use of trypsin inhibitors. These inhibitors have capabilities of reducing colon, breast, skin, and prostate cancer by way of radioprotective and anticarcinogenic activity. Trypsin inhibitors can act as regulatory mechanisms to control release of neutrophil proteases and avoid significant tissue damage. In regards to cardiovascular conditions associated with unproductive serine protease activity, trypsin inhibitors can block their activity in platelet aggregation, fibrinolysis, coagulation, and blood coagulation.

The multifunctionality of trypsin inhibitors includes being potential protease inhibitors for AMP activity. While the antibacterial action mechanisms of trypsin inhibitors are unclear, studies have aimed to study their mechanisms as potential applications in bacterial infection treatments. Research and scanning microscopy showed antibacterial effects on bacterial membranes from &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. Trypsin inhibitors from amphibian skin showed bacterial death promotion that affected the cell wall and membrane of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. Studies also analyzed antibacterial actions in trypsin inhibitor peptides, proteins, and &quot;E. coli&quot;. The results showed sufficient bacterial growth prevention. However, trypsin inhibitors have to meet certain criteria to be utilized in foods and medical treatments.

==Trypsin alternatives==

Trypsin digestion of extra cellular matrix is a common practice in cell culture. However, this enzymatic degradation of the cells can negatively effect cell viability and surface markers, especially in stem cells. There are gentler alternatives than trypsin such as Accutase which doesn&#x27;t effect surface markers such as cd14, cd117, cd49f, cd292. However Accutase decreases the surface levels of FasL and Fas receptor on macrophages, these receptors are associated with cell cytotoxicity in the immune system and can also facilitate apoptosis-related cell death.

ProAlanase could also serve as an alternative to Trypsin in proteomic applications. ProAlanase is an &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; fungus protease that can achieve high proteolytic activity and specificity for digestion under the correct conditions. ProAnalase, the acidic prolyl-endopeptidase protease, previously studied as An-PEP, has been observed in various experiments to define its specificity. ProAnalase performed optimally in LC-MS applications with short digestion times and highly acidic pH.
