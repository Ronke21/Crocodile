<text>Robert Edward Turner III (born November 19, 1938) is an American entrepreneur, television producer, media proprietor, and philanthropist. He founded the Cable News Network (CNN), the first 24-hour cable news channel. In addition, he founded WTBS, which pioneered the superstation concept in cable television, as well as television networks TBS and TNT.

As a philanthropist, he gave $1 billion to create the United Nations Foundation, a public charity to broaden U.S. support for the United Nations. Turner serves as Chairman of the United Nations Foundation board of directors. Additionally, in 2001, Turner co-founded the Nuclear Threat Initiative with US Senator Sam Nunn (D-GA). NTI is a non-partisan organization dedicated to reducing global reliance on, and preventing the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. He currently serves as co-chairman of the board of directors.

Turner&#x27;s media empire began with his father&#x27;s billboard business, Turner Outdoor Advertising, which he took over in March 1963 after his father&#x27;s suicide. It was worth $1 million. His purchase of an Atlanta UHF station in 1970 began the Turner Broadcasting System. In 1980 he founded CNN, now one of the most prominent news networks in the world. Turner turned the Atlanta Braves baseball team into a nationally popular franchise (including winning the 1995 World Series under his ownership), and launched the charitable Goodwill Games. He helped revive interest in professional wrestling by purchasing Jim Crockett Promotions which was then rebranded as World Championship Wrestling (WCW).

Turner&#x27;s penchant for controversial statements earned him the nicknames &quot;The Mouth of the South&quot; and &quot;Captain Outrageous&quot;. Turner has also devoted his assets to environmental causes. He was the largest private landowner in the United States until John C. Malone surpassed him in 2011. He uses much of his land for ranches to re-popularize bison meat (for his Ted&#x27;s Montana Grill chain) and has amassed the largest herd in the world. He also created the environmental-themed animated series &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot;.

== Early life ==
Turner was born on November 19, 1938, in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Florence (née Rooney) and Robert Edward Turner II, a billboard magnate. When he was nine, his family moved to Savannah, Georgia, and raised him as an Episcopalian. He attended The McCallie School, a private boys&#x27; preparatory school in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Turner attended Brown University and was vice-president of the Brown Debating Union and captain of the sailing team. He became a member of Kappa Sigma. Turner initially majored in classics. His father wrote saying that this choice made him &quot;appalled, even horrified&quot;, and that he &quot;almost puked&quot;. Turner later changed his major to economics, but before receiving a degree, he was expelled for having a female student in his dormitory room. Turner was awarded an honorary B.A. from Brown University in November 1989 when he returned to campus to give the keynote address for the National Association of College Broadcasters second annual conference.

Expelled from Brown just as tensions in Vietnam were beginning to heat up, Turner joined the United States Coast Guard Reserve in order to fill his service obligation before he ended up getting drafted. Honored by the United States Navy Memorial with its Lone Sailor Award in 2013, Turner told &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;I liked boats&quot;, and ended up getting &quot;deployed to some pretty sweet places – Charleston and Fort Lauderdale.&quot;

== Business career ==
=== WTBS ===
After leaving Brown University, Turner returned to the South in late 1960 to become general manager of the Macon, Georgia, branch of his father&#x27;s business. Following his father&#x27;s suicide in March 1963, Turner became president and chief executive of Turner Advertising Company when he was 24 and turned the firm into a global enterprise. He joined the Young Republicans, saying he &quot;felt at ease among these budding conservatives and was merely following in [his father]&#x27;s far-right footsteps&quot;, according to &quot;It Ain&#x27;t as Easy as It Looks&quot;.

During the Vietnam War era, Turner&#x27;s business prospered; it had &quot;virtual monopolies in Savannah, Macon, Columbus, and Charleston&quot; and was the &quot;largest outdoor advertising company in the Southeast&quot;, according to &quot;It Ain&#x27;t as Easy as It Looks&quot;. The book observed that Turner &quot;discovered his father had sheltered a substantial amount of taxable income over the years by personally lending it back to the company&quot; and &quot;discovered that the billboard business could be a gold mine, a tax-depreciable revenue stream that threw off enormous amounts of cash with almost no capital investment&quot;.

In the late 1960s Turner began buying several Southern radio stations. In 1969, he sold his radio stations to buy a struggling television station in Atlanta, UHF Channel 17 WJRJ (now WPCH). At the time, UHF stations did well only in markets without VHF stations, like Fresno, California, or in markets with only one station on VHF. Independent UHF stations were not ratings winners or that profitable even in larger markets, but Turner concluded that this would change as people wanted more than several choices. He changed the call sign to WTCG, erroneously claimed to have stood for &quot;Watch This Channel Grow&quot; but in actuality stood for Turner Communications Group. Initially, the station ran old movies from prior decades, along with theatrical cartoons and bygone sitcoms and drama programs. As a better syndicated product fell off the VHF stations, Turner would acquire it for his station at a very low price. WTCG ran mostly second- and even third-hand programming of the time, including fare such as &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Hazel&quot;, and &quot;Bugs Bunny&quot;. Other low-cost content included humorist Bill Tush reading the news at 3 a.m., prompting Turner to jokingly comment that, &quot;we have a 100% share at this time&quot;. Tush once delivered the news with his &quot;co-anchor&quot; Rex, a German Shepherd. The dog (who belonged to an associate) was shown next to Tush on set, wearing a shirt and tie while eating a peanut butter sandwich. Rex appeared only on one episode, but a myth grew where many people thought the dog was a nightly guest. By 1972, WTCG had acquired the rights to telecast Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Hawks games. Turner would go on to purchase UHF Channel 36 WRET (now WCNC) in Charlotte, North Carolina, and ran it with a format similar to WTCG.
In 1976, the Federal Communications Commission allowed WTCG to use a satellite to transmit content to local cable TV providers around the nation. On December 17, 1976, the rechristened WTCG-TV Super-Station began to broadcast old movies, situation comedy reruns, cartoons, and sports nationwide to cable-TV subscribers. As cable systems developed, many carried his station to free their schedules, which increased his viewers and advertising. The number of subscribers eventually reached 2 million and Turner&#x27;s net worth rose to $100 million. He bought a plantation in Jacksonboro, South Carolina, for $2 million.

In 1976, Turner bought the Atlanta Braves, and in 1977, he bought the Atlanta Hawks, partially to provide programming for WTCG. Using the rechristened WTBS superstation&#x27;s status to broadcast Braves games into nearly every home in North America, Turner turned the Braves into a household name even before their run of success in the 1990s and early 2000s. At one point, he suggested to pitcher Andy Messersmith, who wore number 17, that he change his surname to &quot;Channel&quot; to promote the television station.

In 1978, Turner struck a deal with a student-operated radio station at MIT, Technology Broadcasting System (now WMBR), to obtain the rights to the WTBS call sign for $50,000. Such a move allowed Turner to strengthen the branding of his &quot;Super-Station&quot; using the initials TBS. Turner Communications Group was renamed Turner Broadcasting System and WTCG was renamed WTBS.

In 1986, Turner founded the Goodwill Games with the goal of easing tensions between capitalist and communist countries. Broadcasting the events of these games also provided his superstation the ability to provide Olympic-style sports programming.

Turner Field, first used for the 1996 Summer Olympics as Centennial Olympic Stadium and then converted into a baseball-only facility for the Braves, was named after him.

=== CNN ===

In 1978, he contacted media executive Reese Schonfeld with his plans to launch a 24-hour news channel (Schonfeld had previously approached Turner with the same proposition in 1977 but was rebuffed). Schonfeld responded that it could be done with a staff of 300 if they used an all electronic newsroom and satellites for all transmissions. It would require an initial investment of $15 million–$20 million and several million dollars per month to operate.

In 1979, Turner sold his North Carolina station, WRET, to fund the transaction and established its headquarters in lower-cost, non-union Atlanta. Schonfeld was appointed first president and chief executive of the then-named Cable News Network (CNN). CNN hired Jim Kitchell, former general manager of news at NBC as vice president of production and operations; Sam Zelman as vice president of news and executive producer; Bill MacPhail as head of sports, Ted Kavanau as director of personnel, and Burt Reinhardt as vice president of the network. In 1982, Schonfeld was succeeded as CEO by Turner after a dispute over Schonfeld&#x27;s firing of Sandi Freeman; and was succeeded as president by CNN&#x27;s executive vice president, Burt Reinhardt.

==== Turner Doomsday Video ====

Turner famously stated before CNN debuted: &quot;We won&#x27;t be signing off until the world ends. We&#x27;ll be on, and we will cover the end of the world, live, and that will be our last event... we&#x27;ll play the National Anthem only one time, on the 1st of June [the network&#x27;s debut on June 1, 1980], and when the end of the world comes, we&#x27;ll play &#x27;Nearer, My God, to Thee&#x27; before we sign off.&quot; Reportedly, Turner plans to make good on that promise. He commissioned a video recording of a military marching band playing the hymn. Turner has sometimes played the tape for reporters, noting the reason he made it. In 2015, the video was found in CNN&#x27;s database and leaked. The video was tagged in the database as &quot;[Hold for release] till end of world confirmed&quot;.

=== Other ventures ===

In 1981, Turner Broadcasting System acquired Brut Productions from Faberge Inc.

After a failed attempt to acquire CBS, Turner purchased the film studio MGM/UA Entertainment Co. from Kirk Kerkorian in 1986 for $1.5 billion. Following the acquisition, Turner had amassed enormous debt and sold parts of the acquisition; Kerkorian bought back MGM/UA Entertainment. The MGM/UA Studio lot in Culver City was sold to Lorimar/Telepictures. Turner kept MGM&#x27;s pre-May 1986 and pre-merger film and television library.

Turner Entertainment was established in August 1986 to oversee film and television properties owned by Turner thanks to the deal with Kerkorian.

Having now acquired MGM&#x27;s library of 2,200 films made before 1986, Turner had them syndicated on his nationwide television stations. When broadcasting their older films, he aired colorized versions of ones originally shot in black-and-white. Opposition arose from cinephiles, actors, and directors to Turner&#x27;s colorization efforts. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote on Turner&#x27;s broadcasting of a colorized &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;that will be one of the saddest days in the history of the movies. It is sad because it demonstrates that there is no movie that Turner will spare, no classic however great that is safe from the vulgarity of his computerized graffiti gangs.&quot; Thanks in part to Turner&#x27;s colorization, the Library of Congress established the National Film Registry with the aim to preserve American films in their original format.

In 1988, Turner purchased Jim Crockett Promotions which he renamed World Championship Wrestling (WCW) which became the main competitor to Vince McMahon&#x27;s World Wrestling Federation (WWF). This rivalry became known as the Monday Night War, and would last throughout the 1990s. In 2001, under AOL Time Warner, WCW was sold to the WWF.

Also in 1988, Turner introduced Turner Network Television (TNT) with &quot;Gone with the Wind.&quot; TNT, initially showing older movies and television shows, added original programs and newer reruns. Turner would later create Turner Classic Movies (TCM) in 1994, airing Turner&#x27;s pre-1986 MGM library of films alongside those of Warner Bros. made before 1950, though it has expanded its library since.

In 1989, Turner created the Turner Tomorrow Fellowship for fiction offering positive solutions to global problems. The winner, from 2500 entries worldwide, was Daniel Quinn&#x27;s &quot;Ishmael.&quot;
In 1990, he created the Turner Foundation, which focuses on philanthropic grants concerning issues pertaining to the environment and overpopulation. In the same year he created Captain Planet, an environmental superhero. Turner produced the television series &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot; and its later sequel series with Captain Planet as the featured character.

In 1992, the pre-May 1986 MGM library, which also included Warner Bros. properties including the early &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; libraries and also the Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons from Paramount (and then United Artists), became the core of Cartoon Network. A year before, Turner&#x27;s companies purchased Hanna-Barbera Productions (whose longtime parent, Taft/Great American Broadcasting, had been headquartered in Turner&#x27;s original hometown of Cincinnati), beating out several other bidders including MCA Inc. (whose subsidiaries included Universal Pictures and Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences) and Hallmark Cards. With the 1996 Time Warner merger, the channel&#x27;s archives gained the later Warner Bros. cartoon library as well as other Time Warner-owned cartoons.

In 1993, Turner and Russian journalist Eduard Sagalajev founded the Moscow Independent Broadcasting Corporation (MIBC). This corporation operated the sixth frequency in Russian television and founded the Russian channel TV-6. The company was later purchased by Russian businessman Boris Berezovsky and an unknown group of private persons. In 2007 the license for TV-6 had expired and there was no application for renewal.

=== Time Warner merger ===

Turner Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner Entertainment on October 10, 1996, with Turner as vice chairman and head of Time Warner Entertainment and Turner&#x27;s cable networks division. Turner was dropped as head of cable networks by CEO Gerald Levin but remained as Vice Chairman of Time Warner Entertainment. He would be succeeded in March 2001 as head of Turner Broadcasting by Jamie Kellner, who was also greatly responsible for cancelling WCW&#x27;s television contracts on networks which Turner previously ran. He resigned as AOL Time Warner vice chairman in 2003 and then from the Time Warner board of directors in 2006.

On January 11, 2001, Time Warner Entertainment was purchased by America Online (AOL) to become AOL Time Warner, a merger which Turner initially supported. However, the burst of the dot-com bubble hurt the growth and profitability of the AOL division, which in turn dragged down AOL Time Warner&#x27;s performance and stock price. At a board meeting in fall 2001, Turner&#x27;s outburst against AOL Time Warner CEO Gerald Levin eventually led to Levin&#x27;s announced resignation effective in early 2002, being replaced by Richard Parsons. In contrast to Levin, who as CEO isolated Turner from important company matters, Parsons invited Turner back to provide strategic advice, although Turner never received an operational role that he sought. Time Warner dropped &quot;AOL&quot; from its name in October 2003. In December 2009, AOL was spun off from the Time Warner conglomerate as a separate company.

Turner was Time Warner&#x27;s biggest individual shareholder. It is estimated he lost as much as $7 billion when the stock collapsed in the wake of the merger. When asked about buying back his former assets, he replied that he &quot;can&#x27;t afford them now&quot;. In June 2014, Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s 21st Century Fox made a bid for Time Warner valuing it at $80 billion. The Time Warner board rejected the offer and it was formally withdrawn on August 5, 2014.

=== Rivalry with Murdoch ===
Turner had a long-running feud with fellow cable magnate Rupert Murdoch for years. This originated in 1983 when a Murdoch-sponsored yacht collided with the yacht skippered by Turner, &quot;Condor&quot;, during the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, causing it to run aground from the finish line. At the post-race dinner, a drunken Turner verbally assaulted Murdoch, afterward challenging him to a televised fistfight in Las Vegas.

Murdoch&#x27;s Fox News, established in 1996, became a rival to Turner&#x27;s CNN, a channel that Murdoch regarded with disdain for its &quot;liberal slant&quot; in news coverage. Time Warner declined to carry it on their New York City cable network in response, who in the midst of a merger, Turner said would &quot;squash Rupert Murdoch like a bug.&quot;

In 2003, Turner challenged Murdoch to another fistfight, and later on accused Murdoch of being a &quot;warmonger&quot; for his support and backing of President George W. Bush&#x27;s invasion of Iraq.

However, revealing in an interview with &quot;Variety&quot; in 2019, Turner said he and Murdoch have since made amends.

=== Atlanta Braves ===

For most of his first decade as owner of the Braves, Turner was a very hands-on owner. This peaked in 1977, his second year as owner.

Turner was suspended for one year by Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn on January 3, 1977, for his actions while pursuing the signing of free agent outfielder Gary Matthews from the San Francisco Giants. Matthews signed a five-year, $1.875 million contract with the Braves on November 18, 1976. Kuhn&#x27;s actions stemmed from remarks made by Turner to then-Giants owner Bob Lurie during the 1976 World Series. In addition, the Braves were also stripped of their first-round selections in the June 1978 draft of high school and college players. Turner, however, successfully appealed the suspension and Kuhn relented and reinstated the draft selections, one of which would turn out to be Bob Horner from Arizona State University.

On May 11, 1977, with the team mired in a 16-game losing streak, Turner sent manager Dave Bristol on a 10-day &quot;scouting trip&quot; and Turner himself took over as interim manager – the first owner/manager in the majors since Connie Mack. He ran the team for one game (a loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates) before National League president Chub Feeney ordered him to stop running the team. Feeney cited major league rules which bar managers and players from owning stock in their clubs. Turner appealed to Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn, and showed up to manage the Braves when they returned home. However, Kuhn turned down the appeal, citing Turner&#x27;s &quot;lack of familiarity with game operations.&quot;

In the mid-1980s Turner began leaving day-to-day operations to the baseball operations staff, and the team (still under Turner&#x27;s ownership) won the 1995 World Series.

The Atlanta Braves were sold by Time Warner (which had assumed control after the merger with Turner Broadcasting System) to Liberty Media in 2007.

== Politics ==
On September 19, 2006, in a Reuters Newsmaker conference, Turner said of Iran&#x27;s nuclear position: &quot;They&#x27;re a sovereign state. We have 28,000. Why can&#x27;t they have 10? We don&#x27;t say anything about Israelthey&#x27;ve got 100 of them approximatelyor India or Pakistan or Russia.&quot;

A proponent of healthcare reform bills, Turner has said: &quot;We’re the only first-world country that doesn&#x27;t have universal healthcare and it&#x27;s a disgrace.&quot;

In 2010, during the wake of both the devastating Deepwater Horizon environmental disaster and the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster that killed 29 miners in West Virginia, Turner stated on CNN that &quot;I&#x27;m just wondering if God is telling us he doesn&#x27;t want to drill offshore. And right before that, we had that coal mine disaster in West Virginia where we lost 29 miners ... Maybe the Lord&#x27;s tired of having the mountains of West Virginia, the tops knocked off of them so they may get more coal. I think maybe we ought to just leave the coal in the ground and go with solar and wind power and geothermals ...&quot;

Turner endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In 2018 he revealed he had once considered a run for president when he was married to Jane Fonda, who told him she would leave him if he did.

===Curbing population growth===

Along with advocating for clean water and improved stewardship of the land, Turner established the Turner Foundation to address ways to curb population growth. Turner has put $125 million of his own money into the foundation and has set aside $6 million per year to address population growth rates. Addressing the issue at a Montana gathering in 1996 he said &quot;I&#x27;m not talking about getting rid of anybody here, I&#x27;ve got 5 children myself.&quot; He went on to discuss hunger and poverty and ways to address those issues.

In 2009 Turner met with other business moguls to include Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, George Soros and David Rockefeller to address issues ranging from the environment to healthcare. The group also addressed population growth with discussion of vaccines and immunization efforts being criticized due to the perception that decision making and public policy could be directed by a handful of elites. Although no formal statement was released, the event was covered by Paul Harris for &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

== Controversial comments ==

Turner once called observers of Ash Wednesday &quot;Jesus freaks&quot;, though he apologized, and dubbed opponents of abortion &quot;bozos&quot;.

In 1999, Turner made a joke about Polish mine detectors when asked about Pope John Paul II. After a harsh response from the Polish deputy foreign minister Radek Sikorski, Turner apologized.

In 2002, Turner accused Israel of terror: &quot;The Palestinians are fighting with human suicide bombers, that&#x27;s all they have. The Israelis ... they&#x27;ve got one of the most powerful military machines in the world. The Palestinians have nothing. So who are the terrorists? I would make a case that both sides are involved in terrorism.&quot; He apologized for that and the remarks in 2011 about the 9/11 hijackers, but also defended himself: &quot;Look, I&#x27;m a very good thinker, but I sometimes grab the wrong word ... I mean, I don&#x27;t type my speeches, then sit up there and read them off the teleprompter, you know. I wing it.&quot;

Also in 2008, Turner asserted on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; that if steps are not taken to address global warming, most people would die and &quot;the rest of us will be cannibals&quot;. Turner also said in the interview that he advocated Americans having no more than two children. In 2010, he stated that China&#x27;s one-child policy should be implemented.

==Turner Enterprises==

Turner Enterprises, Inc. (TEI) is a private American company that was founded in 1976 and manages the business interests, land holdings and investments of Ted Turner, including the oversight of Turner&#x27;s 24 properties across the United States and Argentina. At two million acres of personal and ranch land, Turner is the second-largest landowner in North America. He owned 19 ranches – 16 in the western U.S. and three in Argentina. In January 2016, the Osage Nation bought Turner&#x27;s 43,000 acre (170 km2) Bluestem Ranch in Osage County, Oklahoma. Turner had purchased the property in 2001 primarily to raise bison.

Through Turner Enterprises, he owns ranches in Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. Totaling , his land-holdings across America make Turner one of the largest individual landowners in North America (by acreage).

TEI ranches are primarily used for bison ranching. His bison herd, approximately 51,000 animals on 15 ranches, is the largest private herd in the world. The company&#x27;s mission statement is &quot;To manage Turner lands in an economically sustainable and ecologically sensitive manner while promoting the conservation of native species.&quot; Other important wildlife species on the property include whitetail deer, wild turkey and bobwhite quail. In addition to bison ranching, TEI ranches are also used for commercial fishing and hunting, as well as limited sustainable timber harvesting, as well as eco-tourism on the New Mexico ranches. His biggest ranch is Vermejo Park Ranch in New Mexico. At , it is the largest privately owned, contiguous tract of land in the United States.

TEI works closely with Turner&#x27;s philanthropic and charitable interests, including the founding and ongoing operations of the United Nations Foundation, Nuclear Threat Initiative, Turner Foundation, Captain Planet Foundation, and the Turner Endangered Species Fund. Turner Enterprises is headquartered in the Turner Building (formerly the Bona Allen Office Building) in Atlanta, Georgia, also home to the Ted&#x27;s Montana Grill restaurant chain, Ted Turner Reserves and Turner Renewable Energy. In 2011, Ted Turner and TEI completed construction of a 25-panel solar array in the company&#x27;s parking lot, which provides solar power to the Turner Building and its businesses

Chaired by Turner, TEI&#x27;s executive leadership also includes CEO &amp; President S. Taylor Glover.

== Personal life ==

Turner has been married and divorced three times: to Judy Nye (1960–1964), Jane Shirley Smith (1965–1988), and actress Jane Fonda (1991–2001). He has five children. In a television interview with Piers Morgan on May 3, 2012, Turner said he had four girlfriends, which he acknowledged was complicated but nonetheless easier than being married. One of Turner&#x27;s children, Robert Edward &quot;Teddy&quot; Turner IV, announced on January 23, 2013, that he intended to run in the South Carolina Republican primary for the open Congressional seat vacated by Tim Scott who was appointed to the US Senate. Turner&#x27;s son came in 4th, receiving 7.90% of the vote.

In 2010, Turner joined Warren Buffett&#x27;s and Bill Gates&#x27;s The Giving Pledge, vowing to donate the majority of his fortune to charity upon his death.

In the 1993 biography &quot;It Ain&#x27;t As Easy as It Looks&quot; by Porter Bibb, Turner discussed his use of lithium and struggles with mental illness. The 1981 biography &quot;Lead, Follow or Get Out of the Way&quot; by Christian Williams chronicles the founding of CNN. In 2008, Turner wrote &quot;Call Me Ted,&quot; which documents his career and personal life.

In an interview on &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot; in 2018, Turner revealed his diagnosis of Lewy body dementia.

== Sailing ==

When Turner was 26, he entered sailing competitions at the Savannah Yacht Club and competed in Olympic trials in 1964. He first attempted to win the America&#x27;s Cup in 1974, losing in the defender&#x27;s trials, aboard 12 Metre class yacht US–25 &quot;Mariner&quot;. Turner was defeated by Ted Hood aboard US–26 &quot;Courageous&quot;.

Turner was asked to join the 1977 America&#x27;s Cup defense syndicate formed by Hood and Lee Loomis for the New York Yacht Club. That group still owned the &quot;Courageous&quot; but decided to design and construct a new 12 Metre - US–28 &quot;Independence&quot; - to defend the 1974 America&#x27;s Cup victory. However, in the trials, with Turner as skipper aboard the 3-year-old &quot;Courageous&quot; proved to be the faster than Hood and &quot;Independence&quot; and was selected to race in the 1977 races.

From 13 to 18 September 1977 &quot;Courageous&quot;, with Turner in command, defeated the challenger &quot;Australia&quot;, skippered by Noel Robins, in a four-race sweep. &quot;Courageous&quot;&#x27; greatest winning margin out of all four races was 2 minutes and 23 seconds. 

In the 1979 Fastnet Race, in a storm that killed 15 participants, he skippered the S&amp;S-designed 61-footer &quot;Tenacious&quot; to a corrected-time victory.

Turner appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; on July 4, 1977, after winning 1977 America&#x27;s Cup.
Turner was inducted into the America&#x27;s Cup Hall of Fame in 1993, and the National Sailing Hall of Fame in 2011.

==Legacy==

Turner has been regarded as one of the entrepreneurs who transformed the cable industry and being referred to as &quot;the Alexander the Great of broadcasting&quot; by Slate magazine:

While Turner has been described as a &quot;valiant liberator&quot; and cast the networks as oppressive scoundrels, in content his programming fell short of inspiring. His network was built on sitcom reruns, old movies, cartoons, and Atlanta Braves games. He found an audience for classics of a bygone time, along with slightly down-market content like professional wrestling. Nonetheless, he would find glorious terms even for retreads and junk, claiming to be pulling America back to television&#x27;s golden age: &quot;I want to get it back to the principles&quot; he once said, &quot;that made us good.&quot; Nostalgic, Manichean, and boot-strappy: like programmer, like programming

The cable industry boomed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as nearly a dozen cable networks launched based on the Turner model. They include much of what we now consider the staples of cable TV, including ESPN, MTV, Bravo, Showtime, BET, the Discovery Channel, and the Weather Channel. Those are the better-known channels only by virtue of having survived; others, such as ARTS, CBS Cable, and the Satellite News Channel, folded or were acquired by other companies

Bob Hope, who is co-owner and president of Hope-Beckham, an independent agency based in Atlanta that previously worked for Turner in his networks, has described that &quot;Ted Turner was special. His vision and his determination and his unwillingness to quit were infectious. He was willing to start small and had the persistence and patience to make his ideas grow&quot;. Hope also further reiterated that &quot;In some ways, he was outrageous, but in most ways he was remarkable. He had great passion for doing what was right for the world. He stated his dream of using communication to bring peace, to tell both sides of any story, that &#x27;one man&#x27;s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter.&#x27; If he could get people to understand each other, there would be no wars. His vision was bold and infectious. His Goodwill Games, his creation of the UN Foundation, and his approach to news on the original CNN were passions for peace&quot;.

Professional wrestling promoter and former Senior Vice President of WCW second in charge after Turner, Eric Bischoff praised Turner claiming &quot;He was an inspirational leader, he was a risk taker, he appreciated people who took risks, he was not afraid of failure while most people are. Ted was not afraid to fail, he was more afraid of not trying and not conquering that next horizon.”

On June 24, 1999, Vince McMahon stated on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;: &quot;All I&#x27;ll say about Ted is he&#x27;s a son-of-a-bitch, other than that, he&#x27;s probably not a bad guy, but I don&#x27;t like him at all&quot;. Later in 2021, when asked about the upstart AEW in comparison to Turner&#x27;s WCW, McMahon dismissed AEW, stating that &quot;it certainly is not a situation where &#x27;rising tides&#x27; because that was when Ted Turner was coming after us with all of Time Warner&#x27;s assets as well&quot;.

In 2010 Turner was named a Georgia Trustee, an honor given by the Georgia Historical Society, in conjunction with the Governor of Georgia, to individuals whose accomplishments and community service reflect the ideals of the founding body of Trustees, which governed the Georgia colony from 1732 to 1752.

<doc id="30476" wikidata="Q258331" url="?curid=30476" title="Tanka">
<text>is a genre of classical Japanese poetry and one of the major genres of Japanese literature.

==Etymology==
Originally, in the time of the influential poetry anthology (latter half of the eighth century AD), the term &quot;tanka&quot; was used to distinguish &quot;short poems&quot; from the longer . In the ninth and tenth centuries, however, notably with the compilation of the &quot;Kokinshū&quot;, the short poem became the dominant form of poetry in Japan, and the originally general word became the standard name for this form. Japanese poet and critic Masaoka Shiki revived the term &quot;tanka&quot; in the early twentieth century for his statement that &quot;waka should be renewed and modernized&quot;. &quot;Haiku&quot; is also a term of his invention, used for his revision of standalone Hokku, with the same idea.

==Form==

Tanka consist of five units (often treated as separate lines when romanized or translated) usually with the following pattern of &quot;on&quot; (often treated as, roughly, the number of syllables per unit or line):
:5-7-5-7-7.

The 5-7-5 is called the , and the 7-7 is called the . Sometimes the distinction between Waka and Tanka are drawn on where the division is placed, either after the first couplet or after the first tercet, but sources disagree. Even in early classical compilations of these poems, such as the &quot;Ogura Hyakunin Isshu&quot;, the form is often broken to suit the poet&#x27;s preferences.

==History==

===Modern===
During the Kojiki and Nihonshoki periods the tanka retained a well defined form, but the history of the mutations of the tanka itself forms an important chapter in haiku history,
until the modern revival of tanka began with several poets who began to publish literary magazines, gathering their friends and disciples as contributors.

Yosano Tekkan and the poets that were associated with his &quot;Myōjō&quot; magazine were one example, but that magazine was fairly short-lived (Feb. 1900 Nov. 1908). A young high school student, Otori You (later known as Akiko Yosano), and Ishikawa Takuboku contributed to &quot;Myōjō&quot;. In 1980 the &quot;New York Times&quot; published a representative work:
Masaoka Shiki&#x27;s (1867–1902) poems and writing (as well as the work of his friends and disciples) have had a more lasting influence. The magazine &quot;Hototogisu&quot;, which he founded, still publishes.

In the Meiji period (1868–1912), Shiki claimed the situation with waka should be rectified, and waka should be modernized in the same way as other things in the country. He praised the style of as manly, as opposed to the style of &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;, the model for waka for a thousand years, which he denigrated and called feminine. He praised Minamoto no Sanetomo, the third &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Kamakura shogunate, who was a disciple of Fujiwara no Teika and composed waka in a style much like that in the .
Following Shiki&#x27;s death, in the Taishō period (1912–26), Mokichi Saitō and his friends began publishing a magazine, &quot;Araragi&quot;, which praised the . Using their magazine they spread their influence throughout the country. Their modernization aside, in the court the old traditions still prevailed. The court continues to hold many &quot;utakai&quot; (waka reading parties) both officially and privately. The utakai that the Emperor holds on the first of the year is called &quot;Utakai Hajime&quot; and it is an important event for waka poets; the Emperor himself releases a single tanka for the public&#x27;s perusal.

After World War II, waka began to be considered out-of-date, but since the late 1980s it has revived under the example of contemporary poets, such as Machi Tawara. With her 1987 bestselling collection &quot;Salad Anniversary&quot;, the poet has been credited with revitalising the tanka for modern audiences.

Today there are many circles of tanka poets. Many newspapers have a weekly tanka column, and there are many professional and amateur tanka poets; Makoto Ōoka&#x27;s poetry column was published seven days a week for more than 20 years on the front page of &quot;Asahi Shimbun.&quot; As a parting gesture, outgoing PM Jun&#x27;ichirō Koizumi wrote a tanka to thank his supporters.

The Japanese imperial family continue to write tanka for the New Year.

==Poetic culture==
In ancient times, it was a custom between two writers to exchange waka instead of letters in prose. In particular, it was common between lovers. Reflecting this custom, five of the twenty volumes of the Kokin Wakashū gathered waka for love. In the Heian period the lovers would exchange waka in the morning when lovers met at the woman&#x27;s home. The exchanged waka were called &quot;Kinuginu&quot; (後朝), because it was thought the man wanted to stay with his lover and when the sun rose he had almost no time to put on his clothes on which he had lain instead of a mattress (it being the custom in those days). Works of this period, &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; and &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; provide us with such examples in the life of aristocrats. Murasaki Shikibu uses 795 waka in her &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; as waka her characters made in the story. Some of these are her own, although most are taken from existing sources. Shortly, making and reciting waka became a part of aristocratic culture. They recited a part of appropriate waka freely to imply something on an occasion.

Much like with tea, there were a number of rituals and events surrounding the composition, presentation, and judgment of waka. There were two types of waka party that produced occasional poetry: &quot;Utakai&quot; and &quot;Uta-awase&quot;. Utakai was a party in which all participants wrote a waka and recited them. Utakai derived from Shikai, Kanshi party and was held in occasion people gathered like seasonal party for the New Year, some celebrations for a newborn baby, a birthday, or a newly built house. &quot;Utaawase&quot; was a contest in two teams. Themes were determined and a chosen poet from each team wrote a waka for a given theme. The judge appointed a winner for each theme and gave points to the winning team. The team which received the largest sum was the winner. The first recorded Utaawase was held in around 885. At first, Utaawase was playful and mere entertainment, but as the poetic tradition deepened and grew, it turned into a serious aesthetic contest, with considerably more formality.

<doc id="30479" wikidata="Q42544" url="?curid=30479" title="Thomas More">
<text>Sir Thomas More (7 February 1478 – 6 July 1535), venerated in the Catholic Church as Saint Thomas More, was an English lawyer, judge, social philosopher, author, statesman, theologian, and noted Renaissance humanist. He also served Henry VIII as Lord High Chancellor of England from October 1529 to May 1532. He wrote &quot;Utopia&quot;, published in 1516, which describes the political system of an imaginary island state.

More opposed the Protestant Reformation, directing polemics against the theology of Martin Luther, Huldrych Zwingli and William Tyndale. More also opposed Henry VIII&#x27;s separation from the Catholic Church, refusing to acknowledge Henry as supreme head of the Church of England and the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. After refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy, he was convicted of treason on what he stated was false evidence, and was executed. At his execution, he was reported to have said: &quot;I die the King&#x27;s good servant, and God&#x27;s first.&quot;

Pope Pius XI canonised More in 1935 as a martyr. Pope John Paul II in 2000 declared him the patron saint of statesmen and politicians. In his proclamation the pope stated: &quot;It can be said that he demonstrated in a singular way the value of a moral conscience... even if, in his actions against heretics, he reflected the limits of the culture of his time&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born in the City of London, on 7 February 1478, Thomas More was the son of Sir John More (a successful lawyer and later a judge) and his wife Agnes (&quot;née&quot; Graunger). John More lived for &quot;the most part of his life&quot; in Milk Street, London and, from this, many biographers (starting with More&#x27;s great grandson Cresacre More in the seventeenth century) have asserted, without confirmation, that this was the place of Thomas More&#x27;s birth. No contemporary biographer recorded this. He was the second of six children. More was educated at St. Anthony&#x27;s School, then considered one of London&#x27;s best schools. From 1490 to 1492, More served John Morton, the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor of England, as a household page.

Morton enthusiastically supported the &quot;New Learning&quot; (scholarship which was later known as &quot;humanism&quot; or &quot;London humanism&quot;), and thought highly of the young More. Believing that More had great potential, Morton nominated him for a place at the University of Oxford, either in St. Mary Hall or Canterbury College, both now defunct.

More began his studies at Oxford in 1492, and received a classical education. Studying under Thomas Linacre and William Grocyn, he became proficient in both Latin and Greek. More left Oxford after only two years—at his father&#x27;s insistence—to begin legal training in London at New Inn, one of the Inns of Chancery. In 1496, More became a student at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, one of the Inns of Court, where he remained until 1502, when he was called to the Bar.

More could speak and banter in Latin with the same facility as in English. He wrote and translated poetry. He was particularly influenced by Pico della Mirandola and translated the &quot;Life of Pico&quot; into English.

== Spiritual life ==
According to his friend, the theologian Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam, More once seriously contemplated abandoning his legal career to become a monk. Between 1503 and 1504 More lived near the Carthusian monastery outside the walls of London and joined in the monks&#x27; spiritual exercises. Although he deeply admired their piety, More ultimately decided to remain a layman, standing for election to Parliament in 1504 and marrying the following year.

More continued ascetic practices for the rest of his life, such as wearing a hair shirt next to his skin and occasionally engaging in self-flagellation. A tradition of the Third Order of Saint Francis honours More as a member of that Order on their calendar of saints.

== Family life ==
More married Joanna &quot;Jane&quot; Colt, the eldest daughter of John Colt of Essex in 1505. In that year he leased a portion of a house known as the Old Barge (originally there had been a wharf nearby serving the Walbrook river) on Bucklersbury, St Stephen Walbrook parish, London. Eight years later he took over the rest of the house and in total he lived there for almost 20 years, until his move to Chelsea in 1525. Erasmus reported that More wanted to give his young wife a better education than she had previously received at home, and tutored her in music and literature. The couple had four children: Margaret, Elizabeth, Cecily, and John. Jane died in 1511.

Going &quot;against friends&#x27; advice and common custom,&quot; within 30 days, More had married one of the many eligible women among his wide circle of friends. He chose Alice Middleton, a widow, to head his household and care for his small children. The speed of the marriage was so unusual that More had to get a dispensation from the banns of marriage, which, due to his good public reputation, he easily obtained.

More had no children from his second marriage, although he raised Alice&#x27;s daughter from her previous marriage as his own. More also became the guardian of two young girls: Anne Cresacre who would eventually marry his son, John More; and Margaret Giggs (later Clement), who was the only member of his family to witness his execution. An affectionate father, More wrote letters to his children whenever he was away on legal or government business, and encouraged them to write to him often.

More insisted upon giving his daughters the same classical education as his son, an unusual attitude at the time. His eldest daughter, Margaret, attracted much admiration for her erudition, especially her fluency in Greek and Latin. More told his daughter of his pride in her academic accomplishments in September 1522, after he showed the bishop a letter she had written:

More&#x27;s decision to educate his daughters set an example for other noble families. Even Erasmus became much more favourable once he witnessed their accomplishments.

A large portrait of More and his extended family, &quot;Sir Thomas More and Family&quot;, was painted by Hans Holbein the Younger; however, it was lost in a fire in the 18th century. More&#x27;s grandson commissioned a copy, of which two versions survive. The Nostell copy of the portrait shown above also includes the family&#x27;s two pet dogs and monkey.

Musical instruments such as a lute and viol feature in the background of the extant copies of Holbein&#x27;s family portrait. More played the recorder and viol, and made sure his wives could join in the family consort.

== Personality according to Erasmus ==
Concerning More&#x27;s personality, Erasmus gave a consistent portrait over a period of thirty five years.

Soon after meeting the young lawyer More, who became his best friend and invited Erasmus into his household, Erasmus reported in 1500 &quot;Did nature ever invent anything kinder, sweeter or more harmonious than the character of Thomas More?&quot;. In 1519, he wrote that More was &quot;born and designed for friendship; no one is more open-hearted in making friends or more tenacious in keeping them.&quot; In 1535, after More&#x27;s execution, Erasmus wrote that More &quot;never bore ill-intent towards anyone&quot;:

In a 1532 letter, Erasmus wrote &quot;such is the kindliness of his disposition, or rather, to say it better, such is his piety and wisdom, that whatever comes his way that cannot be corrected, he comes to love just as wholeheartedly as if nothing better could have happened to him.&quot;

In a 1533 letter, Erasmus described More&#x27;s character as – commanding, far-ruling, not at all timid.

For his part, &quot;Thomas More was an unflagging apologist for Erasmus for the thirty-six years of their adult lives (1499–1535).&quot;

== Early political career ==
In 1504 More was elected to Parliament to represent Great Yarmouth, and in 1510 began representing London.

More first attracted public attention by his conduct in the parliament of 1504, by his daring opposition to the King&#x27;s demand for money. King Henry VII was entitled, according to feudal laws, to a grant on occasion of his daughter Margaret Tudor&#x27;s marriage to James IV of Scotland. But he came to the House of Commons for a much larger sum than he intended to give with his daughter. The members, unwilling as they were to vote the money, were afraid to offend the King, until the silence was broken by More, whose speech is said to have moved the house to reduce the subsidy of three-fifteenths which the Government had demanded to £30,000. One of the chamberlains went and told his master that he had been thwarted by a beardless boy. Henry never forgave the audacity; but, for the moment, the only revenge he could take was upon More&#x27;s father, whom upon some pretext he threw into the Tower, and he only released him upon payment of a fine of £100. Thomas More even found it advisable to withdraw from public life into obscurity.

Henry died in 1509 and was succeeded by his son King Henry VIII.

From 1510, More served as one of the two undersheriffs of the City of London, a position of considerable responsibility in which he earned a reputation as an honest and effective public servant. Interested in public health, he became a Commissioner for Sewers in 1514. More became Master of Requests in 1514, the same year in which he was appointed as a Privy Counsellor. After undertaking a diplomatic mission to the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, accompanying Thomas Wolsey, Cardinal Archbishop of York, to Calais (for the Field of the Cloth of Gold) and Bruges, More was knighted and made under-treasurer of the Exchequer in 1521.

As secretary and personal adviser to King Henry VIII, More became increasingly influential: welcoming foreign diplomats, drafting official documents, attending the court of the Star Chamber for his legal prowess but delegated to judge in the under-court for &#x27;poor man&#x27;s cases&#x27; and serving as a liaison between the King and Lord Chancellor Wolsey. More later served as High Steward for the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.

In 1523 More was elected as knight of the shire (MP) for Middlesex and, on Wolsey&#x27;s recommendation, the House of Commons elected More its Speaker. In 1525 More became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, with executive and judicial responsibilities over much of northern England.

== Chancellorship ==
After Wolsey fell, More succeeded to the office of Lord Chancellor (the chief government minister) in 1529; this was the highest official responsible for equity and common law, including contracts and royal household cases, and some misdemeanour appeals. He dispatched cases with unprecedented rapidity. Putting into effect his proposals for public sanitation that he had first suggested in &quot;Utopia&quot;, in 1532 he was responsible for introducing into law the Statute of Sewers (23 Henry VII, cap.5).

As Lord Chancellor he was a member (and probably the Presiding Judge at the court when present, who spoke last and cast the deciding vote in case of ties) of the Court of the Star Chamber, an appeals court on civil and criminal matters, including riot and sedition, that was the final appeal in dissenter&#x27;s trials.

=== Campaign against the Protestant Reformation ===

More supported the Catholic Church and saw the Protestant Reformation as heresy, a threat to the unity of both church and society. More believed in the theology, argumentation, and ecclesiastical laws of the church, and &quot;heard Luther&#x27;s call to destroy the Catholic Church as a call to war.&quot;

More wrote a series of books and pamphlets in English and Latin to respond to Protestants, and in his official capacities took action against the illegal book trade, notably fronting a diplomatically-sensitive raid in 1525 of the Hanseatic Merchants in the Steelyard in role as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and given his diplomatic experience negotiating with the Hanse.

====Debates with Tyndale====
More wrote several books against the first edition of Tyndale&#x27;s English translation of the New Testament. More wrote the &quot;Dialogue concerning Heresies&quot; (1529), Tyndale responded with &quot;An Answer to Sir T. More&#x27;s Dialogue&quot; (1530), and More replied with his &quot;Confutation of Tyndale&#x27;s Answer&quot; (1532). More also wrote or contributed to several other anti-Lutheran books.

One of More&#x27;s criticisms of the initial Tyndale translation was that despite claiming to be in the vernacular, Tyndale had employed numerous neologisms: for example, &quot;Jehovah&quot;, &quot;scapegoat&quot;, &quot;Passover&quot;, &quot;atonement&quot;, &quot;mercy seat&quot;, &quot;shewbread&quot;. More also accused Tyndale of deliberately avoiding common translations in favour of biased words: such as using the emotion &quot;love&quot; instead of the practical action &quot;charity&quot; for Greek , using the neologism &quot;senior&quot; instead of &quot;priest&quot; for the Greek (Tyndale changed this to &quot;elder&quot;), and the Latinate &quot;congregation&quot; instead of &quot;church&quot;. Tyndale&#x27;s Bibles include text other than the scriptures: some of Tyndale&#x27;s prefaces were direct translations of Martin Luther, and it included marginal glosses which challenged Catholic doctrine.

One notable exchange occurred over More&#x27;s attack on Tyndale&#x27;s use of &quot;congregation&quot;. Tyndale pointed out that he was following &quot;your darling&quot; Erasmus&#x27; Latin translation of into . More replied that Erasmus needed to coin because there was no good Latin word, while English had the perfectly fine &quot;church&quot;, but that the intent and theology under the words were all important:

=== Resignation ===
As the conflict over supremacy between the Papacy and the King reached its peak, More continued to remain steadfast in supporting the supremacy of the Pope as Successor of Peter over that of the King of England. Parliament&#x27;s reinstatement of the charge of praemunire in 1529 had made it a crime to support in public or office the claim of any authority outside the realm (such as the Papacy) to have a legal jurisdiction superior to the King&#x27;s.

In 1530, More refused to sign a letter by the leading English churchmen and aristocrats asking Pope Clement VII to annul Henry&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Aragon, and also quarrelled with Henry VIII over the heresy laws. In 1531, a royal decree required the clergy to take an oath acknowledging the King as Supreme Head of the Church of England. The bishops at the Convocation of Canterbury in 1532 agreed to sign the Oath but only under threat of prosecution for praemunire and only after these words were added: &quot;as far as the law of Christ allows&quot;.

This was considered to be the final Submission of the Clergy. Cardinal John Fisher and some other clergy refused to sign. Henry purged most clergy who supported the papal stance from senior positions in the church. More continued to refuse to sign the Oath of Supremacy and did not agree to support the annulment of Henry&#x27;s marriage to Catherine. However, he did not openly reject the King&#x27;s actions and kept his opinions private.

On 16 May 1532, More resigned from his role as Chancellor but remained in Henry&#x27;s favour despite his refusal. His decision to resign was caused by the decision of the convocation of the English Church, which was under intense royal threat, on the day before.

== Controversy on extent of prosecution of heretics ==
There is considerable variation in opinion on the extent and nature of More&#x27;s prosecution of heretics: witness the difference in portrayals of More in &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; as an urbane hero of conscience and in Wolf Hall as a &quot;mere dessicated fanatic.&quot; The English establishment initially regarded Protestants (and Anabaptists) as akin to the Lollards and Hussites whose heresies fed their sedition. Ambassador to Charles V Cuthbert Tunstall called Lutheranism the &quot;foster-child&quot; of the Wycliffite heresy that had underpinned Lollardy.

Historian Richard Rex wrote:

=== Torture allegations ===
Torture was not officially legal in England, except in pre-trial discovery phase of kinds of extreme cases that the King had allowed, such as seditious heresy. It was regarded as unsafe for evidence, and was not an allowed punishment.

Stories emerged in More&#x27;s lifetime regarding persecution of the Protestant &quot;heretics&quot; during his time as Lord Chancellor, and he denied them in detail in his (1533).

Many stories were later published by the 16th-century English Protestant historian John Foxe in his polemical &quot;Book of Martyrs.&quot; Foxe was instrumental in publicizing accusations of torture, alleging that More had often personally used violence or torture while interrogating heretics. Later Protestant authors such as Brian Moynahan and Michael Farris cite Foxe when repeating these allegations. Biographer Peter Ackroyd also lists claims from Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Book of Martyrs&quot; and other post-Reformation sources that More &quot;tied heretics to a tree in his Chelsea garden and whipped them&quot;, that &quot;he watched as &#x27;newe men&#x27; were put upon the rack in the Tower and tortured until they confessed&quot;, and that &quot;he was personally responsible for the burning of several of the &#x27;brethren&#x27; in Smithfield.&quot;

Historian John Guy commented that &quot;such charges are unsupported by independent proof.&quot; Modern historian Diarmaid MacCulloch finds no evidence that he was directly involved in torture. Richard Marius records a similar claim, which tells about James Bainham, and writes that &quot;the story Foxe told of Bainham&#x27;s whipping and racking at More&#x27;s hands is universally doubted today&quot;.

More himself denied these allegations:

More instead claimed in his &quot;Apology&quot; (1533) that he only applied corporal punishment to two &quot;heretics&quot;: a child servant in his household who was caned (the customary punishment for children at that time) for repeating a heresy regarding the Eucharist, and a &quot;feeble-minded&quot; man who was whipped for disrupting the mass by raising women&#x27;s skirts over their heads at the moment of consecration, More taking the action to prevent a lynching.

=== Executions ===
Burning at the stake was the standard punishment by the English state for obstinate or relapsed, major seditious or proselytizing heresy, and continued to be used by both Catholics and Protestants during the religious upheaval of the following decades. In England, following the Lollard uprisings, heresy had been linked to sedition (see and Suppression of Heresy Act 1414.)

Ackroyd and MacCulloch agree that More zealously approved of burning. Richard Marius maintained that in office More did everything in his power to bring about the extermination of heretics.

During More&#x27;s chancellorship, six people were burned at the stake for heresy, the same rate as under Wolsey: they were Thomas Hitton, Thomas Bilney, Richard Bayfield, John Tewkesbury, Thomas Dusgate, and James Bainham. However, the court of the Star Chamber, of which More as Lord Chancellor was the presiding judge, could not impose the death sentence: it was a kind of appellate supreme court.

More took a personal interest in the three London cases:
* John Tewkesbury was a London leather seller found guilty by the Bishop of London John Stokesley of harbouring English translated New Testaments; he was sentenced to burning for refusing to recant. More declared: he &quot;burned as there was neuer wretche I wene better worthy.&quot;
* Richard Bayfield was found distributing Tyndale&#x27;s Bibles, and examined by Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall. More commented that he was &quot;well and worthely burned&quot;.
* James Bainham was arrested on a warrant of Thomas More as Lord Chancellor and detained at his gatehouse. He was examined by Bishop John Stokesley, abjured, penalized and freed. He subsequently re-canted, and was re-arrested, tried and executed as a relapsed heretic.

Historian Brian Moynahan alleged that More influenced the eventual execution of William Tyndale in the Duchy of Brabant, as English agents had long pursued Tyndale. Historian Richard Rex argues that linking the execution to More was &quot;bizarre&quot;. Moynihan named Henry Phillips, a student at the University of Louvain and follower of Bishop Stokesley, as the man More commissioned to befriend Tyndale and then betray him. However, the execution took place on 6 October 1536, sixteen months after More himself had been executed, and in a different jurisdiction.

=== Modern treatment ===
Modern commentators have been divided over More&#x27;s character and actions.

Some biographers, including Peter Ackroyd, have taken a relatively tolerant or even positive view of More&#x27;s campaign against Protestantism by placing his actions within the turbulent religious climate of the time and the threat of deadly catastrophes such as the German Peasants&#x27; Revolt, which More blamed on Luther, as did many others, such as Erasmus.

Others have been more critical, such as writer Richard Marius, an American scholar of the Reformation, believing that such persecutions were a betrayal of More&#x27;s earlier humanist convictions, including More&#x27;s zealous and well-documented advocacy of extermination for heretics. This supposed contradiction has been called &quot;schizophrenic.&quot; He has been called a &quot;zealous legalist[...] [with an] itchy finesse of cruelty&quot;.

Pope John Paul II honoured him by making More patron saint of statesmen and politicians in October 2000, stating: &quot;It can be said that he demonstrated in a singular way the value of a moral conscience[...] even if, in his actions against heretics, he reflected the limits of the culture of his time&quot;.

Australian High Court judge and President of the International Commission of Jurists, Justice Michael Kirby has noted:

== Indictment, trial and execution ==
In 1533, More refused to attend the coronation of Anne Boleyn as Queen of England. Technically, this was not an act of treason, as More had written to Henry seemingly acknowledging Anne&#x27;s queenship and expressing his desire for the King&#x27;s happiness and the new Queen&#x27;s health. Despite this, his refusal to attend was widely interpreted as a snub against Anne, and Henry took action against him. Shortly thereafter, More was charged with accepting bribes, but the charges had to be dismissed for lack of any evidence.

In early 1534, More was accused by Thomas Cromwell of having given advice and counsel to the &quot;Holy Maid of Kent,&quot; Elizabeth Barton, a nun who had prophesied that the King had ruined his soul and would come to a quick end for having divorced Queen Catherine. This was a month after Barton had confessed, which was possibly done under royal pressure, and was said to be concealment of treason. Though it was dangerous for anyone to have anything to do with Barton, More had met her and was impressed by her fervour. However, More was prudent and told her not to interfere with state matters. More was called before a committee of the Privy Council to answer these charges of treason and, after his respectful answers, the matter seemed to have been dropped.

On 13 April 1534, More was asked to appear before a commission and swear his allegiance to the parliamentary Act of Succession. More accepted Parliament&#x27;s right to declare Anne Boleyn the legitimate Queen of England, though he refused &quot;the spiritual validity of the King&#x27;s second marriage&quot; and, holding fast to the teaching of papal supremacy, he steadfastly refused to take the oath of supremacy of the Crown in the relationship between the kingdom and the church in England. More also publicly refused to uphold Henry&#x27;s annulment from Catherine. John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, refused the oath along with More. The oath reads in part:

In addition to refusing to support the King&#x27;s annulment or supremacy, More refused to sign the 1534 Oath of Succession confirming Anne&#x27;s role as queen and the rights of their children to succession. More&#x27;s fate was sealed. While he had no argument with the basic concept of succession as stated in the Act, the preamble of the Oath repudiated the authority of the Pope.

===Indictment===
More&#x27;s enemies had enough evidence to have the King arrest him on treason. Four days later, Henry had More imprisoned in the Tower of London. There More prepared a devotional, &quot;Dialogue of Comfort against Tribulation&quot;. While More was imprisoned in the Tower, Thomas Cromwell made several visits, urging More to take the oath, which he continued to refuse.

In his unfinished &quot;History of the Passion&quot;, written in the Tower to his daughter Meg, he wrote of feeling favoured by God: &quot;For methinketh God maketh me a wanton, and setteth me on his lap and dandleth me.&quot;

The charges of high treason related to More&#x27;s violating the statutes as to the King&#x27;s supremacy (malicious silence) and conspiring with Bishop John Fisher in this respect (malicious conspiracy) and, according to some sources, included asserting that Parliament did not have the right to proclaim the King&#x27;s Supremacy over the English Church. One group of scholars believes that the judges dismissed the first two charges (malicious acts) and tried More only on the final one, but others strongly disagree.

Regardless of the specific charges, the indictment related to violation of the Treasons Act 1534 which declared it treason to speak against the King&#x27;s Supremacy:

===Trial===
The trial was held on 1 July 1535, before a panel of judges that included the new Lord Chancellor Sir Thomas Audley, as well as Anne Boleyn&#x27;s uncle Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, her father Thomas Boleyn, and her brother George Boleyn. Norfolk offered More the chance of the King&#x27;s &quot;gracious pardon&quot; should he &quot;reform his[...] obstinate opinion&quot;. More responded that, although he had not taken the oath, he had never spoken out against it either and that his silence could be accepted as his &quot;ratification and confirmation&quot; of the new statutes.

Thus More was relying upon legal precedent and the maxim (&quot;one who keeps silent seems to consent&quot;), understanding that he could not be convicted as long as he did not explicitly deny that the King was Supreme Head of the Church, and he therefore refused to answer all questions regarding his opinions on the subject.

Thomas Cromwell, at the time the most powerful of the King&#x27;s advisors, brought forth Solicitor General Richard Rich to testify that More had, in his presence, denied that the King was the legitimate head of the Church. This testimony was characterised by More as being extremely dubious. Witnesses Richard Southwell and Mr. Palmer (a servant to Southwell) were also present and both denied having heard the details of the reported conversation. As More himself pointed out:

The jury took only fifteen minutes to find More guilty.

After the jury&#x27;s verdict was delivered and before his sentencing, More spoke freely of his belief that &quot;no temporal man may be the head of the spirituality&quot; (take over the role of the Pope). According to William Roper&#x27;s account, More was pleading that the Statute of Supremacy was contrary to Magna Carta, to Church laws and to the laws of England, attempting to void the entire indictment against him. He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered (the usual punishment for traitors who were not the nobility), but the King commuted this to execution by decapitation.

===Execution===
The execution took place on 6 July 1535 at Tower Hill. When he came to mount the steps to the scaffold, its frame seeming so weak that it might collapse, More is widely quoted as saying (to one of the officials): &quot;I pray you, master Lieutenant, see me safe up and [for] my coming down, let me shift for my self&quot;; while on the scaffold he declared &quot;that he died the king&#x27;s good servant, and God&#x27;s first.&quot; Theologian Scott W. Hahn notes that the misquoted &quot; God&#x27;s first&quot; is a line from Robert Bolt&#x27;s stage play &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot;, which differs from More&#x27;s actual words. After More had finished reciting the while kneeling, the executioner reportedly begged his pardon, then More rose up, kissed him and forgave him.

=== Relics ===

Another comment More is believed to have made to the executioner is that his beard was completely innocent of any crime, and did not deserve the axe; he then positioned his beard so that it would not be harmed. More asked that his adopted daughter Margaret Clement (née Giggs) be given his headless corpse to bury. She was the only member of his family to witness his execution. He was buried at the Tower of London, in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in an unmarked grave. His head was fixed upon a pike over London Bridge for a month, according to the normal custom for traitors.

More&#x27;s daughter Margaret Roper (née More) later rescued the severed head. It is believed to rest in the Roper Vault of St Dunstan&#x27;s Church, Canterbury, perhaps with the remains of Margaret and her husband&#x27;s family. Some have claimed that the head is buried within the tomb erected for More in Chelsea Old Church.

Among other surviving relics is his hair shirt, presented for safe keeping by Margaret Clement. This was long in the custody of the community of Augustinian canonesses who until 1983 lived at the convent at Abbotskerswell Priory, Devon. Some sources, including one from 2004, claimed that the shirt, made of goat hair was then at the Martyr&#x27;s church on the Weld family&#x27;s estate in Chideock, Dorset. It is now preserved at Buckfast Abbey, near Buckfastleigh in Devon.

=== Epitaph ===
In 1533, More wrote to Erasmus and included what he intended should be the epitaph on his family tomb:

== Scholarly and literary work ==

=== &quot;History of King Richard III&quot; ===
Between 1512 and 1519 More worked on a &quot;History of King Richard III&quot;, which he never finished but which was published after his death. The &quot;History&quot; is a Renaissance biography, remarkable more for its literary skill and adherence to classical precepts than for its historical accuracy. Some consider it an attack on royal tyranny, rather than on Richard III himself or the House of York. More uses a more dramatic writing style than had been typical in medieval chronicles; Richard III is limned as an outstanding, archetypal tyrant—however, More was only seven years old when Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, so he had no first-hand knowledge of him.

The &quot;History of King Richard III&quot; was written and published in both English and Latin, each written separately, and with information deleted from the Latin edition to suit a European readership. It greatly influenced William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot;. Modern historians attribute the unflattering portraits of Richard III in both works to both authors&#x27; allegiance to the reigning Tudor dynasty that wrested the throne from Richard III in the Wars of the Roses. According to Caroline Barron, Archbishop John Morton, in whose household More had served as a page , had joined the 1483 Buckingham rebellion against Richard III, and Morton was probably one of those who influenced More&#x27;s hostility towards the defeated king. Clements Markham asserts that the actual author of the chronicle was, in large part, Archbishop Morton himself and that More was simply copying, or perhaps translating, Morton&#x27;s original material.

=== &quot;Utopia&quot; ===
More&#x27;s best known and most controversial work, &quot;Utopia&quot;, is a frame narrative written in Latin. More completed the book, and theologian Erasmus published it in Leuven in 1516. It was only translated into English and published in his native land in 1551 (16 years after his execution), and the 1684 translation became the most commonly cited. More (who is also a character in the book) and the narrator/traveller, Raphael Hythlodaeus (whose name alludes both to the healer archangel Raphael, and &#x27;speaker of nonsense&#x27;, the surname&#x27;s Greek meaning), discuss modern ills in Antwerp, as well as describe the political arrangements of the imaginary island country of Utopia (a Greek pun on &#x27;ou-topos&#x27; [no place] and &#x27;eu-topos&#x27; [good place]) among themselves as well as to Pieter Gillis and Hieronymus van Busleyden. Utopia&#x27;s original edition included a symmetrical &quot;Utopian alphabet&quot; omitted by later editions, but which may have been an early attempt or precursor of shorthand.

&quot;Utopia&quot; is structured into two parts, both with much irony: Book I has conversations between friends on various European political issues: the treatment of criminals, the enclosure movement, etc.; Book II is a remembered discourse by Raphael Hythlodaeus on his supposed travels, in which the earlier issues are revisited in fantastical but concrete forms that has been called &quot;mythical idealism&quot;. For example, the proposition in the Book I &quot;no republic can be prosperous or justly governed where there is private property and money is the measure of everything.&quot;

&quot;Utopia&quot; contrasts the contentious social life of European states with the perfectly orderly, reasonable social arrangements of Utopia and its environs (Tallstoria, Nolandia, and Aircastle). In Utopia, there are no lawyers because of the laws&#x27; simplicity and because social gatherings are in public view (encouraging participants to behave well), communal ownership supplants private property, men and women are educated alike, and there is almost complete religious toleration (except for atheists, who are allowed but despised).

More may have used monastic communalism as his model, although other concepts he presents such as legalising euthanasia remain far outside Church doctrine. Hythlodaeus asserts that a man who refuses to believe in a god or an afterlife could never be trusted, because he would not acknowledge any authority or principle outside himself. A scholar has suggested that More is most interested in the type of citizen Utopia produces.

Some take the novel&#x27;s principal message to be the social need for order and discipline rather than liberty. Ironically, Hythlodaeus, who believes philosophers should not get involved in politics, addresses More&#x27;s ultimate conflict between his humanistic beliefs and courtly duties as the King&#x27;s servant, pointing out that one day those morals will come into conflict with the political reality.

&quot;Utopia&quot; gave rise to a literary genre, Utopian and dystopian fiction, which features ideal societies or perfect cities, or their opposite. Works influenced by &quot;Utopia&quot; included &quot;New Atlantis&quot; by Francis Bacon, &quot;Erewhon&quot; by Samuel Butler, and &quot;Candide&quot; by Voltaire. Although Utopianism combined classical concepts of perfect societies (Plato and Aristotle) with Roman rhetorical finesse (cf. Cicero, Quintilian, epideictic oratory), the Renaissance genre continued into the Age of Enlightenment and survives in modern science fiction.

=== Religious polemics ===
In 1520 the reformer Martin Luther published three works in quick succession: &quot;An Appeal to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation&quot; (Aug.), &quot;Concerning the Babylonish Captivity of the Church&quot; (Oct.), and &quot;On the Liberty of a Christian Man&quot; (Nov.). In these books, Luther set out his doctrine of salvation through faith alone, rejected certain Catholic practices, and attacked abuses and excesses within the Catholic Church. In 1521, Henry VIII formally responded to Luther&#x27;s criticisms with the &quot;Assertio&quot;, written with More&#x27;s assistance. Pope Leo X rewarded the English king with the title &quot;Fidei defensor&quot; (&quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;) for his work combating Luther&#x27;s heresies.

Martin Luther then attacked Henry VIII in print, calling him a &quot;pig, dolt, and liar&quot;. At the King&#x27;s request, More composed a rebuttal: the &quot;Responsio ad Lutherum&quot; was published at the end of 1523. In the &quot;Responsio&quot;, More defended papal supremacy, the sacraments, and other Church traditions. More, though considered &quot;a much steadier personality&quot;, described Luther as an &quot;ape&quot;, a &quot;drunkard&quot;, and a &quot;lousy little friar&quot; amongst other epithets. Writing under the pseudonym of Gulielmus Rosseus, More tells Luther that:

:for as long as your reverend paternity will be determined to tell these shameless lies, others will be permitted, on behalf of his English majesty, to throw back into your paternity&#x27;s shitty mouth, truly the shit-pool of all shit, all the muck and shit which your damnable rottenness has vomited up, and to empty out all the sewers and privies onto your crown divested of the dignity of the priestly crown, against which no less than the kingly crown you have determined to play the buffoon.

His saying is followed with a kind of apology to his readers, while Luther possibly never apologized for his sayings. Stephen Greenblatt argues, &quot;More speaks for his ruler and in his opponent&#x27;s idiom; Luther speaks for himself, and his scatological imagery far exceeds in quantity, intensity, and inventiveness anything that More could muster. If for More scatology normally expresses a communal disapproval, for Luther, it expresses a deep personal rage.&quot;

Confronting Luther confirmed More&#x27;s theological conservatism. He thereafter avoided any hint of criticism of Church authority. In 1528, More published another religious polemic, &quot;A Dialogue Concerning Heresies&quot;, that asserted the Catholic Church was the one true church, established by Christ and the Apostles, and affirmed the validity of its authority, traditions and practices. In 1529, the circulation of Simon Fish&#x27;s &quot;Supplication for the Beggars&quot; prompted More to respond with the &quot;Supplycatyon of Soulys&quot;.

In 1531, a year after More&#x27;s father died, William Tyndale published &quot;An Answer unto Sir Thomas More&#x27;s Dialogue&quot; in response to More&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue Concerning Heresies.&quot; More responded with a half million words: the &quot;Confutation of Tyndale&#x27;s Answer&quot;. The &quot;Confutation&quot; is an imaginary dialogue between More and Tyndale, with More addressing each of Tyndale&#x27;s criticisms of Catholic rites and doctrines. More, who valued structure, tradition and order in society as safeguards against tyranny and error, vehemently believed that Lutheranism and the Protestant Reformation in general were dangerous, not only to the Catholic faith but to the stability of society as a whole.

=== Correspondence ===
Most major humanists were prolific letter writers, and Thomas More was no exception. As in the case of his friend Erasmus of Rotterdam, however, only a small portion of his correspondence (about 280 letters) survived. These include everything from personal letters to official government correspondence (mostly in English), letters to fellow humanist scholars (in Latin), several epistolary tracts, verse epistles, prefatory letters (some fictional) to several of More&#x27;s own works, letters to More&#x27;s children and their tutors (in Latin), and the so-called &quot;prison-letters&quot; (in English) which he exchanged with his oldest daughter Margaret while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London awaiting execution. More also engaged in controversies, most notably with the French poet Germain de Brie, which culminated in the publication of de Brie&#x27;s &quot;Antimorus&quot; (1519). Erasmus intervened, however, and ended the dispute.

More also wrote about more spiritual matters. They include: &quot;A Treatise on the Passion&quot; (a.k.a. Treatise on the Passion of Christ), &quot;A Treatise to Receive the Blessed Body&quot; (a.k.a. Holy Body Treaty), and &quot;De Tristitia Christi&quot; (a.k.a. The Agony of Christ). More handwrote the last in the Tower of London while awaiting his execution. This last manuscript, saved from the confiscation decreed by Henry VIII, passed by the will of his daughter Margaret to Spanish hands through Fray Pedro de Soto, dominican confessor of the count of Oropesa ambassador of the Emperor Charles V, that presented to saint Juan de Ribera archbishop of Valencia at that time and founder of Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi and its museum where it remains in the collection.

==Veneration==
=== Catholic Church ===
Pope Leo XIII beatified Thomas More, John Fisher, and 52 other English Martyrs on 29 December 1886. Pope Pius XI canonised More and Fisher on 19 May 1935, and More&#x27;s feast day was established as 9 July. Since 1970 the General Roman Calendar has celebrated More with St John Fisher on 22 June (the date of Fisher&#x27;s execution). On 31 October 2000 Pope John Paul II declared More &quot;the heavenly Patron of Statesmen and Politicians&quot;. More is the patron of the German Catholic youth organisation Katholische Junge Gemeinde.

It is reported that the canonization ceremony was greeted with a &quot;minimal and hostile&quot; treatment by the British press, and officially boycotted by the parliament and universities.

=== Anglican Communion ===
In 1980, despite their staunch opposition to the English Reformation, More and Fisher were added as martyrs of the reformation to the Church of England&#x27;s calendar of &quot;Saints and Heroes of the Christian Church&quot;, to be commemorated every 6 July (the date of More&#x27;s execution) as &quot;Thomas More, scholar, and John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, Reformation Martyrs, 1535&quot;. The annual remembrance of 6 July, is recognized by all Anglican Churches in communion with Canterbury, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, and South Africa.

In an essay examining the events around the addition to the Anglican calendar, Scholar Bill Sheils links the reasoning for More&#x27;s recognition to a &quot;long-standing tradition hinted at in Rose Macaulay&#x27;s ironic debating point of 1935 about More&#x27;s status as an &#x27;unschismed Anglican&#x27;, a tradition also recalled in the annual memorial lecture held at St. Dunstan&#x27;s Church in Canterbury, where More&#x27;s head is said to be buried.&quot; Sheils also noted the influence of the 1960s play and film &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; which gave More a &quot;reputation as a defender of the right of conscience&quot;. Thanks to the play&#x27;s depiction, this &quot;brought his life to a broader and more popular audience&quot; with the film &quot;extending its impact worldwide following the Oscar triumphs&quot;. Around this time the atheist Oxford historian and public intellectual, Hugh Trevor-Roper held More up as &quot;the first great Englishman whom we feel that we know, the most saintly of Humanists...the universal man of our cool northern Renaissance.&quot; By 1978, the quincentenary of More&#x27;s birth Trevor-Roper wrote an essay putting More in the Renaissance Platonist tradition, and claim his reputation was &quot;quite independent of his Catholicism.&quot; (Only, later on, did a more critical view arise in academia, led by Professor Sir Geoffrey Elton, which &quot;challenged More&#x27;s reputation for saintliness by focusing on his dealings with heretics, the ferocity of which, in fairness to him, More did not deny. In this research, More&#x27;s role as a prosecutor, or persecutor, of dissidents has been at the center of the debate.&quot;)

== Legacy ==
The steadfastness and courage with which More maintained his religious convictions, and his dignity during his imprisonment, trial, and execution, contributed much to More&#x27;s posthumous reputation, particularly among Roman Catholics. His friend Erasmus defended More&#x27;s character as &quot;more pure than any snow&quot; and described his genius as &quot;such as England never had and never again will have.&quot; Upon learning of More&#x27;s execution, Emperor Charles V said: &quot;Had we been master of such a servant, we would rather have lost the best city of our dominions than such a worthy councillor.&quot;

G. K. Chesterton, a Roman Catholic convert from the Church of England, predicted More &quot;may come to be counted the greatest Englishman, or at least the greatest historical character in English history.&quot; He wrote &quot;the mind of More was like a diamond that a tyrant threw away into a ditch, because he could not break it.&quot;

Historian Hugh Trevor-Roper called More &quot;the first great Englishman whom we feel that we know, the most saintly of humanists, the most human of saints, the universal man of our cool northern renaissance.&quot;

Jonathan Swift, an Anglican, wrote that More was &quot;a person of the greatest virtue this kingdom ever produced&quot;. Some consider this quote to be of Samuel Johnson, although it is not found in Johnson&#x27;s writings. Swift put More in the company of Socrates, Brutus, Epaminondas and Junius.

The metaphysical poet John Donne, also honoured in their calendar by Anglicans, was More&#x27;s great-great-nephew.

US Senator Eugene McCarthy had a portrait of More in his office.
Marxist theoreticians such as Karl Kautsky considered More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot; a critique of economic and social exploitation in pre-modern Europe and More is claimed to have influenced the development of socialist ideas.

In 1963, &quot;Moreana&quot;, an academic journal focusing on analysis of More and his writings, was founded.

In 2002, More was placed at number 37 in the BBC&#x27;s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.

=== Legal ===
More debated the lawyer and pamphleteer Christopher St. Germain through various books: while agreeing on various issues on equity, More disagreed with secret witnesses, the admissibility of hearsay, and found St Germain&#x27;s criticism of religious courts superficial or ignorant. More and St Germain&#x27;s views on equity owed in part to the 15th-century humanist theologian, Jean Gerson, who taught that consideration of the individual circumstances should be the norm not the exception.

Before More, English Lord Chancellors tended to be clerics (with a role as Keeper of the King&#x27;s Conscience); from More on, they tended to be lawyers.

A 1999 poll of legal British professionals nominated More as the person who most embodies the virtues of the law needed at the close of the millennium. The virtues were More&#x27;s views on the primacy of conscience and his role in the practical establishment of the principle of equity in English secular law through the Court of Chancery.

=== In literature and popular culture ===
William Roper&#x27;s biography of More (his father-in-law) was one of the first biographies in Modern English.

&quot;Sir Thomas More&quot; is a play written circa 1592 in collaboration between Henry Chettle, Anthony Munday, William Shakespeare, and others. In it More is portrayed as a wise and honest statesman. The original manuscript has survived as a handwritten text that shows many revisions by its several authors, as well as the censorious influence of Edmund Tylney, Master of the Revels in the government of Queen Elizabeth I. The script has since been published and has had several productions.

In Europe in the two centuries after his death, there were at least 50 Neo-Latin school plays written about More, performed at Jesuit schools.

In 1941, the 20th-century British author Elizabeth Goudge (1900–1984) wrote a short story, &quot;The King&#x27;s Servant&quot;, based on the last few years of Thomas More&#x27;s life, seen through his family, and especially his adopted daughter, Anne Cresacre More.

The 20th-century agnostic playwright Robert Bolt portrayed Thomas More as the tragic hero of his 1960 play &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;. The title is drawn from what Robert Whittington in 1520 wrote of More:

More is a man of an angel&#x27;s wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness and affability? And, as time requireth, a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes, and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons.

In 1966, the play &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; was adapted into a film with the same title. It was directed by Fred Zinnemann and adapted for the screen by the playwright. It stars Paul Scofield, a noted British actor, who said that the part of Sir Thomas More was &quot;the most difficult part I played.&quot; The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Scofield won the Best Actor Oscar. In 1988 Charlton Heston starred in and directed a made-for-television film that restored the character of &quot;the common man&quot; that had been cut from the 1966 film.

In the 1969 film &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot;, More is portrayed by actor William Squire.

In the 1972 BBC TV series &quot;Henry VIII and his Six Wives&quot; More was played by Michael Goodliffe.

Catholic science fiction writer R. A. Lafferty wrote his novel &quot;Past Master&quot; as a modern equivalent to More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot;, which he saw as a satire. In this novel, Thomas More travels through time to the year 2535, where he is made king of the world &quot;Astrobe&quot;, only to be beheaded after ruling for a mere nine days. One character compares More favourably to almost every other major historical figure: &quot;He had one completely honest moment right at the end. I cannot think of anyone else who ever had one.&quot;

Karl Zuchardt&#x27;s novel, &quot;Stirb du Narr!&quot; (&quot;Die you fool!&quot;), about More&#x27;s struggle with King Henry, portrays More as an idealist bound to fail in the power struggle with a ruthless ruler and an unjust world.

In her 2009 novel &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;, its 2012 sequel &quot;Bring Up the Bodies&quot;, and the final book of the trilogy, her 2020 &quot;The Mirror &amp; the Light&quot;, the novelist Hilary Mantel portrays More (from the perspective of a sympathetically portrayed Thomas Cromwell) as an unsympathetic persecutor of Protestants and an ally of the Habsburg empire.

Literary critic James Wood in his book &quot;The Broken Estate&quot;, a collection of essays, is critical of More and refers to him as &quot;cruel in punishment, evasive in argument, lusty for power, and repressive in politics&quot;.

Aaron S. Zelman&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;The State Versus the People&quot; includes a comparison of &quot;Utopia&quot; with Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. Zelman is undecided as to whether More was being ironic in his book or was genuinely advocating a police state. Zelman comments, &quot;More is the only Christian saint to be honoured with a statue at the Kremlin.&quot; By this Zelman implies that &quot;Utopia&quot; influenced Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Bolsheviks, despite their brutal repression of religion.

Other biographers, such as Peter Ackroyd, have offered a more sympathetic picture of More as both a sophisticated philosopher and man of letters, as well as a zealous Catholic who believed in the authority of the Holy See over Christendom.

The protagonist of Walker Percy&#x27;s novels, &quot;Love in the Ruins&quot; and &quot;The Thanatos Syndrome&quot;, is &quot;Dr Thomas More&quot;, a reluctant Catholic and descendant of More.

More is the focus of the Al Stewart song &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot; from the 1978 album &quot;Time Passages&quot;, and of the Far song &quot;Sir&quot;, featured on the limited editions and 2008 re-release of their 1994 album &quot;Quick&quot;. In addition, the song &quot;So Says I&quot; by indie rock outfit The Shins alludes to the socialist interpretation of More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot;.

Jeremy Northam depicts More in the television series &quot;The Tudors &quot;as a peaceful man, as well as a devout Roman Catholic and loving family patriarch.

In David Starkey&#x27;s 2009 documentary series &quot;Henry VIII: The Mind of a Tyrant&quot;, More is depicted by Ryan Kiggell.

More is depicted by Andrew Buchan in the television series &quot;The Spanish Princess&quot;.

In the years 1968–2007 the University of San Francisco&#x27;s Gleeson Library Associates awarded the annual Sir Thomas More Medal for Book Collecting to private book collectors of note, including Elmer Belt, Otto Schaefer, Albert Sperisen, John S. Mayfield and Lord Wardington.

In the 2024 video game, , the narrative focuses on a book depicting a fictional utopia written by a character named More.

=== Institutions named after More ===
=== Communism, socialism and anti-communism ===
Having been praised &quot;as a Communist hero by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Karl Kautsky&quot; because of the Communist attitude to property in his &quot;Utopia&quot;, under Soviet Communism the name of Thomas More was in ninth position from the top of Moscow&#x27;s Stele of Freedom (also known as the Obelisk of Revolutionary Thinkers), as one of the most influential thinkers &quot;who promoted the liberation of humankind from oppression, arbitrariness, and exploitation.&quot; This monument was erected in 1918 in Aleksandrovsky Garden near the Kremlin at Lenin&#x27;s suggestion.

&quot;The Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot;&#x27;s English translation (1979) described More as &quot;the founder of Utopian socialism&quot;, the first person &quot;to describe a society in which private property ... had been abolished&quot; (a society in which the family was &quot;a cell for the communist way of life&quot;), and a thinker who &quot;did not believe that the ideal society would be achieved through revolution&quot;, but who &quot;greatly influenced reformers of subsequent centuries, especially Morelly, G. Babeuf, Saint-Simon, C. Fourier, E. Cabet, and other representatives of Utopian socialism.&quot;

&quot;Utopia&quot; also inspired socialists such as William Morris.

Many see More&#x27;s communism or socialism as purely satirical. In 1888, while praising More&#x27;s communism, Karl Kautsky pointed out that &quot;perplexed&quot; historians and economists often saw the name &quot;Utopia&quot; (which means &quot;no place&quot;) as &quot;a subtle hint by More that he himself regarded his communism as an impracticable dream&quot;.

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the Russian Nobel Prize-winning, anti-Communist author of &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;, argued that Soviet communism needed enslavement and forced labour to survive, and that this had been &quot; ...foreseen as far back as Thomas More, the great-grandfather of socialism, in his &quot;Utopia&quot;&quot;.

In 2008, More was portrayed on stage in Hong Kong as an allegorical symbol of the pan-democracy camp resisting the Chinese Communist Party in a translated and modified version of Robert Bolt&#x27;s play &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;.

== Historic sites ==
=== Westminster Hall ===
A plaque in the middle of the floor of London&#x27;s Westminster Hall commemorates More&#x27;s trial for treason and condemnation to execution in that original part of the Palace of Westminster. The building, which houses Parliament, would have been well known to More, who served several terms as a member and became Speaker of the House of Commons before his appointment as England&#x27;s Lord Chancellor.

===Beaufort House===

As More&#x27;s royal duties frequently required his attendance at the King&#x27;s Thames-side palaces in both Richmond and Greenwich, it was convenient to select a riverside property situated between them (the common method of transport being by boat) for his home. In about 1520 he purchased a parcel of land comprising &quot;undisturbed wood and pasture&quot;, stretching from the Thames in Chelsea to the present-day King&#x27;s Road. There he caused to be built a dignified red-brick mansion (known simply as More&#x27;s house or Chelsea House) in which he lived until his arrest in 1534. In the bawdy poem &quot;The Twelve Mery Jestes of Wyddow Edyth&quot;, written in 1525 by a member of More&#x27;s household (or even by More himself) using the pseudonym of &quot;Walter Smith&quot;, the widow arrives by boat at &quot;Chelsay...where she had best cheare of all/in the house of Syr Thomas More.&quot;

Upon More&#x27;s arrest the estate was confiscated, coming into the possession of the Comptroller of the Royal Household, William Paulet.

In 1682, the property was renamed &quot;Beaufort House&quot; after 1st Duke of Beaufort, a new owner.

===Crosby Hall===
In June 1523 More bought the &quot;very large and beautiful&quot; Crosby Place (Crosby Hall) in Bishopsgate, London, but this was not a simple transaction: eight months later he sold the property (never having lived there) at a considerable profit to his friend and business partner Antonio Bonvisi who, in turn, leased it back to More&#x27;s son-in-law William Roper and nephew William Rastell; possibly this was an agreed means of dealing with a debt between More and Bonvisi. Because of this the Crown did not confiscate the property after More&#x27;s execution.

=== Chelsea Old Church ===
Across a small park and Old Church Street from Crosby Hall is Chelsea Old Church, an Anglican church whose southern chapel More commissioned and in which he sang with the parish choir. Except for his chapel, the church was largely destroyed in the Second World War and rebuilt in 1958. The capitals on the medieval arch connecting the chapel to the main sanctuary display symbols associated with More and his office. On the southern wall of the sanctuary is the tomb and epitaph he erected for himself and his wives, detailing his ancestry and accomplishments in Latin, including his role as peacemaker between the various Christian European states as well as a curiously altered portion about his curbing heresy. When More served Mass, he would leave by the door just to the left of it. He is not, however, buried here, nor is it entirely certain which of his family may be. It is open to the public at specific times. Outside the church, facing the River Thames, is a statue by British Sculptor, Leslie Cubitt Bevis erected in 1969, commemorating More as &quot;saint&quot;, &quot;scholar&quot;, and &quot;statesman&quot;; the back displays his coat-of-arms. Nearby, on Upper Cheyne Row, the Roman Catholic Church of Our Most Holy Redeemer &amp; St. Thomas More honours the martyr.

=== Tower Hill ===
A plaque and small garden commemorate the famed execution site on Tower Hill, London, just outside the Tower of London, as well as all those executed there, many as religious martyrs or as prisoners of conscience. More&#x27;s corpse, minus his head, was unceremoniously buried in an unmarked mass grave beneath the Royal Chapel of St. Peter Ad Vincula, within the walls of the Tower of London, as was the custom for traitors executed at Tower Hill. The chapel is accessible to Tower visitors.

=== St Katharine Docks ===
Thomas More is commemorated by a stone plaque near St Katharine Docks, just east of the Tower where he was executed. The street in which it is situated was formerly called Nightingale Lane, a corruption of &quot;Knighten Guild&quot;, derived from the original owners of the land. It is now renamed Thomas More Street in his honour.

=== St Dunstan&#x27;s Church and Roper House, Canterbury ===
St Dunstan&#x27;s Church, an Anglican parish church in Canterbury, possesses More&#x27;s head, rescued by his daughter Margaret Roper, whose family lived in Canterbury down and across the street from their parish church. A stone immediately to the left of the altar marks the sealed Roper family vault beneath the Nicholas Chapel, itself to the right of the church&#x27;s sanctuary or main altar. St Dunstan&#x27;s Church has carefully investigated, preserved and sealed this burial vault. The last archaeological investigation revealed that the suspected head of More rests in a niche separate from the other bodies, possibly from later interference. Displays in the chapel record the archaeological findings in pictures and narratives. Roman Catholics donated stained glass to commemorate the events in More&#x27;s life. A small plaque marks the former home of William and Margaret Roper; another house nearby and entitled Roper House is now a home for deaf people.

<text>Tierra del Fuego (, ; Spanish for &quot;Land of Fire&quot;, rarely also Fireland in English) is an archipelago off the southernmost tip of the South American mainland, across the Strait of Magellan. 

The archipelago consists of the main island, Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, with an area of , along with numerous smaller islands, including Cape Horn and Diego Ramírez Islands. The western part of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago, about two-thirds including its many islands, is part of Chile, and the eastern part is part of Argentina. The southernmost extent of the archipelago, Cape Horn, lies just north of latitude 56°S.

The earliest-known human settlement in Tierra del Fuego dates to approximately 8,000 BC. Europeans first explored the islands during Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s expedition of 1520. &quot;Tierra del Fuego&quot; (&quot;Land of Fire&quot;) and similar names stem from sightings of the many fires that the inhabitants built along the coastline and possibly even in their canoes for warmth and signaling.

Settlement by those of European descent and the displacement of the native populations did not begin until the second half of the nineteenth century, at the height of the Patagonian sheep farming boom and of the local gold rush. Today, petroleum extraction dominates economic activity in the north of Tierra del Fuego, while tourism, manufacturing, and Antarctic logistics are important in the south.

== History ==

===Prehistory===

The earliest human settlement occurred approximately 8,000 BC. The Yaghan were some of the earliest known humans to settle in Tierra del Fuego. Archeological sites with characteristics of their culture have been found at locations such as Navarino Island.

===European exploration===
The name &quot;Tierra del Fuego&quot; was given by the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan while sailing for the Spanish Crown in 1520; he was the first European to visit these lands. He believed he was seeing the many fires (&quot;fuego&quot; in Spanish) of the indigenous inhabitants, which were visible from the sea, and that the &quot;Indians&quot; were waiting in the forests to ambush his armada.

In 1525, Francisco de Hoces was the first to speculate that Tierra del Fuego was one or more islands rather than part of what was then called Terra Australis. Francis Drake in 1578 and a Dutch East India Company expedition in 1616 learned more about the geography. The latter expedition named Cape Horn at Hornos Island.

On his first voyage with in 1830, Robert FitzRoy picked up four native Fuegians, including &quot;Jemmy Button&quot; (&quot;Orundellico&quot;) and Yokcushlu, and brought them to England. The three who survived the voyage were taken to London to meet the king and queen and were, for a time, celebrities. They returned to Tierra del Fuego in the &quot;Beagle&quot; with FitzRoy and Charles Darwin, who made extensive notes about his visit to the islands.

===European colonization and extinction of Native Americans (1860–1910)===

During the second half of the nineteenth century, Salesian Catholic missions were established in Río Grande and Dawson Island.

Anglican missionaries, who had established missions on Keppel Island in 1855, established new missions in 1870 at Ushuaia. These missions continued to operate through the nineteenth century. Missionary Thomas Bridges (1842–1898) learned the native language and compiled a 30,000-word Yaghan grammar and dictionary while he worked at Ushuaia. It was published in the 20th century and is considered an important ethnological work.

An 1879 Chilean expedition led by Ramón Serrano Montaner reported large amounts of placer gold in the streams and river beds of Tierra del Fuego. This prompted massive immigration to the main island between 1883 and 1909. Numerous Argentines, Chileans, and Croatians settled on the main island, leading to increased conflicts with native Selk&#x27;nam. These late nineteenth century gold rushes led to the founding of numerous small settlements by immigrants, such as the Argentine settlements of Ushuaia and Río Grande and the Chilean settlements of Porvenir and Puerto Toro.

Julius Popper, a Romanian explorer, was one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the region. Granted rights by the Argentine government to exploit any gold deposits he found in Tierra del Fuego, Popper has been identified as a central figure in the Selk&#x27;nam genocide.

Following contact with Europeans, the native Selk&#x27;nam and Yaghan populations were greatly reduced by unequal conflict and persecution by settlers, by infectious diseases to which the indigenous people had no immunity, and by mass transfer to the Salesian mission of Dawson Island. Despite the efforts of the missionaries, many natives died. Today, only a few Selk&#x27;nam remain. Some of the few remaining Yaghan have settled in Villa Ukika in Navarino Island; others have scattered throughout Chile and Argentina.

Following the signing of the Boundary Treaty of 1881, Tierra del Fuego was divided between Argentina and Chile; previously, it had been claimed in its entirety by both countries.

===Recent history (1940–present)===
In 1945, a division of Chilean CORFO (Spanish acronym for Production Development Corporation), engaged in oil exploration, discovered oil in northern Tierra del Fuego. Extraction began in 1949 and, in 1950, the Chile state-owned ENAP (National Petroleum Company). Until 1960, most oil extracted in Chile came from Tierra del Fuego. During the 1940s Chile and Argentina lodged their Antarctic claims. In the 1950s, the Chilean military founded Puerto Williams. In the 1960s and 1970s, sovereignty claims by Argentina over Picton, Lennox, and Nueva Islands in Tierra del Fuego led the two countries to the brink of war. In 1986, the Argentine congress decided that the Argentine part of Tierra del Fuego should be a new province. This happened in 26 April 1990.

== Geography ==


The archipelago consists of a main island, Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, often simply called Tierra del Fuego or Isla Grande, with an area of , and a group of smaller islands. Of the main island the westernmost 29,484.7 km2 (11,384, 61.43%) belongs to Chile, and 18,507.3 km2 (7,146, 38.57%) belongs to Argentina. The archipelago is divided by an east–west channel, the Beagle Channel, immediately south of the main island. The largest islands south of the Beagle Channel are Hoste and Navarino.

The western part of the main island, and almost all the other islands, belong to Chile. They are part of the Magallanes y Antártica Chilena Region, the capital and chief town of which is Punta Arenas, situated on the mainland across the strait. The largest Chilean towns are Porvenir, capital of the Chilean Province of Tierra del Fuego, located on the main island, and, on Navarino Island, Puerto Williams, which is the capital of the Antártica Chilena Province. 

Puerto Toro lies a few kilometers south of Puerto Williams. Arguably, it is the southernmost village in the world. The mostly uninhabited islands north and west of the main island are part of Magallanes Province.

The eastern part of the main island and a few small islands in the Beagle Channel belong to Argentina. They are part of the Tierra del Fuego, Antarctic Territory and South Atlantic Islands Province, whose capital is Ushuaia, the largest city of the archipelago. The other important city in the region is Río Grande on the Atlantic coast.

The Cordillera Darwin in the southwestern part of the main island contains many glaciers that reach the ocean. While Mount Darwin had previously been thought to be the tallest mountain in the archipelago, this distinction now belongs to the unofficially named Monte Shipton at .

The topography of Tierra del Fuego can be divided into four regions: an outer archipelago region () to the south and west, a mountainous region in the south (), a plains region () plus a sub-Andean zone in-between the last two zones ().

===Geology===

The geology of the archipelago is influenced by the effects of the Andean orogeny and the repeated Pleistocene glaciations. The geology of the island can be divided into large east–west-oriented units. The southwestern islands of the archipelago, including Cape Horn, are part of the South Patagonian Batholith, while the Cordillera Darwin and the area around the Beagle Channel form the principal mountain range hosting the highest mountains. The Magallanes fold and thrust belt extends north of Almirantazgo Fjord and Fagnano Lake, and north of this lies the Magallanes foreland, an old sedimentary basin that hosts hydrocarbon reserves. Orthogneiss dated at 525 million years is known to underlie some of the oil wells in northern Tierra del Fuego.

The Magallanes–Fagnano Fault, a sinistral strike slip fault crosses the southern part of the main island from west to east. It is an active fault, located inside and parallel to the Fuegian fold and thrust belt, and marks the boundary between a southern belt of Paleozoic meta sediments and a northern Mesozoic belt of sedimentary sequences. Fagnano Lake occupies a glacier-carved depression in a pull-apart basin that has developed along the Magallanes-Fagnano Fault zone.

Podzols and inceptisols occur beneath &quot;Nothofagus betuloides&quot; forests in Tierra del Fuego.

=== Climate ===

The Tierra del Fuego region has a subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfc&quot;) with short, cool summers and long, wet, moderately mild winters: the precipitation averages a year in the far west, but precipitation decreases rapidly towards the eastern side. Temperatures are steady throughout the year: in Ushuaia they hardly surpass in summers and average in winters. Snowfall can occur in summer. The cold and wet summers help preserve the ancient glaciers. The southernmost islands possess a sub-antarctic climate typical of tundra that makes the growth of trees impossible. Some areas in the interior have a polar climate. Regions in the world with similar climates to southern Tierra del Fuego are: the Aleutian islands, Iceland, the Alaska Peninsula, the Faroe Islands, Macquarie Island, and the Heard and McDonald Islands.

=== Flora ===

Only 30% of the islands have forests, which are classified as Magellanic subpolar. The northeastern portion of the region is made up of steppe and cool semi-desert.

Six species of tree are found in Tierra del Fuego: canelo or winter&#x27;s bark (&quot;Drimys winteri&quot;); &quot;Maytenus magellanica&quot;; &quot;Pilgerodendron uviferum&quot;, the southernmost conifer in the world; and three kinds of southern beech: &quot;Nothofagus antarctica&quot;; &quot;Nothofagus pumilio&quot;; and the evergreen &quot;Nothofagus betuloides&quot;. Several kinds of fruit grow in open spaces in these forests, such as beach strawberry (&quot;Fragaria chiloensis&quot; var. &quot;chiloensis&quot; forma &quot;chiloensis&quot;) and calafate (&quot;Berberis buxifolia&quot;), which have long been gathered by both Native Americans and residents of European descent.

They are the only forests in the world to have developed in a climate with such cold summers. Tree cover extends very close to the southernmost tip of South America. Winds are so strong that trees in wind-exposed areas grow into twisted shapes, inspiring people to call them &quot;flag-trees&quot;. Tree vegetation extends to the southern tip of the region, Isla Hornos, although the Wollaston Islands are mostly covered by subantarctic tundra except in wind sheltered areas where the trees can survive.

Forests from Tierra del Fuego have expanded beyond local importance. These forests have been a source of trees that have been transplanted abroad in places with similar climate, but which originally were devoid of trees, such as the Faroe Islands and nearby archipelagos. Most species were gathered from the coldest places in Tierra del Fuego, mainly sites with tundra borders. This effort resulted in positive changes, as the heavy winds and cool summers in the Faroe Islands did not allow the growth of trees from other regions in the world. The imported trees are used ornamentally, as curtains against wind, and to fight erosion caused by storms and grazing in the Faroe Islands.

=== Fauna ===


Among the most notable animals in the archipelago are austral parakeets, gulls, guanacos, South American foxes, kingfishers, Andean condors, king penguins, owls, and firecrown hummingbirds. Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego is also home to the lizard with the world&#x27;s southernmost distribution, &quot;Liolaemus magellanicus&quot;.

North American beavers, introduced during the 1940s, have proliferated and caused considerable damage to the island forests. The governments have established a wide-reaching program to trap and kill beavers in Tierra del Fuego.

Like the mainland of Chile and Argentina to the north, this archipelago boasts some of the finest trout fishing in the world. Sea-run brown trout often exceed , particularly in rivers such as the Rio Grande and the San Pablo, and in the Lago Fagnano. 

Waters adjacent to Tierra del Fuego are very rich in cetacean diversity. Sightings of southern right whales in Tierra del Fuego have increased in the 2000s, humpbacks, and some others such as blue whales, southern fins, southern seis, and southern minkes. Beagle Channel is a prominent area to watch rare, endemic dolphins, and the less-studied pygmy right whales.

Pinnipeds inhabiting the areas include South American sea lions (&quot;Otaria flavescens&quot;), South American fur seals (&quot;Arctophoca australis&quot;), the carnivorous and seal-eating leopard seals (&quot;Hydrurga leptonyx&quot;), and gigantic southern elephant seals (&quot;Mirounga leonine&quot;)the largest extant marine mammal that is not a cetacean.

== Economy ==
Today, the main economic activities of the archipelago are fishing, extraction of natural gas and oil, sheep farming, and ecotourism. Tourism is gaining increasing importance as it attracts numerous upmarket visitors. Much of the tourism is based on &quot;southernmost&quot; claims: for example, both Ushuaia and Puerto Williams claim to be the &quot;southernmost city in the world&quot;. On the Argentine side of Tierra del Fuego, the government has promoted the establishment of several electronic companies via tax exemptions, particularly in the city of Río Grande.

Energy production is a crucial economic activity. On the Argentine side of Tierra del Fuego during the period 2005–2010, petroleum and natural gas extraction contributed 20% of the region&#x27;s economic output.

<text>The Sims is a social simulation video game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts in 2000. The game allows players to create and control virtual people, called &quot;Sims&quot;, and manage their daily lives in a suburban setting. The game features an open-ended gameplay, where players can choose their own goals and objectives, and customize their Sims&#x27; appearance, personality, skills, relationships, and environment. A series of expansion packs were also released that add new content and features to the game, such as new careers, items, locations, and scenarios.

The game&#x27;s development was led by Will Wright, and the game was a follow-up to Wright&#x27;s earlier &quot;SimCity&quot; series. Wright was inspired to create the game by Christopher Alexander&#x27;s 1977 book &quot;A Pattern Language&quot;, and Scott McCloud&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;Understanding Comics&quot; later played a role in the game&#x27;s design. Seven expansion packs were released from 2000 to 2003, each of which added new items, characters, skins, and features.

Upon release, &quot;The Sims&quot; garnered widespread critical acclaim and was described by Wright as being successful in attracting casual male and female gamers. The game is regarded as one of the most influential and greatest games of all time. It won several awards and placed 31st on &quot;Time&quot;″s The 50 Best Video Games of All Time list. The game has also been commercially successful, being one of the best-selling PC games of all time with 11.5 million copies sold. Several sequels in &quot;The Sims&quot; series have been released —&quot;The Sims 2&quot; in 2004, &quot;The Sims 3&quot; in 2009, and &quot;The Sims 4&quot; in 2014.

==Gameplay==
The structure of the game is an artificial life program that is agent-based. The presentation of the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence is advanced, and the Sims will respond to outside conditions independently, although often the player&#x27;s intervention is necessary to keep the Sims on the right track. &quot;The Sims&quot; technically has unlimited replay value, in that there is no way to truly win the game, and the player can play indefinitely. It has been described as more like a toy than a game.

Sims are influenced by the player to interact with objects or other Sims. Sims may receive guests at their home lot, invited or not, from other playable lots, or from unhoused non-player character (NPC) Sims. If enabled in the game&#x27;s options, Sims have a certain amount of free will, allowing them to autonomously interact with their world; however, the player can override most of these autonomous actions by canceling them in the action queue at the top of the screen. Unlike the simulated environments in games such as &quot;SimCity&quot;, &quot;SimEarth&quot;, or &quot;SimLife&quot;, Sims are not fully autonomous. They are unable to take certain actions without specific commands, such as paying bills, finding a job, exercising, and conceiving children. Sims communicate in a fictional language called Simlish, which is mostly composed of blowing raspberries and saying nonsense.
The player can make decisions about time spent in skill development, such as exercise, reading, creativity, and logic by adding activities to Sims&#x27; daily agenda. Daily needs such as hygiene and eating can and must also be scheduled. Although Sims can autonomously perform these actions, they may not prioritize them effectively and can suffer consequences for neglecting their own needs. In addition, Sims must maintain balanced budgets and usually supplement an income by obtaining a job. Sims may earn promotions by fulfilling skills and maintaining friendships with others for each level, which lead to new job titles, increased wages, and different work hours. Alternatively, Sims may create and sell various artwork and items at home.
While there is no eventual objective to the game, states of failure do exist in &quot;The Sims&quot;. One is that Sims may die, either by starvation, drowning, fire, or electrocution (or from natural causes/age in certain versions). When a Sim dies, a tombstone or an urn will appear (in later expansion packs, the Grim Reaper will appear first), and the ghost of the deceased Sim may haunt the building where it died. In addition, Sims can leave the game for good and never return. If two adult Sims with a bad relationship brawl often, it may result in one of them moving out. Children will be sent away to military school if they fail their classes. Lastly, not fulfilling a baby Sim&#x27;s needs will result in a social care worker permanently taking the baby away from the household.

===Building tools===
When the &quot;Live&quot; mode occurs in the game, the player may enter &quot;Build&quot; mode or &quot;Buy&quot; mode to pause time and renovate the house or lot. When the game begins, each family starts off with 20,000 &quot;simoleons&quot; (regardless of its number of members). These funds can be used to purchase a small house or vacant lot on the neighborhood screen. After purchasing a lot, a user may construct or remodel a house in Build mode or purchase or move furniture in Buy mode. All architectural and customizable features and furnishings in Build and Buy modes follow a square-tile system in which items must be placed on a tile. Walls and fences extend along the edge of a tile and can follow the edge of the tile or cross it diagonally, but furniture items cannot be placed on either side of a crossed tile. The base game contains over 150 items, including furniture and architectural elements.

In addition, the game includes an architecture system. The game was originally designed solely as an architecture simulator, with the Sims there only to evaluate the houses, but during development, it was decided that the Sims were more interesting than originally anticipated, and their once-limited role in the game was developed further. Players have a broad choice of objects that their respective Sims may purchase. Objects fall into one of eight broad categories: seating, surfaces, decorations, electronics, appliances, plumbing, lighting, and miscellaneous.

==Development==

The original inspiration for &quot;The Sims&quot; was Christopher Alexander&#x27;s 1977 book on architecture and urban design, &quot;A Pattern Language&quot;. Game designer Will Wright was inspired by the book&#x27;s focus on functionality in architecture, as Alexander based his design principles on structural usability rather than aesthetic values. Wright wanted to create a simulation game about enabling human behavior and interaction through design. Scott McCloud&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;Understanding Comics&quot; became a big influence on the design of &quot;The Sims&quot; later on, as it advocates a certain type of &quot;collaboration&quot; between designer and consumer and outlines the value of abstraction for getting readers or players involved with a story.

Will Wright started working on &quot;The Sims&quot; after releasing &quot;SimAnt&quot; in 1991. It was during that same year that he lost his home during the Oakland firestorm of 1991, and he incorporated his experience of rebuilding his life into the game; however, the game&#x27;s concept was very poorly received by a focus group, so Wright had difficulty getting the project off the ground. He managed to convince his company to let him work on the project (codenamed &quot;Project X&quot; at the time) in the background while developing &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; and &quot;SimCopter&quot;. He was lent one programmer for the project, Jamie Doornbos, who went on to become the lead programmer for &quot;The Sims&quot;. During the first few years of the project, Wright and Doornbos were primarily developing an open-ended system of character behavior. As the project continued, Wright found that the social aspect of the game turned out to be highly engaging, and the team started to focus more on the characters of the game, such as by letting Sims visit one another&#x27;s houses and by implementing long-term relationships.

Wright has mentioned playing &quot;Little Computer People&quot; and receiving valuable feedback on &quot;The Sims&quot; from several people involved with the game including its designer, Rich Gold. A demo of the game was presented at the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo. During a displaying in front of the press, two female characters at an in-game wedding fell in love and kissed each other. After the event, the relationship mechanics were further modified so the character&#x27;s sexual orientation was set depending on the player&#x27;s actions. &quot;The Sims&quot; uses a combination of 3D and 2D graphics techniques. The Sims themselves are rendered in 3D, whereas the house and all its objects are pre-rendered and displayed diametrically. For the game&#x27;s Japanese release, the game was renamed to SimPeople (シムピープル) to match the naming conventions of the other &quot;Sim&quot; games from Maxis.

===Music===
The game music was composed by Jerry Martin, Marc Russo, Kirk R. Casey, and Dix Bruce, with additional participation from jazz pianist John R. Burr for the songs used in the game&#x27;s Build Mode. The game disc contains 37 tracks, of which 15 were published in 2007 as an official soundtrack album. Most of the tracks contain no vocals, but some of them feature Simlish lyrics.

In recent years, critics have praised and noted the game&#x27;s use of new age and jazz music.

===Modding scene===
&quot;The Sims&quot; is credited with opening up modding to a new demographic, making it easy enough for &quot;casual modders&quot; to modify the game. &quot;The Sims&quot; was designed in a way that it would be easy to add user-created content (also known as custom content or &quot;CC&quot;) to the game, with Will Wright stating in an interview that he wanted to put the player in the design role. Websites for downloading CCs and mods include The Sims Resource and Mod The Sims. Maxis released modding tools for &quot;The Sims&quot; before the game itself, resulting in a suite of fan-created mods being available at launch.

==Expansion packs==
&quot;The Sims&quot; had a total of seven expansion packs released in its lifecycle. Each expansion generally adds new items, neighborhoods, characters, skins, and features.

=== Core game editions ===
===Expansion-only compilations===
==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;The Sims&quot; received &quot;universal acclaim&quot; according to review aggregator Metacritic, which assigned the game a score of 92%. The game received praise for its open-ended gameplay allowing players to choose their own goals and objectives, as well as its sound design, &quot;crisp&quot; graphics, and humor. Reviewers positively compared &quot;The Sims&quot; to Maxis&#x27; 1999 title &quot;SimCity 3000&quot;. GameSpot assigned a review of 9.1/10, describing it as &quot;highly detailed&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; gave the game a score of 9.4/10, and praised its easy-to-use user interface. Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the PC version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five and saying: &quot;Do not miss. Run do not walk. And set aside lots of time.&quot;

Will Wright, the game&#x27;s designer, said the game has been a success in many ways—attracting casual gamers and female gamers (the latter making up almost 60% of players). In 2012, the game was one of 14 video games selected by the Museum of Modern Art as the basis for an intended collection of 40 games. The PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube ports received scores ranging from 81.05% to 85.80% on GameRankings.

===Awards===
&quot;The Sims&quot; has won numerous awards, including &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s &quot;Game of the Year Award&quot; for 2000. During the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards (since 2013 known as the D.I.C.E. Awards), &quot;The Sims&quot; won &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Game Design&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering&quot; (along with nominations for &quot;Computer Family Entertainment Title of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction&quot;). &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked it the 80th best game ever made in its 100th issue in 2001. In 2005, &quot;The Sims&quot; was inducted into &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s list of the greatest games of all time. In 2016, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;The Sims&quot; to its World Video Game Hall of Fame. In August 2016, &quot;The Sims&quot; placed 31st on &quot;Time&quot;″s &quot;50 Best Video Games of All Time&quot; list. In 2019, it was ranked 17th on &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s &quot;50 Best Video Games of the 21st Century&quot; list.

===Sales===
&quot;The Sims&quot; was released on February 4, 2000, and became a best-seller shortly after launch. In the United States, it was the best-selling computer game of 2000, with domestic sales of 1.77 million units and revenues of $72.9 million. It remained the country&#x27;s No. 1 computer title in 2001, when it sold an additional 1.48 million units and earned another $60.4 million in revenue. In 2002, &quot;The Sims&quot; became the top-selling PC game in history at the time, displacing &quot;Myst&quot; by selling more than 6.3 million copies worldwide.

By February 2005, the game had shipped 16 million copies worldwide. By July 2006, the console versions of &quot;The Sims&quot; series had sold a combined 3.5 million units in the United States. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked &quot;The Sims&quot; as the 45th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in the United States. As of March 2015, &quot;The Sims&quot; had sold more than 11.24 million copies for PC, making it one of the best-selling PC games of all time.

==Sequels and legacy==

&quot;The Sims&quot; was followed by the sequels &quot;The Sims 2&quot; (2004), &quot;The Sims 3&quot; (2009), and &quot;The Sims 4&quot; (2014). The console versions of &quot;The Sims&quot; were each followed by a sequel, &quot;The Sims Bustin&#x27; Out&quot; (2003), and a spin-off game, &quot;The Urbz: Sims in the City&quot; (2004). These versions incorporate some features of later PC expansion packs, and &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out&quot; adds a multiplayer mode supporting two simultaneous players. When completing the game, Will Wright dedicated &quot;The Sims&quot; to the late Danielle Bunten Berry, an influential trans game designer known for her innovation and contributions to multiplayer gaming.

<text>A turbomolecular pump is a type of vacuum pump, superficially similar to a turbopump, used to obtain and maintain high vacuum. These pumps work on the principle that gas molecules can be given momentum in a desired direction by repeated collision with a moving solid surface. In a turbomolecular pump, a rapidly spinning fan rotor &#x27;hits&#x27; gas molecules from the inlet of the pump towards the exhaust in order to create or maintain a vacuum.

==Operating principles==
Most turbomolecular pumps employ multiple stages, each consisting of a quickly rotating rotor blade and stationary stator blade pair. The system is an axial compressor that puts energy into the gas, rather than a turbine, which takes energy out of a moving fluid to create rotary power, thus &quot;turbomolecular pump&quot; is a misnomer. Gas captured by the upper stages is pushed into the lower stages and successively compressed to the level of the fore-vacuum (backing pump) pressure.
As the gas molecules enter through the inlet, the rotor, which has a number of angled blades, hits the molecules. Thus the mechanical energy of the blades is transferred to the gas molecules. With this newly acquired momentum, the gas molecules enter into the gas transfer holes in the stator. This leads them to the next stage where they again collide with the rotor surface, and this process is continued, finally leading them outwards through the exhaust.

Because of the relative motion of rotor and stator, molecules preferentially hit the lower side of the blades. Because the blade surface looks down, most of the scattered molecules will leave it downwards. The surface is rough, so no reflection will occur. A blade needs to be thick and stable enough for high pressure operation and as thin as possible and slightly bent for maximum compression. For high compression ratios the throat between adjacent rotor blades (as shown in the image) is pointing as much as possible in the forward direction. For high flow rates the blades are at 45° and reach close to the axis.

Because the compression of each stage is ≈10, each stage closer to the outlet is considerably smaller than the preceding inlet stages. This has two consequences. The geometric progression tells us that infinite stages could ideally fit into a finite axial length. The finite length in this case is the full height of the housing as the bearings, the motor, and controller and some of the coolers can be installed inside on the axis. Radially, to grasp as much of the thin gas at the entrance, the inlet-side rotors would ideally have a larger radius, and correspondingly higher centrifugal force; ideal blades would get thinner towards their tips. However, because the average speed of a blade affects pumping so much this is done by increasing the root diameter rather than the tip diameter where practical.

Turbomolecular pumps must operate at very high speeds, and the heat buildup due to friction imposes design limitations. Some turbomolecular pumps use magnetic bearings to reduce friction and oil contamination. Because the magnetic bearings and the temperature cycles allow for only a limited clearance between rotor and stator, the blades at the high pressure stages are somewhat degenerated into a single helical foil each. Laminar flow cannot be used for pumping, because laminar turbines stall when not used at the designed flow. The pump can be cooled down to improve the compression, but should not be so cold as to condense ice on the blades.
When a turbopump is stopped, the oil from the backing vacuum may backstream through the turbopump and contaminate the chamber. One way to prevent this is to introduce a laminar flow of nitrogen through the pump. The transition from vacuum to nitrogen and from a running to a still turbopump has to be synchronized precisely to avoid mechanical stress to the pump and overpressure at the exhaust. A thin membrane and a valve at the exhaust should be added to protect the turbopump from excessive back pressure (e.g. after a power failure or leaks in the backing vacuum).

The rotor is stabilized in all of its six degrees of freedom. One degree is governed by the electric motor. Minimally, this degree must be stabilized electronically (or by a diamagnetic material, which is too unstable to be used in a precision pump bearing). Another way (ignoring losses in magnetic cores at high frequencies) is to construct this bearing as an axis with a sphere at each end. These spheres are inside hollow static spheres. On the surface of each sphere is a checkerboard pattern of inwards and outwards going magnetic field lines. As the checkerboard pattern of the static spheres is rotated, the rotor rotates. In this construction no axis is made stable on the cost of making another axis unstable, but all axes are neutral and the electronic regulation is less stressed and will be more dynamically stable. Hall effect sensors can be used to sense the rotational position and the other degrees of freedom can be measured capacitively.

==Maximum pressure==

At atmospheric pressure, the mean free path of air is about 70 nm. A turbomolecular pump can work only if those molecules hit by the moving blades reach the stationary blades before colliding with other molecules on their way. To achieve that, the gap between moving blades and stationary blades must be close to or less than the mean free path. From a practical construction standpoint, a feasible gap between the blade sets is on the order of 1 mm, so a turbopump will stall (no net pumping) if exhausted directly to the atmosphere. Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure, a turbopump will pump when the exhaust pressure is less than about where the mean free path is about 0.7 mm.

Most turbopumps have a Holweck pump (or molecular drag pump) as their last stage to increase the maximum backing pressure (exhaust pressure) to about 1–10 mbar. Theoretically, a centrifugal pump, a side channel pump, or a regenerative pump could be used to back to atmospheric pressure directly, but currently there is no commercially available turbopump that exhausts directly to atmosphere. In most cases, the exhaust is connected to a mechanical backing pump (usually called roughing pump) that produces a pressure low enough for the turbomolecular pump to work efficiently. Typically, this backing pressure is below 0.1 mbar and commonly about 0.01 mbar. The backing pressure is rarely below 10−3 mbar (mean free path ≈ 70 mm) because the flow resistance of the vacuum pipe between the turbopump and the roughing pump becomes significant.

The turbomolecular pump can be a very versatile pump. It can generate many degrees of vacuum from intermediate vacuum (≈10−2 Pa) up to ultra-high vacuum levels (≈10−8 Pa).

Multiple turbomolecular pumps in a lab or manufacturing-plant can be connected by tubes to a small backing pump. Automatic valves and diffusion pump like injection into a large buffer-tube in front of the backing pump prevents any overpressure from one pump to stall another pump.

==Practical considerations==
Laws of fluid dynamics do not provide good approximations for the behavior of individual, highly separated, non-interacting gas molecules, like those found in high vacuum environments. The maximum compression varies linearly with circumferential rotor speed. In order to obtain extremely low pressures down to 1 micropascal, rotation rates of 20,000 to 90,000 revolutions per minute are often necessary. Unfortunately, the compression ratio varies exponentially with the square root of the molecular weight of the gas. Thus, heavy molecules are pumped much more efficiently than light molecules. Most gases are heavy enough to be well pumped but it is difficult to pump hydrogen and helium efficiently.

An additional drawback stems from the high rotor speed of this type of pump: very high grade bearings are required, which increase the cost.

Because turbomolecular pumps only work in molecular flow conditions, a pure turbomolecular pump will require a very large backing pump to work effectively. Thus, many modern pumps have a molecular drag stage such as a Holweck or Gaede mechanism near the exhaust to reduce the size of backing pump required.

Much of recent turbo pump development has been focused on improvement of the effectiveness of the drag stages. As gas is removed from a pumped space, the lighter gases hydrogen and helium become a larger proportion of the remaining gas load. In recent years it has been demonstrated that the precise design of the surface geometry of the drag stages can have a marked effect on pumping of these light gases, improving compression ratios by up to two orders of magnitude for given pumping volume. As a result, it is possible to use much smaller backing pumps than would be required by pure turbomolecular pumps and/or design more compact turbomolecular pumps.

==History==

The turbomolecular pump was invented in 1958 by W. Becker, based on the older molecular drag pumps developed by Wolfgang Gaede in 1913, Fernand Holweck in 1923 and Manne Siegbahn in 1944.

<text>The Tour de France () is an annual men&#x27;s multiple-stage bicycle race held primarily in France. It is the oldest and most prestigious of the three Grand Tours, which include the Giro d&#x27;Italia and the Vuelta a España.

The race was first organized in 1903 to increase sales for the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; (which was an ancestor of &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;) and has been held annually since, except when it was not held from 1915 to 1918 and 1940 to 1946 due to the two World Wars. As the Tour gained prominence and popularity, the race was lengthened and gained more international participation. The Tour is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers invite.

Traditionally, the bulk of the race is held in July. While the route changes each year, the format of the race stays the same and includes time trials, passage through the mountain&#x27;s chains of the Pyrenees and the Alps, and (except in 2024 due to preparations for the 2024 Summer Olympics) a finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The modern editions of the Tour de France consist of 21 day-long stages over a 23- or 24-day period and cover approximately total. The race alternates between clockwise and counterclockwise circuits.

Twenty to twenty-two teams of eight riders usually compete. All of the stages are timed to the finish, and the riders&#x27; times are compounded with their previous stage times. The rider with the lowest cumulative time is the leader of the race and wears the yellow jersey. While the general classification attracts the most attention, there are other contests held within the Tour: the points classification for the sprinters (green jersey), the mountains classification for the climbers (polka-dot jersey), young rider classification for riders under the age of 26 (white jersey), and the team classification, based on the first three finishers from each team on each stage. Achieving a stage win also provides prestige, often accomplished by a team&#x27;s sprint specialist or a rider taking part in a breakaway.

A similar race for women was held under various names between 1984 and 2009. Following criticism by campaigners and the professional women&#x27;s peloton, a one/two-day race (La Course by Le Tour de France) was held between 2014 and 2021. The first Tour de France Femmes was held in 2022.

==History==

===Origins===
The Tour de France was created in 1903. The roots of the Tour de France trace back to the emergence of two rival sports newspapers in the country. On one hand was &quot;Le Vélo&quot;, the first and the largest daily sports newspaper in France, on the other was &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;, which had been set up by journalists and businesspeople including Comte Jules-Albert de Dion, Adolphe Clément, and Édouard Michelin in 1899. The rival paper emerged following disagreements over the Dreyfus Affair. De Dion, Clément and Michelin were particularly concerned with &quot;Le Vélo&quot;—which reported more than cycling—because its financial backer was one of their commercial rivals, the Darracq company. De Dion believed &quot;Le Vélo&quot; gave Darracq too much attention and him too little. De Dion was rich and could afford to indulge his whims. The new newspaper appointed Henri Desgrange as the editor. He was a prominent cyclist and owner with Victor Goddet of the velodrome at the Parc des Princes.

&quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; sales were lower than the rival it was intended to surpass, leading to a crisis meeting on 20 November 1902 on the middle floor of &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;″s office at 10 Rue du Faubourg Montmartre, Paris. The last to speak was the chief cycling journalist, a 26-year-old named Géo Lefèvre. Lefèvre suggested a six-day race of the sort popular on the track but all around France. Long-distance cycle races were a popular means to sell more newspapers, but nothing of the length that Lefèvre suggested had been attempted.

===The first Tour de France (1903)===
The first Tour de France was staged in 1903. The plan was a five-stage race from 31 May to 5 July, starting in Paris and stopping in Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, and Nantes before returning to Paris. Toulouse was added later to break the long haul across southern France from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Stages would go through the night and finish next afternoon, with rest days before riders set off again. But this proved too daunting and the costs too great for most and only 15 competitors had entered. Desgrange had never been wholly convinced and he came close to dropping the idea. Instead, he cut the length to 19 days, changed the dates to 1 to 19 July, and offered a daily allowance to those who averaged at least on all the stages, equivalent to what a rider would have expected to earn each day had he worked in a factory. He also cut the entry fee from 20 to 10 francs and set the first prize at 12,000 francs and the prize for each day&#x27;s winner at 3,000 francs. The winner would thereby win six times what most workers earned in a year. That attracted between 60 and 80 entrants – the higher number may have included serious inquiries and some who dropped out – among them not just professionals but amateurs, some unemployed, and some simply adventurous.

The first Tour de France started almost outside the Café Reveil-Matin at the junction of the Melun and Corbeil roads in the village of Montgeron. It was waved away by the starter, Georges Abran, at 3:16 p.m. on 1 July 1903. &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; hadn&#x27;t featured the race on its front page that morning.

Among the competitors were the eventual winner, Maurice Garin, his well-built rival Hippolyte Aucouturier, the German favourite Josef Fischer, and a collection of adventurers, including one competing as &quot;Samson&quot;.

Many riders dropped out of the race after completing the initial stages, as the physical effort the tour required was just too much. Only a mere 24 entrants remained at the end of the fourth stage. The race finished on the edge of Paris at Ville d&#x27;Avray, outside the Restaurant du Père Auto, before a ceremonial ride into Paris and several laps of the Parc des Princes. Garin dominated the race, winning the first and last two stages, at . The last rider, Arsène Millocheau, finished 64h 47m 22s behind him.

&quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;&#x27;s mission was accomplished, as circulation of the publication doubled throughout the race, making the race something much larger than Desgrange had ever hoped for.

===1904–1939===
Such was the passion that the first Tour created in spectators and riders that Desgrange said the 1904 Tour de France would be the last. Cheating was rife, and riders were beaten up by rival fans as they neared the top of the col de la République, sometimes called the col du Grand Bois, outside St-Étienne. The leading riders, including the winner Maurice Garin, were disqualified, though it took the Union Vélocipèdique de France until 30 November to make the decision. McGann says the UVF waited so long &quot;...well aware of the passions aroused by the race.&quot; Desgrange&#x27;s opinion of the fighting and cheating showed in the headline of his reaction in &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;: THE END.

By the following spring, Desgrange was planning a longer Tour with 11 stages instead of 6, and this time all the stages would take place during daylight hours to make cheating more noticeable. In 1905, stages started between 3:00 AM and 7:30 AM. The race captivated audiences and returned after a hiatus during World War I, continuing to grow in popularity.

Desgrange and his Tour invented bicycle stage racing. Desgrange experimented with different ways of judging the winner. Initially he used total accumulated time (as used in the modern Tour de France) but from 1906 to 1912 by points for placings each day. Desgrange saw problems in judging both by time and by points. By time, a rider coping with a mechanical problem—which the rules insisted he repair alone—could lose so much time that it cost him the race. Equally, riders could finish so separated that time gained or lost on one or two days could decide the whole race. Judging the race by points removed over-influential time differences but discouraged competitors from riding hard. It made no difference whether they finished fast or slow or separated by seconds or hours, so they were inclined to ride together at a relaxed pace until close to the line, only then disputing the final placings that would give them points.
The format changed over time. The Tour originally ran around the perimeter of France. Cycling was an endurance sport, and the organisers realised the sales they would achieve by creating supermen of the competitors. Night riding was dropped after the second Tour in 1904, when there had been persistent cheating when judges could not see riders. That reduced the daily and overall distance, but the emphasis remained on endurance. The first mountain stages (in the Pyrenees) appeared in 1910. Early tours had long multi-day stages, with the format settling on 15 stages from 1910 until 1924. After this, stages were gradually shortened, such that by 1936 there were as many as three stages in a single day.

Desgrange initially preferred to see the Tour as a race of individuals. The first Tours were open to whoever wanted to compete. Most riders were in teams that looked after them. The private entrants were called &quot;touriste-routiers—&quot;tourists of the road—from 1923 and were allowed to take part provided they make no demands on the organisers. Some of the Tour&#x27;s most colourful characters have been touriste-routiers. One finished each day&#x27;s race and then performed acrobatic tricks in the street to raise the price of a hotel. Until 1925, Desgrange forbade team members from pacing each other. The 1927 and 1928 Tours, however, consisted mainly of team time-trials, an unsuccessful experiment which sought to avoid a proliferation of sprint finishes on flat stages.

Until 1930, Desgrange demanded that riders mend their bicycles without help and that they use the same bicycle from start to end. Exchanging a damaged bicycle for another was allowed only in 1923. Desgrange stood against the use of multiple gears, and for many years insisted riders use wooden rims, fearing the heat of braking while coming down mountains would melt the glue that held the tires on metal rims (however, they were finally allowed in 1937).

By the end of the 1920s, Desgrange believed he could not beat what he believed were the underhand tactics of bike factories. When in 1929 the Alcyon team contrived to get Maurice De Waele to win even though he was sick, he said, &quot;My race has been won by a corpse&quot;. In 1930, Desgrange again attempted to take control of the Tour from teams, insisting competitors enter in national teams rather than trade teams and that competitors ride plain yellow bicycles that he would provide, without a maker&#x27;s name. There was no place for individuals in the post-1930s teams, and so Desgrange created regional teams, generally from France, to take in riders who would not otherwise have qualified. The original touriste-routiers mostly disappeared, but some were absorbed into regional teams.

Desgrange died at home on the Mediterranean coast on 16 August 1940. The race was taken over by his deputy, Jacques Goddet. The Tour was again disrupted by War after 1939, and did not return until 1947.

===1947–1969===
In 1944, &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; was closed—its doors nailed shut—and its belongings, including the Tour, sequestrated by the state for publishing articles too close to the Germans. Rights to the Tour were therefore owned by the government. Jacques Goddet was allowed to publish another daily sports paper, &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;, but there was a rival candidate to run the Tour: a consortium of &quot;Sports&quot; and &quot;Miroir Sprint&quot;. Each organised a candidate race. &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; and &quot;Le Parisien Libéré&quot; had La Course du Tour de France, while &quot;Sports&quot; and &quot;Miroir Sprint&quot; had La Ronde de France. Both were five stages, the longest the government would allow because of shortages. &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;&#x27;s race was better organised and appealed more to the public because it featured national teams that had been successful before the war, when French cycling was at a high. &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; was given the right to organise the 1947 Tour de France. However, &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;″s finances were never sound, and Goddet accepted an advance by Émilion Amaury, who had supported his bid to run the postwar Tour. Amaury was a newspaper magnate whose sole condition was that his sports editor, Félix Lévitan, should join Goddet for the Tour. The two worked together—with Goddet running the sporting side, and Lévitan the financial.

On the Tour&#x27;s return, the format of the race settled on between 20 and 25 stages. Most stages would last one day, but the scheduling of &#x27;split&#x27; stages continued well into the 1980s. 1953 saw the introduction of the Green Jersey &#x27;Points&#x27; competition. National teams contested the Tour until 1961. The teams were of different sizes. Some nations had more than one team, and some were mixed in with others to make up the number. National teams caught the public imagination but had a snag: that riders might normally have been in rival trade teams the rest of the season. The loyalty of riders was sometimes questionable, within and between teams. Sponsors were always unhappy about releasing their riders into anonymity for the biggest race of the year, as riders in national teams wore the colours of their country and a small cloth panel on their chest that named the team for which they normally rode. The situation became critical at the start of the 1960s. Sales of bicycles had fallen, and bicycle factories were closing. There was a risk, the trade said, that the industry would die if factories were not allowed the publicity of the Tour de France. The Tour returned to trade teams in 1962. In the same year, Émilion Amaury, owner of &quot;le Parisien Libéré&quot;, became financially involved in the Tour. He made Félix Lévitan co-organizer of the Tour, and it was decided that Levitan would focus on the financial issues, while Jacques Goddet was put in charge of sporting issues. The Tour de France was meant for professional cyclists, but in 1961 the organisation started the Tour de l&#x27;Avenir, the amateur version.

Twice, in 1949 and 1952, Italian rider Fausto Coppi won the Giro d&#x27;Italia and the Tour de France in the same year, the first rider to do so.

Louison Bobet was the first great French rider of the post-war period and the first rider to win the Tour in three successive years, 1953, 1954 and 1955.
Jacques Anquetil became the first cyclist to win the Tour de France five times, in 1957 and from 1961 to 1964. He stated before the 1961 Tour that he would gain the yellow jersey on day one and wear it all through the tour, a tall order with two previous winners in the field—Charly Gaul and Federico Bahamontes—but he did it. His victories in stage races such as the Tour were built on an exceptional ability to ride alone against the clock in individual time trial stages, which lent him the name &quot;Monsieur Chrono&quot;. Anquetil enjoyed a rivalry with Raymond Poulidor, who was known as &quot;The Eternal Second&quot;, because he never won the Tour, despite finishing in second place three times, and in third place five times (including his final Tour at the age of 40).

Doping had become a serious problem, culminating in the death of Tom Simpson in 1967, after which riders went on strike, although the organisers suspected sponsors provoked them. The Union Cycliste Internationale introduced limits to daily and overall distances, imposed rest days, and tests were introduced for riders. It was then impossible to follow the frontiers, and the Tour increasingly zig-zagged across the country, sometimes with unconnected days&#x27; races linked by train, while still maintaining some sort of loop. The Tour returned to national teams for 1967 and 1968 as &quot;an experiment&quot;. The Tour returned to trade teams in 1969 with a suggestion that national teams could come back every few years, but this has not happened since.

===1969–1987===
In the early 1970s, the race was dominated by Eddy Merckx, who won the General Classification five times, the Mountains Classification twice, the Points Classification three times and held the record for the most stage victories (34) until overtaken by Mark Cavendish in 2024. Merckx&#x27;s dominating style earned him the nickname &quot;The Cannibal&quot;. In 1969, he already had a commanding lead when he launched a long-distance solo attack in the mountains which none of the other elite riders could answer, resulting in an eventual winning margin of nearly eighteen minutes. In 1973 he did not win because he did not enter the Tour; instead, his great rival Luis Ocaña won. Merckx&#x27;s winning streak came to an end when he finished 2nd to Bernard Thévenet in 1975.

During this era, race director Felix Lévitan began to recruit additional sponsors, sometimes accepting prizes in kind if he could not get cash. In 1975, the polka-dot jersey was introduced for the winner of the Mountains Classification. This same year Levitan also introduced the finish of the Tour at the Avenue des Champs-Élysées. Since then, this stage has been largely ceremonial and is generally only contested as a prestigious sprinters&#x27; stage. (See &#x27;Notable Stages&#x27; below for examples of non-ceremonial finishes to this stage.) Occasionally, a rider will be given the honor of leading the rest of the peloton onto the circuit finish in their final Tour, as was the case for Jens Voigt and Sylvain Chavanel, among others.

From the late 1970s and into the early 1980s, the Tour was dominated by Frenchman Bernard Hinault, who would become the third rider to win five times. Hinault was defeated by Joop Zoetemelk in 1980 when he withdrew, and only once in his Tour de France career was he soundly defeated, and this was by Laurent Fignon in 1984. In 1986, Hinault, who had won the year before with American rider Greg LeMond supporting him, publicly pledged to ride in support of LeMond. Several attacks during the race cast doubt on the sincerity of his promise, leading to a rift between the two riders and the entire La Vie Claire team, before LeMond prevailed. It was the first ever victory for a rider from outside of Europe. The 1986 Tour is widely considered to be one of the most memorable in the history of the sport due to the battle between LeMond and Hinault.

The 1987 edition was more uncertain than past editions, as previous winners Hinault and Zoetemelk had retired, LeMond was absent, and Fignon was suffering from a lingering injury. As such, the race was highly competitive, and the lead changed hands eight times before Stephen Roche won. When Roche won the World Championship Road Race later in the season, he became only the second rider (after Merckx) to win cycling&#x27;s Triple Crown, which meant winning the Giro d&#x27;Italia, the Tour and the Road World Cycling Championship in one calendar year.

Lévitan helped drive an internationalization of the Tour de France, and cycling in general. Roche was the first winner from Ireland; however, in the years leading up to his victory, cyclists from numerous other countries began joining the ranks of the peloton. In 1982, Sean Kelly of Ireland (points) and Phil Anderson of Australia (young rider) became the first winners of any Tour classifications from outside cycling&#x27;s Continental Europe heartlands, while Lévitan was influential in facilitating the participation in the 1983 Tour by amateur riders from the Eastern Bloc and Colombia. In 1984, for the first time, the Société du Tour de France organized the Tour de France Féminin, a version for women. It was run in the same weeks as the men&#x27;s version, and it was won by Marianne Martin.

While the global awareness and popularity of the Tour grew during this time, its finances became stretched. Goddet and Lévitan continued to clash over the running of the race. Lévitan launched the Tour of America as a precursor to his plans to take the Tour de France to the US. The Tour of America lost much money, and it appeared to have been cross-financed by the Tour de France. In the years before 1987, Lévitan&#x27;s position had always been protected by Émilien Amaury, the then owner of ASO, but Émilien Amaury would soon retire and leave son Philippe Amaury responsible. When Lévitan arrived at his office on 17 March 1987, he found that his doors were locked and he was fired. The organisation of the 1987 Tour de France was taken over by Jean-François Naquet-Radiguet. He was not successful in acquiring more funds, and was fired within one year.

=== 1988–1997 ===
Months before the start of the 1988 Tour, director Jean-François Naquet-Radiguet was replaced by Xavier Louy. In 1988, the Tour was organised by Jean-Pierre Courcol, the director of &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;, then in 1989 by Jean-Pierre Carenso and then by Jean-Marie Leblanc, who in 1989 had been race director. The former television presenter Christian Prudhomme—he commentated on the Tour among other events—replaced Leblanc in 2007, having been assistant director for three years. In 1993 ownership of &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; moved to the Amaury Group, which formed Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) to oversee its sports operations, although the Tour itself is operated by its subsidiary the Société du Tour de France.

1988 onward was arguably the beginning of what can be referred to as the doping era. A new drug, erythropoietin (EPO), began to be used; it could not be detected by drug tests of the time. Pedro Delgado won the 1988 Tour de France by a considerable margin, and in 1989 and 1990 Lemond returned from injury and won back-to-back Tours, with the 1989 edition still standing as the closest two-way battle in TDF history, with Lemond claiming an 8-second victory on the final time trial to best Laurent Fignon.

The early 1990s was dominated by Spaniard Miguel Induráin, who won five Tours from 1991 to 1995, the fourth, and last, to win five times, and the only five-time winner to achieve those victories consecutively. He wore the race leader&#x27;s yellow jersey in the Tour de France for 60 days. He holds the record for the most consecutive Tour de France wins and shares the record for most wins with Jacques Anquetil, Bernard Hinault and Eddy Merckx. Induráin was a strong time trialist, gaining on rivals and riding defensively in the climbing stages. Induráin won only two Tour stages that were not individual time trials: mountain stages to Cauterets (1989) and Luz Ardiden (1990) in the Pyrenees. These superior abilities in the discipline fit perfectly with the time trial heavy Tours of the era, with many featuring between 150 and 200 km of time trialling vs the more common 50–80 km today.

The influx of more international riders continued through this period, as in 1996 the race was won for the first time by a rider from Denmark, Bjarne Riis, who ended Miguel Induráin&#x27;s reign with an attack on Hautacam. On 25 May 2007, Bjarne Riis admitted that he placed first in the Tour de France using banned substances, and he was no longer considered the winner by the Tour&#x27;s organizers. In July 2008, the Tour reconfirmed his victory but with an asterisk label to indicate his doping offences. In 2013 Jan Ullrich, the first German rider to win the Tour (in 1997), admitted to blood doping.

=== 1998–2011 ===
During the 1998 Tour de France, a doping scandal known as the Festina Affair shook the sport to its core when it became apparent that there was systematic doping going on in the sport. Numerous riders and a handful of teams were either thrown out of the race, or left of their own free will, and in the end Marco Pantani survived to win his lone Tour in a decimated main field. The 1999 Tour de France was billed as the ‘Tour of Renewal’ as the sport tried to clean up its image following the doping fiasco of the previous year. Initially it seemed to be a Cinderella story when cancer survivor Lance Armstrong stole the show on Sestriere and kept on riding to the first of his astonishing seven consecutive Tour de France victories; however, in retrospect, 1999 was just the beginning of the doping problem getting much, much worse. Following Armstrong&#x27;s retirement in 2005, the 2006 edition saw his former teammate Floyd Landis finally get the chance he worked so hard for with a stunning and improbable solo breakaway on Stage 17 in which he set himself up to win the Tour in the final time trial, which he then did. Not long after the Tour was over, however, Landis was accused of doping and had his Tour win revoked.

Over the next few years, a new star in Alberto Contador came onto the scene; however, during the 2007 edition, a veteran Danish rider, Michael Rasmussen, was in the maillot jaune late in the Tour, in position to win, when his own team sacked him for a possible doping infraction; this allowed the rising star Contador to ride mistake-free for the remaining stages to win his first. 2008 saw a Tour where so many riders were doping that, when it went ten days without a single doping incident, it became news. It was during this Tour that a UCI official was quoted as saying, &quot;These guys are crazy, and the sooner they start learning, the better.&quot; Roger Legeay, a Directeur Sportif for one of the teams noted how riders were secretly and anonymously buying doping products on the internet. Like Greg LeMond at the beginning of the EPO era, 2008 winner Carlos Sastre was a rider who went his entire career without a single doping incident and between approximately 1994 and 2011 this was the only Tour to have a winner with a clear biological passport. 2009 saw the return of Lance Armstrong and, strangely, after Contador was able to defeat his teammate, the Danish National Anthem was mistakenly played. No Danish rider was in contention in 2009, and Rasmussen, the only Danish rider capable of winning the Tour during this era, was not even in the race. Another rider absent was Floyd Landis, who had asked Armstrong to get him back on a team to ride the Tour once more, but Armstrong refused because Landis was a convicted doper. Landis joined OUCH, an American continental team, and not long after this initiated contact with USADA to discuss Armstrong.

In 2011, Cadel Evans became the first Australian to win the Tour after coming up just short several times in the previous few editions. The 2012 Tour de France was won by the first British rider to ever win the Tour, Bradley Wiggins, while finishing on the podium just behind him was Chris Froome, who along with Contador became the next big stars to attempt to contest the giants of Anquetil, Merckx, Hinault, Indurain and Armstrong.

Overshadowing the entire sport at this time, however, was the Lance Armstrong doping case, which finally revealed much of the truth about doping in cycling. As a result, the UCI decided that each of Armstrong&#x27;s seven wins would be revoked. This decision cleared the names of many people, including lesser-known riders, reporters, team medical staff, and even the wife of a rider who had their reputations tarnished or had been forced from the sport due to pressure from Armstrong and his support staff. Much of this only became possible after Floyd Landis came forward to USADA. Also around this time, an investigation by the French government into doping in cycling revealed that way back during the 1998 Tour, close to 90% of the riders who were tested, retroactively tested positive for EPO. The result of these doping scandals being that in the case of Landis in 2006, and Contador in 2010, new winners were declared in Óscar Pereiro and Andy Schleck, respectively; however, in the case of the seven Tours revoked from Armstrong, there was no alternate winner named.

=== Since 2012 ===
Team Sky dominated the event for several years, with wins for Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome (four times) and Geraint Thomas before Egan Bernal became the first Colombian winner in 2019. The streak was interrupted only by Vincenzo Nibali&#x27;s 2014 win.

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the 2020 Tour started in late August, the first time since the end of World War II that the Tour was not held in July. This saw the first of two successive victories for Tadej Pogačar of UAE Team Emirates, who was the first Slovenian winner, and the second youngest (at 21) after Henri Cornet in 1904. He also won the mountain and youth classifications, becoming the first rider since Eddy Merckx in 1972 to win three jerseys in a single Tour. Pogačar repeated this triple in 2021. On stage 13 of this Tour, sprinter Mark Cavendish tied the record of Eddy Merckx for all time stage wins with 34.

Danish rider Jonas Vingegaard, second in 2021, won in both 2022 and 2023, with Pogačar coming second both times. The 2022 race was followed by the Tour de France Femmes, the first official Tour de France for women since 1989.

In 2024, Pogačar took back the Tour title, winning by more than six minutes over Vingegaard while Tour debutant, Remco Evenepoel, rounded out the podium. Pogačar won six stages, including five of the last eight stages. With his win, he became only the eighth rider, and the first since Marco Pantani in 1998, to win the Giro d&#x27;Italia and the Tour de France in the same calendar year. On stage 5 of the race, sprinter Mark Cavendish won his 35th overall Tour stage win, breaking the tie between him and Eddy Merckx, who held the record for 49 years, for the all-time stage wins record in the Tour.

==Classifications==

The oldest and main competition in the Tour de France is known as the &quot;general classification&quot;, for which the yellow jersey is awarded; the winner of this is said to have won the race. A few riders from each team aim to win overall, but there are three further competitions to draw riders of all specialties: points, mountains, and a classification for young riders with general classification aspirations. The leader of each of the aforementioned classifications wears a distinctive jersey, with riders leading multiple classifications wearing the jersey of the most prestigious that he leads. In addition to these four classifications, there are several minor and discontinued classifications that are competed for during the race.

===General classification===


The oldest and most sought-after classification in the Tour de France is the general classification. All of the stages are timed to the finish. The riders&#x27; times are compounded with their previous stage times; so the rider with the lowest aggregate time is the leader of the race. The leader is determined after each stage&#x27;s conclusion: he gains the privilege to wear the yellow jersey, presented on a podium in the stage&#x27;s finishing town, for the next stage. If he is leading more than one classification that awards a jersey, he wears the yellow one, since the general classification is the most important one in the race. Between 1905 and 1912 inclusive, in response to concerns about rider cheating in the 1904 race, the general classification was awarded according to a point-based system based on their placings in each stage, and the rider with the lowest total of points after the Tour&#x27;s conclusion was the winner.

The leader in the first Tour de France was awarded a green armband. The yellow jersey (the color was chosen as the newspaper that created the Tour, &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;, was printed on yellow paper), was added to the race in the 1919 edition and it has since become a symbol of the Tour de France. The first rider to wear the yellow jersey was Eugène Christophe. Riders usually try to make the extra effort to keep the jersey for as long as possible in order to get more publicity for the team and its sponsors. Eddy Merckx wore the yellow jersey for 96 stages, which is more than any other rider in the history of the Tour. Four riders have won the general classification five times in their career: Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, and Miguel Induráin.

===Mountains classification===

The mountains classification is the second-oldest jersey awarding classification in the Tour de France. The mountains classification was added to the Tour de France in the 1933 edition and was first won by Vicente Trueba. Prizes for the classification were first awarded in 1934. During stages of the race containing climbs, points are awarded to the first riders to reach the top of each categorized climb, with points available for up to the first 10 riders, depending on the classification of the climb. Climbs are classified according to the steepness and length of that particular hill, with more points available for harder climbs. The classification was preceded by the &quot;meilleur grimpeur&quot; () which was awarded by the organising newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; to a cyclist who completed each race.

The classification awarded no jersey to the leader until the 1975 Tour de France, when the organizers decided to award a distinctive white jersey with red dots to the leader. This is colloquially referred to in English as the &quot;polka dot&quot; jersey. The climbers&#x27; jersey is worn by the rider who, at the start of each stage, has the largest number of climbing points. If the race leader is also leading the Mountains classification, the polka dot jersey will be worn by the next eligible rider in the Mountains standings. At the end of the Tour, the rider holding the most climbing points wins the classification. Some riders may race with the aim of winning this particular competition, while others who gain points early on may shift their focus to the classification during the race. The Tour has five categories for ranking the mountains the race covers. The scale ranges from category 4, the easiest, to hors catégorie, the hardest. During his career Richard Virenque won the mountains classification a record seven times.

The point distribution for the mountains in the 2019 event was:
* Points awarded are doubled for HC climbs over 2000m of altitude.

===Points classification===

The points classification is the third oldest of the currently awarded jersey classifications. It was introduced in the 1953 Tour de France and was first won by Fritz Schär. The classification was added to draw the participation of the sprinters as well as celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Tour. Points are given to the first 15 riders to finish a stage, with an additional set of points given to the first 15 riders to cross a pre-determined &#x27;sprint&#x27; point during the route of each stage. The point classification leader green jersey is worn by the rider who at the start of each stage, has the greatest number of points.

In the first years, the cyclist received penalty points for not finishing with a high place, so the cyclist with the fewest points was awarded the green jersey. From 1959 on, the system was changed so the cyclists were awarded points for high place finishes (with first place getting the most points, and lower placings getting successively fewer points), so the cyclist with the most points was awarded the green jersey. The number of points awarded varies depending on the type of stage, with flat stages awarding the most points at the finish and time trials and high mountain stages awarding the fewest points at the finish. This increases the likelihood of a sprinter winning the points classification, though other riders can be competitive for the classification if they have a sufficient number of high-place finishes.

The winner of the classification is the rider with the most points at the end of the Tour. In case of a tie, the leader is determined by the number of stage wins, then the number of intermediate sprint victories, and finally, the rider&#x27;s standing in the general classification. The classification has been won a record seven times by Peter Sagan.

The first year the points classification was used it was sponsored by La Belle Jardinière, a lawn mower producer, and the jersey was made green. In 1968 the jersey was changed to red to please the sponsor. However, the color was changed back the following year. For almost 25 years the classification was sponsored by Pari Mutuel Urbain, a state betting company. However they announced in November 2014 that they would not be continuing their sponsorship, and in March 2015 it was revealed that the green jersey would now be sponsored by German automaker Volkswagen AG&#x27;s Škoda brand.

As of 2015, the points awarded are:
===Young rider classification===

The leader of the classification is determined the same way as the general classification, with the riders&#x27; times being added up after each stage and the eligible rider with lowest aggregate time is dubbed the leader. The Young rider classification is restricted to the riders that will stay under the age of 26 in the calendar year the race is held. Originally the classification was restricted to neo-professionals – riders that are in their first three years of professional racing – until 1983. In 1983, the organizers made it so that only first time riders were eligible for the classification. In 1987, the organizers changed the rules of the classification to what they are today.

This classification was added to the Tour de France in the 1975 edition, with Francesco Moser being the first to win the classification after placing seventh overall. The Tour de France awards a white jersey to the leader of the classification, although this was not done between 1989 and 2000. Six riders have won both the young rider classification and the general classification in the same year: Laurent Fignon (1983), Jan Ullrich (1997), Alberto Contador (2007), Andy Schleck (2010), Egan Bernal (2019) and Tadej Pogačar (2020 and 2021). Three riders have won the young rider classification three times in their respective careers: Jan Ullrich, Andy Schleck and Tadej Pogačar.

As of 2015 Jersey sponsor is Optician company Krys, replacing Škoda who moved to the Green Jersey.

===Minor classifications and prizes===

The &quot;prix de la combativité&quot; goes to the rider who most animates the day, usually by trying to break clear of the field. The most combative rider wears a number printed white-on-beige instead of black-on-white next day. An award goes to the most aggressive rider throughout the Tour. Already in 1908 a sort of combativity award was offered, when &quot;Sports Populaires&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Éducation Physique&quot; created &quot;Le Prix du Courage&quot;, 100 francs and a silver gilt medal for &quot;the rider having finished the course, even if unplaced, who is particularly distinguished for the energy he has used.&quot; The modern competition started in 1958. In 1959, a Super Combativity award for the most combative cyclist of the Tour was awarded. It was initially not awarded every year, but since 1981 it has been given annually. Eddy Merckx has the most wins (4) for the overall award.

The team classification is assessed by adding the time of each team&#x27;s best three riders each day. The competition does not have its own jersey but since 2006 the leading team has worn numbers printed black-on-yellow. Until 1990, the leading team would wear yellow caps. As of 2012, the riders of the leading team wear yellow helmets. During the era of national teams, France and Belgium won 10 times each. From 1973 up to 1988, there was also a team classification based on points (stage classification); members of the leading team would wear green caps.

===Historical classifications===

There has been an intermediate sprints classification, which from 1984 awarded a red jersey for points awarded to the first three to pass intermediate points during the stage. These sprints also scored points towards the points classification and bonuses towards the general classification. The intermediate sprints classification with its red jersey was abolished in 1989, but the intermediate sprints have remained, offering points for the points classification and, until 2007, time bonuses for the general classification.

From 1968 there was a combination classification, scored on a points system based on standings in the general, points and mountains classifications. The design was originally white, then a patchwork with areas resembling each individual jersey design. This was also abolished in 1989.

===Lanterne rouge===
The rider who has taken most time is called the &quot;lanterne rouge&quot; (&quot;red lantern, as in the red light at the back of a vehicle so it can be seen in the dark&quot;) and in past years sometimes carried a small red light beneath his saddle. Such was sympathy that he could command higher fees in the races that previously followed the Tour. In 1939 and 1948 the organisers excluded the last rider every day, to encourage more competitive racing.

===Prizes===

Prize money has always been awarded. From 20,000 francs the first year, prize money has increased each year, although from 1976 to 1987 the first prize was an apartment offered by a race sponsor. The first prize in 1988 was a car, a studio-apartment, a work of art, and 500,000 francs in cash. Prizes only in cash returned in 1990.

Prizes and bonuses are awarded for daily placings and final placings at the end of the race. In 2009, the winner received €450,000, while each of the 21 stage winners won €8,000 (€10,000 for the team time-trial stage). The winners of the points classification and mountains classification each win €25,000, the young rider competition and the combativity prize €20,000 ; the winner of the team classification (calculated by adding the cumulative times of the best three riders in each team) receives €50 000 .

The Souvenir Henri Desgrange, in memory of the founder of the Tour, is awarded to the first rider over the Col du Galibier where his monument stands, or to the first rider over the highest col in the Tour. A similar award, the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, is made at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet, at the memorial to Jacques Goddet, Desgrange&#x27;s successor.

=== Trophy ===
The winner of general classification is the recipient of &quot;Coupe Omnisports&quot;, presented by the president of the French Republic. The Trophy is realized by the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres and was used since 1975, the first time Tour finished on the Champs-Élysées.

Škoda, the green jersey sponsor, have given, since 2011 a glass trophy in green to the winner of that competition. More recently, similar trophies in clear glass have been awarded to the other jersey winners.

After every stage, the general classification leader receive the yellow jersey and, since 1987, a toy lyon offered by the yellow jersey sponsor, Crédit Lyonnais.

==Stages==
The modern tour typically has 21 stages, one per day.

===Mass-start stages===

The Tour directors categorise mass-start stages into &#x27;flat&#x27;, &#x27;hilly&#x27;, or &#x27;mountain&#x27;. This affects the points awarded in the sprint classification, whether the 3 kilometer rule is operational, and the permitted disqualification time in which riders must finish (which is the winners&#x27; time plus a pre-determined percentage of that time). Time bonuses of 10, 6, and 4 seconds are awarded to the first three finishers, though this was not done from 2008 to 2014. Bonuses were previously also awarded to winners of intermediate sprints.

===Time trials===

The first time trial in the Tour was between La Roche-sur-Yon and Nantes (80 km) in 1934. The first stage in modern Tours is often a short trial, a &quot;prologue&quot;, to decide who wears yellow on the opening day. The first prologue was in 1967. The 1988 event, at La Baule, was called &quot;la préface&quot;. There are usually two or three time trials. The final time trial has sometimes been the final stage, more recently often the penultimate stage.

===Notable stages===

Since 1975 the race has finished with laps of the Champs-Élysées. As the peloton arrives in downtown Paris the French Air Force does a three-jet flyover with the three colors of the French flag in smoke behind them. This stage rarely challenges the leader because it is flat and the leader usually has too much time in hand to be denied. In modern times, there tends to be a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement: while the points classification is still contended if possible, the overall classification is not fought over; because of this, it is not uncommon for the &quot;de facto&quot; winner of the overall classification to ride into Paris holding a glass of champagne. The only time the maillot jaune was attacked in a manner that lasted all the way through the end of this stage was during the 1979 Tour de France. In 1987, Pedro Delgado vowed to attack during the stage to challenge the 40-second lead held by Stephen Roche. He was unsuccessful and he and Roche finished in the peloton. In 2005, controversy arose when Alexander Vinokourov attacked and won the stage, in the process taking fifth place overall from Levi Leipheimer. This attack was not a threat to the overall lead, but was a long-shot at the Podium standings, as Vinokourov was about five minutes behind third place.

In 1989, the last stage was a time trial. Greg LeMond overtook Laurent Fignon to win by eight seconds, the closest margin in the Tour&#x27;s history. The final stage has since only been held as a time trial once, in 2024.

The climb of Alpe d&#x27;Huez has become one of the more noted mountain stages. During the 2004 Tour de France it was the scene of a mountain time trial on the 16th stage. Riders complained of abusive spectators who threatened their progress up the climb. On this stage it is not uncommon for a low end estimate of the spectators in attendance to number 300,000. During a famous head-to-head battle between Anquetil and Raymond Poulidor on Puy de Dôme it was estimated that at least a half a million people were on hand. Mont Ventoux is often claimed to be the hardest in the Tour because of the harsh conditions. Another notable mountain stage frequently featured climbs the Col du Tourmalet, the most visited mountain in the history of the Tour. Col du Galibier is the most visited mountain in the Alps. The 2011 Tour de France stage to Galibier marked the 100th anniversary of the mountain in the Tour and also boasted the highest finish altitude ever: . Some mountain stages have become memorable because of the weather. An example is a stage in 1996 Tour de France from Val-d&#x27;Isère to Sestriere. A snowstorm at the start area led to a shortening of the stage from to just . During the 2019 Tour de France multiple landslides and hail storms forced two critical mountain stages to be considerably shortened. Authorities made every effort to plow the road and make the course safe, but the volume of hail, mud and debris proved too much.

=== Deciding the route ===
To host a stage start or finish brings prestige and business to a town. The prologue and first stage (Grand Départ) are particularly prestigious. The race may start with a prologue (too short to go between towns) in which case the start of the next day&#x27;s racing, which would be considered stage 1, usually in the same town. In 2007 director Christian Prudhomme said that &quot;in general, for a period of five years we have the Tour start outside France three times and within France twice.&quot;

In the local towns and cities that the Tour visits for stage starts and finishes, it is a spectacle that usually shuts these towns down for the day, resulting in a very festive atmosphere, and these events usually require months of planning and preparation. ASO employs around 70 people full-time, in an office facing—but not connected to—&quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; in the Issy-les-Moulineaux area of outer western Paris. That number expands to about 220 during the race itself, not including the 500-odd contractors employed to move barriers, erect stages, signpost the route, and other work. ASO now also operates several other major bike races throughout the year.

==Advertising caravan==

With the switch to the use of national teams in 1930, the costs of accommodating riders fell to the organizers instead of the sponsors and Henri Desgrange raised the money by allowing advertisers to precede the race. The procession of often colourfully decorated trucks and cars became known as the publicity caravan. It formalised an existing situation, companies having started to follow the race. The first to sign to precede the Tour was the chocolate company, Menier, one of those who had followed the race. Its head of publicity, Paul Thévenin, had first put the idea to Desgrange. It paid 50,000 francs. Preceding the race was more attractive to advertisers because spectators gathered by the road long before the race or could be attracted from their houses. Advertisers following the race found that many who had watched the race had already gone home. Menier handed out tons of chocolate in that first year of preceding the race, as well as 500,000 policemen&#x27;s hats printed with the company&#x27;s name. The success led to the caravan&#x27;s existence being formalised the following year.

The caravan was at its height between 1930 and the mid-1960s, before television and especially television advertising was established in France. Advertisers competed to attract public attention. Motorcycle acrobats performed for the Cinzano apéritif company and a toothpaste maker, and an accordionist, Yvette Horner, became one of the most popular sights as she performed on the roof of a Citroën Traction Avant. The modern Tour restricts the excesses to which advertisers are allowed to go but at first anything was allowed. The writer Pierre Bost lamented: &quot;This caravan of 60 gaudy trucks singing across the countryside the virtues of an apéritif, a make of underpants or a dustbin is a shameful spectacle. It bellows, it plays ugly music, it&#x27;s sad, it&#x27;s ugly, it smells of vulgarity and money.&quot;
Advertisers pay the Société du Tour de France approximately €150,000 to place three vehicles in the caravan. Some have more. On top of that come the more considerable costs of the commercial samples that are thrown to the crowd and the cost of accommodating the drivers and the staff—frequently students—who throw them. The number of items has been estimated at 11 million, each person in the procession giving out 3,000 to 5,000 items a day. A bank, GAN, gave out 170,000 caps, 80,000 badges, 60,000 plastic bags, and 535,000 copies of its race newspaper in 1994. Together, they weighed . The vehicles also have to be decorated on the morning of each stage and, because they must return to ordinary highway standards, disassembled after each stage. Numbers vary but there are normally around 250 vehicles each year. Their order on the road is established by contract, the leading vehicles belonging to the largest sponsors.

The procession sets off two hours before the start and then regroups to precede the riders by an hour and a half. It spreads and takes 40 minutes to pass at between and . Vehicles travel in groups of five. Their position is logged by GPS and from an aircraft and organised on the road by the caravan director—Jean-Pierre Lachaud—an assistant, three motorcyclists, two radio technicians, and a breakdown and medical crew. Six motorcyclists from the Garde Républicaine, the élite of the gendarmerie, ride with them.

==Politics==
The first three Tours from 1903 to 1905 stayed within France. The 1906 race went into Alsace-Lorraine, territory annexed by the German Empire in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War. Passage was secured through a meeting at Metz between Desgrange&#x27;s collaborator, Alphonse Steinès, and the German governor.

No teams from Italy, Germany, or Spain rode in 1939 because of tensions preceding the Second World War (after German assistance to the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War it was widely expected Spain would join Germany in a European war, though this did not come to pass). Henri Desgrange planned a Tour for 1940, after war had started but before France had been invaded. The route, approved by military authorities, included a route along the Maginot Line. Teams would have been drawn from military units in France, including the British, who would have been organised by a journalist, Bill Mills. Then the Germans invaded and the race was not held again until 1947 (see Tour de France during the Second World War). The first German team after the war was in 1960, although individual Germans had ridden in mixed teams. The Tour has since started in Germany four times: in Cologne in 1965, in Frankfurt in 1980, in West Berlin on the city&#x27;s 750th anniversary in 1987, and in Düsseldorf in 2017. Plans to enter East Germany in 1987 were abandoned.

===Corsica===
Prior to 2013, the Tour de France had visited every region of Metropolitan France except Corsica. Jean-Marie Leblanc, when he was organiser, said the island had never asked for a stage start there. It would be difficult to find accommodation for 4,000 people, he said. The spokesman of the Corsican nationalist party Party of the Corsican Nation, François Alfonsi, said: &quot;The organisers must be afraid of terrorist attacks. If they are really thinking of a possible terrorist action, they are wrong. Our movement, which is nationalist and in favour of self-government, would be delighted if the Tour came to Corsica.&quot; The opening three stages of the 2013 Tour de France were held on Corsica as part of the celebrations for the 100th edition of the race.

==Start and finish of the Tour==

Most stages are in mainland France, although since the mid-1950s it has become common to visit nearby countries. The Tour has visited thirteen different countries in its history: Andorra, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, San Marino, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, all of which have hosted stages or part of a stage. Since 1975 the finish has been on the Champs-Élysées in Paris; from 1903 to 1967 the race finished at the Parc des Princes stadium in western Paris and from 1968 to 1974 at the Piste Municipale south of the capital. In the 111th edition, because of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, the race ended outside Paris for the first time, on the Place Masséna in Nice.

Félix Levitan, race organizer in the 1980s, was keen to host stages in the United States, but these proposals have never been developed.

==Broadcasting==
The Tour was first followed only by journalists from &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;, the organisers. The race was founded to increase sales of a floundering newspaper and its editor, Desgrange, saw no reason to allow rival publications to profit.
The first time papers other than &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; were allowed was 1921, when 15 press cars were allowed for regional and foreign reporters.

The Tour was shown first on cinema newsreels a day or more after the event. The first live radio broadcast was in 1929, when Jean Antoine and Alex Virot of the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Intransigeant&quot; broadcast for Radio Cité. They used telephone lines. In 1932 they broadcast the sound of riders crossing the col d&#x27;Aubisque in the Pyrenees on 12 July, using a recording machine and transmitting the sound later.

The first television pictures were shown a day after a stage. The national TV channel used two 16mm cameras, a Jeep, and a motorbike. Film was flown or taken by train to Paris, where it was edited and then shown the following day.

The first live broadcast, and the second of any sport in France, was the finish at the Parc des Princes in Paris on 25 July 1948. Rik Van Steenbergen of Belgium led in the bunch after a stage of from Nancy. The first live coverage from the side of the road was from the Aubisque on 8 July 1958. Proposals to cover the whole race were abandoned in 1962 after objections from regional newspapers whose editors feared the competition. The dispute was settled, but not in time for the race, and the first complete coverage was the following year in 1963. In 1958 the first mountain climbs were broadcast live on television for the first time, and in 1959 helicopters were first used for the television coverage.

The leading television commentator in France was a former rider, Robert Chapatte. At first he was the only commentator. He was joined in following seasons by an analyst for the mountain stages and by a commentator following the competitors by motorcycle.

Broadcasting in France was largely a state monopoly until 1982, when the socialist president François Mitterrand allowed private broadcasters and privatised the leading television channel. Competition between channels raised the broadcasting fees paid to the organisers from 1.5 per cent of the race budget in 1960 to more than a third by the end of the century. Broadcasting time also increased as channels competed to secure the rights. The two largest channels to stay in public ownership, Antenne 2 and FR3, combined to offer more coverage than its private rival, TF1. The two stations, renamed France 2 and France 3, still hold the domestic rights and provide pictures for broadcasters around the world.

The stations use a staff of 300 with four helicopters, two aircraft, two motorcycles, 35 other vehicles including trucks, and 20 podium cameras.

French aviation company Hélicoptères de France (HdF) has provided aerial filming services for the Tour since 1999. HdF operates Eurocopter AS355 Écureuil 2 and AS350 Écureuil helicopters for this purpose, and the pilots undergo training along the course for six months before the race.

Domestic television covers the most important stages of the Tour, such as those in the mountains, from mid-morning until early evening. Coverage typically starts with a survey of the day&#x27;s route, interviews along the road, discussions of the difficulties and tactics ahead, and a 30-minute archive feature. The biggest stages are shown live from start to end, followed by interviews with riders and others and features such an edited version of the stage seen from beside a team manager following and advising riders from his car. Radio covers the race in updates throughout the day, particularly on the national news channel, France Info, and some stations provide continuous commentary on long wave. The 1979 Tour was the first to be broadcast in the United States.

In the United Kingdom, ITV obtained the rights to the Tour de France in 2002, replacing Channel 4 as the UK terrestrial broadcaster. Channel 4 coverage had been broadcast for the previous 15 years with episodes introduced with a theme written by Pete Shelley. The coverage is shown on ITV4, having aired in previous years on ITV2 and ITV3. Initially, live coverage was only broadcast at the weekend but since the 2010 Tour de France, ITV4 has broadcast daily live coverage of every stage except the final which is shown on ITV, ITV4 have the nightly highlights show.

In the United States, the Tour de France has been broadcast by the NBC Sports Group since 1999, under a contract most recently renewed in 2023 to last through 2029. Currently, all stages stream exclusively on its streaming platform Peacock, with selected stages simulcast on the NBC broadcast network. The rights were first acquired by Outdoor Life Network (OLN) in 1999; buoyed by Lance Armstrong&#x27;s performance in the race, OLN considered the Tour to be its flagship program, and its coverage helped expand the then-fledging cable channel to over 60 million households. However, critics raised concerns over the extensive focus OLN placed on Armstrong during its coverage, with some jokingly stating that &quot;OLN&quot; stood for &quot;Only Lance Network&quot;. The Tour would remain part of its programming through OLN&#x27;s relaunch as mainstream sports channel Versus, and became integrated with NBC Sports after Versus parent company Comcast acquired NBC Universal (rebranding Versus as the NBC Sports Network afterward),

The combination of unprecedented rigorous doping controls and almost no positive tests helped restore fans&#x27; confidence in the 2009 Tour de France. This led directly to an increase in global popularity of the event. The most watched stage of 2009 was stage 20, from Montélimar to Mont Ventoux in Provence, with a global total audience of 44 million, making it the 12th most watched sporting event in the world in 2009.

==Culture==

The Tour is an important cultural event for fans in Europe. Millions line the route, some having camped for a week to get the best view.

The Tour de France appealed from the start not just for the distance and its demands but because it played to a wish for national unity, a call to what Maurice Barrès called the France &quot;of earth and deaths&quot; or what Georges Vigarello called &quot;the image of a France united by its earth&quot;.
The image had been started by the 1877 travel/school book . It told of two boys, André and Julien, who &quot;in a thick September fog left the town of Phalsbourg in Lorraine to see France at a time when few people had gone far beyond their nearest town&quot;.

The book sold six million copies by the time of the first Tour de France, the biggest selling book of 19th-century France (other than the Bible). It stimulated a national interest in France, making it &quot;visible and alive&quot;, as its preface said. There had already been a car race called the Tour de France but it was the publicity behind the cycling race, and Desgrange&#x27;s drive to educate and improve the population, that inspired the French to know more of their country.

The academic historians Jean-Luc Boeuf and Yves Léonard say most people in France had little idea of the shape of their country until began publishing maps of the race.

===Arts===
The Tour has inspired several popular songs in France, notably (1932), (1936) and (1950). German electronic group Kraftwerk composed &quot;Tour de France&quot; in 1983 – described as a minimalistic &quot;melding of man and machine&quot; – and produced an album &quot;Tour de France Soundtracks&quot; in 2003, the centenary of the Tour.

The Tour and its first Italian winner, Ottavio Bottecchia, are mentioned at the end of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;.

From 2011 to 2015, American letterpress studio Lead Graffiti experimented with handset wood and metal type to print same-day posters documenting events of each stage of the Tour de France. The designers called the project &quot;endurance letterpress&quot;. A 2013 article on the poster series appeared in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sports in Media&quot; issue. In 2014 the British Library celebrated the Tour&#x27;s fourth &quot;Grand Départ&quot; from the U.K. with an exhibition of &quot;Tour de Lead Graffiti&quot; posters.

In films, the Tour was background for &quot;Five Red Tulips&quot; (1949) by Jean Stelli, in which five riders are murdered. A burlesque in 1967, by Alex Joffé, with Bourvil and Monique Tarbès, also featured it. Footage of the 1970 Tour de France is shown in Jorgen Leth&#x27;s experimental short &quot;Eddy Merckx in the Vicinity of a Cup of Coffee&quot;. Patrick Le Gall made (1996). The comedy, (2001), featured the Tour of 1974.

In 2005, three films chronicled a team. The German , translated as &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot;, recorded 2003 from the perspective of Team Telekom. The film was directed by Pepe Danquart, who won an Academy Award for live-action short film in 1993 for &quot;Black Rider&quot; (). The Danish film &quot;Overcoming&quot; by Tómas Gislason recorded the 2004 Tour from the perspective of Team CSC.

&quot;Wired to Win&quot; chronicles Française des Jeux riders Baden Cooke and Jimmy Caspar in 2003. By following their quest for the points classification, won by Cooke, the film looks at the working of the brain. The film, made for IMAX theaters, appeared in December 2005. It was directed by Bayley Silleck, who was nominated for an Academy Award for documentary short subject in 1996 for &quot;Cosmic Voyage&quot;.

A fan, Scott Coady, followed the 2000 Tour with a handheld video camera to make &quot;The Tour Baby!&quot; which raised $160,000 to benefit the Lance Armstrong Foundation, and made a 2005 sequel, &quot;Tour Baby Deux!&quot;

 by Louis Malle is an 18-minute short of 1962. The 1965 Tour was filmed by Claude Lelouch in . This 30-minute documentary has no narration and relies on sights and sounds of the Tour.

In fiction, the 2003 animated feature (&quot;The Triplets of Belleville&quot;) ties into the Tour de France.

Netflix, partnered with the organizer Amaury Sport Organisation, has produced a documentary series about the eight major teams across the 2022 Tour de France named &quot;Tour de France: Unchained&quot;. It was released in June 2023.

===Post-Tour criteriums===
After the Tour de France there are criteriums in the Netherlands and Belgium. These races are public spectacles where thousands of people can see their heroes from the Tour de France race. The budget of a criterium is over 100,000 euros, with most of the money going to the riders. Jersey winners or big-name riders earn between 20 and 60 thousand euros per race in start money.

==Doping==

Allegations of doping have plagued the Tour almost since it began in 1903. Early riders consumed alcohol and used ether to dull the pain. Over the years they began to increase performance and the Union Cycliste Internationale and governments enacted policies to combat the practice.

In 1924, Henri Pélissier and his brother Charles told the journalist Albert Londres they used strychnine, cocaine, chloroform, aspirin, &quot;horse ointment&quot; and other drugs. The story was published in &quot;Le Petit Parisien&quot; under the title &quot;Les Forçats de la Route&quot; (&#x27;The Convicts of the Road&#x27;)

On 13 July 1967, British cyclist Tom Simpson died climbing Mont Ventoux after taking amphetamine.

In 1998, the &quot;Tour of Shame&quot;, Willy Voet, soigneur for the Festina team, was arrested with erythropoietin (EPO), growth hormones, testosterone and amphetamine. Police raided team hotels and found products in the possession of the cycling team TVM. Riders went on strike. After mediation by director Jean-Marie Leblanc, police limited their tactics and riders continued. Some riders had dropped out and only 96 finished the race. It became clear in a trial that management and health officials of the Festina team had organised the doping.

Further measures were introduced by race organisers and the UCI, including more frequent testing and tests for blood doping (transfusions and EPO use). This would lead the UCI to becoming a particularly interested party in an International Olympic Committee initiative, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), created in 1999. In 2002, the wife of Raimondas Rumšas, third in the 2002 Tour de France, was arrested after EPO and anabolic steroids were found in her car. Rumšas, who had not failed a test, was not penalised. In 2004, Philippe Gaumont said doping was endemic to his Cofidis team. Fellow Cofidis rider David Millar confessed to EPO after his home was raided. In the same year, Jesús Manzano, a rider with the Kelme team, alleged he had been forced by his team to use banned substances.

From 1999 to 2005, seven successive tours were declared as having been won by Lance Armstrong. In August 2005, one month after Armstrong&#x27;s seventh apparent victory, &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; published documents it said showed Armstrong had used EPO in the 1999 race. At the same Tour, Armstrong&#x27;s urine showed traces of a glucocorticosteroid hormone, although below the positive threshold. He said he had used skin cream containing triamcinolone to treat saddle sores. Armstrong said he had received permission from the UCI to use this cream. Further allegations ultimately culminated in the United States Anti Doping Agency (USADA) disqualifying him from all his victories since 1 August 1998, including his seven consecutive Tour de France victories, and a lifetime ban from competing in professional sports. The ASO declined to name any other rider as winner in Armstrong&#x27;s stead in those years.

The 2006 Tour had been plagued by the Operación Puerto doping case before it began. Favourites such as Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso were banned by their teams a day before the start. Seventeen riders were implicated. American rider Floyd Landis, who finished the Tour as holder of the overall lead, had tested positive for testosterone after he won stage 17, but this was not confirmed until some two weeks after the race finished. On 30 June 2008 Landis lost his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and Óscar Pereiro was named as winner.

On 24 May 2007, Erik Zabel admitted using EPO during the first week of the 1996 Tour, when he won the points classification. Following his plea that other cyclists admit to drugs, former winner Bjarne Riis admitted in Copenhagen on 25 May 2007 that he used EPO regularly from 1993 to 1998, including when he won the 1996 Tour. His admission meant the top three in 1996 were all linked to doping, two admitting cheating. On 24 July 2007 Alexander Vinokourov tested positive for a blood transfusion (blood doping) after winning a time trial, prompting his Astana team to pull out and police to raid the team&#x27;s hotel. The next day Cristian Moreni tested positive for testosterone. His Cofidis team pulled out.

The same day, leader Michael Rasmussen was removed for &quot;violating internal team rules&quot; by missing random tests on 9 May and 28 June. Rasmussen claimed to have been in Mexico. The Italian journalist Davide Cassani told Danish television he had seen Rasmussen in Italy. The alleged lying prompted Rasmussen&#x27;s firing by Rabobank.

On 11 July 2008, Manuel Beltrán tested positive for EPO after the first stage. On 17 July 2008, Riccardo Riccò tested positive for continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator, a variant of EPO, after the fourth stage. In October 2008, it was revealed that Riccò&#x27;s teammate and Stage 10 winner Leonardo Piepoli, as well as Stefan Schumacher – who won both time trials – and Bernhard Kohl – third on general classification and King of the Mountains – had tested positive.

After winning the 2010 Tour de France, it was announced that Alberto Contador had tested positive for low levels of clenbuterol on 21 July rest day. On 26 January 2011, the Spanish Cycling Federation proposed a 1-year ban but reversed its ruling on 15 February and cleared Contador to race. Despite a pending appeal by the UCI, Contador finished fifth overall in the 2011 Tour de France, but in February 2012, Contador was suspended and stripped of his 2010 victory.

During the 2012 Tour, the 3rd placed rider from 2011, Fränk Schleck, tested positive for the banned diuretic Xipamide and was immediately disqualified from the Tour.

In October 2012, the United States Anti-Doping Agency released a report on doping by the U.S. Postal Service cycling team, implicating, amongst others, Armstrong. The report contained affidavits from riders including Frankie Andreu, Tyler Hamilton, George Hincapie, Floyd Landis, Levi Leipheimer, and others describing widespread use of Erythropoietin (EPO), blood transfusion, testosterone, and other banned practices in several Tours. In October 2012 the UCI acted upon this report, formally stripping Armstrong of all titles since 1 August 1998, including all seven Tour victories, and announced that his Tour wins would not be reallocated to other riders.

While no Tour winner has been convicted, or even seriously accused of doping in order to win the Tour in the past decade, due to the previous era, questions frequently arise when a strong performance exceeds expectations. While four-time champion Froome has been involved in a doping case, it is out of an abundance of caution that modern riders are kept under a microscope with bike inspections to check for &quot;mechanical doping&quot; as well as Biological Passports as officials try not to have a repeat of EPO with &#x27;H7379 Haemoglobin Human&#x27;.
Despite initially beginning as an operation to investigate the winter sport of Nordic Skiing, Operation Aderlass is of particular interest to this sport because it involved people formerly and presently involved in cycling. Including the since vacated 2008 podium finisher Bernhard Kohl, who made accusations that a team doctor instructed riders how to dope, which prompted further investigation into this matter by authorities.

==Deaths==
Cyclists who have died during the Tour de France:
* 1910: French racer Adolphe Hélière drowned at the French Riviera during a rest day.
* 1935: Spanish racer Francisco Cepeda plunged down a ravine on the Col du Galibier.
* 1967: 13 July, Stage 13: Tom Simpson died of heart failure during the ascent of Mont Ventoux. Amphetamines were found in Simpson&#x27;s jersey and blood.
* 1995: 18 July, Stage 15: Fabio Casartelli crashed at while descending the Col de Portet d&#x27;Aspet.

Another seven fatal accidents have occurred:
* 1934: A motorcyclist giving a demonstration in the velodrome of La Roche-sur-Yon, to entertain the crowd before the cyclists arrived, died after he crashed at high speed.
* 1957: 14 July: Motorcycle rider Rene Wagner and passenger Alex Virot, a journalist for Radio Luxembourg, went off a mountain road in the Spanish Pyrenees.
* 1958: An official, Constant Wouters, died from injuries received after sprinter André Darrigade collided with him at the Parc des Princes.
* 1964: Nine people died when a supply van hit a bridge in the Dordogne region, resulting in the highest tour-related death toll.
* 2000: A 12-year-old from Ginasservis, known as Phillippe, was hit by a car in the Tour de France publicity caravan.
* 2002: A seven-year-old boy, Melvin Pompele, died near Retjons after running in front of a car in the publicity caravan.
* 2009: 18 July, Stage 14: A spectator in her 60s was struck and killed by a police motorcycle while crossing a road along the route near Wittelsheim.

==Records and statistics==

One rider has been King of the Mountains, won the combination classification, combativity award, the points competition, and the Tour in the same year—Eddy Merckx in 1969, which was also the first year he participated. The following year he came close to repeating the feat, but was five points behind the winner in the points classification. The only other rider to come close to this achievement is Bernard Hinault in 1979, who won the overall and points competitions and placed second in the mountains classification.

Twice the Tour was won by a racer who never wore the yellow jersey until the race was over. In 1947, Jean Robic overturned a three-minute deficit on the final stage into Paris. In 1968, Jan Janssen of the Netherlands secured his win in the individual time trial on the last day.

The Tour has been won three times by racers who led the general classification on the first stage and holding the lead all the way to Paris. Maurice Garin did it during the Tour&#x27;s first edition, 1903; he repeated the feat the next year, but the results were nullified by the officials as a response to widespread cheating. Ottavio Bottecchia completed a GC start-to-finish sweep in 1924. And in 1928, Nicolas Frantz held the GC for the entire race, and at the end, the podium consisted solely of members of his racing team. While no one has equalled this feat since 1928, four times a racer has taken over the GC lead on the second stage and carried that lead all the way to Paris. Jacques Anquetil predicted he would wear the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification from start to finish in 1961, which he did. That year, the first day had two stages, the first part from Rouen to Versailles and the second part from Versailles to Versailles. André Darrigade wore the yellow jersey after winning the opening stage but Anquetil was in yellow at the end of the day after the time trial.

The most appearances record is held by Sylvain Chavanel, who rode his 18th and final Tour in 2018. Prior to Chavanel&#x27;s final Tour, he shared the record with George Hincapie with 17. In light of Hincapie&#x27;s suspension for use of performance-enhancing drugs, before which he held the mark for most consecutive finishes with sixteen, having completed all but his first, Joop Zoetemelk and Chavanel share the record for the most finishes at 16, with Zoetemelk having completed all 16 of the Tours that he started. Of these 16 Tours Zoetemelk came in the top five 11 times, a record, finished 2nd six times, a record, and won the 1980 Tour de France.

Between 1920 and 1985, Jules Deloffre (1885–1963) was the record holder for the number of participations in the Tour de France, and even sole holder of this record until 1966, when André Darrigade rode in his 14th Tour.

In the early years of the Tour, cyclists rode individually, and were sometimes forbidden to ride together. This led to large gaps between the winner and the number two. Since the cyclists now tend to stay together in a peloton, the margins of the winner have become smaller, as the difference usually originates from time trials, breakaways or on mountain top finishes, or from being left behind the peloton. The smallest margins between the winner and the second placed cyclists at the end of the Tour is 8 seconds between winner Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon in 1989. The largest margin, by comparison, remains that of the first Tour in 1903: 2h 49m 45s between Maurice Garin and Lucien Pothier.

The most podium places by a single rider is eight by Raymond Poulidor, followed by Bernard Hinault and Joop Zoetemelk with seven. Poulidor never finished in 1st place and neither Hinault nor Zoetemelk ever finished in 3rd place.

Lance Armstrong finished on the podium eight times, and Jan Ullrich seven times, however they both had results voided and now officially have zero and six podiums respectively.

Three riders have won 8 stages in a single year: Charles Pélissier (1930), Eddy Merckx (1970, 1974), and Freddy Maertens (1976). Mark Cavendish has the most mass finish stage wins with 35 as of 2024, ahead of André Darrigade and André Leducq with 22, François Faber with 19, and Eddy Merckx with 18. The youngest Tour de France stage winner is Fabio Battesini, who was 19 when he won one stage in the 1931 Tour de France.

The fastest massed-start stage was in 1999 from Laval to Blois (), won by Mario Cipollini at . The fastest time-trial is Rohan Dennis&#x27;s stage 1 of the 2015 Tour de France in Utrecht, won at an average of . The fastest stage win was by the 2013 Orica GreenEDGE team in a team time-trial. It completed the in Nice (stage 5) at .

The longest successful post-war breakaway by a single rider was by Albert Bourlon in the 1947 Tour de France. In the Carcassonne–Luchon stage, he stayed away for . It was one of seven breakaways longer than , the last being Thierry Marie&#x27;s escape in 1991. Bourlon finished 16 m 30s ahead. This is one of the biggest time gaps but not the greatest. That record belongs to José-Luis Viejo, who beat the peloton by just over 23:00 and the second place rider by 22 m 50s in the Montgenèvre-Manosque stage in 1976. He was the fourth and most recent rider to win a stage by more than 20 minutes.

The record for total number of days wearing the yellow jersey is 96, held by Eddy Merckx. Bernard Hinault, Miguel Induráin, Chris Froome and Jacques Anquetil are the only other riders who have worn it 50 days or more.

===Record winners===
Four riders have won five times: Jacques Anquetil (FRA), Eddy Merckx (BEL), Bernard Hinault (FRA), and Miguel Induráin (ESP). Indurain achieved the mark with a record five consecutive wins.

L&#x27;Étape du Tour (French for &#x27;stage of the Tour&#x27;) is an organised mass participation cyclosportive event that allows amateur cyclists to race over the same route as a Tour de France stage. First held in 1993, and now organised by the ASO, in conjunction with &quot;Vélo Magazine&quot;, it takes place each July, normally on a Tour rest day.

Several different versions of a Tour de France for women were held between the 1980s and 2000s, however these races failed for a variety of reasons such as high costs, lack of sponsorship and inability to use the Tour de France branding.

Following a campaign by the professional women&#x27;s peloton, La Course by Le Tour de France was launched by ASO in 2014 as a one-day classic held in conjunction with the men&#x27;s race. The first edition was held on the Champs-Élysées prior to the final stage of the men&#x27;s race, with La Course subsequently using other stages of the Tour prior to the men&#x27;s race – with locations such as Pau, Col de la Colombière and Col d&#x27;Izoard. The race was part of the UCI Women&#x27;s World Tour.

From 2022, Tour de France Femmes – an 8-day stage race in the UCI Women&#x27;s World Tour – was held following the Tour, replacing La Course. The Tour de France Femmes had its first stage on the Champs-Élysées prior to the final stage of the men&#x27;s race. The announcement of the race was praised by the professional peloton and campaigners. The first edition was won by Dutch rider Annemiek van Vleuten, completing a Giro – Tour double in the same year.

On the other hand, some events related to Tour de France have been held by ASO, around the world. Tour de France Saitama criterium has been held in Saitama, Japan since 2013. 
After the success in Japan, Tour de France Singapore criterium has been held in Singapore since 2022.

<text>Thiamine, also known as thiamin and vitamin B1, is a vitamin – an essential micronutrient for humans and animals. It is found in food and commercially synthesized to be a dietary supplement or medication. Phosphorylated forms of thiamine are required for some metabolic reactions, including the breakdown of glucose and amino acids.

Food sources of thiamine include whole grains, legumes, and some meats and fish. Grain processing removes much of the vitamin content, so in many countries cereals and flours are enriched with thiamine. Supplements and medications are available to treat and prevent thiamine deficiency and the disorders that result from it such as beriberi and Wernicke encephalopathy. They are also used to treat maple syrup urine disease and Leigh syndrome. Supplements and medications are typically taken by mouth, but may also be given by intravenous or intramuscular injection.

Thiamine supplements are generally well tolerated. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur when repeated doses are given by injection. Thiamine is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication, and in some countries as a non-prescription dietary supplement. In 2022, it was the 288th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 500,000 prescriptions.

==Definition==
Thiamine is one of the B vitamins and is also known as vitamin B1. It is a cation that is usually supplied as a chloride salt. It is soluble in water, methanol and glycerol, but practically insoluble in less polar organic solvents. In the body, thiamine can form derivatives; the most well-characterized of which is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), a coenzyme in the catabolism of sugars and amino acids.

The chemical structure consists of an aminopyrimidine and a thiazolium ring linked by a methylene bridge. The thiazole is substituted with methyl and hydroxyethyl side chains. Thiamine is stable at acidic pH, but it is unstable in alkaline solutions and from exposure to heat. It reacts strongly in Maillard-type reactions. Oxidation yields the fluorescent derivative thiochrome, which can be used to determine the amount of the vitamin present in biological samples.

==Deficiency==

Well-known disorders caused by thiamine deficiency include beriberi, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, optic neuropathy, Leigh&#x27;s disease, African seasonal ataxia (or Nigerian seasonal ataxia), and central pontine myelinolysis. Symptoms include malaise, weight loss, irritability and confusion.

In Western countries, chronic alcoholism is a risk factor for deficiency. Also at risk are older adults, persons with HIV/AIDS or diabetes, and those who have had bariatric surgery. Varying degrees of thiamine insufficiency have been associated with the long-term use of diuretics.

== Biological functions ==

Five natural thiamine phosphate derivatives are known: thiamine monophosphate (ThMP), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), thiamine triphosphate (ThTP), adenosine thiamine diphosphate (AThDP) and adenosine thiamine triphosphate (AThTP). They are involved in many cellular processes. The best-characterized form is TPP, a coenzyme in the catabolism of sugars and amino acids. While its role is well-known, the non-coenzyme action of thiamine and derivatives may be realized through binding to proteins which do not use that mechanism. No physiological role is known for the monophosphate except as an intermediate in cellular conversion of thiamine to the di- and triphosphates.

===Thiamine pyrophosphate===


Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), also called thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), participates as a coenzyme in metabolic reactions, including those in which polarity inversion takes place. Its synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme thiamine diphosphokinase according to the reaction thiamine + ATP → TPP + AMP (EC 2.7.6.2). However, recent findings reveal that uridine 5′-triphosphate (UTP), rather than ATP, is the preferred substrate for TPP synthesis in cells, with TPK1 showing a ~10-fold higher affinity for UTP. TPP is a coenzyme for several enzymes that catalyze the transfer of two-carbon units and in particular the dehydrogenation (decarboxylation and subsequent conjugation with coenzyme A) of 2-oxoacids (alpha-keto acids). The mechanism of action of TPP as a coenzyme relies on its ability to form an ylide. Examples include:
* Present in most species
** pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (also called α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase)
** branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase
** 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase
** transketolase
* Present in some species:
** pyruvate decarboxylase (in yeast)
** several additional bacterial enzymes

The enzymes transketolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) are important in carbohydrate metabolism. PDH links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle. OGDH catalyzes the overall conversion of 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) to succinyl-CoA and CO2 during the citric acid cycle. The reaction catalyzed by OGDH is a rate-limiting step in the citric acid cycle. The cytosolic enzyme transketolase is central to the pentose phosphate pathway, a major route for the biosynthesis of the pentose sugars deoxyribose and ribose. The mitochondrial PDH and OGDH are part of biochemical pathways that result in the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main energy transfer molecule for the cell. In the nervous system, PDH is also involved in the synthesis of myelin and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

=== Thiamine triphosphate ===

ThTP is implicated in chloride channel activation in the neurons of mammals and other animals, although its role is not well understood. ThTP has been found in bacteria, fungi and plants, suggesting that it has other cellular roles. In &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, it is implicated in the response to amino acid starvation.

===Adenosine derivatives===

AThDP exists in small amounts in vertebrate liver, but its role remains unknown.

AThTP is present in &quot;E. coli&quot;, where it accumulates as a result of carbon starvation. In this bacterium, AThTP may account for up to of total thiamine. It also exists in lesser amounts in yeast, roots of higher plants and animal tissue.

==Medical uses==

During pregnancy, thiamine is sent to the fetus via the placenta. Pregnant women have a greater requirement for the vitamin than other adults, especially during the third trimester. Pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum are at an increased risk of thiamine deficiency due to losses when vomiting. In lactating women, thiamine is delivered in breast milk even if it results in thiamine deficiency in the mother.

Thiamine is important not only for mitochondrial membrane development, but also for synaptic membrane function. It has also been suggested that a deficiency hinders brain development in infants and may be a cause of sudden infant death syndrome.

==Dietary recommendations==
The US National Academy of Medicine updated the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for thiamine in 1998. The EARs for thiamine for women and men aged 14 and over are 0.9 mg/day and 1.1 mg/day, respectively; the RDAs are 1.1 and 1.2 mg/day, respectively. RDAs are higher than EARs to provide adequate intake levels for individuals with higher than average requirements. The RDA during pregnancy and for lactating females is 1.4 mg/day. For infants up to the age of 12 months, the Adequate Intake (AI) is 0.2–0.3 mg/day and for children aged 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 0.5 to 0.9 mg/day.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intakes (PRIs) instead of RDAs, and Average Requirements instead of EARs. For women (including those pregnant or lactating), men and children the PRI is 0.1 mg thiamine per megajoule (MJ) of energy in their diet. As the conversion is 1 MJ = 239 kcal, an adult consuming 2390 kilocalories ought to be consuming 1.0 mg thiamine. This is slightly lower than the US RDA.

Neither the National Academy of Medicine nor EFSA have set an upper intake level for thiamine, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses.

===Safety===
Thiamine is generally well tolerated and non-toxic when administered orally. There are rare reports of adverse side effects when thiamine is given intravenously, including allergic reactions, nausea, lethargy, and impaired coordination.

===Labeling===
For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value. Since 27 May 2016, the Daily Value has been 1.2 mg, in line with the RDA.

==Sources==
Thiamine is found in a wide variety of processed and whole foods, including lentils, peas, whole grains, pork, and nuts. A typical daily prenatal vitamin product contains around 1.5 mg of thiamine.

===Food fortification===

Some countries require or recommend fortification of grain foods such as wheat, rice or maize (corn) because processing lowers vitamin content. As of February 2022, 59 countries, mostly in North and Sub-Saharan Africa, require food fortification of wheat, rice or maize with thiamine or thiamine mononitrate. The amounts stipulated range from 2.0 to 10.0 mg/kg. An additional 18 countries have a voluntary fortification program. For example, the Indian government recommends 3.5 mg/kg for &quot;maida&quot; (white) and &quot;atta&quot; (whole wheat) flour.

==Synthesis==
===Biosynthesis===
Thiamine biosynthesis occurs in bacteria, some protozoans, plants, and fungi. The thiazole and pyrimidine moieties are biosynthesized separately and are then combined to form ThMP by the action of thiamine-phosphate synthase.

The pyrimidine ring system is formed in a reaction catalysed by phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase (ThiC), an enzyme in the radical SAM superfamily of iron–sulfur proteins, which use S-adenosyl methionine as a cofactor.

The starting material is 5-aminoimidazole ribotide, which undergoes a rearrangement reaction via radical intermediates which incorporate the blue, green and red fragments shown into the product.

The thiazole ring is formed in a reaction catalysed by thiazole synthase (EC 2.8.1.10). The ultimate precursors are 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate, 2-iminoacetate and a sulfur carrier protein called ThiS. An additional protein, ThiG, is also required to bring together all the components of the ring at the enzyme active site.


The final step to form ThMP involves decarboxylation of the thiazole intermediate, which reacts with the pyrophosphate derivative of phosphomethylpyrimidine, itself a product of a kinase, phosphomethylpyrimidine kinase.

The biosynthetic pathways differ among organisms. In &quot;E. coli&quot; and other enterobacteriaceae, ThMP is phosphorylated to the cofactor TPP by a thiamine-phosphate kinase (ThMP + ATP → TPP + ADP). In most bacteria and in eukaryotes, ThMP is hydrolyzed to thiamine and then pyrophosphorylated to TPP by thiamine diphosphokinase (thiamine + ATP → TPP + AMP).

The biosynthetic pathways are regulated by riboswitches. If there is sufficient thiamine present in the cell then the thiamine binds to the mRNAs for the enzymes that are required in the pathway and prevents their translation. If there is no thiamine present then there is no inhibition, and the enzymes required for the biosynthesis are produced. The specific riboswitch, the TPP riboswitch, is the only known riboswitch found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms.

===Laboratory synthesis===
In the first total synthesis in 1936, ethyl 3-ethoxypropanoate was treated with ethyl formate to give an intermediate dicarbonyl compound which when reacted with acetamidine formed a substituted pyrimidine. Conversion of its hydroxyl group to an amino group was carried out by nucleophilic aromatic substitution, first to the chloride derivative using phosphorus oxychloride, followed by treatment with ammonia. The ethoxy group was then converted to a bromo derivative using hydrobromic acid. In the final stage, thiamine (as its dibromide salt) was formed in an alkylation reaction using 4-methyl-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)thiazole.

===Industrial synthesis===

Merck &amp; Co. adapted the 1936 laboratory-scale synthesis, allowing them to manufacture thiamine in Rahway in 1937. However, an alternative route using the intermediate Grewe diamine (5-(aminomethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyrimidinamine), first published in 1937, was investigated by Hoffman La Roche and competitive manufacturing processes followed. Efficient routes to the diamine have continued to be of interest. In the European Economic Area, thiamine is registered under REACH regulation and between 100 and 1,000 tonnes per annum are manufactured or imported there.

===Synthetic analogues===
Many vitamin B1 analogues, such as Benfotiamine, fursultiamine, and sulbutiamine, are synthetic derivatives of thiamine. Most were developed in Japan in the 1950s and 1960s as forms that were intended to improve absorption compared to thiamine. Some are approved for use in some countries as a drug or non-prescription dietary supplement for treatment of diabetic neuropathy or other health conditions.

==Absorption, metabolism and excretion==
In the upper small intestine, thiamine phosphate esters present in food are hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase enzymes. At low concentrations (&lt;2 μmol l−1), the absorption process is carrier-mediated. At higher concentrations, absorption also occurs via passive diffusion. Active transport can be inhibited by alcohol consumption or by folate deficiency.

The majority of thiamine in serum is circulating bound to albumin, with over () in erythrocytes (red blood cells), and is delivered to cells with high metabolic needs—particularly those in the brain, liver, pancreas, heart, and skeletal and smooth muscles, including cardiac muscle cells. A specific binding protein called thiamine-binding protein has been identified in rat serum and is believed to be a hormone-regulated carrier protein important for tissue distribution of thiamine. Uptake of thiamine by cells of the blood and other tissues occurs via active transport and passive diffusion. Two members of the family of transporter proteins encoded by the genes SLC19A2 and SLC19A3 are capable of thiamine transport. In some tissues, thiamine uptake and secretion appear to be mediated by a Na+-dependent transporter and a transcellular proton gradient.

Human storage of thiamine is about 25 to 50 mg, with the greatest concentrations in liver, skeletal muscle, heart, brain, and kidneys. ThMP and free (unphosphorylated) thiamine are present in plasma, milk, cerebrospinal fluid, and, it is presumed, all extracellular fluid. Unlike the highly phosphorylated forms of thiamine, ThMP and free thiamine are capable of crossing cell membranes. Calcium and magnesium have been shown to affect the distribution of thiamine in the body and magnesium deficiency has been shown to aggravate thiamine deficiency. Thiamine contents in human tissues are less than those of other species. The half-life of thiamine content stored in tissues of human body is about 9-18 days, while after intake in high doses, the half-life of thiamine in circulating blood is about one to 12 hours. Additionally, thiamine pyrophosphate derived from pyrimidines supports lipid synthesis and adipogenesis, highlighting its role in energy storage and cellular differentiation.

Thiamine and its metabolites (2-methyl-4-amino-5-pyrimidine carboxylic acid, 4-methyl-thiazole-5-acetic acid, and others) are excreted principally in the urine.

===Interference===
The bioavailability of thiamine in foods can be interfered with in a variety of ways. Sulfites, added to foods as a preservative, will attack thiamine at the methylene bridge, cleaving the pyrimidine ring from the thiazole ring. The rate of this reaction is increased under acidic conditions. Thiamine is degraded by thermolabile thiaminases present in some species of fish, shellfish and other foods. The pupae of an African silk worm, &quot;Anaphe venata&quot;, is a traditional food in Nigeria. Consumption leads to thiamine deficiency. Older literature reported that in Thailand, consumption of fermented, uncooked fish caused thiamine deficiency, but either abstaining from eating the fish or heating it first reversed the deficiency. In ruminants, intestinal bacteria synthesize thiamine and thiaminases. The bacterial thiaminases are cell surface enzymes that must dissociate from the cell membrane before being activated; the dissociation can occur in ruminants under acidotic conditions. In dairy cows, over-feeding with grain causes subacute ruminal acidosis and increased ruminal bacteria thiaminase release, resulting in thiamine deficiency.

From reports on two small studies conducted in Thailand, chewing slices of areca nut wrapped in betel leaves and chewing tea leaves reduced food thiamine bioavailability by a mechanism that may involve tannins.

Bariatric surgery for weight loss is known to interfere with vitamin absorption. A meta-analysis reported that of people who underwent bariatric surgeries experience vitamin B1 deficiency.

==History==

Thiamine was the first of the water-soluble vitamins to be isolated. The earliest observations in humans and in chickens had shown that diets of primarily polished white rice caused beriberi, but did not attribute it to the absence of a previously unknown essential nutrient.

In 1884, Takaki Kanehiro, a surgeon general in the Imperial Japanese Navy, rejected the previous germ theory for beriberi and suggested instead that the disease was due to insufficiencies in the diet. Switching diets on a navy ship, he discovered that replacing a diet of white rice only with one also containing barley, meat, milk, bread, and vegetables, nearly eliminated beriberi on a nine-month sea voyage. However, Takaki had added many foods to the successful diet and he incorrectly attributed the benefit to increased protein intake, as vitamins were unknown at the time. The Navy was not convinced of the need for such an expensive program of dietary improvement, and many men continued to die of beriberi, even during the Russo-Japanese war of 1904–5. Not until 1905, after the anti-beriberi factor had been discovered in rice bran (removed by polishing into white rice) and in barley bran, was Takaki&#x27;s experiment rewarded. He was made a baron in the Japanese peerage system, after which he was affectionately called &quot;Barley Baron&quot;.

The specific connection to grain was made in 1897 by Christiaan Eijkman, a military doctor in the Dutch East Indies, who discovered that fowl fed on a diet of cooked, polished rice developed paralysis that could be reversed by discontinuing rice polishing. He attributed beriberi to the high levels of starch in rice being toxic. He believed that the toxicity was countered in a compound present in the rice polishings. An associate, Gerrit Grijns, correctly interpreted the connection between excessive consumption of polished rice and beriberi in 1901: He concluded that rice contains an essential nutrient in the outer layers of the grain that is removed by polishing. Eijkman was eventually awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1929, because his observations led to the discovery of vitamins.

In 1910, a Japanese agricultural chemist of Tokyo Imperial University, Umetaro Suzuki, isolated a water-soluble thiamine compound from rice bran, which he named &quot;aberic acid&quot;. (He later renamed it &quot;Orizanin&quot;.) He described the compound as not only an anti-beriberi factor, but also as being essential to human nutrition; however, this finding failed to gain publicity outside of Japan, because a claim that the compound was a new finding was omitted in translation of his publication from Japanese to German. In 1911 a Polish biochemist Casimir Funk isolated the substance from rice bran (the modern thiamine) that he called a &quot;vitamine&quot; (on account of its containing an amino group). However, Funk did not completely characterize its chemical structure. Dutch chemists, Barend Coenraad Petrus Jansen and his closest collaborator Willem Frederik Donath, went on to isolate and crystallize the active agent in 1926, whose structure was determined by Robert Runnels Williams, in 1934. Thiamine was named by the Williams team as a portmanteau of &quot;thio&quot; (meaning sulfur-containing) and &quot;vitamin&quot;. The term &quot;vitamin&quot; coming indirectly, by way of Funk, from the amine group of thiamine itself (although by this time, vitamins were known to not always be amines, for example, vitamin C). Thiamine was also synthesized by the Williams group in 1936.

Sir Rudolph Peters, in Oxford, used pigeons to understand how thiamine deficiency results in the pathological-physiological symptoms of beriberi. Pigeons fed exclusively on polished rice developed opisthotonos, a condition characterized by head retraction. If not treated, the animals died after a few days. Administration of thiamine after opisthotonos was observed led to a complete cure within 30 minutes. As no morphological modifications were seen in the brain of the pigeons before and after treatment with thiamine, Peters introduced the concept of a biochemical-induced injury. In 1937, Lohmann and Schuster showed that the diphosphorylated thiamine derivative, TPP, was a cofactor required for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate.

<text>Thomas Cranmer (2 July 1489 – 21 March 1556) was a theologian, leader of the English Reformation and Archbishop of Canterbury during the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI and, for a short time, Mary I. He is honoured as a martyr in the Church of England.

Cranmer helped build the case for the annulment of Henry&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Aragon, which was one of the causes of the separation of the English Church from union with the Holy See. Along with Thomas Cromwell, he supported the principle of royal supremacy, in which the king was considered sovereign over the Church within his realm and protector of his people from the abuses of Rome. During Cranmer&#x27;s tenure as Archbishop of Canterbury, he established the first doctrinal and liturgical structures of the reformed Church of England. Under Henry&#x27;s rule, Cranmer did not make many radical changes in the Church due to power struggles between religious conservatives and reformers. He published the first officially authorised vernacular service, the &quot;Exhortation and Litany&quot;. 

When Edward, who was devout and had been raised in the tenets of a reformed Church came to the throne, Cranmer was able to promote faster changes. He wrote and compiled the first two editions of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, a complete liturgy for the English Church, turning to the language of the people. With the assistance of several Continental reformers to whom he gave refuge, he changed doctrine or discipline in areas such as the Eucharist, clerical celibacy, the role of images in places of worship, and the veneration of saints. Cranmer promulgated the new doctrines through the prayer book, the &quot;Homilies&quot; and other publications.

After the accession of the Catholic Mary I, Cranmer was put on trial for treason and heresy. Imprisoned for over two years and under pressure from state and Church authorities, he made several recantations and reconciled himself with the Catholic Church. While this would have customarily absolved him from the heresy charge, Mary wanted him executed on the treason charge, and he was burned at the stake on 21 March 1556; on the day of his execution, he publicly withdrew his recantations, to die a heretic to Catholics and a martyr for the principles of the English Reformation. Cranmer&#x27;s death was immortalised in &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot; and his legacy lives on within the Church of England through the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; and the &quot;Thirty-nine Articles&quot;, an Anglican statement of faith derived from his work.

==Origins==

Cranmer was born in 1489 at Aslockton in Nottinghamshire, England. He was a younger son of Thomas Cranmer by his wife Agnes Hatfield. Thomas Cranmer was of modest wealth but was from a well-established armigerous gentry family which took its name from the manor of Cranmer in Lincolnshire. A ledger stone to one of his relatives in the Church of St John of Beverley, Whatton, near Aslockton is inscribed as follows: &quot;Hic jacet Thomas Cranmer, Armiger, qui obiit vicesimo septimo die mensis Maii, anno d(omi)ni. MD centesimo primo, cui(us) a(n)i(ma)e p(ro)p(i)cietur Deus Amen&quot; (&quot;here lies Thomas Cranmer, Esquire, who died on the 27th day of May in the year of our lord 1501, on whose soul may God look upon with mercy&quot;). The arms of the Cranmer and Aslockton families are displayed. The figure is that of a man with flowing hair and gown and a purse on his right side. Their oldest son, John Cranmer, inherited the family estate, while Thomas and his younger brother, Edmund, were placed on the path to clerical careers.

==Early years (1489–1527)==
Historians know nothing definite about Cranmer&#x27;s early schooling. He probably attended a grammar school in his village. At 14, two years after his father&#x27;s death, he was sent to the newly created Jesus College, Cambridge. It took him eight years to attain his Bachelor of Arts degree, following a curriculum of logic, classical literature, and philosophy. During this time, he began to collect medieval scholastic books, which he preserved faithfully throughout his life. For his master&#x27;s degree he studied the humanists Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples and Erasmus. He finished the course in three years. Shortly after receiving his Master of Arts degree in 1515, he was elected to a fellowship of Jesus College.

Sometime after Cranmer took his MA, he married a woman named Joan. Although he was not yet a priest, he was obliged to give up his fellowship, resulting in losing his residence at Jesus College. To support himself and his wife, he took a job as a reader at Buckingham Hall (later reformed as Magdalene College). When Joan died during her first childbirth, Jesus College showed its regard for Cranmer by reinstating his fellowship. He began studying theology, and by 1520, he had been ordained, the university already having named him as one of its preachers. He received his Doctor of Divinity degree in 1526.

Not much is known about Cranmer&#x27;s thoughts and experiences during his three decades at Cambridge. Traditionally, he has been portrayed as a humanist whose enthusiasm for biblical scholarship prepared him to adopt Lutheran ideas, which were spreading during the 1520s. A study of his marginalia reveals an early antipathy to Martin Luther and an admiration for Erasmus. When Cardinal Wolsey, the King&#x27;s Lord Chancellor, selected several Cambridge scholars, including Edward Lee, Stephen Gardiner and Richard Sampson, to be diplomats throughout Europe, Cranmer was chosen for an embassy to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. His supposed participation in an earlier embassy to Spain mentioned in the older literature, has proved to be spurious.

==In the service of Henry VIII (1527–1532)==
Henry VIII&#x27;s first marriage arose from the death of his older brother, Arthur, in 1502. Their father, Henry VII, betrothed Arthur&#x27;s widow, Catherine of Aragon, to the future king. The marriage immediately raised questions about the biblical prohibition (in Leviticus 18 and 20) against marriage to a brother&#x27;s wife. The couple married in 1509, and after a series of miscarriages, a daughter, Mary, was born in 1516. By the 1520s, Henry still did not have a son to name as heir, and he took this as a sure sign of God&#x27;s anger and made overtures to the Vatican about an annulment. He gave Cardinal Wolsey the task of prosecuting his case; Wolsey began by consulting university experts. From 1527, Cranmer assisted with the annulment proceedings in addition to his duties as a Cambridge don.

In mid-1529, Cranmer stayed with relatives in Waltham Holy Cross to avoid an outbreak of the plague in Cambridge. Two of his Cambridge associates, Stephen Gardiner and Edward Foxe, joined him. The three discussed the annulment issue and Cranmer suggested putting aside the legal case in Rome in favour of a general canvassing of opinions from university theologians throughout Europe. Henry showed much interest in the idea when Gardiner and Foxe presented him with this plan. It is unknown whether the King or his new Lord Chancellor, Thomas More, explicitly approved the plan. Eventually, it was implemented, and Cranmer was requested to join the royal team in Rome to gather university opinions. Edward Foxe coordinated the research effort and the team produced the &quot;Collectanea satis copiosa&quot; (&quot;The Sufficiently Abundant Collections&quot;) and &quot;The Determinations&quot;, historical and theological support for the argument that the King exercised supreme jurisdiction within his realm.

Cranmer&#x27;s first contact with a Continental reformer was with Simon Grynaeus, a humanist based in Basel, Switzerland, and a follower of the Swiss reformers, Huldrych Zwingli and Johannes Oecolampadius. In mid-1531, Grynaeus took an extended visit to England to offer himself as an intermediary between the King and the Continental reformers. He struck up a friendship with Cranmer and after his return to Basel, he wrote about Cranmer to the German reformer Martin Bucer in Strasbourg. Grynaeus&#x27; early contacts initiated Cranmer&#x27;s eventual relationship with the Strasbourg and Swiss reformers.

In January 1532, Cranmer was appointed the resident ambassador at the court of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. As the Emperor travelled throughout his realms, Cranmer had to follow him to his residence in Regensburg. He passed through the Lutheran city of Nuremberg and saw for the first time the effects of the Reformation. When the Imperial Diet was moved to Nuremberg, he met the leading architect of the Nuremberg reforms, Andreas Osiander. They became good friends, and during that July Cranmer took the surprising action of marrying Margarete, the niece of Osiander&#x27;s wife. He did not take her as his mistress, as was the prevailing custom with priests for whom celibacy was too rigorous. Scholars note that Cranmer had moved, however moderately at this stage, into identifying with certain Lutheran principles. This progress in his personal life was not matched in his political life as he was unable to persuade Charles, Catherine&#x27;s nephew, to support the annulment of his aunt&#x27;s marriage.

==Appointed Archbishop of Canterbury (1532–1534)==

While Cranmer was following Charles through Italy, he received a royal letter dated 1 October 1532 informing him that he had been appointed the new Archbishop of Canterbury, following the death of Archbishop William Warham. Cranmer was ordered to return to England. The appointment had been secured by the family of Anne Boleyn, who was being courted by Henry. When Cranmer&#x27;s promotion became known in London, it caused great surprise as Cranmer had previously held only minor positions in the Church. Cranmer left Mantua on 19 November and arrived in England at the beginning of January. Henry personally financed the papal bulls necessary for Cranmer&#x27;s promotion to Canterbury. The bulls were easily acquired because the papal nuncio was under orders from Rome to please the English in an effort to prevent a final breach. The bulls arrived around 26 March 1533 and Cranmer was consecrated as a bishop on 30 March in St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel, by John Longland, Bishop of Lincoln; John Vesey, Bishop of Exeter; and Henry Standish, Bishop of St Asaph. Even while they were waiting for the bulls, Cranmer continued to work on the annulment proceedings, which required greater urgency after Anne announced her pregnancy. Henry and Anne were secretly married on 24 or 25 January 1533 in the presence of a handful of witnesses. Cranmer did not learn of the marriage until 14 days later.

For the next few months, Cranmer and the King worked on establishing legal procedures on how the monarch&#x27;s marriage would be judged by his most senior clergy. Several drafts of the procedures have been preserved in letters written between the two. Once procedures were agreed upon, Cranmer opened court sessions on 10 May, inviting Henry and Catherine of Aragon to appear. Gardiner represented the King; Catherine did not appear or send a proxy. On 23 May Cranmer pronounced the judgement that Henry&#x27;s marriage with Catherine was against the law of God. He even issued a threat of excommunication if Henry did not stay away from Catherine. Henry was now free to marry and, on 28 May, Cranmer validated Henry and Anne&#x27;s marriage. On 1 June, Cranmer personally crowned and anointed Anne queen and delivered to her the sceptre and rod. Pope Clement VII was furious at this defiance, but he could not take decisive action as he was pressured by other monarchs to avoid an irreparable breach with England. On 9 July he provisionally excommunicated Henry and his advisers (who included Cranmer) unless he repudiated Anne by the end of September. Henry kept Anne as his wife and, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Elizabeth. Cranmer baptised her immediately afterwards and acted as one of her godparents.

It is difficult to assess how Cranmer&#x27;s theological views had evolved since his Cambridge days. There is evidence that he continued to support humanism; he renewed Erasmus&#x27; pension that had previously been granted by Archbishop Warham. In June 1533, he was confronted with the difficult tasks not only of disciplining a reformer, but also of seeing him burned at the stake. John Frith was condemned to death for his views on the eucharist: he denied the real presence. Cranmer personally tried to persuade him to change his views without success. Although he rejected Frith&#x27;s radicalism, by 1534 he clearly signalled that he had broken with Rome and that he had set a new theological course. He supported the cause of reform by gradually replacing the old guard in his ecclesiastical province with men such as Hugh Latimer who followed the new thinking. He intervened in religious disputes, supporting reformers, to the disappointment of religious conservatives who desired to maintain the link with Rome.

==Under the vicegerency (1535–1538)==

Cranmer was not immediately accepted by the bishops within his province. When he attempted a canonical visitation, he had to avoid locations where a resident conservative bishop might make an embarrassing personal challenge to his authority. In 1535, Cranmer had difficult encounters with several bishops, John Stokesley, John Longland, and Stephen Gardiner among others. They objected to Cranmer&#x27;s power and title and argued that the Act of Supremacy did not define his role. This prompted Thomas Cromwell, the King&#x27;s chief minister, to activate and to take the office of the vicegerent, the deputy supreme head of ecclesiastical affairs. He created another set of institutions that gave a clear structure to the royal supremacy. Hence, the archbishop was eclipsed by Vicegerent Cromwell in regard to the King&#x27;s spiritual jurisdiction. There is no evidence that Cranmer resented his position as junior partner. Although he was an exceptional scholar, he lacked the political ability to outface even clerical opponents. Those tasks were left to Cromwell.

On 29 January 1536, when Anne miscarried a son, the King began to reflect again on the biblical prohibitions that had haunted him during his marriage with Catherine of Aragon. Shortly after the miscarriage, the King started to take an interest in Jane Seymour. By 24 April, he had commissioned Cromwell to prepare the case for a divorce. Unaware of these plans, Cranmer had continued to write letters to Cromwell on minor matters up to 22 April. Anne was sent to the Tower of London on 2 May, and Cranmer was urgently summoned by Cromwell. On the very next day, Cranmer wrote a letter to the King expressing his doubts about the Queen&#x27;s guilt, highlighting his own esteem for Anne. After it was delivered, Cranmer was resigned to the fact that the end of Anne&#x27;s marriage was inevitable. On 16 May, he saw Anne in the Tower and heard her confession and the following day, he pronounced the marriage null and void. Two days later, Anne was executed; Cranmer was one of the few who publicly mourned her death.

The vicegerency brought the pace of reforms under the control of the King. A balance was instituted between the conservatives and the reformers and this was seen in the &quot;Ten Articles&quot;, the first attempt at defining the beliefs of the Henrician Church. The articles had a two-part structure. The first five articles showed the influence of the reformers by recognising only three of the former seven sacraments: baptism, eucharist, and penance. The last five articles concerned the roles of images, saints, rites and ceremonies, and purgatory, and they reflected the views of the traditionalists. Two early drafts of the document have been preserved and show different teams of theologians at work. The competition between the conservatives and reformers is revealed in rival editorial corrections made by Cranmer and Cuthbert Tunstall, the bishop of Durham. The end product had something that pleased and annoyed both sides of the debate. By 11 July, Cranmer, Cromwell, and the Convocation, the general assembly of the clergy, had subscribed to the &quot;Ten Articles&quot;.

In late 1536, the north of England was convulsed in a series of uprisings collectively known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, the most serious opposition to Henry&#x27;s policies. Cromwell and Cranmer were the primary targets of the protesters&#x27; fury. Cromwell and the King worked furiously to quell the rebellion, while Cranmer kept a low profile. After it was clear that Henry&#x27;s regime was safe, the government took the initiative to remedy the evident inadequacy of the &quot;Ten Articles&quot;. The outcome after months of debate was &quot;The Institution of a Christian Man&quot; informally known from the first issue as the Bishops&#x27; Book. The book was initially proposed in February 1537 in the first vicegerential synod, ordered by Cromwell, for the whole Church. Cromwell opened the proceedings, but as the synod progressed, Cranmer and Foxe took on the chairmanship and the co-ordination. Foxe did most of the final editing and the book was published in late September.

Even after publication, the book&#x27;s status remained vague because the King had not given his full support to it. In a draft letter, Henry noted that he had not read the book, but supported its printing. His attention was most likely occupied by the pregnancy of Jane Seymour and the birth of the male heir, Edward, that Henry had sought for so long. Jane died shortly after giving birth and her funeral was held on 12 November. That month Henry started to work on the Bishops&#x27; Book; his amendments were sent to Cranmer, Sampson, and others for comment. Cranmer&#x27;s responses to the King were far more confrontational than his colleagues&#x27; and he wrote at much greater length. They reveal unambiguous statements supporting reformed theology such as justification by faith or &quot;sola fide&quot; (faith alone) and predestination. His words did not convince the King. A new statement of faith was delayed until 1543 with the publication of the King&#x27;s Book.

In 1538, the King and Cromwell arranged with Lutheran princes to have detailed discussions on forming a political and religious alliance. Henry had been seeking a new embassy from the Schmalkaldic League since mid-1537. The Lutherans were delighted by this and they sent a joint delegation from various German cities, including a colleague of Martin Luther&#x27;s, Friedrich Myconius. The delegates arrived in England on 27 May 1538. After initial meetings with the King, Cromwell, and Cranmer, discussions on theological differences were transferred to Lambeth Palace under Cranmer&#x27;s chairmanship. Progress on an agreement was slow partly owing to Cromwell being too busy to help expedite the proceedings and partly because the negotiating team on the English side was evenly balanced between conservatives and reformers. The talks dragged on with the Germans becoming weary despite the Archbishop&#x27;s strenuous efforts. The negotiations were fatally neutralised by an appointee of the King. Cranmer&#x27;s colleague, Edward Foxe, who sat on Henry&#x27;s Privy Council, had died earlier in the year. The King chose as his replacement Cranmer&#x27;s conservative rival, Cuthbert Tunstall, who was told to stay near Henry to give advice. On 5 August, when the German delegates sent a letter to the King regarding three items that particularly worried them (compulsory clerical celibacy, the withholding of the chalice from the laity, and the maintenance of private masses for the dead), Tunstall was able to intervene for the King and to influence the decision. The result was a thorough dismissal by the King of many of the Germans&#x27; chief concerns. Although Cranmer begged the Germans to continue with the negotiations, using the argument &quot;to consider the many thousands of souls in England&quot; at stake, they left on 1 October without any substantial achievements.

==Reforms reversed (1539–1542)==
Continental reformer Philipp Melanchthon was aware that he was very much admired by Henry. In early 1539, Melanchthon wrote several letters to Henry criticising his views on religion, in particular his support of clerical celibacy. By late April another delegation from the Lutheran princes arrived to build on Melanchthon&#x27;s exhortations. Cromwell wrote a letter to the King in support of the new Lutheran mission. The King had begun to change his stance and concentrated on wooing conservative opinion in England rather than reaching out to the Lutherans. On 28 April 1539, Parliament met for the first time in three years. Cranmer was present, but Cromwell was unable to attend due to ill health. On 5 May the House of Lords created a committee with the customary religious balance between conservatives and reformers to examine and determine doctrine. The committee was given little time to do the detailed work needed for a thorough revision. On 16 May, the Duke of Norfolk noted that the committee had not agreed on anything, and proposed that the Lords examine six doctrinal questions—which eventually formed the basis of the &quot;Six Articles&quot;. They affirmed the conservative interpretation of doctrines such as the real presence, clerical celibacy, and the necessity of auricular confession, the private confession of sins to a priest. As the Act of the Six Articles neared passage in Parliament, Cranmer moved his wife and children out of England to safety. Up until this time, the family was kept quietly hidden, most likely in Ford Palace in Kent. The Act passed Parliament at the end of June and it forced Latimer and Nicholas Shaxton to resign their dioceses given their outspoken opposition to the measure.
The setback for the reformers was short-lived. By September, Henry was displeased with the results of the Act and its promulgators; the ever-loyal Cranmer and Cromwell were back in favour. The King asked his archbishop to write a new preface for the Great Bible, an English translation of the Bible that was first published in April 1539 under the direction of Cromwell. The preface was in the form of a sermon addressed to readers. As for Cromwell, he was delighted that his plan of a royal marriage between Henry and Anne of Cleves, the sister of a German prince was accepted by the King. In Cromwell&#x27;s view, the marriage could potentially bring back contacts with the Schmalkaldic League. Henry was dismayed with Anne when they first met on 1 January 1540 but married her reluctantly on 6 January in a ceremony officiated by Cranmer. The marriage ended in disaster as Henry decided that he would request a royal divorce. This resulted in Henry being placed in an embarrassing position and Cromwell suffered the consequences. His old enemies, including the Duke of Norfolk, took advantage of the weakened Cromwell and he was arrested on 10 June. He immediately lost the support of all his friends, including Cranmer. As Cranmer had done for Anne Boleyn, he wrote a letter to the King defending the past work of Cromwell. Henry&#x27;s marriage to Anne of Cleves was quickly annulled on 9 July by the vice-gerential synod, now led by Cranmer and Gardiner.

Following the annulment, Cromwell was executed on 28 July. Cranmer now found himself in a politically prominent position, with no one else to shoulder the burden. Throughout the rest of Henry&#x27;s reign, he clung to Henry&#x27;s authority. The King had total trust in him and in return, Cranmer could not conceal anything from the King. At the end of June 1541, Henry with his new wife, Catherine Howard, left for his first visit to the north of England. Cranmer was left in London as a member of a council taking care of matters for the King in his absence. His colleagues were Lord Chancellor Thomas Audley and Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford. This was Cranmer&#x27;s first major piece of responsibility outside the Church. In October, while the king and queen were away, a reformer named John Lascelles revealed to Cranmer that Catherine engaged in extramarital affairs. Cranmer gave the information to Audley and Seymour and they decided to wait until Henry&#x27;s return. Afraid of angering the King, Audley and Seymour suggested that Cranmer inform Henry. Cranmer slipped a message to Henry during mass on All Saints Day. An investigation revealed the truth of the marital indiscretions and Catherine was executed in February 1542.

==Support from the King (1543–1547)==
In 1543, several conservative clergymen in Kent banded together to attack and denounce two reformers, Richard Turner and John Bland, before the Privy Council. They prepared articles to present to the council, but at the last moment, additional denunciations were added by Stephen Gardiner&#x27;s nephew, Germain Gardiner. These new articles attacked Cranmer and listed his misdeeds back to 1541. This document and the following actions were the basis of the so-called Prebendaries&#x27; Plot. The articles were delivered to the Council in London and were probably read on 22 April 1543. The King most likely saw the articles against Cranmer that night. The Archbishop appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made. His commissioners in Lambeth dealt specifically with Turner&#x27;s case where he was acquitted, much to the fury of the conservatives.

While the plot against Cranmer proceeded, the reformers were attacked on other fronts. On 20 April, the Convocation reconvened to consider revising the Bishops&#x27; Book. Cranmer presided over the sub-committees, but the conservatives were able to overturn many reforming ideas, including justification by faith &quot;alone&quot;. On 5 May, the new revision called &quot;A Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for any Christian Man&quot; or the King&#x27;s Book was released. Doctrinally, it was far more conservative than the Bishops&#x27; Book. On 10 May, the reformers received another blow. Parliament passed the Act for the Advancement of True Religion, which abolished &quot;erroneous books&quot; and restricted the reading of the Bible in English to those of noble status. Reformers were examined, forced to recant, or imprisoned from May to August.

For five months, Henry took no action on the accusations against his archbishop. The conspiracy was finally revealed to Cranmer by the King himself. According to Cranmer&#x27;s secretary, Ralph Morice, sometime in September 1543, the King showed Cranmer a paper summarising the accusations against him. An investigation was to be mounted and Cranmer was appointed chief investigator. Surprise raids were carried out, evidence gathered, and ringleaders identified. Typically, Cranmer put the clergymen involved in the conspiracy through immediate humiliation, but he eventually forgave them and continued to use their services. To show his trust in Cranmer, Henry gave Cranmer his ring. When the Privy Council arrested Cranmer at the end of November, the nobles were hampered by the symbol of the King&#x27;s trust in him. Cranmer&#x27;s victory ended with two second-rank leaders imprisoned and Germain Gardiner executed.
With the atmosphere in Cranmer&#x27;s favour, he pursued quiet efforts to reform the Church, particularly the liturgy. On 27 May 1544, the first officially authorised vernacular service was published, the processional service of intercession known as the &quot;Exhortation and Litany&quot;. It survives today with minor modifications in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. The traditional litany uses invocations to saints, but Cranmer thoroughly reformed this aspect by providing no opportunity in the text for such veneration. Additional reformers were elected to the House of Commons, and new legislation was introduced to curb the effects of the Act of the Six Articles and the Act for the Advancement of True Religion.

In 1546, the conservatives in a coalition including Gardiner, the Duke of Norfolk, the Lord Chancellor Wriothesley, and the bishop of London, Edmund Bonner, made one last attempt to challenge the reformers. Several reformers with links to Cranmer were targeted. Some, such as Lascelles, were burned at the stake. Powerful reform-minded nobles Edward Seymour and John Dudley returned to England from overseas and turned the tide against the conservatives. Two incidents tipped the balance. Gardiner was disgraced before the King when he refused to agree to exchange episcopal estates, and the son of the Duke of Norfolk was charged with treason and executed. There is no evidence that Cranmer played any part in these political games, and there were no further plots as the King&#x27;s health ebbed in his final months. Cranmer performed his final duties for the King on 28 January 1547 when he gave a reformed statement of faith while gripping Henry&#x27;s hand instead of giving him his last rites. Cranmer mourned Henry&#x27;s death, and it was later said that he demonstrated his grief by growing a beard. The beard was also a sign of his break with the past. Continental reformers grew beards to mark their rejection of the old Church, and this significance of clerical beards was well understood in England. On 31 January, he was among the executors of the King&#x27;s final will that nominated Edward Seymour as Lord Protector and welcomed the boy king, Edward VI.

==Foreign divines and reformed doctrines (1547–1549)==

Under the regency of Seymour, the reformers became part of the establishment. A royal visitation of the provinces took place in August 1547, and each parish was instructed to obtain a copy of the &quot;Homilies&quot;. This book consisted of twelve homilies, four of which were written by Cranmer. His reassertion of the doctrine of justification by faith elicited a strong reaction from Gardiner. In the &quot;Homily of Good Works annexed to Faith,&quot; Cranmer attacked monasticism and the importance of various personal actions involved in liturgical recitations and ceremonies. Hence, he narrowed the range of good works considered necessary and reinforced the importance of faith. In each parish visited, injunctions were put in place that resolved to &quot;...eliminate any image which had any suspicion of devotion attached to it.&quot;

Cranmer&#x27;s eucharistic views, which had already moved away from official Catholic doctrine, received another push from Continental reformers. Cranmer had been in contact with Martin Bucer since initial contacts were made with the Schmalkaldic League. Cranmer and Bucer&#x27;s relationship became ever closer owing to Charles V&#x27;s victory over the League at Mühlberg, which left England as the sole major nation that gave sanctuary to persecuted reformers. Cranmer wrote a letter to Bucer (now lost) with questions on eucharistic theology. In Bucer&#x27;s reply dated 28 November 1547, he denied the human real presence and condemned transubstantiation and the adoration of the elements. The letter was delivered to Cranmer by two Italian reformed theologians, Peter Martyr and Bernardino Ochino, who were invited to take refuge in England. Martyr also brought with him an epistle written allegedly by John Chrysostom, &quot;Ad Caesarium Monachum&quot;, which appeared to provide patristic support against the corporeal real presence. These documents influenced Cranmer&#x27;s thoughts on the Eucharist.

In March 1549, Strasbourg forced Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius to leave. Cranmer immediately invited the men to England and promised they would be placed in English universities. When they arrived on 25 April, Cranmer was delighted to meet Bucer face to face after eighteen years of correspondence. He needed these scholarly men to train a new generation of preachers as well as to assist in the reform of liturgy and doctrine. Others who accepted his invitations included the Polish reformer, Jan Łaski, but Cranmer could not convince Osiander and Melanchthon that they should come to England.

==&quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; (1548–1549)==

As the use of English in worship services spread, the need for a complete uniform liturgy for the Church became evident. Initial meetings to start what would eventually become the 1549 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; were held in the former Chertsey Abbey and in Windsor Castle in September 1548. The list of participants can be only partially reconstructed, but it is known that the members were balanced between conservatives and reformers. These meetings were followed by a debate on the Eucharist in the House of Lords which took place between 14 and 19 December. Cranmer publicly revealed in this debate that he had abandoned the doctrine of the corporeal real presence and believed that the Eucharistic presence was only spiritual. Parliament backed the publication of the prayer book after Christmas by passing the Act of Uniformity 1549; it then legalised clerical marriage.

It is difficult to ascertain how much of the prayer book is Cranmer&#x27;s personal composition. Generations of liturgical scholars have been able to track down the sources that he used, including the Sarum Rite, writings from Hermann of Wied, and several Lutheran sources including Osiander and Justus Jonas. It is more problematic to determine how Cranmer worked on the book and with whom he worked. Where information about his possible helpers is lacking, he is given the credit for the editorship and the overall structure of the book.

The use of the new prayer book was made compulsory on 9 June 1549. This triggered a series of protests in Devon and Cornwall where the English language was not yet in common usage, now known as the Prayer Book Rebellion. By early July, the uprising had spread to other parts in the east of England. The rebels made a number of demands including the restoration of the Six Articles, the use of Latin for the mass with only the consecrated bread given to the laity, the restoration of prayers for souls in purgatory, and the rebuilding of abbeys. Cranmer wrote a strong response to these demands to the King in which he denounced the wickedness of the rebellion. On 21 July, Cranmer commandeered St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral where he vigorously defended the official Church line. A draft of his sermon, the only extant written sample of his preaching from his entire career, shows that he collaborated with Peter Martyr on dealing with the rebellion.

==Consolidating gains (1549–1551)==
The Prayer Book Rebellion and other events harmed the Seymour regency. The Privy Council became divided when several dissident Councillors joined behind John Dudley to oust Seymour. Cranmer and two other Councillors, William Paget, and Thomas Smith initially rallied behind Seymour. After a flurry of letters passed between the two sides, a bloodless &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; ended Seymour&#x27;s Protectorship on 13 October 1549. Despite the support of religiously conservative politicians behind Dudley&#x27;s coup, the reformers managed to maintain control of the new government, and the English Reformation continued to consolidate gains. Seymour was initially imprisoned in the Tower but was shortly released on 6 February 1550 and returned to the council. The Archbishop was able to transfer his former chaplain, Nicholas Ridley, from the minor see of Rochester to the diocese of London. At the same time, John Ponet took Ridley&#x27;s former position. Incumbent conservatives were uprooted and replaced with reformers.
The first result of cooperation and consultation between Cranmer and Bucer was the first Edwardine Ordinal, the liturgy for the ordination of priests. This was missing in the first prayer book and was not published until 1550. Cranmer adopted Bucer&#x27;s draft and created three services for commissioning: a deacon, a priest, and a bishop. In the same year, Cranmer produced the &quot;Defence of the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ&quot;, a semi-official explanation of the eucharistic theology within the prayer book. It was the first full-length book with Cranmer&#x27;s name on the title page. The preface summarises his quarrel with Rome in a well-known passage where he compared &quot;beads, pardons, pilgrimages, and such other like popery&quot; with weeds. Still, the roots of the weeds were transubstantiation, the corporeal real presence, and the sacrificial nature of the mass.

Although Bucer assisted in the development of the English Reformation, he was still quite concerned about the speed of its progress. Both Bucer and Fagius had noticed that the 1549 prayer book was not a remarkable step forward. However, Cranmer assured Bucer that it was only a first step and that its initial form was temporary. By late 1550, Bucer was becoming disillusioned. Cranmer ensured he did not feel alienated and kept in close touch with him. This attention paid off during the vestments controversy. This incident was initiated by John Hooper, a follower of Heinrich Bullinger who had recently returned from Zürich. Hooper was unhappy with Cranmer&#x27;s prayer book and ordinal and particularly objected to using ceremonies and vestments. When the Privy Council selected him to be the Bishop of Gloucester on 15 May 1550, he laid down conditions for not wearing the required vestments. He found an ally among the Continental reformers in Jan Łaski, who had become a leader of the Stranger church in London, a designated place of worship for Continental Protestant refugees. His church&#x27;s forms and practices had taken reforms much further than Cranmer would have liked. Bucer and Peter Martyr, while they sympathised with Hooper&#x27;s position, supported Cranmer&#x27;s arguments of timing and authority. Cranmer and Ridley stood their ground. This led to Hooper&#x27;s imprisonment, and he eventually gave in. He was consecrated on 8 March 1551 according to the ordinal and preached before the King in his episcopal garments. Cranmer&#x27;s vision of reform was maintained through careful steps under the government&#x27;s authority.

==Final reform programme (1551–1553)==

Cranmer&#x27;s role in politics was diminishing when, on 16 October 1551, Seymour was arrested on charges of treason. In December, Seymour was put on trial, and although acquitted of treason, he was judged guilty of felony and was put to death on 22 January 1552. This began the breach between Cranmer and Dudley. It was aggravated during the year by the regency&#x27;s gradual appropriation of ecclesiastical property. Throughout this political turmoil, Cranmer worked simultaneously on three major projects in his reform programme: the revision of canon law, the revision of the prayer book, and the formation of a statement of doctrine.
The original Catholic canon law that defined governance within the Church needed revision following Henry&#x27;s break with Rome. Several revision attempts were made throughout Henry&#x27;s reign, but these initial projects were shelved as the speed of reform outpaced the time required to revise. As the reformation stabilised, Cranmer formed a committee in December 1551 to restart the work. He recruited Peter Martyr to the committee and he also asked Łaski and Hooper to participate, showing his habitual ability to forgive past actions. Cranmer and Martyr realised that a successful enactment of a reformed ecclesiastical law code in England would have international significance. Cranmer planned to draw together all the reformed churches of Europe under England&#x27;s leadership to counter the Council of Trent, the Catholic Church&#x27;s response to the Protestant Reformation. In March 1552, Cranmer invited the foremost Continental reformers, Bullinger, John Calvin, and Melanchthon, to come to England and to participate in an ecumenical council. The response was disappointing: Melanchthon did not respond, Bullinger stated that neither of them could leave Germany as it was riven by war between the Emperor and the Lutheran princes, and while Calvin showed some enthusiasm, he said he was unable to come. Cranmer acknowledged Calvin and replied, &quot;Meanwhile, we will reform the English Church to the utmost of our ability and give our labour that both its doctrines and laws will be improved after the model of holy scripture.&quot; One partial manuscript of the project survived that was annotated with corrections and comments by Cranmer and Martyr. When the final version was presented to Parliament, the breach between Cranmer and Dudley was complete and the regent effectively killed the canon law bill in the House of Lords.

As with the first prayer book, the origins and participants in its revision are obscure, but it was clear that Cranmer led the project and steered its development. It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter. Late in 1550, the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved, and they influenced the revision significantly. The view of the spiritual presence was clarified by the use of entirely different words at the offering of the bread and the wine to the communicants. New rubrics noted that any bread could be used, and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the curate, thus dissociating the elements from any physical presence. The new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead because such prayers implied support for the doctrine of purgatory. The Act of Uniformity 1552, which authorised the book&#x27;s use, specified that it be exclusively used from 1 November. The final version was officially published at almost the last minute, owing to Dudley&#x27;s intervention. While travelling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer John Knox, who was based in Newcastle. Impressed by his preaching, Dudley selected him as a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects. In a sermon before the King, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion. On 27 September 1552, the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new prayer book and told Cranmer to revise it. He responded with a long letter arguing that it was for Parliament, with the royal assent, to decide any changes in the liturgy. On 22 October, the council decided to keep the liturgy as it was and to add the so-called &quot;Black Rubric&quot;, which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion.

The origins of the statement which eventually became the &quot;Forty-two Articles&quot; are equally obscure. As early as December 1549, the Archbishop demanded that his bishops subscribe to certain doctrinal articles. In 1551, Cranmer presented a version of a statement to the bishops, but its status remained ambiguous. Cranmer did not devote much effort to developing the articles, most likely owing to work on the canon law revision. He became more interested once the hope for an ecumenical council faded. By September 1552, draft versions of the articles were being worked on by Cranmer and John Cheke, his scholarly friend, commissioned to translate them into Latin. When the &quot;Forty-two Articles&quot; were finally published in May 1553, the title page declared that the Convocation agreed upon the articles, which were published by the king&#x27;s authority. This was not the case and the mistake was likely caused by miscommunications between the Archbishop and the Privy Council. Cranmer complained about this to the council, but the authorities noted that the articles were developed during the Convocation (hence evading giving a direct answer). The council gave Cranmer the unhappy task of requiring the bishops to subscribe to the articles, many of whom opposed them and pointed out the anomaly of the title page. While Cranmer was carrying out this duty, events unfolded that rendered the subscriptions futile.

==Trials, recantations, execution (1553–1556)==

Edward VI became seriously ill and the councillors were told that he did not have long to live. In May 1553, the council sent several letters to Continental reformers assuring them that Edward&#x27;s health was improving. Among the letters was one addressed to Melanchthon inviting him to come to England to take up the Regius Chair in Cambridge which had been vacant since the death of Martin Bucer in February 1551. Both Henry VIII and Cranmer had previously failed to convince Melanchthon to come; this time, the council made a serious effort by sending him an advance to cover his travel expenses. Cranmer sent a personal letter urging him to take the offer. Despite his plea, Melanchthon never made the voyage to England. While this effort to shore up the reformation was taking place, the council was working to persuade several judges to put on the throne Lady Jane Grey, Edward&#x27;s cousin and a Protestant, instead of Mary, Henry and Catherine of Aragon&#x27;s daughter and a Catholic. On 17 June 1553, the King made his will, noting Jane would succeed him, contravening the Third Succession Act. Cranmer tried to speak to Edward alone, but he was refused and his audience with Edward occurred in the presence of the councillors. Edward told him that he supported what he had written in his will. Cranmer&#x27;s decision to support Jane must have occurred before 19 June, when royal orders were sent to convene the Convocation for the recognition of the new succession.

By mid-July, there were serious provincial revolts in Mary&#x27;s favour and support for Jane in the council fell. As Mary was proclaimed queen, Dudley, Ridley, Cheke, and Jane&#x27;s father, the Duke of Suffolk, were imprisoned. No action was taken against the Archbishop. On 8 August, he led Edward&#x27;s funeral according to the rites of the prayer book. During these months, he advised others, including Peter Martyr, to flee England, but he himself chose to stay. Reformed bishops were removed from office and conservative clergy, such as Edmund Bonner, had their old positions restored. Cranmer did not go down without a fight. When rumours spread that he authorised the use of the mass in Canterbury Cathedral, he declared them to be false and said, &quot;All the doctrine and religion by our said sovereign lord king Edward VI is more pure and according to God&#x27;s word than any that hath been used in England these thousand years.&quot; Not surprisingly, the government regarded Cranmer&#x27;s declaration as tantamount to sedition. He was ordered to stand before the council in the Star Chamber on 14 September and on that day he said his final goodbye to Martyr. Cranmer was sent straight to the Tower to join Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley.

On 13 November 1553, Cranmer and four others were brought to trial for high treason, found guilty, attainted by legislation passed by parliament (and so stripped of his see and right to make a will), and condemned to death. Numerous witnesses testified that Cranmer had encouraged heresy and had written heretical works, and he was charged with heresy. Through February 1554, Jane Grey and other rebels were executed, and attention then turned to the religious leaders of the reformation. On 8 March 1554, the Privy Council ordered Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer to be transferred to Bocardo prison in Oxford to await a second trial for heresy. During this time, Cranmer was able to smuggle out a letter to Martyr, who had fled to Strasbourg, the last surviving document written in his own hand. He stated that the desperate situation of the church was proof that it would eventually be delivered and wrote, &quot;I pray that God may grant that we may endure to the end!&quot; Cranmer remained isolated in Bocardo prison for seventeen months before the heresy trial started on 12 September 1555. Although it took place in England, the trial was under papal jurisdiction and the final verdict would come from Rome. Under interrogation, Cranmer admitted to every fact that was placed before him, but he denied any treachery, disobedience, or heresy. The trial of Latimer and Ridley started shortly after Cranmer&#x27;s but their verdicts came almost immediately and they were burned at the stake on 16 October. Cranmer was taken to a tower to watch the proceedings. On 4 December, Rome decided Cranmer&#x27;s fate by depriving him of the archbishopric and giving permission to the secular authorities to carry out their sentence.
In his final days, Cranmer&#x27;s circumstances changed, which led to several recantations. On 11 December, he was taken out of Bocardo and placed in the house of the Dean of Christ Church. This new environment was very different from that of his two years in prison. He was in an academic community and treated as a guest. Approached by a Dominican friar, Juan de Villagarcía, he debated the issues of papal supremacy and purgatory. In his first four recantations, produced between the end of January and mid-February, Cranmer submitted himself to the authority of the king and queen and recognised the Pope as head of the Church. On 14 February 1556, he was degraded from holy orders and returned to Bocardo. He had conceded very little and Edmund Bonner was not satisfied with these admissions. 

On 24 February, a writ was issued to the mayor of Oxford and the date of Cranmer&#x27;s execution was set for 7 March. Two days after the writ was issued, a fifth statement, the first which could be called a true recantation, was issued. Cranmer repudiated all Lutheran and Zwinglian theology, fully accepted Catholic theology, including papal supremacy and transubstantiation, and stated that there was no salvation outside the Catholic Church. He announced his joy at returning to the Catholic faith, asked for and received sacramental absolution, and participated in the mass. Cranmer&#x27;s burning was postponed and, under the normal practice of canon law, he should have been absolved. Mary, however, decided that no further postponement was possible. His last recantation was issued on 18 March. It was a sign of a broken man, a sweeping confession of sin. Despite the stipulation in canon law that recanting heretics be reprieved, Mary was determined to make an example of Cranmer, an ambassador summarizing her position to her thus: Cranmer&#x27;s &quot;iniquity and obstinacy was so great against God and your Grace that your clemency and mercy could have no place with him, but you were constrained to administer justice&quot;; so she pressed ahead with his execution required by his attainder by parliament for high treason.
Cranmer was told that he would be able to make a final recantation, but that this time it was to be in public during a service at the University Church in Oxford. He wrote and submitted the speech in advance and it was published after his death. At the pulpit on the day of his execution, 21 March 1556, he opened with a prayer and an exhortation to obey the King and Queen, but he ended his sermon totally unexpectedly, deviating from the prepared script. He renounced the recantations that he had written or signed with his own hand since his degradation and he stated that, in consequence, his hand would be punished by being burnt first. He then said, &quot;And as for the Pope, I refuse him, as Christ&#x27;s enemy, and Antichrist with all his false doctrine.&quot; He was pulled from the pulpit and taken to where Latimer and Ridley had been burnt six months previously. As the flames drew around him, he fulfilled his promise by placing his right hand into the heart of the fire, calling it &quot;that unworthy hand&quot;. His dying words were, &quot;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. I see the heavens open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.&quot;

==Aftermath and legacy==
The Marian government produced a pamphlet with all six recantations plus the text of the speech Cranmer was to have made in the University Church. His subsequent withdrawal of his recantations was not mentioned, though what actually happened soon became common knowledge, undermining the effectiveness of Marian propaganda. Similarly, the Protestant party had difficulty in making use of the event, given Cranmer&#x27;s recantations. The exiles&#x27; propaganda concentrated on publishing various specimens of his writings. Eventually John Foxe put Cranmer&#x27;s story to effective use in 1559, and it featured prominently in his &quot;Acts and Monuments&quot; when it was first printed in 1563.
Cranmer&#x27;s family had been exiled to the Continent in 1539. It is not known exactly when they returned to England, but it was soon after the accession of Edward VI in 1547 that Cranmer publicly acknowledged their existence. Not much is known about the early years of the children. His daughter, Margaret, was likely born in the 1530s and his son, Thomas, came later, probably during the reign of Edward. Around the time of Mary&#x27;s accession, Cranmer&#x27;s wife, Margarete, escaped to Germany, while his son was entrusted to his brother, Edmund Cranmer, who took him to the Continent. Margarete Cranmer eventually married Cranmer&#x27;s favourite publisher, Edward Whitchurch. The couple returned to England after Mary&#x27;s reign and settled in Surrey. Whitchurch also negotiated for the marriage of Margaret to Thomas Norton. Whitchurch died in 1562 and Margarete married for the third time to Bartholomew Scott. She died in the 1570s. Both of Cranmer&#x27;s children died without issue and his line became extinct.

When Elizabeth I came to power in 1558 she restored the Church of England&#x27;s independence from Rome under the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. The church that she re-established represented, in effect, a snapshot of the Edwardine Church from September 1552. Thus the Elizabethan prayer book was basically Cranmer&#x27;s 1552 edition but without the &quot;Black Rubric&quot;. In the Convocation of 1563 the &quot;Forty-two Articles&quot; which were never adopted by the Church were altered in the area of eucharistic doctrine to form the &quot;Thirty-nine Articles&quot;. Most of the exiles returned to England and resumed their careers in the Church. To some like Edmund Grindal, an archbishop of Canterbury during Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, Cranmer provided a shining example whose work should be upheld and extended.

Cranmer&#x27;s greatest concerns were the maintenance of the royal supremacy and the diffusion of reformed theology and practice. Scholars note that he is best remembered for his contribution to the realms of language and of cultural identity. His prose helped to guide the development of the English language, and the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; is a major contribution to English literature that influenced many lives in the Anglophone world. It has guided Anglican worship for four hundred years.

Catholic biographers sometimes depict Cranmer as an unprincipled opportunist, a Nicodemite, and a tool of royal tyranny. For their part, some Protestant biographers appear to overlook the ways or occasions in which Cranmer betrayed his own principles. Both sides can agree in seeing Cranmer as a committed scholar whose life showed the strengths and weaknesses of a very human and often under-appreciated reformer.

The Church of England commemorates Thomas Cranmer as a Reformation Martyr on 21 March, the anniversary of his death, and he is remembered in the calendar of saints of the Church of England with a lesser festival. The supposed site of the burnings is marked by a paving cross in Broad Street, Oxford, where an annual remembrance is held by the Prayer Book Society.

The U.S. Episcopal Church liturgical calendar honours him (together with Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley) with a &quot;day of optional observance&quot; on 16 October.

<doc id="30503" wikidata="Q34178" url="?curid=30503" title="Theology">
<text>Theology is the study of religious belief from a religious perspective, with a focus on the nature of divinity. It is taught as an academic discipline, typically in universities and seminaries. It occupies itself with the unique content of analyzing the supernatural, but also deals with religious epistemology, asks and seeks to answer the question of revelation. Revelation pertains to the acceptance of God, gods, or deities, as not only transcendent or above the natural world, but also willing and able to interact with the natural world and to reveal themselves to humankind.

Theologians use various forms of analysis and argument (experiential, philosophical, ethnographic, historical, and others) to help understand, explain, test, critique, defend or promote any myriad of religious topics. As in philosophy of ethics and case law, arguments often assume the existence of previously resolved questions, and develop by making analogies from them to draw new inferences in new situations.

The study of theology may help a theologian more deeply understand their own religious tradition, another religious tradition, or it may enable them to explore the nature of divinity without reference to any specific tradition. Theology may be used to propagate, reform, or justify a religious tradition; or it may be used to compare, challenge (e.g. biblical criticism), or oppose (e.g. irreligion) a religious tradition or worldview. Theology might also help a theologian address some present situation or need through a religious tradition, or to explore possible ways of interpreting the world.

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;theology&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;theologia&quot; (θεολογία), a combination of &quot;theos&quot; (Θεός, &#x27;god&#x27;) and &quot;logia&quot; (λογία, &#x27;utterances, sayings, oracles&#x27;)—the latter word relating to Greek &quot;logos&quot; (λόγος, &#x27;word, discourse, account, reasoning&#x27;). The term would pass on to Latin as , then French as , eventually becoming the English &quot;theology&quot;.

Through several variants (e.g., &quot;theologie&quot;, &quot;teologye&quot;), the English &quot;theology&quot; had evolved into its current form by 1362. The sense that the word has in English depends in large part on the sense that the Latin and Greek equivalents had acquired in patristic and medieval Christian usage although the English term has now spread beyond Christian contexts.

=== Classical philosophy ===
Greek &quot;theologia&quot; (θεολογία) was used with the meaning &#x27;discourse on God&#x27; around 380 BC by Plato in &quot;The Republic&quot;. Aristotle divided theoretical philosophy into &quot;mathematike&quot;, &quot;physike&quot;, and &quot;theologike&quot;, with the latter corresponding roughly to metaphysics, which, for Aristotle, included discourse on the nature of the divine.

Drawing on Greek Stoic sources, the Latin writer Varro distinguished three forms of such discourse:

# mythical, concerning the myths of the Greek gods;
# rational, philosophical analysis of the gods and of cosmology; and
# civil, concerning the rites and duties of public religious observance.

=== Later usage ===
Some Latin Christian authors, such as Tertullian and Augustine, followed Varro&#x27;s threefold usage. However, Augustine also defined &quot;theologia&quot; as &quot;reasoning or discussion concerning the Deity&quot;.

The Latin author Boethius, writing in the early 6th century, used &quot;theologia&quot; to denote a subdivision of philosophy as a subject of academic study, dealing with the motionless, incorporeal reality; as opposed to &quot;physica&quot;, which deals with corporeal, moving realities. Boethius&#x27; definition influenced medieval Latin usage.what is the purpose of life

In patristic Greek Christian sources, &quot;theologia&quot; could refer narrowly to devout and/or inspired knowledge of and teaching about the essential nature of God.

In scholastic Latin sources, the term came to denote the rational study of the doctrines of the Christian religion, or (more precisely) the academic discipline that investigated the coherence and implications of the language and claims of the Bible and of the theological tradition (the latter often as represented in Peter Lombard&#x27;s &quot;Sentences&quot;, a book of extracts from the Church Fathers).

In the Renaissance, especially with Florentine Platonist apologists of Dante&#x27;s poetics, the distinction between &#x27;poetic theology&#x27; (&quot;theologia poetica&quot;) and &#x27;revealed&#x27; or Biblical theology serves as stepping stone for a revival of philosophy as independent of theological authority.

It is in the last sense, theology as an academic discipline involving rational study of Christian teaching, that the term passed into English in the 14th century, although it could also be used in the narrower sense found in Boethius and the Greek patristic authors, to mean rational study of the essential nature of God, a discourse now sometimes called theology proper.

From the 17th century onwards, the term &quot;theology&quot; began to be used to refer to the study of religious ideas and teachings that are not specifically Christian or correlated with Christianity (e.g., in the term &quot;natural theology&quot;, which denoted theology based on reasoning from natural facts independent of specifically Christian revelation) or that are specific to another religion (such as below).

&quot;Theology&quot; can also be used in a derived sense to mean &quot;a system of theoretical principles; an (impractical or rigid) ideology&quot;.

==In religion==
The term &quot;theology&quot; has been deemed by some as only appropriate to the study of religions that worship a supposed deity (a &quot;theos&quot;), i.e. more widely than monotheism; and presuppose a belief in the ability to speak and reason about this deity (in &quot;logia&quot;). They suggest the term is less appropriate in religious contexts that are organized differently (i.e., religions without a single deity, or that deny that such subjects can be studied logically). &quot;Hierology&quot; has been proposed, by such people as Eugène Goblet d&#x27;Alviella (1908), as an alternative, more generic term.

=== Abrahamic religions ===

====Christianity====

As defined by Thomas Aquinas, theology is constituted by a triple aspect: what is taught by God, teaches of God, and leads to God (). This indicates the three distinct areas of God as theophanic revelation, the systematic study of the nature of divine and, more generally, of religious belief, and the spiritual path. Christian theology as the study of Christian belief and practice concentrates primarily upon the texts of the Old Testament and the New Testament as well as on Christian tradition. Christian theologians use biblical exegesis, rational analysis and argument. Theology might be undertaken to help the theologian better understand Christian tenets, to make comparisons between Christianity and other traditions, to defend Christianity against objections and criticism, to facilitate reforms in the Christian church, to assist in the propagation of Christianity, to draw on the resources of the Christian tradition to address some present situation or need, or for a variety of other reasons.

====Islam====

Islamic theological discussion that parallels Christian theological discussion is called &quot;Kalam&quot;; the Islamic analogue of Christian theological discussion would more properly be the investigation and elaboration of &quot;Sharia&quot; or &quot;Fiqh&quot;.

Some Universities in Germany established departments of islamic theology. (i.e.)

====Judaism====
In Jewish theology, the historical absence of political authority has meant that most theological reflection has happened within the context of the Jewish community and synagogue, including through rabbinical discussion of Jewish law and Midrash (rabbinic biblical commentaries). Jewish theology is also linked to ethics, as it is the case with theology in other religions, and therefore has implications for how one behaves.

===Indian religions===

====Buddhism====

Some academic inquiries within Buddhism, dedicated to the investigation of a Buddhist understanding of the world, prefer the designation Buddhist philosophy to the term &quot;Buddhist theology&quot;, since Buddhism lacks the same conception of a &quot;theos&quot; or a Creator God. Jose Ignacio Cabezon, who argues that the use of &quot;theology&quot; is in fact appropriate, can only do so, he says, because &quot;I take theology not to be restricted to discourse on God... I take &#x27;theology&#x27; not to be restricted to its etymological meaning. In that latter sense, Buddhism is of course atheological, rejecting as it does the notion of God.&quot; 

Whatever the case, there are various Buddhist theories and discussions on the nature of Buddhahood and the ultimate reality / highest form of divinity, which has been termed &quot;buddhology&quot; by some scholars like Louis de La Vallée-Poussin. This is a different usage of the term than when it is taken to mean the academic study of Buddhism, and here would refer to the study of the nature of what a Buddha is. In Mahayana Buddhism, a central concept in its buddhology is the doctrine of the three Buddha bodies (Sanskrit: Trikāya). This doctrine is shared by all Mahayana Buddhist traditions. 

====Hinduism====

Within Hindu philosophy, there are numerous traditions of philosophical speculation on the nature of the universe, of God (termed Brahman, Paramatma, Ishvara, and/or Bhagavan in some schools of Hindu thought) and of the &quot;ātman&quot; (soul). The Sanskrit word for the various schools of Hindu philosophy is &quot;darśana&quot; (&#x27;view, viewpoint&#x27;), the most influential one in terms of modern Hindu religion is Vedanta and its various sub-schools, each of which presents a different theory of Ishvara (the Supreme lord, God).

Vaishnava theology has been a subject of study for many devotees, philosophers and scholars in India for centuries. A large part of its study lies in classifying and organizing the manifestations of thousands of gods and their aspects. In recent decades the study of Hinduism has also been taken up by a number of academic institutions in Europe, such as the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies and Bhaktivedanta College. 

There are also other traditions of Hindu theology, including the various theologies of Shaivism (which include dualistic and non-dualistic strands) as well as the theologies of the Goddess centered Shakta traditions which posit a feminine deity as the ultimate.

===Other religions===
====Shinto====
In Japan, the term &quot;theology&quot; () has been ascribed to Shinto since the Edo period with the publication of Mano Tokitsuna&#x27;s (). In modern times, other terms are used to denote studies in Shinto—as well as Buddhist—belief, such as () and ().

====Modern Paganism====
English academic Graham Harvey has commented that Pagans &quot;rarely indulge in theology&quot;. Nevertheless, theology has been applied in some sectors across contemporary Pagan communities, including Wicca, Heathenry, Druidry and Kemetism. As these religions have given precedence to orthopraxy, theological views often vary among adherents. The term is used by Christine Kraemer in her book &quot;Seeking The Mystery: An Introduction to Pagan Theologies&quot; and by Michael York in &quot;Pagan Theology: Paganism as a World Religion&quot;.

==Topics==
Richard Hooker defines &quot;theology&quot; as &quot;the science of things divine&quot;. The term can, however, be used for a variety of disciplines or fields of study. Theology considers whether the divine exists in some form, such as in physical, supernatural, mental, or social realities, and what evidence for and about it may be found via personal spiritual experiences or historical records of such experiences as documented by others. The study of these assumptions is not part of theology proper, but is found in the philosophy of religion, and increasingly through the psychology of religion and neurotheology. Theology&#x27;s aim, then, is to record, structure and understand these experiences and concepts; and to use them to derive normative prescriptions for how to live our lives.

==History of academic discipline==
The history of the study of theology in institutions of higher education is as old as the history of such institutions themselves. For instance:
* Taxila was an early centre of Vedic learning, possible from the 6th-century BC or earlier;
* the Platonic Academy founded in Athens in the 4th-century BC seems to have included theological themes in its subject matter;
* the Chinese Taixue delivered Confucian teaching from the 2nd century BC;
* the School of Nisibis was a centre of Christian learning from the 4th century AD;
* Nalanda in India was a site of Buddhist higher learning from at least the 5th or 6th century AD; and
* the Moroccan University of Al-Karaouine was a centre of Islamic learning from the 10th century, as was Al-Azhar University in Cairo.

The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as &quot;studia generalia&quot; and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception. Later they were also founded by kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or by municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt).

In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries. Christian theological learning was, therefore, a component in these institutions, as was the study of church or canon law: universities played an important role in training people for ecclesiastical offices, in helping the church pursue the clarification and defence of its teaching, and in supporting the legal rights of the church over against secular rulers. At such universities, theological study was initially closely tied to the life of faith and of the church: it fed, and was fed by, practices of preaching, prayer and celebration of the Mass.

During the High Middle Ages, theology was the ultimate subject at universities, being named &quot;The Queen of the Sciences&quot;. It served as the capstone to the Trivium and Quadrivium that young men were expected to study. This meant that the other subjects (including philosophy) existed primarily to help with theological thought.
In this context, medieval theology in the Christian West could subsume fields of study which would later become more self-sufficient, such as metaphysics (Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;first philosophy&quot;,
or ontology (the science of being).

Christian theology&#x27;s preeminent place in the university started to come under challenge during the European Enlightenment, especially in Germany. Other subjects gained in independence and prestige, and questions were raised about the place of a discipline that seemed to involve a commitment to the authority of particular religious traditions in institutions that were increasingly understood to be devoted to independent reason.

Since the early 19th century, various different approaches have emerged in the West to theology as an academic discipline. Much of the debate concerning theology&#x27;s place in the university or within a general higher education curriculum centres on whether theology&#x27;s methods are appropriately theoretical and (broadly speaking) scientific or, on the other hand, whether theology requires a pre-commitment of faith by its practitioners, and whether such a commitment conflicts with academic freedom.

===Ministerial training===
In some contexts, theology has been held to belong in institutions of higher education primarily as a form of professional training for Christian ministry. This was the basis on which Friedrich Schleiermacher, a liberal theologian, argued for the inclusion of theology in the new University of Berlin in 1810.

For instance, in Germany, theological faculties at state universities are typically tied to particular denominations, Protestant or Roman Catholic, and those faculties will offer denominationally-bound &quot;(konfessionsgebunden)&quot; degrees, and have denominationally bound public posts amongst their faculty; as well as contributing &quot;to the development and growth of Christian knowledge&quot; they &quot;provide the academic training for the future clergy and teachers of religious instruction at German schools.&quot;

In the United States, several prominent colleges and universities were started in order to train Christian ministers. Harvard, Georgetown, Boston University, Yale, Duke University, and Princeton all had the theological training of clergy as a primary purpose at their foundation.

Seminaries and bible colleges have continued this alliance between the academic study of theology and training for Christian ministry. There are, for instance, numerous prominent examples in the United States, including Phoenix Seminary, Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, The Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, Criswell College in Dallas, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois, Dallas Theological Seminary, North Texas Collegiate Institute in Farmers Branch, Texas, and the Assemblies of God Theological Seminary in Springfield, Missouri. The only Judeo-Christian seminary for theology is the &#x27;Idaho Messianic Bible Seminary&#x27; which is part of the Jewish University of Colorado in Denver.

===As an academic discipline in its own right===
In some contexts, scholars pursue theology as an academic discipline without formal affiliation to any particular church (though members of staff may well have affiliations to churches), and without focussing on ministerial training. This applies, for instance, to the Department of Theological Studies at Concordia University in Canada, and to many university departments in the United Kingdom, including the Faculty of Divinity at the University of Cambridge, the Department of Theology and Religion at the University of Exeter, and the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at the University of Leeds. Traditional academic prizes, such as the University of Aberdeen&#x27;s Lumsden and Sachs Fellowship, tend to acknowledge performance in theology (or divinity as it is known at Aberdeen) and in religious studies.

===Religious studies===
In some contemporary contexts, a distinction is made between theology, which is seen as involving some level of commitment to the claims of the religious tradition being studied, and religious studies, which by contrast is normally seen as requiring that the question of the truth or falsehood of the religious traditions studied be kept outside its field. Religious studies involves the study of historical or contemporary practices or of those traditions&#x27; ideas using intellectual tools and frameworks that are not themselves specifically tied to any religious tradition and that are normally understood to be neutral or secular. In contexts where &#x27;religious studies&#x27; in this sense is the focus, the primary forms of study are likely to include:
* Anthropology of religion
* Comparative religion
* History of religions
* Philosophy of religion
* Psychology of religion
* Sociology of religion
Sometimes, theology and religious studies are seen as being in tension, and at other times, they are held to coexist without serious tension.
Occasionally it is denied that there is as clear a boundary between them.

== Criticism ==
===Pre-20th century===
Whether or not reasoned discussion about the divine is possible has long been a point of contention. Protagoras, as early as the fifth century BC, who is reputed to have been exiled from Athens because of his agnosticism about the existence of the gods, said that &quot;Concerning the gods I cannot know either that they exist or that they do not exist, or what form they might have, for there is much to prevent one&#x27;s knowing: the &quot;obscurity of the subject&quot; and the shortness of man&#x27;s life.&quot;
Since at least the eighteenth century, various authors have criticized the suitability of theology as an academic discipline. In 1772, Baron d&#x27;Holbach labeled theology &quot;a continual insult to human reason&quot; in &quot;Le Bon sens&quot;. Lord Bolingbroke, an English politician and political philosopher, wrote in Section IV of his &quot;Essays on Human Knowledge&quot;, &quot;Theology is in fault not religion. Theology is a science that may justly be compared to the Box of Pandora. Many good things lie uppermost in it; but many evil lie under them, and scatter plagues and desolation throughout the world.&quot;

Thomas Paine, a Deistic American political theorist and pamphleteer, wrote in his three-part work &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; (1794, 1795, 1807):The study of theology, as it stands in Christian churches, is the study of nothing; it is founded on nothing; it rests on no principles; it proceeds by no authorities; it has no data; it can demonstrate nothing; and it admits of no conclusion. Not anything can be studied as a science, without our being in possession of the principles upon which it is founded; and as this is the case with Christian theology, it is therefore the study of nothing.The German atheist philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach sought to dissolve theology in his work &quot;Principles of the Philosophy of the Future&quot;: &quot;The task of the modern era was the realization and humanization of God – the transformation and dissolution of theology into anthropology.&quot; This mirrored his earlier work &quot;The Essence of Christianity&quot; (1841), for which he was banned from teaching in Germany, in which he had said that theology was a &quot;web of contradictions and delusions&quot;.

The American satirist Mark Twain remarked in his essay &quot;The Lowest Animal&quot;, originally written in around 1896, but not published until after Twain&#x27;s death in 1910, that:[Man] is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat if his theology isn&#x27;t straight. He has made a graveyard of the globe in trying his honest best to smooth his brother&#x27;s path to happiness and heaven... The higher animals have no religion. And we are told that they are going to be left out in the Hereafter. I wonder why? It seems questionable taste.

===20th and 21st centuries===
A. J. Ayer, a British former logical-positivist, sought to show in his essay &quot;Critique of Ethics and Theology&quot; that all statements about the divine are nonsensical and any divine-attribute is unprovable. He wrote: &quot;It is now generally admitted, at any rate by philosophers, that the existence of a being having the attributes which define the god of any non-animistic religion cannot be demonstratively proved... [A]ll utterances about the nature of God are nonsensical.&quot;

Jewish atheist philosopher Walter Kaufmann, in his essay &quot;Against Theology&quot;, sought to differentiate theology from religion in general:Theology, of course, is not religion; and a great deal of religion is emphatically anti-theological... An attack on theology, therefore, should not be taken as necessarily involving an attack on religion. Religion can be, and often has been, untheological or even anti-theological. However, Kaufmann found that &quot;Christianity is inescapably a theological religion.&quot;

English atheist Charles Bradlaugh believed theology prevented human beings from achieving liberty, although he also noted that many theologians of his time held that, because modern scientific research sometimes contradicts sacred scriptures, the scriptures must therefore be wrong. Robert G. Ingersoll, an American agnostic lawyer, stated that, when theologians had power, the majority of people lived in hovels, while a privileged few had palaces and cathedrals. In Ingersoll&#x27;s opinion, it was science that improved people&#x27;s lives, not theology. Ingersoll further maintained that trained theologians reason no better than a person who assumes the devil must exist because pictures resemble the devil so exactly.

The British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins has been an outspoken critic of theology. In an article published in &quot;The Independent&quot; in 1993, he severely criticizes theology as entirely useless, declaring that it has completely and repeatedly failed to answer any questions about the nature of reality or the human condition. He states, &quot;I have never heard any of them [i.e. theologians] ever say anything of the smallest use, anything that was not either platitudinously obvious or downright false.&quot; He then states that, if all theology were completely eradicated from the earth, no one would notice or even care. He concludes:The achievements of theologians don&#x27;t do anything, don&#x27;t affect anything, don&#x27;t achieve anything, don&#x27;t even mean anything. What makes you think that &#x27;theology&#x27; is a subject at all?

<text>The Bay City Rollers are a Scottish pop rock group known for their worldwide teen idol popularity as a band in the 1970s. One of many 70s acts heralded as the &quot;biggest group since the Beatles&quot;, they were called the &quot;tartan teen sensations from Edinburgh&quot;, and sold 5 million albums. Their classic roster during their peak popularity included guitarists Eric Faulkner and Stuart Wood, singer Les McKeown, bassist Alan Longmuir and his younger brother Derek Longmuir as drummer.

The Bay City Rollers&#x27; first album, &quot;Rollin&#x27;&quot; (1974) debuted atop the UK Albums Charts and spent a combined total of fifty-eight weeks on the UK Albums Chart. Their follow up studio album &quot;Once Upon a Star&quot; (1975) continued this success, again, debuting atop the UK Albums Chart. The album yielded the successful singles &quot;Bye, Bye, Baby&quot;, which topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia, and &quot;Keep On Dancing&quot;. &quot;Bye, Bye, Baby&quot; was the best selling single in the United Kingdom in 1975. Their first album to be released in the United States and Canada, &quot;Bay City Rollers&quot; (1975) peaked at number twenty on the U.S &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one in Canada.

Their international sales continued with the release of &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t You Like It?&quot; (1975), &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Love Letter&quot; (1976), &quot;Dedication&quot; (1976) and &quot;It&#x27;s a Game&quot; (1977). Their significance in international charts began to decline in 1978 upon the release of &quot;Strangers in the Wind&quot;, which failed to chart in the United Kingdom, but reached the top five in Japan. Further releases &quot;Elevator&quot; (1979) and &quot;Voxx&quot; (1980) made little impact on international charts. 

Despite their international prominence during the 1970s and early 1980s, the Bay City Rollers never made the transition from boy band, as their members aged, and their career was marked by financial difficulties and mismanagement. Several members accused manager Tom Paton of sexual assault, but no charges were laid. 

The current line-up (since 2018) includes original guitarist Stuart &quot;Woody&quot; Wood, singer Ian Thomson, bassist Mikey Smith, keyboardist/singer John McLaughlin and drummer Jamie McGrory.

==History==
===Early days and formation: 1964–1971===
In 1964, a trio called the Ambassadors was formed in Edinburgh, Scotland, by 16-year-old Alan Longmuir on acoustic guitar, his younger brother Derek Longmuir on drums, and their older cousin Neil Porteous on acoustic guitar. The group never performed publicly under this name, just a family wedding where they covered &quot;Wake Up Little Susie&quot;. They changed their name to the Saxons, and Derek invited a friend from school, Gordon &quot;Nobby&quot; Clark, to be the lead singer. Porteous moved from acoustic to electric guitar, and Alan Longmuir followed suit by changing to electric bass. The Saxons played occasional dance hall concerts while the band members completed their schooling or worked during the day (Alan apprenticed as a plumber). Porteous left the band in July 1965, with new guitarist Dave Pettigrew filling the spot after answering an advertisement placed by the band in an Edinburgh newspaper. Pettigrew was more advanced musically than the others, and pushed the band to improve. Their repertoire included American R&amp;B/pop songs such as &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot; and &quot;Heat Wave&quot;. They played at least one gig at the Gonk Club as the Deadbeats, but they discovered a conflict: Another band was playing locally as Rock Bottom and the Deadbeats.

While taking a technical class at Napier College, Alan met fellow plumbing student Gregory Ellison, who joined the Saxons on electric guitar, with Pettigrew shifting to keyboards. Gregory&#x27;s older brother Mike joined as a second lead singer, allowing more complex harmonies, especially useful for the Motown songs they liked to perform. The band convinced Tam Paton, a former big band leader and influential local band and club manager, to audition them at the Longmuirs&#x27; house. Paton booked them for a Thursday night at his club, the Palais, then assigned them to open for the Hipple People at Top Storey. More gigs followed.

More successful now, the Saxons moved out of the Longmuirs&#x27; back room to practice in Hermiston at a church. They played a couple of contemporary Kinks numbers but favored American songs, including a new one: &quot;C.C. Rider&quot; by Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels. Desiring a better name for the band, they settled on &quot;Rollers&quot;, but needed a more powerful American-sounding term in front of that. Derek Longmuir threw a dart at a map of the United States, landing first on Arkansas. This did not meet anyone&#x27;s approval, so a second dart was thrown. It landed near Bay City, Michigan. The band agreed on the name, the Bay City Rollers. Short-term members from this period included bassist David Paton (from 1969 to 1970) and keyboardist Billy Lyall (1969–71), who went on to be founding members of another Edinburgh band Pilot.

===Breakthrough: 1971–1973===
After signing with Bell Records, the band&#x27;s first hit was &quot;Keep on Dancing&quot; (UK No. 9, 1971), a cover of a 1965 hit by the Gentrys. Upon this release&#x27;s success, they made appearances on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

Several non-charting singles were released over the following two years. This period saw the addition of long-term member guitarist Eric Faulkner. In mid-1973, they narrowly missed the UK Singles Chart with their fourth single, &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. By the end of 1973, Clark had become disillusioned with the band&#x27;s musical direction and decided to leave just when his recording of &quot;Remember (Sha-La-La-La)&quot; climbed the chart to No. 6. He was replaced as lead singer by Les McKeown. A couple of months later, in early 1974, what became known as the classic line-up was completed; guitarist John Devine was replaced by Stuart &quot;Woody&quot; Wood.

In 1987, Les McKeown was a guest on Jonathan Ross&#x27;s chat show where he told Ross that The Bay City Rollers did not perform on the first four singles.

===Rise to prominence: 1974–1975===
In late 1973, McKeown recorded lead vocals on &quot;Remember (Sha-La-La-La)&quot;, and a lead-in to a series of UK chart hits. 16-year-old Stuart Wood completed the &quot;classic five&quot; line-up in February 1974, a week after the band had debuted the &quot;Remember&quot; single on &quot;Top of the Pops.&quot; (John Devine had mimed the piano part). By early 1975, the band was well on the way to achieving global success. The &quot;classic five&quot; line-up consisted of: Alan Longmuir, Derek Longmuir, Stuart &quot;Woody&quot; Wood, Eric Faulkner and Les McKeown. Beginning with &quot;Remember&quot; (UK No. 6), the Rollers&#x27; popularity exploded, and they released a string of hits on the UK chart. Following in succession were &quot;Shang-a-Lang&quot; (UK No. 2), &quot;Summerlove Sensation&quot; (UK No. 3), and &quot;All of Me Loves All of You&quot; (UK No. 4). By early 1975, they were one of the biggest-selling acts in the UK. The successful 1975 UK tour prompted newspaper headlines about the rise of &quot;Rollermania&quot; (alluding to Beatlemania a decade before). The Rollers were the subject of a 20-week UK television series, &quot;Shang-a-Lang&quot;.

A cover of the Four Seasons&#x27; &quot;Bye, Bye, Baby&quot; stayed at No. 1 in the UK for six weeks in March and April 1975, selling nearly a million copies and becoming the biggest seller of the year. The subsequent single, &quot;Give a Little Love&quot; topped the chart in July 1975, achieving their second No. 1 hit. Two albums were produced during this period: &quot;Once Upon a Star&quot; (1975) and &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t You Like It?&quot; (1975). Faulkner and Wood undertook the majority of the songwriting duties. By this time, Bay City Rollers fans had a completely distinctive style of dress, featuring calf-length tartan trousers and tartan scarves.

English singer-songwriter Nick Lowe wrote a &quot;jaundiced&quot; (in Lowe&#x27;s words) paean to the band titled &quot;Bay City Rollers We Love You&quot;. The track was &quot;carefully sculpted&quot; to be poor enough to get Lowe out of a recording contract with United Artists. The strategy backfired. UA issued the record as by the Tartan Horde, which was the name given to Rollers fans in England, and it became a substantial hit in Japan. Lowe was obliged to record a follow-up song called &quot;Rollers Show&quot;, which did not meet with the same commercial success. This follow-up song was included on the U.S. release of Lowe&#x27;s first album &quot;Pure Pop for Now People&quot;.

===World impact: 1976===

As the group&#x27;s popularity swelled to superstardom in the UK, a concerted effort was made by Arista Records (the record company that evolved from Bell) to launch the Rollers in North America. The new Arista head Clive Davis was instrumental in grooming and overseeing the project. His work paid off, as in late 1975 the Rollers reached No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. &quot;Saturday Night&quot; had missed the UK chart completely two years earlier. The Rollers gave the track their American debut, via a satellite-link performance on &quot;Saturday Night Live, with Howard Cosell&quot;. In Canada, it fared equally well, hitting No. 1 on the &quot;RPM&quot; national singles chart on 10 January 1976. The &quot;Bay City Rollers&quot; (1975) album (North American release only) hit No. 1 in the same chart on 7 February.

A second North American hit came with &quot;Money Honey&quot;, written by Faulkner and Wood, which hit No. 9 in the US. In Canada, it fared better, following its predecessor to the top, giving them their second No. 1 in the &quot;RPM&quot; national singles chart on 13 March 1976.

The North America/Japan release album &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Love Letter&quot; (1976) jumped from No. 25 to the top position in a single week in Canada. This deposed their own &quot;Bay City Rollers&quot; (1975) at No. 1 on the national chart, on 27 March 1976, However, it only managed to achieve the No. 31 spot on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

They were also extremely popular in Australia. On October 23, 1976 they appeared on the long-running Australian music TV show &quot;Countdown&quot;, a date which happened to coincide with a total eclipse of the sun. The show&#x27;s director Ted Emery recalled:

Alan Longmuir had left the group by early 1976, due to both the pressures of the band&#x27;s success and feeling discomfort at being a member of a teen band whilst in his late twenties. He was replaced for seven months by 17-year-old Ian Mitchell from Northern Ireland; he was the first band member born outside Edinburgh. With Mitchell, the group released an album titled &quot;Dedication&quot; (1976), and hit the chart with a cover version of the Dusty Springfield song &quot;I Only Want to Be with You. &quot; The song reached US No. 12, as well as &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Hero&quot; (featuring live material from a 1976 personal appearance in Toronto&#x27;s Nathan Phillips Square), and &quot;Dedication&quot;.

===Decline and line–up changes: 1977–1979===

As the Rollers&#x27; popularity waned, the shuffling of personnel continued; Mitchell quit the band. He was replaced by guitarist Pat McGlynn. Further struggles involved the direction of their sound, as the members wished to pursue more sophisticated styles. They settled on David Bowie&#x27;s producer, Harry Maslin, and in August 1977 released &quot;It&#x27;s a Game&quot; as a four-piece group, comprising McKeown, Wood, Faulkner and Derek Longmuir. The &quot;It&#x27;s a Game&quot; tour was recorded in 1977 at Japan&#x27;s Budokan Hall, and was later released in 2001 as &quot;Rollerworld: Live at the Budokan 1977&quot;.

On the tour, they covered &quot;It&#x27;s a Game&quot;, an unsuccessful 1973 single by String Driven Thing, to give them their final UK Top 20 hit (No. 16 in May 1977). Oddly enough, this single provided them with their highest-charting German hit, reaching No. 4 in the same year. The follow-up &quot;You Made Me Believe in Magic&quot; made No. 34 in July in the UK and No. 10 in the U.S., and this single was their final major success.

The Bay City Rollers were on &quot;The Krofft Superstar Hour&quot;, later named the &quot;Bay City Rollers Show&quot;, an hour-long show that aired from September 9, 1978, to January 27, 1979. During this time, the classic line-up released their last album together, Strangers in the Wind, which charted only in Australia, (No. 61) Japan, (No. 5) and the US (No. 128).

===The Rollers: 1979–1980===
At the end of 1978, the band had split with McKeown, then fired manager Tam Paton shortly after, and decided to continue in a more new wave, rock-oriented sound. Their name was now The Rollers. South African-born Duncan Faure joined the band as new lead vocalist, guitarist and songwriter. With Faure, the line-up produced three albums: &quot;Elevator&quot; (1979), &quot;Voxx&quot; (1980) and &quot;Ricochet&quot; (1981). Following the expiry of the band&#x27;s Arista contract, none of the releases sold as well as expected, and they stopped touring by late 1981.

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; compared &quot;Ricochet&quot; to the pop/new wave style of The Cars and recommended the album be &quot;rescued from obscurity&quot;.

===&quot;Breakout&quot; and touring: 1980–1990===
During the 1980s and 1990s, there were a few short tours. Seven past members played Japan in 1982, and again in 1983. A reunion album, &quot;Breakout&quot;, was released in Japan and Australia in 1985, and added drummer George Spencer. &quot;Breakout&quot; was written primarily by McKeown and McGlynn with minor contributions from Faulkner, Wood, and Mitchell. In the late 1980s, a version of the band called the New Rollers was formed featuring Faulkner on lead vocals, Karen Prosser on vocals, Jason Medvec on guitar, Andy Boakes on bass, and Mark Roberts on drums. The band toured extensively throughout the US and Canada as well as tours of the UK and Australia. This group also released an independent four-song EP titled &quot;Party Harty&quot;.

In 1990, Wood and Alan Longmuir joined with Faulkner to tour under the Bay City Rollers name and issued several CDs of re-recordings of the old Roller tunes.

===Re–union: 1996–2000===

In 1996, the classic line-up reunited and performed &quot;Saturday Night&quot; on a Japanese television show to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Rollermania.

The classic line-up (minus Derek Longmuir) performed a one-off New Year&#x27;s Eve millennium concert, the last official Bay City Rollers concert (1999–2000) in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle in Scotland. Interest was rekindled in the UK by various television documentaries about the group; and the television-advertised compilation &quot;Very Best of the Bay City Rollers&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart on release in 2004 at No. 11.

===Spin–off and financial dispute: 2000–2015===
During the late 2000s, Ian Mitchell led his own Bay City Rollers band, which included lead vocalist Kyle Vincent. Mitchell was the only ex-Roller involved.

====Sexual assault allegations against manager====
Members of the Bay City Rollers have accused former manager Tam Paton of sexual abuse. In 2003, McGlynn accused Paton of trying to rape him in a hotel room in 1977. However, the police decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Paton. Paton had previous arrests for sexual misconduct with underage boys. In 2009, McKeown accused Paton of raping him. In the 2023 documentary &quot;Secrets of the Bay City Rollers,&quot; potential band member Gert Magnus claimed that Paton offered him a place in the band in exchange for sex.

====Lawsuit to reclaim royalties from Arista==== 
In March 2007, six former members of the group (Faure plus the &quot;classic line-up&quot;) announced a lawsuit against Arista Records in hopes of claiming what they described as &quot;tens of millions of dollars&quot; of unpaid royalties. Gordon &quot;Nobby&quot; Clark threatened to sue the other band members if their lawsuit was successful, stating that he was the creative force behind the band&#x27;s success, even though he left the group in 1973, before the bulk of their fame and fortune began. 

In September 2010, Clark, Ian Mitchell and Pat McGlynn filed a complaint in the courts in the United States against the six members (Faure plus the &quot;classic line-up&quot;) over being excluded from the case against Arista records. Clark, Mitchell and McGlynn were seeking to have their rights determined and were seeking financial damages against the other Bay City Rollers for alleged breach of contract. In 2013, a judge in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the three due to the statute of frauds, which establishes that certain agreements must be in writing under certain conditions, and the appellate judge&#x27;s ruling stated: &quot;A claim for unjust enrichment must be based on the value of plaintiffs&#x27; contribution to the joint effort of the band at the time it made the relevant records, not on the income stream resulting from a revival over thirty years later.&quot;

In March 2011, a New York judge determined that the Bay City Rollers could move forward with their four-year-old lawsuit against Arista Records. Arista denied responsibility for the majority of the royalties, citing a New York statute of limitations. The statute limits plaintiffs from recovering damages post six years in contract disputes, which therefore would negate the Rollers&#x27; claims for royalties incurred before 2001. However, because Arista had continued to promise the Bay City Rollers their royalties in writing, the judge ruled that the statute was not applicable. After almost a decade, the legal battle came to an end with an out-of-court settlement in 2016. Arista Records&#x27; parent company Sony Music is believed to have paid $3.5 million, with each band member receiving £70,000.

===Second re–union: 2015–2018===
On 22 September 2015, the Bay City Rollers, including McKeown, Wood, and Alan Longmuir, announced they were reforming and would play a show at the Glasgow Barrowlands on 20 December. Eric Faulkner was unable to contribute because of health concerns, almost dying in February 2015 after contracting viral encephalitis. The band released one new single, &quot;Boomerang&quot;, and discussed plans for a new album. The reunion continued into 2016 before Wood ended the reunited line-up on 9 July 2016 because no shows were being booked for the so-called reunion. After the 2015 Christmas shows Les was booking shows only for himself and his band during 2016 (except T In The Park) which caused the reunion to end. Plans for a new album and various tours that were hoped to take place in 2017 never materialised. Prior to the reunion and after the end of the tour, McKeown continued to tour as &quot;Les McKeown&#x27;s Bay City Rollers&quot;.

===Recent history: 2018–present===
On 27 February 2018, Stuart &#x27;Woody&#x27; Wood announced that a &quot;new generation&quot; Bay City Rollers would be performing in Tokyo, Japan in June of the same year. The band comprises the original classic five members Stuart &#x27;Woody&#x27; Wood on guitar, Ian Thomson on lead vocals and guitar, Marcus Cordock on bass (later replaced by Mikey Smith) and Jamie McGrory on drums. Bassist Alan Longmuir died on 2 July 2018 after falling ill while on holiday with his wife in Mexico. His autobiography &quot;I Ran with the Gang: My Life in and Out of The Bay City Rollers&quot; was published posthumously in November 2018; the book was written with Martin Knight. In his book, Alan Longmuir mentioned his hope for McKeown and Wood to put aside their differences and reunite one more time. In 2019, after rumors related to Alan Longmuir&#x27;s wishes, both McKeown and Wood denied any chance of another reunion and did not want to work with each other, though McKeown did mention his desire to work with Faulkner.

After both McKeown&#x27;s and Wood&#x27;s bands were sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic, McKeown mentioned in August 2020 that he would be willing to reunite with Wood again with more planning. On 1 September 2020, Ian Mitchell died at the age of 62 after suffering from throat cancer.

On 20 April 2021, Les McKeown died aged 65.

For the period between 9 March and 10 December 2023, however, a total of 11 concerts and appearances at festivals were planned again with the line-up of Ian Thomson, Stuart &#x27;Woody&#x27; Wood, Mikey Smith and Jamie McGrory, nine of them in the UK and one each in Denmark and Germany. The band are currently chalking up festivals and more shows throughout 2024.

On 13 September 2024, the bands tour van, that included all of their instruments and equipment, was stolen while touring in Walsall. Wood&#x27;s tartan-painted guitar was the only piece of equipment not stolen, as he had travelled separately from the band (via train), and had his guitar with him. A local music shop rented out their equipment for the band for subsequent events.

<doc id="30511" wikidata="Q37090" url="?curid=30511" title="Trinity">
<text>The Trinity (, from &#x27;threefold&#x27;) is the Christian doctrine concerning the nature of God, which defines one God existing in three, , consubstantial divine persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Spirit, three distinct persons (&quot;hypostases&quot;) sharing one essence/substance/nature (&quot;homoousion&quot;). 

As the Fourth Lateran Council declared, it is the Father who s, the Son who is , and the Holy Spirit who proceeds. In this context, one essence/nature defines God is, while the three persons define God is. This expresses at once their distinction and their indissoluble unity. Thus, the entire process of creation and grace is viewed as a single shared action of the three divine persons, in which each person manifests the attributes unique to them in the Trinity, thereby proving that everything comes &quot;from the Father,&quot; &quot;through the Son,&quot; and &quot;in the Holy Spirit.&quot;

This doctrine is called Trinitarianism and its adherents are called Trinitarians, while its opponents are called antitrinitarians or nontrinitarians and considered non-Christian by most mainline groups. Nontrinitarian positions include Unitarianism, binitarianism and modalism. The theological study of the Trinity is called &quot;triadology&quot; or &quot;Trinitarian theology.&quot;

While the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the New Testament, the New Testament possesses a triadic understanding of God and contains a number of Trinitarian formulas. The doctrine of the Trinity was first formulated among the early Christians (mid-2nd century and later) and fathers of the Church as they attempted to understand the relationship between Jesus and God in their scriptural documents and prior traditions.

== Old Testament ==
The Old Testament has been interpreted as referring to the Trinity in many places. For example, in the Genesis creation narrative, specifically the first-person plural pronouns in Genesis 1:26–27 and Genesis 3:22 (&#x27;Let &quot;us&quot; make man in &quot;our&quot; image [...] the man is become as one of &quot;us&quot;&#x27;).

A traditional Christian interpretation of these pronouns is that they refer to a plurality of persons within the Godhead. Biblical commentator Victor P. Hamilton outlines several interpretations, including the most widely held among Biblical scholars, which is that the pronouns do not refer to other persons within the Godhead but to the &#x27;heavenly court&#x27; of Isaiah 6. Theologians Meredith Kline and Gerhard von Rad argue for this view, as von Rad says, &#x27;The extraordinary plural (&quot;Let us&quot;) is to prevent one from referring God&#x27;s image too directly to God the Lord. God includes himself among the heavenly beings of his court and thereby conceals himself in this majority.&#x27; Hamilton notes that this interpretation assumes that Genesis 1 is at variance with Isaiah 40:13–14, &quot;Who has measured the Spirit of the Lord, or what man shows him his counsel? Whom did he consult, and who made him understand? Who taught him the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed him the way of understanding?&quot; That is, if the plural pronouns of Genesis 1 teach that God consults and creates with a &#x27;heavenly court&#x27;, then it contradicts the statement in Isaiah that God seeks the counsel of nobody. According to Hamilton, the best interpretation &#x27;approaches the trinitarian understanding but employs less direct terminology&#x27;. Following D. J. A. Clines, he states that the plural reveals a &#x27;duality within the Godhead&#x27; that recalls the &#x27;Spirit of God&#x27; mentioned in verse 2, &quot;And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.&quot; Hamilton also says that it is unreasonable to assume that the author of Genesis was too theologically primitive to deal with such a concept as &#x27;plurality within unity&#x27;; Hamilton thus argues for a framework of progressive revelation, in which the doctrine of the Trinity is revealed at first obscurely then plainly in the New Testament.

Another of these places is the prophecy about the Messiah in Isaiah 9. The Messiah is called &quot;Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.&quot; Some Christians see this verse as meaning the Messiah will represent the Trinity on earth. This is because Counselor is a title for the Holy Spirit (John 14:26), the Trinity is God, Father is a title for God the Father, and Prince of Peace is a title for Jesus. This verse is also used to support the Deity of Christ.

Another verse used to support the Deity of Christ is

This is because both the Ancient of Days (God the Father) and the Son of Man (Jesus, Matt 16:13) have an everlasting dominion, which is ascribed to God in Psalm 145:13.

Some also argue

to be Trinitarian in apparently distinguishing between the Lord in heaven and the Lord on earth.

People also see the Trinity when the Old Testament refers to God&#x27;s word (Psalm 33:6), His Spirit (Isaiah 61:1), and Wisdom (Proverbs 9:1), as well as narratives such as the appearance of the three men to Abraham. However, it is generally agreed among Trinitarian Christian scholars that it would go beyond the intention and spirit of the Old Testament to correlate these notions directly with later Trinitarian doctrine.

Some Church Fathers believed that a knowledge of the mystery was granted to the prophets and saints of the Old Testament, and that they identified the divine messenger of Genesis 16:7, Genesis 21:17, Genesis 31:11, Exodus 3:2 and Wisdom of the sapiential books with the Son, and &quot;the spirit of the Lord&quot; with the Holy Spirit.

Other Church Fathers, such as Gregory Nazianzen, argued in his &quot;Orations&quot; that the revelation was gradual, claiming that the Father was proclaimed in the Old Testament openly, but the Son only obscurely, because &quot;it was not safe, when the Godhead of the Father was not yet acknowledged, plainly to proclaim the Son&quot;.

Genesis 18–19 has been interpreted by Christians as a Trinitarian text. The narrative has the Lord appearing to Abraham, who was visited by three men. In Genesis 19, &quot;the two angels&quot; visited Lot at Sodom. The interplay between Abraham on the one hand and the Lord/three men/the two angels on the other was an intriguing text for those who believed in a single God in three persons. Justin Martyr, and John Calvin similarly, interpreted it such that Abraham was visited by God, who was accompanied by two angels. Justin supposed that the God who visited Abraham was distinguishable from the God who remains in the heavens, but was nevertheless identified as the (monotheistic) God. Justin interpreted the God who visited Abraham as Jesus, the second person of the Trinity.

Augustine, in contrast, held that the three visitors to Abraham were the three persons of the Trinity. He saw no indication that the visitors were unequal, as would be the case in Justin&#x27;s reading. Then in Genesis 19, two of the visitors were addressed by Lot in the singular: &quot;Lot said to them, &#x27;Not so, my lord (Gen. 19:18). Augustine saw that Lot could address them as one because they had a single substance, despite the plurality of persons.

Christians interpret the theophanies, or appearances of the Angel of the Lord, as revelations of a person distinct from God, who is nonetheless called God. This interpretation is found in Christianity as early as Justin Martyr and Melito of Sardis, and reflects ideas that were already present in Philo. The Old Testament theophanies were thus seen as Christophanies, each a &quot;preincarnate appearance of the Messiah&quot;.

== New Testament ==
While the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the New Testament, the New Testament contains several Trinitarian formulas, including Matthew 28:19, 2 Corinthians 13:14, Ephesians 4:4–6, 1 Peter 1:2, and Revelation 1:4–6. Reflection by early Christians on passages such as the Great Commission: &quot;Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&quot; and Paul the Apostle&#x27;s blessing: &quot;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all&quot;, leading theologians across history in attempting to articulate the relationship between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. 

Eventually, the diverse references to God, Jesus, and the Spirit found in the New Testament were brought together to form the concept of the Trinity—one Godhead subsisting in three persons and one substance. The concept of the Trinity was used to oppose alternative views of how the three are related and to defend the church against charges of worshiping two or three gods.

===1 John 5:7–8===
Modern Biblical scholarship largely agrees that 1 John 5:7 seen in Latin and Greek texts after the 4th century and found in later translations such as the King James Translation, cannot be found in the oldest Greek and Latin texts. Verse 7 is known as the Johannine Comma, which most scholars agree to be a later addition by a later copyist or what is termed a textual gloss and not part of the original text. This verse reads:
This verse is absent from the Ethiopic, Aramaic, Syriac, Slavic, early Armenian, Georgian, and Arabic translations of the Greek New Testament. It is primarily found in Latin manuscripts, although a minority of Greek, Slavonic and late Armenian manuscripts contain it. 

=== Jesus in the New Testament ===
In the Pauline epistles, the public, collective devotional patterns towards Jesus in the early Christian community are reflective of Paul&#x27;s perspective on the divine status of Jesus in what scholars have termed a &quot;binitarian&quot; pattern or shape of devotional practice (worship) in the New Testament, in which &quot;God&quot; and Jesus are thematized and invoked. Jesus receives prayer (1 Corinthians 1:2; 2 Corinthians 12:8–9), the presence of Jesus is confessionally invoked by believers (1 Corinthians 16:22; Romans 10:9–13; Philippians 2:10–11), people are baptized in Jesus&#x27; name (1 Corinthians 6:11; Romans 6:3), Jesus is the reference in Christian fellowship for a religious ritual meal (the Lord&#x27;s Supper; 1 Corinthians 11:17–34). Jesus is described as &quot;existing in the very form of God&quot; (Philippians 2:6), and having the &quot;fullness of the Deity [living] in bodily form&quot; (Colossians 2:9). Jesus is also in some verses directly called God (Romans 9:5, Titus 2:13, 2 Peter 1:1).

The Gospels depict Jesus as human through most of their narrative, but &quot;[o]ne eventually discovers that he is a divine being manifest in flesh, and the point of the texts is in part to make his higher nature known in a kind of intellectual epiphany.&quot; In the Gospels Jesus is described as forgiving sins, leading some theologians to believe Jesus is portrayed as God. This is because Jesus forgives sins on the behalf of others, people normally only forgive transgressions against oneself. The teachers of the law next to Jesus recognizes this and saidJesus also receives () in the aftermath of the resurrection, a Greek term that either expresses the contemporary social gesture of bowing to a superior, either on one&#x27;s knees or in full prostration (in Matthew 18:26 a slave performs to his master so that he would not be sold after being unable to pay his debts). The term can also refer to the religious act of devotion towards a deity. While Jesus receives a number of times in the synoptic Gospels, only a few can be said to refer to divine worship.

This includes Matthew 28:16–20, an account of the resurrected Jesus receiving worship from his disciples after proclaiming his authority over the cosmos and his ever-continuing presence with the disciples (forming an inclusion with the beginning of the Gospel, where Jesus is given the name Emmanuel, &quot;God with us,&quot; a name that alludes to the God of Israel&#x27;s ongoing presence with his followers throughout the Old Testament (Genesis 28:15; Deuteronomy 20:1). Whereas some have argued that Matthew 28:19 was an interpolation on account of its absence from the first few centuries of early Christian quotations, scholars largely accept the passage as authentic due to its supporting manuscript evidence and that it does appear to be either quoted in the Didache (7:1–3) or at least reflected in the Didache as part of a common tradition from which both Matthew and the Didache emerged. Jesus receiving divine worship in the post-resurrection accounts is further mirrored in Luke 24:52. 

Acts depicts the early Christian movement as a public cult centered around Jesus in several passages. In Acts, it is common for individual Christians to &quot;call&quot; upon the name of Jesus (9:14, 21; 22:16), an idea precedented in the Old Testament descriptions of calling on the name of YHWH as a form of prayer. The story of Stephen depicts Stephen invoking and crying out to Jesus in the final moments of his life to receive his spirit (7:59–60). Acts further describes a common ritual practice inducting new members into the early Jesus sect by baptizing them in Jesus&#x27; name (2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5). According to Dale Allison, Acts depicts the appearances of Jesus to Paul as a divine theophany, styled on and identified with the God responsible for the theophany of Ezekiel in the Old Testament.

The Gospel of John has been seen as especially aimed at emphasizing Jesus&#x27; divinity, presenting Jesus as the &quot;Logos&quot;, pre-existent and divine, from its first words: &quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&quot; (John 1:1). The Gospel of John ends with Thomas&#x27;s declaration that he believed Jesus was God, &quot;My Lord and my God!&quot; (John 20:28). Modern scholars agree that John 1:1 and John 20:28 identify Jesus with God. However, in a 1973 Journal of Biblical Literature article, Philip B. Harner, Professor Emeritus of Religion at Heidelberg College, claimed that the traditional translation of John 1:1c (&quot;and the Word was God&quot;) is incorrect. He endorses the New English Bible translation of John 1:1c, &quot;and what God was, the Word was.&quot; However Harner&#x27;s claim has been criticized by other scholars. In the same article, Harner also noted that; &quot;Perhaps the clause could be translated, &#x27;the Word had the same nature as God&quot;. This would be one way of representing John&#x27;s thought, which is, as I understand it, that the logos, no less than the theos, had the nature of theos,&quot; which in his case means the Word is as fully God as the person called &quot;God&quot;. John also portrays Jesus as the agent of creation of the universe.

====Jesus in later Christian theology====
Some have suggested that John presents a hierarchy when he quotes Jesus as saying, &quot;The Father is greater than I&quot;, a statement which was appealed to by nontrinitarian groups such as Arianism. However, influential theologians such as Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas argued this statement was to be understood as Jesus speaking about his human nature.

=== Holy Spirit in the New Testament ===
Prior Israelite theology held that the Spirit is merely the divine presence of God himself, whereas orthodox Christian theology holds that the Holy Spirit is a distinct person of God the Father himself. This development begins early in the New Testament, as the Spirit of God receives much more emphasis and description comparably than it had in earlier Jewish writing. Whereas there are 75 references to the Spirit within the Old Testament and 35 identified in the non-biblical Dead Sea Scrolls, the New Testament, despite its significantly shorter length, mentions the Spirit 275 times. In addition to its larger emphasis and importance placed on the Spirit in the New Testament, the Spirit is also described in much more personalized and individualized terms than earlier. Larry Hurtado writes;
The Holy Spirit is described as God in the book of the Acts of the ApostlesPeter first says Ananias is lying to the Holy Spirit, he then says he is lying to God.

In the New Testament, the Spirit is not portrayed as the recipient of cultic devotion, which instead, is typically offered to God the Father and to the risen/glorified Jesus. Although what became mainstream Christianity subsequently affirmed the propriety of including the Spirit as the recipient of worship as reflected in the developed form of the Nicene Creed, perhaps the closest to this in the New Testament is in Matthew 28:19 and 2 Corinthians 13:14 which describe the Spirit as the subject of religious ritual.

====Holy Spirit in later Christian theology====
As the Arian controversy was dissipating, the debate moved from the deity of Jesus Christ to the equality of the Holy Spirit with the Father and Son. On one hand, the Pneumatomachi sect declared that the Holy Spirit was an inferior person to the Father and Son. On the other hand, the Cappadocian Fathers argued that the Holy Spirit was equal to the Father and Son in nature or substance.

Although the main text used in defense of the deity of the Holy Spirit was Matthew 28:19, Cappadocian Fathers such as Basil the Great argued from other verses such as &quot;But Peter said, &#x27;Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land? While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God. (Acts 5:3–4).

Another passage the Cappadocian Fathers quoted from was &quot;By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host&quot; (Psalm 33:6). According to their understanding, because &quot;breath&quot; and &quot;spirit&quot; in Hebrew are both &quot;רוּחַ&quot; (&quot;ruach&quot;), Psalm 33:6 is revealing the roles of the Son and Holy Spirit as co-creators. And since, according to them, because only the holy God can create holy beings such as the angels, the Son and Holy Spirit must be God.

Yet another argument from the Cappadocian Fathers to prove that the Holy Spirit is of the same nature as the Father and Son comes from &quot;For who knows a person&#x27;s thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God&quot; (1 Corinthians 2:11). They reasoned that this passage proves that the Holy Spirit has the same relationship to God as the spirit within us has to us.

The Cappadocian Fathers also quoted, &quot;Do you not know that you are God&#x27;s temple and that God&#x27;s Spirit dwells in you?&quot; (1 Corinthians 3:16) and reasoned that it would be blasphemous for an inferior being to take up residence in a temple of God, thus proving that the Holy Spirit is equal with the Father and the Son.

They also combined &quot;the servant does not know what his master is doing&quot; (John 15:15) with 1 Corinthians 2:11 in an attempt to show that the Holy Spirit is not the slave of God, and therefore his equal.

The Pneumatomachi contradicted the Cappadocian Fathers by quoting, &quot;Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?&quot; (Hebrews 1:14) in effect arguing that the Holy Spirit is no different from other created angelic spirits. The Church Fathers disagreed, saying that the Holy Spirit is greater than the angels, since the Holy Spirit is the one who grants the foreknowledge for prophecy (1 Corinthians 12:8–10) so that the angels could announce events to come.

== Early Christianity ==
===Before the Council of Nicaea===
While the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the New Testament, it was first formulated as early Christians attempted to understand the relationship between Jesus and God in their scriptural documents and prior traditions. According to Margaret Baker, trinitarian theology has roots in pre-Christian Palestinian beliefs about angels.

An early reference to the three &quot;persons&quot; of later Trinitarian doctrines appears towards the end of the first century, where Clement of Rome rhetorically asks in his epistle as to why corruption exists among some in the Christian community; &quot;Do we not have one God, and one Christ, and one gracious Spirit that has been poured out upon us, and one calling in Christ?&quot; (1 Clement 46:6). A similar example is found in the first century Didache, which directs Christians to &quot;baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&quot;.

Ignatius of Antioch similarly refers to all three persons around AD 110, exhorting obedience to &quot;Christ, and to the Father, and to the Spirit&quot;. 

The pseudonymous Ascension of Isaiah, written sometime between the end of the first century and the beginning of the third century, possesses a &quot;proto-trinitarian&quot; view, such as in its narrative of how the inhabitants of the sixth heaven sing praises to &quot;the primal Father and his Beloved Christ, and the Holy Spirit&quot;.

Justin Martyr (AD 100 – c. 165) also writes, &quot;in the name of God, the Father and Lord of the universe, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit&quot;. Justin Martyr is the first to use much of the terminology that would later become widespread in codified Trinitarian theology. For example, he describes that the Son and Father are the same &quot;being&quot; () and yet are also distinct faces (), anticipating the three persons () that come with Tertullian and later authors. Justin describes how Jesus, the Son, is distinguishable from the Father but also derives from the Father, using the analogy of a fire (representing the Son) that is lit from its source, a torch (representing the Father). At another point, Justin Martyr wrote that &quot;we worship him [Jesus Christ] with reason, since we have learned that he is the Son of the living God himself, and believe him to be in second place and the prophetic Spirit in the third&quot; (1 Apology 13, cf. ch. 60).
About the Christian Baptism, he wrote that &quot;in the name of God, the Father and Lord of the universe, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, they then receive the washing with water&quot;, highlighting the liturgical use of a Trinitarian formula.
The first of the early Church Fathers to be recorded using the word &quot;Trinity&quot; was Theophilus of Antioch writing in the late 2nd century. He defines the Trinity as God, his Word () and his Wisdom () in the context of a discussion of the first three days of creation, following the early Christian practice of identifying the Holy Spirit as the Wisdom of God.

The first defense of the doctrine of the Trinity was by Tertullian, who was born around 150–160 AD, explicitly &quot;defined&quot; the Trinity as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and defended his theology against Praxeas, although he noted that the majority of the believers in his day found issue with his doctrine.

St. Justin and Clement of Alexandria referenced all three persons of the Trinity in their doxologies and St. Basil likewise, in the evening lighting of lamps.

Origen of Alexandria (AD 185 – c. 253) has often been interpreted as Subordinationist – believing in shared divinity of the three persons but not in co-equality. (Some modern researchers have argued that Origen might have actually been anti-Subordinationist and that his own Trinitarian theology inspired the Trinitarian theology of the later Cappadocian Fathers.)

The concept of the Trinity can be seen as developing significantly during the first four centuries by the Church Fathers in reaction to theological interpretations known as Adoptionism, Sabellianism, and Arianism. Adoptionism was the belief that Jesus was an ordinary man, born of Joseph and Mary, who became the Christ and Son of God at his baptism. In 269, the Synods of Antioch condemned Paul of Samosata for his Adoptionist theology, and also condemned the term (, &quot;of the same being&quot;) in the modalist sense in which he used it.

Among the nontrinitarian beliefs, Sabellianism taught that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are essentially one and the same, the difference being simply verbal, describing different aspects or roles of a single being. For this view Sabellius was excommunicated for heresy in Rome c. 220.

=== First Council of Nicaea (325) ===
In the fourth century, Arianism, as traditionally understood, taught that the Father existed prior to the Son who was not, by nature, God but rather a changeable creature who was granted the dignity of becoming &quot;Son of God&quot;. In 325, the First Council of Nicaea adopted the Nicene Creed which described Christ as &quot;God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father&quot;, and the &quot;Holy Ghost&quot; as the one by which &quot;was incarnate ... of the Virgin Mary&quot;. (&quot;the Word was made flesh and dwelled among us&quot;). About the Father and the Son, the creed used the term (of one substance) to define the relationship between the Father and the Son. After more than fifty years of debate, was recognised as the hallmark of orthodoxy, and was further developed into the formula of &quot;three persons, one being&quot;.

The Confession of the First Council of Nicaea, the Nicene Creed, said little about the Holy Spirit. At the First Council of Nicea (325) all attention was focused on the relationship between the Father and the Son, without making any similar statement about the Holy Spirit. In the words of the creed:

===First Council of Constantinople (381)===

Later, at the First Council of Constantinople (381), the Nicene Creed would be expanded, known as Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, by saying that the Holy Spirit is worshiped and glorified together with the Father and the Son (), suggesting that he was also consubstantial with them:

The doctrine of the divinity and personality of the Holy Spirit was developed by Athanasius in the last decades of his life. He defended and refined the Nicene formula. By the end of the 4th century, under the leadership of Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus (the Cappadocian Fathers), the doctrine had reached substantially its current form.

===Middle Ages===
Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, and Basil the Great account for the Trinity saw that the distinctions between the three divine persons were solely in their inner divine relations. There are not three gods, God is one divine Being in three persons. Where the Cappadocian Fathers used social analogies to describe the triune nature of God, Augustine of Hippo used psychological analogy. He believed that if man is created in the image of
God, he is created in the image of the Trinity. Augustine&#x27;s analogy for the Trinity is the memory, intelligence, and will in the mind of a man. In short, Christians do not have to think of three persons when they think of God; they may think of one person.

In the late 6th century, some Latin-speaking churches added the words &quot;and from the Son&quot; () to the description of the procession of the Holy Spirit, words that were not included in the text by either the Council of Nicaea or that of Constantinople. This was incorporated into the liturgical practice of Rome in 1014. eventually became one of the main causes for the East–West Schism in 1054, and the failures of the repeated union attempts.

Gregory of Nazianzus would say of the Trinity, &quot;No sooner do I conceive of the One than I am illumined by the splendour of the Three; no sooner do I distinguish Three than I am carried back into the One. When I think of any of the Three, I think of Him as the Whole, and my eyes are filled, and the greater part of what I am thinking escapes me. I cannot grasp the greatness of that One so as to attribute a greater greatness to the rest. When I contemplate the Three together, I see but one torch, and cannot divide or measure out the undivided light.&quot;

Devotion to the Trinity centered in the French monasteries at Tours and Aniane where Benedict of Aniane dedicated the abbey church to the Trinity in 872. Feast days were not instituted until 1091 at Cluny and 1162 at Canterbury and papal resistance continued until 1331.

== Theology ==
=== Trinitarian baptismal formula ===
Baptism is generally conferred with the Trinitarian formula, &quot;in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&quot;. Trinitarians identify this name with the Christian faith into which baptism is an initiation, as seen for example in the statement of Basil the Great (330–379): &quot;We are bound to be baptized in the terms we have received, and to profess faith in the terms in which we have been baptized.&quot; The First Council of Constantinople (381) also says, &quot;This is the Faith of our baptism that teaches us to believe in the Name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. According to this Faith there is one Godhead, Power, and Being of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&quot; may be taken to indicate that baptism was associated with this formula from the earliest decades of the Church&#x27;s existence. Other Trinitarian formulas found in the New Testament include in 2 Corinthians 13:14, 1 Corinthians 12:4–6, Ephesians 4:4–6, 1 Peter 1:2 and Revelation 1:4–5.

Oneness Pentecostals demur from the Trinitarian view of baptism and emphasize baptism &quot;in the name of Jesus Christ&quot; only, what they hold to be the original apostolic formula. For this reason, they often focus on the baptisms in Acts. Those who place great emphasis on the baptisms in Acts often likewise question the authenticity of Matthew 28:19 in its present form. Most scholars of New Testament textual criticism accept the authenticity of the passage, since there are no variant manuscripts regarding the formula, and the extant form of the passage is attested in the Didache and other patristic works of the 1st and 2nd centuries: Ignatius, Tertullian, Hippolytus, Cyprian, and Gregory Thaumaturgus.

Commenting on Matthew 28:19, Gerhard Kittel states:

=== One God in three persons === 

In Trinitarian doctrine, God exists as three persons but is one being, having a single divine nature. The members of the Trinity are co-equal and co-eternal, one in essence, nature, power, action, and will. As stated in the Athanasian Creed, the Father is uncreated, the Son is uncreated, and the Holy Spirit is uncreated, and all three are eternal without beginning. &quot;The Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit&quot; are not names for different parts of God, but one name for God because three persons exist in God as one entity. They cannot be separate from one another. Each person is understood as having the identical essence or nature, not merely similar natures.

According to the Eleventh Council of Toledo (675) &quot;For, when we say: He who is the Father is not the Son, we refer to the distinction of persons; but when we say: the Father is that which the Son is, the Son that which the Father is, and the Holy Spirit that which the Father is and the Son is, this clearly refers to the nature or substance&quot;.

The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) adds: &quot;Therefore in God there is only a Trinity, not a quaternity, since each of the three persons is that reality – that is to say substance, essence or divine nature-which alone is the principle of all things, besides which no other principle can be found. This reality neither begets nor is begotten nor proceeds; the Father begets, the Son is begotten and the holy Spirit proceeds. Thus there is a distinction of persons but a unity of nature. Although therefore the Father is one person, the Son another person and the holy Spirit another person, they are not different realities, but rather that which is the Father is the Son and the holy Spirit, altogether the same; thus according to the orthodox and catholic faith they are believed to be consubstantial. &quot;

Clarification of the relationships among the three Trinitarian &quot;Persons&quot; (divine persons, different from the sense of a &quot;human self&quot;) advanced in the Magisterial statement promulgated by the Council of Florence (1431–1449), though its formulation precedes the council: &quot;These three persons are one God and not three gods, for the three are one substance, one essence, one nature, one Godhead, one infinity, one eternity, and everything (in them) is one
where there is no opposition of relationship []&quot;. Robert Magliola explains that most theologians have taken in the &quot;Thomist&quot; sense, namely, the &quot;opposition of relationship&quot; [in English we would say &quot;oppositional relationship&quot;] is one of contrariety rather than contradiction. The only &quot;functions&quot; that are applied to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit respectively in Scripture are the following: &quot;Paternity&quot; to the Father, &quot;Filiation&quot; (Sonship) to the Son, and &quot;Passive Spiration&quot; or that which is &quot;breathed out&quot;, to the Holy Spirit. Magliola goes on to explain:

Magliola, continuing the Rahnerian stance, goes on to explain that the Divine Persons necessarily relate to each other in terms of &quot;pure negative reference&quot;, that is, the three &quot;Is Not&quot; relations represented in the diagram are in each case a pure or absolute &quot;Is Not&quot;. This is the case because the clause disallows the Persons to &quot;share&quot;, qua Persons, the unique role that defines each of them. Lest he be misunderstood, Magliola, in a subsequent publication, makes sure to specify that each of the three Persons, while unique as a Person, is nonetheless—because of the Divine &quot;consubstantiality&quot; and &quot;simplicity&quot;—the &quot;one&quot; Reality that is God.

=== &quot;Perichoresis&quot; ===
 (from Greek, &quot;going around&quot;, &quot;envelopment&quot;) is a term used by some scholars to describe the relationship among the members of the Trinity. The Latin equivalent for this term is . This concept refers for its basis to John 10:38,14:11,14:20, where Jesus is instructing the disciples concerning the meaning of his departure. His going to the Father, he says, is for their sake; so that he might come to them when the &quot;other comforter&quot; is given to them. Then, he says, his disciples will dwell in him, as he dwells in the Father, and the Father dwells in him, and the Father will dwell in them. This is so, according to the theory of , because the persons of the Trinity &quot;reciprocally contain one another, so that one permanently envelopes and is permanently enveloped by, the other whom he yet envelopes&quot; (Hilary of Poitiers, &quot;Concerning the Trinity&quot; 3:1). The most prominent exponent of was John of Damascus (d. 749) who employed the concept as a technical term to describe both the interpenetration of the divine and human natures of Christ and the relationship between the hypostases of the Trinity.

 effectively excludes the idea that God has parts, but rather is a simple being. It also harmonizes well with the doctrine that the Christian&#x27;s union with the Son in his humanity brings him into union with one who contains in himself, in Paul&#x27;s words, &quot;all the fullness of deity&quot; and not a part. provides an intuitive figure of what this might mean. The Son, the eternal Word, is from all eternity the dwelling place of God; he is the &quot;Father&#x27;s house&quot;, just as the Son dwells in the Father and the Spirit; so that, when the Spirit is &quot;given&quot;, then it happens as Jesus said, &quot;I will not leave you as orphans; for I will come to you.&quot;

=== Economic and immanent Trinity ===
The term &quot;immanent Trinity&quot; focuses on who God is; the term &quot;economic Trinity&quot; focuses on what God does. According to the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;,

The ancient Nicene theologians argued that everything the Trinity does is done by Father, Son, and Spirit working in unity with one will. The three persons of the Trinity always work inseparably, for their work is always the work of the one God. The Son&#x27;s will cannot be different from the Father&#x27;s because it is the Father&#x27;s. They have but one will as they have but one being. Otherwise they would not be one God. On this point St. Basil said:

According to Thomas Aquinas the Son prayed to the Father, became a minor to the angels, became incarnate, obeyed the Father as to his human nature; as to his divine nature the Son remained God: &quot;Thus, then, the fact that the Father glorifies, raises up, and exalts the Son does not show that the Son is less than the Father, except in His human nature. For, in the divine nature by which He is equal to the Father, the power of the Father and the Son is the same and their operation is the same.&quot; Aquinas stated that the mystery of the Son cannot be explicitly believed to be true without faith in the Trinity (&quot;ST&quot; IIa IIae, 2.7 resp. and 8 resp.).
Athanasius of Alexandria explained that the Son is eternally one in being with the Father, temporally and voluntarily subordinate in his incarnate ministry. Such human traits, he argued, were not to be read back into the eternal Trinity. Likewise, the Cappadocian Fathers also insisted there was no economic inequality present within the Trinity. As Basil wrote: &quot;We perceive the operation of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to be one and the same, in no respect showing differences or variation; from this identity of operation we necessarily infer the unity of nature.&quot;

The traditional theory of &quot;appropriation&quot; consists in attributing certain names, qualities, or operations to one of the Persons of the Trinity, not, however, to the exclusion of the others, but in preference to the others. This theory was established by the Latin Fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries, especially by Hilary of Poitiers, Augustine, and Leo the Great. In the Middle Ages, the theory was systematically taught by the Schoolmen such as Bonaventure.

=== Trinity and love ===
Augustine &quot;coupled the doctrine of the Trinity with anthropology. Proceeding from the idea that humans are created by God according to the divine image, he attempted to explain the mystery of the Trinity by uncovering traces of the Trinity in the human personality&quot;. The first key of his exegesis is an interpersonal analogy of mutual love. In (399–419) he wrote,

The Bible reveals it although only in the two neighboring verses 1 John 4:8.16, therefore one must ask if love itself is triune. Augustine found that it is, and consists of &quot;three: the lover, the beloved, and the love.&quot;

Reaffirming the theopaschite formula (meaning &quot;One of the Trinity suffered in the flesh&quot;), Thomas Aquinas wrote that Jesus suffered and died as to his human nature, as to his divine nature he could not suffer or die. &quot;But the commandment to suffer clearly pertains to the Son only in His human nature. ... And the way in which Christ was raised up is like the way He suffered and died, that is, in the flesh. For it says in 1 Peter (4:1): &#x27;Christ having suffered in the flesh&#x27; ... then, the fact that the Father glorifies, raises up, and exalts the Son does not show that the Son is less than the Father, except in His human nature. For, in the divine nature by which He is equal to the Father.&quot;

In the 1900s the recovery of a substantially different formula of theopaschism took place: at least (meaning &quot;not only in the flesh&quot;). More specifically, World War II had an impact not only on the theodicy of Judaism with the Holocaust theology, but also on that of Christianity with a profound rethinking of its dogmatic theology. Deeply affected by the atomic bombs event, as early as 1946 the Lutheran theologian Kazoh Kitamori published &quot;Theology of the Pain of God&quot;, a theology of the Cross pushed up to the immanent Trinity. This concept was later taken by both Reformed and Catholic theology: in 1971 by Jürgen Moltmann&#x27;s &quot;The Crucified God&quot;; in the 1972 &quot;Preface to the Second Edition&quot; of his 1969 German book (English translation: ) by Hans Urs von Balthasar, who took a cue from Revelation 13:8 (Vulgate: , NIV: &quot;the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world&quot;) to explore the &quot;God is love&quot; idea as an &quot;eternal super-kenosis&quot;. In the words of von Balthasar: &quot;At this point, where the subject undergoing the &#x27;hour&#x27; is the Son speaking with the Father, the controversial &#x27;Theopaschist formula&#x27; has its proper place: &#x27;One of the Trinity has suffered.&#x27; The formula can already be found in Gregory Nazianzen: &#x27;We needed a ... crucified God&#x27;.&quot; But if theopaschism indicates only a Christological kenosis (or kenotic Christology), instead von Balthasar supports a Trinitarian kenosis: &quot;The persons of the Trinity constitute themselves as who they are through the very act of pouring themselves out for each other&quot;. This allows to clearly distinguish his idea from Subordinationism.

Furthermore, following the concepts developed by Scholasticism, the underlying question is whether the three Persons of the Trinity can experience self-love (), as well as whether for them, with the conciliar dogmatic formulation in terms that today we would call ontotheological, it is possible for aseity () to be valid. If the Father is not the Son or the Spirit since the generator/begetter is not the generated/begotten nor the generation/generative process and vice versa, and since the lover is neither the beloved nor the love dynamic between them and vice versa, Christianity has provided as a response a concept of divine ontology and love different from common sense (omniscience, omnipotence, omnibenevolence, impassibility, etc.): an oblative, sacrificial, martyrizing, crucifying, precisely kenotic concept.

=== Trinity and will ===
Benjamin B. Warfield saw a principle of subordination in the &quot;modes of operation&quot; of the Trinity, but was also hesitant to ascribe the same to the &quot;modes of subsistence&quot; in relation of one to another. While noting that it is natural to see a subordination in function as reflecting a similar subordination in substance, he suggests that this might be the result of &quot;an agreement by Persons of the Trinity – a &#x27;Covenant&#x27; as it is technically called – by virtue of which a distinct function in the work of redemption is assumed by each.&quot;

=== Trinity and Christian apologetics ===
Today, several analogies for the Trinity abound. The comparison is sometimes made between the triune God and H2O. Just as H2O can come in three distinct forms (liquid, solid, gas), so God appears as Father, Son, Spirit. The mathematical analogy, &quot;1+1+1=3, but 1x1x1=1&quot; is also used to explain the Trinity.

=== Political aspect ===
According to Eusebius, Constantine suggested the term at the Council of Nicaea, though most scholars have doubted that Constantine had such knowledge and have thought that most likely Hosius had suggested the term to him. Constantine later changed his view about the Arians, who opposed the Nicene formula, and supported the bishops who rejected the formula, as did several of his successors, the first emperor to be baptized in the Nicene faith being Theodosius the Great, emperor from 379 to 395.

=== Incomprehensibility ===
Christians confess that the Trinity is fundamentally incomprehensible, and thus Christian confessions tend to maintain the doctrine as it is revealed in Scripture, but do not attempt to exhaustively analyse it or set forth its essence comprehensively, as Louis Berkhof describes in his &quot;Systematic Theology&quot;.

== Models of the Trinity ==
Although all trinitarians agree that there exists one God in three persons, trinitarian theologians have differed with each other on how to explain the workings and relations of the persons of the trinity. Among the trinitarian topics which have been debated by trinitarian theologians throughout history are the eternal generation of the Son, the functional subordination of the Son, the eternal procession of the Spirit, the Filioque and the ontological subordination of the persons of the trinity.

The doctrine of eternal generation is defined as a necessary and eternal act of God the Father, in which he generates (or begets) God the Son through communicating the whole divine essence to the Son. Generation is not defined as an act of the will, but is by necessity of nature. This doctrine has been affirmed by the Athanasian creed, the Nicene creed and by church fathers such as Athanasius of Alexandria, Augustine, Basil of Caesarea being mentioned explicitly first by Origen of Alexandria. Those who teach the traditional doctrine of eternal generation have often used biblical texts such as Proverbs 8:23, Psalm 2:7, Micah 5:2, John 5:26, John 1:18, 3:16, Colossians 1:15, 2 Corinthians 4:4 and Hebrews 1:3 to establish their understanding of eternal generation. However, some modern theologians reject the doctrines of eternal generation and procession, disputing the idea that these texts teach the doctrine of eternal generation. Among theologians to reject eternal generation, William Lane Craig has argued that it introduces subordinationism into the trinity.

=== Social Trinitarianism ===
Among modern trinitarian debates, the issue of social trinitarianism is often discussed. Although social trinitarianism is a diverse theological movement, many of its advocates argue that each of the persons of the trinity are to be defined as three centers of consciousness with each having their own individual volitions. This is in contrast to what is often called &quot;classical trinitarianism&quot; due to its association with many classical theologians such as Augustine, which instead distinguishes the persons by their eternal relations of begetting and procession.

== Nontrinitarian Christian beliefs ==

Nontrinitarianism (or antitrinitarianism) refers to Christian belief systems that reject the doctrine of the Trinity as found in the Nicene Creed as not having a scriptural origin. Nontrinitarian views differ widely on the nature of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Various nontrinitarian views, such as Adoptionism, Monarchianism, and Arianism existed prior to the formal definition of the Trinity doctrine in AD 325, 360, and 431, at the Councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, and Ephesus, respectively. Following the adoption of trinitarianism at Constantinople in 381, Arianism was driven from the Empire, retaining a foothold amongst the Germanic tribes. When the Franks converted to Catholicism in 496, however, it gradually faded out. Nontrinitarianism was later renewed in the Gnosticism of the Cathars in the 11th through 13th centuries, in the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century, and in some groups arising during the Second Great Awakening of the 19th century.

Arianism was condemned as heretical by the First Council of Nicaea and, lastly, with Sabellianism by the Second Ecumenical Council (Constantinople, 381 CE). Adoptionism was declared as heretical by the Ecumenical Council of Frankfurt, convened by the Emperor Charlemagne in 794 for the Latin West Church.

Modern nontrinitarian groups or denominations include Christadelphians, Christian Science, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Dawn Bible Students, Iglesia ni Cristo, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Living Church of God, Members Church of God International, Oneness Pentecostals, La Luz del Mundo, the Seventh Day Church of God, Unitarian Christians, United Church of God, and The Shepherd&#x27;s Chapel.

As pointed out by Jonathan Israel, the 17th Century Dutch Republic was more religiously tolerant than other European countries of the time, but its dominant Calvinist Church drew the line at groups who denied the Trinity; this was considered an intolerable aberration, and such groups were subject to various forms of persecution in the Netherlands.

John William Colenso argued that the Book of Enoch implies a Trinitarian-esque view of God, seeing the &quot;Lord of the spirits&quot;, the &quot;Elected one&quot; and the &quot;Divine power&quot; each partaking of the name of God.

== Other religions&#x27; views ==
=== Judaism ===
Judaism maintains a tradition of monotheism that excludes the possibility of a Trinity. In Judaism, God is understood to be the absolute one, indivisible, and incomparable being which is the ultimate cause of all existence.

Some Kabbalist writings have a Trinitarian-esque view of God, speaking of &quot;stages of God&#x27;s being, aspects of the divine personality&quot;, with God being &quot;three hidden lights, which constitute one essence and one root&quot;. Some Jewish philosophers additionally saw God as a &quot;thinker, thinking and thought&quot;, taking from Augustinian analogies. The Zohar additionally says that &quot;God is they, and they are it&quot;.

Philo of Alexandria recognized a threefold character of God, but had many differences from the Christian view of the Trinity. 

=== Islam ===
Islam considers Jesus to be a prophet, but not divine, and God to be absolutely indivisible (a concept known as ). Several verses of the Quran state that the doctrine of the Trinity is blasphemous.

Interpretation of these verses by modern scholars has been varied. Verse 5:73 has been interpreted as a potential criticism of Syriac literature that references Jesus as &quot;the third of three&quot; and thus an attack on the view that Christ was divine. Another interpretation is that this passage should be studied from a rhetorical perspective; so as not to be an error, but an intentional misrepresentation of the doctrine of the Trinity in order to demonstrate its absurdity from an Islamic perspective. David Thomas states that verse 5:116 need not be seen as describing actually professed beliefs, but rather, giving examples of &quot;shirk&quot; (claiming divinity for beings other than God) and a &quot;warning against excessive devotion to Jesus and extravagant veneration of Mary, a reminder linked to the central theme of the Qur&#x27;an that there is only one God and He alone is to be worshipped.&quot; When read in this light, it can be understood as an admonition, &quot;Against the divinization of Jesus that is given elsewhere in the Qur&#x27;an and a warning against the virtual divinization of Mary in the declaration of the fifth-century church councils that she is &#x27;God-bearer&#x27;.&quot; Similarly, Gabriel Reynolds, Sidney Griffith and Mun&#x27;im Sirry argue that this Quranic verse is to be understood as an intentional caricature and rhetorical statement to warn from the dangers of deifiying Jesus or Mary.

== Artistic depictions ==

The Trinity is most commonly seen in Christian art with the Spirit represented by a dove, as specified in the Gospel accounts of the Baptism of Christ; he is nearly always shown with wings outspread. However depictions using three human figures appear occasionally in most periods of art.

The Father and the Son are usually differentiated by age, and later by dress, but this too is not always the case. The usual depiction of the Father as an older man with a white beard may derive from the biblical Ancient of Days, which is often cited in defense of this sometimes controversial representation. However, in Eastern Orthodoxy the Ancient of Days is usually understood to be God the Son, not God the Father (&quot;see below&quot;)—early Byzantine images show Christ as the Ancient of Days, but this iconography became rare. When the Father is depicted in art, he is sometimes shown with a halo shaped like an equilateral triangle, instead of a circle. The Son is often shown at the Father&#x27;s right hand (Acts 7:56). He may be represented by a symbol—typically the Lamb () or a cross—or on a crucifix, so that the Father is the only human figure shown at full size. In early medieval art, the Father may be represented by a hand appearing from a cloud in a blessing gesture, for example in scenes of the Baptism of Christ. Later, in the West, the Throne of Mercy (or &quot;Throne of Grace&quot;) became a common depiction. In this style, the Father (sometimes seated on a throne) is shown supporting either a crucifix or, later, a slumped crucified Son, similar to the Pietà (this type is distinguished in German as the ), in his outstretched arms, while the Dove hovers above or in between them. This subject continued to be popular until the 18th century at least.

By the end of the 15th century, larger representations, other than the Throne of Mercy, became effectively standardised, showing an older figure in plain robes for the Father, Christ with his torso partly bare to display the wounds of his Passion, and the dove above or around them. In earlier representations both Father, especially, and Son often wear elaborate robes and crowns. Sometimes the Father alone wears a crown, or even a papal tiara.

In the later part of the Christian Era, in Renaissance European iconography, the Eye of Providence began to be used as an explicit image of the Christian Trinity and associated with the concept of Divine Providence. Seventeenth-century depictions of the Eye of Providence sometimes show it surrounded by clouds or sunbursts.

== In architecture ==

Many Christian churches have three doors symbolizing the trinity. Other architectural features, such as windows or steps, are also grouped into three for this reason. This practice originated in spolia churches that were built from, and on top of, the remains of ancient pre-Christian holy structures.

Examples are the three royal doors inside of Eastern churches and the trio of doors in the façade of many cathedrals. A triangular floor plan can also symbolize the trinity, as in Heiligen-Geist-Kapelle in Austria.

== In literature ==
The Trinity has traditionally been a subject matter of strictly theological works focused on proving the doctrine of the Trinity and defending it against its critics. In recent years, however, the Trinity has made an entrance into the world of (Christian) literature through books such as &quot;The Shack&quot;, published in 2007 and &quot;The Trinity Story&quot;, published in 2021.

<doc id="30512" wikidata="Q590196" url="?curid=30512" title="The Ridgeway">
<text>The Ridgeway is a ridgeway or ancient trackway described as Britain&#x27;s oldest road. The section clearly identified as an ancient trackway extends from Wiltshire along the chalk ridge of the Berkshire Downs to the River Thames at the Goring Gap, part of the Icknield Way which ran, not always on the ridge, from Salisbury Plain to East Anglia. The route was adapted and extended as a National Trail, created in 1972. The Ridgeway National Trail follows the ancient Ridgeway from Overton Hill, near Avebury, to Streatley, then follows footpaths and parts of the ancient Icknield Way through the Chiltern Hills to Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire. The National Trail is long.

==History==
For at least 5,000 years travellers have used the Ridgeway. The Ridgeway provided a reliable trading route to the Dorset coast and to the Wash in Norfolk. The high dry ground made travel easy and provided a measure of protection by giving traders a commanding view, warning against potential attacks. The Bronze Age saw the development of the Uffington White Horse and the stone circle at Avebury. During the Iron Age, inhabitants took advantage of the high ground by building hillforts along the Ridgeway to help defend the trading route. Following the collapse of Roman authority in Western Europe, invading Saxon and Viking armies used it. In medieval times and later, the Ridgeway found use by drovers, moving their livestock from the West Country and Wales to markets in the Home Counties and London. Before the inclosure acts of 1750, the Ridgeway existed as an informal series of tracks across the chalk downs, chosen by travellers based on path conditions. Once enclosures started, the current path developed through the building of earth banks and the planting of hedges.

==National Trail==
The idea for a long-distance path along the line of the Wessex Downs and Chilterns goes back to the Hobhouse Committee of 1947. The present route was designated by the Government in 1972, and opened as a National Trail in 1973.

One of fifteen long-distance National Trails in England and Wales, the Ridgeway travels for northeast from Overton Hill within the Avebury World Heritage Site to Ivinghoe Beacon near Tring. At Marlborough it meets the Wessex Ridgeway, a footpath opened in 1994 which follows the southwest section of the ancient track into Dorset, as far as Lyme Regis. At Ivinghoe Beacon the Ridgeway meets the Icknield Way Path which continues northeast towards Suffolk. The Ridgeway meets the more recent (1997) Thames Path National Trail at the Goring Gap, where the trails use opposite banks of the River Thames between Goring-on-Thames and Mongewell; the Thames Path follows the western bank and the Ridgeway the eastern.

The total height climbed along the path is . The official guide to the trail divides The Ridgeway into six sections. It is possible to join or leave the trail at other locations with public transport links, including Avebury, Swindon, Wantage, Wallingford, Princes Risborough and Tring.

The Ridgeway is one of four long-distance footpaths that combine to run from Lyme Regis to Hunstanton, collectively referred to as the Greater Ridgeway or Greater Icknield Way.

The Ridgeway passes near many Neolithic, Iron Age and Bronze Age sites including Avebury Stone Circle; Barbury Castle, Liddington Castle, Uffington Castle, Segsbury Castle, Pulpit Hill and Ivinghoe Beacon Hill, all Iron Age and Bronze Age hill forts; Wayland&#x27;s Smithy, a Neolithic chieftain burial tomb; the Uffington White Horse, an ancient chalk horse carved into the hillside near Uffington Castle; and Grim&#x27;s Ditch, a section of earthwork near Mongewell created by Iron Age peoples as a possible demarcation line. Other points of interest include the Blowing Stone and Victory Drive, the private drive of Chequers (the British Prime Minister&#x27;s country retreat).

The Ridgeway&#x27;s surface varies from chalk-rutted farm paths and green lanes (which have a propensity for becoming extremely muddy and pot-holed after rain) to small sections of metalled roads. Designated as a bridleway (shared with horses and bicycles) for much of its length, the Ridgeway also includes parts designated as byway, which permits the use of motorised vehicles. Local restrictions along many byway sections limit the use of motorised vehicles to the summer months. Under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, many public rights of way in England and Wales that authorities had not explicitly classified as bridleways or byways defaulted to the classification &quot;restricted byway&quot; which precludes the use of motor vehicles at all times, except authorised vehicles and where required for access. As a result, much of the Ridgeway remains prohibited to motor vehicle use by the general public year-round. However, the Ridgeway is the only means of access for many farms, especially in the more remote parts of the Downs.
In 2024 the Ridgeway National Trail comprised of public footpath, of public bridleway, of byway (much of which has seasonal restrictions on motor vehicles), of restricted byway (all in Oxfordshire and Berkshire) and of public road. The of the Trail to the west of the River Thames has no sections of public footpath and is therefore open along its entire length to cyclists and those on horseback. The remaining of National Trail to the east of the River Thames contains the of public footpath in many noncontiguous parts, making it impractical for cyclists and those on horseback to follow this half of the Trail. The Ridgeway Partnership is currently in the process of creating a Ridgeway Riding Route. 

Despite the Ridgeway&#x27;s artificial creation, the TV programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; featured it in 2005 as one of the wonders of the South.

<doc id="30513" wikidata="Q214418" url="?curid=30513" title="The Bangles">
<text>The Bangles are an American all-female pop rock band formed in Los Angeles, in 1981. They are known for hit singles during the 1980s that made them one of the most successful pop rock groups of the decade. The band’s biggest commercial successes include &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian&quot; (1986), which became a worldwide phenomenon, &quot;Manic Monday&quot; (1986), a song written by Prince, and a cover of Simon &amp; Garfunkel’s &quot;Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; (1987), which was featured in the film &quot;Less Than Zero&quot;. Their ballad &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; (1989) became a big hit, topping the charts in several countries and is one of their signature songs. Other hits included &quot;In Your Room&quot; (1988) and &quot;If She Knew What She Wants&quot; (1986).

Formed by Susanna Hoffs and sisters Vicki Peterson and Debbi Peterson, the group began as part of the Paisley Underground scene, a Los Angeles music movement heavily influenced by 1960s rock and psychedelic music. Their early work blended jangly guitar melodies with power-pop sensibilities. The original lineup included Hoffs (guitar and vocals), Vicki Peterson (guitar and vocals), Debbi Peterson (drums and vocals), and Annette Zilinskas (bass). After Zilinskas left in 1983 to focus on other projects, Michael Steele, formerly of The Runaways, joined as bassist and vocalist, cementing the classic lineup.

Their 1984 debut album, &quot;All Over the Place&quot;, received critical acclaim and earned the group a loyal following, setting the stage for their commercial breakthrough with the 1986 album &quot;Different Light&quot;. The success of &quot;Different Light&quot; established the Bangles as one of the top female-fronted acts of the 1980s. 

After their third album, &quot;Everything&quot; (1988), and the success of &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;, the band struggled with internal tensions, and disbanded in 1989. However, they reunited in the late 1990s, recording new material and performing live. In 2018, founding bassist Annette Zilinskas rejoined the group.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1981–1983)===

Susanna Hoffs and sisters Vicki and Debbi Peterson had each been in bands before coming together in Los Angeles, California, in December 1980. The impetus was two classified advertisements in the weekly paper &quot;The Recycler&quot;. One had been placed by Hoffs, and the only person to respond was Annette Zilinskas, and the other was by Lynn Elkind, the Petersons&#x27; housemate and a departing member of their then band Those Girls. When Hoffs called in response to Elkind&#x27;s ad, Vicki Peterson answered the phone, and in their conversation, they discovered a great deal of common interests.

When Hoffs spoke to Elkind after Peterson gave her the message, Hoffs and Elkind did not have the same common interests and Hoffs then formed a new band with the Petersons. The Those Girls bass guitarist, Vicki Peterson&#x27;s lifelong best friend Amanda Hills, had also left the band (now a history professor, Amanda Hills Podany has performed as a guest with the Bangles on a few rare occasions) and this left an opening for Zilinskas. When Annette Zilinskas responded to the ad in &quot;The Recycler&quot;, Hoffs told Zilinskas that the band was looking for a bass player and asked if she would be interested. Zilinskas accepted and the lineup was set. The resulting (and also current as of 2018) lineup first performed as the Colours in 1981.

Shortly afterward, the group renamed themselves the Bangs. The band was part of the Los Angeles Paisley Underground scene, which featured groups that played a mixture of 1960s-influenced rock. In 1981, Hoffs and the Petersons recorded and released a single (&quot;Getting Out of Hand&quot; with &quot;Call on Me&quot; on the B side) on DownKiddie Records (their own label). The Bangs were signed to Faulty Products, a label formed by Miles Copeland.

The early Bangles lineup of Susanna Hoffs (vocals/guitars), Vicki Peterson (guitars/vocals), Debbi Peterson (vocals/drums) and Annette Zilinskas (vocals/bass) recorded an EP in 1982 and released the single &quot;The Real World&quot;. For the release of the EP, they played in the Lhasa club in Hollywood. At the last minute, they discovered another band had registered the Bangs name and would not let them use it without payment. In the meantime, Hoffs and Vicki Peterson appeared on a 1983 album Rainy Day (also the name of the group) which also featured members of Rain Parade, The Dream Syndicate and The Three O&#x27;Clock. The album was released in 1984 on Llama Records (E1024), and featured Hoffs on lead vocals on cover versions of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep It with Mine&quot; and Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&quot;. 

Their first EP was retitled &quot;Bangles&quot; and released. In 1983, Faulty Products issued a 12-inch &quot;remix&quot; single of &quot;The Real World&quot; to radio and media, but another setback came as the label folded. I.R.S. Records picked up distribution and reissued the EP. After Zilinskas left the band to focus on her own project Blood on the Saddle, she was replaced by Michael Steele, formerly of the all-female band the Runaways, Toni &amp; the Movers, Slow Children and Elton Duck.

===Career peak (1984–1989)===

The Bangles&#x27; full-length debut album on Columbia Records, &quot;All Over the Place&quot; (1984), captured their power pop roots, featuring the singles &quot;Hero Takes a Fall&quot; and the Kimberley Rew-penned Beatlesque &quot;Going Down to Liverpool&quot; (originally recorded by Rew&#x27;s band Katrina and the Waves). The record received positive reviews and the video for &quot;Liverpool&quot; featured Leonard Nimoy, which helped to generate further publicity. This came about through a friendship between the Hoffs and Nimoy families. They received a much wider audience serving as the opening act for Cyndi Lauper on her Fun Tour.

All this went some way to attracting the attention of Prince, who gave them &quot;Manic Monday&quot; originally written for his group Apollonia 6. &quot;Manic Monday&quot; went on to become a number-two hit in the US, the UK and Germany, outsold at the time only by another Prince composition, his own &quot;Kiss&quot;. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Different Light&quot; (January 1986), was more polished than its predecessor, and with the help of the worldwide number-one hit &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian&quot; (written by Liam Sternberg), put the band firmly in the mainstream, reaching number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

The song was sent to them in midsession and the group was divided about whether it would be a failure or a success. When the song was released, the group was amazed to discover that it brought them a new audience of female fans, most of them very young. Commented Michael Steele to a &quot;Nine-O-One Network Magazine&quot; writer: &quot;When I go out now it is usually girls who recognize me.&quot; Three additional hit singles released from the &quot;Different Light&quot; album were: &quot;Following&quot; (top 40 in Ireland), &quot;Walking Down Your Street&quot; (number 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100) and the wistful &quot;If She Knew What She Wants&quot;, written and first recorded by Jules Shear (which reached 29 on the Hot 100 in the summer of 1986 and was in the German top 20 for 13 weeks).

The band had another hit with a cover of Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;A Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; (1987) from the soundtrack of the film &quot;Less than Zero&quot;. The song reached number 2 in February 1988.

The album &quot;Everything&quot; (1988) was produced by Davitt Sigerson, as the band had a negative reaction to working with David Kahne on &quot;Different Light&quot;. It was another multiplatinum hit and included the top-five hit &quot;In Your Room&quot;, as well as their biggest-selling single &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;. Co-writer Billy Steinberg came up with the title after Hoffs told him about the band&#x27;s recent trip to Memphis, Tennessee, where they visited Graceland, Elvis Presley&#x27;s estate. An eternal flame is maintained at Presley&#x27;s grave, but it had gone out on the day of their visit, and its clear plastic enclosure was flooded. They asked what was in the box and were told, &quot;That&#x27;s the eternal flame.&quot;

The single became their biggest worldwide hit and the biggest single by an all-female band in history. Hoffs was naked when she recorded the song, convinced by Sigerson that Olivia Newton-John got her amazing performances by recording everything naked. Hoffs said she felt it was like &#x27;skinny dipping&#x27; and recorded most of the rest of the album naked.

===Disbandment (1989)===
Friction arose among band members after music industry media began singling out Hoffs as the lead singer of the group. In fact, singing duties on the band&#x27;s albums were divided among the band&#x27;s members, each of whom wrote or co-wrote songs. The band broke up in 1989.

Hoffs began a solo career and Vicki Peterson toured as a member of the Continental Drifters and as a fill-in member of the Go-Go&#x27;s. Michael Steele joined a band that did not last long called Crash Wisdom, in which she performed songs such as &quot;Nickel Romeo&quot; and &quot;Between the Two&quot; which both would later be used for the Bangles&#x27;s 2003 reunion album &quot;Doll Revolution&quot;.

===Re-formation (1998–present)===
The band started drifting back together in 1998, and officially re-formed to record a song for the soundtrack of &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;, at the behest of the film&#x27;s director Jay Roach (who had married Hoffs in 1993). The song chosen for the album was &quot;Get the Girl&quot; and was released in 1999. The reunion continued with a tour in 2000. Later the same year, the group was also inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. From 2001 to 2002, they were in the studio recording the album &quot;Doll Revolution&quot; at Icon Recording Studios, Hollywood, California. The album, featuring such songs as &quot;Stealing Rosemary&quot;, &quot;Ride the Ride&quot;, &quot;Nickel Romeo&quot;, and the single &quot;Something That You Said&quot;, was released in early 2003.

The title track, which was written by Elvis Costello, was originally recorded for his 2002 album &quot;When I Was Cruel&quot;. &quot;Doll Revolution&quot; was a solid comeback success in Germany after the Bangles had performed in Germany&#x27;s biggest television show &quot;Wetten dass&quot;, but failed to make any impact in other markets such as the UK, the U.S. and Australia. In July 2004, Paul McCartney presented the Bangles with &quot;honorary rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll diplomas&quot; from his Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts.

In 2005, Michael Steele left the band due to disputes over touring and recording. Steele was replaced by touring bassist Abby Travis for live appearances. On December 31, 2005, the group performed &quot;Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; in front of Times Square and later &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; as part of &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve 2006&quot;. Travis was fired in 2008.

In the spring of 2009, the Bangles returned to the studio to begin work on a new album entitled &quot;Sweetheart of the Sun&quot;, which was released on September 27, 2011. The band went on tour in late 2011 in support of it, with dates on the East Coast, Midwest and West Coast. Openers for the various dates included rock band Antigone Rising and power pop band A Fragile Tomorrow.

In December 2013, the Bangles played two nights with three other reunited Paisley Underground bands—the Dream Syndicate, the Three O&#x27;Clock and Rain Parade—at the Fillmore in San Francisco and the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles (benefit concert). Their set list focused on their early material, with remarks from the band at the beginning of the Fillmore show that they were going to be playing songs that they had not played in 30 years. In January 2014, they performed at the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood, California, in celebration of the Whisky&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

Original bassist Annette Zilinskas began joining the band for selected live shows in 2014 and rejoined the band in 2018. This was the first time the original founding four members of the Bangles had played together since 1983.

Three new recordings by the Bangles were released in November 2018 as part of a compilation album called &quot;3 × 4&quot;, which also included the Dream Syndicate, the Three O&#x27;Clock and Rain Parade, with each of the four bands covering songs by the other bands. Following the initial Record Store Day first-release as a double album on &quot;psychedelic swirl&quot; purple vinyl, Yep Roc Records released the album on LP, CD and digital in February 2019. All four of these bands assembled to play at the Grammy Museum in May 2019.

<text>The Pogues are an English or Anglo-Irish Celtic punk band founded in King&#x27;s Cross, London, in 1982, by Shane MacGowan, Spider Stacy and Jem Finer. Originally named Pogue Mahone—an anglicisation by James Joyce of the Irish phrase &quot;póg mo thóin&quot;, meaning &quot;kiss my arse&quot;—the band fused Irish traditional music with punk rock influences. Initially poorly received in traditional circles—folk musician Tommy Makem labelled the band &quot;the greatest disaster ever to hit Irish music&quot;—they were later credited with reinvigorating the genre.

After their founding, the Pogues added more members, including James Fearnley and Cait O&#x27;Riordain, and built a reputation playing raucous live shows in London pubs and clubs. After opening for the Clash on their 1984 tour, they released their first studio album, &quot;Red Roses for Me&quot;, featuring a mix of traditional Irish songs and original compositions by MacGowan. Elvis Costello produced their second album, &quot;Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash&quot; (1985), and the follow-up four-track EP &quot;Poguetry in Motion&quot; (1986). The Pogues collaborated with the Dubliners on a 1987 arrangement of the traditional folk song &quot;The Irish Rover&quot;, which reached number one in Ireland and number eight in the UK. Later that year, they released the Christmas single &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;, which reached number one in Ireland and number two in the UK. Written by MacGowan and Finer and recorded as a duet with Kirsty MacColl, it features on their critically acclaimed and commercially successful third studio album, &quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot; (1988). The Pogues recorded two more albums with MacGowan—&quot;Peace and Love&quot; (1989) and &quot;Hell&#x27;s Ditch&quot; (1990)—before sacking him during a 1991 tour as his drug and alcohol dependency increasingly affected their live performances. 

MacGowan went on to form a new band, Shane MacGowan and the Popes, while the Pogues continued with Joe Strummer and then Stacy as frontmen, releasing new material on &quot;Waiting for Herb&quot; (1993). They broke up following the critical and commercial failure of their seventh and last studio album, &quot;Pogue Mahone&quot; (1996). The Pogues, again including MacGowan, re-formed in late 2001. Although they recorded no new studio material, they toured regularly in the UK and Ireland, also performing in the USA and mainland Europe. Following the death of longtime guitarist Philip Chevron in October 2013, the Pogues dissolved again in the summer of 2014. Longtime bassist Darryl Hunt died in August 2022 and MacGowan died in November 2023. Surviving members Stacy, Finer and Fearnley re-formed the Pogues in 2024 and will tour the UK and Ireland in 2025.

== Band history ==
=== Pre-Pogues years: 1977–1982 ===
The future members of the Pogues first met when MacGowan (vocals), Peter &quot;Spider&quot; Stacy (tin whistle), and Jem Finer (banjo) were together in an occasional band called The Millwall Chainsaws in the late 1970s after MacGowan and Stacy met in the toilets at a Ramones gig at The Roundhouse in London in 1977. MacGowan was already with The Nips, though when they broke up in 1980 he concentrated more on Stacy&#x27;s Millwall Chainsaws, who changed their name to The New Republicans.. Shane and Stacy performed their first gig as The New Republicans at Richard Strange&#x27;s Cabaret Futura in London&#x27;s Rupert Street Soho in the early months of 1981. Also on the bill that night were Soft Cell.

=== Early years: 1982–1986 ===
In 1982, MacGowan, Stacy and Finer formed the band, then known as Pogue Mahone. James Fearnley, who had been a guitarist with The Nips, joined shortly afterward. Fearnley has noted that Stacy suggested the band&#x27;s original name, taken from a sentence in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, where the character Buck Mulligan exclaims: &quot;&quot;Pogue mahone! Acushla machree!&quot; It’s destroyed we are from this day! It’s destroyed we are surely!&quot; &quot;Pogue mahone&quot; is an anglicisation of the Irish phrase &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;kiss my arse&quot;. The new group played their first gig at The Pindar of Wakefield on 4 October 1982.

By their show on Friday 29 October 1982 at 100 Club in London, Cait O&#x27;Riordan (bass) and John Hasler (drums) had joined the band, with Andrew Ranken replacing Hasler on drums in March 1983. Pogue Mahone appeared on Thursday 3 November 1983 at Gossips in Dean Street Soho with Trash Trash Trash and The Stingrays.

The band played London pubs and clubs, and released a single, &quot;Dark Streets of London&quot;, on their own, self-named label, gaining a small reputation – especially for their live performances, and national airplay on BBC Radio 1, primarily on David Jensen&#x27;s evening show. They came to the attention of the media and Stiff Records when they opened for The Clash on their 1984 tour. Following 
complaints from a producer at BBC Radio Scotland about the band&#x27;s name, Jensen began referring to the band on air as &quot;The Pogues&quot;, which the band subsequently adopted as their name. They released their first album, &quot;Red Roses for Me&quot;, on Stiff Records that October.

The band gained more attention when the UK Channel 4&#x27;s music show &quot;The Tube&quot; made a video of their version of &quot;Waxie&#x27;s Dargle&quot; for the show. The performance, featuring Spider Stacy repeatedly smashing himself over the head with a beer tray, became a favourite with the viewers, but Stiff Records refused to release it as a single, feeling it was too late for it to help &quot;Red Roses for Me&quot;. Nevertheless, it remained a favourite request for the show for many years.

With the aid of producer Elvis Costello, they recorded the follow-up, &quot;Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash&quot;, in 1985 during which time guitarist Philip Chevron joined. The album title is a famous comment falsely attributed to Winston Churchill who was supposedly describing the &quot;true&quot; traditions of the British Royal Navy. The album cover featured &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;, with the faces of the characters in Théodore Géricault&#x27;s painting replaced with those of the band members. The album shows the band moving away from covers to original material. Shane MacGowan came into his own as a songwriter with this disc, offering up poetic storytelling, such as &quot;The Sick Bed of Cúchulainn&quot; and &quot;The Old Main Drag&quot;, as well as definitive interpretations of Ewan MacColl&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Old Town&quot; and Eric Bogle&#x27;s &quot;And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot; (this had previously been covered by Shane&#x27;s fellow punk contemporaries Skids in 1981).

The band failed to take advantage of the momentum created by the strong artistic and commercial success of their second album. They first refused to record another album (offering up the four-track EP &quot;Poguetry in Motion&quot; instead); O&#x27;Riordan married Costello and left the band, to be replaced by bassist Darryl Hunt, formerly of Plummet Airlines and Pride of the Cross; and they added a multi-instrumentalist in Terry Woods, formerly of Steeleye Span. Looming over the band at this period (as throughout their entire career) was the increasingly erratic behaviour of their vocalist and principal songwriter, Shane MacGowan. Their record label, Stiff Records, went bankrupt soon after the 1987 release of the single &quot;The Irish Rover&quot; (with The Dubliners). Members of the band, including O&#x27;Riordan, acted in Alex Cox&#x27;s &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;, and five songs by the band were included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album.

=== Mainstream success and break-up: 1987–1996 ===
The band remained stable enough to record &quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot; with its Christmas hit duet with Kirsty MacColl &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;. &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; was released as a single in 1987 and reached No. 1 in the Irish charts and No. 2 in the British charts over Christmas (the time of peak sales). The song has become a festive classic in the UK and Ireland over the years, and was voted the best Christmas song of all time three years running in 2004, 2005, and 2006 in polls by music channel VH1 UK, despite not achieving Christmas Number One when it was released. It was also voted as the 27th greatest song never to reach UK#1 in another VH1 poll, and also voted as the 84th greatest song of all time by BBC Radio 2 listeners in the &quot;Sold on Song&quot; top 100 poll. In 2007 the record was briefly censored by the BBC because of the word &quot;faggot&quot; being deemed potentially offensive to homosexual people. Following protests from listeners, including the mother of Kirsty MacColl, the censorship was lifted.

In 1989, the band released &quot;Peace and Love&quot;, a jazzier record featuring six tracks written by MacGowan, as well as eight tracks written by band members Jem Finer, Terry Woods, Andrew Ranken, and Philip Chevron. As Mark Deming wrote in AllMusic, &quot;It does make clear that MacGowan was hardly the only talented songwriter in the band – though the fact that the set&#x27;s most memorable songs were written by others did not bode well for the group&#x27;s future.&quot;

The band was at the peak of its commercial success, with both albums making the top 5 in the UK (numbers 3 and 5 respectively), but MacGowan was increasingly unreliable. He failed to turn up for the opening dates of their 1988 tour of America, and prevented the band from promoting their 1990 album &quot;Hell&#x27;s Ditch&quot;, so in 1991 the band sacked him following a chaotic live performance at the WOMAD Festival held in Japan. Vocal duties were for a time handled by Joe Strummer. Spider Stacy took over permanently after Strummer left in the winter of 1991. After Strummer&#x27;s departure, the remaining seven Pogues recorded in 1993 &quot;Waiting for Herb&quot;, which contained the band&#x27;s third and final top twenty single, &quot;Tuesday Morning&quot; which was written and sung by Spider Stacy.

Terry Woods and James Fearnley subsequently left the band and were replaced by David Coulter and James McNally respectively. Within months of their departures, ill health forced Phil Chevron to leave the band; he was replaced by his former guitar technician, Jamie Clarke. This line-up recorded the band&#x27;s seventh and final studio album, &quot;Pogue Mahone&quot;. The album was a commercial failure, and, following Jem Finer&#x27;s decision to leave the band in 1996, the remaining members decided it was time to quit. According to Shane MacGowan, among the reasons of the break-up was disagreement concerning the political orientation of his songs, the band not wanting to sing too obvious pro-Republican songs – though some of their previous songs were already politically engaged: for instance, &quot;Streams of Whiskey&quot; is about the poet and IRA member Brendan Behan. Soon after the break-up Shane MacGowan recorded a song titled &quot;Paddy Public Enemy Number One&quot; as a tribute to the Republican leader Dominic McGlinchey, a former leader of the INLA killed a few years before.

=== Post-breakup ===
After the Pogues&#x27;s break-up, the three remaining long-term members (Spider Stacy, Andrew Ranken and Darryl Hunt) played together briefly as The Vendettas. They played mainly new Stacy-penned tracks, though Darryl Hunt also contributed songs, and the band&#x27;s live set included a few Pogues songs. First Ranken then Hunt left the band, the latter going on to become singer/songwriter in an indie band called Bish, whose self-titled debut album was released in 2001. Ranken later performed with a number of other bands, including Kippers, The Municipal Waterboard and, most recently, The Mysterious Wheels. In addition to The Vendettas, who Stacy freely admits lost all attraction when the Pogues reformed, Spider continued to write and record music with various bands, including the James Walbourne, Filthy Thieving Bastards, Dropkick Murphys and Astral Social Club.

Shane MacGowan founded Shane MacGowan and The Popes in 1992. They released two studio albums and broke up in 2006 once The Pogues&#x27; reunion had become official. His autobiography &quot;A Drink With Shane MacGowan&quot;, co-written with his journalist girlfriend Victoria Mary Clarke, was released in 2001. Jem Finer went into experimental music, playing a big part in a project known as &quot;Longplayer&quot;, a piece of music designed to play continuously for 1,000 years without repeating itself. In 2005, Finer released the album &quot;Bum Steer&quot; with DB Bob (as DM Bob and Country Jem).

James Fearnley moved to the United States shortly before leaving the Pogues. He was a member of The Low And Sweet Orchestra and later the Cranky George Trio. Philip Chevron reformed his former band The Radiators, which briefly included former Pogue Cait O&#x27;Riordan. Terry Woods formed The Bucks with Ron Kavana, releasing the album &quot;Dancin&#x27; To The Ceili Band&quot; in 1994. Later, he formed The Woods Band, releasing the album &quot;Music From The Four Corners of Hell&quot; in 2002.

=== Reunion: 2001–2014 ===

The band, including MacGowan, re-formed for a Christmas tour in 2001 and performed nine shows in the UK and Ireland in December 2004. In 2002 &quot;Q&quot; magazine named the Pogues one of the &quot;50 Bands To See Before You Die&quot;. In July 2005, the band – again including MacGowan – played at the annual Guilfest festival in Guildford before flying out to Japan where they played three dates. Japan is the last place they all played together before MacGowan was originally sacked in 1991, and they have a strong following there.

The band played a date in Spain in September 2005. The reunited Pogues played dates in the UK with support from the Dropkick Murphys in late 2005, and re-released their 1987 Christmas classic &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; on 19 December, which went straight in at No. 3 in the UK Singles charts on Christmas Day 2005, showing the song&#x27;s enduring popularity. On 22 December 2005 the BBC broadcast a live performance (recorded the previous week) on the Jonathan Ross Christmas show with Katie Melua filling in for the late Kirsty MacColl, the first time the band had played the song live on television. The following week they performed live on the music show &quot;&quot;.

Shane MacGowan wrote an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2006, detailing his thoughts on the current tour.

The band was awarded the lifetime achievement award at the annual Meteor Ireland Music Awards in February 2006. In March 2006, the band played their first US dates with Shane in over 15 years. The band played a series of sold-out concerts in Washington, D.C., Atlantic City, Boston, and New York. Later they played a series of sold-out gigs during mid-October 2006 in San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles, and toured Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham, London, Dublin, and Nottingham in mid-December 2006. They began a second US tour in March 2007, once again to coincide (and conclude) with a Roseland Ballroom New York City show on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. 2007 proved to be their most prolific year of touring since the reunion with a tour of the west coast of America and eleven dates in the UK in December. The band also made festival appearances in the summer across Europe (Sweden, Belgium and Spain).

Guitarist Phil Chevron has stated there were no plans to record new music or release a new album. Chevron said that one way to keep enjoying what they were doing was to avoid making a new album, although he did say that there still is a possibility in the future for new music, but certainly not in the near future. Terry Woods has commented that MacGowan has been writing, and most of it sounds good. In 2008 the band released a box set &quot;Just Look Them Straight in the Eye and Say...POGUE MAHONE!!&quot;, which included rare studio outtakes and previously unreleased material.

The band received mixed reviews of their performances though they continued to pull the crowds. Reviewing a March 2008 concert, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described MacGowan as &quot;puffy and paunchy,&quot; but said the singer &quot;still has a banshee wail to beat Howard Dean&#x27;s, and the singer&#x27;s abrasive growl is all a band this marvelous needs to give its amphetamine-spiked take on Irish folk a focal point&quot;. The reviewer continued: &quot;The set started off shaky, MacGowan singing of &#x27;goin&#x27; where streams of whiskey are flowin,&#x27; and looking like he&#x27;d arrived there already. He grew more lucid and powerful as the evening gathered steam, through two hours and 26 songs, mostly from the Pogues&#x27; first three (and best) albums&quot;. In December 2010 the Pogues (with support from Crowns) played what was billed as a farewell UK Christmas tour.

In March 2011, the Pogues played a six-city/ten-show sold out US tour titled &quot;A Parting Glass with The Pogues&quot; visiting Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Boston, and New York City (in that order), with only the last three cities getting more than one show. Stacy said &quot;I think we are basically pretty certain this is the last tour of this type we&#x27;ll be doing in the States. There might be the odd sort of one-off here and there. We&#x27;re not saying this is absolutely, definitely the end&quot;.

In August 2012, the Pogues embarked on a 30th Anniversary Summer 2012 8-city European Tour scheduled from 4 August 2012 at the Stockton Weekender Festival in Stockton-on-Tees, UK to 11 and 12 September 2012 at L&#x27;Olympia, Paris, two shows filmed and recorded for a live album and DVD released on 19 November 2012.

In March 2013, the Pogues released &quot;30:30: The Essential Collection&quot;, a 2-disc set featuring 30 songs along with eleven videos. In October 2013, the Pogues released a box set titled &quot;Pogues 30&quot; containing remastered versions of all of their studio albums plus a previously unreleased live album featuring Joe Strummer at the London Forum in December 1991.

Guitarist Philip Chevron died on 8 October 2013 in Dublin, Ireland from oesophageal cancer, aged 56.

In December 2013, the Pogues went on a four-date UK Christmas tour, followed by a few shows during spring and summer 2014. The Pogues&#x27; last performance on British soil occurred on 6 July 2014 at the British Summer Time festival in London&#x27;s Hyde Park. The Pogues&#x27; last ever performance (to date) occurred on 9 August 2014 during the &quot;Fête du bruit dans Landerneau&quot; festival in Landerneau, Brittany, France.

=== Post-split: 2014–2024 ===

In a December 2015 interview with &quot;Vice&quot; magazine, when asked whether the band were still active, Shane MacGowan said: &quot;We&#x27;re not, no&quot;, saying that, since their 2001 reunion happened, &quot;I went back with [the] Pogues and we grew to hate each other all over again&quot;, adding, &quot;I don&#x27;t hate the band at all – they&#x27;re friends. I like them a lot. We were friends for years before we joined the band. We just got a bit sick of each other. We&#x27;re friends as long as we don&#x27;t tour together. I&#x27;ve done a hell of a lot of touring. I&#x27;ve had enough of it&quot;.

Long-time Pogues bassist Darryl Hunt died in London on 8 August 2022, at the age of 72.

Shane MacGowan died in Dublin on 30 November 2023, at the age of 65. The band&#x27;s surviving members reunited to perform &quot;The Parting Glass&quot; at his funeral on 8 December 2023. Following the death of MacGowan, &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; went to No. 1 in Ireland on 1 December 2023. On 13 December 2023, the Pogues reissued &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; as a charity 7-inch single in tribute to MacGowan and to benefit the Dublin Simon Community, an organization fighting homelessness that MacGowan had supported.

=== Second reunion: 2024–present ===

On 3 May 2024, surviving members Finer, Fearnley and Stacy performed Pogues songs with a variety of guest musicians on vocals at Hackney Empire, London, to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of &quot;Red Roses for Me&quot;. The re-formed band subsequently announced that they would be touring the UK and Ireland in 2025 to mark the fortieth anniversary of their second album, &quot;Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash&quot;.

<text>The Big Country is a 1958 American epic Western film directed by William Wyler, starring Gregory Peck, Jean Simmons, Carroll Baker, Charlton Heston, and Charles Bickford. The supporting cast features Burl Ives and Chuck Connors. Filmed in Technicolor and Technirama, the picture was based on the serialized magazine novel &quot;Ambush at Blanco Canyon&quot; by Donald Hamilton and was co-produced by Wyler and Peck. The opening title sequence was created by Saul Bass.

Burl Ives won the Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor for his performance, as well as the Golden Globe Award. The film was also nominated for an Academy Award for the musical score, composed by Jerome Moross. The film is one of the few in which Heston plays a major supporting role rather than the lead.

==Plot==
Former sea captain James McKay travels to the American West to join his fiancée Patricia at the enormous ranch owned by her father, Henry &quot;The Major&quot; Terrill. After a meeting with Patricia&#x27;s friend, schoolteacher Julie Maragon, McKay and Patricia are accosted by a group of drunks led by Buck Hannassey, the son of the Major&#x27;s ardent and implacable enemy Rufus Hannassey − with whom he&#x27;s had a longstanding feud over water access for cattle. In spite of the harassment and mockery, McKay surprises Patricia by making light of the incident and stating that he&#x27;s experienced worse and the boys meant no harm, they were just drunk.

The next morning, McKay declines an invitation from the Major&#x27;s foreman Steve Leech to ride an indomitable bronco stallion named &quot;Old Thunder&quot;. McKay then brings a pair of dueling pistols once owned by his father to the Major as a gift. When the Major learns of Buck&#x27;s pestering of his daughter and future son-in-law, he gathers his men and goes to raid the Hannassey ranch, despite McKay&#x27;s attempts to defuse the situation. The Major&#x27;s group of twenty men finds neither Rufus nor Buck, so they settle for terrorizing the Hannassey women and children, shooting holes in the Hannassey water reservoir. They find Buck&#x27;s posse in town and proceed to beat and humiliate three of them. Meanwhile, McKay privately tames and rides Old Thunder after many unsuccessful attempts and swears his only witness, the ranch hand Ramon, to secrecy.

A gala is held on the Terrill ranch in honor of Patricia&#x27;s upcoming wedding. At the height of the festivities, an armed Rufus crashes the party and accuses the Major of the hypocrisy of pretending to be a gentleman when his actions speak otherwise. The next day, McKay secretly goes to Maragon&#x27;s abandoned ranch, known as the &quot;Big Muddy&quot;, the property at the center of the Terrill-Hannassey dispute. With the only river nearby running through it, access is vital for both herds during times of drought. McKay persuades Maragon to sell the ranch to him in the hopes of both securing a gift for Patricia and ending the conflict by continuing Maragon&#x27;s policy of unrestricted access to the river. McKay shows up at the camp of the Terrill search party led by Leech sent out to find the presumed lost McKay.

Upon returning to Ladder Ranch, Leech calls McKay a liar when McKay explains he was never lost or in danger. Again McKay refuses to be goaded into a fight, which disappoints Patricia enough to make the pair reconsider their engagement. Before dawn and without an audience, McKay challenges Leech to a prolonged outdoor fistfight, which ends in a draw. In the morning, Maragon tells Patricia of McKay&#x27;s purchase of the Big Muddy as a wedding gift for her, which initially convinces her to attempt to make amends with McKay. When she learns of McKay&#x27;s plan to allow the Hannasseys equal access to the water, she leaves for good.

Wanting to lure the Major into an ambush in the canyon leading to his homestead, Rufus takes Maragon hostage. Although McKay personally promises Rufus equal access to the water, he finds himself in a clash with Buck, which is ultimately settled with a shootout using the old dueling pistols. Buck fires before the signal, his bullet grazing McKay&#x27;s forehead − and leaving him open to be shot by McKay. Buck crawls under a wagon in a display of cowardice that convinces McKay to spare him. The frustrated Buck snatches another gun from a nearby cowboy, forcing Rufus to kill his own son. Rufus then goes to the canyon for a final confrontation with the Major and challenges him to a one-on-one showdown. Armed with rifles, the two old men advance and kill one another.

With that, the hostilities end, and McKay and Julie, clearly falling in love, ride off together with Ramon to start a new life together.

==Cast==
==Production==

Robert Wyler and Jessamyn West wrote the first screenplay for the film based on the Donald Hamilton story that had been serialized in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Leon Uris wrote a second screenplay and Robert Wilder wrote another, with the final script by James R. Webb and Sy Bartlett. After arbitration, Webb, Bartlett and Wilder received screenplay credit and Wyler and West received adaptation credit. Uris was not given credit as his script deviated too much from the original story.

Director William Wyler was known for shooting an excessive number of takes on his films, usually without explaining to the actors what to do differently except &quot;[make it] better&quot;, and this one was no exception. Many of the actors, including Jean Simmons and Carroll Baker, were so traumatized by his directing style that they refused to speak about the experience for years. Simmons later said they constantly received rewrites for the script, making acting extremely difficult. Gregory Peck and Wyler, who were good friends, fought constantly on the set and had a falling out for three years, although they later reconciled. Wyler and Charles Bickford also clashed, as they had done 30 years previously on the production of his 1929 film &quot;Hell&#x27;s Heroes&quot;. Burl Ives, however, claimed to have enjoyed making the film.

Before principal photography was complete, Wyler left for Rome to start work on &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, delegating creation of the final scenes involving McKay and Maragon to his assistant Robert Swink, whose resulting scenes pleased Wyler so much that he wrote Swink a letter stating: &quot;I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how pleased I am with the new ending... The shots you made are complete perfection.&quot;

===Locations===
The Blanco Canyon scenes were filmed in California&#x27;s Red Rock Canyon State Park in the Mojave Desert. The ranch and field scenes with greenery were filmed in the Sierra Nevada foothills near the town of Farmington in central California. Today Snow Ranch, a working cattle ranch, is also used during the winter months (of lower fire risk) by a club of the National Association of Rocketry for launches of model and mid- and high-power amateur rockets.

==Reception==
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in a negative review, &quot;for all this film&#x27;s mighty pretensions, it does not get far beneath the skin of its conventional Western situation and its stock Western characters. It skims across standard complications and ends on a platitude. Peace is a pious precept, but fightin&#x27; is more excitin&#x27;. That&#x27;s what it proves.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;one of the best photography jobs of the year&quot;, with a &quot;serviceable, adult&quot; storyline &quot;which should find favor with audiences of all tastes.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; declared it &quot;a first-rate super-Western, beautifully photographed in the Technirama anamorphic process and Technicolor. It is a long picture, perhaps too long for what the story has to offer, but there is never a dull moment from start to finish and it holds one&#x27;s interest tightly throughout.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;super stuff. Franz Planer&#x27;s photography of Texas is downright awe-inspiring, the characters are solid, the story line firm, the playing first-rate, the music more than dashing in this nearly three-hour tale which should delight everybody.&quot;

John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;Of those involved in this massive enterprise, Mr. Bickford and Mr. Ives are the most commendable as they whoop and snort about the sagebrush. But even they are hardly credible types, and as for the rest of the cast, they can be set down as a rather wooden lot.&quot; Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;too self consciously &#x27;epical&#x27; to be called great, but at its best, which is frequently, it&#x27;s better than good.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that the picture&#x27;s attempts to convey a message were for the most part &quot;superficial and pedestrian,&quot; and found that &quot;the pivotal character of McKay, played on a monotonously self-righteous note by Gregory Peck, never comes alive. It is mainly due to the power of the climactic canyon battle, and Burl Ives&#x27; interesting playing as Rufus, that this remains a not unsympathetic film, decorated pleasantly by Jean Simmons and with spirit by Carroll Baker.&quot;

The film was a big hit, being the second-most popular movie in Britain in 1959. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower liked the movie so much, he screened it on four successive evenings in the White House during his second administration.

Playmobil designed an entire cowboy line based on the architecture of the film.

In a poll of 500 films held by &quot;Empire&quot;, it was voted 187th-greatest movie of all time.

==Accolades==
Ives won the Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor, as well as a Golden Globe Award. The film was also nominated for an Academy Award for the musical score by Jerome Moross.

==Preservation==
The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;The Big Country&quot; in 2006.

==Comic book==

A comic-book adaptation of the novel and tie-in to the movie was first released in 1957.

<doc id="30516" wikidata="Q743137" url="?curid=30516" title="The Associates (band)">
<text>The Associates (or simply Associates) were a Scottish post-punk and pop band, formed in Dundee in 1979 by lead vocalist Billy Mackenzie and guitarist Alan Rankine. The band released an unauthorized cover version of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; as their debut single in 1979, which landed them a recording contract with Fiction Records. They followed with their debut studio album &quot;The Affectionate Punch&quot; in 1980 and the compilation album &quot;Fourth Drawer Down&quot; in 1981, both to critical praise.

They achieved commercial success in 1982 with the UK Top 10 studio album &quot;Sulk&quot; and UK Top 20 singles &quot;Party Fears Two&quot; and &quot;Club Country&quot;, during which time they were associated with the New Pop movement. Rankine left the group that year, leaving MacKenzie to record under the Associates name until 1990. They briefly reunited in 1993. MacKenzie&#x27;s suicide in 1997 was the band&#x27;s end; Rankine died twenty-six years later in 2023. 

==History==
===1979–1982: Formation and independent success===
Billy Mackenzie and guitarist Alan Rankine met in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1976 and formed the cabaret duo the Ascorbic Ones, although Rankine claimed that this was &quot;a fantasy band that Bill and I dreamt up to give ourselves a past&quot;. In 1978, they recorded songs as Mental Torture before changing the name to the Associates.

Disappointed that their early recordings were not getting picked up, MacKenzie concocted the stunt of doing a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot;, without copyright permission, just six weeks after Bowie&#x27;s version hit the UK Top 10. Released in June 1979, this debut Associates single reached No. 15 in &quot;Record Mirror&quot;″s Scottish chart and gained them airplay on John Peel&#x27;s Radio One show. MacKenzie later said that the band recorded the Bowie song &quot;to prove the point. It was a strange way of proving it, but it worked. People said, &#x27;That is &quot;awful&quot;. How dare they!&#x27;&quot; The ensuing attention earned them a contract with Fiction Records, and their debut album, &quot;The Affectionate Punch&quot;, followed on 1 August 1980. By this time the duo of MacKenzie and Rankine had been joined by bassist Michael Dempsey and drummer John Murphy, though in most promotional material the group were still marketed as a duo.

A string of 1981 non-album singles on the label Situation Two were compiled as &quot;Fourth Drawer Down&quot;, released that October. These releases saw the band develop an interest in experimenting with unorthodox instrumentation and recording techniques, including sounds being amplified through the tube of a vacuum cleaner on the track &quot;Kitchen Person&quot;. Also in 1981, Rankine and MacKenzie released a version of &quot;Kites&quot; under the name 39 Lyon Street, with Christine Beveridge on lead vocals. The B-side, &quot;A Girl Named Property&quot; (a remake of &quot;Mona Property Girl&quot; from the &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; single), was credited to the Associates.

===1982–1988: WEA/Warner years===
As Situation Two&#x27;s parent label Beggars Banquet had a labels deal with WEA International at the time (primarily for Gary Numan), the Associates found themselves signed to Warner with their releases now going out on their own Associates record label. The band&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1982 with the release of the single &quot;Party Fears Two&quot;. Buoyed along by the popularity of synthpop at the time, the song reached No. 9 on the UK Singles Chart with the band becoming one of the leading acts of the new pop movement. Two other hits followed, &quot;Club Country&quot; and &quot;18 Carat Love Affair&quot;, a vocal version of the instrumental track &quot;Nothinginsomethingparticular&quot;. On 14 May 1982, the band released their most commercially successful album, &quot;Sulk&quot;. Martha Ladly, of Martha and the Muffins, contributed backing vocals and keyboards to this album.

Rankine left the band in 1982 just before the &quot;Sulk&quot; tour. This proved disastrous for the band&#x27;s career; the band was being courted by Seymour Stein of Sire Records, but without MacKenzie&#x27;s willingness to tour, Stein lost interest. MacKenzie continued to write and record music under the name Associates until 1990. In 1985 the album &quot;Perhaps&quot; was released and charted at No. 23 in the UK Albums Chart.

In 1988, WEA/Warner rejected the fourth Associates album &quot;The Glamour Chase&quot; considering it not commercially viable (it was later released on a two-disc set with &quot;Perhaps&quot;). However, they decided to release MacKenzie&#x27;s synthpop/techno-pop cover of &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; as a single and also put the track on the record company&#x27;s &quot;Vaultage From The Electric Lighting Station&quot; compilation. This track was to be MacKenzie&#x27;s last release whilst under contract to WEA in the United Kingdom, as he signed to AVL/Virgin subsidiary Circa Records (still under the Associates name at this point). &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; was released in September 1988 on a number of formats including a 12 inch single with an anaglyphic 3-D cover (which came with 3-D glasses) and a CD single. It reached number 56 on the UK Singles Chart and was put on &quot;Popera: The Singles Collection&quot;, by WEA in 1990 alongside withdrawn follow-up single &quot;Country Boy&quot;, and a version of the MacKenzie/Boris Blank song, &quot;The Rhythm Divine&quot;.

Between 1987 and 1992, MacKenzie worked with Blank and musical partner Dieter Meier of Swiss avant-garde outfit Yello. MacKenzie wrote the lyrics of the song &quot;The Rhythm Divine&quot;, which can also be found on the Yello album, &quot;One Second&quot;, with lead vocals by Shirley Bassey and MacKenzie singing backing vocals. During these years MacKenzie contributed to three Yello albums: &quot;One Second&quot; (1987), &quot;Flag&quot; (1988) and &quot;Baby&quot; (1991), whilst tracks for &quot;The Glamour Chase&quot; and &quot;Outernational&quot; were recorded with Blank at Yello&#x27;s recording studio.

===1989–1997: Circa and solo years===
After his fourth album was rejected and &quot;Country Boy&quot; single scrapped, MacKenzie signed to AVL/Virgin subsidiary Circa Records, to release the fifth Associates album &quot;Wild and Lonely&quot; (the fourth studio album to be released during Billy MacKenzie&#x27;s lifetime). The album was released on 24 March 1990 and was produced by Australian record producer Julian Mendelsohn. It peaked at No. 71 on the UK Albums Chart and had three singles charting in the lower parts of the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Fire to Ice&quot; and &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Say Goodbye&quot;, peaking at numbers 81, 92 and 79 respectively. &quot;Wild and Lonely&quot; was the last album MacKenzie recorded under the name The Associates, as from this point his releases would go out under his own name. However, recordings were sporadic and subsequent records failed to reach the UK chart and sold far fewer than their/his early albums. In 1992, MacKenzie released an electronica-influenced solo album, &quot;Outernational&quot;, for Circa Records with limited success.

In 1993, MacKenzie and Rankine began working on new material together. News of an Associates revival generated hype and speculation of a tour, and the demos recorded by the two were promising. However, MacKenzie was not fully committed to the reunion and especially touring with it, so Associates split for a final time. MacKenzie went back to his solo work, signing a deal with Nude Records and finding a new collaborative partner in Steve Aungle.

Rankine later became a lecturer in music at Stow College in Glasgow, and worked with Belle and Sebastian on their 1996 debut album, &quot;Tigermilk&quot;.

===1997–present: Legacy releases===
MacKenzie committed suicide in 1997 at age 39, shortly after the death of his mother. He had been suffering from clinical depression. He was contemplating a comeback at the time with material co-written with Aungle. The albums &quot;Beyond the Sun&quot; (1997) and &quot;Eurocentric&quot; (2000) were released posthumously and, in 2004, reconstructed and expanded with new unreleased songs into the two albums &quot;Auchtermatic&quot; and &quot;Transmission Impossible&quot;.

Before MacKenzie&#x27;s death, almost all Associates records had been deleted. Former band member Michael Dempsey and the MacKenzie estate began a reissue programme to make sure the band&#x27;s legacy continued, reissuing almost every Associates album, including a 25th anniversary edition of &quot;The Affectionate Punch&quot; in 2005. In addition to the original albums, two compilation albums were released: &quot;Double Hipness&quot; (2000), a collection of early tracks with the 1993 reunion demos; and &quot;Singles&quot; (2004), an extended version of &quot;Popera – The Singles Collection&quot; which caught up with post-1990 material and included the cover of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot;. In 2002, &quot;The Glamour Chase&quot; (recorded in the years 1985–87) was finally released as a set titled &quot;The Glamour Chase &amp; Perhaps&quot;. Finally, &quot;Wild and Lonely&quot; and MacKenzie&#x27;s solo album &quot;Outernational&quot; were repackaged with bonus tracks in 2006.

The Tom Doyle book &quot;The Glamour Chase: The Maverick Life of Billy Mackenzie&quot;, first published in 1998 and reissued in 2011, documented the band&#x27;s career and MacKenzie&#x27;s subsequent life.

Rankine died on 3 January 2023 at age 64.

==Legacy and influence==
The Associates drew stylistically on a variety of genres, including art rock, disco, glam, minimalism, balladry and cabaret. Their music has been described as post-punk, synth-pop, new wave and experimental pop. The group was hailed by the likes of Björk and U2 singer Bono. Björk stated that her &quot;love affair with the Associates started when I was fifteen [...], it was &quot;Sulk&quot; I really got into&quot;. &quot;I really admired the way Billy used and manipulated his voice on that record&quot;. Bono said about the Associates: &quot;We ripped them off. Billy was a great singer: I couldn&#x27;t rip him off&quot;. Artists who have covered &quot;Party Fears Two&quot;, include the Divine Comedy, Dan Bryk, King Creosote and Heaven 17. Journalist Simon Reynolds, called the group &quot;great should-have-beens of British pop&quot;. Chris Tighe wrote that the band have &quot;been belated acknowledged as one of the &#x27;80s&#x27; most inspired pop groups&quot;.

Ian Rankin took the title of his 2015 Inspector Rebus novel, &quot;Even Dogs in the Wild&quot;, from a track on &quot;The Affectionate Punch&quot;, and the song itself has a role in the story.

Upon news of Rankine’s passing, Ladytron wrote on social media, &quot;No Associates = No Ladytron&quot; while saying that he was the &quot;creator of amongst the most joyous magnificent pop music of all time.&quot;

<text>The Stranglers are an English punk rock band. Scoring 23 UK top 40 singles and 20 UK top 40 albums to date in a career spanning five decades, the Stranglers are one of the longest-surviving bands to have originated in the UK punk scene.

Formed as the Guildford Stranglers in Guildford, Surrey, in early 1974, they originally built a following within the mid-1970s pub rock scene. While their aggressive, no-compromise attitude had them identified by the media with the emerging UK punk rock scene that followed, their idiosyncratic approach rarely followed any single musical genre, and the group went on to explore a variety of musical styles, from new wave, art rock and gothic rock through the sophisti-pop of some of their 1980s output. They had major mainstream success with their 1982 single &quot;Golden Brown&quot;. Their other hits include &quot;No More Heroes&quot;, &quot;Peaches&quot;, &quot;Always the Sun&quot;, &quot;Skin Deep&quot; and &quot;Big Thing Coming&quot;.

The Stranglers&#x27; early sound was driven by Jean-Jacques Burnel&#x27;s melodic bass, but also gave prominence to Dave Greenfield&#x27;s keyboards.
Their early music was also characterised by the growling vocals and sometimes misanthropic lyrics of both Burnel and Hugh Cornwell. Over time, their output gradually grew more refined and sophisticated. Summing up their contribution to popular music, critic Dave Thompson later wrote: &quot;From bad-mannered yobs to purveyors of supreme pop delicacies, the group was responsible for music that may have been ugly and might have been crude – but it was never, ever boring.&quot;

Greenfield died on 3 May 2020 after contracting COVID-19 while receiving treatment for a heart ailment. The remaining band members completed a new album recorded with Greenfield, &quot;Dark Matters&quot;, and confirmed that they would proceed with their &quot;Final Full UK Tour&quot;, initially announced in January 2020, in his honour.

==History==
===Formation and mainstream success (1974–1979)===
Prior to forming the band, Jet Black (Brian Duffy) had run various businesses, including a fleet of ice cream vans, and later ran The Jackpot, a Guildford off-licence that would serve as the base for the early Stranglers. Black had also been a semi-professional drummer in the late 1950s and early 1960s. After attaining a degree of financial stability due to his business successes, by 1974 he decided to return to drumming and assemble a band. The Stranglers came to be an influential band in the British punk and new wave scene of the mid-1970s. Black drove the ice cream vans that would serve as the Stranglers&#x27; early tour buses.

The group that eventually formed between 1974 and 1975 was originally named The Guildford Stranglers, but they soon dropped the geographical prefix and the name, &quot;The Stranglers&quot;, was registered as a business on 11 September 1974 by Black. The other original personnel were bass player/vocalist Jean-Jacques Burnel, guitarist/vocalist Hugh Cornwell and keyboardist/guitarist Hans Wärmling, who was replaced by keyboardist Dave Greenfield within a year. None of the band came from the Guildford area apart from Burnel, who was originally from Notting Hill but moved to Godalming during his childhood. Black is from Ilford, Cornwell from Kentish Town and Greenfield from Brighton, while Wärmling came from Gothenburg and returned there after leaving the band.

Cornwell was a blues musician before forming the band and had briefly been a bandmate of Richard Thompson, Burnel had been a classical guitarist who had performed with symphony orchestras, Black&#x27;s musical background was as a jazz drummer, and Greenfield had played at military bases in Germany. Their early influences included pre-punk psychedelic rock bands such as the Doors and the Music Machine.

From 1976 the Stranglers became associated with the burgeoning punk rock movement, due in part to their opening for the first British tours of American punks the Ramones and Patti Smith. Notwithstanding this association, some of the movement&#x27;s champions in the British musical press viewed the band with suspicion on account of their age and musical virtuosity and the intellectual bent of some of their lyrics. However, Burnel was quoted saying, &quot;I thought of myself as part of punk at the time because we were inhabiting the same flora and fauna ... I would like to think the Stranglers were more punk plus and then some.&quot;

The band&#x27;s early albums, &quot;Rattus Norvegicus&quot;, &quot;No More Heroes&quot; and &quot;Black and White&quot;, all released within a period of 13 months, were highly successful with the record-buying public and singles such as &quot;Peaches&quot;, &quot;Something Better Change&quot; and &quot;No More Heroes&quot; became instant punk classics. Meanwhile, the band received a mixed reception from some critics because of their apparent sexist and racist innuendo. However, critic Dave Thompson argued that such criticism was oblivious to the satire and irony in the band&#x27;s music, writing: &quot;the Stranglers themselves revelled in an almost Monty Python-esque grasp of absurdity (and, in particular, the absurdities of modern &#x27;men&#x27;s talk&#x27;).&quot;
These albums went on to build a strong fan-following, but the group&#x27;s confrontational attitude towards the press was increasingly problematic and triggered a severe backlash when Burnel, a martial arts enthusiast, punched music journalist Jon Savage during a promotional event.

In February 1978 the Stranglers began a mini-tour, playing three secret pub gigs as a thank-you to those venues and their landlords for their support during the band&#x27;s rise to success. The first was at The Duke of Lancaster in New Barnet on Valentine&#x27;s Day, with further performances at The Red Cow, Hammersmith, and The Nashville Rooms, West Kensington, in early September.

During their appearance at the University of Surrey on the BBC TV programme &quot;Rock Goes to College&quot;, on 11 October 1978, and aired on the 19 October, the group walked off stage because an agreement to make tickets available to non-university students had not been honoured.

In the later half of the 1970s, the Stranglers toured Japan twice, joining the alternative music scene of Tokyo, which was evolving from the punk sound of Kyoto-based band Murahachibu (村八分, &quot;Ostracism&quot;), whose music influence spread to Tokyo in 1971. The Stranglers were the only foreign band to take part in a landmark scene focused around S-KEN Studio in Roppongi and The Loft venues in Shinjuku and Shimokitazawa from 1977 to 1979. The scene included bands such as Friction, and they became friends with the band Red Lizard, whom they invited back to London, where the band became known as Lizard. In 1979, while still in Japan, Burnel also became close friends with Keith, co-founder and drummer for ARB. At the end of 1983, ARB&#x27;s bassist was imprisoned, leaving the band with a problem for their forthcoming tour. Burnel took time out from the Stranglers to fly out to Japan at short notice and join ARB to cover the tour, including appearing at the All Japan Rock Festival at Hibaya park, becoming the first non-Japanese to ever appear at the festival. Burnel toured with ARB for five weeks and played on two studio tracks, &quot;Yellow Blood&quot; and &quot;Fight it Out&quot;, both of which appeared on the RCA Victor ARB album &quot;Yellow Blood&quot;.

===Second phase (1979–1982)===

In 1979, one of the Stranglers&#x27; two managers advised them to break up as he felt that the band had lost direction, but this idea was dismissed and they parted company with their management team. Meanwhile, Burnel released an experimental solo album &quot;Euroman Cometh&quot; backed by a small UK tour and Cornwell recorded the album &quot;Nosferatu&quot; in collaboration with Robert Williams. Later that year the Stranglers released &quot;The Raven&quot;, which had a more melodic and complex sound. The songs on &quot;The Raven&quot; are multi-layered and musically complicated, and deal with such subjects as a Viking&#x27;s lonely voyage, heroin addiction, genetic engineering, contemporary political events in Iran and Australia and extraterrestrial visitors, &quot;Meninblack&quot;. The Hohner Cembalet which saw prominent use on the previous three albums, was dropped and Oberheim synthesizers used instead whilst acoustic piano was used on &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Harry&quot;. A harmoniser was used to treat Burnel&#x27;s vocal on the track &quot;Meninblack&quot;, the recording of which led to Martin Rushent, who had produced their earlier albums, walking out, leaving the band to co-produce the album themselves with Alan Winstanley.
&quot;The Raven&quot; was not released in the US; instead a compilation album &quot;The Stranglers IV&quot; was released in 1980, containing a selection of tracks from &quot;The Raven&quot; and a mix of earlier and later non-album tracks. &quot;The Raven&quot; sold well, reaching No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart - it spawned one top 20 single, &quot;Duchess&quot;, with &quot;Nuclear Device&quot; reaching No. 36 and the EP &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Harry&quot; reaching No. 41. This was followed by a non-album single, &quot;Bear Cage&quot;, backed with &quot;Shah Shah a Go Go&quot; from &quot;The Raven&quot;. A 12-inch single, the band&#x27;s first, containing extended mixes of both tracks was also released; &quot;Bear Cage&quot; was No. 36 in the chart.

Following the success of the Stranglers&#x27; previous four albums they were given complete freedom for their next, &quot;The Gospel According to the Meninblack&quot;, a concept album exploring religion and the connection between religious phenomena and extraterrestrial visitors. It was preceded by a single &quot;Who Wants the World&quot;, which did not appear on the album, and just made the top 40. The album also included &quot;Waltzinblack&quot; which became adopted as a theme by TV chef Keith Floyd. &quot;The Gospel According to The Meninblack&quot; was different from their earlier work and alienated many fans. It peaked on the UK Albums Chart at No. 8, their lowest placing to date, and in 1981 was widely considered an artistic and commercial failure. The track &quot;Two Sunspots&quot; had been recorded during the &quot;Black And White&quot; sessions in 1978, but was shelved until 1980 when it was rediscovered and placed on &quot;The Gospel According to the Meninblack&quot;. The &quot;Meninblack&quot; track from &quot;The Raven&quot; is the &quot;Two Sunspots&quot; soundtrack slowed down.

&quot;La Folie&quot; (1981) was another concept album, this time exploring the subject of love. At first &quot;La Folie&quot; charted lower than any other Stranglers studio album, and the first single taken from it, &quot;Let Me Introduce You to the Family&quot;, only charted at No. 42. However, the next single was &quot;Golden Brown&quot;. The song is an evocative waltz-time ballad, with an extra beat in the fourth bar. Cornwell said the lyrics were &quot;about heroin and also about a girl. She was of Mediterranean origin and her skin was golden brown.&quot; It became their biggest hit, charting at No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart. It was also named as &quot;record of the week&quot; on BBC Radio 2, despite the station not previously playing music associated with the punk genre. It remains a radio staple to this day. Following this success, &quot;La Folie&quot; recharted at No. 11 in the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Tramp&quot; was originally thought to be the ideal follow-up single to &quot;Golden Brown&quot; but &quot;La Folie&quot; was chosen after Burnel convinced his bandmates of its potential. Sung in French, it received negligible airplay and charted at No. 47. Shortly afterwards the Stranglers left EMI. As part of their severance deal, the Stranglers were forced to release a greatest hits collection, &quot;The Collection 1977–1982&quot;. The track listing for &quot;The Collection 1977–1982&quot; included the new single &quot;Strange Little Girl&quot;, which had originally been recorded on a demo in 1974 and rejected by EMI. It became a hit, charting at No. 7 in July 1982 and providing royalties to Warmling through his co-writing credit.

===New label and sound (1983–1990)===

Following the Stranglers&#x27; return to commercial success, many record companies lined up to sign them. Virgin Records was the most likely choice but Epic Records made a last minute offer and secured the Stranglers&#x27; services. The Stranglers once again had complete artistic freedom and in 1983 released their first album for Epic, &quot;Feline&quot;, which included the UK No. 9 hit &quot;European Female&quot;. The album was another change in musical direction, this time influenced by European music. It was the first Stranglers album to feature acoustic guitars, and it was on this album that Jet Black began to use electronic drum kits. Hugh Cornwell stated, &quot;On &quot;La Folie&quot; there were three tracks – &#x27;Golden Brown&#x27; ... &#x27;La Folie&#x27; and &#x27;How to Find True Love and Happiness in the Present Day&#x27; – that sort of pointed us away from what we had been doing. It was strange doing those tracks, because we&#x27;d never really attempted that quite minimalistic recording technique. And when we started writing for &quot;Feline&quot;, things were coming out the same way.&quot; The album reached No. 4 in the UK chart in January 1983.

1984 saw the release of &quot;Aural Sculpture&quot; which consolidated the band&#x27;s success in Europe and established them in Oceania. It included the UK No. 15 hit &quot;Skin Deep&quot; (which also reached No. 11 in Australia, No. 19 in New Zealand and Top 30 in the Netherlands). This was their first album to feature the three-piece horn-section which was retained in all their subsequent albums and live performances until Cornwell&#x27;s departure in 1990. &quot;Aural Sculpture&quot; peaked at No. 14 in the UK Albums Chart in November 1984.

Their 1986 album, &quot;Dreamtime&quot;, dealt with environmental concerns among other issues. Its signature track, and another radio staple for many years to come, was &quot;Always the Sun&quot; (a No. 15 hit in France and No. 16 hit in Ireland, No. 21 in Australia, No. 30 in the UK and No. 42 in the Netherlands). The only Stranglers album to chart in the US, &quot;Dreamtime&quot; was a moderate hit in the UK, reaching No. 16 in November 1986.

The Stranglers&#x27; final album with Cornwell, &quot;10&quot;, was released in 1990. This was recorded with the intention of building on their &quot;cult&quot; status in America. Following the success of their cover of The Kinks&#x27; &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot;, a UK No. 7 hit in 1988, the Stranglers released another cover of a 1960s track, &quot;96 Tears&quot; as their first single from &quot;10&quot;; it reached No. 17 in the UK. The follow-up single &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; only reached No. 65. &quot;Man of the Earth&quot;, which the band had high hopes for, was due to be the third single from the album, but Epic Records decided against it. In August 1990, Hugh Cornwell left Stranglers to pursue a solo career, following the band&#x27;s failure to attain a tour in the US. In his autobiography, Cornwell stated that he felt that the Stranglers were a spent force creatively and cited various examples of his increasingly acrimonious relationship with his fellow band-members, particularly Burnel. Feelings were mutual; when Cornwell phoned Jet Black to say he was leaving the band, the drummer&#x27;s response was blunt &quot;OK, fine&quot;.

===Post-Cornwell era (1990s)===

Following the departure of Cornwell, CBS-Sony dropped the Stranglers from its roster. The remaining members recruited John Ellis, who had had a long-standing association with the band. He had opened for them in the 1970s as a member of The Vibrators, filled in for Cornwell during his time in prison for drug possession in 1980, worked with Burnel and Greenfield in their side-project Purple Helmets and been added to the Stranglers&#x27; line-up as a touring guitarist a short time before Cornwell&#x27;s departure. Burnel and Ellis briefly took over vocal duties (for one television appearance on &quot;The Word&quot;) before enlisting Paul Roberts, who sang on most songs live, even those originally sung by Burnel.

This line-up recorded four albums: &quot;Stranglers in the Night&quot; (1992), &quot;About Time&quot; (1995), &quot;Written in Red&quot; (1997) and &quot;Coup de Grace&quot; (1998).

===2000s resurgence and reversion to a four-piece===
In 2000, Ellis left the band and a new guitarist, Baz Warne, was recruited.

The Stranglers achieved something of a critical and popular renaissance in 2004 with the album &quot;Norfolk Coast&quot; and a subsequent sell-out tour, together with their first UK Top 40 hit (No. 31) in 14 years, &quot;Big Thing Coming&quot;. The album also included &quot;Tuckers Grave&quot; about a Somerset cider house named after the victim of a suicide in a nearby farm which members of the band now occupied. In 2005, &quot;Coast to Coast: Live on Tour&quot; was released; the live album contained songs recorded during their tour the previous year. On their UK tour they were supported by Goldblade.

In May 2006, Roberts left the band and the Stranglers were now back to a four-piece line-up: Burnel, Black, Greenfield and Warne, with the lead vocals shared between Warne and Burnel. In concert, Burnel returned to singing the songs he originally recorded as lead vocalist and Warne sang the numbers originally led by Hugh Cornwell.

&quot;Suite XVI&quot;, the follow-up album to &quot;Norfolk Coast&quot;, was released in September 2006 (the title is a pun on &quot;Sweet 16&quot; and also a reference to the fact that it was the band&#x27;s sixteenth studio album) and continued the band&#x27;s resurgence. Although partly a return to the band&#x27;s heavier punk roots, the album featured a typically idiosyncratic mixture of musical styles which included a country and western style Johnny Cash pastiche/homage &quot;I Hate You&quot;.

In 2007 it was reported that drummer Black was suffering from atrial fibrillation, an ailment which subsequently forced him to miss several shows, particularly where extended travel was required. On such occasions Ian Barnard, Black&#x27;s drum technician, deputised.

On 4 November 2007, the band (with Black) played a sell-out gig at the Roundhouse in Camden, North London, marking the 30th anniversary of their headline run at the same venue in 1977. The set list was the same as the 1977 concert, with the addition of a couple of more recent songs as a final encore. The event is recorded on the DVD &quot;Rattus at the Roundhouse&quot;.

===2010–present===
The Stranglers started 2010 with an extensive UK tour, including a sold-out return to the Hammersmith Apollo in March, their first visit there since 1987. They were supported on the 16-date UK tour by Max Raptor.

A double CD compilation album, &quot;Decades Apart&quot;, containing a selection of tracks from the full career of the band, including at least one from each of their 16 studio albums and two new tracks, &quot;Retro Rockets&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t See the World Like You Do&quot;, was released in February 2010. The download version of &quot;Decades Apart&quot; included an unreleased recording from 1978, &quot;Wasting Time&quot;, inspired by the band&#x27;s &quot;Rock Goes To College&quot; experience earlier that year; this track, originally titled &quot;Social Secs&quot;, was never released, and the music ended up being reversed and released as &quot;Yellowcake UF6&quot;, the B-side to &quot;Nuclear Device&quot; in 1979.

Across the summer the band played a number of festivals, including Weyfest and Glastonbury and T in the Park in the UK, Oxegen 2010 in Ireland and concerts in Japan, Greece, Poland, Slovakia and Bulgaria. The band also released a new live album and DVD, recorded at the Hammersmith Apollo in May 2010. In March 2011, the band completed another UK tour. Burnel&#x27;s long-term friend Wilko Johnson was invited to bring The Wilko Johnson band on the tour. In April, the band began touring Europe, with many gigs and major festivals lined up for the entire year.
On 23 September 2012, the band returned to Looe, Cornwall, fronted by Warne and Burnel. The band had originally spent time in Looe writing &quot;Suite XVI&quot;.

&quot;Giants&quot; was released in 2012. The &quot;deluxe&quot; version consisted of a second disc containing tracks from the &quot;Weekend in Black&quot; acoustic session in November 2011.

2013 saw the band play a full UK tour, with Black playing the second half at most gigs (Jim Macaulay taking the first half). Several festivals were booked for 2013, including a session at the BBC Proms on 12 August. For the North American tour Black was not present, with Macaulay playing the entire show.

In 2014, the band celebrated its 40th birthday with a Ruby Tour, throughout the UK and Europe. In 2015, the March On tour had 18 dates around the United Kingdom. Where stage space allowed, a second drum kit was set up and Jet Black appeared for a set of four songs. A proposed gig in Moscow was announced and then cancelled due to visa difficulties, but a mini-tour of the UK took place in July. The band then played gigs throughout Europe, ending in November. In April 2016, they returned to New Zealand and Australia.

Black ceased performing on stage with the band after some partial-set appearances in March 2015, although he remained an official member of the band until his retirement in 2018. Jim Macaulay appeared in a promotional photograph alongside Burnel, Greenfield and Warne for the first time in 2016 and has since been named as an official member of the group.

In August 2017, the Stranglers performed at an outdoor concert in Hull as part of the UK City of Culture celebrations. In July 2018, the band played at the LUNAR festival in Tanworth-in-Arden.

Greenfield died on 3 May 2020, at the age of 71. He had contracted COVID-19 while in hospital for a heart ailment. The band&#x27;s 18th studio album, &quot;Dark Matters&quot;, features contributions from Greenfield and is also their first release following the retirement of Black. It was released on 10 September 2021, and entered the UK Albums Chart at number 4, the highest position since &quot;Feline&quot; in 1983 and their first top 10 position since 1990.

In November 2021, the band began what was billed as their last full tour with their new keyboard player, Toby Hounsham, who played with Rialto, an English rock band formed in London in 1997, and subsequently Mungo Jerry for live and studio work since the early 2000s.

After many years of health problems, Black died on 6 December 2022 at the age of 84.

Although the band had billed their 2021 dates as their final UK tour, they continued to tour Europe in 2023. For 2024, a 50th Anniversary Tour was announced with dates in the UK and Europe.

==Legacy==
&quot;No More Heroes&quot; was featured in the first episode of the BBC fantasy crime drama series &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; and in the third episode of the second season of the American TV show &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;. The title was used for the 2007 video game &quot;No More Heroes&quot;, created by Japanese designer Goichi Suda, who is also a fan of the band. Despite the name, the cost of licensing the track prevented the song from appearing in the game. A cover version by Violent Femmes was used for the film &quot;Mystery Men&quot;.

The song &quot;Let me Down Easy&quot; was used as the opening credits theme for Hardcore Henry. &quot;Peaches&quot; appeared in the title sequence of &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; by director Jonathan Glazer and was used as the closing theme for many of Keith Floyd&#x27;s cooking programmes, with the instrumental track &#x27;Waltzinblack&#x27; providing the title music.

&quot;Golden Brown&quot; featured in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s film &quot;Snatch&quot; (2000), was used extensively in the Australian film &quot;He Died with a Felafel in His Hand&quot;. It also featured in the &quot;Black Mirror&quot; episode &quot;Metalhead&quot; and in Season 2 of &quot;The Umbrella Academy&quot;.

More songs by the Stranglers have been licensed for use in commercials than from any other punk band. &quot;Always The Sun&quot; was used for a tv and radio campaign by insurance company Sun Alliance in 1992 and 1993. &quot;Peaches&quot; has appeared on adverts for Adidas, HSBC, Tesco and JBL speakers while &quot;Waltzinblack&quot; has been used for Vodafone and the Carphone Warehouse. In 2002 &quot;Hanging Around&quot;, a track from the 1977 debut album &quot;Rattus Norvegicus&quot; which was never released as a single, was used in several French Wonderbra commercials featuring model Inna Zobova. &quot;Golden Brown&quot; was used to advertise Ore-Ida french fries and later used in Waitrose&#x27;s 2008 Christmas campaign.

Tori Amos covered &quot;Strange Little Girl&quot; on her 2001 &quot;Strange Little Girls&quot; album.

<text>Thomas Alan Waits (born December 7, 1949) is an American musician, composer, songwriter, and actor. His lyrics often focus on society&#x27;s underworld and are delivered in his trademark deep, gravelly voice. He began in the folk scene during the 1970s, but his music since the 1980s has reflected the influence of such diverse genres as rock, Delta blues, opera, vaudeville, cabaret, funk, hip hop and experimental techniques verging on industrial music. Per &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Waits &quot;has composed a body of work that&#x27;s at least comparable to any songwriter&#x27;s in pop today. A keen, sensitive and sympathetic chronicler of the adrift and downtrodden, Mr. Waits creates three-dimensional characters who, even in their confusion and despair, are capable of insight and startling points of view. Their stories are accompanied by music that&#x27;s unlike any other in pop history.&quot;

Tom Waits was born and raised in a middle-class family in Pomona, California. Inspired by the work of Bob Dylan and the Beat Generation, he began singing on the San Diego folk circuit. He relocated to Los Angeles in 1972, where he worked as a songwriter before signing a recording contract with Asylum Records. His first albums were the jazzy &quot;Closing Time&quot; (1973), &quot;The Heart of Saturday Night&quot; (1974) and &quot;Nighthawks at the Diner&quot; (1975), which reflected his lyrical interest in poverty, criminality and nightlife. He repeatedly toured the United States, Europe and Japan, and found greater critical and commercial success with &quot;Small Change&quot; (1976), &quot;Blue Valentine&quot; (1978) and &quot;Heartattack and Vine&quot; (1980). During this period, Waits entered the world of film, acting in &quot;Paradise Alley&quot; (1978), where he met a young story editor named Kathleen Brennan. He composed the soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;One from the Heart&quot; (1982) and made cameos in several subsequent Coppola films.

In 1980, Waits married Brennan, split from his manager and record label, and moved to New York City. With Brennan&#x27;s encouragement and frequent collaboration, he pursued a more eclectic and experimental sound influenced by Harry Partch and Captain Beefheart, as heard on the loose trilogy &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; (1983), &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; (1985) and &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot; (1987). Waits starred in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Down by Law&quot; (1986), lent his voice to his &quot;Mystery Train&quot; (1989), composed the soundtrack for his &quot;Night on Earth&quot; (1991) and appeared in his &quot;Coffee and Cigarettes&quot; (2003). He collaborated with Robert Wilson and William S. Burroughs on the &quot;cowboy opera&quot; &quot;The Black Rider&quot; (1990), the songs for which were released on the album &quot;The Black Rider&quot;. Waits and Wilson collaborated again on &quot;Alice&quot; (2002) and &quot;Woyzeck&quot; (2000). &quot;Bone Machine&quot; (1992) and &quot;Mule Variations&quot; (1999) won Grammys for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Contemporary Folk Album, respectively. In 2002, the songs from &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Wozzeck&quot; were recorded and released on the albums &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Blood Money&quot;. Waits went on to release &quot;Real Gone&quot; (2004), the compilation &quot;&quot; (2006), the live album &quot;Glitter and Doom Live&quot; (2009) and &quot;Bad as Me&quot; (2011).

Waits has influenced many artists and gained an international cult following. His songs have been covered by Bruce Springsteen, Tori Amos, Rod Stewart and the Eagles and he has written songs for Johnny Cash and Norah Jones, among others. In 2011, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Introducing him, Neil Young said: &quot;This next man is indescribable, and I&#x27;m here to describe him. He&#x27;s sort of a performer, singer, actor, magician, spirit guide, changeling... I think it&#x27;s great that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has recognized this immense talent. Could have been the Motion Picture Hall of Fame, could have been the Blues Hall of Fame, could have been the Performance Artist Hall of Fame, but it was the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that recognized the great Tom Waits.&quot; In accepting the award, Waits mused, &quot;They say that I have no hits and that I&#x27;m difficult to work with. And they say that like it&#x27;s a &quot;bad&quot; thing!&quot;

==Biography==
===Childhood and adolescence: 1949–1968===
Thomas Alan Waits was born on December 7, 1949, in Pomona, California. He has one older and one younger sister. His father, Jesse Frank Waits, was a Texas native of Scots-Irish descent, and his mother, Alma Fern (née Johnson), hailed from Oregon and had Norwegian ancestry. Alma, a regular church-goer, managed the household. Jesse taught Spanish at a local school and was an alcoholic; Waits later related that his father was &quot;a tough one, always an outsider.&quot; They lived at 318 North Pickering Avenue in Whittier, California. He recalled having a &quot;very middle-class&quot; upbringing and &quot;a pretty normal childhood&quot;. He attended Jordan Elementary School, where he was bullied. There, he learned to play the bugle and guitar. His father taught him to play the ukulele.

During the summers, he visited maternal relatives in Gridley and Marysville. He later recalled that it was an uncle&#x27;s raspy, gravelly timbre that inspired his own singing voice. In 1959, his parents separated and his father moved away from the family home, a traumatic experience for the 10-year-old Waits. Alma took her children and relocated to Chula Vista, a middle-class suburb of San Diego. Jesse visited the family there, taking his children on trips to Tijuana. In nearby Southeast San Diego, Waits attended O&#x27;Farrell Community School, where he fronted a school band, the Systems, which he described as &quot;white kids trying to get that Motown sound.&quot; He developed a love of R&amp;B and soul singers like Ray Charles and Wilson Pickett, as well as country music and Roy Orbison. Bob Dylan later became an inspiration; Waits placed transcriptions of Dylan&#x27;s lyrics on his bedroom walls.

Waits recalls: &quot;I was fifteen and I snuck into see Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins. Amazing show. Every time he opened his mouth he had that orchestra of gold teeth, and I was devastated ... He walked through a door, and slammed the door behind him, and on the door it said, I swear to God, &#x27;KEEP OUT. This room is for entertainers ONLY.&#x27; And I knew, at that moment, that I had to get into show business as soon as possible.&quot; He recalls: &quot;I first saw James Brown in 1962 at an outdoor theatre in San Diego and it was indescribable ... it was like putting a finger in a light socket ... It was really like seeing mass at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral on Christmas.&quot; By the time he was studying at Hilltop High School, he later related, he was &quot;kind of an amateur juvenile delinquent&quot;, interested in &quot;malicious mischief&quot; and breaking the law. He later described himself as a &quot;rebel against the rebels&quot;, eschewing the hippie subculture which was growing in popularity for the 1950s Beat generation, especially Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs. In 1968, at age 18, he dropped out of high school. He was an avid watcher of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. Another influence was the comedian Lenny Bruce.

Waits worked at Napoleone&#x27;s pizza restaurant in National City, California, and both there and at a local diner developed an interest in the lives of the patrons, writing down phrases and snippets of dialogue he overheard. He worked in the forestry service as a fireman for three years and served with the Coast Guard. He enrolled at Chula Vista&#x27;s Southwestern Community College to study photography, for a time considering a career in the field. He continued pursuing his musical interests, taking piano lessons. He began frequenting venues around San Diego, being drawn into the city&#x27;s folk scene.

===Early musical career: 1969–1976===
In 1969, he was hired as an occasional doorman for the Heritage coffeehouse, which held regular performances from folk musicians. He also began to sing at the Heritage; his set initially consisted largely of covers of Dylan and Red Sovine&#x27;s &quot;Phantom 309&quot;.
In time, he performed his own material as well, often parodies of country songs or bittersweet ballads influenced by his relationships; these included early songs &quot;Ol&#x27; 55&quot; and &quot;I Hope That I Don&#x27;t Fall in Love With You&quot;. As his reputation grew, he played at other San Diego venues, supporting acts like Tim Buckley, Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee and his friend Jack Tempchin. Aware that San Diego offered little opportunity for career progression, Waits began traveling into Los Angeles to play at the Troubadour in West Hollywood.
It was there, in the autumn of 1971, that Waits came to the attention of Herb Cohen, who signed him to publishing and recording contracts. The recordings that were produced under that recording agreement were eventually released in the early 1990s as &quot;The Early Years&quot; and &quot;The Early Years, Volume Two&quot;. In early 1972, after quitting his job at Napoleone&#x27;s to concentrate on his songwriting career, Waits moved to an apartment in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, a poor neighborhood known for its Hispanic and bohemian communities.
He continued performing at the Troubadour and there met David Geffen, who gave Waits a recording contract with his Asylum Records. Jerry Yester was chosen to produce his first album, with the recording sessions taking place in Hollywood&#x27;s Sunset Sound studios. The resulting album, &quot;Closing Time&quot;, was released in March 1973, although it attracted little attention and did not sell well. Biographer Barney Hoskyns noted that &quot;Closing Time&quot; was &quot;broadly in step with the singer-songwriter school of the early 1970s&quot;; Waits had wanted to create a piano-led jazz album although Yester had pushed its sound in a more folk-oriented direction. Buckley covered &quot;Martha&quot; on his album &quot;Sefronia&quot; later that year. An Eagles recording of &quot;Ol&#x27; 55&quot; on their album &quot;On the Border&quot; brought Waits further money and recognition, although he regarded their version as &quot;a little antiseptic&quot;.

To promote his debut, Waits and a three-piece band embarked on a U.S. tour, where he was the supporting act for more established artists. He supported Tom Rush at Washington D.C.&#x27;s The Cellar Door, Danny O&#x27;Keefe in Cambridge, Massachusetts&#x27;s Club Passim, Charlie Rich at New York City&#x27;s Max&#x27;s Kansas City, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas in East Lansing, Michigan, and John P. Hammond in San Francisco.
Waits returned to Los Angeles in June, feeling demoralized about his career. That month, he was the cover star of free music magazine &quot;Music World&quot;. He began composing songs for his second album, and attended the Venice Poetry Workshop to try out this new material in front of an audience. Although Waits was eager to record this new material, Cohen instead convinced him to take over as a support act for Frank Zappa&#x27;s the Mothers of Invention after previous support act Kathy Dalton pulled out due to the hostility from Zappa&#x27;s fans. Waits joined Zappa&#x27;s tour in Ontario, but like Dalton found the audiences hostile; while on stage he was jeered at and pelted with fruit. Although he liked the Mothers of Invention, he was intimidated by Zappa himself.
Waits moved from Silver Lake to Echo Park, spending much of his time in downtown Los Angeles. In early 1974, he continued to perform around the West Coast, getting as far as Denver. For Waits&#x27;s second album, Geffen wanted a more jazz-oriented producer, selecting Bones Howe for the job. Howe recounts his first encounter with the young artist: &quot;I told him I thought his music and lyrics had a Kerouac quality to them, and he was blown away that I knew who Jack Kerouac was. I told him I also played jazz drums and he went wild. Then I told him that when I was working for Norman Granz, Norman had found these tapes of Kerouac reading his poetry from The Beat Generation in a hotel room. I told Waits I&#x27;d make him a copy. That sealed it.&quot; Recording sessions for &quot;The Heart of Saturday Night&quot; took place at Wally Heider&#x27;s Studio 3 on Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood in April and May, with Waits conceptualizing the album as a sequence of songs about U.S. nightlife. The album was far more widely reviewed than &quot;Closing Time&quot; had been. Waits himself later dismissed the album as &quot;very ill-formed, but I was trying&quot;.

After recording &quot;The Heart of Saturday Night&quot;, Waits reluctantly agreed to tour with Zappa again, but once more faced strong audience hostility. The kudos of having supported Zappa&#x27;s tour nevertheless bolstered his image in the music industry and helped his career. In October 1974, he first performed as the headline act before touring the East Coast; in New York City he met and befriended Bette Midler, with whom he had a sporadic affair. Back in Los Angeles, Cohen suggested Waits produce a live album. To this end, he performed two shows at the Record Plant Studio in front of a small invited audience to recreate the atmosphere of a jazz club. Again produced and engineered by Howe (as all his future Asylum releases would be), it was released as &quot;Nighthawks at the Diner&quot; in October 1975. The album cover and title were inspired by Edward Hopper&#x27;s &quot;Nighthawks&quot; (1942).

He followed this with a week&#x27;s residency at the Reno Sweeney nightclub, an off-Broadway–style club in New York City. In December he appeared on the PBS concert show &quot;Soundstage&quot;. From March to May 1976, he toured the U.S., telling interviewers that the experience was tough and that he was drinking too much alcohol. In May, he embarked on his first tour of Europe, performing in London, Amsterdam, Brussels and Copenhagen. On his return to Los Angeles, he joined his friend Chuck E. Weiss, moving into the Tropicana motel in West Hollywood, which had an established reputation in rock music circles. Visitors noted his two-room apartment there was heavily cluttered. Waits told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that &quot;You almost have to create situations in order to write about them, so I live in a constant state of self-imposed poverty&quot;.

===&quot;Small Change&quot; and &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;: 1976–1978===
In July 1976, Waits recorded &quot;Small Change&quot;, again produced by Howe. He recalled it as a seminal episode in his development as a songwriter, the point when he became &quot;completely confident in the craft&quot;. The album was critically well received and was his first release to break into the Billboard Top 100 Album List, peaking at 89. Per Bowman, &quot;Small Change&quot; &quot;made it clear that Waits had evolved into a master storyteller, reflecting the influence of crime-noir writers such as Dashiell Hammett and John D. MacDonald. Arguably his first masterpiece, the album featured exquisite piano ballads such as &#x27;Tom Traubert&#x27;s Blues&#x27; and ‘The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me),’ the word-jazz of ‘Pasties and a G-String,’ and the tour-de-force tenor-sax-accompanied hucksterism of ‘Step Right Up.’” He received growing press attention, being profiled in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;; he had begun to accrue a cult following. He went on tour to promote the new album, backed by the Nocturnal Emissions (Frank Vicari, Chip White and Fitz Jenkins). In reference to &quot;Pasties and a G-String&quot;, a female stripper joined him onstage. He began 1977 by touring Japan for the first time.
Back in Los Angeles, he encountered various problems. One female fan, recently escaped from a mental health institution in Illinois, began stalking him and lurking outside his Tropicana apartment. In May 1977, Waits and close friend Chuck E. Weiss were arrested for fighting with police officers in a coffee shop. They were charged with two counts of disturbing the peace but were acquitted after the defense produced eight witnesses who refuted the police officers&#x27; account of the incident. In response, Waits sued the Los Angeles Police Department and five years later was awarded $7,500 in damages.

In July and August 1977, he recorded his fourth studio album, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;; Bob Alcivar had been employed as its arranger. The album included &quot;I Never Talk to Strangers&quot;, a duet with Midler, with whom he was still in an intermittent relationship. She appeared with him at the Troubadour to sing the song; the next day he repaid the favor by performing at a gay rights benefit at the Hollywood Bowl that Midler was involved with. &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; was not as well received by critics as its predecessor, and unlike &quot;Small Change&quot; failed to make the Billboard Top 100 album chart. That year, he began a relationship with the singer-songwriter Rickie Lee Jones; their work and styles influenced each other. In October 1977, he returned to touring with the Nocturnal Emissions; it was on this tour that he first began using props onstage, in this case a street lamp. Again, he found the tour exhausting. In March 1978, he embarked on his second tour of Japan.

During these years, Waits sought to broaden his career beyond music. He befriended actor and director Sylvester Stallone and made his film debut as a drunken piano player in Stallone&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Alley&quot; (1978). With Paul Hampton, Waits also began writing a movie musical, although this project never came to fruition. Another project he began at this time was a book about entertainers of the past whom he admired.

===&quot;Blue Valentine&quot; and &quot;Heartattack and Vine&quot;: 1978–1980===

In July 1978, Waits began the recording sessions for &quot;Blue Valentine&quot;. Part way through the sessions, he replaced his musicians to create a less jazz-oriented sound; for the album, he switched from a piano to an electric guitar as his main instrument. For the album&#x27;s back cover, Waits used a picture of himself and Jones leaning against his car, a 1964 Ford Thunderbird, taken by Elliot Gilbert. Per Bowman, &quot;Waits gradually began writing about junkies and prostitutes instead of skid-row drunks. In songs such as &#x27;Christmas Card From a Hooker in Minneapolis’ and ‘Red Shoes by the Drugstore,’ his writing became ever more vivid, compact, and complex.&quot; From the album, Waits&#x27;s first single, a cover of &quot;Somewhere&quot; from &quot;West Side Story&quot;, was released, but it failed to chart. For his &quot;Blue Valentine&quot; tour, Waits assembled a new band; he also had a gas station built as a set for his performances. His support act on the tour was Leon Redbone. In April, he embarked on a European tour, there making television appearances and press interviews; in Austria he was the subject of a short documentary. From there, he flew to Australia for his first tour of that country before returning to Los Angeles in May.

Waits was dissatisfied with Elektra-Asylum, who he felt had lost interest in him as an artist in favor of their more commercially successful acts like the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, Carly Simon and Queen. After a phone call with their mutual friend Chuck E. Weiss, Waits told Jones, &quot;Chuck E.&#x27;s in love&quot;. This was the inspiration for her song &quot;Chuck E.&#x27;s in Love&quot;. Jones&#x27;s musical career was taking off; after an appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Chuck E.&#x27;s In Love&quot; reached number 4 in the singles chart, straining her relationship with Waits. Their relationship was further damaged by Jones&#x27;s heroin addiction. Waits joined Jones for the first leg of her European tour, but then ended his relationship with her. Her grief at the breakup was channeled into the 1981 album &quot;Pirates&quot;. In September, Waits moved to Crenshaw Boulevard to be closer to his father, before deciding to relocate to New York City. He initially lived in the Chelsea Hotel before renting an apartment on West 26th Street. On arriving in the city, he told a reporter that he &quot;just needed a new urban landscape. I&#x27;ve always wanted to live here. It&#x27;s a good working atmosphere for me&quot;. He considered writing a Broadway musical based on Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot;. A rotoscoped Waits performed &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; in the music video &quot;Tom Waits For No One&quot; (1979).

Francis Ford Coppola asked Waits to return to Los Angeles to write a soundtrack for his forthcoming film, &quot;One from the Heart&quot;. Waits was excited, but conflicted, by the prospect; Coppola wanted him to create music akin to his early work, a genre that he was trying to leave behind, and thus he characterized the project as an artistic &quot;step backwards&quot;. He nevertheless returned to Los Angeles to work on the soundtrack in a room set aside for the purpose in Coppola&#x27;s Hollywood studios. This style of working was new to Waits; he later recalled that he was &quot;so insecure when I started ... I was sweating buckets&quot;. Waits was nominated for the 1982 Academy Award for Original Music Score.

Waits still contractually owed Elektra-Asylum another album, so took a break from Coppola&#x27;s project to write an album that he initially called &quot;White Spades&quot;. He recorded the album in June; it was released in September as &quot;Heartattack and Vine&quot;. The album was more guitar-based and had, according to Humphries, &quot;a harder R&amp;B edge&quot; than any of its predecessors. It again broke into the Top 100 Album Chart, peaking at number 96. Reviews were generally good. Hoskyns called it &quot;one of Waits&#x27;s pinnacle achievements&quot; as an album. One of its tracks, &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;, was subsequently recorded by Bruce Springsteen. Waits was grateful, both for the revenue that the cover brought him and because he felt appreciated by a songwriter he admired. While on the set of &quot;One from the Heart&quot;, Waits encountered Kathleen Brennan, a young Irish-American woman working as an assistant story editor. The two had previously met while Waits was filming &quot;Paradise Alley&quot;. Waits would later describe this encounter with Brennan as &quot;love at first sight&quot;; they were engaged to be married within a week. In August 1980, they married at a 24-hour wedding chapel on Manchester Boulevard in Watts before honeymooning in Tralee, a town in County Kerry, Ireland, where Brennan had family.

===&quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; and New York City: 1980–1984===
Returning to Los Angeles, Waits and Brennan moved into a Union Avenue apartment. Hoskyns noted that with Brennan, &quot;Waits had found the stabilizing, nurturing companion he&#x27;d always wanted&quot;, and that she brought him &quot;a sense of emotional security he had never known&quot; before. At the same time, many of his old friends felt cut off after his marriage. Waits said of Brennan: &quot;She rescued me. Maybe I rescued her too; that&#x27;s often how it works. Upshot is that we both got into the same leaky boat. Maybe the weight drags it down, because now you&#x27;ve two people sitting in it. Sorry, baby! But on the other hand you&#x27;ve also got two peoples&#x27; imagination to patch it up again. Everybody knows she&#x27;s the brains behind Pa, as Dylan might have said. I&#x27;m just the figurehead. She&#x27;s the one who&#x27;s steering the ship.&quot;

Recording of Waits&#x27;s &quot;One from the Heart&quot; soundtrack began in October 1980 and continued until September 1981. A number of the tracks were recorded as duets with Crystal Gayle; Waits had initially planned to duet with Midler but she proved unavailable. The film was released in 1982, to largely poor reviews. Waits makes a small cameo as a trumpet player in a crowd scene. Waits&#x27;s soundtrack album was released by Columbia Records in 1982. Waits had misgivings about the album, thinking it over-produced. Humphries thought that working with Coppola was an important move in Waits&#x27;s career: it &quot;led directly to Waits moving from cult (i.e. largely unknown) artiste to center-stage.&quot;

Newly married and with his Elektra-Asylum contract completed, Waits decided that it was time to artistically reinvent himself. He wanted to move away from using Howe as his producer, although the two parted on good terms. With Brennan&#x27;s help, he began the process of firing Cohen as his manager, with him and Brennan taking on managerial responsibilities themselves. He came to believe that Cohen had been swindling him out of much of his earnings, later relating that &quot;I thought I was a millionaire and it turned out I had, like, twenty bucks.&quot; Waits credited Brennan with introducing him to much new music, most notably Captain Beefheart, a key influence on the direction in which he wanted to take his music. He later said that &quot;once you&#x27;ve heard Beefheart it&#x27;s hard to wash him out of your clothes. It stains, like coffee or blood.&quot; She also introduced him to Harry Partch, a composer who created his own instruments out of everyday materials. Waits began to use images rather than moods or characters as the basis for his songs.

Waits wrote the songs for &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; during a two-week trip to Ireland. He recorded it at Sunset Sound studios and produced it himself; Brennan often attended the sessions and gave him advice. &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; abandoned the jazz sound characteristic of his earlier work; it was his first album not to feature a saxophone and his first to feature the marimba. When the album was finished, he took it to Asylum, but they declined to release it. Waits wanted to leave the label; in his view, &quot;They liked dropping my name in terms of me being a &#x27;prestige&#x27; artist, but when it came down to it they didn&#x27;t invest a whole lot in me in terms of faith&quot;. Chris Blackwell of Island Records learned of Waits&#x27;s dissatisfaction and approached him, offering to release &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;; Island had a reputation for signing more experimental acts, such as King Crimson, Roxy Music and Sparks. Waits did not tour to promote the album, partly because Brennan was pregnant. Although unenthusiastic about the new trend for music videos, he appeared in one for the song &quot;In the Neighborhood&quot;, co-directed by Haskell Wexler and Michael A. Russ. Russ also designed the &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; album cover, featuring an image of Waits with Lee Kolima, a circus strongman, and Angelo Rossitto, a dwarf.

Jon Pareles, in &quot;GQ,&quot; wrote that &quot;On &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;, Waits has made a breakthrough – he&#x27;s found music as evocative as his words. Waits&#x27;s grumble of a voice now bounces off a peculiar assortment of horns and percussion and organ and keyboards, as if he&#x27;d led a Salvation Army band into a broken-down Hong Kong disco. It&#x27;s as if he&#x27;s shifted from monologues to screenplays.&quot; According to David Smay, &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; was &quot;the record where Tom Waits radically reinvented himself and reshaped the musical landscape.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; named it the second best album of the year. In 1989, &quot;Spin&quot; magazine named it the second greatest album of all time.

In 1983, Waits appeared in three more Coppola films: as Benny, a philosopher running a billboard store in &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;; as Buck Merrill in &quot;The Outsiders&quot;; and as the maître&#x27;d in &quot;The Cotton Club&quot;. He later said that &quot;Coppola is actually the only film director in Hollywood that has a conscience ... most of them are egomaniacs and money-grabbing bastards&quot;. In September, Brennan gave birth to their daughter, Kellesimone. Waits was determined to keep his family life separate from his public image and to spend as much time as possible with his daughter. With Brennan and their child, Waits moved to New York City to be closer to Brennan&#x27;s parents and Island&#x27;s U.S. office. They settled into a loft apartment near Union Square.

Waits found New York City life frustrating, although it allowed him to meet many new musicians and artists. He befriended John Lurie of the Lounge Lizards, and the duo began sharing a music studio in the Westbeth artist-community building in Greenwich Village. He began networking in the city&#x27;s arts scene, and, at a party Jean-Michel Basquiat held for Lurie, he met the filmmaker Jim Jarmusch.

===&quot;Rain Dogs&quot; and &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot;: 1985–1988===

Starting in the mid-80s, Kurt Weill became an important influence on Waits&#x27;s work. Bowman writes that &quot;Waits had become interested in Weill&#x27;s late-1920s and 1930s musical-theater works ... Weill&#x27;s slightly off-kilter, stylized cabaret approach to melody, rhythm, orchestration, and musical narrative permeated much of Waits&#x27;s subsequent work.&quot; Waits did the soundtrack for the documentary &quot;Streetwise&quot;, about homeless youth in Seattle; it was another influence on the subjects of his next album. &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; was recorded at the RCA Studios in mid 1985. Musically, Waits called the album &quot;kind of an interaction between Appalachia and Nigeria&quot;. Keith Richards played on several tracks; Richards later acknowledged Waits&#x27;s encouragement of his debut solo album, &quot;Talk is Cheap&quot;. &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; also marked Marc Ribot&#x27;s debut as a session guitarist; he would play on many subsequent Waits albums. Jean-Baptiste Mondino directed a music video of &quot;Downtown Train&quot; featuring boxer Jake LaMotta. The song was subsequently covered by Patty Smyth in 1987, and later by Rod Stewart, where it reached the top five in 1990. In 1985, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Waits its &quot;Songwriter of the Year&quot;. Arion Berger wrote that &quot;With &quot;Rain Dogs&quot;, he dropped his bedraggled lounge-piano act and fused outsider influences – socialist decadence by way of Kurt Weill, pre-rock integrity from old dirty blues, the elegiac melancholy of New Orleans funeral brass – into a singularly idiosyncratic American style ... The music is bony and menacingly beautiful, the desultory electric-guitar solo as cold as the rattle of marimbas in &#x27;Clap Hands&#x27;. The evocative, elliptical rhymes describe scenes and characters with poetic precision but use atmosphere, not narrative, to connect them.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; named &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; the best album of the year.

In September 1985, his son Casey was born. Waits assembled a band and went on tour, kicking it off in Scotland in October before proceeding around Europe and then the U.S. He changed the setlist for each performance; most of the songs chosen were from his two Island albums. Returning to the U.S., he traveled to New Orleans to act in Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Down by Law&quot;. Jarmusch wrote &quot;Down by Law&quot; with Waits and Lurie in mind. The film opened and closed with songs from &quot;Rain Dogs&quot;. Jarmusch noted that &quot;Tom and I have a kindred aesthetic. An interest in unambitious people, marginal people.&quot; The pair developed a friendship; Waits called Jarmusch &quot;Dr. Sullen&quot;, while Jarmusch called Waits &quot;The Prince of Melancholy&quot;.

Waits had devised a musical, &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot;, loosely based on &quot;Frank&#x27;s Wild Years&quot; from &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;. In late 1985, he reached an agreement that the play would be performed by the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago&#x27;s Briar Street Theatre Waits starred as Frank, whom he described as Quite a guy. Grew up in a bird&#x27;s eye frozen, oven-ready, rural American town where Bing, Bob, Dean, Wayne &amp; Jerry are considered major constellations. Frank, mistakenly, thinks he can stuff himself into their shorts and present himself to an adoring world. He is a combination of Will Rogers and Mark Twain, playing accordion – but without the wisdom they possessed. He has a poet&#x27;s heart and a boy&#x27;s sense of wonder with the world. A legend in Rainville since he burned his house down and took off for the Big Time. Reviews were generally positive. He had initially considered a run in New York City but decided against it. The songs from the show were recorded for his ninth studio album, &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot;, and released by Island in 1987. &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot; fifth on its list of albums of the year. The album was Waits&#x27;s first collaboration with David Hidalgo, who played accordion on &quot;Cold, Cold Ground&quot; and &quot;Train Song&quot;. After its release, Waits toured North America and Europe, his last full tour for two decades. Two of these performances were the basis for Chris Blum&#x27;s concert film &quot;Big Time&quot; (1988).

Waits continued interacting and working with other artists he admired. He was a great fan of the Pogues and went on a Chicago pub crawl with them in 1986. The following year, he appeared as a master of ceremonies on several dates of Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; tour.

In 1986, he took a small part in &quot;Candy Mountain&quot;, as millionaire golf enthusiast Al Silk. He costarred in Hector Babenco&#x27;s &quot;Ironweed&quot;, as Rudy the Kraut. Hoskyns noted that &quot;Ironweed&quot; put Waits &quot;on the mainstream Hollywood map as a character actor&quot;. In Fall 1987, Waits and his family left New York and returned to Los Angeles, settling on Union Avenue. He appeared as a hitman in Robert Dornhelm&#x27;s &quot;Cold Feet&quot; and lent his voice to Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Train&quot;.

Although Waits had provided a voice-over for a 1981 television advert for Butcher&#x27;s Blend dog food, he objected to musicians letting companies use their songs in advertising; he said that &quot;artists who take money for ads poison and pervert their songs&quot;. In November 1988, he brought a lawsuit against Frito-Lay for using an impersonator performing &quot;Step Right Up&quot; in an advertisement for Doritos; it came to court in April 1990, and Waits won the case in 1992. He received a $2.6 million settlement, a sum larger than his earnings from all of his previous albums combined. This earned him and Brennan reputations as tireless adversaries.

===&quot;The Black Rider&quot;, &quot;Bone Machine&quot;, and &quot;Alice&quot;: 1989–1998===

In 1989, Waits began planning a collaboration with Robert Wilson, a theater director he had known throughout the 1980s. Their project was the &quot;cowboy opera&quot; &quot;The Black Rider&quot;. It was based on a German folk tale, the Freischütz, which had inspired Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s opera &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; (1821). In 2004, Waits related that &quot;Wilson is my teacher. There&#x27;s nobody that&#x27;s affected me that much as an artist&quot;. Waits wrote the music and, at the suggestion of Allen Ginsberg, Waits and Wilson approached William S. Burroughs to pen the lyrics. They flew to Kansas to meet with Burroughs, who agreed to join the project. Waits traveled to Hamburg&lt; germany, in May 1989 to work on the project, and was later joined there by Burroughs. &quot;The Black Rider&quot; debuted in Hamburg&#x27;s Thalia Theater in March 1990. On completing its run at the Thalia, the play went on an international tour, with a second run of performances occurring in the mid-2000s.

In June 1989, Waits travelled to London to play a Punch and Judy puppeteer in Ann Guedes&#x27;s film &quot;Bearskin: An Urban Fairytale&quot;. He proceeded to Ireland, where he was joined by Brennan and spent time with her family. In December 1989, he began a stint as Curly, a mobster&#x27;s son, at the Los Angeles Theater Center production of Thomas Babe&#x27;s play &quot;Demon Wine&quot;. Over the next four years, he made seven film appearances. He nevertheless repeatedly told press that he did not see himself as an actor, but only as someone who did some acting. He made a brief appearance as a plainclothes cop in &quot;The Two Jakes&quot; (1990) and played a disabled war veteran in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;The Fisher King&quot; (1991). He had a cameo in Steve Rash&#x27;s &quot;Queens Logic&quot; (1991) and played a pilot-for-hire in Héctor Babenco&#x27;s &quot;At Play in the Fields of the Lord&quot; (1991). He appeared as himself fishing with John Lurie on &quot;Fishing with John&quot;. He was Renfield in Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992). Waits starred as Earl Piggot, an alcoholic limousine driver, in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993). Hoskyns said that this &quot;may be the best performance Waits ever gave as an actor.&quot;

In 1991, Waits and his family moved to the outskirts of Sonoma. Waits&#x27;s family later relocated to a secluded house near Valley Ford after a bypass road was built near to their first Sonoma County house. Also in 1991, 13 of Waits&#x27;s 1971 pre-Asylum Records recordings were released for the first time on the first volume of &quot;Tom Waits: The Early Years&quot;. Waits was angered at this, describing many of his early demos as &quot;baby pictures&quot; that he would not want released. A second volume with 13 more recordings from 1971 was released in 1993. In April 1992, Waits released the soundtrack album to Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Night on Earth&quot;. Largely instrumental, it had been recorded at the Prairie Sun studio in Cotati. In 1992, Waits quit drinking alcohol and joined Alcoholics Anonymous. In the early 1990s he took part in several charitable causes. In 1990 he contributed a song to the HIV/AIDS benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot; and later appeared at a Wiltern Theater fundraising show for the victims of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

In August 1992, Waits released his tenth studio album, &quot;Bone Machine&quot;. Waits wanted to explore &quot;more machinery sounds&quot; with the album, reflecting his interest in industrial music. It was recorded in an old storage room at Prairie Sun.
Waits recalled: &quot;I found a great room to work in, it&#x27;s just a cement floor and a hot water heater. Okay, we&#x27;ll do it here. It&#x27;s got some good echo.&quot; Eight of the album&#x27;s tracks were co-written with Brennan. The cover was co-designed by Waits and Jesse Dylan. Jarmusch and Dylan directed videos for &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Grow Up&quot;, and &quot;Goin&#x27; Out West&quot;, respectively. Critic Steve Huey called it &quot;perhaps Tom Waits&#x27;s most cohesive album ... a morbid, sinister nightmare, one that applied the quirks of his experimental &#x27;80s classics to stunningly evocative—and often harrowing—effect ... Waits&#x27;s most affecting and powerful recording, even if it isn&#x27;t his most accessible.&quot; The album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;That Feel&quot;, was co-written with Keith Richards. &quot;Bone Machine&quot; won the Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album; in response, Waits asked Jarmusch: &quot;alternative to &quot;what&quot;?!&quot;

Waits decided to record an album of the songs written for &quot;The Black Rider&quot;, and did so at Los Angeles&#x27;s Sunset Sound Factory. &quot;The Black Rider&quot; was released in the fall of 1993. Waits and Wilson decided to collaborate again, this time on an operatic treatment of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s relationship with Alice Liddell, who had provided the inspiration for &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;. Again scheduled to premier at the Thalia, they began working on the project in Hamburg in early 1992. Waits characterized the songs he wrote for the play as &quot;adult songs for children, or children&#x27;s songs for adults&quot;. In his lyrics, Waits drew on his increasing interest in freak shows and the physically deformed. He thought the play itself was about &quot;repression, mental illness and obsessive, compulsive disorders&quot;. &quot;Alice&quot; premiered at the Thalia in December 1992.

In early 1993, Brennan was pregnant with Waits&#x27;s third child, Sullivan. He decided to reduce his workload so as to spend more time with his children; this isolation spawned rumours that he was seriously ill or had separated from his wife. For three years, he turned down all offers to perform gigs or appear in movies. However, he made several cameos and guest appearances on albums by musicians he admired. In February 1996, he held a benefit performance to raise funds for the legal defense of his friend Don Hyde, who had been charged with distributing LSD. He wrote &quot;Walk Away&quot; and &quot;The Fall of Troy&quot; for the soundtrack of &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; (1995) and &quot;Little Drop of Poison&quot; for &quot;The End of Violence&quot; (1997). In 1998, Island released &quot;Beautiful Maladies&quot;, a compilation of 23 Waits tracks from his albums with the company, selected by Waits himself.

===&quot;Mule Variations&quot; and &quot;Woyzeck&quot;: 1999–2003===

After his contract with Island expired, Waits decided not to try to renew it, particularly as Blackwell had resigned from the company. He signed to a smaller record label, Anti-, recently launched as an offshoot of the punk-label Epitaph Records. He described the company as &quot;a friendly place&quot;. The president of Anti-, Andy Kaulkin, said the label was &quot;blown away that Tom would even consider us. We are huge fans.&quot; Waits himself praised the label: &quot;Epitaph is a label run by and for artists and musicians, where it feels much more like a partnership than a plantation ... We shook on the deal over a coffee in a truck stop. I know it&#x27;s going to be an adventure.&quot;

In March 1999, Anti- released &quot;Mule Variations&quot;. Waits had been recording the tracks at Prairie Sun since June 1998. The tracks often dealt with themes involving rural life in the United States and were influenced by the early blues recordings made by Alan Lomax; Waits coined the term &quot;surrural&quot; (&quot;surreal&quot; and &quot;rural&quot;) to describe the album&#x27;s content. &quot;Mule Variations&quot; reached number 30 on the U.S. Billboard 200, the highest showing of a Waits album. The album was well received, being named &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by &quot;Mojo&quot;. It won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. On the categorization of the album as folk music, Waits said: &quot;That&#x27;s not a bad thing to be called if you&#x27;ve got to be in some kind of category.&quot;

Also in March 1999, Waits gave his first live show in three years at Paramount Theater, Austin, Texas as part of the South by Southwest festival. He subsequently appeared in an episode of &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot;. In the later part of the year he embarked on the &quot;Mule Variations&quot; tour, primarily in the U.S. but also featuring dates in Berlin. In October, he performed at Neil Young&#x27;s annual Bridge School benefit concert. That year, he appeared in Kinka Usher&#x27;s comic book spoof &quot;Mystery Men&quot; as Dr A. Heller, an eccentric inventor living in an abandoned amusement park.

In 2000, Waits began writing songs for Wilson&#x27;s adaptation of Georg Büchner&#x27;s &quot;Woyzeck&quot;, which had earlier inspired Alban Berg&#x27;s opera &quot;Wozzeck&quot; (1925). It was scheduled to start at the Betty Nansen Theater in Copenhagen in November 2000. He initially worked on the songs at home before traveling to Copenhagen for rehearsals in October. Waits stated that he liked the play because it was &quot;a proletariat story  ... about a poor soldier who is manipulated by the government&quot;. He decided to then record the songs he had written for both &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Woyzeck&quot;, placing them on separate albums. For these recordings, he brought in a range of jazz and avant-garde musicians from San Francisco. The two albums, &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Blood Money&quot;, were released simultaneously in May 2002. &quot;Alice&quot; entered the U.S. album chart at number 32 and &quot;Blood Money&quot; at number 33, his highest charting positions at that time. Waits described &quot;Alice&quot; as being &quot;more metaphysical or something, maybe more water, more feminine&quot;, while &quot;Blood Money&quot; was &quot;more earthbound, more carnival, more the slaving meat-wheel that we&#x27;re all on&quot;. Of the two, &quot;Alice&quot; was better received by critics.
Jesse Dylan directed a video for &quot;God&#x27;s Away On Business&quot;, but shooting was delayed when the emus who were set to star were eaten by coyotes. Per &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Replacements were hastily found and the video for ‘God’s Away On Business’, the single lifted from ‘Blood Money’, one of Waits’ two new albums, went ahead a little late.&quot;

In May 2001, Waits accepted a Founders Award at the 18th annual American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) Pop Music Awards in a ceremony at Los Angeles&#x27;s Beverly Hilton Hotel. That same month, he joined singers Nancy and Ann Wilson of Heart, as well as Randy Newman, in launching a $40 million lawsuit against mp3.com for copyright infringement. In September 2002, he appeared at a hearing on accounting practices within the music industry in California. There, he expressed satisfaction with Anti- but declared more broadly that &quot;the record companies are like cartels. It&#x27;s a nightmare to be trapped in one.&quot;

In September 2003, Waits performed at the Healing the Divide fundraiser in New York City. He appeared in Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Coffee and Cigarettes&quot; (2003), having a conversation with Iggy Pop.

===&quot;Real Gone&quot; and &quot;Orphans&quot;: 2004–2011===

In 2004, Waits released his fifteenth studio album, &quot;Real Gone&quot;. Waits had recorded it in an abandoned schoolhouse in Locke. Hoskyns called the album Waits&#x27;s &quot;roughest, most unkempt music to date&quot;. It incorporated Waits beatboxing, a technique he had picked up from his growing interest in hip hop. Humphries characterized it as &quot;the most overtly political album of Waits&#x27;s career&quot;. It featured three political songs expressing Waits&#x27;s anger at the presidency of George W. Bush and the Iraq War. He said: &quot;I&#x27;m not a politician. I keep my mouth shut because I don&#x27;t want to put my foot in it. But at a certain point, saying absolutely nothing is a political statement of its own.&quot; &quot;Real Gone&quot; received largely positive reviews. It made the Billboard Top 30 as well as the Top 10 in several European album charts, also earning him a nomination for Best International Male Solo Artist at the 2005 Brit Awards. In October 2004, he launched a tour in Vancouver before heading to Europe, where his shows were sell-outs: his only London gig saw 78,000 applications for around 3,700 available tickets. Per Bowman, &quot;Much of &quot;Real Gone&quot; was built around oral-percussion home recordings that Waits made in his bathroom, using his mouth as a human beat-box. A superb example is the bed track underpinning the hellacious groove of ‘Metropolitan Glide’ that Waits aptly described as ‘cubist funk.’ In stark contrast, the album&#x27;s closing track, &#x27;Day After Tomorrow,&#x27; returned Waits to his singer-songwriter roots, and features a beautiful melody that sounds eerily similar to Dylan&#x27;s early acoustic work.&quot;

After several years without film appearances, he played a gun-toting Seventh-day Adventist in Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;Domino&quot; (2005). Later that year, he traveled to Italy to appear in Benigni&#x27;s &quot;The Tiger and the Snow&quot;. He followed this with a performance as an angel posing as a tramp in &quot;&quot; (2007). In the summer of 2006, Waits embarked on his &quot;Orphans&quot; tour of southern and Midwest states. His son Casey played in the band accompanying him on tour. In 2006, he issued &quot;&quot;, a 54-song three-disc box set of rarities, unreleased tracks and new compositions; Waits described its contents as &quot;songs that fell behind the stove while making dinner.&quot; The first disc, &quot;Brawlers&quot;, consists of raucous rock and blues-based numbers; the second, &quot;Bawlers&quot;, of melancholic country songs and ballads; the third, &quot;Bastards&quot;, of stories, spoken word pieces and other works not so easily categorized. &quot;Orphans&quot; made the top ten in several European charts. In 2006, Waits was a guest on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; with Jon Stewart, where he played &quot;Day After Tomorrow&quot;.

In January 2008, Waits performed at a benefit for Bet Tzedek Legal Services—The House of Justice, a nonprofit poverty law center, in Los Angeles.
That year, Waits embarked on his Glitter and Doom Tour, starting in the U.S. and moving to Europe. Both of his sons played with him on the tour. At the June concert in El Paso, Texas, Waits was presented with the key to the city. Approached by a police officer, he said: &quot;I paid all those tickets!&quot; Breaking character, he said: “This is a first for me, a real first.” In 2009, he released the two-disc &quot;Glitter and Doom Live&quot;. He continued acting, playing Mr Nick in Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&quot; (2009) and Engineer in &quot;The Book of Eli&quot; (2010), a post-apocalyptic film by the Hughes brothers.

Waits found himself in a situation similar to his earlier one with Frito Lay in 2000 when Audi approached him, asking to use &quot;Innocent When You Dream&quot; for a commercial broadcast in Spain. Waits declined, but the commercial ultimately featured music very similar to that song. Waits undertook legal action, and a Spanish court recognized that there had been a violation of Waits&#x27;s moral rights in addition to the infringement of copyright. The production company, Tandem Campmany Guasch, was ordered to pay compensation to Waits through his Spanish publisher. Waits later joked that they got the name of the song wrong, thinking it was called &quot;Innocent When You Scheme&quot;. In 2005, Waits sued Adam Opel AG, claiming that, after having failed to sign him to sing in their Scandinavian commercials, they had hired a sound-alike singer. In 2007, the suit was settled, and Waits gave his proceeds to charity.

===&quot;Bad as Me&quot; and later work: 2011–present===
In 2010, Waits was reported to be working on a new stage musical with director and long-time collaborator Robert Wilson and playwright Martin McDonagh.

In early 2011, Waits completed a set of 23 poems, &quot;Seeds on Hard Ground&quot;, which were inspired by Michael O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s portraits of the homeless in his book, &quot;Hard Ground&quot;. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s book included the poems alongside the portraits. In anticipation of the book release, Waits and ANTI- printed limited edition chapbooks of the poems to raise money for Redwood Empire Food Bank, a homeless referral and family support service in Sonoma County, California. As of January 26, 2011, four editions, each limited to 1,000 copies, sold out, raising $90,000 for the food bank. On February 24, 2011, it was announced via Waits&#x27;s official website that he had begun work on his next studio album. Waits said through his website that on August 23 he would &quot;set the record straight&quot; in regards to rumors of a new release. On August 23, the title of the new album was revealed to be &quot;Bad as Me&quot;, and the lead single and title track started being offered via Amazon.com and other sites.

In March 2011, Waits was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Neil Young. In his acceptance speech, Waits said: &quot;I’d like to thank my family. They know me and they love me anyway. My wife and her incandescent light that has guided me and kept me alive and breathing and sparkling. And my kids who, well, they taught me everything I know. Or maybe they taught me everything they know. I don’t know. They taught me a lot.&quot;

In 2012, Waits had a supporting role in McDonagh&#x27;s crime comedy &quot;Seven Psychopaths&quot; as a retired serial killer. In 2013, he lent his voice to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homer Goes to Prep School&quot; as a survivalist. On May 5, 2013, he joined the Rolling Stones on stage at the Oracle Arena in Oakland, California, to duet with Mick Jagger on Willie Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot;. On October 27, 2013, Waits performed at the 27th annual Bridge School Benefit concert in Mountain View California; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called his performance a &quot;triumph&quot;.

Over the years, Waits made six appearances on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and on May 14, 2015, sang &quot;Take One Last Look&quot; on the show&#x27;s fifth to last broadcast. He was accompanied by Larry Taylor on upright bass and Gabriel Donohue on piano accordion, with the horn section of the CBS Orchestra. In 2016, Waits pursued litigation against French artist Bartabas, who had used several of his songs as a backdrop to a theatrical performance. Claims and counterclaims were made, with Bartabas claiming to have sought and been granted permission to use the material (and to have paid $400,000 for the privilege) but with Waits claiming that his identity had been stolen. The court ruled in Bartabas&#x27;s favor, and the circus performance was allowed to continue, although the threat of further litigation meant that it was not performed outside France and the resulting DVD release does not contain Waits&#x27;s material.

In 2018, Waits had a feature role in &quot;The Ballad of Buster Scruggs&quot;, a Western anthology film by the Coen brothers, as the Prospector. Also in 2018, Waits provided the recorded narration for performances of McDonagh&#x27;s play &quot;A Very Very Very Dark Matter&quot;, which was performed at the Bridge Theatre, London. In 2021, Waits had a supporting role in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s coming-of-age film &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot;. In 2023, he joined Iggy Pop on the &quot;Confidential Show&quot;, where they swapped stories and songs.

==Musical style==
Per Bowman, Waits has never been of his time, ahead of his time, or, for that matter, locked into any particular time. An outsider artist before the term was in common use, Waits has been enamored, at various points in his career, with the cool of 1940s and 1950s jazz; the 1950s and 1960s word-jazz and poetry of such Beat and Beat-influenced writers as Jack Kerouac, Lord Buckley, and Charles Bukowski; the primal rock &amp; roll crunch of the Rolling Stones; the German cabaret stylings of Kurt Weill; the postwar, alternate world of invented instruments and rugged individualism of avant-garde composer Harry Partch; the proto-metal blues of 1950s and 1960s Howlin&#x27; Wolf and their extension into the world of Captain Beefheart&#x27;s late-1960s avant-rock; the archaic formalism of 19th-century parlor ballads; Dylan&#x27;s early- and mid-sixties transformation of the possibilities of language in the worlds of both folk and rock; the elegance of pre-war Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Hoagy Carmichael; the sophistication of postwar Frank Sinatra; and, more recently, the bone-crushing grooves of 1980s and 1990s funk and hip-hop. Indeed, the art of Tom Waits has altogether transcended time and, to some degree, place.

Asked about the distinction between words and music, he says: &quot;I&#x27;m still a word guy. I&#x27;m drawn to people who use a certain vernacular and communicate with words. Words are music, really. I mean, people ask me, &#x27;Do you write music or do you write words?&#x27; But you don&#x27;t really, it&#x27;s all one thing at its best.&quot; His work was influenced by his voracious reading and by conversations that he overheard in diners. In addition to Kerouac and Bukowski, literary influences include Nelson Algren, John Rechy and Hubert Selby Jr. Bowman notes the influence of crime writers like Dashiell Hammett and John D. Macdonald. Waits says that &quot;for a songwriter, Dylan is as essential as a hammer and nails and saw are to a carpenter.&quot; Musical influences include Randy Newman and Dr. John. He has praised Merle Haggard: &quot;Want to learn how to write songs? Listen to Merle Haggard.&quot; He is an opera lover, and recalls hearing Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; &quot;in the kitchen at Coppola&#x27;s with Raul Julia one night, and it changed my life, that particular Aria... It was like giving a cigar to a five-year old.&quot; A jazz influence is Thelonious Monk: &quot;He almost sounded like a kid taking piano lessons. I could relate to that when I first started playing the piano, because he was decomposing the music while he was playing it.&quot; Regarding his eclectic influences, he says: &quot;I draw from all kinds of sources and I listen to a lot of things ... I would recommend that when you are starting out that you stay with your own stuff and find out who you are. And stay with you mining your own unique qualities rather than trying to sound like somebody else. I mean you do start out like somebody else, and slowly you become yourself, so it&#x27;s kinda like life, you know?&quot;

Waits described his voice as being &quot;the sand in the sandwich.&quot; By 1982, Waits&#x27;s musical style shifted; Hoskyns noted that this new style &quot;was fashioned out of diverse and disparate ingredients.&quot; This new style was influenced by Beefheart and Partch. Noting that he had a &quot;gravelly timbre&quot;, Humphries characterized Waits&#x27;s voice as one that &quot;sounds like it was hauled through Hades in a dredger.&quot; His voice was described by critic Daniel Durchholz as sounding as though &quot;it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months, and then taken outside and run over with a car.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also noted his &quot;rusted plow-blade voice.&quot; One of Waits&#x27;s own favorite descriptions of his vocal style was &quot;Louis Armstrong and Ethel Merman meeting in Hell.&quot; Humphries cited him, alongside Newman, Kris Kristofferson and John Prine, as a number of U.S. singers who followed Dylan in breaking away from conventional styles of popular music and singing with their &quot;distinctive&quot; voices. Waits can sing in falsetto, as heard on &quot;Shore Leave&quot;, &quot;Temptation&quot; and &quot;All Stripped Down&quot;. Waits said he couldn&#x27;t sing in falsetto until after he quit smoking, adding &quot;Nobody does it like Mick Jagger; nobody does it like Prince.&quot;

He is known for his eclectic use of instruments, some of his own devising. On &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;, his orchestration included talking drums, bagpipes, banjo, bass marimba and glass harmonica; on &quot;Rain Dogs&quot;, accordion and harmonium; on &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot;, glockenspiel, Mellotron, Farfisa and Optigan; on &quot;Bone Machine&quot; and &quot;Mule Variations&quot;, the Chamberlin; on &quot;The Black Rider&quot;, the singing saw; on &quot;Alice&quot;, the Stroh violin; on &quot;Blood Money&quot;, a 57-whistle pneumatic calliope and an Indonesian seedpod. He explains &quot;I use things we hear around us all the time, built and found instruments. Things that aren&#x27;t normally considered instruments: dragging a chair across the floor or hitting the side of a locker real hard with a two-by-four, a freedom bell, a brake drum with a major imperfection, a police bullhorn. It&#x27;s more interesting. I don&#x27;t like straight lines. The problem is that most instruments are square and music is always round.&quot; As he later put it, &quot;A lot of things are instruments and they don&#x27;t even know it.&quot;

Humphries described &quot;Waitsworld&quot; as a place of &quot;the ricocheted romantics bent out of shape by a broad who should have known better; the twisted psychotics; the loners; the losers.&quot; By &quot;Blue Valentine&quot;, violent death had become a recurrent lyrical theme in his work; he wrote the song &quot;Sweet Little Bullet&quot; from that album, for instance, about a 15-year-old girl who committed suicide by jumping from a high window along the Hollywood Bowl. &quot;Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis&quot;, from the same album, is an epistolary song from a prostitute to her former lover, Charlie; while good-hearted, she is an unreliable narrator. In his later work, orphanhood became a recurring theme. Many of his songs make reference to fictional locations that he has invented, such as the eponymous term in his song &quot;Burma Shave&quot;. Hoskyns also noted that many Waits songs, such as &quot;Burma Shave&quot; and &quot;Georgia Lee&quot;, reflect an &quot;abiding concern for runaways and kids in danger.&quot; Andy Gill expressed the view that throughout Waits&#x27;s oeuvre, &quot;the theme of lowlife redemption, of escape, is ever-present.&quot;

Waits credits his wife with inspiration: &quot;She&#x27;s an opera buff and bug collector. And she&#x27;s done a lot of things. And she has dreams like Hieronymus Bosch. She writes more from her dreams, I wrote more from the world, or from the newspaper...And somehow it all works together.&quot; He credits her with helping him unify his eclectic musical interests: &quot;it&#x27;s really my wife that started helping me see that you can find the place where Lead Belly and Schoenberg overlap.&quot;

==Personal life==

During the 1970s, Waits had a brief relationship with comedian Elayne Boosler, an intermittent relationship with Bette Midler, and a relationship with Rickie Lee Jones.

In 1980, Waits married frequent collaborator Kathleen Brennan. They live in Sonoma County, California, and have three children: Kellesimone Wylder Waits (born 1983), Casey Waits (born 1985), and Sullivan Blake Waits (born 1993). After he married and had children, Waits became increasingly reclusive. Safeguarding the privacy of his family life became very important to him.

During interviews, he has deflected questions about his personal life, and refused to sanction any biography. When Barney Hoskyns was researching his unauthorized 2009 biography, &quot;Lowside of the Road: A Life of Tom Waits&quot;, Waits and his wife asked people not to talk to him. Hoskyns believed that it was Brennan who was responsible for the &quot;wall of inaccessibility&quot; surrounding Waits.

When asked about his religious beliefs, he noted: &quot;With the God stuff I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s out there any more than anyone else.&quot;

===Stage persona===
Waits has been determined to keep a distance between his public persona and his personal life. According to Hoskyns, Waits hides behind his persona, noting that &quot;Tom Waits is as much of a character created for his fans as it is a real man.&quot; In Hoskyns&#x27;s view, Waits&#x27;s self-image is in part &quot;a self-protective device, a screen to deflect attention.&quot; A few music journalists have gone so far as to suggest that Waits is a &quot;poseur&quot;. Hoskyns regarded Waits&#x27;s &quot;persona of the skid-row boho/hobo, a young man out of time and place&quot; as an &quot;ongoing experiment in performance art.&quot; He added that Waits has adopted a &quot;self-appointed role as the bard of the streets.&quot; Mick Brown, a music journalist from &quot;Sounds&quot; who interviewed Waits in the mid-1970s, noted that &quot;he had immersed himself in this character to the point where it &quot;wasn&#x27;t&quot; an act and had become an identity.&quot; Louie Lista, a friend of Waits&#x27;s during the 1970s, stated that the singer&#x27;s general attitude was that of &quot;I&#x27;m an outsider, but I&#x27;ll &quot;revel&quot; in being an outsider.&quot; In a similar manner to contemporaries like Bob Dylan and Neil Young, Waits is known for cutting contact with figures he worked with in his past.

Another friend from that period, Troubadour-manager Robert Marchese, related that Waits cultivated &quot;the whole mystique of this really funky dude and all that Charles Bukowski crap&quot; to give &quot;his impression of how funky poor folk really are,&quot; whereas in reality Waits was &quot;basically a middle-class, San Diego mom-and-pop-schoolteacher kid.&quot; Humphries thought that there was a &quot;conservative element&quot; to Waits&#x27;s persona, stating that behind his public image, &quot;Waits has always been more of a white-picket-fence kind of guy than you might imagine.&quot;

Jarmusch described Waits as &quot;a very contradictory character,&quot; stating that he is &quot;potentially violent if he thinks someone is &quot;screwing&quot; with him, but he&#x27;s gentle and kind too.&quot; Herbert Hardesty, who worked with Waits on &quot;Blue Valentine&quot;, called him &quot;a very pleasant human being, a very nice person.&quot; Humphries referred to him as &quot;an essentially reticent man ... reflective and surprisingly shy.&quot; He has a sense of humor and enjoys jokes. Hoskyns described Waits as &quot;unequivocally—some would say almost gruffly—heterosexual.&quot;

Hoskyns suggested that Waits has had an &quot;on-off affair with alcohol, never quite able to shake it off.&quot; During the 1970s, he was known as a heavy drinker and a smoker but avoided any drugs harder than cocaine. He told one interviewer, &quot;I discovered alcohol at an early age, and that guided me a lot.&quot; Humphries suggested that Waits&#x27;s use of alcohol as opposed to illicit drugs marked him out as being different from many of his contemporaries on the 1970s U.S. music scene.

During interviews, Waits has avoided questions about his personal life, gone off on tangents, and thrown in trivia. Humphries noted that Waits has often supplied interviewers with &quot;droll one-liners&quot;, something he termed &quot;Waitsisms&quot;, observing that the singer was &quot;dripping with wit and vinegar.&quot; Waits is known for getting irate with journalists.
He dislikes touring, but Hoskyns added that Waits has &quot;a strong work ethic&quot;.

Per his website&#x27;s description of &quot;Glitter and Doom Live&quot;, &quot;Disc One is designed to sound like one evening&#x27;s performance, even though the 17 tracks are selected from 10 cities, from Paris to Birmingham; Tulsa to Milan; and Atlanta to Dublin... Disc Two is a bonus compendium called TOM TALES, which is a selection of the comic bromides, strange musings, and unusual facts that Tom traditionally shares with his audience during the piano set. Waits&#x27; topics range from the rituals of insects to the last dying breath of Henry Ford.&quot; It adds &quot;he shifts seamlessly from an array of characters: carnival barker, preacher, country singer, soul balladeer; cabaret singer and storyteller.&quot;

In concert, Waits tended to wear all black. Humphries noted that &quot;on stage, Waits is a consummate performer, a raconteur of the recherché, and a genuine wit.&quot; Waits has stated that a performance should be &quot;a spectacle and entertaining&quot;. It was on his 1977 tour for &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; that he started employing props as part of his routine; one recurring prop was a megaphone through which he would shout at the audience.

===Collaborations===
Over the years, Waits has collaborated with various artists he admires. He toured with the saxophonist Teddy Edwards and played on his album &quot;Mississippi Lad&quot; (1991). Bruce Springsteen performed &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; with Waits on August 24, 1981, and included it on his retrospective &quot;Live/1975–85&quot;. In 1987, he joined Springsteen, Elvis Costello, k. d. lang and others in a tribute to Roy Orbison at Los Angeles&#x27;s Ambassador Hotel, filmed as &quot;Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night&quot;. Waits and Brennan wrote &quot;Strange Weather&quot; for Marianne Faithfull, which she sang on her album &quot;Strange Weather&quot; in 1987. Keith Richards played on &quot;Rain Dogs&quot;, &quot;Bone Machine&quot; and &quot;Bad as Me&quot;, and Waits and Richards recorded &quot;Shenandoah&quot; for &quot;Son of Rogues Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs &amp; Chanteys&quot; (2013). Richards said of Waits: “Tom’s music is so American. Probably more folk-American than anything, but somehow modern. He’s a weird mixture of stuff; a great bunch of guys!&quot; Waits wrote a poem, &quot;Burnt Toast to Keith&quot;, for Richards&#x27;s 80th birthday. Waits covered Kurt Weill’s &quot;What Keeps Mankind Alive?&quot; from &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; for Hal Willner&#x27;s Weill tribute album &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot; (1985) and &quot;Heigh Ho&quot; for his Disney-themed &quot;Stay Awake&quot; (1988). In 1991, he lent his voice to &quot;Tommy the Cat&quot; by Primus, and they appeared on &quot;Bone Machine&quot; and &quot;Mule Variations&quot;. Waits and Primus performed Jack Kerouac&#x27;s song &quot;On the Road&quot; on &quot;Jack Kerouac Reads On the Road&quot; (1999). The English composer Gavin Bryars visited Waits in 1993, and he added vocals to a re-release of Bryars&#x27;s &quot;Jesus&#x27; Blood Never Failed Me Yet&quot;, which was nominated for the Mercury Music Award. He sang with Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott on &quot;Louise (Tell It To Me)&quot; on his album &quot;Friends of Mine&quot; (1998). That year, Waits produced and funded Chuck E. Weiss&#x27;s album &quot;Extremely Cool&quot; as a favor to his old friend. He produced John P. Hammond&#x27;s &quot;Wicked Grin&quot; (2001) which consisted largely of covers of Waits songs, some written for the project. He covered &quot;Return of Jackie &amp; Judy&quot; for &quot;We&#x27;re a Happy Family: A Tribute to Ramones&quot; (2003). He appeared on Los Lobos&#x27;s &quot;The Ride&quot; (2004), Eels&#x27;s &quot;Blinking Lights and Other Revelations&quot; (2005) and Sparklehorse&#x27;s &quot;Dreamt for Light Years in the Belly of a Mountain&quot; (2006). Ken Nordine, whose &quot;word jazz&quot; influenced Waits, performed &quot;Circus&quot; for a video with animation by Joe Coleman. Waits was one of many guests on Dan Hicks&#x27;s &quot;Beatin&#x27; the Heat&quot; (2000). Hicks recalled: &quot;I made a list of people I thought were in a mutual admiration society. Most of the people, I found their phone numbers and called them. Tom Waits said he didn&#x27;t want to miss out on something like this. That was a pretty good compliment.&quot;

==Reception and legacy==
Bowman writes that &quot;At the dawn of the second decade of the 21st century, Waits’s influence can be seen in the work of many of the most forward-thinking contemporary artists, including Beck, PJ Harvey, and Radiohead’s Thom Yorke.” Other musicians who have expressed admiration for Waits&#x27;s work include Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, Nanci Griffith, Joe Strummer of the Clash, Michael Stipe of R.E.M., Frank Black of Pixies and James Hetfield of Metallica. Bob Dylan, a major influence on the young Waits, called Waits one of his &quot;secret heroes&quot;. Humphries described him as &quot;one of America&#x27;s finest post-Dylan singer-songwriters&quot; and, along with Edward Hopper, &quot;one of the two great depicters of American isolation.&quot; Hoskyns called him &quot;as important an American artist as anyone the twentieth century has produced.&quot; He notes that by the end of the twentieth century, &quot;Waits was an iconic alternative figure, not just to the fans who&#x27;d grown up with him but to subsequent generations of music geeks&quot;, coming to be &quot;universally acknowledged as an elder statesman of &#x27;alternative&#x27; rock.&#x27;&quot; Karen Schoemer of &quot;Newsweek&quot; said that &quot;to the postboomer generation, he&#x27;s more Dylan than Dylan. [His] melting-pot approach to Americana, his brilliant narratives and his hardiness against commercial trends have made him the ultimate icon for the alternative-minded.&quot; Steve Vai said: &quot;Tom Waits is my favorite artist now. I completely resonate deeply with his music, his voice and his lyrics; I buy everything he ever does. He&#x27;s one of those guys who are totally at one with the creative element with no excuses or concerns about what&#x27;s going on around him – totally uncompromising.&quot; When asked which song she wished she had written, Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine said: “‘Green Grass’ by Tom Waits... Really, anything by Tom Waits. I wish I was Tom Waits. His songs are so visceral and bloody. I just love his use of imagery.&quot; Bones Howe says: &quot;I do a lot of seminars. Occasionally I&#x27;ll do something for songwriters. They all say the same thing to me. &#x27;All the great lyrics are done.&#x27; And I say, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to give you a lyric that you never heard before&#x27;&quot;, the following from &quot;Tom Traubert&#x27;s Blues&quot;: &quot;A battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace / And a wound that will never heal.&quot; Howe calls this &quot;the work of an extremely talented lyricist, poet, whatever you want to say. That is brilliant, brilliant work. And he never mentions the person, but you see the person.&quot;

He was included on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s lists of 100 Greatest Singers and 100 Greatest Songwriters. In 2006, Waits and Brennan were ranked fourth on &quot;Paste&quot;&#x27;s list of the hundred greatest living songwriters. In 2016, Waits and Brennan, along with John Prine, were honored with The Song Lyrics of Literary Excellence Award from PEN New England. Colum McCann presented the honor to Waits and Brennan, saying “They find out what others have not quite fathomed yet. They catch the ordinary so that it can be sung extraordinarily in the future.”

Various artists have covered his songs. In 1973, Tim Buckley covered &quot;Martha&quot;, just like Meat Loaf did in 1995. The Eagles covered &quot;Ol&#x27; 55&quot; and Dion covered &quot;Heart of Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;San Diego Serenade&quot;. Rod Stewart had success with covers of &quot;Downtown Train&quot; and &quot;Tom Traubert&#x27;s Blues&quot;; Bob Seger covered &quot;Blind Love&quot;, &quot;New Coat of Paint&quot;, and &quot;Downtown Train&quot;. Paul Young covered &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Things&quot; on &quot;The Secret of Association&quot; (1985) and the Ramones covered &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Grow Up&quot; on their final album, &quot;¡Adios Amigos!&quot; (1995). Johnny Cash sang &quot;Down There by the Train&quot;, which Waits wrote for him, on &quot;American Recordings&quot; (1994), calling Waits &quot;a very special writer, my kind of writer.&quot; Tori Amos covered &quot;Time&quot; on &quot;Strange Little Girls&quot; (2001); she performed it on the &quot;Late Show With David Letterman&quot;, the first musical performance on the show after 9/11. Willie Nelson covered &quot;Picture in a Frame&quot; on &quot;It Always Will Be&quot; (2004). Holly Cole released an album of Waits covers, &quot;Temptation&quot; (1995), as did Scarlett Johansson with &quot;Anywhere I Lay My Head&quot; (2008). Neko Case performed &quot;Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis&quot; on the tribute album &quot;New Coat of Paint&quot; (2000). Norah Jones included a song Waits wrote for her, &quot;Long Way Home&quot;, on her album &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; (2004). Joan Baez covered his songs on &quot;Day After Tomorrow&quot; (2008) and &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot; (2018). Rosanne Cash, Aimee Mann, Phoebe Bridgers and others contributed to &quot;Come On Up to the House: Women Sing Waits&quot; (2019).

Waits has influenced artists in other fields. Kazuo Ishiguro recalls how Waits influenced his novel &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;: I thought I’d finished &quot;Remains&quot;, but then one evening heard Tom Waits singing his song &quot;Ruby’s Arms&quot;. It’s a ballad about a soldier leaving his lover sleeping in the early hours to go away on a train. Nothing unusual in that. But the song is sung in the voice of a rough American hobo type utterly unaccustomed to wearing his emotions on his sleeve. And there comes a moment, when the singer declares his heart is breaking, that’s almost unbearably moving because of the tension between the sentiment itself and the huge resistance that’s obviously been overcome to utter it. Waits sings the line with cathartic magnificence, and you feel a lifetime of tough-guy stoicism crumbling in the face of overwhelming sadness. I heard this and reversed a decision I’d made, that Stevens would remain emotionally buttoned up right to the bitter end. I decided that at just one point – which I’d have to choose very carefully – his rigid defence would crack, and a hitherto concealed tragic romanticism would be glimpsed.

Another author who notes Waits&#x27;s influence is Ian Rankin:I already knew Tom Waits’s music, those soulful communications from the louche underbelly of the American dream, but nothing had prepared me for &quot;Swordfishtrombones.&quot; I first heard it on a friend’s stereo system, the pair of us transfixed by what was happening in front of our ears. It felt to me as if a vaudeville show was taking place in a scrapyard, the music whirling and clanging, Waits presiding over it all like a bruised but keen-eyed master of ceremonies. &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; added extra textures and refinements, laying its (marked) cards on the table with its opening track, &quot;Singapore&quot;, a novel contained within two and a half minutes of controlled musical mayhem. By the time of its release I had left university and was trying to shape myself into a writer. I admired Waits’s lyrical vision and concision – the man was a born storyteller, stopping travellers who had wandered into the wrong part of town and compelling them with his words.

His songs have been used in film, television and theater. When the actor Robert Carlyle formed a theatre, he named it the Rain Dog Theatre after Waits&#x27;s album. Cabaret shows have been set to his songs, among them Robert Berdahl&#x27;s &quot;Warm Beer, Cold Women&quot; and Stewart D&#x27;Arrietta&#x27;s &quot;Belly of a Drunken Piano&quot;. In addition to scoring films for Bell, Coppola and Jarmusch, Waits has written songs for soundtracks: &quot;Never Let Go&quot; for &quot;American Heart&quot;; &quot;Walk Away&quot; and &quot;The Fall of Troy&quot; for &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; and &quot;Little Drop of Poison&quot; for &quot;The End of Violence&quot;, which later appeared in &quot;Shrek 2&quot;. &quot;Temptation&quot; and &quot;Cold Cold Ground&quot; appear in &quot;Léolo&quot;; &quot;Innocent When You Dream&quot; in &quot;Smoke&quot;; &quot;Goin&#x27; Out West&quot; in &quot;Fight Club&quot;; &quot;All The World is Green&quot; and &quot;Green Grass&quot; in &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot;. &quot;&quot; features &quot;What&#x27;s He Building?&quot;, &quot;Straight to the Top (Vegas)&quot;, &quot;Temptation&quot; and &quot;God&#x27;s Away on Business&quot;. The titles of the films &quot;Romeo Is Bleeding&quot; and &quot;Blue Valentine&quot; are derived from Waits songs. &quot;Hold On&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Grow Up&quot; were sung by Beth Greene (Emily Kinney) in &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; episodes &quot;I Ain&#x27;t a Judas&quot; and &quot;Infected&quot;, respectively. &quot;The Wire&quot; used &quot;Way Down in the Hole&quot; as its opening theme; each season featured a different rendition, including the Blind Boys of Alabama, Waits, the Neville Brothers, DoMaJe and Steve Earle. The season four rendition was arranged and recorded for the show and is performed by five Baltimore teenagers: Ivan Ashford, Markel Steele, Cameron Brown, Tariq Al-Sabir and Avery Bargasse. In 2014, Aaron Posner and the magician Teller directed a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; featuring songs by Waits and Brennan.

<text>Thomas Abel (or Abell) (ca. 1497 – 30 July 1540) was an English priest who was martyred during the reign of Henry VIII. The place and date of his birth are unknown.

He was educated at Oxford, where in 1516 he took the degree of Master of Arts, and subsequently acquired a doctorate in theology. He entered the service of Queen Catherine as her chaplain some time before 1528 and appears to have taught the queen modern languages and music. Catherine sent him to Spain in 1528 to the emperor Charles V on a mission relating to the proposed divorce. On his return she presented him with the parochial benefice of Bradwell, in Essex, and he remained to the last a staunch supporter of the unfortunate queen in the case of the validity of her marriage with Henry VIII.

In 1532, he published his &quot;Invicta veritas. An answere, That by no manner of law, it may be lawfull for the most noble King of England, King Henry the eight to be divorced from the queens grace, his lawfull and very wife. B.L.&quot;. Abel&#x27;s treatise was printed by Merten de Keyser in Antwerp with the fictitious pressmark of Luneberge, to avoid suspicion. The work contained an answer to the numerous tracts supporting Henry&#x27;s ecclesiastical claims. The king bought up copies of the book in order to destroy them.

For this he was thrown into the Beauchamp Tower in the Tower of London, and after a year&#x27;s liberation again imprisoned, in December 1533, on the charges of disseminating the prophecies of the Maid of Kent, encouraging the queen &quot;obstinately to persist in her wilful opinion against the same divorce and separation&quot;, and maintaining her right to the title of queen. He was kept in close confinement until his execution at Smithfield, two days after the execution of Thomas Cromwell. There is still to be seen on the wall of his prison in the Tower of London a rebus consisting of the symbol of a bell with an A upon it and the name Thomas above, which he carved during his confinement. There is extant a very pious Latin letter written by him to a fellow-martyr, and another to Cromwell, begging for some slight mitigation of his &quot;close prison&quot;; &quot;license to go to church and say Mass here within the Tower and for to lie in some house upon the Green&quot;. It is signed &quot;by your daily bedeman, Thomas Abell, priest&quot;.
His act of attainder states that he and three others &quot;have most traitorously adhered themselves unto the bishop of Rome, being a common enemy unto your Majesty and this your Realm, refusing your Highness to be our and their Supreme Head of this your Realm of England&quot;. Abel was sentenced to &quot;be drawn on a hurdle to the place of execution, there to be hanged, cut down alive, your members to be cut off and cast in the fire, your bowels burnt before your eyes, your head smitten off, your body to be quartered at the King&#x27;s will, and God have mercy on your soul.&quot;

==Veneration==
