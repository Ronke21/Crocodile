<text>A tetromino is a geometric shape composed of four squares, connected orthogonally (i.e. at the edges and not the corners). Tetrominoes, like dominoes and pentominoes, are a particular type of polyomino. The corresponding polycube, called a tetracube, is a geometric shape composed of four cubes connected orthogonally.

A popular use of tetrominoes is in the video game &quot;Tetris&quot; created by the Soviet game designer Alexey Pajitnov, which refers to them as tetriminos. The tetrominoes used in the game are specifically the one-sided tetrominoes.

==Types of tetrominoes==
===Free tetrominoes===
Polyominos are formed by joining unit squares along their edges. A free polyomino is a polyomino considered up to congruence. That is, two free polyominos are the same if there is a combination of translations, rotations, and reflections that turns one into the other. A free tetromino is a free polyomino made from four squares. There are five free tetrominoes.

The free tetrominoes have the following symmetry:
* Straight: vertical and horizontal reflection symmetry, and two-fold rotational symmetry
* Square: vertical and horizontal reflection symmetry, and four-fold rotational symmetry
* T: vertical reflection symmetry only
* L: no symmetry
* S: two-fold rotational symmetry only
&#x27;

=== One-sided tetrominoes ===
One-sided tetrominoes are tetrominoes that may be translated and rotated but not reflected. They are used by, and are overwhelmingly associated with, &quot;Tetris&quot;. There are seven distinct one-sided tetrominoes. These tetrominoes are named by the letter of the alphabet they most closely resemble. The &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, and &quot;T&quot; tetrominoes have reflectional symmetry, so it does not matter whether they are considered as free tetrominoes or one-sided tetrominoes. The remaining four tetrominoes, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot;, exhibit a phenomenon called chirality. J and L are reflections of each other, and S and Z are reflections of each other.

As free tetrominoes, J is equivalent to L, and S is equivalent to Z, but in two dimensions and without reflections, it is not possible to transform J into L or S into Z.
&#x27;

===Fixed tetrominoes===
The fixed tetrominoes allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. There are two distinct fixed I-tetrominoes, four J, four L, one O, two S, four T, and two Z, for a total of 19 fixed tetrominoes.
&#x27;

==Tiling a rectangle==
===Filling a rectangle with one set of tetrominoes===
A single set of free tetrominoes or one-sided tetrominoes cannot fit in a rectangle. This can be shown with a proof similar to the mutilated chessboard argument. A 5×4 rectangle with a checkerboard pattern has 20 squares, containing 10 light squares and 10 dark squares, but a complete set of free tetrominoes has either 11 dark squares and 9 light squares, or 11 light squares and 9 dark squares. This is due to the T tetromino having either 3 dark squares and one light square, or 3 light squares and one dark square, while all other tetrominoes each have 2 dark squares and 2 light squares. Similarly, a 7×4 rectangle has 28 squares, containing 14 squares of each shade, but the set of one-sided tetrominoes has either 15 dark squares and 13 light squares, or 15 light squares and 13 dark squares. By extension, any odd number of sets for either type cannot fit in a rectangle. Additionally, the 19 fixed tetrominoes cannot fit in a 4×19 rectangle. This was discovered by exhausting all possibilities in a computer search.
&#x27;

=== Parity ===
A further consequence of the T tetromino having 3 squares of one colour and 1 square of the other is that any rectangle containing an even number of squares must contain an even number of T tetrominos. Conversely, any rectangles containing an odd number of squares must contain an odd number of T tetrominos.

===Filling a modified rectangle with one set of tetrominoes===
All three sets of tetrominoes can fit rectangles with holes: 


===Filling a rectangle with two sets of tetrominoes===
Two sets of free or one-sided tetrominoes can fit into a rectangle in different ways, as shown below:
&#x27;

==Etymology==
The name &quot;tetromino&quot; is a combination of the prefix &quot;tetra-&quot; &#x27;four&#x27; (from Ancient Greek ), and &quot;domino&quot;. The name was introduced by Solomon W. Golomb in 1953 along with other nomenclature related to polyominos.

==Filling a box with tetracubes==
Each of the five free tetrominoes has a corresponding tetracube, which is the tetromino extruded by one unit.
J and L are the same tetracube, as are S and Z, because one may be rotated around an axis parallel to the tetromino&#x27;s plane to form the other. Three more tetracubes are possible, all created by placing a unit cube on the bent tricube:

The tetracubes can be packed into two-layer 3D boxes in several different ways, based on the dimensions of the box and criteria for inclusion. They are shown in both a pictorial diagram and a text diagram. For boxes using two sets of the same pieces, the pictorial diagram depicts each set as a lighter or darker shade of the same color. The text diagram depicts each set as having a capital or lower-case letter. In the text diagram, the top layer is on the left, and the bottom layer is on the right.

<doc id="30417" wikidata="Q1659295" url="?curid=30417" title="List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada">
<text>The following is a list of the highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada, a market known as the North American box office or, in the United States film industry, the domestic box office.

==Not adjusted for inflation==
This is a list of the highest-grossing films in the U.S. and Canada. The chart is ranked by lifetime gross, and for comparison, the figures adjusted for the effects of inflation are also listed, using the U.S. consumer price index; a film&#x27;s earnings from its initial release are also included to provide a basis for comparison between films released around the same time. Gross revenue is defined in US dollars.

 These films fall outside the top 100 when considering only initial gross, and would be replaced by &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; ($309.42m), and &quot;Independence Day&quot; ($306.16m).
==Adjusted for ticket-price inflation==
This chart ranks films by gross adjusted for ticket price inflation up to 2020 levels, based on data from Box Office Mojo, which was last updated in 2019 based on an average domestic movie ticket price of $9.01, and applying the for the following years up to 2024 levels, due to the lack of updates on the original source. It was compiled by multiplying the average ticket price in the current year by an estimate of the total number of admissions. Where the number of admissions is unknown, they are estimated by dividing the nominal gross by the average ticket price in the year of release to provide an estimate (taking re-releases into account). Admissions better reflect the popularity of older films, since they are less susceptible to the effects of inflation.

Many of the films on this list were released prior to the availability of home video and have had multiple releases.



===Factors in determining &quot;adjusted gross&quot;===
No one yet has calculated a truly precise and definite referential adjusted gross for a film, since doing so would have to take into account most (or all) of the following:
* Box office gross on &quot;initial&quot; release
* Ticket price at time of release, or its relative price to other commodities in a given year, in relation to general inflation and gross domestic product.
* Economic conditions that may help or hurt the entertainment industry as a whole (theaters in 2008 lowered ticket prices to attract more viewers though the average ticket cost $7.00)
* Population at time of release—to be used to calculate:
* Availability of films (number of theaters and screens, number of prints)
* Competition of other media (television, internet, home video, film piracy)
* Total number of films in the marketplace at a given time
* Screen quotas (no influence on U.S. box office)
* Price differences: matinee and evening tickets, roadshow tickets, or difference between rural and urban cinemas
* Length of release (number of weeks)

Further explanation of issues with calculating an adjusted gross can be found in the article for List of highest-grossing films.

<doc id="30418" wikidata="Q201873" url="?curid=30418" title="The Marriage of Figaro">
<text>The Marriage of Figaro (, ), K. 492, is a &quot;commedia per musica&quot; (opera buffa) in four acts composed in 1786 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, with an Italian libretto written by Lorenzo Da Ponte. It premiered at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 1 May 1786. The opera&#x27;s libretto is based on the 1784 stage comedy by Pierre Beaumarchais, &quot;La folle journée, ou le Mariage de Figaro&quot; (&quot;The Mad Day, or The Marriage of Figaro&quot;). It tells how the servants Figaro and Susanna succeed in getting married, foiling the efforts of their philandering employer Count Almaviva to seduce Susanna and teaching him a lesson in fidelity.

Considered one of the greatest operas ever written, it is a cornerstone of the repertoire and appears consistently among the top ten in the Operabase list of most frequently performed operas. In 2017, BBC News Magazine asked 172 opera singers to vote for the best operas ever written. &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; came in first out of the 20 operas featured, with the magazine describing the work as being &quot;one of the supreme masterpieces of operatic comedy, whose rich sense of humanity shines out of Mozart&#x27;s miraculous score&quot;.

==Composition history==
Beaumarchais&#x27;s earlier play &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; had already made a successful transition to opera in a version by Paisiello. Beaumarchais&#x27;s &quot;Mariage de Figaro&quot;, with its frank treatment of class conflict, was at first banned in Vienna: Emperor Joseph II stated that &quot;since the piece contains much that is objectionable, I therefore expect that the Censor shall either reject it altogether, or at any rate have such alterations made in it that he shall be responsible for the performance of this play and for the impression it may make&quot;, after which the Austrian Censor duly forbade performing the German version of the play. Mozart&#x27;s librettist managed to get official approval from the emperor for an operatic version, which eventually achieved great success.

The opera was the first of three collaborations between Mozart and Da Ponte, followed by &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;. It was Mozart who originally selected Beaumarchais&#x27;s play and brought it to Da Ponte, who turned it into a libretto in six weeks, rewriting it in poetic Italian and removing all of the original&#x27;s political references. In particular, Da Ponte replaced Figaro&#x27;s climactic speech against inherited nobility with an equally angry aria against unfaithful wives. The libretto was approved by the Emperor before any music was written by Mozart.

The Imperial Italian opera company paid Mozart 450 florins for the work; this was three times his meagre yearly salary when he had worked as a court musician in Salzburg. Da Ponte was paid 200 florins.

==Performance history==
&quot;Figaro&quot; premiered at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 1 May 1786, with a cast listed in the &quot;Roles&quot; section below. Mozart himself conducted the first two performances, conducting seated at the keyboard, the custom of the day. Later performances were conducted by Joseph Weigl. The first production was given eight further performances, all in 1786.

Although the total of nine performances was nothing like the frequency of performance of Mozart&#x27;s later success, &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, which for months was performed roughly every other day, the premiere is generally judged to have been a success. The applause of the audience on the first night resulted in five numbers being encored, seven on 8 May. Emperor Joseph, in charge of the Burgtheater, was concerned by the length of the performance and directed his aide as follows:

To prevent the excessive duration of operas, without however prejudicing the fame often sought by opera singers from the repetition of vocal pieces, I deem the enclosed notice to the public (that no piece for more than a single voice is to be repeated) to be the most reasonable expedient. You will therefore cause some posters to this effect to be printed.

The requested posters were printed up and posted in the Burgtheater in time for the third performance on 24 May.

The newspaper &quot;Wiener Realzeitung&quot; carried a review of the opera in its issue of 11 July 1786. It alludes to interference probably produced by paid hecklers, but praises the work warmly:
Mozart&#x27;s music was generally admired by connoisseurs already at the first performance, if I except only those whose self-love and conceit will not allow them to find merit in anything not written by themselves.

The &quot;public&quot;, however ... did not really know on the first day where it stood. It heard many a &quot;bravo&quot; from unbiased connoisseurs, but obstreperous louts in the uppermost storey exerted their hired lungs with all their might to deafen singers and audience alike with their &quot;St!&quot; and &quot;Pst&quot;; and consequently opinions were divided at the end of the piece.

Apart from that, it is true that the first performance was none of the best, owing to the difficulties of the composition.

But now, after several performances, one would be subscribing either to the &quot;cabal&quot; or to &quot;tastelessness&quot; if one were to maintain that Herr &quot;Mozart&#x27;s&quot; music is anything but a masterpiece of art.

It contains so many beauties, and such a wealth of ideas, as can be drawn only from the source of innate genius.

The Hungarian poet Ferenc Kazinczy was in the audience for a May performance, and later remembered the powerful impression the work made on him:
[Nancy] Storace [see below], the beautiful singer, enchanted eye, ear, and soul. – Mozart conducted the orchestra, playing his fortepiano; but the joy which this music causes is so far removed from all sensuality that one cannot speak of it. Where could words be found that are worthy to describe such joy?

Joseph Haydn appreciated the opera greatly, writing to a friend that he heard it in his dreams. In summer 1790 Haydn attempted to produce the work with his own company at Eszterháza, but was prevented from doing so by the death of his patron, Nikolaus Esterházy.

===Other early performances===

The Emperor requested a special performance at his palace theatre in Laxenburg, which took place in June 1786.

The opera was produced in Prague starting in December 1786 by the Pasquale Bondini company. This production was a tremendous success; the newspaper &quot;Prager Oberpostamtszeitung&quot; called the work &quot;a masterpiece&quot;, and said &quot;no piece (for everyone here asserts) has ever caused such a sensation.&quot; Local music lovers paid for Mozart to visit Prague and hear the production; he listened on 17 January 1787, and conducted it himself on the 22nd. The success of the Prague production led to the commissioning of the next Mozart/Da Ponte opera, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, premiered in Prague in 1787 (see Mozart and Prague).

The work was not performed in Vienna during 1787 or 1788, but starting in 1789 there was a revival production. For this occasion Mozart replaced both arias of Susanna with new compositions, better suited to the voice of Adriana Ferrarese del Bene who took the role. To replace &quot; he wrote &quot; – &quot;[come and fly] To the desire of [the one] who adores you&quot; (K. 577) in July 1789, and to replace &quot; he wrote &quot; – &quot;A joyous emotion&quot;, (K. 579), probably in mid-1790.

==Roles==
The voice types that appear in this table are those listed in the critical edition published in the &quot;Neue Mozart-Ausgabe&quot;. In modern performance practice, Cherubino and Marcellina are usually assigned to mezzo-sopranos, and Figaro to a bass-baritone.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; continues the plot of &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; several years later, and recounts a single &quot;day of madness&quot; () in the palace of Count Almaviva near Seville, Spain. Rosina is now the Countess. Dr. Bartolo is seeking revenge against Figaro for thwarting his plans to marry Rosina himself, and Count Almaviva has degenerated from the romantic youth of &quot;Barber&quot;, (a tenor in Paisiello&#x27;s 1782 opera), into a scheming, bullying, skirt-chasing baritone. Having gratefully given Figaro a job as head of his servant-staff, he is now persistently trying to exercise his &quot;droit du seigneur&quot; – his right to bed a servant girl on her wedding night – with Figaro&#x27;s bride-to-be, Susanna, who is the Countess&#x27;s maid. He keeps finding excuses to delay the civil part of the wedding of his two servants, which is arranged for this very day. Figaro, Susanna, and the Countess conspire to embarrass the Count and expose his scheming. He retaliates by trying to compel Figaro legally to marry a woman old enough to be his mother, but it turns out at the last minute that she really is his mother. Through the clever manipulations of Susanna and the Countess, Figaro and Susanna are finally able to marry.

:Place: Count Almaviva&#x27;s estate, Aguas-Frescas, three leagues outside Seville, Spain.

===Overture===

The overture is in the key of D major; the tempo marking is &quot;presto&quot;; i.e. quick. The work is well known and often played independently as a concert piece.

===Act 1===
&quot;A partly furnished room, with a chair in the centre.&quot;

Figaro happily measures the space where the bridal bed will fit while Susanna tries on her wedding bonnet (which she has sewn herself) in front of a mirror. (Duet: &quot;&quot; – &quot;Five, ten, twenty&quot;). Figaro is quite pleased with their new room; Susanna far less so (Duettino: &quot;&quot; – &quot;If the Countess should call you during the night&quot;). She is bothered by its proximity to the Count&#x27;s chambers: it seems he has been making advances toward her and plans on exercising his &quot;droit du seigneur&quot;, the feudal right of a lord to bed a servant girl on her wedding night before her husband can sleep with her. The Count had the right abolished when he married Rosina, but he now wants to reinstate it. The Countess rings for Susanna and she rushes off to answer. Figaro, confident in his own resourcefulness, resolves to outwit the Count (Cavatina: &quot;Se vuol ballare, Signor Contino&quot; – &quot;If you want to dance, Sir Count&quot;).

Figaro departs, and Dr. Bartolo arrives with Marcellina, his old housekeeper. Figaro had previously borrowed a large sum of money from her, and in lieu of collateral, had promised to marry her if unable to repay at the appointed time; she now intends to enforce that promise by suing him. Bartolo, seeking revenge against Figaro for having facilitated the union of the Count and Rosina (in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;), agrees to represent Marcellina &quot;pro bono&quot;, and assures her, in comical lawyer-speak, that he can win the case for her (aria: &quot;&quot; – &quot;Vengeance&quot;).

Bartolo departs, Susanna returns, and Marcellina and Susanna exchange very politely delivered sarcastic insults (duet: &quot;&quot; – &quot;After you, brilliant madam&quot;). Susanna triumphs in the exchange by congratulating her rival on her impressive age. The older woman departs in a fury.
Cherubino then arrives and after describing his emerging infatuation with all women, particularly with his &quot;beautiful godmother&quot; the Countess, (aria: &quot;&quot; – &quot;I don&#x27;t know anymore what I am&quot;) asks for Susanna&#x27;s aid with the Count. It seems the Count is angry with Cherubino&#x27;s amorous ways, having discovered him with the gardener&#x27;s daughter, Barbarina, and plans to punish him. Cherubino wants Susanna to ask the Countess to intercede on his behalf. When the Count appears, Cherubino hides behind a chair, not wanting to be seen alone with Susanna. The Count uses the opportunity of finding Susanna alone to step up his demands for favours from her, and offers to pay money if she will submit to him. As Basilio, the music teacher, arrives, the Count, not wanting to be caught alone with Susanna, hides behind the chair. Cherubino leaves that hiding place just in time, and jumps onto the chair while Susanna scrambles to cover him with a dress.

When Basilio starts to gossip about Cherubino&#x27;s obvious attraction to the Countess, the Count angrily leaps from his hiding place (terzetto: &quot;&quot; – &quot;What do I hear!&quot;). He disparages the &quot;absent&quot; page&#x27;s incessant flirting and describes how he caught him with Barbarina under the kitchen table. As he lifts the dress from the chair to illustrate how he had lifted the tablecloth to find Cherubino with Barbarina, he finds the very same Cherubino in the hiding spot. The Count is furious, but is reminded that the page overheard the Count&#x27;s advances on Susanna, information that the Count wants to keep from the Countess. The young man is ultimately saved from punishment by the entrance of the peasants of the Count&#x27;s estate, a preemptive attempt by Figaro to make the Count commit to a formal gesture symbolizing his promise that Susanna would enter into the marriage unsullied. The Count evades Figaro&#x27;s plan by postponing the gesture. The Count says that he forgives Cherubino, but he dispatches him to his own regiment in Seville for army duty, effective immediately. Figaro gives Cherubino mocking advice about his new, harsh, military life from which all luxury, and especially women, will be totally excluded (aria: &quot;Non più andrai&quot; – &quot;No more &quot;).

===Act 2===
&quot;A handsome room with an alcove, a dressing room on the left, a door in the background (leading to the servants&#x27; quarters) and a window at the side.&quot;
The Countess laments her husband&#x27;s infidelity (aria: &quot;Porgi, amor, qualche ristoro&quot; – &quot;Grant, love, some comfort&quot;). Susanna comes in to prepare the Countess for the day. She responds to the Countess&#x27;s questions by telling her that the Count is not trying to seduce her; he is merely offering her a monetary contract in return for her affection. Figaro enters and explains his plan to distract the Count with anonymous letters warning him of adulterers. He has already sent one to the Count (via Basilio) indicating that the Countess has a rendezvous of her own that evening. They hope that the Count will be too busy looking for imaginary adulterers to interfere with Figaro and Susanna&#x27;s wedding. Figaro additionally advises the Countess to keep Cherubino around. She should dress him up as a girl and lure the Count into an illicit rendezvous where he can be caught and embarrassed. Figaro leaves.

Cherubino arrives, sent in by Figaro. Susanna urges him to sing the song he wrote for the Countess (aria: &quot;Voi che sapete che cosa è amor&quot; – &quot;You ladies who know what love is, is it what I&#x27;m suffering from?&quot;). After the song, the Countess, seeing Cherubino&#x27;s military commission, notices that the Count was in such a hurry that he forgot to seal it with his signet ring (thus making it an official document).

Susanna and the Countess then begin with their plan. Susanna takes off Cherubino&#x27;s cloak, and she begins to comb his hair and teach him to behave and walk like a woman (aria of Susanna: &quot;Venite, inginocchiatevi&quot; – &quot;Come, kneel down before me&quot;). Then she leaves the room through a door at the back to get the dress for Cherubino, taking his cloak with her.

While the Countess and Cherubino are waiting for Susanna to come back, they suddenly hear the Count arriving. Cherubino quickly hides in the closet and locks the door. The Countess reluctantly lets the Count into her room. The Count hears a noise from the closet. The Countess tells him that Susanna is in the closet and that she cannot come out because she is trying on her wedding dress. At this moment, Susanna re-enters from another room, quickly realizes what&#x27;s going on, and hides before anyone can see her (Trio: &quot;Susanna, or via, sortite&quot; – &quot;Susanna, come out!&quot;). The Count shouts through the closet door for her to identify herself by her voice, but the Countess orders her to be silent. Furious and suspicious, the Count leaves with the Countess, in search of tools to force the closet door open. As they leave, he locks all the bedroom doors to prevent the intruder from escaping. Cherubino and Susanna emerge from their hiding places, and Cherubino escapes by jumping through the window into the garden. Susanna then takes Cherubino&#x27;s place in the closet, vowing to make the Count look foolish (duet: &quot;Aprite, presto, aprite&quot; – &quot;Open the door, quickly!&quot;).
The Count and Countess return. The Countess, thinking herself trapped, desperately admits that Cherubino is hidden in the closet. The enraged Count draws his sword, promising to kill Cherubino on the spot, but when the closet door is opened, to their astonishment, they only find Susanna (Finale: &quot;Esci omai, garzon malnato&quot; – &quot;Come out of there, you ill-born boy!&quot;). The Count demands an explanation; the Countess tells him it is a practical joke to test his trust in her. Shamed by his own jealousy, the Count pleads for forgiveness. When the Count presses about the anonymous letter, Susanna and the Countess reveal that the letter was written by Figaro, and then delivered by Basilio. Figaro then arrives and tries to start the wedding festivities, but the Count berates him with questions about the anonymous note. Just as the Count is starting to run out of questions, Antonio the gardener arrives, complaining that a man has jumped out of the window and damaged his carnations while running away. Antonio adds that he tentatively identified the running man as Cherubino, but Figaro claims it was he himself who jumped out of the window, and pretends to have injured his foot while landing. Figaro, Susanna, and the Countess attempt to discredit Antonio as a chronic drunkard whose constant inebriation makes him unreliable and prone to fantasy, but Antonio brings forward a paper, which, he says, was dropped by the escaping man. The Count orders Figaro to prove he was the jumper by identifying the paper (which is, in fact, Cherubino&#x27;s appointment to the army). Figaro is at a loss, but Susanna and the Countess manage to signal the correct answers, and Figaro triumphantly identifies the document. His victory is, however, short-lived: Marcellina, Bartolo, and Basilio enter, bringing charges against Figaro and demanding that he honor his contract to marry Marcellina, since he cannot repay her loan. The Count happily postpones the wedding in order to investigate the charge.

===Act 3===
&quot;A rich hall, with two thrones, prepared for the wedding ceremony.&quot;

The Count mulls over the confusing situation. At the urging of the Countess, Susanna enters and gives a false promise to meet the Count later that night in the garden (duet: &quot;Crudel! perchè finora&quot; – &quot;Cruel girl, why did you make me wait so long&quot;). As Susanna leaves, the Count overhears her telling Figaro that he has already won the case. Realizing that he is being tricked (recitative and aria: &quot;Hai già vinta la causa! ... Vedrò, mentr&#x27;io sospiro&quot; – &quot;You&#x27;ve already won the case!&quot; ... &quot;Shall I, while sighing, see&quot;), he resolves to punish Figaro by forcing him to marry Marcellina.
Figaro&#x27;s hearing follows, and the Count&#x27;s judgment is that Figaro must marry Marcellina. Figaro argues that he cannot get married without his parents&#x27; permission, and that he does not know who his parents are, because he was stolen from them when he was a baby. The ensuing discussion reveals that Figaro is Raffaello, the long-lost illegitimate son of Bartolo and Marcellina. A touching scene of reconciliation occurs. During the celebrations, Susanna enters with a payment to release Figaro from his debt to Marcellina. Seeing Figaro and Marcellina in celebration together, Susanna mistakenly believes that Figaro now prefers Marcellina to her. She has a tantrum and slaps Figaro&#x27;s face. Marcellina explains, and Susanna, realizing her mistake, joins the celebration. Bartolo, overcome with emotion, agrees to marry Marcellina that evening in a double wedding (sextet: &quot;Riconosci in questo amplesso&quot; – &quot;Recognize in this embrace&quot;).
All leave before Barbarina, Antonio&#x27;s daughter, invites Cherubino back to her house so they can disguise him as a girl. The Countess, alone, ponders the loss of her happiness (aria: &quot;Dove sono i bei momenti&quot; – &quot;Where are they, the beautiful moments&quot;). Meanwhile, Antonio informs the Count that Cherubino is not in Seville, but in fact at his house. Susanna enters and updates her mistress regarding the plan to trap the Count. The Countess dictates a love letter for Susanna to send to the Count, which suggests that he meet her (Susanna) that night, &quot;under the pines&quot;. The letter instructs the Count to return the pin that fastens the letter (duet: &quot;Sull&#x27;aria ... che soave zeffiretto&quot; – &quot;On the breeze... What a gentle little &quot;).

A chorus of young peasants, among them Cherubino disguised as a girl, arrives to serenade the Countess. The Count arrives with Antonio and discovering the page, is enraged. His anger is quickly dispelled by Barbarina, who publicly recalls that he had once offered to give her anything she wanted in exchange for certain favors, and asks for Cherubino&#x27;s hand in marriage. Thoroughly embarrassed, the Count allows Cherubino to stay.

The act closes with the double wedding, during the course of which Susanna delivers her letter to the Count (Finale: &quot;Ecco la marcia&quot; – &quot;Here is the procession&quot;). Figaro watches the Count prick his finger on the pin, and laughs, unaware that the love-note is an invitation for the Count to tryst with Figaro&#x27;s own bride Susanna. As the curtain drops, the two newlywed couples rejoice.

===Act 4===
&quot;The garden, with two pavilions. Night.&quot;

Following the directions in the letter, the Count has sent the pin back to Susanna, giving it to Barbarina. However, Barbarina has lost it (aria: &quot;L&#x27;ho perduta, me meschina&quot; – &quot;I have lost it, poor me&quot;). Figaro and Marcellina see Barbarina, and Figaro asks her what she is doing. When he hears the pin is Susanna&#x27;s, he is overcome with jealousy, especially as he recognises the pin as the one that fastened the letter to the Count. Thinking that Susanna is meeting the Count behind his back, Figaro complains to his mother, and swears to be avenged on the Count and Susanna, and on all unfaithful wives. Marcellina urges caution, but Figaro will not listen. Figaro rushes off, and Marcellina resolves to inform Susanna of Figaro&#x27;s intentions. Marcellina sings an aria lamenting that male and female wild beasts get along with each other, but rational humans can&#x27;t (aria: &quot;Il capro e la capretta&quot; – &quot;The billy-goat and the she-goat&quot;). (This aria and the subsequent aria of Basilio are mostly not performed; however, some recordings include them.)
Motivated by jealousy, Figaro tells Bartolo and Basilio to come to his aid when he gives the signal. Basilio comments on Figaro&#x27;s foolishness and claims he was once as frivolous as Figaro was. He tells a tale of how he was given common sense by &quot;Donna Flemma&quot; (&quot;Dame Prudence&quot;) and learned the importance of not crossing powerful people, (aria: &quot;In quegli anni&quot; – &quot;In those years&quot;). They exit, leaving Figaro alone. Figaro muses bitterly on the inconstancy of women (recitative and aria: &quot;Tutto è disposto ... Aprite un po&#x27; quegli occhi&quot; – &quot;Everything is ready ... Open those eyes a little&quot;). Susanna and the Countess arrive, each dressed in the other&#x27;s clothes. Marcellina is with them, having informed Susanna of Figaro&#x27;s suspicions and plans. After they discuss the plan, Marcellina and the Countess leave, and Susanna teases Figaro by singing a love song to her beloved within Figaro&#x27;s hearing (aria: &quot;Deh vieni non tardar&quot; – &quot;Oh come, don&#x27;t delay&quot;). Figaro is hiding behind a bush and, thinking the song is for the Count, becomes increasingly jealous.

The Countess arrives in Susanna&#x27;s dress. Cherubino shows up and starts teasing &quot;Susanna&quot; (really the Countess), endangering the plan. (Finale: &quot;Pian pianin le andrò più presso&quot; – &quot;Softly, softly I&#x27;ll approach her&quot;). The Count strikes out in the dark at Cherubino, but his punch hits Figaro and Cherubino runs off.

The Count now begins making earnest love to &quot;Susanna&quot; (really the Countess), and gives her a jeweled ring. They go offstage together, where the Countess dodges him, hiding in the dark. Onstage, meanwhile, the real Susanna enters, wearing the Countess&#x27;s clothes. Figaro mistakes her for the real Countess, and starts to tell her of the Count&#x27;s intentions, but he suddenly recognizes his bride in disguise. He plays along with the joke by pretending to be in love with &quot;my lady&quot;, and inviting her to make love right then and there. Susanna, fooled, loses her temper and slaps him many times. Figaro finally lets on that he has recognized Susanna&#x27;s voice, and they make peace, resolving to conclude the comedy together (&quot;Pace, pace, mio dolce tesoro&quot; – &quot;Peace, peace, my sweet treasure&quot;).

The Count, unable to find &quot;Susanna&quot;, enters frustrated. Figaro gets his attention by loudly declaring his love for &quot;the Countess&quot; (really Susanna). The enraged Count calls for his people and for weapons: his servant is seducing his wife. (Ultima scena: &quot;Gente, gente, all&#x27;armi, all&#x27;armi&quot; – &quot;Gentlemen, to arms!&quot;) Bartolo, Basilio and Antonio enter with torches as, one by one, the Count drags out Cherubino, Barbarina, Marcellina and the &quot;Countess&quot; from behind the pavilion.

All beg him to forgive Figaro and the &quot;Countess&quot;, but he loudly refuses, repeating &quot;no&quot; at the top of his voice, until finally the real Countess re-enters and reveals her true identity. The Count, seeing the ring he had given her, realizes that the supposed Susanna he was trying to seduce was actually his wife. He kneels and pleads for forgiveness, (&quot;Contessa perdono!&quot; – &quot;Countess, forgive me!&quot;). The Countess replies that she does forgive him (&quot;Più docile io sono e dico di sì&quot; – &quot;I am kinder [than you], and I say yes&quot;). Everyone declares that they will be happy with this (&quot;A tutti contenti saremo cosi&quot;), and set out to celebrate.

==Instrumentation==
&quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two clarini, timpani, and strings; the &quot;recitativi secchi&quot; are accompanied by a keyboard instrument, usually a fortepiano or a harpsichord, often joined by a cello. The instrumentation of the &quot;recitativi secchi&quot; is not given in the score, so it is up to the conductor and the performers. A typical performance lasts around three hours.

==Frequently omitted numbers==
Two arias from act 4 are often omitted: one in which Marcellina regrets that people (unlike goats, sheep, or wild beasts) abuse their mates (); and one in which Don Basilio tells how he saved himself from several dangers in his youth by using the skin of a donkey for shelter and camouflage ().

Mozart wrote two replacement arias for Susanna when the role was taken over by Adriana Ferrarese in the 1789 revival. The replacement arias, &quot;Un moto di gioia&quot; (replacing &quot;Venite, inginocchiatevi&quot; in act 2) and &quot;Al desio di chi t&#x27;adora&quot; (replacing &quot;Deh vieni non tardar&quot; in act 4), in which the two clarinets are replaced with basset horns, are normally not used in modern performances. A notable exception was a series of performances at the Metropolitan Opera in 1998 with Cecilia Bartoli as Susanna.

==Critical discussion==

Lorenzo Da Ponte wrote a preface to the first published version of the libretto, in which he boldly claimed that he and Mozart had created a new form of music drama:
In spite ... of every effort ... to be brief, the opera will not be one of the shortest to have appeared on our stage, for which we hope sufficient excuse will be found in the variety of threads from which the action of this play &quot;[i.e. Beaumarchais&#x27;s]&quot; is woven, the vastness and grandeur of the same, the multiplicity of the musical numbers that had to be made in order not to leave the actors too long unemployed, to diminish the vexation and monotony of long recitatives, and to express with varied colours the various emotions that occur, but above all in our desire to offer as it were a new kind of spectacle to a public of so refined a taste and understanding.

Charles Rosen, in &quot;The Classical Style&quot;, proposes to take Da Ponte&#x27;s words quite seriously, noting the &quot;richness of the ensemble writing&quot;, which carries forward the action in a far more dramatic way than recitatives would. Rosen also suggests that the musical language of the classical style was adapted by Mozart to convey the drama; many sections of the opera resemble sonata form. By movement through a sequence of keys, they build up and resolve musical tension, providing a natural musical reflection of the drama. As Rosen writes:
The synthesis of accelerating complexity and symmetrical resolution which was at the heart of Mozart&#x27;s style enabled him to find a musical equivalent for the great stage works which were his dramatic models. &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; in Mozart&#x27;s version is the dramatic equal, and in many respects the superior, of Beaumarchais&#x27;s work.

This is demonstrated in the closing numbers of all four acts: as the drama escalates, Mozart eschews &quot;recitativi&quot; altogether and opts for increasingly sophisticated writing, bringing his characters on stage, revelling in a complex weave of solo and ensemble singing in multiple combinations, and climaxing in seven- and eight-voice tutti for acts 2 and 4. The finale of act 2, lasting 20 minutes, is one of the longest uninterrupted pieces of music Mozart ever wrote. Eight of the opera&#x27;s 11 characters appear on stage in its more than 900 bars of continuous music.

Mozart uses the sound of two horns playing together to represent cuckoldry in the act 4 aria &quot;. Verdi later used the same device in Ford&#x27;s aria in &quot;Falstaff&quot;.

Johannes Brahms said &quot;In my opinion, each number in &quot;Figaro&quot; is a miracle; it is totally beyond me how anyone could create anything so perfect; nothing like it was ever done again, not even by Beethoven.&quot;

==Other uses of the melodies==
A musical phrase from the act 1 trio of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (where Basilio sings &quot;&quot;) was later reused by Mozart in the overture to his opera &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;. Mozart also quotes Figaro&#x27;s aria &quot;Non più andrai&quot; in the second act of his opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. Further, Mozart used it in 1791 in his Five Contredanses, K. 609, No. 1. Mozart reused the music of the &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; of his earlier (&quot;Coronation Mass&quot;) for the Countess&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, in C major instead of the original F major. Mozart also reused the motif that begins his early bassoon concerto in another aria sung by the Countess, &quot;Porgi, amor&quot;. Beethoven wrote , WoO 40, for violin and piano on Figaro&#x27;s cavatina. Ferdinand Ries used music from the opera in his , Op. 77. Moscheles used the duettino &quot;Crudel! perchè finora&quot; in his for piano, Op. 72/4. Johann Nepomuk Hummel quoted it in his , Op. 124. Franz Liszt quoted the opera in his &quot;Fantasy on Themes from Mozart&#x27;s Figaro and Don Giovanni&quot; S. 697.

In 1819, Henry R. Bishop wrote an adaptation of the opera in English, translating from Beaumarchais&#x27;s play and re-using some of Mozart&#x27;s music, while adding some of his own.

In his 1991 opera, &quot;The Ghosts of Versailles&quot;, which includes elements of Beaumarchais&#x27;s third &quot;Figaro&quot; play (&quot;La Mère coupable&quot;) and in which the main characters of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; also appear, John Corigliano quotes Mozart&#x27;s opera, especially the overture, several times.

<doc id="30423" wikidata="Q125603" url="?curid=30423" title="The Clash">
<text>The Clash were an English rock band formed in London in 1976. Billed as &quot;The Only Band That Matters&quot;, they are considered one of the most influential acts in the original wave of British punk rock, with their music fusing elements of reggae, dub, funk, ska, and rockabilly. The band also contributed to the and new wave movements that followed. For most of their recording career, the Clash consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Joe Strummer, lead guitarist and vocalist Mick Jones, bassist Paul Simonon, and drummer Nicky &quot;Topper&quot; Headon.

The Clash achieved critical and commercial success in the United Kingdom with the release of their debut album &quot;The Clash&quot; (1977) and their second album &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot; (1978). Their experimental third album &quot;London Calling&quot;, which was released in the UK in December 1979, earned them popularity in the United States, where it was released the following month. A decade later, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;London Calling&quot; the best album of the 1980s. Following continued musical experimentation on their fourth album &quot;Sandinista!&quot; (1980), the band achieved further commercial success with the release of &quot;Combat Rock&quot; (1982), which includes the US top-10 hit &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot;, helping the album to achieve a 2× platinum certification there.

In 1982, Headon left the band due to internal friction surrounding his increasing heroin addiction, and Jones departed the following year. With a new lineup, the band released their final album &quot;Cut the Crap&quot; in 1985 before disbanding a few weeks later.

In January 2003, shortly after the death of Joe Strummer, the band, including original drummer Terry Chimes, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the Clash number 28 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.

==History==

===Origins: 1974–1976===
Before the Clash&#x27;s founding, the band&#x27;s future members were active in different parts of the London music scene. Joe Strummer, whose real name was John Graham Mellor, sang and played rhythm guitar in the pub rock band The 101ers, which he had formed in 1974 with Alvaro Pena-Rojas. Mellor later abandoned his original stage name &quot;Woody&quot; Mellor in favour of &quot;Joe Strummer&quot;, a reference to his rudimentary strumming skills on the ukulele while he was a busker in the London Underground.

Mick Jones played guitar in protopunk band London SS and rehearsed for much of 1975, but never played a live show and recorded only one demo. London SS were managed by Bernard Rhodes, an associate of impresario Malcolm McLaren and a friend of the members of the Sex Pistols, whom McLaren managed. Jones and his bandmates became friendly with Sex Pistols members Glen Matlock and Steve Jones, who helped them as they auditioned potential new members. Bassist Paul Simonon and drummer Terry Chimes auditioned for London SS but were rejected, and Nicky Headon drummed with the band for a week then quit.

After London SS broke up in early 1976, Rhodes continued as Jones&#x27; manager. In February, Jones saw the Sex Pistols perform for the first time and commented: &quot;You knew straight away that was it, and this was what it was going to be like from now on. It was a new scene, new values—so different from what had happened before. A bit dangerous.&quot; In March of that year, at the instigation of Rhodes, Jones contacted Simonon and suggested he learn an instrument so he could join the new band Jones was organising. Soon Jones, Simonon on bass, Keith Levene on guitar and &quot;whoever we could find really to play the drums&quot; were rehearsing. Chimes was asked to audition for the new band and was accepted but quit soon after.

The band were still searching for a lead singer. According to Chimes, Billy Watts, who &quot;seemed to be, like, nineteen or eighteen then, as we all were&quot;, handled the duties for a time. Rhodes was watching Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact; both Jones and Levene had seen Strummer perform and were impressed. In April, Strummer saw the Sex Pistols open for one of his band&#x27;s gigs. Strummer later said:
I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, &quot;Hello, you bunch of drunks, I&#x27;m gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them.&quot; The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, &quot;Here&#x27;s our tunes, and we couldn&#x27;t give a flying fuck whether you like them or not. In fact, we&#x27;re gonna play them even if you fucking hate them.&quot;

On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene approached Strummer after a 101ers gig and invited him to meet up at the band&#x27;s rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene played &quot;Keys to Your Heart&quot;, one of Strummer&#x27;s own tunes. Rhodes gave Strummer 48 hours to decide whether to join the new band that would &quot;rival the Pistols&quot;. Within 24 hours, he agreed. Simonon later said: &quot;Once we had Joe on board it all started to come together&quot;. Strummer introduced the band to his school friend Pablo LaBritain, who sat in on drums during Strummer&#x27;s first few rehearsals with the band. LaBritain left the band shortly after and joined 999. Terry Chimes, whom Jones later referred to as &quot;one of the best drummers&quot; in their circle, became the band&#x27;s regular drummer.

In &quot;Westway to the World&quot;, Jones said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think Terry was officially hired or anything. He had just been playing with us.&quot; Chimes did not like Strummer at first, saying: &quot;He was like twenty-two or twenty-three or something that seemed &#x27;old&#x27; to me then. And he had these retro clothes and this croaky voice.&quot; Simonon thought of the band&#x27;s name; they had briefly named themselves the Weak Heartdrops and the Psychotic Negatives. According to Simonon: &quot;It really came to my head when I started reading the newspapers and a word that kept recurring was the word &#x27;clash&#x27;, so I thought &#x27;the Clash, what about that&#x27; to the others. And they and Bernard, they went for it.&quot;

===Early gigs and the growing scene: 1976===
After rehearsing with Strummer for less than a month, the Clash made their debut performance on 4 July 1976, supporting the Sex Pistols at the Black Swan nightclub in Sheffield. The Clash wanted to appear on stage before their rivals The Damned, another London SS spinoff, made their own scheduled debut two days later. The Clash did not play in front of another audience for five weeks. Levene was becoming disaffected with his position in the group. At the Black Swan, he approached the Sex Pistols&#x27; lead singer John Lydon, whose stage name was Johnny Rotten, and suggested they form a band together if the Pistols broke up.

Hours after their debut, the Clash, most of the Sex Pistols and much of London&#x27;s &quot;inner circle&quot; of punks attended a performance by New York City&#x27;s leading punk rock band the Ramones at Dingwalls; according to Strummer: &quot;It can&#x27;t be stressed how great the first Ramones album was to the scene ... It was the first word of Punk, a fantastic record&quot;. Afterwards &quot;came the first example of the rivalry-induced squabbling that was to dog the punk scene and undermine any attempts to promote a spirit of unity among the bands involved&quot;. Simonon fought with J.J. Burnel, the bass player of The Stranglers, a slightly older band who were publicly identified with the punk scene but were not part of the &quot;inner circle&quot;, which centered on the Sex Pistols.

Rhodes insisted the Clash should not perform live again until they were much tighter so they intensely rehearsed the following month. According to Strummer, the band devoted themselves to creating a distinct identity, saying:The day I joined The Clash was very much back to square one, year zero. Part of Punk was that you had to shed all of what you knew before. We were almost Stalinist in the way that you had to shed all your friends, or everything that you&#x27;d known, or every way that you&#x27;d played before.

Strummer and Jones shared most of the writing duties; according to Jones: &quot;Joe would give me the words and I would make a song out of them&quot;. The band sometimes met in the office over their Camden Town rehearsal studio. According to Strummer: &quot;Bernie [Rhodes] would say, &#x27;An issue, an issue. Don&#x27;t write about love, write about what&#x27;s affecting you, what&#x27;s important.&quot; Jones&#x27;s later said: &quot;Bernie had a hand in everything. Not the lyrics—he didn&#x27;t help with the lyrics. He didn&#x27;t tell us not to write love songs, as the myth goes—that&#x27;s kind of simplified version of it. He told us to write what we knew about&quot;.

Strummer performed lead vocals on the majority of songs but he and Jones sometimes shared the lead. Once the band began recording, Jones rarely had a solo lead on more than one song per album, though he was responsible for two of the group&#x27;s biggest hits. On 13 August 1976, the Clash, wearing paint-spattered &quot;Jackson Pollock&quot; outfits, played in their Camden studio before a small, invitation-only audience, which included &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine critic Giovanni Dadamo, whose review described the band as a &quot;runaway train ... so powerful, they&#x27;re the first new group to come along who can really scare the Sex Pistols shitless&quot;.

On 29 August, the Clash and Manchester&#x27;s Buzzcocks opened for the Sex Pistols at The Screen on the Green; it was the Clash&#x27;s first public performance since 4 July. The triple-bill show is seen as pivotal to the consolidation of the British punk scene into a movement; &quot;New Musical Express&quot; reviewer Charles Shaar Murray wrote: &quot;The Clash are the sort of garage band that should be speedily returned to the garage, preferably with the motor still running&quot;. Strummer later credited Murray&#x27;s comments with inspiring the Clash&#x27;s song &quot;Garageland&quot;.

In early September, Levene was fired from the Clash. According to Strummer, Levene&#x27;s dwindling interest in the band was due to his use of speed, a point Levene denied. On 21 September 1976, the Clash performed publicly for the first time without Levene at the 100 Club Punk Special, sharing the bill with the Sex Pistols, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect. Chimes left in late November; he was briefly replaced by Rob Harper as the Clash toured in support of the Sex Pistols during December&#x27;s Anarchy Tour.

The Clash promoted a left-wing message in their songs and interviews, and sang about social problems, such as career opportunities, unemployment, and the need for a backlash against racism and oppression. Joe Strummer said in 1976: &quot;We&#x27;re anti-fascist, we&#x27;re anti-violence, we&#x27;re anti-racist and we&#x27;re pro-creative&quot;. Strummer also said: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in all that anarchy bollocks!&quot; According to the Clash guitarist Mick Jones: &quot;The important thing is to encourage people to do things for themselves, think for themselves and stand up for what their rights are&quot;.

A confrontation between Black youth and police at the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival was important in the development of the Clash&#x27;s political stance and inspired Joe Strummer to write &quot;White Riot&quot;. Images of the riots were used as The Clash&#x27;s stage backdrop and as the back cover of their first album, and was reprinted on badges and Clash t-shirts.

===Punk breakthrough and UK fame: 1977–1979===

By January 1977, punk had become a major media phenomenon in the UK; according to &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (NME): &quot;1977 is the year of The Clash&quot;. On 25 January, the band signed to CBS Records for £100,000, a remarkable amount for a band who had played about thirty gigs and very few headlining shows. Clash historian Marcus Gray said: &quot;the band members found themselves having to justify [the deal] to both the music press and to fans who picked up on the critics&#x27; muttered asides about the Clash having &#x27;sold out&#x27; to the establishment&quot;. Mark Perry, founder of the leading London punk periodical &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot; wrote: &quot;Punk died the day the Clash signed to CBS&quot;, but recanted when he first heard the single &quot;White Riot&quot;, saying: &quot;They&#x27;re the most important group in the world at the moment. I believe in them completely. All I said about them is crap.&quot; According to one of the band&#x27;s associates the deal &quot;was later used as a classic example of the kind of contract that no group should ever sign—the group had to pay for their own tours, recordings, remixes, artwork, expenses ...&quot; According to Strummer in March 1977:

Mickey Foote, who worked as a technician at the band&#x27;s concerts, was hired to produce their debut album, and Terry Chimes was drafted back for the recording. The band&#x27;s first single &quot;White Riot&quot; was released in March and peaked at number 34 in the UK Singles Chart. The album &quot;The Clash&quot; was released the following month and peaked at number 12 on the UK Albums Chart; with lyrics criticising the ruling establishment, bosses and the police and addressing themes such as alienation and boredom.

&quot;The Clash&quot; presaged the band&#x27;s future works with their cover of the reggae song &quot;Police and Thieves&quot;. The band had been influenced by the subject matter, slogans and lyrics of reggae, which they often played in rehearsals but recording &quot;Police and Thieves&quot; was an important step that was only taken after a lot of discussion within the group.

According to music journalist and former punk musician John Robb: &quot;Amidst the Sex Pistols&#x27; inertia in the first half of 1977, the Clash found themselves as the flag-wavers of the punk rock consciousness&quot;. Though &quot;The Clash&quot; quickly rose to number 12 in the UK, CBS refused to give it a US release, believing that its raw, barely produced sound would make it unmarketable there. A North American version of the album with a modified track listing was released in the US in 1979 after the UK release had become the US&#x27;s best-selling import album of the year.

Chimes, whose career aspirations owed little to the punk ethos, left the band again soon after the recording sessions. He later said: &quot;The point was I wanted one kind of life and they wanted another and, like, why are we working together, if we want completely different things?&quot; As a result, only Simonon, Jones and Strummer are featured on the album&#x27;s cover, and Chimes was credited as &quot;Tory Crimes&quot;. Strummer later said: &quot;We must have tried every drummer that then had a kit. I mean every drummer in London. I think we counted 205. And that&#x27;s why we were lost until we found Topper Headon.&quot; Simonon nicknamed Headon, who had briefly played with Jones&#x27;s band London SS, &quot;Topper&quot; because he felt Headon resembled Mickey the Monkey, a character in the comic &quot;Topper&quot;. Headon could also play piano, bass and guitar. The day after he signed to the band, Headon said: &quot;I really wanted to join the Clash. I want to give them even more energy than they&#x27;ve got—if that&#x27;s possible&quot;; in an interview over twenty years later, he said his original plan was to stay briefly, gain a name for himself, and then move on to a better gig. Strummer later said: &quot;Finding someone who not only had the chops, but the strength and the stamina to do it was just the breakthrough for us&quot;.

In May, The Clash set out on the White Riot Tour, headlining a punk package that included Buzzcocks, The Jam, Subway Sect, The Slits and The Prefects. The day after a Newcastle gig, Strummer and Headon were arrested for stealing pillowcases from their hotel room. The highlight of the tour was the Rainbow Theatre in London on 9 May; it was the first time The Clash had played a major music venue. The audience began ripping up seats and the gig turned into a riot. &quot;The Sun&quot; reported the violence with the front-page headline &quot;Punk Wreck&quot;.&quot;New Musical Express,&quot; while expressing serious concerns over the violence, said: &quot;The Clash are probably the best band in the country right now&quot;. Strummer commented: &quot;That was the night punk broke ... we were in the right place doing the right thing at the right time&quot;.

That same month, CBS released &quot;Remote Control&quot; as &quot;The Clash&quot; second single, defying the wishes of the band, who saw it as one of the album&#x27;s weakest tracks. Headon&#x27;s first recording with the band was the single &quot;Complete Control&quot;, which addresses the band&#x27;s anger at their record label&#x27;s behaviour. It was co-produced by reggae artist Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, though Foote was summoned to &quot;ground things&quot;. The single was released in September 1977 and &quot;NME&quot; commented that CBS had allowed the group to &quot;bait their masters&quot;. The single peaked at number 28 on the UK chart and has been cited as one of punk&#x27;s greatest singles.

In October 1977, the Clash set out on the &quot;Out of Control&quot; UK tour. The tour was due to open at the Ulster Hall, Belfast but the insurance was pulled and the gig was cancelled at the last moment. This led to punks blocking the road outside the venue and a confrontation between the punks and the police, which became known as the &quot;Battle of Bedford Street&quot;.

In February 1978, the Clash released the single &quot;Clash City Rockers&quot;; and played the song live, along with &quot;Tommy Gun&quot;, on BBC television&#x27;s youth show &quot;Something Else&quot;. On 30 April, the Clash played at Rock Against Racism in Victoria Park, London. Late 1970s England had seen an increase in racist attacks and a growth in support for the far-right political party The National Front. Also on the bill were X-Ray Spex, Steel Pulse, Misty in Roots, and headliners Tom Robinson Band; they played to 100,000 people, who marched through London and attended the RAR Carnival.

In June, the band released &quot;(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais&quot; as a single, which peaked at number 32 in the UK Singles chart; it quickly became a favourite with Clash fans and was voted single of the year in the 1978 &quot;NME&quot; Readers&#x27; Poll.

Before the Clash began recording their second album, CBS requested they adopt a cleaner sound than its predecessor to reach American audiences. Sandy Pearlman, who is known for his work with Blue Öyster Cult, was hired to produce the record. Simonon later said: &quot;[R]ecording that album was just the most boring situation ever. It was just so nitpicking, such a contrast to the first album ... it ruined any spontaneity.&quot; Strummer said: &quot;it wasn&#x27;t our easiest session&quot;. The band dismissed their manager Bernie Rhodes and hired journalist Caroline Coon to replace him.

The album &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot; was released in early November 1978, and received mixed reviews in the UK music press, where some reviewers complained about its relatively mainstream production style. The album reached number 2 in the UK album chart. &quot;NME&quot; readers voted &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot; the second-best album of 1978 and the Clash were voted the best group in the same end-of-year poll. In the US, the album peaked at number 128 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

&quot;Tommy Gun&quot;, the album&#x27;s first UK single, peaked at number 19, the highest chart position for a Clash single to date. To accompany the single, the band produced their first official music video, in which Joe Strummer wears an H Block T-shirt in support of the campaign for political status for Irish Republican prisoners. The band embarked on a North American tour, culminating in a performance at the Palladium in New York City.

&quot;English Civil War&quot;, which warned against the rise of the far-right in the UK, was released as the album&#x27;s second single in February 1979, reaching number 25 in the UK Singles Chart. The B-side is a cover of the Toots and the Maytals&#x27; song &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, once again illustrating the group&#x27;s reggae influences.

In support of the album, the Clash toured the UK supported by the Slits and the Innocents. The tour, which consisted of more than thirty shows, was promoted as the Sort It Out Tour. The band later undertook their first, largely successful tour of North America in February 1979.

In June 1979, the band released the Extended Play (EP) &quot;The Cost of Living&quot;, which includes a cover of Bobby Fuller&#x27;s song &quot;I Fought the Law&quot;, two original songs and a re-recording of &quot;Capital Radio&quot;. The EP reached 22 in the UK charts and the band dismissed Coon as their manager. They then embarked on a second tour of the US, adding Mick Gallagher on keyboards.

===Changing style and US breakthrough: 1979–1982===
In August and September 1979, The Clash recorded the double album &quot;London Calling&quot;, which Guy Stevens, a former A&amp;R executive who had worked with Mott the Hoople and Traffic, produced. The double album was a mix of punk rock, reggae, ska, rockabilly and traditional rock and roll. It is regarded as one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded. In the US, the single &quot;Train in Vain&quot; became their first top-40 hit, peaking at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. In the UK, the title track was released as a single and peaked at number 11—the highest position any Clash single reached in the UK before the band&#x27;s break-up.

&quot;London Calling&quot; was released in December 1979; it peaked at number 9 on the British album chart and at number 27 in the United States, where it was issued in January 1980. The album&#x27;s cover photograph by Pennie Smith became one of the most-recognisable images and &quot;Q&quot; magazine later cited it as the &quot;best rock &#x27;n roll photograph of all time&quot;. During this period, The Clash began to be regularly billed as &quot;The Only Band That Matters&quot;. Musician Gary Lucas, who was employed by CBS Records&#x27; creative services department, has said he coined the tagline. Fans and journalists soon widely adopted the epithet.

At the end of 1979, the band members attended a private screening of a new film called &quot;Rude Boy&quot;, which is part fiction and tells the story of a Clash fan who leaves his job in a Soho sex shop to become a roadie for the group. The movie, which was named after the rude boy subculture, includes footage of the band on tour, at a London Rock Against Racism concert, and in the studio recording &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot;. The band were disenchanted with the film so they had Better Badges make badges that said: &quot;I don&#x27;t want RUDE BOY Clash Film&quot;. On 27 February 1980, the film premiered at the 30th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won an honourable mention.

The Clash had planned to record and release a single every month in 1980. CBS dismissed this idea and the band released only one single—an original reggae song called &quot;Bankrobber&quot;, in August. It featured Mikey Dread and reached number 12 in the UK Singles Chart. In October, the band&#x27;s US record company released a B-side compilation EP called &quot;Black Market Clash&quot;, which was later re-released in expanded form as a full-length album.

In December 1980, The Clash released the 36-song triple album &quot;Sandinista!&quot;, which again reflected a broad range of musical styles. It was produced by the band members with further participation of Mikey Dread. &quot;Sandinista!&quot; proved to be controversial, both politically and musically. Critical opinions were divided; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; writer Ira Robbins described half of the album as &quot;great&quot; and the other half as &quot;nonsense&quot; and worse, while &quot;New Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; critic Dave Marsh said: &quot;&quot;Sandinista!&quot; is nonsensically cluttered. Or rather &quot;seems&quot; nonsensically cluttered. One of the Clash&#x27;s principal concerns ... is to avoid being stereotyped.&quot; The album sold reasonably well in the US, where it charted at number 24. In the UK, the album peaked at number 19 and the single &quot;The Call Up&quot; charted at number 40. In January 1980, Rhodes was reinstated as the band&#x27;s manager and the single &quot;Hitsville UK&quot; reached number 54 in the UK Singles Chart while &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; charted at number 34, and the band spent most of the year touring.

In December 1981, the Clash released &quot;This Is Radio Clash&quot; as a single; it charted at number 47 in the UK Singles Chart. In September 1981, the band began work on their fifth album &quot;Combat Rock&quot;, which Glyn Johns produced and was released in May 1982. In the UK, the first single &quot;Know Your Rights&quot; reached number 43. The lead single in the US was &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot;, which was released in June 1982 and received significant airplay on Album-oriented rock (AOR) stations. The follow-up single &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; was composed by Headon, who performed the percussion, piano and bass on the track. It became the band&#x27;s biggest US hit, charting at number eight while the album reached number two in the UK and number seven in the US.

===Disintegration and break up: 1982–1986===

After the release of &quot;Combat Rock&quot;, the Clash began to disintegrate. In May 1982, Headon was asked to leave the band because his addiction caused reliability problems. Chimes was brought back to drum for the next few months. The band opened for The Who on a leg of their final US tour that included a show at New York&#x27;s Shea Stadium.

Chimes left the band after the Combat Rock Tour and was replaced with Pete Howard in May 1983. The Clash co-headlined the US Festival in San Bernardino, California, on 28 May in front of a crowd of 140,000. After the show, members of the band brawled with security staff. The festival was Jones&#x27; last appearance with the band; Strummer and Simonon dismissed him in September that year. Nick Sheppard, formerly of the Bristol-based band The Cortinas, and Vince White were recruited as the Clash&#x27;s new guitarists. The band&#x27;s new lineup played their first shows in January 1984 with a batch of new material and embarked on the self-financed Out of Control Tour, travelling widely over the winter and into early summer. The band also headlined a benefit show for striking miners.

In November 1985, they released the album &quot;Cut the Crap&quot;; it includes the single &quot;This Is England&quot;, which charted at number 24 in the UK Singles Chart. Strummer later noted: &quot;CBS had paid an advance for it so they had to put it out&quot;. Dave Marsh later listed &quot;This Is England&quot; as one of the top 1001 rock singles of all time. The album peaked at number 16 in the UK Albums Chart and at number 88 in the US. Strummer largely disowned the album but later said: &quot;I really like &#x27;This Is England&#x27; and [album track] &#x27;North and South&#x27; is a vibe&quot;.

In January 1986, it was announced that the Clash had disbanded. Strummer later said: &quot;When the Clash collapsed, we were tired. There had been a lot of intense activity in five years. Secondly, I felt we&#x27;d run out of idea gasoline. And thirdly, I wanted to shut up and let someone else have a go at it.&quot;

===Collaborations, reunions and Strummer&#x27;s death: 1986–present===
After his dismissal, Jones formed Big Audio Dynamite (B.A.D.), who released their debut album &quot;This Is Big Audio Dynamite&quot; late in 1985. Jones and Strummer worked together on their respective 1986 projects; Jones helped with the two songs Strummer wrote and performed for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; (1986), and Strummer co-wrote a number of the tracks for the second B.A.D. album &quot;No. 10, Upping St.&quot;, which he also co-produced. With Jones committed to B.A.D., Strummer moved on to solo projects and screen acting. Simonon formed a band called Havana 3am. Headon recorded a solo album &quot;Waking Up&quot; but was imprisoned in 1987 for drug-related offences.

In 1988, the compilation album &quot;The Story of the Clash, Volume 1&quot; was released and the single &quot;I Fought The Law&quot; was reissued and reached number 29 in the UK Singles Chart. On 2 March 1991, a reissue of &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot; gave the Clash their first and only number-one UK single. The same year, &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; featured on a broadcast of Armed Forces Radio during the Gulf War.

In 1999, Strummer, Jones and Simonon cooperated in compiling the live album &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; and the video documentary &quot;Westway to the World&quot;. On 7 November 2002, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced the Clash would be inducted the following March. On 15 November, Jones and Strummer shared the stage, performing three Clash songs during a London benefit show by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros. Strummer, Jones and Headon wanted to play a reunion show to coincide with their induction into the Hall of Fame; Simonon did not want to participate because he believed playing at the high-priced event would not have been in the spirit of the Clash. On 22 December 2002, Strummer died from a congenital heart defect, ending any possibility of a full reunion. In March 2003, Strummer, Jones, Simonon, Chimes and Headon were inducted into the Hall of Fame.

In early 2008, Carbon/Silicon, a new band founded by Mick Jones and his former London SS bandmate Tony James, entered into a six-week residency at London&#x27;s Inn on the Green. On opening night, 11 January, Headon joined the band for the Clash&#x27;s song &quot;Train in Vain&quot;. An encore followed with Headon playing drums on &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot;. This was the first time since 1982 that Headon and Jones had performed together on stage.

In September 2009, Jones and Headon reunited to re-record the 1970s Clash B-side &quot;Jail Guitar Doors&quot; with Billy Bragg, who founded an eponymous charity that gives musical instruments and lessons to prison inmates. Simonon and Jones are featured on the title track of the Gorillaz album &quot;Plastic Beach&quot; (2010), marking the first time they had worked together in over twenty years. They later joined Gorillaz on their Escape to Plastic Beach Tour for the remainder of 2010.

In July 2012, Strummer&#x27;s daughters Jazz and Lola gave a rare interview to discuss the tenth anniversary of Strummer&#x27;s death, his legacy and the possibility of a Clash reunion had their father lived. Jazz said: There was talk about the Clash reforming before he died. But there had been talk for years and years about them reforming. They had been offered stupid amounts of money to do it, but they were very good at keeping the moral high ground and saying no. But I think if Dad hadn&#x27;t died, it would have happened. It felt like it was in the air.

In the UK on 9 September 2013, and a day later in the US, the Clash released a 12-disc box set called &quot;Sound System&quot;, which includes their re-mastered studio albums on eight discs and three discs featuring demos, non-album singles, rarities and B-sides; a DVD with previously unseen footage by Don Letts and Julien Temple and other film footage; and merchandising ephemera, including an exclusive the Clash poster. Mick Jones and Paul Simonon oversaw the project, including the re-masters. The box set was accompanied by &quot;5 Album Studio Set&quot;, which contains the first five studio albums (excluding &quot;Cut the Crap&quot;), and &quot;The Clash Hits Back&quot;, a 33-track, two-CD best-of collection.

In a 3 September 2013 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Mick Jones discussed the band reuniting, saying it likely would not have occurred. Jones said: There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn&#x27;t. And neither, probably, was Topper, who didn&#x27;t wind up even coming in the end. It didn&#x27;t look like a performance was going to happen anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn&#x27;t. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way for the rest of the time. That was more important to us than the band.
Jones also stated the &quot;Sound System&quot; box set was the last time he would be involved in the band&#x27;s releases: &quot;I&#x27;m not even thinking about any more Clash releases. This is it for me, and I say that with an exclamation mark&quot;.

On 6 September 2013, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon and Topper Headon reunited for an exclusive BBC Radio 6 Music show to promote their legacy and the release of &quot;Sound System&quot;.

In an October 2013 interview with BBC 6 Music, Jones said Strummer did have intentions of a Clash reunion and that new music was being written for a possible album. In the months before Strummer&#x27;s death, Jones and Strummer began working on new music for what he thought would be the next Mescaleros album. Jones said: We wrote a batch – we didn&#x27;t used to write one, we used to write a batch at a time – like gumbo. The idea was he was going to go into the studio with the Mescaleros during the day and then send them all home. I&#x27;d come in all night and we&#x27;d all work all night.

According to Jones, months after their work together, he ran into Strummer at an event; Strummer informed him the songs were going to be used for the next Clash album. On 6 April 2022, the Clash announced the re-release of &quot;Combat Rock&quot;, including demos with Ranking Roger&#x27;s vocals, titled &#x27;Combat Rock / The People&#x27;s Hall&#x27;. &quot;Rock the Casbah (Ranking Roger)&quot; and &quot;Red Angel Dragnet (Ranking Roger)&quot; were released as supporting singles. The re-release occurred on 20 May 2022 to mixed reviews.

On 11 November 2022, a month before the 20th anniversary of Strummer&#x27;s death, founding member Keith Levene died in Norfolk, England.

==Politics==
The Clash&#x27;s music often expresses left-wing ideological sentiments. Strummer was a committed socialist. The Clash are credited with pioneering the advocacy of radical politics in punk rock; &quot;NME&quot; dubbed them &quot;Thinking Man&#x27;s Yobs&quot;. Like many early punk bands, the Clash protested against monarchy and aristocracy but unlike many of their peers, they rejected nihilism. Instead, they found solidarity with a number of liberation movements and were involved with groups such as the Anti-Nazi League. At their performance on 30 April 1978 at the Rock Against Racism concert in London&#x27;s Victoria Park for a crowd of between 50,000 and 100,000 people, Strummer wore a T-shirt identifying two far-left armed militant groups: Italy&#x27;s Red Brigades (&quot;Brigate Rosse&quot;, misspelt as &quot;Brigade Rosse&quot; on the T-shirt) and West Germany&#x27;s Red Army Faction.

According to rock historian Mikal Gilmore:
The moment that best exemplifies the Clash ... took place in August 1977, at a music festival in Liege, Belgium. The band was playing before 20,000 people and had been under fire from a crowd that was throwing bottles at the stage. But that wasn&#x27;t what bothered lead singer Joe Strummer. What enraged him was a 10-foot-high barbed-wire fence strung between concrete posts and forming a barrier between the group and the audience ... [He] jumped from the stage and attacked the fence, trying to pull it down ... The Clash were the only performers at the show who tried to do anything about the obstacle. They were more willing to run the risk of the crowd than to tolerate barbed wire that was meant to fend off that crowd. This is more or less what the Clash were about: fighting the good fight that few others would fight.

The band made their politics explicit in the lyrics of early recordings including &quot;White Riot&quot;, which encourages disaffected white youths to riot like their black counterparts; &quot;Career Opportunities&quot;, which addressed the alienation of low-paid, routine jobs and discontent over the lack of alternatives; and &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot; is about the bleakness and boredom of life in the inner city. Artist Caroline Coon, who was associated with the punk scene, said: &quot;[t]hose tough, militaristic songs were what we needed as we went into Thatcherism&quot;.

The title of &quot;Sandinista!&quot; refers to the Sandinista National Liberation Front, a group of left-wing rebels who had recently overthrown Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza Debayle; the album includes songs that were inspired by other political issues; &quot;Washington Bullets&quot; addresses covert military operations around the globe and &quot;The Call-Up&quot; is a meditation on US draft policies. scholars Simon Reynolds and Joy Press described &quot;Combat Rock&quot;″s track &quot;Straight to Hell&quot; as an &quot;around-the-world-at-war-in-five-verses guided tour of hell-zones where boy-soldiers had languished&quot;.

The band&#x27;s political sentiments are reflected in their resistance to the music industry&#x27;s profit motivations; even at their peak, tickets to shows and souvenirs were reasonably priced. The group insisted CBS sell their double and triple albums &quot;London Calling&quot; and &quot;Sandinista!&quot; for the price of a single album (then £5), succeeding with the former and compromising with the latter by agreeing to sell it for £5.99 and forfeit their performance royalties on the first 200,000 sales. These &quot;value for money&quot; (VFM) principles meant they were constantly in debt to CBS and only started to break even around 1982.

==Musical style and influences==
The Clash are mainly described as a punk rock band. According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, &quot;Sex Pistols may have been the first British punk rock band, but the Clash were the definitive British punk rockers&quot;. Later in their career, The Clash used elements of a variety of musical genres, including reggae, rockabilly, dub and R&amp;B. With their double album &quot;London Calling&quot;, the band expanded the breadth of their musical styles. Consequently, band&#x27;s music has also been described as experimental rock and new wave. Since their beginnings, the band has covered and composed songs in the reggae genre, and incorporated lovers&#x27; rock into &quot;London Calling&quot;.

==Legacy and influence==
In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the Clash number 28 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and in 2010, the band was ranked 22nd on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, the Clash&#x27;s debut, alongside &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;, is &quot;punk&#x27;s definitive statement&quot; and &quot;London Calling&quot; &quot;remains one of the most influential rock albums&quot;. &quot;London Calling&quot; was ranked eighth In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, which is the highest entry by a punk band; in the same list, &quot;The Clash&quot; was ranked 77th and &quot;Sandinista!&quot; was ranked 404th. In the magazine&#x27;s 2004 list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, &quot;London Calling&quot; was ranked number 15, again the highest entry for any song by a punk band. Four other Clash songs made the list: &quot;Should I Stay Or Should I Go&quot; (228), &quot;Train in Vain&quot; (292), &quot;Complete Control&quot; (361), and &quot;(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais&quot; (430). &quot;London Calling&quot; ranked number 48 in the magazine&#x27;s 2008 list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. In 2010, the cover art of &quot;London Calling&quot; was one of ten albums by British music acts whose albums were commemorated on a UK postage stamp issued by Royal Mail.

Jake Burns of Stiff Little Fingers, the first major punk band from Northern Ireland, said of their debut album&#x27;s impact:
[T]he big watershed was the Clash album—that was go out, cut your hair, stop mucking about time, y&#x27;know. Up to that point we&#x27;d still been singing about bowling down California highways. I mean, it meant nothing to me. Although the Damned and the Pistols were great, they were only exciting musically; lyrically, I couldn&#x27;t really make out a lot of it ... [T]o realise that [The Clash] were actually singing about their own lives in West London was like a bolt out of the blue.
The Clash inspired many musicians who were only loosely associated, if at all, with punk. The band&#x27;s embrace of ska and reggae, and England&#x27;s Jamaican subculture helped provide impetus for the 2 Tone movement that emerged after the punk explosion. Other musicians who began performing while the Clash were active and acknowledged their debt to the band include Billy Bragg and Aztec Camera. U2&#x27;s The Edge has compared the Clash&#x27;s inspirational effect to that of Ramones, both of which gave young rock musicians a &quot;sense that the door of possibility had swung open&quot;. He wrote: &quot;The Clash, more than any other group, kick-started a thousand garage bands across Ireland and the UK ... [S]eeing them perform was a life-changing experience&quot;. Bono described the Clash as &quot;the greatest rock band. They wrote the rule book for U2.&quot;

While Sex Pistols&#x27; debut gig at Manchester&#x27;s Lesser Free Trade Hall has been acknowledged as the starting point of that city&#x27;s punk scene, the Clash&#x27;s first performance at Eric&#x27;s, where they were supported by The Specials, had a similar effect in Liverpool. The gig was witnessed by Jayne Casey, Julian Cope, Pete Wylie, Pete Burns, Bill Drummond, Holly Johnson, Will Sergeant, Budgie and Ian McCulloch. Jon Langford of The Mekons said:
You can&#x27;t overestimate how important The Clash were back in 1977. We loved the Pistols&#x27; self-aware nihilism, but we didn&#x27;t want to be the Pistols, and if The Clash were cartoon-heroic and occasionally a bit silly we still loved them and recognised the risks they were taking.

The Clash&#x27;s influence can be heard in the works of American political punk bands such as The Offspring, Rancid, Anti-Flag, Bad Religion, NOFX, Green Day, and Rise Against, and in the political hard rock of early Manic Street Preachers. California band Rancid are known as &quot;incurable Clash zealots&quot;. The title track of Rancid&#x27;s album &quot;Indestructible&quot; says: &quot;I&#x27;ll keep listening to that great Joe Strummer!&quot; Outside rock music, Chuck D has credited The Clash as an inspiration for Public Enemy, in particular for their use of socially and politically conscious lyrics, which gained them attention from the music press: &quot;They talked about important subjects, so therefore journalists printed what they said, which was very pointed ... We took that from the Clash, because we were very similar in that regard. Public Enemy just did it 10 years later&quot;. In 2019, Chuck D narrated &quot;Stay Free: The Story of The Clash&quot;, an eight-part podcast series produced by Spotify and BBC Studios.

According to biographer Antonio Ambrosio, the Clash&#x27;s involvement with Jamaican musical and production styles inspired similar cross-cultural efforts by bands such as Bad Brains, Massive Attack, 311, Sublime and No Doubt. Jakob Dylan of The Wallflowers lists &quot;London Calling&quot; as the record that &quot;changed his life&quot;. Bands identified with the garage rock revival of the late 1990s and 2000s such as Sweden&#x27;s The Hives, Australia&#x27;s The Vines, Britain&#x27;s The Libertines, and America&#x27;s The White Stripes and the Strokes, show the Clash&#x27;s influence. Among the many late-20th-century British acts identified as having been inspired by the Clash are Babyshambles, The Futureheads, The Charlatans and Arctic Monkeys.

===Use in film and television===
The band&#x27;s 1982 hit &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot; appears in multiple episodes of the 2016 Netflix science-fiction drama series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, which is set in 1983. &quot;London Town&quot;, a film that tells the story of a Clash-obsessed teenager who in 1979 meets Joe Strummer by chance and finds his life changing as a result, was released in 2016.

===Notable covers of The Clash songs===
Before M.I.A. had an international hit in 2008 with &quot;Paper Planes&quot;, which is built around a sample from &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;, she referenced &quot;London Calling&quot; on 2003&#x27;s &quot;Galang&quot;. A cover of &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot; by German punk band Die Toten Hosen was released as a single in 2006. A version by reggae singer Jimmy Cliff with Tim Armstrong from Rancid was scheduled for release in November 2011. American-Irish punk band Dropkick Murphys released a cover of &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot; on &quot;Anti Heroes vs Dropkick Murphys&quot; (1997).

In June 2009, Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band opened their concert in Hyde Park, London, with &quot;London Calling&quot;. The concert was later released on DVD as &quot;London Calling: Live in Hyde Park&quot;. Bruce Springsteen, Little Steven, Dave Grohl and Elvis Costello performed the same song at the 2003 Grammys as a tribute to Joe Strummer, who died the year before. In 2009, Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band covered Strummer&#x27;s song &quot;Coma Girl&quot; and in 2014, along with Tom Morello, they opened some of their shows on the High Hopes Tour with &quot;Clampdown&quot;.

The band has also had a notable impact on music in the Spanish-speaking world. In 1997, a Clash tribute album featuring performances by Buenos Aires punk bands was released. Many &quot;rock en español&quot; bands such as Todos Tus Muertos, Café Tacuba, Maldita Vecindad, Los Prisioneros, Tijuana No, and Attaque 77, are indebted to the Clash. Argentina&#x27;s Los Fabulosos Cadillacs covered &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot;, &quot;London Calling&quot;″s &quot;Revolution Rock&quot; and &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot;, and invited Mick Jones to sing on their song &quot;Mal Bicho&quot;. The Clash&#x27;s influence is similarly reflected in Paris-founded band Mano Negra&#x27;s politicised lyrics and fusion of musical styles.

In March 2022, following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, surviving members of the Clash gave permission to Ukrainian punk band Beton to rewrite the lyrics of &quot;London Calling&quot;. The song was mixed in Los Angeles by music producer Danny Saber and proceeds from its sales were designated to help fund war efforts.

<doc id="30426" wikidata="Q234943" url="?curid=30426" title="Total internal reflection">
<text>In physics, total internal reflection (TIR) is the phenomenon in which waves arriving at the interface (boundary) from one medium to another (e.g., from water to air) are not refracted into the second (&quot;external&quot;) medium, but completely reflected back into the first (&quot;internal&quot;) medium. It occurs when the second medium has a higher wave speed (i.e., lower refractive index) than the first, and the waves are incident at a sufficiently oblique angle on the interface. For example, the water-to-air surface in a typical fish tank, when viewed obliquely from below, reflects the underwater scene like a mirror with no loss of brightness (Fig.1).

TIR occurs not only with electromagnetic waves such as light and microwaves, but also with other types of waves, including sound and water waves. If the waves are capable of forming a narrow beam (Fig.2), the reflection tends to be described in terms of &quot;rays&quot; rather than waves; in a medium whose properties are independent of direction, such as air, water or glass, the &quot;rays&quot; are perpendicular to associated wavefronts. The total internal reflection occurs when critical angle is exceeded.

Refraction is generally accompanied by &quot;partial&quot; reflection. When waves are refracted from a medium of lower propagation speed (higher refractive index) to a medium of higher propagation speed (lower refractive index)—e.g., from water to air—the &quot;angle of refraction&quot; (between the outgoing ray and the surface normal) is greater than the &quot;angle of incidence&quot; (between the incoming ray and the normal). As the angle of incidence approaches a certain threshold, called the &quot;critical angle&quot;, the angle of refraction approaches 90°, at which the refracted ray becomes parallel to the boundary surface. As the angle of incidence increases beyond the critical angle, the conditions of refraction can no longer be satisfied, so there is no refracted ray, and the partial reflection becomes total. For visible light, the critical angle is about 49° for incidence from water to air, and about 42° for incidence from common glass to air.

Details of the mechanism of TIR give rise to more subtle phenomena. While total reflection, by definition, involves no continuing flow of power &quot;across&quot; the interface between the two media, the external medium carries a so-called &quot;evanescent wave&quot;, which travels &quot;along&quot; the interface with an amplitude that falls off exponentially with distance from the interface. The &quot;total&quot; reflection is indeed total if the external medium is lossless (perfectly transparent), continuous, and of infinite extent, but can be conspicuously &quot;less&quot; than total if the evanescent wave is absorbed by a lossy external medium (&quot;attenuated total reflectance&quot;), or diverted by the outer boundary of the external medium or by objects embedded in that medium (&quot;frustrated&quot; TIR). Unlike &quot;partial&quot; reflection between transparent media, total internal reflection is accompanied by a non-trivial phase shift (not just zero or 180°) for each component of polarization (perpendicular or parallel to the plane of incidence), and the shifts vary with the angle of incidence. The explanation of this effect by Augustin-Jean Fresnel, in 1823, added to the evidence in favor of the wave theory of light.

The phase shifts are used by Fresnel&#x27;s invention, the Fresnel rhomb, to modify polarization. The efficiency of the total internal reflection is exploited by optical fibers (used in telecommunications cables and in image-forming fiberscopes), and by reflective prisms, such as image-erecting Porro/roof prisms for monoculars and binoculars.

== Optical description ==

Although total internal reflection can occur with any kind of wave that can be said to have oblique incidence, including (e.g.) microwaves and sound waves, it is most familiar in the case of light waves.

Total internal reflection of light can be demonstrated using a semicircular-cylindrical block of common glass or acrylic glass. In Fig.3, a &quot;ray box&quot; projects a narrow beam of light (a &quot;ray&quot;) radially inward. The semicircular cross-section of the glass allows the incoming ray to remain perpendicular to the curved portion of the air/glass surface, and then hence to continue in a straight line towards the flat part of the surface, although its angle with the flat part varies.

Where the ray meets the flat glass-to-air interface, the angle between the ray and the normal (perpendicular) to the interface is called the &quot;angle of incidence&quot;. If this angle is sufficiently small, the ray is &quot;partly&quot; reflected but mostly transmitted, and the transmitted portion is refracted away from the normal, so that the &quot;angle of refraction&quot; (between the refracted ray and the normal to the interface) is greater than the angle of incidence. For the moment, let us call the angle of incidence &quot;θ&quot; and the angle of refraction &quot;θ&quot;t (where &quot;t&quot; is for &quot;transmitted&quot;, reserving &quot;r&quot; for &quot;reflected&quot;). As &quot;θ&quot; increases and approaches a certain &quot;critical angle&quot;, denoted by &quot;θ&quot;c (or sometimes &quot;θ&quot;cr), the angle of refraction approaches 90° (that is, the refracted ray approaches a tangent to the interface), and the refracted ray becomes fainter while the reflected ray becomes brighter. As &quot;θ&quot; increases beyond &quot;θ&quot;c, the refracted ray disappears and only the reflected ray remains, so that all of the energy of the incident ray is reflected; this is total internal reflection (TIR). In brief:
* If &quot;θ&quot; &lt; &quot;θ&quot;c, the incident ray is split, being &quot;partly&quot; reflected and partly refracted;
* If &quot;θ&quot; &gt; &quot;θ&quot;c, the incident ray suffers total internal reflection (TIR); none of it is transmitted.

== Critical angle ==

The critical angle is the smallest angle of incidence that yields total reflection, or equivalently the largest angle for which a refracted ray exists. For light waves incident from an &quot;internal&quot; medium with a single refractive index , to an &quot;external&quot; medium with a single refractive index , the critical angle is given by formula_1 and is defined if . For some other types of waves, it is more convenient to think in terms of propagation velocities rather than refractive indices. The explanation of the critical angle in terms of velocities is more general and will therefore be discussed first.

When a wavefront is refracted from one medium to another, the incident (incoming) and refracted (outgoing) portions of the wavefront meet at a common line on the refracting surface (interface). Let this line, denoted by &quot;L&quot;, move at velocity across the surface, where is measured normal to &quot;L&quot; (Fig.4). Let the incident and refracted wavefronts propagate with normal velocities formula_2 and formula_3 respectively, and let them make the dihedral angles &quot;θ&quot;1 and &quot;θ&quot;2 respectively with the interface. From the geometry, formula_2 is the component of in the direction normal to the incident wave, so that formula_5 Similarly, formula_6 Solving each equation for and equating the results, we obtain the general law of refraction for waves:

But the dihedral angle between two planes is also the angle between their normals. So &quot;θ&quot;1 is the angle between the normal to the incident wavefront and the normal to the interface, while &quot;θ&quot;2 is the angle between the normal to the refracted wavefront and the normal to the interface; and Eq.() tells us that the sines of these angles are in the same ratio as the respective velocities.

This result has the form of &quot;Snell&#x27;s law&quot;, except that we have not yet said that the ratio of velocities is constant, nor identified &quot;θ&quot;1 and &quot;θ&quot;2 with the angles of incidence and refraction (called &quot;θ&quot;i and &quot;θ&quot;t above). However, if we now suppose that the properties of the media are &quot;isotropic&quot; (independent of direction), two further conclusions follow: first, the two velocities, and hence their ratio, are independent of their directions; and second, the wave-normal directions coincide with the &quot;ray&quot; directions, so that &quot;θ&quot;1 and &quot;θ&quot;2 coincide with the angles of incidence and refraction as defined above.

Obviously the angle of refraction cannot exceed 90°. In the limiting case, we put and in Eq.(), and solve for the critical angle:

In deriving this result, we retain the assumption of isotropic media in order to identify &quot;θ&quot;1 and &quot;θ&quot;2 with the angles of incidence and refraction.

For electromagnetic waves, and especially for light, it is customary to express the above results in terms of &quot;refractive indices&quot;. The refractive index of a medium with normal velocity formula_2 is defined as formula_8 where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum. Hence formula_9 Similarly, formula_10 Making these substitutions in Eqs.() and (), we obtain

and

Eq.() is the law of refraction for general media, in terms of refractive indices, provided that &quot;θ&quot;1 and &quot;θ&quot;2 are taken as the dihedral angles; but if the media are &quot;isotropic&quot;, then and become independent of direction, while &quot;θ&quot;1 and &quot;θ&quot;2 may be taken as the angles of incidence and refraction for the rays, and Eq.() follows. So, for isotropic media, Eqs.() and () together describe the behavior in Fig.5.

According to Eq.(), for incidence from water () to air (), we have , whereas for incidence from common or acrylic glass () to air (), we have .

The arcsin function yielding &quot;θ&quot;c is defined only if formula_11 Hence, for isotropic media, total internal reflection cannot occur if the second medium has a higher refractive index (lower normal velocity) than the first. For example, there cannot be TIR for incidence from air to water; rather, the critical angle for incidence from water to air is the angle of refraction at grazing incidence from air to water (Fig.6).

The medium with the higher refractive index is commonly described as optically &quot;denser&quot;, and the one with the lower refractive index as optically &quot;rarer&quot;. Hence it is said that total internal reflection is possible for &quot;dense-to-rare&quot; incidence, but not for &quot;rare-to-dense&quot; incidence.

== Everyday examples ==

When standing beside an aquarium with one&#x27;s eyes below the water level, one is likely to see fish or submerged objects reflected in the water-air surface (Fig.1). The brightness of the reflected image – just as bright as the &quot;direct&quot; view – can be startling.

A similar effect can be observed by opening one&#x27;s eyes while swimming just below the water&#x27;s surface. If the water is calm, the surface outside the critical angle (measured from the vertical) appears mirror-like, reflecting objects below. The region above the water cannot be seen except overhead, where the hemispherical field of view is compressed into a conical field known as &quot;Snell&#x27;s window&quot;, whose angular diameter is twice the critical angle (cf. Fig.6). The field of view above the water is theoretically 180° across, but seems less because as we look closer to the horizon, the vertical dimension is more strongly compressed by the refraction; e.g., by Eq.(), for air-to-water incident angles of 90°, 80°, and 70°, the corresponding angles of refraction are 48.6° (&quot;θcr&quot; in Fig.6), 47.6°, and 44.8°, indicating that the image of a point 20° above the horizon is 3.8° from the edge of Snell&#x27;s window while the image of a point 10° above the horizon is only 1° from the edge.

Fig.7, for example, is a photograph taken near the bottom of the shallow end of a swimming pool. What looks like a broad horizontal stripe on the right-hand wall consists of the lower edges of a row of orange tiles, and their reflections; this marks the water level, which can then be traced across the other wall. The swimmer has disturbed the surface above her, scrambling the lower half of her reflection, and distorting the reflection of the ladder (to the right). But most of the surface is still calm, giving a clear reflection of the tiled bottom of the pool. The space above the water is not visible except at the top of the frame, where the handles of the ladder are just discernible above the edge of Snell&#x27;s window – within which the reflection of the bottom of the pool is only partial, but still noticeable in the photograph. One can even discern the color-fringing of the edge of Snell&#x27;s window, due to variation of the refractive index, hence of the critical angle, with wavelength (see &quot;Dispersion&quot;).

The critical angle influences the angles at which gemstones are cut. The round &quot;brilliant&quot; cut, for example, is designed to refract light incident on the front facets, reflect it twice by TIR off the back facets, and transmit it out again through the front facets, so that the stone looks bright. Diamond (Fig.8) is especially suitable for this treatment, because its high refractive index (about 2.42) and consequently small critical angle (about 24.5°) yield the desired behavior over a wide range of viewing angles. Cheaper materials that are similarly amenable to this treatment include cubic zirconia (index≈2.15) and moissanite (non-isotropic, hence doubly refractive, with an index ranging from about 2.65 to 2.69, depending on direction and polarization); both of these are therefore popular as diamond simulants.

== Evanescent wave ==
Mathematically, waves are described in terms of time-varying fields, a &quot;field&quot; being a function of location in space. A propagating wave requires an &quot;effort&quot; field and a &quot;flow&quot; field, the latter being a vector (if we are working in two or three dimensions). The product of effort and flow is related to power (see &quot;System equivalence&quot;). For example, for sound waves in a non-viscous fluid, we might take the effort field as the pressure (a scalar), and the flow field as the fluid velocity (a vector). The product of these two is intensity (power per unit area). For electromagnetic waves, we shall take the effort field as the electric field and the flow field as the magnetizing field . Both of these are vectors, and their vector product is again the intensity (see &quot;Poynting vector&quot;).

When a wave in (say) medium 1 is reflected off the interface between medium 1 and medium 2, the flow field in medium 1 is the vector sum of the flow fields due to the incident and reflected waves. If the reflection is oblique, the incident and reflected fields are not in opposite directions and therefore cannot cancel out at the interface; even if the reflection is total, either the normal component or the tangential component of the combined field (as a function of location and time) must be non-zero adjacent to the interface. Furthermore, the physical laws governing the fields will generally imply that one of the two components is &quot;continuous&quot; across the interface (that is, it does not suddenly change as we cross the interface); for example, for electromagnetic waves, one of the interface conditions is that the tangential component of is continuous if there is no surface current. Hence, even if the reflection is total, there must be some penetration of the flow field into medium 2; and this, in combination with the laws relating the effort and flow fields, implies that there will also be some penetration of the effort field. The same continuity condition implies that the variation (&quot;waviness&quot;) of the field in medium 2 will be synchronized with that of the incident and reflected waves in medium 1.

But, if the reflection is total, the spatial penetration of the fields into medium 2 must be limited somehow, or else the total extent and hence the total energy of those fields would continue to increase, draining power from medium 1. Total reflection of a continuing wavetrain permits some energy to be stored in medium 2, but does not permit a &quot;continuing&quot; transfer of power from medium 1 to medium 2.

Thus, using mostly qualitative reasoning, we can conclude that total internal reflection must be accompanied by a wavelike field in the &quot;external&quot; medium, traveling along the interface in synchronism with the incident and reflected waves, but with some sort of limited spatial penetration into the &quot;external&quot; medium; such a field may be called an &quot;evanescent wave&quot;.

Fig.9 shows the basic idea. The incident wave is assumed to be plane and sinusoidal. The reflected wave, for simplicity, is not shown. The evanescent wave travels to the right in lock-step with the incident and reflected waves, but its amplitude falls off with increasing distance from the interface.

(Two features of the evanescent wave in Fig.9 are to be explained later: first, that the evanescent wave crests are perpendicular to the interface; and second, that the evanescent wave is slightly ahead of the incident wave.)

=== Frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) ===

If the internal reflection is to be total, there must be no diversion of the evanescent wave. Suppose, for example, that electromagnetic waves incident from glass (with a higher refractive index) to air (with a lower refractive index) at a certain angle of incidence are subject to TIR. And suppose that we have a third medium (often identical to the first) whose refractive index is sufficiently high that, if the third medium were to replace the second, we would get a standard transmitted wavetrain for the same angle of incidence. Then, if the third medium is brought within a distance of a few wavelengths from the surface of the first medium, where the evanescent wave has significant amplitude in the second medium, then the evanescent wave is effectively refracted into the third medium, giving non-zero transmission into the third medium, and therefore less than total reflection back into the first medium. As the amplitude of the evanescent wave decays across the air gap, the transmitted waves are attenuated, so that there is less transmission, and therefore more reflection, than there would be with no gap; but as long as there is &quot;some&quot; transmission, the reflection is less than total. This phenomenon is called &quot;frustrated total internal reflection&quot; (where &quot;frustrated&quot; negates &quot;total&quot;), abbreviated &quot;frustrated TIR&quot; or &quot;FTIR&quot;.

Frustrated TIR can be observed by looking into the top of a glass of water held in one&#x27;s hand (Fig.10). If the glass is held loosely, contact may not be sufficiently close and widespread to produce a noticeable effect. But if it is held more tightly, the ridges of one&#x27;s fingerprints interact strongly with the evanescent waves, allowing the ridges to be seen through the otherwise totally reflecting glass-air surface.

The same effect can be demonstrated with microwaves, using paraffin wax as the &quot;internal&quot; medium (where the incident and reflected waves exist). In this case the permitted gap width might be (e.g.) 1cm or several cm, which is easily observable and adjustable.

The term &quot;frustrated TIR&quot; also applies to the case in which the evanescent wave is scattered by an object sufficiently close to the reflecting interface. This effect, together with the strong dependence of the amount of scattered light on the distance from the interface, is exploited in &quot;total internal reflection microscopy&quot;.

The mechanism of FTIR is called &quot;evanescent-wave coupling&quot;, and is a good analog to visualize quantum tunneling. Due to the wave nature of matter, an electron has a non-zero probability of &quot;tunneling&quot; through a barrier, even if classical mechanics would say that its energy is insufficient. Similarly, due to the wave nature of light, a photon has a non-zero probability of crossing a gap, even if ray optics would say that its approach is too oblique.

Another reason why internal reflection may be less than total, even beyond the critical angle, is that the external medium may be &quot;lossy&quot; (less than perfectly transparent), in which case the external medium will absorb energy from the evanescent wave, so that the maintenance of the evanescent wave will draw power from the incident wave. The consequent less-than-total reflection is called &quot;attenuated total reflectance&quot; (ATR). This effect, and especially the frequency-dependence of the absorption, can be used to study the composition of an unknown external medium.

=== Derivation of evanescent wave ===

In a uniform plane sinusoidal electromagnetic wave, the electric field has the form

where is the (constant) complex amplitude vector, is the imaginary unit, is the wave vector (whose magnitude is the angular wavenumber), is the position vector, &quot;ω&quot; is the angular frequency, is time, and it is understood that the &quot;real part&quot; of the expression is the physical field. The magnetizing field has the same form with the same and &quot;ω&quot;. The value of the expression is unchanged if the position varies in a direction normal to ; hence &quot;is normal to the wavefronts&quot;.

If &quot;ℓ&quot; is the component of in the direction of the field () can be written formula_12 If the argument of formula_13 is to be constant, &quot;ℓ&quot; must increase at the velocity formula_14 known as the &quot;phase velocity&quot;. This in turn is equal to formula_15 where is the phase velocity in the reference medium (taken as vacuum), and is the local refractive index w.r.t. the reference medium. Solving for gives formula_16 i.e.

where formula_17 is the wavenumber in vacuum.

From (), the electric field in the &quot;external&quot; medium has the form
 e^{i(\mathbf{k_\text{t} \cdot r} - \omega t)},&lt;/math&gt;|}}
where is the wave vector for the transmitted wave (we assume isotropic media, but the transmitted wave is not &quot;yet&quot; assumed to be evanescent).

In Cartesian coordinates , let the region have refractive index and let the region have refractive index . Then the plane is the interface, and the axis is normal to the interface (Fig.11). Let and be the unit vectors in the and directions respectively. Let the plane of incidence (containing the incident wave-normal and the normal to the interface) be the plane (the plane of the page), with the angle of incidence &quot;θ&quot;i measured from towards . Let the angle of refraction, measured in the same sense, be &quot;θ&quot;t (&quot;t&quot; for &quot;transmitted&quot;, reserving &quot;r&quot; for &quot;reflected&quot;).

From (), the transmitted wave vector has magnitude . Hence, from the geometry,
formula_18
where the last step uses Snell&#x27;s law. Taking the dot product with the position vector, we get
formula_19
so that Eq.() becomes
 \exp[i(n_1 k_0 x \sin\theta_\text{i} + n_2 k_0 y \cos\theta_\text{t} - \omega t)].&lt;/math&gt;|}}

In the case of TIR, the angle &quot;θ&quot;t does not exist in the usual sense. But we can still interpret () for the transmitted (evanescent) wave by allowing to be &quot;complex&quot;. This becomes necessary when we write in terms of and thence in terms of using Snell&#x27;s law:
formula_20
For &quot;θ&quot;i greater than the critical angle, the value under the square-root symbol is negative, so that

To determine which sign is applicable, we substitute () into (), obtaining
 e^{\mp\sqrt{n_1^2\sin^2\theta_\text{i} - n_2^2}\, k_0 y} e^{i[(n_1 k_0 \sin\theta_\text{i})x - \omega t]},&lt;/math&gt;|}}
where the undetermined sign is the opposite of that in (). For an &quot;evanescent&quot; transmitted wave that is, one whose amplitude decays as increases the undetermined sign in () must be &quot;minus&quot;, so the undetermined sign in () must be &quot;plus&quot;.

With the correct sign, the result () can be abbreviated

where

and is the wavenumber in vacuum, i.e. formula_21

So the evanescent wave is a plane sinewave traveling in the direction, with an amplitude that decays exponentially in the direction (Fig.9). It is evident that the energy stored in this wave likewise travels in the direction and does not cross the interface. Hence the Poynting vector generally has a component in the direction, but its component averages to zero (although its instantaneous component is not &quot;identically&quot; zero).

Eq.() indicates that the amplitude of the evanescent wave falls off by a factor as the coordinate (measured from the interface) increases by the distance formula_22 commonly called the &quot;penetration depth&quot; of the evanescent wave. Taking reciprocals of the first equation of (), we find that the penetration depth is
formula_23
where &quot;λ&quot;0 is the wavelength in vacuum, i.e. formula_24 Dividing the numerator and denominator by yields
formula_25
where formula_26 is the wavelength in the second (external) medium. Hence we can plot in units of &quot;λ&quot;2 as a function of the angle of incidence for various values of formula_27 (Fig.12). As &quot;θ&quot;i decreases towards the critical angle, the denominator approaches zero, so that increases without limit as is to be expected, because as soon as &quot;θ&quot;i is &quot;less&quot; than critical, uniform plane waves are permitted in the external medium. As &quot;θ&quot;i approaches 90° (grazing incidence), approaches a minimum
formula_28
For incidence from water to air, or common glass to air, is not much different from &quot;λ&quot;2/(2&quot;π&quot;). But is larger at smaller angles of incidence (Fig.12), and the amplitude may still be significant at distances of several times ; for example, because is just greater than 0.01, the evanescent wave amplitude within a distance of the interface is at least 1% of its value at the interface. Hence, speaking loosely, we tend to say that the evanescent wave amplitude is significant within &quot;a few wavelengths&quot; of the interface.

==Phase shifts ==

Between 1817 and 1823, Augustin-Jean Fresnel discovered that total internal reflection is accompanied by a non-trivial phase shift (that is, a phase shift that is not restricted to 0° or 180°), as the Fresnel reflection coefficient acquires a non-zero imaginary part. We shall now explain this effect for electromagnetic waves in the case of linear, homogeneous, isotropic, non-magnetic media. The phase shift turns out to be an &quot;advance&quot;, which grows as the incidence angle increases beyond the critical angle, but which depends on the polarization of the incident wave.

In equations (), (), (), (), and (), we advance the phase by the angle &quot;ϕ&quot; if we replace by (that is, if we replace by ), with the result that the (complex) field is multiplied by . So a phase &quot;advance&quot; is equivalent to multiplication by a complex constant with a &quot;negative&quot; argument. This becomes more obvious when (e.g.) the field () is factored as formula_29 where the last factor contains the time dependence.

To represent the polarization of the incident, reflected, or transmitted wave, the electric field adjacent to an interface can be resolved into two perpendicular components, known as the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; components, which are parallel to the &quot;surface&quot; and the &quot;plane&quot; of incidence respectively; in other words, the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; components are respectively &quot;square&quot; and &quot;parallel&quot; to the plane of incidence.

For each component of polarization, the incident, reflected, or transmitted electric field ( in Eq.()) has a certain direction and can be represented by its (complex) scalar component in that direction. The reflection or transmission coefficient can then be defined as a &quot;ratio&quot; of complex components at the same point, or at infinitesimally separated points on opposite sides of the interface. But, in order to fix the &quot;signs&quot; of the coefficients, we must choose positive senses for the &quot;directions&quot;. For the &quot;s&quot; components, the obvious choice is to say that the positive directions of the incident, reflected, and transmitted fields are all the same (e.g., the direction in Fig.11). For the &quot;p&quot; components, this article adopts the convention that the positive directions of the incident, reflected, and transmitted fields are inclined towards the same medium (that is, towards the same side of the interface, e.g. like the red arrows in Fig.11). But the reader should be warned that some books use a different convention for the &quot;p&quot; components, causing a different sign in the resulting formula for the reflection coefficient.

For the &quot;s&quot; polarization, let the reflection and transmission coefficients be and respectively. For the &quot;p&quot; polarization, let the corresponding coefficients be and . Then, for &quot;linear, homogeneous, isotropic, non-magnetic&quot; media, the coefficients are given by

{n_1\cos\theta_\text{i} + n_2\cos\theta_\text{t}},&lt;/math&gt;|}}
{n_1\cos\theta_\text{i} + n_2\cos\theta_\text{t}},&lt;/math&gt;|}}
{n_2\cos\theta_\text{i} + n_1\cos\theta_\text{t}},&lt;/math&gt;|}}
{n_2\cos\theta_\text{i} + n_1\cos\theta_\text{t}}.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

(For a derivation of the above, see .)

Now we suppose that the transmitted wave is evanescent. With the correct sign (+), substituting () into () gives
formula_30
where
formula_31
that is, is the index of the &quot;internal&quot; medium relative to the &quot;external&quot; one, or the index of the internal medium if the external one is vacuum. So the magnitude of is 1, and the &quot;argument&quot; of is
formula_32
which gives a phase &quot;advance&quot; of
{n\cos\theta_\text{i}}.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Making the same substitution in (), we find that has the same denominator as with a positive real numerator (instead of a complex conjugate numerator) and therefore has &quot;half&quot; the argument of , so that &quot;the phase advance of the evanescent wave is half that of the reflected wave&quot;.

With the same choice of sign, substituting () into () gives
formula_33
whose magnitude is 1, and whose argument is
formula_34
which gives a phase &quot;advance&quot; of
{\cos\theta_\text{i}}.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Making the same substitution in (), we again find that the phase advance of the evanescent wave is &quot;half&quot; that of the reflected wave.

Equations () and () apply when , where &quot;θ&quot;i is the angle of incidence, and &quot;θ&quot;c is the critical angle . These equations show that
* each phase advance is zero at the critical angle (for which the numerator is zero);
* each phase advance approaches 180° as ; and
* at intermediate values of &quot;θ&quot;i (because the factor is in the numerator of () and the denominator of ()).

For , the reflection coefficients are given by equations () and () and are &quot;real&quot;, so that the phase shift is either 0° (if the coefficient is positive) or 180° (if the coefficient is negative).

In (), if we put formula_35 (Snell&#x27;s law) and multiply the numerator and denominator by , we obtain

which is positive for all angles of incidence with a transmitted ray (since ), giving a phase shift of zero.

If we do likewise with (), the result is easily shown to be equivalent to

which is negative for small angles (that is, near normal incidence), but changes sign at &quot;Brewster&#x27;s angle&quot;, where &quot;θ&quot;i and &quot;θ&quot;t are complementary. Thus the phase shift is 180° for small &quot;θ&quot;i but switches to 0° at Brewster&#x27;s angle. Combining the complementarity with Snell&#x27;s law yields as Brewster&#x27;s angle for dense-to-rare incidence.

(Equations () and () are known as &quot;Fresnel&#x27;s sine law&quot; and &quot;Fresnel&#x27;s tangent law&quot;. Both reduce to 0/0 at normal incidence, but yield the correct results in the limit as . That they have opposite signs as we approach normal incidence is an obvious disadvantage of the sign convention used in this article; the corresponding advantage is that they have the same signs at grazing incidence.)

That completes the information needed to plot and for all angles of incidence. This is done in Fig.13, with in red and in blue, for three refractive indices. On the angle-of-incidence scale (horizontal axis), Brewster&#x27;s angle is where (red) falls from 180° to 0°, and the critical angle is where both and (red and blue) start to rise again. To the left of the critical angle is the region of &quot;partial&quot; reflection, where both reflection coefficients are real (phase 0° or 180°) with magnitudes less than 1. To the right of the critical angle is the region of &quot;total&quot; reflection, where both reflection coefficients are complex with magnitudes equal to 1. In that region, the black curves show the phase advance of the &quot;p&quot; component relative to the &quot;s&quot; component:
formula_36
It can be seen that a refractive index of 1.45 is not enough to give a 45° phase difference, whereas a refractive index of 1.5 is enough (by a slim margin) to give a 45° phase difference at two angles of incidence: about 50.2° and 53.3°.

This 45° relative shift is employed in Fresnel&#x27;s invention, now known as the Fresnel rhomb, in which the angles of incidence are chosen such that the two internal reflections cause a total relative phase shift of 90° between the two polarizations of an incident wave. This device performs the same function as a birefringent quarter-wave plate, but is more achromatic (that is, the phase shift of the rhomb is less sensitive to wavelength). Either device may be used, for instance, to transform linear polarization to circular polarization (which Fresnel also discovered) and conversely.

In Fig.13, is computed by a final subtraction; but there are other ways of expressing it. Fresnel himself, in 1823, gave a formula for . Born and Wolf (1970, p.50) derive an expression for and find its maximum analytically.

For TIR of a beam with finite width, the variation in the phase shift with the angle of incidence gives rise to the &quot;Goos–Hänchen effect&quot;, which is a lateral shift of the reflected beam within the plane of incidence. This effect applies to linear polarization in the &quot;s&quot; or &quot;p&quot; direction. The &quot;Imbert–Fedorov effect&quot; is an analogous effect for circular or elliptical polarization and produces a shift perpendicular to the plane of incidence.

== Applications ==
Optical fibers exploit total internal reflection to carry signals over long distances with little attenuation. They are used in telecommunication cables, and in image-forming fiberscopes such as colonoscopes.

In the catadioptric Fresnel lens, invented by Augustin-Jean Fresnel for use in lighthouses, the outer prisms use TIR to deflect light from the lamp through a greater angle than would be possible with purely refractive prisms, but with less absorption of light (and less risk of tarnishing) than with conventional mirrors.

Other reflecting prisms that use TIR include the following (with some overlap between the categories):
* Image-erecting prisms for binoculars and spotting scopes include paired 45°-90°-45° Porro prisms (Fig.14), the Porro–Abbe prism, the inline Koenig and Abbe–Koenig prisms, and the compact inline Schmidt–Pechan prism. (The last consists of two components, of which one is a kind of Bauernfeind prism, which requires a reflective coating on one of its two reflecting faces, due to a sub-critical angle of incidence.) These prisms have the additional function of folding the optical path from the objective lens to the prime focus, reducing the overall length for a given primary focal length.
* A prismatic star diagonal for an astronomical telescope may consist of a single Porro prism (configured for a single reflection, giving a mirror-reversed image) or an Amici roof prism (which gives a non-reversed image).
* Roof prisms use TIR at two faces meeting at a sharp 90° angle. This category includes the Koenig, Abbe–Koenig, Schmidt–Pechan, and Amici types (already mentioned), and the roof pentaprism used in SLR cameras; the last of these requires a reflective coating on one face.
* A prismatic corner reflector uses three total internal reflections to reverse the direction of incoming light.
* The Dove prism gives an inline view with mirror-reversal.

Polarizing prisms: Although the Fresnel rhomb, which converts between linear and elliptical polarization, is not birefringent (doubly refractive), there are other kinds of prisms that combine birefringence with TIR in such a way that light of a particular polarization is totally reflected while light of the orthogonal polarization is at least partly transmitted. Examples include the Nicol prism, Glan–Thompson prism, Glan–Foucault prism (or &quot;Foucault prism&quot;), and Glan–Taylor prism.

Refractometers, which measure refractive indices, often use the critical angle.

Rain sensors for automatic windscreen/windshield wipers have been implemented using the principle that total internal reflection will guide an infrared beam from a source to a detector if the outer surface of the windshield is dry, but any water drops on the surface will divert some of the light.

Edge-lit LED panels, used (e.g.) for backlighting of LCD computer monitors, exploit TIR to confine the LED light to the acrylic glass pane, except that some of the light is scattered by etchings on one side of the pane, giving an approximately uniform luminous emittance.

Total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM) uses the evanescent wave to illuminate small objects close to the reflecting interface. The consequent scattering of the evanescent wave (a form of frustrated TIR), makes the objects appear bright when viewed from the &quot;external&quot; side. In the &quot;total internal reflection fluorescence microscope&quot; (TIRFM), instead of relying on simple scattering, we choose an evanescent wavelength short enough to cause fluorescence (Fig.15). The high sensitivity of the illumination to the distance from the interface allows measurement of extremely small displacements and forces.

A beam-splitter cube uses frustrated TIR to divide the power of the incoming beam between the transmitted and reflected beams. The width of the air gap (or low-refractive-index gap) between the two prisms can be made adjustable, giving higher transmission and lower reflection for a narrower gap, or higher reflection and lower transmission for a wider gap.

Optical modulation can be accomplished by means of frustrated TIR with a rapidly variable gap. As the transmission coefficient is highly sensitive to the gap width (the function being approximately exponential until the gap is almost closed), this technique can achieve a large dynamic range.

Optical fingerprinting devices have used frustrated TIR to record images of persons&#x27; fingerprints without the use of ink (cf. Fig.11).

Gait analysis can be performed by using frustrated TIR with a high-speed camera, to capture and analyze footprints.

A gonioscope, used in optometry and ophthalmology for the diagnosis of glaucoma, &quot;suppresses&quot; TIR in order to look into the angle between the iris and the cornea. This view is usually blocked by TIR at the cornea-air interface. The gonioscope replaces the air with a higher-index medium, allowing transmission at oblique incidence, typically followed by reflection in a &quot;mirror&quot;, which itself may be implemented using TIR.

Some multi-touch interactive tables and whiteboards utilise FTIR to detect fingers touching the screen. An infrared camera is placed behind the screen surface, which is edge-lit by infrared LEDs; when touching the surface FTIR causes some of the infrared light to escape the screen plane, and the camera sees this as bright areas. Computer vision software is then used to translate this into a series of coordinates and gestures.

=== Discovery ===

The surprisingly comprehensive and largely correct explanations of the rainbow by Theodoric of Freiberg (written between 1304 and 1310) and Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī (completed by 1309), although sometimes mentioned in connection with total internal reflection (TIR), are of dubious relevance because the internal reflection of sunlight in a spherical raindrop is &quot;not&quot; total. But, according to Carl Benjamin Boyer, Theodoric&#x27;s treatise on the rainbow also classified optical phenomena under five causes, the last of which was &quot;a total reflection at the boundary of two transparent media&quot;. Theodoric&#x27;s work was forgotten until it was rediscovered by Giovanni Battista Venturi in 1814.

Theodoric having fallen into obscurity, the discovery of TIR was generally attributed to Johannes Kepler, who published his findings in his &quot;Dioptrice&quot; in 1611. Although Kepler failed to find the true law of refraction, he showed by experiment that for air-to-glass incidence, the incident and refracted rays rotated in the same sense about the point of incidence, and that as the angle of incidence varied through ±90°, the angle of refraction (as we now call it) varied through ±42°. He was also aware that the incident and refracted rays were interchangeable. But these observations did not cover the case of a ray incident from glass to air at an angle beyond 42°, and Kepler promptly concluded that such a ray could only be &quot;reflected&quot;.

René Descartes rediscovered the law of refraction and published it in his &quot;Dioptrique&quot; of 1637. In the same work he mentioned the senses of rotation of the incident and refracted rays and the condition of TIR. But he neglected to discuss the limiting case, and consequently failed to give an expression for the critical angle, although he could easily have done so.

=== Huygens and Newton: Rival explanations ===

Christiaan Huygens, in his &quot;Treatise on Light&quot; (1690), paid much attention to the threshold at which the incident ray is &quot;unable to penetrate into the other transparent substance&quot;. Although he gave neither a name nor an algebraic expression for the critical angle, he gave numerical examples for glass-to-air and water-to-air incidence, noted the large change in the angle of refraction for a small change in the angle of incidence near the critical angle, and cited this as the cause of the rapid increase in brightness of the reflected ray as the refracted ray approaches the tangent to the interface. Huygens&#x27; insight is confirmed by modern theory: in Eqs.() and () above, there is nothing to say that the reflection coefficients increase exceptionally steeply as &quot;θ&quot;t approaches 90°, except that, according to Snell&#x27;s law, &quot;θ&quot;t itself is an increasingly steep function of &quot;θ&quot;i.

Huygens offered an explanation of TIR within the same framework as his explanations of the laws of rectilinear propagation, reflection, ordinary refraction, and even the extraordinary refraction of &quot;Iceland crystal&quot; (calcite). That framework rested on two premises: first, every point crossed by a propagating wavefront becomes a source of secondary wavefronts (&quot;Huygens&#x27; principle&quot;); and second, given an initial wavefront, any subsequent position of the wavefront is the envelope (common tangent surface) of all the secondary wavefronts emitted from the initial position. All cases of reflection or refraction by a surface are then explained simply by considering the secondary waves emitted from that surface. In the case of refraction from a medium of slower propagation to a medium of faster propagation, there is a certain obliquity of incidence beyond which it is impossible for the secondary wavefronts to form a common tangent in the second medium; this is what we now call the critical angle. As the incident wavefront approaches this critical obliquity, the refracted wavefront becomes concentrated against the refracting surface, augmenting the secondary waves that produce the reflection back into the first medium.

Huygens&#x27; system even accommodated &quot;partial&quot; reflection at the interface between different media, albeit vaguely, by analogy with the laws of collisions between particles of different sizes. However, as long as the wave theory continued to assume longitudinal waves, it had no chance of accommodating polarization, hence no chance of explaining the polarization-dependence of extraordinary refraction, or of the partial reflection coefficient, or of the phase shift in TIR.

Isaac Newton rejected the wave explanation of rectilinear propagation, believing that if light consisted of waves, it would &quot;bend and spread every way&quot; into the shadows. His corpuscular theory of light explained rectilinear propagation more simply, and it accounted for the ordinary laws of refraction and reflection, including TIR, on the hypothesis that the corpuscles of light were subject to a force acting perpendicular to the interface. In this model, for dense-to-rare incidence, the force was an attraction back towards the denser medium, and the critical angle was the angle of incidence at which the normal velocity of the approaching corpuscle was just enough to reach the far side of the force field; at more oblique incidence, the corpuscle would be turned back. Newton gave what amounts to a formula for the critical angle, albeit in words: &quot;as the Sines are which measure the Refraction, so is the Sine of Incidence at which the total Reflexion begins, to the Radius of the Circle&quot;.

Newton went beyond Huygens in two ways. First, not surprisingly, Newton pointed out the relationship between TIR and &quot;dispersion&quot;: when a beam of white light approaches a glass-to-air interface at increasing obliquity, the most strongly-refracted rays (violet) are the first to be &quot;taken out&quot; by &quot;total Reflexion&quot;, followed by the less-refracted rays. Second, he observed that total reflection could be &quot;frustrated&quot; (as we now say) by laying together two prisms, one plane and the other slightly convex; and he explained this simply by noting that the corpuscles would be attracted not only to the first prism, but also to the second.

In two other ways, however, Newton&#x27;s system was less coherent. First, his explanation of &quot;partial&quot; reflection depended not only on the supposed forces of attraction between corpuscles and media, but also on the more nebulous hypothesis of &quot;Fits of easy Reflexion&quot; and &quot;Fits of easy Transmission&quot;. Second, although his corpuscles could conceivably have &quot;sides&quot; or &quot;poles&quot;, whose orientations could conceivably determine whether the corpuscles suffered ordinary or extraordinary refraction in &quot;Island-Crystal&quot;, his geometric description of the extraordinary refraction was theoretically unsupported and empirically inaccurate.

=== Laplace, Malus, and attenuated total reflectance (ATR) ===

William Hyde Wollaston, in the first of a pair of papers read to the Royal Society of London in 1802, reported his invention of a refractometer based on the critical angle of incidence from an internal medium of known &quot;refractive power&quot; (refractive index) to an external medium whose index was to be measured. With this device, Wollaston measured the &quot;refractive powers&quot; of numerous materials, some of which were too opaque to permit direct measurement of an angle of refraction. Translations of his papers were published in France in 1803, and apparently came to the attention of Pierre-Simon Laplace.

According to Laplace&#x27;s elaboration of Newton&#x27;s theory of refraction, a corpuscle incident on a plane interface between two homogeneous isotropic media was subject to a force field that was symmetrical about the interface. If both media were transparent, total reflection would occur if the corpuscle were turned back before it exited the field in the second medium. But if the second medium were opaque, reflection would not be total unless the corpuscle were turned back before it left the &quot;first&quot; medium; this required a larger critical angle than the one given by Snell&#x27;s law, and consequently impugned the validity of Wollaston&#x27;s method for opaque media. Laplace combined the two cases into a single formula for the relative refractive index in terms of the critical angle (minimum angle of incidence for TIR). The formula contained a parameter which took one value for a transparent external medium and another value for an opaque external medium. Laplace&#x27;s theory further predicted a relationship between refractive index and density for a given substance.

In 1807, Laplace&#x27;s theory was tested experimentally by his protégé, Étienne-Louis Malus. Taking Laplace&#x27;s formula for the refractive index as given, and using it to measure the refractive index of beeswax in the liquid (transparent) state and the solid (opaque) state at various temperatures (hence various densities), Malus verified Laplace&#x27;s relationship between refractive index and density.

But Laplace&#x27;s theory implied that if the angle of incidence exceeded his modified critical angle, the reflection would be total even if the external medium was absorbent. Clearly this was wrong: in Eqs.() above, there is no threshold value of the angle &quot;θ&quot;i beyond which &quot;κ&quot; becomes infinite; so the penetration depth of the evanescent wave (1/&quot;κ&quot;) is always non-zero, and the external medium, if it is at all lossy, will attenuate the reflection. As to why Malus apparently observed such an angle for opaque wax, we must infer that there was a certain angle beyond which the attenuation of the reflection was so small that ATR was visually indistinguishable from TIR.

=== Fresnel and the phase shift ===

Fresnel came to the study of total internal reflection through his research on polarization. In 1811, François Arago discovered that polarized light was apparently &quot;depolarized&quot; in an orientation-dependent and color-dependent manner when passed through a slice of doubly-refractive crystal: the emerging light showed colors when viewed through an analyzer (second polarizer). &quot;Chromatic polarization&quot;, as this phenomenon came to be called, was more thoroughly investigated in 1812 by Jean-Baptiste Biot. In 1813, Biot established that one case studied by Arago, namely quartz cut perpendicular to its optic axis, was actually a gradual rotation of the plane of polarization with distance.

In 1816, Fresnel offered his first attempt at a &quot;wave-based&quot; theory of chromatic polarization. Without (yet) explicitly invoking transverse waves, his theory treated the light as consisting of two perpendicularly polarized components. In 1817 he noticed that plane-polarized light seemed to be partly depolarized by total internal reflection, if initially polarized at an acute angle to the plane of incidence. By including total internal reflection in a chromatic-polarization experiment, he found that the apparently depolarized light was a mixture of components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, and that the total reflection introduced a phase difference between them. Choosing an appropriate angle of incidence (not yet exactly specified) gave a phase difference of 1/8 of a cycle. Two such reflections from the &quot;parallel faces&quot; of &quot;two coupled prisms&quot; gave a phase difference of 1/4 of a cycle. In that case, if the light was initially polarized at 45° to the plane of incidence and reflection, it appeared to be &quot;completely&quot; depolarized after the two reflections. These findings were reported in a memoir submitted and read to the French Academy of Sciences in November 1817.

In 1821, Fresnel derived formulae equivalent to his sine and tangent laws (Eqs.() and (), above) by modeling light waves as transverse elastic waves with vibrations perpendicular to what had previously been called the plane of polarization. Using old experimental data, he promptly confirmed that the equations correctly predicted the direction of polarization of the reflected beam when the incident beam was polarized at 45° to the plane of incidence, for light incident from air onto glass or water. The experimental confirmation was reported in a &quot;postscript&quot; to the work in which Fresnel expounded his mature theory of chromatic polarization, introducing transverse waves. Details of the derivation were given later, in a memoir read to the academy in January 1823. The derivation combined conservation of energy with continuity of the &quot;tangential&quot; vibration at the interface, but failed to allow for any condition on the &quot;normal&quot; component of vibration.

Meanwhile, in a memoir submitted in December 1822, Fresnel coined the terms &quot;linear polarization&quot;, &quot;circular polarization&quot;, and &quot;elliptical polarization&quot;. For &quot;circular&quot; polarization, the two perpendicular components were a quarter-cycle (±90°) out of phase.

The new terminology was useful in the memoir of January 1823, containing the detailed derivations of the sine and tangent laws: in that same memoir, Fresnel found that for angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, the resulting reflection coefficients were complex with unit magnitude. Noting that the magnitude represented the amplitude ratio as usual, he guessed that the argument represented the phase shift, and verified the hypothesis by experiment. The verification involved
* calculating the angle of incidence that would introduce a total phase difference of 90° between the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; components, for various numbers of total internal reflections at that angle (generally there were two solutions),
* subjecting light to that number of total internal reflections at that angle of incidence, with an initial linear polarization at 45° to the plane of incidence, and
* checking that the final polarization was circular.
This procedure was necessary because, with the technology of the time, one could not measure the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; phase-shifts directly, and one could not measure an arbitrary degree of ellipticality of polarization, such as might be caused by the difference between the phase shifts. But one could verify that the polarization was &quot;circular&quot;, because the brightness of the light was then insensitive to the orientation of the analyzer.

For glass with a refractive index of 1.51, Fresnel calculated that a 45° phase difference between the two reflection coefficients (hence a 90° difference after two reflections) required an angle of incidence of 48°37&#x27; or 54°37&#x27;. He cut a rhomb to the latter angle and found that it performed as expected. Thus the specification of the Fresnel rhomb was completed. Similarly, Fresnel calculated and verified the angle of incidence that would give a 90° phase difference after &quot;three&quot; reflections at the same angle, and &quot;four&quot; reflections at the same angle. In each case there were two solutions, and in each case he reported that the larger angle of incidence gave an accurate circular polarization (for an initial linear polarization at 45° to the plane of reflection). For the case of three reflections he also tested the smaller angle, but found that it gave some coloration due to the proximity of the critical angle and its slight dependence on wavelength. (Compare Fig.13 above, which shows that the phase difference is more sensitive to the refractive index for smaller angles of incidence.)

For added confidence, Fresnel predicted and verified that four total internal reflections at 68°27&#x27; would give an accurate circular polarization if two of the reflections had water as the external medium while the other two had air, but not if the reflecting surfaces were all wet or all dry.

Fresnel&#x27;s deduction of the phase shift in TIR is thought to have been the first occasion on which a physical meaning was attached to the argument of a complex number. Although this reasoning was applied without the benefit of knowing that light waves were electromagnetic, it passed the test of experiment, and survived remarkably intact after James Clerk Maxwell changed the presumed nature of the waves. Meanwhile, Fresnel&#x27;s success inspired James MacCullagh and Augustin-Louis Cauchy, beginning in 1836, to analyze reflection from metals by using the Fresnel equations with a complex refractive index. The imaginary part of the complex index represents absorption.

The term &quot;critical angle&quot;, used for convenience in the above narrative, is anachronistic: it apparently dates from 1873.

In the 20th century, quantum electrodynamics reinterpreted the amplitude of an electromagnetic wave in terms of the probability of finding a photon. In this framework, partial transmission and frustrated TIR concern the probability of a photon crossing a boundary, and attenuated total reflectance concerns the probability of a photon being absorbed on the other side.

Research into the more subtle aspects of the phase shift in TIR, including the Goos–Hänchen and Imbert–Fedorov effects and their quantum interpretations, has continued into the 21st century.

<text>The Inklings were an informal literary discussion group associated with J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis at the University of Oxford for nearly two decades between the early 1930s and late 1949. The Inklings were literary enthusiasts who praised the value of narrative in fiction and encouraged the writing of fantasy. The best-known, apart from Tolkien and Lewis, were Charles Williams, and (although a Londoner) Owen Barfield.

== Members ==

The more regular members of the Inklings, many of them academics at the University, included:
* Owen Barfield 
* Lord David Cecil 
* Hugo Dyson
* Adam Fox
* Robert Havard (Lewis&#x27;s and Tolkien&#x27;s doctor, dubbed &quot;Useless Quack&quot; by Warren Lewis)
* C. S. Lewis 
* Warren Lewis (C. S. Lewis&#x27;s elder brother) 
* J. R. R. Tolkien 
* Christopher Tolkien (J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s son) 
* Charles Williams 
Less frequent visitors included:

* Nevill Coghill
* James Dundas-Grant 
* Colin Hardie
* Gervase Mathew
* R. B. McCallum 
* Courtenay Edward Stevens
* Charles Leslie Wrenn 
* George Temple
Guests included: 
* Roy Campbell
* E. R. Eddison
==Meetings==

&quot;Properly speaking,&quot; wrote Warren Lewis, &quot;the Inklings was neither a club nor a literary society, though it partook of the nature of both. There were no rules, officers, agendas, or formal elections.&quot; As was typical for university groups in their time and place, the Inklings were all male. Readings and discussions of the members&#x27; unfinished works were the principal purposes of meetings. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, and Williams&#x27;s &quot;All Hallows&#x27; Eve&quot; were among the novels first read to the Inklings. Tolkien&#x27;s fictional Notion Club (see &quot;Sauron Defeated&quot;) was based on the Inklings. Meetings were not all serious; the Inklings amused themselves by having competitions to see who could read the notoriously bad prose of Amanda McKittrick Ros for the longest without laughing.

The name was associated originally with a society of Oxford University&#x27;s University College, initiated by the then undergraduate Edward Tangye Lean around 1931, for the purpose of reading aloud unfinished compositions. The society consisted of students and dons, among them Tolkien and Lewis. When Lean left Oxford in 1933, the society ended, and Tolkien and Lewis transferred its name to their group at Magdalen College. On the association between the two &#x27;Inklings&#x27; societies, Tolkien later said &quot;although our habit was to read aloud compositions of various kinds (and lengths!), this association and its habit would in fact have come into being at that time, whether the original short-lived club had ever existed or not.&quot;

Until late 1949, Inklings readings and discussions were usually held on Thursday evenings in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s rooms at Magdalen. The Inklings and friends also gathered informally on Tuesdays at midday at a local public house, The Eagle and Child, familiarly and alliteratively known in the Oxford community as The Bird and Baby, or simply The Bird. The publican, Charlie Blagrove, let Lewis and friends use his private parlour for privacy; the wall and door separating it from the public bar were removed in 1962. During the war years, beer shortages occasionally rendered the Eagle and Child unable to open and the group instead met at other pubs, including the White Horse and the Kings Arms. Later pub meetings were at The Lamb and Flag across the street, and in earlier years the Inklings also met irregularly in yet other pubs, but The Eagle and Child is the best known.

== Legacy ==

The Marion E. Wade Center, at Wheaton College, Illinois, has holdings on the Inklings Owen Barfield, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien and Charles Williams. These include letters, manuscripts, audio and video tapes, artwork, dissertations, periodicals, photographs, and related materials. Wheaton also has a creative writing critique group inspired by the Inklings called &quot;WhInklings&quot;.

The Mythopoeic Society, with its journal &quot;Mythlore&quot;, is a literary organization devoted to the study of mythopoeic literature, particularly the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, and Charles Williams, founded by Glen GoodKnight in 1967 and incorporated as a non-profit organization in 1971.

Another journal that focuses on &quot;The Inklings&quot; is &quot;Journal of Inklings Studies&quot; (founded in 2011).

== The Inklings in fiction ==

In &quot;Swan Song&quot; (1947) by Edmund Crispin a discussion takes place between Professor Gervase Fen and others in the front parlour of the Eagle and Child.

&quot;The Late Scholar&quot; (2013) by Jill Paton Walsh is a sequel, set in 1951, to the Lord Peter Wimsey novels of Dorothy L. Sayers. Wimsey, now 17th Duke of Denver, is investigating a mystery in the fictional St Severin&#x27;s College, Oxford with his friend Charles Parker, now an assistant chief constable.

Three of the best-known members of the Inklings – Tolkien, Lewis, and Williams – are the main characters of James A. Owen&#x27;s fantasy series, &quot;The Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica&quot;. (Warren Lewis and Hugo Dyson are recurring minor characters throughout the series.) The existence and founding of the organization are also alluded to in the third novel, &quot;The Indigo King&quot;. (The timeline of the books is different from the historical timeline at points, but these are dealt with part way through the series by the explanation that the books take place in a history alternative to our own.)

<doc id="30432" wikidata="Q131569" url="?curid=30432" title="Treaty">
<text>A treaty is a formal, legally binding written agreement concluded by sovereign states in international law. International organizations can also be party to an international treaty. A treaty is binding under international law.

A treaty may also be known as an international agreement, protocol, covenant, convention, pact, or exchange of letters, among other terms. However, only documents that are legally binding on the parties are considered treaties under international law. Treaties vary in their obligations (the extent to which states are bound to the rules), precision (the extent to which the rules are unambiguous), and delegation (the extent to which third parties have authority to interpret, apply and make rules).

Treaties are among the earliest manifestations of international relations; the first known example is a border agreement between the Sumerian city-states of Lagash and Umma around 3100 BC. International agreements were used in some form by most major civilizations, and became increasingly common and more sophisticated during the early modern era. The early 19th century saw developments in diplomacy, foreign policy, and international law reflected by the widespread use of treaties. The 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties codified these practices and established rules and guidelines for creating, amending, interpreting, and terminating treaties, and for resolving disputes and alleged breaches.

Treaties are roughly analogous to contracts in that they establish the rights and binding obligations of the parties. They vary significantly in form, substance, and complexity and govern a wide variety of matters, such as security, trade, environment, and human rights. Treaties may be bilateral (between two countries) or multilateral (involving more than two countries). They may also be used to establish international institutions, such as the International Criminal Court and the United Nations, for which they often provide a governing framework. Treaties serve as primary sources of international law and have codified or established most international legal principles since the early 20th century. In contrast with other sources of international law, such as customary international law, treaties are only binding on the parties that have signed and ratified them.

Notwithstanding the Law of Treaties and customary international law, treaties are not required to follow any standard form. Nevertheless, all valid treaties must comply with the legal principle of &quot;pacta sunt servanda&quot; (Latin: &quot;agreements must be kept&quot;), under which parties are committed to perform their duties and honor their agreements in good faith. A treaty may also be invalidated, and thus rendered unenforceable, if it violates a preemptory norm (&quot;jus cogens&quot;), such as permitting a war of aggression or crimes against humanity.

==Modern usage and form==

A treaty is an official, express written agreement that states use to legally bind themselves. It is also the objective outcome of a ceremonial occasion that acknowledges the parties and their defined relationships. There is no prerequisite of academic accreditation or cross-professional contextual knowledge required to publish a treaty.

However, since the late 19th century, most treaties have followed a fairly consistent format. A treaty typically begins with a preamble describing the &quot;High Contracting Parties&quot; and their shared objectives in executing the treaty, as well as summarizing any underlying events (such as the aftermath of a war in the case of a peace treaty). Modern preambles are sometimes structured as a single very long sentence formatted into multiple paragraphs for readability, in which each of the paragraphs begins with a gerund (desiring, recognizing, having, etc.).

The High Contracting Parties—referred to as either the official title of the head of state (but not including the personal name), e.g. &quot;His Majesty The King of X&quot; or &quot;His Excellency The President of Y&quot;, or alternatively in the form of &quot; Government of Z&quot;—are enumerated, along with the full names and titles of their plenipotentiary representatives; a boilerplate clause describes how each party&#x27;s representatives have communicated (or exchanged) their &quot;full powers&quot; (i.e., the official documents appointing them to act on behalf of their respective high contracting party) and found them in good or proper form. However, under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties if the representative is the head of state, head of government or minister of foreign affairs, no special document is needed, as holding such high office is sufficient.

The end of the preamble and the start of the actual agreement is often signaled by the words &quot;have agreed as follows&quot;.

After the preamble comes numbered articles, which contain the substance of the parties&#x27; actual agreement. Each article heading usually encompasses a paragraph. A long treaty may further group articles under chapter headings.

Modern treaties, regardless of subject matter, usually contain articles governing where the final authentic copies of the treaty will be deposited and how any subsequent disputes as to their interpretation will be peacefully resolved.

The end of a treaty, the eschatocol (or closing protocol), is often signaled by language such as &quot;in witness whereof&quot; or &quot;in faith whereof&quot;, followed by the words &quot;DONE at&quot;, then the site(s) of the treaty&#x27;s execution and the date(s) of its execution. The date is typically written in its most formal, non-numerical form; for example, the Charter of the United Nations reads &quot;DONE at the city of San Francisco the twenty-sixth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and forty-five&quot;. If applicable, a treaty will note that it is executed in multiple copies in different languages, with a stipulation that the versions in different languages are equally authentic.

The signatures of the parties&#x27; representatives follow at the very end. When the text of a treaty is later reprinted, such as in a collection of treaties currently in effect, an editor will often append the dates on which the respective parties ratified the treaty and on which it came into effect for each party.

===Bilateral and multilateral treaties===
Bilateral treaties are concluded between two states or entities. It is possible for a bilateral treaty to have more than two parties; for example, each of the bilateral treaties between Switzerland and the European Union (EU) has seventeen parties: The parties are divided into two groups, the Swiss (&quot;on the one part&quot;) and the EU and its member states (&quot;on the other part&quot;). The treaty establishes rights and obligations between the Swiss and the EU and the member states severally—it does not establish any rights and obligations amongst the EU and its member states.

A multilateral treaty is concluded among several countries, establishing rights and obligations between each party and every other party. Multilateral treaties may be regional or may involve states across the world. Treaties of &quot;mutual guarantee&quot; are international compacts, e.g., the Treaty of Locarno which guarantees each signatory against attack from another.

===Role of the United Nations===
The United Nations has extensive power to convene states to enact large-scale multilateral treaties and has experience doing so. Under the United Nations Charter, which is itself a treaty, treaties must be registered with the UN to be invoked before it, or enforced in its judiciary organ, the International Court of Justice. This was done to prevent the practice of secret treaties, which proliferated in the 19th and 20th centuries and often precipitated or exacerbated conflict. Article 103 of the Charter also states that its members&#x27; obligations under the Charter outweigh any competing obligations under other treaties.

After their adoption, treaties, as well as their amendments, must follow the official legal procedures of the United Nations, as applied by the Office of Legal Affairs, including signature, ratification and entry into force.

In function and effectiveness, the UN has been compared to the United States federal government under the Articles of Confederation.

==Adding and amending treaty obligations==

===Reservations===

Reservations are essentially caveats to a state&#x27;s acceptance of a treaty. Reservations are unilateral statements purporting to exclude or to modify the legal obligation and its effects on the reserving state. These must be included at the time of signing or ratification, i.e., &quot;a party cannot add a reservation after it has already joined a treaty&quot;. Article 19 of the Vienna Convention on the law of Treaties in 1969.

Originally, international law was unaccepting of treaty reservations, rejecting them unless all parties to the treaty accepted the same reservations. However, in the interest of encouraging the largest number of states to join treaties, a more permissive rule regarding reservations has emerged. While some treaties still expressly forbid any reservations, they are now generally permitted to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the goals and purposes of the treaty.

When a state limits its treaty obligations through reservations, other states party to that treaty have the option to accept those reservations, object to them, or object and oppose them. If the state accepts them (or fails to act at all), both the reserving state and the accepting state are relieved of the reserved legal obligation as concerns their legal obligations to each other (accepting the reservation does not change the accepting state&#x27;s legal obligations as concerns other parties to the treaty). If the state opposes, the parts of the treaty affected by the reservation drop out completely and no longer create any legal obligations on the reserving and accepting state, again only as concerns each other. Finally, if the state objects and opposes, there are no legal obligations under that treaty between those two state parties whatsoever. The objecting and opposing state essentially refuses to acknowledge the reserving state is a party to the treaty at all.

===Amendments===
There are three ways an existing treaty can be amended. First, a formal amendment requires State parties to the treaty to go through the ratification process all over again. The re-negotiation of treaty provisions can be long and protracted, and often some parties to the original treaty will not become parties to the amended treaty. When determining the legal obligations of states, one party to the original treaty and one party to the amended treaty, the states will only be bound by the terms they both agreed upon. Treaties can also be amended informally by the treaty executive council when the changes are only procedural, technical change in customary international law can also amend a treaty, where state behavior evinces a new interpretation of the legal obligations under the treaty. Minor corrections to a treaty may be adopted by a procès-verbal; but a procès-verbal is generally reserved for changes to rectify obvious errors in the text adopted, i.e., where the text adopted does not correctly reflect the intention of the parties adopting it.

===Protocols===

In international law and international relations, a protocol is generally a treaty or international agreement that supplements a previous treaty or international agreement. A protocol can amend the previous treaty or add additional provisions. Parties to the earlier agreement are not required to adopt the protocol, and this is sometimes made explicit, especially where many parties to the first agreement do not support the protocol.

A notable example is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which established a general framework for the development of binding greenhouse gas emission limits, followed by the Kyoto Protocol contained the specific provisions and regulations later agreed upon.

== Execution and implementation ==

Treaties may be seen as &quot;self-executing&quot;, in that merely becoming a party puts the treaty and all its obligations in action. Other treaties may be non-self-executing and require &quot;implementing legislation&quot;—a change in the domestic law of a state party that will direct or enable it to fulfill treaty obligations. An example of a treaty requiring such legislation would be one mandating local prosecution by a party for particular crimes.

The division between the two is often unclear and subject to disagreements within a government, since a non-self-executing treaty cannot be acted on without the proper change in domestic law; if a treaty requires implementing legislation, a state may default on its obligations due to its legislature failing to pass the necessary domestic laws.

===Interpretation===
The language of treaties, like that of any law or contract, must be interpreted when the wording does not seem clear, or it is not immediately apparent how it should be applied in a perhaps unforeseen circumstance. The Vienna Convention states that treaties are to be interpreted &quot;in good faith&quot; according to the &quot;ordinary meaning given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose&quot;. International legal experts also often invoke the &quot;principle of maximum effectiveness&quot;, which interprets treaty language as having the fullest force and effect possible to establish obligations between the parties.

No one party to a treaty can impose its particular interpretation of the treaty upon the other parties. Consent may be implied, however, if the other parties fail to explicitly disavow that initially unilateral interpretation, particularly if that state has acted upon its view of the treaty without complaint. Consent by all parties to the treaty to a particular interpretation has the legal effect of adding another clause to the treaty – this is commonly called an &quot;authentic interpretation&quot;.

International tribunals and arbiters are often called upon to resolve substantial disputes over treaty interpretations. To establish the meaning in context, these judicial bodies may review the preparatory work from the negotiation and drafting of the treaty as well as the final, signed treaty itself.

===Consequences of terminology===
One significant part of treaty-making is that signing a treaty implies a recognition that the other side is a sovereign state and that the agreement being considered is enforceable under international law. Hence, nations can be very careful about terming an agreement to be a treaty. For example, within the United States, agreements between states are compacts and agreements between states and the federal government or between agencies of the government are memoranda of understanding.
Another situation can occur when one party wishes to create an obligation under international law, but the other party does not. This factor has been at work with respect to discussions between North Korea and the United States over security guarantees and nuclear proliferation.

The definition of the English word &quot;treaty&quot; varies depending on the legal and political context; in some jurisdictions, such as the United States, a treaty is specifically an international agreement that has been ratified, and thus made binding, per the procedures established under domestic law.

=== Enforcement ===
While the Vienna Convention provides a general dispute resolution mechanism, many treaties specify a process outside the convention for arbitrating disputes and alleged breaches. This may by a specially convened panel, by reference to an existing court or panel established for the purpose such as the International Court of Justice, the European Court of Justice or processes such as the Dispute Settlement Understanding of the World Trade Organization. Depending on the treaty, such a process may result in financial penalties or other enforcement action.

==Ending treaty obligations==

===Withdrawal===
Treaties are not necessarily permanently binding upon the signatory parties. As obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states, many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification (&quot;denunciation&quot;). For example, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs provides that the treaty will terminate if, as a result of denunciations, the number of parties falls below 40. Many treaties expressly forbid withdrawal. Article 56 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that where a treaty is silent over whether or not it can be denounced there is a rebuttable presumption that it cannot be unilaterally denounced unless:
* it can be shown that the parties intended to admit the possibility, or
* a right of withdrawal can be inferred from the terms of the treaty.
The possibility of withdrawal depends on the terms of the treaty and its &quot;travaux preparatory. &quot;It has, for example, been held that it is not possible to withdraw from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. When North Korea declared its intention to do this the Secretary-General of the United Nations, acting as registrar, said that original signatories of the ICCPR had not overlooked the possibility of explicitly providing for withdrawal, but rather had deliberately intended not to provide for it. Consequently, withdrawal was not possible.

The Organization of American States (OAS) offers the ability of member states to withdraw from its framework by allowing states to officially inform the General Secretariat of the OAS of such intended withdrawal and being subject to a two-year long sunset period in accordance with Article 143 of the body&#x27;s charter.

In practice, state legislatures or other officials where so structured sometimes use their sovereignty or provisions of supreme law to declare their withdrawal from and stop following the terms of a treaty even if this violates the terms of the treaty. Other parties may accept this outcome, may consider the state to be untrustworthy in future dealings, or may retaliate with sanctions or military action. Withdrawal by one party from a bilateral treaty is typically considered to terminate the treaty. Multilateral treaties typically continue even after the withdrawal of one member, unless the terms of the treaty or mutual agreement causes its termination.

===Suspension and termination===
If a party has materially violated or breached its treaty obligations, the other parties may invoke this breach as grounds for temporarily suspending their obligations to that party under the treaty. A material breach may also be invoked as grounds for permanently terminating the treaty itself.

A treaty breach does not automatically suspend or terminate treaty relations, however. It depends on how the other parties regard the breach and how they resolve to respond to it. Sometimes treaties will provide for the seriousness of a breach to be determined by a tribunal or other independent arbiter. An advantage of such an arbiter is that it prevents a party from prematurely and perhaps wrongfully suspending or terminating its own obligations due to another&#x27;s an alleged material breach.

Treaties sometimes include provisions for self-termination, meaning that the treaty is automatically terminated if certain defined conditions are met. Some treaties are intended by the parties to be only temporarily binding and are set to expire on a given date. Other treaties may self-terminate if the treaty is meant to exist only under certain conditions.

A party may claim that a treaty should be terminated, even absent an express provision, if there has been a fundamental change in circumstances. Such a change is sufficient if unforeseen, if it undermined the &quot;essential basis&quot; of consent by a party if it radically transforms the extent of obligations between the parties, and if the obligations are still to be performed. A party cannot base this claim on change brought about by its own breach of the treaty. This claim also cannot be used to invalidate treaties that established or redrew political boundaries.

==Cartels==
Cartels (&quot;Cartells&quot;, &quot;Cartelle&quot; or &quot;Kartell-Konventionen&quot; in other languages) were a special kind of treaty within the international law of the 17th to 19th centuries. Their purpose was to regulate specific activities of common interest among contracting states that otherwise remained rivals in other areas. They were typically implemented on an administrative level. Similar to the &quot;cartels&quot; for duels and tournaments, these intergovernmental accords represented fairness agreements or gentlemen&#x27;s agreements between states.

In the United States, cartels governed humanitarian actions typically carried out by cartel ships were dispatched for missions, such as to carry communications or prisoners between belligerents.

From the European history, a broader range of purposes is known. These &quot;cartels&quot; often reflected the cohesion of authoritarian ruling classes against their own unruly citizens. Generally, the European governments concluded - while curbing their mutual rivalries partially - cooperation agreements, which should apply generally or only in case of war:
* Deserters, escaped serfs and criminals were to be mutually extradited.
* Prisoners of war should be handed out according to rank in different exchange ratios.
*The maintenance of postal and commercial traffic including the entry and exit of couriers should be guaranteed in the fields of communication and transport. 
* &quot;Customs cartels&quot; (&quot;Zollkartelle&quot;) and &quot;coin cartels&quot; (&quot;Münzkartelle&quot;) were &quot;regulatory&quot; agreements between Continental-European states in the 19th century.
* Against smugglers and counterfeiters, a joint action approach was adopted by the governments contracting on international trade treaties. The latter often contained the relevant &quot;cartel&quot; regulations in their annexes.

The measures against criminals and unruly citizens were to be conducted regardless of the nationality and origin of the relevant persons. If necessary, national borders could be crossed by police forces of the respective neighboring country for capture and arrest. In the course of the 19th century, the term &quot;cartel&quot; (or &quot;Cartell&quot;) gradually disappeared for intergovernmental agreements under international law. Instead, the term &quot;convention&quot; was used.

==Invalid treaties==
An otherwise valid and agreed upon treaty may be rejected as a binding international agreement on several grounds. For example, the Japan–Korea treaties of 1905, 1907, and 1910 were protested by several governments as having been essentially forced upon Korea by Japan; they were confirmed as &quot;already null and void&quot; in the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea.

===&quot;Ultra vires&quot; treaties===
If an act or lack thereof is condemned under international law, the act will not assume international legality even if approved by internal law. This means that in case of a conflict with domestic law, international law will always prevail.

A party&#x27;s consent to a treaty is invalid if it had been given by an agent or body without power to do so under that state&#x27;s domestic laws. States are reluctant to inquire into the internal affairs and processes of other states, and so a &quot;manifest violation&quot; is required such that it would be &quot;objectively evident to any State dealing with the matter&quot;. A strong presumption exists internationally that a head of state has acted within his proper authority. It seems that no treaty has ever actually been invalidated on this provision.

Consent is also invalid if it was given by a representative acting outside their restricted powers during the negotiations, if the other parties to the treaty were notified of those restrictions prior to his or her signing.

===Misunderstanding, fraud, corruption, coercion===

Articles 46–53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties set out the only ways that treaties can be invalidated—considered unenforceable and void under international law. A treaty will be invalidated due to either the circumstances by which a state party joined the treaty or due to the content of the treaty itself. Invalidation is separate from withdrawal, suspension, or termination (addressed above), which all involve an alteration in the consent of the parties of a previously valid treaty rather than the invalidation of that consent in the first place.

A governmental leader&#x27;s consent may be invalidated if there was an erroneous understanding of a fact or situation at the time of conclusion, which formed the &quot;essential basis&quot; of the state&#x27;s consent. Consent will not be invalidated if the misunderstanding was due to the state&#x27;s own conduct, or if the truth should have been evident.

Consent will also be invalidated if it was induced by the fraudulent conduct of another party, or by the direct or indirect &quot;corruption&quot; of its representative by another party to the treaty. Coercion of either a representative or the state itself through the threat or use of force, if used to obtain the consent of that state to a treaty, will invalidate that consent.

===Contrary to peremptory norms===
A treaty is null and void if it is in violation of a peremptory norm. These norms, unlike other principles of customary law, are recognized as permitting no violations and so cannot be altered through treaty obligations. These are limited to such universally accepted prohibitions as those against the aggressive use of force, genocide and other crimes against humanity, piracy, hostilities directed at civilian population, racial discrimination and apartheid, slavery and torture, meaning that no state can legally assume an obligation to commit or permit such acts.

==Treaties under domestic national law==
===Australia===

The constitution of Australia allows the executive government to enter into treaties, but the practice is for treaties to be tabled in both houses of parliament at least 15 days before signing. Treaties are considered a source of Australian law but sometimes require an act of parliament to be passed depending on their nature. Treaties are administered and maintained by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which advised that the &quot;general position under Australian law is that treaties which Australia has joined, apart from those terminating a state of war, are not directly and automatically incorporated into Australian law. Signature and ratification do not, of themselves, make treaties operate domestically. In the absence of legislation, treaties cannot impose obligations on individuals nor create rights in domestic law. Nevertheless, international law, including treaty law, is a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law and may be used in the interpretation of statutes.&quot; Treaties can be implemented by executive action, and often, existing laws are sufficient to ensure a treaty is honored.

Australian treaties generally fall under the following categories: extradition, postal agreements and money orders, trade and international conventions.

===Brazil===
The federal constitution of Brazil states that the power to enter into treaties is vested in the president of Brazil and that such treaties must be approved by the Congress of Brazil (Articles 84, Clause VIII, and 49, Clause I). In practice, that has been interpreted as meaning that the executive branch is free to negotiate and sign a treaty but that its ratification by the president requires the prior approval of Congress. Additionally, the Supreme Federal Court has ruled that after ratification and entry into force, a treaty must be incorporated into domestic law by means of a presidential decree published in the federal register for it to be valid in Brazil and applicable by the Brazilian authorities.

The court has established that treaties are subject to constitutional review and enjoy the same hierarchical position as ordinary legislation (&quot;leis ordinárias&quot;, or &quot;ordinary laws&quot;, in Portuguese). A more recent ruling by the Supreme Court of Brazil in 2008 has altered that somewhat by stating that treaties containing human rights provisions enjoy a status above that of ordinary legislation, subject to only the constitution itself. Additionally, the 45th Amendment to the constitution makes human rights treaties approved by Congress by a special procedure enjoy the same hierarchical position as a constitutional amendment. The hierarchical position of treaties in relation to domestic legislation is of relevance to the discussion on whether and how the latter can abrogate the former and vice versa.

The constitution does not have an equivalent to the supremacy clause in United States Constitution, which is of interest to the discussion on the relation between treaties and legislation of the states of Brazil.

===India===
In India, subjects are divided into three lists: union, state and concurrent. In the normal legislation process, the subjects on the union list must be legislated by the Parliament of India. For subjects on the state list, only the respective state legislature can legislate. For subjects on the concurrent list, both governments can make laws. However, to implement international treaties, Parliament can legislate on any subject and even override the general division of subject lists.

===United States===

In the United States, the term &quot;treaty&quot; has a distinct and more restricted legal definition than in international law. U.S. law distinguishes between &quot;treaties&quot;, as defined in the U.S. Constitution, and &quot;executive agreements&quot;, which are either &quot;congressional-executive agreements&quot; or &quot;sole executive agreements&quot;; although all three classes are equally treaties under international law, they are subject to different political and legal requirements and implications in the U.S.

The distinctions primarily concern the method of approval: Treaties require the &quot;advice and consent&quot; by two-thirds of the Senators present, whereas sole executive agreements are executed by the President acting alone and congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate. The three classifications are not mutually exclusive: A treaty may require a simple majority in Congress before or after it is signed by the President or may grant the President authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols.

Currently, international agreements are ten times more likely to be executed by executive agreement, due to their relative ease. Nevertheless, the President still often chooses to pursue the formal treaty process over an executive agreement to gain congressional support on matters that require Congress to pass implementing legislation or appropriate funds as well as for agreements that impose long-term, complex legal obligations on the U.S. For example, the agreement by the United States, Iran, and other countries is not a treaty under U.S. law, but rather a &quot;political commitment&quot; that does not bind the parties by law.

The nuances and ambiguity of how international agreements are effectuated or implemented in U.S. law has been subject to multiple legal cases. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the &quot;Head Money Cases&quot; (1884) that &quot;treaties&quot; do not have a privileged position over acts of Congress and can be repealed or modified by legislative action just like any other regular law. In a similar vein, the court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Reid v. Covert&quot; (1957) held that treaty provisions that conflict with the U.S. Constitution are null and void under U.S. law. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has also recognized the &quot;supremacy&quot; of treaties in the U.S. Constitution, such as in &quot;Ware v. Hylton&quot; (1796) and &quot;Missouri v. Holland&quot; (1920).

The relative ease by which certain international agreements could be entered into by the President has often prompted congressional pushback, most notably in the proposed Bricker Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which explicitly sought to reign in executive treatymaking powers.

==Treaties and indigenous peoples==

Treaties formed an important part of European colonization; in many parts of the world, Europeans attempted to legitimize their sovereignty by signing treaties with indigenous peoples. In most cases, these treaties were in extremely disadvantageous terms to the native people, who often did not comprehend the implications of what they were signing.

In some rare cases, such as with Ethiopia and Qing China, local governments were able to use the treaties to at least mitigate the impact of European colonization. This involved learning the intricacies of European diplomatic customs and then using the treaties to prevent power from overstepping their agreement or by playing different powers against each other.

In other cases, such as New Zealand with the Māori and Canada with its First Nations people, treaties allowed native peoples to maintain a minimum amount of autonomy. Such treaties between colonizers and indigenous peoples are an important part of political discourse in the late 20th and early 21st century, the treaties being discussed have international standing as has been stated in a treaty study by the UN.

===Australia===

In the case of Indigenous Australians, no treaty was ever entered into with the Indigenous peoples entitling the Europeans to land ownership, mostly adopting the doctrine of &quot;terra nullius&quot; (with the exception of South Australia). This concept was later overturned by &quot;Mabo v Queensland&quot;, which established the concept of native title in Australia well after colonization was already a &quot;fait accompli&quot;.

====Victoria====
On 10 December 2019, the Victorian First Peoples&#x27; Assembly met for the first time in the Upper House of the Parliament of Victoria in Melbourne. The main aim of the Assembly is to work out the rules by which individual treaties would be negotiated between the Victorian Government and individual Aboriginal Victorian peoples. It will also establish an independent Treaty Authority, which will oversee the negotiations between the Aboriginal groups and the Victorian Government and ensure fairness.

===United States===
Prior to 1871, the government of the United States regularly entered into treaties with Native Americans but the Indian Appropriations Act of 3 March 1871 had a rider attached that effectively ended the President&#x27;s treaty-making by providing that no Indian nation or tribe shall be acknowledged as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty. The federal government continued to provide similar contractual relations with the Indian tribes after 1871 by agreements, statutes, and executive orders.

=== Canada ===
Colonization in Canada saw a number of treaties signed between European settlers and Indigenous First Nations peoples. Historic Canadian treaties tend to fall into three broad categories: commercial, alliance, and territorial. Commercial treaties first emerged in the 17th century and were agreements made between the European fur trading companies and the local First Nations. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, a British trading company located in what is now Northern Ontario, signed numerous commercial treaties during this period. Alliance treaties, commonly referred to as &quot;treaties of peace, friendship and alliance&quot; emerged in the late 17th to early 18th century. Finally, territorial treaties dictating land rights were signed between 1760 and 1923. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 accelerated the treaty-making process and provided the Crown with access to large amounts of land occupied by the First Nations. The Crown and 364 First Nations signed 70 treaties that are recognized by the Government of Canada and represent over 600,000 First Nation individuals. The treaties are as follows:

* Treaties of Peace and Neutrality (1701–1760)
* Peace and Friendship Treaties (1725–1779)
* Upper Canada Land Surrenders (including Toronto Purchase(Treaty 13), Johnson-Butler Purchase (Gunshot Treaty)) and the Williams Treaties (1764–1862/1923)
* Robinson Treaties and Douglas Treaties (1850–1854)
* The Numbered Treaties (1871–1921)

==== Treaty perceptions ====
There is evidence that &quot;although both Indigenous and European Nations engaged in treaty-making before contact with each other, the traditions, beliefs, and worldviews that defined concepts such as &quot;treaties&quot; were extremely different&quot;. The Indigenous understanding of treaties is based on traditional culture and values. Maintaining healthy and equitable relationships with other nations, as well as the environment, is paramount. Gdoo-naaganinaa, a historic treaty between the Nishnaabeg nation and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy is an example of how First Nations approach treaties. Under Gdoo-naaganinaa, also referred-to in English as &quot;Our Dish&quot;, the neighbouring nations acknowledged that while they were separate nations they shared the same ecosystem or &quot;Dish&quot;. It was agreed that the nations would respectably share the land, not interfering with the other nation&#x27;s sovereignty while also not monopolizing environmental resources. First Nations agreements, such as the Gdoo-naaganigaa, are considered &quot;living treaties&quot; that must be upheld continually and renewed over time. European settlers in Canada had a different perception of treaties. Treaties were not a living, equitable agreement but rather a legal contract over which the future creation of Canadian law would later rely on. As time passed, the settlers did not think it necessary to abide by all treaty agreements. A review of historic treaties reveals that the European settler understanding is the dominant view portrayed in Canadian treaties.

==== Treaties today ====
Canada today recognizes 25 additional treaties called Modern Treaties. These treaties represent the relationships between 97 Indigenous groups which includes over 89,000 people. The treaties have been instrumental in strengthening Indigenous stronghold in Canada by providing the following (as organized by the Government of Canada) :

* Indigenous ownership over 600,000 km² of land (almost the size of Manitoba)
* capital transfers of over $3.2 billion
* protection of traditional ways of life
* access to resource development opportunities
* participation in land and resources management decisions
* certainty with respect to land rights in round 40% of Canada&#x27;s land mass
* associated self-government rights and political recognition

<text>Transaction Processing Facility (TPF) is an IBM real-time operating system for mainframe computers descended from the IBM System/360 family, including zSeries and System z9.

TPF delivers fast, high-volume, high-throughput transaction processing, handling large, continuous loads of essentially simple transactions across large, geographically dispersed networks.

While there are other industrial-strength transaction processing systems, notably IBM&#x27;s own CICS and IMS, TPF&#x27;s specialty is extreme volume, large numbers of concurrent users, and very fast response times. For example, it handles VISA credit card transaction processing during the peak holiday shopping season.

The TPF passenger reservation application PARS, or its international version IPARS, is used by many airlines. &quot;PARS&quot; is an &quot;application program&quot;; TPF is an operating system.

One of TPF&#x27;s major optional components is a high performance, specialized database facility called &quot;TPF Database Facility&quot; (TPFDF).

A close cousin of TPF, the transaction monitor ALCS, was developed by IBM to integrate TPF services into the more common mainframe operating system MVS, now z/OS.

==History==
TPF evolved from the Airline Control Program (ACP), a free package developed in the mid-1960s by IBM in association with major North American and European airlines. In 1979, IBM introduced TPF as a replacement for ACP — and as a priced software product. The new name suggests its greater scope and evolution into non-airline related entities.

TPF was traditionally an IBM System/370 assembly language environment for performance reasons, and many TPF assembler applications persist. However, more recent versions of TPF encourage the use of C. Another programming language called SabreTalk was born and died on TPF.

IBM announced the delivery of the current release of TPF, dubbed z/TPF V1.1, in September 2005. Most significantly, z/TPF adds 64-bit addressing and mandates use of the 64-bit GNU development tools.

The GCC compiler and the DIGNUS Systems/C++ and Systems/C are the only supported compilers for z/TPF. The Dignus compilers offer reduced source code changes when moving from TPF 4.1 to z/TPF.

==Users==
Current users include Sabre (reservations), VISA Inc. (authorizations), American Airlines, American Express (authorizations), DXC Technology SHARES (reservations), Amtrak, Marriott International, Travelport (Galileo, Apollo, Worldspan), Citibank, Trenitalia (reservations), Delta Air Lines (reservations and operations) and Japan Airlines.

==Operating environment==

===Tightly coupled===
Although IBM&#x27;s 3083 was aimed at running TPF on a &quot;fast... uniprocessor&quot;, TPF is capable of running on a multiprocessor, that is, on systems in which there is more than one CPU. Within the LPAR, the CPUs are referred to as &quot;instruction streams&quot; or simply I-streams. When running on a LPAR with more than one I-stream, TPF is said to be running tightly coupled. TPF adheres to SMP concepts; no concept of NUMA-based distinctions between memory addresses exist.

The depth of the &quot;CPU ready list&quot; is measured as any incoming transaction is received, and queued for the I-stream with the lowest demand, thus maintaining continuous load balancing among available processors. In cases where loosely coupled configurations are populated by multiprocessor CPCs (&quot;Central Processing Complex&quot;, i.e. the physical machine packaged in one &quot;system cabinet&quot;), SMP takes place within the CPC as described here, whereas sharing of inter-CPC resources takes place as described under Loosely coupled, below.

In the TPF architecture, all memory (except for a 4KB-sized &quot;prefix area&quot;) is shared among all I-streams. In instances where memory-resident data must or should be kept separated by I-stream, the programmer typically allocates a storage area into a number of &quot;subsections&quot; equal to the number of I-streams, then accesses the desired I-stream associated area by taking the base address of the allocated area, and adding to it the product of the I-stream relative number times the size of each subsection.

===Loosely coupled===
TPF is capable of supporting multiple mainframes (of any size themselves — be it single I-stream to multiple I-stream) connecting to and operating on a common database. Currently, 32 IBM mainframes may share the TPF database; if such a system were in operation, it would be called 32-way loosely coupled. The simplest loosely coupled system would be two IBM mainframes sharing one DASD (Direct Access Storage Device). In this case, the control program would be equally loaded into memory and each program or record on DASD could be potentially accessed by either mainframe.

In order to serialize accesses between data records on a loosely coupled system, a practice known as record locking must be used. This means that when one mainframe processor obtains a hold on a record, the mechanism must prevent all other processors from obtaining the same hold and communicate to the requesting processors that they are waiting. Within any tightly coupled system, this is easy to manage between I-streams via the use of the Record Hold Table. However, when the lock is obtained offboard of the TPF processor in the DASD control unit, an external process must be used. Historically, the record locking was accomplished in the DASD control unit via an RPQ known as LLF (Limited Locking Facility) and later ELLF (extended). LLF and ELLF were both replaced by the Multipathing Lock Facility (MPLF). To run clustered (loosely coupled) z/TPF requires either MPLF in all disk control units or an alternative locking device called a Coupling Facility.

====Processor shared records====
Records that absolutely must be managed by a record locking process are those which are processor shared. In TPF, most record accesses are done by using record type and ordinal. Given a record type in the TPF system of &#x27;FRED&#x27; with 100 records or ordinals, in a processor shared scheme, record type &#x27;FRED&#x27; ordinal &#x27;5&#x27; would resolve to exactly the same file address on DASD — necessitating the use of a record locking mechanism.

All processor shared records on a TPF system will be accessed via the same file address which will resolve to the same location.

====Processor unique records====
A processor unique record is one that is defined such that each processor expected to be in the loosely coupled complex has a record type of &#x27;FRED&#x27; and perhaps 100 ordinals. However, if a user on any 2 or more processors examines the file address that record type &#x27;FRED&#x27;, ordinal &#x27;5&#x27; resolves to, they will note a different physical address is used.

===What TPF is not===
TPF is not a general-purpose operating system. TPF&#x27;s specialized role is to process transaction input messages, then return output messages on a 1:1 basis at extremely high volume with short maximum elapsed time limits.

TPF has no built-in graphical user interface functionality, and TPF has never offered direct graphical display facilities: to implement it on the host would be considered an unnecessary and potentially harmful diversion of real-time system resources. TPF&#x27;s user interface is command-line driven with simple text display terminals that scroll upward, and there are no mouse-driven cursors, windows, or icons on a TPF &quot;Prime CRAS&quot; (&quot;Computer room agent set&quot; — which is best thought of as the &quot;operator&#x27;s console&quot;). Character messages are intended to be the mode of communications with human users. All work is accomplished via the use of the command line, similar to UNIX without X. There are several products available which connect to Prime CRAS and provide graphical interface functions to the TPF operator, such as &quot;TPF Operations Server&quot;. Graphical interfaces for end users, if desired, must be provided by external systems. Such systems perform analysis on character content (see Screen scrape) and convert the message to/from the desired graphical form, depending on its context.

Being a specialized purpose operating system, TPF does not host a compiler/assembler, text editor, nor implement the concept of a desktop as one might expect to find in a general-purpose operating system. TPF application source code is commonly stored in external systems, and likewise built &quot;offline&quot;. Starting with z/TPF 1.1, Linux is the supported build platform; executable programs intended for z/TPF operation must observe the ELF format for s390x-ibm-linux.

Using TPF requires a knowledge of its &quot;Command Guide&quot; since there is no support for an online command &quot;directory&quot; or &quot;man&quot;/help facility to which users might be accustomed. Commands created and shipped by IBM for the system administration of TPF are called &quot;functional messages&quot;—commonly referred to as &quot;Z-messages&quot;, as they are all prefixed with the letter &quot;Z&quot;. Other letters are reserved so that customers may write their own commands.

TPF implements debugging in a distributed client-server mode, which is necessary because of the system&#x27;s headless, multi-processing nature: pausing the entire system in order to trap a single task would be highly counterproductive. Debugger packages have been developed by third party vendors who took very different approaches to the &quot;break/continue&quot; operations required at the TPF host, implementing unique communications protocols used in traffic between the human developer running the debugger client and the server-side debug controller, as well as the form and function of debugger program operations at the client side. Two examples of third party debugger packages are &quot;Step by Step Trace&quot; from Bedford Associates and &quot;CMSTPF&quot;, &quot;TPF/GI&quot;, and &quot;zTPFGI&quot;, all from TPF Software, Inc. Neither package is wholly compatible with the other, nor with IBM&#x27;s own offering. IBM&#x27;s debugging client offering is packaged in an IDE called &quot;IBM TPF Toolkit&quot;.

TPF is highly optimized to permit messages from the supported network to either be switched out to another location, routed to an application (specific set of programs) or to permit extremely efficient accesses to database records.

====Data records====
Historically, all data on the TPF system had to fit in fixed record (and memory block) sizes of 381, 1055 and 4K bytes. This was due in part to the physical record sizes of blocks located on DASD. Much overhead was saved by freeing up any part of the operating system from breaking large data entities into smaller ones during file operations, and reassembling the same during read operations. Since IBM hardware does I/O via the use of channels and channel programs, TPF would generate very small and efficient channel programs to do its I/O — all in the name of speed. Since the early days also placed a premium on the size of storage media — be it memory or disk, TPF applications evolved into doing very powerful things while using very little resource.

Today, much of these limitations are removed. In fact, only because of legacy support are smaller-than-4K DASD records still used. With the advances made in DASD technology, a read/write of a 4K record is just as efficient as a 1055 byte record. The same advances have increased the capacity of each device so that there is no longer a premium placed on the ability to pack data into the smallest model as possible.

====Programs and residency====
TPF also had its program segments allocated as 381, 1055 and 4K byte-sized records at different points in its history. Each segment consisted of a single record; with a typically comprehensive application requiring perhaps tens or even hundreds of segments. For the first forty years of TPF&#x27;s history, these segments were never link-edited. Instead, the relocatable object code (direct output from the assembler) was laid out in memory, had its &quot;internally&quot; (self-referential) relocatable symbols resolved, then the entire image was written to file for later loading into the system. This created a challenging programming environment in which &quot;segments related to one another could not directly address each other&quot;, with control transfer between them implemented as the ENTER/BACK &quot;system service&quot;.

In ACP/TPF&#x27;s earliest days (circa 1965), memory space was severely limited, which gave rise to a distinction between file-resident and core-resident programs—only the most frequently used application programs were written into memory and never removed (core-residency); the rest were stored on file and read in on demand, with their backing memory buffers released post-execution.

The introduction of C language to TPF at version 3.0 was first implemented conformant to segment conventions, including the absence of linkage editing. This scheme quickly demonstrated itself to be impractical for anything other than the simplest of C programs. At TPF 4.1, truly and fully linked load modules were introduced to TPF. These were compiled with the z/OS C/C++ compiler using TPF-specific header files and linked with IEWL, resulting in a z/OS-conformant load module, which in no manner could be considered a traditional TPF segment. The TPF loader was extended to read the z/OS-unique &quot;load module&quot; file format, then lay out file-resident load modules&#x27; sections into memory; meanwhile, assembly language programs remained confined to TPF&#x27;s &quot;segment&quot; model, creating an obvious disparity between applications written in assembler and those written in higher level languages (HLL).

At z/TPF 1.1, all source language types were conceptually unified and fully link-edited to conform to the ELF specification. The &quot;segment&quot; concept became obsolete, meaning that &quot;any&quot; program written in &quot;any&quot; source language—including Assembler—may now be of any size. Furthermore, external references became possible, and separate source code programs that had once been &quot;segments&quot; could now be directly linked together into a shared object. A value point is that critical legacy applications can benefit from improved efficiency through simple &quot;repackaging&quot;—calls made between members of a single shared object module now have a much shorter pathlength at run time as compared to calling the system&#x27;s &quot;ENTER/BACK&quot; service. Members of the same shared object may now share writeable data regions directly thanks to copy-on-write functionality also introduced at z/TPF 1.1; which coincidentally reinforces TPF&#x27;s reentrancy requirements.

The concepts of file- and memory- residency were also made obsolete, due to a z/TPF design point which sought to have all programs resident in memory at all times.

Since z/TPF had to maintain a call stack for high-level language programs, which gave HLL programs the ability to benefit from stack-based memory allocation, it was deemed beneficial to extend the call stack to assembly language programs on an optional basis, which can ease memory pressure and ease recursive programming.

All z/TPF executable programs are now packaged as ELF shared objects.

====Memory usage====
Historically and in step with the previous, core blocks— memory— were also 381, 1055 and 4 K bytes in size. Since ALL memory blocks had to be of this size, most of the overhead for obtaining memory found in other systems was discarded. The programmer merely needed to decide what size block would fit the need and ask for it. TPF would maintain a list of blocks in use and simply hand out the first block on the available list.

Physical memory was divided into sections reserved for each size so a 1055 byte block always came from a section and returned there, the only overhead needed was to add its address to the appropriate physical block table&#x27;s list. No compaction or data collection was required.

As applications got more advanced demands for memory increased, and once C became available memory chunks of indeterminate or large size were required. This gave rise to the use of heap storage and some memory management routines. To ease the overhead, TPF memory was broken into frames— 4 KB in size (1 MB with z/TPF). If an application needs a certain number of bytes, the number of contiguous frames required to fill that need are granted.

<doc id="30435" wikidata="Q264471" url="?curid=30435" title="Thunderbird (mythology)">
<text>The thunderbird is a mythological bird-like spirit in North American indigenous peoples&#x27; history and culture. It is considered a supernatural being of power and strength.

It is frequently depicted in the art, songs, and oral histories of many Pacific Northwest Coast cultures, but is also found in various forms among some peoples of the American Southwest, US East Coast, Great Lakes, and Great Plains.

== Description ==
The thunderbird is said to create thunder by flapping its wings (Algonquian), and lightning by flashing its eyes (Algonquian, Iroquois). Across cultures, thunderbirds are generally depicted as birds of prey, or hybrids of humans and birds. Thunderbirds are often viewed as protectors, sometimes intervening on people&#x27;s behalf, but expecting veneration, prayers, and gifts.

Archaeologically, sites containing depictions of thunderbirds have been found dating to the past 4,000 years.

Petroglyphs of thunderbirds are found near Twin Bluffs, Wisconsin. They are in a shelter that was probably used c. 250 BCE to 1500.

== By people ==

=== Algonquian ===
The thunderbird myth and motif is prevalent among Algonquian peoples in the Northeast, i.e., Eastern Canada (Ontario, Quebec, and eastward) and Northeastern United States, and the Iroquois peoples (surrounding the Great Lakes). The discussion of the Northeast region has included Algonquian-speaking people in the Lakes-bordering U.S. Midwest states (e.g., Ojibwe in Minnesota).

In Algonquian mythology, the thunderbird controls the upper world while the underworld is governed by the underwater panther or Great Horned Serpent. The thunderbird creates not just thunder (with its wing-flapping) but lightning bolts, which it casts at the underworld creatures.

Thunderbird in this tradition may be depicted as a spreadeagled bird (wings horizontal head in profile), but also quite common with the head facing forward, thus presenting an X-shaped appearance overall (see under §Iconography below).

==== Ojibwe ====
The Ojibwe version of the myth states that the thunderbirds were created by Nanabozho to fight the underwater spirits. Thunderbirds also punished humans who broke moral rules. The thunderbirds lived in the four directions and arrived with the other birds in the springtime. In the fall, they migrated south after the end of the underwater spirits&#x27; most dangerous season.

==== Menominee ====
The Menominee of Northern Wisconsin tell of a great mountain that floats in the western sky on which dwell the thunderbirds. They control the rain and hail, and delight in fighting and deeds of greatness. They are the enemies of the great horned snakes (the Misikinubik) and have prevented these from overrunning the earth and devouring humankind. They are messengers of the Great Sun himself.

=== Siouan ===

The thunderbird motif is also seen in Siouan-speaking peoples, which include tribes traditionally occupying areas around the Great Lakes.

==== Ho-Chunk ====
Ho-Chunk tradition states that a man who has a vision of a thunderbird during a solitary fast will become a war chief of the people.

=== Arikara ===
Ethnographer George Amos Dorsey transcribed a tale from the Arikaras with the title &quot;The Boy who befriended the Thunderbirds and the Serpent&quot;: a boy named Antelope-Carrier finds a nest with four young thunderbirds; their mother comes and tells the human boy that a two-headed Serpent comes out of the lake to eat the young.

== Iconography ==
=== X-shapes ===
In Algonquian images, an X-shaped thunderbird is often used to depict the thunderbird with its wings alongside its body and the head facing forwards instead of in profile.

The depiction may be stylized and simplified. A headless X-shaped thunderbird was found on an Ojibwe &quot;midewiwin&quot; disc dating to 1250–1400 CE. In an 18th-century manuscript (a &quot;daybook&quot; ledger) written by the namesake grandson of Governor Matthew Mayhew, the thunderbird pictograms varies from &quot;recognizable birds to simply an incised X&quot;.

==Scientific interpretations==
American science historian and folklorist Adrienne Mayor and British historian Tom Holland have both suggested that indigenous thunderbird stories are based on discoveries of pterosaur fossils by Native Americans.

==Outside North America==
Similar beings appear in mythologies the world over. Examples include the Chinese thunder-god Leigong, the Hindu Garuda and the African lightning bird.

==In popular culture==

* The shoulder sleeve insignia for the 45th Infantry Division (Oklahoma Army National Guard) was a thunderbird patch after 1939.
* Several X-Men characters go by the name Thunderbird, the first appearing in 1975.
* The Ford Thunderbird is an American car.
* A WWII-era airfield for pilot training in Arizona was called Thunderbird Field, which in turn was the inspiration for other names, including:
** The Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University.
** The 1960s TV show Thunderbirds created by Gerry Anderson.
* In 1925, Aleuts were recorded as using the term to describe the Douglas World Cruiser aircraft which passed through Atka on the first aerial circumnavigation by a US Army team the previous year.
* The Pokémon Zapdos is based on First Nations folklore surrounding the Thunderbird.
* Thunderbird is a roller coaster at Holiday World &amp; Splashin&#x27; Safari in Santa Claus, Indiana.
* Mozilla Thunderbird is a free and open-source cross-platform email client.
* The Thunderbird is the cap badge and symbol of the Canadian Forces Military Police since 1968.
* Various sports teams are called the Thunderbirds or have Thunderbird mascots, including:
** The Seattle Thunderbirds of the Western Hockey League.
** The teams of Southern Utah University, in Cedar City, UT.
** The teams of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver campus.
** The Connetquot School District in Long Island, which was the subject of a lawsuit in 2023.
* Thunderbirds can be recruited as units in 1999 &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic III&quot; and 2002 &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic IV&quot;.

<text>A theory of everything (TOE), final theory, ultimate theory, unified field theory, or master theory is a hypothetical singular, all-encompassing, coherent theoretical framework of physics that fully explains and links together all aspects of the universe. Finding a theory of everything is one of the major unsolved problems in physics.

Over the past few centuries, two theoretical frameworks have been developed that, together, most closely resemble a theory of everything. These two theories upon which all modern physics rests are general relativity and quantum mechanics. General relativity is a theoretical framework that only focuses on gravity for understanding the universe in regions of both large scale and high mass: planets, stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc. On the other hand, quantum mechanics is a theoretical framework that focuses primarily on three non-gravitational forces for understanding the universe in regions of both very small scale and low mass: subatomic particles, atoms, and molecules. Quantum mechanics successfully implemented the Standard Model that describes the three non-gravitational forces: strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and electromagnetic force – as well as all observed elementary particles.

General relativity and quantum mechanics have been repeatedly validated in their separate fields of relevance. Since the usual domains of applicability of general relativity and quantum mechanics are so different, most situations require that only one of the two theories be used. The two theories are considered incompatible in regions of extremely small scale – the Planck scale – such as those that exist within a black hole or during the beginning stages of the universe (i.e., the moment immediately following the Big Bang). To resolve the incompatibility, a theoretical framework revealing a deeper underlying reality, unifying gravity with the other three interactions, must be discovered to harmoniously integrate the realms of general relativity and quantum mechanics into a seamless whole: a theory of everything may be defined as a comprehensive theory that, in principle, would be capable of describing all physical phenomena in the universe. 

In pursuit of this goal, quantum gravity has become one area of active research. One example is string theory, which evolved into a candidate for the theory of everything, but not without drawbacks (most notably, its apparent lack of currently testable predictions) and controversy. String theory posits that at the beginning of the universe (up to 10−43 seconds after the Big Bang), the four fundamental forces were once a single fundamental force. According to string theory, every particle in the universe, at its most ultramicroscopic level (Planck length), consists of varying combinations of vibrating strings (or strands) with preferred patterns of vibration. String theory further claims that it is through these specific oscillatory patterns of strings that a particle of unique mass and force charge is created (that is to say, the electron is a type of string that vibrates one way, while the up quark is a type of string vibrating another way, and so forth). String theory/M-theory proposes six or seven dimensions of spacetime in addition to the four common dimensions for a ten- or eleven-dimensional spacetime.

==Name==
Initially, the term &quot;theory of everything&quot; was used with an ironic reference to various overgeneralized theories. For example, a grandfather of Ijon Tichy – a character from a cycle of Stanisław Lem&#x27;s science fiction stories of the 1960s – was known to work on the &quot;General Theory of Everything&quot;. Physicist Harald Fritzsch used the term in his 1977 lectures in Varenna. Physicist John Ellis claims to have introduced the acronym &quot;TOE&quot; into the technical literature in an article in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1986. Over time, the term stuck in popularizations of theoretical physics research.

==Historical antecedents==

===Antiquity to 19th century===
Many ancient cultures such as Babylonian astronomers and Indian astronomy studied the pattern of the &quot;Seven Sacred Luminaires&quot;/Classical Planets against the background of stars, with their interest being to relate celestial movement to human events (astrology), and the goal being to predict events by recording events against a time measure and then look for recurrent patterns. The debate between the universe having either a beginning or eternal cycles can be traced to ancient Babylonia. Hindu cosmology posits that time is infinite with a &quot;cyclic universe&quot;, where the current universe was preceded and will be followed by an infinite number of universes. Time scales mentioned in Hindu cosmology correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology. Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahma, 8.64 billion years long.

The natural philosophy of atomism appeared in several ancient traditions. In ancient Greek philosophy, the pre-Socratic philosophers speculated that the apparent diversity of observed phenomena was due to a single type of interaction, namely the motions and collisions of atoms. The concept of &#x27;atom&#x27; proposed by Democritus was an early philosophical attempt to unify phenomena observed in nature. The concept of &#x27;atom&#x27; also appeared in the Nyaya-Vaisheshika school of ancient Indian philosophy.

Archimedes was possibly the first philosopher to have described nature with axioms (or principles) and then deduce new results from them. Any &quot;theory of everything&quot; is similarly expected to be based on axioms and to deduce all observable phenomena from them.

Following earlier atomistic thought, the mechanical philosophy of the 17th century posited that all forces could be ultimately reduced to contact forces between the atoms, then imagined as tiny solid particles.

In the late 17th century, Isaac Newton&#x27;s description of the long-distance force of gravity implied that not all forces in nature result from things coming into contact. Newton&#x27;s work in his &quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot; dealt with this in a further example of unification, in this case unifying Galileo&#x27;s work on terrestrial gravity, Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion and the phenomenon of tides by explaining these apparent actions at a distance under one single law: the law of universal gravitation. Newton achieved the first great unification in physics, and he further is credited with laying the foundations of future endeavors for a grand unified theory.

In 1814, building on these results, Laplace famously suggested that a sufficiently powerful intellect could, if it knew the position and velocity of every particle at a given time, along with the laws of nature, calculate the position of any particle at any other time:

Laplace thus envisaged a combination of gravitation and mechanics as a theory of everything. Modern quantum mechanics implies that uncertainty is inescapable, and thus that Laplace&#x27;s vision has to be amended: a theory of everything must include gravitation and quantum mechanics. Even ignoring quantum mechanics, chaos theory is sufficient to guarantee that the future of any sufficiently complex mechanical or astronomical system is unpredictable.

In 1820, Hans Christian Ørsted discovered a connection between electricity and magnetism, triggering decades of work that culminated in 1865, in James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electromagnetism, which achieved the second great unification in physics. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, it gradually became apparent that many common examples of forces – contact forces, elasticity, viscosity, friction, and pressure – result from electrical interactions between the smallest particles of matter.

In his experiments of 1849–1850, Michael Faraday was the first to search for a unification of gravity with electricity and magnetism. However, he found no connection.

In 1900, David Hilbert published a famous list of mathematical problems. In Hilbert&#x27;s sixth problem, he challenged researchers to find an axiomatic basis to all of physics. In this problem he thus asked for what today would be called a theory of everything.

===Early 20th century===
In the late 1920s, the then new quantum mechanics showed that the chemical bonds between atoms were examples of (quantum) electrical forces, justifying Dirac&#x27;s boast that &quot;the underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known&quot;.

After 1915, when Albert Einstein published the theory of gravity (general relativity), the search for a unified field theory combining gravity with electromagnetism began with a renewed interest. In Einstein&#x27;s day, the strong and the weak forces had not yet been discovered, yet he found the potential existence of two other distinct forces, gravity and electromagnetism, far more alluring. This launched his 40-year voyage in search of the so-called &quot;unified field theory&quot; that he hoped would show that these two forces are really manifestations of one grand, underlying principle. During the last few decades of his life, this ambition alienated Einstein from the rest of mainstream of physics, as the mainstream was instead far more excited about the emerging framework of quantum mechanics. Einstein wrote to a friend in the early 1940s, &quot;I have become a lonely old chap who is mainly known because he doesn&#x27;t wear socks and who is exhibited as a curiosity on special occasions.&quot; Prominent contributors were Gunnar Nordström, Hermann Weyl, Arthur Eddington, David Hilbert, Theodor Kaluza, Oskar Klein (see Kaluza–Klein theory), and most notably, Albert Einstein and his collaborators. Einstein searched in earnest for, but ultimately failed to find, a unifying theory (see Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations).

===Late 20th century and the nuclear interactions===
In the 20th century, the search for a unifying theory was interrupted by the discovery of the strong and weak nuclear forces, which differ both from gravity and from electromagnetism. A further hurdle was the acceptance that in a theory of everything, quantum mechanics had to be incorporated from the outset, rather than emerging as a consequence of a deterministic unified theory, as Einstein had hoped.

Gravity and electromagnetism are able to coexist as entries in a list of classical forces, but for many years it seemed that gravity could not be incorporated into the quantum framework, let alone unified with the other fundamental forces. For this reason, work on unification, for much of the 20th century, focused on understanding the three forces described by quantum mechanics: electromagnetism and the weak and strong forces. The first two were combined in 1967–1968 by Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg, and Abdus Salam into the electroweak force.
Electroweak unification is a broken symmetry: the electromagnetic and weak forces appear distinct at low energies because the particles carrying the weak force, the W and Z bosons, have non-zero masses ( and , respectively), whereas the photon, which carries the electromagnetic force, is massless. At higher energies W bosons and Z bosons can be created easily and the unified nature of the force becomes apparent.

While the strong and electroweak forces coexist under the Standard Model of particle physics, they remain distinct. Thus, the pursuit of a theory of everything remained unsuccessful: neither a unification of the strong and electroweak forces – which Laplace would have called &#x27;contact forces&#x27; – nor a unification of these forces with gravitation had been achieved.

==Modern physics==

===Conventional sequence of theories===
A theory of everything would unify all the fundamental interactions of nature: gravitation, the strong interaction, the weak interaction, and electromagnetism. Because the weak interaction can transform elementary particles from one kind into another, the theory of everything should also predict all the different kinds of particles possible. The usual assumed path of theories is given in the following graph, where each unification step leads one level up on the graph.





In this graph, electroweak unification occurs at around 100 GeV, grand unification is predicted to occur at 1016 GeV, and unification of the GUT force with gravity is expected at the Planck energy, roughly 1019 GeV.

Several Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) have been proposed to unify electromagnetism and the weak and strong forces. Grand unification would imply the existence of an electronuclear force; it is expected to set in at energies of the order of 1016 GeV, far greater than could be reached by any currently feasible particle accelerator. Although the simplest grand unified theories have been experimentally ruled out, the idea of a grand unified theory, especially when linked with supersymmetry, remains a favorite candidate in the theoretical physics community. Supersymmetric grand unified theories seem plausible not only for their theoretical &quot;beauty&quot;, but because they naturally produce large quantities of dark matter, and because the inflationary force may be related to grand unified theory physics (although it does not seem to form an inevitable part of the theory). Yet grand unified theories are clearly not the final answer; both the current standard model and all proposed GUTs are quantum field theories which require the problematic technique of renormalization to yield sensible answers. This is usually regarded as a sign that these are only effective field theories, omitting crucial phenomena relevant only at very high energies.

The final step in the graph requires resolving the separation between quantum mechanics and gravitation, often equated with general relativity. Numerous researchers concentrate their efforts on this specific step; nevertheless, no accepted theory of quantum gravity, and thus no accepted theory of everything, has emerged with observational evidence. It is usually assumed that the theory of everything will also solve the remaining problems of grand unified theories.

In addition to explaining the forces listed in the graph, a theory of everything may also explain the status of at least two candidate forces suggested by modern cosmology: an inflationary force and dark energy. Furthermore, cosmological experiments also suggest the existence of dark matter, supposedly composed of fundamental particles outside the scheme of the standard model. However, the existence of these forces and particles has not been proven.

===String theory and M-theory===
Since the 1990s, some physicists such as Edward Witten believe that 11-dimensional M-theory, which is described in some limits by one of the five perturbative superstring theories, and in another by the maximally-supersymmetric eleven-dimensional supergravity, is the theory of everything. There is no widespread consensus on this issue.

One remarkable property of string/M-theory is that seven extra dimensions are required for the theory&#x27;s consistency, on top of the four dimensions in our universe. In this regard, string theory can be seen as building on the insights of the Kaluza–Klein theory, in which it was realized that applying general relativity to a 5-dimensional universe, with one space dimension small and curled up, looks from the 4-dimensional perspective like the usual general relativity together with Maxwell&#x27;s electrodynamics. This lent credence to the idea of unifying gauge and gravity interactions, and to extra dimensions, but did not address the detailed experimental requirements. Another important property of string theory is its supersymmetry, which together with extra dimensions are the two main proposals for resolving the hierarchy problem of the standard model, which is (roughly) the question of why gravity is so much weaker than any other force. The extra-dimensional solution involves allowing gravity to propagate into the other dimensions while keeping other forces confined to a 4-dimensional spacetime, an idea that has been realized with explicit stringy mechanisms.

Research into string theory has been encouraged by a variety of theoretical and experimental factors. On the experimental side, the particle content of the standard model supplemented with neutrino masses fits into a spinor representation of SO(10), a subgroup of E8 that routinely emerges in string theory, such as in heterotic string theory or (sometimes equivalently) in F-theory. String theory has mechanisms that may explain why fermions come in three hierarchical generations, and explain the mixing rates between quark generations. On the theoretical side, it has begun to address some of the key questions in quantum gravity, such as resolving the black hole information paradox, counting the correct entropy of black holes and allowing for topology-changing processes. It has also led to many insights in pure mathematics and in ordinary, strongly-coupled gauge theory due to the Gauge/String duality.

In the late 1990s, it was noted that one major hurdle in this endeavor is that the number of possible 4-dimensional universes is incredibly large. The small, &quot;curled up&quot; extra dimensions can be compactified in an enormous number of different ways (one estimate is 10500 ) each of which leads to different properties for the low-energy particles and forces. This array of models is known as the string theory landscape.

One proposed solution is that many or all of these possibilities are realized in one or another of a huge number of universes, but that only a small number of them are habitable. Hence what we normally conceive as the fundamental constants of the universe are ultimately the result of the anthropic principle rather than dictated by theory. This has led to criticism of string theory, arguing that it cannot make useful (i.e., original, falsifiable, and verifiable) predictions and regarding it as a pseudoscience/philosophy. Others disagree, and string theory remains an active topic of investigation in theoretical physics.

===Loop quantum gravity===
Current research on loop quantum gravity may eventually play a fundamental role in a theory of everything, but that is not its primary aim. Loop quantum gravity also introduces a lower bound on the possible length scales.

There have been recent claims that loop quantum gravity may be able to reproduce features resembling the Standard Model. So far only the first generation of fermions (leptons and quarks) with correct parity properties have been modelled by Sundance Bilson-Thompson using preons constituted of braids of spacetime as the building blocks. However, there is no derivation of the Lagrangian that would describe the interactions of such particles, nor is it possible to show that such particles are fermions, nor that the gauge groups or interactions of the Standard Model are realised. Use of quantum computing concepts made it possible to demonstrate that the particles are able to survive quantum fluctuations.

This model leads to an interpretation of electric and color charge as topological quantities (electric as number and chirality of twists carried on the individual ribbons and colour as variants of such twisting for fixed electric charge).

Bilson-Thompson&#x27;s original paper suggested that the higher-generation fermions could be represented by more complicated braidings, although explicit constructions of these structures were not given. The electric charge, color, and parity properties of such fermions would arise in the same way as for the first generation. The model was expressly generalized for an infinite number of generations and for the weak force bosons (but not for photons or gluons) in a 2008 paper by Bilson-Thompson, Hackett, Kauffman and Smolin.

===Other attempts===
Among other attempts to develop a theory of everything is the theory of causal fermion systems, giving the two current physical theories (general relativity and quantum field theory) as limiting cases.

Another theory is called Causal Sets. As some of the approaches mentioned above, its direct goal isn&#x27;t necessarily to achieve a theory of everything but primarily a working theory of quantum gravity, which might eventually include the standard model and become a candidate for a theory of everything. Its founding principle is that spacetime is fundamentally discrete and that the spacetime events are related by a partial order. This partial order has the physical meaning of the causality relations between relative past and future distinguishing spacetime events.

Causal dynamical triangulation does not assume any pre-existing arena (dimensional space), but rather attempts to show how the spacetime fabric itself evolves.

Another attempt may be related to ER=EPR, a conjecture in physics stating that entangled particles are connected by a wormhole (or Einstein–Rosen bridge).

===Present status===
At present, there is no candidate theory of everything that includes the standard model of particle physics and general relativity and that, at the same time, is able to calculate the fine-structure constant or the mass of the electron. Most particle physicists expect that the outcome of ongoing experiments – the search for new particles at the large particle accelerators and for dark matter – are needed in order to provide further input for a theory of everything.

==Arguments against==
In parallel to the intense search for a theory of everything, various scholars have debated the possibility of its discovery.

===Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem===
A number of scholars claim that Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem suggests that attempts to construct a theory of everything are bound to fail. Gödel&#x27;s theorem, informally stated, asserts that any formal theory sufficient to express elementary arithmetical facts and strong enough for them to be proved is either inconsistent (both a statement and its denial can be derived from its axioms) or incomplete, in the sense that there is a true statement that can&#x27;t be derived in the formal theory.

Stanley Jaki, in his 1966 book &quot;The Relevance of Physics&quot;, pointed out that, because a &quot;theory of everything&quot; will certainly be a consistent non-trivial mathematical theory, it must be incomplete. He claims that this dooms searches for a deterministic theory of everything.

Freeman Dyson has stated that &quot;Gödel&#x27;s theorem implies that pure mathematics is inexhaustible. No matter how many problems we solve, there will always be other problems that cannot be solved within the existing rules. […] Because of Gödel&#x27;s theorem, physics is inexhaustible too. The laws of physics are a finite set of rules, and include the rules for doing mathematics, so that Gödel&#x27;s theorem applies to them.&quot;

Stephen Hawking was originally a believer in the Theory of Everything, but after considering Gödel&#x27;s Theorem, he concluded that one was not obtainable. &quot;Some people will be very disappointed if there is not an ultimate theory that can be formulated as a finite number of principles. I used to belong to that camp, but I have changed my mind.&quot;

Jürgen Schmidhuber (1997) has argued against this view; he asserts that Gödel&#x27;s theorems are irrelevant for computable physics. In 2000, Schmidhuber explicitly constructed limit-computable, deterministic universes whose pseudo-randomness based on undecidable, Gödel-like halting problems is extremely hard to detect but does not prevent formal theories of everything describable by very few bits of information.

Related critique was offered by Solomon Feferman and others. Douglas S. Robertson offers Conway&#x27;s game of life as an example: The underlying rules are simple and complete, but there are formally undecidable questions about the game&#x27;s behaviors. Analogously, it may (or may not) be possible to completely state the underlying rules of physics with a finite number of well-defined laws, but there is little doubt that there are questions about the behavior of physical systems which are formally undecidable on the basis of those underlying laws.

Since most physicists would consider the statement of the underlying rules to suffice as the definition of a &quot;theory of everything&quot;, most physicists argue that Gödel&#x27;s Theorem does &quot;not&quot; mean that a theory of everything cannot exist. On the other hand, the scholars invoking Gödel&#x27;s Theorem appear, at least in some cases, to be referring not to the underlying rules, but to the understandability of the behavior of all physical systems, as when Hawking mentions arranging blocks into rectangles, turning the computation of prime numbers into a physical question. This definitional discrepancy may explain some of the disagreement among researchers.

===Fundamental limits in accuracy===
No physical theory to date is believed to be precisely accurate. Instead, physics has proceeded by a series of &quot;successive approximations&quot; allowing more and more accurate predictions over a wider and wider range of phenomena. Some physicists believe that it is therefore a mistake to confuse theoretical models with the true nature of reality, and hold that the series of approximations will never terminate in the &quot;truth&quot;. Einstein himself expressed this view on occasions.

===Definition of fundamental laws===

There is a philosophical debate within the physics community as to whether a theory of everything deserves to be called &quot;the&quot; fundamental law of the universe. One view is the hard reductionist position that the theory of everything is the fundamental law and that all other theories that apply within the universe are a consequence of the theory of everything. Another view is that emergent laws, which govern the behavior of complex systems, should be seen as equally fundamental. Examples of emergent laws are the second law of thermodynamics and the theory of natural selection. The advocates of emergence argue that emergent laws, especially those describing complex or living systems are independent of the low-level, microscopic laws. In this view, emergent laws are as fundamental as a theory of everything.

The debates do not make the point at issue clear. Possibly the only issue at stake is the right to apply the high-status term &quot;fundamental&quot; to the respective subjects of research. A well-known debate over this took place between Steven Weinberg and Philip Anderson.

====Impossibility of calculation====
Weinberg points out that calculating the precise motion of an actual projectile in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is impossible. So how can we know we have an adequate theory for describing the motion of projectiles? Weinberg suggests that we know &quot;principles&quot; (Newton&#x27;s laws of motion and gravitation) that work &quot;well enough&quot; for simple examples, like the motion of planets in empty space. These principles have worked so well on simple examples that we can be reasonably confident they will work for more complex examples. For example, although general relativity includes equations that do not have exact solutions, it is widely accepted as a valid theory because all of its equations with exact solutions have been experimentally verified. Likewise, a theory of everything must work for a wide range of simple examples in such a way that we can be reasonably confident it will work for every situation in physics. Difficulties in creating a theory of everything often begin to appear when combining quantum mechanics with the theory of general relativity, as the equations of quantum mechanics begin to falter when the force of gravity is applied to them.

<text>Tutankhamun or Tutankhamen, (; ), was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh who ruled during the late Eighteenth Dynasty of ancient Egypt. Born Tutankhaten, he was likely a son of Akhenaten, thought to be buried in KV55. His mother was identified through DNA testing as The Younger Lady buried in KV35; she was a full sister of her husband.

Tutankhamun acceded to the throne around the age of nine following the short reigns of his predecessors Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten. He married his presumed half-sister Ankhesenpaaten, who was probably the mother of his two infant daughters. During his reign he restored the traditional polytheistic form of ancient Egyptian religion, undoing a previous shift to the religion known as Atenism. His endowments and restorations of cults were recorded on what is today known as the &quot;Restoration Stela.&quot; The cult of the god Amun at Thebes was restored to prominence, and the royal couple changed their names to &quot;Tutankhamun&quot; and &quot;Ankhesenamun&quot;, replacing the -aten suffix. He also moved the royal court from Akhenaten&#x27;s capital, Amarna, back to Memphis. He reestablished diplomatic relations with the Mitanni and carried out military campaigns in Nubia and the Near East. Tutankhamun was one of only a few kings who was worshipped as a deity during his lifetime. The young king likely began construction of a royal tomb in the Valley of the Kings and an accompanying mortuary temple, but both were unfinished at the time of his death.

Tutankhamun died unexpectedly aged about 18; his health and the cause of his death have been the subject of much debate. In 2012 it was suggested he died from a combination of malaria and a leg fracture. Since his royal tomb was incomplete, he was instead buried in a small non-royal tomb adapted for the purpose. He was succeeded by his vizier Ay, who was probably an old man when he became king, and had a short reign. Ay was succeeded by Horemheb, who had been the commander-in-chief of Tutankhamun&#x27;s armed forces. Under Horemheb, the restoration of the traditional ancient Egyptian religion was completed; Ay and Tutankhamun&#x27;s constructions were usurped and earlier Amarna Period rulers were erased.

In modern times, Tutankhamun became famous as a result of the 1922 discovery of his tomb (KV62) by a team led by the British Egyptologist Howard Carter and sponsored by the British aristocrat George Herbert. Although it had clearly been raided and robbed in ancient times, it retained much of its original contents, including the king&#x27;s undisturbed mummy. The discovery received worldwide press coverage; with over 5,000 artifacts, it gave rise to renewed public interest in ancient Egypt, for which Tutankhamun&#x27;s mask, now preserved at the Egyptian Museum, remains a popular symbol. Some of his treasure has traveled worldwide, with unprecedented response; the Egyptian government allowed tours of the tomb beginning in 1961. The deaths of some individuals who were involved in the excavation have been popularly attributed to the &quot;curse of the pharaohs&quot; due to the similarity of their circumstances. Since the discovery of his tomb, he has been referred to colloquially as &quot;King Tut&quot;.

==Family==
Tutankhamun was born in the reign of Akhenaten, during the Amarna Period of the late Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. His original name was Tutankhaten or Tutankhuaten, meaning &quot;living image of Aten&quot;, reflecting the shift in ancient Egyptian religion known as Atenism which characterized Akhenaten&#x27;s reign.

===Parentage ===
His parentage is debated as they are not attested in surviving inscriptions. He was certainly a prince, as a fragmentary inscription from Hermopolis refers to &quot;Tutankhuaten&quot; as a &quot;king&#x27;s son&quot;. He is generally thought to have been the son of Akhenaten or his successor Smenkhkare. Inscriptions from Tutankhamun&#x27;s reign treat him as a son of Akhenaten&#x27;s father, Amenhotep III, but that is only possible if Akhenaten&#x27;s 17-year reign included a long co-regency with his father, a possibility that many Egyptologists once supported but is now being abandoned. His mother has been variously suggested to be Akhenaten&#x27;s chief wife Nefertiti, Amenhotep III&#x27;s daughter Beketaten, or Akhenaten&#x27;s daughters Meritaten or Meketaten. Tutankhamun was wet nursed by a woman named Maia, known from her tomb at Saqqara.

DNA testing identified his father as the mummy from tomb KV55, thought to be Akhenaten, and his mother as &quot;The Younger Lady&quot;, an anonymous mummy cached in tomb KV35. His parents were full siblings, both being children of Amenhotep III and his chief wife Tiye. The identity of The Younger Lady is unknown but she cannot be Nefertiti, as she was not known to be a sister of Akhenaten. However, researchers such as Marc Gabolde and Aidan Dodson claim that Nefertiti was indeed Tutankhamun&#x27;s mother. In this interpretation of the DNA results, the genetic closeness is not due to a brother-sister pairing but the result of three generations of first-cousin marriage, making Nefertiti a first cousin of Akhenaten. The validity and reliability of the genetic data from mummified remains has been questioned due to possible degradation due to decay.

===Children===

When Tutankhaten became king, he married Ankhesenpaaten, one of Akhenaten&#x27;s daughters, who later changed her name to Ankhesenamun. He fathered two daughters who died at or soon after birth and were buried with him in his tomb. Computed tomography studies published in 2011 revealed that one daughter was born prematurely at 5–6 months of pregnancy and the other at full-term, 9 months. DNA testing has suggested the anonymous mummy KV21A is their mother but the data is not statistically significant enough to allow her to be securely identified as his only known wife, Ankhesenamun. Tutankhamun&#x27;s death marked the end of the royal bloodline of the Eighteenth Dynasty.

===Genealogy and population affinities===

A genetic study, published in 2020, revealed Tutankhamun had the haplogroups YDNA R1b, which originated in western Asia and which today makes up 50–60% of the genetic pool of modern Europeans, and mtDNA K, which originated in the Near East. He shares this Y-haplogroup with his father, the KV55 mummy (Akhenaten), and grandfather, Amenhotep III, and his mtDNA haplogroup with his mother, The Younger Lady, his grandmother, Tiye, and his great-grandmother, Thuya. The profiles for Tutankhamun and Amenhotep III were incomplete and the analysis produced differing probability figures despite having concordant allele results. Because the relationships of these two mummies with the KV55 mummy had previously been confirmed in an earlier study, the haplogroup prediction of both mummies could be derived from the full profile of the KV55 data

In 2022, S.O.Y. Keita analysed 8 Short Tandem loci (STR) data originally published by Hawass et al. in studies from 2010 and 2012. The first of these studies had investigated familial relationships among 11 royal mummies of the New Kingdom, which included Tutankhamun and Amenhotep III, as well as potential inherited disorders and infectious diseases. The second of these studies had investigated the Y-haplogroups and genetic kinship of Ramesses III and an unknown man buried along with him in the royal cache at Deir el Bahari. Keita analysed the STR data from these studies using an algorithm that only has three choices: Eurasians, sub-Saharan Africans, and East Asians. Using these three options, Keita concluded that the majority of the samples had a population &quot;affinity with &#x27;sub-Saharan&#x27; Africans in one affinity analysis&quot;. However, Keita cautioned that this does not mean that the royal mummies &quot;lacked other affiliations&quot;, which he argued had been obscured in typological thinking. Keita further added that different &quot;data and algorithms might give different results&quot;, reflecting the complexity of biological heritage and the associated interpretation.

==Reign==

Tutankhamun became pharaoh between eight and nine years of age following the short reigns of Akhenaten&#x27;s successors Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten. It is uncertain whether Smenkhkare&#x27;s reign outlasted Akhenaten&#x27;s; the female ruler Neferneferuaten is now thought to have become co-regent shortly before Akhenaten&#x27;s death and to have reigned for some time after it. On acceding the throne, Tutankhamun took the throne name Nebkheperure. He reigned for about nine years.

During Tutankhamun&#x27;s reign the position of Vizier was split between Upper and Lower Egypt. The principal vizier for Upper Egypt was Usermontu. Another figure named Pentju was also vizier but it is unclear of which lands. It is not entirely known if Ay, Tutankhamun&#x27;s successor, actually held this position. A gold foil fragment from KV58 seems to indicate, but not certainly, that Ay was referred to as a Priest of Maat along with an epithet of &quot;vizier, doer of maat.&quot; The epithet does not fit the usual description used by the regular vizier but might indicate an informal title. It might be that Ay used the title of vizier in an unprecedented manner.

An Egyptian priest named Manetho wrote a comprehensive history of ancient Egypt where he refers to a king named Orus, who ruled for 36 years and had a daughter named Acencheres who reigned twelve years and her brother Rathotis who ruled for only nine years. The Amarna rulers are central in the list but which name corresponds with which historic figure is not agreed upon by researchers. Orus and Acencheres have been identified with Horemheb and Akhenaten and Rathotis with Tutankhamun. The names are also associated with Smenkhkare, Amenhotep III, Ay and the others in differing order.

In order for the pharaoh, who held divine office, to be linked to the people and the gods, special epithets were created for them at their accession to the throne. The ancient Egyptian titulary also served to demonstrate one&#x27;s qualities and link them to the terrestrial realm. The five names were developed over the centuries beginning with the Horus name. Tutankhamun&#x27;s original nomen, &quot;Tutankhaten&quot;, did not have a Nebty name or a Gold Falcon name associated with it as nothing has been found with the full five-name protocol.

===Religiopolitical countermand===

At the beginning of Tutankhaten&#x27;s reign, the royal court was still located at Amarna, and evidence from his tomb shows that the Aten was still acknowledged. But several pieces of evidence suggest that his court was trying to reconcile Atenism with the traditional religion, and activity at Amarna decreased during the first four years of his reign.

These years saw dramatic reversals of Akhenaten&#x27;s policies, which, given the king&#x27;s young age, must have been instigated by his advisors. In the third year of Tutankhaten&#x27;s reign, his name was changed to &quot;Tutankhamun&quot;, and that of his queen to &quot;Akhesenamun&quot;. The Restoration Stela, which probably dates to Year 4 of Tutankhamun&#x27;s reign, characterizes the Amarna Period as a time of disaster, saying &quot;temples and the estates of the gods and goddesses from Elephantine to the marshes of the Delta had fallen into ruin… If you asked a god for advice, he would not attend; and if one spoke to a goddess likewise she would not attend.&quot; The stela proclaims the rebuilding of the traditional cults; priests and other members of temple staffs were restored to their former positions.

Around this time, the royal court abandoned Amarna. Memphis became the main seat of royal administration, continuing a trend that dated back to Akhenaten&#x27;s predecessors, toward administering the country from that central location rather than the more outlying site of Thebes. With Amun restored as Egypt&#x27;s preeminent deity, Thebes once again became its greatest center of religious activity.

Tutankhamun enriched and endowed the priestly orders of two important cults, initiated a restoration process for old monuments that were damaged during the Amarna Period, and reburied his father&#x27;s remains in the Valley of the Kings.
Given his age, the king probably had advisers which presumably included Ay (who succeeded Tutankhamun) and General Horemheb, Ay&#x27;s possible son in law and successor. Horemheb records that the king appointed him &quot;lord of the land&quot; as hereditary prince to maintain law. He also noted his ability to calm the young king when his temper flared.

In his third regnal year Tutankhamun reversed several changes made during his father&#x27;s reign. He ended the worship of the god Aten and restored the god Amun to supremacy. The ban on the cult of Amun was lifted and traditional privileges were restored to its priesthood. The capital was moved back to Thebes and the city of Akhetaten was abandoned. As part of the restoration of the traditional cults, the king initiated building projects, in particular at Karnak in Thebes, where he laid out the sphinx avenue leading to the temple of Mut. The sphinxes were originally made for Akhenaten and Nefertiti; they were given new ram heads and small statues of the king. At Luxor temple he completed the decoration of the entrance colonnade of Amenhotep III. Tutankhamun made several endowments that enriched and added to the priestly numbers of the cults of Amun and Ptah. He commissioned new statues of the deities from the best metals and stone and had new processional barques made of the finest cedar from Lebanon and had them embellished with gold and silver.

A building called the Temple-of-Nebkheperure-Beloved-of-Amun-Who-Puts-Thebes-in-Order, which may be identical to a building called Temple-of-Nebkheperre-in-Thebes, a possible mortuary temple, used recycled talatat from Akhenaten&#x27;s east Karnak Aten temples indicating that the dismantling of these temples was already underway. Many of Tutankhamun&#x27;s construction projects were uncompleted at the time of his death and were completed by or usurped by his successors, especially Horemheb. The sphinx avenue was completed by his successor Ay and the whole was usurped by Horemheb. The Restoration Stele was usurped by Horemheb; pieces of the Temple-of-Nebkheperure-in-Thebes were recycled into Horemheb&#x27;s own building projects.

====During-life deification====
In ancient Egypt, pharaohs were venerated after their deaths through mortuary cults and associated temples as deities. This form of apotheosis was typically reserved for deceased pharaohs, but Tutankhamun was one of the few pharaohs who was worshiped in this manner during his lifetime. Temples of his cult were built as far away as in Kawa and Faras in Nubia. The title of the sister of the Viceroy of Kush included a reference to the deified king, indicative of the universality of his cult.
The Stela of Huy from Karnak Temple is also evidential of the lifetime deification of pharaoh Tutankhamun. It contains a hymn directed to the deified form of Tutankhamun. Below is an English translation
Give praises the ka of Amun, lord of Karnak homage to Amun, by whom swear the Two Lands&lt;br&gt;
and ... to the royal ka of Tutankhamun:&lt;br&gt;
that they may give a happy lifetime and a body, joyful, every day, to the ka of the royal son of Kush, the overseer of the countries of the south, Huy&lt;br&gt;
The hymn clearly regards Tutankhamun with equivalent divinity as the god Amun. The stela suggests that Tutankhamun as a deity can be appealed to for forgiveness to free the petitioner from an ailment caused by sin.

===Military campaigns===

The country was economically weak and in turmoil following the reign of Akhenaten. Diplomatic relations with other kingdoms had been neglected, and Tutankhamun sought to restore them, in particular with the Mitanni. Evidence of his success is suggested by the gifts from various countries found in his tomb. Despite his efforts for improved relations, battles with Nubians and Asiatics were recorded in his mortuary temple at Thebes, both victories for Egypt. Also, as far as is known, Tutankhamun&#x27;s military reign was undefeated, and is one of several other undefeated reigns in ancient Egypt&#x27;s history.

====Battle participation====

The extent to which Tutankhamun participated in battles is an open question and has yet to reach consensus among researchers. On one hand, his tomb contained extensive military armament, such as bows, khopesh swords, daggers, wristguards, maces, shields and a club, suggesting he had extensive weaponry training. Some imagery, while likely figurative, does depict Tutankhamun as directly participatory in warfare, such as the graphic battle depictions on the painted treasure chest in his tomb. Other artifacts, such as the Nine Bows footstool, walking sticks and sandals depicting enemies, and a gold leaf picture of him during chariot archery against enemies, also suggest that he was actively engaged in Egypt&#x27;s international conflict. Egyptologist Bob Brier has argued leaning towards Tutankhamun being an actively participating warrior in his later years.

On the other hand, given Tutankhamun&#x27;s youth and hypothesized physical disabilities, like a speculated cane handicap, some historians are skeptical that he participated in these battles. Yet some experts, such as Sofia Aziz and other researchers have taken the position that the speculations of Tutankhamun&#x27;s physical frailty are overestimated, arguing that mummy damage has led to misdiagnosis. Instead, they argue that the more rigorous, scientific view is that he was physically active, and perhaps militarily participatory. Egyptologist Charlotte Booth states that Tutankhamun participated in at least two battles (one Nubian battle, and one Asiatic battle), nevertheless noting that other researchers suggest that he may have only accompanied the army to the battlefield for moral support, as opposed to actively participating.

==Personal life==
===Health===
Details about Tutankhamun&#x27;s health and early death are heavily debated. The most recent study suggests Tutankhamun had bone necrosis and a possible clubfoot, which may have rendered him dependent on assistive canes. This theory is disputed, as neither the canes nor his sandals show the kinds of the wear expected. He also had other health issues, including scoliosis, and had contracted several strains of malaria. He likely died of complications from a broken leg, possibly compounded by malaria.

Tutankhamun was slight of build, and roughly tall. CT investigations of Tutankhamun&#x27;s skull revealed an excellent condition of his dentition. He had large front incisors and an overbite characteristic of the Thutmosid royal line to which he belonged. Analysis of the clothing found in his tomb, particularly the dimensions of his loincloths and belts indicates that he had a narrow waist and rounded hips. In attempts to explain both his unusual depiction in art and his early death it has been theorised that Tutankhamun had gynecomastia, Marfan syndrome, Wilson–Turner X-linked intellectual disability syndrome, Fröhlich syndrome (adiposogenital dystrophy), Klinefelter syndrome, androgen insensitivity syndrome, aromatase excess syndrome in conjunction with sagittal craniosynostosis syndrome, Antley–Bixler syndrome or one of its variants. It has also been suggested that he had inherited temporal lobe epilepsy in a bid to explain the religiosity of his great-grandfather Thutmose IV and father Akhenaten and their early deaths. However, caution has been urged in this diagnosis.

In January 2005 Tutankhamun&#x27;s mummy was CT scanned. The results showed that the young king had a partially cleft hard palate and possibly a mild case of scoliosis. Additionally, he was diagnosed with a flat right foot with hypophalangism, while his left foot was clubbed and had bone necrosis of the second and third metatarsals (Freiberg disease or Köhler disease II). However, the clubfoot diagnosis is disputed. James Gamble instead suggests that the position is a result of Tutankhamun habitually walking on the outside of his foot due to the pain caused by Köhler disease II; this theory has been refuted by members of Hawass&#x27; team. The condition may have forced Tutankhamun to walk with the use of a cane, many of which were found in his tomb. However, none of them show the wear expected of essential aids; the wear on his sandals, where present, is also even on both feet. The presence of such a number of sticks is not unexpected, as canes were a symbol of status in ancient Egypt. Genetic testing through STR analysis rejected the hypothesis of gynecomastia and craniosynostoses (e.g., Antley–Bixler syndrome) or Marfan syndrome. Genetic testing for STEVOR, AMA1, or MSP1 genes specific for &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; revealed indications of malaria tropica in four mummies, including Tutankhamun&#x27;s. This is currently the oldest known genetic proof of the ailment. The team discovered DNA from several strains of the parasite, indicating that he was repeatedly infected with the most severe strain of malaria. His malaria infections may have caused a fatal immune response in the body or triggered circulatory shock. The CT scan also showed that he had experienced a compound left leg fracture. This injury being the result of modern damage was ruled out based on the ragged edges of the fracture; modern damage features sharp edges. Embalming substances were present within the fracture indicating that it was associated with an open wound; no signs of healing were present.

===Facial reconstruction===

A facial reconstruction of Tutankhamun was carried out in 2005 by the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities and &quot;National Geographic&quot;. Three separate teams—Egyptian, French, and American—worked separately to approximate the face of the boy king. While the Egyptian and French teams knew their subject was Tutankhamun, the American team worked blind. All teams produced very similar results, but it was that of the French team that was ultimately cast in silicone.

====Criticism====

Stuart Tyson Smith, Egyptologist and professor of anthropology at University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2008 expressed criticism of the forensic reconstruction in a journal review. He noted that &quot;Tutankhamun&#x27;s face&quot; was depicted as &quot;very light-skinned,&quot; reflecting a &quot;bias&quot; among media outlets. Smith further added that &quot;Egyptologists have been strangely reluctant to admit that the ancient Egyptians were rather dark-skinned Africans, especially the farther south one goes&quot;.

==Death==
There are no surviving records of the circumstances of Tutankhamun&#x27;s death; it has been the subject of considerable debate and major studies.
Hawass and his team postulate that his death was likely the result of the combination of his multiple weakening disorders, a leg fracture, perhaps as the result of a fall, and a severe malarial infection. However, Timmann and Meyer have argued that sickle cell anemia better fits the pathologies exhibited by the king, a suggestion the Egyptian team has called &quot;interesting and plausible&quot;.

Murder by a blow to the head was theorised as a result of the 1968 which showed two bone fragments inside the skull. This theory was disproved by further analysis of the and the CT scan. The inter-cranial bone fragments were determined to be the result of the modern unwrapping of the mummy as they are loose and not adherent to the embalming resin. No evidence of bone thinning or calcified membranes, which could be indicative of a fatal blow to the head, were found. It has also been suggested that the young king was killed in a chariot accident due to a pattern of crushing injuries, including the fact that the front part of his chest wall and ribs are missing. However, the missing ribs are unlikely to be a result of an injury sustained at the time of death; photographs taken at the conclusion of Carter&#x27;s excavation in 1926 show that the chest wall of the king was intact, still wearing a beaded collar with falcon-headed terminals. The absence of both the collar and chest wall was noted in the 1968 and further confirmed by the CT scan. It is likely that the front part of his chest was removed by robbers during the theft of the beaded collar; the intricate beaded skullcap the king was pictured wearing in 1926 was also missing by 1968.

==Succession==
Since the two children of Tutankhamun were either stillborn or did not survive long after birth, and Tutankhamun was presumably the last of the royal male siblings, there was no immediate heir apparent to assume the throne. Records in Horemheb&#x27;s tomb state that Tutankhamun appointed him &quot;lord of the land&quot; as Iry-pat (heir designate), which is essentially the designated hereditary prince to maintain law. However, some have argued that queen Ankhesenamun may have been able to transfer kinship to a husband, but would have preferred to not marry someone of lesser status than royal queen status. Horemheb was a militaryman of peasant birth and was, as the military commander-in-chief, technically a servant of queen Ankhesenamun. The vizier Ay, while of some royal blood, was an established vizier, and also technically a servant of queen Ankhesenamun. Ankhesenamun&#x27;s assumed spousal preferences may have ignited a series of disruptions in the fulfillment of what some have argued may have been king Tutankhamun&#x27;s preference on throne heirship.

=== Reign of vizier Ay ===

Seeking to resolve her spousal dilemma, Ankhesenamun may have inadvertently generated a predicament involving the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I and his son, prince Zannanza, known as the Zannanza affair, although Ankhesenamun&#x27;s identification as the Egyptian queen in question is not definite. Meanwhile, Tutankhamun&#x27;s vizier may have maneuvered in the midst of Tutankhamun&#x27;s death to intercept the throne, circumventing Horemheb&#x27;s heirship, possibly marrying Ankhesenamun towards the onset of this Hittite-Egyptian negotiation period, unbeknownst to Hittites. The fact that Ay is depicted presiding over Tutankhamun&#x27;s funeral, which is customary for the successor pharaoh, and the fact that Horemheb appears to have been absent at Tutankhamun&#x27;s funeral aligns with this.

The pharaoh Ay&#x27;s reign was short and his death again appears to have left a vacancy in the throne with no royal bloodline heir because Ay is presumed to have not had children with queen Ankhesenamun. Toward the end of Ay&#x27;s reign, Ay named his son, military generalissimo Nakhtmin, to be successor to the throne. However, Nakhtmin died before he could become pharaoh.

=== Horemheb Iry-pat fulfillment ===
Horemheb succeeded the throne as pharaoh after Ay&#x27;s death. As pharaoh, Horemheb saw to it that the restoration of the traditional ancient Egyptian religion that Tutankhamun was previously spearheading was completed, restabilizing the nation. Notably, during the standard damnatio memoriae process that each new Egyptian pharaoh undertakes, Horemheb defaced Ay&#x27;s tomb, but left Tutankhamun&#x27;s untouched, presumably out of respect.

In due course, Horemheb had selected then civilian military officer, Ramesses I, as heir to the throne. Ramesses I&#x27;s grandson, Ramesses II, would go on to found the Ramesside dynasty and become the greatest pharaoh of ancient Egypt. This initiated a new royal bloodline, replacing the royal bloodline that ended with the death of Tutankhamun.

==Tomb==
Tutankhamun was buried in a tomb that was unusually small considering his status. His death may have occurred unexpectedly, before the completion of a grander royal tomb, causing his mummy to be buried in a tomb intended for someone else. This would preserve the observance of the customary 70 days between death and burial. His tomb was robbed at least twice in antiquity, but based on the items taken (including perishable oils and perfumes) and the evidence of restoration of the tomb after the intrusions, these robberies likely took place within several months at most of the initial burial. The location of the tomb was lost because it had come to be buried by debris from subsequent tombs, and workers&#x27; houses were built over the tomb entrance.

===Rediscovery===
The concession rights for excavating the Valley of the Kings was held by Theodore Davis from 1905 until 1914. In that time, he had unearthed ten tombs including the nearly intact but non-royal tomb of Queen Tiye&#x27;s parents, Yuya and Thuya. As he continued working there in the later years, he uncovered nothing of major significance. Davis did find several objects in KV58 referring to Tutankhamun, which included knobs and handles bearing his name most significantly the embalming cache of the king (KV54). He believed this to be the pharaoh&#x27;s lost tomb and published his findings as such with the line; &quot;I fear the Valley of the Tombs is exhausted&quot;. In 1907, Howard Carter was invited by William Garstin and Gaston Maspero to excavate for George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon in the Valley. The Earl of Carnarvon and Carter had hoped this would lead to their gaining the concession when Davis gave it up but had to be satisfied with excavations in different parts of the Theban Necropolis for seven more years.

After a systematic search beginning in 1915, Carter discovered the actual tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62) in November 1922. An ancient stroke of luck allowed the tomb to survive to modern times. The tomb&#x27;s entrance was buried by mounds of debris from the cutting of KV9 over 150 years after Tutankhamun&#x27;s burial; ancient workmen&#x27;s huts were also built on the site. This area remained unexcavated until 1922 due to its proximity to KV9, as excavations would impede tourist access to that tomb. Carter commenced excavations in early November 1922, before the height of the tourist season. The first step of the tomb&#x27;s entrance staircase was uncovered on 4 November 1922. According to Carter&#x27;s account the workmen discovered the step while digging beneath the remains of the huts; other accounts attribute the discovery to a boy digging outside the assigned work area.

By February 1923 the antechamber had been cleared of everything but two sentinel statues. A day and time were selected to unseal the tomb with about twenty appointed witnesses that included Lord Carnarvon, several Egyptian officials, museum representatives and the staff of the Government Press Bureau. On 17 February 1923 at just after two o&#x27;clock, the seal was broken.

Letters published in 2022 of correspondence between Rex Engelbach and Alan Gardiner, reveal that Howard Carter had stolen objects from the tomb, such as a &#x27;whm amulet&#x27;, before the tomb was officially opened. Rex Engelbach said in a letter to Gardiner about a &#x27;whm amulet&#x27; gifted to Gardiner from Carter that &quot;The whm amulet you showed me has been undoubtedly stolen from the tomb of Tutankhamun.&quot;

===Contents===
Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb is the only royal tomb in the Valley of the Kings found in near-intact condition. There were 5,398 items found in the tomb, including a solid gold coffin, face mask, thrones, archery bows, trumpets, a lotus chalice, two Imiut fetishes, gold toe stalls, furniture, food, wine, sandals, and fresh linen underwear. Howard Carter took 10 years to catalog the items. Recent analysis suggests a dagger recovered from the tomb had an iron blade made from a meteorite; study of artifacts of the time including other artifacts from Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb could provide valuable insights into metalworking technologies around the Mediterranean at the time. Complete study of the iron artefacts from the tomb (besides the blade of a richly decorated golden dagger, small iron chisel blades set into wooden handles, an Eye of Horus amulet, and a miniature headrest) demonstrated that all were made of similar material. Only in 2022, a complex technological and material study of the Tutankhamun&#x27;s mask was published. Many of Tutankhamun&#x27;s burial goods show signs of being adapted for his use after being originally made for earlier owners, probably Smenkhkare or Neferneferuaten or both.

On 4 November 2007, 85 years to the day after Carter&#x27;s discovery, Tutankhamun&#x27;s mummy was placed on display in his underground tomb at Luxor, when the linen-wrapped mummy was removed from its golden sarcophagus to a climate-controlled glass box. The case was designed to prevent the heightened rate of decomposition caused by the humidity and warmth from tourists visiting the tomb. In 2009, the tomb was closed for restoration by the Ministry of Antiquities and the Getty Conservation Institute. While the closure was originally planned for five years to restore the walls affected by humidity, the Egyptian revolution of 2011 set the project back. The tomb re-opened in February 2019.

===Rumored curse===

For many years, rumors of a &quot;curse of the pharaohs&quot; (probably fueled by newspapers seeking sales at the time of the discovery) persisted, emphasizing the early death of some of those who had entered the tomb. The most prominent was George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, who died on 5 April 1923, five months after the discovery of the first step leading down to the tomb on 4 November 1922.

The cause of Carnarvon&#x27;s death was pneumonia supervening on [facial] erysipelas (a streptococcal infection of the skin and underlying soft tissue). The Earl had been in an automobile accident in 1901 making him very unhealthy and frail. His doctor recommended a warmer climate so in 1903 the Carnarvons traveled to Egypt where the Earl became interested in Egyptology. Along with the stresses of the excavation, Carnarvon was already in a weakened state when an infection led to pneumonia.

A study showed that of the 58 people who were present when the tomb and sarcophagus were opened, only eight died within a dozen years; Howard Carter died of lymphoma in 1939 at the age of 64. The last survivors included Lady Evelyn Herbert, Lord Carnarvon&#x27;s daughter who was among the first people to enter the tomb after its discovery in November 1922, who lived for a further 57 years and died in 1980, and American archaeologist J.O. Kinnaman who died in 1961, 39 years after the event.

==Legacy==

Tutankhamun&#x27;s fame is primarily the result of his well-preserved tomb and the global exhibitions of his associated artifacts. As Jon Manchip White writes, in his foreword to the 1977 edition of Carter&#x27;s &quot;The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamun&quot;, &quot;The pharaoh who in life was one of the least esteemed of Egypt&#x27;s Pharaohs has become in death the most renowned&quot;.

The discoveries in the tomb were prominent news in the 1920s. Tutankhamen came to be called by a modern neologism, &quot;King Tut&quot;. Ancient Egyptian references became common in popular culture, including Tin Pan Alley songs; the most popular of the latter was &quot;Old King Tut&quot; by Harry Von Tilzer from 1923, which was recorded by such prominent artists of the time as Jones &amp; Hare and Sophie Tucker. &quot;King Tut&quot; became the name of products, businesses, and the pet dog of U.S. President Herbert Hoover. While The Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibit was touring the United States in 1978, comedian Steve Martin wrote a novelty song &quot;King Tut&quot;. Originally performed on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, the song was released as a single and sold over a million copies. In 2023, an extinct whale discovered in the Eocene deposits of Egypt was named &quot;Tutcetus&quot;, after Tutankhamun, due to the small size and immature age of the type specimen.

===International exhibitions===
Tutankhamun&#x27;s artifacts have traveled the world with unprecedented visitorship. The exhibitions began in 1962 when Algeria won its independence from France. With the ending of that conflict, the Louvre Museum in Paris was quickly able to arrange an exhibition of Tutankhamun&#x27;s treasures through Christiane Desroches Noblecourt. The French Egyptologist was already in Egypt as part of a UNESCO appointment. The French exhibit drew 1.2 million visitors. Noblecourt had also convinced the Egyptian Minister of Culture to allow British photographer George Rainbird to re-photograph the collection in color. The new color photos as well as the Louvre exhibition began a Tutankhamun revival.

In 1965, the Tutankhamun exhibit traveled to Tokyo National Museum in Tokyo, Japan (21 August–10 October) where it garnered more visitors than the future New York exhibit in 1979. The exhibit next moved to the Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art in Kyoto (15 October–28 November) with almost 1.75 million visitors, and then to the Fukuoka Prefectural Cultural Hall in Fukuoka (3 December–26 December). The attraction exceeded all other exhibitions of Tutankhamun&#x27;s treasures for the next 60 years. &quot;The Treasures of Tutankhamun&quot; tour ran from 1972 to 1979. This exhibition was first shown in London at the British Museum from 30 March until 30 September 1972. More than 1.6 million visitors saw the exhibition. The exhibition moved on to many other countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Japan, France, Canada, and West Germany. The Metropolitan Museum of Art organized the U.S. exhibition, which ran from 17 November 1976 through 15 April 1979. More than eight million attended. The showing in the United States was part of a diplomatic effort begun by Henry Kissinger to further convince Americans of the value of Egypt as an ally. It traveled first to Washington D.C., then Chicago, New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Seattle, and finished in New York. 

In 2005, Egypt&#x27;s Supreme Council of Antiquities, in partnership with Arts and Exhibitions International and the National Geographic Society, launched a tour of Tutankhamun treasures and other 18th Dynasty funerary objects, this time called &quot;Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs&quot;. It featured the same exhibits as &quot;Tutankhamen: The Golden Hereafter&quot; in a slightly different format. It was expected to draw more than three million people but exceeded that with almost four million people attending just the first four tour stops. The exhibition started in Los Angeles, then moved to Fort Lauderdale, Chicago, Philadelphia and London before finally returning to Egypt in August 2008. An encore of the exhibition in the United States ran at the Dallas Museum of Art. After Dallas the exhibition moved to the de Young Museum in San Francisco, followed by the Discovery Times Square Exposition in New York City.
The exhibition visited Australia for the first time, opening at the Melbourne Museum for its only Australian stop before Egypt&#x27;s treasures returned to Cairo in December 2011.

The exhibition included 80 exhibits from the reigns of Tutankhamun&#x27;s immediate predecessors in the 18th Dynasty, such as Hatshepsut, whose trade policies greatly increased the wealth of that dynasty and enabled the lavish wealth of Tutankhamun&#x27;s burial artifacts, as well as 50 from Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb. The exhibition did not include the gold mask that was a feature of the 1972–1979 tour, as the Egyptian government has decided that damage which occurred to previous artifacts on tours precludes this one from joining them.

In 2018, it was announced that the largest collection of Tutankhamun artifacts, amounting to forty percent of the entire collection, would be leaving Egypt again in 2019 for an international tour entitled; &quot;King Tut: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh&quot;. The 2019–2022 tour began with an exhibit called; &quot;Tutankhamun, Pharaoh&#x27;s Treasures,&quot; which launched in Los Angeles and then traveled to Paris. The exhibit featured at the Grande Halle de la Villette in Paris ran from March to September 2019. The exhibit featured one hundred and fifty gold coins, along with various pieces of jewelry, sculpture and carvings, as well as the gold mask of Tutankhamun. Promotion of the exhibit filled the streets of Paris with posters of the event. The exhibit moved to London in November 2019 and was scheduled to travel to Boston and Sydney when the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted the tour. On 28 August 2020 the artifacts that made up the temporary exhibition returned to the Egyptian Museum, Cairo, and other institutions. The treasures will be permanently housed in the new Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo, expected to open between October 2023 and February 2024.

<doc id="30439" wikidata="Q128135" url="?curid=30439" title="Totalitarianism">
<text>Totalitarianism is a political system and a form of government that prohibits opposition from political parties, disregards and outlaws the political claims of individual and group opposition to the state, and completely controls the public sphere and the private sphere of society. In the field of political science, totalitarianism is the extreme form of authoritarianism, wherein all socio-political power is held by a dictator. This figure controls the national politics and peoples of the nation with continual propaganda campaigns that are broadcast by state-controlled and state-aligned private mass communications media.

The totalitarian government uses ideology to control most aspects of human life, such as the political economy of the country, the system of education, the arts, sciences, and private morality of its citizens. In the exercise of socio-political power, the difference between a totalitarian regime of government and an authoritarian regime of government is one of degree; whereas totalitarianism features a charismatic dictator and a fixed worldview, authoritarianism only features a dictator who holds power for the sake of holding power. The authoritarian dictator is supported, either jointly or individually, by a military junta and by the socio-economic elites who are the ruling class of the country.

The term &quot;totalitarianism&quot; emerged in politics of the interwar period; in the early years of the Cold War, it arose from comparison of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin and Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler as a theoretical concept of Western political science, achieving hegemony in explaining the nature of Fascist and Communist states, and later entered the Western historiography of Communism, the Soviet Union and the Russian Revolution; in the 21st century, it became applied to Islamist movements and their governments. The concept of totalitarianism has been challenged and criticized by some historians of Nazi Germany and Stalinist USSR. When defined as exemplary cases of totalitarianism, on the grounds that the main characteristics of the concept – total control over society, total mobilization of the masses, and a monolithic centralized character of the regime – were never achieved by the dictatorships called totalitarian. To support this claim, the historians argue that the political structures of these states were disorganized and chaotic, and that despite the supposed external similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, their internal logic and structure were substantially different. The applicability of the concept to Islamism has also been criticized.

The concept of totalitarianism has also been applied to historical states that existed prior to the 20th century or even belonged to the period of Ancient history, such as the Mauryan dynasty of India, the Qin dynasty of China, and others.

===Contemporary background===
Modern political science catalogues three régimes of government: (i) the democratic, (ii) the authoritarian, and (iii) the totalitarian. Varying by political culture, the functional characteristics of the totalitarian régime of government are: political repression of all opposition (individual and collective); a cult of personality about The Leader; official economic interventionism (controlled wages and prices); official censorship of all mass communication media (the press, textbooks, cinema, television, radio, internet); official mass surveillance-policing of public places; and state terrorism. In the essay &quot;Democide in Totalitarian States: Mortacracies and Megamurderers&quot; (1994) the American political scientist Rudolph Rummel said that:

There is much confusion about what is meant by &quot;totalitarian&quot; in the literature, including the denial that such [political] systems even exist. I define a &quot;totalitarian state&quot; as one with a system of government that is unlimited, [either] constitutionally or by countervailing powers in society (such as by a Church, rural gentry, labor unions, or regional powers); is not held responsible to the public by periodic secret and competitive elections; and employs its unlimited power to control all aspects of society, including the family, religion, education, business, private property, and social relationships. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union was thus totalitarian, as was Mao Zedong&#x27;s China, Pol Pot&#x27;s Cambodia, Hitler&#x27;s Germany, and U Ne Win&#x27;s Burma.&lt;br&gt;

Totalitarianism is, then, a political ideology for which a totalitarian government is the agency for realizing its ends. Thus, totalitarianism characterizes such ideologies as state socialism (as in Burma), Marxism–Leninism as in former East Germany, and Nazism. Even revolutionary Muslim Iran, since the overthrow of the Shah in 1978–79 has been totalitarian—here totalitarianism was married to Muslim fundamentalism. In short, totalitarianism is the ideology of absolute power. State socialism, Communism, Nazism, fascism, and Muslim fundamentalism have been some of its recent raiments. Totalitarian governments have been its agency. The state, with its international legal sovereignty and independence, has been its base. As will be pointed out, &quot;mortacracy&quot; is the result.

;Degree of control
In exercising the power of government upon a society, the application of an official dominant ideology differentiates the worldview of the totalitarian régime from the worldview of the authoritarian régime, which is &quot;only concerned with political power, and, as long as [government power] is not contested, [the authoritarian government] gives society a certain degree of liberty.&quot; Having no ideology to propagate, the politically secular authoritarian government &quot;does not attempt to change the world and human nature&quot;, whereas the &quot;totalitarian government seeks to completely control the thoughts and actions of its citizens&quot;, by way of an official &quot;totalist ideology, a [political] party reinforced by a secret police, and monopolistic control of industrial mass society.&quot;

===Historical background===
From the right-wing perspective, the social phenomenon of political totalitarianism is a product of Modernism, which the philosopher Karl Popper said originated in humanist philosophy; in the &quot;Republic&quot; (&quot;res publica&quot;) proposed by Plato in Ancient Greece, in Hegel&#x27;s conception of the State as a polity of peoples, and in the political economy of Karl Marx in the 19th century—yet historians and philosophers of those periods dispute the historiographic accuracy of Popper&#x27;s 20th-century interpretation and delineation of the historical origins of totalitarianism, because, for example, the ancient Greek philosopher Plato did not invent the modern State; his approach has been described as a radical denial of historical causation and as an ahistorical attempt to present totalitarianism and liberalism not as products of historical development, but as eternal and timeless categories of humankind itself. There were similar &quot;ideocratic&quot; attempts in traditions of the Counter-Enlightenment to trace totalitarianism back to the times preceding the 20th century: Eric Voegelin saw totalitarianism as &quot;the journey&#x27;s end of the Gnostic search for a civil theology&quot;, an epilogue of the process of secularization which began with the Reformation which led to a world deprived of any religiosity; Jacob Talmon thought totalitarianism to be a merger of left-wing radical democracy (from Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Maximilien Robespierre and François-Noël Babeuf) and right-wing irrationalism (from Johann Gottlieb Fichte) as traditions opposed to empirical liberalism; the German philosophers Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno viewed totalitarianism as an ineluctable destiny of modernity rooted in the origins of the Western civilization and as an ultimate end of the evolution of the Enlightenment from emancipatory reason to instrumental rationality, and as a product of anthropocentrist proposition that: &quot;Man has become the master of the world, a master unbound by any links to Nature, society, and history&quot;, which excludes the intervention of supernatural beings to earthly politics of government.

Enzo Traverso believes that the idea of &quot;total state&quot;, or &quot;totalitarian state&quot; as it would be called later, came from the concept of &quot;total war&quot; which was used to describe World War I by its contemporaries: the war &quot;shaped the imagination of an entire generation&quot; by rationalizing nihilism and &quot;methodical destruction of the enemy&quot;, introducing &quot;a new warrior ethos in which the old ideals of heroism and chivalry merged with modern technology&quot; and a process of brutalization of politics and such examples of &quot;continentally planned industrial killing&quot; as the Armenian genocide. &quot;Total war&quot; became &quot;total state&quot;, and after the war, it was used as a pejorative by the Italian anti-fascists of the 1920s and later by the Italian Fascists themselves.

American historian William Rubinstein wrote that:The &#x27;Age of Totalitarianism&#x27; included nearly all the infamous examples of genocide in modern history, headed by the Jewish Holocaust, but also comprising the mass murders and purges of the Communist world, other mass killings carried out by Nazi Germany and its allies, and also the Armenian genocide of 1915. All these slaughters, it is argued here, had a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern Europe as a result of World War I, without which surely neither Communism nor Fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots.

In the 20th century, Giovanni Gentile classified Italian Fascism as a political ideology with a philosophy that is &quot;totalitarian, and [that] the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unity inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people&quot;; Gentile expessed his ideas in &quot;The Doctrine of Fascism&quot; (1932), an essay he co-authored with Benito Mussolini. In 1920s Germany, during the Weimar Republic (1918–1933), the Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt integrated Gentile&#x27;s Fascist philosophy of united national purpose to the supreme-leader ideology of the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot;.

Since the Cold War, the so-called &#x27;traditionalist&#x27;, or &#x27;totalitarian&#x27;, historians, (see below) claimed that Vladimir Lenin, one of the leaders of the 1917 October Revolution in Russia, was the first politician to establish a totalitarian state; such description of Lenin is opposed by the so-called &#x27;revisionist&#x27; historians of Communism and the Soviet Union as well as by a broad range of authors including Hannah Arendt. As the &quot;Duce&quot; leading the Italian people to the future, Benito Mussolini said that his dictatorial régime of government made Fascist Italy (1922–1943) the representative &quot;Totalitarian State&quot;: &quot;Everything in the State, nothing outside the State, nothing against the State.&quot; Likewise, in &quot;The Concept of the Political&quot; (1927), the Nazi jurist Schmitt used the term &quot;der Totalstaat&quot; (the Total State) to identify, describe, and establish the legitimacy of a German totalitarian state led by a supreme leader; later Joseph Goebbels would call a totalitarian state the goal of the Nazi Party, although the concept became downplayed in Nazi discourse.

After the Second World War (1937–1945), U.S. political discourse (domestic and foreign) included the concepts (ideologic and political) and the terms &quot;totalitarian&quot;, &quot;totalitarianism&quot;, and &quot;totalitarian model&quot;. In the post-war U.S. of the 1950s, to politically discredit the anti-fascism of the Second World War as misguided foreign policy and at the same time direct anti-fascists against Communism, McCarthyite politicians claimed that Left-wing totalitarianism was an existential threat to Western civilisation, and so facilitated the creation of the American national security state to execute the anti-communist Cold War (1945–1989) that was fought by client-state proxies of the US and the USSR.

While the concept of totalitarianism became dominant in Anglo-American political discorse after World War II, it remained neglected in continental Europe except for West Germany: in such countries as Italy and France, where the communist parties played a hegemonic role in the anti-Fascist resistance, the pioneering works of the theory of totalitarianism by such authors as Hannah Arendt, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Carl Friedrich were often ignored or not even translated; the political theory of totalitarianism in these countries was promoted by Congress for Cultural Freedom supported by the CIA.

==Historiography==
=== &quot;Totalitarians&quot; and &quot;Revisionists&quot; ===
The Western historiography of the USSR and of the Soviet period of Russian history and is in two schools of research and interpretation: (i) the traditionalist school of historiography and (ii) the revisionist school of historiography; the traditionalists and neo-traditionalists, or anti-revisionists, are also known as &#x27;totalitarian school&#x27; or &#x27;totalitarian approach&#x27; and &#x27;Cold War&#x27; historians, for relying on concepts and interpretations rooted in the early years of the Cold War and even in the sphere Russian White émigrés of the 1920s.

Traditionalist-school historians characterise themselves as objective reporters of the claimed totalitarianism allegedly inherent to Marxism, to Communism, and to the political nature of Communist states, such as the USSR, while the Cold War revisionists criticized the politically liberal and anti-communist bias they perceived in the predominance of the traditionalists and describe their approach as emotional and oversimplifying. Revisionist-school historians criticise the traditionalist school&#x27;s concentration upon the police-state aspects of Cold War history which leads it to anti-communist interpretation of history biased towards a right-wing interpretation of the documentary facts. The revisionists also oppose the equation of Nazism and Communism and Stalinism and stress such their ideological differences as the humanist and egalitarian origins of Communist ideology. In the 1960s, revisionists studying the Cold War and the Communist movement in the U.S. criticized the dominant ideas that American Communists were an actual threat to the United States and that the Cold War was the fault of Stalin&#x27;s territorial and political ambitions and that Soviet expansionsim and its alleged strife to conquer the world forced the U.S. to turn from isolationism to a global containment policy.

The difference between these two historiographic directions is not only political, but also as methodological: the &#x27;traditionalists&#x27; focus on politics, ideology and personalities of the Bolshevik and Communist leaders, putting the latter in the centre of history while largely ignoring social processes, and traditionalists present &quot;history from above&quot;, directed by the leaders, while the revisionists put emphasis on &quot;history from below&quot; and social history of the Soviet regime, and they describe the traditionalists as &#x27;(right-wing) romantics.&#x27; In their turn, the traditionalists defend their approach and methodology, dismiss focus on social history and accuse their opponents of Marxism and of rationalizing the actions of the Bolsheviks and failing to recognize the primary role of &quot;one man&quot; leading a movement (Vladimir Lenin or Adolf Hitler). Between the late 1970s and early 1980s, revisionist approaches became largely accepted in academic circles, and the term &quot;revisionism&quot; migrated to characterize a group of social historians focusing on the working class and the upheavals of the Stalin years. At the same time, traditionalist historians retained popularity and influence outside academic circles, especially in politics and public spheres of the United States, where they supported harder policies towards the USSR: for example, Zbigniew Brzezinski served as National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter, while Richard Pipes, a prominent historian of &#x27;totalitarian school&#x27;, headed the CIA group Team B; after 1991, their views have found popularity not only in the West, but also in the former USSR.
=== Leninism and the October Revolution ===

Since the 1980s, there has been a debate over the nature of the October Revolution between the traditionalists and the revisionists as well as a debate about the nature of the government of Vladimir Lenin. Traditionalist scholars believe that the government of Vladimir Lenin was a totalitarian dictatorship but revisionist scholars do not; the core argument of the traditionalists was based on their belief that the Revolution was a violent act which was carried out &quot;from above&quot; by a small group of intellectuals with brute force. Such traditionalist historians as Richard Pipes claimed that Soviet Russia of 1917–1924 was as totalitarian as the Soviet Union under Stalin was, and they also claim that Stalinist totalitarianism was a mere continuation of Lenin&#x27;s policies because Stalinism was prefigured by Lenin&#x27;s ideology, thar Lenin was the &quot;inventor&quot; (Riley) of totalitarianism, and that further totalitarian regimes just implemented the policies already invented: for example, Pipes compared Lenin to Hitler and stated that &quot;The Stalinist and Nazi holocausts&quot; stemmed from Lenin&#x27;s Red Terror and had &quot;much greater decorum&quot; than the latter. The revisionists, on the contrary, stressed the genuinely &#x27;popular&#x27; nature of the 1917 Revolution, and tended to see a discontinuity between Leninism and Stalinism; a revisionist historian Ronald Suny cites Hannah Arendt who distinguished Lenin&#x27;s terror of the Russian Civil War, &quot;a means to exterminate and frighten opponents&quot;, from totalitarian terror aimed not at specific enemies but at fulfilling ideological goals, solving the problem of inequality and poverty, &quot;an instrument to rule masses who are perfectly obedient.&quot; It was also noted that Stalin became an uncontested dictator after a period of &quot;authoritarian pluralism&quot;, while the one-party dictatorship and mass violence (the Red Terror) were interpreted not as a result not of Lenin&#x27;s totalitarian &quot;blueprint&quot;, but rather of reactions (yet justified by the ideology) to current events and external factors, including wartime conditions and the struggle for survival, some historians highlighted the initial attempts of the Bolsheviks to form a coalition government.

Martin Malia noted that the debates on history were politically significant: if the &#x27;traditionalists&#x27; were right, &quot;Communism&quot; &quot;must be abolished&quot;, but if they were not, it could be reformed. Understanding of relationship of Lenin and Stalin as a continuity of the totalitarian regime was consensual for a major period; the first revisionists of the 1960s, social historians, also believed it to be a continuity, but as a continuity of policies of modernisation, not as a continuity of totalitarianism; starting from the end of the 1960s, availability of new Soviet materials allowed to dispute the continuity for such historians as Moshe Lewin and break the consensus. According to Evan Mawdsley, &quot;the &#x27;revisionist’ school had been dominant from the 1970s&quot;, and achieved &quot;some success&quot; in challenging the traditionalists.

=== Revisionists on Stalinism ===

The death of Stalin in 1953 voided the simplistic &quot;totalitarian model&quot; of the police-state USSR as the epitome of &quot;the totalitarian state&quot;. Starting from the 1970s, the &#x27;revisionist&#x27; historians, described as those who &quot;insisted that the old image of the Soviet Union as a totalitarian state bent on world domination was oversimplified or just plain wrong&quot; and focused not on typology of power, but social history, such as Sheila Fitzpatrick began challenging the totalitarian paradigm; without denying the state violence by the regime, these scholars argued that the Stalinist system could not and did not rule only through coercion and terror, and pointed to support within the population for many of Stalin&#x27;s policies and argued that the party and state were often responsive to people&#x27;s desires and values. More to it, they examined the substantial differences of Stalinist and Nazi violence that inevitably put into question the attempt to gather Stalin&#x27;s and Hitler&#x27;s regimes into a single category which was presented by the concept of totalitarianism. In 1999 the sociologists Randall Collins and David Waller grouped the concept of totalitarianism among the &quot;theories that were completely wrong&quot;; in &quot;Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared&quot; (2008), Fitzpatrick and Michael Geyer critically examined the concept of totalitarianism and made a very detailed comparison of similarities and substantial differences between Hitler and Stalin and made conclusion in agreement with the point of Collins and Waller.

Some historians who did not align themselves with the &#x27;revisionist school&#x27; later openly stated that Stalinist system cannot be regarded as totalitarian. For example, the historian Robert Service in his biography of Stalin wrote that &quot;this was not a totalitarian dictatorship as conventionally defined because Stalin lacked the capacity, even at the height of his power, to secure automatic universal compliance with his wishes.&quot; Eric Hobsbawm wrote that although Stalin indeed wanted to achieve total control of the population, he did not establish an actual totalitarian system, what, as he said, &quot;throws considerable doubt on the usefulness of the term.&quot;

According to Fitzpatrick, &quot;totalitarian-model scholarship&quot; - the USSR as a &quot;top-down entity,&quot; a monolithic party grounded on ideology and ruling by terror over a passive society - &quot;was in effect a mirror image of the Soviet self-representation, but with the moral signs reversed (instead of the party being always right, it was always wrong).&quot; A fact common to the revisionist-school interpretations of the reign of Stalin (1927–1953) was that the USSR was a country with weak social institutions, and that state terrorism against Soviet citizens indicated the political illegitimacy of Stalin&#x27;s government: to critics of totalitarian model state terror was a mark of a weak regime, and J. Arch Getty wrote of a &quot;technically weak and politically divided party whose organisational relationships seem more primitive than totalitarian&quot;, commenting the Smolensk Archive, and so, the criticism of accepted model began with labelling Stalinism as &quot;inefficient totalitarianism&quot;, where the dictator had to rely on &quot;shock methods&quot; to counter the resistance of local autonomies and administrations and political factionalism within the apparatus (including its highest levels); the citizens of the USSR were not devoid of personal agency or of material resources for living, nor were Soviet citizens psychologically atomised by the totalist ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—because &quot;the Soviet political system was chaotic, that institutions often escaped the control of the centre, and that Stalin&#x27;s leadership consisted, to a considerable extent, in responding, on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis, to political crises as they arose&quot;, and many purges and forced collectivisations were local or even &quot;popular initiatives which Stalin and his henchmen&#x27; could not control&quot;, while the people collectively resisted by such methods as refusing to work efficiently and migrating by the millions. That the legitimacy of Stalin&#x27;s régime of government relied upon the popular support of the Soviet citizenry as much as Stalin relied upon state terrorism for their support. That by politically purging Soviet society of anti–Soviet people Stalin created employment and upward social mobility for the post–War generation of working class citizens for whom such socio-economic progress was unavailable before the Russian Revolution (1917–1924). That the people who benefited from Stalin&#x27;s social engineering became Stalinists loyal to the USSR; thus, the Revolution had fulfilled her promise to those Stalinist citizens and they supported Stalin because of the state terrorism. 

The revisionists also conducted new comparative studies of the Third Reich and the USSR, but stressed substantial differences between them. Thus, fascisms lasted much shorter, but experienced cumulative radicalization until their collapse, while Stalinism arose in stabilized and pacified country and fell apart due to an internal crisis after a post-totalitarian period; fascism maintained traditional elites, while Stalinism was a result of revolution and radical social transformation; their ideologies were antipodal; totalitarian model likened &quot;charismatic authorities&quot; of Stalin and Hitler and Mussolini, but they were different: Hitler and Mussolini were popular figures of &quot;providential men&quot; who needed an almost physical contact with the followers and exemplified the totalitarian &quot;New Man&quot; with their bodies and behaviour, while Stalin&#x27;s cult is described as &quot;afar&quot;, purely artificial and much more distant, and Stalin never merged with the people, always staying &quot;hidden from his followers&quot;. Mass state violence was also different: Soviet violence was primarily iternal, while the one of the Nazis primarily external; the former was an ineffective and irrational means of a rational goal, modernization, while Nazis sought extremely irrational goals with rational industrial means; the efficiency of Soviet forced labour camps (Gulags) was measured by the authorities by practical results, like building train tracks, which would eventually lay a basis of modernity, while Nazism mobilized industry for extermination, and the efficiency of extermination camps was measured by the number of deaths. Thus, the revisionists have argued, both regimes commited inhumane mass violence, but their iternal logic was fundamentally different.

In the case of East Germany, Eli Rubin posited that East Germany was not a totalitarian state but rather a society shaped by the confluence of unique economic and political circumstances interacting with the concerns of ordinary citizens.

=== Nazism and Fascism ===

Enzo Traverso and Andrew Vincent point out that the &quot;totalitarian approach&quot; or the theoretical concept of totalitarianism, which presented the idea of a monolithic party, no separation between state and society, and total mobilization of the atomized masses and total control over the state, society and economy, is not applicable not only to the USSR, but also to Nazi Germany and Fascist states as well, since it also did not present a monolithic structure excercising total control over society, but on the contrary, that Nazi bureaucracy was highly &quot;chaotic&quot;, anomic and disorganized and disunited, and that Adolf Hitler was a &quot;weak dictator&quot; and &quot;laissez-faire leader&quot;, as said by such historians as Hans Mommsen and Ian Kershaw; this description of Nazi Germany was first introduced in 1942 by Franz Leopold Neumann in the work &quot;&quot;, where he provocatively presented Hitlerism &quot;a Behemoth, a non-state, a chaos, a rule of lawlessness, disorder, and anarchy&quot;, and later entered historiography of Nazism. In the 1970s, the German historians of functionalist school presented Nazism as a &quot;polycratic&quot; system grounded on different centers of power — the Nazi party, the army, the economic elites, and the state bureaucracy; to such historians, totalitarian monolithic state and party were just a facade (similarly to Fitzpatrick&#x27;s assesment of Stalinism). Historians like Mommsen and Ian Kershaw were critical of concepts of totalitarianism and focused on lack of beureaucratic coherence in the Nazi system and on its immanent tendency towards self-destruction. Michael Mann wrote that these descriptions doubted theories of totalitarianism, since &quot;anything less like the rigid top-down bureaucracy of totalitarian theory is hard to imagine&quot;, but that Stalinism and Nazism &quot;belong together&quot;, and that &quot;it is only a question of finding the right family name&quot;. According to Mann, &quot;totalitarian theorists depicted an unreal level of coherence for any state. Modern states are a long way short of Hegelian or Weberian rational bureaucracy and they rarely act as singular, coherent actors. Normally regimes are factionalised; in an unpredictable world they stumble along with many foul-ups. Second, we should remember Weber&#x27;s essential point about bureaucracy: it kept politics out of administration. Political and moral values (&#x27;value rationality&#x27;) were settled outside of bureaucratic administration, which then limited itself to finding efficient means of implementing those values (&#x27;formal rationality&#x27;). Contrary to totalitarian theory, the twentieth-century states most capable of such formally rational bureaucracy were not the dictatorships but the democracies.&quot;

The concept of totaliarianism appeared in the debates among German historians and public intellectuals known as &quot;Historikerstreit&quot;, in which one of the parties defended the idea of exceptionalism of Nazism, while their conservative opponents believed that the Third Reich may be explained through comparison with the USSR; at the same time, such conservative historians as Karl-Dietrich Bracher and Klaus Hildebrand rejected the notion of Nazism as a branch of generic fascism, on the grounds that the uniqueness of Nazism lay in the person and ideology of Hitler and that Nazism was defined primarily by Hitler&#x27;s personality and personal beliefs rather than by any external factors.

Stanley Payne wrote that indeed, both Mussolini and Hitler failed to achieve full totalitarianism, and of Mussolini it was said that his regime was not totalitarian (exluding &quot;merely fascist&quot; Italy from totalitarian regimes, started by Hannah Arendt who also thought that Nazism became totalitarian only in 1938-1942, is a popular but contested position in contemporary historiography), so Payne concludes that &quot;only a socialist or Communist system can achieve full totalitarianism, since total control requires total institutional revolution that can only be effected by state socialism&quot; (according to Payne, both Lenin and Stalin were totalitarian). Payne writes that &quot;it is easy to argue either that many different kinds of regimes are totalitarian or conversely that none were perfectly total&quot;, yet, he writes that the concept &quot;totalitarianism is both valid and useful if defined in the precise and literal sense of a state system that attempts to exercise direct control over all significant aspects of all major national institutions.&quot;

=== Further debates ===
==== 1980s - 1990s ====

Writing in 1987, Walter Laqueur dismissed the arguments of revisionists as &quot;reappraisals of Stalin and Stalinism&quot; and compared them with German &#x27;revisionist&#x27; historians of Nazism, particularly Ernst Nolte, whom he did not distinguish from functionalist historians of Nazism (&quot;weak dictator&quot; thesis), and called their analysis &quot;Marxist&quot;, for which Stalin was &quot;not promising material&quot;. As Laqueur wrote, the historians who disagreed with the revisionists &quot;still ha[d] very strong feelings&quot; towards Stalinism and found concepts such as modernisation inadequate tools for explaining Soviet history, unlike the concept of totalitarianism; citing Mikhail Gorbachev using the term &quot;totalitarianism&quot;, Laqueur wrote that the efforts of the revisionists to abolish the totalitarian model &quot;ha[d] become difficult.&quot;

Laure Neumayer posited that &quot;despite the disputes over its heuristic value and its normative assumptions, the concept of totalitarianism made a vigorous return to the political and academic fields at the end of the Cold War&quot;. In 1978, the term was &#x27;revived&#x27; in Western Europe: such historians as François Furet produced &#x27;revisionist&#x27; critical re-evaluations of the French Revolution which, according to them, led to the emergence of totalitarianism, while in Italy, &quot;anti-anti-Fascist&quot; historians, notably Renzo De Felice and after him Emilio Gentile, challenged the &#x27;myth&#x27; produced by the hegemonic role of the Communists in the Italian resistance, stated that the choice between Fascism and Communism was equal for Italy, and implied that the latter could be even worse, what led to the resurgence of the concept of totalitarianism as a new dimension of studies of Fascism, while the ones who doubted their theories were &quot;swept away&quot; with the collapse of the Eastern Bloc between 1989 and 1991. The &#x27;revival&#x27; of the concept which started in the 1970s in Europe took some time to re-appear in English-language literature, as the &#x27;revisionists&#x27; achieved hegemony in the academy, while the &#x27;totalitarians&#x27; retained control over public discourse; the European debates were transfered to English-language historiography by Martin Malia. In 1995, Furet made a comparative analysis and used the term &quot;totalitarian twins&quot; to link Nazism and Stalinism. Pipes and Malia continued depicting ideological developments as the grounds of communism, and thus, totalitarianism, drawing a line from utopianism and the French Revolution, which Pipes compared to a &quot;virus&quot;, to Lenin, and in order to describe the nature of totalitarianism, they used the concept of ideocracy. Furet and Ernst Nolte, a historian praised by Furet, also identified anti-Fascism as Communist totalitarianism; Nolte presented a conflict between totalitarianisms as European Civil War, stating that it was began by Bolshevism and produced Nazism, an &quot;inverted Bolshevism&quot;, thus assessing the latter as only a response to the threat of Bolshevism and the Holocaust and Operation Barbarossa as &quot;both a retaliation and a preventive measure&quot; against Bolshevism. Another major work belonging to the same period was &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; (1997), the editor of which, Stephane Courtois, stressed structural homology of totalitarian systems embodied in identity of &quot;class genocide&quot; of Communism and &quot;race genocide&quot; of Nazism, and concluded that Communism was more murderous than Nazism or any other ideology from counting and summing the number of victims that can be attributed to &#x27;Communist states&#x27; and thus communism in general, what triggered an emotional debate in France on whether Communism should be treated as a single unified phenomena and whether &quot;a blanket condemnation&quot; of Communism as an ideology makes sense. While Nolte and the historians supporting him were not victorious in the &quot;Historikerstreit&quot;, but his influence on Furet and the historians outside Germany legitimized his ideas, and they returned to Germany in other forms, what thus led to the resurgence of the concept in Germany. The concept entered historiography in Eastern Europe, in former countries of the Eastern Bloc, describing not only Stalinism, but the whole Communist project in general along with the &quot;Double genocide theory&quot;, which summarized Nazi and Stalinist violence into a single metenarrative and became an influential framework of interpretation.

Furet&#x27;s totalitarian interpretation of the French Revolution, directed against the classic &quot;Marxist&quot; or &quot;Jacobin&quot; interpretation, triggered debates with such historians as Michel Vovelle, who led new studies on it; as Eric Hobsbawm concluded in 2007, &quot;the Furet Revolution&quot; was &quot;now over&quot;. In regards to Furet&#x27;s ideas on the 20th century, Hobsbawm wrote that &quot;[Nazism and Stalinism] were functionally and not ideologically derived [...] Furet, as a dinstinguished historian of ideas, knows that they belonged to different if structurally convergent taxanomic families&quot;; contrary to conception of anti-Fascism as a mask of Stalinism, Hobsbawm attributed the &quot;alliance&quot; between liberalism and communism, which had enabled capitalism to overcome its crisis, and wrote that Furet&#x27;s work &quot;reads like a belated product of the Cold War era&quot;. Historians Enzo Traverso and Arno J. Mayer and the author Domenico Losurdo accepted Nolte&#x27;s concept of the &quot;European Civil War&quot;, although set its beginning to 1914 and differently interpreted it, not in terms of struggle between two totalitarianisms.

Michael Parenti (1997) and James Petras (1999) have suggested that the totalitarianism concept has been politically employed and used for anti-communist purposes. Parenti has also analysed how &quot;left anti-communists&quot; attacked the Soviet Union during the Cold War. For Petras, the CIA funded the Congress for Cultural Freedom to attack &quot;Stalinist anti-totalitarianism.&quot;

According to some scholars and authors, such as Domenico Losurdo calling Joseph Stalin &quot;totalitarian&quot; instead of &quot;authoritarian&quot; has been asserted to be a high-sounding but specious excuse for Western self-interest, just as surely as the counterclaim that allegedly debunking the totalitarian concept may be a high-sounding but specious excuse for Russian self-interest. For Losurdo, totalitarianism is a polysemic concept with origins in Christian theology and applying it to the political sphere requires an operation of abstract schematism which makes use of isolated elements of historical reality to place fascist regimes and the Soviet Union in the dock together, serving the anti-communism of Cold War-era intellectuals rather than reflecting intellectual research.

====After the 1990s====
After 1990s, criticisms of totalitarianism as a historical concept and a tool of analysis continued; however, while these critics called for expulsion of the concept from academic field, they stated that its legitimate outside it. Hans Mommsen criticized it as &quot;a descriptive concept, not a theory&quot; with &quot;little or no explanatory power&quot;: &quot;But the basis of comparison is a shallow one, largely confined to the apparatus of rule.&quot; However, he wrote that &quot;the totalitarianism concept allows comparative analysis of a number of techniques and instruments of domination, and this, too, must be seen as legitimate in itself&quot;, and that it is legitimate in &quot;non-scholarly usage&quot;. Enzo Traverso in his essay &quot;Totalitarianism Between History and Theory&quot; (2017) dismisses the term as &quot;both useless and irreplacible&quot; for political science and academic history and cites Franz Leopold Neumann who called it a Weberian &quot;ideal type&quot;, an abstraction that does not exist in reality as opposed to concrete totality of history, and believes it to be a term of abuse in Western political science and propaganda, he writes about its legitimacy for storing traumatic collective experience of the 20th century state violence:
Thus, if the concept of totalitarianism continue to be criticized for its ambiguities, weaknesses, and abuses, it probably will not be abandoned. Beyond being a Western banner, it stores the memory a century that experienced Auschwitz and Kolyma, the death camps of Nazism, the Stalinist Gulags, and Pol Pot&#x27;s killing fields. There lies its legitimacy, which does not need any academic recognition.

In the essay, &quot;Totalitarianism: Defunct Theory, Useful Word&quot; (2010), the historian John Connelly said that &quot;totalitarianism&quot; is a useful word, but that the old 1950s &quot;theory&quot; about totalitarianism is defunct among scholars, because &quot;The word is as functional now as it was fifty years ago. It means the kind of régime that existed in Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, the Soviet satellites, Communist China, and maybe Fascist Italy, where the word originated. . . . Who are we to tell Václav Havel or Adam Michnik that they were fooling themselves when they perceived their rulers as totalitarian? Or, for that matter, any of the millions of former subjects of Soviet-type rule who use the local equivalents of the Czech [word] &quot;totalita&quot; to describe the systems they lived under before 1989? [Totalitarianism] is a useful word, and everyone knows what it means as a general referent. Problems arise when people confuse the useful descriptive term with the old &#x27;theory&#x27; from the 1950s.&quot;

==Politics==
===Early usages===
====Italy====
In 1923, in the early reign of Mussolini&#x27;s government (1922–1943), the anti-fascist academic Giovanni Amendola was the first Italian public intellectual to define and describe Totalitarianism as a &quot;régime of government&quot; wherein the supreme leader personally exercises total power (political, military, economic, social) as &quot;Il Duce&quot; of The State. That Italian fascism is a political system with an ideological, utopian worldview unlike the realistic politics of the personal dictatorship of a man who holds power for the sake of holding power.

Later, the theoretician of Italian Fascism Giovanni Gentile ascribed politically positive meanings to the ideological terms &quot;totalitarianism&quot; and &quot;totalitarian&quot; in defence of &quot;Duce&quot; Mussolini&#x27;s legal, illegal, and legalistic social engineering of Italy. As ideologues, the intellectual Gentile and the politician Mussolini used the term &quot;totalitario&quot; to identify and describe the ideological nature of the societal structures (government, social, economic, political) and the practical goals (economic, geopolitical, social) of the new Fascist Italy (1922–1943), which was the &quot;total representation of the nation and total guidance of national goals.&quot; In proposing the totalitarian society of Italian Fascism, Gentile defined and described a civil society wherein totalitarian ideology (subservience to the state) determined the public sphere and the private sphere of the lives of the Italian people. That to achieve the Fascist utopia in the imperial future, Italian totalitarianism must politicise human existence into subservience to the state, which Mussolini summarised with the epigram: &quot;Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.&quot;

Hannah Arendt, in her book &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot;, contended that Mussolini&#x27;s dictatorship was not a totalitarian regime until 1938. Arguing that one of the key characteristics of a totalitarian movement was its ability to garner mass mobilization, Arendt wrote: &quot;While all political groups depend upon proportionate strength, totalitarian movements depend on the sheer force of numbers to such an extent that totalitarian regimes seem impossible, even under otherwise favorable circumstances, in countries with relatively small populations... [E]ven Mussolini, who was so fond of the term &quot;totalitarian state,&quot; did not attempt to establish a full-fledged totalitarian regime and contented himself with dictatorship and one-party rule.&quot;
For example, Victor Emmanuel III still reigned as a figurehead and helped play a role in the dismissal of Mussolini in 1943. Also, the Catholic Church was allowed to independently exercise its religious authority in Vatican City per the 1929 Lateran Treaty, under the leadership of Pope Pius XI (1922–1939) and Pope Pius XII (1939–1958).

====Britain====
One of the first people to use the term &quot;totalitarianism&quot; in the English language was Austrian writer Franz Borkenau in his 1938 book &quot;The Communist International&quot;, in which he commented that it united the Soviet and German dictatorships more than it divided them. The label &quot;totalitarian&quot; was twice affixed to Nazi Germany during Winston Churchill&#x27;s speech of 5 October 1938 before the House of Commons, in opposition to the Munich Agreement, by which France and Great Britain consented to Nazi Germany&#x27;s annexation of the Sudetenland. Churchill was then a backbencher MP representing the Epping constituency. In a radio address two weeks later, Churchill again employed the term, this time applying the concept to &quot;a Communist or a Nazi tyranny.&quot;

====Germany====
As the Nazis rose to power in 1933, they began using the concept of totaliarian state propagated by Mussolini and Schmitt to characterize their regime. Joseph Goebbels stated in his 1933 speech: &quot;Our party has always aspired to the totalitarian state. […] the goal of the revolution [National Socialist] has to be a totalitarian state that penetrates into all spheres of public life.&quot;

====Spain====
José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones, the leader of the historic Spanish reactionary party called the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA), declared his intention to &quot;give Spain a true unity, a new spirit, a totalitarian polity&quot; and went on to say: &quot;Democracy is not an end but a means to the conquest of the new state. When the time comes, either parliament submits or we will eliminate it.&quot; General Francisco Franco was determined not to have competing right-wing parties in Spain and CEDA was dissolved in April 1937. Later, Gil-Robles went into exile.

General Franco began using the term &#x27;totalitarian&#x27; towards his regime during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). On 1 October 1936, he announced his intention to organize Spain &quot;within a broad totalitarian concept of unity and continuity&quot;, and practical realization of this intention began with the forced unification of all parties of the Nationalist zone into FET y de las JONS, the sole ruling party of the new regime; after that, he and his ideologues stressed the &quot;missionary and totalitarian&quot; nature of the new state that was under construction &quot;as in other countries of totalitarian regime&quot;, these being Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, and totalitarianism was described as an essentially Spanish way of government. In December 1942, as World War II progressed, Franco stopped using the term, and it received negative connotation as Franco called for struggle with &quot;Bolshevist totalitarianism.&quot;

Politically matured by having fought and been wounded and survived the Spanish Civil War, in the essay &quot;Why I Write&quot; (1946), the socialist George Orwell said, &quot;the Spanish war and other events in 1936–37 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.&quot; That future totalitarian régimes would spy upon their societies and use the mass communications media to perpetuate their dictatorships, that &quot;If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—forever.&quot;

====USSR====

In the 1930s, left-wing critics of Stalinism began applying the term to the Soviet state and use it to compare it to fascist states. Leon Trotsky was one of the first to do so (becoming the most famous example of such usage of the term). It seems that the first to use the term towards the USSR was the writer and left-wing activist Victor Serge, who did it shortly before his arrest in the USSR in a letter published after the arrest in France. The same year, Trotsky compared fascist and Soviet bureaucracies, describing both as parasitic, and later stated that &quot;in the last period the Soviet bureaucracy has familiarised itself with many traits of victorious fascism, first of all by getting rid of the control of the party and establishing the cult of the leader.&quot; In &quot;The Revolution Betrayed&quot; (1936), Trotsky began using the term &quot;totalitarian&quot; to analyse the USSR and compare it with Fascism, attributing to totalitarianism, rooted in &quot;the dilatoriness of the world proletariat in solving the problems set for it by history&quot;, such features as concentration of power in the hands of a single individual, the abolition of popular control over the leadership, the use of extreme repression, and the elimination of contending loci of power; later he included &quot;the suppression of all freedom to criticize; the subjection of the accused to the military; examining magistrates, a prosecutor and judge in one; a monolithic press whose howlings terrorize the accused and hypnotize public opinion&quot;; Trotsky wrote that the USSR &quot;had become &quot;totalitarian&quot; in character several years before this word arrived from Germany.&quot; However, his concept was much less defined than the one of the Cold War theorists, and he would have disagreed with their core points: that &#x27;central control and direction of the entire economy&#x27; was applicable to fascism, and would have rejected their tendency to depict &#x27;totalitarian&#x27; societies as politically monolithic and inherently static, as well as their anti-communist perspective and their description of Lenin as a totalitarian dictator; scholars even argued that for him it was a pejorative, not a sociologal concept based on equating Fascism and socialism, like it was for Cold War theorists.

The concept gained legitimacy in 1939 with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, after which it became accepted, at least until 1941, to present Stalin and Hitler as &quot;twin dictators&quot; and call Nazism &quot;brown Bolshevism&quot; and Stalinism &quot;red Fascism&quot;. The same year, scholars of various disciplines held the first international symposium on totalitarianism in Philadelphia. The concept was abandoned in 1941, as the Third Reich invaded the USSR, and the latter became depicted in Western propaganda as &quot;valiant freedom-loving&quot; ally in the war; among the major productions of pro-Stalinist Western propaganda was the film &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot; (1943), based on the 1941 book of the same name.

In the aftermath of the Second World War (1939–1945), in the lecture series (1945) and book (1946) titled &quot;The Soviet Impact on the Western World&quot;, the British historian E. H. Carr said that &quot;the trend away from individualism and towards totalitarianism is everywhere unmistakable&quot; in the decolonising countries of Eurasia. That revolutionary Marxism–Leninism was the most successful type of totalitarianism, as proved by the USSR&#x27;s rapid industrialisation (1929–1941) and the Great Patriotic War (1941–1945) that defeated Nazi Germany. That, despite those achievements in social engineering and warfare, in dealing with the countries of the Communist bloc only the &quot;blind and incurable&quot; ideologue could ignore the Communist régimes&#x27; trend towards police-state totalitarianism in their societies.

===Cold War===
In &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot; (1951), the political scientist Hannah Arendt said that, in their times in the early 20th century, corporate Nazism and soviet Communism were new forms of totalitarian government, not updated versions of the old tyrannies of a military or a corporate dictatorship. That the human emotional comfort of &quot;political certainty&quot; is the source of the mass appeal of revolutionary totalitarian régimes, because the totalitarian worldview gives psychologically comforting and definitive answers about the complex socio-political mysteries of the past, of the present, and of the future; thus did Nazism propose that all history is the history of ethnic conflict, of the survival of the fittest race; and Marxism–Leninism proposes that all history is the history of class conflict, of the survival of the fittest social class. That upon the believers&#x27; acceptance of the &quot;universal applicability&quot; of totalitarian ideology, the Nazi revolutionary and the Communist revolutionary then possess the simplistic moral certainty with which to justify all other actions by the State, either by an appeal to historicism (Law of History) or by an appeal to nature, as expedient actions necessary to establishing an authoritarian state apparatus.

;True belief
In &quot;The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements&quot; (1951), Eric Hoffer said that political mass movements, such as Italian Fascism (1922–1943), German Nazism (1933–1945), and Russian Stalinism (1929–1953), featured the common political praxis of negatively comparing their totalitarian society as culturally superior to the morally decadent societies of the democratic countries of Western Europe. That such mass psychology indicates that participating in and then joining a political mass movement offers people the prospect of a glorious future, that such membership in a community of political belief is an emotional refuge for people with few accomplishments in their real lives, in both the public sphere and in the private sphere. In the event, the true believer is assimilated into a collective body of true believers who are mentally protected with &quot;fact-proof screens from reality&quot; drawn from the official texts of the totalitarian ideology.

;Collaborationism
In &quot;European Protestants Between Anti-Communism and Anti-Totalitarianism: The Other Interwar Kulturkampf?&quot; (2018) the historian Paul Hanebrink said that Hitler&#x27;s assumption of power in Germany in 1933 frightened Christians into anti-communism, because for European Christians, Catholic and Protestant alike, the new postwar &#x27;culture war&#x27; crystallized as a struggle against Communism. Throughout the European interwar period (1918–1939), right-wing totalitarian régimes indoctrinated Christians to demonize the Communist régime in Russia as the apotheosis of secular materialism and [as] a militarized threat to worldwide Christian social and moral order&quot;. That throughout Europe, the Christians who became anti-communist totalitarians perceived Communism and communist régimes of government as an existential threat to the moral order of their respective societies; and collaborated with Fascists and Nazis in the idealistic hope that anti-communism would restore the societies of Europe to their root Christian culture.

====Totalitarian model====
In the U.S. geopolitics of the late 1950s, the Cold War concepts and the terms &quot;totalitarianism&quot;, &quot;totalitarian&quot;, and &quot;totalitarian model&quot;, presented in &quot;Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy&quot; (1956), by Carl Joachim Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski, became common usages in the foreign-policy discourse of the U.S. Subsequently established, the &quot;totalitarian model&quot; became the analytic and interpretational paradigm for Kremlinology, the academic study of the monolithic police-state USSR. The Kremlinologists analyses of the internal politics (policy and personality) of the politburo crafting policy (national and foreign) yielded strategic intelligence for dealing with the USSR. Moreover, the U.S. also used the totalitarian model when dealing with fascist totalitarian régimes, such as that of a banana republic country. As anti–Communist political scientists, Friedrich and Brzezinski described and defined totalitarianism with the monolithic totalitarian model of six interlocking, mutually supporting characteristics:

# Elaborate guiding ideology.
# One-party state
# State terrorism
# Monopoly control of weapons
# Monopoly control of the mass communications media
# Centrally directed and controlled planned economy

====Criticism and evolution of the totalitarian model====

As traditionalist historians, Friedrich and Brzezinski said that the totalitarian régimes of government in the USSR (1917), Fascist Italy (1922–1943), and Nazi Germany (1933–1945) originated from the political discontent caused by the socio-economic aftermath of the First World War (1914–1918), which rendered impotent the government of Weimar Germany (1918–1933) to resist, counter, and quell left-wing and right-wing revolutions of totalitarian temper. Revisionist historians noted the historiographic limitations of the totalitarian-model interpretation of Soviet and Russian history, because Friedrich and Brzezinski did not take account of the actual functioning of the Soviet social system, neither as a political entity (the USSR) nor as a social entity (Soviet civil society), which could be understood in terms of socialist class struggle among the professional élites (political, academic, artistic, scientific, military) seeking upward mobility into the &quot;nomenklatura&quot;, the ruling class of the USSR. That the political economics of the politburo allowed measured executive power to regional authorities for them to implement policy was interpreted by revisionist historians as evidence that a totalitarian régime adapts the political economy to include new economic demands from civil society; whereas traditionalist historians interpreted the politico-economic collapse of the USSR to prove that the totalitarian régime of economics failed because the politburo did not adapt the political economy to include actual popular participation in the Soviet economy.

The historian of Nazi Germany, Karl Dietrich Bracher said that the &quot;totalitarian typology&quot; developed by Friedrich and Brzezinski was an inflexible model, for not including the &quot;revolutionary dynamics&quot; of bellicose people committed to realising the violent revolution required to establish totalitarianism in a sovereign state. That the essence of totalitarianism is total control to remake every aspect of civil society using a universal ideology—which is interpreted by an authoritarian leader—to create a collective national identity by merging civil society into the State. Given that the supreme leaders of the Communist, the Fascist, and the Nazi total states did possess government administrators, Bracher said that a totalitarian government did not necessarily require an actual supreme leader, and could function by way of collective leadership. The American historian Walter Laqueur agreed that Bracher&#x27;s totalitarian typology more accurately described the functional reality of the politburo than did the totalitarian typology proposed by Friedrich and Brzezinski.

In &quot;Democracy and Totalitarianism&quot; (1968) the political scientist Raymond Aron said that for a régime of government to be considered totalitarian it can be described and defined with the totalitarian model of five interlocking, mutually supporting characteristics:

# A one-party state where the ruling party has a monopoly on all political activity.
# A state ideology upheld by the ruling party that is given official status as the only authority.
# A state monopoly on information; control of the mass communications media to broadcast the official truth.
# A state-controlled economy featuring major economic entities under state control.
# An ideological police-state terror; criminalisation of political, economic, and professional activities.

In 1980, in a book review of &quot;How the Soviet Union is Governed&quot; (1979), by J.F. Hough and Merle Fainsod, William Zimmerman said that &quot;the Soviet Union has changed substantially. Our knowledge of the Soviet Union has changed, as well. We all know that the traditional paradigm [of the totalitarian model] no longer satisfies [our ignorance], despite several efforts, primarily in the early 1960s (the directed society, totalitarianism without police terrorism, the system of conscription) to articulate an acceptable variant [of Communist totalitarianism]. We have come to realize that models which were, in effect, offshoots of totalitarian models do not provide good approximations of post–Stalinist reality [of the USSR].&quot; In a book review of &quot;Totalitarian Space and the Destruction of Aura&quot; (2019), by Ahmed Saladdin, Michael Scott Christofferson said that Hannah Arendt&#x27;s interpretation of the USSR after Stalin was her attempt to intellectually distance her work from &quot;the Cold War misuse of the concept [of the origins of totalitarianism]&quot; as anti-Communist propaganda.

===Kremlinology===
During the Russo–American Cold War (1945–1989), the academic field of Kremlinology (analysing politburo policy politics) produced historical and policy analyses dominated by the &quot;totalitarian model&quot; of the USSR as a police state controlled by the absolute power of the supreme leader Stalin, who heads a monolithic, centralised hierarchy of government. The study of the internal politics of the politburo crafting policy at the Kremlin produced two schools of historiographic interpretation of Cold War history: (i) traditionalist Kremlinology and (ii) revisionist Kremlinology. Traditionalist Kremlinologists worked with and for the &quot;totalitarian model&quot; and produced interpretations of Kremlin politics and policies that supported the police-state version of &quot;Communist Russia&quot;. The revisionist Kremlinologists presented alternative interpretations of Kremlin politics and reported the effects of politburo policies upon Soviet society, civil and military. Despite the limitations of police-state historiography, revisionist Kremlinologists said that the old image of the Stalinist USSR of the 1950s—a totalitarian state intent upon world domination—was oversimplified and inaccurate, because the death of Stalin changed Soviet society. After the Cold War and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, most revisionist Kremlinologists worked the national archives of ex–Communist states, especially the State Archive of the Russian Federation about Soviet-period Russia.

====Totalitarian model as an official policy====
In the 1950s, the political scientist Carl Joachim Friedrich said that Communist states, such as Soviet Russia and Red China, were countries which were systematically controlled by a supreme leader who utilized the five features of the &quot;totalitarian model&quot; of government: (i) an official dominant ideology that includes a cult of personality about the leader, (ii) control of all civil and military weapons, (iii) control of the public and the private mass communications media, (iv) the use of state terrorism to police the populace, and (v) a political party of mass membership who perpetually re-elect The Leader.

In the 1960s, the revisionist Kremlinologists researched the organisations and they also studied the policies of the relatively autonomous bureaucracies that influenced the crafting of high-level policy for governing Soviet society in the USSR. Revisionist Kremlinologists, such as J. Arch Getty and Lynne Viola, transcended the interpretational limitations of the totalitarian model by &quot;recognising&quot; and &quot;reporting&quot; that the Soviet government, the communist party, and the civil society of the USSR had greatly changed upon the death of Stalin. The revisionist social history indicated that the social forces of Soviet society had compelled the Government of the USSR to adjust public policy to the actual political economy of a Soviet society composed of pre–War and post–War generations of people with different perceptions of the utility of Communist economics for all the Russias. Hence, Russian modern history had outdated the &quot;totalitarian model&quot; that was the post–Stalinist perception of the police-state USSR of the 1950s.

===Post–Cold War===
In &quot;Did Somebody Say Totalitarianism?: Five Interventions in the (Mis)Use of a Notion&quot;, Slavoj Žižek ironcially described the concept of totalitarianism as an &quot;ideological antioxidant&quot; similar to the &quot;Celestial Seasonings&quot; green tea that, according to its advertisment, &quot;neutralizes harmful molecules in the body known as free radicals&quot; and wrote that &quot;[t]he notion of &#x27;totalitarianism&#x27;, far from being an effective theoretical concept, is a kind of stopgap: instead of enabling us to think, forcing us to acquire a new insight into the historical reality it describes, it relieves us of the duty to think, or even actively prevents us from thinking&quot;.

Saladdin Ahmed criticizes the concept of totalitarianism as formulated by Brzezinski and Friedrich, and to less extent, Arendt, in &quot;Totalitarian Space and the Destruction of Aura&quot; (2019) and notes that their definition of totalitarianism can be invalidated by questioning whether the term &#x27;totalitarian&#x27; is applicable to a regime which lacks &quot;any one&quot; of criterion formulated by them: &quot;this was the case in General August Pinochet&#x27;s Chile&quot;, yet it would be absurd to exempt it from the class of totalitarian regimes for that reason alone&quot;, since while Pinochet did not adopt an &quot;official&quot; ideology, but &quot;ideological hegemony, whereby the dominant ideology becomes internalized and normalized, is far more effective than imposing an official ideology.&quot; Saladdin posited that while Chile under Pinochet had no &quot;official&quot; ideology, there was one man who ruled Chile from &quot;behind the scenes&quot;, &quot;none other than Milton Friedman, the godfather of neoliberalism and the most influential teacher of the Chicago Boys, was Pinochet&#x27;s adviser&quot;. To Saladdin, such hegemonic yet not &quot;official&quot; ideology is much a more effective means of &quot;totalitarian&quot; control of society than an &quot;official&quot; ideology openly imposed by the state, what is exemplified by comparing Chile to Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s Romania, which collapsed within a short period: &quot;No one defended them; no masses poured onto the streets to mourn their deaths. Ceausescu&#x27;s Romania, as an exemplary Stalinist state, met all of Friedrich and Brzezinski&#x27;s criteria of a totalitarian state, but it was nowhere close to achieving total domination.&quot; In this sense, Saladdin criticised the concept of totalitarianism because it was only being applied to &quot;opposing ideologies&quot; and it was not being applied to liberalism. He also criticized the other criterion of totalitarianism formulated by Brzezinski, Friedrich and Arendt. &quot;In sum, a regime that does not meet all of Friedrich and Brzezinski&#x27;s criteria would not necessarily be nontotalitarian or even less totalitarian, if we agree that totalitarianism ultimately amounts to total domination. If anything, realizing a greater degree of domination would necessarily require going beyond each of Friedrich and Brzezinski&#x27;s criteria. Even without empirical cases which can always be dismissed to spare the proposed criteria - we could, with little difficulty, imagine a system that demonstrates none of the six criteria but is nonetheless more efficient as a totalitarian system. This will become clearer over the course of the rest of this chapter, but it should already be evident that the pioneers of the Cold War definition of totalitarianism molded their conception on the least developed of totalitarian systems... Tailored to Stalinism, [totalitarianism] aimed to predetermine that the negation of liberal capitalism would logically and empirically lead to a horrific system of total and arbitrary terror&quot;; &quot;Philosophically, their account of totalitarianism is invalid because it stipulates &quot;criteria&quot; that amount to an abstracted description of Stalin&#x27;s USSR, rendering the notion predeterministic.&quot;

In the early 2010s, Richard Shorten, Vladimir Tismăneanu, and Aviezer Tucker posited that totalitarian ideologies can take different forms in different political systems but all of them focus on utopianism, scientism, or political violence. They posit that Nazism and Stalinism both emphasised the role of specialisation in modern societies and they also saw polymathy as a thing of the past, and they also stated that their claims were supported by statistics and science, which led them to impose strict ethical regulations on culture, use psychological violence, and persecute entire groups. Their arguments have been criticised by other scholars due to their partiality and anachronism. Juan Francisco Fuentes treats totalitarianism as an &quot;invented tradition&quot; and he believes that the notion of &quot;modern despotism&quot; is a &quot;reverse anachronism&quot;; for Fuentes, &quot;the anachronistic use of totalitarian/totalitarianism involves the will to reshape the past in the image and likeness of the present&quot;.

Other studies try to link modern technological changes to totalitarianism. According to Shoshana Zuboff, the economic pressures of modern surveillance capitalism are driving the intensification of connection and monitoring online with spaces of social life becoming open to saturation by corporate actors, directed at the making of profit and/or the regulation of action. Toby Ord believed that George Orwell&#x27;s fears of totalitarianism constituted a notable early precursor to modern notions of anthropogenic existential risk, the concept that a future catastrophe could permanently destroy the potential of Earth-originating intelligent life due in part to technological changes, creating a permanent technological dystopia. Ord said that Orwell&#x27;s writings show that his concern was genuine rather than just a throwaway part of the fictional plot of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. In 1949, Orwell wrote that &quot;[a] ruling class which could guard against (four previously enumerated sources of risk) would remain in power permanently&quot;. That same year, Bertrand Russell wrote that &quot;modern techniques have made possible a new intensity of governmental control, and this possibility has been exploited very fully in totalitarian states&quot;.

In 2016, &quot;The Economist&quot; described China&#x27;s developed Social Credit System under Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping&#x27;s administration, to screen and rank its citizens based on their personal behavior, as &quot;totalitarian&quot;. Opponents of China&#x27;s ranking system say that it is intrusive and it is just another tool which a one-party state can use to control the population. Supporters say that it will transform China into a more civilised and law-abiding society. Shoshana Zuboff considers it instrumentarian rather than totalitarian.

In &quot;Revolution and Dictatorship: The Violent Origins of Durable Authoritarianism&quot; (2022), the political scientists Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way said that nascent revolutionary régimes usually became totalitarian régimes if not destroyed with a military invasion. Such a revolutionary régime begins as a social revolution independent of the existing social structures of the state (not political succession, election to office, or a military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;). For example, the Soviet Union and Maoist China were founded after the years long Russian Civil War (1917–1922) and Chinese Civil War (1927-1936 and 1945–1949), respectively, not merely state succession. They produce totalitarian dictatorships with three functional characteristics: (i) a cohesive ruling class comprising the military and the political élites, (ii) a strong and loyal coercive apparatus of police and military forces to suppress dissent, and (iii) the destruction of rival political parties, organisations, and independent centres of socio-political power. Moreover, the unitary functioning of the characteristics of totalitarianism allow a totalitarian government to perdure against economic crises (internal and external), large-scale failures of policy, mass social-discontent, and political pressure from other countries. Some totalitarian one-party states were established through coups orchestrated by military officers loyal to a vanguard party that advanced socialist revolution, such as the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma (1962), Syrian Arab Republic (1963), and Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (1978).

North Korea is the only country in East Asia to survive totalitarianism after the death of Kim Il-sung in 1994 and handed over to his son Kim Jong-il and grandson Kim Jong-un in 2011, as of today in the 21st century.

Other emerging technologies that could empower future totalitarian regimes include brain-reading, contact tracing, and various applications of artificial intelligence. Philosopher Nick Bostrom said that there is a possible trade-off, namely that some existential risks might be mitigated by the establishment of a powerful and permanent world government, and in turn the establishment of such a government could enhance the existential risks which are associated with the rule of a permanent dictatorship.

===Religious totalitarianism===
====Islamic====

The Taliban is a totalitarian Sunni Islamist militant group and political movement in Afghanistan that emerged in the aftermath of the Soviet–Afghan War and the end of the Cold War. It governed most of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and returned to power in 2021, controlling the entirety of Afghanistan. Features of its totalitarian governance include the imposition of Pashtunwali culture of the majority Pashtun ethnic group as religious law, the exclusion of minorities and non-Taliban members from the government, and extensive violations of women&#x27;s rights.

The Islamic State is a Salafi-Jihadist militant group that was established in 2006 by Abu Omar al-Baghdadi during the Iraqi insurgency, under the name &quot;Islamic State of Iraq&quot;. Under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the organization later changed its name to the &quot;Islamic State of Iraq and Levant&quot; in 2013. The group espouses a totalitarian ideology that is a fundamentalist hybrid of Global Jihadism, Wahhabism, and Qutbism. Following its territorial expansion in 2014, the group renamed itself as the &quot;Islamic State&quot; and declared itself as a caliphate that sought domination over the Muslim world and established what has been described as a &quot;political-religious totalitarian regime&quot;. The quasi-state held significant territory in Iraq and Syria during the course of the Third Iraq War and the Syrian civil war from 2013 to 2019 under the dictatorship of its first Caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who imposed a strict interpretation of Sharia law.

==== Criticism of the classification of Islamism as totalitarianism ====
Enzo Traverso, a critic of totalitarianism as a theoretical concept of historical and political sciences, is also critical of the usage of it in relation to Islamist movements like ISIS and the Taliban and their state formations: according to Traverso, such notion contradicts the very theoretical concept of totalitarianism. Systems which are commonly described as totalitarian, fascism and communism, sought to create a utopian &quot;New Man&quot; and as a result, they set their projects toward the future, not to revive old forms of absolutism, as noted by Tzvetan Todorov. &quot;The reactionary modernism of Islamic terrorism, on the contrary, employs modern technologies in order to return to the original purity of a mythical Islam. If it has utopian tendencies, they look to the past rather than the future.&quot; More to it, totalitarianism has been applied to secular movements which have been described as irrational &quot;political religions&quot; which seek to abolish traditional religions, liturgies and symbols and replace them with their own liturgies and symbols, while Islamic fundamentalism, on the contrary, is a politicized religion and a reaction to secularization and modernisation. Besides that, as a form of violence, terrorism is usually described as antipodal to state violence; while fascism was a reaction to democracy, Islamism arose in authoritarian, but weak states. &quot;Speaking of a &quot;theocratic&quot; totalitarianism makes this concept even more flexible and ambiguous than ever, once again confirming its essential function: not critically interpreting history and the world, but rather fighting an enemy&quot;. Traverso writes that the usage of the term began after 9/11 by Western propaganda, which previously used it against the other enemies while maintaining the geopolitical interests of the West. He notes that the Islamic state which most resembles the concept of totalitarianism, Saudi Arabia, is an ally of the West and as a result, it cannot be considered a part of the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;, and for that reason, as he believes, Saudi Arabia is rarely described as &quot;totalitarian&quot;, unlike Iran.

====Christian====
Francoist Spain (1936–1975), under the dictator Francisco Franco, had been commonly characterized as totalitarian until 1964, when Juan Linz challenged this characterization and instead described Francoism as &quot;authoritarian&quot; because of its &quot;limited degree of political pluralism&quot; caused by the struggle between &#x27;Francoist families&#x27; (Falangists, Carlists, etc.) within the sole legal party FET y de las JONS and the &quot;Movimiento Nacional&quot; and by other such features as, according to Linz, lack of &#x27;totalitarian&#x27; ideology, as Franco relied on National Catholicism and traditionalism. Such revision caused a major debate, some critics of Linz felt that his concept may be a form of acquittal of Francoism and did not concern its early phase (often called &quot;First Francoism&quot;). Later debates focused on whether the regime could be described as &#x27;fascist&#x27; rather than whether it was totalitarian; some historians stressed the traits of a military dictatorship, while the others emphasized the Fascist component, calling the regime a para-fascist or &#x27;fascistized&#x27; dictatorship. While Enrique Moradiellos notes that &quot;it is now increasingly rare to define Francoism as a truly fascist and totalitarian regime&quot;, although he writes that the debates on Francoism haven&#x27;t finished yet, Ismael Saz notes that &quot;it has also begun to be recognised that&quot; Francoism underwent a &quot;totalitarian or quasi-totalitarian, fascist or quasi-fascist&quot; phase. The historians who continue to criticize Linz and describe the regime as totalitarian usually limit such characterization to ten to twenty years of the &quot;First Francoism .&quot;

Linz wrote that &quot;the heteronomous control of the ideological content of Catholic thought by a universal church and specifically by the Pope is one of the most serious obstacles to the creation of a truly totalitarian system...&quot; This argument is also debated: &quot;The frequent and saturated references to Francoist Catholic humanism... coming from Christian theology, could hardly conceal the fact that the individual was only understood as a citizen to the extent of his adherence to the Catholic, hierarchical and economically privatist community that the military uprising had saved&quot;; &quot;Catholic values that permeated the conservative ideological substratum... were precisely what was wielded by the Francoist Spanish political doctrine of the late thirties and early forties to justify the need for the constitution of a totalitarian State at the service and expansion of the Catholic religion.&quot;

Franco was portrayed as a fervent Catholic and a staunch defender of Catholicism, the declared state religion. Civil marriages that had taken place in the Republic were declared null and void unless they had been validated by the Church, along with divorces. Divorce, contraception and abortions were forbidden. According to historian Stanley G. Payne, an opponent of describing Francoism as a totalitarian system, Franco had more day-to-day power than Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin possessed at the respective heights of their power. Payne noted that Hitler and Stalin at least maintained rubber-stamp parliaments, while Franco dispensed with even that formality in the early years of his rule. According to Payne, the lack of even a rubber-stamp parliament made Franco&#x27;s government &quot;the most purely arbitrary in the world.&quot; However, from 1959 to 1974 the &quot;Spanish Miracle&quot; took place under the leadership of technocrats, many of whom were members of Opus Dei and a new generation of politicians that replaced the old Falangist guard. Reforms were implemented in the 1950s and Spain abandoned autarky, reassigning economic authority from the isolationist Falangist movement. This led to massive economic growth that lasted until the mid-1970s, known as the &quot;Spanish miracle&quot;. This is comparable to De-Stalinization in the Soviet Union in the 1950s, where Francoist Spain changed from being openly totalitarian to an authoritarian dictatorship with a certain degree of economic freedom.

== Early totalitarianism ==
The concept of totalitarianism has also been applied to historical states that existed prior to the 20th century and it has even been applied to states which existed in antiquity. For example, the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; applies the concept of totalitarianism to such states as the Mauryan dynasty of India (c. 321–c. 185 bce), the Qin dynasty of China (221–207 bce), and the reign of Zulu chief Shaka (c. 1816–28) Such authors as Peter Bernholz (&quot;Oxford University Press&quot;) apply the concept of totalitarianism to the city of Geneva under John Calvin&#x27;s leadership, the Mongol, Aztec and Inca empires, Münster during the Anabaptist rebellion, and the Mahdist State.

<text>Thomas Gray (26 December 1716 – 30 July 1771) was an English poet, letter-writer, and classical scholar at Cambridge University, being a fellow first of Peterhouse then of Pembroke College. He is widely known for his &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,&quot; published in 1751.

Gray was a self-critical writer who published only 13 poems in his lifetime, despite being very popular. He was even offered the position of Poet Laureate in 1757 after the death of Colley Cibber, though he declined.

==Early life and education==
Thomas Gray was born in Cornhill, London. His father, Philip Gray, was a scrivener and his mother, Dorothy Antrobus, was a milliner. He was the fifth of twelve children, and the only one to survive infancy. An 1803 newspaper article including a biography of Gray suggests that Gray almost died in infancy due to suffocation from a fullness of blood. However, his mother “ventured to open a vein with her own hand, which instantly removed the paroxysm,” saving his life. He lived with his mother after she left his abusive and mentally unwell father.

Gray&#x27;s mother paid for him to go to Eton College, where his uncles Robert and William Antrobus worked. Robert became Gray&#x27;s first teacher and helped inspire in Gray a love for botany and observational science. Gray&#x27;s other uncle, William, became his tutor. He recalled his schooldays as a time of great happiness, as is evident in his &quot;&quot;. Gray was a delicate and scholarly boy who spent his time reading and avoiding athletics. He lived in his uncle&#x27;s household rather than at college. He made three close friends at Eton: Horace Walpole, son of the Prime Minister Robert Walpole; Thomas Ashton; and Richard West, son of another Richard West (who was briefly Lord Chancellor of Ireland). The four prided themselves on their sense of style, sense of humour, and appreciation of beauty. They were called the &quot;quadruple alliance&quot;. Gray’s nickname in the “Quadruple Alliance” was Orozmades, “the Zoroastrian divinity, who is mentioned in Lee’s &quot;The Rival Queens&quot; as a ‘dreadful god’ who from his cave issues groans and shrieks to predict the fall of Babylon.”

In 1734, Gray went up to Peterhouse, Cambridge. He found the curriculum dull. He wrote letters to friends listing all the things he disliked: the masters (&quot;mad with Pride&quot;) and the Fellows (&quot;sleepy, drunken, dull, illiterate Things&quot;). Intended by his family for the law, he spent most of his time as an undergraduate reading classical and modern literature, and playing Vivaldi and Scarlatti on the harpsichord for relaxation. 

In 1738, he accompanied his old school friend Walpole on his Grand Tour of Europe, possibly at Walpole&#x27;s expense. The two fell out and parted in Tuscany because Walpole wanted to attend fashionable parties and Gray wanted to visit all the antiquities. They were reconciled a few years later. It was Walpole who later helped publish Gray&#x27;s poetry. When Gray sent his most famous poem, &quot;Elegy&quot;, to Walpole, Walpole sent off the poem as a manuscript and it appeared in different magazines. Gray then published the poem himself and received the credit he was due.

==Writing and academia==
Gray began seriously writing poems in 1742, mainly after the death of his close friend Richard West, which inspired &quot;Sonnet on the Death of Richard West&quot;. He moved to Cambridge and began a self-directed programme of literary study, becoming one of the most learned men of his time. He became a Fellow first of Peterhouse, and later of Pembroke College, Cambridge. According to college tradition, he left Peterhouse for Pembroke College after being the victim of a practical joke played by undergraduates. Gray is supposed to have been afraid of fire, and had attached a bar outside his window to which a rope could be tied. After being woken by undergraduates with a fire made of shavings, Gray climbed down the rope but landed in a tub of water which had been placed below his window.

Gray spent most of his life as a scholar in Cambridge, and only later in his life did he begin travelling again. Although he was one of the least productive poets (his collected works published during his lifetime amount to fewer than 1,000 lines), he is regarded as the foremost English-language poet of the mid-18th century. In 1757, he was offered the post of Poet Laureate, which he refused. Gray was so self-critical and fearful of failure that he published only thirteen poems during his lifetime. He once wrote that he feared his collected works would be &quot;mistaken for the works of a flea.&quot; Walpole said that &quot;He never wrote anything easily but things of Humour.&quot; Gray came to be known as one of the &quot;Graveyard poets&quot; of the late 18th century, along with Oliver Goldsmith, William Cowper, and Christopher Smart. Gray perhaps knew these men, sharing ideas about death, mortality, and the finality and sublimity of death.

In 1762, the Regius chair of Modern History at Cambridge, a sinecure which carried a salary of £400, fell vacant after the death of Shallet Turner, and Gray&#x27;s friends lobbied the government unsuccessfully to secure the position for him. In the event, Gray lost out to Lawrence Brockett, but he secured the position in 1768 after Brockett&#x27;s death.

== Poems ==

* &quot;Ode on the Spring&quot; (written in 1742)
* &quot;On the Death of Richard West&quot; (written in 1742)
* &quot;Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat, Drowned in a Tub of Goldfishes&quot; (written in 1747) 
* &quot;Ode to a Distant Prospect of Eton College&quot; (written in 1747 and published anonymously)
* &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot; (written between 1745 and 1750)
* &quot;The Progress of Poesy: A Pindaric Ode&quot; (written between 1751 and 1754)
* &quot;The Bard: A Pindaric Ode&quot; (written between 1755 and 1757) 
* &quot;The Fatal Sisters: An Ode&quot; (written in 1761)

==&quot;Elegy&quot; masterpiece==

It is believed by a number of writers that Gray began writing arguably his most celebrated piece, the &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot;, in the graveyard of St Giles&#x27; parish church in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire (though this claim is not exclusive), in 1742. After several years of leaving it unfinished, he completed it in 1750 (see elegy for the form). The poem was a literary sensation when published by Robert Dodsley in February 1751 (see 1751 in poetry). Its reflective, calm, and stoic tone was greatly admired, and it was pirated, imitated, quoted, and translated into Latin and Greek. It is still one of the most popular and frequently quoted poems in the English language.

In 1759, during the Seven Years War, before the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, British General James Wolfe is said to have recited it to one of his officers, adding, &quot;I would prefer being the author of that Poem to the glory of beating the French to-morrow.&quot;

The &quot;Elegy&quot; was recognised immediately for its beauty and skill. It contains many phrases which have entered the common English lexicon, either on their own or as quoted in other works. These include:

* &quot;The Paths of Glory&quot; (the title of a 1957 anti-war movie about World War I, produced by and starring Kirk Douglas, and directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on a novel of the same name by Humphrey Cobb).
* &quot;Celestial fire&quot;
* &quot;Some mute inglorious Milton&quot;
* &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (the title of a novel by Thomas Hardy, filmed several times)
*&quot;Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, and waste its sweetness on the desert air,&quot; is quoted often, including by Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon) in the film &quot;Bull Durham&quot;
* &quot;The unlettered muse&quot;
* &quot;Kindred spirit&quot;

&quot;Elegy&quot; contemplates such themes as death and afterlife. These themes foreshadowed the upcoming Gothic movement. It is suggested that perhaps Gray found inspiration for his poem by visiting the grave-site of his aunt, Mary Antrobus. The aunt was buried at the graveyard by the St. Giles&#x27; churchyard, which he and his mother would visit. This is the same grave-site where Gray himself was later buried.
Gray also wrote light verse, including &quot;&quot;, a mock-heroic elegy concerning Horace Walpole&#x27;s cat. Even this humorous poem contains some of Gray&#x27;s most famous lines. Walpole owned two cats: Zara and Selima. Scholars allude to the name Selima mentioned in the poem. After setting the scene with the couplet &quot;What female heart can gold despise? What cat&#x27;s averse to fish?&quot;, the poem moves to its multiple proverbial conclusion: &quot;a fav&#x27;rite has no friend&quot;, &quot;[k]now one false step is ne&#x27;er retrieved&quot; and &quot;nor all that glisters, gold&quot;. (Walpole later displayed the fatal china vase (the tub) on a pedestal at his house in Strawberry Hill, where it can still be seen).

Gray&#x27;s surviving letters also show his sharp observation and playful sense of humour. He is well known for his phrase, &quot;where , &#x27;tis folly to be wise,&quot; from &quot;&quot;. It has been asserted that the Ode also abounds with images which find &quot;a mirror in every mind&quot;. This was stated by Samuel Johnson who said of the poem, &quot;I rejoice to concur with the common reader ... The Church-yard abounds with images which find a mirror in every mind, and with sentiments to which every bosom returns an echo&quot;. Indeed, Gray&#x27;s poem follows the style of the mid-century literary endeavour to write of &quot;universal feelings.&quot; Samuel Johnson also said of Gray that he spoke in &quot;two languages&quot;. He spoke in the language of &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; and according to Johnson, he should have spoken more in his private language as he did in his &quot;Elegy&quot; poem.

==Forms==

Gray considered his two Pindaric odes, &quot;The Progress of Poesy&quot; and &quot;The Bard&quot;, as his best works. Pindaric odes are to be written with fire and passion, unlike the calmer and more reflective Horatian odes such as &quot;Ode on a distant Prospect of Eton College&quot;. &quot;The Bard&quot; tells of a wild Welsh poet cursing the Norman king Edward I after his conquest of Wales and prophesying in detail the downfall of the House of Plantagenet. It is melodramatic, and ends with the bard hurling himself to his death from the top of a mountain.

When his duties allowed, Gray travelled widely throughout Britain to places such as Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Scotland and most notably the Lake District (see his &quot;Journal of a Visit to the Lake District&quot; in 1769) in search of picturesque landscapes and ancient monuments. These elements were not generally valued in the early 18th century, when the popular taste ran to classical styles in architecture and literature, and most people liked their scenery tame and well-tended. The Gothic details that appear in his &quot;Elegy&quot; and &quot;The Bard&quot; are a part of the first foreshadowing of the Romantic movement that dominated the early 19th century, when William Wordsworth and the other Lake poets taught people to value the picturesque, the sublime, and the Gothic. Gray combined traditional forms and poetic diction with new topics and modes of expression, and may be considered as a classically focused precursor of the romantic revival.

Gray&#x27;s connection to the Romantic poets is vexed. In the prefaces to the 1800 and 1802 editions of Wordsworth&#x27;s and Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;, Wordsworth singled out Gray&#x27;s &quot;Sonnet on the Death of Richard West&quot; to exemplify what he found most objectionable in poetry, declaring it was
&quot;Gray, who was at the head of those who, by their reasonings, have attempted to widen the space of separation betwixt prose and metrical composition, and was more than any other man curiously elaborate in the structure of his own poetic diction.&quot; Gray wrote in a letter to West, that &quot;the language of the age is never the language of poetry.&quot;

==Death==

Gray died on 30 July 1771 in Cambridge, and was buried beside his mother in the churchyard of the Church of St Giles, Stoke Poges, the reputed (though disputed) setting for his famous &quot;Elegy&quot;. His grave can still be seen there. A monument sculpted by John Bacon was also erected in Westminster Abbey soon after his death.

== Scholarly Reception ==
Today, Gray remains a topic of academic discussion. Some scholars analyze his work for his use of language and inspiration from Greek classics and Norse poetry. Other scholars, such as George E. Haggerty, focus on Gray&#x27;s various relationships with other men, examining his letters and poetry for instances of &quot;male-male love&quot; and &quot;same-sex desire.&quot;

==Honours==
*Gray&#x27;s biographer William Mason erected a monument to him, designed by John Bacon the Elder, in Poets&#x27; Corner at Westminster Abbey in 1778.
*John Penn &quot;of Stoke&quot; had a memorial to Gray built near St Giles&#x27; churchyard and engraved with extracts from the &quot;Elegy&quot;.
*A plaque in Cornhill, London marks his birthplace.

<text>In mathematics, the Taylor series or Taylor expansion of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function&#x27;s derivatives at a single point. For most common functions, the function and the sum of its Taylor series are equal near this point. Taylor series are named after Brook Taylor, who introduced them in 1715. A Taylor series is also called a Maclaurin series when 0 is the point where the derivatives are considered, after Colin Maclaurin, who made extensive use of this special case of Taylor series in the 18th century.

The partial sum formed by the first terms of a Taylor series is a polynomial of degree that is called the th Taylor polynomial of the function. Taylor polynomials are approximations of a function, which become generally more accurate as increases. Taylor&#x27;s theorem gives quantitative estimates on the error introduced by the use of such approximations. If the Taylor series of a function is convergent, its sum is the limit of the infinite sequence of the Taylor polynomials. A function may differ from the sum of its Taylor series, even if its Taylor series is convergent. A function is analytic at a point if it is equal to the sum of its Taylor series in some open interval (or open disk in the complex plane) containing . This implies that the function is analytic at every point of the interval (or disk).

==Definition==
The Taylor series of a real or complex-valued function , that is infinitely differentiable at a real or complex number , is the power series

formula_1
Here, denotes the factorial of . The function denotes the th derivative of evaluated at the point . The derivative of order zero of is defined to be itself and and are both defined to be 1. This series can be written by using sigma notation, as in the right side formula. With , the Maclaurin series takes the form:
formula_2

==Examples==
The Taylor series of any polynomial is the polynomial itself.

The Maclaurin series of is the geometric series

formula_3

So, by substituting for , the Taylor series of at is

formula_4

By integrating the above Maclaurin series, we find the Maclaurin series of , where denotes the natural logarithm:

formula_5

The corresponding Taylor series of at is

formula_6

and more generally, the corresponding Taylor series of at an arbitrary nonzero point is:

formula_7

The Maclaurin series of the exponential function is

formula_8

The above expansion holds because the derivative of with respect to is also , and equals 1. This leaves the terms in the numerator and in the denominator of each term in the infinite sum.

== History ==
The ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea considered the problem of summing an infinite series to achieve a finite result, but rejected it as an impossibility; the result was Zeno&#x27;s paradox. Later, Aristotle proposed a philosophical resolution of the paradox, but the mathematical content was apparently unresolved until taken up by Archimedes, as it had been prior to Aristotle by the Presocratic Atomist Democritus. It was through Archimedes&#x27;s method of exhaustion that an infinite number of progressive subdivisions could be performed to achieve a finite result. Liu Hui independently employed a similar method a few centuries later.

In the 14th century, the earliest examples of specific Taylor series (but not the general method) were given by Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama. Though no record of his work survives, writings of his followers in the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics suggest that he found the Taylor series for the trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, and arctangent (see Madhava series). During the following two centuries his followers developed further series expansions and rational approximations.

In late 1670, James Gregory was shown in a letter from John Collins several Maclaurin series formula_9 formula_10 and derived by Isaac Newton, and told that Newton had developed a general method for expanding functions in series. Newton had in fact used a cumbersome method involving long division of series and term-by-term integration, but Gregory did not know it and set out to discover a general method for himself. In early 1671 Gregory discovered something like the general Maclaurin series and sent a letter to Collins including series for formula_11 formula_12 formula_13 formula_14 (the integral of formula_15 (the integral of, the inverse Gudermannian function), formula_16 and formula_17 (the Gudermannian function). However, thinking that he had merely redeveloped a method by Newton, Gregory never described how he obtained these series, and it can only be inferred that he understood the general method by examining scratch work he had scribbled on the back of another letter from 1671.

In 1691–1692, Isaac Newton wrote down an explicit statement of the Taylor and Maclaurin series in an unpublished version of his work &quot;De Quadratura Curvarum&quot;. However, this work was never completed and the relevant sections were omitted from the portions published in 1704 under the title &quot;Tractatus de Quadratura Curvarum&quot;.

It was not until 1715 that a general method for constructing these series for all functions for which they exist was finally published by Brook Taylor, after whom the series are now named.

The Maclaurin series was named after Colin Maclaurin, a Scottish mathematician, who published a special case of the Taylor result in the mid-18th century.

==Analytic functions==
If is given by a convergent power series in an open disk centred at in the complex plane (or an interval in the real line), it is said to be analytic in this region. Thus for in this region, is given by a convergent power series

formula_18

Differentiating by the above formula times, then setting gives:

formula_19

and so the power series expansion agrees with the Taylor series. Thus a function is analytic in an open disk centered at if and only if its Taylor series converges to the value of the function at each point of the disk.

If is equal to the sum of its Taylor series for all in the complex plane, it is called entire. The polynomials, exponential function , and the trigonometric functions sine and cosine, are examples of entire functions. Examples of functions that are not entire include the square root, the logarithm, the trigonometric function tangent, and its inverse, arctan. For these functions the Taylor series do not converge if is far from . That is, the Taylor series diverges at if the distance between and is larger than the radius of convergence. The Taylor series can be used to calculate the value of an entire function at every point, if the value of the function, and of all of its derivatives, are known at a single point.

Uses of the Taylor series for analytic functions include:
# The partial sums (the Taylor polynomials) of the series can be used as approximations of the function. These approximations are good if sufficiently many terms are included.
#Differentiation and integration of power series can be performed term by term and is hence particularly easy.
#An analytic function is uniquely extended to a holomorphic function on an open disk in the complex plane. This makes the machinery of complex analysis available.
#The (truncated) series can be used to compute function values numerically, (often by recasting the polynomial into the Chebyshev form and evaluating it with the Clenshaw algorithm).
#Algebraic operations can be done readily on the power series representation; for instance, Euler&#x27;s formula follows from Taylor series expansions for trigonometric and exponential functions. This result is of fundamental importance in such fields as harmonic analysis.
#Approximations using the first few terms of a Taylor series can make otherwise unsolvable problems possible for a restricted domain; this approach is often used in physics.

==Approximation error and convergence==

Pictured is an accurate approximation of around the point . The pink curve is a polynomial of degree seven:

formula_20

The error in this approximation is no more than . For a full cycle centered at the origin () the error is less than 0.08215. In particular, for , the error is less than 0.000003.

In contrast, also shown is a picture of the natural logarithm function and some of its Taylor polynomials around . These approximations converge to the function only in the region ; outside of this region the higher-degree Taylor polynomials are &quot;worse&quot; approximations for the function.

The &quot;error&quot; incurred in approximating a function by its th-degree Taylor polynomial is called the &quot;remainder&quot; or &quot;residual&quot; and is denoted by the function . Taylor&#x27;s theorem can be used to obtain a bound on the size of the remainder.

In general, Taylor series need not be convergent at all. In fact, the set of functions with a convergent Taylor series is a meager set in the Fréchet space of smooth functions. Even if the Taylor series of a function does converge, its limit need not be equal to the value of the function . For example, the function

formula_21

is infinitely differentiable at , and has all derivatives zero there. Consequently, the Taylor series of about is identically zero. However, is not the zero function, so does not equal its Taylor series around the origin. Thus, is an example of a non-analytic smooth function.

In real analysis, this example shows that there are infinitely differentiable functions whose Taylor series are &quot;not&quot; equal to even if they converge. By contrast, the holomorphic functions studied in complex analysis always possess a convergent Taylor series, and even the Taylor series of meromorphic functions, which might have singularities, never converge to a value different from the function itself. The complex function , however, does not approach 0 when approaches 0 along the imaginary axis, so it is not continuous in the complex plane and its Taylor series is undefined at 0.

More generally, every sequence of real or complex numbers can appear as coefficients in the Taylor series of an infinitely differentiable function defined on the real line, a consequence of Borel&#x27;s lemma. As a result, the radius of convergence of a Taylor series can be zero. There are even infinitely differentiable functions defined on the real line whose Taylor series have a radius of convergence 0 everywhere.

A function cannot be written as a Taylor series centred at a singularity; in these cases, one can often still achieve a series expansion if one allows also negative powers of the variable ; see Laurent series. For example, can be written as a Laurent series.

===Generalization===
The generalization of the Taylor series does converge to the value of the function itself for any bounded continuous function on , and this can be done by using the calculus of finite differences. Specifically, the following theorem, due to Einar Hille, that for any ,

formula_22

Here is the th finite difference operator with step size . The series is precisely the Taylor series, except that divided differences appear in place of differentiation: the series is formally similar to the Newton series. When the function is analytic at , the terms in the series converge to the terms of the Taylor series, and in this sense generalizes the usual Taylor series.

In general, for any infinite sequence , the following power series identity holds:

formula_23

So in particular,

formula_24

The series on the right is the expected value of , where is a Poisson-distributed random variable that takes the value with probability . Hence,

formula_25

The law of large numbers implies that the identity holds.

==List of Maclaurin series of some common functions==

Several important Maclaurin series expansions follow. All these expansions are valid for complex arguments .

=== Exponential function ===

The exponential function formula_26 (with base ) has Maclaurin series

formula_27
It converges for all .

The exponential generating function of the Bell numbers is the exponential function of the predecessor of the exponential function:

formula_28

=== Natural logarithm ===
The natural logarithm (with base ) has Maclaurin series

formula_29

The last series is known as Mercator series, named after Nicholas Mercator (since it was published in his 1668 treatise &quot;Logarithmotechnia&quot;). Both of these series converge for formula_30. (In addition, the series for converges for , and the series for converges for .)

=== Geometric series ===

The geometric series and its derivatives have Maclaurin series

formula_31

All are convergent for formula_30. These are special cases of the binomial series given in the next section.

=== Binomial series ===
The binomial series is the power series

formula_33

whose coefficients are the generalized binomial coefficients

formula_34

(If , this product is an empty product and has value 1.) It converges for formula_30 for any real or complex number .

When , this is essentially the infinite geometric series mentioned in the previous section. The special cases and give the square root function and its inverse:

formula_36

When only the linear term is retained, this simplifies to the binomial approximation.

=== Trigonometric functions ===
The usual trigonometric functions and their inverses have the following Maclaurin series:

formula_37

All angles are expressed in radians. The numbers appearing in the expansions of are the Bernoulli numbers. The in the expansion of are Euler numbers.

=== Hyperbolic functions ===
The hyperbolic functions have Maclaurin series closely related to the series for the corresponding trigonometric functions:

formula_38

The numbers appearing in the series for are the Bernoulli numbers.

=== Polylogarithmic functions ===
The polylogarithms have these defining identities:

formula_39

The Legendre chi functions are defined as follows:

formula_40

And the formulas presented below are called &quot;inverse tangent integrals&quot;:

formula_41

In statistical thermodynamics these formulas are of great importance.

=== Elliptic functions ===

The complete elliptic integrals of first kind K and of second kind E can be defined as follows:

formula_42

The Jacobi theta functions describe the world of the elliptic modular functions and they have these Taylor series:

formula_43

The regular partition number sequence P(n) has this generating function:

formula_44 

The strict partition number sequence Q(n) has that generating function:

formula_45

==Calculation of Taylor series==
Several methods exist for the calculation of Taylor series of a large number of functions. One can attempt to use the definition of the Taylor series, though this often requires generalizing the form of the coefficients according to a readily apparent pattern. Alternatively, one can use manipulations such as substitution, multiplication or division, addition or subtraction of standard Taylor series to construct the Taylor series of a function, by virtue of Taylor series being power series. In some cases, one can also derive the Taylor series by repeatedly applying integration by parts. Particularly convenient is the use of computer algebra systems to calculate Taylor series.

===First example===
In order to compute the 7th degree Maclaurin polynomial for the function

formula_46

one may first rewrite the function as

formula_47

the composition of two functions formula_48 and formula_49 The Taylor series for the natural logarithm is (using big O notation)

formula_50

and for the cosine function

formula_51

The first several terms from the second series can be substituted into each term of the first series. Because the first term in the second series has degree 2, three terms of the first series suffice to give a 7th-degree polynomial:

formula_52

Since the cosine is an even function, the coefficients for all the odd powers are zero.

===Second example===
Suppose we want the Taylor series at 0 of the function

formula_53

The Taylor series for the exponential function is

formula_54

and the series for cosine is

formula_55

Assume the series for their quotient is

formula_56

Multiplying both sides by the denominator formula_57 and then expanding it as a series yields

formula_58

Comparing the coefficients of formula_59 with the coefficients of formula_60

formula_61

The coefficients formula_62 of the series for formula_63 can thus be computed one at a time, amounting to long division of the series for formula_26 and 

formula_65

===Third example===
Here we employ a method called &quot;indirect expansion&quot; to expand the given function. This method uses the known Taylor expansion of the exponential function. In order to expand as a Taylor series in , we use the known Taylor series of function :

formula_66

Thus,

formula_67

==Taylor series as definitions==
Classically, algebraic functions are defined by an algebraic equation, and transcendental functions (including those discussed above) are defined by some property that holds for them, such as a differential equation. For example, the exponential function is the function which is equal to its own derivative everywhere, and assumes the value 1 at the origin. However, one may equally well define an analytic function by its Taylor series.

Taylor series are used to define functions and &quot;operators&quot; in diverse areas of mathematics. In particular, this is true in areas where the classical definitions of functions break down. For example, using Taylor series, one may extend analytic functions to sets of matrices and operators, such as the matrix exponential or matrix logarithm.

In other areas, such as formal analysis, it is more convenient to work directly with the power series themselves. Thus one may define a solution of a differential equation &quot;as&quot; a power series which, one hopes to prove, is the Taylor series of the desired solution.

==Taylor series in several variables==

The Taylor series may also be generalized to functions of more than one variable with

formula_68

For example, for a function formula_69 that depends on two variables, and , the Taylor series to second order about the point is

formula_70

where the subscripts denote the respective partial derivatives.

===Second-order Taylor series in several variables===
A second-order Taylor series expansion of a scalar-valued function of more than one variable can be written compactly as

formula_71

where is the gradient of evaluated at and is the Hessian matrix. Applying the multi-index notation the Taylor series for several variables becomes

formula_72

which is to be understood as a still more abbreviated multi-index version of the first equation of this paragraph, with a full analogy to the single variable case.

=== Example ===

In order to compute a second-order Taylor series expansion around point of the function
formula_73

one first computes all the necessary partial derivatives:

formula_74

Evaluating these derivatives at the origin gives the Taylor coefficients

formula_75

Substituting these values in to the general formula

formula_76

produces

formula_77

Since is analytic in , we have

formula_78

== Comparison with Fourier series ==

The trigonometric Fourier series enables one to express a periodic function (or a function defined on a closed interval ) as an infinite sum of trigonometric functions (sines and cosines). In this sense, the Fourier series is analogous to Taylor series, since the latter allows one to express a function as an infinite sum of powers. Nevertheless, the two series differ from each other in several relevant issues:
* The finite truncations of the Taylor series of about the point are all exactly equal to at . In contrast, the Fourier series is computed by integrating over an entire interval, so there is generally no such point where all the finite truncations of the series are exact.
* The computation of Taylor series requires the knowledge of the function on an arbitrary small neighbourhood of a point, whereas the computation of the Fourier series requires knowing the function on its whole domain interval. In a certain sense one could say that the Taylor series is &quot;local&quot; and the Fourier series is &quot;global&quot;.
* The Taylor series is defined for a function which has infinitely many derivatives at a single point, whereas the Fourier series is defined for any integrable function. In particular, the function could be nowhere differentiable. (For example, could be a Weierstrass function.)
* The convergence of both series has very different properties. Even if the Taylor series has positive convergence radius, the resulting series may not coincide with the function; but if the function is analytic then the series converges pointwise to the function, and uniformly on every compact subset of the convergence interval. Concerning the Fourier series, if the function is square-integrable then the series converges in quadratic mean, but additional requirements are needed to ensure the pointwise or uniform convergence (for instance, if the function is periodic and of class C1 then the convergence is uniform).
* Finally, in practice one wants to approximate the function with a finite number of terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively. In the case of the Taylor series the error is very small in a neighbourhood of the point where it is computed, while it may be very large at a distant point. In the case of the Fourier series the error is distributed along the domain of the function.

<text>TECO (), short for Text Editor &amp; Corrector,

 is both a character-oriented text editor and a programming language, that was developed in 1962 for use on Digital Equipment Corporation computers, and has since become available on PCs and Unix. Dan Murphy developed TECO while a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

According to Murphy, the initial acronym was Tape Editor and Corrector because &quot;punched paper tape was the only medium for the storage of program source on our PDP-1. There was no hard disk, floppy disk, magnetic tape (magtape), or network.&quot; By the time TECO was made available for general use, the name had become &quot;Text Editor and Corrector&quot;, since even the PDP-1 version
by then supported other media. It was subsequently modified by many other people and is a direct ancestor of Emacs, which was originally implemented in TECO macros.

==Description==
TECO is not only an editor but also an interpreted programming language for text manipulation. Arbitrary programs (called &quot;macros&quot;) for searching and modifying text give it great power. Unlike regular expressions, however, the language was imperative, though some versions had an &quot;or&quot; operator in string search.

TECO does not really have syntax; each character in a program is an imperative command, dispatched to its corresponding routine. That routine may read further characters from the program stream (giving the effect of string arguments), change the position of the &quot;program counter&quot; (giving the effect of control structures), or push values onto a value stack (giving the effect of nested parentheses). But there is nothing to prevent operations like jumping into the middle of a comment, since there is no syntax and no parsing.

TECO ignores case and whitespace (except tab, which is an insertion command).

A satirical essay on computer programming, &quot;Real Programmers Don&#x27;t Use Pascal&quot;, suggested that a common game for TECO fans was to enter their name as a command sequence, and then try to work out what would happen. The same essay in describing TECO coined the acronym &quot;YAFIYGI&quot;, meaning &quot;You Asked For It You Got It&quot; (in contrast to WYSIWYG).

==Impact==
The EMACS editor originally started by David A. Moon and Guy L. Steele Jr. was implemented in TECO as a set of Editor MACroS. TECO became more widely used following a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-6 implementation developed at MIT&#x27;s Project MAC in 1964. This implementation continuously displayed the edited text visually on a CRT screen, and was used as an interactive online editor. Later versions of TECO were capable of driving full-screen mode on various DEC RS-232 video terminals such as the VT52 or VT100.

TECO was available for several operating systems and computers, including the PDP-1 computer, the PDP-8 (under OS/8), the Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS) on the PDP-6 and PDP-10, and TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 on the PDP-10. A version of TECO was provided with all DEC operating systems; the version available for RT11 was able to drive the GT40 graphics display while the version available for RSTS/E was implemented as a multi-user run-time system and could be used as the user&#x27;s complete operating environment; the user never actually had to exit TECO. The VTEDIT (Video Terminal Editor) TECO macro was commonly used on RSTS/E and VAX systems with terminals capable of direct-cursor control (e.g. VT52 and VT100) to provide a full-screen visual editor similar in function to the contemporaneously developed Emacs.

TECO continues to be included in OpenVMS by VSI, and is invoked with the codice_1 command.

A descendant of the version DEC distributed for the PDP-10 is still available on the Internet, along with several partial implementations for the MS-DOS/Microsoft Windows environment.

==History==
TECO was originally developed at MIT in around 1963 by Daniel L. Murphy for use on two PDP-1 computers, belonging to different departments, both housed in MIT&#x27;s Building 26. On these machines, the normal development process involved the use of a Friden Flexowriter to prepare source code offline on a continuous strip of punched paper tape. Programmers of the big IBM mainframes customarily punched their source code on cards, using key punches which printed human-readable dot-matrix characters along the top of every card at the same time as they punched each machine-readable character. Thus IBM programmers could read, insert, delete, and move lines of code by physically manipulating the cards in the deck. Punched paper tape offered no such amenities, leading to the development of online editing.

An early editor for the PDP-1 was named &quot;Expensive Typewriter&quot;. Written by Stephen D. Piner, it was the most rudimentary imaginable line-oriented editor, lacking even search-and-replace capabilities. Its name was chosen as a wry poke at an earlier, rather bloated, editor called &quot;Colossal Typewriter&quot;. Even in those days, online editing could save time in the debugging cycle. Another program written by the PDP-1 hackers was Expensive Desk Calculator, in a similar vein.

The original stated purpose of TECO was to make more efficient use of the PDP-1. As envisioned in the manual, rather than performing editing &quot;expensively&quot; by sitting at a console, one would simply examine the faulty text and prepare a &quot;correction tape&quot; describing the editing operations to be performed on the text. One would efficiently feed the source tape and the correction tape into the PDP-1 via its high-speed (200 characters per second) reader. Running TECO, it immediately would punch an edited tape with its high-speed (60 characters per second) punch. One could then immediately proceed to load and run the assembler, with no time wasted in online editing.

TECO&#x27;s sophisticated searching operations were motivated by the fact that the offline Flexowriter printouts were not line-numbered. Editing locations therefore needed to be specified by context rather than by line number. The various looping and conditional constructs (which made TECO Turing-complete) were included in order to provide sufficient descriptive power for the correction tape. The terse syntax minimized the number of keystrokes needed to prepare the correction tape.

The correction tape was a program, and required debugging just like any other program. The pitfalls of even the simplest global search-and-replace soon became evident. In practice, TECO editing was performed online just as it had been with Expensive Typewriter (although TECO was certainly a more feature-complete editor than Expensive Typewriter, so editing was much more efficient with TECO). The original PDP-1 version had no screen display. The only way to observe the state of the text during the editing process was to type in commands that would cause the text (or portions thereof) to be typed out on the console typewriter.

By 1964, a special Version of TECO (&quot;TECO-6&quot;) had been implemented on the PDP-6 at MIT. That version supported visual editing, using a screen display that showed the contents of the editing buffer in real time, updating as it changed. Amongst the creators of TECO-6 were Richard Greenblatt and Stewart Nelson.

At MIT, TECO development continued in the fall of 1971. Carl Mikkelsen had implemented a real-time edit mode loosely based on the TECO-6 graphic console commands, but working with the newly installed Datapoint-3300 CRT text displays. The TECO buffer implementation, however, was terribly inefficient for processing single character insert or delete functions—editing consumed 100% of the PDP-10. With Richard Greenblatt&#x27;s support, in summer of 1972 Carl reimplemented the TECO buffer storage and reformed the macros as native PDP-10 code. As entering the real-time mode was by typing , this was known as control-R mode. At the same time, Rici Liknaitski added input-time macros (), which operated as the command string was read rather than when executed. Read-time macros made the TECO auxiliary text buffers, called Q-registers, more useful. Carl expanded the Q-register name space. With read-time macros, a large Q-register name space, and efficient buffer operations, the stage was set for binding each key to a macro. These edit macros evolved into Emacs.

The VMS implementation has a long history - it began as TECO-8, implemented in PDP-8 assembly. This code was translated into PDP-11 assembly to produce TECO-11. TECO-11 was used in early versions of VAX/VMS in PDP-11 compatibility mode. It was later translated from PDP-11 assembly into VAX assembly to produce TECO32. TECO32 was then converted with the VEST and AEST binary translation utilities to make it compatible with OpenVMS on the Alpha and Itanium respectively.

===OS/8 MUNG command===
The OS/8 CCL MUNG command invoked TECO to read and execute the specified .TE TECO macro. Optional command line parameters gave added adaptability.

==As a programmer&#x27;s tool==
During and shortly following the years of the punched card era, there were source programs that had begun as punched card-based. Comments were often a series of lines that included single marginal asterisks and top/bottom full lines of asterisks. Once the cards were transferred online, it was a chore to realign the marginal stars. TECO to the rescue...

==As a programming language==
The obscurity of the TECO programming language is described in the following quote from &quot;Real Programmers Don&#x27;t Use Pascal&quot;, a letter from Ed Post to Datamation, July 1983:

According to Craig Finseth, author of &quot;The Craft of Text Editing&quot;, TECO has been described as a &quot;write-only&quot; language, implying that once a program is written in TECO, it is extremely difficult to comprehend what it did without appropriate documentation.

Despite its syntax, the TECO command language was tremendously powerful, and clones are still available for MS-DOS and for Unix.

TECO commands are characters (including control-characters), and the prompt is a single asterisk:

The escape key displays as a dollar sign, pressed once it delineates the end of a command requiring an argument and pressed twice initiates the execution of the entered commands:

==Example code==
Given a file named hello.c with the following contents:

 int main(int argc, char **argv)
 printf(&quot;Hello world!\n&quot;);
 return 0;

one could use the following TECO session (noting that the prompt is &quot;*&quot; and &quot;$&quot; is how ESC is echoed) to change &quot;Hello&quot; into &quot;Goodbye&quot;:
*EBhello.c$$ Open file for read/write with backup
*P$$ Read in the first page
*SHello$0TT$$ Search for &quot;Hello&quot; and print the line (pointer placed after searched string)
 printf(&quot;Hello world!\n&quot;); The line
*-5DIGoodbye$0TT$$ Delete five characters before pointer (ie &quot;Hello&quot;), insert &quot;Goodbye&quot;, and print the line
 printf(&quot;Goodbye world!\n&quot;); The updated line
*EX$$ Copy the remainder of the file and exit
These two example programs are a simple interchange sort of the current text buffer, based on the 1st character of each line, taken from the PDP-11 TECO User&#x27;s Guide. A &quot;goto&quot; and &quot;structured&quot; version are shown. The second program originally had a bug that prevented the program terminating and the fixed version is used here instead.

===Example 1===
 !START! j 0aua ! jump to beginning, load 1st char in register A !
 !CONT! l 0aub ! load first char of next line in register B !
 qa-qb&quot;g xa k -l ga 1uz &#x27; ! if A&gt;B, switch lines and set flag in register Z !
 qbua ! load B into A !
 l z-.&quot;g -l @o/CONT/ &#x27; ! loop back if another line in buffer !
 qz&quot;g 0uz @o/START/ &#x27; ! repeat if a switch was made on last pass !

===Example 2===
 &lt;0uz ! clear repeat flag !
 j 0aua l ! load 1st char into register A !
 &lt;0aub ! load 1st char of next line into B !
 qa-qb&quot;g xa k -l ga -1uz &#x27; ! if A&gt;B, switch lines and set flag !
 qbua ! load B into A !
 l .-z;&gt; ! loop back if another line in buffer !
 qz;&gt; ! repeat if a switch was made last pass !

<text>In mathematics, a topological space is, roughly speaking, a geometrical space in which closeness is defined but cannot necessarily be measured by a numeric distance. More specifically, a topological space is a set whose elements are called points, along with an additional structure called a topology, which can be defined as a set of neighbourhoods for each point that satisfy some axioms formalizing the concept of closeness. There are several equivalent definitions of a topology, the most commonly used of which is the definition through open sets, which is easier than the others to manipulate.

A topological space is the most general type of a mathematical space that allows for the definition of limits, continuity, and connectedness. Common types of topological spaces include Euclidean spaces, metric spaces and manifolds.

Although very general, the concept of topological spaces is fundamental, and used in virtually every branch of modern mathematics. The study of topological spaces in their own right is called point-set topology or general topology.

== History ==
Around 1735, Leonhard Euler discovered the formula formula_1 relating the number of vertices (V), edges (E) and faces (F) of a convex polyhedron, and hence of a planar graph. The study and generalization of this formula, specifically by Cauchy (1789–1857) and L&#x27;Huilier (1750–1840), boosted the study of topology. In 1827, Carl Friedrich Gauss published &quot;General investigations of curved surfaces&quot;, which in section 3 defines the curved surface in a similar manner to the modern topological understanding: &quot;A curved surface is said to possess continuous curvature at one of its points A, if the direction of all the straight lines drawn from A to points of the surface at an infinitesimal distance from A are deflected infinitesimally from one and the same plane passing through A.&quot;

Yet, &quot;until Riemann&#x27;s work in the early 1850s, surfaces were always dealt with from a local point of view (as parametric surfaces) and topological issues were never considered&quot;. &quot;Möbius and Jordan seem to be the first to realize that the main problem about the topology of (compact) surfaces is to find invariants (preferably numerical) to decide the equivalence of surfaces, that is, to decide whether two surfaces are homeomorphic or not.&quot;

The subject is clearly defined by Felix Klein in his &quot;Erlangen Program&quot; (1872): the geometry invariants of arbitrary continuous transformation, a kind of geometry. The term &quot;topology&quot; was introduced by Johann Benedict Listing in 1847, although he had used the term in correspondence some years earlier instead of previously used &quot;Analysis situs&quot;. The foundation of this science, for a space of any dimension, was created by Henri Poincaré. His first article on this topic appeared in 1894. In the 1930s, James Waddell Alexander II and Hassler Whitney first expressed the idea that a surface is a topological space that is locally like a Euclidean plane.

Topological spaces were first defined by Felix Hausdorff in 1914 in his seminal &quot;Principles of Set Theory&quot;. Metric spaces had been defined earlier in 1906 by Maurice Fréchet, though it was Hausdorff who popularised the term &quot;metric space&quot; ().

== Definitions ==
The utility of the concept of a &quot;topology&quot; is shown by the fact that there are several equivalent definitions of this mathematical structure. Thus one chooses the axiomatization suited for the application. The most commonly used is that in terms of , but perhaps more intuitive is that in terms of and so this is given first.

=== Definition via neighbourhoods ===

This axiomatization is due to Felix Hausdorff.
Let formula_2 be a (possibly empty) set. The elements of formula_2 are usually called , though they can be any mathematical object. Let formula_4 be a function assigning to each formula_5 (point) in formula_2 a non-empty collection formula_7 of subsets of formula_8 The elements of formula_7 will be called of formula_5 with respect to formula_4 (or, simply, ). The function formula_4 is called a neighbourhood topology if the axioms below are satisfied; and then formula_2 with formula_4 is called a topological space.

# If formula_15 is a neighbourhood of formula_5 (i.e., formula_17), then formula_18 In other words, each point of the set formula_2 belongs to every one of its neighbourhoods with respect to formula_20.
# If formula_15 is a subset of formula_2 and includes a neighbourhood of formula_23 then formula_15 is a neighbourhood of formula_25 I.e., every superset of a neighbourhood of a point formula_26 is again a neighbourhood of formula_25
# The intersection of two neighbourhoods of formula_5 is a neighbourhood of formula_25
# Any neighbourhood formula_15 of formula_5 includes a neighbourhood formula_32 of formula_5 such that formula_15 is a neighbourhood of each point of formula_35

The first three axioms for neighbourhoods have a clear meaning. The fourth axiom has a very important use in the structure of the theory, that of linking together the neighbourhoods of different points of formula_8

A standard example of such a system of neighbourhoods is for the real line formula_37 where a subset formula_15 of formula_39 is defined to be a of a real number formula_5 if it includes an open interval containing formula_25

Given such a structure, a subset formula_42 of formula_2 is defined to be open if formula_42 is a neighbourhood of all points in formula_45 The open sets then satisfy the axioms given below in the next definition of a topological space. Conversely, when given the open sets of a topological space, the neighbourhoods satisfying the above axioms can be recovered by defining formula_15 to be a neighbourhood of formula_5 if formula_15 includes an open set formula_42 such that formula_50

=== Definition via open sets ===

A &quot;topology&quot; on a set may be defined as a collection formula_51 of subsets of , called open sets and satisfying the following axioms:

# The empty set and formula_2 itself belong to formula_53
# Any arbitrary (finite or infinite) union of members of formula_51 belongs to formula_53
# The intersection of any finite number of members of formula_51 belongs to formula_53

As this definition of a topology is the most commonly used, the set formula_51 of the open sets is commonly called a topology on formula_8 

A subset formula_60 is said to be in formula_61 if its complement formula_62 is an open set.

==== Examples of topologies ====

# Given formula_63 the trivial or topology on formula_2 is the family formula_65 consisting of only the two subsets of formula_2 required by the axioms forms a topology on formula_8
# Given formula_63 the family formula_69 of six subsets of formula_2 forms another topology of formula_8
# Given formula_63 the discrete topology on formula_2 is the power set of formula_74 which is the family formula_75 consisting of all possible subsets of formula_8 In this case the topological space formula_61 is called a &quot;discrete space&quot;.
# Given formula_78 the set of integers, the family formula_51 of all finite subsets of the integers plus formula_80 itself is a topology, because (for example) the union of all finite sets not containing zero is not finite and therefore not a member of the family of finite sets. The union of all finite sets not containing zero is also not all of formula_81 and so it cannot be in formula_53

=== Definition via closed sets ===
Using de Morgan&#x27;s laws, the above axioms defining open sets become axioms defining closed sets:

# The empty set and formula_2 are closed.
# The intersection of any collection of closed sets is also closed.
# The union of any finite number of closed sets is also closed.

Using these axioms, another way to define a topological space is as a set formula_2 together with a collection formula_51 of closed subsets of formula_8 Thus the sets in the topology formula_51 are the closed sets, and their complements in formula_2 are the open sets.

=== Other definitions ===
There are many other equivalent ways to define a topological space: in other words the concepts of neighbourhood, or that of open or closed sets can be reconstructed from other starting points and satisfy the correct axioms.

Another way to define a topological space is by using the Kuratowski closure axioms, which define the closed sets as the fixed points of an operator on the power set of formula_8

A net is a generalisation of the concept of sequence. A topology is completely determined if for every net in formula_2 the set of its accumulation points is specified.

== Comparison of topologies ==
Many topologies can be defined on a set to form a topological space. When every open set of a topology formula_91 is also open for a topology formula_92 one says that formula_93 is than formula_94 and formula_91 is than formula_96 A proof that relies only on the existence of certain open sets will also hold for any finer topology, and similarly a proof that relies only on certain sets not being open applies to any coarser topology. The terms and are sometimes used in place of finer and coarser, respectively. The terms and are also used in the literature, but with little agreement on the meaning, so one should always be sure of an author&#x27;s convention when reading.

The collection of all topologies on a given fixed set formula_2 forms a complete lattice: if formula_98 is a collection of topologies on formula_74 then the meet of formula_100 is the intersection of formula_101 and the join of formula_100 is the meet of the collection of all topologies on formula_2 that contain every member of formula_104

== Continuous functions ==
A function formula_105 between topological spaces is called continuous if for every formula_106 and every neighbourhood formula_15 of formula_108 there is a neighbourhood formula_32 of formula_5 such that formula_111 This relates easily to the usual definition in analysis. Equivalently, formula_112 is continuous if the inverse image of every open set is open. This is an attempt to capture the intuition that there are no &quot;jumps&quot; or &quot;separations&quot; in the function. A homeomorphism is a bijection that is continuous and whose inverse is also continuous. Two spaces are called if there exists a homeomorphism between them. From the standpoint of topology, homeomorphic spaces are essentially identical.

In category theory, one of the fundamental categories is Top, which denotes the category of topological spaces whose objects are topological spaces and whose morphisms are continuous functions. The attempt to classify the objects of this category (up to homeomorphism) by invariants has motivated areas of research, such as homotopy theory, homology theory, and K-theory.

== Examples of topological spaces ==

A given set may have many different topologies. If a set is given a different topology, it is viewed as a different topological space. Any set can be given the discrete topology in which every subset is open. The only convergent sequences or nets in this topology are those that are eventually constant. Also, any set can be given the trivial topology (also called the indiscrete topology), in which only the empty set and the whole space are open. Every sequence and net in this topology converges to every point of the space. This example shows that in general topological spaces, limits of sequences need not be unique. However, often topological spaces must be Hausdorff spaces where limit points are unique.

There exist numerous topologies on any given finite set. Such spaces are called finite topological spaces. Finite spaces are sometimes used to provide examples or counterexamples to conjectures about topological spaces in general.

Any set can be given the cofinite topology in which the open sets are the empty set and the sets whose complement is finite. This is the smallest T1 topology on any infinite set.

Any set can be given the cocountable topology, in which a set is defined as open if it is either empty or its complement is countable. When the set is uncountable, this topology serves as a counterexample in many situations.

The real line can also be given the lower limit topology. Here, the basic open sets are the half open intervals formula_113 This topology on formula_39 is strictly finer than the Euclidean topology defined above; a sequence converges to a point in this topology if and only if it converges from above in the Euclidean topology. This example shows that a set may have many distinct topologies defined on it.

If formula_115 is an ordinal number, then the set formula_116 may be endowed with the order topology generated by the intervals formula_117 formula_118 and formula_119 where formula_120 and formula_121 are elements of formula_122

Every manifold has a natural topology since it is locally Euclidean. Similarly, every simplex and every simplicial complex inherits a natural topology from .

The Sierpiński space is the simplest non-discrete topological space. It has important relations to the theory of computation and semantics.

=== Topology from other topologies ===

Every subset of a topological space can be given the subspace topology in which the open sets are the intersections of the open sets of the larger space with the subset. For any indexed family of topological spaces, the product can be given the product topology, which is generated by the inverse images of open sets of the factors under the projection mappings. For example, in finite products, a basis for the product topology consists of all products of open sets. For infinite products, there is the additional requirement that in a basic open set, all but finitely many of its projections are the entire space.

A quotient space is defined as follows: if formula_2 is a topological space and formula_124 is a set, and if formula_105 is a surjective function, then the quotient topology on formula_124 is the collection of subsets of formula_124 that have open inverse images under formula_128 In other words, the quotient topology is the finest topology on formula_124 for which formula_112 is continuous. A common example of a quotient topology is when an equivalence relation is defined on the topological space formula_8 The map formula_112 is then the natural projection onto the set of equivalence classes.

The Vietoris topology on the set of all non-empty subsets of a topological space formula_74 named for Leopold Vietoris, is generated by the following basis: for every formula_134-tuple formula_135 of open sets in formula_74 we construct a basis set consisting of all subsets of the union of the formula_137 that have non-empty intersections with each formula_138 

The Fell topology on the set of all non-empty closed subsets of a locally compact Polish space formula_2 is a variant of the Vietoris topology, and is named after mathematician James Fell. It is generated by the following basis: for every formula_134-tuple formula_135 of open sets in formula_2 and for every compact set formula_143 the set of all subsets of formula_2 that are disjoint from formula_145 and have nonempty intersections with each formula_137 is a member of the basis.

=== Metric spaces ===
Metric spaces embody a metric, a precise notion of distance between points.

Every metric space can be given a metric topology, in which the basic open sets are open balls defined by the metric. This is the standard topology on any normed vector space. On a finite-dimensional vector space this topology is the same for all norms.

There are many ways of defining a topology on formula_37 the set of real numbers. The standard topology on formula_39 is generated by the open intervals. The set of all open intervals forms a base or basis for the topology, meaning that every open set is a union of some collection of sets from the base. In particular, this means that a set is open if there exists an open interval of non zero radius about every point in the set. More generally, the Euclidean spaces formula_149 can be given a topology. In the usual topology on formula_149 the basic open sets are the open balls. Similarly, formula_151 the set of complex numbers, and formula_152 have a standard topology in which the basic open sets are open balls.

=== Topology from algebraic structure ===
For any algebraic objects we can introduce the discrete topology, under which the algebraic operations are continuous functions. For any such structure that is not finite, we often have a natural topology compatible with the algebraic operations, in the sense that the algebraic operations are still continuous. This leads to concepts such as topological groups, topological vector spaces, topological rings and local fields.

Any local field has a topology native to it, and this can be extended to vector spaces over that field.

The Zariski topology is defined algebraically on the spectrum of a ring or an algebraic variety. On formula_149 or formula_154 the closed sets of the Zariski topology are the solution sets of systems of polynomial equations.

=== Topological spaces with order structure ===
* Spectral: A space is &quot;spectral&quot; if and only if it is the prime spectrum of a ring (Hochster theorem).
* Specialization preorder: In a space the &quot;specialization preorder&quot; (or &quot;canonical preorder&quot;) is defined by formula_155 if and only if formula_156 where formula_157 denotes an operator satisfying the Kuratowski closure axioms.

=== Topology from other structure ===
If formula_158 is a filter on a set formula_2 then formula_160 is a topology on formula_8

Many sets of linear operators in functional analysis are endowed with topologies that are defined by specifying when a particular sequence of functions converges to the zero function.

A linear graph has a natural topology that generalizes many of the geometric aspects of graphs with vertices and edges.

Outer space of a free group formula_162 consists of the so-called &quot;marked metric graph structures&quot; of volume 1 on formula_163

== Classification of topological spaces ==

Topological spaces can be broadly classified, up to homeomorphism, by their topological properties. A topological property is a property of spaces that is invariant under homeomorphisms. To prove that two spaces are not homeomorphic it is sufficient to find a topological property not shared by them. Examples of such properties include connectedness, compactness, and various separation axioms. For algebraic invariants see algebraic topology.

<doc id="30456" wikidata="Q205001" url="?curid=30456" title="Talking Heads">
<text>Talking Heads were an American band formed in New York City during 1975. The band was composed of David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described as &quot;one of the most critically acclaimed groups of the &#x27;80s,&quot; Talking Heads helped to pioneer new wave music by combining elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with &quot;an anxious yet clean-cut image&quot;; they have been called &quot;a properly postmodernist band.&quot;

Byrne, Frantz, and Weymouth met as freshmen at the Rhode Island School of Design, where Byrne and Frantz were part of a band called the Artistics. The trio moved to New York City in 1975, adopted the name Talking Heads, joined the New York punk scene, and recruited Harrison to round out the band. Their debut album, &quot;Talking Heads: 77&quot;, was released in 1977 to positive reviews. They collaborated with the British producer Brian Eno on the acclaimed albums &quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food&quot; (1978), &quot;Fear of Music&quot; (1979), and &quot;Remain in Light&quot; (1980), which blended their art school sensibilities with influence from artists such as Parliament-Funkadelic and Fela Kuti. From the early 1980s, they included additional musicians in their recording sessions and shows, including guitarist Adrian Belew, keyboardist Bernie Worrell, singer Nona Hendryx, and bassist Busta Jones.

Talking Heads reached their commercial peak in 1983 with the U.S. Top 10 hit &quot;Burning Down the House&quot; from the album &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot;. In 1984, they released the concert film &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;, which was directed by Jonathan Demme. For these performances, they were joined by Worrell, guitarist Alex Weir, percussionist Steve Scales, and singers Lynn Mabry and Ednah Holt. In 1985, Talking Heads released their best-selling album, &quot;Little Creatures&quot;. They produced a soundtrack album for Byrne&#x27;s film &quot;True Stories&quot; (1986), and released their final album, the worldbeat-influenced &quot;Naked&quot; (1988), before disbanding in 1991. Without Byrne, the other band members performed under the name Shrunken Heads, and released an album, &quot;No Talking, Just Head&quot;, as the Heads in 1996.

In 2002, Talking Heads were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of their albums appeared on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2003 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, and three of their songs—&quot;Psycho Killer&quot;, &quot;Life During Wartime&quot;, and &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;—were included among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. The band also ranked number 64 on VH1&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. In the 2011 update of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;, they were ranked number 100.

==History==

=== 1973–1977: Early years ===

In 1973, Rhode Island School of Design students David Byrne (guitar and vocals) and Chris Frantz (drums) formed a band, the Artistics. Fellow student Tina Weymouth, Frantz&#x27;s girlfriend, often provided transportation. The Artistics dissolved the following year, and the three moved to New York City, eventually sharing a communal loft. After they were unable to find a bassist, Weymouth took up the role. Frantz encouraged Weymouth to learn to play bass by listening to Suzi Quatro albums. Byrne asked Weymouth to audition three times before she joined the band.
The band played their first gig as Talking Heads—opening for the Ramones at the CBGB club—on June 5, 1975. According to Weymouth, the name Talking Heads came from an issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot;, which &quot;explained the term used by TV studios to describe a head-and-shoulder shot of a person talking as &#x27;all content, no action&#x27;. It fit.&quot; Later that year, the band recorded a series of demos for CBS, but did not receive a record contract. However, they drew a following and signed to Sire Records in November 1976. They released their first single in February the following year, &quot;Love → Building on Fire&quot;. In March 1977, they added Jerry Harrison, formerly of Jonathan Richman&#x27;s band the Modern Lovers, on keyboards, guitar, and backing vocals. Gary Kurfirst started managing Talking Heads in 1977.

The first Talking Heads album, &quot;Talking Heads: 77&quot;, received acclaim and produced their first charting single, &quot;Psycho Killer&quot;. Many connected the song to the serial killer known as the Son of Sam, who had been terrorizing New York City months earlier; however, Byrne said he had written the song years prior. Weymouth and Frantz married in 1977.

===1978–1980: Collaborations with Brian Eno===

&quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food&quot; (1978) was Talking Heads&#x27; first collaboration with the producer Brian Eno, who had previously worked with Roxy Music, David Bowie, John Cale, and Robert Fripp; the title of Eno&#x27;s 1977 song &quot;King&#x27;s Lead Hat&quot; is an anagram of the band&#x27;s name. Eno&#x27;s unusual style meshed with the group&#x27;s artistic sensibilities, and they began to explore an increasingly diverse range of musical directions—from psychedelic funk to African music, influenced prominently by Fela Kuti and Parliament-Funkadelic. This recording also established the band&#x27;s relationship with Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas. &quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food&quot; included a cover of Al Green&#x27;s &quot;Take Me to the River&quot;, which brought Talking Heads into the public consciousness and gave them their first &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 30 hit.
The collaboration continued with &quot;Fear of Music&quot; (1979), which mixed the darker stylings of post-punk rock with white funkadelia and subliminal references to the geopolitical instability of the late 1970s. Music journalist Simon Reynolds cited &quot;Fear of Music&quot; as representing the Eno–Talking Heads collaboration &quot;at its most mutually fruitful and equitable&quot;. The single &quot;Life During Wartime&quot; produced the catchphrase &quot;This ain&#x27;t no party, this ain&#x27;t no disco&quot;. The song refers to the Mudd Club and CBGB, two popular New York nightclubs of the time.

&quot;Remain in Light&quot; (1980) was heavily influenced by the Afrobeat of Nigerian bandleader Fela Kuti, whose music had been introduced to the band by Eno. It explored West African polyrhythms, weaving these together with Arabic music from North Africa, disco funk, and &quot;found&quot; voices. These combinations foreshadowed Byrne&#x27;s later interest in world music. To perform these more complex arrangements, the band toured with an expanded group, including Adrian Belew and Bernie Worrell, among others, first at the Heatwave festival in August, and later in their concert film &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;.

During this period, Weymouth and Frantz formed a commercially successful splinter group, Tom Tom Club, influenced by the foundational elements of hip hop, and Harrison released his first solo album, &quot;The Red and the Black&quot;. Byrne and Eno released &quot;My Life in the Bush of Ghosts&quot;, which incorporated world music, found sounds and a number of other prominent international and post-punk musicians.
&quot;Remain in Light&quot;″s lead single, &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;, became a Top 20 hit in the UK, but initially failed to make an impression in the US. It grew into a popular standard over the next few years on the strength of its music video, which &quot;Time&quot; named one of the greatest of all time.

===1981–1991: Commercial peak and breakup===

After releasing four albums in barely four years, the group went on a recording hiatus, and nearly three years passed before their next release, although Frantz and Weymouth continued to record with Tom Tom Club. In the meantime, Talking Heads released the live album &quot;The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads&quot;, toured the United States and Europe as an eight-piece group, and parted ways with Eno, who went on to produce albums with U2.

1983 saw the release of &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot;, a commercial breakthrough that produced the band&#x27;s only American Top 10 hit, &quot;Burning Down the House&quot;. Once again, a striking video was inescapable, owing to its heavy rotation on MTV. The following tour was documented in Jonathan Demme&#x27;s &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;, which generated another live album of the same name. The tour in support of &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; was their last.
Three more albums followed: 1985&#x27;s &quot;Little Creatures&quot; (which featured the hit singles &quot;And She Was&quot; and &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot;), 1986&#x27;s &quot;True Stories&quot; (Talking Heads covering all the soundtrack songs of Byrne&#x27;s musical comedy film, in which the band also appeared), and 1988&#x27;s &quot;Naked&quot;. &quot;Little Creatures&quot; offered a much more American pop-rock sound as opposed to previous efforts. Similar in genre, &quot;True Stories&quot; hatched one of the group&#x27;s most successful hits, &quot;Wild Wild Life&quot;, and the accordion-driven track &quot;Radio Head&quot;. &quot;Naked&quot; explored politics, sex, and death, and showed heavy African influence with polyrhythmic styles like those seen on &quot;Remain in Light&quot;. During that time, the group was falling increasingly under David Byrne&#x27;s control, and after &quot;Naked&quot;, the band went on &quot;hiatus&quot;. In 1987, Talking Heads released a book by David Byrne, &quot;What the Songs Look Like: Contemporary Artists Interpret Talking Heads Songs&quot;, with HarperCollins that contained artwork by some of the top New York visual artists of the decade.
In December 1991, Talking Heads announced that they had disbanded. Frantz said he learned that Byrne had left from an article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and said: &quot;As far as we&#x27;re concerned, the band never really broke up. David just decided to leave.&quot; Their final release was &quot;Sax and Violins&quot;, an original song that had appeared earlier that year on the soundtrack to Wim Wenders&#x27; &quot;Until the end of the World&quot;. Byrne continued his solo career, releasing &quot;Rei Momo&quot; in 1989 and &quot;The Forest&quot; in 1991. This period also saw a revived flourish from both Tom Tom Club (&quot;Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom&quot; and &quot;Dark Sneak Love Action&quot;) and Harrison (&quot;Casual Gods&quot; and &quot;Walk on Water&quot;), who toured together in 1990.

===1992–present: Post-breakup and reunions===
Weymouth, Frantz, and Harrison toured without Byrne as Shrunken Heads in the early 1990s. In 1996, they released an album, &quot;No Talking, Just Head&quot;, under the name the Heads. The album featured a number of vocalists, including Gavin Friday of the Virgin Prunes, Debbie Harry of Blondie, Johnette Napolitano of Concrete Blonde, Andy Partridge of XTC, Gordon Gano of Violent Femmes, Michael Hutchence of INXS, Ed Kowalczyk of Live, Shaun Ryder of Happy Mondays, Richard Hell, and Maria McKee. It was accompanied by a tour with Napolitano as the vocalist. Byrne took legal action to prevent the band using the name the Heads, which he saw as &quot;a pretty obvious attempt to cash in on the Talking Heads name&quot;. The band briefly reunited in 1999 to promote the 15th anniversary re-release of &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;, but did not perform together.

Harrison produced records such as the Violent Femmes&#x27; &quot;The Blind Leading the Naked;&quot; the Fine Young Cannibals&#x27; &quot;The Raw and the Cooked;&quot; General Public&#x27;s &quot;Rub It Better;&quot; Crash Test Dummies&#x27; &quot;God Shuffled His Feet;&quot; Live&#x27;s &quot;Mental Jewelry&quot;, &quot;Throwing Copper&quot;, and &quot;The Distance to Here;&quot; and No Doubt&#x27;s song &quot;New&quot; from &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;. Frantz and Weymouth have produced for several artists, including Happy Mondays and Ziggy Marley. Tom Tom Club continues to record and tour intermittently.
Talking Heads reunited to play &quot;Life During Wartime&quot;, &quot;Psycho Killer&quot;, and &quot;Burning Down the House&quot; on March 18, 2002, at the ceremony of their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, joined onstage by former touring members Bernie Worrell and Steve Scales. Byrne said further work together was unlikely, due to &quot;bad blood&quot; and being musically &quot;miles apart&quot;. Weymouth has been critical of Byrne, describing him as &quot;a man incapable of returning friendship&quot; and saying that he did not &quot;love&quot; her, Frantz, and Harrison. In 2020, Frantz published a memoir about his relationship with Weymouth, &quot;Remain in Love&quot;, which covered the band&#x27;s conflicts.

In September 2023, &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; was re-released in IMAX with remastered sound and picture to coincide with the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary. The band members reunited that month for a Q&amp;A at the Toronto International Film Festival, following limited showings of the film in theaters, and gave subsequent interviews together to promote the re-release. With regard to the possibility of a reunion tour, Harrison told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;: &quot;Right now, we&#x27;re concentrating on &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; and how much fun we&#x27;re having revisiting the film. We&#x27;re living in the moment, so that&#x27;s all we&#x27;re thinking about.&quot; In January 2024, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that Talking Heads had turned down an $80 million offer for a reunion tour, which would have included a performance at Coachella.

==Musical style==
AllMusic stated that Talking Heads, one of the most celebrated bands of the 1970s and 1980s, by the time of their breakup &quot;had recorded everything from art-funk to polyrhythmic worldbeat explorations and simple, melodic guitar pop&quot;. In &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Andy Cush described the band as &quot;New York art-punks&quot; whose &quot;blend of nervy postmodernism and undeniable groove made them one of the defining rock bands of the late 1970s and ’80s.&quot; Media theorist Dick Hebdige said the group &quot;draw eclectically on a wide range of visual and aural sources to create a distinctive pastiche or hybrid &#x27;house style&#x27; which they have used since their formation in the mid-1970s deliberately to stretch received (industrial) definitions of what rock/pop/video/Art/ performance/audience are&quot;, calling them &quot;a properly postmodernist band.&quot; Talking Heads&#x27; art pop innovations have had a long-lasting impact. Along with other groups such as Devo, Ramones, and Blondie, they helped define the new wave genre in the United States. Meanwhile, their more cosmopolitan hits like 1980&#x27;s &quot;Remain in Light&quot; helped bring African rock to the Western world.

==Legacy and influence==
Talking Heads have been cited as an influence by many artists, including Nelly Furtado, Eddie Vedder, LCD Soundsystem, Foals, the Weeknd, Primus, Bell X1, the 1975, Kesha, St. Vincent, Danny Brown, Trent Reznor, Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos, and Radio 4. Radiohead took their name from the 1986 Talking Heads song &quot;Radio Head&quot;, and cited &quot;Remain in Light&quot; as a critical influence on their 2000 album &quot;Kid A&quot;. Italian filmmaker and director Paolo Sorrentino, receiving the Oscar for his film &quot;La Grande Bellezza&quot; in 2014, thanked Talking Heads, among others, as his sources of inspiration.

<text>Transfinite induction is an extension of mathematical induction to well-ordered sets, for example to sets of ordinal numbers or cardinal numbers. Its correctness is a theorem of ZFC.

==Induction by cases==
Let formula_1 be a property defined for all ordinals formula_2. Suppose that whenever formula_3 is true for all formula_4, then formula_1 is also true. Then transfinite induction tells us that formula_6 is true for all ordinals.

Usually the proof is broken down into three cases:

* Zero case: Prove that formula_7 is true.
* Successor case: Prove that for any successor ordinal formula_8, formula_9 follows from formula_1 (and, if necessary, formula_3 for all formula_4).
* Limit case: Prove that for any limit ordinal formula_13, if formula_3 holds for all formula_15, then formula_16.

All three cases are identical except for the type of ordinal considered. They do not formally need to be considered separately, but in practice the proofs are typically so different as to require separate presentations. Zero is sometimes considered a limit ordinal and then may sometimes be treated in proofs in the same case as limit ordinals.

==Transfinite recursion==
Transfinite recursion is similar to transfinite induction; however, instead of proving that something holds for all ordinal numbers, we construct a sequence of objects, one for each ordinal.

As an example, a basis for a (possibly infinite-dimensional) vector space can be created by starting with the empty set and for each ordinal &quot;α &gt; 0&quot; choosing a vector that is not in the span of the vectors formula_17. This process stops when no vector can be chosen.

More formally, we can state the Transfinite Recursion Theorem as follows:

Transfinite Recursion Theorem (version 1). Given a class function &quot;G&quot;: &quot;V&quot; → &quot;V&quot; (where &quot;V&quot; is the class of all sets), there exists a unique transfinite sequence &quot;F&quot;: Ord → &quot;V&quot; (where Ord is the class of all ordinals) such that
:formula_18 for all ordinals &quot;α&quot;, where formula_19 denotes the restriction of &quot;F&quot;&#x27;s domain to ordinals &lt;&quot;α&quot;.

As in the case of induction, we may treat different types of ordinals separately: another formulation of transfinite recursion is the following:

Transfinite Recursion Theorem (version 2). Given a set &quot;g&quot;1, and class functions &quot;G&quot;2, &quot;G&quot;3, there exists a unique function &quot;F&quot;: Ord → &quot;V&quot; such that
* &quot;F&quot;(0) = &quot;g&quot;1,
* &quot;F&quot;(&quot;α&quot; + 1) = &quot;G&quot;2(&quot;F&quot;(&quot;α&quot;)), for all &quot;α&quot; ∈ Ord,
* formula_20, for all limit &quot;λ&quot; ≠ 0.

Note that we require the domains of &quot;G&quot;2, &quot;G&quot;3 to be broad enough to make the above properties meaningful. The uniqueness of the sequence satisfying these properties can be proved using transfinite induction.

More generally, one can define objects by transfinite recursion on any well-founded relation &quot;R&quot;. (&quot;R&quot; need not even be a set; it can be a proper class, provided it is a set-like relation; i.e. for any &quot;x&quot;, the collection of all &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;yRx&quot; is a set.)

==Relationship to the axiom of choice==
Proofs or constructions using induction and recursion often use the axiom of choice to produce a well-ordered relation that can be treated by transfinite induction. However, if the relation in question is already well-ordered, one can often use transfinite induction without invoking the axiom of choice. For example, many results about Borel sets are proved by transfinite induction on the ordinal rank of the set; these ranks are already well-ordered, so the axiom of choice is not needed to well-order them.

The following construction of the Vitali set shows one way that the axiom of choice can be used in a proof by transfinite induction:
: First, well-order the real numbers (this is where the axiom of choice enters via the well-ordering theorem), giving a sequence formula_21, where β is an ordinal with the cardinality of the continuum. Let &quot;v&quot;0 equal &quot;r&quot;0. Then let &quot;v&quot;1 equal &quot;r&quot;&quot;α&quot;1, where &quot;α&quot;1 is least such that &quot;r&quot;&quot;α&quot;1 − &quot;v&quot;0 is not a rational number. Continue; at each step use the least real from the &quot;r&quot; sequence that does not have a rational difference with any element thus far constructed in the &quot;v&quot; sequence. Continue until all the reals in the &quot;r&quot; sequence are exhausted. The final &quot;v&quot; sequence will enumerate the Vitali set.
The above argument uses the axiom of choice in an essential way at the very beginning, in order to well-order the reals. After that step, the axiom of choice is not used again.

Other uses of the axiom of choice are more subtle. For example, a construction by transfinite recursion frequently will not specify a &quot;unique&quot; value for &quot;A&quot;&quot;α&quot;+1, given the sequence up to &quot;α&quot;, but will specify only a &quot;condition&quot; that &quot;A&quot;&quot;α&quot;+1 must satisfy, and argue that there is at least one set satisfying this condition. If it is not possible to define a unique example of such a set at each stage, then it may be necessary to invoke (some form of) the axiom of choice to select one such at each step. For inductions and recursions of countable length, the weaker axiom of dependent choice is sufficient. Because there are models of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory of interest to set theorists that satisfy the axiom of dependent choice but not the full axiom of choice, the knowledge that a particular proof only requires dependent choice can be useful.

<doc id="30462" wikidata="Q106410" url="?curid=30462" title="Triple point">
<text>In thermodynamics, the triple point of a substance is the temperature and pressure at which the three phases (gas, liquid, and solid) of that substance coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium. It is that temperature and pressure at which the sublimation, fusion, and vaporisation curves meet. For example, the triple point of mercury occurs at a temperature of and a pressure of 0.165 mPa.

In addition to the triple point for solid, liquid, and gas phases, a triple point may involve more than one solid phase, for substances with multiple polymorphs. Helium-4 is unusual in that it has no sublimation/deposition curve and therefore no triple points where its solid phase meets its gas phase. Instead, it has a vapor-liquid-superfluid point, a solid-liquid-superfluid point, a solid-solid-liquid point, and a solid-solid-superfluid point. None of these should be confused with the Lambda Point, which is not any kind of triple point.

The term &quot;triple point&quot; was coined in 1873 by James Thomson, brother of Lord Kelvin. The triple points of several substances are used to define points in the ITS-90 international temperature scale, ranging from the triple point of hydrogen (13.8033 K) to the triple point of water (273.16 K, 0.01 °C, or 32.018 °F).

Before 2019, the triple point of water was used to define the kelvin, the base unit of thermodynamic temperature in the International System of Units (SI). The kelvin was defined so that the triple point of water is exactly 273.16 K, but that changed with the 2019 revision of the SI, where the kelvin was redefined so that the Boltzmann constant is exactly , and the triple point of water became an experimentally measured constant.

== Triple point of water ==

=== Gas–liquid–solid triple point ===

Following the 2019 revision of the SI, the value of the triple point of water is no longer used as a defining point. However, its empirical value remains important: the unique combination of pressure and temperature at which liquid water, solid ice, and water vapor coexist in a stable equilibrium is approximately and a vapor pressure of .

Liquid water can only exist at pressures equal to or greater than the triple point. Below this, in the vacuum of outer space, solid ice sublimates, transitioning directly into water vapor when heated at a constant pressure. Conversely, above the triple point, solid ice first melts into liquid water upon heating at a constant pressure, then evaporates or boils to form vapor at a higher temperature.

For most substances, the gas–liquid–solid triple point is the minimum temperature where the liquid can exist. For water, this is not the case. The melting point of ordinary ice decreases with pressure, as shown by the phase diagram&#x27;s dashed green line. Just below the triple point, compression at a constant temperature transforms water vapor first to solid and then to liquid.

Historically, during the Mariner 9 mission to Mars, the triple point pressure of water was used to define &quot;sea level&quot;. Now, laser altimetry and gravitational measurements are preferred to define Martian elevation.

=== High-pressure phases ===
At high pressures, water has a complex phase diagram with 15 known phases of ice and several triple points, including 10 whose coordinates are shown in the diagram. For example, the triple point at 251 K (−22 °C) and 210 MPa (2070 atm) corresponds to the conditions for the coexistence of ice Ih (ordinary ice), ice III and liquid water, all at equilibrium. There are also triple points for the coexistence of three solid phases, for example ice II, ice V and ice VI at 218 K (−55 °C) and 620 MPa (6120 atm).

For those high-pressure forms of ice which can exist in equilibrium with liquid, the diagram shows that melting points increase with pressure. At temperatures above 273 K (0 °C), increasing the pressure on water vapor results first in liquid water and then a high-pressure form of ice. In the range , ice I is formed first, followed by liquid water and then ice III or ice V, followed by other still denser high-pressure forms.


== Triple-point cells ==
Triple-point cells are used in the calibration of thermometers. For exacting work, triple-point cells are typically filled with a highly pure chemical substance such as hydrogen, argon, mercury, or water (depending on the desired temperature). The purity of these substances can be such that only one part in a million is a contaminant, called &quot;six nines&quot; because it is 99.9999% pure. A specific isotopic composition (for water, VSMOW) is used because variations in isotopic composition cause small changes in the triple point. Triple-point cells are so effective at achieving highly precise, reproducible temperatures, that an international calibration standard for thermometers called ITS–90 relies upon triple-point cells of hydrogen, neon, oxygen, argon, mercury, and water for delineating six of its defined temperature points.

Notes:
* For comparison, typical atmospheric pressure is 101.325 kPa (1 atm).
* Before the new definition of SI units, water&#x27;s triple point, 273.16 K, was an exact number.

<text>In biology, taxonomy () is the scientific study of naming, defining (circumscribing) and classifying groups of biological organisms based on shared characteristics. Organisms are grouped into taxa (singular: taxon), and these groups are given a taxonomic rank; groups of a given rank can be aggregated to form a more inclusive group of higher rank, thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy. The principal ranks in modern use are domain, kingdom, phylum (&quot;division&quot; is sometimes used in botany in place of &quot;phylum&quot;), class, order, family, genus, and species. The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus is regarded as the founder of the current system of taxonomy, as he developed a ranked system known as Linnaean taxonomy for categorizing organisms.

With advances in the theory, data and analytical technology of biological systematics, the Linnaean system has transformed into a system of modern biological classification intended to reflect the evolutionary relationships among organisms, both living and extinct.

== Definition ==
The exact definition of taxonomy varies from source to source, but the core of the discipline remains: the conception, naming, and classification of groups of organisms. As points of reference, recent definitions of taxonomy are presented below:

# Theory and practice of grouping individuals into species, arranging species into larger groups, and giving those groups names, thus producing a classification.
# A field of science (and a major component of systematics) that encompasses description, identification, nomenclature, and classification
# The science of classification, in biology the arrangement of organisms into a classification
# &quot;The science of classification as applied to living organisms, including the study of means of formation of species, etc.&quot;
# &quot;The analysis of an organism&#x27;s characteristics for the purpose of classification&quot;
# &quot;Systematics studies phylogeny to provide a pattern that can be translated into the classification and names of the more inclusive field of taxonomy&quot; (listed as a desirable but unusual definition)

The varied definitions either place taxonomy as a sub-area of systematics (definition 2), invert that relationship (definition 6), or appear to consider the two terms synonymous. There is some disagreement as to whether biological nomenclature is considered a part of taxonomy (definitions 1 and 2), or a part of systematics outside taxonomy. For example, definition 6 is paired with the following definition of systematics that places nomenclature outside taxonomy:
* &quot;Systematics&quot;: &quot;The study of the identification, taxonomy, and nomenclature of organisms, including the classification of living things with regard to their natural relationships and the study of variation and the evolution of taxa&quot;.

In 1970, Michener &quot;et al.&quot; defined &quot;systematic biology&quot; and &quot;taxonomy&quot; in relation to one another as follows:

Systematic biology (hereafter called simply systematics) is the field that
*(a) provides scientific names for organisms,
*(b) describes them,
*(c) preserves collections of them,
*(d) provides classifications for the organisms, keys for their identification, and data on their distributions,
*(e) investigates their evolutionary histories, and
*(f) considers their environmental adaptations.
This is a field with a long history that in recent years has experienced a notable renaissance, principally with respect to theoretical content. Part of the theoretical material has to do with evolutionary areas (topics e and f above), the rest relates especially to the problem of classification. Taxonomy is that part of Systematics concerned with topics (a) to (d) above.
A whole set of terms including taxonomy, systematic biology, systematics, scientific classification, biological classification, and phylogenetics have at times had overlapping meanings – sometimes the same, sometimes slightly different, but always related and intersecting. The broadest meaning of &quot;taxonomy&quot; is used here. The term itself was introduced in 1813 by de Candolle, in his &quot;Théorie élémentaire de la botanique&quot;. John Lindley provided an early definition of systematics in 1830, although he wrote of &quot;systematic botany&quot; rather than using the term &quot;systematics&quot;. Europeans tend to use the terms &quot;systematics&quot; and &quot;biosystematics&quot; for the study of biodiversity as a whole, whereas North Americans tend to use &quot;taxonomy&quot; more frequently. However, taxonomy, and in particular alpha taxonomy, is more specifically the identification, description, and naming (i.e., nomenclature) of organisms, while &quot;classification&quot; focuses on placing organisms within hierarchical groups that show their relationships to other organisms.

=== Monograph and taxonomic revision ===
A taxonomic revision or taxonomic review is a novel analysis of the variation patterns in a particular taxon. This analysis may be executed on the basis of any combination of the various available kinds of characters, such as morphological, anatomical, palynological, biochemical and genetic. A monograph or complete revision is a revision that is comprehensive for a taxon for the information given at a particular time, and for the entire world. Other (partial) revisions may be restricted in the sense that they may only use some of the available character sets or have a limited spatial scope. A revision results in a conformation of or new insights in the relationships between the subtaxa within the taxon under study, which may lead to a change in the classification of these subtaxa, the identification of new subtaxa, or the merger of previous subtaxa.

=== Taxonomic characters ===
Taxonomic characters are the taxonomic attributes that can be used to provide the evidence from which relationships (the phylogeny) between taxa are inferred. Kinds of taxonomic characters include:

* Morphological characters
** General external morphology
** Special structures (e.g., genitalia)
** Internal morphology (anatomy)
** Embryology
** Karyology and other cytological factors
* Physiological characters
** Metabolic factors
** Body secretions
** Genic sterility factors
* Molecular characters
** Immunological distance
** Electrophoretic differences
** Amino acid sequences of proteins
** DNA hybridization
** DNA and RNA sequences
** Restriction endonuclease analyses
** Other molecular differences
* Behavioral characters
** Courtship and other ethological isolating mechanisms
** Other behavior patterns
* Ecological characters
** Habit and habitats
** Food
** Seasonal variations
** Parasites and hosts
* Geographic characters
** General biogeographic distribution patterns
** Sympatric-allopatric relationship of populations
=== Alpha and beta taxonomy ===

The term &quot;alpha taxonomy&quot; is primarily used to refer to the discipline of finding, describing, and naming taxa, particularly species. In earlier literature, the term had a different meaning, referring to morphological taxonomy, and the products of research through the end of the 19th century.

William Bertram Turrill introduced the term &quot;alpha taxonomy&quot; in a series of papers published in 1935 and 1937 in which he discussed the philosophy and possible future directions of the discipline of taxonomy. ... there is an increasing desire amongst taxonomists to consider their problems from wider viewpoints, to investigate the possibilities of closer co-operation with their cytological, ecological and genetics colleagues and to acknowledge that some revision or expansion, perhaps of a drastic nature, of their aims and methods, may be desirable ... Turrill (1935) has suggested that while accepting the older invaluable taxonomy, based on structure, and conveniently designated &quot;alpha&quot;, it is possible to glimpse a far-distant taxonomy built upon as wide a basis of morphological and physiological facts as possible, and one in which &quot;place is found for all observational and experimental data relating, even if indirectly, to the constitution, subdivision, origin, and behaviour of species and other taxonomic groups&quot;. Ideals can, it may be said, never be completely realized. They have, however, a great value of acting as permanent stimulants, and if we have some, even vague, ideal of an &quot;omega&quot; taxonomy we may progress a little way down the Greek alphabet. Some of us please ourselves by thinking we are now groping in a &quot;beta&quot; taxonomy.

Turrill thus explicitly excludes from alpha taxonomy various areas of study that he includes within taxonomy as a whole, such as ecology, physiology, genetics, and cytology. He further excludes phylogenetic reconstruction from alpha taxonomy.

Later authors have used the term in a different sense, to mean the delimitation of species (not subspecies or taxa of other ranks), using whatever investigative techniques are available, and including sophisticated computational or laboratory techniques. Thus, Ernst Mayr in 1968 defined &quot;beta taxonomy&quot; as the classification of ranks higher than species.An understanding of the biological meaning of variation and of the evolutionary origin of groups of related species is even more important for the second stage of taxonomic activity, the sorting of species into groups of relatives (&quot;taxa&quot;) and their arrangement in a hierarchy of higher categories. This activity is what the term classification denotes; it is also referred to as &quot;beta taxonomy&quot;.

=== Microtaxonomy and macrotaxonomy ===

How species should be defined in a particular group of organisms gives rise to practical and theoretical problems that are referred to as the species problem. The scientific work of deciding how to define species has been called microtaxonomy. By extension, macrotaxonomy is the study of groups at the higher taxonomic ranks subgenus and above, or simply in clades that include more than one taxon considered a species, expressed in terms of phylogenetic nomenclature.

== History ==
While some descriptions of taxonomic history attempt to date taxonomy to ancient civilizations, a truly scientific attempt to classify organisms did not occur until the 18th century, with the possible exception of Aristotle, whose works hint at a taxonomy. Earlier works were primarily descriptive and focused on plants that were useful in agriculture or medicine. 

There are a number of stages in this scientific thinking. Early taxonomy was based on arbitrary criteria, the so-called &quot;artificial systems&quot;, including Linnaeus&#x27;s system of sexual classification for plants (Linnaeus&#x27;s 1735 classification of animals was entitled &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; (&quot;the System of Nature&quot;), implying that he, at least, believed that it was more than an &quot;artificial system&quot;). 

Later came systems based on a more complete consideration of the characteristics of taxa, referred to as &quot;natural systems&quot;, such as those of de Jussieu (1789), de Candolle (1813) and Bentham and Hooker (1862–1863). These classifications described empirical patterns and were pre-evolutionary in thinking. 

The publication of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859) led to a new explanation for classifications, based on evolutionary relationships. This was the concept of phyletic systems, from 1883 onwards. This approach was typified by those of Eichler (1883) and Engler (1886–1892). 

The advent of cladistic methodology in the 1970s led to classifications based on the sole criterion of monophyly, supported by the presence of synapomorphies. Since then, the evidentiary basis has been expanded with data from molecular genetics that for the most part complements traditional morphology.

=== Pre-Linnaean ===

==== Early taxonomists ====
Naming and classifying human surroundings likely began with the onset of language. Distinguishing poisonous plants from edible plants is integral to the survival of human communities. Medicinal plant illustrations show up in Egyptian wall paintings from , indicating that the uses of different species were understood and that a basic taxonomy was in place.

==== Ancient times ====

Organisms were first classified by Aristotle (Greece, 384–322 BC) during his stay on the island of Lesbos. He classified beings by their parts, or in modern terms &quot;attributes&quot;, such as having live birth, having four legs, laying eggs, having blood, or being warm-bodied. He divided all living things into two groups: plants and animals. 

Some of his groups of animals, such as &quot;Anhaima&quot; (animals without blood, translated as invertebrates) and &quot;Enhaima&quot; (animals with blood, roughly the vertebrates), as well as groups like the sharks and cetaceans, are commonly used.

His student Theophrastus (Greece, 370–285 BC) carried on this tradition, mentioning some 500 plants and their uses in his &quot;Historia Plantarum&quot;. Several plant genera can be traced back to Theophrastus, such as &quot;Cornus&quot;, &quot;Crocus&quot;, and &quot;Narcissus&quot;.

==== Medieval ====
Taxonomy in the Middle Ages was largely based on the Aristotelian system, with additions concerning the philosophical and existential order of creatures. This included concepts such as the great chain of being in the Western scholastic tradition, again deriving ultimately from Aristotle. 

The Aristotelian system did not classify plants or fungi, due to the lack of microscopes at the time, as his ideas were based on arranging the complete world in a single continuum, as per the &quot;scala naturae&quot; (the Natural Ladder). This, as well, was taken into consideration in the great chain of being. 

Advances were made by scholars such as Procopius, Timotheus of Gaza, Demetrios Pepagomenos, and Thomas Aquinas. Medieval thinkers used abstract philosophical and logical categorizations more suited to abstract philosophy than to pragmatic taxonomy.

==== Renaissance and early modern ====

During the Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment, categorizing organisms became more prevalent,
and taxonomic works became ambitious enough to replace the ancient texts. This is sometimes credited to the development of sophisticated optical lenses, which allowed the morphology of organisms to be studied in much greater detail. 

One of the earliest authors to take advantage of this leap in technology was the Italian physician Andrea Cesalpino (1519–1603), who has been called &quot;the first taxonomist&quot;. His magnum opus &quot;De Plantis&quot; came out in 1583, and described more than 1,500 plant species. Two large plant families that he first recognized are in use: the Asteraceae and Brassicaceae. 

In the 17th century, John Ray (England, 1627–1705) wrote many important taxonomic works. Arguably his greatest accomplishment was &quot;Methodus Plantarum Nova&quot; (1682), in which he published details of over 18,000 plant species. At the time, his classifications were perhaps the most complex yet produced by any taxonomist, as he based his taxa on many combined characters. 

The next major taxonomic works were produced by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (France, 1656–1708). His work from 1700, &quot;Institutiones Rei Herbariae&quot;, included more than 9,000 species in 698 genera, which directly influenced Linnaeus, as it was the text he used as a young student.

=== Linnaean era ===
The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) ushered in a new era of taxonomy. With his major works &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; 1st Edition in 1735, &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753, and &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; 10th Edition, he revolutionized modern taxonomy. His works implemented a standardized binomial naming system for animal and plant species, which proved to be an elegant solution to a chaotic and disorganized taxonomic literature. He not only introduced the standard of class, order, genus, and species, but also made it possible to identify plants and animals from his book, by using the smaller parts of the flower (known as the Linnaean system).

Plant and animal taxonomists regard Linnaeus&#x27; work as the &quot;starting point&quot; for valid names (at 1753 and 1758 respectively). Names published before these dates are referred to as &quot;pre-Linnaean&quot;, and not considered valid (with the exception of spiders published in &quot;Svenska Spindlar&quot;). Even taxonomic names published by Linnaeus himself before these dates are considered pre-Linnaean.

=== The digital era of taxonomy ===
Modern taxonomy is heavily influenced by technology such as DNA sequencing, bioinformatics, databases, and imaging.

== Modern system of classification ==


A pattern of groups nested within groups was specified by Linnaeus&#x27; classifications of plants and animals, and these patterns began to be represented as dendrograms of the animal and plant kingdoms toward the end of the 18th century, well before Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; was published. The pattern of the &quot;Natural System&quot; did not entail a generating process, such as evolution, but may have implied it, inspiring early transmutationist thinkers. Among early works exploring the idea of a transmutation of species were &quot;Zoonomia&quot; in 1796 by Erasmus Darwin (Charles Darwin&#x27;s grandfather), and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck&#x27;s &quot;Philosophie zoologique&quot; of 1809. The idea was popularized in the Anglophone world by the speculative but widely read &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot;, published anonymously by Robert Chambers in 1844.

With Darwin&#x27;s theory, a general acceptance quickly appeared that a classification should reflect the Darwinian principle of common descent. Tree of life representations became popular in scientific works, with known fossil groups incorporated. One of the first modern groups tied to fossil ancestors was birds. Using the then newly discovered fossils of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and &quot;Hesperornis&quot;, Thomas Henry Huxley pronounced that they had evolved from dinosaurs, a group formally named by Richard Owen in 1842. The resulting description, that of dinosaurs &quot;giving rise to&quot; or being &quot;the ancestors of&quot; birds, is the essential hallmark of evolutionary taxonomic thinking. As more and more fossil groups were found and recognized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, palaeontologists worked to understand the history of animals through the ages by linking together known groups. With the modern evolutionary synthesis of the early 1940s, an essentially modern understanding of the evolution of the major groups was in place. As evolutionary taxonomy is based on Linnaean taxonomic ranks, the two terms are largely interchangeable in modern use.

The cladistic method has emerged since the 1960s. In 1958, Julian Huxley used the term &quot;clade&quot;. Later, in 1960, Cain and Harrison introduced the term &quot;cladistic&quot;. The salient feature is arranging taxa in a hierarchical evolutionary tree, with the desired objective of all named taxa being monophyletic. A taxon is called monophyletic if it includes all the descendants of an ancestral form. Groups that have descendant groups removed from them are termed paraphyletic, while groups representing more than one branch from the tree of life are called polyphyletic. Monophyletic groups are recognized and diagnosed on the basis of synapomorphies, shared derived character states.

Cladistic classifications are compatible with traditional Linnean taxonomy and the Codes of Zoological and Botanical nomenclature, to a certain extent. An alternative system of nomenclature, the &quot;International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature&quot; or &quot;PhyloCode&quot; has been proposed, which regulates the formal naming of clades. Linnaean ranks are optional and have no formal standing under the &quot;PhyloCode&quot;, which is intended to coexist with the current, rank-based codes. While popularity of phylogenetic nomenclature has grown steadily in the last few decades, it remains to be seen whether a majority of systematists will eventually adopt the &quot;PhyloCode&quot; or continue using the current systems of nomenclature that have been employed (and modified, but arguably not as much as some systematists wish) for over 250 years.

=== Kingdoms and domains ===

Well before Linnaeus, plants and animals were considered separate Kingdoms. Linnaeus used this as the top rank, dividing the physical world into the vegetable, animal and mineral kingdoms. As advances in microscopy made the classification of microorganisms possible, the number of kingdoms increased, five- and six-kingdom systems being the most common.

Domains are a relatively new grouping. First proposed in 1977, Carl Woese&#x27;s three-domain system was not generally accepted until later. One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of Archaea and Bacteria, previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera), with the Eukaryota for all organisms whose cells contain a nucleus. A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but do not accept the domain method.

Thomas Cavalier-Smith, who published extensively on the classification of protists, in 2002 proposed that the Neomura, the clade that groups together the Archaea and Eucarya, would have evolved from Bacteria, more precisely from Actinomycetota. His 2004 classification treated the archaeobacteria as part of a subkingdom of the kingdom Bacteria, i.e., he rejected the three-domain system entirely. Stefan Luketa in 2012 proposed a five &quot;dominion&quot; system, adding Prionobiota (acellular and without nucleic acid) and Virusobiota (acellular but &quot;with&quot; nucleic acid) to the traditional three domains.
=== Recent comprehensive classifications ===

Partial classifications exist for many individual groups of organisms and are revised and replaced as new information becomes available; however, comprehensive, published treatments of most or all life are rarer; recent examples are that of Adl et al., 2012 and 2019, which covers eukaryotes only with an emphasis on protists, and Ruggiero et al., 2015, covering both eukaryotes and prokaryotes to the rank of Order, although both exclude fossil representatives. A separate compilation (Ruggiero, 2014) covers extant taxa to the rank of Family. Other, database-driven treatments include the Encyclopedia of Life, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the NCBI taxonomy database, the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera, the Open Tree of Life, and the Catalogue of Life. The Paleobiology Database is a resource for fossils.

== Application ==
Biological taxonomy is a sub-discipline of biology, and is generally practiced by biologists known as &quot;taxonomists&quot;, though enthusiastic naturalists are also frequently involved in the publication of new taxa. Because taxonomy aims to describe and organize life, the work conducted by taxonomists is essential for the study of biodiversity and the resulting field of conservation biology.

=== Classifying organisms ===
Biological classification is a critical component of the taxonomic process. As a result, it informs the user as to what the relatives of the taxon are hypothesized to be. Biological classification uses taxonomic ranks, including among others (in order from most inclusive to least inclusive): domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species, and strain.

=== Taxonomic descriptions ===

The &quot;definition&quot; of a taxon is encapsulated by its description or its diagnosis or by both combined. There are no set rules governing the definition of taxa, but the naming and publication of new taxa is governed by sets of rules. In zoology, the nomenclature for the more commonly used ranks (superfamily to subspecies), is regulated by the &quot;International Code of Zoological Nomenclature&quot; (&quot;ICZN Code&quot;). In the fields of phycology, mycology, and botany, the naming of taxa is governed by the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants&quot; (&quot;ICN&quot;).

The initial description of a taxon involves five main requirements:

# The taxon must be given a name based on the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet (a binomial for new species, or uninomial for other ranks).
# The name must be unique (i.e. not a homonym).
# The description must be based on at least one name-bearing type specimen.
# It should include statements about appropriate attributes either to describe (define) the taxon or to differentiate it from other taxa (the diagnosis, &quot;ICZN Code&quot;, Article 13.1.1, &quot;ICN&quot;, Article 38, which may or may not be based on morphology). Both codes deliberately separate defining the content of a taxon (its circumscription) from defining its name.
# These first four requirements must be published in a work that is obtainable in numerous identical copies, as a permanent scientific record.

However, often much more information is included, like the geographic range of the taxon, ecological notes, chemistry, behavior, etc. How researchers arrive at their taxa varies: depending on the available data, and resources, methods vary from simple quantitative or qualitative comparisons of striking features, to elaborate computer analyses of large amounts of DNA sequence data.

=== Author citation ===

An &quot;authority&quot; may be placed after a scientific name. The authority is the name of the scientist or scientists who first validly published the name. For example, in 1758, Linnaeus gave the Asian elephant the scientific name &quot;Elephas maximus&quot;, so the name is sometimes written as &quot;&quot;Elephas maximus&quot; Linnaeus, 1758&quot;. The names of authors are often abbreviated: the abbreviation &quot;L.&quot;, for &quot;Linnaeus,&quot; is commonly used. In botany, there is, in fact, a regulated list of standard abbreviations (see list of botanists by author abbreviation). The system for assigning authorities differs slightly between botany and zoology. However, it is standard that if the genus of a species has been changed since the original description, the original authority&#x27;s name is placed in parentheses.

== Phenetics ==
In phenetics, also known as taximetrics, or numerical taxonomy, organisms are classified based on overall similarity, regardless of their phylogeny or evolutionary relationships. It results in a measure of hypergeometric &quot;distance&quot; between taxa. Phenetic methods have become relatively rare in modern times, largely superseded by cladistic analyses, as phenetic methods do not distinguish shared ancestral (or plesiomorphic) traits from shared derived (or apomorphic) traits. However, certain phenetic methods, such as neighbor joining, have persisted, as rapid estimators of relationships when more advanced methods (such as Bayesian inference) are too computationally expensive.

== Databases ==

Modern taxonomy uses database technologies to search and catalogue classifications and their documentation. While there is no commonly used database, there are comprehensive databases such as the &quot;Catalogue of Life&quot;, which attempts to list every documented species. The catalogue listed 1.64 million species for all kingdoms , claiming coverage of more than three-quarters of the estimated species known to modern science.

<text>Tyrannosaurus () is a genus of large theropod dinosaur. The type species Tyrannosaurus rex ( meaning &#x27;king&#x27; in Latin), often shortened to T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the best represented theropods. It lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia. &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the latest Campanian-Maastrichtian ages of the late Cretaceous period, 72.7 to 66 million years ago, with isolated specimens possibly indicating an earlier origin in the middle Campanian. It was the last known member of the tyrannosaurids and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.

Like other tyrannosaurids, &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; were short but unusually powerful for their size, and they had two clawed digits. The most complete specimen measures in length, but according to most modern estimates, &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; could have exceeded sizes of in length, in hip height, and in mass. Although some other theropods might have rivaled or exceeded &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; in size, it is still among the largest known land predators, with its estimated bite force being the largest among all terrestrial animals. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; was most likely an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, juvenile armored herbivores like ceratopsians and ankylosaurs, and possibly sauropods. Some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger. The question of whether &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was an apex predator or a pure scavenger was among the longest debates in paleontology. Most paleontologists today accept that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was both a predator and a scavenger.

Specimens of &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; include some that are nearly complete skeletons. Soft tissue and proteins have been reported in at least one of these specimens. The abundance of fossil material has allowed significant research into many aspects of its biology, including its life history and biomechanics. The feeding habits, physiology, and potential speed of &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; are a few subjects of debate. Its taxonomy is also controversial, as some scientists consider &quot;Tarbosaurus bataar&quot; from Asia to be a third &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; species, while others maintain &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; is a separate genus. Several other genera of North American tyrannosaurids have also been synonymized with &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. At present, two species of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; are considered valid; the type species, T. rex, and the earlier in age and more recently discovered T. mcraeensis.

As the archetypal theropod, &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; has been one of the best-known dinosaurs since the early 20th century and has been featured in film, advertising, postal stamps, and many other media.

==History of research==
===Earliest finds===

A tooth from what is now documented as a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; was found in July 1874 upon South Table Mountain (Colorado) by Jarvis Hall (Colorado) student Peter T. Dotson under the auspices of Prof. Arthur Lakes near Golden, Colorado. In the early 1890s, John Bell Hatcher collected postcranial elements in eastern Wyoming. The fossils were believed to be from the large species &quot;Ornithomimus grandis&quot; (now &quot;Deinodon&quot;) but are now considered &quot;T. rex&quot; remains.

In 1892, Edward Drinker Cope found two vertebral fragments of a large dinosaur. Cope believed the fragments belonged to an &quot;agathaumid&quot; (ceratopsid) dinosaur, and named them &quot;Manospondylus gigas&quot;, meaning &quot;giant porous vertebra&quot;, in reference to the numerous openings for blood vessels he found in the bone. The &quot;M. gigas&quot; remains were, in 1907, identified by Hatcher as those of a theropod rather than a ceratopsid.

Henry Fairfield Osborn recognized the similarity between &quot;Manospondylus gigas&quot; and &quot;T. rex&quot; as early as 1917, by which time the second vertebra had been lost. Owing to the fragmentary nature of the &quot;Manospondylus&quot; vertebrae, Osborn did not synonymize the two genera, instead considering the older genus indeterminate. In June 2000, the Black Hills Institute found around 10% of a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; skeleton (BHI 6248) at a site that might have been the original &quot;M. gigas&quot; locality.

===Skeleton discovery and naming===

Barnum Brown, assistant curator of the American Museum of Natural History, found the first partial skeleton of &quot;T. rex&quot; in eastern Wyoming in 1900. Brown found another partial skeleton in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana in 1902, comprising approximately 34 fossilized bones. Writing at the time Brown said &quot;Quarry No. 1 contains the femur, pubes, humerus, three vertebrae and two undetermined bones of a large Carnivorous Dinosaur not described by Marsh. ... I have never seen anything like it from the Cretaceous.&quot; Henry Fairfield Osborn, president of the American Museum of Natural History, named the second skeleton &quot;T. rex&quot; in 1905. The generic name is derived from the Greek words (, meaning &quot;tyrant&quot;) and (, meaning &quot;lizard&quot;). Osborn used the Latin word , meaning &quot;king&quot;, for the specific name. The full binomial therefore translates to &quot;tyrant lizard the king&quot; or &quot;King Tyrant Lizard&quot;, emphasizing the animal&#x27;s size and presumed dominance over other species of the time.
Osborn named the other specimen &quot;Dynamosaurus imperiosus&quot; in a paper in 1905. In 1906, Osborn recognized that the two skeletons were from the same species and selected &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; as the preferred name. In 1941, the &quot;T. rex&quot; type specimen was sold to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for $7,000. The original &quot;Dynamosaurus&quot; material now resides in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London. &quot;Dynamosaurus&quot; would later be honored by the 2018 description of another species of tyrannosaurid by Andrew McDonald and colleagues, &quot;Dynamoterror dynastes&quot;, whose name was chosen in reference to the 1905 name, as it had been a &quot;childhood favorite&quot; of McDonald&#x27;s.

From the 1910s through the end of the 1950s, Barnum&#x27;s discoveries remained the only specimens of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, as the Great Depression and wars kept many paleontologists out of the field.

===Resurgent interest===

Beginning in the 1960s, there was renewed interest in &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, resulting in the recovery of 42 skeletons (5–80% complete by bone count) from Western North America. In 1967, Dr. William MacMannis located and recovered the skeleton named &quot;MOR 008&quot;, which is 15% complete by bone count and has a reconstructed skull displayed at the Museum of the Rockies. The 1990s saw numerous discoveries, with nearly twice as many finds as in all previous years, including two of the most complete skeletons found to date: Sue and Stan.

Sue Hendrickson, an amateur paleontologist, discovered the most complete (approximately 85%) and largest &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; skeleton in the Hell Creek Formation on August 12, 1990. The specimen Sue, named after the discoverer, was the object of a legal battle over its ownership. In 1997, the litigation was settled in favor of Maurice Williams, the original land owner. The fossil collection was purchased by the Field Museum of Natural History at auction for $7.6 million, making it the most expensive dinosaur skeleton until the sale of Stan for $31.8 million in 2020. From 1998 to 1999, Field Museum of Natural History staff spent over 25,000 hours taking the rock off the bones. The bones were then shipped to New Jersey where the mount was constructed, then shipped back to Chicago for the final assembly. The mounted skeleton opened to the public on May 17, 2000, in the Field Museum of Natural History. A study of this specimen&#x27;s fossilized bones showed that Sue reached full size at age 19 and died at the age of 28, the longest estimated life of any tyrannosaur known. 

Another &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, nicknamed Stan (BHI 3033), in honor of amateur paleontologist Stan Sacrison, was recovered from the Hell Creek Formation in 1992. Stan is the second most complete skeleton found, with 199 bones recovered representing 70% of the total. This tyrannosaur also had many bone pathologies, including broken and healed ribs, a broken (and healed) neck, and a substantial hole in the back of its head, about the size of a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; tooth.

In 1998, 20-year-old Bucky Derflinger noticed a &quot;T. rex&quot; toe exposed above ground, making him the youngest person to discover a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. The specimen, dubbed Bucky in honor of its discoverer, was a young adult, tall and long. Bucky is the first &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; to be found that preserved a furcula (wishbone). Bucky is permanently displayed at The Children&#x27;s Museum of Indianapolis.

In the summer of 2000, crews organized by Jack Horner discovered five &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; skeletons near the Fort Peck Reservoir. In 2001, a 50% complete skeleton of a juvenile &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation by a crew from the Burpee Museum of Natural History. Dubbed Jane (BMRP 2002.4.1), the find was thought to be the first known skeleton of a pygmy tyrannosaurid, &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot;, but subsequent research revealed that it is more likely a juvenile &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, and the most complete juvenile example known; Jane is exhibited at the Burpee Museum of Natural History. In 2002, a skeleton nicknamed &quot;Wyrex&quot;, discovered by amateur collectors Dan Wells and Don Wyrick, had 114 bones and was 38% complete. The dig was concluded over 3 weeks in 2004 by the Black Hills Institute with the first live online &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; excavation providing daily reports, photos, and video.

In 2006, Montana State University revealed that it possessed the largest &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; skull yet discovered (from a specimen named MOR 008), measuring long. Subsequent comparisons indicated that the longest head was (from specimen LACM 23844) and the widest head was (from Sue).

===Footprints===

Two isolated fossilized footprints have been tentatively assigned to &quot;T. rex&quot;. The first was discovered at Philmont Scout Ranch, New Mexico, in 1983 by American geologist Charles Pillmore. Originally thought to belong to a hadrosaurid, examination of the footprint revealed a large &#x27;heel&#x27; unknown in ornithopod dinosaur tracks, and traces of what may have been a hallux, the dewclaw-like fourth digit of the tyrannosaur foot. The footprint was published as the ichnogenus &quot;Tyrannosauripus pillmorei&quot; in 1994, by Martin Lockley and Adrian Hunt. Lockley and Hunt suggested that it was very likely the track was made by a &quot;T. rex&quot;, which would make it the first known footprint from this species. The track was made in what was once a vegetated wetland mudflat. It measures long by wide.

A second footprint that may have been made by a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was first reported in 2007 by British paleontologist Phil Manning, from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. This second track measures long, shorter than the track described by Lockley and Hunt. Whether or not the track was made by &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; is unclear, though &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; is the only large theropod known to have existed in the Hell Creek Formation.

A set of footprints in Glenrock, Wyoming dating to the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous and hailing from the Lance Formation were described by Scott Persons, Phil Currie and colleagues in 2016, and are believed to belong to either a juvenile &quot;T. rex&quot; or the dubious tyrannosaurid &quot;Nanotyrannus lancensis&quot;. From measurements and based on the positions of the footprints, the animal was believed to be traveling at a walking speed of around 2.8 to 5 miles per hour and was estimated to have a hip height of . A follow-up paper appeared in 2017, increasing the speed estimations by 50–80%.

==Description==
===Size===

&quot;T. rex&quot; was one of the largest land carnivores of all time. One of its largest and the most complete specimens, nicknamed Sue (FMNH PR2081), is located at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Sue measured long, was tall at the hips, and according to the most recent studies, using a variety of techniques, maximum body masses have been estimated approximately . A specimen nicknamed Scotty (RSM P2523.8), located at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum, is reported to measure in length. Using a mass estimation technique that extrapolates from the circumference of the femur, Scotty was estimated as the largest known specimen at in body mass.

Not every adult &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; specimen recovered is as big. Historically average adult mass estimates have varied widely over the years, from as low as , to more than , with most modern estimates ranging between .

A 2024 study found that there was little evidence of size-based sexual dimorphism in &quot;T. rex&quot;.

===Skull===

The largest known &quot;T. rex&quot; skulls measure up to in length. Large fenestrae (openings) in the skull reduced weight, as in all carnivorous theropods. In other respects &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;&#x27;s skull was significantly different from those of large non-tyrannosaurid theropods. It was extremely wide at the rear but had a narrow snout, allowing unusually good binocular vision. The skull bones were massive and the nasals and some other bones were fused, preventing movement between them; but many were pneumatized (contained a &quot;honeycomb&quot; of tiny air spaces) and thus lighter. These and other skull-strengthening features are part of the tyrannosaurid trend towards an increasingly powerful bite, which easily surpassed that of all non-tyrannosaurids. The tip of the upper jaw was U-shaped (most non-tyrannosauroid carnivores had V-shaped upper jaws), which increased the amount of tissue and bone a tyrannosaur could rip out with one bite, although it also increased the stresses on the front teeth.

The teeth of &quot;T. rex&quot; displayed marked heterodonty (differences in shape). The premaxillary teeth, four per side at the front of the upper jaw, were closely packed, &quot;D&quot;-shaped in cross-section, had reinforcing ridges on the rear surface, were incisiform (their tips were chisel-like blades) and curved backwards. The &quot;D&quot;-shaped cross-section, reinforcing ridges and backwards curve reduced the risk that the teeth would snap when &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; bit and pulled. The remaining teeth were robust, like &quot;lethal bananas&quot; rather than daggers, more widely spaced and also had reinforcing ridges. Those in the upper jaw, twelve per side in mature individuals, were larger than their counterparts of the lower jaw, except at the rear. The largest found so far is estimated to have been long including the root when the animal was alive, making it the largest tooth of any carnivorous dinosaur yet found. The lower jaw was robust. Its front dentary bone bore thirteen teeth. Behind the tooth row, the lower jaw became notably taller. The upper and lower jaws of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, like those of many dinosaurs, possessed numerous foramina, or small holes in the bone. Various functions have been proposed for these foramina, such as a crocodile-like sensory system or evidence of extra-oral structures such as scales or potentially lips, with subsequent research on theropod tooth wear patterns supporting such a proposition.

===Skeleton===

The vertebral column of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; consisted of ten neck vertebrae, thirteen back vertebrae and five sacral vertebrae. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and could well have varied between individuals but probably numbered at least forty. Sue was mounted with forty-seven of such caudal vertebrae. The neck of &quot;T. rex&quot; formed a natural S-shaped curve like that of other theropods. Compared to these, it was exceptionally short, deep and muscular to support the massive head. The second vertebra, the axis, was especially short. The remaining neck vertebrae were weakly opisthocoelous, i.e. with a convex front of the vertebral body and a concave rear. The vertebral bodies had single pleurocoels, pneumatic depressions created by air sacs, on their sides. The vertebral bodies of the torso were robust but with a narrow waist. Their undersides were keeled. The front sides were concave with a deep vertical trough. They had large pleurocoels. Their neural spines had very rough front and rear sides for the attachment of strong tendons. The sacral vertebrae were fused to each other, both in their vertebral bodies and neural spines. They were pneumatized. They were connected to the pelvis by transverse processes and sacral ribs. The tail was heavy and moderately long, in order to balance the massive head and torso and to provide space for massive locomotor muscles that attached to the thighbones. The thirteenth tail vertebra formed the transition point between the deep tail base and the middle tail that was stiffened by a rather long front articulation processes. The underside of the trunk was covered by eighteen or nineteen pairs of segmented belly ribs.

The shoulder girdle was longer than the entire forelimb. The shoulder blade had a narrow shaft but was exceptionally expanded at its upper end. It connected via a long forward protrusion to the coracoid, which was rounded. Both shoulder blades were connected by a small furcula. The paired breast bones possibly were made of cartilage only.

The forelimb or arm was very short. The upper arm bone, the humerus, was short but robust. It had a narrow upper end with an exceptionally rounded head. The lower arm bones, the ulna and radius, were straight elements, much shorter than the humerus. The second metacarpal was longer and wider than the first, whereas normally in theropods the opposite is true. The forelimbs had only two clawed fingers, along with an additional splint-like small third metacarpal representing the remnant of a third digit.

The pelvis was a large structure. Its upper bone, the ilium, was both very long and high, providing an extensive attachment area for hindlimb muscles. The front pubic bone ended in an enormous pubic boot, longer than the entire shaft of the element. The rear ischium was slender and straight, pointing obliquely to behind and below.

In contrast to the arms, the hindlimbs were among the longest in proportion to body size of any theropod. In the foot, the metatarsus was &quot;arctometatarsalian&quot;, meaning that the part of the third metatarsal near the ankle was pinched. The third metatarsal was also exceptionally sinuous. Compensating for the immense bulk of the animal, many bones throughout the skeleton were hollowed, reducing its weight without significant loss of strength.

==Classification==

&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; is the type genus of the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea, the family Tyrannosauridae, and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae; in other words it is the standard by which paleontologists decide whether to include other species in the same group. Other members of the tyrannosaurine subfamily include the North American &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and the Asian &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, both of which have occasionally been synonymized with &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;.

Tyrannosaurids were once commonly thought to be descendants of earlier large theropods such as megalosaurs and carnosaurs, although more recently they were reclassified with the generally smaller coelurosaurs. The earliest tyrannosaur group were the crested proceratosaurids, while later and more derived members belong to the Pantyrannosauria. Tyrannosaurs started out as small theropods; however at least some became larger by the Early Cretaceous.

Tyrannosauroids are characterized by their fused nasals and dental arrangement. Pantyrannosaurs are characterized by unique features in their hips as well as an enlarged foramen in the quadrate, a broad postorbital and hourglass shaped nasals. Some of the more derived pantyrannosaurs lack nasal pneumaticity and have a lower humerus to femur ratio with their arms starting to see some reduction. Some pantyrannosaurs started developing an arctometatarsus. Eutyrannosaurs have a rough texture on their nasal bones and their mandibular fenestra is reduced externally. Tyrannosaurids lack kinetic skulls or special crests on their nasal bones, and have a lacrimal with a distinctive process on it. Tyrannosaurids also have an interfenestral strut that is less than half as big as the maxillary fenestra.

It is quite likely that tyrannosauroids rose to prominence after the decline in allosauroid and megalosauroid diversity seen during the early stages of the Late Cretaceous. Below is a simple cladogram of general tyrannosauroid relationships that was found after an analysis conducted by Li and colleagues in 2009.
Many phylogenetic analyses have found &quot;Tarbosaurus bataar&quot; to be the sister taxon of &quot;T. rex&quot;. The discovery of the tyrannosaurid &quot;Lythronax&quot; further indicates that &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; are closely related, forming a clade with fellow Asian tyrannosaurid &quot;Zhuchengtyrannus&quot;, with &quot;Lythronax&quot; being their sister taxon. A further study from 2016 by Steve Brusatte, Thomas Carr and colleagues, also indicates that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; may have been an immigrant from Asia, as well as a possible descendant of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;.

Below is the cladogram of Tyrannosauridae based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Loewen and colleagues in 2013.
In their 2024 description of &quot;Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis&quot;, Dalman et al. recovered similar results to previous analyses, with &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; as the sister taxon to the clade formed by &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Zhuchengtyrannus&quot;, called the Tyrannosaurini. They also found support for a monophyletic clade containing &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and &quot;Thanatotheristes&quot;, typically referred to as the Daspletosaurini.

===Additional species===

In 1955, Soviet paleontologist Evgeny Maleev named a new species, &quot;Tyrannosaurus bataar&quot;, from Mongolia. By 1965, this species was renamed as a distinct genus, &quot;Tarbosaurus bataar&quot;. While most palaeontologists continue to maintain the two as distinct genera, some authors such as Thomas Holtz, Kenneth Carpenter, and Thomas Carr argue that the two species are similar enough to be considered members of the same genus, restoring the Mongolian taxon&#x27;s original binomial name.

Some specimens from the Late Cretaceous deposits of China have been described as new species of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;: &quot;T. lanpingensis&quot; based on isolated lateral tooth from the red beds of Yunnan in 1975; &quot;T. turpanensis&quot; from the Subashi Formation, Turpan Basin, Xinjiang in 1978; and &quot;T. luanchuanensis&quot; from the Quiba Formation, Tantou Basin, Henan Province in 1979–1980. All these taxa were published without detailed descriptions and were later accepted as junior synonyms of &quot;Tarbosaurus bataar&quot; by Holtz in 2004.

VGI, no. 231/3, a large phalanx bone, assigned to &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; sp. by Yarkov in 2000, was found in the Lower Maastrichtian of Bereslavka, Russia. In 2004, Averianov and Yarkov reinterpreted it as a metacarpal I or metatarsal I that possibly belongs to ceratosaur. In their 2023 overview, Averianov and Lopatin mention this specimen as well as a single tooth from the same site only as Theropoda indet.

In 2001, various tyrannosaurid teeth and a metatarsal unearthed in a quarry near Zhucheng, China were assigned by Chinese paleontologist Hu Chengzhi to the newly erected species &quot;Tyrannosaurus zhuchengensis&quot;. However, in a nearby site, a right maxilla and left jawbone were assigned to the newly erected tyrannosaurid genus &quot;Zhuchengtyrannus&quot; in 2011. It is possible that &quot;T. zhuchengensis&quot; is synonymous with &quot;Zhuchengtyrannus&quot;. In any case, &quot;T. zhuchengensis&quot; is considered to be a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; as the holotype lacks diagnostic features below the level Tyrannosaurinae.

In 2006, a fragmentary tyrannosaurid lacrimal (CM 9401) from the Judith River Formation of Fergus County, Montana was described as ?&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; sp. This isolated right lacrimal was originally collected alongside the holotype specimen of &quot;Deinosuchus rugosus&quot;, a giant crocodylian, and remained undescribed until its re-identification as belonging to a tyrannosaurid theropod in the 1980s by paleontologist Dale Russell. The lacrimal closely resembles those of &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; in both size and morphology. Notably, it lacks the &quot;lacrimal horn&quot; typically present in earlier tyrannosaurids like &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; and &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, instead exhibiting a distinct rugosity along the dorsal surface—consistent with &quot;T. rex&quot; and its Asian relative &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. The specimen&#x27;s considerable size places it within the range of known &quot;T. rex&quot; individuals, suggesting the presence of large tyrannosaurids during the Campanian stage (~75 million years ago), a temporal range earlier than the established Maastrichtian age (~68–66 Ma) for &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;. However, the exact age and provenance of CM 9401 remain uncertain due to a lack of detailed field documentation.

In 2018, a paper describing tyrannosaurid teeth from the Two Medicine Formation noted a premaxillary tooth (YPM VPPU 023469) had a strong resemblance to the teeth of Sue to the exclusion of any Campanian tyrannosaurid. Additionally, the authors of this paper suggested that CM 9401 also comes from the Two Medicine Formation, as there were preservational similarities between its locality and the Willow Creek anticline, which is where the tooth was found. Notably, this would place both specimens in the Flag Butte Member of the Two Medicine Formation, which dates from 77 to 76.3 Ma, far younger than any other &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; specimen, and directly contemporaneous with &quot;Daspletosaurus.&quot; In 2025, these specimens, with their old geologic age, were used as evidence by Charlie Scherer to suggest that the Tyrannosaurini did not evolve directly from &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;.

In a 2022 study, Gregory S. Paul and colleagues argued that &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, as traditionally understood, actually represents three species: the type species &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, and two new species: &quot;T. imperator&quot; (meaning &quot;tyrant lizard emperor&quot;) and &quot;T. regina&quot; (meaning &quot;tyrant lizard queen&quot;). The holotype of the former (&quot;T. imperator&quot;) is the Sue specimen, and the holotype of the latter (&quot;T. regina&quot;) is Wankel rex. The division into multiple species was primarily based on the observation of a very high degree of variation in the proportions and robusticity of the femur (and other skeletal elements) across catalogued &quot;T. rex&quot; specimens, more so than that observed in other theropods recognized as one species. Differences of general body proportions representing robust and gracile morphotypes were also used as a line of evidence, in addition to the number of small, slender incisiform teeth in the dentary, as based on tooth sockets. Specifically, the paper&#x27;s &quot;T. rex&quot; was distinguished by robust anatomy, a moderate ratio of femur length vs circumference, and the possession of a singular slender incisiform dentary tooth; &quot;T. imperator&quot; was considered to be robust with a small femur length to circumference ratio and two of the slender teeth; and &quot;T. regina&quot; was a gracile form with a high femur ratio and one of the slender teeth. It was observed that variation in proportions and robustness became more extreme higher up in the sample, stratigraphically. This was interpreted as a single earlier population, &quot;T. imperator&quot;, speciating into more than one taxon, &quot;T. rex&quot; and &quot;T. regina&quot;.

However, several other leading paleontologists, including Stephen Brusatte, Thomas Carr, Thomas Holtz, David Hone, Jingmai O&#x27;Connor, and Lindsay Zanno, criticized the study or expressed skepticism of its conclusions when approached by various media outlets for comment. Their criticism was subsequently published in a technical paper. Holtz and Zanno both remarked that it was plausible that more than one species of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; existed, but felt the new study was insufficient to support the species it proposed. Holtz remarked that, even if &quot;Tyrannosaurus imperator&quot; represented a distinct species from &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, it may represent the same species as &quot;Nanotyrannus lancensis&quot; and would need to be called &quot;Tyrannosaurus lancensis&quot;. O&#x27;Connor, a curator at the Field Museum, where the &quot;T. imperator&quot; holotype Sue is displayed, regarded the new species as too poorly-supported to justify modifying the exhibit signs. Brusatte, Carr, and O&#x27;Connor viewed the distinguishing features proposed between the species as reflecting natural variation within a species. Both Carr and O&#x27;Connor expressed concerns about the study&#x27;s inability to determine which of the proposed species several well-preserved specimens belonged to. Another paleontologist, Philip J. Currie, originally co-authored the study but withdrew from it as he did not want to be involved in naming the new species. Paul still rejected the objections raised by critics, insisting that they are unwilling to consider that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; might represent more than one species.

===&quot;Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis&quot;===

In 2024, Dalman and colleagues described the remains of a tyrannosaur discovered in 1983 in the Campanian-early Maastrichtian Hall Lake Formation in New Mexico. Reposited at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, the fossil material (NMMNH P-3698) consists of the right postorbital, right squamosal, left palatine, and an incomplete maxilla from the skull, the left dentary, right splenial, right prearticular, right angular and right articular from the lower jaws, isolated teeth, and chevrons. Some of the bones were briefly mentioned in 1984 as belonging to &quot;T. rex&quot;, and described in 1986.

Lehman and Carpenter (1990) suggested that NMMNH P-3698 belonged to a new tyrannosaurid genus, while Carr and Williamson (2000) disagreed with their claim. Sullivan and Lucas (2015) argued that there is little evidence to support NMMNH P-3698 as a specimen of &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, so they tentatively classified it as cf. &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; sp.; they also considered that the McRae tyrannosaur lived before the Lancian (before 67 million years ago) based on its coexistence with &quot;Alamosaurus&quot;.

Dalman et al. (2024) proposed the new name &quot;Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis&quot; for the holotype (NMMNH P-3698), referencing the McRae Group, the rock layers to which the Hall Lake Formation belongs. The holotype of &quot;T. mcraeensis&quot; is found in the strata that are around a few million years older than the accepted range of &quot;T. rex&quot;, which existed at the end of the Maastrichtian. The rock layers were initially estimated to date to between 72.7 and 70.9 Ma, correlating to the latest Campanian or earliest Maastrichtian. However, in a 2024 conference abstracts, the specific stratigraphic layer which yielded &quot;T. mcraeensis&quot; was estimated to be younger than 69.0 ± 0.4 Ma and older than 66.0 Ma based on the sandstone from the same fossil locality, which would suggest that the age of &quot;T. mcraeensis&quot; is much closer to &quot;T. rex&quot; than previously thought. &quot;T. mcraeensis&quot; was estimated at long, which is similar to the size of an adult &quot;T. rex&quot;. The two are distinguished by characters of the skull. Amongst these, the dentary of &quot;T. mcraeensis&quot; is proportionately longer and possesses a less prominent chin, and the lower jaw shallower than that of &quot;T. rex&quot;, suggesting a weaker bite. The teeth are likewise blunter and more laterally compressed, while the post orbital crests are less prominent. Likewise, the skeletal anatomy showcases shared characteristics with &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Zhuchengtyrannus&quot;.

===&quot;Nanotyrannus&quot;===

Other tyrannosaurid fossils found in the same formations as &quot;T. rex&quot; were originally classified as separate taxa, including &quot;Aublysodon&quot; and &quot;Albertosaurus megagracilis&quot;, the latter being named &quot;Dinotyrannus megagracilis&quot; in 1995. These fossils are now universally considered to belong to juvenile &quot;T. rex&quot;. A small but nearly complete skull from Montana, long, might be an exception. This skull, CMNH 7541, was originally classified as a species of &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; (&quot;G. lancensis&quot;) by Charles W. Gilmore in 1946. In 1988, the specimen was re-described by Robert T. Bakker, Phil Currie, and Michael Williams, then the curator of paleontology at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, where the original specimen was housed and is now on display. Their initial research indicated that the skull bones were fused, and that it therefore represented an adult specimen. In light of this, Bakker and colleagues assigned the skull to a new genus named &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; (meaning &quot;dwarf tyrant&quot;, for its apparently small adult size). The specimen is estimated to have been around long when it died. However, In 1999, a detailed analysis by Thomas Carr revealed the specimen to be a juvenile, leading Carr and many other paleontologists to consider it a juvenile &quot;T. rex&quot; individual.
In 2001, a more complete juvenile tyrannosaur (nicknamed &quot;Jane&quot;, catalog number BMRP 2002.4.1), belonging to the same species as the original &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; specimen, was uncovered. This discovery prompted a conference on tyrannosaurs focused on the issues of &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; validity at the Burpee Museum of Natural History in 2005. Several paleontologists who had previously published opinions that &quot;N. lancensis&quot; was a valid species, including Currie and Williams, saw the discovery of &quot;Jane&quot; as a confirmation that &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; was, in fact, a juvenile &quot;T. rex&quot;. Peter Larson continued to support the hypothesis that &quot;N&quot;. &quot;lancensis&quot; was a separate but closely related species, based on skull features such as two more teeth in both jaws than &quot;T. rex&quot;; as well as proportionately larger hands with phalanges on the third metacarpal and different wishbone anatomy in an undescribed specimen. He also argued that &quot;Stygivenator&quot;, generally considered to be a juvenile &quot;T. rex&quot;, may be a younger &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; specimen. Later research revealed that other tyrannosaurids such as &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; also experienced reduction in tooth count during growth, and given the disparity in tooth count between individuals of the same age group in this genus and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, this feature may also be due to individual variation. In 2013, Carr noted that all of the differences claimed to support &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; have turned out to be individually or ontogenetically variable features or products of distortion of the bones.

In 2016, analysis of limb proportions by Persons and Currie suggested &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; specimens to have differing cursoriality levels, potentially separating it from &quot;T. rex&quot;. However, paleontologist Manabu Sakomoto has commented that this conclusion may be impacted by low sample size, and the discrepancy does not necessarily reflect taxonomic distinction. In 2016, Joshua Schmerge argued for &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot;&#x27; validity based on skull features, including a dentary groove in BMRP 2002.4.1&#x27;s skull. According to Schmerge, as that feature is absent in &quot;T. rex&quot; and found only in &quot;Dryptosaurus&quot; and albertosaurines, this suggests &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; is a distinct taxon within the Albertosaurinae. The same year, Carr and colleagues noted that this was insufficient to clarify &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot;&#x27; validity or classification, being a common and ontogenetically variable feature among tyrannosauroids.

A 2020 study by Holly Woodward and colleagues showed the specimens referred to &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; were all ontogenetically immature and found it probable that these specimens belonged to &quot;T. rex&quot;. The same year, Carr published a paper on &quot;T&quot;. &quot;rex&quot;&#x27;s growth history, finding that CMNH 7541 fit within the expected ontogenetic variation of the taxon and displayed juvenile characteristics found in other specimens. It was classified as a juvenile, under 13 years old with a skull less than . No significant sexual or phylogenetic variation was discernible among any of the 44 specimens studied, with Carr stating that characters of potential phylogenetic importance decrease throughout age at the same rate as growth occurs. Discussing the paper&#x27;s results, Carr described how all &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; specimens formed a continual growth transition between the smallest juveniles and the subadults, unlike what would be expected if it were a distinct taxon where the specimens would group to the exclusion of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. Carr concluded that &quot;the &#x27;nanomorphs&#x27; are not all that similar to each other and instead form an important bridge in the growth series of &quot;T. rex&quot; that captures the beginnings of the profound change from the shallow skull of juveniles to the deep skull that is seen in fully-developed adults.&quot;

However, a 2024 paper published by Nick Longrich and Evan Thomas Saitta reexamined the holotype and referred specimens of &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot;. Based on several factors, including differences in morphology, ontogeny, and phylogeny, Longrich and Saitta suggest that &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; is a distinct taxon which may fall outside of Tyrannosauridae, based on some of their phylogenetic analyses.

==Paleobiology==

===Life history===

The identification of several specimens as juvenile &quot;T. rex&quot; has allowed scientists to document ontogenetic changes in the species, estimate the lifespan, and determine how quickly the animals would have grown. The smallest known individual (LACM 28471, the &quot;Jordan theropod&quot;) is estimated to have weighed only , while the largest adults, such as FMNH PR2081 (Sue) most likely weighed about . Histologic analysis of &quot;T. rex&quot; bones showed LACM 28471 had aged only 2 years when it died, while Sue was 28 years old, an age which may have been close to the maximum for the species.
Histology has also allowed the age of other specimens to be determined. Growth curves can be developed when the ages of different specimens are plotted on a graph along with their mass. A &quot;T. rex&quot; growth curve is S-shaped, with juveniles remaining under until approximately 14 years of age, when body size began to increase dramatically. During this rapid growth phase, a young &quot;T. rex&quot; would gain an average of a year for the next four years. At 18 years of age, the curve plateaus again, indicating that growth slowed dramatically. For example, only separated the 28-year-old Sue from a 22-year-old Canadian specimen (RTMP 81.12.1). A 2004 histological study performed by different workers corroborates these results, finding that rapid growth began to slow at around 16 years of age.

A study by Hutchinson and colleagues in 2011 corroborated the previous estimation methods in general, but their estimation of peak growth rates is significantly higher; it found that the &quot;maximum growth rates for T. rex during the exponential stage are 1790 kg/year&quot;. Although these results were much higher than previous estimations, the authors noted that these results significantly lowered the great difference between its actual growth rate and the one which would be expected of an animal of its size. The sudden change in growth rate at the end of the growth spurt may indicate physical maturity, a hypothesis which is supported by the discovery of medullary tissue in the femur of a 16 to 20-year-old &quot;T. rex&quot; from Montana (MOR 1125, also known as B-rex). Medullary tissue is found only in female birds during ovulation, indicating that B-rex was of reproductive age. Further study indicates an age of 18 for this specimen. In 2016, it was finally confirmed by Mary Higby Schweitzer and Lindsay Zanno and colleagues that the soft tissue within the femur of MOR 1125 was medullary tissue. This also confirmed the identity of the specimen as a female. The discovery of medullary bone tissue within &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; may prove valuable in determining the sex of other dinosaur species in future examinations, as the chemical makeup of medullary tissue is unmistakable. Other tyrannosaurids exhibit extremely similar growth curves, although with lower growth rates corresponding to their lower adult sizes.
An additional study published in 2020 by Woodward and colleagues, for the journal &quot;Science Advances&quot; indicates that during their growth from juvenile to adult, &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was capable of slowing down its growth to counter environmental factors such as lack of food. The study, focusing on two juvenile specimens between 13 and 15 years old housed at the Burpee Museum in Illinois, indicates that the rate of maturation for &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was dependent on resource abundance. This study also indicates that in such changing environments, &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was particularly well-suited to an environment that shifted yearly in regards to resource abundance, hinting that other midsize predators might have had difficulty surviving in such harsh conditions and explaining the niche partitioning between juvenile and adult tyrannosaurs. The study further indicates that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and the dubious genus &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; are synonymous, due to analysis of the growth rings in the bones of the two specimens studied.

Over half of the known &quot;T. rex&quot; specimens appear to have died within six years of reaching sexual maturity, a pattern which is also seen in other tyrannosaurs and in some large, long-lived birds and mammals today. These species are characterized by high infant mortality rates, followed by relatively low mortality among juveniles. Mortality increases again following sexual maturity, partly due to the stresses of reproduction. One study suggests that the rarity of juvenile &quot;T. rex&quot; fossils is due in part to low juvenile mortality rates; the animals were not dying in large numbers at these ages, and thus were not often fossilized. This rarity may also be due to the incompleteness of the fossil record or to the bias of fossil collectors towards larger, more spectacular specimens. In a 2013 lecture, Thomas Holtz Jr. suggested that dinosaurs &quot;lived fast and died young&quot; because they reproduced quickly whereas mammals have long lifespans because they take longer to reproduce. Gregory S. Paul also writes that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; reproduced quickly and died young but attributes their short lifespans to the dangerous lives they lived.

===Skin and possible filamentous feathering===
The discovery of feathered dinosaurs led to debate regarding whether, and to what extent, &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; might have been feathered. Filamentous structures, which are commonly recognized as the precursors of feathers, have been reported in the small-bodied, basal tyrannosauroid &quot;Dilong paradoxus&quot; from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of China in 2004. Because integumentary impressions of larger tyrannosauroids known at that time showed evidence of scales, the researchers who studied &quot;Dilong&quot; speculated that insulating feathers might have been lost by larger species due to their smaller surface-to-volume ratio. The subsequent discovery of the giant species &quot;Yutyrannus huali&quot;, also from the Yixian, showed that even some large tyrannosauroids had feathers covering much of their bodies, casting doubt on the hypothesis that they were a size-related feature. A 2017 study reviewed known skin impressions of tyrannosaurids, including those of a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; specimen nicknamed &quot;Wyrex&quot; (HMNS 2006.1743.01, formerly known as BHI 6230) which preserves patches of mosaic scales on the tail, hip, and neck. The study concluded that feather covering of large tyrannosaurids such as &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was, if present, limited to the upper side of the trunk.

A conference abstract published in 2016 posited that theropods such as &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had their upper teeth covered in lips, instead of bare teeth as seen in crocodilians. This was based on the presence of enamel, which according to the study needs to remain hydrated, an issue not faced by aquatic animals like crocodilians. However, there has been criticism where it favors the idea for lips, with the 2017 analytical study proposing that tyrannosaurids had large, flat scales on their snouts instead of lips, as modern crocodiles do. But crocodiles possess rather cracked keratinized skin, not flat scales; by observing the hummocky rugosity of tyrannosaurids, and comparing it to extant lizards, researchers have found that tyrannosaurids had squamose scales rather than a crocodillian-like skin.

In 2023, Cullen and colleagues supported the idea that theropods like tyrannosaurids had lips based on anatomical patterns, such as those of the foramina on their face and jaws, more similar to those of modern squamates such as monitor lizards or marine iguanas than those of modern crocodilians like alligators. Comparison of the teeth of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and American alligators shows that the enamel of tyrannosaurids had no significant wear and that the teeth of modern crocodilians were eroded on the labial side and were substantially worn. This suggests that it is likely that theropod teeth were kept wet by lips. On the basis of the relationship between hydration and wear resistance, the authors argued that it is unlikely that the teeth of theropods, including tyrannosaurids, would have remained unworn when exposed for a long time, because it would have been hard to maintain hydration. The authors also performed regression analyses to demonstrate the relationship between tooth height and skull length, and found that varanids like the crocodile monitor had substantially greater ratios of tooth height to skull length than those of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, indicating that the teeth of theropods were not too big to be covered by extraoral tissues when the mouth was closed.

===Sexual dimorphism===

As the number of known specimens increased, scientists began to analyze the variation between individuals and discovered what appeared to be two distinct body types, or &quot;morphs&quot;, similar to some other theropod species. As one of these morphs was more solidly built, it was termed the &#x27;robust&#x27; morph while the other was termed &#x27;&#x27;. Several morphological differences associated with the two morphs were used to analyze sexual dimorphism in &quot;T. rex&quot;, with the &#x27;robust&#x27; morph usually suggested to be female. For example, the pelvis of several &#x27;robust&#x27; specimens seemed to be wider, perhaps to allow the passage of eggs. It was also thought that the &#x27;robust&#x27; morphology correlated with a reduced chevron on the first tail vertebra, also ostensibly to allow eggs to pass out of the reproductive tract, as had been erroneously reported for crocodiles.

In recent years, evidence for sexual dimorphism has been weakened. A 2005 study reported that previous claims of sexual dimorphism in crocodile chevron anatomy were in error, casting doubt on the existence of similar dimorphism between &quot;T. rex&quot; sexes. A full-sized chevron was discovered on the first tail vertebra of Sue, an extremely robust individual, indicating that this feature could not be used to differentiate the two morphs anyway. As &quot;T. rex&quot; specimens have been found from Saskatchewan to New Mexico, differences between individuals may be indicative of geographic variation rather than sexual dimorphism. The differences could also be age-related, with &#x27;robust&#x27; individuals being older animals.

Only a single &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; specimen has been conclusively shown to belong to a specific sex. Examination of B-rex demonstrated the preservation of soft tissue within several bones. Some of this tissue has been identified as a medullary tissue, a specialized tissue grown only in modern birds as a source of calcium for the production of eggshell during ovulation. As only female birds lay eggs, medullary tissue is only found naturally in females, although males are capable of producing it when injected with female reproductive hormones like estrogen. This strongly suggests that B-rex was female and that she died during ovulation. Recent research has shown that medullary tissue is never found in crocodiles, which are thought to be the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. The shared presence of medullary tissue in birds and other theropod dinosaurs is further evidence of the close evolutionary relationship between the two.

===Posture===

Like many bipedal dinosaurs, &quot;T. rex&quot; was historically depicted as a &#x27;living tripod&#x27;, with the body at 45 degrees or less from the vertical and the tail dragging along the ground, similar to a kangaroo. This concept dates from Joseph Leidy&#x27;s 1865 reconstruction of &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot;, the first to depict a dinosaur in a bipedal posture. In 1915, convinced that the creature stood upright, Henry Fairfield Osborn, former president of the American Museum of Natural History, further reinforced the notion in unveiling the first complete &quot;T. rex&quot; skeleton arranged this way. It stood in an upright pose for 77 years, until it was dismantled in 1992.

By 1970, scientists realized this pose was incorrect and could not have been maintained by a living animal, as it would have resulted in the dislocation or weakening of several joints, including the hips and the articulation between the head and the spinal column. The inaccurate AMNH mount inspired similar depictions in many films and paintings (such as Rudolph Zallinger&#x27;s famous mural &quot;The Age of Reptiles&quot; in Yale University&#x27;s Peabody Museum of Natural History) until the 1990s, when films such as &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; introduced a more accurate posture to the general public. Modern representations in museums, art, and film show &quot;T. rex&quot; with its body approximately parallel to the ground with the tail extended behind the body to balance the head.

To sit down, &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; may have settled its weight backwards and rested its weight on a pubic boot, the wide expansion at the end of the pubis in some dinosaurs. With its weight rested on the pelvis, it may have been free to move the hindlimbs. Getting back up again might have involved some stabilization from the diminutive forelimbs. The latter known as Newman&#x27;s pushup theory has been debated. Nonetheless, &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was probably able to get up if it fell, which only would have required placing the limbs below the center of gravity, with the tail as an effective counterbalance. Healed stress fractures in the forelimbs have been put forward both as evidence that the arms cannot have been very useful and as evidence that they were indeed used and acquired wounds, like the rest of the body.

===Arms===

When &quot;T. rex&quot; was first discovered, the humerus was the only element of the forelimb known. For the initial mounted skeleton as seen by the public in 1915, Osborn substituted longer, three-fingered forelimbs like those of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. A year earlier, Lawrence Lambe described the short, two-fingered forelimbs of the closely related &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;. This strongly suggested that &quot;T. rex&quot; had similar forelimbs, but this hypothesis was not confirmed until the first complete &quot;T. rex&quot; forelimbs were identified in 1989, belonging to MOR 555 (the &quot;Wankel rex&quot;). The remains of Sue also include complete forelimbs. &quot;T. rex&quot; arms are very small relative to overall body size, measuring only long, and some scholars have labelled them as vestigial. However, the bones show large areas for muscle attachment, indicating considerable strength. This was recognized as early as 1906 by Osborn, who speculated that the forelimbs may have been used to grasp a mate during copulation. Newman (1970) suggested that the forelimbs were used to assist &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; in rising from a prone position. Since then, other functions have been proposed, although some scholars find them implausible. Padian (2022) argued that the reduction of the arms in tyrannosaurids did not serve a particular function but was a secondary adaptation, stating that as tyrannosaurids developed larger and more powerful skulls and jaws, the arms got smaller to avoid being bitten or torn by other individuals, particularly during group feedings.

Another possibility is that the forelimbs held struggling prey while it was killed by the tyrannosaur&#x27;s enormous jaws. This hypothesis may be supported by biomechanical analysis. &quot;T. rex&quot; forelimb bones exhibit extremely thick cortical bone, which has been interpreted as evidence that they were developed to withstand heavy loads. The biceps brachii muscle of an adult &quot;T. rex&quot; was capable of lifting by itself; other muscles such as the brachialis would work along with the biceps to make elbow flexion even more powerful. The M. biceps muscle of &quot;T. rex&quot; was 3.5 times as powerful as the human equivalent. A &quot;T. rex&quot; forearm had a limited range of motion, with the shoulder and elbow joints allowing only 40 and 45 degrees of motion, respectively. In contrast, the same two joints in &quot;Deinonychus&quot; allow up to 88 and 130 degrees of motion, respectively, while a human arm can rotate 360 degrees at the shoulder and move through 165 degrees at the elbow. The heavy build of the arm bones, strength of the muscles, and limited range of motion may indicate a system evolved to hold fast despite the stresses of a struggling prey animal. In the first detailed scientific description of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; forelimbs, paleontologists Kenneth Carpenter and Matt Smith dismissed notions that the forelimbs were useless or that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was an obligate scavenger.

The idea that the arms served as weapons when hunting prey have also been proposed by Steven M. Stanley, who suggested that the arms were used for slashing prey, especially by using the claws to rapidly inflict long, deep gashes to its prey. This was dismissed by Padian, who argued that Stanley based his conclusion on incorrectly estimated forelimb size and range of motion.

===Thermoregulation===
&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, like most dinosaurs, was long thought to have an ectothermic (&quot;cold-blooded&quot;) reptilian metabolism. The idea of dinosaur ectothermy was challenged by scientists like Robert T. Bakker and John Ostrom in the early years of the &quot;Dinosaur Renaissance&quot;, beginning in the late 1960s. &quot;T. rex&quot; itself was claimed to have been endothermic (&quot;warm-blooded&quot;), implying a very active lifestyle. Since then, several paleontologists have sought to determine the ability of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; to regulate its body temperature. Histological evidence of high growth rates in young &quot;T. rex&quot;, comparable to those of mammals and birds, may support the hypothesis of a high metabolism. Growth curves indicate that, as in mammals and birds, &quot;T. rex&quot; growth was limited mostly to immature animals, rather than the indeterminate growth seen in most other vertebrates.

Oxygen isotope ratios in fossilized bone are sometimes used to determine the temperature at which the bone was deposited, as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature. In one specimen, the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a temperature difference of no more than between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg. This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that &quot;T. rex&quot; maintained a constant internal body temperature (homeothermy) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals. Other scientists have pointed out that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the fossils today does not necessarily represent the same ratio in the distant past, and may have been altered during or after fossilization (diagenesis). Barrick and Showers have defended their conclusions in subsequent papers, finding similar results in another theropod dinosaur from a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time (&quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;). Ornithischian dinosaurs also showed evidence of homeothermy, while varanid lizards from the same formation did not. In 2022, Wiemann and colleagues used a different approach—the spectroscopy of lipoxidation signals, which are byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation and correlate with metabolic rates—to show that various dinosaur genera including &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had endothermic metabolisms, on par with that of modern birds and higher than that of mammals. They also suggested that such a metabolism was ancestrally common to all dinosaurs.

Even if &quot;T. rex&quot; does exhibit evidence of homeothermy, it does not necessarily mean that it was endothermic. Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy, as in some living sea turtles. Similar to contemporary crocodilians, openings (dorsotemporal fenestrae) in the skull roofs of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; may have aided thermoregulation.

===Soft tissue===

In the March 2005 issue of &quot;Science&quot;, Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University and colleagues announced the recovery of soft tissue from the marrow cavity of a fossilized leg bone from a &quot;T. rex&quot;. The bone had been intentionally, though reluctantly, broken for shipping and then not preserved in the normal manner, specifically because Schweitzer was hoping to test it for soft tissue. Designated as the Museum of the Rockies specimen 1125, or MOR 1125, the dinosaur was previously excavated from the Hell Creek Formation. Flexible, bifurcating blood vessels and fibrous but elastic bone matrix tissue were recognized. In addition, microstructures resembling blood cells were found inside the matrix and vessels. The structures bear resemblance to ostrich blood cells and vessels. Whether an unknown process, distinct from normal fossilization, preserved the material, or the material is original, the researchers do not know, and they are careful not to make any claims about preservation. If it is found to be original material, any surviving proteins may be used as a means of indirectly guessing some of the DNA content of the dinosaurs involved, because each protein is typically created by a specific gene. The absence of previous finds may be the result of people assuming preserved tissue was impossible, therefore not looking. Since the first, two more tyrannosaurs and a hadrosaur have also been found to have such tissue-like structures. Research on some of the tissues involved has suggested that birds are closer relatives to tyrannosaurs than other modern animals. The original endogenous chemistry was also found in MOR 1125 based on preservation of elements associated with bone remodeling and redeposition (sulfur, calcium, zinc), which showed that the bone cortices are similar to those of extant birds.

In studies reported in &quot;Science&quot; in April 2007, Asara and colleagues concluded that seven traces of collagen proteins detected in purified &quot;T. rex&quot; bone most closely match those reported in chickens, followed by frogs and newts. The discovery of proteins from a creature tens of millions of years old, along with similar traces the team found in a mastodon bone at least 160,000 years old, upends the conventional view of fossils and may shift paleontologists&#x27; focus from bone hunting to biochemistry. Until these finds, most scientists presumed that fossilization replaced all living tissue with inert minerals. Paleontologist Hans Larsson of McGill University in Montreal, who was not part of the studies, called the finds &quot;a milestone&quot;, and suggested that dinosaurs could &quot;enter the field of molecular biology and really slingshot paleontology into the modern world&quot;.

The presumed soft tissue was called into question by Thomas Kaye of the University of Washington and his co-authors in 2008. They contend that what was really inside the tyrannosaur bone was slimy biofilm created by bacteria that coated the voids once occupied by blood vessels and cells. The researchers found that what previously had been identified as remnants of blood cells, because of the presence of iron, were actually framboids, microscopic mineral spheres bearing iron. They found similar spheres in a variety of other fossils from various periods, including an ammonite. In the ammonite, they found the spheres in a place where the iron they contain could not have had any relationship to the presence of blood. Schweitzer has strongly criticized Kaye&#x27;s claims and argues that there is no reported evidence that biofilms can produce branching, hollow tubes like those noted in her study. San Antonio, Schweitzer and colleagues published an analysis in 2011 of what parts of the collagen had been recovered, finding that it was the inner parts of the collagen coil that had been preserved, as would have been expected from a long period of protein degradation. Other research challenges the identification of soft tissue as biofilm and confirms finding &quot;branching, vessel-like structures&quot; from within fossilized bone.

===Speed===

Scientists have produced a wide range of possible maximum running speeds for &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;: mostly around , but as low as and as high as , though it running this speed is very unlikely. &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was a bulky and heavy carnivore so it is unlikely to run very fast at all compared to other theropods like &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; or &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;. Researchers have relied on various estimating techniques because, while there are many tracks of large theropods walking, none showed evidence of running.

A 2002 report used a mathematical model (validated by applying it to three living animals: alligators, chickens, and humans; and eight more species, including emus and ostriches) to gauge the leg muscle mass needed for fast running (over ). Scientists who think that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was able to run point out that hollow bones and other features that would have lightened its body may have kept adult weight to a mere or so, or that other animals like ostriches and horses with long, flexible legs are able to achieve high speeds through slower but longer strides. Proposed top speeds exceeded for &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, but were deemed infeasible because they would require exceptional leg muscles of approximately 40–86% of total body mass. Even moderately fast speeds would have required large leg muscles. If the muscle mass was less, only for walking or jogging would have been possible. Holtz noted that tyrannosaurids and some closely related groups had significantly longer distal hindlimb components (shin plus foot plus toes) relative to the femur length than most other theropods, and that tyrannosaurids and their close relatives had a tightly interlocked metatarsus (foot bones). The third metatarsal was squeezed between the second and fourth metatarsals to form a single unit called an arctometatarsus. This ankle feature may have helped the animal to run more efficiently. Together, these leg features allowed &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; to transmit locomotory forces from the foot to the lower leg more effectively than in earlier theropods. 
Additionally, a 2020 study indicates that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and other tyrannosaurids were exceptionally efficient walkers. Studies by Dececchi et al., compared the leg proportions, body mass, and the gaits of more than 70 species of theropod dinosaurs including &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and its relatives. The research team then applied a variety of methods to estimate each dinosaur&#x27;s top speed when running as well as how much energy each dinosaur expended while moving at more relaxed speeds such as when walking. Among smaller to medium-sized species such as dromaeosaurids, longer legs appear to be an adaptation for faster running, in line with previous results by other researchers. But for theropods weighing over , top running speed is limited by body size, so longer legs instead were found to have correlated with low-energy walking. The results further indicate that smaller theropods evolved long legs as a means to both aid in hunting and escape from larger predators while larger theropods that evolved long legs did so to reduce the energy costs and increase foraging efficiency, as they were freed from the demands of predation pressure due to their role as apex predators. Compared to more basal groups of theropods in the study, tyrannosaurs like &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; itself showed a marked increase in foraging efficiency due to reduced energy expenditures during hunting or scavenging. This in turn likely resulted in tyrannosaurs having a reduced need for hunting forays and requiring less food to sustain themselves as a result. Additionally, the research, in conjunction with studies that show tyrannosaurs were more agile than other large-bodied theropods, indicates they were quite well-adapted to a long-distance stalking approach followed by a quick burst of speed to go for the kill. Analogies can be noted between tyrannosaurids and modern wolves as a result, supported by evidence that at least some tyrannosaurids were hunting in group settings.

A study published in 2021 by Pasha van Bijlert et al., calculated the preferred walking speed of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, reporting a speed of . While walking, animals reduce their energy expenditure by choosing certain step rhythms at which their body parts resonate. The same would have been true for dinosaurs, but previous studies did not fully account for the impact the tail had on their walking speeds. According to the authors, when a dinosaur walked, its tail would slightly sway up and down with each step as a result of the interspinous ligaments suspending the tail. Like rubber bands, these ligaments stored energy when they are stretched due to the swaying of the tail. Using a 3-D model of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; specimen Trix, muscles and ligaments were reconstructed to simulate the tail movements. This results in a rhythmic, energy-efficient walking speed for &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; similar to that seen in living animals such as humans, ostriches and giraffes.

A 2017 study estimated the top running speed of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; as , speculating that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; exhausted its energy reserves long before reaching top speed, resulting in a parabola-like relationship between size and speed. Another 2017 study hypothesized that an adult &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was incapable of running due to high skeletal loads. Using a calculated weight estimate of 7 tons, the model showed that speeds above would have probably shattered the leg bones of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. The finding may mean that running was also not possible for other giant theropod dinosaurs like &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;, &quot;Mapusaurus&quot; and &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;.
However, studies by Eric Snively and colleagues&quot;,&quot; published in 2019 indicate that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and other tyrannosaurids were more maneuverable than allosauroids and other theropods of comparable size due to low rotational inertia compared to their body mass combined with large leg muscles. As a result, it is hypothesized that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was capable of making relatively quick turns and could likely pivot its body more quickly when close to its prey, or that while turning, the theropod could &quot;pirouette&quot; on a single planted foot while the alternating leg was held out in a suspended swing during a pursuit. The results of this study potentially could shed light on how agility could have contributed to the success of tyrannosaurid evolution.

===Possible footprints===

Rare fossil footprints and trackways found in New Mexico and Wyoming that are assigned to the ichnogenus &quot;Tyrannosauripus&quot; have been attributed to being made by &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, based on the stratigraphic age of the rocks they are preserved in. The first specimen, found in 1994 was described by Lockley and Hunt and consists of a single, large footprint. Another pair of ichnofossils, described in 2021, show a large tyrannosaurid rising from a prone position by rising up using its elbows in conjunction with the pads on their feet to stand. These two unique sets of fossils were found in Ludlow, Colorado and Cimarron, New Mexico. Another ichnofossil described in 2018, perhaps belonging to a juvenile &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; or the dubious genus &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; was uncovered in the Lance Formation of Wyoming. The trackway itself offers a rare glimpse into the walking speed of tyrannosaurids, and the trackmaker is estimated to have been moving at a speed of , significantly faster than previously assumed for estimations of walking speed in tyrannosaurids.

=== Brain and senses ===

A study conducted by Lawrence Witmer and Ryan Ridgely of Ohio University found that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; shared the heightened sensory abilities of other coelurosaurs, highlighting relatively rapid and coordinated eye and head movements; an enhanced ability to sense low frequency sounds, which would allow tyrannosaurs to track prey movements from long distances; and an enhanced sense of smell. A study published by Kent Stevens concluded that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had keen vision. By applying modified perimetry to facial reconstructions of several dinosaurs including &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, the study found that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had a binocular range of 55 degrees, surpassing that of modern hawks. Stevens estimated that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had 13 times the visual acuity of a human and surpassed the visual acuity of an eagle, which is 3.6 times that of a person. Stevens estimated a limiting far point (that is, the distance at which an object can be seen as separate from the horizon) as far as away, which is greater than the that a human can see.

Thomas Holtz Jr. would note that high depth perception of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; may have been due to the prey it had to hunt, noting that it had to hunt ceratopsians such as &quot;Triceratops&quot;, ankylosaurs such as &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, and hadrosaurs. He would suggest that this made precision more crucial for &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; enabling it to, &quot;get in, get that blow in and take it down.&quot; In contrast, &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; had limited depth perception because they hunted large sauropods, which were relatively rare during the time of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;.

Though no &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; sclerotic ring has been found, Kenneth Carpenter estimated its size based on that of &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;. The inferred sclerotic ring for the Stan specimen is ~ in diameter with an internal aperture diameter of ~. Based on eye proportions in living reptiles, this implies a pupil diameter of about , an iris diameter about that of the sclerotic ring, and an eyeball diameter of . Carpenter also estimated an eyeball depth of ~. Based on these calculations, the f-number for Stan&#x27;s eye is 3–3.8; since diurnal animals have f-numbers of 2.1 or higher, this would indicate that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had poor low-light vision and hunted during the day.

&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had very large olfactory bulbs and olfactory nerves relative to their brain size, the organs responsible for a heightened sense of smell. This suggests that the sense of smell was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The sense of smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that &quot;T. rex&quot; had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.

Somewhat unusually among theropods, &quot;T. rex&quot; had a very long cochlea. The length of the cochlea is often related to hearing acuity, or at least the importance of hearing in behavior, implying that hearing was a particularly important sense to tyrannosaurs. Specifically, data suggests that &quot;T. rex&quot; heard best in the low-frequency range, and that low-frequency sounds were an important part of tyrannosaur behavior. A 2017 study by Thomas Carr and colleagues found that the snout of tyrannosaurids was highly sensitive, based on a high number of small openings in the facial bones of the related &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; that contained sensory neurons. The study speculated that tyrannosaurs might have used their sensitive snouts to measure the temperature of their nests and to gently pick up eggs and hatchlings, as seen in modern crocodylians. 
Another study published in 2021 further suggests that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had an acute sense of touch, based on neurovascular canals in the front of its jaws, which it could utilize to better detect and consume prey. The study, published by Kawabe and Hittori et al., suggests that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; could also accurately sense slight differences in material and movement, allowing it to utilize different feeding strategies on different parts of its prey&#x27;s carcasses depending on the situation. The sensitive neurovascular canals of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; also likely were adapted to performing fine movements and behaviors such as nest building, parental care, and other social behavior such as intraspecific communication. The results of this study also align with results made in studying the related tyrannosaurid &quot;Daspletosaurus horneri&quot; and the allosauroid &quot;Neovenator&quot;, which have similar neurovascular adaptations, suggesting that the faces of theropods were highly sensitive to pressure and touch. However, a more recent study reviewing the evolution of the trigeminal canals among sauropsids notes that a much denser network of neurovascular canals in the snout and lower jaw is more commonly encountered in aquatic or semiaquatic taxa (e.g., &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, &quot;Halszkaraptor&quot;, &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot;), and taxa that developed a rhamphotheca (e.g., &quot;Caenagnathasia&quot;), while the network of canals in &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; appears simpler, though still more derived than in most ornithischians, and overall 
terrestrial taxa such as tyrannosaurids and &quot;Neovenator&quot; may have had average facial sensitivity for non-edentulous terrestrial theropods, although further research is needed. The neurovascular canals in &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; may instead have supported soft tissue structures for thermoregulation or social signaling, the latter of which could be confirmed by the fact that the neurovascular network of canals may have changed during ontogeny.

A study by Grant R. Hurlburt, Ryan C. Ridgely and Lawrence Witmer obtained estimates for Encephalization Quotients (EQs), based on reptiles and birds, as well as estimates for the ratio of cerebrum to brain mass. The study concluded that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had the relatively largest brain of all adult non-avian dinosaurs with the exception of certain small maniraptoriforms (&quot;Bambiraptor&quot;, &quot;Troodon&quot; and &quot;Ornithomimus&quot;). The study found that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;&#x27;s relative brain size was still within the range of modern reptiles, being at most 2 standard deviations above the mean of non-avian reptile EQs. The estimates for the ratio of cerebrum mass to brain mass would range from 47.5 to 49.53 percent. According to the study, this is more than the lowest estimates for extant birds (44.6 percent), but still close to the typical ratios of the smallest sexually mature alligators which range from 45.9–47.9 percent. Other studies, such as those by Steve Brusatte, indicate the encephalization quotient of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was similar in range (2.0–2.4) to a chimpanzee (2.2–2.5), though this may be debatable as reptilian and mammalian encephalization quotients are not equivalent.

=== Social behavior ===

Philip J. Currie suggested that Tyrannosaurus may have been pack hunters, comparing &quot;T. rex&quot; to related species &quot;Tarbosaurus bataar&quot; and &quot;Albertosaurus sarcophagus&quot;, citing fossil evidence that may indicate gregarious (describing animals that travel in herds or packs) behavior. A find in South Dakota where three &quot;T. rex&quot; skeletons were in close proximity may suggest the formation of a pack. Cooperative pack hunting may have been an effective strategy for subduing prey with advanced anti-predator adaptations which pose potential lethality such as &quot;Triceratops&quot; and &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;.

Currie&#x27;s pack-hunting &quot;T. rex&quot; hypothesis has been criticized for not having been peer-reviewed, but rather was discussed in a television interview and book called &quot;Dino Gangs&quot;. The Currie theory for pack hunting by &quot;T. rex&quot; is based mainly by analogy to a different species, &quot;Tarbosaurus bataar&quot;. Evidence of gregariousness in &quot;T. bataar&quot; itself has not been peer-reviewed, and to Currie&#x27;s own admission, can only be interpreted with reference to evidence in other closely related species. According to Currie gregariousness in &quot;Albertosaurus sarcophagus&quot; is supported by the discovery of 26 individuals with varied ages in the Dry Island bonebed. He ruled out the possibility of a predator trap due to the similar preservation state of individuals and the near absence of herbivores.

Additional support of tyrannosaurid gregariousness can be found in fossilized trackways from the Upper Cretaceous Wapiti Formation of northeastern British Columbia, Canada, left by three tyrannosaurids traveling in the same direction. According to scientists assessing the Dino Gangs program, the evidence for pack hunting in &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; is weak and based on group skeletal remains for which alternate explanations may apply (such as drought or a flood forcing dinosaurs to die together in one place). Others researchers have speculated that instead of large theropod social groups, some of these finds represent behavior more akin to Komodo dragon-like mobbing of carcasses, even going as far as to say true pack-hunting behavior may not exist in any non-avian dinosaurs due to its rarity in modern predators.

Evidence of intraspecific attack was found by Joseph Peterson and his colleagues in the juvenile &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; nicknamed Jane. Peterson and his team found that Jane&#x27;s skull showed healed puncture wounds on the upper jaw and snout which they believe came from another juvenile &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. Subsequent CT scans of Jane&#x27;s skull would further confirm the team&#x27;s hypothesis, showing that the puncture wounds came from a traumatic injury and that there was subsequent healing. The team would also state that Jane&#x27;s injuries were structurally different from the parasite-induced lesions found in Sue and that Jane&#x27;s injuries were on its face whereas the parasite that infected Sue caused lesions to the lower jaw. Pathologies of other &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; specimens have been suggested as evidence of conspecific attack, including &quot;Wyrex&quot; with a hole penetrating its jugual and severe trauma on its tail that shows signs of bone remodeling (not regrowth).

===Feeding strategies===

Most paleontologists accept that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was both an active predator and a scavenger like most large carnivores. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, &quot;T. rex&quot; was most likely an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, armored herbivores like ceratopsians and ankylosaurs, and possibly sauropods. Enamel δ44/42Ca values also suggest the possibility that &quot;T. rex&quot; occasionally fed on carcasses of marine reptiles and fish washed up on the shores of the Western Interior Seaway. A study in 2012 by Karl Bates and Peter Falkingham found that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had the most powerful bite of any terrestrial animal that has ever lived, finding an adult &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; could have exerted 35,000 to 57,000 N (7,868 to 12,814 lbf) of force in the back teeth. Even higher estimates were made by Mason B. Meers in 2003. This allowed it to crush bones during repetitive biting and fully consume the carcasses of large dinosaurs. Stephan Lautenschlager and colleagues calculated that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was capable of a maximum jaw gape of around 80 degrees, a necessary adaptation for a wide range of jaw angles to power the creature&#x27;s strong bite.

A debate exists, however, about whether &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was primarily a predator or a pure scavenger. The debate originated in a 1917 study by Lambe which argued that large theropods were pure scavengers because &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument disregarded the fact that theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; most scientists have speculated that it was a predator; like modern large predators it would readily scavenge or steal another predator&#x27;s kill if it had the opportunity.

Paleontologist Jack Horner has been a major proponent of the view that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was not a predator at all but instead was exclusively a scavenger. He has put forward arguments in the popular literature to support the pure scavenger hypothesis:

* Tyrannosaur arms are short when compared to other known predators. Horner argues that the arms were too short to make the necessary gripping force to hold on to prey. Other paleontologists such as Thomas Holtz Jr. argued that there are plenty of modern-day predators that do not use their forelimbs to hunt such as wolves, hyenas, and secretary birds as well as other extinct animals thought to be predators that would not have used their forelimbs such as phorusrhacids.
* Tyrannosaurs had large olfactory bulbs and olfactory nerves (relative to their brain size). These suggest a highly developed sense of smell which could sniff out carcasses over great distances, as modern vultures do. Research on the olfactory bulbs of dinosaurs has shown that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled dinosaurs.
* Tyrannosaur teeth could crush bone, and therefore could extract as much food (bone marrow) as possible from carcass remnants, usually the least nutritious parts. Karen Chin and colleagues have found bone fragments in coprolites (fossilized feces) that they attribute to tyrannosaurs, but point out that a tyrannosaur&#x27;s teeth were not well adapted to systematically chewing bone like hyenas do to extract marrow.
* Since at least some of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;″s potential prey could move quickly, evidence that it walked instead of ran could indicate that it was a scavenger. On the other hand, recent analyses suggest that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, while slower than large modern terrestrial predators, may well have been fast enough to prey on large hadrosaurs and ceratopsians.

Other evidence suggests hunting behavior in &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. The eye sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned so that the eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. It is not obvious why natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators.
A skeleton of the hadrosaurid &quot;Edmontosaurus annectens&quot; has been described from Montana with healed tyrannosaur-inflicted damage on its tail vertebrae. The fact that the damage seems to have healed suggests that the &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot; survived a tyrannosaur&#x27;s attack on a living target, i.e. the tyrannosaur had attempted active predation. Despite the consensus that the tail bites were caused by &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, there has been some evidence to show that they might have been created by other factors. For example, a 2014 study suggested that the tail injuries might have been due to &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot; individuals stepping on each other, while another study in 2020 backs up the hypothesis that biomechanical stress is the cause for the tail injuries. There is also evidence for an aggressive interaction between a &quot;Triceratops&quot; and a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; in the form of partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a &quot;Triceratops&quot; brow horn and squamosal (a bone of the neck frill); the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. It is not known what the exact nature of the interaction was, though: either animal could have been the aggressor. Since the &quot;Triceratops&quot; wounds healed, it is most likely that the &quot;Triceratops&quot; survived the encounter and managed to overcome the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. In a battle against a bull &quot;Triceratops&quot;, the &quot;Triceratops&quot; would likely defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; using its sharp horns. Studies of Sue found a broken and healed fibula and tail vertebrae, scarred facial bones and a tooth from another &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; embedded in a neck vertebra, providing evidence for aggressive behavior. Studies on hadrosaur vertebrae from the Hell Creek Formation that were punctured by the teeth of what appears to be a late-stage juvenile &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; indicate that despite lacking the bone-crushing adaptations of the adults, young individuals were still capable of using the same bone-puncturing feeding technique as their adult counterparts.

&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; may have had infectious saliva used to kill its prey, as proposed by William Abler in 1992. Abler observed that the (tiny protuberances) on the cutting edges of the teeth are closely spaced, enclosing little chambers. These chambers might have trapped pieces of carcass with bacteria, giving &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; a deadly, infectious bite much like the Komodo dragon was thought to have. Jack Horner and Don Lessem, in a 1993 popular book, questioned Abler&#x27;s hypothesis, arguing that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;″s tooth serrations as more like cubes in shape than the serrations on a Komodo monitor&#x27;s teeth, which are rounded.

&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, and most other theropods, probably primarily processed carcasses with lateral shakes of the head, like crocodilians. The head was not as maneuverable as the skulls of allosauroids, due to flat joints of the neck vertebrae.

====Cannibalism====
Evidence also strongly suggests that tyrannosaurs were at least occasionally cannibalistic. &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; itself has strong evidence pointing towards it having been cannibalistic in at least a scavenging capacity based on tooth marks on the foot bones, humerus, and metatarsals of one specimen. Fossils from the Fruitland Formation, Kirtland Formation (both Campanian in age) and the Maastrichtian aged Ojo Alamo Formation suggest that cannibalism was present in various tyrannosaurid genera of the San Juan Basin. The evidence gathered from the specimens suggests opportunistic feeding behavior in tyrannosaurids that cannibalized members of their own species. A study from Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 has been put forward as evidence of cannibalism in the genus &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. They studied some &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; specimens with tooth marks in the bones, attributable to the same genus. The tooth marks were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed it would be difficult to reach down to bite in the feet of a rival, making it more likely that the bitemarks were made in a carcass. As the bitemarks were made in body parts with relatively scantly amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was feeding on a cadaver in which the more fleshy parts already had been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism.

=== Parenting ===
While there is no direct evidence of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; raising their young (the rarity of juvenile and nest Tyrannosaur fossils has left researchers guessing), it has been suggested by some that like its closest living relatives, modern archosaurs (birds and crocodiles) &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; may have protected and fed its young. Crocodilians and birds are often suggested by some paleontologists to be modern analogues for dinosaur parenting. Direct evidence of parental behavior exists in other dinosaurs such as &quot;Maiasaura peeblesorum&quot;, the first dinosaur to have been discovered to raise its young, as well as more closely related Oviraptorids, the latter suggesting parental behavior in theropods.

===Pathology===

In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries. Of the 81 &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; foot bones examined in the study, one was found to have a stress fracture, while none of the 10 hand bones were found to have stress fractures. The researchers found tendon avulsions only among &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. An avulsion injury left a divot on the humerus of Sue the &quot;T. rex&quot;, apparently located at the origin of the deltoid or teres major muscles. The presence of avulsion injuries being limited to the forelimb and shoulder in both &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and &quot;Allosaurus&quot; suggests that theropods may have had a musculature more complex than and functionally different from those of birds. The researchers concluded that Sue&#x27;s tendon avulsion was probably obtained from struggling prey. The presence of stress fractures and tendon avulsions, in general, provides evidence for a &quot;very active&quot; predation-based diet rather than obligate scavenging.

A 2009 study showed that smooth-edged holes in the skulls of several specimens might have been caused by &quot;Trichomonas&quot;-like parasites that commonly infect birds. According to the study, seriously infected individuals, including &quot;Sue&quot; and MOR 980 (&quot;Peck&#x27;s Rex&quot;), might therefore have died from starvation after feeding became increasingly difficult. Previously, these holes had been explained by the bacterious bone infection Actinomycosis or by intraspecific attacks. A subsequent study found that while trichomoniasis has many attributes of the model proposed (osteolytic, intra oral) several features make the assumption that it was the cause of death less supportable by evidence. For example, the observed sharp margins with little reactive bone shown by the radiographs of &quot;Trichomonas&quot;-infected birds are dissimilar to the reactive bone seen in the affected &quot;T. rex&quot; specimens. Also, trichomoniasis can be very rapidly fatal in birds (14 days or less) albeit in its milder form, and this suggests that if a &quot;Trichomonas&quot;-like protozoan is the culprit, trichomoniasis was less acute in its non-avian dinosaur form during the Late Cretaceous. Finally, the relative size of this type of lesions is much larger in small bird throats, and may not have been enough to choke a &quot;T. rex&quot;. A more recent study examining the pathologies concluded that the osseous alteration observed most closely resembles those around healing human cranial trepanations and healing fractures in the Triassic reptile &quot;Stagonolepis,&quot; in the absence of infection. The possible cause may instead have been intraspecific combat.

One study of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; specimens with tooth marks in the bones attributable to the same genus was presented as evidence of cannibalism. Tooth marks in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, may indicate opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by combat with another &quot;T. rex&quot;. Other tyrannosaurids may also have practiced cannibalism.

==Paleoecology==

&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; lived during what is referred to as the Lancian faunal stage (Maastrichtian age) at the end of the Late Cretaceous. &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; ranged from Canada in the north to at least New Mexico in the south of Laramidia. During this time &quot;Triceratops&quot; was the major herbivore in the northern portion of its range, while the titanosaurian sauropod &quot;Alamosaurus&quot; &quot;dominated&quot; its southern range. &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; remains have been discovered in different ecosystems, including inland and coastal subtropical, and semi-arid plains.

Several notable &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; remains have been found in the Hell Creek Formation. During the Maastrichtian this area was subtropical, with a warm and humid climate. The flora consisted mostly of angiosperms, but also included trees like dawn redwood (&quot;Metasequoia&quot;). Archosaurs discovered from this formation include the ceratopsians &quot;Leptoceratops&quot;, &quot;Torosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Triceratops&quot;, the hadrosaurid &quot;Edmontosaurus annectens&quot;, the parksosaurid &quot;Thescelosaurus&quot;, the ankylosaurs &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; and &quot;Denversaurus&quot;, the pachycephalosaurs &quot;Pachycephalosaurus&quot; and &quot;Sphaerotholus&quot;, the paravian theropods &quot;Acheroraptor&quot; and &quot;Pectinodon&quot;, other maniraptoran theropods &quot;Anzu&quot;, &quot;Eoneophron&quot;, &quot;Trierarchuncus&quot; and indeterminate ornithomimids, and the pterosaur &quot;Infernodrakon&quot;.

Another formation with &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; remains is the Lance Formation of Wyoming. This has been interpreted as a bayou environment similar to today&#x27;s Gulf Coast. The fauna was very similar to Hell Creek, but with &quot;Struthiomimus&quot; replacing its relative &quot;Ornithomimus&quot;. The small ceratopsian &quot;Leptoceratops&quot; also lived in the area.

In its southern range, specifically based on remains discovered from the North Horn Formation of Utah, &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; lived alongside the titanosaur &quot;Alamosaurus&quot;, the ceratopsid &quot;Torosaurus&quot; and the indeterminate troodontids and hadrosaurids. &quot;Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis&quot; from the McRae Group of New Mexico coexisted with the ceratopsid &quot;Sierraceratops&quot; and possibly the titanosaur &quot;Alamosaurus&quot;. Potential remains identified as cf. &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; have also been discovered from the Javelina Formation of Texas, where the remains of the titanosaur &quot;Alamosaurus&quot;, the ceratopsid &quot;Bravoceratops&quot;, the pterosaurs &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; and &quot;Wellnhopterus&quot;, and possible species of troodontids and hadrosaurids are found. Its southern range is thought to have been dominated by semi-arid inland plains, following the probable retreat of the Western Interior Seaway as global sea levels fell.

&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; may have also inhabited Mexico&#x27;s Lomas Coloradas Formation in Sonora. Though skeletal evidence is lacking, six shed and broken teeth from the fossil bed have been thoroughly compared with other theropod genera and appear to be identical to those of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. If true, the evidence indicates the range of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was possibly more extensive than previously believed. It is possible that tyrannosaurs were originally Asian species, migrating to North America before the end of the Cretaceous period.

===Population estimates===

According to studies published in 2021 by Charles Marshall et al., the total population of adult &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; at any given time was perhaps 20,000 individuals, with computer estimations also suggesting a total population no lower than 1,300 and no higher than 328,000. The authors themselves suggest that the estimate of 20,000 individuals is probably lower than what should be expected, especially when factoring in that disease pandemics could easily wipe out such a small population. Over the span of the genus&#x27; existence, it is estimated that there were about 127,000 generations and that this added up to a total of roughly 2.5 billion animals until their extinction.

In the same paper, it is suggested that in a population of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; adults numbering 20,000, the number of individuals living in an area the size of California could be as high as 3,800 animals, while an area the size of Washington D.C. could support a population of only two adult &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. The study does not take into account the number of juvenile animals in the genus present in this population estimate due to their occupation of a different niche than the adults, and thus it is likely the total population was much higher when accounting for this factor. Simultaneously, studies of living carnivores suggest that some predator populations are higher in density than others of similar weight (such as jaguars and hyenas, which are similar in weight but have vastly differing population densities). Lastly, the study suggests that in most cases, only one in 80 million &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; would become fossilized, while the chances were likely as high as one in every 16,000 of an individual becoming fossilized in areas that had more dense populations.

Meiri (2022) questioned the reliability of the estimates, citing uncertainty in metabolic rate, body size, sex and age-specific survival rates, habitat requirements and range size variability as shortcomings Marshall et al. did not take into account. The authors of the original publication replied that while they agree that their reported uncertainties were probably too small, their framework is flexible enough to accommodate uncerainty in physiology, and that their calculations do not depend on short-term changes in population density and geographic range, but rather on their long-term averages. Finally, they remark that they did estimate the range of reasonable survivorship curves and that they did include uncertainty in the time of onset of sexual maturity and in the growth curve by incorporating the
uncertainty in the maximum body mass.

==Cultural significance==

Since it was first described in 1905, &quot;T. rex&quot; has become the most widely recognized dinosaur species in popular culture. It is the only dinosaur that is commonly known to the general public by its full scientific name (binomial name) and the scientific abbreviation &quot;T. rex&quot; has also come into wide usage. Robert T. Bakker notes this in &quot;The Dinosaur Heresies&quot; and explains that, &quot;a name like ″&quot;T. rex&quot;″ is just irresistible to the tongue.&quot;

<text>The Tollund Man (died 405–384 BC) is a naturally mummified corpse of a man who lived during the 5th century BC, during the period characterised in Scandinavia as the Pre-Roman Iron Age. He was found in 1950, preserved as a bog body near Silkeborg on the Jutland peninsula in Denmark. The man&#x27;s physical features were so well preserved that he was mistaken for a recent murder victim. Twelve years before his discovery, another bog body, Elling Woman, was found in the same bog.

The cause of death has been determined to be by hanging. There is insufficient evidence to determine if the reason for the killing was a ritual sacrifice or a punitive execution.

==Discovery==
On 8 May 1950, peat cutters Viggo and Emil Hojgaard discovered a corpse in the peat layer of the Bjældskovdal peat bog, west of Silkeborg, Denmark, which was so well preserved that they at first believed they had discovered a recent murder victim.

The Tollund Man lay away from firm ground, buried under of peat, his body arranged in a fetal position. He wore a pointed skin cap of sheepskin and wool, fastened under his chin by a hide thong, and a smooth hide belt around his waist. Additionally, a noose made of plaited animal hide was drawn tight around his neck and trailed down his back. Other than these, the body was naked. His hair was cropped so short as to be almost entirely hidden by his cap. There was short stubble ( in length) on his chin and upper lip, suggesting that he was usually clean-shaven, but had not shaved on the day of his death. The Tollund Man was approximately 40 years old. The Tollund Man&#x27;s last meal consisted of a porridge with barley, flax, wild weed seeds, and some fish.

==Scientific examination and conclusions==
Radiocarbon dating of Tollund Man indicated that he died circa 405–380 BC. The preserved tender soft tissues of his body are the consequence of the acid in the peat, along with the lack of oxygen underneath the surface and the cold climate of the Nordic countries. The acid in the peat, needed for the preservation of a human body, is caused by a bryophyte named &quot;Sphagnum&quot;. &quot;Sphagnum&quot; fights against degradation due to resistant phenolic compounds contained in their cell walls. Due to the acidity of peat, bones are typically dissolved rather than preserved.

Scientists conducted an isotope analysis of the element strontium to measure the exact quantities to get an accurate idea of where he may have travelled before his death. They took samples from his femur and hair to compare. They were only able to measure up to a year because of his hair being short. The results contained only small differences in strontium isotope proportions, suggesting that he spent his final year in Denmark, and that he may have moved at least in his last six months.

Examinations and X-rays showed that the man&#x27;s head was undamaged, and his heart, lungs and liver were well preserved. The Silkeborg Museum estimated his age as approximately 40 years and height at , a relatively short stature even for the time. It is likely that the body had shrunk in the bog.

On the initial autopsy report in 1950, doctors concluded that Tollund Man died by hanging rather than strangulation. The rope left visible furrows in the skin beneath his chin and at the sides of his neck. There was no mark, however, at the back of the neck where the knot of the noose would have been located. After a re-examination in 2002, forensic scientists found further evidence to support these initial findings. Although the cervical vertebrae were undamaged (these vertebrae are often damaged as a result of hanging), radiography showed that the tongue was distended—an indication of death by hanging.

The stomach and intestines were examined and tests were carried out on their contents. Scientists identified the man&#x27;s last meal as porridge or gruel made from grains and seeds, both cultivated and wild. Approximately 40 kinds of seeds were identified, but the porridge was primarily composed of four types: barley, flax, false flax (&quot;Camelina sativa&quot;) and knotgrass. From the stage of digestion it was concluded that the man had eaten 12 to 24 hours prior to his death. Porridges were common for people of this time. Because neither meat nor fresh fruit was found in the last meal, it is suggested that the meal was eaten in winter or early spring when these items were not available.

Both feet and the right thumb, being well conserved by the peat, were also preserved in formalin for later examination. In 1976, the Danish police made a fingerprint analysis, making Tollund Man&#x27;s thumbprint one of the oldest prints on record.

==Cause of death==

The reason for Tollund Man&#x27;s death has not been definitively determined. Some scholars believe the man was a ritual sacrifice because of the special treatment of the body: the arranged position of his body, the eyes and mouth being closed and the special meal that had been ingested. However other scholars believe that he was possibly an execution because Germanic tribes buried traitors under piles of sticks.

==Display==
The body is displayed at the Silkeborg Museum in Denmark, although only the head is original. Because conservation techniques for organic material were insufficiently advanced in the early 1950s for the entire body to be preserved, the forensic examiners suggested the head be severed and the rest of the body remain unpreserved. Subsequently, the body was desiccated and the tissue disappeared. In 1987, the Silkeborg Museum reconstructed the body using the skeletal remains as a base. As displayed today, the original head is attached to a replica of the body.

==Other bodies==
In Denmark, more than 500 bog bodies and skeletal remains dating to the Iron Age have been recovered. Specimens from Jutland include the relatively well-preserved Borremose bodies, Huldremose Woman, Grauballe Man on display at Moesgaard Museum near Aarhus, and the similarly conserved Haraldskær Woman. Approximately 30 of these bog bodies are housed and/or displayed in Danish museums for continued research.

==In popular culture==
Nobel Prize-winning Irish poet Seamus Heaney wrote a series of poems inspired by P. V. Glob&#x27;s study of the mummified Iron Age bodies found in Jutland&#x27;s peat bogs, finding contemporary political relevance in the relics of the ritualistic killings. Heaney&#x27;s poem &quot;The Tollund Man&quot;, published in his &quot;Wintering Out&quot; collection, compares the ritual sacrifice to those who died in the sectarian violence of &quot;the Troubles&quot;. Heaney wrote an excerpt from the poem in the Tollund Man exhibit&#x27;s guest book in 1973.

British author Margaret Drabble, in her 1989 novel &quot;A Natural Curiosity&quot;, uses her characters&#x27; obsession with the Tollund Man to provide a satirical criticism of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s modern England.

Tollund Man is featured in several songs: &quot;Tollund Man&quot; (1995) by the American folk band The Mountain Goats and &quot;Curse of the Tollund Man&quot; (2004) by the English rock band The Darkness.

Tollund Man was mentioned in the episode &quot;Mummy in the Maze&quot; of the American television series &quot;Bones&quot; and was also mentioned in the 2016 film &quot;Sacrifice&quot; in which a bog body was found in the Shetland Islands.

He is the subject of the novel &quot;Meet Me at the Museum&quot; by Anne Youngson in which the main characters bond through a shared fascination with the Tollund Man.
