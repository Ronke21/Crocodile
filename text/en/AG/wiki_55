<text>Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 – June 19, 1956) was an American businessman who was the chairman and CEO of IBM. He oversaw the company&#x27;s growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson developed IBM&#x27;s management style and corporate culture from John Henry Patterson&#x27;s training at NCR. He turned the company into a highly effective selling organization, based largely on punched card tabulating machines.

Watson authorized providing Hitler&#x27;s Third Reich with data processing solutions and involved IBM in cooperation with Nazi Germany throughout the 1930s and until the end of World War II, profiting from both the German and American war efforts. A leading self-made industrialist, he was one of the richest men of his time when he died in 1956.

==Early life and career==
Thomas J. Watson was born in Campbell, New York, in the state&#x27;s Southern Tier region, the fifth child and only son of Thomas and Jane Fulton White Watson. His four older siblings were Jennie, Effie, Loua, and Emma. His father farmed and owned a modest lumber business located near Painted Post, a few miles west of Corning. Thomas worked on the family farm in East Campbell and attended the District School Number Five in the late 1870s. As Watson entered his teen years he attended Addison Academy in nearby Addison.

Having given up his first job—teaching—after just one day, Watson took a year&#x27;s course in accounting and business at the Miller School of Commerce in Elmira, New York. He left the school in 1891, taking a job at $6 a week as bookkeeper for Clarence Risley&#x27;s Market in Painted Post. One year later he joined a traveling salesman, George Cornwell, peddling organs and pianos around the farms for William Bronson&#x27;s local hardware store. When Cornwell left, Watson continued alone, earning $10 per week. After two years of this life, he realized he would be earning $70 per week if he were on a commission. His indignation on making this discovery was such that he quit and moved from his familiar surroundings to the relative metropolis of Buffalo.

Watson then spent a very brief period selling sewing machines for Wheeler and Wilson. According to his son Thomas J. Watson Jr.&#x27;s autobiography:
One day my dad went into a roadside saloon to celebrate a sale and had too much to drink. When the bar closed, he found that his entire rig—horse, buggy, and samples—had been stolen. Wheeler and Wilson fired him and dunned him for the lost property. Word got around, of course, and it took Dad more than a year to find another steady job. Watson would later enforce strict rules at IBM against alcohol consumption, even off the job. According to Tom Jr.: This anecdote never made it into IBM lore, which is too bad, because it would have helped explain Father to the tens of thousands of people who had to follow his rules.

Watson&#x27;s next job was peddling shares of the Buffalo Building and Loan Company for a huckster named C. B. Barron, a showman renowned for his disreputable conduct, which Watson deplored. Barron absconded with the commission and the loan funds. Next Watson opened a butcher shop in Buffalo, which soon failed, leaving Watson with no money, no investment, and no job.

==NCR==
Watson had a newly acquired NCR cash register in his butcher shop, for which he had to arrange transfer of its installment payments to the shop&#x27;s new owner. On visiting NCR he met its Buffalo branch manager, John J. Range, and asked him for a job. Determined to join the company, he repeatedly called on Range until, after a number of abortive attempts, he finally was hired in November 1896, as sales apprentice to Range.

Led by John Patterson, NCR was then one of the leading selling organizations, and Range became almost a father figure for Watson and was a model for his sales and management style. Under Range&#x27;s guidance Watson became the most successful salesman in the East, earning $100 per week. In a 1952 interview Watson claimed he learned more from Range than anyone else. Four years later, NCR assigned Watson to run the struggling NCR agency in Rochester, New York. As an agent, he got 35% commission and reported directly to Hugh Chalmers, the second-in-command at NCR. In four years Watson made Rochester effectively an NCR monopoly by using the technique of knocking the main competitor, Hallwood, out of business, sometimes resorting to sabotage of the competitor&#x27;s machines. As a reward, he was called to the NCR head office in Dayton, Ohio.

In 1912, the company was found guilty of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Patterson, Watson, and 26 other NCR executives and managers were convicted for illegal anti-competitive sales practices and were sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Their convictions were unpopular with the public because of the efforts of Patterson and Watson to help those affected by the Great Dayton Flood of 1913, but efforts to have them pardoned by President Woodrow Wilson were unsuccessful. However, their convictions were overturned on appeal in 1915 on the grounds that important defense evidence should have been admitted.

==Head of IBM==
Charles Ranlett Flint, who had engineered the amalgamation (via stock acquisition) forming the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) found it difficult to manage the five companies. He hired Watson as general manager on May 1, 1914, when the five companies had about 1,300 employees. Eleven months later Watson was made President when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved. Within four years revenues had been doubled to $9 million. In 1924, he renamed CTR to International Business Machines. Watson built IBM into such a dominant company that the federal government filed a civil antitrust suit against it in 1952. IBM owned and leased to its customers more than 90 percent of all tabulating machines in the United States at the time. When Watson died in 1956, IBM&#x27;s revenues were $897 million, and the company had 72,500 employees.

Throughout his life, Watson maintained a deep interest in international relations, from both a diplomatic and a business perspective. He was known as US President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s unofficial ambassador in New York and often entertained foreign statesmen. In 1937, he was elected president of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and at that year&#x27;s biennial congress in Berlin stated that the conference keynote would be &quot;World Peace Through World Trade.&quot; That phrase became the slogan of both the ICC and IBM.

===Dealings with Nazi Germany===
In 1937, as President of the International Chamber of Commerce, Watson met Adolf Hitler. During the 1930s, IBM&#x27;s German subsidiary was its most profitable foreign operation, and a 2001 book by Edwin Black, &quot;IBM and the Holocaust&quot;, claims that Watson&#x27;s pursuit of profit led him to personally approve and spearhead IBM&#x27;s strategic technological relationship with Nazi Germany. It describes how IBM provided the tabulating equipment Hitler used to round up the Jews. His Hollerith punch-card machines are in the Holocaust Museum today. The book describes IBM&#x27;s punch cards as &quot;a card with standardized holes&quot;, each representing a different trait of the individual. The card was fed into a &quot;reader&quot; and sorted. Punch cards identified Jews by name. Each one served as &quot;a twentieth-century bar code for human beings&quot;. In particular, critics point to the Order of the German Eagle medal that Watson received at the Berlin ICC meeting in 1937, as evidence that he was being honored for the help that IBM&#x27;s German subsidiary Dehomag (Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen Gesellschaft mbH) and its punch card machines provided the Nazi regime, particularly in the tabulation of census data (which included the location of Jews). Another study argues that Watson believed, perhaps naively, that the medal was in recognition of his years of labor on behalf of global commerce and international peace.[please add a precise citation page]

Because of his strong feelings about the issue, Watson wanted to return his German citation shortly after receiving it. When Secretary of State Hull advised him against that course of action, he gave up the idea until the spring of 1940. Then Hull refused advice, and Watson sent the medal back in June 1940. Dehomag&#x27;s management disapproved of Watson&#x27;s action and considered separating from IBM. This occurred when Germany declared war on the United States in December 1941, and the German shareholders took custody of the Dehomag operation. However, during World War II, IBM subsidiaries in occupied Europe never stopped delivery of punch cards to Dehomag, and documents uncovered show that senior executives at IBM world headquarters in New York took great pains to maintain legal authority over Dehomag&#x27;s operations and assets through the personal intervention of IBM managers in neutral Switzerland, directed via personal communications and private letters, which confirms the close ties between the company’s headquarters and its subsidiaries throughout the war.

===Dealings with the United States===
During this same period, IBM became more deeply involved in the war effort for the U.S., focusing on producing large quantities of data processing equipment for the military and experimenting with analog computers. Watson Sr. also developed the &quot;1% doctrine&quot; for war profits which mandated that IBM receive no more than 1% profit from the sales of military equipment to U.S. Government. Watson was one of the few CEOs to develop such a policy.

In 1941, Watson received the third highest salary and compensation package in the U.S., $517,221, on which he paid 69% in tax.

Watson had a personal interest in the progress of the war. His eldest son, Thomas J. Watson Jr., joined the United States Army Air Corps and became a bomber pilot. He was soon hand-picked to become the assistant and personal pilot for General Follet Bradley, who was in charge of all Lend-Lease equipment supplied to the Soviet Union from the United States. Watson Sr.&#x27;s youngest son, Arthur K. Watson, also joined the military during the conflict.

===Post-World War II===
Watson worked with local leaders to create a college in the Binghamton area, where IBM was founded and had major plants. In 1946, IBM provided land and funding for Triple Cities College, an extension of Syracuse University. Later it became known as Harpur College, and eventually evolved into Binghamton University. 

After World War II, Watson began work to further the extent of IBM&#x27;s influence abroad and in 1949, he created the IBM World Trade Corporation in order to oversee IBM&#x27;s foreign business.

Watson retired in May 1956 and his oldest son, Thomas J. Watson Jr., became IBM&#x27;s CEO. Watson Sr. died on June 19, 1956, in Manhattan, New York City and was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

==Personal life==
Watson married Jeanette Kittredge, from a prominent Dayton, Ohio, railroad family, on April 17, 1913. They had two sons and two daughters.

# Thomas Watson Jr. succeeded his father as IBM chairman and later served as ambassador to the Soviet Union under Jimmy Carter
# Jeanette Watson Irwin married businessman John N. Irwin II, later ambassador to France
# Helen Watson Buckner became an important philanthropist in New York City
# Arthur K. Watson served as president of IBM World Trade Corporation and later, as ambassador to France

As a Democrat (after his criminal indictment by the Taft Administration), Watson was an ardent supporter of Roosevelt. He was one of the most prominent businessmen in the Democratic Party. He was considered Roosevelt&#x27;s strongest supporter in the business community.

Watson served as a powerful trustee of Columbia University from June 6, 1933, until his death. He engineered the selection of Dwight D. Eisenhower as its president and played the central role in convincing Eisenhower to become president of the university. Additionally, he served as a trustee of Lafayette College and is the namesake of Watson Hall, a campus residence hall.

In 1936 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision that IBM, together with Remington Rand, should cease its practice of requiring its customers to buy their punch cards from it alone. The ruling made little difference because IBM was the only effective supplier to the market, and profits continued undiminished.

In 1937, Watson was awarded the Order of the German Eagle by Adolf Hitler. Watson was also president of the International Chamber of Commerce in 1937; the medal was awarded while the ICC was meeting in Germany that year.

In 1939, he received an honorary degree in Doctor of Commercial Science from Oglethorpe University.

In the 1940s, Watson was on the national executive board of the Boy Scouts of America and served for a time as an international Scout commissioner. E. Urner Goodman recounts that the elderly Watson attended an international Scout commissioners&#x27; meeting in Switzerland, where the IBM founder asked not to be put on a pedestal. Before the conference was over, Goodman relates, Watson &quot;... sat by that campfire, in Scout uniform, &#x27;chewing the fat&#x27; like the rest of the boys&quot;. He received the Silver Buffalo Award in 1944. His son, Thomas Jr., later served as national president of the Boy Scouts from 1964 to 1968. He was also inducted into the Steuben County, New York Hall of Fame. Throughout his life Watson continued to own and enjoy the family farm on which he was born. In 1955 he and his wife gave it, along with one million dollars, to the Methodist Church for use as a retreat and conference center, to be named Watson Homestead in memory of his parents. Watson Homestead became independent of the church in 1995, and continues as a conference and retreat center. The one-room school that Watson attended as a child is still on the grounds.

Watson was chairman of the Elmira College centennial committee in 1955 and donated Watson Hall, primarily a music and mathematics academic building.

Watson was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1960) and the American Philosophical Society (1984).

He was posthumously inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1990.

==Famous attribution==
Although Watson is well known for his alleged 1943 statement, &quot;I think there is a world market for maybe five computers,&quot; there is scant evidence he said it. Author Kevin Maney tried to find the origin of the quote, but has been unable to locate any speeches or documents of Watson&#x27;s that contain this, nor are the words present in any contemporary articles about IBM.

One of the first attributions is in the German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; of May 22, 1965, stating that IBM boss Thomas Watson had not been interested in the new machines initially, and when the first commercial calculation behemoths appeared in the early 1950s, filling whole floors with thousands of heat generating vacuum tubes, he estimated the demand by the US economy at a maximum of five.

Later attributions may be found in &quot;The Experts Speak&quot;, a book written by Christopher Cerf and Victor S. Navasky in 1984, however Cerf and Navasky just quote from a book written by Morgan and Langford, &quot;Facts and Fallacies&quot;. Another early article source (May 15, 1985) is a column by Neil Morgan, a &quot;San Diego Evening Tribune&quot; writer who wrote: &quot;Forrest Shumway, chairman of The Signal Cos., doesn&#x27;t make predictions. His role model is Tom Watson, then IBM chairman, who said in 1958: &#x27;I think there is a world market for about five computers. The earliest known citation on the Internet is from 1986 on Usenet in the signature of a poster from Convex Computer Corporation as I think there is a world market for about five computers&#x27; —Remark attributed to Thomas J. Watson (Chairman of the Board of International Business Machines), 1943&quot;. All these early quotes are questioned by Eric Weiss, an editor of the &quot;Annals of the History of Computing&quot; in ACS letters in 1985.

There are documented versions of similar quotes by other people in the early history of the computer. In 1946 Sir Charles Darwin (grandson of the famous naturalist), head of Britain&#x27;s NPL (National Physical Laboratory), where research into computers was taking place, wrote: it is very possible that ... one machine would suffice to solve all the problems that are demanded of it from the whole country.

In 1985 the story was discussed on Usenet (in net.misc), without Watson&#x27;s name being attached. The original discussion has not survived, but an explanation has; it attributes a very similar quote to the Cambridge mathematician Professor Douglas Hartree, around 1951:
I went to see Professor Douglas Hartree, who had built the first differential analyzers in England and had more experience in using these very specialized computers than anyone else. He told me that, in his opinion, all the calculations that would ever be needed in this country could be done on the three digital computers which were then being built—one in Cambridge, one in Teddington, and one in Manchester. No one else, he said, would ever need machines of their own, or would be able to afford to buy them.

Howard H. Aiken made a similar statement in 1952:
Originally one thought that if there were a half dozen large computers in this country, hidden away in research laboratories, this would take care of all requirements we had throughout the country.

The story already had been described as a myth in 1973; the &quot;Economist&quot; quoted a Mr. Maney as &quot;revealing that Watson never made his oft-quoted prediction that there was &#x27;a world market for maybe five computers.

Since the attribution typically is used to demonstrate the fallacy of predictions, if Watson had made such a prediction in 1943, then, as Gordon Bell pointed out in his ACM 50 years celebration keynote, it would have held true for some ten years.

The IBM archives of Frequently Asked Questions notes an inquiry about whether he said in the 1950s that he foresaw a market potential for only five electronic computers. The document says no, but quotes his son and then IBM President Thomas J. Watson Jr. at the annual IBM stockholders meeting, April 28, 1953, as speaking about the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine, which it identifies as &quot;the company&#x27;s first production computer designed for scientific calculations&quot;. He said that &quot;IBM had developed a paper plan for such a machine and took this paper plan across the country to some 20 concerns that we thought could use such a machine. I would like to tell you that the machine rents for between $12,000 and $18,000 a month, so it was not the type of thing that could be sold from place to place. But, as a result of our trip, on which we expected to get orders for five machines, we came home with orders for 18.&quot; Watson Jr. later gave a slightly different version of the story in his autobiography, where he said the initial market sampling indicated 11 firm takers and 10 more prospective orders.

==Famous motto==
&quot;THINK&quot; – Watson began using &quot;THINK&quot; to motivate, or inspire, staff while at NCR and continued to use it at CTR. International Business Machines&#x27;s first U.S. trademark was for the name &quot;THINK&quot; filed as a U.S. trademark on June 6, 1935, with the description &quot;periodical publications&quot;. This trademark was filed fourteen years before the company filed for a U.S. trademark on the name IBM. A biographical article in 1940 noted that &quot;This word is on the most conspicuous wall of every room in every IBM building. Each employee carries a THINK notebook in which to record inspirations. The company stationery, matches, scratch pads all bear the inscription, THINK. A monthly magazine called &#x27;Think&#x27; is distributed to the employees.&quot; THINK remains a part of IBM&#x27;s corporate culture; it was the inspiration behind naming IBM&#x27;s successful line of notebook computers, IBM ThinkPad. In 2007, IBM Mid America Employees Federal Credit Union changed its name to Think Mutual Bank.

<text>The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck (Lo) 12-part comic book storyline written and drawn by Don Rosa, lettered by Todd Klein (American editions), first published by the Danish publisher Egmont in the magazine &quot;Anders And &amp; Co.&quot; from 1992–94 and later in English in &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #285 through #296 (1994–96). It follows the life of Scrooge McDuck from 1877 to 1947, the year of his real-life debut, working in almost every event about his past referenced in stories by Carl Barks.

Rosa earned the Will Eisner Award for Best Serialized Story in 1995 for this story. The trade paperback collection was also a top vote-getter for the Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Award for Favorite Reprint Graphic Novel/Album for 1997.
After being out of print for several years with high demand, the book was reprinted under the BOOM! Studios label in two deluxe hardcover volumes, and again under Fantagraphics Books.

The Finnish composer Tuomas Holopainen released a concept album based on the book, titled &quot;Music Inspired by the Life and Times of Scrooge&quot;. Don Rosa illustrated the cover artwork for the album.

==Chapter list==
===Original Storyline===

===Companion stories===

=== Censorship===

In February 2023, The Walt Disney Company Instated a worldwide ban from reprinting two of Don Rosa&#x27;s duck stories; &quot;The Empire-Builder from Calisota&quot; (listed as &quot;The Richest Duck in the World&quot; in the announcement) and &quot;The Dream of a Lifetime&quot;. Both characters were noted by Rosa to feature the character Bombie the Zombie, who was cursed by a voodoo witch doctor paid by Scrooge, making future collections or reprints of &quot;Lo$&quot; impossible as Rosa views the character to be integral to the story.

==Scrooge McDuck timeline according to Rosa==
*1867: Scrooge was born in Glasgow, Scotland to Fergus McDuck and Downy O&#x27;Drake. He would have two younger sisters, namely Matilda McDuck (born in 1871) and Hortense McDuck (born in 1876).
*1877: Scrooge, age 10, goes into business with a shoeshine kit that Fergus built for him, but his first customer fools him and pays him with an American dime (which was actually a plan of his father&#x27;s). He keeps the dime he cannot spend as his symbol of success.
*1880: Scrooge, age 13, emigrates to the United States. He first meets his uncle, Mississippi riverboater Angus &quot;Pothole&quot; McDuck, and the Beagle Boys, a family of outlaws that remain his enemies for the rest of his life.
*1882: His uncle retires and leaves his riverboat, named &quot;Dilly Dollar&quot;, to Scrooge, now 15 years old. The Beagle Boys destroy the riverboat in an act of revenge. Scrooge decides to try his luck in the American West and later in the year gets hired as a cowboy by cattle baron Murdo MacKenzie (an actual historical figure, one of the many that Scrooge met).
*1883: Scrooge, age 16, becomes a miner searching for silver and copper.
*1885: Scrooge&#x27;s father calls his son back to Scotland on an important family matter. Just a week before he leaves he meets and befriends the millionaire Howard Rockerduck, who had become rich in the California gold rush of 1849. He also meets Howard&#x27;s seven-year-old spoiled son John D. Rockerduck, who will grow up to become one of Scrooge&#x27;s main rivals.
*1886–1889: Scrooge, age 19–22, searches for gold in South Africa (during the Witwatersrand Gold Rush). During his first year there he saves the life of a duck about his age named Flintheart Glomgold, though Scrooge learns his name more than half a century later. A little later they become bitter enemies, and remain as such for the rest of their lives. Glomgold later became the second richest duck in the world.
*1889–1893: Scrooge, age 22–26, returns to the United States to search for gold, most notably near Pizen Bluff, Arizona. He meets many famous historical figures but his search fails.
*1893–1896: Scrooge, age 26–29, goes to Coolgardie, Western Australia to search for gold but his search again fails.
*1896–1899: Scrooge, age 29–32, searches for gold in the Klondike. During his years there he meets the saloon owner, singer and occasional thief &quot;Glittering&quot; Goldie O&#x27;Gilt. He carries a love/hate relationship with her for the rest of his life. His search for gold succeeds.
*1897: Scrooge&#x27;s mother Downy O&#x27;Drake dies, aged 57, in Dismal Downs. Scrooge is now 30.
*1899–1902: Scrooge, at 32, becomes a millionaire and buys a bank in Whitehorse, Yukon. He starts building a small financial empire; by 1902, at 35, he has become a billionaire.
*1902: Scrooge, age 35, returns to Scotland intending to make Castle McDuck at Dismal Downs the heart of his empire, but he soon finds local culture too stagnant and decides to return to America. His sisters Matilda McDuck and Hortense McDuck go to America with him. Also in 1902, Scrooge&#x27;s father Fergus McDuck dies, aged 67, in Dismal Downs. Scrooge, Matilda and Hortense are the last of the McDuck clan. Scrooge settles in the small village of Duckburg, Calisota, United States, which he chose as his home base.
*1909–1930: While his sisters remain in Duckburg and run his empire, Scrooge, age 42–63, travels the world expanding his empire in every continent.
*1930: Scrooge, at 63, becomes the richest duck in the world, but a fight with his family leaves him with no contact with them for the next seventeen years. Note that during this year he met his ten-year-old nephew Donald Duck and his nephew&#x27;s twin sister Della Duck for the first time. (It was possibly the &quot;only&quot; time Scrooge met his niece Della, ignoring the girl completely.)
*1942: Scrooge, age 75, feels depressed and tired and decides to retire.
*1947: Scrooge, age 80, meets his nephew Donald Duck, now age 27, as well as his grandnephews, Della&#x27;s children, Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck, who are under Donald&#x27;s care. He decides to become active again and soon a circle of activities whirl around him as he attracts the attention of relatives, old and new enemies and friends.
*1955: Scrooge, age 88, is reunited and reconciled with his sister Matilda, thanks to Donald (in the story &quot;A Letter from Home&quot;).
*1967: According to Don Rosa&#x27;s unofficial timeline, Scrooge McDuck died at the age of 100 years after a life of adventure.

<text>The Clan McDuck is a fictional Scottish clan of cartoon ducks from which Disney character Scrooge McDuck is descended. Within the Donald Duck universe, the clan is related to the American Duck family through the marriage of Hortense McDuck and Quackmore Duck, Donald and Della Duck&#x27;s parents, giving both of them partial Scottish ancestry.

Clan McDuck was created by American comic book author Carl Barks, who also created the character of Scrooge McDuck. Barks&#x27; 1948 story &quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Secret,&quot; in which Scrooge and his nephews search for hidden treasure in McDuck Castle, introduced the backstory of the clan. Other authors built on Barks&#x27; work, most notably Don Rosa in his 12-part comic saga &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot; (1992–94) which introduced Scrooge&#x27;s immediate family.

==Literary origins==

In the early 1950s, Carl Barks was in his second decade of creating comic book stories starring Donald Duck and his various relatives. He had personally created several of the latter, including cousin Gladstone Gander and uncle Scrooge McDuck, although the specific relationships between them were still uncertain. To better define these relationships, Barks created a version of the McDuck/Duck/Coot family tree for his own personal benefit, incidentally creating several additional characters.

During his retirement, Barks&#x27; stories remained popular and gained him unexpected fame. Barks gave several interviews during which he answered questions about his stories and the characters he had created. In 1981, Barks described his personal version of Donald&#x27;s family tree, which was used by amateur artist Mark Worden in drawing the family tree and including portraits of the characters mentioned. Worden&#x27;s tree was first published in several fanzines, and later in the Disney-licensed &quot;Carl Barks Library&quot;, a ten-volume hardcover collection of Barks&#x27; stories in black-and-white.

In 1987, Don Rosa, a long-time fan of Carl Barks and a personal friend of Mark Worden, started creating his own stories featuring Scrooge McDuck. His stories contained numerous references to older stories by Barks as well as several original ideas. After several years he gained a fan base of his own. In the early 1990s, the Egmont Group, the publishing house employing Rosa, offered him an ambitious assignment: he was to create the definitive version of Scrooge&#x27;s biography and a family tree to accompany it. The project was intended to end decades of contradictions between stories which caused confusion to readers. The project was to become &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;. The family tree accompanying it was first published in Norway on July 3, 1993.

In the process of working on Scrooge&#x27;s biography, Rosa studied Barks&#x27; old stories in detail. Rosa made note of as many clues as he could of Scrooge&#x27;s past given by Barks – which Rosa dubbed &quot;Barksian facts&quot; – and used them to write new stories. Despite the ambitious nature of the project, Rosa himself stressed in the introduction to the book &quot;...this version of Scrooge&#x27;s life is not the &#x27;official&#x27; version – there&#x27;s no particular reason why I (or anyone else) should expect other Duck writers to adhere to my vision of Scrooge&#x27;s history. As carefully and authentically as I sought to construct it, it was never intended to be anything but my personal telling of the life of Scrooge McDuck.&quot;

=== Modern family tree by Carl Barks ===
The family tree below shows the McDuck portion of Donald&#x27;s family tree according to Carl Barks. The chart is based on a 1950s sketch made by Barks for personal use, which was later illustrated by artist Mark Worden in 1981. According to Barks, Matilda McDuck is married to Goosetail Gander, and the couple adopts Donald&#x27;s cousin Gladstone. The character Old &quot;Scotty&quot; McDuck does not appear in any stories, but eventually became Fergus McDuck in Don Rosa&#x27;s stories.





=== Modern family tree by Don Rosa ===
This family tree is based on the work of Don Rosa.






== The seat of Clan McDuck ==
The seat of Clan McDuck is McDuck Castle (alternately called Castle McDuck) which is located in Dismal Downs, somewhere in Rannoch Moor, a non-fictional moorland area in north-central Scotland approximately 100 miles (160 km) north of Glasgow. The nearest village is the fictional MacDuich. The castle usually appears in good condition considering its great age. However, in the Barks story &quot;Hound of the Whiskervilles&quot; (1960) the castle is in ruins.

The comics continuity does not establish when McDuck Castle was built, but it first appears (on the fictional timeline) in 946 when the Saxons laid siege to it. For many centuries the castle served as the home of the clan chief. In 1675, the McDucks were run out of the castle due to the depredations of a &quot;monstrous devil dog&quot; in Dismal Downs, later discovered to be a plot by the rival Clan Whiskerville. At this time, many of the McDucks moved to the village of MacDuich and to Glasgow. Even after their departure, the clan still owned the castle and continued to pay the taxes by pooling their incomes. By 1885, only Fergus and Jake McDuck remain to pay the taxes, but their combined income is not enough, causing the Crown to auction it off. Scrooge then buys the estate, allowing his family to reoccupy the castle. He also hires local dogface Scottie McTerrier as caretaker. Sometime after Scottie&#x27;s death, Scrooge&#x27;s sister Matilda becomes caretaker.

In the &quot;DuckTales&quot; continuity, Castle McDuck was built by Scrooge&#x27;s great-great grandfather Silas who incorporated the castle into an existing Druid stone circle to save on construction costs. This story would date the castle itself to about the 18th century. The Druids, seeking revenge on the McDucks for taking away their sacred meeting place, scared the clan away using trained phosphorescent hounds. Years later, Scrooge returns with Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Webby and uncovers the mystery. Scrooge befriends the Druids and partners with them to turn Castle McDuck into a tourist attraction. Scrooge plans to give a share of the profit to the Druids as reparations for desecrating their stone circle. The story is loosely based on the Barks story &quot;Hound of the Whiskervilles&quot;, which was in turn loosely based on &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;. In the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series, the castle is Clan McDuck&#x27;s ancestral home, as in the comics, and is protected by the spirits of the McDuck ancestors buried there. Scrooge used part of his fortune to purchase and restore the castle as a home for his parents, but because he used discount druid stones, his parents were cursed with immortality and bound to the castle, which appears only once every five years.

The castle appears in the Carl Barks stories &quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Secret&quot; (1948) and &quot;Hound of the Whiskervilles&quot; (1960) and in the Don Rosa stories &quot;The Last of the Clan McDuck&quot; (1992), &quot;The New Laird of Castle McDuck&quot; (1993), &quot;The Billionaire of Dismal Downs&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Other Secret or A Letter from Home&quot; (2004). Other comic book authors have also used the castle, such as Andrew Galton, Dave Angus, and Vicar in &quot;The Crying Monster&quot; (1982). In the 1987 TV series &quot;DuckTales&quot;, McDuck Castle appears in the episode &quot;The Curse of Castle McDuck&quot;. In the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series, the castle is the setting of the episodes &quot;The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!&quot; and &quot;The Fight for Castle McDuck!&quot;

== Tartan of Clan McDuck ==

The fictional McDuck tartan first appears in 1960 in &quot;Hound of the Whiskervilles&quot;. However, the coloring of the tartan was not Barks&#x27; decision but that of colorists working for Dell Comics, which first published the story; subsequent publications showed the tartan having differing colors. When Don Rosa decided to include the tartan in his stories, he used the original coloring of green and orange. Nevertheless, some European publications have still shown variations in Rosa&#x27;s color scheme. (See Sir Roast McDuck&#x27;s tam o&#x27; shanter cap in the illustration at the top of the page, which was first published in France.) The old clansmen seen on &quot;DuckTales&quot; wear a green and orange tartan, but of a slightly different design from that of the comics.

== Ancient McDucks ==
=== Scrooge Shah and Prince Donduk ===
Scrooge Shah was the last king of Sagbad and the earliest known ancestor of Scrooge McDuck. A young King Khan Khan (2050 BC-1967 BC) sacked the city of Sagbad in 2033 BC, but Scrooge Shah and Prince Donduk, his heir apparent, managed to escape. Khan Khan lost their tracks, but would much later locate their distant descendants. Prince Donduk also has three unnamed nephews who resemble Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Scrooge Shah features in the story &quot;King Scrooge the First&quot; (1967) by Carl Barks and Tony Strobl.

==Postclassical McDucks ==
=== Eider McDuck ===
Sir Eider McDuck (880-946; from earlier Eider MacDuich) was the chief of Clan McDuck during an Anglo-Saxon invasion in 946 (despite England and Scotland signing a peace treaty in 945). Eider was killed during the Anglo-Saxons&#x27; siege of McDuck Castle after his serfs abandoned him. He had refused to buy them arrows because they were too expensive, and only paid his serfs, collectively, 30 copper pieces an hour. Eider McDuck is first mentioned in Barks&#x27; &quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Secret&quot; (1948).

Friar Juicy McDuck (910-971) and Sir Smokt McDuck (b. 931) are buried in the McDuck cemetery as seen in the Carl Barks painting &quot;Dubious Doings at Dismal Downs&quot;.

Eider makes a cameo appearance in the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series episode, &quot;The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!&quot;, both as a statue in front of the titular Castle McDuck and as a ghost.

=== Slye MacDuich ===
Slye MacDuich who was enlisted as a spy for Malcolm II of Scotland, in 1018, during his conquest of the Angles.

=== Quackly McDuck ===
Sir Quackly McDuck (1010-1057; from earlier Quackly MacDuich) was clan chief when King Macbeth was killed in 1057. That same year, Macbeth offered Quackly a treasure chest in exchange for his support in the ongoing war for the throne. Quackly agreed and served the king during the war, but became obsessed with protecting the treasure, eventually trapping himself inside the castle walls with it. Quackly and his treasure became a McDuck legend, and it is believed that his ghost continues to protect the treasure and the castle.

In 1877, Quackly&#x27;s ghost saves a young Scrooge McDuck from the Whiskervilles of Dismal Downs. Without revealing his true identity, he suggests to Scrooge that he travel to America and work for his Uncle Pothole, thus serving as the catalyst for all of Scrooge&#x27;s adventures. In 1885, Quackly again tries to save Scrooge, but his action unintentionally brings about Scrooge&#x27;s temporary death. In heaven, Quackly is reprimanded by his relatives for interfering in earthly events. Quackly McDuck is first mentioned in &quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Secret&quot; (1948) by Carl Barks, and first appears in &quot;The Last of the Clan McDuck&quot; (1994) by Don Rosa.

=== Murdoch McDuck ===
Sir Murdoch McDuck (?-1066; from earlier Murdoch MacDuich) was a businessman who patented the longbow. Most notably in 1066, when the Normans invaded England, he had the latter sign a contract with him so they would have enough longbows to fight off the invaders. However, they did not have enough arrows as Sir Murdoch charged extra for them. He is also the last of the Dark Ages McDucks and the one who modernized their family name &quot;MacDuich&quot; to the more familiar &quot;McDuck&quot;. He only appears in the unfinished sketch-only story &quot;The History of the Clan McDuck&quot; (written and drawn approx. in 1992 by Don Rosa, but not released until December 2011), which was meant to serve as a prologue to &quot;The Last of the Clan McDuck&quot; before it was scrapped.

In the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series episode, &quot;The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!&quot;, Downy McDuck relates Murdoch&#x27;s history (which remains intact) to Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck, and Webby Vanderquack. His longbow is later used as a clue that the boys use to uncover the mystery behind their mother, Della&#x27;s, disappearance.

=== Stuft McDuck ===
Sir Stuft McDuck (1110-1175) was a successful chief of Clan McDuck who oversaw a period of prosperity.

=== Roast McDuck ===
Sir Roast McDuck (1159-1205) succeeded his father, Stuft McDuck, as clan chief, while Clan McDuck was one of the richest clans in Scotland. However, in 1189, Roast offered much of the clan&#x27;s wealth to the king of Scotland, William the Lion, after William asked for his help in paying tribute to Richard I of England. This act of patriotic generosity led to financial ruin for the clan. Aside from this imprudence, Roast is primarily remembered for his gluttony. In 1205, he raided the king&#x27;s pantry and ate himself to death. Roast&#x27;s memorial suit of armor displayed in Castle McDuck holds a knife and fork in its hands. The character is first mentioned in &quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Secret&quot; (1948) by Carl Barks. He has a small speaking role in &quot;The Last of the Clan McDuck&quot; (1994), but makes his first appearance in &quot;The New Laird of Castle McDuck&quot;.

His ghost makes a cameo appearance in the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series episode, &quot;The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!&quot;

=== Swamphole McDuck ===
Sir Swamphole McDuck (1190-1260) succeeded his father, Roast McDuck, as clan chief and inherited its financial problems. In 1220, Swamphole sealed the dungeon of Castle McDuck, which he claimed was an attempt to decrease maintenance costs. He did, however, create secret passageways in the castle leading to the dungeons. (These passageways would later be useful during subsequent sieges.) After his death in 1260, Swamphole was not buried in the clan cemetery; rather, his skeleton was placed inside his memorial suit of armor, which was placed in Castle McDuck. Swamphole McDuck is first mentioned in &quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Secret&quot; by Carl Barks. In &quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Other Secret or A Letter from Home&quot; (2004) by Don Rosa, it is revealed that Swamphole sealed the dungeons not to reduce maintenance costs, but to conceal a treasure.

In the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series episode, &quot;The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!&quot;, he is stated to be a treasure hunter (like Scrooge) who constructed secret passageways underneath Castle McDuck and let loose a demon dog to protect his treasure. His ghost later appears to ward off said demon dog alongside the ghosts of several of his family members.

=== Donald McDuck ===
Sir Donald McDuck, nicknamed &quot;Black Donald&quot; because of his foul temper, is said to have invented golf, the hammer throw, and the caber toss in 1440. His temper while playing golf resulted in James II of Scotland outlawing the sport. Black Donald is mentioned in &quot;The History of the Clan McDuck&quot; by Don Rosa.

In the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series episode &quot;The Missing Links of Moorshire!&quot;, Scrooge McDuck relates the story of how &quot;Black Donald&quot; McDuck invented golf and subsequently got it banned due to his temper to Dewey, Louie, and Webby before participating in a golf tournament in Scotland.

=== Simon McDuck ===
Sir Simon McDuck (1437-1509) was the treasurer of the Knights Templar and hid their treasure beneath McDuck Castle. He is mentioned in &quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Other Secret or A Letter from Home&quot; (2004) by Don Rosa.

In the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series episode, &quot;The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck&quot;, Scrooge McDuck states Simon was the &quot;accountant&quot; to the Knights Templar who had stolen and hidden their treasure somewhere underneath Castle McDuck, and he had returned to his father Fergus to reluctantly ask for his help in finding it since he knows where it is. His ghost appears later in the episode to stop a ghost hound from attacking Scrooge&#x27;s grandnephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

== Early modern McDucks ==
=== Malcolm &quot;Matey&quot; McDuck ===
Malcolm &quot;Matey&quot; McDuck (1530-1564?) was a McDuck relative who settled in England and is suggested to be a previous incarnation of Scrooge McDuck. Malcolm served in the English Navy, and in 1563 he became first mate of the frigate HMS &quot;Falcon Rover&quot;, serving under Captain Loyal Hawk. The &quot;Falcon Rover&quot; raided Spanish targets in the Caribbean Sea between 1563 and 1564. Also serving on the &quot;Falcon Rover&quot; was the boatswain, Pintail Duck, whose descendant, Quackmore Duck, would marry Malcolm&#x27;s descendant, Hortense McDuck. The two were the parents of twins Donald and Della Duck.

Malcolm is said to have lost his life on 9 December 1564 when the Spanish fleet sank HMS &quot;Falcon Rover&quot;. However, in 1579, Malcolm was also said to have commanded the newly founded Fort Drakeborough, an establishment that in 1818 was taken over by Cornelius Coot and renamed Fort Duckburg. Malcolm first appears in &quot;Back to Long Ago!&quot; (1956) by Carl Barks.

He is mentioned on Webby Vanderquack&#x27;s family chart in the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series.

=== Locksley McDuck ===
Locksley McDuck was an 18th-century McDuck relative. Sometime after 1707, he became an associate of Scottish outlaw Rob Roy MacGregor who is characterized as a noble thief who would &quot;rob from the rich to give to the poor&quot;. Locksley&#x27;s alliance with MacGregor would come to an end after Locksley was unable to &quot;give to the poor&quot; after having robbed the rich. He is mentioned in &quot;The History of The Clan McDuck&quot; by Don Rosa. His name is derived from the English village of Loxley, the traditional birthplace of Robin Hood.

=== Hugh &quot;Seafoam&quot; McDuck ===
Captain Hugh &quot;Seafoam&quot; McDuck (1710-1776) was a McDuck relative who settled in Glasgow in 1727, as the clan had been driven from their ancestral home of Dismal Downs in 1675. Hugh turned to the sea for a living and became a successful merchant. He obtained his own ship, the &quot;Golden Goose&quot;, and became known by the nickname &quot;Seafoam&quot;.

In 1753, Seafoam McDuck signed a contract with Swindle McSue to deliver a cargo of horseradish to Jamaica. But McSue sabotaged the &quot;Golden Goose&quot; and the ship sank before reaching Jamaica. Upon returning to Scotland, Seafoam McDuck learned that his contract with McSue contained fine print stating that if the shipment was not completed, McDuck would forfeit all his possessions to McSue. Seafoam escaped with nothing but the clothes on his back, a silver pocket watch, and the golden dentures in his mouth. It is later presumed that Seafoam was involved in the American Revolutionary War and died in 1776. His descendant Quagmire McDuck inherited the silver pocket watch. Seafoam McDuck first appears in &quot;The Horseradish Story&quot; (1953) by Carl Barks. According to Don Rosa, he is Scrooge&#x27;s great-great-great-grandfather. 

His ghost makes a cameo appearance in the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series episode, &quot;The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck&quot;.

=== Potcrack McDuck ===
Potcrack McDuck was a member of Clan McDuck, who invented steam-powered bagpipes in 1767, his invention later inspired James Watt to create the steam engine.

===Silas McDuck ===
Silas McDuck was a member of Clan McDuck and Scrooge&#x27;s
great-great-grandfather. He was very wealthy and built Castle McDuck for his large family to live in. Despite the ground being cursed by druids, Silas finished the constructions and the McDucks moved in, only to be scared away by the frightening Hound of Castle McDuck. Spending what little he had left from erecting the castle, Silas built Cottage McDuck, where the family lived in poverty until Scrooge left for America.

== Modern McDucks (1st generation) ==
=== Dingus McDuck ===
&quot;Dirty&quot; Dingus McDuck, was Scrooge&#x27;s paternal grandfather. He worked as a coal miner, married Molly Mallard, and had three sons – Angus, Fergus, and Jake. He appeared in Don Rosa&#x27;s illustrated family tree, but has not appeared in any comic book stories. A 1960s story by Bob Gregory and Tony Strobl identifies Scrooge&#x27;s grandfather as Titus McDuck.

In the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series episode, &quot;The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck&quot;, Dingus is revealed to have had an antagonistic relationship with his son, Fergus (not unlike that of the latter and his son, Scrooge). In fact, knowing he would seek out Simon McDuck&#x27;s treasure, he left his son a note telling him to work hard and not accept hand-outs inside a hidden chamber underneath Castle McDuck.

=== Molly Mallard ===
Molly McDuck (née Mallard) was the wife of Dingus McDuck, Scrooge&#x27;s paternal grandmother, and the mother of Angus, Fergus, and Jake McDuck. Her first and only appearance was in an illustrated family tree created by Don Rosa; she has not appeared in any stories. Coincidentally, her maiden name is the same as the title character of &quot;Darkwing Duck.&quot;

Her ghost makes a cameo appearance in the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series&#x27; episode, &quot;The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!&quot;

=== Quagmire McDuck ===
Quagmire McDuck was Dingus McDuck&#x27;s brother and Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s paternal great uncle. He inherited a silver watch from his ancestor Hugh &quot;Seafoam&quot; McDuck and passed it on to his nephew Fergus. After his death, Quagmire&#x27;s estate remained unclaimed. Quagmire appears in the Carl Barks story &quot;The Heirloom Watch&quot; (1955).

His ghost makes a cameo appearance in the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series episode, &quot;The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck&quot;.

== Modern McDucks (2nd generation) ==
=== Angus &quot;Pothole&quot; McDuck ===
Angus &quot;Pothole&quot; McDuck (born 1829) is the first child of Dingus and Molly McDuck, and is Scrooge&#x27;s paternal uncle. Angus was born in Glasgow in 1829. He was first mentioned in &quot;The Great Steamboat Race&quot; by Carl Barks and later appeared in person in a handful of stories by Don Rosa.

Angus migrated to the United States during the late 1840s. In 1850 he was working as a cabin boy in the Mississippi riverboat &quot;Drennan Whyte&quot; when it sank. He was the only survivor. He continued working on Mississippi riverboats and he had obtained his own by 1861, named &quot;Cotton Queen&quot;. Around the time of the American Civil War (1861–1865) he became quite successful as a river boater. Soon after the end of the war in 1865 he and fellow river boater Porker Hogg became the co-owners of Cornpone Gables, a Southern plantation that had gone bankrupt. The two were unable to settle their differences and they decided to have a riverboat race in 1870 to decide who would be the owner. Both riverboats sank. Porker had two more riverboats but Angus spent the next ten years as a professional card player.

In 1880, in a poker game with Porker, Angus won the rights to one of his rival&#x27;s riverboats, named &quot;Dilly Dollar&quot;. Porker soon lost his other riverboat to Blackheart Beagle and his sons, the first generation of the Beagle Boys, a family of outlaws, and retired. Angus on the other hand hired his nephew Scrooge McDuck and a penniless inventor named Ratchet Gearloose as his crew. Business wasn&#x27;t going well and Angus decided to retire in 1882. He left his riverboat to his nephew and settled down in New Orleans.

He became the writer of a series of dime novels under the title &quot;The Master of Mississippi&quot;, based on a highly exaggerated description of his life. His dime novels became very popular and to have more material to add he occasionally traveled through the country. In the story &quot;The Vigilante of Pizen Bluff&quot; by Don Rosa, he is seen appearing at Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West. After the show&#x27;s money is stolen by the Dalton Gang, Angus rides out with Bill, Scrooge, P. T. Barnum, Annie Oakley, and Geronimo to stop the bandits.

Angus&#x27; exact date of death is unknown.

In 1955, Porker&#x27;s nephew, Horseshoe Hogg, and Scrooge McDuck would bring their uncles&#x27; steamboats back to the surface to finish the race for Cornpone Gables. Scrooge won, only to learn that 85 years of disuse made the mansion so fragile that he accidentally destroyed it with a sneeze.

A character based on Angus named &quot;Catfish&quot; McDuck appears in the 1987 &quot;DuckTales&quot; episode, &quot;Once Upon a Dime&quot;, voiced by Peter Renaday,

=== Fergus McDuck ===
Fergus McDuck (1835–1902) is the second child of Dingus and Molly McDuck and the father of Scrooge McDuck. As such he is a prominent character in &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;.

He was born in Glasgow in 1835 to Dingus McDuck and Molly Mallard, who were both working as coal miners at the time. He spent most of his life as a mill worker.

According to a story by William Van Horn, Fergus at some point had a short marriage with an unidentified woman, with whom he had the son Rumpus McFowl. He later married Downy O&#x27;Drake, his wife in Rosa&#x27;s stories, who became the mother of three of his children – Scrooge, Matilda, and Hortense.

The rest of Fergus&#x27; biography is shown in &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;. In 1877 he encouraged his son to work to have his own money. Scrooge&#x27;s obvious intelligence, skill at hard work and ambition made his father believe that Scrooge would be able to restore Clan McDuck to its former glory. In the story &quot;Of Ducks, Dimes, and Destinies&quot;, it is revealed that Scrooge&#x27;s Number One Dime came from Fergus, who gave it to the man who used it to pay Scrooge for shining his shoes.

In 1885 the Clan&#x27;s hereditary lands would have been seized due to Fergus&#x27; inability to pay his taxes. But Scrooge spent his savings at the time ($10,000) to pay the taxes and become the new owner of their lands. While Scrooge was away, Fergus and his family moved back to Castle McDuck, abandoned for centuries in Dismal Downs. The family continued to work to pay for the taxes, and Scrooge sent them money he earned while traveling. Fergus became a widower in 1897.

Scrooge became rich in the Klondike and returned to Scotland in 1902 as a billionaire. Scrooge&#x27;s intention was originally to settle in Dismal Downs, but he quickly changed his mind and decided to settle in the United States. He wanted to take his family with him. His sisters accepted, but Fergus decided to stay. He died during the night, aged 72, and was re-united with his wife Downy and the rest of the McDuck Clan as his three children left Scotland.

In Don Rosa&#x27;s &quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Other Secret or A Letter from Home&quot; (2004), it&#x27;s revealed that Fergus tried to find the Knights Templar treasure hidden in the castle McDuck by one of his ancestors, a Knight himself. Even though Fergus decided not to tell Scrooge about the treasure, he learns about it through other ways and, like Matilda McDuck, thinks Fergus kept the secret from him because he disapproved of Scrooge. In the middle of their way to the treasure, Scrooge, Matilda and Scrooge&#x27;s nephews find a letter from Fergus, who believed Scrooge would eventually find it, revealing the reason he hid the secret from Scrooge is that Scrooge would feel better building his own fortune instead of inheriting one.

Fergus appears in the classic 1987 &quot;DuckTales&quot; episode, &quot;Once Upon a Dime&quot;, which explores Scrooge&#x27;s history. Here he is referred to as &quot;McPapa.&quot; Fergus&#x27; name and image are also present in the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series, which draws heavily from the comics. He later appears in the episode &quot;The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!&quot;, having survived to the present day due to Scrooge rebuilding Castle McDuck using magic stones that granted his parents immortality. Scrooge and Fergus&#x27; relationship is initially tense, with the latter expressing apparent disapproval of the former; though in reality, he was upset because Scrooge had not been a part of his life. They later reconcile after Fergus reveals he was the one who gave Scrooge his Number One Dime, via Burt the Ditch Digger, in order to give him the gift of &quot;self-reliance&quot; since he was unable to afford a proper gift for him. Alan Young, who voiced Scrooge in the original series, was meant to provide Fergus&#x27;s voice, but passed away before he could record any dialogue and the role went to Graham McTavish.

In the 1993 NES game &quot;DuckTales 2&quot;, Scrooge and his nephews found a piece of a treasure map that led to the lost treasure of a character named Fergus McDuck. However, this Fergus is not Scrooge&#x27;s father but Scrooge&#x27;s great-great-uncle.

=== Downy O&#x27;Drake ===
Downy McDuck (née O&#x27;Drake; 1840–1897) is Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s mother. She was created by Don Rosa and first appears in &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;. She is of Irish origin and was born in 1840.

She was a very devoted housewife and mother. She settled in Castle McDuck at Dismal Downs, Clan McDuck&#x27;s old castle, along with her family in 1885. She died in 1897, and was buried in the McDucks&#x27; cemetery. She later appeared to her husband Fergus at his own passing, and together they joined various McDuck ancestors.

Downy&#x27;s image and name are also present in the 2017 incarnation of &quot;DuckTales&quot;, usually alongside those of her husband. Alongside Fergus, she makes a physical appearance in the episode, &quot;The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!&quot;, voiced by Ashley Jensen.

=== Jake McDuck ===
Jake McDuck (1832–?) is Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s uncle. He was mentioned in the story &quot;A Christmas for Shacktown&quot; (1952) by Carl Barks, in which Donald Duck dresses up as Jake in an attempt to trick Scrooge into giving money to charity.

The character was later used by Don Rosa, and appears in three of twelve original chapters of Rosa&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;. He lived in the same house as his brother Fergus McDuck and helped Fergus and his wife Downy O&#x27;Drake to raise their children. He settled in McDuck castle along with his brother in 1885. However, it appears that by 1902, Jake was no longer living there.

According to Rosa&#x27;s sketches and timelines, Jake was born in 1832 to coal miners Dingus McDuck and Molly Mallard, and grew up to become a stockyard hand in Glasgow. His date of death is unknown, but it appears that both Scrooge and Donald believed him to be alive in 1952.

== Modern McDucks (3rd generation)==
=== Scrooge McDuck ===

Scrooge McDuck (1867, according to Don Rosa) is the first child of Fergus and Downy McDuck and is the protagonist of most stories involving the Clan McDuck. Unlike his two younger sisters, he remains unmarried, but in &quot;The Last Adventure!&quot; of the DuckTales series, Webby is revealed to actually be Scrooge&#x27;s daughter via cloning and her original F.O.W.L. given name is April. This is in a reboot/alternate universe. In the original Webby and April are two separate characters and neither are related to Scrooge. Also, he comes to maintain close relationships with his nephew Donald Duck and his grandnephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck.

=== Matilda McDuck ===
Matilda McDuck (born 1871) is one of Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s two younger sisters, the maternal aunt of his niece and nephew, Donald Duck and Della Duck and the maternal grandaunt of Huey, Dewey, and Louie. She was first mentioned in Carl Barks&#x27; 1950s sketch for a Duck family tree, where she was shown to have adopted Gladstone Gander. The Matilda McDuck character was dropped in Barks&#x27; 1991 Duck Family Tree sketch (where Gladstone Gander is the biological grandson of Grandma Duck and not related to Scrooge), but Don Rosa picked up the name, and used Matilda McDuck as a prominent character in &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;.

Matilda McDuck was born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1871 to Fergus McDuck and Downy O&#x27;Drake. She is the younger sister of Scrooge McDuck. She has a younger sister named Hortense.

In contrast to Scrooge and Hortense&#x27;s fiery tempers, she usually had a calm demeanor. In 1902 Scrooge returned to Scotland and took both of his younger sisters with him to go to America. When he established his base in Duckburg, Calisota, United States he left Matilda and Hortense to run his empire from 1902 to 1930. In the meantime he traveled the world expanding his financial empire. In 1930, a conflict with Scrooge ended all relationships between him and his family, and his younger sisters are believed to have left Duckburg.

In the story &quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Other Secret or A Letter from Home&quot; (2004), Don Rosa used Matilda McDuck in a non-&quot;Life and Times&quot; story for the first time. In this story, it is shown that she was hired by her nephew Donald Duck (son of Hortense) to tend the McDuck castle in Scotland. The story shows the reconciliation between Matilda and Scrooge. It is suggested that Donald deliberately set them up for a reunion. Unfortunately, he did not get the thanks he expected until Scrooge admitted his shameful actions and regrets. This is the first time Huey, Dewey, and Louie met their maternal great aunt. In that story, Scrooge returns to McDuck Castle for another treasure and learns from Matilda that his family already knew about the treasure but their father Fergus decided not to tell Scrooge about it. Both Scrooge and Matilda thought that was because of Fergus&#x27; disapproval of Scrooge&#x27;s greedy ways but after finding a letter on the way for the treasure (hence the other title &quot;A Letter from Home&quot;) they learn Fergus&#x27;s real motive was that he thought Scrooge would feel better building his own fortune instead of simply inheriting one.

Matilda, while trying to leave the castle, mentions Hortense. However, in the commentary in the American printing of the story, Don Rosa states that he was prevented from using Hortense because he would have had to explain why she had abandoned her family. So Hortense&#x27;s fate remains a mystery. In the notes to the Danish publication of the story (Hall of Fame - Don Rosa Book 10), it is stated that the publisher decided that Hortense was &quot;officially dead&quot;.

Matilda is usually drawn with a flower on her hat, which loses a petal in each panel in which she appears.

Don Rosa has suggested that Matilda McDuck could have married the well-known Disney character Ludwig Von Drake.

A picture of Matilda appears in the 2017 DuckTales series pilot episode, &quot;Woo-oo!&quot;, as part of Webby&#x27;s research on Scrooge&#x27;s family. She later appears in person in the episode &quot;The Fight for Castle McDuck!&quot;, voiced by Michelle Gomez.

=== Hortense McDuck ===
Hortense Duck (née &quot;McDuck&quot;; b. 1876) was introduced as a relatively well-connected member of her family. A daughter-in-law of Humperdink Duck and Elvira Duck, a younger sister to Matilda McDuck and Scrooge McDuck, wife to Quackmore Duck, sister-in-law of Goostave Gander and Daphne Duck, aunt to Gladstone Gander, mother of Della Duck and Donald Duck, and finally maternal grandmother of Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

Hortense was born in 1876 in Glasgow, Scotland as the youngest child of Fergus McDuck and Downy O&#x27;Drake. In Barks&#x27; tree, her oldest brother was Scrooge McDuck and her older sister Matilda McDuck. Some non-Barks writers gave Scrooge two half-brothers, Rumpus McFowl and Gideon McDuck, though these do not appear in Barks&#x27; conception of the family. De&#x27; Paperoni is a twin of Scrooge in a story. Jake McDuck, her paternal uncle, was also living with them.

Hortense was born in a working class family living in relative poverty. In 1877 her ten-year-old brother Scrooge started working as a shoe polisher in an effort to help support his family. At the time Hortense was merely an infant sucking on her thumb. She observed from a distance with her father and sister while her brother earned the number one dime. Scrooge would spend some of his leisure time with his younger sisters, and occasionally repaired their dolls. Otherwise Hortense spent most of her time clinging to her older sister.

By 1880, Scrooge came to realize that his earnings were not enough despite his hard work and efforts. He emigrated to the United States in hopes of earning his own fortune. He was hired as a cabin boy on a merchant ship heading to New Orleans. Scrooge noted that Hortense&#x27;s &quot;Bye, Scroogey&quot; were her first spoken words. Before that, all she could say was &quot;glxblt&quot;.

From an early age it was obvious Hortense had a fairly nasty temper combined with considerable strength, and on at least one occasion (in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, Chapter 10) she has been called a spitfire. In 1882, Scrooge was hired as a cowboy by Murdo MacKenzie. To do this he had to ride Widow Maker, a mare who had already managed to dispose of five other cowboys. Scrooge soon managed to become her rider although he never really managed to tame her. He renamed the horse Hortense after his spirited six-year-old sister. The latter found this idea unflattering at best.

In 1885, the Clan McDuck&#x27;s hereditary lands were in danger of being seized due to her father being unable to pay taxes. The lands also included Dismal Downs, the Clan&#x27;s castle which had been abandoned since 1675. The Whiskervilles, traditional enemies of the McDucks since the 15th century, planned to gain ownership of the lands and were already trying to plunder the castle and its graveyard in search of old relics and treasure. Fergus and Jake guarded the Castle in order to stop them. Nine-year-old Hortense offered to help them and proved more effective in conflict than either of the elder McDucks. The Whiskervilles came to fear her.

In 1902 Scrooge McDuck returned to Scotland to fetch Hortense and their sister Matilda McDuck. When Scrooge established Duckburg, Calisota as his home base he started journeying the world trying to expand his financial empire. One of her proudest moments was when she single-handedly caused the entire US military to flee Killmotor Hill armed only with a broom and her bad temper, much to the shame of the current president, Theodore Roosevelt, and the fear of the soldiers. From 1902 until 1930, she and Matilda ran Scrooge&#x27;s empire from his home base while he was away. During these years Hortense met her boyfriend, Quackmore Duck, whom she married in 1920. Later the same year she gave birth to twins. Her son was named Donald Duck and her daughter Della Duck. Of the two only Donald inherited his mother&#x27;s temper. A fight with Scrooge in 1930 ended all relationships between Scrooge and his family and she retired.

Scrooge may have claimed that he is the last McDuck, as he is the only male left. Hortense and Matilda changed their names to Duck after marriage, so, technically, Scrooge is the last McDuck.

Hortense is mentioned and pictured in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; 2017 premier &quot;Woo-oo!&quot;, where Webby Vanderquack cites her as a connecting link between the triplets and Scrooge.

In a 2024 comic, Hortense was revealed to be an adventurer and a scientist, who studied apes, until she disappeared, Scrooge traveled to Africa to investigate, however she still wasn&#x27;t found, but Donald read her letters she wrote to him over the years. She was hinted to still be alive, with her brother saying she could return.

=== Rumpus McFowl ===
Rumpus McFowl was created by William Van Horn and introduced as a lazy and greedy cousin of Scrooge McDuck. It was soon revealed that he was in fact Scrooge&#x27;s half-brother, born during his mother&#x27;s brief marriage to Fergus McDuck.

Rumpus McFowl is a tall, obese duck who wears a green coat and a black bowler hat. He is not ashamed to take advantage of Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s money at every chance he gets, citing his relationship to Scrooge as the reason. He has never been shown to do any work. Scrooge views Rumpus as a useless good-for-nothing and tries his best to get rid of his company.

=== Gideon McDuck ===

Gideon McDuck (&quot;Gedeone de&#x27; Paperoni&quot; in original Italian) is Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s moralistic brother, and is a recurring character in Italian comic stories; in those stories, Gideon is the editor of the newspaper &quot;The County Conscience&quot;, the most credible newspaper in Duckburg. The newspaper is originally known as &quot;Il Grillo Parlante&quot;, which is the Italian name of the Pinocchio character The Talking Cricket and its Disney version Jiminy Cricket; a statue of Jiminy is therefore present in Gideon&#x27;s office. Gideon also has an antagonistic relationship with his brother Scrooge.

The character was created by Romano Scarpa, and first appeared in the story &quot;Paperino e i gamberi in salmì&quot; (1956). The character&#x27;s debut story is the only one that was printed in the United States, as it was published in 2015 under the title &quot;Shellfish Motives&quot;.

Gideon&#x27;s existence is inconsistent with a statement made in Carl Barks&#x27;s &quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Secret&quot;. In this story, Scrooge states that he is the last of the Clan McDuck, which would mean that he couldn&#x27;t have a living sibling. However, Gideon is not the only living relative of Scrooge to carry the surname &quot;McDuck&quot;, and therefore cause the same inconsistency with Barks&#x27;s story; others include his sister Matilda and first cousin Douglas. In the American translation of &quot;Shellfish Motives&quot; Gideon is said to be younger than Scrooge, while the original version doesn&#x27;t specify which one of them is younger.

=== Douglas McDuck ===
Douglas McDuck is a cousin of Scrooge who has appeared in several Danish Disney comic stories. He looks like Scrooge not only in appearance but also in temperament. He is so incredibly stingy that he considers Scrooge a spendthrift, often criticizing a frustrated Scrooge for not being &quot;McDuck-like&quot; enough. Douglas is, however, hopeless at finding and identifying gold; he generally lives a rustic life in mining country, locating only fool&#x27;s gold and earning a modest living. In the story &quot;Smarter Than The Toughies&quot;, Douglas was portrayed as being the uncle of Whitewater Duck.

=== Moocher McDuck ===
Moocher McDuck is the beggar cousin of Scrooge who appeared for the first time in the story &quot;Too Many McDucks&quot; by Tony Strobl. Moocher&#x27;s look is very similar to Scrooge&#x27;s, except for the fact that he wears tattered clothes, but unlike his very rich cousin, Moocher is a sweetheart. He was used in some Brazilian comic stories in the 1970s.

=== Cyril McDuck ===
Cyril McDuck is the banished cousin of Scrooge, who appeared in the story The Search for Cyril, by Bob Gregory, where he failed to pass a “stinginess test” given to him by Dingus McDuck (called Titus McDuck), where each child of Clan McDuck would be given money to save, however Cyril failed buying candy for some children, and was banished to the Scottish Highlands, where he became a goatherd. In the story Donald sees that Scrooge has a photo of every Clan McDuck member, except for Cyril, and Donald attempts to photograph him.

==Other relatives==
===Duck family===

The Duck family are Scrooge&#x27;s American relatives and include his nephew Donald, niece Della and grandnephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. They are related through Hortense&#x27;s marriage to Quackmore Duck, Donald&#x27;s father.

===Aunt Eider===
Aunt Eider is the aunt of both Scrooge McDuck and John D. Rockerduck. The Italian story &quot;La Stella di Burbank&quot;, where she is portrayed as a myopic old woman who doesn&#x27;t realize she needs to wear glasses, is presumably her first comic book appearance. But Aunt Eider appears wearing glasses in her next three comic book appearances. Dick Kinney wrote the last three comic stories where this character was used, and three famous cartoonists respectively drew those ones. Al Hubbard, Marco Rota and Giorgio Cavazzano. Neither of these stories was published in America. The story &quot;Most Helpful Aunt Eider&quot; is the only one where Aunt Eider doesn&#x27;t meet her wealthy nephews. It&#x27;s a Junior Woodchucks story.

Since there isn&#x27;t any clue on how the tireless and slightly bossy Aunt Eider could be the aunt of both Scrooge and Rockerduck in the comic stories with her, some fans of this universe have invented their own explanations for this fact. It really seems she never had a surname, so she has been connected to Scrooge&#x27;s family through his paternal grandmother, Molly Mallard, who would be an aunt of Eider. This would make Eider a &quot;Mallard&quot; too, but, of course, this is not a widely accepted explanation at all. According to this same invented explanation, Aunt Eider would be a sister of Rockerduck&#x27;s mother.

===Ludwig Von Drake===

Ludwig Von Drake is Donald Duck&#x27;s uncle. Their exact relationship has only rarely been described. Don Rosa fans have speculated that Ludwig is married to Matilda McDuck, while the Disney company have portrayed him as a bachelor. Walt Disney stated Ludwig is Donald&#x27;s father&#x27;s brother.

===Aunt Vera===
Aunt Vera is Scrooge McDuck and Rumpus McFowl&#x27;s mutual aunt. She is only briefly mentioned, where she gave her nephew Rumpus information that informed him and Scrooge that they were half-brothers. She is also mentioned to be living, however the exact relationship to Scrooge and Clan McDuck is unknown.

<doc id="31415" wikidata="Q134985" url="?curid=31415" title="Topaz">
<text>Topaz is a silicate mineral made of aluminum and fluorine with the chemical formula AlSiO(F, OH). It is used as a gemstone in jewelry and other adornments. Common topaz in its natural state is colorless, though trace element impurities can make it pale blue or golden brown to yellow-orange. Topaz is often treated with heat or radiation to make it a deep blue, reddish-orange, pale green, pink, or purple.

Topaz is a nesosilicate mineral, and more specifically, an aluminosilicate mineral. It is one of the hardest naturally occurring minerals and has a relatively low index of refraction. It has the orthorhombic crystal system and a dipyramidial crystal class.

It occurs in many places in the world. Some of the most popular places where topaz is sourced are Brazil and Russia. Topaz is often mined in open pit or alluvial settings. 

==Etymology==
The word &quot;topaz&quot; is usually believed to be derived (via Old French: Topace and Latin: Topazius) from the Greek &quot;Τοπάζιος&quot; (Topázios) or &quot;Τοπάζιον&quot; (Topázion), from Τοπαζος. This is the ancient name of St. John&#x27;s Island in the Red Sea which was difficult to find and from which a yellow stone (now believed to be chrysolite: yellowish olivine) was mined in ancient times. The name &quot;topaz&quot; was first applied to the mineral now known by that name in 1737. Ancient Sri Lanka (Tamraparni) exported topazes to Greece and ancient Egypt, which led to the etymologically related names of the island by Alexander Polyhistor (&quot;Topazius&quot;) and the early Egyptians (&quot;Topapwene&quot;) – &quot;land of the Topaz&quot;. Pliny said that Topazos is a &quot;legendary&quot; island in the Red Sea and the mineral &quot;topaz&quot; was first mined there. Alternatively, the word &quot;topaz&quot; may be related to the Sanskrit word तपस् &quot;tapas&quot;, meaning &quot;heat&quot; or &quot;fire&quot;.

==History==
Nicols, the author of one of the first systematic treatises on minerals and gemstones, dedicated two chapters to the topic in 1652. In the Middle Ages, the name topaz was used to refer to any yellow gemstone, but in modern times it denotes only the silicate described above.

Many English translations of the Bible, including the King James Version, mention topaz. However, because these translations as &quot;topaz&quot; all derive from the Septuagint translation &quot;topazi[os]&quot;, which referred to a yellow stone that was not topaz, but probably &quot;chrysolite&quot; (chrysoberyl or peridot), topaz is likely not meant here.

An English superstition also held that topaz cured lunacy. The ancient Romans believed that topaz provided protection from danger while traveling. During the Middle Ages, it was believed that attaching the topaz to the left arm protected the owner from any curse and warded off the evil eye. It was also believed that wearing topaz increased body heat, which would enable people to relieve a cold or fever. In Europe during the Middle Ages, topaz was believed to enhance mental powers. In India, people believed topaz granted beauty, intelligence, and longevity when worn over the heart.

==Gemstone==
Topaz is a gemstone. In cut and polished form, it is used to make jewelry or other adornments. Lower quality topaz is commonly used as an abrasive material due to its hardness and it is used to produce refractory materials for high temperature environments. Topaz can be used as a flux in steel production. Using topaz as a refectory material does have some health and environmental concerns due to the production of fluorine as a byproduct of calcining topaz.

Topaz is a part of the second rank of gemstones, or semiprecious stones, accompanying aquamarine, morganite, and tourmaline. The first rank of gemstones, or precious stones, includes ruby, sapphire, diamond, and emerald.

Orange topaz, also known as precious topaz, is the birthstone for the month of November, the symbol of friendship, and the state gemstone of the U.S. state of Utah. Blue topaz is the state gemstone of the US state of Texas. The 4th wedding anniversary gem is blue topaz and the 23rd is imperial topaz.

Synthetic topaz can be produced using a method that includes the thermal hydrolysis of SiO2 and AlF3. When these compounds are heated to temperatures of 750° to 850 °C topaz is formed. Another method uses a combination of amorphous Al2O3, Na2SiF6, and water which is heated to a temperature of 500 °C, put under a pressure of 4000 bars, and left for 9 days.

To care for a topaz gemstone, it is best to avoid ultrasonic cleaners or steam as this could produce small fractures within the crystal. Warm water with soap is the best way to wash it.

To choose an ethically sourced topaz gemstone, it is recommended to search for a stone that the seller knows the origin of. If the seller cannot produce information about the locality and mine that the topaz was collected from, it is likely that it was collected unethically. 

== Structure ==

Topaz is an accessory mineral to felsic igneous, sedimentary, and hydrothermally altered rocks.

The crystal structure of topaz alternates between sheets of (F, OH)2O and O along (010) with Al3+ occupying the octahedral sites and Si4+ in the tetrahedral sites. Fluorine can be substituted by hydroxide in topaz by up to 30 mol.% in nature and hydroxide-dominating topaz can be made in laboratories but has not been found in nature.

On occasion, cavities can be found within topaz and they are filled with a liquid called brewsterlinite. Brewsterlinite was discovered by David Brewster upon heating a sample of topaz. After heating, the topaz lost mass, and through examination Brewster concluded Topaz was formed in a wet environment creating these liquid-filled cavities. This liquid is a hydrocarbon with a refractive index of 1·13.

Topaz&#x27;s crystal habit takes many forms. It can display a range of slender and long crystals to bulky and short. There can also be variation in the terminations displaying blunt, pyramidal, chisel, or wedge-shaped terminations. The perfect cleavage {001} in topaz breaks no Si-O bonds within its structure and only breaks Al-O and Al-F bonds. This cleavage is diagnostic for this mineral. The 2V optical angle in topaz can range from 48° to 69.5°. Low fluorine content yields a smaller angle and high fluorine content yields a larger angle.

==Characteristics==

Topaz in its natural state is colorless, often with a greyish cast. It also occurs as a golden brown to yellow color which makes it sometimes confused with citrine, a less valuable gemstone. The specific gravity of all shades of topaz, however, means that it is considerably heavier than citrine (about 25% per volume) and this difference in weight can be used to distinguish two stones of equal volume. Also, if the volume of a given stone can be determined, its weight if it were topaz can be established and then checked with a sensitive scale. Likewise, glass stones are also much lighter than equally sized topaz.

A variety of impurities and treatments may make topaz wine red, pale gray, reddish-orange, pale green, or pink (rare), and opaque to translucent/transparent. The pink and red varieties come from chromium replacing aluminium in its crystalline structure.

Imperial topaz is yellow, pink (rare, if natural), or pink-orange. Brazilian imperial topaz can often have a bright yellow to deep golden brown hue, sometimes even violet. Many brown or pale topazes are treated to make them bright yellow, gold, pink, or violet colored. Some imperial topaz stones can fade from exposure to sunlight for an extended period of time. Naturally occurring blue topaz is quite rare. Typically, colorless, gray, or pale yellow and blue material is heat treated and irradiated to produce a more desired darker blue. Mystic topaz is a colorless topaz that has been artificially coated via a vapor deposition process giving it a rainbow effect on its surface.

Although very hard, topaz must be treated with greater care than some other minerals of similar hardness (such as corundum) because of a weakness of atomic bonding of the stone&#x27;s molecules along one or another axial plane (whereas diamonds, for example, are composed of carbon atoms bonded to each other with equal strength along all of its planes). This gives topaz a tendency to break along such a cleavage plane if struck with sufficient force.

Topaz has a relatively low index of refraction for a gemstone, and so stones with large facets or tables do not sparkle as readily as stones cut from minerals with higher refractive indices, though quality colorless topaz sparkles and shows more &quot;life&quot; than similarly cut quartz. When given a typical &quot;brilliant&quot; cut, topaz may either show a sparkling table facet surrounded by dead-looking crown facets or a ring of sparkling crown facets with a dull well-like table. It also takes an exceptionally fine polish, and can sometimes be distinguished from citrine by its slippery feel alone (quartz cannot be polished to this level of smoothness).

Another method of distinguishing topaz from quartz is by placing the unset stone in a solution of bromoform or methylene iodide. Quartz will invariably float in these solutions, whereas topaz will sink.

==Localities and occurrence==

Topaz is commonly associated with silicic igneous rocks of the granite and rhyolite type. It typically crystallizes in granitic pegmatites or in vapor cavities in rhyolite lava flows including those at Topaz Mountain in western Utah and Chivinar in South America. It can be found with fluorite and cassiterite in various areas including the Ural and Ilmensky mountains of Russia, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, the Czech Republic, Germany, Norway, Pakistan, Italy, Sweden, Japan, Brazil, Mexico; Flinders Island, Australia; Nigeria, Ukraine and the United States. Topaz was found around the time of the 1700s in a pegmatite formation within the central Urals Mountains in Russia.

Brazil is one of the largest producers of topaz, some clear topaz crystals from Brazilian pegmatites can reach boulder size and weigh hundreds of pounds. The Topaz of Aurangzeb, observed by Jean Baptiste Tavernier weighed . The American Golden Topaz, a more recent gem, weighed . Large, vivid blue topaz specimens from the St. Anns mine in Zimbabwe were found in the late 1980s. Colorless and light-blue varieties of topaz are found in Precambrian granite in Mason County, Texas within the Llano Uplift. There is no commercial mining of topaz in that area. It is possible to synthesize topaz.

== Mining ==
Large-scale topaz mining typically uses open pit and underground mining to extract the gem. The waste material is discarded using large machines to transport it away while the valuable ore is washed and sorted to recover the topaz gems. In smaller-scale mines, dry sieving is used in alluvial environments by shoveling the material into sieves to separate the gems from unwanted dust and debris. The topaz can then be selected by hand from the remaining material. Mined topaz is then sent to be processed for use in jewelry by polishing the gem and treating it to achieve the desired color.

Mining for topaz can cause some environmental concerns mostly associated with larger-scale operations. The introduction of a large open pit mine into an environment leads to modification of the land around it to make it accessible to workers. After use of such mines is over, they are often refilled with loose sediments left over from the mining process. These loose sediments can be washed away to other areas, cutting off water features, destroying farmland, and creating a threat of landslides. The pollution produced by mining can impact the environment around it and damage its health. Deforestation undergone to create the mine, along with the machinery used during the mining process, adds greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. Deforestation also removes habitats and biodiversity from a large area of natural space. These disruptions to the ecosystem can be challenging to wildlife and local populations. Water, also a large component of mining operations, is drawn away from neighboring communities to create a lack of water. Tailings leftover from the mining process can leach contaminants into nearby water systems and can contaminate the drinking water of local communities.

Some ways humans can be impacted by gem mining is through danger in mines and inadequate compensation. Accidents such as collapsing mines and machinery malfunctioning can put human life in danger. Those working in the mines can also be exposed to harmful chemicals and heavy metals that can impact their health. For income, there can be an unequal dispersal of the funds made from gem mining between land owners, laborers, and the operators of the mine. In illegal mining operations, there can be more money given to miners, however, these operations have fewer regulations and more dangerous environments.

Ted was raised in Conservative Judaism, and his ancestors immigrated from Russia and Hungary. He attended Wylie E. Groves High School in Beverly Hills, Michigan, where he played blues harp and was a DJ and a member of the Groves Cinema Society. At seventeen, Raimi began his professional acting career doing industrial films in Detroit, for Ford, General Motors and Chrysler. He attended University of Michigan, New York University, then finally University of Detroit. Raimi&#x27;s older brothers are director Sam Raimi and screenwriter Ivan Raimi.

==Career==
Raimi&#x27;s motion picture acting credits include: Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;Shocker&quot;, &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;, &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;, &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;, &quot;Army of Darkness&quot;, &quot;Darkman&quot; and the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; series, as well as roles in such features as: &quot;Stuart Saves His Family&quot;, &quot;The Grudge&quot;, &quot;Midnight Meat Train&quot; and &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;.

On television, he has been seen on shows such as &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot; and &quot;Legend of the Seeker,&quot; but is best known for his roles as the communication officer Lt. Tim O&#x27;Neill on the science fiction television series &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot; (later &quot;seaQuest 2032&quot;) and starring as the warrior wannabe Joxer on &quot;&quot;.

Raimi wrote the original &quot;Joxer the Mighty&quot; song with help from director Josh Becker for &quot;&quot;. In 2022, he joined director Alex Kahuam for his upcoming feature film &quot;Failure!&quot;, which was shot entirely in a single long-take.

<text>The Monkees were an American pop rock band formed in Los Angeles in the mid-1960s. The band consisted of Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork. Spurred by the success of TV series &quot;The Monkees&quot;, the Monkees were one of the most successful bands of the late 1960s. With international hits, four chart-topping albums and three chart-topping songs (&quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot;, and &quot;Daydream Believer&quot;), they have certified sales of 21 million singles and albums in the United States alone.

The Monkees were originally a fictional band created for the NBC television sitcom &quot;The Monkees&quot;. Dolenz, Jones, Nesmith and Tork were cast to portray members of a band in the sitcom. Music credited to the Monkees appeared in the sitcom and was released on LPs and singles beginning in 1966, and the sitcom aired from 1966 to 1968. At first, the band members&#x27; musical contributions were primarily limited to lead vocals and the occasional composition, with the remaining music provided by professional songwriters and studio musicians. Though this arrangement yielded multiple hit albums and singles, the band members revolted and, after a brief power struggle, gained full control over the recording process in 1967. For two albums, the Monkees mostly performed as a group; however, within a year, each member was pursuing his own interests under the Monkees&#x27; name, rendering the Monkees once again a group in name only. With widespread allegations that the band members did not play their own instruments—followed by the cancellation of &quot;The Monkees&quot; TV series, diminishing success on the charts, and waning popularity overall—band members began to leave the group. The Monkees held a final recording session in 1970 before breaking up.

Renewed interest in the Monkees emerged in 1986, leading to a 20th anniversary reunion. Over the subsequent 35 years, the Monkees intermittently reunited for reunion tours, a major-network television special, and the production of new studio albums. After the deaths of Jones in 2012 and Tork in 2019, Dolenz and Nesmith undertook a farewell tour in 2021. This tour concluded shortly before Nesmith&#x27;s death later that year, leaving Dolenz as the sole surviving member.

== History ==
=== Conception and casting ===
The Monkees were formed in the mid-1960s in Los Angeles.

Aspiring filmmaker Bob Rafelson developed the initial idea for &quot;The Monkees&quot; in 1962 and tried selling it to Revue Productions, the television division of Universal Pictures, but was unsuccessful. In May 1964, while working at Screen Gems, Rafelson teamed up with Bert Schneider, whose father, Abraham Schneider, headed the Colpix Records and Screen Gems Television units of Columbia Pictures. Rafelson and Schneider ultimately formed Raybert Productions. The Beatles&#x27; films &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot; inspired Rafelson and Schneider to revive Rafelson&#x27;s idea for &quot;The Monkees&quot;. As &quot;Raybert Productions&quot;, they sold the show to Screen Gems Television on April 16, 1965.

Rafelson and Schneider&#x27;s original idea was to cast an existing New York folk rock group, the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, who were not widely known at the time. After those plans fell through, Rafelson and Schneider focused on Davy Jones. In September 1964, Jones had signed to a long-term contract to appear in TV programs for Screen Gems, to make feature films for Columbia Pictures and to record music for the Colpix label. His involvement with &quot;The Monkees&quot; was publicly announced on July 14, 1965. Jones had previously starred as the Artful Dodger in the Broadway theater show &quot;Oliver!&quot;; for his work in &quot;Oliver!&quot;, he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical in 1963.

In September1965, &quot;Daily Variety&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ran advertisements to cast the remainder of the band/cast members for the TV show. The advertisements each read as follows:

Out of 437 applicants, the other three chosen for the cast of the TV show were musician Michael Nesmith, musician Peter Tork, and actor/musician Micky Dolenz. Nesmith had been working as a musician since early 1963 and had been recording and releasing music under various names, including Michael Blessing and &quot;Mike &amp; John &amp; Bill&quot;, and he had studied drama in college. Of the final three, Nesmith was the only one who actually saw the ad in &quot;Daily Variety&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. Tork, the last to be chosen, had been working the Greenwich Village scene as a musician and had shared the stage with Pete Seeger; he learned of &quot;The Monkees&quot; from Stephen Stills, whom Rafelson and Schneider had rejected as a songwriter. Dolenz was an actor (his father was veteran character actor George Dolenz) who had starred in the Screen Gems-produced TV series &quot;Circus Boy&quot; as a child, using the stage name Mickey Braddock. He had also played guitar and sung in a band called the Missing Links, which released one single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Do It&quot;.

=== Early years ===

==== Developing the music for their debut album ====
During the casting process, Don Kirshner, Screen Gems&#x27; head of music, was contacted to secure music for &quot;The Monkees&quot; pilot. Kirshner&#x27;s Brill Building firm Aldon Music had an extensive portfolio of songwriters, many in need of work after the British Invasion had reorganized the American music scene; while several Aldon writers contributed songs to the Monkees during their existence, the bulk of the songwriting for the group fell upon Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, two songwriters who were only beginning to break through to success at the time. Boyce and Hart contributed four demo recordings for the pilot. One of these recordings was &quot;(Theme From) The Monkees&quot; which helped get the series the green light.

When &quot;The Monkees&quot; was picked up as a series, development of the musical side of the project accelerated. Columbia–Screen Gems and RCA Victor entered into a joint venture called Colgems Records; the primary purpose of the venture was to distribute Monkees records. Raybert set up a rehearsal space and rented instruments for the group to practice playing in April 1966, but it quickly became apparent they would not be in shape in time for the series debut. The producers called upon Kirshner to recruit a producer for the Monkees&#x27; sessions.

Kirshner called on Snuff Garrett, composer of several hits by Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys, to produce the initial musical cuts for the show. Garrett, upon meeting the four Monkees in June 1966, decided that Jones would sing lead, a choice that was unpopular with the group. This cool reception led Kirshner to drop Garrett and buy out his contract.

Kirshner next allowed Nesmith to produce sessions, provided he did not play on any tracks he produced. Nesmith did, however, start using the other Monkees on his sessions, particularly Tork as a guitarist. Kirshner came back to the enthusiastic Boyce and Hart to be the regular producers, but he brought in one of his top East Coast associates, Jack Keller, to lend some production experience to the sessions. Boyce and Hart quickly realized that, when together, the four actors fooled around and tried to crack each other up. Because of this, the producers often brought in each singer individually.

The Monkees&#x27; debut and second albums were meant to be a soundtrack to the first season of the TV show, to cash in on the audience. In the 2006 Rhino Deluxe Edition re-issue of their second album, &quot;More of the Monkees&quot;, Nesmith stated that he was angered by the release of the first album because it portrayed the band as an actual rock-and-roll band and gave no credit to the other musicians involved in the project.

The Monkees&#x27; first single, &quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot; b/w &quot;Take a Giant Step&quot;, was released in August 1966, just weeks prior to the TV broadcast debut. In conjunction with the first broadcast of the television show on September 12, 1966, on the NBC television network, NBC and Columbia had a major hit on their hands. The single topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for the week ending November 5, 1966. The Monkees&#x27; debut album, &quot;The Monkees&quot;, was released a month later; it spent 13 weeks at No. 1 and stayed on the Billboard charts for 78 weeks. Twenty years later, during their reunion, it spent another 24 weeks on the Billboard charts.

==== Lineup configuration ====

In assigning instruments for purposes of the television show, a dilemma arose as to which of the four would portray the drummer. Both Nesmith (a skilled guitarist and bassist) and Tork (who could play several stringed and keyboard instruments) were peripherally familiar with the instrument, but both declined to give the drum set a try. Jones knew how to play the drums and tested well enough on the instrument; however, the producers believed that he would be virtually hidden from view behind a drum set due to his short stature. Thus, Dolenz (who knew only how to play the guitar) was assigned to become the drummer. Tork taught Dolenz his first few beats on the drums, enough for him to fake his way through filming the pilot. He was soon taught how to play properly. The lineup for the TV show most frequently featured Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, Dolenz on drums and Jones as a frontman, singer and percussionist, despite the fact that this lineup did not correspond to the members&#x27; musical strengths. Tork was a more experienced guitar player than Nesmith, while Nesmith had trained on the bass. Also, while Jones had a strong lead voice and did sing lead on several Monkees recordings, Dolenz&#x27;s voice is regarded, particularly by Nesmith, as distinctive and a hallmark of the Monkees&#x27; sound.

Unlike most television shows of the time, &quot;The Monkees&quot; episodes were written with many setups, requiring frequent breaks to prepare the set and cameras for short bursts of filming. Some of the &quot;bursts&quot; are considered proto-music videos, inasmuch as they were produced to sell the records. &quot;The Monkees Tale&quot; author Eric Lefcowitz noted that the Monkees were—first and foremost—a video group.

==== Live performances and touring ====
Pleased with their initial efforts, Columbia (over Kirshner&#x27;s objections) planned to send the Monkees out to play live concerts. The massive success of the series—and its spin-off records—created intense pressure to mount a touring version of the group. Against the initial wishes of the producers, the band went out on the road and made their debut live performance in December 1966 in Hawaii.

The results of these live performances were far better than expected. Wherever they went, the group was greeted by scenes of fan adulation reminiscent of Beatlemania. This gave the singers increased confidence in their fight for control over the musical material chosen for the series.

=== Independence ===
====Conflict with Kirshner====
In early 1967, controversy concerning the Monkees&#x27; studio abilities arose. Dolenz told a reporter that the Wrecking Crew provided the backing tracks for the first two Monkees albums, and that his position as drummer was simply because a Monkee had to learn to play the drums, and he only knew the guitar. In the January 28, 1967, issue of &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; an article quoted Nesmith railing against the music creation process. &quot;Do you know how debilitating it is to sit up and have to duplicate somebody else&#x27;s records?&quot; he asked. &quot;Tell the world we don&#x27;t record our own music.&quot;

The band members were displeased that the music publishing company would not allow them to play their own instruments on their records or to use more of their own material. These complaints intensified when Kirshner moved track recording from California to New York, leaving the band out of the musical process entirely until they were called upon to add their vocals to the completed tracks. Nesmith, when asked about the situation by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, said, &quot;The [TV show&#x27;s] producers [in Hollywood] backed us and David went along. None of us could have fought the battles we did [with the music publishers] without the explicit support of the show&#x27;s producers&quot;. 
On January 16, 1967, the Monkees held their first recording session as a fully functioning, self-contained band. The band recorded an early version of Nesmith&#x27;s self-composed top 40 hit single &quot;The Girl I Knew Somewhere&quot;, along with &quot;All of Your Toys&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s So Far Out, She&#x27;s In&quot;. Also in January, Kirshner released the band&#x27;s second album of songs that used session musicians, &quot;More of the Monkees&quot;, without the band&#x27;s knowledge. The Monkees were annoyed at not having even been told of the release in advance, at having their opinions on the track selection ignored, at Kirshner&#x27;s self-congratulatory liner notes and also because of the cover photo, which was a composite of photographs taken for a J.C. Penney clothing advertisement. Indeed, the Monkees had not even been given a copy of the album; they had to buy it from a record store.

The climax of the rivalry between Kirshner and the band was an intense argument among Nesmith, Kirshner and Colgems lawyer Herb Moelis, which took place at the Beverly Hills Hotel in January 1967. Kirshner had presented the group with royalty checks and gold records. Nesmith had responded with an ultimatum, demanding a change in the way the Monkees&#x27; music was chosen and recorded. Moelis reminded Nesmith that he was under contract. The confrontation ended with Nesmith punching a hole in a wall and saying, &quot;That could have been your face!&quot; However, each of the members, including Nesmith, accepted the $250,000 royalty checks (equivalent to approximately $ in today&#x27;s funds).

Soon after, Colgems and the Monkees reached an agreement not to release material directly created by the group together with unrelated Kirshner-produced material. Kirshner immediately violated this agreement in early February 1967, when he released &quot;A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You&quot;, composed and written by Neil Diamond, as a single with an early version of &quot;She Hangs Out&quot;, a song recorded in New York with Davy Jones&#x27;s vocals, as the B-side. (This single was only released in Canada and was withdrawn after a couple of weeks.) He was consequently dismissed from the project.

Propelled by the band&#x27;s second single, &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; b/w &quot;(I&#x27;m Not Your) Steppin&#x27; Stone&quot;, &quot;More of the Monkees&quot; became the band&#x27;s biggest-selling LP. The album spent 70 weeks on the Billboard charts, staying No. 1 for 18 weeks and becoming the third-highest-selling album of the 1960s. &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; was written by Neil Diamond. The Monkees&#x27; recording of the single hit the number-one spot on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for the week ending December 31, 1966, remaining there for seven weeks. &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; became the biggest-selling single for all of 1967.

The Monkees&#x27; musical opportunities were open beyond their ability to capitalize. Screen Gems held the publishing rights to a wealth of material, with the Monkees being offered the first choice of many new songs. Due to the abundance of material numerous tracks were recorded, but dozens were left unreleased until Rhino Records started releasing them through the Missing Links series of albums starting in the late 1980s.

The Monkees&#x27; UK tour in 1967 received a chilly reception; the front pages of several UK and international music papers proclaimed that the group members did not always play their own instruments or sing the backing vocals in the studio. They were derisively dubbed the &quot;Pre-Fab Four&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; called them a &quot;disgrace to the pop world&quot;. However, George Harrison praised the Monkees&#x27; self-produced musical attempts. Peter Tork was later one of the musicians on Harrison&#x27;s album &quot;Wonderwall Music&quot;, playing Paul McCartney&#x27;s five-string banjo. Nesmith attended the Beatles&#x27; recording session for &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; at Abbey Road Studios. At that time, he reportedly asked John Lennon, &quot;Do you think we&#x27;re a cheap imitation of the Beatles, your movies and your records?&quot; Lennon replied, &quot;I think you&#x27;re the greatest comic talent since the Marx Brothers. I&#x27;ve never missed one of your programs&quot;.

==== &quot;Headquarters&quot; and &quot;Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd.&quot; ====
In February 1967, after Don Kirshner was dismissed as musical supervisor, Michael Nesmith hired Chip Douglas to produce the Monkees&#x27; next album, &quot;Headquarters&quot;. This album was the first on which the Monkees primarily played their own instruments, with exceptions for most bass and horn parts. Douglas handled music direction, engineered recordings, and played bass on most tracks. &quot;Headquarters&quot; and its follow-up, &quot;Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd.&quot;, provided much of the music for the second season of the Monkees&#x27; television series.

In March 1967, &quot;The Girl I Knew Somewhere&quot;, written by Nesmith and performed by Dolenz, Nesmith, Tork, and bassist John London, was released as the B-side to &quot;A Little Bit Me, a Little Bit You&quot;. The A-side peaked at No. 2 on the charts, while the B-side reached No. 39.

Released in May 1967, &quot;Headquarters&quot; contained no U.S. singles but became the Monkees&#x27; third consecutive No. 1 album. With a country-folk-rock sound, the album reflected a departure from the pop style of their earlier works under Kirshner. According to Andrew Sandoval, the album topped the charts on May 24, 1967, but was displaced by the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; the following week, holding the No. 2 spot for 11 weeks during the &quot;Summer of Love&quot;. The track &quot;Randy Scouse Git&quot;, written and sung by Dolenz, was released internationally as &quot;Alternate Title&quot; (owing to the controversial nature of its original title) and became a hit, reaching No. 2 in the UK and Norway.

Tork&#x27;s &quot;For Pete&#x27;s Sake&quot; was used as the closing theme for the Monkees&#x27; television show. Nesmith contributed songs like &quot;Sunny Girlfriend&quot;, incorporating pedal steel guitar, and &quot;You Told Me&quot;, with a banjo intro by Tork that parodied the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Taxman&quot;. Other notable tracks included &quot;You Just May Be the One&quot;, &quot;Shades of Gray&quot;, &quot;Forget that Girl&quot;, and &quot;No Time&quot;. The band wrote six of the album&#x27;s 12 tracks, along with two experimental pieces, &quot;Band 6&quot; and &quot;Zilch&quot;.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the album, stating, &quot;The Monkees Upgrade Album Quality&quot; and &quot;The Monkees are getting better. &quot;Headquarters&quot; has more interesting songs and a better quality level [than previous albums]... None of the tracks is a throwaway... The improvement trend is laudable.&quot;

The collaborative approach on &quot;Headquarters&quot; was short-lived. Nesmith states in the 2007 Rhino reissue of &quot;Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd.&quot;, &quot;Everybody in the press and in the hippie movement had got us into their target window as being illegitimate and not worthy of consideration as a musical force [or] certainly any kind of cultural force. We were under siege; wherever we went there was such resentment for us. We were constantly mocked and humiliated by the press. We were really gettin&#x27; beat up pretty good. We all knew what was going on inside. Kirshner had been purged. We&#x27;d gone to try to make &quot;Headquarters&quot; and found out that it was only marginally okay and that our better move was to just go back to the original songwriting and song-making strategy of the first albums except with a clear indication of how [the music] came to be... The rabid element and the hatred that was engendered is almost impossible to describe. It lingers to this day among people my own age.&quot; Tork disagreed with Nesmith&#x27;s assessment of &quot;Headquarters&quot;, stating, &quot;I don&#x27;t think the &quot;Pisces&quot; album was as groovy to listen to as &quot;Headquarters&quot;. Technically it was much better, but I think it suffers for that reason.&quot; Tork favored working as a unified band, but Dolenz soon lost interest in drumming. &quot;Dolenz was &#x27;incapable of repeating a triumph,&#x27;&quot; Tork commented in a DVD release of the second season. Producer Chip Douglas noted Dolenz&#x27;s drumming required extensive editing, calling it &quot;shaky&quot;.

By late 1967, the band members pursued divergent musical directions. Nesmith gravitated toward country-rock, while Jones leaned into Broadway-style performances. &quot;Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd.&quot;, released in November 1967, marked a return to heavy use of session musicians, including the Wrecking Crew, Louie Shelton, Glen Campbell, Stephen Stills, and Neil Young. Despite this, the Monkees retained creative control over song selection and production.

&quot;Pisces&quot; was their fourth consecutive No. 1 album, holding the top spot for five weeks. The album featured hits like &quot;Pleasant Valley Sunday&quot; (No. 3) and &quot;Words&quot; (No. 11). It also included early use of the Moog synthesizer on tracks like &quot;Daily Nightly&quot; and &quot;Star Collector&quot;. Nesmith&#x27;s &quot;What Am I Doing Hangin&#x27; &#x27;Round?&quot; became a milestone in the development of country-rock. Nesmith reflected, &quot;&quot;One of the things that I really felt was honest was country-rock. I wanted to move the Monkees more into that because ... if we get closer to country music, we&#x27;ll get closer to blues, and country blues, and so forth. ... It had a lot of un-country things in it: a familiar change from a I major to a VI minor—those kinds of things. So it was a little kind of a new wave country song. It didn&#x27;t sound like the country songs of the time, which was Buck Owens.&quot;

Their next single, &quot;Daydream Believer&quot;, with a piano intro by Tork, reached No. 1. Its B-side, &quot;Goin&#x27; Down&quot;, featured Nesmith and Tork on guitars and Dolenz on lead vocals. The Monkees simultaneously held No. 1 positions on the singles and album charts.

Both &quot;Headquarters&quot; and &quot;Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd.&quot; returned to the charts during the Monkees&#x27; 1986 reunion, remaining there for 17 weeks.

==== &quot;The Birds, The Bees &amp; The Monkees&quot; ====

No longer desiring to work as a group, the Monkees dropped Chip Douglas as a producer, and starting in November 1967, they largely produced their own sessions. Although credited to the whole band, the songs were mostly solo efforts. In a couple of cases, Boyce and Hart had returned from the first two albums to produce, but credit was given to the Monkees due to contractual requirements.

Propelled by the hit singles &quot;Daydream Believer&quot; and &quot;Valleri&quot;, along with Nesmith&#x27;s self-penned top 40 hit &quot;Tapioca Tundra&quot;, &quot;The Birds, The Bees &amp; The Monkees&quot; reached No. 3 on the Billboard charts shortly after it was released in April 1968. It was the first album released after NBC announced they were not renewing &quot;The Monkees&quot; for a third season. The album cover—a quaint collage of items in a knickknack shelf—was chosen over the Monkees&#x27; objections. It was the last Monkees&#x27; album to be released in separate, dedicated mono and stereo mixes. During the 1986 reunion, it returned to the Billboard charts for 11 weeks.

==== Beyond television and &quot;Head&quot; ====

As the second season of the television series was being produced, the Monkees tired of the sitcom format and refused to participate in a third season without a major overhaul. NBC was uninterested in making any changes, and so the series was cancelled in February 1968.

That same month, the Monkees began filming their feature film, &quot;Head&quot;. With Bob Rafelson as director and Bert Schneider as executive producer, the project was co-written and co-produced by Rafelson with a then-relatively unknown Jack Nicholson.

The film, conceived and edited in a stream of consciousness style, featured oddball cameo appearances by movie stars Victor Mature, Annette Funicello, a young Teri Garr (credited as &quot;Terry Garr&quot;), boxer Sonny Liston, famous stripper Carol Doda, Green Bay Packers linebacker Ray Nitschke, and musician Frank Zappa. It was filmed at Columbia Pictures&#x27; Screen Gems studios and on location in California, Utah, and the Bahamas between February 19 and May 17, 1968, and premiered in New York City on November 6 of that year (the film later debuted in Hollywood on November 20).

The film was the antithesis of &quot;The Monkees&quot; television show. Rafelson and Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;Ditty Diego-War Chant&quot; (recited at the start of the film by the group) ruthlessly parodies Boyce and Hart&#x27;s &quot;Monkees Theme&quot;. A sparse advertising campaign (with no mention of the Monkees) hurt any chances of the film doing well, and it played briefly in half-filled theaters. In the DVD commentary, Nesmith said that everyone associated with the Monkees &quot;had gone crazy&quot; by this time. They were each using the platform of the Monkees to push their own disparate career goals, to the detriment of the Monkees project. Nesmith added that &quot;Head&quot; was Rafelson and Nicholson&#x27;s intentional effort to &quot;kill&quot; the Monkees, so that they would no longer be bothered with the matter.

A poor audience response at an August 1968 screening in Los Angeles forced the producers to edit the picture from its original 110-minute length. The 86-minute &quot;Head&quot; premiered in New York City on November 6, 1968; the film later debuted in Hollywood on November 20. It was not a commercial success. This was in part because &quot;Head&quot; comprehensively demolished the group&#x27;s carefully groomed public image while the counterculture audience they had been reaching for rejected the Monkees&#x27; efforts out of hand. Receiving mixed critical reviews and virtually non-existent box office receipts, the film succeeded in alienating the band&#x27;s teenage fanbase while failing to attract a more adult audience. Rafelson and Schneider severed all ties to the band amid the bitterness that ensued over the commercial failure of &quot;Head&quot;. At the time, Rafelson told the press, &quot;I grooved on those four in very special ways while at the same time thinking they had absolutely no talent.&quot;

Released in October 1968, the single from the album, &quot;The Porpoise Song&quot;, is a psychedelic pop song written by Goffin and King, with lead vocals from Micky Dolenz and backing vocals from Davy Jones, and it reached No. 62 on the Billboard charts and No. 26 on the Canadian RPM charts.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack album reached No. 45 on the Billboard charts and No. 24 in Canada. Nicholson assembled the album, weaving dialogue and sound effects from the film in between the songs. The six (plus &quot;Ditty Diego&quot;) Monkees songs on the album range from psychedelic pop to straightforward rockers to Broadway rock to eastern-influenced pop to a folk-rock ballad. Although the Monkees performed &quot;Circle Sky&quot; live in the film, the studio version was chosen for the album. The live version was later released on various compilations, including Rhino&#x27;s Missing Links series of Monkees albums. The album also includes a song from the film&#x27;s composer, Ken Thorne.

The album had a mylar cover, to give it a mirror-like appearance, so that the person looking at the cover would see his own head, a play on the album title &quot;Head&quot;. Peter Tork said, &quot;That was something special... [Jack] Nicholson coordinated the record, made it up from the soundtrack. He made it different from the movie. There&#x27;s a line in the movie where [Frank] Zappa says, &#x27;That&#x27;s pretty white.&#x27; Then there&#x27;s another line in the movie that was not juxtaposed in the movie, but Nicholson put them together in the [soundtrack album], when Mike says, &#x27;And the same thing goes for Christmas&#x27;... that&#x27;s funny... very different from the movie... that was very important and wonderful that he assembled the record differently from the movie... It was a different artistic experience.&quot;

Over the intervening years &quot;Head&quot; has developed a cult following for its innovative style and anarchic humor. Members of the Monkees, Nesmith in particular, cite the soundtrack album as one of the crowning achievements of the band.

=== Later years and separation ===
==== Tork&#x27;s resignation, &quot;Instant Replay&quot; and &quot;The Monkees Present&quot; ====
Tensions within the group were increasing. Peter Tork, citing exhaustion, quit the band by buying out the last four years of his Monkees contract at $150,000 per year, equal to about $ per year today. Tork departed shortly after the band&#x27;s September–October Far East tour in December 1968 and after the band completed work on their 1969 NBC television special, &quot;33⅓ Revolutions Per Monkee&quot; (which rehashed many of the ideas from &quot;Head&quot;, only with the Monkees playing a strangely second-string role). In the DVD commentary for the television special, Dolenz noted that after filming was complete, Nesmith gave Tork a gold watch as a going-away present, engraved &quot;From the guys down at work.&quot; Most of the songs from the &quot;33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee&quot; TV Special were not officially released until over 40 years later, on the 2010 and 2011 Rhino Handmade Deluxe boxed sets of &quot;Head&quot; and &quot;Instant Replay&quot;.

Since each of the Monkees at this point were producing their own songs with very little of the other band members&#x27; involvement, they planned a future double album (eventually to be reduced to &quot;The Monkees Present&quot;) on which each Monkee would separately produce one side of a disc.

In February 1969, the Monkees&#x27; seventh album, &quot;Instant Replay,&quot; without Tork&#x27;s involvement beyond playing guitar on &quot;I Won&#x27;t Be the Same Without Her&quot;, was released, which reached No. 32 on the charts, and No. 45 in Canada. The single from the album was &quot;Tear Drop City&quot;, which peaked at No. 56 on the U.S. Billboard chart, No. 27 on the Canadian chart, and No. 34 on the Australian chart. According to Rhino Handmade&#x27;s 2011 Deluxe Edition reissue of this album, Davy Jones told &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Half of the songs were recorded over the last three years, but there are also about six new ones.&quot; The Monkees wanted to please the original 1966 fans by offering up new recordings of some previously unreleased older styled songs, as well as gain a new audience with what they considered a more mature sound. Nesmith continued in his country-rock vein after offering straight ahead rock and experimental songs on the two prior albums.

Dolenz contributed the biggest and longest Monkees&#x27; production, &quot;Shorty Blackwell&quot;, a song celebrating his cat. Dolenz called it his &quot;feeble attempt at something to do with &quot;Sgt. Pepper.&quot;&quot; Jones contributed an electric guitar rocker, &quot;You and I&quot;. Both Jones and Dolenz continued their role of singing on the pop songs. Lyrically, it has a theme of being one of the Monkees&#x27; most melancholy albums.

Throughout 1969 the trio appeared as guests on television programs such as &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot;, &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, and &quot;Laugh-In&quot; (Jones had also appeared on &quot;Laugh-In&quot; separate from the group). The Monkees also had a contractual obligation to appear in several television commercials with Bugs Bunny for Kool-Aid drink mix as well as Post cereal box singles.

In April 1969, the single &quot;Someday Man&quot; b/w &quot;Listen to the Band&quot; was released, which had the unique distinction of the B-side, a Nesmith-composed country-rock song, charting higher (No. 63) than the Jones-sung A-side (No. 81). In Canada, &quot;Someday Man&quot; was No. 74 and &quot;Listen to the Band&quot; reached No. 53.

The final album with Michael Nesmith from the Monkees&#x27; original incarnation was their eighth album, &quot;The Monkees Present&quot;, released in October 1969, which peaked at No. 100 on the Billboard charts. It included the Nesmith composed country-rock singles &quot;Listen to the Band&quot; and &quot;Good Clean Fun&quot; (released in September 1969)(No. 80 Canada) Other notable songs include the Dolenz composition &quot;Little Girl&quot;, which featured Louie Shelton on electric guitar, joining Micky on acoustic guitar, along with &quot;Mommy and Daddy&quot; (B-side to the &quot;Good Clean Fun&quot; single) in which he sang about America&#x27;s treatment of the Native Americans and drug abuse, and in an earlier take, released on Rhino Handmade&#x27;s 2011 Deluxe Edition of &quot;Instant Replay&quot;, sang about JFK&#x27;s assassination and the Vietnam war. Jones collaborated with Bill Chadwick on some slower ballads, along with releasing a couple of older upbeat songs from 1966.

In the summer of 1969, the three remaining Monkees embarked on a tour with the backing of the soul band Sam and the Goodtimers. Concerts for this tour were longer sets than their earlier performances tours, with many shows running over two hours. Although the tour was met with some positive critical reception (&quot;Billboard&quot; in particular praised it), other critics were not favorable of the mixing of the Monkees&#x27; pop music with the Goodtimers&#x27; R&amp;B approach. Toward the end of the tour, some dates were canceled due to poor ticket sales. The tour failed to re-establish the band commercially, with no single entering the Top 40 in 1969. Dolenz remarked that the tour &quot;was like kicking a dead horse. The phenomenon had peaked&quot;.

==== Nesmith&#x27;s resignation, &quot;Changes&quot; and disbandment ====
On April 14, 1970, Nesmith joined Dolenz and Jones for the last time as part of the original incarnation of the Monkees to film a Kool-Aid commercial (with the then-newly introduced Nerf balls, thrown around a mock living room by the trio, available as a premium for Kool-Aid labels), with Nesmith leaving the group to continue recording songs with his own country-rock group called Michael Nesmith &amp; the First National Band, which he had started recording with on February 10, 1970.

Nesmith&#x27;s departure left Dolenz and Jones to record the bubblegum pop album &quot;Changes&quot; as the ninth and final album by the Monkees released during its original incarnation. By this time, Colgems was hardly putting any effort into the project, and they sent Dolenz and Jones to New York for the &quot;Changes&quot; sessions, to be produced by Jeff Barry. In comments for the liner notes of the 1994 re-release of &quot;Changes&quot;, Jones said that he felt they had been tricked into recording an &quot;Andy Kim album&quot; under the Monkees name. Except for the two singers&#x27; vocal performances, &quot;Changes&quot; is the only album that fails to win any significant praise from critics looking back 40 years to the Monkees&#x27; recording output. The album spawned the single &quot;Oh My My&quot;, which was accompanied by a music film promo (produced/directed by Dolenz). Dolenz contributed one of his own compositions, &quot;Midnight Train&quot;, which was used in the re-runs of the Monkees TV series. The &quot;Oh My My&quot; b/w &quot;I Love You Better&quot; single from the &quot;Changes&quot; album was the last single issued under the Monkees name in the United States until 1986. Originally released in June 1970, &quot;Changes&quot; failed to chart in Billboard&#x27;s Top 200 until the Monkees&#x27; 1986 reunion, when it stayed on the charts for 4 weeks.

September 22, 1970 marked the final recording session by the Monkees before the band broke up. On that date, Jones and Dolenz recorded &quot;Do It in the Name of Love&quot; and &quot;Lady Jane&quot;. The single was not mixed until February 19, 1971, and was released later that year as a single. The two remaining Monkees then lost the rights to use the name in several countries, the U.S. included. The single was not credited to the Monkees in the U.S., but to a misspelled &quot;Mickey Dolenz and Davy Jones&quot;, although in Japan it was issued under the Monkees&#x27; name.

Both Jones and Dolenz released multiple singles as solo artists in the years following the original breakup of the Monkees. The duo continued to tour throughout most of the 1970s.

=== Reunions and revivals ===

==== Dolenz, Jones, Boyce &amp; Hart ====
With repeats of the television series &quot;The Monkees&quot; airing on Saturday mornings and in syndication, the group once again appeared on the charts in 1976 with &quot;The Monkees Greatest Hits&quot;. The LP, issued by Arista Records (who by this time had possession of the Monkees&#x27; master tapes courtesy of their corporate owner, Screen Gems), was actually a re-packaging of an earlier (1972) compilation LP called &quot;Refocus&quot; that had been issued by Arista&#x27;s previous label imprint, Bell Records. Dolenz and Jones took advantage of this, joining ex-Monkees songwriters Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart to tour the United States. From 1975 to 1977, as the &quot;Golden Hits of the Monkees&quot; show (&quot;The Guys who Wrote &#x27;Em and the Guys who Sang &#x27;Em!&quot;), they successfully performed in smaller venues such as state fairs and amusement parks. The tour also made stops in Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore. An album of new material was released under the name &quot;Dolenz, Jones, Boyce &amp; Hart&quot;. Nesmith had not been interested in a reunion, and Tork could not be located in time to be invited.

A Christmas single (credited to Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones and Peter Tork for legal reasons) was produced by Chip Douglas and released on his own label in 1976. The single featured Douglas&#x27; and Howard Kaylan&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Is My Time of Year&quot; (originally recorded by a 1960s group Christmas Spirit), with a B-side of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot; (Douglas released a remixed version of the single, with additional overdubbed instruments, in 1986). This was the first (albeit unofficial) Monkees single since 1971. Tork also joined Dolenz, Jones, Boyce &amp; Hart on stage at Disneyland in Anaheim, California on July 4, 1976, and also joined Dolenz and Jones on stage at the Starwood in Hollywood in 1977.

In a 1977 interview, Nesmith falsely claimed that the Monkees outsold the Beatles and the Rolling Stones combined in 1967. This inaccurate information was later repeated in newspapers and magazines.

==== 1980s renaissance ====
Initially dismissed by critics in the late 1960s as a fabricated and talentless pop group, The Monkees experienced a significant resurgence in critical and commercial popularity during the mid-1980s. This revival was catalyzed by a marathon of their original television series, titled &quot;Pleasant Valley Sunday&quot;, broadcast on MTV on February 23, 1986. Simultaneously, Nickelodeon began daily reruns of the show, reintroducing the band to a new generation. These promotional efforts sparked a resurgence of &quot;Monkeemania&quot;, leading to a successful concert tour that expanded from smaller venues to becoming one of the most prominent live acts of 1986 and 1987.

The initial spark of the reunion occurred in February and March 1986, when Peter Tork and Davy Jones performed together in Australia. In May 1986, Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, and Peter Tork announced their &quot;20th Anniversary Tour&quot;, which began in North America in June. The tour&#x27;s success prompted additional performances in Australia, Europe, and North America, culminating in September 1989. These tours solidified the band&#x27;s renewed status in popular culture.

The Monkees&#x27; original albums saw renewed sales, complemented by the release of a new greatest hits compilation, which achieved platinum certification. The success of the band during this period led to the release of their first single since 1971, &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot;. The track reached No. 20 on Billboard magazine&#x27;s charts. However, Davy Jones declined to participate in recording the track and two other new songs included in the compilation album &quot;Then &amp; Now... The Best of The Monkees&quot;. Some releases credited the songs to &quot;The Monkees&quot;, while others specified &quot;Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork (of The Monkees),&quot; creating friction among the group members during their 1986 tour. Jones often exited the stage when these songs were performed. Despite the tension, Jones contributed to the band&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Pool It!&quot; (1987).

To promote &quot;Pool It!&quot;, Rhino Records released &quot;Heart and Soul: The Official Monkee Videography&quot;, featuring contemporary music videos, interviews, and additional content. In the video, Dolenz, Jones, and Tork announced plans for a new movie, although this project ultimately failed to materialize.

During the 1980s revival, Michael Nesmith expressed increased willingness to participate in Monkees-related activities but remained largely absent due to commitments with his Pacific Arts video production company. Nevertheless, he made several notable appearances, including a 1986 Christmas medley music video for MTV and a performance with the group at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on September 7, 1986. Nesmith also joined the band on stage at the Universal Amphitheatre on July 10, 1989, and participated in a Hollywood Walk of Fame dedication ceremony that same year. Despite these appearances, Nesmith did not contribute to any of the Monkees&#x27; studio recordings during this period.

==== New Monkees ====

In 1987, a new television series called &quot;New Monkees&quot; appeared. Other than centering on a boy band quartet, it bore no resemblance to the earlier series or group. The &quot;New Monkees&quot; left the air after 13 episodes.

==== 1990s reunions ====
In the 1990s, the Monkees continued to record new material. The band also re-issued all its original LPs on CD. Most of them included between three and six bonus tracks of previously unreleased songs or alternate takes; the first editions came with collectable trading cards.

The Monkees&#x27; eleventh album &quot;Justus&quot; was released in 1996. It was the first album since 1968 on which all four original members performed and produced, and it would be the last studio album in which all four Monkees directly participated (Jones&#x27;s death would necessitate the use of archival recordings on later albums). &quot;Justus&quot; was produced by the Monkees, and all of its songs were written by one or two of the four Monkees. The album was recorded using only the four Monkees for all instruments and vocals, which was the inspiration for the album title and spelling (&quot;Justus&quot; = Just Us).

The trio of Dolenz, Jones, and Tork reunited again for a successful 30th anniversary tour of American amphitheaters in 1996. Nesmith joined them onstage in Los Angeles to promote the new songs from &quot;Justus&quot;. For the first time since the brief 1986 reunion, Nesmith returned to the concert stage for a tour of the United Kingdom in 1997, highlighted by two sold-out concerts at Wembley Arena in Wembley Park, London. In 1967, the Monkees had been the first group to headline on their own at the Empire Pool, as the Arena was then called. This was followed by a 1997 US tour featuring Tork, Jones, and Dolenz.

The full quartet also appeared in an ABC television special entitled &quot;Hey, Hey, It&#x27;s the Monkees&quot;, which was written and directed by Nesmith and spoofed the original series that had made them famous. Following the UK tour, Nesmith declined to continue future performances with the Monkees, having faced harsh criticism from the British music press for his deteriorating musicianship. Tork noted in a DVD commentary that in 1966, Nesmith had learned &quot;a reasonably good version of the famous &#x27;Last Train to Clarksville&#x27; guitar lick&quot;. However, Tork indicated that Nesmith was no longer able to play that guitar lick, so Tork took over the lead guitar parts.

Nesmith&#x27;s departure from the tour was acrimonious. Jones was quoted by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as complaining that Nesmith &quot;made a new album with us. He toured Great Britain with us. Then all of a sudden, he&#x27;s not here. Later, I hear rumors he&#x27;s writing a script for our next movie. Oh, really? That&#x27;s bloody news to me. He&#x27;s always been this aloof, inaccessible person... the fourth part of the jigsaw puzzle that never quite fit in.&quot;

==== 2000s reunions ====
After the 1997 tours, the group took another hiatus until they once again reunited in 2001 to tour the United States. However, this tour was also accompanied by public sniping. Dolenz and Jones had announced that they had &quot;fired&quot; Tork for his constant complaining and threatening to quit. Tork was quoted as confirming this, as well as stating that he wanted to tour with his own band, Shoe Suede Blues. Tork told WENN News that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t handle the backstage problems&quot;; he added that because he was a recovering alcoholic, he was troubled by the overindulgence in alcohol by other members of the tour crew. Tork later stated in 2011 that alcohol played only a small role in his 2001 departure. He added, &quot;I take full responsibility for the backstage problems on the 2001 tour. We were getting along pretty well until I had a meltdown. I ticked the other guys off good and proper... I really just behaved inappropriately, honestly. I apologized to them.&quot;

Jones and Dolenz went on to tour the United Kingdom in 2002, but Tork declined to participate. Jones and Dolenz toured the United States one more time as a duo in 2002, and then split to concentrate on their own individual projects. With different Monkees citing different reasons, the group chose not to mark their 40th anniversary in 2006.

==== 45th anniversary tour and Jones&#x27;s death ====
&quot;An Evening with The Monkees: The 45th Anniversary Tour&quot; (without Nesmith) commenced on May 12, 2011, in Liverpool, England, before moving to North America in June and July for a total of 43 performances. Monkees biographer Andrew Sandoval noted, &quot;Once they hit the stage, the old magic was apparent. For the next three months...[they brought] the music and memories to fans in the band&#x27;s grandest stage show in decades&quot;. The tour grossed approximately $4 million.

On August 8, 2011, the band canceled ten last-minute shows due to what was initially reported as &quot;internal group issues and conflicts&quot;, though Tork later confirmed &quot;there were some business affairs that couldn&#x27;t be coordinated correctly. We hit a glitch and there was just this weird dislocation at one point&quot;.

Jones clarified that &quot;the (45th Anniversary) tour was only supposed to go until July. And it was great, the best time we&#x27;ve had because we&#x27;re all on the same page now. We jelled onstage and off. But then more dates were being added. And more... Some of these shows were 2 hours long... The audiences were great. But, let&#x27;s face it, we&#x27;re not kids.&quot;

The 45th anniversary tour was the last Monkees tour with Jones, who died of a heart attack at age 66 on February 29, 2012.

==== Reunion with Nesmith ====
On August 8, 2012, the surviving trio announced a series of U.S. shows for November and December, commencing in Escondido, California and concluding in New York City. The brief tour marked the first time Nesmith performed with the Monkees since 1997. Jones&#x27;s memory was honored throughout the shows via recordings and video. During one point, the band went quiet and a recording of Jones singing &quot;I Wanna Be Free&quot; played while footage of him was screening behind the band. For Jones&#x27;s signature song, &quot;Daydream Believer&quot;, Dolenz said that the band had discussed who should sing the song and had concluded that it should be the fans, saying &quot;It doesn&#x27;t belong to us anymore. It belongs to you.&quot;

The fall 2012 tour was very well received by both fans and critics, resulting in the band&#x27;s scheduling a 24-date summer tour for 2013. Dubbed &quot;A Midsummer&#x27;s Night with the Monkees&quot;, the concerts also featured Nesmith, Dolenz, and Tork. &quot;The reaction to the last tour was euphoric&quot;, Dolenz told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. &quot;It was pretty apparent there was a demand for another one.&quot; A third tour with Nesmith followed in 2014.

In 2014, the Monkees were inducted into the Pop Music Hall of Fame at the 2014 Monkees Convention.

==== &quot;Good Times!&quot; and 50th anniversary ====
Dolenz and Tork toured as the Monkees in 2015 without Nesmith&#x27;s participation. Nesmith stated that he was busy with other ventures, although Dolenz said that he was welcome to join them.

In February 2016, Dolenz announced that the Monkees would be releasing a new album, titled &quot;Good Times!&quot;, as a celebration of their 50th anniversary. &quot;Good Times!&quot; featured contributions by all three surviving members, as well as a posthumous contribution from Jones through vocals he had recorded in the 1960s. The album was released in May 2016 to considerable success, reaching No. 14 on the Billboard 200 and receiving generally favorable reviews.

With the release of the album, the band, featuring Dolenz and Tork, commenced their 50th anniversary tour. Nesmith did not participate in most of the tour, again citing other commitments. He did, however, make a few appearances throughout the summer of 2016, appearing virtually via Skype to perform &quot;Papa Gene&#x27;s Blues&quot; at one concert and in person for a four-song encore at another. In September, he replaced Tork on the tour for two dates while Tork attended to a family emergency. After Tork returned to the tour, Nesmith performed with the band for a concert at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood on September 16, which he stated would likely be his final concert appearance with the Monkees. Dolenz and Tork&#x27;s tour announced dates to the end of the year, including concerts in Australia and New Zealand.

==== The Mike and Micky Show, &quot;Christmas Party&quot;, and Tork&#x27;s death ====
On February 20, 2018, a new tour was announced as &quot;The Monkees Present: The Mike and Micky Show&quot;, their first tour as a duo; Tork was unable to participate due to health problems (a fact that was not revealed until after his death). Though the pair played Monkees music and promoted the tour under the Monkees banner, Dolenz and Nesmith respected Tork&#x27;s absence by insisting that the shows be billed as a separate duo rather than being billed as official Monkees shows. Nesmith stated, &quot;There&#x27;s no pretense there about Micky and I being the Monkees. We&#x27;re not.&quot;

The tour was cut short in June 2018, with four shows left unplayed, due to Nesmith undergoing quadruple bypass heart surgery, following a health issue that had persisted since early in the tour. After a month-long stay in the hospital, he and Dolenz announced March 2019 as make-up dates for the missed shows, and the tour was later extended to include Australia and New Zealand.

The Monkees released a Christmas album, &quot;Christmas Party&quot;, on October 12, 2018. The album features a mix of holiday standards and original songs written by contemporary artists. In addition to newly recorded material from the three surviving Monkees, two previously recorded songs featuring vocals from Jones were also included.

Tork died of cancer on February 21, 2019.

==== Farewell tour and Nesmith&#x27;s death ====
Following the success of the Mike and Micky Show, Dolenz and Nesmith announced a follow-up tour, An Evening with the Monkees, to begin in early 2020. The tour was delayed, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was announced on May 4, 2021, that the rescheduled dates would be billed as a farewell tour. &quot;The Monkees Farewell Tour&quot; consisted of over 40 dates in the US from September to November; because of restrictions due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, they were unable to play shows in Canada, the UK or Australia. The final date and final show for the Monkees Farewell Tour was held on November 14, 2021, at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles.

In May 2021, Dolenz released a solo album, &quot;Dolenz Sings Nesmith&quot;, featuring songs written by Nesmith and produced by Christian Nesmith.

Nesmith died of heart failure on December 10, 2021, less than a month after the final date of the 2021 tour. Nesmith&#x27;s death leaves Dolenz as the only surviving member of the Monkees. Tributes to Nesmith from other musicians, fans, and Dolenz were posted on social media.

=== Micky Dolenz ===

==== &quot;The Monkees Celebrated by Micky Dolenz&quot; tour ====
In early 2022, Dolenz announced that he would embark on a &quot;special series of concert dates in April 2022. Honoring the contributions of his bandmates – the late Davy Jones, Mike Nesmith &amp; Peter Tork – in song and with personal multimedia footage of the legendary performers&quot;. Monkees manager and tour manager Andrew Sandoval stated that &quot;We will be fully delving into The Monkees&#x27; songbook, as well as Micky&#x27;s personal archive of films and photos to create a unique evening of memories...&quot; The official tour was set to start on April 5, 2022, with a pre-tour performance on &quot;The Beach Boys Good Vibrations Cruise&quot;.

==Impact and legacy==
The Monkees, selected specifically to appeal to the youth market as American television&#x27;s response to the Beatles with their manufactured personae and carefully produced singles, are seen as an original precursor to the modern proliferation of studio and corporation-created bands. But this critical reputation has softened somewhat, with the recognition that the Monkees were neither the first manufactured group nor unusual in this respect. The Monkees also frequently contributed their own songwriting efforts on their albums and saw their musical skills improve. They ultimately became a self-directed group, playing their own instruments and writing many of their own songs.

Andrew Sandoval wrote the following in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;:

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; interviewed Davy Jones, who said, &quot;We touched a lot of musicians, you know. I can&#x27;t tell you the amount of people that have come up and said, &#x27;I wouldn&#x27;t have been a musician if it hadn&#x27;t been for the Monkees.&#x27; It baffles me even now&quot;.

The Monkees found unlikely fans among musicians of the punk rock period of the mid-1970s. Many of these punk performers had grown up on TV reruns of the series, and sympathized with the anti-industry, anti-establishment trend of their career. Sex Pistols and Minor Threat both recorded versions of &quot;(I&#x27;m Not Your) Steppin&#x27; Stone&quot; and it was often played live by Toy Love. Japanese new wave pop group the Plastics recorded a synthesizer and drum-machine version of &quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot; for their 1979 album &quot;Welcome Back&quot;.

Glenn A. Baker, author of &quot;Monkeemania: The True Story of the Monkees&quot;, described the Monkees as &quot;rock&#x27;s first great embarrassment&quot; in 1986:

Like an illegitimate child in a respectable family, the Monkees are destined to be regarded forever as rock&#x27;s first great embarrassment; misunderstood and maligned like a mongrel at a ritzy dog show, or a test tube baby at the Vatican... The fact was ignored that session players were being heavily employed by the Beach Boys, the Beatles, the Mamas and the Papas, the Byrds and other titans of the age. However, what could &quot;not&quot; be ignored, as rock disdained its pubescent past, was a group of middle-aged Hollywood businessmen had actually assembled their concept of a profitable rock group and foisted it upon the world. What mattered was that the Monkees had success handed to them on a silver plate.

&quot;Mediaite&quot; columnist Paul Levinson noted that &quot;The Monkees were the first example of something created in a medium—in this case, a rock group on television—that jumped off the screen to have big impact in the real world.&quot;

When commenting on the death of Jones on February 29, 2012, &quot;Time&quot; magazine contributor James Poniewozik praised the television show, saying that

&lt;poem&gt;... even if the show never meant to be more than entertainment and a hit-single generator, we shouldn&#x27;t sell &quot;The Monkees&quot; short. It was far better TV than it had to be; during an era of formulaic domestic sitcoms and wacky comedies, it was a stylistically ambitious show, with a distinctive visual style, absurdist sense of humor and unusual story structure. Whatever Jones and the Monkees were meant to be, they became creative artists in their own right, and Jones&#x27; chipper Brit-pop presence was a big reason they were able to produce work that was commercial, wholesome and yet impressively weird.&lt;/poem&gt;

The band released four chart-topping albums and three chart-topping songs (&quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot;, and &quot;Daydream Believer&quot;), and sold at least 21 million records in the US.

===In popular culture===
The Criterion Collection, which has a stated goal to release &quot;a continuing series of important classic and contemporary films, [and] has been dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality and award-winning, original supplements&quot; recognized the Monkees&#x27; film &quot;Head&quot; as meeting their criteria when they fully restored and released it on DVD and Blu-ray in 2010. They stated that &quot;Head&quot; was &quot;way, way ahead of its time&quot; and &quot;arguably the most authentically psychedelic film made in 1960s Hollywood&quot;. &quot;Head&quot; dodged commercial success on its release but has since been reclaimed as one of the great cult objects of its era.&quot;

In the book &quot;Hey, Hey We&#x27;re The Monkees&quot;, Rafelson wrote that, with &quot;Head&quot;, he explored unprecedented cinematic techniques, including filming actors underwater, the use of polarization, and inventing &quot;double-matte experiences&quot;. &quot;When it was shown in France, the head of the Cinematheque overly praised the movie as a cinematic masterpiece, and from that point on, this movie began to acquire an underground reputation.&quot;
In 2010, Nick Vernier Band created a digital &quot;Monkees reunion&quot; through the release of &quot;Mister Bob (featuring the Monkees),&quot; a new song produced under license from Rhino Entertainment, containing vocal samples from the band&#x27;s recording &quot;Zilch&quot;.
The contract bridge convention known as either Last Train or Last Train to Clarksville was so named by its inventor, Jeff Meckstroth, after the Monkees&#x27; song.

==== Comic books ====
A comic book series, &quot;The Monkees&quot;, was published in the United States by Dell Comics, which ran for 17 issues from 1967 to 1969.

In the United Kingdom, a &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; &quot;Crazy Cartoon Book&quot; featured four comic stories as well as four photos of the Monkees, all in black and white; it was published in 1967.

==== Biopic ====
In 2000, VH-1 produced the television biopic &quot;Daydream Believers: The Monkees&#x27; Story&quot;. In 2002, the movie was released on DVD and featured both commentaries and interviews with Dolenz, Jones and Tork. The aired version did differ from the DVD release, as the TV version had an extended scene with all four Monkees meeting the Beatles, but with a shortened Cleveland concert segment. It was also available on VHS.

==== Musical ====
A stage musical opened in the UK at the Manchester Opera House on Friday March 30, 2012, and was dedicated to Davy Jones (the Jones family attended the official opening on April 3). The production is a Jukebox musical and starred Stephen Kirwan, Ben Evans, Tom Parsons and Oliver Savile as actors playing the parts of the Monkees (respectively Dolenz, Jones, Nesmith, Tork) who are hired by an unscrupulous businessman to go on a world tour pretending to be the real band. The show includes 18 Monkees songs plus numbers by other 60s artists. It ran in Manchester as part of the &quot;Manchester Gets it First&quot; program until April 14, 2012, before a UK tour. Following its Manchester run, the show appeared in the Glasgow King&#x27;s Theatre and the Sunderland Empire Theatre.

== Awards and achievements ==
===Grammy Awards===
The Grammy Awards is an accolade by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) of the United States to recognize outstanding achievement in the music industry. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance arts: Emmy Awards (television), the Tony Awards (stage performance), and the Academy Awards (motion pictures).

=== Notable achievements ===
* Gave the Jimi Hendrix Experience their first U.S. concert tour exposure as an opening act in July 1967. Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s heavy psychedelic guitar and sexual overtones did not go over well with the teenage girls in the audience, which eventually led to his leaving the tour early. 
* The band inspired Gene Roddenberry to introduce the character of Chekov in his &quot;Star Trek&quot; TV series in response to the popularity of Davy Jones, complete with hairstyle and appearance mimicking that of Jones.
* Inducted into America&#x27;s Pop Music Hall of Fame in 2014.
* Honored by the Music Business Association (Music Biz) with an Outstanding Achievement Award celebrating the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary on May 16, 2016.
* Inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2007.

==Controversies==
===Rock and Roll Hall of Fame===
Various magazines and news outlets, such as &quot;Time&quot;, NPR, &quot;Goldmine&quot;, Yahoo! Music and MSNBC have argued that the Monkees belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 1992, Davy Jones told &quot;People&quot; that he knew the Monkees would never make the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In June 2007, Peter Tork complained to the &quot;New York Post&quot; that Jann Wenner had &quot;&quot; the Monkees from being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Tork contended that Wenner held a grudge against the Monkees because the band members did not always write their own songs or play their own instruments during their early years.

<text>A thermobaric weapon, also called an aerosol bomb, or a vacuum bomb, is a type of explosive munition that works by dispersing an aerosol cloud of gas, liquid or powdered explosive. The fuel is usually a single compound, rather than a mixture of multiple substances. Many types of thermobaric weapons can be fitted to hand-held launchers, and can also be launched from airplanes.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;thermobaric&quot; is derived from the Greek words for &#x27;heat&#x27; and &#x27;pressure&#x27;: &quot;thermobarikos&quot; (θερμοβαρικός), from &quot;thermos&quot; (θερμός) &#x27;hot&#x27; + &quot;baros&quot; (βάρος) &#x27;weight, pressure&#x27; + suffix &quot;-ikos&quot; (-ικός) &#x27;-ic&#x27;.

Other terms used for the family of weapons are high-impulse thermobaric weapons, heat and pressure weapons, vacuum bombs, and fuel-air explosives (FAE).

==Mechanism==
Most conventional explosives consist of a fuel–oxidiser premix, but thermobaric weapons consist only of fuel and as a result are significantly more energetic than conventional explosives of equal weight. Their reliance on atmospheric oxygen makes them unsuitable for use under water, at high altitude, and in adverse weather. They are, however, considerably more effective when used in enclosed spaces such as tunnels, buildings, and non-hermetically sealed field fortifications (foxholes, covered slit trenches, bunkers).

The initial explosive charge detonates as it hits its target, opening the container and dispersing the fuel mixture as a cloud. The typical blast wave of a thermobaric weapon lasts significantly longer than that of a conventional explosive.

In contrast to an explosive that uses oxidation in a confined region to produce a blast front emanating from a single source, a thermobaric flame front accelerates to a large volume, which produces pressure fronts within the mixture of fuel and oxidant and then also in the surrounding air.

Thermobaric explosives apply the principles underlying accidental unconfined vapor cloud explosions, which include those from dispersions of flammable dusts and droplets. Such dust explosions happened most often in flour mills and their storage containers, grain bins (corn silos etc.), and later in coal mines, prior to the 20th century. Accidental unconfined vapor cloud explosions now happen most often in partially or completely empty oil tankers, refinery tanks, and vessels, such as the Buncefield fire in the United Kingdom in 2005, where the blast wave woke people from its centre.

A typical weapon consists of a container packed with a fuel substance, the centre of which has a small conventional-explosive &quot;scatter charge&quot;. Fuels are chosen on the basis of the exothermicity of their oxidation, ranging from powdered metals, such as aluminium or magnesium, to organic materials, possibly with a self-contained partial oxidant. The most recent development involves the use of nanofuels.

A thermobaric bomb&#x27;s effective yield depends on a combination of a number of factors such as how well the fuel is dispersed, how rapidly it mixes with the surrounding atmosphere and the initiation of the igniter and its position relative to the container of fuel. In some designs, strong munitions cases allow the blast pressure to be contained long enough for the fuel to be heated well above its autoignition temperature so that once the container bursts, the superheated fuel autoignites progressively as it comes into contact with atmospheric oxygen.
Conventional upper and lower limits of flammability apply to such weapons. Close in, blast from the dispersal charge, compressing and heating the surrounding atmosphere, has some influence on the lower limit. The upper limit has been demonstrated to influence the ignition of fogs above pools of oil strongly. That weakness may be eliminated by designs in which the fuel is preheated well above its ignition temperature so that its cooling during its dispersion still results in a minimal ignition delay on mixing. The continual combustion of the outer layer of fuel molecules, as they come into contact with the air, generates added heat which maintains the temperature of the interior of the fireball, and thus sustains the detonation.

In confinement, a series of reflective shock waves is generated, which maintain the fireball and can extend its duration to between 10 and 50 ms as exothermic recombination reactions occur. Further damage can result as the gases cool and pressure drops sharply, leading to a partial vacuum. This rarefaction effect has given rise to the misnomer &quot;vacuum bomb&quot;. Piston-type afterburning is also believed to occur in such structures, as flame-fronts accelerate through it.

===Fuel–air explosive===
A fuel–air explosive (FAE) device consists of a container of fuel and two separate explosive charges. After the munition is dropped or fired, the first explosive charge bursts open the container at a predetermined height and disperses the fuel in a cloud that mixes with atmospheric oxygen (the size of the cloud varies with the size of the munition). The cloud of fuel flows around objects and into structures. The second charge then detonates the cloud and creates a massive blast wave. The blast wave can destroy reinforced buildings, equipment, and kill or injure people. The blast wave&#x27;s antipersonnel effect is magnified in confined spaces, such as foxholes, tunnels, bunkers and caves.

====Effects====
Conventional countermeasures such as barriers (sandbags) and personnel armour are not effective against thermobaric weapons. A Human Rights Watch report of 1 February 2000 quotes a study made by the US Defense Intelligence Agency:

According to a US Central Intelligence Agency study, 
Another Defense Intelligence Agency document speculates that, because the &quot;shock and pressure waves cause minimal damage to brain tissue... it is possible that victims of FAEs are not rendered unconscious by the blast, but instead suffer for several seconds or minutes while they suffocate&quot;.

==Development==
===German===
The first attempts occurred during the First World War when incendiary shells (in German &#x27;Brandgranate&#x27;) used a slow but intense burning material, such as tar impregnated tissue and gunpowder dust. These shells burned for approximately 2 minutes after the shell exploded and spread the burning elements in every direction.
In World War II, the German Wehrmacht attempted to develop a vacuum bomb, under the direction of the Austrian physicist Mario Zippermayr.

The weapon was claimed by a weapons specialist (K.L. Bergmann) to have been tested on the Eastern front under the code-name &quot;Taifun B&quot; and was ready for deployment during the Normandy invasion in June, 1944. Apparently, canisters of a charcoal, aluminium and aviation fuel would have been launched, followed with a secondary launch of incendiary rockets. It was destroyed by a Western artillery barrage minutes before being fired just before Operation Cobra.

===United States===

FAEs were developed by the United States for use in the Vietnam War. The CBU-55 FAE fuel-air cluster bomb was mostly developed by the US Naval Weapons Center at China Lake, California.

Current American FAE munitions include the following:
* BLU-73 FAE I
* BLU-95 (FAE-II)
* BLU-96 (FAE-II)
* CBU-72 FAE I
* AGM-114 Hellfire missile
* XM1060 grenade
* SMAW-NE round for rocket launcher

The XM1060 40-mm grenade is a small-arms thermobaric device, which was fielded by US forces in Afghanistan in 2002, and proved to be popular against targets in enclosed spaces, such as caves. Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the US Marine Corps has introduced a thermobaric &quot;Novel Explosive&quot; (SMAW-NE) round for the Mk 153 SMAW rocket launcher. One team of Marines reported that they had destroyed a large one-story masonry type building with one round from . The AGM-114N Hellfire II, uses a Metal Augmented Charge (MAC) warhead, which contains a thermobaric explosive fill that uses aluminium powder coated or mixed with PTFE layered between the charge casing and a PBXN-112 explosive mixture. When the PBXN-112 detonates, the aluminium mixture is dispersed and rapidly burns. The result is a sustained high pressure that is extremely effective against people and structures.

===Soviet, later Russian===
Following FAEs developed by the United States for use in the Vietnam War, Soviet Union scientists quickly developed their own FAE weapons. Since Afghanistan, research and development has continued, and Russian forces now field a wide array of third-generation FAE warheads, such as the RPO-A. The Russian armed forces have developed thermobaric ammunition variants for several of their weapons, such as the TBG-7V thermobaric grenade with a lethality radius of , which can be launched from a rocket propelled grenade (RPG) RPG-7. The GM-94 is a pump-action grenade launcher designed mainly to fire thermobaric grenades for close combat. The grenade weighed and contained of explosive, its lethality radius is , but due to the deliberate &quot;fragmentation-free&quot; design of the grenade, a distance of is considered safe.

The RPO-A and upgraded RPO-M are infantry-portable rocket propelled grenades designed to fire thermobaric rockets. The RPO-M, for instance, has a thermobaric warhead with a TNT equivalence of and destructive capabilities similar to a high-explosive fragmentation artillery shell. The RShG-1 and the RShG-2 are thermobaric variants of the RPG-27 and RPG-26 respectively. The RShG-1 is the more powerful variant, with its warhead having a lethality radius and producing about the same effect as of TNT. The RMG is a further derivative of the RPG-26 that uses a tandem-charge warhead, with the precursor high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead blasting an opening for the main thermobaric charge to enter and detonate inside. The RMG&#x27;s precursor HEAT warhead can penetrate 300 mm of reinforced concrete or over 100 mm of rolled homogeneous armour, thus allowing the -diameter thermobaric warhead to detonate inside.

Other examples include the semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) or millimeter-wave active radar homing guided thermobaric variants of the 9M123 Khrizantema, the 9M133F-1 thermobaric warhead variant of the 9M133 Kornet, and the 9M131F thermobaric warhead variant of the 9K115-2 Metis-M, all of which are anti-tank missiles. The Kornet has since been upgraded to the Kornet-EM, and its thermobaric variant has a maximum range of and has a TNT equivalence of . The 9M55S thermobaric cluster warhead rocket was built to be fired from the BM-30 Smerch MLRS. A dedicated carrier of thermobaric weapons is the purpose-built TOS-1, a 24-tube MLRS designed to fire thermobaric rockets. A full salvo from the TOS-1 will cover a rectangle . The Iskander-M theatre ballistic missile can also carry a thermobaric warhead.

Many Russian Air Force munitions have thermobaric variants. The S-8 rocket has the S-8DM and S-8DF thermobaric variants. The S-8&#x27;s brother, the S-13, has the S-13D and S-13DF thermobaric variants. The S-13DF&#x27;s warhead weighs only , but its power is equivalent to of TNT. The KAB-500-OD variant of the KAB-500KR has a thermobaric warhead. The ODAB-500PM and ODAB-500PMV unguided bombs carry a fuel–air explosive each. ODAB-1500 is a larger version of the bomb. The KAB-1500S GLONASS/GPS guided bomb also has a thermobaric variant. Its fireball will cover a radius and its lethal zone is a radius. The 9M120 Ataka-V and the 9K114 Shturm ATGMs both have thermobaric variants.

In September 2007, Russia exploded the largest thermobaric weapon ever made, and claimed that its yield was equivalent to that of a nuclear weapon. Russia named this particular ordnance the &quot;Father of All Bombs&quot; in response to the American-developed Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) bomb, which has the backronym &quot;Mother of All Bombs&quot; and once held the title of the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in history.

=== Iraq ===
Iraq was alleged to possess the technology as early as 1990.

=== Israel ===
Israel was alleged to possess thermobaric technology as early as 1990, according to Pentagon sources.

=== Spain ===
In 1983, a program of military research was launched with collaboration between the Spanish Ministry of Defence (Directorate General of Armament and Material, DGAM) and Explosivos Alaveses (EXPAL) which was a subsidiary of Unión Explosivos Río Tinto (ERT). The goal of the programme was to develop a thermobaric bomb, the BEAC (&quot;Bomba Explosiva de Aire-Combustible&quot;). A prototype was tested successfully in a foreign location out of safety and confidentiality concerns. The Spanish Air and Space Force has an undetermined number of BEACs in its inventory.

=== China ===
In 1996, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) began development of the , a portable thermobaric rocket launcher, based on the Soviet RPO-A Shmel. Introduced in 2000 it is reported to weigh 3.5 kg and contains 2.1 kg of thermobaric filler. An improved version called the PF-97A was introduced in 2008.

China is reported to have other thermobaric weapons, including bombs, grenades and rockets. Research continues on thermobaric weapons capable of reaching 2,500 degrees.

=== Brazil ===
In 2004, under the request of the &quot;Estado Maior da Aeronáutica&quot; (Military Staff of Aeronautics) and the &quot;Diretoria de Material Aeronáutico e Bélico&quot; (Board of Aeronautical and Military Equipment) the &quot;Instituto de Aeronautica e Espaço&quot; (Institute of Aeronautics and Space) started developing a thermobaric bomb called Trocano .

Trocano is a thermobaric weapon similar in design to the United States&#x27; MOAB weapon or Russia&#x27;s FOAB. Like the US weapon, the Trocano was designed to be pallet-loaded into a C-130 Hercules aircraft, and deployed using a parachute to drag it from the C-130&#x27;s cargo bay and separate the bomb from its pallet.

=== United Kingdom ===
In 2009, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) acknowledged that Army Air Corps (AAC) AgustaWestland Apaches had used AGM-114 Hellfire missiles purchased from the United States against Taliban forces in Afghanistan. The MoD stated that 20 missiles, described as &quot;blast fragmentation warheads&quot;, were used in 2008 and a further 20 in 2009. MoD officials told &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Richard Norton-Taylor that the missiles were &quot;particularly designed to take down structures and kill everyone in the buildings&quot;, as AAC AgustaWestland Apaches were previously equipped with weapon systems deemed ineffective to combat the Taliban. The MoD also stated that &quot;British pilots&#x27; rules of engagement were strict and everything a pilot sees from the cockpit is recorded.&quot;

In 2018, the MoD accidentally divulged the details of General Atomics MQ-9 Reapers utilised by the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Syrian civil war, which revealed that the drones were equipped with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. The MoD had sent a report to a British publication, &quot;Drone Wars&quot;, in response to a freedom of information request. In the report, it was stated that AGM-114N Hellfire missiles which contained a thermobaric warhead were used by RAF attack drones in Syria.

===India===
Based on the high-explosive squash head (HESH) round, a 120 mm thermobaric round was developed in the 2010s by the Indian Ministry of Defence. This HESH round packs thermobaric explosives into the tank shells to increase the effectiveness against enemy bunkers and light armoured vehicles.

The design and the development of the round was taken up by Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE). The rounds were designed for the Arjun MBT. The TB rounds contains fuel rich explosive composition called thermobaric explosive. As the name implies, the shells, when they hit a target, produce blast overpressure and heat energy for hundreds of milliseconds. The overpressure and heat causes damage to enemy fortified structures like bunkers and buildings and for soft targets like enemy personnel and light armoured vehicles.

===Serbia===
The company Balkan Novoteh, formed in 2011, provides the Thermobaric hand grenade TG-1 to the market.

Military Technical Institute in Belgrade has developed a technology for producing cast-cured thermobaric PBX explosives. Since recently, the Factory of Explosives and Pyrotechnics TRAYAL Corporation has been producing cast-cured thermobaric PBX formulations.

===Ukraine===
In 2017 Ukroboronprom&#x27;s Scientific Research Institute for Chemical Products in conjunction with (aka Artem Holding Company) announced to the market its new product, the . These can be combined with the grenade launcher, a demonstration of which was witnessed by Oleksandr Turchynov. The grenades, of approximately 600 grams, &quot;create a two second fire cloud with a volume of not less than 13 m³, inside of which the temperature reaches 2,500 degrees. This temperature allows not only for the destruction of the enemy, but are also able to disable lightly armored vehicles.&quot; The firm showed them at the Azerbaijan International Defense Exhibition in 2018.

In 2024, Ukraine started using drones rigged with thermobaric explosives to strike Russian positions in the Russo-Ukrainian War.

==History==
===Attempted prohibitions===
Mexico, Switzerland and Sweden presented in 1980 a joint motion to the United Nations to prohibit the use of thermobaric weapons, to no avail.

United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research categorises these weapons as &quot;enhanced blast weapons&quot; and there was pressure to regulate these around 2010, again to no avail.

===Military use===

====United States====
FAEs such as first-generation CBU-55 fuel–air weapons saw extensive use in the Vietnam War. A second generation of FAE weapons were based on those, and were used by the United States in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. A total of 254 CBU-72s were dropped by the United States Marine Corps, mostly from A-6Es. They were targeted against mine fields and personnel in trenches, but were more useful as a psychological weapon.

The US military used thermobaric weapons in Afghanistan. On 3 March 2002, a single laser guided thermobaric bomb was used by the United States Air Force against cave complexes in which Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters had taken refuge in the Gardez region of Afghanistan. The SMAW-NE was used by the US Marines during the First Battle of Fallujah and the Second Battle of Fallujah. The AGM-114N Hellfire II was first used by US forces in 2003 in Iraq.

====Soviet Union====
FAEs were reportedly used against China in the 1969 Sino-Soviet border conflict.

The TOS-1 system was test fired in Panjshir Valley during the Soviet–Afghan War in the late 1980s. MiG-27 attack aircraft of the 134th APIB used ODAB-500S/P fuel–air bombs against Mujahideen forces in Afghanistan, but they were found to be unreliable and dangerous to ground crew.

====Russia====

Russian military forces reportedly used ground-delivered thermobaric weapons during the Battle for Grozny (first and second Chechen Wars) to attack dug-in Chechen fighters. The use of TOS-1 heavy MLRS and &quot;RPO-A Shmel&quot; shoulder-fired rocket system during the Chechen Wars is reported to have occurred. Russia used the RPO-A Shmel in the First Battle of Grozny, whereupon it was designated as a very useful round.

It was thought that, during the September 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis, a multitude of handheld thermobaric weapons were used by the Russian Armed Forces in their efforts to retake the school. The RPO-A and either the TGB-7V thermobaric rocket from the RPG-7 or rockets from either the RShG-1 or the RShG-2 is claimed to have been used by the Spetsnaz during the initial storming of the school. At least three and as many as nine RPO-A casings were later found at the positions of the Spetsnaz. In July 2005 the Russian government admitted to the use of the RPO-A during the crisis.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, CNN reported that Russian forces were moving thermobaric weapons into Ukraine. On 28 February 2022, Ukraine&#x27;s ambassador to the United States accused Russia of deploying a thermobaric bomb. Russia has claimed to have used the weapon in March 2024 against Ukrainian soldiers in an unspecified location (denied by Ukraine), and during the August 2024 Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast.

====United Kingdom====

During the War in Afghanistan, British forces, including the Army Air Corps and Royal Air Force, used thermobaric AGM-114N Hellfire missiles against the Taliban. In the Syrian civil war, British military drones used AGM-114N Hellfire missiles; in the first three months of 2018, British drones fired 92 Hellfire missiles in Syria.

====Israel====
A report by Human Rights Watch claimed Israel has used thermobaric weaponry in the past including the 2008–2009 conflict in Gaza. Moreover, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor states that Israel appears to be using thermobaric weaponry in the current 2023 Israel-Hamas War. Both organizations claim that the use of this weaponry in densely populated neighborhoods violates international humanitarian law due to its damaging affects on civilians and civilian structures.&quot;&quot; The Eurasian Times reported that an Israeli AH-64D Apache attack helicopter was photographed with a &#x27;mystery&#x27; warhead with a red band that was speculated to be a thermobaric warhead capable of destroying Hamas tunnels and multi-story buildings.

====Syria====
Reports by the rebel fighters of the Free Syrian Army claim the Syrian Air Force used such weapons against residential area targets occupied by the rebel fighters, such as during the Battle of Aleppo and in Kafar Batna. Others contend that in 2012 the Syrian government used an bomb in Azaz. A United Nations panel of human rights investigators reported that the Syrian government had used thermobaric bombs against the rebellious town of Al-Qusayr in March 2013.

The Russia and Syrian governments have used thermobaric bombs and other thermobaric munitions during the Syrian civil war against insurgents and insurgent-held civilian areas.

====Ukraine====
Mikhail Tolstykh, a top rank pro-Russian officer in the war in Donbas was killed on 8 February 2017 at his office in Donetsk by an RPO-A rocket fired by members of the Security Service of Ukraine. In March 2023 soldiers from the 59th Motorised Brigade of Ukraine showed off the destruction of a derelict Russian infantry fighting vehicle by a thermobaric RGT-27S2 hand grenade delivered by Mavic 3 drone.

====Non-state actor use====

Thermobaric and fuel–air explosives have been used in guerrilla warfare since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing in Lebanon, which used a gas-enhanced explosive mechanism that was probably propane, butane, or acetylene. The explosive used by the bombers in the US 1993 World Trade Center bombing incorporated the FAE principle by using three tanks of bottled hydrogen gas to enhance the blast.

Jemaah Islamiyah bombers used a shock-dispersed solid fuel charge, based on the thermobaric principle, to attack the Sari nightclub during the 2002 Bali bombings.

== International law ==
International law does not prohibit the use of thermobaric munitions, fuel-air explosive devices, or vacuum bombs against military targets. , all past attempts to regulate or restrict thermobaric weapons have failed.

According to some scholars, thermobaric weapons are not intrinsically indiscriminate by nature, as they are often engineered for precision targeting capabilities. This precision aspect serves to provide humanitarian advantages by potentially minimizing collateral damage and also lessens the amount of munitions needed to effectively engage with the chosen military goals. Nonetheless, authors holding this view recommend that the use of thermobaric weapons in populated areas should be minimised due to their wide-area impact and multiple harm mechanisms.

== In media ==
In the 1995 film &quot;Outbreak&quot;, a thermobaric weapon (referred to as a fuel air bomb) is used to destroy an African village to keep the perfect biological weapon (a virus) a secret, and later nearly used to wipe out a US town to keep the original virus intact.

<text>Tabasco is an American brand of hot sauce made from vinegar, tabasco peppers and salt. It is produced by the McIlhenny Company of Avery Island in southern Louisiana, having been created over 150 years ago by Edmund McIlhenny. Originally the tabasco peppers were grown only on Avery Island; they are now primarily cultivated in Central America, South America and Africa. The Tabasco sauce brand also has multiple varieties including the original red sauce, habanero, jalapeño, chipotle, sriracha and Trinidad Moruga scorpion. Tabasco products are sold in more than 195 countries and territories, and packaged in 36 languages and dialects.

==History==

According to the company&#x27;s official history, Tabasco was first produced in 1868 by Edmund McIlhenny, a Maryland-born former banker who moved to Louisiana around 1840. However, as Jeffrey Rothfeder&#x27;s book &quot;McIlhenny&#x27;s Gold&quot; points out, some of the McIlhenny Company&#x27;s official history is disputed, and the politician Maunsel White was producing a tabasco pepper sauce two decades before McIlhenny. A 2007 book review by Mark Robichaux of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; quotes Rothfeder&#x27;s book:

Rothfeder cited January 26, 1850, letter to the &quot;New Orleans Daily Delta&quot; newspaper crediting White as having introduced &quot;Tobasco red pepper&quot; (sic) to the southern United States and asserting that the McIlhenny was at least inspired by White&#x27;s recipe. Jean Andrews, in her book &quot;Peppers: The Domesticated Capsicums&quot;, goes further to declare—citing United States Circuit Court testimony from 1922—that prior to his death in 1862, &quot;White gave some [pepper] pods, along with his recipe, to his friend Edmund McIlhenny, during a visit to White&#x27;s Deer Range Plantation.&quot; To distribute his, Edmund McIlhenny initially obtained unused cologne bottles from a New Orleans glass supplier. On his death in 1890, McIlhenny was succeeded by his eldest son, John Avery McIlhenny, who expanded and modernized the business, but resigned after only a few years in order to join Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s 1st US Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, the Rough Riders. On John&#x27;s departure, brother Edward Avery McIlhenny, a self-taught naturalist fresh from an Arctic adventure, assumed control of the company and also focused on expansion and modernization, running the business from 1898 until his death in 1949. Walter S. McIlhenny in turn succeeded his uncle Edward Avery McIlhenny, serving as president of McIlhenny Company from 1949 until his death in 1985. Edward McIlhenny Simmons then ran the company as president and CEO for several years, remaining as board chairman until his death in 2012. Paul McIlhenny became company president in 1998 and was chairman until his death in 2013. In 2012 McIlhenny cousin Tony Simmons assumed the company&#x27;s presidency and in June 2019 his cousin Harold Osborn was chosen as the next president and CEO. McIlhenny was one of just a few U.S. companies to have received a royal warrant of appointment that certified the company as a supplier to Queen Elizabeth II. McIlhenny was one of the 850 companies around the world that have been officially designated as suppliers to the queen by such warrants. The warrant held was &quot;Supplier of Tabasco HM The Queen — Master of the Household — Granted in 2009&quot;. In 2005, Avery Island was hit hard by Hurricane Rita, and the family constructed a -high levee around the low side of the factory and invested in back-up generators.

==Production==

Originally, all peppers used in Tabasco sauce were grown on Avery Island. Over time, growers were selected throughout Louisiana to accommodate demand and during the 1960s, the company established farms in various Latin American countries. peppers grown on the Island are used to produce seed stock, which is then shipped to foreign growers. More predictable weather and readily available farmland in these locales allow a constant year-round supply. This ensures the availability of peppers should severe weather or other problems occur at a particular growing location. Following company tradition, peppers are picked by hand. To ensure ripeness, pickers compare peppers to a little red stick (&quot;le petit bâton rouge&quot;); peppers that match the color of the stick are then introduced into the sauce production process. Peppers are ground into a mash on the day of harvest and placed along with salt in white oak barrels previously used for whiskey of various distilleries. To prepare the barrel, the inside of the barrel is de-charred (top layer of wood is removed), torched, and cleaned, to minimize the presence of any residual whiskey. The barrels are then used in warehouses on Avery Island for aging the mash. After aging for up to three years, the mash is strained to remove skins and seeds. The resulting liquid is then mixed with distilled vinegar, stirred occasionally for a month, and then bottled as a finished sauce. Tabasco has released a Tabasco reserve edition with peppers aged for up to eight years, mixed with wine vinegar. Tabasco Diamond Reserve Edition was a limited bottling released in 2018 to commemorate the brand&#x27;s 150th anniversary. This sauce consists of peppers that have been aged for up to fifteen years, then mixed with sparkling white wine vinegar. For many years the salt used in Tabasco production came from the Avery Island salt dome, the largest such structure along the Louisiana coast.

==Varieties==

Several sauces are produced under the &quot;Tabasco&quot; brand name. A few of the varieties include:

===Current Sauces===
* Buffalo Style Hot Sauce
* Cayenne garlic
* Chipotle Sauce
* Family Reserve
* Green Jalapeño Sauce
* Habanero
* Original Red Sauce
* Raspberry Chipotle
* Roasted Pepper Sauce 
* Salsa Picante
* Scorpion Sauce
* Sriracha
* Sweet &amp; Spicy

===Discontinued Sauces ===
* Rocoto pepper sauce

The habanero, chipotle, and garlic sauces include the tabasco peppers blended with other peppers, whereas the jalapeño variety does not include tabasco peppers. None of these sauces, however, has the three-year aging process the flagship product uses. The brand also produces a selection of Tabasco Chocolate.

==Spiciness==

==Packaging==

Tabasco brand pepper sauce is sold in more than 195 countries and territories and is packaged in 36 languages and dialects. The Tabasco bottle is still modeled after the cologne-style bottles used for the first batch of sauce in 1868. As many as 720,000 two-ounce (57 ml) bottles of Tabasco sauce are produced daily at the Tabasco factory on Avery Island. Bottles range from the common two-ounce and five-ounce (59 ml and 148 ml) bottles, up to a jug for food service businesses, and down to a miniature bottle. There are also portion control (PC) packets of Tabasco sauce. One-eighth-ounce bottles of Tabasco, bearing the presidential seal, are served on Air Force One. The US military has included Tabasco sauce in Meals, Ready-to-Eat (MREs) since the 1980s. The Australian, British and Canadian armies also issue small bottles of Tabasco sauce in their rations.
==Uses==
McIlhenny Company produces or has produced Tabasco brand products that contain pepper seasoning, including chocolate, popcorn, nuts, olives, mayonnaise, mustard, steak sauce, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, Sriracha sauce, marinating sauce, barbecue sauce, chili sauce, pepper jelly, and Bloody Mary mix. McIlhenny Company also permits other brands to use and advertise Tabasco sauce as an ingredient in their products (a common marketing practice called &quot;co-branding&quot;), including Spam, Hormel chili, Slim Jim beef sticks, Heinz ketchup, A1 steak sauce, Plochman&#x27;s mustard, Lawry&#x27;s salt, Zapp&#x27;s potato chips, Heluva Good dip, and Vlasic Pickles. Cheez-It crackers for a long time used McIlhenny&#x27;s Tabasco Green Pepper Sauce until 2018, when Kellogg&#x27;s replaced it with their own hot sauce. The original red Tabasco sauce has a shelf life of three years when stored in a cool and dry place; other Tabasco flavors have shorter shelf lives. Tabasco appeared on the menu of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program and went into orbit on the Shuttles. It was on Skylab and on the International Space Station and is popular with astronauts as a means of countering the blandness of food in space.

===Cookbooks===
During the Vietnam War, Brigadier General Walter S. McIlhenny issued &quot;The Charlie Ration Cookbook&quot;. (Charlie ration or &quot;C-Rats&quot; was the name for the field meal then given to troops.) This cookbook came wrapped around a two-ounce bottle of Tabasco sauce in a camouflaged, water-resistant container. It instructed troops how to mix C-rations to make such meals as &quot;Combat Canapés&quot; or &quot;Breast of Chicken under Bullets.&quot; Soldiers also requested their families to send them Tabasco sauce in &quot;care packages&quot; from home. During the 1980s, the U.S. military began to include miniature bottles of Tabasco sauce in its MREs. Eventually, miniature bottles of Tabasco sauce were included in two-thirds of all MRE menus. During the same period, McIlhenny Company issued a new military-oriented cookbook using characters from the comic strip &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;. Titled &quot;The Unofficial MRE Cookbook&quot;, it was offered free of charge to U.S. troops.

== Toxicity ==
In a 1982 article titled &quot;Pepper Sauce Toxicity&quot; Tabasco pepper sauce&#x27;s toxicity was evaluated based on red peppers and vinegar. Sprague-Dawley rats (lab rats) were utilized as test subjects. The oral median lethal dose in male lab rats was determined to be 23.58 mL/kg body weight (BW) with an upper limit of 29.75 mL/kg BW and a lower limit of 18.70 mL/kg BW. The median lethal dose in the female lab rats was found to be 19.52 mL/kg BW (15.64 mL/kg BW lower, 24.35 mL/kg BW upper). The sauce was found to be a mild skin irritant and a moderate to severe eye irritant. The toxicity to the eye is mainly caused by vinegar.

==In art and culture==
In 1894 composer George W. Chadwick composed the &quot;Burlesque Opera of Tabasco&quot;, a musical comedy that conductor Paul Mauffray revived in 2018 with support from McIlhenny Company. 

Tabasco has appeared in many movies and cartoons, as well as on television. It featured in two James Bond films in the 1970s, &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; and &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, as well as a shot of the iconic bottle in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s 1974 film &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;. Some appearances date as far back as the Our Gang short &quot;Birthday Blues&quot; in 1932 and Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Modern Times&quot; in 1936. In &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;, the saloon bartender uses Tabasco as an ingredient for an instant hangover cure he calls &quot;wake-up juice&quot;. Tabasco sauce was also an important element in the television series &quot;Roswell&quot; about alien/human hybrid teenagers who craved foods that were sweet and spicy and often carried bottles of Tabasco sauce with them. When the network tried to cancel the series in the first season, thousands of fans mailed bottles of Tabasco to the network to show their support. The series continued for three seasons.

In the 2009 Disney animated film The Princess and the Frog Tiana is seen using Tabasco sauce for her gumbo soup. Later on, in the year 2024 Tiana&#x27;s Bayou Adventure also features Tabasco sauce as part of the Disneyland and Disney World attraction and is used in Tiana&#x27;s Palace restaurant meals.

In the &quot;Leykis 101&quot; segment of his talk radio show, Tom Leykis advocated for men putting Tabasco sauce in their condoms after sexual intercourse to act as a spermicide and prevent a woman potentially &quot;stealing the sperm&quot; and using it to impregnate herself. In 2022, a story circulated widely on the internet that the rapper Drake did this after having sex with an Instagram model. However, Tabasco&#x27;s usefulness as a spermicide is questionable.

<doc id="31422" wikidata="Q134583" url="?curid=31422" title="Talc">
<text>Talc, or talcum, is a clay mineral composed of hydrated magnesium silicate, with the chemical formula . Talc in powdered form, often combined with corn starch, is used as baby powder. This mineral is used as a thickening agent and lubricant. It is an ingredient in ceramics, paints, and roofing material. It is a main ingredient in many cosmetics. It occurs as foliated to fibrous masses, and in an exceptionally rare crystal form. It has a perfect basal cleavage and an uneven flat fracture, and it is foliated with a two-dimensional platy form.

The Mohs scale of mineral hardness, based on scratch hardness comparison, defines value 1 as the hardness of talc, the softest mineral. When scraped on a streak plate, talc produces a white streak, though this indicator is of little importance, because most silicate minerals produce a white streak. Talc is translucent to opaque, with colors ranging from whitish grey to green with a vitreous and pearly luster. Talc is not soluble in water, and is slightly soluble in dilute mineral acids.

Soapstone is a metamorphic rock composed predominantly of talc.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;talc&quot; derives from &quot;tālk&quot;. In ancient times, the word was used for various related minerals, including talc, mica, and selenite.

==Formation==
Talc dominantly forms from the metamorphism of magnesian minerals such as serpentine, pyroxene, amphibole, and olivine, in the presence of carbon dioxide and water. This is known as &quot;talc carbonation&quot; or &quot;steatization&quot; and produces a suite of rocks known as talc carbonates.

Talc is primarily formed by hydration and carbonation by this reaction:

Talc can also be formed via a reaction between dolomite and silica, which is typical of skarnification of dolomites by silica-flooding in contact metamorphic aureoles:

Talc can also be formed from magnesium chlorite and quartz in blueschist and eclogite metamorphism by the following metamorphic reaction:

:chlorite + quartz → kyanite + talc + water

Talc is also found as a diagenetic mineral in sedimentary rocks where it can form from the transformation of metastable hydrated magnesium-clay precursors such as kerolite, sepiolite, or stevensite that can precipitate from marine and lake water in certain conditions.

In this reaction, the ratio of talc and kyanite depends on aluminium content, with more aluminous rocks favoring production of kyanite. This is typically associated with high-pressure, low-temperature minerals such as phengite, garnet, and glaucophane within the lower blueschist facies. Such rocks are typically white, friable, and fibrous, and are known as
whiteschist.

Talc is a trioctahedral layered mineral; its structure is similar to pyrophyllite, but with magnesium in the octahedral sites of the composite layers. The crystal structure of talc is described as &quot;TOT&quot;, meaning that it is composed of parallel &quot;TOT&quot; layers weakly bonded to each other by weak van der Waals forces. The &quot;TOT&quot; layers in turn consist of two tetrahedral sheets (&quot;T&quot;) strongly bonded to the two faces of a single trioctahedral sheet (&quot;O&quot;). It is the weak bonding between &quot;TOT&quot; layers that gives talc its perfect basal cleavage and softness.

The tetrahedral sheets consist of silica tetrahedra, which are silicon ions surrounded by four oxygen ions. The tetrahedra each share three of their four oxygen ions with neighboring tetrahedra to produce a hexagonal sheet. The remaining oxygen ion (the &quot;apical&quot; oxygen ion) is available to bond with the trioctahedral sheet.

The trioctahedral sheet has the structure of a sheet of the mineral brucite. Apical oxygens take the place of some of the hydroxyl ions that would be present in a brucite sheet, bonding the tetrahedral sheets tightly to the trioctahedral sheet.

Tetrahedral sheets have a negative charge, since their bulk composition is Si4O104-. The trioctahedral sheet has an equal positive charge, since its bulk composition is Mg3(OH)24+ The combined TOT layer thus is electrically neutral.

Because the hexagons in the T and O sheets are slightly different in size, the sheets are slightly distorted when they bond into a TOT layer. This breaks the hexagonal symmetry and reduces it to monoclinic or triclinic symmetry. However, the original hexahedral symmetry is discernible in the pseudotrigonal character of talc crystals.

==Occurrence==

Talc is a common metamorphic mineral in metamorphic belts that contain ultramafic rocks, such as soapstone (a high-talc rock), and within whiteschist and blueschist metamorphic terranes. Prime examples of whiteschists include the Franciscan Metamorphic Belt of the western United States, the western European Alps especially in Italy, certain areas of the Musgrave Block, and some collisional orogens such as the Himalayas, which stretch along Pakistan, India, Nepal, and Bhutan.

Talc carbonate ultramafics are typical of many areas of the Archaean cratons, notably the komatiite belts of the Yilgarn Craton in Western Australia. Talc-carbonate ultramafics are also known from the Lachlan Fold Belt, eastern Australia, from Brazil, the Guiana Shield, and from the ophiolite belts of Turkey, Oman, and the Middle East.

China is the key world talc and steatite-producing country with an output of about 2.2M tonnes(2016), which accounts for 30% of total global output. The other major producers are Brazil (12%), India (11%), the U.S. (9%), France (6%), Finland (4%), Italy, Russia, Canada, and Austria (2%, each).

Notable economic talc occurrences include the Mount Seabrook talc mine, Western Australia, formed upon a polydeformed, layered ultramafic intrusion. The France-based Luzenac Group is the world&#x27;s largest supplier of mined talc. Its largest talc mine at Trimouns near Luzenac in southern France produces 400,000 tonnes of talc per year.

==Conflict mineral==
Extraction in disputed areas of Nangarhar province, Afghanistan, has led the international monitoring group Global Witness to declare talc a conflict resource, as the profits are used to fund armed confrontation between the Taliban and Islamic State.

==Uses==
Talc is used in many industries, including paper making, plastic, paint and coatings (e.g. for metal casting molds), rubber, food, electric cable, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and ceramics. A coarse grayish-green high-talc rock is soapstone or steatite, used for stoves, sinks, electrical switchboards, etc. It is often used for surfaces of laboratory table tops and electrical switchboards because of its resistance to heat, electricity, and acids.

In finely ground form, talc finds use as a cosmetic (talcum powder), as a lubricant, and as a filler in paper manufacture. It is used to coat the insides of inner tubes and rubber gloves during manufacture to keep the surfaces from sticking. Talcum powder, with heavy refinement, has been used in baby powder, an astringent powder used to prevent diaper rash (nappy rash). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents avoid using baby powder because it poses a risk of respiratory problems, including breathing trouble and serious lung damage if inhaled. The small size of the particles makes it difficult to keep them out of the air while applying the powder. Zinc oxide-based ointments are a much safer alternative.

Soapstone (massive talc) is often used as a marker for welding or metalworking.

Talc is also used as food additive or in pharmaceutical products as a glidant. In medicine, talc is used as a pleurodesis agent to prevent recurrent pleural effusion or pneumothorax. In the European Union, the additive number is E553b. Talc may be used in the processing of white rice as a buffing agent in the polishing stage.

Due to its low shear strength, talc is one of the oldest known solid lubricants. Also, limited use is made of talc as a friction-reducing additive in lubricating oils.

Talc is widely used in the ceramics industry in both bodies and glazes. In low-fire art-ware bodies, it imparts whiteness and increases thermal expansion to resist crazing. In stonewares, small percentages of talc are used to flux the body and therefore improve strength and vitrification. It is a source of MgO flux in high-temperature glazes (to control melting temperature). It is also employed as a matting agent in earthenware glazes and can be used to produce magnesia mattes at high temperatures.

ISO standard for quality (ISO 3262)

Patents are pending on the use of magnesium silicate as a cement substitute. Its production requirements are less energy-intensive than ordinary Portland cement (at a heating requirement of around 650 °C for talc compared to 1500 °C for limestone to produce Portland cement), while it absorbs far more carbon dioxide as it hardens. This results in a negative carbon footprint overall, as the cement substitute removes 0.6 tonnes of CO2 per tonne used. This contrasts with a positive carbon footprint of 0.4 tonnes per tonne of conventional cement.

Talc is used in the production of the materials that are widely used in the building interiors such as base content paints in wall coatings. Other areas that use talc to a great extent are organic agriculture, the food industry, cosmetics, and hygiene products such as baby powder and detergent powder.

Talc is sometimes used as an adulterant to illegal heroin, to expand volume and weight and thereby increase its street value. With intravenous use, it may lead to pulmonary talcosis, a granulomatous inflammation in the lungs.

===Sterile talc powder===
Sterile talc powder (NDC 63256-200-05) is a sclerosing agent used in the procedure of pleurodesis. This can be helpful as a cancer treatment to prevent pleural effusions (an abnormal collection of fluid in the space between the lungs and the thoracic wall). It is inserted into the space via a chest tube, causing it to close up, so fluid cannot collect there. The product can be sterilized by dry heat, ethylene oxide, or gamma irradiation.

==Safety==
Suspicions have been raised that talc use contributes to certain types of disease, mainly cancers of the ovaries and lungs. According to the IARC, talc containing asbestos is classified as a group 1 agent (carcinogenic to humans), talc use in the perineum is classified as group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans), and talc not containing asbestos is classified as group 2A (probably carcinogenic to humans). Reviews by Cancer Research UK and the American Cancer Society conclude that some studies have found a link, but other studies have not.

The studies discuss pulmonary issues, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. One of these, published in 1993, was a US National Toxicology Program report, which found that cosmetic grade talc containing no asbestos-like fibres was correlated with tumor formation in rats forced to inhale talc for 6 hours a day, five days a week over at least 113 weeks. A 1971 paper found particles of talc embedded in 75% of the ovarian tumors studied. In 2018, Health Canada issued a warning against inhaling talcum powder or women&#x27;s using it perineally.

In contrast, however, research published in 1995 and 2000 concluded that, although it was plausible that talc could cause ovarian cancer, no conclusive evidence had been shown. Further, a 2008 European Journal of Cancer Prevention review of ovarian cancer and talc use studies pointed out that, although many of them examined the duration, frequency, and accumulation of hygienic talc use, few found a positive association among these factors and some found a negative one: “It may be argued that the overall null findings associated with talc-dusted diaphragms and condom use is more convincing evidence for a lack of a carcinogenic effect, especially given the lack of an established correlation between perineal dusting frequency and ovarian tissue talc concentrations and the lack of a consistent dose-response relationship with ovarian cancer risk.&quot; Instead, the authors credited powdered talc with &quot;a high degree of safety.”

Similarly, in a 2014 article published in a leading cancer journal, the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, researchers reported the results of a survey of 61,576 postmenopausal women, more than half of whom had used talc powder perineally. The researchers compared the subjects’ reports of their own talc use with their reports of having had ovarian cancer diagnosed by their doctors, and found, regardless of subjects’ age and tubal ligation status, “Ever use of perineal powder ... was not associated with risk of ovarian cancer compared with never use,” nor was any greater individual cancer risk associated with longer use of talc powder. On this basis, the article concluded, “perineal powder use does not appear to influence ovarian cancer risk.” The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel concluded in 2015 that talc, in the concentrations currently used in cosmetics, is safe.

In July 2024, the International Agency for Research on Cancer listed talc as &quot;probably&quot; carcinogenic for humans. The study is based on limited evidence it could cause ovarian cancer in humans.

===Industrial grade===
In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have set occupational exposure limits to respirable talc dusts at 2 mg/m3 over an eight-hour workday. At levels of 1000 mg/m3, inhalation of talc is considered immediately dangerous to life and health.

===Food grade===
The United States Food and Drug Administration considers talc (magnesium silicate) generally recognized as safe (GRAS) to use as an anticaking agent in table salt in concentrations smaller than 2%.

===Association with asbestos===
One particular issue with commercial use of talc is its frequent co-location in underground deposits with asbestos ore. Asbestos is a general term for different types of fibrous silicate minerals, desirable in construction for their heat resistant properties. There are six varieties of asbestos; the most common variety in manufacturing, white asbestos, is in the serpentine family. Serpentine minerals are sheet silicates; although not in the serpentine family, talc is also a sheet silicate, with two sheets connected by magnesium cations. The frequent co-location of talc deposits with asbestos may result in contamination of mined talc with white asbestos, which poses serious health risks when dispersed into the air and inhaled. Stringent quality control since 1976, including separating cosmetic- and food-grade talc from that destined for industrial use, has largely eliminated this issue, but it remains a potential hazard requiring mitigation in the mining and processing of talc. A 2010 US FDA survey failed to find asbestos in a variety of talc-containing products. A 2018 Reuters investigation asserted that pharmaceuticals company Johnson &amp; Johnson knew for decades that there was asbestos in its baby powder, and in 2020 the company stopped selling its baby powder in the US and Canada. There were calls for Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s largest shareholders to force the company to end global sales of baby powder, and hire an independent firm to conduct a racial justice audit as it had been marketed to African American and overweight women. On August 11, 2022, the company announced it would stop making talc-based powder by 2023 and replace it with cornstarch-based powders. The company said the talc-based powder is safe to use and does not contain asbestos.

==Litigation==

In 2006 the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified talcum powder as a possible human carcinogen if used in the female genital area. Despite this, no federal agency in the US acted to remove talcum powder from the market or add warnings.

In February 2016, as the result of a lawsuit against Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J), a St. Louis jury awarded $72 million to the family of an Alabama woman who died from ovarian cancer. The family claimed that the use of talcum powder was responsible for her cancer.

In May 2016, a South Dakota woman was awarded $55 million as the result of another lawsuit against J&amp;J. The woman had used Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Baby Powder for more than 35 years before being diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2011.

In October 2016, a St. Louis jury awarded $70.1 million to a Californian woman with ovarian cancer who had used Johnson&#x27;s Baby Powder for 45 years.

In August 2017, a Los Angeles jury awarded $417 million to a Californian woman, Eva Echeverria, who developed ovarian cancer as a &quot;proximate result of the unreasonably dangerous and defective nature of talcum powder&quot;, her lawsuit against Johnson &amp; Johnson stated. On 20 October 2017, Los Angeles Superior Court judge Maren Nelson dismissed the verdict. The judge stated that Echeverria proved there is &quot;an ongoing debate in the scientific and medical community about whether talc more probably than not causes ovarian cancer and thus (gives) rise to a duty to warn&quot;, but not enough to sustain the jury&#x27;s imposition of liability against Johnson &amp; Johnson stated, and concluded that Echeverria did not adequately establish that talc causes ovarian cancer.

In July 2018, a court in St. Louis awarded a $4.7bn claim ($4.14bn in punitive damages and $550m in compensatory damages) against J&amp;J to 22 claimant women, concluding that the company had suppressed evidence of asbestos in its products for more than four decades.

At least 1,200 to 2,000 other talcum powder-related lawsuits were pending .

In 2020 J&amp;J stopped sales of its talcum-based baby powder, which it had been selling for 130 years. J&amp;J created a subsidiary responsible for the claims in an effort to resolve the lawsuits in bankruptcy court. In 2023 J&amp;J proposed a nearly $9bn settlement with 50,000 claimants saying the claims were &quot;specious&quot; but it wanted to move on from the issue, but judges blocked the plans, ruling that the subsidiary was not in financial distress and could not use the bankruptcy system to resolve the lawsuits. 

In July 2023 J&amp;J sued researchers who linked talc to cancer alleging they used junk science to disparage company&#x27;s products, while defendants say the lawsuits are meant to silence scientists.

<doc id="31423" wikidata="Q703541" url="?curid=31423" title="Tom Collins">
<text>The Tom Collins is a Collins cocktail made from gin, lemon juice, sugar, and carbonated water. This &quot;gin and sparkling lemonade&quot; drink is typically served in a Collins glass over ice with a cherry garnish. A non-alcoholic &quot;Collins mix&quot; mixer is produced, enjoyed by some as a soft drink.

==History==
The earliest publication of any Collins, as well as any Fizz recipe, are both located in the same book, American bartender and author Harry Johnson&#x27;s 1882 &quot;Harry Johnson&#x27;s&quot; &quot;New and Improved Bartender’s Manual, or How to Mix Drinks of the Present Style, in English and German.&quot; The book includes a Tom Collins calling for Old Tom gin and a John Collins calling for Holland Gin, most likely what is now known as Genièvre.

Johnson&#x27;s recipe for Tom Collins from 1882 is as follows:

* Three-quarters table-spoon of sugar
* 3 or 4 dashes of lime or lemon juice
* 3 or 4 pieces of broken ice
* 1 wine glass full of Old Tom gin
* 1 bottle of plain soda water
* Instructions: mix up well with a spoon, remove the ice, and serve. Attention must be paid not to let the foam of the soda water spread over the glass.

Cocktail historian David Wondrich stated that there are several other earlier mentions of this version of the drink and that it does bear a striking resemblance to the gin punches served at London clubs like the Garrick in the first half of the 19th century.

Clearly unaware of the drink&#x27;s actual origins, in August 1891, British physician Sir Morell Mackenzie wrote an article in the influential 19th century magazine &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot; claiming that England was the originating country for the Tom Collins cocktail and a person named John Collins was its creator. In the article, Mackenzie quoted an old song called &quot;John Collins.&quot; However, the British weekly magazine &quot;Punch&quot; immediately disparaged Mackenzie&#x27;s efforts, noting in August 1891 that the title of the song actually was &quot;Jim Collins&quot; and that Mackenzie otherwise inaccurately quoted and characterized the song.

Confusion over the cocktail&#x27;s origins continued as American writer Charles Montgomery Skinner noted in 1898 that the Tom Collins had made its way to the &quot;American bars&quot; in England, France, and Germany, where the American invention stimulated curiosity in Europe and served as a reflection of American art.

As time passed, interest in the Tom Collins diminished and its origins became lost. Early on during the 1920s Prohibition in the United States, the American journalist and student of American English H. L. Mencken said:The origin of the ... Tom-Collins ... remains to be established; the historians of alcoholism, like the philologists, have neglected them. But the essentially American character of [this and other drinks] is obvious, despite the fact that a number have gone over into English. The English, in naming their drinks, commonly display a far more limited imagination. Seeking a name, for example, for a mixture of whiskey and soda-water, the best they could achieve was whiskey-and-soda. The Americans, introduced to the same drink, at once gave it the far more original name of highball.

=== John Collins ===

A drink known as a John Collins has existed since the 1860s at the very least and is believed to have originated with a headwaiter of that name who worked at Limmer&#x27;s Old House in Conduit Street in Mayfair, which was a popular London hotel and coffee house around 1790–1817.

The following rhyme was written by Frank and Charles Sheridan about John Collins:
&lt;poem&gt;My name is John Collins, head waiter at Limmer&#x27;s,
Corner of Conduit Street, Hanover Square,
My chief occupation is filling brimmers
For all the young gentlemen frequenters there.&lt;/poem&gt;

Drinks historian David Wondrich has speculated that the original recipe that was introduced to New York in the 1850s would have been very similar to the gin punches that are known to have been served at fashionable London clubs such as the Garrick during the first half of the 19th century. He states that these would have been along the lines of &quot;gin, lemon juice, chilled soda water, and maraschino liqueur&quot;.

The specific call for Old Tom gin in the 1869 recipe is a likely cause for the subsequent name change to &quot;Tom Collins&quot; in Jerry Thomas&#x27;s 1887 recipe. Earlier versions of the gin punch are likely to have used Dutch gin instead.

Some confusion regarding the origin of the drink and the cause for its change of name has arisen in the past due to the following:

===The Tom Collins Hoax of 1874===

In 1874, people in New York; Pennsylvania; and elsewhere in the United States would start a conversation with, &quot;Have you seen Tom Collins?&quot; After the listener predictably reacts by explaining that they did not know a Tom Collins, the speaker would assert that Tom Collins was talking about the listener to others and that Tom Collins was &quot;just around the corner&quot;, &quot;in a [local] bar&quot;, or somewhere else near. The conversation about the nonexistent Tom Collins was a proven hoax of exposure. In The Great Tom Collins hoax of 1874, as it became known, the speaker would encourage the listener to act foolishly by reacting to patent nonsense that the hoaxer deliberately presents as reality. In particular, the speaker intended the listener to become agitated at the idea of someone talking about them to others such that the listener would rush off to find the purportedly nearby Tom Collins. Similar to the New York Zoo hoax of 1874, several newspapers propagated the very successful practical joke by printing stories containing false sightings of Tom Collins. The 1874 hoax quickly gained such notoriety that several 1874 music hall songs memorialized the event (copies of which now are in the U.S. Library of Congress).

===Early recipes===
The first published Tom Collins recipe appears to have been in Harry Johnson&#x27;s 1882 book, &quot;New and Improved Bartender’s Manual or How to Mix Drinks of the Present Style&quot;. This book contains a recipe for two Collins drinks, the John Collins and the Tom Collins. The John Collins calls for Holland Gin, which is most likely what is also known as Genièvre, but the recipe for the Tom Collins in this book is as follows:

Tom Collins
(Use an extra large bar glass.)
Three-quarters table-spoon of sugar;
3 or 4 dashes of lime or lemon juice;
3 or 4 pieces of broken ice;
1 wine glass full of Old Tom gin;
1 bottle of plain soda water;
mix up well with a spoon, remove the ice, and serve.
Attention must be paid not to let the foam of the soda water spread over the glass.
In the 1884 book, &quot;The Modern Bartender’s Guide&quot; by O. H. Byron there is a drink called a &quot;John Collins&#x27; Gin&quot; where he calls simply for gin with no specifications of which gin, lemon juice, sugar, and filled with soda. That book also has a &quot;Tom Collins&#x27; Brandy&quot;, which consists of brandy, lemon juice, gum syrup and Maraschino liqueur, and filled with soda water built in the glass over ice. This book also lists a recipe for a &quot;Tom Collins gin and whiskey&quot;, with the only instructions that it is &quot;concocted in the same manner as a brandy receipt, substituting their respective liquors&quot;.
Another 1884 book, &quot;Scientific Barkeeping&quot; by E.N. Cook &amp; Co, also includes both a John Collins and a Tom Collins, the former calling for Holland gin and the latter for whiskey. There is a recipe for the Tom Collins in the 1887 posthumous edition of Jerry Thomas&#x27; &quot;Bar-Tender&#x27;s Guide.&quot; Since New York based Thomas would have known about the widespread hoax and the contents of his 1876 book were developed during or right after The Great Tom Collins hoax of 1874, it was believed by George Sinclair that the hoax event was the most plausible source of the name for the Tom Collins cocktail. Classified under the heading &quot;Collins&quot; with similarly named whisky and brandy drinks, Jerry Thomas&#x27; Tom Collins gin instructed:

Tom Collins (1887)
(Use large bar-glass.)
Take 5 or 6 dashes of gum syrup.
Juice of a small lemon.
1 large wine-glass of gin.
2 or 3 lumps of ice;
Shake up well and strain into a large bar-glass. Fill up the glass with plain soda water and drink while it is .

This was distinguished from the Gin Fizz cocktail in that the three dashes of lemon juice in the gin fizz was &quot;fizzed&quot; with carbonated water to essentially form a &quot;gin and sodawater&quot; whereas the considerably more &quot;juice of a small lemon&quot; in the Tom Collins essentially formed a &quot;gin and sparkling lemonade&quot; when sweetened with the gum syrup. The type of gin used by Thomas was not specified in his 1887 book, but was most likely Old Tom if that was responsible for the change in the drink&#x27;s name.

===Popularity===
By 1878, the Tom Collins was being served in the barrooms of New York City and elsewhere. Identified as among &#x27;the favorite drinks which are in demand everywhere&#x27; in an advertisement for the 1878 edition of &quot;The Modern Bartender&#x27;s Guide&quot; by O. H. Byron, both Tom Collins gin and whiskey and Tom Collins brandy were considered fancy drinks. In the 1891 book, &quot;The Flowing Bowl: When and what to Drink,&quot; author William Schmidt listed the Tom Collins as including:

&lt;poem&gt;Tom Collins Gin (1891)
The juice of half a lemon in a large glass,
a bar-spoonful of sugar,
a drink of Tom gin; mix this well;
2 lumps of ice,
a bottle of plain soda.
Mix well and serve.&lt;/poem&gt;

One turn-of-the-20th-century recipe subsequently replaced the lemon juice with lime juice.

===Others===
An alternate history places the origin in St. Louis.

==Modern mix==
The 1986 &quot;The Book of Cocktails&quot; provides a modern take on Thomas&#x27; 1876 recipe for this long drink:John (or Tom) Collins (1986)&lt;br&gt;ice cubes&lt;br&gt;2 oz. [6 cL] dry gin&lt;br&gt;2 oz. [6 cL] lemon juice&lt;br&gt;1 teaspoon sugar (gomme) syrup&lt;br&gt;soda water&lt;br&gt;slice of lemon&lt;br&gt;1 colored cherry&lt;br&gt;Place ample ice in large glass. Add gin, lemon juice and syrup. Top up with soda water and stir well. Serve with lemon slice, cherry and a straw.

==Variants==

A simple Summer Collins is a two-ingredient cocktail consisting only of equal parts gin and lemonade, served over ice with an optional fruit garnish. The Vodka Collins uses vodka in place of gin. The South Side uses lime juice in addition to or in place of lemon and adds mint. A Rum Collins, also called a Ron Collins, uses light rum in place of gin and lime juice in place of lemon juice. A French 75 uses Champagne in lieu of soda water. The Juan Collins is made from tequila, lime juice, sugar or some other sweetening agent, and club soda. This drink typically is served in a Collins glass over ice.

<text>A modern torpedo is an underwater ranged weapon launched above or below the water surface, self-propelled towards a target, and with an explosive warhead designed to detonate either on contact with or in proximity to the target. Historically, such a device was called an automotive, automobile, locomotive, or fish torpedo; colloquially a &quot;fish&quot;. The term &quot;torpedo&quot; originally applied to a variety of devices, most of which would today be called mines. From about 1900, &quot;torpedo&quot; has been used strictly to designate a self-propelled underwater explosive device.

While the 19th-century battleship had evolved primarily with a view to engagements between armored warships with large-caliber guns, the invention and refinement of torpedoes from the 1860s onwards allowed small torpedo boats and other lighter surface vessels, submarines/submersibles, even improvised fishing boats or frogmen, and later light aircraft, to destroy large ships without the need of large guns, though sometimes at the risk of being hit by longer-range artillery fire.

Modern torpedoes are classified variously as lightweight or heavyweight; straight-running, autonomous homers, and wire-guided types. They can be launched from a variety of platforms. In modern warfare, a submarine-launched torpedo is almost certain to hit its target; the best defense is a counterattack using another torpedo.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;torpedo&quot; was first used as a name for electric rays (in the order &quot;Torpediniformes&quot;), which in turn comes from the Latin word &quot;&quot; (&quot;lethargy&quot; or &quot;sluggishness&quot;). In naval usage, the American inventor David Bushnell was reported to have first used the term as the name of a submarine of his own design, the &quot;American Turtle or Torpedo.&quot; This usage likely inspired Robert Fulton&#x27;s use of the term to describe his stationary mines, and later Robert Whitehead&#x27;s naming of the first self-propelled torpedo.

==History==
=== Middle Ages ===
Torpedo-like weapons were first proposed many centuries before they were successfully developed. For example, in 1275, engineer Hasan al-Rammah – who worked as a military scientist for the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt – wrote that it might be possible to create a projectile resembling &quot;an egg&quot;, which propelled itself through water, whilst carrying &quot;fire&quot;.

===Early naval mines===


In modern language, a &quot;torpedo&quot; is an underwater self-propelled explosive, but historically, the term also applied to primitive naval mines and spar torpedoes. These were used on an ad hoc basis during the early modern period up to the late 19th century. 

In the early 17th century, the Dutchman Cornelius Drebbel, in the employ of King James I of England, invented the spar torpedo; he attached explosives to the end of a beam affixed to one of his submarines. These were used (to little effect) during the English expeditions to La Rochelle in 1626. The first use of a torpedo by a submarine was in 1775, by the American , which attempted to lay a bomb with a timed fuse on the hull of during the American Revolutionary War, but failed in the attempt.

In the early 1800s, the American inventor Robert Fulton, while in France, &quot;conceived the idea of destroying ships by introducing floating mines under their bottoms in submarine boats&quot;. He employed the term &quot;torpedo&quot; for the explosive charges with which he outfitted his submarine &quot;Nautilus&quot;. However, both the French and the Dutch governments were uninterested in the submarine. Fulton then concentrated on developing the torpedo-like weapon independent of a submarine deployment, and in 1804 succeeded in convincing the British government to employ his &#x27;catamaran&#x27; against the French. An April 1804 torpedo attack on French ships anchored at Boulogne, and a follow-up attack in October, produced several explosions but no significant damage and the weapon was abandoned.

Fulton carried out a demonstration for the US government on 20 July 1807, destroying a vessel in New York&#x27;s harbor. Further development languished as Fulton focused on his &quot;steam-boat matters&quot;. After the War of 1812 broke out, the Royal Navy established a blockade of the East Coast of the United States. During the war, American forces unsuccessfully attempted to destroy the British ship of the line HMS &quot;Ramillies&quot; while it was lying at anchor in New London, Connecticut&#x27;s harbor with torpedoes launched from small boats. This prompted the captain of &quot;Ramillies&quot;, Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet, to warn the Americans to cease using this &quot;cruel and unheard-of warfare&quot; or he would &quot;order every house near the shore to be destroyed&quot;. The fact that Hardy had been previously so lenient and considerate to the Americans led them to abandon such attempts with immediate effect.

Torpedoes were used by the Russian Empire during the Crimean War in 1855 against British warships in the Gulf of Finland. They used an early form of chemical detonator. During the American Civil War, the term torpedo was used for what is today called a contact mine, floating on or below the water surface using an air-filled demijohn or similar flotation device. These devices were very primitive and apt to prematurely explode. They would be detonated on contact with the ship or after a set time, although electrical detonators were also occasionally used. was the first warship to be sunk in 1862 by an electrically-detonated mine. Spar torpedoes were also used; an explosive device was mounted at the end of a spar up to long projecting forward underwater from the bow of the attacking vessel, which would then ram the opponent with the explosives. These were used by the Confederate submarine to sink although the weapon was apt to cause as much harm to its user as to its target. Rear Admiral David Farragut&#x27;s famous/apocryphal command during the Battle of Mobile Bay in 1864, &quot;Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!&quot; refers to a minefield laid at Mobile, Alabama.

On 26 May 1877, during the Romanian War of Independence, the Romanian spar torpedo boat attacked and sank the Ottoman river monitor &quot;Seyfi&quot;. This was the first instance in history when a torpedo boat sank its targets without also sinking.

===Invention of the modern torpedo===
A prototype of the self-propelled torpedo was created on a commission placed by Giovanni Luppis, an Austro-Hungarian naval officer from Rijeka (modern-day Croatia), at the time a port city of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and Robert Whitehead, an English engineer who was the manager of a town factory, &quot;Stabilimento Tecnico di Fiume&quot; (STF). In 1864, Luppis presented Whitehead with the plans of the &quot;Salvacoste&quot; (&quot;Coastsaver&quot;), a floating weapon driven by ropes from the land that had been dismissed by the naval authorities due to the impractical steering and propulsion mechanisms.

In 1866, Whitehead invented the first effective self-propelled torpedo, the eponymous Whitehead torpedo, the first modern torpedo. French and German inventions followed closely, and the term &quot;torpedo&quot; came to describe self-propelled projectiles that traveled under or on water. By 1900, the term no longer included mines and booby-traps as the navies of the world added submarines, torpedo boats and torpedo boat destroyers to their fleets.

Whitehead was unable to improve the machine substantially, since the clockwork motor, attached ropes, and surface attack mode all contributed to a slow and cumbersome weapon. However, he kept considering the problem after the contract had finished, and eventually developed a tubular device, designed to run underwater on its own, and powered by compressed air. The result was a submarine weapon, the &quot;Minenschiff&quot; (mine ship), the first modern self-propelled torpedo, officially presented to the Austrian Imperial Naval commission on 21 December 1866.

The first trials were not successful as the weapon was unable to maintain a course at a steady depth. After much work, Whitehead introduced his &quot;secret&quot; in 1868 which overcame this. It was a mechanism consisting of a hydrostatic valve and pendulum that caused the torpedo&#x27;s hydroplanes to be adjusted to maintain a preset depth.

===Production and spread===
The Austrian government decided to invest in the invention, and the factory in Rijeka started producing more Whitehead torpedoes. In 1870, he improved the devices to travel up to approximately at a speed of up to . Royal Navy (RN) representatives visited Rijeka for a demonstration in late 1869, and in 1870 a batch of torpedoes was ordered. In 1871, the British Admiralty paid Whitehead £15,000 for certain of his developments and production started at the Royal Laboratories in Woolwich the following year.

The company in Fiume went bankrupt in 1873, but was reformed as Whitehead Torpedo Works a few years later, and by 1881 it was exporting torpedoes to ten other countries. The torpedo was powered by compressed air and had an explosive charge of gun-cotton. Whitehead went on to develop more efficient devices, demonstrating torpedoes capable of in 1876, in 1886, and, finally, in 1890.

In the 1880s, a British committee, informed by hydrodynamicist Dr. R. E. Froude, conducted comparative tests and determined that a blunt nose, contrary to prior assumptions, did not hinder speed: in fact, the blunt nose provided a speed advantage of approximately one knot compared to the traditional pointed nose design. This discovery allowed for larger explosive payloads and increased air storage for propulsion without compromising speed.
Whitehead opened a new factory adjacent to Portland Harbour, England, in 1890, which continued making torpedoes until the end of World War II. Because orders from the RN were not as large as expected, torpedoes were mostly exported. A series of devices was produced at Rijeka, with diameters from upward. The largest Whitehead torpedo was in diameter and long, made of polished steel or phosphor bronze, with a gun-cotton warhead. It was propelled by a three-cylinder Brotherhood radial engine, using compressed air at around and driving two contra-rotating propellers, and was designed to self-regulate its course and depth as far as possible. By 1881, nearly 1,500 torpedoes had been produced. Whitehead also opened a factory at St Tropez in 1890 that exported torpedoes to Brazil, The Netherlands, Turkey, and Greece.

Whitehead purchased rights to the gyroscope of Ludwig Obry in 1888 but it was not sufficiently accurate, so in 1890 he purchased a better design to improve control of his designs, which came to be called the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Device&quot;. The firm of L. Schwartzkopff in Germany also produced torpedoes and exported them to Russia, Japan, and Spain. In 1885, Britain ordered a batch of 50 as torpedo production at home and Rijeka could not meet demand.

In 1893, Royal Navy torpedo production was transferred to the Royal Gun Factory. The British later established a Torpedo Experimental Establishment at and a production facility at the Royal Naval Torpedo Factory, Greenock, in 1910. These are now closed.

By World War I, Whitehead&#x27;s torpedo remained a worldwide success, and his company was able to maintain a monopoly on torpedo production. By that point, his torpedo had grown to a diameter of 18 inches with a maximum speed of with a warhead weighing .

Whitehead faced competition from the American Lieutenant Commander John A. Howell, whose design, driven by a flywheel, was simpler and cheaper. It was produced from 1885 to 1895, and it ran straight, leaving no wake. A Torpedo Test Station was set up in Rhode Island in 1870. The Howell torpedo was the only United States Navy model until an American company, Bliss and Williams secured manufacturing rights to produce Whitehead torpedoes. These were put into service for the U.S. Navy in 1892. Five varieties were produced, all 18-inch diameter.

The Royal Navy introduced the Brotherhood wet heater engine in 1907 with the 18 in. Mk. VII &amp; VII* which greatly increased the speed and/or range over compressed air engines and wet heater type engines became the standard in many major navies up to and during the Second World War. 

===Torpedo boats and guidance systems===
Ships of the line were superseded by ironclads, large steam-powered ships with heavy gun armament and heavy armor, in the mid 19th century. Ultimately this line of development led to the dreadnought category of all-big-gun battleships, starting with .

Although these ships were incredibly powerful, the new weight of armor slowed them down, and the huge guns needed to penetrate that armor fired at very slow rates. The development of torpedoes allowed for the possibility that small and fast vessels could credibly threaten if not sink even the most powerful battleships. While such attacks would carry enormous risks to the attacking boats and their crews (which would likely need to expose themselves to artillery fire which their small vessels were not designed to withstand) this was offset by the ability to construct large numbers of small vessels far more quickly and for a much lower unit cost compared to a capital ship.

The first boat designed to fire the self-propelled Whitehead torpedo was , completed in 1877. The French Navy followed suit in 1878 with , launched in 1878 though she had been ordered in 1875. The first torpedo boats were built at the shipyards of Sir John Thornycroft and gained recognition for their effectiveness.

At the same time, inventors were working on building a guided torpedo. Prototypes were built by John Ericsson, John Louis Lay, and Victor von Scheliha, but the first practical guided missile was patented by Louis Brennan, an emigre to Australia, in 1877.
It was designed to run at a consistent depth of , and was fitted with an indicator mast that just broke the surface of the water. At night the mast had a small light, only visible from the rear. Two steel drums were mounted one behind the other inside the torpedo, each carrying several thousand yards of high-tensile steel wire. The drums connected via a differential gear to twin contra-rotating propellers. If one drum was rotated faster than the other, then the rudder was activated. The other ends of the wires were connected to steam-powered winding engines, which were arranged so that speeds could be varied within fine limits, giving sensitive steering control for the torpedo.

The torpedo attained a speed of using a wire in diameter but later this was changed to to increase the speed to . The torpedo was fitted with elevators controlled by a depth-keeping mechanism, and the fore and aft rudders operated by the differential between the drums.

Brennan traveled to Britain, where the Admiralty examined the torpedo and found it unsuitable for shipboard use. However, the War Office proved more amenable, and in early August 1881, a special Royal Engineer committee was instructed to inspect the torpedo at Chatham and report back directly to the Secretary of State for War, Hugh Childers. The report strongly recommended that an improved model be built at government expense. In 1883 an agreement was reached between the Brennan Torpedo Company and the government. The newly appointed Inspector-General of Fortifications in England, Sir Andrew Clarke, appreciated the value of the torpedo and in spring 1883 an experimental station was established at Garrison Point Fort, Sheerness, on the River Medway, and a workshop for Brennan was set up at the Chatham Barracks, the home of the Royal Engineers. Between 1883 and 1885 the Royal Engineers held trials and in 1886 the torpedo was recommended for adoption as a harbor defense torpedo. It was used throughout the British Empire for more than fifteen years.

===Use in conflict===

The Royal Navy frigate was the first naval vessel to fire a self-propelled torpedo in anger during the Battle of Pacocha against rebel Peruvian ironclad on 29 May 1877. The Peruvian ship successfully outran the device. On 16 January 1878, the Turkish steamer &quot;Intibah&quot; became the first vessel to be sunk by self-propelled torpedoes, launched from torpedo boats operating from the tender under the command of Stepan Osipovich Makarov during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78. 

In another early use of the torpedo, during the War of the Pacific, the Peruvian ironclad Huáscar commanded by captain Miguel Grau attacked the Chilean corvette Abtao on 28 August 1879 at Antofagasta with a self-propelled Lay torpedo only to have it reverse course. The ship &quot;Huascar&quot; was saved when an officer jumped overboard to divert it.

The Chilean ironclad was sunk on 23 April 1891 by a self-propelled torpedo from the &quot;Almirante Lynch&quot;, during the Chilean Civil War of 1891, becoming the first ironclad warship sunk by this weapon. The Chinese turret ship was purportedly hit and disabled by a torpedo after numerous attacks by Japanese torpedo boats during the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894. At this time torpedo attacks were still very close range and very dangerous to the attackers.
Several western sources reported that the Qing dynasty Imperial Chinese military, under the direction of Li Hongzhang, acquired &quot;electric torpedoes,&quot; which they deployed in numerous waterways, along with fortresses and numerous other modern military weapons acquired by China. At the Tientsin Arsenal in 1876, the Chinese developed the capacity to manufacture these &quot;electric torpedoes&quot; on their own. Although a form of Chinese art, the Nianhua, depict such torpedoes being used against Russian ships during the Boxer Rebellion, whether they were actually used in battle against them is undocumented and unknown.

The Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) was the first great war of the 20th century. During the war the Imperial Russian and Imperial Japanese navies launched nearly 300 torpedoes at each other, all of them of the &quot;self-propelled automotive&quot; type. The deployment of these new underwater weapons resulted in one battleship, two armored cruisers, and two destroyers being sunk in action, with the remainder of the roughly 80 warships being sunk by the more conventional methods of gunfire, mines, and scuttling.

On 27 May 1905, during the Battle of Tsushima, Admiral Rozhestvensky&#x27;s flagship, the battleship , had been gunned to a wreck by Admiral Tōgō&#x27;s 12-inch gunned battleline. With the Russians sunk and scattering, Tōgō prepared for pursuit, and while doing so ordered his torpedo boat destroyers (TBDs) (mostly referred to as just &quot;destroyers&quot; in most written accounts) to finish off the Russian battleship. &quot;Knyaz Suvorov&quot; was set upon by 17 torpedo-firing warships, ten of which were destroyers and four torpedo boats. Twenty-one torpedoes were launched at the pre-dreadnought, and three struck home, one fired from the destroyer and two from torpedo boats &quot;No. 72&quot; and &quot;No. 75&quot;. The flagship slipped under the waves shortly thereafter, taking over 900 men with her to the bottom. On December 9, 1912, the Greek submarine &quot;Dolphin&quot; launched a torpedo against the Ottoman cruiser &quot;Medjidieh&quot;.

===Aerial torpedo===
The end of the Russo-Japanese War fuelled new theories, and the idea of dropping lightweight torpedoes from aircraft was conceived in the early 1910s by Bradley A. Fiske, an officer in the United States Navy. Awarded a patent in 1912, Fiske worked out the mechanics of carrying and releasing the aerial torpedo from a bomber, and defined tactics that included a night-time approach so that the target ship would be less able to defend itself. Fiske determined that the notional torpedo bomber should descend rapidly in a sharp spiral to evade enemy guns, then when about above the water the aircraft would straighten its flight long enough to line up with the torpedo&#x27;s intended path. The aircraft would release the torpedo at a distance of from the target. Fiske reported in 1915 that, using this method, enemy fleets could be attacked within their harbors if there was enough room for the torpedo track.

Meanwhile, the Royal Naval Air Service began actively experimenting with this possibility. The first successful aerial torpedo drop was performed by Gordon Bell in 1914 – dropping a Whitehead torpedo from a Short S.64 seaplane. The success of these experiments led to the construction of the first purpose-built operational torpedo aircraft, the Short Type 184, built-in 1915.
An order for ten aircraft was placed, and 936 aircraft were built by ten different British aircraft companies during the First World War. The two prototype aircraft were embarked upon , which sailed for the Aegean on 21 March 1915 to take part in the Gallipoli campaign.
On 12 August 1915 one of these, piloted by Flight Commander Charles Edmonds, was the first aircraft in the world to attack an enemy ship with an air-launched torpedo.

On 17 August 1915 Flight Commander Edmonds torpedoed and sank an Ottoman transport ship a few miles north of the Dardanelles. His formation colleague, Flight Lieutenant G B Dacre, was forced to land on the water owing to engine trouble but, seeing an enemy tug close by, taxied up to it and released his torpedo, sinking the tug. Without the weight of the torpedo Dacre was able to take off and return to &quot;Ben-My-Chree&quot;.

===World War I===

Torpedoes were widely used in World War I, both against shipping and against submarines. Germany disrupted the supply lines to Britain largely by use of submarine torpedoes, though submarines also extensively used guns. Britain and its allies also used torpedoes throughout the war. U-boats themselves were often targeted, twenty being sunk by torpedo. Two Royal Italian Navy torpedo boats scored a success against an Austrian-Hungarian squadron, sinking the battleship with two torpedoes.

The Royal Navy had been experimenting with ways to further increase the range of torpedoes during World War 1 using pure oxygen instead of compressed air, this work ultimately leading to the development of the oxygen-enriched air 24.5 in. Mk. I intended originally for the s and battleships of 1921, both being cancelled due to the Washington Naval Treaty. 

Initially, the Imperial Japanese Navy purchased Whitehead or Schwartzkopf torpedoes but by 1917, like the Royal Navy, they were conducting experiments with pure oxygen instead of compressed air. Because of explosions they abandoned the experiments but resumed them in 1926 and by 1933 had a working torpedo. They also used conventional wet heater torpedoes.

=== World War II ===
In the inter-war years, financial stringency caused nearly all navies to skimp on testing their torpedoes. Only the British and Japanese had fully tested new technologies for torpedoes (in particular the Type 93, nicknamed &quot;Long Lance&quot; postwar by the US official historian Samuel E. Morison) at the start of World War II. Unreliable torpedoes caused many problems for the American submarine force in the early years of the war, primarily in the Pacific Theater. One possible exception to the pre-war neglect of torpedo development was the 45-cm caliber, 1931-premiered Japanese Type 91 torpedo, the sole aerial torpedo (&quot;Koku Gyorai&quot;) developed and brought into service by the Japanese Empire before the war. The Type 91 had an advanced PID controller and jettisonable, wooden &quot; Kyoban&quot; aerial stabilizing surfaces which released upon entering the water, making it a formidable anti-ship weapon; Nazi Germany considered manufacturing it as the &quot;Luftorpedo LT 850&quot; after August 1942.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s 24.5-inch oxygen-enriched air torpedo saw service in the two battleships although by World War II the use of enriched oxygen had been discontinued due to safety concerns. In the final phase of the action against , fired a pair of 24.5-inch torpedoes from her port-side tube and claimed one hit. According to Ludovic Kennedy, &quot;if true, [this is] the only instance in history of one battleship torpedoing another&quot;. The Royal Navy continued the development of oxygen-enriched air torpedoes with the 21 in. Mk. VII of the 1920s designed for the s although once again these were converted to run on normal air at the start of World War II. Around this time too the Royal Navy were perfecting the Brotherhood burner cycle engine which offered a performance as good as the oxygen-enriched air engine but without the issues arising from the oxygen equipment and which was first used in the extremely successful and long-lived 21 in. Mk. VIII torpedo of 1925. This torpedo served throughout WW II (with 3,732 being fired by September 1944) and is still in limited service in the 21st century. The improved Mark VIII** was used in two particularly notable incidents; on 6 February 1945 the only intentional wartime sinking of one submarine by another while both were submerged took place when HMS &quot;Venturer&quot; sank the German submarine &quot;U-864&quot; with four Mark VIII** torpedoes and on 2 May 1982 when the Royal Navy submarine sank the Argentine cruiser with two Mark VIII** torpedoes during the Falklands War. This is the only sinking of a surface ship by a nuclear-powered submarine in wartime and the second (of three) sinkings of a surface ship by any submarine since the end of World War II). The other two sinkings were of the Indian frigate and the South Korean corvette ROKS &quot;Cheonan&quot;.


Many classes of surface ships, submarines, and aircraft were armed with torpedoes. Naval strategy at the time was to use torpedoes, launched from submarines or warships, against enemy warships in a fleet action on the high seas. There were concerns torpedoes would be ineffective against warships&#x27; heavy armor; an answer to this was to detonate torpedoes underneath a ship, badly damaging its keel and the other structural members in the hull, commonly called &quot;breaking its back&quot;. This was demonstrated by magnetic influence mines in World War I. The torpedo would be set to run at a depth just beneath the ship, relying on a magnetic exploder to activate at the appropriate time.

Germany, Britain, and the U.S. independently devised ways to do this; German and American torpedoes, however, suffered problems with their depth-keeping mechanisms, coupled with faults in magnetic pistols shared by all designs. Inadequate testing had failed to reveal the effect of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field on ships and exploder mechanisms, which resulted in premature detonation. The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and Royal Navy promptly identified and eliminated the problems. In the United States Navy (USN), there was an extended wrangle over the problems plaguing the Mark 14 torpedo (and its Mark 6 exploder). Cursory trials had allowed bad designs to enter service. Both the Navy Bureau of Ordnance and the United States Congress were too busy protecting their interests to correct the errors, and fully functioning torpedoes only became available to the USN twenty-one months into the Pacific War.

British submarines used torpedoes to interdict the Axis supply shipping to North Africa, while Fleet Air Arm Swordfish sank three Italian battleships at Taranto by a torpedo and (after a mistaken, but abortive, attack on ) scored one crucial hit in the hunt for the German battleship . Large tonnages of merchant shipping were sunk by submarines with torpedoes in both the Battle of the Atlantic and the Pacific War.

Torpedo boats, such as MTBs, PT boats, or S-boats, enabled the relatively small but fast craft to carry enough firepower, in theory, to destroy a larger ship, though this rarely occurred in practice. The largest warship sunk by torpedoes from small craft in World War II was the British cruiser , sunk by Italian MAS boats on the night of 12/13 August 1942 during Operation Pedestal. Destroyers of all navies were also armed with torpedoes to attack larger ships. In the Battle off Samar, destroyer torpedoes from the escorts of the American task force &quot;Taffy 3&quot; showed effectiveness at defeating armor. Damage and confusion caused by torpedo attacks were instrumental in beating back a superior Japanese force of battleships and cruisers. In the Battle of the North Cape in December 1943, torpedo hits from British destroyers and slowed the German battleship enough for the British battleship to catch and sink her, and in May 1945 the British 26th Destroyer Flotilla (coincidentally led by &quot;Saumarez&quot; again) ambushed and sank Japanese heavy cruiser .

As a result of the &quot;Channel Dash&quot; of 1942, when three German warships successfully evaded Royal Navy and Royal Air Force attacks and passed the length of the English Channel from the Atlantic to the North Sea, Britain&#x27;s Ministry of Aircraft Production commissioned the Helmover torpedo, a five-ton air-launched weapon, but it did not enter service until 1945 and saw no action.

=== Frequency-hopping ===

During World War II, Hedy Lamarr and composer George Antheil developed a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes, it intended to use frequency-hopping  technology to defeat the threat of jamming by the Axis powers. As radio guidance had been abandoned some years earlier, it was not pursued. Although the US Navy never adopted the technology, it did, in the 1960s, investigate various spread-spectrum techniques. Spread-spectrum techniques are incorporated into Bluetooth technology and are similar to methods used in legacy versions of Wi-Fi. This work led to their induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.

=== Post–World War II ===
Because of improved submarine strength and speed, torpedoes had to be given improved warheads and better motors. During the Cold War torpedoes were an important asset with the advent of nuclear-powered submarines, which did not have to surface often, particularly those carrying strategic nuclear missiles.

Several navies have launched torpedo strikes since World War II, including:
* During the Korean War the United States Navy successfully attacked a dam with air-launched torpedoes.
* Israeli Navy fast attack craft crippled the American electronic intelligence vessel USS &quot;Liberty&quot; with gunfire and torpedoes during the 1967 Six-Day War, resulting in the loss of 34 crew.
* A Pakistan Navy sank the Indian frigate on 9 December 1971 during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, with the loss of over 18 officers and 176 sailors.
* The British Royal Navy nuclear attack submarine sank the Argentine Navy light cruiser on 2 May 1982 with two Mark 8 torpedoes during the Falklands War with the loss of 323 lives.
* On 16 June 1982, during the Lebanon War, an unnamed Israeli submarine torpedoed and sank the Lebanese coaster &quot;Transit&quot;, which was carrying 56 Palestinian refugees to Cyprus, in the belief that the vessel was evacuating anti-Israeli militias. The ship was hit by two torpedoes, managed to run aground but eventually sank. There were 25 dead, including her captain. The Israeli Navy disclosed the incident in November 2018.
* The Croatian Navy disabled the Yugoslav patrol boat PČ-176 &quot;Mukos&quot; with a torpedo launched by Croatian naval commandos from an improvised device during the Battle of the Dalmatian channels on 14 November 1991, in the course of the Croatian War of Independence. Three members of the crew were killed. The stranded boat was later recovered by Croatian trawlers, salvaged and put in service with the Croatian Navy as OB-02 &quot;Šolta&quot;.
* On 26 March 2010 the South Korean Navy ship ROKS &quot;Cheonan&quot; was sunk with the loss of 46 personnel. A subsequent investigation concluded that the warship had been sunk by a North Korean torpedo fired by a midget submarine.

== Propulsion ==
===Compressed air===
The Whitehead torpedo of 1866, the first successful self-propelled torpedo, used compressed air as its energy source. The air was stored at pressures of up to and fed to a piston engine that turned a single propeller at about 100 rpm. It could travel about at an average speed of . The speed and range of later models were improved by increasing the pressure of the stored air. In 1906 Whitehead built torpedoes that could cover nearly at an average speed of .

At higher pressures the adiabatic cooling experienced by the air as it expanded in the engine caused icing problems. This drawback was remedied by heating the air with seawater before it was fed to the engine, which increased engine performance further because the air expanded even more after heating. This was the principle used by the Brotherhood engine.

===Heated torpedoes===
Torpedoes propelled by compressed air encountered a significant problem when attempts were made to increase their range and speed. The cold compressed air, upon entering the expansion phase in the piston chambers of the torpedo&#x27;s engine, caused a rapid drop in temperature. This could freeze the engine solid, by jamming the piston heads inside the cylinders. This led to the idea of injecting a liquid fuel, like kerosene, into the compressed air and igniting it inside a separate expansion chamber. In this manner, the air is heated more and expands even further, and the burned propellant adds more gas to drive the engine. The earliest form was the &quot;Elswick” heater as patented by Armstrong Whitworth in 1904. The device was demonstrated in an 18-inch Fiume Mark III torpedo at Bincleaves in 1905 before an audience of British and Japanese experts. The weapon speed was more than for the identical unheated version. Construction of such &quot;heated&quot; torpedoes started the same year by Whitehead&#x27;s company.

==== Dry heater ====

The earliest production version of the heated torpedo propulsion system, which became known as the Whitehead heater system, mixed the fuel and compressed air after the pressure regulator. Combustion took place in a specialized expansion chamber, with hot combustion products driving the pistons of a reciprocating engine. This had the disadvantage of badly sooting the air vessel with combustion byproducts, and could also engage in a thermal runaway, jamming the engine - not from low temperature as observed with compressed air, but from excess heat causing the piston heads to jam. The &quot;dry heater&quot; distinction was only made after wet heater torpedoes were developed, prior to which all heated torpedoes were of the dry heater type - originally simply called &quot;heated&quot;.

==== Wet heater ====
A further improvement was the use of water to wash and cool the combustion chamber of the fuel-burning torpedo. Water would be injected into the combustion chamber, at a rate commensurate with the fuel supply rate. This water would flash to steam, with stray condensate carrying the soot combustion byproducts out through the engine. An early example was the wet heater system developed by Lieutenant Sydney Hardcastle at the Royal Gun Factory, in 1908. The compressed air bottle was partially filled with water, with an outlet at the bottom leading into the combustion chamber. This would guarantee that compressed air and water would be injected into the combustion chamber at the same pressure. The system not only solved heating problems so more fuel could be burned but also allowed additional power to be generated by feeding the resulting steam into the engine together with the combustion products. Torpedoes with such a propulsion system became known as &quot;wet heaters&quot;, while heated torpedoes without steam generation were retrospectively called &quot;dry heaters&quot;. Most torpedoes used in World War I and World War II were wet heaters.

==== Increased oxidant ====
The amount of fuel that can be burned by a torpedo engine (i.e. wet engine) is limited by the amount of oxygen it can carry. Since compressed air contains only about 21% oxygen, engineers in Japan developed the Type 93 (nicknamed &quot;Long Lance&quot; postwar) for destroyers and cruisers in the 1930s. It used pure compressed oxygen instead of compressed air and had performance unmatched by any contemporary torpedo in service, through the end of World War II. However, oxygen systems posed a danger to ships carrying such torpedoes under normal operation, and more so under attack; Japan lost several cruisers partly due to catastrophic secondary explosions of Type 93s.

During World War II, Germany experimented with hydrogen peroxide for the same purpose.

The British approached the problem of providing additional oxygen for the torpedo engine by the use of oxygen-enriched air rather than pure oxygen: up to 57% instead of the 21% of normal atmospheric compressed air. This significantly increased the range of the torpedo, the 24.5 inch Mk 1 having a range of at or at with a warhead. There was a general nervousness about the oxygen enrichment equipment, known for reasons of secrecy as &#x27;No 1 Air Compressor Room&#x27; on board ships, and development shifted to the highly efficient Brotherhood Burner Cycle engine that used un-enriched air.

==== Burner cycle engine ====
After the First World War, Peter Brotherhood developed a four-cylinder burner cycle engine which was roughly twice as powerful as the older wet heater engine. It was first used in the British Mk VIII torpedoes, which were still in service in 1982. It used a modified diesel cycle, using a small amount of paraffin to heat the incoming air, which was then compressed and further heated by the piston, and then more fuel was injected. It produced about 322 hp when introduced, but by the end of WW2 was at 465 hp, and there was a proposal to fuel it with nitric acid, when it was projected to develop 750 hp.

===Wire driven===

The Brennan torpedo had two wires wound around internal drums joined to the propellers. Shore-based steam winches pulled the wires, which spun the internal drums and drove the propellers. An operator controlled the relative speeds of the winches, providing guidance. Such systems were used for coastal defense of the British homeland and colonies from 1887 to 1903 and were purchased by, and under the control of, the Army as opposed to the Navy. Speed was about for over 2,400 m.

===Flywheel===
The Howell torpedo used by the US Navy in the late 19th century featured a heavy flywheel that had to be spun up before launch. It was able to travel about at . The Howell had the advantage of not leaving a trail of bubbles behind it, unlike compressed air torpedoes. This gave the target vessel less chance to detect and evade the torpedo and avoided giving away the attacker&#x27;s position. Additionally, it ran at a constant depth, unlike Whitehead models.

===Electric batteries===
Electric propulsion systems avoided tell-tale bubbles. John Ericsson invented an electrically propelled torpedo in 1873; it was powered by a cable from an external power source, because batteries of the time had insufficient capacity. The Sims-Edison torpedo was similarly powered. The Nordfelt torpedo was also electrically powered and was steered by impulses down a trailing wire.

Germany introduced its first battery-powered torpedo shortly before World War II, the G7e. It was slower and had a shorter range than the conventional G7a, but was wakeless and much cheaper. Its lead-acid rechargeable battery was sensitive to shock, required frequent maintenance before use, and required preheating for best performance. The experimental G7es, an enhancement of the G7e, used primary cells.

The United States had an electric design, the Mark 18, largely copied from the German torpedo (although with improved batteries), as well as FIDO, an air-dropped acoustic homing torpedo for anti-submarine use.

Modern electric torpedoes such as the Mark 24 Tigerfish, the Black Shark or DM2 series commonly use silver oxide batteries that need no maintenance, so torpedoes can be stored for years without losing performance.

===Rockets===
Several experimental rocket-propelled torpedoes were tried soon after Whitehead&#x27;s invention but were not successful. Rocket propulsion has been implemented successfully by the Soviet Union, for example in the VA-111 Shkval—and has been recently revived in Russian and German torpedoes, as it is especially suitable for supercavitating devices.

===Modern energy sources===
Modern torpedoes use a variety of propellants, including electric batteries (as with the French F21 torpedo or Italian Black Shark), monopropellants (e.g., Otto fuel II as with the US Mark 48 torpedo), and bipropellants (e.g., hydrogen peroxide plus kerosene as with the Swedish Torped 62, sulfur hexafluoride plus lithium as with the US Mark 50 torpedo, or Otto fuel II plus hydroxyl ammonium perchlorate as with the British Spearfish torpedo).

=== Propeller ===
The first of Whitehead&#x27;s torpedoes had a single propeller and needed a large vane to stop it spinning about its longitudinal axis. Not long afterward the idea of contra-rotating propellers was introduced, to avoid the need for the vane. The three-bladed propeller came in 1893 and the four-bladed one in 1897. To minimize noise, today&#x27;s torpedoes often use pump-jets.

=== Supercavitation ===
Some torpedoes—like the Russian VA-111 Shkval, Iranian Hoot, and German Unterwasserlaufkörper/ Barracuda—use supercavitation to increase speed to over . Torpedoes that don&#x27;t use supercavitation, such as the American Mark 48 and British Spearfish, are limited to under , though manufacturers and the military don&#x27;t always release exact figures.

==Guidance==

Torpedoes may be aimed at the target and fired unguided, similarly to a traditional artillery shell, or they may be guided onto the target. They may be guided autonomously towards the target by some procedure, e.g., sound (homing), or by the operator, typically via commands sent over a signal-carrying cable (wire guidance).

===Unguided===
The Victorian era Brennan torpedo could be steered onto its target by varying the relative speeds of its propulsion cables. However, the Brennan required a substantial infrastructure and was not suitable for shipboard use. Therefore, for the first part of its history, the torpedo was guided only in the sense that its course could be regulated to achieve an intended impact depth (because of the sine wave running path of the Whitehead, this was a hit or miss proposition, even when everything worked correctly) and, through gyroscopes, a straight course. With such torpedoes the method of attack in small torpedo boats, torpedo bombers and small submarines was to steer a predictable collision course abeam to the target and release the torpedo at the last minute, then veer away, all the time subject to defensive fire.

In larger ships and submarines, fire control calculators gave a wider engagement envelope. Originally, plotting tables (in large ships), combined with specialized slide rules (known in U.S. service as the &quot;banjo&quot; and &quot;Is/Was&quot;), reconciled the speed, distance, and course of a target with the firing ship&#x27;s speed and course, together with the performance of its torpedoes, to provide a firing solution. By the Second World War, all sides had developed automatic electro-mechanical calculators, exemplified by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Torpedo Data Computer. Submarine commanders were still expected to be able to calculate a firing solution by hand as a backup against mechanical failure, and because many submarines existed at the start of the war were not equipped with a TDC; most could keep the &quot;picture&quot; in their heads and do much of the calculations (simple trigonometry) mentally, from extensive training.

Against high-value targets and multiple targets, submarines would launch a spread of torpedoes, to increase the probability of success. Similarly, squadrons of torpedo boats and torpedo bombers would attack together, creating a &quot;fan&quot; of torpedoes across the target&#x27;s course. Faced with such an attack, the prudent thing for a target to do was to turn to parallel the course of the incoming torpedo and steam away from the torpedoes and the firer, allowing the relatively short-range torpedoes to use up their fuel. An alternative was to &quot;comb the tracks&quot;, turning to parallel the incoming torpedo&#x27;s course, but turning towards the torpedoes. The intention of such a tactic was still to minimize the size of the target offered to the torpedoes, but at the same time be able to aggressively engage the firer. This was the tactic advocated by critics of Jellicoe&#x27;s actions at Jutland, his caution at turning away from the torpedoes being seen as the reason the Germans escaped.

The use of multiple torpedoes to engage single targets depletes torpedo supplies and greatly reduces a submarine&#x27;s combat endurance. Endurance can be improved by ensuring a target can be effectively engaged by a single torpedo, which gave rise to the guided torpedo.

===Pattern running===

In World War II the Germans introduced programmable pattern-running torpedoes, which would run a predetermined pattern until they either ran out of fuel or hit something. The earlier version, FaT, ran out after launch in a straight line, and then weaved backward and forwards parallel to that initial course, whilst the more advanced LuT could transit to a different angle after launch, and then enter a more complex weaving pattern.

===Radio and wire guidance===

Though Luppis&#x27; original design had been rope-guided, torpedoes were not wire-guided until the 1960s.

During the First World War the U.S. Navy evaluated a radio controlled torpedo launched from a surface ship called the Hammond Torpedo. A later version tested in the 1930s was claimed to have an effective range of .

Modern torpedoes use an umbilical wire, which nowadays allows the computer processing power of the submarine or ship to be used. Torpedoes such as the U.S. Mark 48 can operate in a variety of modes, increasing tactical flexibility.

===Homing===

Homing &quot;fire and forget&quot; torpedoes can use passive or active guidance or a combination of both. Passive acoustic torpedoes home in on emissions from a target. Active acoustic torpedoes home in on the reflection of a signal, or &quot;ping&quot;, from the torpedo or its parent vehicle; this has the disadvantage of giving away the presence of the torpedo. In semi-active mode, a torpedo can be fired to the last known position or calculated position of a target, which is then acoustically illuminated (&quot;pinged&quot;) once the torpedo is within attack range.

Later in the Second World War torpedoes were given acoustic (homing) guidance systems, with the American Mark 24 mine and Mark 27 torpedo and the German G7es torpedo. Pattern-following and wake homing torpedoes were also developed. Acoustic homing formed the basis for torpedo guidance after the Second World War.

The homing systems for torpedoes are generally acoustic, though there have been other target sensor types used. A ship&#x27;s acoustic signature is not the only emission a torpedo can home in on; to engage U.S. supercarriers, the Soviet Union developed the 53–65 wake-homing torpedo. As standard acoustic lures can&#x27;t distract a wake homing torpedo, the US Navy has installed the Surface Ship Torpedo Defense on aircraft carriers that use a Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo to home in on and destroy the attacking torpedo.

==Warhead and fuzing==
The warhead is generally some form of aluminized explosive, because the sustained explosive pulse produced by the powdered aluminum is particularly destructive against underwater targets. Torpex was popular until the 1950s, but has been superseded by PBX compositions. Nuclear torpedoes have also been developed, e.g. the Mark 45 torpedo. In lightweight antisubmarine torpedoes designed to penetrate submarine hulls, a shaped charge can be used. Detonation can be triggered by direct contact with the target or by a proximity fuze incorporating sonar and/or magnetic sensors.

===Contact detonation===
When a torpedo with a contact fuze strikes the side of the target hull, the resulting explosion creates a bubble of expanding gas, the walls of which move faster than the speed of sound in water, thus creating a shock wave. The side of the bubble which is against the hull rips away the external plating creating a large breach. The bubble then collapses in on itself, forcing a high-speed stream of water into the breach which can destroy bulkheads and machinery in its path.

===Proximity detonation===
A torpedo fitted with a proximity fuze can be detonated directly under the keel of a target ship. The explosion creates a gas bubble which may damage the keel or underside plating of the target. However, the most destructive part of the explosion is the upthrust of the gas bubble, which will bodily lift the hull in the water. The structure of the hull is designed to resist downward rather than upward pressure, causing severe strain in this phase of the explosion. When the gas bubble collapses, the hull will tend to fall into the void in the water, creating a sagging effect. Finally, the weakened hull will be hit by the uprush of water caused by the collapsing gas bubble, causing structural failure. On vessels up to the size of a modern frigate, this can result in the ship breaking in two and sinking. This effect is likely to prove less catastrophic on a much larger hull, for instance, that of an aircraft carrier.

===Damage===
The damage that may be caused by a torpedo depends on the &quot;shock factor value&quot;, a combination of the initial strength of the explosion and the distance between the target and the detonation. For ship hull plating, the term &quot;hull shock factor&quot; (HSF) is used, while keel damage is termed &quot;keel shock factor&quot; (KSF). If the explosion is directly underneath the keel, then HSF is equal to KSF, but explosions that are not directly underneath the ship will have a lower value of KSF.

====Direct damage====
Usually only created by contact detonation, direct damage is a hole blown in the ship. Among the crew, fragmentation wounds are the most common form of injury. Flooding typically occurs in one or two main watertight compartments, which can sink smaller ships or disable larger ones.

====Bubble jet effect====
The bubble jet effect occurs when a mine or torpedo detonates in the water a short distance away from the targeted ship. The explosion creates a bubble in the water, and due to the pressure difference, the bubble will collapse from the bottom. The bubble is buoyant, and so it rises towards the surface. If the bubble reaches the surface as it collapses, it can create a pillar of water that can go over a hundred meters into the air (a &quot;columnar plume&quot;). If conditions are right and the bubble collapses onto the ship&#x27;s hull, the damage to the ship can be extremely serious; the collapsing bubble forms a high-energy jet that can break a meter-wide hole straight through the ship, flooding one or more compartments, and is capable of breaking smaller ships apart. The crew in the areas hit by the pillar are usually killed instantly. Other damage is usually limited.

The Baengnyeong incident, in which broke in half and sank off the coast South Korea in 2010, was caused by the bubble jet effect, according to an international investigation.

====Shock effect====
If the torpedo detonates at a distance from the ship, and especially under the keel, the change in water pressure causes the ship to resonate. This is frequently the most deadly type of explosion if it is strong enough. The whole ship is dangerously shaken and everything on board is tossed around. Engines rip from their beds, cables from their holders, etc. A badly shaken ship usually sinks quickly, with hundreds, or even thousands of small leaks all over the ship and no way to power the pumps. The crew fares no better, as the violent shaking tosses them around. This shaking is powerful enough to cause disabling injury to knees and other joints in the body, particularly if the affected person stands on surfaces connected directly to the hull (such as steel decks).

The resulting gas cavitation and shock-front-differential over the width of the human body is sufficient to stun or kill divers.

==Control surfaces and hydrodynamics==
Control surfaces are essential for a torpedo to maintain its course and depth. A homing torpedo also needs to be able to outmaneuver a target. Good hydrodynamics are needed for it to attain high speed efficiently and also to give a long range since the torpedo has limited stored energy.

== Launch platforms and launchers ==

Torpedoes may be launched from submarines, surface ships, helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, unmanned naval mines and naval fortresses. They are also used in conjunction with other weapons; for example, the Mark 46 torpedo used by the United States is the warhead section of the ASROC, a kind of anti-submarine missile; the CAPTOR mine (CAPsulated TORpedo) is a submerged sensor platform which releases a torpedo when a hostile contact is detected.

===Ships===
Originally, Whitehead torpedoes were intended for launch underwater and the firm was upset when they found out the British were launching them above water, as they considered their torpedoes too delicate for this. However, the torpedoes survived. The launch tubes could be fitted in a ship&#x27;s bow, which weakened it for ramming, or on the broadside; this introduced problems because of water flow twisting the torpedo, so guide rails and sleeves were used to prevent it. The torpedoes were originally ejected from the tubes by compressed air but later slow-burning gunpowder was used. Torpedo boats originally used a frame that dropped the torpedo into the sea. Royal Navy Coastal Motor Boats of World War I used a rear-facing trough and a cordite ram to push the torpedoes into the water tail-first; they then had to move rapidly out of the way to avoid being hit by their torpedo.

Developed in the run-up to the First World War, multiple-tube mounts (initially twin, later triple and in WW2 up to quintuple in some ships) for torpedoes in rotating turntable mounts appeared. Destroyers could be found with two or three of these mounts with between five and twelve tubes in total. The Japanese went one better, covering their tube mounts with splinter protection and adding reloading gear (both unlike any other navy in the world), making them true turrets and increasing the broadside without adding tubes and top hamper (as the quadruple and quintuple mounts did). Considering that their Type 93s were very effective weapons, the IJN equipped their cruisers with torpedoes. The Germans also equipped their capital ships with torpedoes.

Smaller vessels such as PT boats carried their torpedoes in fixed deck-mounted tubes using compressed air. These were either aligned to fire forward or at an offset angle from the centerline.

Later, lightweight mounts for homing torpedoes were developed for anti-submarine use consisting of triple launch tubes used on the decks of ships. These were the 1960 Mk 32 torpedo launcher in the US and part of STWS (Shipborne Torpedo Weapon System) in the UK. Later a below-decks launcher was used by the RN. This basic launch system continues to be used today with improved torpedoes and fire control systems.

===Submarines===
Modern submarines use either swim-out systems or a pulse of water to discharge the torpedo from the tube, both of which have the advantage of being significantly quieter than previous systems, helping avoid detection of the firing from passive sonar. Earlier designs used a pulse of compressed air or a hydraulic ram.

Early submarines, when they carried torpedoes, were fitted with a variety of torpedo launching mechanisms in a range of locations; on the deck, in the bow or stern, amidships, with some launch mechanisms permitting the torpedo to be aimed over a wide arc. By World War II, designs favored multiple bow tubes and fewer or no stern tubes. Modern submarine bows are usually occupied by a large sonar array, necessitating midships tubes angled outward, while stern tubes have largely disappeared. The first French and Russian submarines carried their torpedoes externally in Drzewiecki drop collars. These were cheaper than tubes but less reliable. Both the United Kingdom and the United States experimented with external tubes in World War II. External tubes offered a cheap and easy way of increasing torpedo capacity without radical redesign, something neither had time or resources to do before nor early in, the war. British T-class submarines carried up to 13 torpedo tubes, up to 5 of them external. America&#x27;s use was mainly limited to earlier &quot;Porpoise&quot;-, -, and -class boats. Until the appearance of the class, most American submarines only carried 4 bow and either 2 or 4 stern tubes, something many American submarine officers felt provided inadequate firepower. This problem was compounded by the notorious unreliability of the Mark 14 torpedo.

Late in World War II, the U.S. adopted a homing torpedo (known as &quot;Cutie&quot;) for use against escorts. It was basically a modified Mark 24 Mine with wooden rails to allow firing from a torpedo tube.

===Air launch===

Aerial torpedoes may be carried by fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, or missiles. They are launched from the first two at prescribed speeds and altitudes, dropped from bomb-bays or underwing hardpoints.

== Handling equipment ==
Although lightweight torpedoes are fairly easily handled, the transport and handling of heavyweight torpedoes is difficult, especially in the tight spaces in a submarine. After the Second World War, some Type XXI submarines were obtained from Germany by the United States and Britain. One of the main novel developments seen was a mechanical handling system for torpedoes. Such systems were widely adopted as a result of this discovery. 

== Classes and diameters ==
Torpedoes are launched in several ways:
*From a torpedo tube mounted either in a trainable deck mount (common in destroyers), or fixed above or below the waterline of a surface vessel (as in cruisers, battleships, and armed merchant cruisers) or submarine.
*Early submarines and some torpedo boats (such as the U.S. World War II PT boats, which used the Mark 13 aircraft torpedo) used deck-mounted &quot;drop collars&quot;, which simply relied on gravity.
*From shackles aboard low-flying aircraft or helicopters.
*As the final stage of a compound rocket or ramjet powered munition (sometimes called an assisted torpedo).

Many navies have two weights of torpedoes:
*A light torpedo used primarily as a close attack weapon, particularly by aircraft. The caliber has been described as a NATO standard for this class.
*A heavy torpedo used primarily as a standoff weapon, particularly by submerged submarines. The caliber is a common standard.

In the case of deck or tube launched torpedoes, the diameter of the torpedo is a key factor in determining the suitability of a particular torpedo to a tube or launcher, similar to the caliber of the gun. The size is not quite as critical as for a gun, but the diameter has become the most common way of classifying torpedoes.

Length, weight, and other factors also contribute to compatibility. In the case of aircraft launched torpedoes, the key factors are weight, provision of suitable attachment points, and launch speed. Assisted torpedoes are the most recent development in torpedo design, and are normally engineered as an integrated package. Versions for aircraft and assisted launching have sometimes been based on deck or tube launched versions, and there has been at least one case of a submarine torpedo tube being designed to fire an aircraft torpedo.

As in all munition design, there is a compromise between standardization, which simplifies manufacture and logistics, and specialization, which may make the weapon significantly more effective. Small improvements in either logistics or effectiveness can translate into enormous operational advantages.

<text>Turkish cuisine () is largely the heritage of Ottoman cuisine (Osmanlı mutfağı), Seljuk cuisine and the Turkish diaspora. Turkish cuisine with traditional Turkic elements such as yogurt, ayran, kaymak, exerts and gains influences to and from Mediterranean, Balkan, Middle Eastern, Central Asian and Eastern European cuisines.

Turkish cuisine shows variation across Turkey. The cooking of Istanbul, Bursa, İzmir, and the rest of the Anatolia region inherits many elements of Ottoman court cuisine, including moderate use of spices, a preference for rice over bulgur, koftes, and a wider availability of vegetable stews (&quot;türlü&quot;), eggplant, stuffed dolmas and fish. The cuisine of the Black Sea Region uses fish extensively, especially the Black Sea anchovy (&quot;hamsi&quot;) and includes maize dishes. The cuisine of the southeast (e.g. Urfa, Gaziantep, Adıyaman and Adana) is famous for its variety of kebabs, &quot;mezes&quot; and dough-based desserts such as &quot;baklava&quot;, &quot;şöbiyet&quot;, &quot;kadayıf&quot;, &quot;katmer&quot; and &quot;künefe&quot;.

Especially in the western parts of Turkey, where olive trees grow abundantly, olive oil is the major type of oil used for cooking. The cuisines of the Aegean, Marmara and Mediterranean regions are rich in vegetables, herbs, and fish. Central Anatolia has many famous specialties, such as &quot;keşkek&quot;, &quot;mantı&quot; (especially from Kayseri) and &quot;gözleme&quot;. Food names directly cognate with &quot;mantı&quot; are also found in Chinese (&quot;mantou&quot; or steamed bun), and it is generally considered to have originated in Mongolia during the 13th century.

Specialties are often named for places, and may refer to different styles of preparation. For example, &quot;Urfa kebap&quot; is less spicy and thicker than &quot;Adana kebap&quot;. Although meat-based foods such as kebabs are common in Turkish cuisine abroad, meals in Turkey largely center around rice, vegetables, and bread.

== History ==
In the early years of the republic, a few studies were published about regional Anatolian dishes, but cuisine did not feature heavily in Turkish folkloric studies until the 1980s when the fledgling tourism industry encouraged the Turkish state to sponsor two food symposia. The papers submitted at the symposia presented the history of Turkish cuisine on a &quot;historical continuum&quot; that dated back to Turkic origins in Central Asia and continued through the Seljuk and Ottoman periods.

Prior to the symposia, the study of Turkish culinary culture was first popularized by the publication of Süheyl Ünver&#x27;s &quot;Fifty Dishes in Turkish History&quot; in 1948. This book was based on recipes found in an 18th-century Ottoman manuscript. His second book was about the 15th century palace cuisine during the reign of Sultan Mehmed II. Following the publication of Ünver&#x27;s book, subsequent studies were published, including a 1978 study by a historian named Bahaettin Ögel about the Central Asian origins of Turkish cuisine.

== Culinary customs ==

=== Breakfast ===
A traditional Turkish breakfast is rich in variety. A typical serving consists of cheese (&quot;beyaz peynir&quot;, &quot;kaşar&quot;, etc.), butter, olives, eggs, muhammara, tomatoes, cucumbers, jam, honey, and kaymak, sucuk (optionally spicy Turkish sausage), &quot;pastırma&quot;, &quot;börek&quot;, &quot;simit&quot;, &quot;poğaça&quot;, &quot;açma&quot;, fried dough (known as &quot;pişi&quot;), as well as soups are eaten as a morning meal in Turkey. A specialty for breakfast is called menemen, which is prepared with tomatoes, green peppers, onion, olive oil and eggs. The breakfast menu can also include kuymak (depending on the province the dish is also known as &quot;muhlama, mıhlama&quot; and &quot;yağlaş&quot;). Another specialty is the Balkan Turkish dish çılbır, also known as Turkish eggs, made with poached eggs and yogurt. Invariably, Turkish tea is served at breakfast. The Turkish word for breakfast, &quot;kahvaltı&quot;, means &quot;before coffee&quot;.

=== Homemade food ===
Homemade food is still preferred by Turkish people. Although the newly introduced way of life pushes the new generation to eat out, Turkish people generally prefer to eat at home. A typical meal starts with soup (especially in wintertime), followed by a dish made of vegetables (olive oil or with ground meat), meat or legumes boiled in a pot (typically with meat or minced meat), often with or before Turkish pilav, pasta or bulgur pilav accompanied by a salad or cacık (diluted cold yogurt dish with garlic, salt, and cucumber slices). In summertime many people prefer to eat a cold dish of vegetables cooked with olive oil (&quot;zeytinyağlı yemekler&quot;) instead of the soup, either before or after the main course, which can also be a chicken, meat or fish plate.

=== Restaurants ===
Fast food is gaining popularity and many major foreign fast food chains have opened all over Turkey. Some traditional Turkish foods, especially &quot;köfte&quot;, &quot;döner&quot;, &quot;kokoreç&quot;, &quot;kumpir,&quot; &quot;midye tava,&quot; &quot;börek&quot; and &quot;gözleme&quot;, are often served as fast food in Turkey. Eating out has always been common in large commercial cities. &quot;Esnaf lokantası&quot; (meaning restaurants for shopkeepers and tradesmen) are widespread, serving traditional Turkish home cooking at affordable prices.

=== Summer cuisine ===
In the hot Turkish summer, a meal often consists of fried vegetables such as patlıcan (eggplant/aubergine) and peppers or potatoes served with yogurt or tomato sauce. Menemen and çılbır are typical summer dishes, based on eggs. Sheep cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, watermelons and melons also make a light summer meal. Those who like helva for dessert prefer &quot;summer helva&quot;, which is lighter and less sweet than the regular version.

=== Key ingredients ===
Frequently used ingredients in Turkish specialties include lamb, chicken, beef, fish, rice, eggplants, green peppers, onions, garlic, lentils, beans, zucchinis, chickpeas and tomatoes. Average per person per year beef consumption is . Nuts, especially pistachios, chestnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts, together with spices, have a special place in Turkish cuisine, and are used extensively in desserts or eaten separately. About 1.5 kg of pistachios are eaten per person per year, some packaged and some used in desserts such as baklava. Tahini is a common sauce from sesame seeds sold both pre-packaged or in bulk on tap. Semolina flour is used to make a cake called &quot;revani&quot; and &quot;irmik helvasi&quot;.
Olives are also common on various breakfasts and meze tables frequently. Beyaz peynir and yoğurt are part of many dishes including börek, manti, kebab and cacık.

=== Oils and fats ===
Butter or margarine, olive oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, and corn oil are widely used for cooking. Sesame, hazelnut, peanut and walnut oils are used as well. &quot;Kuyruk yağı&quot; (tail fat of sheep) is sometimes used in kebabs and meat dishes.

=== Fruit ===
The diverse flora of Turkey means that fruit is varied, abundant and cheap. In Ottoman cuisine, fruit frequently accompanied meat as a side dish. Plums, apricots, pomegranates, pears, apples, grapes, figs and quinces along with many kinds of citrus are the most frequently used fruit, either fresh or dried, in Turkish cuisine. For example, &quot;komposto&quot; (compote) or &quot;hoşaf&quot; (from Persian &quot;khosh âb&quot;, literally meaning &quot;nice water&quot;) are among the main side dishes to meat or pilav. &quot;Dolma&quot; and pilav usually contain currants or raisins. &quot;Etli yaprak sarma&quot; (vine leaves stuffed with meat and rice) used to be cooked with sour plums in Ottoman cuisine. Turkish desserts do not normally contain fresh fruit, but may contain dried varieties.

=== Meats ===

The main use of meat in cooking remains the combination of ground meat and vegetable, with names such as &quot;kıymalı fasulye&quot; (beans with ground meat) or &quot;kıymalı ıspanak&quot; (spinach with ground meat, which is sometimes served with yoğurt).

Alternatively, in coastal towns cheap fish such as &quot;sardalya&quot; (sardines) or &quot;hamsi&quot; (anchovies) are widely available, as well as many others with seasonal availability. Poultry consumption, almost exclusively of chicken and eggs, is common. Milk-fed lambs, once the most popular source of meat in Turkey, comprise a small part of contemporary consumption. &quot;Kuzu çevirme&quot;, cooking milk-fed lamb on a spit, once an important ceremony, is rarely seen.

=== Dairy products ===
Yoğurt is an important element in Turkish cuisine. In fact, the English word yogurt or yoghurt derives from the Turkish word &quot;yoğurt&quot;. Yoğurt can accompany almost all meat dishes (kebabs, köfte), vegetable dishes (especially fried eggplant, courgette, spinach with minced meat, etc.), &quot;meze&quot; and a specialty called &quot;mantı&quot; (folded triangles of dough containing minced meat). In villages, yoğurt is regularly eaten with pilav or bread. A thicker, higher-fat variety, &quot;süzme yoğurt&quot; or &quot;strained yogurt&quot;, is made by straining the yoğurt curds from the whey. One of the most common Turkish drinks, &quot;ayran&quot;, is made from yoğurt. Also, yoğurt is often used in the preparation of cakes, some soups and pastries. Keş (Kashk) is a fermented and strained sour yogurt that can be consumed on its own as a cheese, or used as an ingredient in soups.

==== Cheeses ====

Turkey produces many varieties of cheese, mostly from sheep&#x27;s milk. In general, these cheeses are not long matured, with a comparatively low fat content. The production of many kinds of cheese is local to particular regions. There are 193 different cheeses in Turkey, but only 8 of these cheeses have geographical indication.

* &quot;Beyaz peynir&quot; – is a salty brined cheese taking its name from its white color (&quot;white cheese&quot;). It is similar to &quot;feta&quot; but not as strong. This is produced in styles ranging from unmatured cheese curds to a quite strong mature version. It has many varieties due to source of milk, region (Ezine or Thrace) and production methods (classic or cultured). It is eaten plain (e.g. as part of the traditional Turkish breakfast), used in salads, and incorporated into cooked foods such as &quot;menemen&quot;, &quot;börek&quot; and &quot;pide&quot;.
* &quot;Çerkez peyniri –&quot; means &quot;Circassian cheese&quot;. It has two variations, smoked or non-smoked.
* &quot;Çökelek&quot; – is dried cottage cheese. There are many regional varieties of &quot;çökelek&quot;. Some are eaten fresh while others are preserved, either by storage in goatskin bags or pottery jars, or by drying in the sun.

* &quot;Kaşar&quot; – is Turkey&#x27;s other ubiquitous cheese made from cow&#x27;s milk (occasionally mixed with sheep&#x27;s or goat&#x27;s milk), sometimes marketed as &quot;Turkish cheddar&quot;, being closer in consistency and taste to mild cheddar-style cheese than other Turkish cheeses. Less matured &quot;kaşar&quot;, called fresh &quot;kaşar&quot;, is widely consumed as well. Two varieties are popular Kars and Thrace.
* &quot;Kaşkaval&quot; – is a wheel-shaped yellow sheep&#x27;s cheese, similar to fresh &quot;kaşar&quot;. The name comes from Romanian word &quot;cașcaval&quot;, which bears the Italian structure of &quot;caciocavallo&quot;. 
* &quot;Lor&quot; – is the other type of unsalted whey cheese, similarly made from the whey left over from &quot;kaşar&quot; or &quot;strained yogurt&quot; manufacture. &quot;Lor&quot; is used in traditional foods and desserts made from unsalted cheese like &quot;ekşimik&quot; and &quot;höşmerim&quot;
* &quot;Mihaliç peyniri&quot; or &quot;Kelle peyniri&quot; – is a hard sheep&#x27;s cheese that can be grated, like Parmesan cheese. Sometimes goat or cow milk is used. It is a specialty from Karacabey, a town in Bursa province which was called Mihaliç during Byzantine and Ottoman period. Mostly it is produced from non-pasteurized milk and processed by salt.
* &quot;Örgü peyniri&quot; (braided cheese) – is a specialty from Diyarbakır.
* &quot;Otlu peynir&quot;, Van herbed cheese, &#x27;herbed cheese&#x27;, – is produced in many areas, chiefly in East Anatolia. Traditionally sheep&#x27;s or goat&#x27;s milk is used, but more recently cow&#x27;s milk &quot;otlu peynir&quot; has been produced. The type of herb used varies by region: in Van wild garlic is traditional; Bitlis &quot;otlu peynir&quot; contains a damp-loving herb known as &quot;sof otu&quot;. In other areas horse mint (&quot;Mentha longifolia&quot;) and &quot;Pimpinella rhodentha&quot; are used.
* &quot;Tulum&quot; – is a mostly sheep&#x27;s curd molded in an animal skin bag called as tulum. There are regional varieties of &quot;tulum peynir&quot; in such areas as İzmir, Ödemiş, Elazig and Erzincan. And each of the tulum cheeses have very different characteristics.

=== Soups ===
A Turkish meal usually starts with a thin soup (&quot;çorba&quot;). Soups are usually named after their main ingredient, the most common types being mercimek (lentil) çorbası, yogurt, and wheat (often mashed) called tarhana çorbası. Delicacy soups are the ones that are usually not the part of the daily diet, such as İşkembe soup and paça çorbası, although the latter also used to be consumed as a nutritious winter meal. Before the popularisation of the typical Turkish breakfast, soup was the default morning meal for some people.

=== Pastries ===
Turkish cuisine has a range of savoury and sweet pastries. Dough-based specialties form an integral part of traditional Turkish cuisine.

The use of layered dough is rooted in the nomadic character of early Central Asian Turks. The combination of domed metal &quot;sač&quot; and oklava (the Turkish rod-style rolling pin) enabled the invention of the layered dough style used in börek (especially in &quot;Su Böreği&quot;, or &#x27;water pastry&#x27;, a salty baklava-like pastry with cheese filling), güllaç and baklava.

&quot;Börek&quot; is the general name for salty pastries made with yufka (a thick phyllo dough), which consists of thin layers of dough. &quot;Su Böreği&quot;, made with boiled yufka/phyllo layers, cheese and parsley, is the most frequently eaten. &quot;Çiğ börek&quot; (also known as &quot;Tatar böreği&quot;) is fried and stuffed with minced meat. &quot;Kol böreği&quot; is another well-known type of &quot;börek&quot; that takes its name from its shape, as do fincan (coffee cup), muska (talisman), &quot;Gül böreği&quot; (rose) or &quot;Sigara böreği&quot; (cigarette). Other traditional Turkish &quot;böreks&quot; include &quot;Talaş böreği&quot; (phyllo dough filled with vegetables and diced meat), &quot;Puf böreği&quot;. &quot;Laz böreği&quot; is a sweet type of &quot;börek&quot;, widespread in the Black Sea Region.

&quot;Pogača&quot; is the label name for dough based salty pastries. Likewise &quot;çörek&quot; is another label name used for both sweet and salty pastries.

&quot;Gözleme&quot; is a food typical in rural areas, made of lavash bread or phyllo dough folded around a variety of fillings such as spinach, cheese and parsley, minced meat or potatoes and cooked on a large griddle (traditionally &quot;sač&quot;).

&quot;Katmer&quot; is another traditional rolled-out dough. It can be salty or sweet according to the filling. Katmer with pistachio and kaymak is a sweet food and one of the most popular breakfast items in Gaziantep.

Lahmacun (meaning dough with meat in Arabic) is a thin flatbread covered with a layer of spiced minced meat, tomato, pepper, onion or garlic.

Pide, which can be made with minced meat (together with onion, chopped tomatoes, parsley and spices), kashar cheese, spinach, white cheese, pieces of meat, braised meat (&quot;kavurma&quot;), sucuk, pastirma or/and eggs put on rolled-out dough, is one of the most common traditional stone-baked Turkish specialities.

&quot;Açma&quot; is a soft bagel found in most parts of Turkey. It is similar to simit in shape, is covered in a glaze, and is usually eaten as a part of breakfast or as a snack.

=== Pilav and pasta ===


=== Vegetarian dishes ===

==== Vegetable dishes ====

A vegetable dish can be a main course in a Turkish meal. A large variety of vegetables are used, such as spinach, leek, cauliflower, artichoke, cabbage, celery, eggplant, green and red bell peppers, string bean and sunchokes. A typical vegetable dish is prepared with a base of chopped onions, carrots sautéed first in olive oil and later with tomatoes or tomato paste. The vegetables and hot water will then be added. Quite frequently a spoon of rice and lemon juice is also added. Vegetable dishes usually tend to be served with its own water (the cooking water) thus often called in colloquial Turkish &quot;sulu yemek&quot; (literally &quot;a dish with juice&quot;). Minced meat can also be added to a vegetable dish but vegetable dishes that are cooked with olive oil &quot;(zeytinyağlılar)&quot; are often served cold and do not contain meat. Spinach, leek, string bean and artichoke with olive oil are among the most widespread dishes in Turkey.
Dolma is the name used for stuffed vegetables. Like the vegetables cooked with olive oil as described above dolma with olive oil does not contain meat. Many vegetables are stuffed, most typically green peppers (&quot;biber dolması&quot;), eggplants, tomatoes, or zucchini/courgettes (&quot;kabak dolması&quot;), vine leaves (&quot;yaprak dolması&quot;). If vine leaves are used, they are first pickled in brine. However, dolma is not limited to these common types; many other vegetables and fruits are stuffed with a meat or pilav mixture. For example, artichoke dolma (&quot;enginar dolması&quot;) is an Aegean region specialty. Fillings used in dolma may consist of parts of the vegetable carved out for preparation, pilav with spices or minced meat.

&quot;Mercimek köftesi&quot;, although being named köfte, does not contain any meat. Instead, red lentil is used as the major ingredient together with spring onion, tomato paste etc.

=== Dolma and sarma ===

Dolma is a verbal noun of the Turkish verb &quot;dolmak&quot; &#x27;to be stuffed (or filled)&#x27;, and means simply &#x27;stuffed thing&#x27;. Sarma is also a verbal noun of the Turkish verb &quot;sarmak&quot; &#x27;to wrap&#x27;, and means simply &#x27;wrapped/wrapping&#x27;. Dolma and sarma have a special place in Turkish cuisine. They can be eaten either as a meze or a main dish. They can be cooked either as a vegetable dish or meat dish. If a meat mixture is put in, they are usually served hot with yogurt and spices such as oregano and red pepper powder with oil. If the mixture is vegan, only olive oil, rice or bulgur are used, with some nuts and raisins inside, especially blackcurrant.

&quot;Zeytinyağlı yaprak sarması&quot; (stuffed leaves with olive oil) is the sarma made with vine leaves stuffed with a rice-spice mixture and cooked with olive oil. This type of dolma does not contain meat, is served cold and also referred to as &quot;sarma&quot;, which means &quot;wrapping&quot; in Turkish. Dried fruit such as blackcurrant, raisins, figs or cherries, and cinnamon and allspice used to be added into the mixture to sweeten &quot;zeytinyağlı dolma&quot; in Ottoman cuisine. Vine leaves (&quot;yaprak&quot;) could be filled not only with rice and spices but also with meat and rice, &quot;etli yaprak sarma&quot;, in which case it was often served hot with yogurt. The word &quot;sarma&quot; is also used for some types of desserts, such as &quot;fıstık sarma&quot; (wrapped pistachio).

Melon dolma along with quince or apple dolma was one of the palace&#x27;s specialties (raw melon stuffed with minced meat, onion, rice, almonds, cooked in an oven). In contemporary Turkey, a wide variety of dolma is prepared. Although it is not possible to give an exhaustive list of dolma recipes, courgette (&quot;&quot;kabak&quot;), aubergine (&quot;patlıcan&quot;), tomato (&quot;domates&quot;), pumpkin (&quot;balkabağı&quot;), pepper (&quot;biber&quot;), cabbage (&quot;lahana&quot;) (black or white cabbage), chard (&quot;pazı&quot;), and mussel (&quot;midye&quot;&quot;) dolma constitute the most common types. Instead of dried cherries in the Palace Cuisine, currants are usually added to the filling of dolma cooked in olive oil. A different type of dolma is mumbar dolması, for which the membrane of intestines of sheep is filled up with a spicy rice pilav-nut mixture.

The term &quot;pilâki&quot; is also used for fish cooked with various vegetables, including onion in the oven. In the Black Sea region, fish are usually fried with thick corn flour. Fish are also eaten cold; as smoked (isleme) or dried (çiroz), canned, salted or pickled (lâkerda). Fish is also cooked in salt or in dough in Turkey.

=== Desserts ===



Cuisine in the late Ottoman Empire was heavily influenced by &quot;alafranga&quot; style food, in fashion all over Europe and in Russia in the late 19th century. In the Turkish context it has been regarded as a symbol of Westernization. This influence could still be seen in the earliest cookbooks of the early Republican period like the first edition of the &quot;Türk Kadınlar Tatlı Kitabı&quot; (Turkish Women&#x27;s Book of Desserts) which had recipes for Western style sponge cake (&quot;pandispanya&quot;), mille feuille, petit beurre and other western desserts. The revised edition published in 1966 devoted far more attention to traditional confectionery like şekerpare, baklava and helva.

One of the world-renowned desserts of Turkish cuisine is baklava. Baklava is made either with pistachios or walnuts. Turkish cuisine has a range of baklava-like desserts which include &quot;şöbiyet&quot;, &quot;bülbül yuvası&quot;, &quot;saray sarması&quot;, &quot;sütlü nuriye&quot;, and &quot;burma&quot;.

Kadayıf is a common Turkish dessert that employs shredded yufka. There are different types of kadayıf: tel (wire) or burma (wring) kadayıf, both of which can be prepared with either walnuts or pistachios.

Although carrying the label &quot;kadayıf&quot;, &quot;ekmek kadayıfı&quot; is totally different from &quot;tel kadayıf&quot;. &quot;Künefe&quot; and &quot;ekmek kadayıfı&quot; are rich in syrup and butter, and are usually served with kaymak (clotted/scrambled butter). Künefe contains wire kadayıf with a layer of melted cheese in between and it is served hot with pistachios or walnuts.

Katmer is made as a dessert with kaymak (clotted cream,) and like many other delicacies from Gaziantep and Kilis, is also filled and topped with pistachios.

Among milk-based desserts, the most popular ones are &quot;muhallebi&quot;, su muhallebisi, sütlaç (rice pudding), keşkül, kazandibi (meaning the bottom of &quot;kazan&quot; because of its burnt surface), and tavuk göğsü (a sweet, gelatinous, milk pudding dessert quite similar to kazandibi, to which very thinly peeled chicken breast is added to give a chewy texture). A speciality from the Mediterranean region is &quot;haytalı&quot;, which consists of pieces of starch pudding and ice cream (or crushed ice) put in rose water sweetened with syrup.

Helva (halva): &quot;un helvası&quot; (flour helva is usually cooked after someone has died), &quot;süt helvası&quot; (made from raw cow&#x27;s milk, butter, flour and sugar) &quot;irmik helvası&quot; (cooked with semolina and pine nuts), &quot;hoşmerim&quot; (cheese helva), &quot;yaz helvası&quot; (made from walnut or almond), &quot;tahin helvası&quot; (crushed sesame seeds. it is also eaten for breakfast), &quot;kos helva&quot;, &quot;pişmaniye&quot; (floss halva).

Other popular desserts include: &quot;Revani&quot; (with semolina and starch), &quot;şekerpare&quot;, &quot;kalburabasma&quot;, &quot;dilber dudağı&quot;, &quot;vezir parmağı&quot;, &quot;hanım göbeği&quot;, &quot;kemalpaşa&quot;, &quot;tulumba&quot;, &quot;zerde&quot;, &quot;paluze&quot;, &quot;irmik tatlısı/peltesi&quot;, &quot;lokma&quot;.

&quot;Güllaç&quot; is a dessert typically served at Ramadan, which consists of very thin, large dough layers put in milk and rose water, served with pomegranate seeds and walnuts. A story is told that in the kitchens of the Palace, those extra thin dough layers were prepared with &quot;prayers&quot;, as it was believed that if one did not pray while opening phyllo dough, it would never be possible to obtain such thin layers.

&quot;Aşure&quot; can be described as a sweet soup containing boiled beans, wheat and dried fruits. Sometimes cinnamon and rose water is added when being served. According to legend, it was first cooked on Noah&#x27;s Ark and contained seven different ingredients in one dish. All the Anatolian peoples have cooked and are still cooking aşure especially during the month of Muharrem.
Some traditional Turkish desserts are fruit-based: &quot;ayva tatlısı&quot; (quince), &quot;incir tatlısı&quot; (fig), {{lang|tr|kabak tatlısı}} (pumpkin), &quot;elma tatlısı&quot; (apple) and &quot;armut tatlısı&quot; (pear). Fruits are cooked in a pot or in an oven with sugar, carnations and cinnamon (without adding water). After being chilled, they are served with walnuts or pistachios and kaymak or tahini.
Homemade cookies/biscuits are commonly called &quot;kurabiye&quot; in Turkish. The most common types are acıbadem kurabiyesi (prepared only with eggs, sugar and almonds), un kurabiyesi (flour kurabiye) and cevizli kurabiye (kurabiye with walnuts). Another dough based dessert is &quot;ay çöreği&quot;.

&quot;Tahin-pekmez&quot; is a traditional combination especially in rural areas. Tahin is sesame paste and pekmez is grape syrup. These are sold separately and mixed before consumption.

Lokum (Turkish delight), which was eaten for digestion after meals and called &quot;rahat hulkum&quot; in the Ottoman era, is another well-known sweet/candy with a range of varieties.

Cezerye, cevizli sucuk (named after its sucuk/sujuk like shape, also known as Churchkhela in Circassian region) and pestil (fruit leather) are among other common sweets.

Marzipan (&quot;badem ezmesi&quot;) is another common confection in Turkey.
Another jelly like Turkish sweet is macun. Mesir macunu of Manisa/İzmir (which was also called &quot;nevruziye&quot; as this Macun was distributed on the first day of spring in the Ottoman Palace) contains 41 different spices. It is still believed that &quot;mesir macunu&quot; is good for health and has healing effects. As with lokum, nane macunu (prepared with mint) used to be eaten as a digestive after heavy meals. Herbs and flowers having curative effects were grown in the gardens of Topkapı under the control of the chief doctor &quot;hekimbaşı&quot; and pharmacists of the Palace who used those herbs for preparing special types of macun and sherbet.

There are also several types of ice creams based on salep powder or corn starch with rose water such as dondurma (Turkish gum ice cream), dried fruit ice cream, ice cream rose petals.

Dried fruit is also eaten with almonds or walnuts as a dessert. Raisins, dried figs and apricots are the most widespread dried fruits.

&quot;Kaymak&quot; (clotted cream-butter) is often served with desserts to cut through their sweetness.

Turkish tea or Turkish coffee, with or without sugar, is usually served after dinner or more rarely together with desserts.

== Beverages ==

=== Alcoholic beverages ===
{{See also|Turkish wine|Alcohol laws of Turkey|Beer in Turkey}}

Although the majority of Turks profess the Islamic religion, alcoholic beverages are as widely available as anywhere. Rakı (pronounced [ɾaˈkɯ]) is the most popular alcoholic drink in Turkey.

There are a few local brands of lager such as Bomonti, Marmara 34 and Efes Pilsen and a small selection of international beers that are produced in Turkey such as Skol, Beck&#x27;s, Miller, Foster&#x27;s, Carlsberg and Tuborg. In Turkey, craft beers became popular in present-day; Gara Guzu, Feliz Kulpa, Pablo and Graf are some Turkish craft beer brands

There are a variety of local wines produced by Turkish brands such as Sevilen, Kavaklıdere, Doluca, Corvus, Kayra, Pamukkale and Diren which are getting more popular with the change of climatic conditions that affect the production of wine. A range of grape varieties are grown in Turkey. For the production of red wine, the following types of grapes are mainly used; in the Marmara Region, Pinot noir, Adakarası, Papazkarası, Semillion, Kuntra, Gamay, Cinsault; in the Aegean Region, Carignane, Çalkarası, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Alicante Bouschet; in the Black Sea Region and the eastern part of the country, Öküzgözü, Boğazkere; in Central Anatolia, Kalecik Karası, Papazkarası, Dimrit; in the Mediterranean Region, Sergi Karası, Dimrit. As for white wine, the grapes can be listed as follows; in the Marmara Region, Chardonnay, Riesling, Semillion, Beylerce, Yapıncak; in the Aegean Region, muscat and semillion; in the Black Sea Region, Narince; in Central Anatolia, Emir, Goat Cheese. In addition to mass production, it is quite popular to produce wines in private farms and sell them in the locality. Visitors can find different &quot;home made&quot; wines in Central Anatolia (Kapadokya/Cappadocia region – Nevşehir), the Aegean coast (Selçuk and Bozcaada (an island in the Aegean Sea)).

=== Non-alcoholic beverages ===
At breakfast and all day long Turkish people drink black tea (&quot;çay&quot;). Tea is made with two teapots in Turkey. Strong bitter tea made in the upper pot is diluted by adding boiling water from the lower. Turkish coffee (&quot;kahve&quot;) is usually served after meals or with dessert.

Ayran (yogurt drink) is the most common cold beverage, which may accompany almost all dishes in Turkey, except those with fish and other seafood. It is a mix of yogurt and water, similar to lassi. It may be served with salt, according to taste.

Şalgam suyu (mild or spicy fermented black carrot juice) is another important non-alcoholic beverage that is usually combined with kebabs or served together with rakı.

Boza is a traditional winter drink, which is also known as millet wine (served cold with cinnamon and sometimes with leblebi).

Sahlep is another favorite in winter (served hot with cinnamon). Sahlep is extracted from the roots of wild orchids and may be used in Turkish ice cream as well. This was a popular drink in western Europe before coffee was brought from Africa and came to be widely known.

&quot;Limonata&quot; (lemonade) is very popular. It is traditionally served with baklava and other sweets. Sometimes lemonade is served with strawberry flavoring. This is called &quot;çilekli limonata&quot;.

Sherbet (Turkish &quot;şerbet,&quot; pronounced {{IPA|tr|ʃeɾˈbet|}}) is a syrup which can be made from any of a wide variety of ingredients, especially fruits, flowers, or herbs. Examples include pears, quinces, strawberries, apples, cornelian cherry, pomegranates, oranges, rose petals, rose hips, or licorice and spices. Sherbet is drunk diluted with cold water.

Lohusa şerbeti is a beverage usually given to women after childbirth.

In classical Turkish cuisine, &quot;hoşaf&quot; (from the Persian &quot;Khosh-ab&quot;, meaning &quot;fresh water&quot;) alternatively accompanies meat dishes and &quot;pilav&quot; (pilaf).

<text>Tourmaline ( ) is a crystalline silicate mineral group in which boron is compounded with elements such as aluminium, iron, magnesium, sodium, lithium, or potassium. This gemstone comes in a wide variety of colors.

The name is derived from the Sinhalese (), which refers to the carnelian gemstones.

== History ==
Brightly colored Ceylonese gem tourmalines were brought to Europe in great quantities by the Dutch East India Company to satisfy a demand for curiosities and gems. Tourmaline was sometimes called the &quot;Ceylonese Magnet&quot; because it could attract and then repel hot ashes due to its pyroelectric properties.

Tourmalines were used by chemists in the 19th century to polarize light by shining rays onto a cut and polished surface of the gem.

== Species and varieties ==
Commonly encountered species and varieties of tourmaline include the following:
* Schorl species
** Brownish-black to black—
* Dravite species (from the Drave district of Carinthia)
** Dark yellow to brownish-black—
* Elbaite species (named after the island of Elba, Italy)
** Red or pinkish-red— variety
** Light blue to bluish-green— variety (from &quot;indigo&quot;)
** Green— variety
** Colorless— variety ()

=== Schorl ===

The most common species of tourmaline is , the sodium iron (divalent) endmember of the group. It may account for 95% or more of all tourmaline in nature. The early history of the mineral schorl shows that the name &quot;schorl&quot; was in use prior to 1400 because a village known today as Zschorlau (in Saxony, Germany) was then named &quot;Schorl&quot; (or minor variants of this name), and the village had a nearby tin mine where, in addition to cassiterite, black tourmaline was found. The first description of schorl with the name &quot;schürl&quot; and its occurrence (various tin mines in the Ore Mountains) was written by Johannes Mathesius (1504–1565) in 1562 under the title &quot;Sarepta oder Bergpostill&quot;. Up to about 1600, additional names used in the German language were &quot;Schurel&quot;, &quot;Schörle&quot;, and &quot;Schurl&quot;. Beginning in the 18th century, the name &quot;Schörl&quot; was mainly used in the German-speaking area. In English, the names &quot;shorl&quot; and &quot;shirl&quot; were used in the 18th century. In the 19th century the names &quot;common schorl&quot;, &quot;schörl&quot;, &quot;schorl&quot; and &quot;iron tourmaline&quot; were the English words used for this mineral.

=== Dravite ===
, also called , is the sodium magnesium rich tourmaline endmember. Uvite, in comparison, is a calcium magnesium tourmaline. Dravite forms multiple series, with other tourmaline members, including schorl and elbaite.

The name &quot;dravite&quot; was used for the first time by Gustav Tschermak (1836–1927), Professor of Mineralogy and Petrography at the University of Vienna, in his book &quot;Lehrbuch der Mineralogie&quot; (published in 1884) for magnesium-rich (and sodium-rich) tourmaline from village Dobrova near Unterdrauburg in the Drava river area, Carinthia, Austro-Hungarian Empire. Today this tourmaline locality (type locality for dravite) at Dobrova (near Dravograd), is a part of the Republic of Slovenia. Tschermak gave this tourmaline the name dravite, for the Drava river area, which is the district along the Drava River (in German: &quot;Drau&quot;, in Latin: &quot;Drave&quot;) in Austria and Slovenia. The chemical composition which was given by Tschermak in 1884 for this dravite approximately corresponds to the formula , which is in good agreement (except for the OH content) with the endmember formula of dravite as known today.
Dravite varieties include the deep green chromium dravite and the vanadium dravite.

=== Elbaite ===
A lithium-tourmaline elbaite was one of three pegmatitic minerals from Utö, Sweden, in which the new alkali element lithium (Li) was determined in 1818 by Johan August Arfwedson for the first time. Elba Island, Italy, was one of the first localities where colored and colorless Li-tourmalines were extensively chemically analysed. In 1850, Karl Friedrich August Rammelsberg described fluorine (F) in tourmaline for the first time. In 1870, he proved that all varieties of tourmaline contain chemically bound water. In 1889, Scharitzer proposed the substitution of (OH) by F in red Li-tourmaline from Sušice, Czech Republic. In 1914, Vladimir Vernadsky proposed the name &quot;Elbait&quot; for lithium-, sodium-, and aluminum-rich tourmaline from Elba Island, Italy, with the simplified formula . Most likely the type material for elbaite was found at Fonte del Prete, San Piero in Campo, Campo nell&#x27;Elba, Elba Island, Province of Livorno, Tuscany, Italy. In 1933 Winchell published an updated formula for elbaite, , which is commonly used to date written as . The first crystal structure determination of a Li-rich tourmaline was published in 1972 by Donnay and Barton, performed on a pink elbaite from San Diego County, California, United States.

== Chemical composition ==

The tourmaline mineral group is chemically one of the most complicated groups of silicate minerals. Its composition varies widely because of isomorphous replacement (solid solution), and its general formula can be written as , where:

* X = Ca, Na, K, ▢ = vacancy
* Y = Li, Mg, Fe2+, Mn2+, Zn, Al, Cr3+, V3+, Fe3+, Ti4+, ▢ = vacancy
* Z = Mg, Al, Fe3+, Cr3+, V3+
* T = Si, Al, B
* B = B, ▢ = vacancy
* V = OH, O
* W = OH, F, O

Mineral species that were named before the IMA was founded in 1958 do not have an IMA number.
The IMA commission on new mineral names published a list of approved symbols for each mineral species in 2021.

A revised nomenclature for the tourmaline group was published in 2011.

== Physical properties ==
=== Crystal structure ===
Tourmaline is a six-member ring cyclosilicate having a trigonal crystal system. It occurs as long, slender to thick prismatic and columnar crystals that are usually triangular in cross-section, often with curved striated faces. The style of termination at the ends of crystals is sometimes asymmetrical, called hemimorphism. Small slender prismatic crystals are common in a fine-grained granite called aplite, often forming radial daisy-like patterns. Tourmaline is distinguished by its three-sided prisms; no other common mineral has three sides. Prisms faces often have heavy vertical striations that produce a rounded triangular effect. Tourmaline is rarely perfectly euhedral. An exception was the fine dravite tourmalines of Yinnietharra, in western Australia. The deposit was discovered in the 1970s, but is now exhausted. All hemimorphic crystals are piezoelectric, and are often pyroelectric as well.

A crystal of tourmaline is built up of units consisting of a six-member silica ring that binds above to a large cation, such as sodium. The ring binds below to a layer of metal ions and hydroxyls or halogens, which structurally resembles a fragment of kaolin. This in turn binds to three triangular borate ions. Units joined end to end form columns running the length of the crystal. Each column binds with two other columns offset one-third and two-thirds of the vertical length of a single unit to form bundles of three columns. Bundles are packed together to form the final crystal structure. Because the neighboring columns are offset, the basic structural unit is not a unit cell: The actual unit cell of this structure includes portions of several units belonging to adjacent columns.
=== Color ===


Tourmaline has a variety of colors. Iron-rich tourmalines are usually black to bluish-black to deep brown, while magnesium-rich varieties are brown to yellow, and lithium-rich tourmalines are almost any color: blue, green, red, yellow, pink, etc. Rarely, it is colorless. Bi-colored and multicolored crystals are common, reflecting variations of fluid chemistry during crystallization. Crystals may be green at one end and pink at the other, or green on the outside and pink inside; this type is called watermelon tourmaline and is prized in jewelry. An excellent example of watermelon tourmaline jewelry is a brooch piece (1969, gold, watermelon tourmaline, diamonds) by Andrew Grima (British, b. Italy, 1921–2007), in the collection of Kimberly Klosterman and on display at the Cincinnati Art Museum. Some forms of tourmaline are dichroic; they change color when viewed from different directions.

The pink color of tourmalines from many localities is the result of prolonged natural irradiation. During their growth, these tourmaline crystals incorporated Mn2+ and were initially very pale. Due to natural gamma ray exposure from radioactive decay of 40K in their granitic environment, gradual formation of Mn3+ ions occurs, which is responsible for the deepening of the pink to red color.

=== Magnetism ===
Opaque black schorl and yellow tsilaisite are idiochromatic tourmaline species that have high magnetic susceptibilities due to high concentrations of iron and manganese respectively. Most gem-quality tourmalines are of the elbaite species. Elbaite tourmalines are allochromatic, deriving most of their color and magnetic susceptibility from schorl (which imparts iron) and tsilaisite (which imparts manganese).

Red and pink tourmalines have the lowest magnetic susceptibilities among the elbaites, while tourmalines with bright yellow, green and blue colors are the most magnetic elbaites. Dravite species such as green chromium dravite and brown dravite are diamagnetic. A handheld neodymium magnet can be used to identify or separate some types of tourmaline gems from others. For example, blue indicolite tourmaline is the only blue gemstone of any kind that will show a drag response when a neodymium magnet is applied. Any blue tourmaline that is diamagnetic can be identified as paraiba tourmaline colored by copper in contrast to magnetic blue tourmaline colored by iron.

=== Treatments ===
Some tourmaline gems, especially pink to red colored stones, are altered by heat treatment to improve their color. Overly dark red stones can be lightened by careful heat treatment. The pink color in manganese-containing near-colorless to pale pink stones can be greatly increased by irradiation with gamma-rays or electron beams. Irradiation is almost impossible to detect in tourmalines, and does not, currently, affect the value. Heavily included tourmalines, such as rubellite and Brazilian paraiba, are sometimes clarity-enhanced. A clarity-enhanced tourmaline (especially the paraiba variety) is worth much less than an untreated gem of equal clarity.

== Geology ==

Tourmaline is found in granite and granite pegmatites and in metamorphic rocks such as schist and marble. Schorl and lithium-rich tourmalines are usually found in granite and granite pegmatite. Magnesium-rich tourmalines, dravites, are generally restricted to schists and marble. Tourmaline is a durable mineral and can be found in minor amounts as grains in sandstone and conglomerate, and is part of the ZTR index for highly weathered sediments.

== Localities ==
Gem and specimen tourmaline is mined chiefly in Brazil and many parts of Africa, including Tanzania, Nigeria, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Malawi, and Namibia. It is also mined in Asia, notably in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Indonesia as well as in Sri Lanka and India, where some placer material suitable for gem use is found.

=== United States ===
Some fine gems and specimen material have been produced in the United States, with the first discoveries in 1822, in the state of Maine. California became a large producer of tourmaline in the early 1900s. The Maine deposits tend to produce crystals in raspberry pink-red as well as minty greens. The California deposits are known for bright pinks, as well as bicolors. During the early 1900s, Maine and California were the world&#x27;s largest producers of gem tourmalines. The Empress Dowager Cixi of China loved pink tourmaline and bought large quantities for gemstones and carvings from the then new Himalaya Mine, located in San Diego County, California. It is not clear when the first tourmaline was found in California. Native Americans have used pink and green tourmaline as funeral gifts for centuries. The first documented case was in 1890 when Charles Russel Orcutt found pink tourmaline at what later became the Stewart Mine at Pala, California in San Diego County.

=== Brazil ===
Almost every color of tourmaline can be found in Brazil, especially in Minas Gerais and Bahia. The new type of tourmaline, which soon became known as paraiba tourmaline, came in blue and green. Brazilian paraiba tourmaline usually contains abundant inclusions. Much of the paraiba tourmaline from Brazil does not actually come from Paraíba, but the neighboring state of Rio Grande do Norte. Material from Rio Grande do Norte is often somewhat less intense in color, but many fine gems are found there. It was determined that the element copper was important in the coloration of the stone.

A large bluish-green tourmaline from Paraiba, measuring and weighing , is the world&#x27;s largest cut tourmaline. Owned by Billionaire Business Enterprises, it was presented in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on 14 October 2009.

=== Africa ===
In the late 1990s, copper-containing tourmaline was found in Nigeria. The material was generally paler and less saturated than the Brazilian materials, although the material generally was much less included. A more recent African discovery from Mozambique has also produced tourmaline colored by copper, similar to the Brazilian paraiba. The Mozambique paraiba material usually is more intensely colored than the Nigerian and Mozambique Paraiba tourmaline have similar colors to the Brazilian Paraiba, but the prices are relatively cheaper, better clarity and larger sizes. In recent years the pricing of these beautiful gemstones has increased significantly.

Another highly valuable variety is chrome tourmaline, a rare type of dravite tourmaline from Tanzania. Chrome tourmaline is a rich green color due to the presence of chromium atoms in the crystal. Of the standard elbaite colors, blue indicolite gems are typically the most valuable, followed by green verdelite and pink to red rubellite.

<doc id="31429" wikidata="Q33539" url="?curid=31429" title="Twin paradox">
<text>In physics, the twin paradox is a thought experiment in special relativity involving twins, one of whom takes a space voyage at relativistic speeds and returns home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more. This result appears puzzling because each twin sees the other twin as moving, and so, as a consequence of an incorrect and naive application of time dilation and the principle of relativity, each should paradoxically find the other to have aged less. However, this scenario can be resolved within the standard framework of special relativity: the travelling twin&#x27;s trajectory involves two different inertial frames, one for the outbound journey and one for the inbound journey. Another way to understand the paradox is to realize the travelling twin is undergoing acceleration, which makes them a non-inertial observer. In both views there is no symmetry between the spacetime paths of the twins. Therefore, the twin paradox is not actually a paradox in the sense of a logical contradiction.

Starting with Paul Langevin in 1911, there have been various explanations of this paradox. These explanations &quot;can be grouped into those that focus on the effect of different standards of simultaneity in different frames, and those that designate the acceleration [experienced by the travelling twin] as the main reason&quot;. Max von Laue argued in 1913 that since the traveling twin must be in two separate inertial frames, one on the way out and another on the way back, this frame switch is the reason for the aging difference. Explanations put forth by Albert Einstein and Max Born invoked gravitational time dilation to explain the aging as a direct effect of acceleration. However, it has been proven that neither general relativity, nor even acceleration, are necessary to explain the effect, as the effect still applies if two astronauts pass each other at the turnaround point and synchronize their clocks at that point. The situation at the turnaround point can be thought of as where a pair of observers, one travelling away from the starting point and another travelling toward it, pass by each other, and where the clock reading of the first observer is transferred to that of the second one, both maintaining constant speed, with both trip times being added at the end of their journey.

==History==

In his famous paper on special relativity in 1905, Albert Einstein deduced that for two stationary and synchronous clocks that are placed at points A and B, if the clock at A is moved along the line AB and stops at B, the clock that moved from A would lag behind the clock at B. He stated that this result would also apply if the path from A to B was polygonal or circular. Einstein considered this to be a natural consequence of special relativity, not a paradox as some suggested, and in 1911, he restated and elaborated on this result as follows (with physicist Robert Resnick&#x27;s comments following Einstein&#x27;s):

In 1911, Paul Langevin gave a &quot;striking example&quot; by describing the story of a traveler making a trip at a Lorentz factor of (99.995% the speed of light). The traveler remains in a projectile for one year of his time, and then reverses direction. Upon return, the traveler will find that he has aged two years, while 200 years have passed on Earth. During the trip, both the traveler and Earth keep sending signals to each other at a constant rate, which places Langevin&#x27;s story among the Doppler shift versions of the twin paradox. The relativistic effects upon the signal rates are used to account for the different aging rates. The asymmetry that occurred because only the traveler underwent acceleration is used to explain why there is any difference at all, because &quot;any change of velocity, or any acceleration has an absolute meaning&quot;.

Max von Laue (1911, 1913) elaborated on Langevin&#x27;s explanation. Using Hermann Minkowski&#x27;s spacetime formalism, Laue went on to demonstrate that the world lines of the inertially moving bodies maximize the proper time elapsed between two events. He also wrote that the asymmetric aging is completely accounted for by the fact that the astronaut twin travels in two separate frames, while the Earth twin remains in one frame, and the time of acceleration can be made arbitrarily small compared with the time of inertial motion. Eventually, Lord Halsbury and others removed any acceleration by introducing the &quot;three-brother&quot; approach. The traveling twin transfers his clock reading to a third one, traveling in the opposite direction. Another way of avoiding acceleration effects is the use of the relativistic Doppler effect .

Neither Einstein nor Langevin considered such results to be problematic: Einstein only called it &quot;peculiar&quot; while Langevin presented it as a consequence of absolute acceleration. Both men argued that, from the time differential illustrated by the story of the twins, no self-contradiction could be constructed. In other words, neither Einstein nor Langevin saw the story of the twins as constituting a challenge to the self-consistency of relativistic physics.

==Specific example==
Consider a space ship traveling from Earth to the nearest star system: a distance years away, at a speed (i.e., 80% of the speed of light).

To make the numbers easy, the ship is assumed to attain full speed in a negligible time upon departure (even though it would actually take about 9 months accelerating at 1 &quot;g&quot; to get up to speed). Similarly, at the end of the outgoing trip, the change in direction needed to start the return trip is assumed to occur in a negligible time. This can also be modelled by assuming that the ship is already in motion at the beginning of the experiment and that the return event is modelled by a Dirac delta distribution acceleration.

The parties will observe the situation as follows:

=== Earth perspective ===
The Earth-based mission control reasons about the journey this way: the round trip will take in Earth time (&quot;i.e.&quot; everybody who stays on Earth will be 10 years older when the ship returns). The amount of time as measured on the ship&#x27;s clocks and the aging of the travelers during their trip will be reduced by the factor formula_1, the reciprocal of the Lorentz factor (time dilation). In this case and the travelers will have aged only when they return.

=== Travellers&#x27; perspective ===
The ship&#x27;s crew members also calculate the particulars of their trip from their perspective. They know that the distant star system and the Earth are moving relative to the ship at speed &quot;v&quot; during the trip. In their rest frame the distance between the Earth and the star system is years (length contraction), for both the outward and return journeys. Each half of the journey takes , and the round trip takes twice as long (6 years). Their calculations show that they will arrive home having aged 6 years. The travelers&#x27; final calculation about their aging is in complete agreement with the calculations of those on Earth, though they experience the trip quite differently from those who stay at home.

=== Conclusion ===

No matter what method they use to predict the clock readings, everybody will agree about them. If twins are born on the day the ship leaves, and one goes on the journey while the other stays on Earth, they will meet again when the traveler is 6 years old and the stay-at-home twin is 10 years old.

==Resolution of the paradox in special relativity==

The paradoxical aspect of the twins&#x27; situation arises from the fact that at any given moment the travelling twin&#x27;s clock is running slow in the earthbound twin&#x27;s inertial frame, but based on the relativity principle one could equally argue that the earthbound twin&#x27;s clock is running slow in the travelling twin&#x27;s inertial frame. One proposed resolution is based on the fact that the earthbound twin is at rest in the same inertial frame throughout the journey, while the travelling twin is not: in the simplest version of the thought-experiment, the travelling twin switches at the midpoint of the trip from being at rest in an inertial frame which moves in one direction (away from the Earth) to being at rest in an inertial frame which moves in the opposite direction (towards the Earth). In this approach, determining which observer switches frames and which does not is crucial. Although both twins can legitimately claim that they are at rest in their own frame, only the traveling twin experiences acceleration when the spaceship engines are turned on. This acceleration, measurable with an accelerometer, makes his rest frame temporarily non-inertial. This reveals a crucial asymmetry between the twins&#x27; perspectives: although we can predict the aging difference from both perspectives, we need to use different methods to obtain correct results.

===Role of acceleration===
Although some solutions attribute a crucial role to the acceleration of the travelling twin at the time of the turnaround, others note that the effect also arises if one imagines two separate travellers, one outward-going and one inward-coming, who pass each other and synchronize their clocks at the point corresponding to &quot;turnaround&quot; of a single traveller. In this version, physical acceleration of the travelling clock plays no direct role; &quot;the issue is how long the world-lines are, not how bent&quot;. The length referred to here is the Lorentz-invariant length or &quot;proper time interval&quot; of a trajectory which corresponds to the elapsed time measured by a clock following that trajectory (see Section Difference in elapsed time as a result of differences in twins&#x27; spacetime paths below). In Minkowski spacetime, the travelling twin must feel a different history of accelerations from the earthbound twin, even if this just means accelerations of the same size separated by different amounts of time, however &quot;even this role for acceleration can be eliminated in formulations of the twin paradox in curved spacetime, where the twins can fall freely along space-time geodesics between meetings&quot;.

===Relativity of simultaneity===

For a moment-by-moment understanding of how the time difference between the twins unfolds, one must understand that in special relativity there is no concept of &quot;absolute present&quot;. For different inertial frames there are different sets of events that are simultaneous in that frame. This relativity of simultaneity means that switching from one inertial frame to another requires an adjustment in what slice through spacetime counts as the &quot;present&quot;. In the spacetime diagram on the right, drawn for the reference frame of the Earth-based twin, that twin&#x27;s world line coincides with the vertical axis (his position is constant in space, moving only in time). On the first leg of the trip, the second twin moves to the right (black sloped line); and on the second leg, back to the left. Blue lines show the &quot;planes of simultaneity&quot; for the traveling twin during the first leg of the journey; red lines, during the second leg. Just before turnaround, the traveling twin calculates the age of the Earth-based twin by measuring the interval along the vertical axis from the origin to the upper blue line. Just after turnaround, if he recalculates, he will measure the interval from the origin to the lower red line. In a sense, during the U-turn the plane of simultaneity jumps from blue to red and very quickly sweeps over a large segment of the world line of the Earth-based twin. When one transfers from the outgoing inertial frame to the incoming inertial frame there is a jump discontinuity in the age of the Earth-based twin (6.4 years in the example above).

==A non-spacetime approach==
As mentioned above, an &quot;out and back&quot; twin paradox adventure may incorporate the transfer of clock reading from an &quot;outgoing&quot; astronaut to an &quot;incoming&quot; astronaut, thus eliminating the effect of acceleration. Also, the physical acceleration of clocks does not contribute to the kinematical effects of special relativity. Rather, in special relativity, the time differential between two reunited clocks is produced purely by uniform inertial motion, as discussed in Einstein&#x27;s original 1905 relativity paper, as well as in all subsequent kinematical derivations of the Lorentz transformations.

Because spacetime diagrams incorporate Einstein&#x27;s clock synchronization (with its lattice of clocks methodology), there will be a requisite jump in the reading of the Earth clock time made by a &quot;suddenly returning astronaut&quot; who inherits a &quot;new meaning of simultaneity&quot; in keeping with a new clock synchronization dictated by the transfer to a different inertial frame, as explained in Spacetime Physics by John A. Wheeler.

If, instead of incorporating Einstein&#x27;s clock synchronization (lattice of clocks), the astronaut (outgoing and incoming) and the Earth-based party regularly update each other on the status of their clocks by way of sending radio signals (which travel at light speed), then all parties will note an incremental buildup of asymmetry in time-keeping, beginning at the &quot;turn around&quot; point. Prior to the &quot;turn around&quot;, each party regards the other party&#x27;s clock to be recording time differently from his own, but the noted difference is symmetrical between the two parties. After the &quot;turn around&quot;, the noted differences are not symmetrical, and the asymmetry grows incrementally until the two parties are reunited. Upon finally reuniting, this asymmetry can be seen in the actual difference showing on the two reunited clocks.

==The equivalence of biological aging and clock time-keeping==
All processes—chemical, biological, measuring apparatus functioning, human perception involving the eye and brain, the communication of force—are constrained by the speed of light. There is clock functioning at every level, dependent on light speed and the inherent delay at even the atomic level. Biological aging, therefore, is in no way different from clock time-keeping. This means that biological aging would be slowed in the same manner as a clock.

==What it looks like: the relativistic Doppler shift==

In view of the frame-dependence of simultaneity for events at different locations in space, some treatments prefer a more phenomenological approach, describing what the twins would observe if each sent out a series of regular radio pulses, equally spaced in time according to the emitter&#x27;s clock. This is equivalent to asking, if each twin sent a video feed of themselves to each other, what do they see in their screens? Or, if each twin always carried a clock indicating his age, what time would each see in the image of their distant twin and his clock?

Shortly after departure, the traveling twin sees the stay-at-home twin with no time delay. At arrival, the image in the ship screen shows the staying twin as he was 1 year after launch, because radio emitted from Earth 1 year after launch gets to the other star 4 years afterwards and meets the ship there. During this leg of the trip, the traveling twin sees his own clock advance 3 years and the clock in the screen advance 1 year, so it seems to advance at the normal rate, just 20 image seconds per ship minute. This combines the effects of time dilation due to motion (by factor , five years on Earth are 3 years on ship) and the effect of increasing light-time-delay (which grows from 0 to 4 years).

Of course, the observed frequency of the transmission is also the frequency of the transmitter (a reduction in frequency; &quot;red-shifted&quot;). This is called the relativistic Doppler effect. The frequency of clock-ticks (or of wavefronts) which one sees from a source with rest frequency &quot;f&quot;rest is
:formula_2
when the source is moving directly away. This is &quot;f&quot;obs = &quot;f&quot;rest for &quot;v&quot;/&quot;c&quot; = 0.8.

As for the stay-at-home twin, he gets a slowed signal from the ship for 9 years, at a frequency the transmitter frequency. During these 9 years, the clock of the traveling twin in the screen seems to advance 3 years, so both twins see the image of their sibling aging at a rate only their own rate. Expressed in other way, they would both see the other&#x27;s clock run at their own clock speed. If they factor out of the calculation the fact that the light-time delay of the transmission is increasing at a rate of 0.8 seconds per second, &quot;both&quot; can work out that the other twin is aging slower, at 60% rate.

Then the ship turns back toward home. The clock of the staying twin shows &quot;1 year after launch&quot; in the screen of the ship, and during the 3 years of the trip back it increases up to &quot;10 years after launch&quot;, so the clock in the screen seems to be advancing 3 times faster than usual.

When the source is moving towards the observer, the observed frequency is higher (&quot;blue-shifted&quot;) and given by
:formula_3
This is &quot;f&quot;obs = 3&quot;f&quot;rest for &quot;v&quot;/&quot;c&quot; = 0.8.

As for the screen on Earth, it shows that trip back beginning 9 years after launch, and the traveling clock in the screen shows that 3 years have passed on the ship. One year later, the ship is back home and the clock shows 6 years. So, during the trip back, &quot;both&quot; twins see their sibling&#x27;s clock going 3 times faster than their own. Factoring out the fact that the light-time-delay is decreasing by 0.8 seconds every second, each twin calculates that the other twin is aging at 60% his own aging speed.
The &quot;x&quot;–&quot;t&quot; (space–time) diagrams at right show the paths of light signals traveling between Earth and ship (1st diagram) and between ship and Earth (2nd diagram). These signals carry the images of each twin and his age-clock to the other twin. The vertical black line is the Earth&#x27;s path through spacetime and the other two sides of the triangle show the ship&#x27;s path through spacetime (as in the Minkowski diagram above). As far as the sender is concerned, he transmits these at equal intervals (say, once an hour) according to his own clock; but according to the clock of the twin receiving these signals, they are not being received at equal intervals.

After the ship has reached its cruising speed of 0.8&quot;c&quot;, each twin would see 1 second pass in the received image of the other twin for every 3 seconds of his own time. That is, each would see the image of the other&#x27;s clock going slow, not just slow by the factor 0.6, but even slower because light-time-delay is increasing 0.8 seconds per second. This is shown in the figures by red light paths. At some point, the images received by each twin change so that each would see 3 seconds pass in the image for every second of his own time. That is, the received signal has been increased in frequency by the Doppler shift. These high frequency images are shown in the figures by blue light paths.

===The asymmetry in the Doppler shifted images===
The asymmetry between the Earth and the space ship is manifested in this diagram by the fact that more blue-shifted (fast aging) images are received by the ship. Put another way, the space ship sees the image change from a red-shift (slower aging of the image) to a blue-shift (faster aging of the image) at the midpoint of its trip (at the turnaround, 3 years after departure); the Earth sees the image of the ship change from red-shift to blue shift after 9 years (almost at the end of the period that the ship is absent). In the next section, one will see another asymmetry in the images: the Earth twin sees the ship twin age by the same amount in the red and blue shifted images; the ship twin sees the Earth twin age by different amounts in the red and blue shifted images.

==Calculation of elapsed time from the Doppler diagram==
The twin on the ship sees low frequency (red) images for 3 years. During that time, he would see the Earth twin in the image grow older by . He then sees high frequency (blue) images during the back trip of 3 years. During that time, he would see the Earth twin in the image grow older by When the journey is finished, the image of the Earth twin has aged by 

The Earth twin sees 9 years of slow (red) images of the ship twin, during which the ship twin ages (in the image) by He then sees fast (blue) images for the remaining 1 year until the ship returns. In the fast images, the ship twin ages by The total aging of the ship twin in the images received by Earth is , so the ship twin returns younger (6 years as opposed to 10 years on Earth).

===The distinction between what they see and what they calculate===
To avoid confusion, note the distinction between what each twin sees and what each would calculate. Each sees an image of his twin which he knows originated at a previous time and which he knows is Doppler shifted. He does not take the elapsed time in the image as the age of his twin now.
*If he wants to calculate when his twin was the age shown in the image (&quot;i.e.&quot; how old he himself was then), he has to determine how far away his twin was when the signal was emitted—in other words, he has to consider simultaneity for a distant event.
*If he wants to calculate how fast his twin was aging when the image was transmitted, he adjusts for the Doppler shift. For example, when he receives high frequency images (showing his twin aging rapidly) with frequency formula_4, he does not conclude that the twin was aging that rapidly when the image was generated, any more than he concludes that the siren of an ambulance is emitting the frequency he hears. He knows that the Doppler effect has increased the image frequency by the factor 1 / (1 − &quot;v&quot;/&quot;c&quot;). Therefore, he calculates that his twin was aging at the rate of
:formula_5
when the image was emitted. A similar calculation reveals that his twin was aging at the same reduced rate of &quot;εf&quot;rest in all low frequency images.

===Simultaneity in the Doppler shift calculation===
It may be difficult to see where simultaneity came into the Doppler shift calculation, and indeed the calculation is often preferred because one does not have to worry about simultaneity. As seen above, the ship twin can convert his received Doppler-shifted rate to a slower rate of the clock of the distant clock for both red and blue images. If he ignores simultaneity, he might say his twin was aging at the reduced rate throughout the journey and therefore should be younger than he is. He is now back to square one, and has to take into account the change in his notion of simultaneity at the turnaround. The rate he can calculate for the image (corrected for Doppler effect) is the rate of the Earth twin&#x27;s clock at the moment it was sent, not at the moment it was received. Since he receives an unequal number of red and blue shifted images, he should realize that the red and blue shifted emissions were not emitted over equal time periods for the Earth twin, and therefore he must account for simultaneity at a distance.

==Viewpoint of the traveling twin==
During the turnaround, the traveling twin is in an accelerated reference frame. According to the equivalence principle, the traveling twin may analyze the turnaround phase as if the stay-at-home twin were freely falling in a gravitational field and as if the traveling twin were stationary. A 1918 paper by Einstein presents a conceptual sketch of the idea. From the viewpoint of the traveler, a calculation for each separate leg, ignoring the turnaround, leads to a result in which the Earth clocks age less than the traveler. For example, if the Earth clocks age 1 day less on each leg, the amount that the Earth clocks will lag behind amounts to 2 days. The physical description of what happens at turnaround has to produce a contrary effect of double that amount: 4 days&#x27; advancing of the Earth clocks. Then the traveler&#x27;s clock will end up with a net 2-day delay on the Earth clocks, in agreement with calculations done in the frame of the stay-at-home twin.

The mechanism for the advancing of the stay-at-home twin&#x27;s clock is gravitational time dilation. When an observer finds that inertially moving objects are being accelerated with respect to themselves, those objects are in a gravitational field insofar as relativity is concerned. For the traveling twin at turnaround, this gravitational field fills the universe. In a weak field approximation, clocks tick at a rate of where &quot;Φ&quot; is the difference in gravitational potential. In this case, where &quot;g&quot; is the acceleration of the traveling observer during turnaround and &quot;h&quot; is the distance to the stay-at-home twin. The rocket is firing towards the stay-at-home twin, thereby placing that twin at a higher gravitational potential. Due to the large distance between the twins, the stay-at-home twin&#x27;s clocks will appear to be sped up enough to account for the difference in proper times experienced by the twins. It is no accident that this speed-up is enough to account for the simultaneity shift described above. The general relativity solution for a static homogeneous gravitational field and the special relativity solution for finite acceleration produce identical results.

Other calculations have been done for the traveling twin (or for any observer who sometimes accelerates), which do not involve the equivalence principle, and which do not involve any gravitational fields. Such calculations are based only on the special theory, not the general theory, of relativity. One approach calculates surfaces of simultaneity by considering light pulses, in accordance with Hermann Bondi&#x27;s idea of the k-calculus. A second approach calculates a straightforward but technically complicated integral to determine how the traveling twin measures the elapsed time on the stay-at-home clock. An outline of this second approach is given in a separate section below.

==Difference in elapsed time as a result of differences in twins&#x27; spacetime paths==


The following paragraph shows several things:
*how to employ a precise mathematical approach in calculating the differences in the elapsed time
*how to prove exactly the dependency of the elapsed time on the different paths taken through spacetime by the twins
*how to quantify the differences in elapsed time
*how to calculate proper time as a function (integral) of coordinate time

Let clock &quot;K&quot; be associated with the &quot;stay at home twin&quot;.
Let clock K&#x27; be associated with the rocket that makes the trip.
At the departure event both clocks are set to 0.

:Phase 1: Rocket (with clock K&#x27;) embarks with constant proper acceleration &quot;a&quot; during a time &quot;T&quot;a as measured by clock &quot;K&quot; until it reaches some velocity &quot;V&quot;.
:Phase 2: Rocket keeps coasting at velocity &quot;V&quot; during some time &quot;T&quot;c according to clock &quot;K&quot;.
:Phase 3: Rocket fires its engines in the opposite direction of &quot;K&quot; during a time &quot;T&quot;a according to clock &quot;K&quot; until it is at rest with respect to clock &quot;K&quot;. The constant proper acceleration has the value −&quot;a&quot;, in other words the rocket is &quot;decelerating&quot;.
:Phase 4: Rocket keeps firing its engines in the opposite direction of &quot;K&quot;, during the same time &quot;T&quot;a according to clock &quot;K&quot;, until K&#x27; regains the same speed &quot;V&quot; with respect to &quot;K&quot;, but now towards &quot;K&quot; (with velocity −&quot;V&quot;).
:Phase 5: Rocket keeps coasting towards &quot;K&quot; at speed &quot;V&quot; during the same time &quot;T&quot;c according to clock &quot;K&quot;.
:Phase 6: Rocket again fires its engines in the direction of &quot;K&quot;, so it decelerates with a constant proper acceleration &quot;a&quot; during a time &quot;T&quot;a, still according to clock &quot;K&quot;, until both clocks reunite.

Knowing that the clock &quot;K&quot; remains inertial (stationary), the total accumulated proper time Δ&quot;τ&quot; of clock K&#x27; will be given by the integral function of coordinate time Δ&quot;t&quot;
:formula_6
where &quot;v&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the &quot;coordinate velocity&quot; of clock K&#x27; as a function of &quot;t&quot; according to clock &quot;K&quot;, and, e.g. during phase 1, given by
:formula_7

This integral can be calculated for the 6 phases:
:Phase 1 formula_8
:Phase 2 formula_9
:Phase 3 formula_8
:Phase 4 formula_8
:Phase 5 formula_9
:Phase 6 formula_8

where &quot;a&quot; is the proper acceleration, felt by clock K&#x27; during the acceleration phase(s) and where the following relations hold between &quot;V&quot;, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;T&quot;a:
:formula_14
:formula_15

So the traveling clock K&#x27; will show an elapsed time of
:formula_16
which can be expressed as
:formula_17

whereas the stationary clock &quot;K&quot; shows an elapsed time of
:formula_18
which is, for every possible value of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;T&quot;a, &quot;T&quot;c and &quot;V&quot;, larger than the reading of clock K&#x27;:
:formula_19

==Difference in elapsed times: how to calculate it from the ship==
In the standard proper time formula
:formula_20

Δ&quot;τ&quot; represents the time of the non-inertial (travelling) observer K&#x27; as a function of the elapsed time Δ&quot;t&quot; of the inertial (stay-at-home) observer &quot;K&quot; for whom observer K&#x27; has velocity &quot;v&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) at time &quot;t&quot;.

To calculate the elapsed time Δ&quot;t&quot; of the inertial observer &quot;K&quot; as a function of the elapsed time Δ&quot;τ&quot; of the non-inertial observer K&#x27;, where only quantities measured by K&#x27; are accessible, the following formula can be used:
:formula_21
where &quot;a(τ)&quot; is the proper acceleration of the non-inertial observer K&#x27; as measured by himself (for instance with an accelerometer) during the whole round-trip. The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality can be used to show that the inequality follows from the previous expression:
:formula_22

Using the Dirac delta function to model the infinite acceleration phase in the standard case of the traveller having constant speed &quot;v&quot; during the outbound and the inbound trip, the formula produces the known result:
:formula_23

In the case where the accelerated observer K&#x27; departs from &quot;K&quot; with zero initial velocity, the general equation reduces to the simpler form:
:formula_24
which, in the &quot;smooth&quot; version of the twin paradox where the traveller has constant proper acceleration phases, successively given by &quot;a&quot;, −&quot;a&quot;, −&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, results in
:formula_25
where the convention &quot;c&quot; = 1 is used, in accordance with the above expression with acceleration phases and inertial (coasting) phases 

==A rotational version==
Twins Bob and Alice inhabit a space station in circular orbit around a massive body in space. Bob suits up and exits the station. While Alice remains inside the station, continuing to orbit with it as before, Bob uses a rocket propulsion system to cease orbiting and hover where he was. When the station completes an orbit and returns to Bob, he rejoins Alice. Alice is now younger than Bob. In addition to rotational acceleration, Bob must decelerate to become stationary and then accelerate again to match the orbital speed of the space station.

==No twin paradox in an absolute frame of reference==
Einstein&#x27;s conclusion of an actual difference in registered clock times (or aging) between reunited parties caused Paul Langevin to posit an actual, albeit experimentally indiscernible, absolute frame of reference:

In 1911, Langevin wrote: &quot;A uniform translation in the aether has no experimental sense. But because of this it should not be concluded, as has sometimes happened prematurely, that the concept of aether must be abandoned, that the aether is non-existent and inaccessible to experiment. Only a uniform velocity relative to it cannot be detected, but any change of velocity ... has an absolute sense.&quot;

In 1913, Henri Poincaré&#x27;s posthumous &quot;Last Essays&quot; were published and there he had restated his position: &quot;Today some physicists want to adopt a new convention. It is not that they are constrained to do so; they consider this new convention more convenient; that is all. And those who are not of this opinion can legitimately retain the old one.&quot;

In the relativity of Poincaré and Hendrik Lorentz, which assumes an absolute (though experimentally indiscernible) frame of reference, no paradox arises due to the fact that clock slowing (along with length contraction and velocity) is regarded as an actuality, hence the actual time differential between the reunited clocks.

In that interpretation, a party at rest with the totality of the cosmos (at rest with the barycenter of the universe, or at rest with a possible ether) would have the maximum rate of time-keeping and have non-contracted length. All the effects of Einstein&#x27;s special relativity (consistent light-speed measure, as well as symmetrically measured clock-slowing and length-contraction across inertial frames) fall into place.

That interpretation of relativity, which John A. Wheeler calls &quot;ether theory B (length contraction plus time contraction)&quot;, did not gain as much traction as Einstein&#x27;s, which simply disregarded any deeper reality behind the symmetrical measurements across inertial frames. There is no physical test which distinguishes one interpretation from the other.

In 2005, Robert B. Laughlin (Physics Nobel Laureate, Stanford University), wrote about the nature of space: &quot;It is ironic that Einstein&#x27;s most creative work, the general theory of relativity, should boil down to conceptualizing space as a medium when his original premise [in special relativity] was that no such medium existed ... The word &#x27;ether&#x27; has extremely negative connotations in theoretical physics because of its past association with opposition to relativity. This is unfortunate because, stripped of these connotations, it rather nicely captures the way most physicists actually think about the vacuum. ... Relativity actually says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of matter pervading the universe, only that any such matter must have relativistic symmetry (i.e., as measured).&quot;

In &quot;Special Relativity&quot; (1968), A. P. French wrote: &quot;Note, though, that we are appealing to the reality of A&#x27;s acceleration, and to the observability of the inertial forces associated with it. Would such effects as the twin paradox (specifically -- the time keeping differential between reunited clocks) exist if the framework of fixed stars and distant galaxies were not there? Most physicists would say no. Our ultimate definition of an inertial frame may indeed be that it is a frame having zero acceleration with respect to the matter of the universe at large.&quot;

<doc id="31430" wikidata="Q1045266" url="?curid=31430" title="Summary of Decameron tales">
<text>This article contains summaries and commentaries of the 100 stories within Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;The Decameron&quot;.

Each story of the &quot;Decameron&quot; begins with a short heading explaining the plot of the story. The 1903 translation headings are used in many of these summaries. Commentary on the tale itself follows.

Before beginning the story-telling sessions, the ten young Florentines, seven women and three men, referred to as the &quot;Brigata&quot;, gather at the Basilica di Santa Maria Novella and together decide to escape the Black Death by leaving the city to stay in a villa in the countryside. Each agrees to tell one story each day for ten days. The stories are told in the garden of the first villa that the company stays at, which is located a few miles outside the city.

==First day==
Under the rule of Pampinea, the first day of story-telling is open topic. Although there is no assigned theme of the tales this first day, six deal with one person censuring another and four are satires of the Catholic Church.

===First tale (I, 1)===
This story is told by Panfilo.

Ser Cepparello, commonly known as Ciapelletto, a notoriously wicked man, travels on business to Burgundy, a region he is unknown in, as a favor to Musciatto Franzesi. Once there, he soon falls terminally ill. The two Florentine brothers who were housing him during his stay bring a friar from a nearby convent to hear his confession and give him his last rites. Ciappelletto proceeds to tell the friar lies about his life that make him seem very pure, while pretending to cringe over venial sins. He is completely believed by the friar, who preaches a sermon on his life after he passes away. The townspeople who hear the sermon believe that he was a holy man and revere him as a saint long after Ciapelletto dies.

This first tale ridicules the then-current practice of the Roman Catholic Church of canonization by the people. The earliest source of this story is found in chapter twenty-three of Saint Sulpicius Severus&#x27;s biography of Saint Martin of Tours. The biography dates from around 400 AD.

===Second tale (I, 2)===
This story is told by Neifile.

Abraham, a Jew of Paris, is the friend of Giannotto di Civignì, who for years has urged him to become a Christian. One day Abraham departs for Rome, telling Giannotto that he wants to see the leaders of the Church – the pope and the curia – to decide whether or not he wants to convert. Giannotto, knowing of the debauched and decadent ways of the Roman clergy, fears Abraham will never want to convert after witnessing the corruption of the Church. But when Abraham returns, he converts, concluding that if Christianity can still spread even when its hierarchy is so corrupt, it must be the true word of God.

In this caustic anti-Catholic story, the Jewish character converts because he logically concludes that only a religion supported by God could prosper despite the corruption of its leadership. The earliest source of this tale is in Busone da Gubbio&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Avventuroso Siciliano&quot;, written in Italian in 1311.

===Third tale (I, 3)===
This story is told by Filomena.

Saladin, a powerful sultan, finds that his treasury is exhausted. Melchizedek, a Jew, has money enough to cover the shortfall, but Saladin believes he is too greedy to lend it fairly. Saladin tries to trick Melchizedek into giving offense (and justifying the seizure of his wealth) by asking him whether Judaism, Christianity, or Islam is the true Word of God. Melchizedek evades the trap by comparing it to the story of a merchant who had a precious ring and three virtuous sons. Having promised the ring—and with it, his estate—to all three, the king had two equally precious copies made and gave one ring to each son. Thus it could not be determined who was heir to the estate. Likewise, it cannot be determined which faith is the truth. Saladin appreciates Melchizedek&#x27;s wisdom and decides to be honest with him. In the end, Saladin gets his loan and repays it and Melchizedek gets Saladin&#x27;s respect and gifts of praise for his intelligence.

Unlike other Medieval and Renaissance authors, Boccaccio treats Jewish people with respect, as this story portrays the main character as wise and in a positive light. Boccaccio may have had contact with Jews while living in Naples as a young man. The oldest source is found in a French work by Stephen of Bourbon called &quot;The Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit&quot;. However, a slightly younger (c. 1321) Italian story in Bosone da Gubbio&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;avventuroso siciliano&quot; was Boccaccio&#x27;s probable source. This tale was especially popular in the Renaissance and can be found in many versions all over Europe. It is also referred to as &quot;The Tale of the Three Rings&quot; and &quot;The Legend of the Three Rings&quot; and, according to Carlo Ginzburg, was quoted in the heresy trial of the Italian miller Menocchio.

The &quot;Parable of the Rings&quot; is also found in Lessing&#x27;s play &quot;Nathan the Wise&quot;.

===Fourth tale (I, 4)===
Dioneo, who has acquired the reputation of the most bawdy of the storytellers, narrates this tale.

A young monk seduces a young woman and is secretly observed by an elder abbot. Realizing he has been seen, he leaves her on pretense of finishing a task. He gives the key to his room to the abbot, who then goes to seduce the girl himself. The monk hides, watches all of this, and uses the knowledge to avoid punishment. The monk and the abbot quickly rush the woman out of the monastery but often bring her back in.

The earliest surviving source for this anti-clerical tale is found in &quot;Cento Novelle Antiche&quot;, an Italian compilation of short stories from the end of the 13th century. Boccaccio could have possibly also taken the tale from a French &quot;fabliau&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Evesque qui benit sa maitresse&quot; (&quot;The bishop who blesses his mistress&quot;).

===Fifth tale (I, 5)===
Fiammetta tells this story.

The Marquis of Montferrat, on his way to the Crusades, tells King Phillip of France of his happy marriage to the beautiful Marchioness. King Phillip is entranced with the Marquis&#x27;s description of her and makes an excuse to detour to Montferrat so he can seduce her. He sends a courier ahead to tell the Marchioness that he is arriving soon and would like to be hosted and dine in the estate. The Marchioness devises a plan to keep King Phillip from her. When he arrives, she throws a banquet for King Phillip composed entirely of hens. King Phillip asks whether there are any roosters. The Marchioness replies that there aren&#x27;t but hens and women are the same everywhere. King Phillip, shocked by her wit and unwillingness, finishes the meal and quickly returns to the Crusade. 

The story originates from &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;.

===Sixth tale (I, 6)===
Emilia narrates yet another anti-clerical tale, the fourth of the day so far.

A well-off man, becoming rather tipsy, rashly says that his wine is &quot;good enough for Christ himself&quot;. The greedy inquisitor hears this and prosecutes him. After some time for attending to penances imposed upon him, he hears at a mass that &quot;you shall receive an hundredfold and shall possess eternal life&quot;. He returns to the inquisitor and marks large amounts of &quot;swill&quot; being given to the poor. He commiserates with the inquisitor saying that if he receives 100 times as much in the afterlife, he would be drowned. This incenses the inquisitor, but also embarrasses him for his gluttony.

Some commentators have identified the inquisitor as Pietro dell&#x27;Aquila, the inquisitor of Florence in 1345.

===Seventh tale (I, 7)===

Filostrato tells this tale.

Bergamino, an entertainer widely known for his wit and oratory, delicately censures a sudden excess of greed in Messer Cangrande della Scala by telling a story about Primasso (probably Hugh Primas) and the Abbot of Cluny.

Cangrande I della Scala is best known as Dante&#x27;s benefactor, whom Dante praises in the &quot;Paradiso&quot; section of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, xvii, 68.

===Eighth tale (I, 8)===
Lauretta, inspired by the theme of the previous tale, narrates this one. 

Messer Ermino de&#x27; Grimaldi is one of the richest men in Genoa and one of the stingiest in the world. A jester gifted with great wit and sophistication comes to the city and associates with the wealthy men there. He hears of Grimaldi&#x27;s miserliness and uses his wit to make Grimaldi see himself as others see him.

===Ninth tale (I, 9)===
Elissa continues the theme of righteous censure.

After making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, a Gascon lady is brutally assaulted by bandits on Cyprus. Through her wit, she rouses the first &quot;King&quot; of Cyprus out of lethargy and inspires him to take responsibility for the welfare of his realm.

Boccaccio took this story directly from &quot;Cento Novelle Antiche&quot;, in which the male character is also the King of Cyprus.

===Tenth tale (I, 10)===
Pampinea narrates the last tale of the day.

Master Alberto da Bologna is an accomplished 70-year-old physician who fell in love with a much younger widow he saw at an entertainment. Making his feelings indirectly obvious, the woman and her friends belittle him. Using his wit, he lures her into saying something that compromises her honor.

==Second day==
Filomena reigns during the second day and assigns the topic to the storytellers: Misadventures that suddenly end happily.

===First tale (II, 1)===
Martellino pretends to be a paralytic, and makes it appear as if he were cured by being placed upon the body of St. Arrigo. His trick is detected; he is beaten and arrested, and is in peril of hanging, but finally escapes.

Neifile narrates this tale, which, like I, 1, ridicules the Catholic tradition of discerning the Saints. Although there is no known earlier source for this tale, the part where Martellino&#x27;s friends are carrying him in on a cot references Mark 2:2 and Luke 5:19.

===Second tale (II, 2)===
Rinaldo d&#x27;Asti is robbed, arrives at Castle Guglielmo, and is entertained by a widow lady; his property is restored to him, the robbers caught and hanged, and he returns home safe and sound.

This story seems to originate in the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;, a work originally composed in Sanskrit, and was already 1,500 years old by the time Boccaccio retold it. Filostrato tells this version of the tale.

===Third tale (II, 3)===
Three young men squander their substance and are reduced to poverty. Their nephew, returning home a desperate man, falls in love with a woman disguised as an abbot, whom he discovers to be the daughter of the King of England. She marries him, and he retrieves the losses and reestablishes the fortune of his uncles.

Pampinea narrates this tale of which no earlier version is known.

===Fourth tale (II, 4)===
Landolfo Ruffolo is reduced to poverty, turns corsair, is captured by Genoese, is shipwrecked, escapes on a chest full of jewels, and, being cast ashore at Corfu, is hospitably entertained by a woman, and returns home wealthy.

Lauretta narrates.

===Fifth tale (II, 5)===
Andreuccio da Perugia comes to Naples to buy horses, meets with three serious adventures in one night, comes safe out of them all, and returns home with a ruby.

Fiammetta tells this story which is actually a combination of two earlier tales. The beginning of the tale is first recorded in about 1228 by Courtois d&#x27;Arrass in his &quot;Boivin de Provins&quot;. The portion of Andreuccio being trapped in the tomb of the archbishop and how he escapes comes from the &quot;Ephesian Tale&quot; by Xenophon of Ephesus, which was written in about 150 AD. That portion of the tale is so memorable that it was still being told as a true story in the cities and countryside of Europe in the early 20th century.

===Sixth tale (II, 6)===
Madam Beritola loses two sons, is found with two goats on an island, goes thence to Lunigiana, where one of her sons takes service with her master, and lies with his daughter, for which he is put in prison. Sicily rebels against King Charles, the son is recognized by the mother, marries the master&#x27;s daughter, and, his brother being discovered, is reinstated in great honor.

Emilia tells this story. It resembles the story of Sir Isumbras, which dates from before 1320 and was very popular in medieval England.

===Seventh tale (II, 7)===
The Sultan of Babylon sends one of his daughters, Alatiel, overseas to be married to the King of Algarve. By diverse adventures she comes into the hands of nine men in varied places within four years. At last she is restored to her father, whom she quits again in the guise of a virgin to be married to the King of Algarve, as it was at first intended.

This scandalous tale is told by Panfilo. There is no agreement on its origin, probably because of the very eclectic nature of the plot, which may have been pieced together from various sources by Boccaccio. Some suggest &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; or the &quot;Ephesian Tale&quot; may have given some inspiration to the author for this tale, but not enough that either could definitely be called a source.

===Eighth tale (II, 8)===
The Count of Antwerp, laboring under a false accusation, goes into exile. He leaves his two children in different places in England, and takes service in Ireland. Returning to England an unknown man, he finds his son and daughter prosperous. He serves as a groom in the army of the King of France; his innocence is established, and he is restored to his former honors.

Elissa narrates this story, which shares its theme of a woman&#x27;s vengeance for being spurned with many ancient stories. However, a direct source may be the real-life story of Pierre de La Broce and Lady of Brabant. Dante writes about the soul of the former in &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, vi. A literary source may have been a Provençal romance written in 1318 by Arnaud Vidal de Castelnaudary called &quot;Guillaume de la Barre&quot;. However, the theme is so common that pinning down one main source is very difficult.

===Ninth tale (II, 9)===
Bernabò of Genoa, deceived by Ambrogiuolo, loses his money and commands his innocent wife to be put to death. She escapes, habits herself as a man, and serves the Sultan. She discovers the deceiver, and brings Bernabò to Alexandria, where the deceiver is punished. She then resumes the garb of a woman, and with her husband returns wealthy to Genoa.

Filomena tells this story, which is best known to English readers through Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. The oldest known version of this story is a French romance from the 13th century called &quot;Roman de la Violette ou de Gerard de Nevers&quot; by Gilbert de Montreuil.

===Tenth tale (II, 10)===
Paganino da Monaco carries off the wife of Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica, who, having learned where she is, goes to Paganino and in a friendly manner asks him to restore her. He consents, provided she be willing. She refuses to go back with her husband. Messer Ricciardo dies, and she marries Paganino.

In the last tale of the second day Dioneo begins his pattern of telling the last tale of the day, which he will continue until the end of the &quot;Decameron&quot;. The moral of the story – that a young woman should not marry an old man – is common in late medieval vernacular literature.

==Third day==

Neifile reigns during the third day. In these stories a person either has painfully acquired something or has lost it and then regained it.

===First tale (III, 1)===
Masetto da Lamporecchio feigns to be mute, and obtains a gardener&#x27;s place at a convent of women, who with one accord make haste to lie with him.

Filostrato&#x27;s tale of a man&#x27;s devices that he employs to enjoy the physical company of a convent of nuns was also in &quot;Cento Novelle Antiche&quot; from the 13th century.

===Second tale (III, 2)===
A groom lies with the wife of King Agilulf, who learns the fact, keeps his own counsel, finds out the groom and shears him. The shorn shears all his fellows and so comes safe out of the scrape.

Pampinea&#x27;s clever tale originates in either the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;, a Sanskrit story from the 4th century AD, or the &quot;Histories&quot; of Herodotus. However, Boccaccio&#x27;s version is unique in that the husband in the tale preserves both his honor and that of his wife, and emphasis on &quot;keeping up appearances&quot; that is distinct of the Renaissance merchant class, to which Boccaccio belonged.

===Third tale (III, 3)===
A married woman falls in love with a man. Unable to approach him directly, she complains to his friend, a friar, that he is pestering her, and asks him to tell him to stop. In the end, she accuses him of climbing up to her window while her husband is out of town, giving him the hint that he is safe to visit her.

Filomena narrates this story.

===Fourth tale (III, 4)===
Dom Felice instructs Friar Puccio how to attain blessedness by doing a penance. Friar Puccio does the penance, and meanwhile Dom Felice has a good time with Friar Puccio&#x27;s wife.

Panfilo narrates.

===Fifth tale (III, 5)===
Zima gives a palfrey to Messer Francesco Vergellesi, who in return suffers him to speak with his wife. She keeps silence, he answers in her stead, and the sequel is in accordance with his answer.

This tale is originally found in &quot;Hitopadesha&quot;, a Sanskrit collection of tales. Boccaccio, though, may have directly taken the tale from &quot;The Seven Wise Masters&quot;, which, although oriental in origin, was widely circulating in Latin at the time the &quot;Decameron&quot; was written. Elissa narrates.

===Sixth tale (III, 6)===
Ricciardo Minutolo loves the wife of Filippello Fighinolfi, and knowing her to be jealous, makes her believe that his own wife is to meet Filippello at a Turkish bath house on the ensuing day; whereby she is induced to go thither, where, thinking to have been with her husband, she discovers that she has tarried with Ricciardo.

Fiammetta tells this tale, which like the previous one, was taken from &quot;The Seven Wise Masters&quot;.

===Seventh tale (III, 7)===
Tedaldo, being in disfavour with his lady, departs from Florence. He returns after a while in the guise of a pilgrim, speaks with his lady, and makes her sensible of her fault. Her husband, convicted of slaying him, he delivers from peril of death, reconciles him with his brothers, and thereafter discreetly enjoys his lady.

Emilia narrates this tale, which has no known previous version.

===Eighth tale (III, 8)===
Ferondo, having taken a certain powder, is interred for dead; is disinterred by the abbot, who enjoys his wife; is put in prison and taught to believe that he is in purgatory; is then resuscitated, and rears as his own a boy begotten by the abbot upon his wife.

Lauretta&#x27;s tale of the elaborate ruses that an abbot undertakes to enjoy Ferondo&#x27;s wife was probably taken by Boccaccio from a French fabliau by Jean de Boves called . Boccaccio not only capitalizes on the tale to poke fun at the clerics of his day, but also at the simple-mindedness of some of his countrymen.

===Ninth tale (III, 9)===
Gillette of Narbonne cures the King of France of a fistula, craves for spouse Bertrand de Roussillon, who marries her against his will, and hies him in despite to Florence, where, as he courts a young woman, Gillette lies with him in her stead, and has two sons by him; for which cause he afterwards takes her into favour and entreats her as his wife.

Neifile narrates this tale, which was written first by the Sanskrit dramatist and poet Kālidāsa in his &quot;The Recognition of Śakuntalā&quot;. The time of Kālidāsa&#x27;s life is uncertain, but some scholars think that he lived in the 5th century. Boccaccio may have taken the tale from an 11th-century French version. This tale is the basis for Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;.

===Tenth tale (III, 10)===
Alibech, a non-Christian girl of Gafsa, turns hermit, and is taught by Rustico, a monk, how the Devil is put in hell. She is afterwards conveyed thence, and becomes the wife of Neerbale.

Dioneo narrates what is by far the most obscene and bawdy tale in the &quot;Decameron&quot;. Alibech, a naive young woman, wanders into the desert in an attempt to become closer to God. She happens upon the monk Rustico, and he deflowers her under the pretense of teaching her how to better please God. Alibech becomes more enthusiastic about &quot;putting the Devil back into Hell&quot; (sexual intercourse) than Rustico, almost to the point of his ruin. Meanwhile, her family and family home are incinerated, leaving her the only heir. Neerbale kidnaps her, much to Rustico&#x27;s relief and Alibech&#x27;s displeasure, and Alibech is made to marry Neerbale. The night before the wedding, she is questioned by other women as to how Alibech served God in the desert, and upon explaining to her ladies how the Devil is put back into Hell, is informed that Neerbale will surely know how to help her serve God once more.

Because of its &quot;graphic&quot; nature, this tale has at times been translated incompletely, as in John Payne&#x27;s translation, where Alibech&#x27;s sexual awakening is left untranslated and is accompanied with this footnote: &quot;The translators regret that the disuse into which magic has fallen, makes it impossible to render the technicalities of that mysterious art into tolerable English; they have therefore found it necessary to insert several passages in the original Italian.&quot; No known earlier versions of it exist.

==Fourth day==
Boccaccio begins this day with a defense of his work as it is thus far completed. Although he says that portions of the earlier days were circulating among the literate citizens of Tuscany while the work was in progress, this is doubtful. Instead, Boccaccio is probably just shooting down potential detractors. The reader must remember that vernacular fictional prose was not a respected genre in 14th century Italy and some of the criticisms Boccaccio combats in the introduction to the fourth day were common attitudes towards the genre. Others, however, were specific to the &quot;Decameron&quot; itself.

One criticism of the latter type was that it was not healthy for a man of Boccaccio&#x27;s age – approximately 38 – to associate with young ladies, to whom the work is supposedly written. To defend against this criticism, Boccaccio tells a story explaining how natural it is for a man to enjoy a woman&#x27;s company. In this story, Filipo Balducci is a hermit living with his son on Mount Asinaio after the death of his wife and travels occasionally to Florence for supplies. One day his son – now eighteen and having never before left the mountain – accompanies him because Filipo is too infirm to make the journey alone. While there the son becomes fascinated with women, even though he had never seen one before and Filipo regrets ever bringing his son to Florence.

This is commonly referred to as the 101st story of the &quot;Decameron&quot;. The story originates in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, a Sanskrit epic from the 4th century BCE. The tale was quite common during the medieval era, appearing in &quot;Barlaam and Josaphat&quot; (written in the 8th century), an exemplum of Jacques de Vitry (13th century) and &quot;Cento Novelle Antiche&quot; (also 13th century), &quot;The Seven Wise Masters&quot;, and Italian collection of fables called &quot;Fiore di virtù&quot; (14th century), Odo of Shirton&#x27;s &quot;De heremita iuvene&quot; (12th century), and a French fabliau (13th century). The last two are the most probable sources for Boccaccio because in them the father refers to the women as &quot;geese&quot;, whereas in the earlier versions he calls them &quot;demons&quot; who tempt the souls of men.

Filostrato reigns during the fourth day, in which the storytellers tell tales of lovers whose relationship ends in disaster. This is the first day a male storyteller reigns.

===First tale (IV, 1)===
Tancredi, Prince of Salerno and father of Ghismonda, slays his daughter&#x27;s lover, Guiscardo, and sends her his heart in a golden cup: Ghismonda, the daughter, pours upon it a poisonous distillation, which she drinks and dies.

Fiammetta narrates this tale, whose earliest source is a French manuscript written by a man named Thomas. However, it is referred to in the early 12th century of Tristan and Iseult.

===Second tale (IV, 2)===

Friar Alberto deceives a woman into believing that the Archangel Gabriel is in love with her. As an excuse to sleep with her, Friar Alberto tells her that Gabriel can enter his body. Afterward, for fear of her kinsmen, he flings himself out of her window and finds shelter in the house of a poor man. The next day the poor man leads him in the guise of a wild man into the piazza, where, being recognized, he is apprehended by his fellow friars and imprisoned.

Pampinea tells the second tale of the day, which is a very ancient tale. Supposedly it comes from an episode in the life of Alexander the Great. Other notable previous recordings of it include Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot;, the &quot;Pantschantantra&quot;, and &quot;One Thousand and One Arabian Nights&quot;.

===Third tale (IV, 3)===
Three young men love three sisters, and flee with them to Crete. The eldest of the sisters slays her lover for jealousy. The second saves the life of the first by yielding herself to the Duke of Crete. Her lover slays her, and makes off with the first: the third sister and her lover are charged with the murder, are arrested and confess the crime. They escape death by bribing the guards, flee destitute to Rhodes, and die in destitution there.

Lauretta narrates this story.

===Fourth tale (IV, 4)===
Gerbino, in breach of the plighted faith of his grandfather, King William, attacks a ship of the King of Tunis to rescue the latter&#x27;s daughter. She is killed by those aboard the ship, Gerbino slays them, and afterward he is beheaded.

There is no known source for Elissa&#x27;s tale.

===Fifth tale (IV, 5)===

Lisabetta&#x27;s brothers slay her lover. He appears to her in a dream and shows her where he is buried. She disinters the head and sets it in a pot of basil, whereon she daily weeps a great while. Her brothers take the pot from her and she dies shortly after.

Filomena tells this story, one of the most famous in the &quot;Decameron&quot;, and the basis of John Keats&#x27; narrative poem &quot;Isabella, or the Pot of Basil&quot;.

===Sixth tale (IV, 6)===
Andreuola loves Gabriotto: she tells him a dream that she has had; he tells her a dream of his own, and dies suddenly in her arms. While she and her maidservant are carrying his corpse to his house, they are taken by the Signory. She tells how the matter stands, is threatened with violence by the &quot;podestà&quot;, but will not brook it. Her father hears how she is bested; and, her innocence being established, causes her to be set at large; but she, being minded to tarry no longer in the world, becomes a nun.

Panfilo, the first male storyteller of the day to narrate, tells this tale.

===Seventh tale (IV, 7)===
Simona loves Pasquino; they are together in a garden; Pasquino rubs a leaf of sage against his teeth, and dies; Simona is arrested, and, with intent to show the judge how Pasquino died, rubs one of the leaves of the same plant against her teeth, and likewise dies.

Emilia narrates.

===Eighth tale (IV, 8)===
Girolamo loves Salvestra: yielding to his mother&#x27;s prayers he goes to Paris; he returns to find Salvestra married; he enters her house by stealth, lays himself by her side, and dies; he is borne to the church, where Salvestra lays herself by his side, and dies.

Neifile narrates.

===Ninth tale (IV, 9)===
Sieur Guillaume de Roussillon slays his wife&#x27;s lover, Sieur Guillaume de Cabestaing, and gives her his heart to eat. When she finds out, she throws herself from a high window, dies, and is buried with her lover.

Filostrato tells this story, which has so many similarities with tale IV, 1 that both tales could have shared sources.

===Tenth tale (IV, 10)===
The wife of a leech, deeming her lover, who has taken an opiate, to be dead, puts him in a chest, which, with him therein, two usurers carry off to their house. He comes to himself, and is taken for a thief; but, the lady&#x27;s maid giving the Signory to understand that she had put him in the chest which the usurers stole, he escapes the gallows, and the usurers are fined for the theft of the chest.

Dioneo, whose stories are exempt from being governed by the theme of each day, tells this tale of Buddhist origin.

==Fifth day==
During the fifth day Fiammetta, whose name means small flame, sets the theme of tales where lovers pass through disasters before having their love end in good fortune.

===First tale (V, 1)===

Cimon, by loving, waxes wise, wins his wife Iphigenia by capture on the high seas, and is imprisoned at Rhodes. He is freed by Lysimachus; and the two capture Cassandra and recapture Iphigenia in the hour of their marriage. They flee with their ladies to Crete, and having there married them, are brought back to their homes.

Like the tale in the introduction to the fourth day, Panfilo&#x27;s tale seems to derive from the story of &quot;Barlaam and Josaphat&quot;.

===Second tale (V, 2)===
Gostanza loves Martuccio Gomito and after hearing that he is dead, gives way to despair, and hides her alone aboard a boat, which is wafted by the wind to Susa. She finds him alive in Tunis, and makes herself known to him. Having gained high place in the king&#x27;s favour by way of his council, he marries Gostanza and returns with her to Lipari.

Emilia narrates this tale, one part of which (the motif of using extra fine bow strings) supposedly is based on a real event, according to a chronicle by Giovanni Villani. In Villani&#x27;s story&#x27;s Emperor Kassan of the Tartars thus defeated the Sultan of Egypt in 1299.

===Third tale (V, 3)===
Pietro Boccamazza runs away with Agnolella and encounters a gang of robbers. The girl takes refuge in the woods and is guided to a castle. Pietro is taken but escapes from the robbers. After some adventures, he arrives at the castle and marries Agnolella; they return to Rome. 

Elissa tells this tale.

===Fourth tale (V, 4)===
Ricciardo Manardi is found by Messer Lizio da Valbona after an affair with his daughter, whom he marries, and remains at peace with her father.

Filostrato narrates this tale, which some claim bears a resemblance to &quot;Lai du Laustic&quot; by the famed late 12th-century poet Marie de France. However, the resemblance is not strong and the story may be of either Boccaccio&#x27;s invention or may come from oral tradition.

===Fifth tale (V, 5)===
Guidotto da Cremona dies leaving a girl to Giacomino da Pavia. She has two lovers in Faenza, Giannole di Severino and Minghino di Mingole, who fight about her. She is discovered to be Giannole&#x27;s sister, and is given to Minghino to marry.

Neifile tells this story which has no previous literary recording.

===Sixth tale (V, 6)===
Gianni di Procida, being found with a damsel that he loves, and who had been given to King Frederick, is bound with her to a stake, so to be burned. He is recognized by Ruggieri dell&#x27;Oria, is freed, and marries her.

Pampinea narrates this tale.

===Seventh tale (V, 7)===
Teodoro is sold to Messer Amerigo as a slave when still a child. He is christened and brought up together with Violente, the daughter of his master. The two fall in love and Violente eventually bears a boy. Threatened with death by her outraged father she names the father who is sentenced to the gallows. Amerigo orders his daughter to choose between knife or poison and the child to be killed. Traveling Armenian dignitaries recognize the condemned by a strawberry shaped birth mark. Thus his life is saved as well as Violente&#x27;s in the last minute. The couple get the blessing of their father, marry and live a happy life until old age.

Lauretta narrates.

===Eighth tale (V, 8)===
In his love for a young lady of the Traversari family, Nastagio degli Onesti squanders his wealth without being loved in return. He is entreated by his friends to leave the city, and goes away to Chiassi, where he sees a female ghost cursed to be hunted down and killed by a horseman and devoured by a pack of hounds every week. He finds out that the cursed horseman was in a similar situation to his own, and committed suicide while the woman died afterwards unrepentant for her role in his death. Nastagio then invites his kinfolk and the lady he loves to a banquet at this same place, so the ghost woman is torn to pieces before the eyes of his beloved, who, fearing a similar fate, accepts Nastagio as her husband.

Filomena&#x27;s tale may originate from the early 13th century &quot;Chronicle of Helinandus&quot;. However, the tale was a widespread one and Boccaccio could have taken it from any number of sources or even oral tradition.

===Ninth tale (V, 9)===
Federigo degli Alberighi, who loves but is not loved in return, spends all the money he has in courtship and is left with only a falcon, which, since he has nothing else to give her, he offers to his lady to eat when she visits his home; then she, learning of this, changes her mind, takes him for her husband, and makes him rich.

Fiammetta&#x27;s tale (she is the speaker in this story, contrary to what a couple of incorrect sources may say) is also told about the legendary Hatim Tai, who lived in the 6th century and sacrificed his favorite horse to provide a meal for the ambassador of the Greek Emperor. This earliest version of the tale is of Persian origin.

===Tenth tale (V, 10)===
Pietro di Vinciolo goes from home to eat, and his wife brings a boy into the house to bear her company. Pietro returns, and she hides her lover under a hen-coop. Pietro explains that in the house of Ercolano, with whom he was to have supped, there was discovered a young man bestowed there by Ercolano&#x27;s wife. The lady censures Ercolano&#x27;s wife, but unluckily an ass treads on the fingers of the boy that is hidden under the hen-coop, so that he cries out in pain. Pietro runs to the place, sees him, and apprehends the trick played on him by his wife, which nevertheless he finally condones, because he is not himself free from blame.

As is custom among the ten storytellers, Dioneo tells the last and most bawdy tale of the day. This story is taken from Lucius Apuleius&#x27;s 2nd-century &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;.

==Sixth day==
During the sixth day of storytelling, Elissa is queen of the &quot;brigata&quot; and chooses for the theme stories in which a character avoids attack or embarrassment through a clever remark.

Many stories in the sixth day do not have previous versions. Boccaccio may have invented many of them himself. He certainly was clever enough to have created the situations and the retorts.

===First tale (VI, 1)===
A knight offers to carry Madonna Oretta on horseback and tell her a story, but he tells it so badly that she begs him to let her dismount.

Filomena narrates this tale, which many see as revealing Boccaccio&#x27;s opinion of what makes a good or bad storyteller, just as portions of &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; contain Shakespeare&#x27;s opinion of what makes a good or bad actor.

===Second tale (VI, 2)===
Cisti, a baker, by an apt speech gives Messer Geri Spina to know that he has by inadvertence asked that of him which he should not.

Pampinea narrates.

===Third tale (VI, 3)===
Monna Nonna de&#x27; Pulci by a ready retort silences the scarce seemly jesting of the Bishop of Florence.

Lauretta narrates.

===Fourth tale (VI, 4)===
Chichibio, cook to Currado Gianfigliazzi, owes his safety to a ready answer, whereby he converts Currado&#x27;s wrath into laughter, and evades the evil fate with which Currado had threatened him.

Neifile narrates.

===Fifth tale (VI, 5)===

Messer Forese da Rabatta, a knowledgeable jurist, and Master Giotto, a painter, make fun of each other&#x27;s poor appearance while returning from Mugello.

Panfilo narrates this tale.

===Sixth tale (VI, 6)===
Michele Scalza proves to certain young men that the Baronci are the best gentlemen in the world and the Maremma, and wins a supper.

Fiammetta narrates.

===Seventh tale (VI, 7)===
Madonna Filippa, being found by her husband with her lover, is cited before the court under a law that makes no distinction between infidelity and prostitution, punishing both by death by burning. During examination, she says that she has never denied her husband&#x27;s sexual advances, which he confirms. She then asks, since he has gotten as much of her as he desires, what she should do with the surplus. This amuses the court, who acquit her and change the law to distinguish between adultery and prostitution.

Filostrato narrates this tale.

===Eighth tale (VI, 8)===
Fresco admonishes his niece not to look at herself in the glass, if it is, as she says, grievous to her to see nasty folk.

Emilia narrates. Admonitions against the sin of vanity were common in the medieval era.

===Ninth tale (VI, 9)===
Guido Cavalcanti by a quip neatly rebukes certain Florentine gentlemen who had taken advantage of him.

Elissa narrates.

===Tenth tale (VI, 10)===

Friar Cipolla promises to show certain country-folk a feather of the Angel Gabriel, in lieu of which he finds coals, which he claims are those with which Saint Lawrence was roasted.

Dioneo narrates this story which mocks the worship of relics. The story originates in the Sanskrit collection of stories called &quot;Canthamanchari&quot;. This story—a classic from the collection—takes place in Certaldo, Boccaccio&#x27;s hometown (and the location where he would later die). Friar Cipolla&#x27;s name means &quot;Brother Onion,&quot; and Certaldo was famous in that era for its onions. In the story one can sense a certain love on Boccaccio&#x27;s part for the people of Certaldo, even while he is mocking them.

==Seventh day==
During the seventh day Dioneo serves as king of the &quot;brigata&quot; and sets the theme for the stories: tales in which wives play tricks on their husbands.

===First tale (VII, 1)===
Gianni Lotteringhi hears a knocking at his door at night: he awakens his wife, who persuades him that it is a werewolf, which they fall to exorcising with a prayer; whereupon the knocking ceases.

Emilia tells the first tale of the day. In it Boccaccio states that he heard it from an old woman who claimed it was a true story and heard it as a child. Although we will never know if Boccaccio really did hear the story from an old woman or not (it is possible), the story is certainly not true. It resembles an earlier French &quot;fabliau&quot; by Pierre Anfons called &quot;Le revenant&quot;. Also, the English description of the creature as a &quot;werewolf&quot; is improper. The Italian word, &quot;&quot;, describes a supernatural cat monkey creature or quite simply a ghost.

===Second tale (VII, 2)===
Her husband returning home, Peronella hides her lover in a barrel; which, being sold by her husband, she claims she had already sold to someone currently examining it from the inside to see if it is sound. The lover jumps out, and explains that the barrel is not clean enough and that it must be cleaned properly for the purchase to take place. The husband thus cleans it, his head inside the barrel; the wife too, sticks her head in there, instructing. Meanwhile the lover has his way with the wife from behind, and afterwards has the husband carry the barrel to his house.

Filostrato narrates this tale, which Boccaccio certainly took from Apuleius&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;, the same source as tale V, 10.

===Third tale (VII, 3)===
Friar Rinaldo lies with his godchild&#x27;s mother: her husband finds him in the room with her; and they make him believe that he was curing his godson of worms by a charm.

Elissa tells this tale, which has so many similar versions in French, Italian, and Latin, that it is impossible to identify one as a potential source for this one. The relationship between a child&#x27;s godparent and biological parent was considered so sacred at the time that intercourse between them was considered incest. This belief is ridiculed by Boccaccio in a later tale (VII, 10).

===Fourth tale (VII, 4)===
Tofano one night locks his wife out of the house. Finding that she cannot convince him to let her in, she pretends to throw herself into a well, throwing a large stone inside. Tofano comes out of the house, and runs to the spot, and she goes into the house, locks him out, and hurls abuse at him from within.

Lauretta is the narrator of this very old tale. The earliest form of it is found in the Sanskrit &quot;Śukasaptati&quot; (&quot;The Parrot&#x27;s Seventy Tales&quot;), which was compiled in the 6th century AD. A later version from the 11th century is found in &quot;Disciplina Clericalis&quot;, which was written in Latin by Petrus Alphonsi, a Jewish convert to Christianity. The tale was very popular and appears in many vernacular languages of the era.

===Fifth tale (VII, 5)===
A jealous husband disguises himself as a priest, and hears his own wife&#x27;s confession: she tells him that she loves a priest, who comes to her every night. The husband posts himself at the door to watch for the priest, and meanwhile the lady brings her lover in by the roof, and tarries with him.

Fiammetta&#x27;s tale most likely originates from a French fabliau or a possibly Provençal romance, both of which were recorded not too long before the &quot;Decameron&quot; was written.

===Sixth tale (VII, 6)===
Madonna Isabella has with her Leonetto, her accepted lover, when she is surprised by Messer Lambertuccio, by whom she is beloved: her husband coming home about the same time, she sends Messer Lambertuccio forth of the house drawn sword in hand, and the husband afterwards escorts Leonetto home.

Pampinea narrates this version of a common medieval tale which originates from the &quot;Hitopadesha&quot; of India. Later versions pass the tale into Persian, French, Latin (in &quot;The Seven Wise Masters&quot;), and Hebrew.

===Seventh tale (VII, 7)===
Lodovico tells Madonna Beatrice the love that he has for her. She sends Egano, her husband, into a garden disguised as herself, and lies with Lodovico. Afterwards, being risen, Lodovico goes to the garden and cudgels Egano.

Filomena&#x27;s humorous tale probably derives from an earlier French fabliau.

===Eighth tale (VII, 8)===
A husband grows jealous of his wife, and discovers that she has warning of her lover&#x27;s approach by a piece of pack-thread, which she ties to her great toe at nights. While he is pursuing her lover, she puts another woman in bed in her place. The husband, finding her there, beats her, and cuts off her hair. He then goes and calls his wife&#x27;s brothers, who, holding his accusation to be false, subject him to a torrent of abuse.

Neifile tells this tale. It comes originally from the &quot;Pantschatantra&quot; and later forms part of other tale collections in Sanskrit, Arabic, French, and Persian. Boccaccio probably used a French version of the tale.

===Ninth tale (VII, 9)===
Lydia, wife of Nicostratus, loves Pyrrhus, who to assure himself thereof, asks three things of her, all of which she does, and therewithal enjoys him in presence of Nicostratus, and makes Nicostratus believe that what he saw was not real.

Panfilo narrates. Boccaccio combined two earlier folk tales into one to create this story. The test of fidelity is previously recorded in French (a &quot;fabliau&quot;) and Latin (&quot;Lidia&quot;, an elegiac comedy), but comes originally from India or Persia. The story of the pear tree, best known to English-speaking readers from &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, also originates from Persia in the &quot;Bahar-Danush&quot;, in which the husband climbs a date tree instead of a pear tree. The story could have arrived in Europe through the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, or perhaps the version in book VI of the &quot;Masnavi&quot; by Rumi.

===Tenth tale (VII, 10)===

Two Sienese men love a lady, one of them being her child&#x27;s godfather: the godfather dies, having promised his comrade to return to him from the other world; which he does, and tells him what sort of life is led there.

As usual, Dioneo narrates the last tale of the day. See the commentary for VII, 3 for information about the relation between a child&#x27;s parent and godparent.

==Eighth day==
Lauretta reigns during the eighth day of storytelling. During this day the members of the group tell stories of tricks women play on men or that men play on women.

===First tale (VIII, 1)===
Gulfardo borrows money from Guasparruolo, which he has agreed to give Guasparruolo&#x27;s wife, that he may lie with her. He gives the money to her, and in her presence tells Guasparruolo that he has done so, and she acknowledges that it is true.

Neifile narrates. This tale (and the next one) comes from a 13th-century French fabliau by Eustache d&#x27;Amiens. English speakers know it best from Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Shipman&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Chaucer borrowed from the same fabliau as Boccaccio did.

===Second tale (VIII, 2)===
The priest of Varlungo lies with Monna Belcolore: he leaves with her his cloak by way of pledge, and receives from her a mortar. He returns the mortar, and demands of her the cloak that he had left in pledge, which the good lady returns him with a gibe.

Panfilo tells this story, which can be considered a variation of VIII, 1.

===Third tale (VIII, 3)===
Calandrino, Bruno and Buffalmacco go in quest of the heliotrope (bloodstone) beside the Mugnone. Thinking to have found it, Calandrino gets him home laden with stones. His wife chides him: whereat he waxes wroth, beats her, and tells his comrades what they know better than he.

Elissa narrates this tale, the first in which Bruno and Buffalmacco appear. The two were early Renaissance Italian painters. However, both are known far better for their love of practical jokes than for their artistic work. Boccaccio probably invented this tale himself, though, and used well known jokers as characters.

===Fourth tale (VIII, 4)===
The rector of Fiesole loves a widow lady, by whom he is not loved and, in attempting to lie with her, is tricked by the lady to have sex with her maid, with whom the lady&#x27;s brothers cause him to be found by his Bishop.

Emilia&#x27;s tale originates from the fabliau &quot;Le Prestre et Alison&quot; by Guillaume Le Normand.

===Fifth tale (VIII, 5)===

Three young men pull down the breeches of a judge from the Marches, while he is administering justice on the bench.

Filostrato narrates.

===Sixth tale (VIII, 6)===
Bruno and Buffalmacco steal a pig from Calandrino, and induce him to deduce its recovery by means of pills of ginger and Vernaccia wine. Of the said pills they give him two, one after the other, made of dog-ginger compounded with aloes; and it then appearing as if he had had the pig himself, they constrain him to buy them off, if he would not have them tell his wife.

Filomena narrates. Just like Bruno and Buffalmacco, Calandrino was also in reality a 14th-century Italian Renaissance painter. However, Calandrino was known as a simpleton by his contemporaries. It is possible that this tale may be true and Boccaccio recorded it first. The test that Bruno and Buffalmacco submit Calandrino to was really a medieval lie detector test and the tale is consistent with what we know about the characters of the three painters.

===Seventh tale (VIII, 7)===
A scholar loves a widow lady, who, being enamoured of another, causes him to spend a winter&#x27;s night awaiting her in the snow. He afterwards by a stratagem causes her to stand for a whole day in July, naked upon a tower, exposed to the flies, the gadflies, and the sun.

Pampinea tells this story of revenge over spurned love, which has many common analogues in many languages in antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and early modern periods.

===Eighth tale (VIII, 8)===
Two men keep with one another: the one lies with the other&#x27;s wife: the other, being aware of it, manages with the aid of his wife to have the one locked in a chest, upon which he then lies with the wife of him that is locked therein.

Fiammetta narrates this tale. Like many of the eighth day it has a theme in common with many tales from the ancient and medieval era and it is not possible to point to one source that served as Boccaccio&#x27;s inspiration.

===Ninth tale (VIII, 9)===
Bruno and Buffalmacco prevail upon Master Simone, a physician, to betake him by night to a certain place, there to be enrolled in a company that go the course. Buffalmacco throws him into a foul ditch, and there they leave him.

Lauretta narrates another tale about Bruno and Buffalmacco and their practical jokes. This story is probably just a vehicle for Boccaccio&#x27;s ability to coin word play, just as tale VI, 10 did.

===Tenth tale (VIII, 10)===
A Sicilian woman cunningly conveys from a merchant that which he has brought to Palermo; he, making a show of being come back with far greater store of goods than before, borrows money of her, and leaves her in lieu thereof water and tow.

The story that Dioneo tells is found in Alphonsus&#x27;s &quot;Disciplina Clericalis&quot; and the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot;, both of which are written in Latin.

==Ninth day==
Emilia is queen of the brigata for the ninth day. For the second time there is no prescribed theme for the stories of the day (the only other time was during the first day).

===First tale (IX, 1)===
Madonna Francesca, having two lovers, the one Rinuccio, the other Alessandro, by name, and loving neither of them, induces the one to simulate a corpse in a tomb, and the other to enter the tomb to fetch him out: whereby, neither satisfying her demands, she artfully rids herself of both.

Filomena narrates.

===Second tale (IX, 2)===
An abbess rises in haste and in the dark, with intent to surprise an accused nun in bed with her lover: thinking to put on her veil, she puts on instead the breeches of a priest that she has with her. The nun, after pointing out her abbess&#x27;s head covering, is acquitted, and thenceforth finds it easier to meet with her lover.

Elissa is the narrator of this tale which was either taken from a fabliau by Jean de Condé written between 1313 and 1337, or from a story about Saint Jerome in &quot;The Golden Legend&quot;, written about 1260. The former was the more likely source for Boccaccio.

===Third tale (IX, 3)===
Master Simone, at the insistence of Bruno and Buffalmacco and Nello, makes Calandrino believe that he is pregnant. Calandrino, accordingly, gives them capons and money for medicines, and is cured without being delivered.

Filostrato narrates this humorous story.

===Fourth tale (IX, 4)===
Cecco, son of Messer Fortarrigo, loses his all at play at Buonconvento, besides the money of Cecco, son of Messer Angiulieri; whom, running after him in his shirt and crying out that he has robbed him, he causes to be taken by peasants: he then puts on his clothes, mounts his palfrey, and leaves him to follow in his shirt.

Neifile is the narrator of this tale.

===Fifth tale (IX, 5)===
Calandrino falls in love with Niccolosa, the wife of the master of the house. Bruno gives him a scroll, averring that, if he touches her with it, she will do anything he says. They are discovered together by his wife, Tessa, who proceeds to beat and scratch him. Bruno and Buffalmacco, who told Tessa of the affair to begin with, laugh at Calandrino&#x27;s misfortune.

===Sixth tale (IX, 6)===

Two young men lodge at an inn, of whom the one lies with the host&#x27;s daughter, his wife accidentally lying with the other. He that lay with the daughter afterwards gets into her father&#x27;s bed and tells him all, taking him to be his comrade. They exchange words: whereupon the good woman, apprehending the circumstances, gets her to bed with her daughter, and by divers apt words re-establishes perfect accord.

Panfilo&#x27;s tale comes from Jean Bodel&#x27;s fabliau &quot;Gombert et les deus Clers&quot;, a story also used by Chaucer for &quot;The Reeve&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

===Seventh tale (IX, 7)===
Talano di Molese dreams that a wolf tears and rends all the neck and face of his wife: he gives her warning thereof, which she heeds not, and the dream comes true.

Pampinea narrates this tale, for which no known earlier source exists.

===Eighth tale (IX, 8)===
Biondello and Ciacco both live a wealthier life than they can afford, which makes them rivals. Biondello tells Ciacco the wrong location of a breakfast: for which prank Ciacco is cunningly avenged on Biondello, causing him to be shamefully beaten by Filippo Argenti. They finally come to a truce.

Lauretta acts as the narrator of this novella.

===Ninth tale (IX, 9)===
Two young men ask counsel of Solomon; the one, how he is to make himself beloved, the other, how he is to reduce an unruly wife to order. The King bids the one to love, and the other to go to the Bridge of Geese. The one bid to love finds true love in return. The other observes a mule train crossing the bridge and sees that by beating a stubborn mule, the herder persuades it to cross the bridge. Upon returning home, he employs the same tactics on his wife; beating her senseless when she refuses to make what he wants for dinner. He wakes the next day to a hot breakfast and returns home that evening to his favorite meal. It appears he has cured his wife of her stubbornness.

Emilia narrates this tale, which probably originated in Asia.

===Tenth tale (IX, 10)===
Dom Gianni at the instance of his gossip Pietro uses an enchantment to transform Pietro&#x27;s wife Gemmata into a mare; but, when he comes to attach the tail, Gossip Pietro, by saying that he will have none of the tail, makes the enchantment of no effect.

Dioneo&#x27;s bawdy story derives from a French fabliau, &quot;De la demoiselle qui vouloit voler en l&#x27;air.&quot;

==Tenth day==
Panfilo is the king of the last day of storytelling and he orders the company to tell stories about deeds of munificence. These tales seem to escalate in their degrees of munificence until the end, where the day (and the entire &quot;Decameron&quot;) reaches an apex in the story of patient Griselda.

===First tale (X, 1)===
A knight in the service of the King of Spain deems himself ill requited. Wherefore the King, by most cogent proof, shows him that the blame rests not with him, but with the knight&#x27;s own evil fortune; after which, he bestows upon him a noble gift.

Neifile&#x27;s story is one of the most widely diffused ones in the entire collection. Its origins come from two different stories. The first part (the comparison of the king to a mule) comes from Busone de&#x27;Raffaelli da Gubbio&#x27;s &quot;Fortunatus Siculus,&quot; written about 1333 in Italian. The second part (concerning the caskets, known to English speakers from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;) originates from about 800 AD from Joannes Damascensus&#x27;s account of Barlaam and Josaphat and was written in Greek. Boccaccio most likely was inspired, though, by the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot;.

===Second tale (X, 2)===
Ghino di Tacco captures the Abbot of Cluny, cures him of a disorder of the stomach, and releases him. The abbot, on his return to the court of Rome, reconciles Ghino with Pope Boniface, and makes him prior of the Hospital.

Elissa narrates. Ghino di Tacco is the Italian equivalent of the English Robin Hood, with the difference that di Tacco was a real person whose deeds as a chief of a band of robbers passed into legend. He lived in the latter half of the 13th century. Boccaccio&#x27;s tale, though, is one of many legends that grew up around him.

===Third tale (X, 3)===
Nathan, an elderly rich man of Cathay, is noted for his exceeding generosity towards the guests of his house on the road leading out of the capital. Mithridanes, a wealthy young man living not far from Nathan, attempts to emulate him, but is frustrated and resolves to kill him. Falling in with Nathan unawares, Nathan advises Mithridanes how to compass his end. Following Nathan&#x27;s advice, he finds the older gentleman in a copse, and recognizing him, is shame-stricken, and becomes his friend.

Filostrato tells this tale. He attributes it to &quot;various Genoese&quot;, but this may be seen as a reluctance to credit Marco Polo (as a Venetian an enemy of Florence and greatly disdained by Boccaccio personally); although no specific tale resembling this one appears in Polo&#x27;s writings, his reports of Kublai Khan&#x27;s generosity are likely the inspiration for the tale.

===Fourth tale (X, 4)===
Messer Gentile de&#x27; Carisendi, from Modena, disinters a lady that he loves, who has been buried for dead. She, being reanimated, gives birth to a male child; and Messer Gentile restores her, with her son, to Niccoluccio Caccianimico, her husband.

Lauretta gives this story, for which there is no clear surviving source. The story is a bit similar to the Florentine legend of Ginevra degli Amieri, set in the last decade of the 14th century, but published no earlier than at the turn of the 16th century.

===Fifth tale (X, 5)===

Messer Ansaldo is in love with Madonna Dianora, a married woman, and often sends her messages of his love. She does not return his affections, and in an attempt to put him off says that she will only be his if he can prove his love by providing for her a garden as fair in January as it is in May. Messer Ansaldo hires for a great sum a necromancer, and thereby gives her the garden. Madonna Dianora tells her husband of her promise, and he says that, while he would prefer that she remain faithful to him if possible, she must keep her word to Messer Ansaldo. When Messer Ansaldo learns of this he releases her from her promise and she returns to her husband. From then on Messer Ansaldo felt only honorable affection for Madonna Dianora. The necromancer is impressed by this and refuses to take any payment from Messer Ansaldo.

Emilia narrates. This tale is found in later manuscripts of the &quot;Śukasaptati&quot;. It is found in several story collections from Asia and in many languages.

===Sixth tale (X, 6)===
King Charles the Old, being conqueror, falls in love with a young maiden, and afterward growing ashamed of his folly bestows her and her sister honourably in marriage.

Fiammetta narrates.

===Seventh tale (X, 7)===

King Pedro, being apprised of the fervent love borne him by Lisa Puccini, who thereof is sick, comforts her, and forthwith gives her in marriage to a young gentleman, and having kissed her on the brow, professes himself her knight ever after.

Pampinea tells this tale. No earlier versions are known, although there may have been a folk tale based on the adventures of Macalda di Scaletta with King Pedro.

===Eighth tale (X, 8)===
Sophronia, albeit she deems herself wife to Gisippus, is wife to Titus Quintius Fulvus, and goes with him to Rome, where Gisippus arrives in indigence, and deeming himself scorned by Titus, to compass his own death, avers that he has slain a man. Titus recognizes him, and to save his life, alleges that &#x27;twas he that slew the man: whereof he that did the deed being witness, he discovers himself as the murderer. Whereby it comes to pass that they are all three liberated by Octavianus; and Titus gives Gisippus his sister to wife, and shares with him all his substance.

Filomena narrates this story, which Boccaccio may have taken from Alphonsus&#x27;s &quot;Disciplina clericalis.&quot; However, its ultimate source is from the East, although there are disputes as to exactly where or when.

===Ninth tale (X, 9)===
Saladin, the Sultan, in guise of a merchant, is honourably entreated by Messer Torello. The Crusade ensuing, Messer Torello appoints a date, after which his wife may marry again: he is taken prisoner by Saladin, and by training hawks comes under Saladin&#x27;s notice. Saladin recognizes him, makes himself known to him, and entreats him with all honor. Messer Torello falls sick, and by magic arts is transported in a single night to Pavia, where his wife&#x27;s second marriage is then to be solemnized, and being present thereat, is recognized by her, and returns with her to his house.

Panfilo is the narrator of this tale.

===Tenth tale (X, 10)===

The Marquis of Saluzzo, Gualtieri, overborne by the entreaties of his vassals, consents to take a wife, but, being minded to please himself in the choice of her, takes a husbandman&#x27;s daughter, Griselda. He has two children by her, both of whom he makes her believe that he has put to death. Afterward, feigning to be tired of her, and to have taken another wife, he turns her out of doors in her shift, and brings his daughter into the house in guise of his bride; but, finding her patient under it all, he brings her home again, and shows her children, now grown up, and honours her, and causes her to be honoured, as Marchioness.

Dioneo tells the final (and possibly most retold) story of the &quot;Decameron&quot;. Although Boccaccio was the first to record the story, he almost certainly did not invent it. Petrarch mentions having heard it many years before, but not from Boccaccio. Therefore, it was probably already circulating in oral tradition when the &quot;Decameron&quot; was written. Petrarch later retold the story in Latin, which is probably the biggest factor that contributed to its huge popularity in subsequent centuries.

==Conclusion==
The work concludes rather abruptly. Boccaccio, as he does in the introduction of the fourth day, defends his work against detractors. However, this time he does it in a humorous and sacrilegious way.

<text>The Book of the City of Ladies, or Le Livre de la Cité des Dames, is a book written by Christine de Pizan believed to have been finished by 1405. Perhaps Pizan&#x27;s most famous literary work, it is her second work of lengthy prose. Pizan uses the vernacular French language to compose the book, but she often uses Latin-style syntax and conventions within her French prose. The book serves as her formal response to Jean de Meun&#x27;s popular &quot;Roman de la Rose&quot;. Pizan combats Meun&#x27;s statements about women by creating an allegorical city of ladies. She defends women by collecting a wide array of famous women throughout history. These women are &quot;housed&quot; in the City of Ladies, which is actually the book. As Pizan builds her city, she uses each famous woman as a building block for not only the walls and houses of the city, but also as building blocks for her thesis. Each woman introduced to the city adds to Pizan&#x27;s argument towards women as valued participants in society. She also advocates in favour of education for women.

Christine de Pizan also finished by 1405 &quot;The Treasure of the City of Ladies&quot; (&quot;Le tresor de la cité des dames de degré en degré&quot;, also known &quot;The Book of the Three Virtues&quot;), a manual of education, dedicated to Princess Margaret of Burgundy. This aims to educate women of all estates, the latter telling women who have husbands: &quot;If she wants to act prudently and have the praise of both the world and her husband, she will be cheerful to him all the time&quot;. Her &quot;Book&quot; and &quot;Treasure&quot; are her two best-known works, along with the poem &quot;Ditie de Jehanne D&#x27;Arc&quot;.

==Summary==

===Part I===
Part I opens with Christine reading from Matheolus&#x27;s &quot;Lamentations&quot;, a work from the thirteenth century that addresses marriage and argues that women make men&#x27;s lives miserable. Upon reading these words, Christine becomes upset and feels ashamed to be a woman: &quot;This thought inspired such a great sense of disgust and sadness in me that I began to despise myself and the whole of my sex as an aberration in nature&quot;. The three Virtues then appear to Christine, and each lady tells Christine what her role will be in helping her build the City of Ladies. Lady Reason, a virtue developed by Christine for the purpose of her book, is the first to join Christine and helps her build the external walls of the city. She answers Christine&#x27;s questions about why some men slander women, helping Christine to prepare the ground on which the city will be built. She tells Christine to &quot;take the spade of [her] intelligence and dig deep to make a trench all around [the city] … [and Reason will] help to carry away the hods of earth on [her] shoulders.&quot; These &quot;hods of earth&quot; are the past beliefs Christine has held. Christine, in the beginning of the text, believed that women must truly be bad because she &quot;could scarcely find a moral work by any author which didn&#x27;t devote some chapter or paragraph to attacking the female sex. [Therefore she] had to accept [these authors] unfavourable opinion[s] of women since it was unlikely that so many learned men, who seemed to be endowed with such great intelligence and insight into all things, could possibly have lied on so many different occasions.&quot; Christine is not using reason to discover the merits of women. She believes all that she reads instead of putting her mind to listing all the great deeds women have accomplished. To help Christine see reason, Lady Reason comes and teaches Christine. She helps Christine dispel her own self-consciousness and the negative thoughts of past writers. By creating Lady Reason, Christine not only teaches her own allegorical self, but also her readers. She gives not only herself reason, but also gives readers, and women, reason to believe that women are not evil or useless creatures but instead have a significant place within society.

===Part II===

In Part II, Lady Rectitude says she will help Christine &quot;construct the houses and buildings inside the walls of the City of Ladies&quot; and fill it with inhabitants who are &quot;valiant ladies of great renown&quot;. As they build, Lady Rectitude informs Christine with examples and &quot;stories of pagan, Hebrew, and Christian ladies&quot; who possessed the gift of prophecy, chastity, or devotion to their families and others. Christine and Lady Rectitude also discuss the institution of marriage, addressing Christine&#x27;s questions regarding men&#x27;s claims about the bad qualities women bring to marriage. Lady Rectitude corrects these misconceptions with examples of women who loved their husbands and acted virtuously, noting that those women who are evil toward their husbands are &quot;like creatures who go totally against their nature&quot;. Lady Rectitude also refutes allegations that women are unchaste, inconstant, unfaithful, and mean by nature through her stories. This part ends with Christine addressing women and asking them to pray for her as she continues her work with Lady Justice to complete the city.

At the close of this part, Christine makes another address to all women announcing the completion of the City of Ladies. She beseeches them to defend and protect the city and to follow their queen (the Virgin Mary). She also warns the women against the lies of slanderers, saying, &quot;Drive back these treacherous liars who use nothing but tricks and honeyed words to steal from you that which you should keep safe above all else: your chastity and your glorious good name&quot;.

== Boccaccio&#x27;s influence ==
Christine&#x27;s main source for information was Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;De mulieribus claris&quot; (On Famous Women), possibly in the French version, &quot;Des Cleres et Nobles Femmes&quot;. This text was a biographical treatise on ancient famous women. Christine also cited from Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; in the latter stages of &quot;The City of Ladies&quot;. The tales of Ghismonda and Lisabetta, for example, are cited from Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot;.

Boccaccio&#x27;s influence can be seen in Christine&#x27;s stance on female education. In the tale of Rhea Ilia, Boccaccio advocates for the right of young women to choose a secular or religious life. He states that it is harmful to place young girls into convents while they are &quot;ignorant or too young or under coercion&quot;. Boccaccio states that girls should be &quot;well brought up from childhood in their father&#x27;s home and taught honesty and virtuous behavior. Then when they are grown and know full well what they are doing&quot; they can choose the life of monasticism. Boccaccio believes that young girls need to be taught about life and virtues before they are consecrated to God.

While he does not say women should have a formal education, he is still advocating for women to have a say in their lives and the right to be well informed about their possible futures. Therefore, Boccaccio&#x27;s belief in educating young girls about secular and religious life could have acted as a stepping stone for Christine&#x27;s belief in female education. Boccaccio&#x27;s outlook was however, according to Margaret King and Albert Rabil, &quot;misogynist, for it singled out for praise those women who possessed the traditional virtues of chastity, silence, and obedience. Women who were active in the public realm... were depicted as suffering terrible punishments for entering into the masculine sphere.&quot;

Boccaccio&#x27;s text is mainly used for Parts I and II of the book, while Part III is more reliant upon Jean de Vignay&#x27;s &quot;Miroir historical&quot; (1333). This text is the French translation of the historical portions of &quot;Speculum Maius&quot;, an encyclopedia by Vincent of Beauvais that was begun after 1240.

==Themes==
&quot;The Book of the City of Ladies&quot; is an allegorical society in which the word &quot;lady&quot; is defined as a woman of noble spirit, instead of noble birth. The book, and therefore the city, contains women of past eras, ranging from pagans to ancient Jews to medieval Christian saints. The book includes discussion between Christine de Pizan and the three female Virtues which are sent to aid Christine build the city. These Virtues – Reason, Rectitude, and Justice – help Christine build the foundations and houses of the city, as well as pick the women who will reside in the city of ladies. Each woman chosen by the Virtues to live in the city acts as a positive example for other women to follow. These women are also examples of the positive influences women have had on society.

Christine asks the virtues if women should be taught as men are and why some men think women should not be educated. Other questions that are explored are: the criminality of rape, the natural affinity in women to learn, and their talent for government.

<text>James Thorne Smith, Jr. (March 27, 1892 – June 20, 1934) was an American writer of humorous supernatural fantasy fiction under the byline Thorne Smith. He is best known today for the two &quot;Topper&quot; novels, comic fantasy fiction involving sex, much drinking and ghosts. With racy illustrations, these sold millions of copies in the 1930s and were equally popular in paperbacks of the 1950s.

==Life and career==
Smith was born in Annapolis, Maryland, the son of a Navy commodore, and attended Dartmouth College. In 1919, after being discharged from the Navy the same year, he moved to Greenwich Village, where he met Celia Sullivan whom he would marry. In need of money, he worked part-time as an advertising agent. He and his wife would soon move to New York, where their first daughter Marion was born on November 14, 1922, and their second daughter June on March 4, 1924. In 1926 Smith achieved meteoric success with the publication of &quot;Topper&quot;. He was an early resident of Free Acres, a social experimental community developed by Bolton Hall according to the economic principles of Henry George, in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey. He died of a heart attack in 1934 at the age of 42 while vacationing in Florida.

Smith was a close friend of actor Roland Young, who played the character Topper in several movie adaptations of Smith&#x27;s work. After Smith&#x27;s death, Young wrote a short biography, &quot;Thorne Smith: His Life and Times&quot;, which is now a collector&#x27;s item.

==Works==
* &quot;Biltmore Oswald: The Diary of a Hapless Recruit&quot; (1918). A series of comic stories written for the Naval Reserve journal &quot;The Broadside&quot; while Smith was in the Navy.
* &quot;Out O&#x27; Luck: Biltmore Oswald Very Much at Sea&quot; (1919).
* &quot;Haunts and Bypaths&quot; (1919). A book of poetry.
* &quot;Topper&quot; (1926, copyright renewed 1953also known as &quot;The Jovial Ghosts&quot;). This and its sequel, &quot;Topper Takes a Trip&quot; (1932, set in the French Riviera), are probably Smith&#x27;s most famous work, about a respectable banker called Cosmo Topper, married to his depressingly staid wife Mary, and his misadventures with a couple of ghosts, Marion and George Kerby, who introduce him to other ghosts. He is romantically attracted to Marion, who at one point tries to kill him so that they can always be together. Unusually for such a book, Mary is treated sympathetically—she does not like what she has become and tries to change. 
: &quot;Topper&quot; was made into a 1937 film starring Cary Grant as George Kerby, Constance Bennett as Marion Kerby, and Roland Young as Cosmo Topper. Two filmed sequels followed: &quot;Topper Takes a Trip&quot;, in 1939, and &quot;Topper Returns&quot;, in 1941. The latter film was not based on a book. Young reprised the role in the 1945 NBC radio summer replacement series &quot;The Adventures of Topper&quot;. The books were adapted into an American television series, &quot;Topper&quot;, beginning in 1953, with Leo G. Carroll as Cosmo Topper, and Robert Sterling and Anne Jeffreys as the ghosts. Seventy-eight episodes were made. The pilot episode and a few of the early episodes were written by Stephen Sondheim.
* &quot;Dream&#x27;s End&quot; (1927, copyright renewed 1955). A serious novel that was not a success.
* &quot;The Stray Lamb&quot; (1929). Mild-mannered investment banker, cuckold, and dipsomaniac T. Lawrence Lamb gains perspective on the human condition during a series of mysterious transformations into various animal forms. Lamb, his daughter Hebe, her boyfriend Melville Long, and Hebe&#x27;s friend Sandra Rush (a twentyish lingerie model who becomes Lamb&#x27;s love interest) pursue many adventures, most of which fall well outside the perimeter of law and order. Lamb has, like many Thorne Smith heroes, a shrewish (and in this case adulterous) wife who at one point tries to murder him (at the time he is a goldfish). As in many Thorne Smith novels, a courtroom scene involving the protagonists and an exasperated judge provides a climax to the characteristically tipsy action. This novel is included with &quot;Turnabout&quot; and &quot;Rain in the Doorway&quot; in &quot;The Thorne Smith 3-Decker&quot; (Sun Dial Press, 1933).
* &quot;Did She Fall?&quot; (1930). A mystery novel admired by Dashiell Hammett.
* &quot;The Night Life of the Gods&quot; (1931). Quirky inventor Hunter Hawk strikes gold when he invents a device enabling him to turn living matter into stone and to reverse the process at will. After a chaotic field test he meets stunning 900-year-old Megaera, who teaches him to turn stone into flesh. They and some friends set their sights on New York City to bring the Roman gods of the Metropolitan Museum of Art to life: Mercury shows himself an expert pickpocket, while Neptune causes chaos in the fish market.
* &quot;Turnabout&quot; (1931) pits two modern married people into a battle of the sexes. Noticing the bickering and jealousy of a young man and wife, an Egyptian idol causes them to switch bodies. Tim Willows works in an advertising agency, and several of the scenes draw on author Thorne Smith&#x27;s experience. After his wife, Sally, impregnates her husband, things take a decided turn for the worse as they separately try to deal with the object of the former wife&#x27;s affections—a square-jawed philanderer by the name of Carl Bently. The scene in which Tim, trapped in his wife&#x27;s body, exacts an icy revenge on the unfortunate interloper is one of the unforgettable moments of Thorne Smith&#x27;s peculiar humor. Both a film (1940) and a short-lived 1979 television sitcom starring Sharon Gless and John Schuck (canceled after six episodes) were based on &quot;Turnabout&quot;, as to some extent was the last broadcast episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, &quot;Turnabout Intruder&quot;. This novel is included with &quot;The Stray Lamb&quot; and &quot;Rain in the Doorway&quot; in &quot;The Thorne Smith 3-Decker&quot;.
* &quot;Lazy Bear Lane&quot; (1931). A children&#x27;s book.
* &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Jaegers&quot; (1932). The depressed, indifferent heir of a vast coffee import fortune, Peter Van Dyke finds his life and high society engagement turned upside down when his secretary, Josephine Duval, determines to “rescue” him by ruining him morally. After an amusing scandal in a coat closet, he is cast adrift in a fog with a motley crew that includes a bishop of the Episcopal Church and a former nude model named Aspirin Liz. The enterprising party lands unceremoniously on the shores of a naturist resort, and the liberation of the coffee importer is set in motion. Smith, in one of his few comic novels devoid of any element of the supernatural, assumes the reader would know that &quot;Jaegers&quot; refers to a union suit.
* &quot;Rain in the Doorway&quot; (1933). A cuckold husband, Hector Owen, inadvertently becomes a partner in a big-city department store. The bulk of the action involves the inebriated adventures of Owen, his three partners (Mr. Horace Larkin, a man called Dinner, and Major Barney Britt-Britt), and a salesgirl from the pornographic books department, Miss Honor &quot;Satin&quot; Knightly. Of the three novels included in &quot;The Thorne Smith 3-Decker&quot; (see &quot;The Stray Lamb&quot; and &quot;Turnabout&quot; above) this is the most openly erotic, with many direct suggestions of sexual encounters, accompanied with cartoons of nude women cavorting with the protagonists, drawn by artist Herbert Roese. The Thorne Smith courtroom scene provides a climax, but the novel&#x27;s biggest surprise isn&#x27;t sprung until the final pages.
* &quot;Skin and Bones&quot; (1933). A photographer&#x27;s freak accident in the darkroom produces a chemical concoction causing him and his dog to randomly switch back and forth between normal and X-ray (skeleton) versions of themselves. Drinking and cavorting ensues as he finds people able to see beyond his appearance and appreciate him for who he is, while inadvertently terrifying those who cannot. Unusually, his wife Lorna is an attractive personality.
* &quot;The Glorious Pool&quot; (1934). Perhaps the best example of Thorne Smith&#x27;s acutely sharp social humor played out against a backdrop of the Volstead Act (Prohibition). Two unrepentant reprobates are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the seduction which made the stylish Rex Pebble into an adulterer and his companion, Spray Summers, into his hard-boiled mistress. While their exasperating and alcoholic Japanese houseboy, Nakashima, plays jujitsu with the English language, the two slip into a swimming pool, the waters of which have been changed into a fountain of youth. Abandoning their clothes and modesty with their advanced years, the newfound youthfulness of their bodies puts into motion an evening of hijinks that only a seasoned and well-practiced couple of sinners could imagine.
* &quot;The Passionate Witch&quot; (1941, published posthumously and completed by Norman H. Matson). Produced in 1942 as the film &quot;I Married a Witch&quot;, this novel was one of the inspirations, along with &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot;, for the long-running TV series &quot;Bewitched&quot;. A sequel to the novel, &quot;Bats in the Belfry&quot; (1942), is entirely by Matson, though sometimes attributed to Smith.

&quot;Skin and Bones&quot;, &quot;Turnabout&quot;, &quot;The Night Life of the Gods&quot;, &quot;The Passionate Witch&quot;, &quot;The Stray Lamb&quot;, &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Jaegers&quot;, &quot;The Glorious Pool&quot;, and &quot;Rain in the Doorway&quot; were all published by Armed Services Editions.

<doc id="31434" wikidata="Q2688051" url="?curid=31434" title="The Sentinel (short story)">
<text>&quot;The Sentinel&quot; is a science fiction short story by British author Arthur C. Clarke, written in 1948 and first published in 1951. Its plot and ideas influenced the development of the 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and its corresponding novel.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Sentinel&quot; was written in 1948 for a BBC competition in which it failed to place. It was first published in the magazine &quot;10 Story Fantasy&quot;, in the Spring 1951 issue, under the title &quot;Sentinel of Eternity&quot;. Despite the story&#x27;s initial failure, it ultimately changed the course of Clarke&#x27;s career. It appears in the short story collections &quot;Expedition to Earth&quot; (1953), &quot;The Nine Billion Names of God&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (1982), as well as in &quot;The Lost Worlds of 2001&quot; (1972).

== Plot ==
The story is set in 1996 (at the time of writing, several decades in the future). The narrator, Wilson, is a veteran selenologist on an expedition to explore the lunar surface. He comes across a mysterious pyramidal structure, surrounded by an &quot;invisible shield&quot; which blocks all attempts to approach. The structure is found to have been placed on the Moon several billion years earlier, and it is not the product of any terrestrial or lunar civilization.

Twenty years pass before the invisible shield is successfully breached, using atomic energy. The structure is destroyed in the process, and its fragments are found to be incomprehensible, being far more advanced than any human technology. Wilson realizes that the structure was created and placed on the Moon by technologically advanced aliens from outside the solar system.

Wilson presents his guess as to the structure&#x27;s purpose: it was a &quot;sentinel&quot; which for billions of years had been transmitting signals into space. The sentinel&#x27;s destruction—which humans could only accomplish by mastering space travel and atomic energy—will have caused its signals to cease, thereby alerting its creators to intelligent life having discovered it. Wilson expresses his belief that the aliens will soon be &quot;turning their gaze upon the Earth&quot;.

==Reception==
Algis Budrys found &quot;The Sentinel&quot; to be infuriating, saying that &quot;one can raise a formidable reputation for profundity by repeating, over and over again, that the universe is wide and man is very small... while our instruments show that the universe is wide, they are our instruments and we managed somehow to build them. There is no evidence whatsoever that Man is that goddamned small.&quot;

Singer-songwriter Roger McGuinn wrote and performed the song &quot;Space Odyssey&quot;, whose subject is “The Sentinel”. It is the closing track on the 1968 album by the Byrds, &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot;, and consists mostly of a Moog synthesizer and minimal instrumental accompaniment. The vocals are delivered in a &quot;sea shanty&quot; cadence.

== Influence on &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; ==
The story&#x27;s plot and ideas were a significant influence on the development of the 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; by Stanley Kubrick and on the novel. Clarke and Kubrick adapted the short story and fused it with many other concepts. Clarke later expressed impatience with &quot;The Sentinel&quot; being described as the basis for the film:

<text>The Fountains of Paradise is a 1979 science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C. Clarke. Set in the 22nd century, it describes the construction of a space elevator. This &quot;orbital tower&quot; is a giant structure rising from the ground and linking with a satellite in geostationary orbit at the height of approximately 36,000 kilometres (approx. 22,300 miles). Such a structure would be used to raise payloads to orbit without the expense of using rockets. The novel won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Novel.

==Plot==
===Summary===
The novel focuses primarily on a project known as the Orbital Tower proposed by the main character, Vannevar Morgan. The tower is to stretch from the Earth&#x27;s equator to a satellite that is in geostationary orbit. Such a structure would greatly reduce the cost of sending people and supplies into space.

The main story is framed by two other stories. The first one tells of King Kalidasa, living thousands of years before Morgan is born, who is constructing a &#x27;pleasure garden&#x27; complete with functioning fountains, in a significant engineering effort for the time. The other story, taking place long after Morgan has died, deals with aliens making contact with Earth.

Due to many technical issues, there are only two locations on Earth where the Orbital Tower can be built. One is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and the other is Sri Kanda (a thinly veiled reference to Adam&#x27;s Peak in Sri Lanka). However, there is a Buddhist temple on the island, and Mahanayake Thero, the head of the order, refuses to give permission to begin construction.

Hearing of the difficulties, a group of people living on Mars contacts Morgan and suggests that the tower be built there instead. It would be smaller than the one planned for Earth, and would reach from Mars to one of its moons, Deimos.

After a few setbacks, including some fatalities, construction of the tower gets underway. Although the engineer&#x27;s heart is failing, he rides up the tower to take food and oxygen to a group of stranded students and their professor. After overcoming serious difficulties he succeeds, then dies of a heart attack on the way back down.

==Themes==
The main theme of the novel is preceded by, and to some extent juxtaposed with, the story of the life and death of King Kashyapa I of Sri Lanka (fictionalized as King Kalidasa). It foreshadows the exploits of Vannevar Morgan in his determination to realize the space elevator.

Other subplots include human colonization of the Solar system and the first contact with extraterrestrial intelligence.

Clarke envisions a microscopically thin (in his demonstrator sample) but strong &quot;hyperfilament&quot; that makes the elevator possible. Although the hyperfilament is constructed from &quot;continuous pseudo-one-dimensional diamond crystal&quot;, Clarke later expressed his belief that another type of carbon, buckminsterfullerene, would play the role of hyperfilament in a real space elevator. The latest developments in carbon nanotube technology bring the orbital elevator closer to possible realisation.

==Setting==
The story is set in the fictional equatorial island country of Taprobane, which Clarke has described as &quot;about ninety percent congruent with the island of Sri Lanka&quot;, south of its real-world location. The ruins of the palace at Yakkagala as described in the book very closely match the real-life ruins at Sigiriya in Sri Lanka. The mountain on which the space elevator is built is called Sri Kanda in the book, and bears a strong resemblance to the real mountain Sri Pada (Adam&#x27;s Peak).

==Similarities with other works of Clarke==
* In the middle of &quot;The Fountains of Paradise&quot;, an unmanned robotic spaceship of alien origin, called &quot;Starglider&quot; (from an origin world dubbed &quot;Starholme&quot;) by Clarke, passes through the Solar system. This situation is similar to &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, though the ship and its interactions with humans are very different.
* The first third of &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot; describes details of the interior of the ring habitat that encircles Earth, and is connected to Earth&#x27;s surface with four space elevators. At the end of &quot;The Fountains of Paradise&quot;, this ring habitat is shown for the first time, though it has six space elevators rather than the four of &quot;3001: Final Odyssey&quot;.
* At the end of the novel, Earth turns into an icy wasteland because the Sun has cooled. The same situation also occurs in the story &quot;History Lesson&quot;.
* The alien shown near the end of &quot;The Fountains of Paradise&quot; is a somewhat more physical form of the Swarm, the aliens that land on primeval Earth in &quot;The Possessed&quot;.
* A space elevator is also constructed in the course of Clarke&#x27;s final novel (co-written with Frederik Pohl), &quot;The Last Theorem&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
* Winner, Hugo Award for Best Novel - 1980
* Winner, Nebula Award for Best Novel - 1979
* Nominee, Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel - 1980
* Nominee, British Science Fiction Association Award - 1979

<text>Tagalog ( , ; &quot;Baybayin&quot;: ) is an Austronesian language spoken as a first language by the ethnic Tagalog people, who make up a quarter of the population of the Philippines, and as a second language by the majority, mostly as or through Filipino. Its de facto standardized, codified, national or nationalized, intellectualized, more linguistically inclusive, more linguistically dynamic, and expanded or broadened form, officially named &quot;Filipino&quot;, is the national language of the Philippines, and is one of the nation&#x27;s two official languages, alongside English. Tagalog, like the other and as one of the regional languages of the Philippines, which majority are Austronesian, is one of the auxiliary official languages of the Philippines in the regions and also one of the auxiliary media of instruction therein.

Tagalog is closely related to other Philippine languages, such as the Bikol languages, the Bisayan languages, Ilocano, Kapampangan, and Pangasinan, and more distantly to other Austronesian languages, such as the Formosan languages of Taiwan, Indonesian, Malay, Hawaiian, Māori, Malagasy, and many more.

==Classification==
Tagalog is a Central Philippine language within the Austronesian language family. Being Malayo-Polynesian, it is related to other Austronesian languages, such as Malagasy, Javanese, Indonesian, Malay, Tetum (of Timor), and Yami (of Taiwan). It is closely related to the languages spoken in the Bicol Region and the Visayas islands, such as the Bikol group and the Visayan group, including Waray-Waray, Hiligaynon and Cebuano.

Tagalog differs from its Central Philippine counterparts with its treatment of the Proto-Philippine schwa vowel . In most Bikol and Visayan languages, this sound merged with and . In Tagalog, it has merged with . For example, Proto-Philippine (adhere, stick) is Tagalog &quot;dikít&quot; and Visayan &amp; Bikol &quot;dukót&quot;.

Proto-Philippine , , and merged with but is between vowels. Proto-Philippine (name) and (kiss) became Tagalog &quot;ngalan&quot; and &quot;halík&quot;. Adjacent to an affix, however, it becomes instead: &quot;bayád&quot; (paid) → &quot;bayaran&quot; (to pay).

Proto-Philippine merged with . (water) and (blood) became Tagalog &quot;tubig&quot; and &quot;dugô&quot;.

==History==


The word &quot;Tagalog&quot; is possibly derived from the endonym &quot;taga-ilog&quot; (&quot;river dweller&quot;), composed of &quot;tagá-&quot; (&quot;native of&quot; or &quot;from&quot;) and &quot;ilog&quot; (&quot;river&quot;), or alternatively, &quot;taga-alog&quot; deriving from &quot;alog&quot; (&quot;pool of water in the lowlands&quot;; &quot;rice or vegetable plantation&quot;). Linguists such as David Zorc and Robert Blust speculate that the Tagalogs and other Central Philippine ethno-linguistic groups originated in Northeastern Mindanao or the Eastern Visayas.

Possible words of Old Tagalog origin are attested in the Laguna Copperplate Inscription from the tenth century, which is largely written in Old Malay. The first known complete book to be written in Tagalog is the &quot;Doctrina Christiana&quot; (Christian Doctrine), printed in 1593. The &quot;Doctrina&quot; was written in Spanish and two transcriptions of Tagalog; one in the ancient, then-current Baybayin script and the other in an early Spanish attempt at a Latin orthography for the language.

Throughout the 333 years of Spanish rule, various grammars and dictionaries were written by Spanish clergymen. In 1610, the Dominican priest Francisco Blancas de San José published the &quot;Arte y reglas de la lengua tagala&quot; (which was subsequently revised with two editions in 1752 and 1832) in Bataan. In 1613, the Franciscan priest Pedro de San Buenaventura published the first Tagalog dictionary, his &quot;Vocabulario de la lengua tagala&quot; in Pila, Laguna.

The first substantial dictionary of the Tagalog language was written by the Czech Jesuit missionary Pablo Clain in the beginning of the 18th century. Clain spoke Tagalog and used it actively in several of his books. He prepared the dictionary, which he later passed over to Francisco Jansens and José Hernandez. Further compilation of his substantial work was prepared by P. Juan de Noceda and P. Pedro de Sanlucar and published as &quot;Vocabulario de la lengua tagala&quot; in Manila in 1754 and then repeatedly reedited, with the last edition being in 2013 in Manila.

Among others, &quot;Arte de la lengua tagala y manual tagalog para la administración de los Santos Sacramentos&quot; (1850) in addition to early studies of the language.

The indigenous poet Francisco Balagtas (1788–1862) is known as the foremost Tagalog writer, his most notable work being the 19th-century epic &quot;Florante at Laura&quot;.

===Official status===
Tagalog was declared the official language by the first revolutionary constitution in the Philippines, the in 1897.

In 1935, the Philippine constitution designated English and Spanish as official languages, but mandated the development and adoption of a common national language based on one of the existing native languages. After study and deliberation, the National Language Institute, a committee composed of seven members who represented various regions in the Philippines, chose Tagalog as the basis for the evolution and adoption of the national language of the Philippines. President Manuel L. Quezon then, on December 30, 1937, proclaimed the selection of the Tagalog language to be used as the basis for the evolution and adoption of the national language of the Philippines. In 1939, President Quezon renamed the proposed Tagalog-based national language as &quot;Wikang Pambansâ&quot; (national language). Quezon himself was born and raised in Baler, Aurora, which is a native Tagalog-speaking area. Under the Japanese puppet government during World War II, Tagalog as a national language was strongly promoted; the 1943 Constitution specifying: &quot;The government shall take steps toward the development and propagation of Tagalog as the national language.&quot;

In 1959, the language was further renamed as &quot;Pilipino&quot;. Along with English, the national language has had official status under the 1973 constitution (as &quot;Pilipino&quot;) and the present 1987 constitution (as Filipino).

===Controversy===
The adoption of Tagalog in 1937 as basis for a national language is not without its own controversies. Instead of specifying Tagalog, the national language was designated as &quot;Wikang Pambansâ&quot; (&quot;National Language&quot;) in 1939. Twenty years later, in 1959, it was renamed by then Secretary of Education, José E. Romero, as &quot;Pilipino&quot; to give it a national rather than ethnic label and connotation. The changing of the name did not, however, result in acceptance among non-Tagalogs, especially Cebuanos who had not accepted the selection.

The national language issue was revived once more during the 1971 Constitutional Convention. The majority of the delegates were even in favor of scrapping the idea of a &quot;national language&quot; altogether. A compromise solution was worked out—a &quot;universalist&quot; approach to the national language, to be called &quot;Filipino&quot; rather than &quot;Pilipino&quot;. The 1973 constitution makes no mention of Tagalog. When a new constitution was drawn up in 1987, it named Filipino as the national language. The constitution specified that as the Filipino language evolves, it shall be further developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages. However, more than two decades after the institution of the &quot;universalist&quot; approach, there seems to be little if any difference between Tagalog and Filipino.

===Use in education===
Upon the issuance of &quot;Executive Order No. 134&quot;, Tagalog was declared as basis of the National Language. On April 12, 1940, &quot;Executive No. 263&quot; was issued ordering the teaching of the national language in all public and private schools in the country.

Article XIV, Section 6 of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines specifies, in part:

Under Section 7, however:

In 2009, the Department of Education promulgated an order institutionalizing a system of mother-tongue based multilingual education (&quot;MLE&quot;), wherein instruction is conducted primarily in a student&#x27;s mother tongue (one of the various regional Philippine languages) until at least grade three, with additional languages such as Filipino and English being introduced as separate subjects no earlier than grade two. In secondary school, Filipino and English become the primary languages of instruction, with the learner&#x27;s first language taking on an auxiliary role. After pilot tests in selected schools, the MLE program was implemented nationwide from School Year (SY) 2012–2013.

Tagalog is the first language of a quarter of the population of the Philippines (particularly in Central and Southern Luzon) and the second language for the majority.

==Geographic distribution==
===In the Philippines===


According to the 2020 census conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority, there were 109 million people living in the Philippines, where the vast majority have some basic level of understanding of the language, mostly, mainly, majority or predominantly because of Filipino. The Tagalog homeland, Katagalugan, covers roughly much of the central to southern parts of the island of Luzon — particularly in Aurora, Bataan, Batangas, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, Metro Manila, Nueva Ecija, Quezon, and Rizal. Tagalog is also spoken natively by inhabitants living on the islands of Marinduque and Mindoro, as well as Palawan to a lesser extent. Significant minorities are found in the other Central Luzon provinces of Pampanga and Tarlac, Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur in Bicol Region, the Cordillera city of Baguio and various parts of Mindanao especially in the island&#x27;s urban areas, but especially, more accurately and specifically, officially, sociolinguistically and linguistic politically as, through or in the form of Filipino. Tagalog or Filipino is also the predominant language of Cotabato City in Mindanao, making it the only place outside of Luzon with a native Tagalog-speaking or also a Filipino-speaking majority. It is also the main lingua franca in Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, but especially or more accurately and specifically as, through or in the form of Filipino.

According to the 2000 Philippine Census, approximately 96% of the household population who were able to attend school could speak Tagalog, or especially or more accurately and specifically as, through or in the form of Filipino; and about 28% of the total population spoke it natively.

The following regions and provinces of the Philippines are majority Tagalog-speaking, or also overlapping with being more accurately and specifically Filipino-speaking (from north to south):
* Central Luzon Region
** Aurora
** Bataan
** Bulacan
** Nueva Ecija
**Zambales
* Metro Manila (National Capital Region)
*Southern Luzon
** Southern Tagalog (Calabarzon and Mimaropa)
*** Batangas
*** Cavite
*** Laguna
*** Rizal
*** Quezon
*** Marinduque
*** Occidental Mindoro
*** Oriental Mindoro
*** Romblon (While Romblomanon, Onhan, and Asi are the native languages of the province, Tagalog, or especially or more accurately and specifically as, through or in the form of a provincial variety of Filipino, is used as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; between the various language groups.)
*** Palawan (Historically a non-Tagalog-speaking province, waves of cross-migration from various other regions, especially Calabarzon, has resulted in Tagalog, or especially or more accurately and specifically as, through or in the form of a provincial variety of Filipino, now being the main spoken language in Palawan.)
** Bicol Region (While the Bikol languages have traditionally been the majority languages in the following provinces, heavy Tagalog influence and migration has resulted in its significant presence in these provinces and in many communities, Tagalog is now the majority language.)
*** Camarines Norte
*** Camarines Sur
* Bangsamoro
** Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur (While Maguindanao has traditionally been the majority language of these provinces, Tagalog, or especially or more accurately and specifically as, through or in the form of a regional variety of Filipino, is now the main language of &quot;mother tongue&quot; primary education (but here as the local and regional auxiliary official Tagalog language, rather than or instead of the national and official Filipino language) in the province, the majority language in the regional center of Cotabato City (either or both Tagalog or Filipino), and the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao or BARMM (mostly, mainly, majority or predominantly Filipino).)
*Davao Region
**Metro Davao (While Cebuano is the majority language of the region, a linguistic phenomenon has developed whereby local residents have either shifted to Tagalog or Filipino, or significantly mix Tagalog terms and grammar into their Cebuano speech, or especially or more accurately and specifically in the form of a regional metropolitan variety of Filipino, because older generations speak Tagalog or Filipino to their children in home settings, and Cebuano is spoken in everyday settings, making Tagalog or Filipino the secondary lingua franca. Additionally, migrations from Tagalog-speaking provinces to the area are also the contributing factors.)
*Soccsksargen
**North Cotabato, South Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat (Despite Hiligaynon being the regional main lingua franca, migrations from Luzon and Visayas (including influx of migrants from Tagalog-speaking regions) to North Cotabato, South Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat has made Tagalog, or especially or more accurately and specifically, as, through or in the form of a regional variety of Filipino, the secondary lingua franca between various ethnolinguistic groups on everyday basis, especially those who cannot speak and understand Hiligaynon. Signages in the region are often written in Tagalog, or especially or more accurately and specifically as, through or in the form of a regional variety of Filipino. Additionally, the language is also used in administrative functions by the local government, in education and in local media, but especially or more accurately and specifically as, through or in the form of a regional variety of Filipino, and not and not as, through nor in the form of Tagalog nor its traditional Tagalog varieties.)

Tagalog speakers are also found in other parts of the Philippines and especially, more accurately and specifically, officially, sociolinguistically and linguistic politically as and through its standardized, codified, national or nationalized, intellectualized, more linguistically inclusive, more linguistically dynamic, and expanded or broaden form of, as and through Filipino, and the language serves as the national &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the country, but especially or more accurately and specifically as and through Filipino.

===Outside of the Philippines===

Tagalog serves as the common language among Overseas Filipinos, though its use overseas is usually limited to communication between Filipino ethnic groups. The largest concentration of Tagalog speakers outside the Philippines is found in the United States, wherein 2020, the United States Census Bureau reported (based on data collected in 2018) that it was the fourth most-spoken non-English language at home with over 1.7 million speakers, behind Spanish, French, and Chinese (with figures for Cantonese and Mandarin combined).

A study based on data from the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s 2015 American Consumer Survey shows that Tagalog is the most commonly spoken non-English language after Spanish in California, Nevada, and Washington states.

Tagalog is one of three recognized languages in San Francisco, California, along with Spanish and Chinese, making all essential city services be communicated using these languages along with English. Meanwhile, Tagalog and Ilocano (which is primarily spoken in northern Philippines) are among the non-official languages of Hawaii that its state offices and state-funded entities are required to provide oral and written translations to its residents. Election ballots in Nevada include instructions written in Tagalog, which was first introduced in the 2020 United States presidential elections.

Other countries with significant concentrations of overseas Filipinos and Tagalog speakers include Saudi Arabia with 938,490, Canada with 676,775, Japan with 313,588, United Arab Emirates with 541,593, Kuwait with 187,067, and Malaysia with 620,043.

==Dialects==
At present, no comprehensive dialectology has been done in the Tagalog-speaking regions, though there have been descriptions in the form of dictionaries and grammars of various Tagalog dialects. Ethnologue lists Manila, Lubang, Marinduque, Bataan (Western Central Luzon), Batangas, Bulacan (Eastern Central Luzon), Tanay-Paete (Rizal-Laguna), and (Quezon) as dialects of Tagalog; however, there appear to be four main dialects, of which the aforementioned are a part: Northern (exemplified by the Bulacan dialect), Central (including Manila), Southern (exemplified by Batangas), and Marinduque.

Some example of dialectal differences are:
* Many Tagalog dialects, particularly those in the south, preserve the glottal stop found after consonants and before vowels. This has been lost in Standard Tagalog, probably influenced by Spanish, where glottal stop doesn&#x27;t exist. For example, standard Tagalog &quot;ngayón&quot; (now, today), &quot;sinigáng&quot; (broth stew), &quot;gabí&quot; (night), &quot;matamís&quot; (sweet), are pronounced and written &quot;ngay-on&quot;, &quot;sinig-ang&quot;, &quot;gab-i&quot;, and &quot;matam-is&quot; in other dialects.
* In Teresian-Morong Tagalog, alternates with . For example, &quot;bundók&quot; (mountain), &quot;dagat&quot; (sea), &quot;dingdíng&quot; (wall), &quot;isdâ&quot; (fish), and &quot;litid&quot; (joints) become &quot;bunrók&quot;, &quot;ragat&quot;, &quot;ringríng&quot;, &quot;isrâ&quot;, and &quot;litir&quot;, e.g. &quot;sandók sa dingdíng&quot; (&quot;ladle on a wall&quot; or &quot;ladle on the wall&quot;, depending on the sentence) becoming &quot;sanrók sa ringríng&quot;. However, exceptions are recent loanwords, and if the next consonant after a is an (&quot;durog&quot;) or an (&quot;dilà&quot;).
* In many southern dialects, the progressive aspect infix of &quot;-um-&quot; verbs is &quot;na-&quot;. For example, standard Tagalog &quot;kumakain&quot; (eating) is &quot;nákáin&quot; in Aurora, Quezon, and Batangas Tagalog. This is the butt of some jokes by other Tagalog speakers, for should a Southern Tagalog ask &quot;nákáin ka ba ng patíng?&quot; (&quot;Do you eat shark?&quot;), he would be understood as saying &quot;Has a shark eaten you?&quot; by speakers of the Manila Dialect.
* Some dialects have interjections which are considered a regional trademark. For example, the interjection &quot;ala e!&quot; usually identifies someone from Batangas as does &quot;hane?!&quot; in Rizal and Quezon provinces and &quot;akkaw&quot; in Aurora.

Perhaps the most divergent Tagalog dialects are those spoken in Marinduque. Linguist Rosa Soberano identifies two dialects, western and eastern, with the former being closer to the Tagalog dialects spoken in the provinces of Batangas and Quezon.

One example is the verb conjugation paradigms. While some of the affixes are different, Marinduque also preserves the imperative affixes, also found in Visayan and Bikol languages, that have mostly disappeared from most Tagalog early 20th century; they have since merged with the infinitive.

The Manila Dialect is the basis for the national language.

Outside of Luzon, a variety of Tagalog called Soccsksargen Tagalog (Sox-Tagalog, also called Kabacan Tagalog) is spoken in Soccsksargen, a southwestern region in Mindanao, as well as Cotabato City. This &quot;hybrid&quot; Tagalog dialect is a blend of Tagalog (including its dialects) with other languages where they are widely spoken and varyingly heard such as Hiligaynon (a regional lingua franca), Ilocano, Cebuano as well as Maguindanaon and other indigenous languages native to region, as a result of migration from Panay, Negros, Cebu, Bohol, Siquijor, Ilocandia, Cagayan Valley, Cordillera Administrative Region, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mindoro and Marinduque since the turn of 20th century, therefore making the region a melting pot of cultures and languages.

Tagalog has 21 phonemes: 16 of them are consonants and 5 are vowels. Native Tagalog words follow CV(C) syllable structure, though complex consonant clusters are permitted in loanwords.

===Vowels===
Tagalog has five vowels, and four diphthongs. Tagalog originally had three vowel phonemes: , , and . Tagalog is now considered to have five vowel phonemes following the introduction of two marginal phonemes from Spanish, /o/ and /e/.
* an open central unrounded vowel roughly similar to English &quot;father&quot;; in the middle of a word, a near-open central vowel similar to Received Pronunciation &quot;cup&quot;; or an open front unrounded vowel similar to Received Pronunciation or California English &quot;hat&quot;
* an open-mid front unrounded vowel similar to General American English &quot;bed&quot;
* a close front unrounded vowel similar to English &quot;machine&quot;
* a mid back rounded vowel similar to General American English &quot;soul&quot; or Philippine English &quot;forty&quot;
* a close back rounded vowel similar to English &quot;flute&quot;

Nevertheless, simplification of pairs and is likely to take place, especially in some Tagalog as second language, remote location and working class registers.

The four diphthongs are , , , and . Long vowels are not written apart from pedagogical texts, where an acute accent is used: &quot;á é í ó ú.&quot;

The table above shows all the possible realizations for each of the five vowel sounds depending on the speaker&#x27;s origin or proficiency. The five general vowels are in bold.

===Consonants===
Below is a chart of Tagalog consonants. All the stops are unaspirated. The velar nasal occurs in all positions including at the beginning of a word. Loanword variants using these phonemes are italicized inside the angle brackets.
* between vowels has a tendency to become as in &quot;loch&quot;, German &quot;Bach&quot;, whereas in the initial position it has a tendency to become , especially in the Manila dialect.
*Intervocalic and tend to become , as in Spanish &quot;agua&quot;, especially in the Manila dialect.
* and were once allophones, and they still vary grammatically, with initial becoming intervocalic in many words.
*A glottal stop that occurs in pausa (before a pause) is omitted when it is in the middle of a phrase, especially in the Metro Manila area. The vowel it follows is then lengthened. However, it is preserved in many other dialects.
*The phoneme is an alveolar rhotic that has a free variation between a trill, a flap and an approximant ().
*The phoneme may become a consonant cluster in between vowels such as &quot;sadyâ&quot; .

Glottal stop is not indicated. Glottal stops are most likely to occur when:
*the word starts with a vowel, like &quot;aso&quot; (dog)
*the word includes a dash followed by a vowel, like &quot;mag-aral&quot; (study)
*the word has two vowels next to each other, like &quot;paano&quot; (how)
*the word starts with a prefix followed by a verb that starts with a vowel, like &quot;mag-aayos&quot; ([will] fix)

===Stress and final glottal stop===
Stress is a distinctive feature in Tagalog. Primary stress occurs on either the final or the penultimate syllable of a word. Vowel lengthening accompanies primary or secondary stress except when stress occurs at the end of a word.

Tagalog words are often distinguished from one another by the position of the stress or the presence of a final glottal stop. In formal or academic settings, stress placement and the glottal stop are indicated by a diacritic (&quot;tuldík&quot;) above the final vowel. The penultimate primary stress position (&quot;malumay&quot;) is the default stress type and so is left unwritten except in dictionaries.

==Grammar==
==Writing system==

Tagalog, like other Philippines languages today, is written using the Latin alphabet. Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1521 and the beginning of their colonization in 1565, Tagalog was written in an abugida—or alphasyllabary—called Baybayin. This system of writing gradually gave way to the use and propagation of the Latin alphabet as introduced by the Spanish. As the Spanish began to record and create grammars and dictionaries for the various languages of the Philippine archipelago, they adopted systems of writing closely following the orthographic customs of the Spanish language and were refined over the years. Until the first half of the 20th century, most Philippine languages were widely written in a variety of ways based on Spanish orthography.

In the late 19th century, a number of educated Filipinos began proposing for revising the spelling system used for Tagalog at the time. In 1884, Filipino doctor and student of languages Trinidad Pardo de Tavera published his study on the ancient Tagalog script &quot;Contribucion para el Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos&quot; and in 1887, published his essay &quot;El Sanscrito en la lengua Tagalog&quot; which made use of a new writing system developed by him. Meanwhile, Jose Rizal, inspired by Pardo de Tavera&#x27;s 1884 work, also began developing a new system of orthography (unaware at first of Pardo de Tavera&#x27;s own orthography). A major noticeable change in these proposed orthographies was the use of the letter ⟨k⟩ rather than ⟨c⟩ and ⟨q⟩ to represent the phoneme .

In 1889, the new bilingual Spanish-Tagalog &quot;La España Oriental&quot; newspaper, of which Isabelo de los Reyes was an editor, began publishing using the new orthography stating in a footnote that it would &quot;use the orthography recently introduced by ... learned Orientalis&quot;. This new orthography, while having its supporters, was also not initially accepted by several writers. Soon after the first issue of &quot;La España&quot;, Pascual H. Poblete&#x27;s &quot;Revista Católica de Filipina&quot; began a series of articles attacking the new orthography and its proponents. A fellow writer, Pablo Tecson was also critical. Among the attacks was the use of the letters &quot;k&quot; and &quot;w&quot; as they were deemed to be of German origin and thus its proponents were deemed as &quot;unpatriotic&quot;. The publishers of these two papers would eventually merge as &quot;La Lectura Popular&quot; in January 1890 and would eventually make use of both spelling systems in its articles. Pedro Laktaw, a schoolteacher, published the first Spanish-Tagalog dictionary using the new orthography in 1890.

In April 1890, Jose Rizal authored an article &quot;Sobre la Nueva Ortografia de la Lengua Tagalog&quot; in the Madrid-based periodical La Solidaridad. In it, he addressed the criticisms of the new writing system by writers like Pobrete and Tecson and the simplicity, in his opinion, of the new orthography. Rizal described the orthography promoted by Pardo de Tavera as &quot;more perfect&quot; than what he himself had developed. The new orthography was, however, not broadly adopted initially and was used inconsistently in the bilingual periodicals of Manila until the early 20th century. The revolutionary society Kataás-taasan, Kagalang-galang Katipunan ng̃ mg̃á Anak ng̃ Bayan or Katipunan made use of the k-orthography and the letter k featured prominently on many of its flags and insignias.

In 1937, Tagalog was selected to serve as basis for the country&#x27;s national language. In 1940, the &quot;Balarilâ ng Wikang Pambansâ&quot; () of grammarian Lope K. Santos introduced the Abakada alphabet. This alphabet consists of 20 letters and became the standard alphabet of the national language. The orthography as used by Tagalog would eventually influence and spread to the systems of writing used by other Philippine languages (which had been using variants of the Spanish-based system of writing). In 1987, the Abakada was dropped and replaced by the expanded Filipino alphabet.

===Baybayin===
Tagalog was written in an abugida (alphasyllabary) called Baybayin prior to the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, in the 16th century. This particular writing system was composed of symbols representing three vowels and 14 consonants. Belonging to the Brahmic family of scripts, it shares similarities with the Old Kawi script of Java and is believed to be descended from the script used by the Bugis in Sulawesi.

Although it enjoyed a relatively high level of literacy, Baybayin gradually fell into disuse in favor of the Latin alphabet taught by the Spaniards during their rule.

There has been confusion of how to use Baybayin, which is actually an abugida, or an alphasyllabary, rather than an alphabet. Not every letter in the Latin alphabet is represented with one of those in the Baybayin alphasyllabary. Rather than letters being put together to make sounds as in Western languages, Baybayin uses symbols to represent syllables.

A &quot;kudlít&quot; resembling an apostrophe is used above or below a symbol to change the vowel sound after its consonant. If the kudlit is used above, the vowel is an &quot;E&quot; or &quot;I&quot; sound. If the kudlit is used below, the vowel is an &quot;O&quot; or &quot;U&quot; sound. A special kudlit was later added by Spanish missionaries in which a cross placed below the symbol to get rid of the vowel sound all together, leaving a consonant. Previously, the consonant without a following vowel was simply left out (for example, &quot;bundók&quot; being rendered as &quot;budo&quot;), forcing the reader to use context when reading such words.

Example:


===Latin alphabet===
====Abecedario====
Until the first half of the 20th century, Tagalog was widely written in a variety of ways based on Spanish orthography consisting of 32 letters called &#x27;ABECEDARIO&#x27; (). The additional letters from the 26-letter English alphabet are: ch, ll, ng, ñ, n͠g / ñg, and rr.

====Abakada====

When the national language was based on Tagalog, grammarian Lope K. Santos introduced a new alphabet consisting of 20 letters called &quot;Abakada&quot; in school grammar books called &quot;balarilâ&quot;. The only letter not in the English alphabet is ng.

====Revised alphabet====

In 1987, the Department of Education, Culture and Sports issued a memo stating that the Philippine alphabet had changed from the Pilipino-Tagalog Abakada version to a new 28-letter alphabet to make room for loans, especially family names from Spanish and English. The additional letters from the 26-letter English alphabet are: ñ, ng.

====&quot;ng&quot; and &quot;mga&quot;====

The genitive marker &quot;ng&quot; and the plural marker &quot;mga&quot; (e.g. &quot;Iyan ang mga damít ko.&quot; (Those are my clothes)) are abbreviations that are pronounced &quot;nang&quot; and &quot;mangá&quot; . &quot;Ng&quot;, in most cases, roughly translates to &quot;of&quot; (ex. &quot;Siyá ay kapatíd ng nanay ko.&quot; She is the sibling &quot;of&quot; my mother) while &quot;nang&quot; usually means &quot;when&quot; or can describe how something is done or to what extent (equivalent to the suffix &quot;-ly&quot; in English adverbs), among other uses. 
* &quot;Nang si Hudas ay nadulás.&quot;—When Judas slipped.
* &quot;Gumising siya nang maaga.&quot;—He woke up early.
* &quot;Gumalíng nang si Juan dahil nag-ensayo siyá.&quot;—Juan greatly improved because he practiced.

In the first example, &quot;nang&quot; is used in lieu of the word &quot;noong&quot; (when; &quot;Noong si Hudas ay madulás&quot;). In the second, &quot;nang&quot; describes that the person woke up (&quot;gumising&quot;) early (&quot;maaga&quot;); &quot;gumising nang maaga&quot;. In the third, &quot;nang&quot; described up to what extent that Juan improved (&quot;gumalíng&quot;), which is &quot;greatly&quot; (&quot;nang &quot;). In the latter two examples, the ligature &quot;na&quot; and its variants &quot;-ng&quot; and &quot;-g&quot; may also be used (&quot;Gumising na maaga/Maagang gumising&quot;; &quot;Gumalíng na /Todong gumalíng&quot;).

The longer &quot;nang&quot; may also have other uses, such as a ligature that joins a repeated word:
*&quot;Naghintáy sila nang naghintáy.&quot;—They kept on waiting&quot; (a closer calque: &quot;They were waiting and waiting.&quot;)

===&quot;pô/hô&quot; and &quot;opò/ohò&quot;===
The words originated from the word &quot;.&quot; and &quot;.&quot; (&quot;Lord.&quot;). When combined with the basic affirmative &quot;yes&quot; (from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *heqe), the resulting forms are and .

&quot; and &quot; are specifically used to denote a high level of respect when addressing older persons of close affinity like parents, relatives, teachers and family friends. &quot; and &quot; are generally used to politely address older neighbours, strangers, public officials, bosses and nannies, and may suggest a distance in societal relationship and respect determined by the addressee&#x27;s social rank and not their age. However, &quot; and &quot; can be used in any case in order to express an elevation of respect.
*Example: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Please throw away the trash.&quot;)

Used in the affirmative:
*Ex: &quot;&quot;. (&quot;Are you hungry yet?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot;)

 may also be used in negation.
*Ex: &quot;&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t know that.&quot;)

==Vocabulary and borrowed words==
Tagalog vocabulary is mostly of native Austronesian or Tagalog origin, such as most of the words that end with the diphthong -iw, (e.g. giliw) and words that exhibit reduplication (e.g. halo-halo, patpat, etc.). Besides inherited cognates, this also accounts for innovations in Tagalog vocabulary, especially traditional ones within its dialects. Tagalog has also incorporated many Spanish and English loanwords; the necessity of which increases in more technical parlance.

In precolonial times, Trade Malay was widely known and spoken throughout Maritime Southeast Asia, contributing a significant number of Malay vocabulary into the Tagalog language. Malay loanwords, identifiable or not, may often already be considered native as these have existed in the language before colonisation.

Tagalog also includes loanwords from Indian languages (Sanskrit and Tamil, mostly through Malay), Chinese languages (mostly Hokkien, followed by Cantonese, Mandarin, etc.), Japanese, Arabic and Persian.

English has borrowed some words from Tagalog, such as abaca, barong, balisong, boondocks, jeepney, Manila hemp, pancit, ylang-ylang, and yaya. Some of these loanwords are more often used in Philippine English.

Tagalog has contributed several words to Philippine Spanish, like &quot;barangay&quot; (from &quot;balan͠gay,&quot; meaning &quot;barrio&quot;), the &quot;abacá&quot;, &quot;cogon&quot;, &quot;palay&quot;, &quot;dalaga&quot; etc.
===Tagalog words of foreign origin===
==Taglish (Englog)==


&quot;Taglish&quot; and &quot;Englog&quot; are names given to a mix of English and Tagalog. The amount of English vs. Tagalog varies from the occasional use of English loan words to changing language in mid-sentence. Such code-switching is prevalent throughout the Philippines and in various languages of the Philippines other than Tagalog.

Code-mixing also entails the use of foreign words that are &quot;Filipinized&quot; by reforming them using Filipino rules, such as verb conjugations. Users typically use Filipino or English words, whichever comes to mind first or whichever is easier to use.

Urbanites are the most likely to speak like this.

The practice is common in television, radio, and print media as well. Advertisements from companies like Wells Fargo, Wal-Mart, Albertsons, McDonald&#x27;s and Western Union have contained Taglish.

===Cognates with other Philippine languages===
==Comparisons with Austronesian languages==
Below is a chart of Tagalog and a number of other Austronesian languages comparing thirteen words.

==Religious literature==
Religious literature remains one of the most dynamic components to Tagalog literature. The first Bible in Tagalog, then called &quot;Ang Biblia&quot; (&quot;the Bible&quot;) and now called &quot;Ang Dating Biblia&quot; (&quot;the Old Bible&quot;), was published in 1905. In 1970, the Philippine Bible Society translated the Bible into modern Tagalog. Even before the Second Vatican Council, devotional materials in Tagalog had been in circulation. There are at least four circulating Tagalog translations of the Bible
* the &quot;Magandang Balita Biblia&quot; (a parallel translation of the &quot;Good News Bible&quot;), which is the ecumenical version
* the &quot;Bibliya ng Sambayanang Pilipino&quot;
* the 1905 &quot;Ang Biblia&quot;, used more by Protestants
* the &quot;Bagong Sanlibutang Salin ng Banal na Kasulatan&quot; (&quot;New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures&quot;), exclusive to the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses

When the Second Vatican Council, (specifically the Sacrosanctum Concilium) permitted the universal prayers to be translated into vernacular languages, the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines was one of the first to translate the Roman Missal into Tagalog. The Roman Missal in Tagalog was published as early as 1982. In 2012, the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines revised the 41-year-old liturgy with an English version of the Roman Missal, and later translated it in the vernacular to several native languages in the Philippines. For instance, in 2024, the uses the Tagalog translation of the Roman Missal entitled &quot;Ang Aklat ng Mabuting Balita.&quot;

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were printing Tagalog literature at least as early as 1941 and &quot;The Watchtower&quot; (the primary magazine of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses) has been published in Tagalog since at least the 1950s. New releases are now regularly released simultaneously in a number of languages, including Tagalog. The official website of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses also has some publications available online in Tagalog. The revised bible edition, the &quot;New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,&quot; was released in Tagalog on 2019 and it is distributed without charge both printed and online versions.

Tagalog is quite a stable language, and very few revisions have been made to Catholic Bible translations. Also, as Protestantism in the Philippines is relatively young, liturgical prayers tend to be more ecumenical.

==Example texts==
===Lord&#x27;s Prayer===
In Tagalog, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer is known by its incipit, &quot;Amá Namin&quot; (literally, &quot;Our Father&quot;).

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===
This is Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (&quot;Pangkalahatáng Pagpapahayág ng Karapatáng Pantao&quot;)

;Tagalog (Latin)

;Tagalog (Baybayin)

;English
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

===Numbers===
Numbers (&quot;mga bilang/mga numero&quot;) in Tagalog follow two systems. The first consists of native Tagalog words and the other are Spanish-derived. (This may be compared to other East Asian languages, except with the second set of numbers borrowed from Spanish instead of Chinese.) For example, when a person refers to the number &quot;seven&quot;, it can be translated into Tagalog as &quot;&quot;pitó&quot; or &quot;siyete&quot;&quot; (Spanish: &quot;siete&quot;).

===Months and days===
Months and days in Tagalog are also localised forms of Spanish months and days. &quot;Month&quot; in Tagalog is &quot;buwán&quot; (also the word for moon) and &quot;day&quot; is &quot;araw&quot; (the word also means sun). Unlike Spanish, however, months and days in Tagalog are always capitalised.

===Time===
Time expressions in Tagalog are also Tagalized forms of the corresponding Spanish. &quot;Time&quot; in Tagalog is &quot;panahón&quot; or &quot;oras&quot;.

==Common phrases==


===Proverbs===
&quot;Ang hindî marunong lumingón sa pinánggalingan ay hindî makaráratíng sa paroroonan.&quot; 
:(— José Rizal)
One who knows not how to look back to whence he came will never get to where he is going.

&quot;Unang kagát, tinapay pa rin.&quot;First bite, still bread.All fluff, no substance.

&quot;Tao ka nang humaráp, bilang tao kitáng haharapin.&quot;You reach me as a human, I will treat you as a human and never act as a traitor.(A proverb in Southern Tagalog that has made people aware of the significance of sincerity in Tagalog communities.)

&quot;Hulí man daw (raw) at magalíng, nakáhahábol pa rin.&quot;If one is behind but capable, one will still be able to catch up.

&quot;Magbirô ka na sa lasíng, huwág lang sa bagong gising.&quot;Make fun of someone drunk, if you must, but never one who has just awakened.

&quot;Aanhín pa ang damó kung patáy na ang kabayò?&quot;What use is the grass if the horse is already dead?

&quot;Ang sakít ng kalingkingan, damdám ng buóng katawán.&quot;The pain in the pinkie is felt by the whole body.
In a group, if one goes down, the rest follow.

&quot;Nasa hulí ang pagsisisi.&quot;Regret is always in the end.

&quot;Pagkáhabà-habà man ng prusisyón, sa simbahan pa rin ang tulóy.&quot;The procession may stretch on and on, but it still ends up at the church.
(In romance: refers to how certain people are destined to be married. In general: refers to how some things are inevitable, no matter how long you try to postpone it.)

&quot;Kung &#x27;dî mádaán sa santóng dasalan, daanin sa santóng paspasan.&quot;If it cannot be got through holy prayer, get it through blessed force.
(In romance and courting: &quot;santóng paspasan&quot; literally means &#x27;holy speeding&#x27; and is a euphemism for sexual intercourse. It refers to the two styles of courting by Filipino boys: one is the traditional, protracted, restrained manner favored by older generations, which often featured serenades and manual labor for the girl&#x27;s family; the other is upfront seduction, which may lead to a slap on the face or a pregnancy out of wedlock. The second conclusion is known as &quot;pikot&quot; or what Western cultures would call a &#x27;shotgun marriage&#x27;. This proverb is also applied in terms of diplomacy and negotiation.)

<text>A tokamak (; ) is a device which uses a powerful magnetic field generated by external magnets to confine plasma in the shape of an axially symmetrical torus. The tokamak is one of several types of magnetic confinement devices being developed to produce controlled thermonuclear fusion power. The tokamak concept is currently one of the leading candidates for a practical fusion reactor.

The proposal to use controlled thermonuclear fusion for industrial purposes and a specific scheme using thermal insulation of high-temperature plasma by an electric field was first formulated by the Soviet physicist Oleg Lavrentiev in a mid-1950 paper. In 1951, Andrei Sakharov and Igor Tamm modified the scheme by proposing a theoretical basis for a thermonuclear reactor, where the plasma would have the shape of a torus and be held by a magnetic field.

The first tokamak was built in 1954. In 1968 the electronic plasma temperature of 1 keV was reached on the tokamak T-3, built at the I. V. Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy under the leadership of academician L. A. Artsimovich.

By the mid-1960s, the tokamak designs began to show greatly improved performance. The initial results were released in 1965, but were ignored; Lyman Spitzer dismissed them out of hand after noting potential problems in their system for measuring temperatures. A second set of results was published in 1968, this time claiming performance far in advance of any other machine. When these were also met skeptically, the Soviets invited British scientists from the laboratory in Culham Centre for Fusion Energy (Nicol Peacock et al.) to the USSR with their equipment. Measurements on the T-3 confirmed the results, spurring a worldwide stampede of tokamak construction. It had been demonstrated that a stable plasma equilibrium requires magnetic field lines that wind around the torus in a helix. Devices like the z-pinch and stellarator had attempted this, but demonstrated serious instabilities. It was the development of the concept now known as the safety factor (labelled &quot;q&quot; in mathematical notation) that guided tokamak development; by arranging the reactor so this critical factor &quot;q&quot; was always greater than 1, the tokamaks strongly suppressed the instabilities which plagued earlier designs.

By the mid-1970s, dozens of tokamaks were in use around the world. By the late 1970s, these machines had reached all of the conditions needed for practical fusion, although not at the same time nor in a single reactor. With the goal of breakeven (a fusion energy gain factor equal to 1) now in sight, a new series of machines were designed that would run on a fusion fuel of deuterium and tritium. These machines, notably the Joint European Torus (JET) and Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR), had the explicit goal of reaching breakeven.

Instead, these machines demonstrated new problems that limited their performance. Solving these would require a much larger and more expensive machine, beyond the abilities of any one country. After an initial agreement between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in November 1985, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) effort emerged and remains the primary international effort to develop practical fusion power. Many smaller designs, and offshoots like the spherical tokamak, continue to be used to investigate performance parameters and other issues. , JET remains the record holder for fusion output, with 69 MJ of energy output over a 5-second period.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;tokamak&quot; is a transliteration of the Russian word , an acronym of either:

or:
The term &quot;tokamak&quot; was coined in 1957 by Igor Golovin, a student of academician Igor Kurchatov. It originally sounded like &quot;tokamag&quot; (&quot;токамаг&quot;) — an acronym of the words &quot;&quot;to&quot;roidal &quot;cha&quot;mber magnetic&quot; (&quot;&quot;то&quot;роидальная &quot;ка&quot;мера &quot;маг&quot;нитная&quot;), but Natan Yavlinsky, the author of the first toroidal system, proposed replacing &quot;-mag&quot; with &quot;-mak&quot; for euphony. Later, this name was borrowed by many languages.

== History ==
=== First steps ===
In 1934, Mark Oliphant, Paul Harteck and Ernest Rutherford were the first to achieve fusion on Earth, using a particle accelerator to shoot deuterium nuclei into metal foil containing deuterium or other atoms. This allowed them to measure the nuclear cross section of various fusion reactions, and determined that the deuterium–deuterium reaction occurred at a lower energy than other reactions, peaking at about 100,000 electronvolts (100 keV).

Accelerator-based fusion is not practical because the reactor cross section is tiny; most of the particles in the accelerator will scatter off the fuel, not fuse with it. These scatterings cause the particles to lose energy to the point where they can no longer undergo fusion. The energy put into these particles is thus lost, and it is easy to demonstrate this is much more energy than the resulting fusion reactions can release.

To maintain fusion and produce net energy output, the bulk of the fuel must be raised to high temperatures so its atoms are constantly colliding at high speed; this gives rise to the name &quot;thermonuclear&quot; due to the high temperatures needed to bring it about. In 1944, Enrico Fermi calculated the reaction would be self-sustaining at about 50,000,000 K; at that temperature, the rate that energy is given off by the reactions is high enough that they heat the surrounding fuel rapidly enough to maintain the temperature against losses to the environment, continuing the reaction.

During the Manhattan Project, the first practical way to reach these temperatures was created, using an atomic bomb. In 1944, Fermi gave a talk on the physics of fusion in the context of a then-hypothetical hydrogen bomb. However, some thought had already been given to a &quot;controlled&quot; fusion device, and James L. Tuck and Stanislaw Ulam had attempted such using shaped charges driving a metal foil infused with deuterium, although without success.

The first attempts to build a practical fusion machine took place in the United Kingdom, where George Paget Thomson had selected the pinch effect as a promising technique in 1945. After several failed attempts to gain funding, he gave up and asked two graduate students, Stanley (Stan) W. Cousins and Alan Alfred Ware (1924–2010), to build a device out of surplus radar equipment. This was successfully operated in 1948, but showed no clear evidence of fusion and failed to gain the interest of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment.

=== Lavrentiev&#x27;s letter ===
In 1950, Oleg Lavrentiev, then a Red Army sergeant stationed on Sakhalin, wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The letter outlined the idea of using an atomic bomb to ignite a fusion fuel, and then went on to describe a system that used electrostatic fields to contain a hot plasma in a steady state for energy production.

The letter was sent to Andrei Sakharov for comment. Sakharov noted that &quot;the author formulates a very important and not necessarily hopeless problem&quot;, and found his main concern in the arrangement was that the plasma would hit the electrode wires, and that &quot;wide meshes and a thin current-carrying part which will have to reflect almost all incident nuclei back into the reactor. In all likelihood, this requirement is incompatible with the mechanical strength of the device.&quot;

Some indication of the importance given to Lavrentiev&#x27;s letter can be seen in the speed with which it was processed; the letter was received by the Central Committee on 29 July, Sakharov sent his review in on 18 August, by October, Sakharov and Igor Tamm had completed the first detailed study of a fusion reactor, and they had asked for funding to build it in January 1951.

=== Magnetic confinement ===
When heated to fusion temperatures, the electrons in atoms dissociate, resulting in a fluid of nuclei and electrons known as plasma. Unlike electrically neutral atoms, a plasma is electrically conductive, and can, therefore, be manipulated by electrical or magnetic fields.

Sakharov&#x27;s concern about the electrodes led him to consider using magnetic confinement instead of electrostatic. In the case of a magnetic field, the particles will circle around the lines of force. As the particles are moving at high speed, their resulting paths look like a helix. If one arranges a magnetic field so lines of force are parallel and close together, the particles orbiting adjacent lines may collide, and fuse.

Such a field can be created in a solenoid, a cylinder with magnets wrapped around the outside. The combined fields of the magnets create a set of parallel magnetic lines running down the length of the cylinder. This arrangement prevents the particles from moving sideways to the wall of the cylinder, but it does not prevent them from running out the end. The obvious solution to this problem is to bend the cylinder around into a donut shape, or torus, so that the lines form a series of continual rings. In this arrangement, the particles circle endlessly.

Sakharov discussed the concept with Igor Tamm, and by the end of October 1950 the two had written a proposal and sent it to Igor Kurchatov, the director of the atomic bomb project within the USSR, and his deputy, Igor Golovin. However, this initial proposal ignored a fundamental problem; when arranged along a straight solenoid, the external magnets are evenly spaced, but when bent around into a torus, they are closer together on the inside of the ring than the outside. This leads to uneven forces that cause the particles to drift away from their magnetic lines.

During visits to the Laboratory of Measuring Instruments of the USSR Academy of Sciences (LIPAN), the Soviet nuclear research centre, Sakharov suggested two possible solutions to this problem. One was to suspend a current-carrying ring in the centre of the torus. The current in the ring would produce a magnetic field that would mix with the one from the magnets on the outside. The resulting field would be twisted into a helix, so that any given particle would find itself repeatedly on the outside, then inside, of the torus. The drifts caused by the uneven fields are in opposite directions on the inside and outside, so over the course of multiple orbits around the long axis of the torus, the opposite drifts would cancel out. Alternately, he suggested using an external magnet to induce a current in the plasma itself, instead of a separate metal ring, which would have the same effect.

In January 1951, Kurchatov arranged a meeting at LIPAN to consider Sakharov&#x27;s concepts. They found widespread interest and support, and in February a report on the topic was forwarded to Lavrentiy Beria, who oversaw the atomic efforts in the USSR. For a time, nothing was heard back.

=== Richter and the birth of fusion research ===
On 25 March 1951, Argentine President Juan Perón announced that a former German scientist, Ronald Richter, had succeeded in producing fusion at a laboratory scale as part of what is now known as the Huemul Project. Scientists around the world were excited by the announcement, but soon concluded it was not true; simple calculations showed that his experimental setup could not produce enough energy to heat the fusion fuel to the needed temperatures.

Although dismissed by nuclear researchers, the widespread news coverage meant politicians were suddenly aware of, and receptive to, fusion research. In the UK, Thomson was suddenly granted considerable funding. Over the next months, two projects based on the pinch system were up and running. In the US, Lyman Spitzer read the Huemul story, realized it was false, and set about designing a machine that would work. In May he was awarded $50,000 to begin research on his stellarator concept. Jim Tuck had returned to the UK briefly and saw Thomson&#x27;s pinch machines. When he returned to Los Alamos he also received $50,000 directly from the Los Alamos budget.

Similar events occurred in the USSR. In mid-April, Dmitri Efremov of the Scientific Research Institute of Electrophysical Apparatus stormed into Kurchatov&#x27;s study with a magazine containing a story about Richter&#x27;s work, demanding to know why they were beaten by the Argentines. Kurchatov immediately contacted Beria with a proposal to set up a separate fusion research laboratory with Lev Artsimovich as director. Only days later, on 5 May, the proposal had been signed by Joseph Stalin.

=== New ideas ===

By October, Sakharov and Tamm had completed a much more detailed consideration of their original proposal, calling for a device with a major radius (of the torus as a whole) of and a minor radius (the interior of the cylinder) of . The proposal suggested the system could produce of tritium a day, or breed of U233 a day.

As the idea was further developed, it was realized that a current in the plasma could create a field that was strong enough to confine the plasma as well, removing the need for the external coils. At this point, the Soviet researchers had re-invented the pinch system being developed in the UK, although they had come to this design from a very different starting point.

Once the idea of using the pinch effect for confinement had been proposed, a much simpler solution became evident. Instead of a large toroid, one could simply induce the current into a linear tube, which could cause the plasma within to collapse down into a filament. This had a huge advantage; the current in the plasma would heat it through normal resistive heating, but this would not heat the plasma to fusion temperatures. However, as the plasma collapsed, the adiabatic process would result in the temperature rising dramatically, more than enough for fusion. With this development, only Golovin and Natan Yavlinsky continued considering the more static toroidal arrangement.

=== Instability ===
On 4 July 1952, Nikolai Filippov&#x27;s group measured neutrons being released from a linear pinch machine. Lev Artsimovich demanded that they check everything before concluding fusion had occurred, and during these checks, they found that the neutrons were not from fusion at all. This same linear arrangement had also occurred to researchers in the UK and US, and their machines showed the same behaviour. But the great secrecy surrounding the type of research meant that none of the groups were aware that others were also working on it, let alone having the identical problem.

After much study, it was found that some of the released neutrons were produced by instabilities in the plasma. There were two common types of instability, the &quot;sausage&quot; that was seen primarily in linear machines, and the &quot;kink&quot; which was most common in the toroidal machines. Groups in all three countries began studying the formation of these instabilities and potential ways to address them. Important contributions to the field were made by Martin David Kruskal and Martin Schwarzschild in the US, and Shafranov in the USSR.

One idea that came from these studies became known as the &quot;stabilized pinch&quot;. This concept added additional coils to the outside of the chamber, which created a magnetic field that would be present in the plasma before the pinch discharge. In most concepts, the externally induced field was relatively weak, and because a plasma is diamagnetic, it penetrated only the outer areas of the plasma. When the pinch discharge occurred and the plasma quickly contracted, this field became &quot;frozen in&quot; to the resulting filament, creating a strong field in its outer layers. In the US, this was known as &quot;giving the plasma a backbone&quot;.

Sakharov revisited his original toroidal concepts and came to a slightly different conclusion about how to stabilize the plasma. The layout would be the same as the stabilized pinch concept, but the role of the two fields would be reversed. Instead of weak externally induced magnetic fields providing stabilization and a strong pinch current responsible for confinement, in the new layout, the external field would be much more powerful in order to provide the majority of confinement, while the current would be much smaller and responsible for the stabilizing effect.

=== Steps toward declassification ===
In 1955, with the linear approaches still subject to instability, the first toroidal device was built in the USSR. TMP was a classic pinch machine, similar to models in the UK and US of the same era. The vacuum chamber was made of ceramic, and the spectra of the discharges showed silica, meaning the plasma was not perfectly confined by magnetic field and hitting the walls of the chamber. Two smaller machines followed, using copper shells. The conductive shells were intended to help stabilize the plasma, but were not completely successful in any of the machines that tried it.

With progress apparently stalled, in 1955, Kurchatov called an All Union conference of Soviet researchers with the ultimate aim of opening up fusion research within the USSR. In April 1956, Kurchatov travelled to the UK as part of a widely publicized visit by Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin. He offered to give a talk at Atomic Energy Research Establishment, at the former RAF Harwell, where he shocked the hosts by presenting a detailed historical overview of the Soviet fusion efforts. He took time to note, in particular, the neutrons seen in early machines and warned that neutrons did not mean fusion.

Unknown to Kurchatov, the British ZETA stabilized pinch machine was being built at the far end of the former runway. ZETA was, by far, the largest and most powerful fusion machine to date. Supported by experiments on earlier designs that had been modified to include stabilization, ZETA intended to produce low levels of fusion reactions. This was apparently a great success, and in January 1958, they announced the fusion had been achieved in ZETA based on the release of neutrons and measurements of the plasma temperature.

Vitaly Shafranov and Stanislav Braginskii examined the news reports and attempted to figure out how it worked. One possibility they considered was the use of weak &quot;frozen in&quot; fields, but rejected this, believing the fields would not last long enough. They then concluded ZETA was essentially identical to the devices they had been studying, with strong external fields.

=== First tokamaks ===
By this time, Soviet researchers had decided to build a larger toroidal machine along the lines suggested by Sakharov. In particular, their design considered one important point found in Kruskal&#x27;s and Shafranov&#x27;s works; if the helical path of the particles made them circulate around the plasma&#x27;s circumference more rapidly than they circulated the long axis of the torus, the kink instability would be strongly suppressed.

(To be clear, Electrical current in coils wrapping around the torus produces a toroidal magnetic field inside the torus; a pulsed magnetic field through the hole in the torus induces the axial current in the torus which has a poloidal magnetic field surrounding it; there may also be rings of current above and below the torus that create additional poloidal magnetic field. The combined magnetic fields form a helical magnetic structure inside the torus.)

Today this basic concept is known as the &quot;safety factor&quot;. The ratio of the number of times the particle orbits the major axis compared to the minor axis is denoted &quot;q&quot;, and the &quot;Kruskal-Shafranov Limit&quot; stated that the kink will be suppressed as long as &quot;q&quot; &gt; 1. This path is controlled by the relative strengths of the externally induced magnetic field compared to the field created by the internal current. To have &quot;q&quot; &gt; 1, the external magnets must be much more powerful, or alternatively, the internal current has to be reduced.

Following this criterion, design began on a new reactor, T-1, which today is known as the first real tokamak. T-1 used both stronger external magnetic fields and a reduced current compared to stabilized pinch machines like ZETA. The success of the T-1 resulted in its recognition as the first working tokamak.
For his work on &quot;powerful impulse discharges in a gas, to obtain unusually high temperatures needed for thermonuclear processes&quot;, Yavlinskii was awarded the Lenin Prize and the Stalin Prize in 1958. Yavlinskii was already preparing the design of an even larger model, later built as T-3. With the apparently successful ZETA announcement, Yavlinskii&#x27;s concept was viewed very favourably.

Details of ZETA became public in a series of articles in &quot;Nature&quot; later in January. To Shafranov&#x27;s surprise, the system did use the &quot;frozen in&quot; field concept. He remained sceptical, but a team at the Ioffe Institute in St. Petersberg began plans to build a similar machine known as Alpha. Only a few months later, in May, the ZETA team issued a release stating they had not achieved fusion, and that they had been misled by erroneous measures of the plasma temperature.

T-1 began operation at the end of 1958. It demonstrated very high energy losses through radiation. This was traced to impurities in the plasma due to the vacuum system causing outgassing from the container materials. In order to explore solutions to this problem, another small device was constructed, T-2. This used an internal liner of corrugated metal that was baked at to cook off trapped gasses.

=== Atoms for Peace and the doldrums ===
As part of the second Atoms for Peace meeting in Geneva in September 1958, the Soviet delegation released many papers covering their fusion research. Among them was a set of initial results on their toroidal machines, which at that point had shown nothing of note.

The &quot;star&quot; of the show was a large model of Spitzer&#x27;s stellarator, which immediately caught the attention of the Soviets. In contrast to their designs, the stellarator produced the required twisted paths in the plasma without driving a current through it, using a series of external coils (producing internal magnetic fields) that could operate in the steady state rather than the pulses of the induction system that produced the axial current. Kurchatov began asking Yavlinskii to change their T-3 design to a stellarator, but they convinced him that the current provided a useful second role in heating, something the stellarator lacked.

At the time of the show, the stellarator had suffered a long string of minor problems that were just being solved. Solving these revealed that the diffusion rate of the plasma was much faster than theory predicted. Similar problems were seen in all the contemporary designs, for one reason or another. The stellarator, various pinch concepts and the magnetic mirror machines in both the US and USSR all demonstrated problems that limited their confinement times.

From the first studies of controlled fusion, there was a problem lurking in the background. During the Manhattan Project, David Bohm had been part of the team working on isotopic separation of uranium. In the post-war era he continued working with plasmas in magnetic fields. Using basic theory, one would expect the plasma to diffuse across the lines of force at a rate inversely proportional to the square of the strength of the field, meaning that small increases in force would greatly improve confinement. But based on their experiments, Bohm developed an empirical formula, now known as Bohm diffusion, that suggested the rate was linear with the magnetic force, not its square.

If Bohm&#x27;s formula was correct, there was no hope one could build a fusion reactor based on magnetic confinement. To confine the plasma at the temperatures needed for fusion, the magnetic field would have to be orders of magnitude greater than any known magnet. Spitzer ascribed the difference between the Bohm and classical diffusion rates to turbulence in the plasma, and believed the steady fields of the stellarator would not suffer from this problem. Various experiments at that time suggested the Bohm rate did not apply, and that the classical formula was correct.

But by the early 1960s, with all of the various designs leaking plasma at a prodigious rate, Spitzer himself concluded that the Bohm scaling was an inherent quality of plasmas, and that magnetic confinement would not work. The entire field descended into what became known as &quot;the doldrums&quot;, a period of intense pessimism.

=== Progress in the 1960s ===
In contrast to the other designs, the experimental tokamaks appeared to be progressing well, so well that a minor theoretical problem was now a real concern. In the presence of gravity, there is a small pressure gradient in the plasma, formerly small enough to ignore but now becoming something that had to be addressed. This led to the addition of yet another set of coils in 1962, which produced a vertical magnetic field that offset these effects. These were a success, and by the mid-1960s the machines began to show signs that they were beating the Bohm limit.

At the 1965 Second International Atomic Energy Agency Conference on fusion at the UK&#x27;s newly opened Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, Artsimovich reported that their systems were surpassing the Bohm limit by 10 times. Spitzer, reviewing the presentations, suggested that the Bohm limit may still apply; the results were within the range of experimental error of results seen on the stellarators, and the temperature measurements, based on the magnetic fields, were simply not trustworthy.

The next major international fusion meeting was held in August 1968 in Novosibirsk. By this time two additional tokamak designs had been completed, TM-2 in 1965, and T-4 in 1968. Results from T-3 had continued to improve, and similar results were coming from early tests of the new reactors. At the meeting, the Soviet delegation announced that T-3 was producing electron temperatures of 1000 eV (equivalent to 10 million degrees Celsius) and that confinement time was at least 50 times the Bohm limit.

These results were at least 10 times that of any other machine. If correct, they represented an enormous leap for the fusion community. Spitzer remained skeptical, noting that the temperature measurements were still based on the indirect calculations from the magnetic properties of the plasma. Many concluded they were due to an effect known as runaway electrons, and that the Soviets were measuring only those extremely energetic electrons and not the bulk temperature. The Soviets countered with several arguments suggesting the temperature they were measuring was Maxwellian, and the debate raged.

==== Culham Five ====
In the aftermath of ZETA, the UK teams began the development of new plasma diagnostic tools to provide more accurate measurements. Among these was the use of a laser to directly measure the temperature of the bulk electrons using Thomson scattering. This technique was well known and respected in the fusion community; Artsimovich had publicly called it &quot;brilliant&quot;. Artsimovich invited Bas Pease, the head of Culham, to use their devices on the Soviet reactors. At the height of the Cold War, in what is still considered a major political manoeuvre on Artsimovich&#x27;s part, British physicists were allowed to visit the Kurchatov Institute, the heart of the Soviet nuclear bomb effort.

The British team, nicknamed &quot;The Culham Five&quot;, arrived late in 1968. After a lengthy installation and calibration process, the team measured the temperatures over a period of many experimental runs. Initial results were available by August 1969; the Soviets were correct, their results were accurate. The team phoned the results home to Culham, who then passed them along in a confidential phone call to Washington. The final results were published in &quot;Nature&quot; in November 1969. The results of this announcement have been described as a &quot;veritable stampede&quot; of tokamak construction around the world.

One serious problem remained. Because the electrical current in the plasma was much lower and produced much less compression than a pinch machine, this meant the temperature of the plasma was limited to the resistive heating rate of the current. First proposed in 1950, Spitzer resistivity stated that the electrical resistance of a plasma was reduced as the temperature increased, meaning the heating rate of the plasma would slow as the devices improved and temperatures were pressed higher. Calculations demonstrated that the resulting maximum temperatures while staying within &quot;q&quot; &gt; 1 would be limited to the low millions of degrees. Artsimovich had been quick to point this out in Novosibirsk, stating that future progress would require new heating methods to be developed.

==== US turmoil ====
One of the people attending the Novosibirsk meeting in 1968 was Amasa Stone Bishop, one of the leaders of the US fusion program. One of the few other devices to show clear evidence of beating the Bohm limit at that time was the multipole concept. Both Lawrence Livermore and the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), home of Spitzer&#x27;s stellarator, were building variations on the multipole design. While moderately successful on their own, T-3 greatly outperformed either machine. Bishop was concerned that the multipoles were redundant and thought the US should consider a tokamak of its own.

When he raised the issue at a December 1968 meeting, directors of the labs refused to consider it. Melvin B. Gottlieb of Princeton was exasperated, asking &quot;Do you think that this committee can out-think the scientists?&quot; With the major labs demanding they control their own research, one lab found itself left out. Oak Ridge had originally entered the fusion field with studies for reactor fueling systems, but branched out into a mirror program of their own. By the mid-1960s, their DCX designs were running out of ideas, offering nothing that the similar program at the more prestigious and politically powerful Livermore did not. This made them highly receptive to new concepts.

After a considerable internal debate, Herman Postma formed a small group in early 1969 to consider the tokamak. They came up with a new design, later christened Ormak, that had several novel features. Primary among them was the way the external field was created in a single large copper block, fed power from a large transformer below the torus. This was as opposed to traditional designs that used electric current windings on the outside. They felt the single block would produce a much more uniform field. It would also have the advantage of allowing the torus to have a smaller major radius, lacking the need to route cables through the donut hole, leading to a lower &quot;aspect ratio&quot;, which the Soviets had already suggested would produce better results.

==== Tokamak race in the US ====
In early 1969, Artsimovich visited MIT, where he was hounded by those interested in fusion. He finally agreed to give several lectures in April and then allowed lengthy question-and-answer sessions. As these went on, MIT itself grew interested in the tokamak, having previously stayed out of the fusion field for a variety of reasons. Bruno Coppi was at MIT at the time, and following the same concepts as Postma&#x27;s team, came up with his own low-aspect-ratio concept, Alcator. Instead of Ormak&#x27;s toroidal transformer, Alcator used traditional ring-shaped magnetic field coils but required them to be much smaller than existing designs. MIT&#x27;s Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory was the world leader in magnet design and they were confident they could build them.

During 1969, two additional groups entered the field. At General Atomics, Tihiro Ohkawa had been developing multipole reactors, and submitted a concept based on these ideas. This was a tokamak that would have a non-circular plasma cross-section; the same math that suggested a lower aspect-ratio would improve performance also suggested that a C or D-shaped plasma would do the same. He called the new design Doublet. Meanwhile, a group at University of Texas at Austin was proposing a relatively simple tokamak to explore heating the plasma through deliberately induced turbulence, the Texas Turbulent Tokamak.

When the members of the Atomic Energy Commissions&#x27; Fusion Steering Committee met again in June 1969, they had &quot;tokamak proposals coming out of our ears&quot;. The only major lab working on a toroidal design that was not proposing a tokamak was Princeton, who refused to consider it in spite of their Model C stellarator being just about perfect for such a conversion. They continued to offer a long list of reasons why the Model C should not be converted. When these were questioned, a furious debate broke out about whether the Soviet results were reliable.

Watching the debate take place, Gottlieb had a change of heart. There was no point moving forward with the tokamak if the Soviet electron temperature measurements were not accurate, so he formulated a plan to either prove or disprove their results. While swimming in the pool during the lunch break, he told Harold Furth his plan, to which Furth replied: &quot;well, maybe you&#x27;re right.&quot; After lunch, the various teams presented their designs, at which point Gottlieb presented his idea for a &quot;stellarator-tokamak&quot; based on the Model C.

The Standing Committee noted that this system could be complete in six months, while Ormak would take a year. It was only a short time later that the confidential results from the Culham Five were released. When they met again in October, the Standing Committee released funding for all of these proposals. The Model C&#x27;s new configuration, soon named Symmetrical Tokamak, intended to simply verify the Soviet results, while the others would explore ways to go well beyond T-3.

=== Heating: US takes the lead ===
Experiments on the Symmetric Tokamak began in May 1970, and by early the next year they had confirmed the Soviet results and then surpassed them. The stellarator was abandoned, and PPPL turned its considerable expertise to the problem of heating the plasma. Two concepts seemed to hold promise. PPPL proposed using magnetic compression, a pinch-like technique to compress a warm plasma to raise its temperature, but providing that compression through magnets rather than current. Oak Ridge suggested neutral beam injection, small particle accelerators that would shoot fuel atoms through the surrounding magnetic field where they would collide with the plasma and heat it.

PPPL&#x27;s Adiabatic Toroidal Compressor (ATC) began operation in May 1972, followed shortly thereafter by a neutral-beam equipped Ormak. Both demonstrated significant problems, but PPPL leapt past Oak Ridge by fitting beam injectors to ATC and provided clear evidence of successful heating in 1973. This success &quot;scooped&quot; Oak Ridge, who fell from favour within the Washington Steering Committee.

By this time a much larger design based on beam heating was under construction, the Princeton Large Torus, or PLT. PLT was designed specifically to &quot;give a clear indication whether the tokamak concept plus auxiliary heating can form a basis for a future fusion reactor&quot;. PLT was an enormous success, continually raising its internal temperature until it hit 60 million Celsius (8,000 eV, eight times T-3&#x27;s record) in 1978. This is a key point in the development of the tokamak; fusion reactions become self-sustaining at temperatures between 50 and 100 million Celsius, PLT demonstrated that this was technically achievable.

These experiments, especially PLT, put the US far in the lead in tokamak research. This is due largely to budget; a tokamak cost about $500,000 and the US annual fusion budget was around $25 million at that time. They could afford to explore all of the promising methods of heating, ultimately discovering neutral beams to be among the most effective.

During this period, Robert Hirsch took over the Directorate of fusion development in the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. Hirsch felt that the program could not be sustained at its current funding levels without demonstrating tangible results. He began to reformulate the entire program. What had once been a lab-led effort of mostly scientific exploration was now a Washington-led effort to build a working power-producing reactor. This was given a boost by the 1973 oil crisis, which led to greatly increased research into alternative energy systems.

=== 1980s: great hope, great disappointment ===
By the late-1970s, tokamaks had reached all the conditions needed for a practical fusion reactor; in 1978 PLT had demonstrated ignition temperatures, the next year the Soviet T-7 successfully used superconducting magnets for the first time, Doublet proved to be a success and led to almost all future designs adopting this &quot;shaped plasma&quot; approach. It appeared all that was needed to build a power-producing reactor was to put all of these design concepts into a single machine, one that would be capable of running with the radioactive tritium in its fuel mix.

During the 1970s, four major second-generation proposals were funded worldwide. The Soviets continued their development lineage with the T-15, while a pan-European effort was developing the Joint European Torus (JET) and Japan began the JT-60 effort (originally known as the &quot;Breakeven Plasma Test Facility&quot;). In the US, Hirsch began formulating plans for a similar design, skipping over proposals for another stepping-stone design directly to a tritium-burning one. This emerged as the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR), run directly from Washington and not linked to any specific lab. Originally favouring Oak Ridge as the host, Hirsch moved it to PPPL after others convinced him they would work the hardest on it because they had the most to lose.

The excitement was so widespread that several commercial ventures to produce commercial tokamaks began around this time. Best known among these, in 1978, Bob Guccione, publisher of Penthouse Magazine, met Robert Bussard and became the world&#x27;s biggest and most committed private investor in fusion technology, ultimately putting $20 million of his own money into Bussard&#x27;s Compact Tokamak. Funding by the Riggs Bank led to this effort being known as the Riggatron.

TFTR won the construction race and began operation in 1982, followed shortly by JET in 1983 and JT-60 in 1985. JET quickly took the lead in critical experiments, moving from test gases to deuterium and increasingly powerful &quot;shots&quot;. But it soon became clear that none of the new systems were working as expected. A host of new instabilities appeared, along with a number of more practical problems that continued to interfere with their performance. On top of this, dangerous &quot;excursions&quot; of the plasma hitting with the walls of the reactor were evident in both TFTR and JET. Even when working perfectly, plasma confinement at fusion temperatures, the so-called &quot;fusion triple product&quot;, continued to be far below what would be needed for a practical reactor design.

Through the mid-1980s the reasons for many of these problems became clear, and various solutions were offered. However, these would significantly increase the size and complexity of the machines. A follow-on design incorporating these changes would be both enormous and vastly more expensive than either JET or TFTR. A new period of pessimism descended on the fusion field.

=== ITER ===

At the same time these experiments were demonstrating problems, much of the impetus for the US&#x27;s massive funding disappeared; in 1986 Ronald Reagan declared the 1970s energy crisis was over, and funding for advanced energy sources had been slashed in the early 1980s.

Some thought of an international reactor design had been ongoing since June 1973 under the name INTOR, for INternational TOkamak Reactor. This was originally started through an agreement between Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev, but had been moving slowly since its first real meeting on 23 November 1978.

During the Geneva Summit in November 1985, Reagan raised the issue with Mikhail Gorbachev and proposed reforming the organization. &quot;... The two leaders emphasized the potential importance of the work aimed at utilizing controlled thermonuclear fusion for peaceful purposes and, in this connection, advocated the widest practicable development of international cooperation in obtaining this source of energy, which is essentially inexhaustible, for the benefit for all mankind.&quot;

The next year, an agreement was signed between the US, Soviet Union, European Union and Japan, creating the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor organization.

Design work began in 1988, and since that time the ITER reactor has been the primary tokamak design effort worldwide.

=== High Field Tokamaks ===
It has been known for a long time that stronger field magnets would enable high energy gain in a much smaller tokamak, with concepts such as FIRE, IGNITOR, and the Compact Ignition Tokamak (CIT) being proposed decades ago.

The commercial availability of high temperature superconductors (HTS) in the 2010s opened a promising pathway to building the higher field magnets required to achieve ITER-like levels of energy gain in a compact device. To leverage this new technology, the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC) and MIT spinout Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) successfully built and tested the Toroidal Field Model Coil (TFMC) in 2021 to demonstrate the necessary 20 Tesla magnetic field needed to build SPARC, a device designed to achieve a similar fusion gain as ITER but with only ~1/40th ITER&#x27;s plasma volume.

British startup Tokamak Energy is also planning on building a net-energy tokamak using HTS magnets, but with the spherical tokamak variant.

The joint EU/Japan JT-60SA reactor achieved first plasma on October 23, 2023, after a two-year delay caused by an electrical short.

== Design ==

=== Basic problem ===
Positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons in a fusion plasma are at very high temperatures, and have correspondingly large velocities. In order to maintain the fusion process, particles from the hot plasma must be confined in the central region, or the plasma will rapidly cool. Magnetic confinement fusion devices exploit the fact that charged particles in a magnetic field experience a Lorentz force and follow helical paths along the field lines.

The simplest magnetic confinement system is a solenoid. A plasma in a solenoid will spiral about the lines of field running down its center, preventing motion towards the sides. However, this does not prevent motion towards the ends. The obvious solution is to bend the solenoid around into a circle, forming a torus. However, it was demonstrated that such an arrangement is not uniform; for purely geometric reasons, the field on the outside edge of the torus is lower than on the inside edge. This asymmetry causes the electrons and ions to drift across the field, and eventually hit the walls of the torus.

The solution is to shape the lines so they do not simply run around the torus, but twist around like the stripes on a barber pole or candycane. In such a field any single particle will find itself at the outside edge where it will drift one way, say up, and then as it follows its magnetic line around the torus it will find itself on the inside edge, where it will drift the other way. This cancellation is not perfect, but calculations showed it was enough to allow the fuel to remain in the reactor for a useful time.

=== Tokamak solution ===
The two first solutions to making a design with the required twist were the stellarator which did so through a mechanical arrangement, twisting the entire torus, and the z-pinch design which ran an electrical current through the plasma to create a second magnetic field to the same end. Both demonstrated improved confinement times compared to a simple torus, but both also demonstrated a variety of effects that caused the plasma to be lost from the reactors at rates that were not sustainable.

The tokamak is essentially identical to the z-pinch concept in its physical layout. Its key innovation was the realization that the instabilities that were causing the pinch to lose its plasma could be controlled. The issue was how &quot;twisty&quot; the fields were; fields that caused the particles to transit inside and out more than once per orbit around the long axis torus were much more stable than devices that had less twist. This ratio of twists to orbits became known as the &quot;safety factor&quot;, denoted &quot;q&quot;. Previous devices operated at &quot;q&quot; about , while the tokamak operates at . This increases stability by orders of magnitude.

When the problem is considered even more closely, the need for a vertical (parallel to the axis of rotation) component of the magnetic field arises. The Lorentz force of the toroidal plasma current in the vertical field provides the inward force that holds the plasma torus in equilibrium.

=== Other issues ===
While the tokamak addresses the issue of plasma stability in a gross sense, plasmas are also subject to a number of dynamic instabilities. One of these, the kink instability, is strongly suppressed by the tokamak layout, a side-effect of the high safety factors of tokamaks. The lack of kinks allowed the tokamak to operate at much higher temperatures than previous machines, and this allowed a host of new phenomena to appear.

One of these, the banana orbits, is caused by the wide range of particle energies in a tokamak – much of the fuel is hot, but a certain percentage is much cooler. Due to the high twist of the fields in the tokamak, particles following their lines of force rapidly move towards the inner edge and then outer. As they move inward they are subject to increasing magnetic fields due to the smaller radius concentrating the field. The low-energy particles in the fuel will reflect off this increasing field and begin to travel backwards through the fuel, colliding with the higher energy nuclei and scattering them out of the plasma. This process causes fuel to be lost from the reactor, although this process is slow enough that a practical reactor is still well within reach.

Another instability is tearing instability. In 2024 researchers used reinforcement learning against a multimodal dynamic model to measure and forecast such instabilities based on signals from multiple diagnostics and actuators at 25 millisecond intervals. This forecast was used to reduce tearing instabilities in DIII-D6, in the US. The reward function balanced the conflicting objectives of maximum plasma pressure and instability risks. In particular, the plasma actively tracked the stable path while maintaining H-mode performance.

=== Breakeven, &quot;Q&quot;, and ignition ===
One of the first goals for any controlled fusion device is to reach &quot;breakeven&quot;, the point where the energy being released by the fusion reactions is equal to the amount of energy being used to maintain the reaction. The ratio of output to input energy is denoted &quot;Q&quot;, and breakeven corresponds to a &quot;Q&quot; of 1. A &quot;Q&quot; of more than one is needed for the reactor to generate net energy, but for practical reasons, it is desirable for it to be much higher.

Once breakeven is reached, further improvements in confinement generally lead to a rapidly increasing &quot;Q&quot;. That is because some of the energy being given off by the fusion reactions of the most common fusion fuel, a 50-50 mix of deuterium and tritium, is in the form of alpha particles. These can collide with the fuel nuclei in the plasma and heat it, reducing the amount of external heat needed. At some point, known as &quot;ignition&quot;, this internal self-heating is enough to keep the reaction going without any external heating, corresponding to an infinite &quot;Q&quot;.

In the case of the tokamak, this self-heating process is maximized if the alpha particles remain in the fuel long enough to guarantee they will collide with the fuel. As the alphas are electrically charged, they are subject to the same fields that are confining the fuel plasma. The amount of time they spend in the fuel can be maximized by ensuring their orbit in the field remains within the plasma. It can be demonstrated that this occurs when the electrical current in the plasma is about 3 MA.

=== Advanced tokamaks ===
In the early 1970s, studies at Princeton into the use of high-power superconducting magnets in future tokamak designs examined the layout of the magnets. They noticed that the arrangement of the main toroidal coils meant that there was significantly more tension between the magnets on the inside of the curvature where they were closer together. Considering this, they noted that the tensional forces within the magnets would be evened out if they were shaped like a D, rather than an O. This became known as the &quot;Princeton D-coil&quot;.

This was not the first time this sort of arrangement had been considered, although for entirely different reasons. The safety factor varies across the axis of the machine; for purely geometrical reasons, it is always smaller at the inside edge of the plasma closest to the machine&#x27;s center because the long axis is shorter there. That means that a machine with an average &quot;q&quot; = 2 might still be less than 1 in certain areas. In the 1970s, it was suggested that one way to counteract this and produce a design with a higher average &quot;q&quot; would be to shape the magnetic fields so that the plasma only filled the outer half of the torus, shaped like a D or C when viewed end-on, instead of the normal circular cross section.

One of the first machines to incorporate a D-shaped plasma was the JET, which began its design work in 1973. This decision was made both for theoretical reasons as well as practical; because the force is larger on the inside edge of the torus, there is a large net force pressing inward on the entire reactor. The D-shape also had the advantage of reducing the net force, as well as making the supported inside edge flatter so it was easier to support. Code exploring the general layout noticed that a non-circular shape would slowly drift vertically, which led to the addition of an active feedback system to hold it in the center. Once JET had selected this layout, the General Atomics Doublet III team redesigned that machine into the D-IIID with a D-shaped cross-section, and it was selected for the Japanese JT-60 design as well. This layout has been largely universal since then.

One problem seen in all fusion reactors is that the presence of heavier elements causes energy to be lost at an increased rate, cooling the plasma. During the very earliest development of fusion power, a solution to this problem was found, the &quot;divertor&quot;, essentially a large mass spectrometer that would cause the heavier elements to be flung out of the reactor. This was initially part of the stellarator designs, where it is easy to integrate into the magnetic windings. However, designing a divertor for a tokamak proved to be a very difficult design problem.

Another problem seen in all fusion designs is the heat load that the plasma places on the wall of the confinement vessel. There are materials that can handle this load, but they are generally undesirable and expensive heavy metals. When such materials are sputtered in collisions with hot ions, their atoms mix with the fuel and rapidly cool it. A solution used on most tokamak designs is the &quot;limiter&quot;, a small ring of light metal that projected into the chamber so that the plasma would hit it before hitting the walls. This eroded the limiter and caused its atoms to mix with the fuel, but these lighter materials cause less disruption than the wall materials.

When reactors moved to the D-shaped plasmas it was quickly noted that the escaping particle flux of the plasma could be shaped as well. Over time, this led to the idea of using the fields to create an internal divertor that flings the heavier elements out of the fuel, typically towards the bottom of the reactor. There, a pool of liquid lithium metal is used as a sort of limiter; the particles hit it and are rapidly cooled, remaining in the lithium. This internal pool is much easier to cool, due to its location, and although some lithium atoms are released into the plasma, its very low mass makes it a much smaller problem than even the lightest metals used previously.

As machines began to explore this newly shaped plasma, they noticed that certain arrangements of the fields and plasma parameters would sometimes enter what is now known as the high-confinement mode, or H-mode, which operated stably at higher temperatures and pressures. Operating in the H-mode, which can also be seen in stellarators, is now a major design goal of the tokamak design.

Finally, it was noted that when the plasma had a non-uniform density it would give rise to internal electrical currents. This is known as the &quot;bootstrap current&quot;. This allows a properly designed reactor to generate some of the internal current needed to twist the magnetic field lines without having to supply it from an external source. This has a number of advantages, and modern designs all attempt to generate as much of their total current through the bootstrap process as possible.

By the early 1990s, the combination of these features and others collectively gave rise to the &quot;advanced tokamak&quot; concept. This forms the basis of modern research, including ITER.

=== Plasma disruptions ===
Tokamaks are subject to events known as &quot;disruptions&quot; that cause confinement to be lost in milliseconds. There are two primary mechanisms. In one, the &quot;vertical displacement event&quot; (VDE), the entire plasma moves vertically until it touches the upper or lower section of the vacuum chamber. In the other, the &quot;major disruption&quot;, long wavelength, non-axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamical instabilities cause the plasma to be forced into non-symmetrical shapes, often squeezed into the top and bottom of the chamber.

When the plasma touches the vessel walls it undergoes rapid cooling, or &quot;thermal quenching&quot;. In the major disruption case, this is normally accompanied by a brief increase in plasma current as the plasma concentrates. Quenching ultimately causes the plasma confinement to break up. In the case of the major disruption the current drops again, the &quot;current quench&quot;. The initial increase in current is not seen in the VDE, and the thermal and current quench occurs at the same time. In both cases, the thermal and electrical load of the plasma is rapidly deposited on the reactor vessel, which has to be able to handle these loads. ITER is designed to handle 2600 of these events over its lifetime.

For modern high-energy devices, where plasma currents are on the order of 15 megaamperes in ITER, it is possible the brief increase in current during a major disruption will cross a critical threshold. This occurs when the current produces a force on the electrons that is higher than the frictional forces of the collisions between particles in the plasma. In this event, electrons can be rapidly accelerated to relativistic velocities, creating so-called &quot;runaway electrons&quot; in the relativistic runaway electron avalanche. These retain their energy even as the current quench is occurring on the bulk of the plasma.

When confinement finally breaks down, these runaway electrons follow the path of least resistance and impact the side of the reactor. These can reach 12 megaamps of current deposited in a small area, well beyond the capabilities of any mechanical solution. In one famous case, the Tokamak de Fontenay aux Roses had a major disruption where the runaway electrons burned a hole through the vacuum chamber.

The occurrence of major disruptions in running tokamaks has always been rather high, of the order of a few percent of the total numbers of the shots. In currently operated tokamaks, the damage is often large but rarely dramatic. In the ITER tokamak, it is expected that the occurrence of a limited number of major disruptions will definitively damage the chamber with no possibility to restore the device. The development of systems to counter the effects of runaway electrons is considered a must-have piece of technology for the operational level ITER.

A large amplitude of the central current density can also result in internal disruptions, or sawteeth, which do not generally result in termination of the discharge.

Densities over the Greenwald limit, a bound depending on the plasma current and the minor radius, typically leads to disruptions. It has been exceeded up to factors of 10, but it remains an important concept describing the phenomenology of the transition of the plasma flow, which still needs to be understood.

== Plasma heating ==

In an operating fusion reactor, part of the energy generated will serve to maintain the plasma temperature as fresh deuterium and tritium are introduced. However, in the startup of a reactor, either initially or after a temporary shutdown, the plasma will have to be heated to its operating temperature of greater than 10 keV (over 100 million degrees Celsius). In current tokamak (and other) magnetic fusion experiments, insufficient fusion energy is produced to maintain the plasma temperature, and constant external heating must be supplied. Chinese researchers set up the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) in 2006, which can supposedly sustain a plasma temperature of 100 million degree Celsius for initiating fusion between hydrogen atoms, according to a November 2018 test.

=== Ohmic heating ~ inductive mode ===

Since the plasma is an electrical conductor, it is possible to heat the plasma by inducing a current through it; the induced current that provides most of the poloidal field is also a major source of initial heating.

The heating caused by the induced current is called ohmic (or resistive) heating; it is the same kind of heating that occurs in an electric light bulb or in an electric heater. The heat generated depends on the resistance of the plasma and the amount of electric current running through it. But as the temperature of heated plasma rises, the resistance decreases and ohmic heating becomes less effective. It appears that the maximum plasma temperature attainable by ohmic heating in a tokamak is 20–30 million degrees Celsius. To obtain still higher temperatures, additional heating methods must be used.

The current is induced by continually increasing the current through an electromagnetic winding linked with the plasma torus: the plasma can be viewed as the secondary winding of a transformer. This is inherently a pulsed process because there is a limit to the current through the primary (there are also other limitations on long pulses). Tokamaks must therefore either operate for short periods or rely on other means of heating and current drive.

=== Magnetic compression ===
A gas can be heated by sudden compression. In the same way, the temperature of a plasma is increased if it is compressed rapidly by increasing the confining magnetic field. In a tokamak, this compression is achieved simply by moving the plasma into a region of higher magnetic field (i.e., radially inward). Since plasma compression brings the ions closer together, the process has the additional benefit of facilitating attainment of the required density for a fusion reactor.

Magnetic compression was an area of research in the early &quot;tokamak stampede&quot;, and was the purpose of one major design, the ATC. The concept has not been widely used since then, although a somewhat similar concept is part of the General Fusion design.

=== Neutral-beam injection ===

Neutral-beam injection involves the introduction of high energy (rapidly moving) atoms or molecules into an ohmically heated, magnetically confined plasma within the tokamak.

The high energy atoms originate as ions in an arc chamber before being extracted through a high voltage grid set. The term &quot;ion source&quot; is used to generally mean the assembly consisting of a set of electron emitting filaments, an arc chamber volume, and a set of extraction grids. A second device, similar in concept, is used to separately accelerate electrons to the same energy. The much lighter mass of the electrons makes this device much smaller than its ion counterpart. The two beams then intersect, where the ions and electrons recombine into neutral atoms, allowing them to travel through the magnetic fields.

Once the neutral beam enters the tokamak, interactions with the main plasma ions occur. This has two effects. One is that the injected atoms re-ionize and become charged, thereby becoming trapped inside the reactor and adding to the fuel mass. The other is that the process of being ionized occurs through impacts with the rest of the fuel, and these impacts deposit energy in that fuel, heating it.

This form of heating has no inherent energy (temperature) limitation, in contrast to the ohmic method, but its rate is limited to the current in the injectors. Ion source extraction voltages are typically on the order of 50–100 kV, and high voltage, negative ion sources (-1 MV) are being developed for ITER. The ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility in Padova will be the first ITER facility to start operation.

While neutral beam injection is used primarily for plasma heating, it can also be used as a diagnostic tool and in feedback control by making a pulsed beam consisting of a string of brief 2–10 ms beam blips. Deuterium is a primary fuel for neutral beam heating systems and hydrogen and helium are sometimes used for selected experiments.

=== Radio-frequency heating ===

High-frequency electromagnetic waves are generated by oscillators (often by gyrotrons or klystrons) outside the torus. If the waves have the correct frequency (or wavelength) and polarization, their energy can be transferred to the charged particles in the plasma, which in turn collide with other plasma particles, thus increasing the temperature of the bulk plasma. Various techniques exist including electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) and ion cyclotron resonance heating. This energy is usually transferred by microwaves.

== Particle inventory ==
Plasma discharges within the tokamak&#x27;s vacuum chamber consist of energized ions and atoms. The energy from these particles eventually reaches the inner wall of the chamber through radiation, collisions, or lack of confinement. The heat from the particles is removed via conduction through the chamber&#x27;s inner wall to a water-cooling system, where the heated water proceeds to an external cooling system through convection.

Turbomolecular or diffusion pumps allow for particles to be evacuated from the bulk volume and cryogenic pumps, consisting of a liquid helium-cooled surface, serve to effectively control the density throughout the discharge by providing an energy sink for condensation to occur. When done correctly, the fusion reactions produce large amounts of high energy neutrons. Being electrically neutral and relatively tiny, the neutrons are not affected by the magnetic fields nor are they stopped much by the surrounding vacuum chamber.

The neutron flux is reduced significantly at a purpose-built neutron shield boundary that surrounds the tokamak in all directions. Shield materials vary but are generally materials made of atoms which are close to the size of neutrons because these work best to absorb the neutron and its energy. Good candidate materials include those with much hydrogen, such as water and plastics. Boron atoms are also good absorbers of neutrons. Thus, concrete and polyethylene doped with boron make inexpensive neutron shielding materials.

Once freed, the neutron has a relatively short half-life of about 10 minutes before it decays into a proton and electron with the emission of energy. When the time comes to actually try to make electricity from a tokamak-based reactor, some of the neutrons produced in the fusion process would be absorbed by a liquid metal blanket and their kinetic energy would be used in heat transfer processes to ultimately turn a generator.

<doc id="31440" wikidata="Q1361731" url="?curid=31440" title="Turbopump">
<text>A turbopump is a propellant pump with two main components: a rotodynamic pump and a driving gas turbine, usually both mounted on the same shaft, or sometimes geared together. They were initially developed in Germany in the early 1940s. The purpose of a turbopump is to produce a high-pressure fluid for feeding a combustion chamber or other use. While other use cases exist, they are most commonly found in liquid rocket engines.

There are two common types of pumps used in turbopumps: a centrifugal pump, where the pumping is done by throwing fluid outward at high speed, or an axial-flow pump, where alternating rotating and static blades progressively raise the pressure of a fluid.

Axial-flow pumps have small diameters but give relatively modest pressure increases. Although multiple compression stages are needed, axial flow pumps work well with low-density fluids. Centrifugal pumps are far more powerful for high-density fluids but require large diameters for low-density fluids.

==History==
=== Early development ===
High-pressure pumps for larger missiles had been discussed by rocket pioneers such as Hermann Oberth. In mid-1935 Wernher von Braun initiated a fuel pump project at the southwest German firm &quot;Klein, Schanzlin &amp; Becker&quot; that was experienced in building large fire-fighting pumps. The V-2 rocket design used hydrogen peroxide decomposed through a Walter steam generator to power the uncontrolled turbopump produced at the Heinkel plant at Jenbach, so V-2 turbopumps and combustion chamber were tested and matched to prevent the pump from overpressurizing the chamber. The first engine fired successfully in September, and on August 16, 1942, a trial rocket stopped in mid-air and crashed due to a failure in the turbopump. The first successful V-2 launch was on October 3, 1942. 

Starting from the 1938-1940, Robert H. Goddard&#x27;s team also independently developed small turbopumps.

=== Development from 1947 to 1949 ===

The principal engineer for turbopump development at Aerojet was George Bosco. During the second half of 1947, Bosco and his group learned about the pump work of others and made preliminary design studies. Aerojet representatives visited Ohio State University where Florant was working on hydrogen pumps, and consulted Dietrich Singelmann, a German pump expert at Wright Field. Bosco subsequently used Singelmann&#x27;s data in designing Aerojet&#x27;s first hydrogen pump.

By mid-1948, Aerojet had selected centrifugal pumps for both liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. They obtained some German radial-vane pumps from the Navy and tested them during the second half of the year.

By the end of 1948, Aerojet had designed, built, and tested a liquid hydrogen pump (15 cm diameter). Initially, it used ball bearings that were run clean and dry, because the low temperature made conventional lubrication impractical. The pump was first operated at low speeds to allow its parts to cool down to operating temperature. When temperature gauges showed that liquid hydrogen had reached the pump, an attempt was made to accelerate from 5000 to 35 000 revolutions per minute. The pump failed and examination of the pieces pointed to a failure of the bearing, as well as the impeller. After some testing, super-precision bearings, lubricated by oil that was atomized and directed by a stream of gaseous nitrogen, were used. On the next run, the bearings worked satisfactorily but the stresses were too great for the brazed impeller and it flew apart. A new one was made by milling from a solid block of aluminum. The next two runs with the new pump were a great disappointment; the instruments showed no significant flow or pressure rise. The problem was traced to the exit diffuser of the pump, which was too small and insufficiently cooled during the cool-down cycle so that it limited the flow. This was corrected by adding vent holes in the pump housing; the vents were opened during cool down and closed when the pump was cold. With this fix, two additional runs were made in March 1949 and both were successful. Flow rate and pressure were found to be in approximate agreement with theoretical predictions. The maximum pressure was 26 atmospheres () and the flow was 0.25 kilogram per second.

===After 1949===
The Space Shuttle main engine&#x27;s turbopumps spun at over 30,000 rpm, delivering 150 lb (68 kg) of liquid hydrogen and 896 lb (406 kg) of liquid oxygen to the engine per second. The Electron Rocket&#x27;s Rutherford became the first engine to use an electrically-driven pump in flight in 2018.

==Centrifugal turbopumps==

Most turbopumps are centrifugal - the fluid enters the pump near the axis and the rotor accelerates the fluid to high speed. The fluid then passes through a volute or a diffuser, which is a ring with multiple diverging channels. This causes an increase in dynamic pressure as fluid velocity is lost. The volute or diffuser turns the high kinetic energy into high pressures (hundreds of bars is not uncommon), and if the outlet backpressure is not too high, high flow rates can be achieved.

==Axial turbopumps==
Axial turbopumps also exist. In this case the axle essentially has propellers attached to the shaft, and the fluid is forced by these parallel with the main axis of the pump. Generally, axial pumps tend to give much lower pressures than centrifugal pumps, and a few bars is not uncommon. Their advantage is a much higher volumetric flowrate. For this reason they are common for pumping liquid hydrogen in rocket engines, because of its much lower density than other propellants which usually use centrifugal pump designs. Axial pumps are also commonly used as &quot;inducers&quot; for centrifugal pumps, which raise the inlet pressure of the centrifugal pump enough to prevent excessive cavitation from occurring therein.

== Complexities of centrifugal turbopumps ==

Turbopumps have a reputation for being extremely hard to design to get optimal performance. Whereas a well engineered and debugged pump can manage 70–90% efficiency, figures less than half that are not uncommon. Low efficiency may be acceptable in some applications, but in rocketry this is a severe problem. Turbopumps in rockets are important and problematic enough that launch vehicles using one have been caustically described as a &quot;turbopump with a rocket attached&quot;–up to 55% of the total cost has been ascribed to this area.

Common problems include:
#excessive flow from the high-pressure rim back to the low-pressure inlet along the gap between the casing of the pump and the rotor,
#excessive recirculation of the fluid at inlet,
#excessive vortexing of the fluid as it leaves the casing of the pump,
#damaging cavitation to impeller blade surfaces in low-pressure zones.

In addition, the precise shape of the rotor itself is critical.

== Driving turbopumps ==
Steam turbine-powered turbopumps are employed when there is a source of steam, e.g. the boilers of steam ships. Gas turbines are usually used when electricity or steam is not available and place or weight restrictions permit the use of more efficient sources of mechanical energy.

One of such cases are rocket engines, which need to pump fuel and oxidizer into their combustion chamber. This is necessary for large liquid rockets, since forcing the fluids or gases to flow by simple pressurizing of the tanks is often not feasible; the high pressure needed for the required flow rates would need strong and thereby heavy tanks.

Ramjet motors are also usually fitted with turbopumps, the turbine being driven either directly by external freestream ram air or internally by airflow diverted from combustor entry. In both cases the turbine exhaust stream is dumped overboard.

<doc id="31441" wikidata="Q931155" url="?curid=31441" title="Tragedy of the anticommons">
<text>The tragedy of the anticommons is a type of coordination breakdown, in which a commons does not emerge, even when general access to resources or infrastructure would be a social good. It is a mirror-image of the older concept of tragedy of the commons, in which numerous rights holders&#x27; combined use exceeds the capacity of a resource and depletes or destroys it. The &quot;tragedy of the anticommons&quot; covers a range of coordination failures, including patent thickets and submarine patents. Overcoming these breakdowns can be difficult, but there are assorted means, including eminent domain, laches, patent pools, or other licensing organizations.

The two &#x27;tragedies&#x27; may be compared as follows:
* The &#x27;tragedy of the commons&#x27; occurs when a resource has many users, none of whom own it, and thus none of whom have the ability to exclude others from using it, leading to the over-utilization of that resource.
* The &#x27;tragedy of the anticommons&#x27; occurs when a resource has many owners, all of whom have the ability to exclude others from using it, leading to the under-utilization of that resource.

The term originally appeared in Michael Heller&#x27;s 1998 article of the same name and is the thesis of his 2008 book. The model was formalized by James M. Buchanan and Yong Yoon. In a 1998 &quot;Science&quot; article, Heller and Rebecca S. Eisenberg, while not disputing the role of patents in general in motivating invention and disclosure, argue that biomedical research was one of several key areas where competing patent rights could actually prevent useful and affordable products from reaching the marketplace.

==Examples==

In early aviation, the Wright brothers held patents on certain aspects of aircraft, while Glenn Curtiss held patents on ailerons which was an advance on the Wrights&#x27; system, but antipathy between the patent holders prevented their use. The government was forced to step in and create a patent pool during World War I.

In his 1998 &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; article, Michael Heller noted that there were a lot of open air kiosks but also a lot of empty stores in many Eastern European cities after the fall of Communism. Upon investigation, he concluded that it was difficult or even impossible for a startup retailer to negotiate successfully for the use of that space because many different agencies and private parties had rights over the use of store space. Even though all the persons with ownership rights were losing money with the empty stores, and stores were in great demand, competing interests got in the way.

Heller says that the rise of the &quot;robber barons&quot; in medieval Germany was the result of the tragedy of the anticommons. Nobles commonly attempted to collect tolls on stretches of the Rhine passing by or through their fiefs, building towers alongside the river and stretching iron chains to prevent boats from carrying cargo up and down the river without paying a fee. Repeated attempts by the Holy Roman Empire, including several over the centuries by the Emperor, to regulate toll collection on the Rhine failed. And it was not until the establishment of the &quot;Rhine League&quot; of the Emperor with certain nobles and clergy that the &quot;Robber barons&quot; control over the Rhine was crushed. River tolls on the Rhine, increasingly imposed by states rather than individual lords, remained a sticking point in relations and commerce in the Rhine basin until the establishment of the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine in 1815.

Heller and Rebecca S. Eisenberg are academic law professors who believe that biological patents create a &quot;tragedy of the anticommons&quot;, &quot;in which people underuse scarce resources because too many owners can block each other.&quot; Others claim that patents have not created this &quot;anticommons&quot; effect on research, based on surveys of scientists.

The housing crisis in many western cities can also be characterized as a tragedy of the anticommons. Zoning and planning processes give neighborhood groups, environmental groups and other stakeholders significant power over whether new housing projects move forward and on what terms. This creates a situation where many stakeholders have the right to exclude others from use of a private resource. In many cases zoning and planning processes make it impossible for private landholders to construct new housing, especially multi-family housing. This results in high prices, reduced inventory and significant homelessness.

The Institute of Medicine highlighted an example of the tragedy of the anticommons in the context of data sharing clinical trial data in the medical field. Some notable challenges included protecting patient privacy, balancing conflicting interests, lack of standardization in data, ensuring data quality and integrity, and legal and regulatory barriers, which all contributed to issues regarding coordination and collaboration down the line. This exemplifies the tragedy of the anticommons because the lower potential efficiency of clinical operation, as well as the satisfaction of patients, is compromised due to an underutilization of clinical data. 

The ongoing legal battles between Apple Inc. and Samsung can be viewed as an example of the tragedy of the anticommons, specifically in intellectual property rights. Both Apple and Samsung own numerous patents related to mobile devices, and the 10-year long legal dispute has been centred around patent infringement. This situation is a prime example of the tragedy of the anticommons, in the sense where many owners of a resource have the ability to exclude others from using it, leading to the underutilization of that resource. Apple Inc. and Samsung&#x27;s limitations on their ability to innovate is an overall detriment to them, as well as the common people. 

Several patent disputes halted the production of the COVID-19 vaccine during its inception. Some notable cases include Pfizer vs. Moderna, Bharat Biotech vs. Serum Institute of India, and Moderna vs. Arbutus. These three cases are potentially a case of the tragedy of the anticommons. While the COVID-19 vaccine response was relatively quick, this was primarily due to scientists, doctors, ethics approval boards, manufacturers and regulatory agencies moving quickly in the state of emergency. A patent dispute, in the sense of the tragedy of the anticommons, may have slowed down the production process, and limited the technology available, to competing firms. Patent disputes related to the COVID-19 vaccine are complex and often involve multiple parties and legal jurisdictions. The issues involved can be highly technical and may take years to resolve.
