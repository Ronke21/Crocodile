<text>The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) was a United Nations trust territory in Micronesia administered by the United States from 1947 to 1994. The Imperial Japanese South Seas Mandate had been seized by the U.S. during the Pacific War, as Japan had administered the territory since the League of Nations gave Japan a mandate over the area from Imperial Germany after World War I. However, in the 1930s, Japan left the League of Nations and invaded additional lands. During World War II, military control of the islands was disputed, but by the war&#x27;s end, the islands had come under the Allies&#x27; control. The Trust Territory of the Pacific was created to administer the islands as part of the United States while still under the auspices of the United Nations. Most of the island groups in the territory became independent states, with some degree of association kept with the United States: the Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands and Palau are independent states in a Compact of Free Association with the U.S., while the Northern Mariana Islands remain under U.S. jurisdiction, as an unincorporated territory and commonwealth.

==History==

Spain initially claimed the islands that later composed the territory of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI). Subsequently, Germany established competing claims over the islands. The competing claims were eventually resolved in favor of Germany when Spain, following its loss of several possessions to the United States during the Spanish–American War, ceded its claims over the islands to Germany pursuant to the German–Spanish Treaty (1899). Germany, in turn, continued to retain possession until the islands were captured by Japan during World War I. The League of Nations formally placed the islands in the former South Seas Mandate, a mandate that authorized Japanese administration of the islands. The islands then remained under Japanese control until captured by the United States in 1944 during World War II.

The TTPI entered UN trusteeship pursuant to Security Council Resolution 21 on July 18, 1947, and was designated a &quot;strategic area&quot; in its 1947 trusteeship agreement. Article 83 of the UN Charter provided that, as such, its formal status as a UN trust territory could be terminated only by the Security Council and not by the General Assembly as with other trust territories. The United States Navy controlled the TTPI from a headquarters in Guam until 1951, when the United States Department of the Interior took over control, administering the territory from a base in Saipan.

The Territory contained 100,000 people scattered over a water area the size of the continental United States. It was subdivided into six districts and represented a variety of cultures, with nine spoken languages. The Pohnpeians and Kosraeans, Marshallese and Palauans, Chuukese, Yapese and Chamorros had little in common, except they were in the same general area of the Pacific Ocean.

The large distances between people, the lack of an economy, and language and cultural barriers all worked against the union. The six district centers became upscale slums, containing deteriorated Japanese-built roads, electricity, modern music, and distractions, which alienated youth and elders. The remainder of the islands maintained their traditional way of life and infrastructure.

In the late 1960s, the U.S. opposed the idea of eventual independence. Instead, they aimed for some form of association, perhaps with Hawaii. They estimated that perhaps 10-25% of the population favored independence.
A Congress of Micronesia first levied an income tax in 1971. It affected mainly foreigners working at military bases in the region.

On October 21, 1986, the U.S. ended its administration of the Marshall Islands District. The termination of U.S. administration of the Chuuk, Yap, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and the Mariana Islands districts of the TTPI soon followed on November 3, 1986. The Security Council formally ended the trusteeship for the Chuuk, Yap, Kosrae, Pohnpei, Mariana Islands, and Marshall Islands districts on December 22, 1990, pursuant to Security Council Resolution 683. On May 25, 1994, the Council ended the trusteeship for the Palau District pursuant to Security Council Resolution 956, after which the U.S. and Palau agreed to establish the latter&#x27;s independence on October 1.

==Geography==
In 1969, the 100 occupied islands comprised over an area of of sea. The latter area was comparable in size to the continental United States. The water area is about 5% of the Pacific Ocean.

==Demographics==
The islands&#x27; population was 200,000 in the latter part of the 19th century. The population decreased to 100,000 by 1969 due to emigration, war, and disease. At that time, the population inhabited less than 100 out of 2,141 of the Marshall, Mariana, and Caroline Islands.

* 1958: 70,724 
* 1970: 90,940 

==Education==
In 1947, the Mariana Islands&#x27; Teacher Training School (MITTS), a normal school serving all areas of the Trust Territory, opened in Guam. It moved to Chuuk in 1948, to be more central in the Trust Territory, and was renamed Pacific Islands&#x27; Teacher Training School (PITTS). It transitioned from being a normal school to a comprehensive secondary school, so it was renamed the Pacific Islands Central School (PICS). The school moved to Pohnpei in 1959. It was a three-year institution housing students who graduated from intermediate schools. The school, later known as Pohnpei Island Central School (PICS), is now Bailey Olter High School.

Palau Intermediate School, established in 1946, became Palau High School in 1962 as it added senior high grades. From the late 1960s to the middle of the 1970s, several public high schools were built or received additions in the Trust Territory. They included Jaluit High School, Kosrae High School, Marshall Islands High School in Majuro, Palau High, PICS, and Truk High School (now Chuuk High School). The Micronesian Occupational College in Koror, Palau, was also built. It later merged with the Kolonia-based Community College of Micronesia, which began operations in 1969, into the College of Micronesia-FSM in 1976.

==Current status==
Following the termination of the trusteeship, the territory of the former TTPI became four separate jurisdictions:

===Sovereign states in free association with the United States===
The following sovereign states have become freely associated with the United States under the Compact of Free Association (COFA).
* – established 1979, COFA effective October 21, 1986
* – established 1979, COFA effective November 3, 1986
* – established 1981, COFA effective October 1, 1994

===Commonwealth in political union with the United States===
* – new constitution partially effective January 1, 1978, and fully effective November 4, 1986.

<doc id="31128" wikidata="Q206844" url="?curid=31128" title="Theobromine">
<text>Theobromine, also known as xantheose, is the principal alkaloid of &quot;Theobroma cacao&quot; (cacao plant). Theobromine is slightly water-soluble (330 mg/L) with a bitter taste. In industry, theobromine is used as an additive and precursor to some cosmetics. It is found in chocolate, as well as in a number of other foods, including tea (&quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;), some American hollies (yaupon and guayusa) and the kola nut. It is a white or colourless solid, but commercial samples can appear yellowish.

==Structure==
Theobromine is a flat molecule, a derivative of purine and an isomer of theophylline. It is also classified as a dimethyl xanthine. Related compounds include theophylline, caffeine, paraxanthine, and 7-methylxanthine, each of which differ in the number or placement of the methyl groups.

==History==
Theobromine was first discovered in 1841 in cacao beans by the chemist A. Woskresensky. Synthesis of theobromine from xanthine was first reported in 1882 by Hermann Emil Fischer.

==Etymology==
&quot;Theobromine&quot; is derived from &quot;Theobroma&quot;, the name of the genus of the cacao tree, with the suffix &quot;-ine&quot; given to alkaloids and other basic nitrogen-containing compounds. That name in turn is made up of the Greek roots &quot;theo&quot; (&quot;god&quot;) and &quot;broma&quot; (&quot;food&quot;), meaning &quot;food of the gods&quot;.

Despite its name, the compound contains no bromine, which is based on Greek &quot;bromos&quot; (&quot;stench&quot;).

==Sources==
Theobromine is the primary alkaloid found in cocoa and chocolate. Cocoa butter only contains trace amounts of theobromine. There are usually higher concentrations in dark than in milk chocolate.

There are approximately of theobromine in of milk chocolate, while the same amount of dark chocolate contains about . Cocoa beans naturally contain approximately 1% theobromine.

Plant species and components with substantial amounts of theobromine are:

* &quot;Theobroma cacao&quot; – seed and seed coat
* &quot;Theobroma bicolor&quot; – seed coat
* &quot;Ilex paraguariensis&quot; – leaf
* &quot;Ilex guayusa&quot; – leaf
* &quot;Ilex vomitoria&quot; – leaf
* &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; – leaf

Theobromine can also be found in trace amounts in the kola nut, the guarana berry, yerba mate (&quot;Ilex paraguariensis&quot;), and the tea plant.

The mean theobromine concentrations in cocoa and carob products are:

===Biosynthesis===
Theobromine is a purine alkaloid derived from xanthosine, a nucleoside. Cleavage of the ribose and N-methylation yields 7-methylxanthosine. 7-Methylxanthosine in turn is the precursor to theobromine, which in turn is the precursor to caffeine.

==Pharmacology==

Even without dietary intake, theobromine may occur in the body as it is a product of the human metabolism of caffeine, which is metabolised in the liver into 12% theobromine, 4% theophylline, and 84% paraxanthine.

In the liver, theobromine is metabolized into xanthine and subsequently into methyluric acid. Important enzymes include CYP1A2 and CYP2E1. The elimination half life of theobromine is between 6 and 8 hours.

Unlike caffeine, which is highly water-soluble, theobromine is only slightly water-soluble and is more fat soluble, and thus peaks more slowly in the blood. While caffeine peaks after only 30 minutes, theobromine requires 2–3 hours to peak.

The primary mechanism of action for theobromine inside the body is inhibition of adenosine receptors. Its effect as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor is thought to be small.

==Effects==
===Humans===
Theobromine is a heart stimulator and diuretic but has no significant stimulant effect on the human central nervous system. It is a bronchodilator and causes relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. It is available as a prescription drug in South Korea. The amount of theobromine found in chocolate is small enough that chocolate can, in general, be safely consumed by humans.

Compared with caffeine, theobromine is weaker in both its inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases and its antagonism of adenosine receptors. The potential phosphodiesterase inhibitory effect of theobromine is seen only at amounts much higher than what people normally would consume in a typical diet including chocolate.

====Toxicity====
At doses of 0.8–1.5 g/day (50–100 g cocoa), sweating, trembling and severe headaches were noted, with limited mood effects found at 250 mg/day.

Also, chocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because theobromine may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus.

===Animals===
Theobromine is the reason chocolate is poisonous to dogs. Dogs and other animals that metabolize theobromine (found in chocolate) more slowly can succumb to theobromine poisoning from as little as of milk chocolate for a smaller dog and , or around nine small milk chocolate bars, for an average-sized dog. The concentration of theobromine in dark chocolates (about ) is up to 10 times that of milk chocolate (), meaning dark chocolate is far more toxic to dogs per unit weight or volume than milk chocolate.

The median lethal dose of theobromine for dogs is ; therefore, a dog would need to consume a minimum of of the most theobromine-rich () dark chocolate, or a maximum of (of theobromine-rich milk chocolate), to have a 50% chance of receiving a lethal dose. However, even of milk chocolate may induce vomiting and diarrhea.

The same risk is reported for cats as well, although cats are less likely to ingest sweet food, as cats lack sweet taste receptors. Complications include digestive issues, dehydration, excitability, and a slow heart rate. Later stages of theobromine poisoning include epileptic-like seizures and death. If caught early on, theobromine poisoning is treatable. Although not common, the effects of theobromine poisoning can be fatal.

<text>Thuringia, officially the Free State of Thuringia, is one of Germany&#x27;s 16 states. With 2.1 million people, it is 12th-largest by population, and with 16,171 square kilometers, it is 11th-largest in area.

Erfurt is the capital and largest city. Other cities include Jena, Gera and Weimar. Thuringia is bordered by Bavaria, Hesse, Lower Saxony, Saxony, and Saxony-Anhalt. It has been known as &quot;the green heart of Germany&quot; () from the late 19th century due to its broad, dense forest. Most of Thuringia is in the Saale drainage basin, a left-bank tributary of the Elbe.

Thuringia is home to the Rennsteig, Germany&#x27;s best-known hiking trail. Its winter resort of Oberhof makes it a well-equipped winter sports destination – half of Germany&#x27;s 136 Winter Olympic gold medals had been won by Thuringian athletes as of 2014. Thuringia was favoured by or was the birthplace of three key intellectuals and leaders in the arts: Johann Sebastian Bach, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Friedrich Schiller. The state has the University of Jena, the Ilmenau University of Technology, the University of Erfurt, and the Bauhaus University of Weimar.

The Frankish Duchy of Thuringia was established around 631 AD by King Dagobert I. The modern state was established in 1920 by the Weimar Republic through a merger of the Ernestine duchies, save for Saxe-Coburg. After World War II, Thuringia came under the Soviet occupation zone in Allied-occupied Germany, and its borders were reformed, to become contiguous. Thuringia became part of the German Democratic Republic in 1949, but was dissolved in 1952 during administrative reforms, and divided into the Districts of Erfurt, Suhl and Gera. Thuringia was re-established in 1990 following German reunification, slightly re-drawn, and became one of the new states of the Federal Republic of Germany.

== Etymology and symbols ==

The name &quot;Thuringia&quot; or &quot;Thüringen&quot; derives from the Germanic tribe Thuringii, who emerged during the Migration Period. Their origin is largely unknown. An older theory claims that they were successors of the Hermunduri, but later research rejected the idea. Other historians argue that the Thuringians were allies of the Huns, came to central Europe together with them, and lived before in what is Galicia today. Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus first mentioned the Thuringii around 400; during that period, the Thuringii were famous for their excellent horses.

The Thuringian Realm existed until after 531. The Landgraviate of Thuringia was the largest state in the region, persisting between 1131 and 1247. Afterwards the state known as Thuringia ceased to exist; nevertheless the term commonly described the region between the Harz mountains in the north, the White Elster river in the east, the Franconian Forest in the south and the Werra river in the west. After the Treaty of Leipzig, Thuringia had its own dynasty again, the Ernestine Wettins. Their various lands formed the Free State of Thuringia, founded in 1920, together with some other small principalities. The Prussian territories around Erfurt, Mühlhausen and Nordhausen joined Thuringia in 1945.

The coat of arms of Thuringia shows the lion of the Ludowingian Landgraves of 12th-century origin. The eight stars around it represent the eight former states which formed Thuringia. The flag of Thuringia is a white-red bicolor, derived from the white and red stripes of the Ludowingian lion. The coat of arms and flag of Hesse are quite similar to the Thuringian ones, since they are also derived from the Ludowingian symbols.

Symbols of Thuringia in popular culture are the &quot;Bratwurst&quot; and the Forest, because a large amount of the territory is forested.

==History==

Named after the Thuringii Germanic tribe who occupied it around AD 300, Thuringia came under Frankish domination in the 6th century.

Thuringia became a landgraviate in 1130 AD. After the extinction of the reigning Ludowingian line of counts and landgraves in 1247 and the War of the Thuringian Succession (1247–1264), the western half became independent under the name of &quot;Hesse&quot;, never to become a part of Thuringia again. Most of the remaining Thuringia came under the rule of the Wettin dynasty of the nearby Margraviate of Meissen, the nucleus of the later Electorate and Kingdom of Saxony. With the division of the house of Wettin in 1485, Thuringia went to the senior Ernestine branch of the family, which subsequently subdivided the area into a number of smaller states, according to the Saxon tradition of dividing inheritance amongst male heirs. These were the &quot;Saxon duchies&quot;, consisting, among others, of the states of Saxe-Weimar, Saxe-Eisenach, Saxe-Jena, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg, and Saxe-Gotha.

Thuringia generally accepted the Protestant Reformation, and Roman Catholicism was suppressed as early as 1520; priests who remained loyal to it were driven away and churches and monasteries were largely destroyed, especially during the German Peasants&#x27; War of 1525. In Mühlhausen and elsewhere, the Anabaptists found many adherents. Thomas Müntzer, a leader of some non-peaceful groups of this sect, was active in this city. Within the borders of modern Thuringia the Roman Catholic faith only survived in the Eichsfeld district, which was ruled by the Archbishop of Mainz, and to a small degree in Erfurt and its immediate vicinity.

===Early modern period===
The modern German black-red-gold tricolour flag&#x27;s first appearance anywhere in a German-ethnicity sovereign state, within what today comprises Germany, occurred in 1778 as the state flag of the Principality of Reuss-Greiz, a defunct principality in the modern state&#x27;s borders.
Some reordering of the Thuringian states occurred during the German Mediatisation from 1795 to 1814, and the territory was included within the Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine organized in 1806. The 1815 Congress of Vienna confirmed these changes and the Thuringian states&#x27; inclusion in the German Confederation; the Kingdom of Prussia also acquired some Thuringian territory and administered it within the Province of Saxony. The Thuringian duchies which became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany were Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and the two principalities of Reuss Elder Line and Reuss Younger Line.

===Free State of Thuringia===

In 1920, after World War I, these small states merged into one state, called the Free State of Thuringia (&quot;Freistaat Thüringen&quot;); only Saxe-Coburg voted to join Bavaria instead. Weimar became the new capital. The coat of arms of this new state was simpler than those of its predecessors. The &quot;Landtag&quot; of the newly established state first convened in 1920 in Weimar. Its deputies were elected for three years according to proportional representation, with a minimum voting age of 21. Between 1920 and 1932, under the Weimar Republic, six &quot;Landtag&quot; elections were held.

Thuringia was one of the states where the Nazi Party first gained real political power during the Weimar Republic. Wilhelm Frick was appointed Minister of the Interior in the state coalition government after the Nazi Party won six deputies to the Thuringian &quot;Landtag&quot; in the December 1929 election. In this position, he removed from the Thuringian police force anyone he suspected of being a republican and replaced them with men who were favourable towards the Nazis. He also ensured that, whenever an important position came up within Thuringia, a Nazi was given that post. Following the Nazi seizure of power in Berlin, the &quot;Landtag&quot; was formally abolished as a result of the &quot;Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich&quot; of 30 January 1934, which replaced the German federal system with a unitary state. Thuringia was the location of the Buchenwald concentration camp with multiple subcamps.
After being controlled briefly by the US following the end of the Second World War, from July 1945 the state of Thuringia came under the Soviet occupation zone and was expanded to include parts of Prussian Saxony, such as the areas around Erfurt, Mühlhausen, and Nordhausen. Erfurt became the new capital of Thuringia. Ostheim, an exclave of &quot;Landkreis&quot; Eisenach, was ceded to Bavaria.

In 1952, the German Democratic Republic dissolved its states, and created districts () instead. The three districts that shared the former territory of Thuringia were Erfurt, Gera and Suhl. Altenburg Kreis was part of Leipzig Bezirk.

The present State of Thuringia was recreated with slightly altered borders during German reunification in 1990.

==Geography==

=== Topography ===
From the northwest going clockwise; Thuringia borders on the German states of Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, Bavaria and Hesse.

The landscapes of Thuringia are quite diverse. The far north is occupied by the Harz mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as most important river. The north-west includes the Eichsfeld, a hilly and sometimes forested region, where the Leine river emanates. The central and northern part of Thuringia is defined by the wide Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and flat area around the Unstrut river and completely surrounded by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): Dün, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffhäuser, Hohe Schrecke, Schmücke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, Hörselberge and Hainich. Within the Basin the smaller hill chains Fahner Höhe and Heilinger Höhen. South of the Thuringian Basin is the state&#x27;s largest mountain range, marked by the Thuringian Forest in the north-west, the Thuringian Highland in the middle and the Franconian Forest in the south-east. Most of this range is forested and the Großer Beerberg (983 m) is Thuringia&#x27;s highest mountain. To the south-west, the Forest is followed up by Werra river valley, dividing it from the Rhön Mountains in the west and the Grabfeld plain in the south. Eastern Thuringia, commonly described as the area east of Saale and Loquitz valley, is marked by a hilly landscape, rising slowly from the flat north to the mountainous south. The Saale in the west and the White Elster in the east are the two big rivers running from south to north and forming densely settled valleys in this area. Between them lies the flat and forested Holzland in the north, the flat and fertile Orlasenke in the middle and the Vogtland, a hilly but in most parts non-forested region in the south. The far eastern region (east of White Elster) is the Osterland or Altenburger Land along Pleiße river, a flat, fertile and densely settled agricultural area.

There are two large rivers in Thuringia. The Saale, a tributary of the Elbe, with its tributaries the Unstrut, Ilm and White Elster, drains the most part of Thuringia. The Werra – the headwater of the Weser – drains the south-west and west of the state. Furthermore, some small areas on the southern border are drained by tributaries of the Main, itself a tributary of the Rhine. There are no large natural lakes in Thuringia, but it does have some of Germany&#x27;s biggest dams, including the Bleiloch Dam and the Hohenwarte Dam on the River Saale, as well as the Leibis-Lichte Dam and the Goldisthal Pumped Storage Station in the Thuringian Highlands. Thuringia is Germany&#x27;s only state with no connection to navigable waterways.

The geographic centre of the Federal Republic is in Thuringia, within the municipality of Vogtei next to Mühlhausen. The centre of Thuringia is eight kilometres south of the capital&#x27;s Cathedral, in the municipality of Rockhausen.

=== Climate ===
Thuringia&#x27;s climate is temperate with humid westerly winds predominating. Increasingly as one moves from the north-west to the south-east, the climate shows continental features: winters can be cold for long periods, and summers can become warm. Dry periods are often recorded, especially within the Thuringian Basin, leeward to mountains in all directions. It is Germany&#x27;s driest area, with annual precipitation of only 400 to 500 mm.

Artern, in the north-east, is warm and dry, with a mean annual temperature of 8.5 °C and mean precipitation of 450 mm; contrast this with wet, cool Oberhof, in the Thuringian Forest, where temperature averages only 4.4 °C and mean annual precipitation reaches 1300 mm.

=== Nature and environment ===
Due to many centuries of intensive settlement, most of the area is shaped by human influence. The original natural vegetation of Thuringia is forest with beech as its predominant species, as can still be found in the Hainich mountains today. In the uplands, a mixture of beech and spruce would be natural. However, most of the plains have been cleared and are in intensive agricultural use while most of the forests are planted with spruce and pine. Since 1990, Thuringia&#x27;s forests have been managed aiming for a more natural and tough vegetation more resilient to climate change as well as diseases and vermin. In comparison to the forest, agriculture is still quite conventional and dominated by large structures and monocultures. Problems here are caused especially by increasingly prolonged dry periods during the summer months.

Environmental damage in Thuringia has been reduced to a large extent after 1990. The condition of forests, rivers and air was improved by modernizing factories, houses (decline of coal heating) and cars, and contaminated areas such as the former Uranium surface mines around Ronneburg have been remediated. Today&#x27;s environmental problems are the salination of the Werra river, caused by discharges of K+S salt mines around Unterbreizbach and overfertilisation in agriculture, damaging the soil and small rivers.

Environment and nature protection has been of growing importance and attention since 1990. Large areas, especially within the forested mountains, are protected as natural reserves, including Thuringia&#x27;s first national park within the Hainich mountains, founded in 1997, the Rhön Biosphere Reserve, the Thuringian Forest Nature Park and the South Harz Nature Park.

== Demographics ==

=== Demographic history ===
During the Middle Ages, Thuringia was at the border between Germanic and Slavic territories, marked by the Saale river. The main Slavic tribe in what is now Thuringia were the Sorbs proper, who unified all tribes in what is now southern half of Eastern Germany. The Ostsiedlung movement led to the assimilation of Slavic people between the 11th and the 13th century under German rule. The population growth increased during the 18th century and stayed high until World War I, before it slowed within the 20th century and changed to a decline since 1990. Since the beginning of Urbanisation around 1840, the Thuringian cities have higher growth rates resp. smaller rates of decline than rural areas (many villages lost half of their population since 1950, whereas the biggest cities (Erfurt and Jena) kept growing).
The 1981 census projected that Thuringia&#x27;s population would reach 2,221,222 by 2011. The population counted in the 2011 census was 2,181,603, which is about 1.78% less.
=== Current population ===
The current population is 2,120,237 (31 December 2020) with an annual rate of decrease of about 0.5%, which varies widely between the local regions. In 2012, 905,000 Thuringians lived in a municipality with more than 20,000 inhabitants, this is an urbanization rate of 42% which continues to rise.

In July 2013, there were 41,000 non-Germans by citizenship living in Thuringia (1.9% of the population − among the smallest proportions of any state in Germany). Nevertheless, the number rose from 33,000 in July 2011, an increase of 24% in only two years. About 4% of the population are migrants (including persons that already received German citizenship). The biggest groups of foreigners by citizenship are (as of 2012): Russians (3,100), Poles (3,000), Turks (2,100) and Ukrainians (2,000). The number of foreigners varies between regions: the college towns Erfurt, Jena, Weimar and Ilmenau have the highest rates, whereas there are almost no migrants living in the most rural smaller municipalities.

The Thuringian population has a significant sex ratio gap, caused by the emigration of young women, especially in rural areas. Overall, there are 115 to 120 men per 100 women in the 25–40 age group (&quot;family founders&quot;) which has negative consequences for the birth ratio. Furthermore, the population is getting older and older with some rural municipalities recording more than 30% of over-65s (pensioners). This is a problem for the regional labour market, as there are twice as many people leaving as entering the job market annually.

=== Natural and spatial tendencies ===
The birth rate was about 1.8 children per women in the 1970s and 1980s, shrinking to 0.8 in 1994 during the economic crisis after the reunification and rose again to more than 1.4 children in 2010, which is a higher level than in West Germany. Nevertheless, there are only 17,000 births compared to 27,000 deaths per year, so that the annual natural change of the Thuringian population is about −0.45%. In 2015 there were 17,934 births, the highest number since 1990.

Migration plays an important role in Thuringia. The internal migration shows a strong tendency from rural areas towards the big cities. From 2008 to 2012, there was a net migration from Thuringia to Erfurt of +6,700 persons (33 per 1000 inhabitants), +1,800 to Gera (19 per 1000), +1,400 to Jena (14 per 1000), +1,400 to Eisenach (33 per 1000) and +1,300 to Weimar (21 per 1000). Between Thuringia and the other German states, the balance is negative: In 2012, Thuringia lost 6,500 persons to other federal states, the most to Bavaria, Saxony, Hesse and Berlin. Only with Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg the balance is positive. The international migration is fluctuating heavily. In 2009, the balance was +700, in 2010 +1,800, in 2011 +2,700 and in 2012 +4,800. The most important countries of origin of the Thuringia migrants from 2008 to 2012 were Poland (+1,700), Romania (+1,200), Afghanistan (+1,100) and Serbia/Montenegro/Kosovo (+1,000), whereas the balance was negative with Switzerland (−2,800) and Austria (−900).

=== Cities, towns and villages ===

Of the approximately 850 municipalities of Thuringia, 126 are classed as towns (within a district) or cities (forming their own urban district). Most of the towns are small with a population of less than 10,000; only the ten biggest ones have a population greater than 30,000. The first towns emerged during the 12th century, whereas the latest ones received town status only in the 20th century. Today, all municipalities within districts are equal in law, whether they are towns or villages. Independent cities (i.e. urban districts) have greater powers (the same as any district) than towns within a district.

* Average annual change in percent within the last three years (13 December 2009 to 31 December 2012), adjusted from incorporations and the 2011 Census results.

=== Religion ===

Since the Protestant Reformation, the most prominent Christian denomination in Thuringia has been Lutheranism. During the GDR period, church membership was discouraged and has continued shrinking since the reunification in 1990. Today over two thirds of the population is non-religious. The Protestant Church in Germany has had the largest number of members in the state, adhered to by 20.8% of the population in 2018. Members of the Catholic Church formed 7.6% of the population, while 71.6% of Thuringians were non-religious or adhere to other faiths. The highest Protestant concentrations are in the small villages of southern and western Thuringia, whereas the bigger cities are even more non-religious (up to 88% in Gera). Catholic regions are Eichsfeld in the northwest and parts of the Rhön Mountains around Geisa in the southwest. Protestant church membership is shrinking rapidly, whereas the Catholic Church is somewhat more stable because of Catholic migration from Poland, Southern Europe and West Germany. Other religions play no significant role in Thuringia. There are only a few thousand Muslims (largely migrants) and about 750 Jews (mostly migrants from Russia) living in Thuringia. Furthermore, there are some Orthodox communities of Eastern European migrants and some traditional Protestant Free churches in Thuringia without any societal influence.

The Protestant parishes of Thuringia belong to the Evangelical Church in Central Germany or to the Evangelical Church of Hesse Electorate-Waldeck (Schmalkalden region). Catholic dioceses are Erfurt (most of Thuringia), Dresden-Meissen (eastern parts) and Fulda (Rhön around Geisa in the very west).

==Politics==
===National===
Thuringia is a stronghold for the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD), the party emerged as the largest in Thuringia in the 2021 national elections. In 2017 the party got 22.7%, in 2021 they got 24.0%, and in 2025 they surged to 38.6%.

===State===
Thuringia is notable for being the first and only state in Germany where the communist party that ruled former East Germany until 1989, The Left (Die Linke), and the new Alternative for Germany (AfD) have seen their first-ever first place finish in a state election. Die Linke in 2019, and the AfD in 2024.

====List of minister-presidents of Thuringia====
====September 2024 state election====

The Alternative for Germany (AfD) became the largest party with 33% of the vote (and 36% of the seats), its best ever performance and the first time it placed first in a state election in Germany. The incumbent governing coalition suffered dramatic losses; the Left had split up, with new Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) becoming the more popular part, while the remaining Left lost more than half of its support and fell to fourth place on 13%. The 130+ year old SPD, which since late 2021 rules Germany under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, recorded its worst result in any postwar state election, barely passing the electoral threshold of 5%. The other two parties of the traffic light coalition in Berlin, Greens and the Free Democratic Party (FDP), did not pass the threshold and lost all of their seats, which contributed to the break-up of that coalition on November 6th. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) recorded small gains and came second with 24%. The newly-founded Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance BSW debuted in third place at 16%.

The AfD in Thuringia became the first far-right party in Germany since World War II to win a state election. However, they were left out of the governing coalition, which is made up of the CDU, the BSW and the SPD, with the Left offering &quot;constructive opposition&quot; (basically they offer some input on the coalition&#x27;s agenda and provide necessary votes).
=== Local government ===
Thuringia is divided into 17 districts (&quot;Landkreise&quot;):
* Altenburger Land
* Eichsfeld
* Gotha
* Greiz
* Hildburghausen
* Ilm-Kreis
* Kyffhäuserkreis
* Nordhausen
* Saale-Holzland-Kreis
* Saale-Orla-Kreis
* Saalfeld-Rudolstadt
* Schmalkalden-Meiningen
* Sömmerda
* Sonneberg
* Unstrut-Hainich-Kreis
* Wartburgkreis
* Weimarer Land


Furthermore, there are five urban districts:

* Erfurt (EF)
* Gera (G)
* Jena (J)
* Suhl (SHL)
* Weimar (WE)

== Economy ==

Thuringia&#x27;s economy is marked by the economic transition that happened after the German reunification and led to the closure of most of the factories within the Land. The unemployment rate reached a peak in 2005. Since that year, the economy has seen an upturn and the general economic situation has improved.

=== Agriculture and forestry ===
Agriculture and forestry have declined in importance over the decades. Nevertheless, they are more important than in most other areas of Germany, especially within rural regions. 54% of Thuringia&#x27;s territory is in agricultural use. The fertile basins such as the large Thuringian Basin or the smaller Goldene Aue, Orlasenke and Osterland are in intensive use for growing cereals, vegetables, fruits and energy crops. Important products are apples, strawberries, cherries and plums in the fruit sector, cabbage, potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes (grown in greenhouses), onions, cucumbers and asparagus in the vegetable sector, as well as maize, rapeseed, wheat, barley and sugar beets in the crop sector.

Meat production and processing is also an important activity, with swine, cattle, chickens and turkeys in focus. Furthermore, there are many milk and cheese producers, as well as laying hens. Trout and carp are traditionally bred in aquaculture in many villages.

Most agricultural enterprises are large cooperatives, founded as Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaft during the GDR period, and meat producers are part of multinational companies. Traditional private peasant agriculture is an exception, as is organic farming.

Thuringia&#x27;s only wine-growing district is around Bad Sulza north of Weimar and Jena along the Ilm and Saale valley. Its production is marketed as Saale-Unstrut wines.

Forestry plays an important role in Thuringia because 32% of the Thuringian territory is forested. The most common trees are spruce, pine and beech. There are many wood and pulp-paper factories near the forested areas.

=== Industry and mining ===
Like most other regions of central and southern Germany, Thuringia has a significant industrial sector reaching back to the mid-19th-century industrialisation. The economic transition after the German reunification in 1990 led to the closure of most large-scale factories and companies, leaving small and medium-sized ones to dominate the manufacturing sector. Well-known industrial centres are Jena (a world centre for optical instruments with companies like Carl Zeiss, Schott and Jenoptik) and Eisenach, where BMW started its car production in the 1920s and an Opel factory is based today. The most important industrial branches today are engineering and metalworking, vehicle production and food industries. Especially the small and mid-sized towns in central and southwestern Thuringia (e.g. Arnstadt, Schmalkalden and Ohrdruf) are highly industrialised, whereas there are fewer industrial companies in the northern and eastern parts of the Land. Traditional industries like production of glass, porcelain and toys collapsed during the economic crises between 1930 and 1990.

Mining was important in Thuringia since the later Middle Ages, especially within the mining towns of the Thuringian Forest such as Schmalkalden, Suhl and Ilmenau. Following the industrial revolution, the old iron, copper and silver mines declined because the competition from imported metal was too strong. On the other hand, the late 19th century brought new types of mines to Thuringia: the lignite surface mining around Meuselwitz near Altenburg in the east of the Land started in the 1870s, and two potash mining districts were established around 1900. These are the &quot;Südharzrevier&quot; in the north of the state, between Bischofferode in the west and Roßleben in the east with Sondershausen at its centre, and the &quot;Werrarevier&quot; on the Hessian border around Vacha and Bad Salzungen in the west. Together, they accounted for a significant part of the world&#x27;s potash production in the mid-20th century. After the reunification, the &quot;Südharzrevier&quot; was abandoned, whereas K+S took over the mines in the &quot;Werrarevier&quot;. Between 1950 and 1990, uranium mining was also important to cover the Soviet Union&#x27;s need for this metal. The centre was Ronneburg near Gera in eastern Thuringia and the operating company Wismut was under direct Soviet control.

=== General economic parameters ===
The GDP of Thuringia is below the national average, in line with the other former East German Lands. Until 2004, Thuringia was one of the weakest regions within the European Union. The accession of several new countries, the crisis in southern Europe and the sustained economic growth in Germany since 2005 has brought the Thuringian GDP close to the EU average since then. The high economic subsidies granted by the federal government and the EU after 1990 are being reduced gradually and will end around 2020.

The unemployment rate reached its peak of 17.1% in 2005. Since then, it has decreased to 5.3% in 2019, which is only slightly above the national average. The decrease is caused on the one hand by the emergence of new jobs and on the other by a marked decrease in the working-age population, caused by emigration and low birth rates for decades. The wages in Thuringia are low compared to rich bordering Lands like Hesse and Bavaria. Therefore, many Thuringians are working in other German Lands and even in Austria and Switzerland as weekly commuters. Nevertheless, the demographic transition in Thuringia leads to a lack of workers in some sectors. External immigration into Thuringia has been encouraged by the government since about 2010 to counter this problem.

The economic progress is quite different between the regions of Thuringia. The big cities along the A4 motorway such as Erfurt, Jena and Eisenach and their surroundings are booming, whereas nearly all the rural regions, especially in the north and east, have little economic impetus and employment, which is a big issue in regional planning. Young people in these areas often have to commute long distances, and many emigrate soon after finishing school.

The unemployment rate stood at 5.9% in 2023 and was higher than the German average.
=== Tourism ===
Tourism is an important branch of the economy. Thuringia has a number of well known destinations: Wartburg castle (UNESCO World Heritage Site), Classical Weimar (UNESCO World Heritage Site), Bauhaus Weimar (UNESCO World Heritage Site), Thuringian Forest, Oberhof or Rennsteig (ridge walk). City tourism with the centers of Erfurt, Weimar, Jena, Eisenach and Mühlhausen is experiencing dynamic growth. A total of around 9.2 million overnight stays were booked in 2016, compared to 8.3 million ten years earlier. Around 6% of the bookings were made by foreign guests.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transport ===

As Germany&#x27;s most central state, Thuringia is an important hub of transit traffic. The transportation infrastructure was in very poor condition after the GDR period. Since 1990, many billions of Euros have been invested to improve the condition of roads and railways within Thuringia.

During the 1930s, the first two motorways were built across the Land, the A4 motorway as an important east–west connection in central Germany and the main link between Berlin and south-west Germany, and the A9 motorway as the main north–south route in eastern Germany, connecting Berlin with Munich. The A4 runs from Frankfurt in Hesse via Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera to Dresden in Saxony, connecting Thuringia&#x27;s most important cities. At Hermsdorf junction it is connected with the A9. Both highways were widened from four to six lanes (three each way) after 1990, including some extensive re-routing in the Eisenach and Jena areas. Furthermore, three new motorways were built during the 1990s and 2000s. The A71 crosses the Land in southwest–northeast direction, connecting Würzburg in Bavaria via Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt and Sömmerda with Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt. The crossing of the Thuringian Forest by the A71 has been one of Germany&#x27;s most expensive motorway segments with various tunnels (including Germany&#x27;s longest road tunnel, the Rennsteig Tunnel) and large bridges. The A73 starts at the A71 south of Erfurt in Suhl and runs south towards Nuremberg in Bavaria. The A38 is another west–east connection in the north of Thuringia running from Göttingen in Lower Saxony via Heiligenstadt and Nordhausen to Leipzig in Saxony. Furthermore, there is a dense network of federal highways complementing the motorway network. The upgrading of federal highways is prioritised in the federal trunk road programme 2015 (&quot;Bundesverkehrswegeplan&quot; 2015). Envisaged projects include upgrades of the B247 from Gotha to Leinefelde to improve Mühlhausen&#x27;s connection to the national road network, the B19 from Eisenach to Meiningen to improve access to Bad Salzungen and Schmalkalden, and the B88 and B281 for strengthening the Saalfeld/Rudolstadt region.

The first railways in Thuringia had been built in the 1840s and the network of main lines was finished around 1880. By 1920, many branch lines had been built, giving Thuringia one of the densest rail networks in the world before World War II with about 2,500 km of track. Between 1950 and 2000 most of the branch lines were abandoned, reducing Thuringia&#x27;s network by half compared to 1940. On the other hand, most of the main lines were refurbished after 1990, resulting in improved speed of travel. The most important railway lines at present are the Thuringian Railway, connecting Halle and Leipzig via Weimar, Erfurt, Gotha and Eisenach with Frankfurt and Kassel and the Saal Railway from Halle/Leipzig via Jena and Saalfeld to Nuremberg. The former has an hourly ICE/IC service from Dresden to Frankfurt while the latter is served hourly by ICE trains from Berlin to Munich. In 2017, a new high speed line will be opened, diverting long-distance services from these mid-19th century lines. Both ICE routes will then use the Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway, and the Berlin-Munich route will continue via the Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed railway. Only the segment west of Erfurt of the Frankfurt-Dresden line will continue to be used by ICE trains after 2017, with an increased line speed of 200 km/h (currently 160 km/h). Erfurt&#x27;s central station, which was completely rebuilt for this purpose in the 2000s (decade), will be the new connection between both ICE lines. The most important regional railway lines in Thuringia are the Neudietendorf–Ritschenhausen railway from Erfurt to Würzburg and Meiningen, the Weimar–Gera railway from Erfurt to Chemnitz, the Sangerhausen–Erfurt railway from Erfurt to Magdeburg, the Gotha–Leinefelde railway from Erfurt to Göttingen, the Halle–Kassel railway from Halle via Nordhausen to Kassel and the Leipzig–Hof railway from Leipzig via Altenburg to Zwickau and Hof. Most regional and local lines have hourly service, but some run only every other hour.

A few small airports are in Thuringia. In public transport is Erfurt–Weimar Airport, used for charter flights to the Mediterranean and other holiday destinations. In private flights, Leipzig–Altenburg Airport is a further key airport.

International hub airports are Frankfurt Airport, Berlin Brandenburg Airport and Munich Airport in adjacent states.

Thuringia is the only state without barge or ship waterways; its rivers are too small to be navigable to them.

=== Energy and water supply ===
The traditional energy supply of Thuringia is lignite, mined in the bordering Leipzig region. Since 2000, the importance of environmentally unfriendly lignite combustion has declined in favour of renewable energies, which reached an amount of 40% (in 2013), and more clean gas combustion, often carried out as cogeneration in the municipal power stations. The most important forms of renewable energies are wind power and biomass, followed by solar energy and hydroelectricity. Furthermore, Thuringia hosts two big pumped storage stations: the Goldisthal Pumped Storage Station and the Hohenwarte Dam.

The water supply is granted by the big dams, like the Leibis-Lichte Dam, within the Thuringian Forest and the Thuringian Highland, making a drinking water exporter of Thuringia.

=== Health ===
Health care provision in Thuringia improved after 1990, as did the level of general health. Life expectancy rose, nevertheless it is still a bit lower than the German average. This is caused by a relatively unhealthy lifestyle of the Thuringians, especially in high consumption of grains, industrial seed oils, refined carbohydrates and alcohol, which led to significant higher rates of obesity compared to the German average.

Health care in Thuringia is currently undergoing a concentration process. Many smaller hospitals in the rural towns are closing, whereas the bigger ones in centres like Jena and Erfurt get enlarged. Overall, there is an oversupply of hospital beds, caused by rationalisation processes in the German health care system, so that many smaller hospitals generate losses. On the other hand, there is a lack of family doctors, especially in rural regions with increased need of health care provision because of overageing.

== Education ==
In Germany, the educational system is part of the sovereignty of the Länder; therefore each Land has its own school and college system.

=== School system ===
The Thuringian school system was developed after the reunification in 1990, combining some elements of the former GDR school system with the Bavarian school system. Most German school rankings attest that Thuringia has one of the most successful education systems in Germany, resulting in high-quality outcomes.

Early-years education is quite common in Thuringia. Since the 1950s, nearly all children have been using the service, whereas early-years education is less developed in western Germany. Its inventor Friedrich Fröbel lived in Thuringia and founded the world&#x27;s first Kindergartens there in the 19th century. The Thuringian primary school takes four years and most primary schools are all-day schools offering optional extracurricular activities in the afternoon. At the age of ten, pupils are separated according to aptitude and proceed to either the Gymnasium or the . The former leads to the Abitur exam after a further eight years and prepares for higher education, while the latter has a more vocational focus and finishes with exams after five or six years, comparable to the Hauptschule and Realschule found elsewhere in Germany.

Thuringia is home to a K-12 international school in the city of Weimar, Thuringia International School (ThIS). The school was established in the year 2000 and is accredited by the Council of International Schools and authorised to offer the International Baccalaureate PYP, MYP and DP. Students who graduate from the school are able to gain admission to colleges and universities around the world.

== Universities ==

The German higher education system comprises two forms of academic institutions: universities and polytechnics (). The University of Jena is the biggest amongst Thuringia&#x27;s four universities and offers nearly every discipline. It was founded in 1558, and today has 21,000 students. The second-largest is the Technische Universität Ilmenau with 7,000 students, founded in 1894, which offers many technical disciplines such as engineering and mathematics. The University of Erfurt, founded in 1392, has 5,000 students today and an emphasis on humanities and teacher training. The Bauhaus University Weimar with 4,000 students is Thuringia&#x27;s smallest university, specialising in creative subjects such as architecture and arts. It was founded in 1860 and came to prominence as Germany&#x27;s leading art school during the inter-war period, the Bauhaus.

The polytechnics of Thuringia are based in Erfurt (4,500 students), Jena (5,000 students), Nordhausen (2,500 students) and Schmalkalden (3,000 students). In addition, there is a civil service college in Gotha with 500 students, the College of Music &quot;Franz Liszt&quot; in Weimar (800 students) as well as two private colleges, the Adam-Ries-Fachhochschule in Erfurt (500 students) and the SRH College for nursing and allied medical subjects (&quot;SRH Fachhochschule für Gesundheit Gera&quot;) in Gera (500 students). The most recent institution of higher education in Thuringia is the Duale Hochschule Gera-Eisenach (1400 students), a cooperative state college founded in 2016 through a merger of the colleges (&quot;Berufsakademie&quot;) in Gera and Eisenach.

=== Research ===
Thuringia&#x27;s leading research centre is Jena, followed by Ilmenau. Both focus on technology, in particular life sciences and optics at Jena and information technology at Ilmenau. Erfurt is a centre of Germany&#x27;s horticultural research, whereas Weimar and Gotha with their various archives and libraries are centres of historic and cultural research. Most of the research in Thuringia is publicly funded basic research due to the lack of large companies able to invest significant amounts in applied research, with the notable exception of the optics sector at Jena.

<text>Theodosius I ( ; 11 January 347 – 17 January 395), also known as Theodosius the Great, was a Roman emperor from 379 to 395. He won two civil wars and was instrumental in establishing the Nicene Creed as the orthodox doctrine for Nicene Christianity. Theodosius was the last emperor to rule the entire Roman Empire before its administration was permanently split between the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire. He ended the Gothic War (376–382) with terms disadvantageous to the empire, with the Goths remaining within Roman territory but as nominal allies with political autonomy.

Born in Hispania, Theodosius was the son of a high-ranking general of the same name, Count Theodosius, under whose guidance he rose through the ranks of the Roman army. Theodosius held independent command in Moesia in 374, where he had some success against the invading Sarmatians. Not long afterwards, he was forced into retirement, and his father was executed under obscure circumstances. Theodosius soon regained his position following a series of intrigues and executions at Emperor Gratian&#x27;s court. In 379, after the eastern Roman emperor Valens was killed at the Battle of Adrianople against the Goths, Gratian appointed Theodosius as a successor with orders to take charge of the military emergency. The new emperor&#x27;s resources and depleted armies were not sufficient to drive the invaders out; in 382 the Goths were allowed to settle south of the Danube as autonomous allies of the empire. In 386, Theodosius signed a treaty with the Sasanian Empire which partitioned the long-disputed Kingdom of Armenia and secured a durable peace between the two powers.

Theodosius was a strong adherent of the Christian doctrine of consubstantiality and an opponent of Arianism. He convened a council of bishops at the First Council of Constantinople in 381, which confirmed the former as orthodoxy and the latter as a heresy. Although Theodosius interfered little in the functioning of traditional pagan cults and appointed non-Christians to high offices, he failed to prevent or punish the damaging of several Hellenistic temples of classical antiquity, such as the Serapeum of Alexandria, by Christian zealots. During his earlier reign, Theodosius ruled the eastern provinces, while the west was overseen by the emperors Gratian and Valentinian II, whose sister he married. According to historian Andreas Schwarcz, the marriage was specifically arranged to consolidate Theodosius&#x27; political and military power. Theodosius sponsored several measures to improve his capital and main residence, Constantinople, most notably his expansion of the Forum Tauri, which became the biggest public square known in antiquity. Theodosius marched west twice, in 388 and 394, after both Gratian and Valentinian had been killed, to defeat the two pretenders, Magnus Maximus and Eugenius, who rose to replace them. Theodosius&#x27;s final victory in September 394 made him master of the entire empire; he died a few months later and was succeeded by his two sons, Arcadius in the eastern half of the empire and Honorius in the west.

Theodosius was said to have been a diligent administrator, austere in his habits, merciful, and a devout Christian. For centuries after his death, Theodosius was regarded as a champion of Christian orthodoxy who decisively stamped out paganism. Modern scholars tend to see this as an interpretation of history by Christian writers more than an accurate representation of actual history. He is fairly credited with presiding over a revival in classical art that some historians have termed a &quot;Theodosian renaissance&quot;. Although his pacification of the Goths secured peace for the Empire during his lifetime, their status as an autonomous entity within Roman borders caused problems for succeeding emperors. Theodosius has also received criticism for defending his own dynastic interests at the cost of two civil wars. His two sons proved weak and incapable rulers, and they presided over a period of foreign invasions and court intrigues, which heavily weakened the empire. The descendants of Theodosius ruled the Roman world for the next six decades, and the east–west division endured until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the late 5th century.

==Background==
Theodosius was born in Hispania on 11 January, probably in the year 347. His father of the same name, Count Theodosius, was a successful and high-ranking general (&quot;magister equitum&quot;) under the western Roman emperor Valentinian I, and his mother was called Thermantia. The family appear to have been minor landed aristocrats in Hispania, although it is not clear if this social status went back several generations or if Theodosius the Elder was simply awarded land there for his military service. Their roots to Hispania were nevertheless probably long-standing, since various relatives of the future emperor Theodosius are likewise attested as being from there, and Theodosius himself was ubiquitously associated in the ancient literary sources and panegyrics with the image of fellow Spanish-born emperor Trajan – though he never again visited the peninsula after becoming emperor.

Very little is recorded of the upbringing of Theodosius. The 5th-century author Theodoret claimed the future emperor grew up and was educated in his Iberian homeland, but his testimony is unreliable. One modern historian instead thinks Theodosius must have grown up among the army, participating in his father&#x27;s campaigns throughout the provinces, as was customary at the time for families with a tradition of military service. One source says he received a decent education and developed a particular interest in history, which Theodosius then valued as a guide to his own conduct throughout life.

==Career==

Theodosius is first attested accompanying his father to Britain on his expedition in 368–369 to suppress the &quot;Great Conspiracy&quot;, a concerted Celtic and Germanic invasion of the island provinces. After probably serving in his father&#x27;s staff on further campaigns, Theodosius received his first independent command by 374 when he was appointed the &quot;dux&quot; (commanding officer) of the province of Moesia Prima in the Danube. In the autumn of 374, he successfully repulsed an incursion of Sarmatians on his sector of the frontier and forced them into submission. Not long afterwards, however, under mysterious circumstances, Theodosius&#x27;s father suddenly fell from imperial favor and was executed, and the future emperor felt compelled to retire to his estates in Hispania.

Although these events are poorly documented, historians usually attribute this fall from grace to the machinations of a court faction led by Maximinus, a senior civilian official. According to another theory, the future emperor Theodosius lost his father, his military post, or both, in the purges of high officials that resulted from the accession of the 4-year-old emperor Valentinian II in November 375. Theodosius&#x27;s period away from service in Hispania, during which he was said to have received threats from those responsible for his father&#x27;s death, did not last long, however, as Maximinus, the probable culprit, was himself removed from power around April 376 and then executed. The emperor Gratian immediately began replacing Maximinus and his associates with relatives of Theodosius in key government positions, indicating the family&#x27;s full rehabilitation, and by 377 Theodosius himself had regained his command against the Sarmatians.

Theodosius&#x27;s renewed term of office seems to have gone uneventfully, until news arrived that the eastern Roman emperor, Valens, had been killed at the Battle of Adrianople in August 378 against invading Goths. The disastrous defeat left much of Rome&#x27;s military leadership dead, discredited, or barbarian in origin, to the result that Theodosius, notwithstanding his own modest record, became the establishment&#x27;s choice to replace Valens and assume control of the crisis. With the begrudging consent of the western emperor Gratian, Theodosius was formally invested with the purple by a council of officials at Sirmium on 19 January 379.

== Reign ==

===Gothic War (376–382)===
The immediate problem facing Theodosius upon his accession was how to check the bands of Goths that were laying waste to the Balkans, with an army that had been severely depleted of manpower following the debacle at Adrianople. The western emperor Gratian, who seems to have provided only little immediate assistance, surrendered to Theodosius control of the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum for the duration of the conflict, giving his new colleague full charge the war effort. Theodosius implemented stern and desperate recruiting measures, resorting to the conscription of farmers and miners. Punishments were instituted for harboring deserters and furnishing unfit recruits, and even self-mutilation did not exempt men from service. Theodosius also admitted large numbers of non-Roman auxiliaries into the army, even Gothic deserters from beyond the Danube. Some of these foreign recruits were exchanged with more reliable Roman garrison troops stationed in Egypt.

In the second half of 379, Theodosius and his generals, based at Thessalonica, won some minor victories over individual bands of raiders. However, they suffered at least one serious defeat in 380, which was blamed on the treachery of the new barbarian recruits. During the autumn of 380, a life-threatening illness, from which Theodosius recovered, prompted him to request baptism. Some obscure victories were recorded in official sources around this time, however, and, in November 380, the military situation was found to be sufficiently stable for Theodosius to move his court to Constantinople. There, the emperor enjoyed a propaganda victory when, in January 381, he received the visit and submission of a minor Gothic leader, Athanaric. By this point, however, Theodosius seems to have no longer believed that the Goths could be completely ejected from Roman territory. After Athanaric died that very same month, the emperor gave him a funeral with full honors, impressing his entourage and signaling to the enemy that the Empire was disposed to negotiate terms. During the campaigning season of 381, reinforcements from Gratian drove the Goths out of the Diocese of Macedonia and Thessaly into the Diocese of Thrace, while, in the latter sector, Theodosius or one of his generals repulsed an incursion by a group of Sciri and Huns across the Danube.

Following negotiations which likely lasted at least several months, the Romans and Goths finally concluded a settlement on 3 October 382. In return for military service to Rome, the Goths were allowed to settle some tracts of Roman land south of the Danube. The terms were unusually favorable to the Goths, reflecting the fact that they were entrenched in Roman territory and had not been driven out. Namely, instead of fully submitting to Roman authority, they were allowed to remain autonomous under their own leaders, and thus remaining a strong, unified body. The Goths now settled within the Empire would largely fight for the Romans as a national contingent, as opposed to being fully integrated into the Roman forces.

=== 383–384 ===
According to the &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot;, Theodosius celebrated his &quot;quinquennalia&quot; on 19 January 383 at Constantinople; on this occasion he raised his eldest son Arcadius to co-emperor (&quot;augustus&quot;). Sometime in 383, Gratian&#x27;s wife Constantia died. Gratian remarried, wedding Laeta, whose father was a &quot;consularis&quot; of Roman Syria. Early 383 saw the acclamation of Magnus Maximus as emperor in Britain and the appointment of Themistius as &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; in Constantinople. On 25 August 383, according to the &quot;Consularia Constantinopolitana&quot;, Gratian was killed at Lugdunum (Lyon) by Andragathius, the &quot;magister equitum&quot; of the rebel emperor during the rebellion of Magnus Maximus . Constantia&#x27;s body arrived in Constantinople on 12 September that year and was buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles on 1 December. Gratian was deified as .

Theodosius, unable to do much about Maximus due to ongoing military inadequacy, opened negotiations with the Persian emperor Shapur III () of the Sasanian Empire. According to the &quot;Consularia Constantinopolitana&quot;, Theodosius received in Constantinople an embassy from them in 384.

In an attempt to curb Maximus&#x27;s ambitions, Theodosius appointed Flavius Neoterius as the Praetorian Prefect of Italy. In the summer of 384, Theodosius met his co-emperor Valentinian II in northern Italy. Theodosius brokered a peace agreement between Valentinian and Magnus Maximus which endured for several years.

Theodosius I was based in Constantinople, and according to Peter Heather, wanted, &quot;for his own dynastic reasons (for his two sons each eventually to inherit half of the empire), refused to appoint a recognized counterpart in the west. As a result he was faced with rumbling discontent there, as well as dangerous usurpers, who found plentiful support among the bureaucrats and military officers who felt they were not getting a fair share of the imperial cake.&quot;

=== Middle reign: 384–387 ===
Theodosius&#x27;s second son Honorius was born on 9 December 384 and titled &quot;nobilissimus puer&quot; (or &quot;nobilissimus iuvenis&quot;). The death of Aelia Flaccilla, Theodosius&#x27;s first wife and the mother of Arcadius, Honorius, and Pulcheria, occurred by 386. She died at Scotumis in Thrace and was buried at Constantinople, her funeral oration delivered by Gregory of Nyssa. A statue of her was dedicated in the Byzantine Senate. In 384 or 385, Theodosius&#x27;s niece Serena was married to the &quot;magister militum&quot;, Stilicho.
In the beginning of 386, Theodosius&#x27;s daughter Pulcheria also died. That summer, more Goths were defeated, and many were settled in Phrygia. According to the &quot;Consularia Constantinopolitana&quot;, a Roman triumph over the Gothic Greuthungi was then celebrated at Constantinople. The same year, work began on the great triumphal column in the Forum of Theodosius in Constantinople, the Column of Theodosius. The &quot;Consularia Constantinopolitana&quot; records that on 19 January 387, Arcadius celebrated his &quot;quinquennalia&quot; in Constantinople. By the end of the month, there was an uprising or riot in Antioch (modern Antakya). The Roman–Persian Wars concluded with the signing of the Peace of Acilisene with Persia. By the terms of the agreement, the ancient Kingdom of Armenia was divided between the powers.

By the end of the 380s, Theodosius and the court were in Milan and northern Italy had settled down to a period of prosperity. Peter Brown says gold was being made in Milan by those who owned land as well as by those who came with the court for government service. Great landowners took advantage of the court&#x27;s need for food, &quot;turning agrarian produce into gold&quot;, while repressing and misusing the poor who grew it and brought it in. According to Brown, modern scholars link the decline of the Roman empire to the avarice of the rich of this era. He quotes Paulinus of Milan as describing these men as creating a court where &quot;everything was up for sale&quot;. In the late 380s, Ambrose, the bishop of Milan took the lead in opposing this, presenting the need for the rich to care for the poor as &quot;a necessary consequence of the unity of all Christians&quot;. This led to a major development in the political culture of the day called the “advocacy revolution of the later Roman empire&quot;. This revolution had been fostered by the imperial government, and it encouraged appeals and denunciations of bad government from below. However, Brown adds that, &quot;in the crucial area of taxation and the treatment of fiscal debtors, the late Roman state [of the 380s and 390s] remained impervious to Christianity&quot;.

=== Civil war: 387–388 ===
The peace with Magnus Maximus was broken in 387, and Valentinian escaped to the east with Justina, reaching Thessalonica (Thessaloniki) in summer or autumn 387 and appealing to Theodosius for aid; Valentinian II&#x27;s sister Galla was then married to the eastern emperor at Thessalonica in late autumn. Theodosius may still have been in Thessalonica when he celebrated his &quot;decennalia&quot; on 19 January 388. Theodosius was consul for the second time in 388. Galla and Theodosius&#x27;s first child, a son named Gratian, was born in 388 or 389. In summer 388, Theodosius recovered Italy from Magnus Maximus for Valentinian, and in June, the meeting of Christians deemed heretics was banned by Valentinian.

The armies of Theodosius and Maximus fought at the Battle of Poetovio in 388, which saw Maximus defeated. On 28 August 388 Maximus was executed. Now the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the Western empire as well, Theodosius celebrated his victory in Rome on 13 June 389 and stayed in Milan until 391, installing his own loyalists in senior positions including the new &quot;magister militum&quot; of the West, the Frankish general Arbogast. According to the &quot;Consularia Constantinopolitana&quot;, Arbogast killed Flavius Victor (), Magnus Maximus&#x27;s young son and co-emperor, in Gaul in August/September that year. &quot;Damnatio memoriae&quot; was pronounced against them, and inscriptions naming them were erased.

=== Massacre and its aftermath: 388–391 ===

The Massacre of Thessalonica (Thessaloniki) in Greece was a massacre of local civilians by Roman troops. The best estimate of the date is April of 390. The massacre was most likely a response to an urban riot that led to the murder of a Roman official. What most scholars, such as philosopher Stanislav Doležal, see as the most reliable of the sources is the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; written by Sozomen about 442; in it Sozomen supplies the identity of the murdered Roman official as Butheric, the commanding general of the field army in Illyricum (magister militum per Illyricum). According to Sozomen, a popular charioteer tried to rape a cup-bearer, (or possibly Butheric himself), and in response, Butheric arrested and jailed the charioteer. The populace demanded the chariot racer&#x27;s release, and when Butheric refused, a general revolt rose up costing Butheric his life. Doležal says the name &quot;Butheric&quot; indicates he might have been a Goth, and that the general&#x27;s ethnicity &quot;could have been&quot; a factor in the riot, but none of the early sources actually say so.

====Sources====
There are no contemporaneous accounts. Church historians Sozomen, Theodoret the bishop of Cyrrhus, Socrates of Constantinople and Rufinus wrote the earliest accounts during the fifth century. These are moral accounts emphasizing imperial piety and ecclesial action rather than historical and political details. Further difficulty is created by these events moving into legend in art and literature almost immediately. Doležal explains that yet another problem is created by aspects of these accounts contradicting one another to the point of being mutually exclusive. Nonetheless, most classicists accept at least the basic account of the massacre, although they continue to dispute when it happened, who was responsible for it, what motivated it, and what impact it had on subsequent events.

====Theodosius&#x27;s role====

Theodosius was not in Thessalonica when the massacre occurred. The court was in Milan. Several scholars, such as historian G. W. Bowersock and authors Stephen Williams and Gerard Friell, think that Theodosius ordered the massacre in an excess of &quot;volcanic anger&quot;. McLynn also puts all the blame on the Emperor as does the less dependable fifth century historian, Theodoret. Other scholars, such as historians Mark Hebblewhite and N. Q. King, do not agree. Peter Brown points to the empire&#x27;s established process of decision making, which required the emperor &quot;to listen to his ministers&quot; before acting. There is some indication in the sources Theodosius did listen to his counselors but received bad or misleading advice.

J. F. Matthews argues that the Emperor first tried to punish the city by selective executions. Peter Brown concurs: &quot;As it was, what was probably planned as a selective killing ... got out of hand&quot;. Doleźal says Sozomen is very specific in saying that in response to the riot, the soldiers made random arrests in the hippodrome to perform a few public executions as a demonstration of imperial disfavor, but the citizenry objected. Doleźal suggests, &quot;The soldiers, realizing that they were surrounded by angry citizens, perhaps panicked ... and ... forcibly cleared the hippodrome at the cost of several thousands of lives of local inhabitants&quot;. McLynn says Theodosius was “unable to impose discipline upon the faraway troops&quot; and covered that failure by taking responsibility for the massacre on himself, declaring he had given the order then countermanded it too late to stop it.

Ambrose, the bishop of Milan and one of Theodosius&#x27;s many counselors, was away from court. After being informed of events concerning Thessalonica, he wrote Theodosius a letter offering what McLynn calls a different way for the emperor to &quot;save face&quot; and restore his public image. Ambrose urges a semi-public demonstration of penitence, telling the emperor he will not give Theodosius communion until this is done. Wolf Liebeschuetz says &quot;Theodosius duly complied and came to church without his imperial robes, until Christmas, when Ambrose openly admitted him to communion&quot;.

Washburn says the image of the mitered prelate braced in the door of the cathedral in Milan blocking Theodosius from entering is a product of the imagination of Theodoret who wrote of the events of 390 &quot;using his own ideology to fill the gaps in the historical record&quot;. Peter Brown also says there was no dramatic encounter at the church door. McLynn states that &quot;the encounter at the church door has long been known as a pious fiction&quot;. Wolfe Liebeschuetz says Ambrose advocated a course of action which avoided the kind of public humiliation Theodoret describes, and that is the course Theodosius chose.

====Aftermath====
According to the early twentieth century historian Henry Smith Williams, history&#x27;s assessment of Theodosius&#x27;s character has been stained by the massacre of Thessalonica for centuries. Williams describes Theodosius as a virtuous-minded, courageous man, who was vigorous in pursuit of any important goal, but through contrasting the &quot;inhuman massacre of the people of Thessalonica&quot; with &quot;the generous pardon of the citizens of Antioch&quot; after civil war, Williams also concludes Theodosius was &quot;hasty and choleric&quot;. It is only modern scholarship that has begun disputing Theodosius&#x27;s responsibility for those events.

From the time Edward Gibbon wrote his &quot;Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, Ambrose&#x27;s action after the fact has been cited as an example of the church&#x27;s dominance over the state in Antiquity. Alan Cameron says &quot;the assumption is so widespread it would be superfluous to cite authorities. But there is not a shred of evidence for Ambrose exerting any such influence over Theodosius&quot;. Brown says Ambrose was just one among many advisors, and Cameron says there is no evidence Theodosius favored him above anyone else.

By the time of the Thessalonian affair, Ambrose, an aristocrat and former governor, had been a bishop for 16 years, and during his episcopate, had seen the death of three emperors before Theodosius. These produced significant political storms, yet Ambrose held his place using what McLynn calls his &quot;considerable qualities [and] considerable luck&quot; to survive. Theodosius was in his 40s, had been emperor for 11 years, had temporarily settled the Gothic wars, and won a civil war. As a Latin speaking Nicene western leader of the Greek largely Arian East, Boniface Ramsey says he had already left an indelible mark on history.

McLynn asserts that the relationship between Theodosius and Ambrose transformed into myth within a generation of their deaths. He also observes that the documents revealing the relationship between these two formidable men do not show the personal friendship the legends portray. Instead, those documents read more as negotiations between the institutions the men represent: the Roman state and the Italian Church.

=== Second civil war: 392–394 ===
In 391, Theodosius left his trusted general Arbogast, who had served in the Balkans after Adrianople, to be &quot;magister militum&quot; for the Western emperor Valentinian II, while Theodosius attempted to rule the entire empire from Constantinople. On 15 May 392, Valentinian II died at Vienna in Gaul (Vienne), either by suicide or as part of a plot by Arbogast. Valentinian had quarrelled publicly with Arbogast, and was found hanged in his room. Arbogast announced that this had been a suicide. Stephen Williams asserts that Valentinian&#x27;s death left Arbogast in &quot;an untenable position&quot;. He had to carry on governing without the ability to issue edicts and rescripts from a legitimate acclaimed emperor. Arbogast was unable to assume the role of emperor himself because of his non-Roman background. Instead, on 22 August 392, Arbogast had Valentinian&#x27;s master of correspondence, Eugenius, proclaimed emperor in the West at Lugdunum.

At least two embassies went to Theodosius to explain events, one of them Christian in make-up, but they received ambivalent replies, and were sent home without achieving their goals. Theodosius raised his second son Honorius to emperor on 23 January 393, implying the illegality of Eugenius&#x27;s rule. Williams and Friell say that by the spring of 393, the split was complete, and &quot;in April Arbogast and Eugenius at last moved into Italy without resistance&quot;. Flavianus, the praetorian prefect of Italy whom Theodosius had appointed, defected to their side. Through early 394, both sides prepared for war.

Theodosius gathered a large army, including the Goths whom he had settled in the eastern empire as &quot;foederati&quot;, and Caucasian and Saracen auxiliaries, and marched against Eugenius. The battle began on 5 September 394, with Theodosius&#x27;s full frontal assault on Eugenius&#x27;s forces. Thousands of Goths died, and in Theodosius&#x27;s camp, the loss of the day decreased morale. It is said by Theodoret that Theodosius was visited by two &quot;heavenly riders all in white&quot; who gave him courage.

The next day, the extremely bloody battle began again and Theodosius&#x27;s forces were aided by a natural phenomenon known as the Bora, which can produce hurricane-strength winds. The Bora blew directly against the forces of Eugenius and disrupted the line. Eugenius&#x27;s camp was stormed; Eugenius was captured and soon after executed. According to Socrates Scholasticus, Theodosius defeated Eugenius at the Battle of the Frigidus (the Vipava) on 6 September 394. On 8 September, Arbogast killed himself. According to Socrates, on 1 January 395, Honorius arrived in Mediolanum and a victory celebration was held there. Zosimus records that, at the end of April 394, Theodosius&#x27;s wife Galla had died while he was away at war.

A number of Christian sources report that Eugenius cultivated the support of the pagan senators by promising to restore the altar of Victory and provide public funds for the maintenance of cults if they would support him and if he won the coming war against Theodosius. Cameron notes that the ultimate source for this is Ambrose&#x27;s biographer Paulinus the Deacon, whom he argues fabricated the entire narrative and deserves no credence. Historian Michele Renee Salzman explains that &quot;two newly relevant texts – John Chrysostom&#x27;s Homily 6, &quot;adversus Catharos&quot; (PG 63: 491–492) and the &quot;Consultationes Zacchei et Apollonii&quot;, re-dated to the 390s, reinforces the view that religion was not the key ideological element in the events at the time&quot;. According to Maijastina Kahlos, Finnish historian and Docent of Latin language and Roman literature at the University of Helsinki, the notion of pagan aristocrats united in a &quot;heroic and cultured resistance&quot; who rose up against the ruthless advance of Christianity in a final battle near Frigidus in 394 is a romantic myth.

== Death ==
Theodosius suffered from a disease involving severe edema. He died in Mediolanum (Milan) on 17 January 395, and his body lay in state in the palace there for forty days. His funeral was held in the cathedral on 25 February. Bishop Ambrose delivered a panegyric titled &quot;De obitu Theodosii&quot; in the presence of Stilicho and Honorius in which Ambrose praised the suppression of paganism by Theodosius.

On 8 November 395, his body was transferred to Constantinople, where according to the &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot; he was buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles. He was honored . He was interred in a porphyry sarcophagus that was described in the 10th century by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in his work &quot;De Ceremoniis&quot;.

== Honorific ==

Theodosius was initially styled &quot;the Great&quot; simply as a way to differentiate him from his grandson Theodosius II. Later, at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the honorific was deemed merited due to his promotion of Nicene Christianity.

== Veneration ==
Theodosius the Great is venerated in Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches:

* 18 January – Ethiopian Church commemorates Theodosius, the righteous emperor,
* 18 January – Eastern Orthodox Church commemoration,
* 19 January – Armenian Apostolic Church,

Emperor (king) Theodosius is commemorated in Armenian Anaphora with saint kings: Abgar, Constantine and Tiridates.

In Eastern Orthodox Church he is commemorated as ktetor of Vatopedi and donator of Vatopedi icon of the Mother of God.

==Art patronage==

According to art historian David Wright, art of the era around the year 400 reflects optimism amongst the traditional polytheists. This is likely connected to what Ine Jacobs calls a renaissance of classical styles of art in the Theodosian period (AD 379–395) often referred to in modern scholarship as the &quot;Theodosian renaissance&quot;. The &quot;Forum Tauri&quot; in Constantinople was renamed and redecorated as the Forum of Theodosius, including a column and a triumphal arch in his honour. The &quot;missorium&quot; of Theodosius, the city of Aprodisias&#x27;s statue of the emperor, the base of the Obelisk of Theodosius, the columns of Theodosius and Arcadius, and the diptych of Probus were all commissioned by the court and reflect a similar renaissance of classicism.

According to Armin Wirsching, two obelisks were shipped by the Romans from Karnak to Alexandria in 13/12 BC. In 357, Constantius II had one (that became known as the Lateran obelisk) shipped to Rome. Wirsching says the Romans had previously watched and learned from the Egyptians how to transport such large heavy objects, so they constructed &quot;a special sea‐going version of the Nile vessels ... – a double‐ship with three hulls&quot;. In 390, Theodosius oversaw the removal of the other to Constantinople. Linda Safran says that relocating the obelisk was motivated by Theodosius&#x27;s victory over &quot;the tyrants&quot; (most likely Maximus Magnus and his son Victor). It is now known as the obelisk of Theodosius and still stands in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, the long Roman circus that was, at one time, the centre of Constantinople&#x27;s public life. Re-erecting the monolith was a challenge for the technology that had been honed in the construction of siege engines.

The obelisk&#x27;s white marble base is entirely covered with bas-reliefs documenting Theodosius&#x27;s imperial household and the engineering feat of removing the obelisk to Constantinople. Theodosius and the imperial family are separated from the nobles among the spectators in the imperial box, with a cover over them as a mark of their status. From the perspective of style, it has served as &quot;the key monument in identifying a so-called Theodosian court style, which is usually described as a &quot;renaissance&quot; of earlier Roman classicism&quot;.
==Religious policy==

===Arianism and orthodoxy===

It is traditionally stated that the Arian Controversy, a dispute concerning the nature of the divine trinity, and its accompanying struggles for political influence, started in Alexandria during the reign of Constantine the Great between a presbyter, Arius of Alexandria, and his bishop, Alexander of Alexandria. However, “many of the issues raised by the controversy were under lively discussion &quot;before&quot; Arius and Alexander publicly clashed.” “The views of Arius were such as … to bring into unavoidable prominence a doctrinal crisis which had gradually been gathering. … He was the spark that started the explosion. But in himself he was of &quot;no great significance&quot;.”

It is also traditionally stated that Alexander represented orthodoxy and that, when he died, his successor, Athanasius, became the representative of orthodoxy. In reality, “Nicene apologists … turn ‘Arianism&#x27; into a self-conscious sect – as if the boundaries of Catholic identity were firmly and clearly drawn in advance. But the whole history of Arius and of Arianism reminds us that this was not so.” (RW, 83) The Arian Controversy &quot;is not the story of a defence of orthodoxy, but of a &quot;search&quot; for orthodoxy.&quot;

Arius asserted that God the Father created the Son. This meant the Son, though still seen as divine, was not equal to the Father, because he had a beginning, and was not eternal. &quot;The controversy had spread from Alexandria into almost all the African regions and was considered a disturbance of the public order by the Roman Empire.&quot; (Eusebius of Caesarea in The Life of Constantine) 

Constantine had tried to settle the issues at the Council of Nicaea, but as Arnold Hugh Martin Jones states: &quot;The rules laid down at Nicaea were not universally accepted&quot;. After the Nicene Creed was formulated in 325, many in the church reacted strongly against the word &quot;&quot;homoousios&quot;&quot; in the Creed, and therefore Councils at Ariminum (Rimini), Nike (southeast of Adrianople), and Constantinople, held in 359–60 by Emperor Constantius II, formulated creeds that were intended to replace or revise the Nicene Creed; in particular, to find alternatives for &quot;homoousios.&quot; These councils are no longer regarded as Ecumenical Councils in the tradition of the Church; their creeds, which are at odds with the Nicene Creed, are known as Arian Creeds. 

During this time, Athanasius was at the center of the controversy and became the &quot;champion of orthodoxy&quot; after Alexander died. To Athanasius, Arius&#x27;s interpretation of Jesus&#x27;s nature (Homoiousian), that the Father and Son are similar but not identical in substance, could not explain how Jesus could accomplish the redemption of humankind which is the foundational principle of Christianity. &quot;According to Athanasius, God had to become human so that humans could become divin  ... That led him to conclude that the divine nature in Jesus was identical to that of the Father, and that Father and Son have the same substance&quot; (&quot;homoousios&quot;). Athanasius&#x27;s teaching was a major influence in the West, especially on Theodosius I.

On 28 February 380, Theodosius issued the Edict of Thessalonica, a decree addressed to the city of Constantinople, determining that only Christians who believed in the consubstantiality of God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit could style themselves &quot;catholic&quot; and have their own places of worship officially recognized as &quot;churches&quot;; deviants were labeled heretics and described as &quot;out of their minds and insane&quot;. 

Recent scholarship has tended to reject former views that the edict was a key step in establishing Christianity as the official religion of the Empire, since it was aimed exclusively at Constantinople and seems to have gone largely unnoticed by contemporaries outside the capital. For example, German ancient historian writes that the Edict of Thessalonica was neither anti-pagan nor antisemitic; it did not declare Christianity to be the official religion of the empire; and it gave no advantage to Christians over other faiths. It is clear from mandates issued in the years after 380 that Theodosius had made no requirement for pagans or Jews to convert to Christianity. Nonetheless, the edict is the first known secular Roman law to positively define a religious orthodoxy. 

According to Robinson Thornton, Theodosius began taking steps to repress Arianism immediately after his baptism in 380. On 26 November 380, two days after he had arrived in Constantinople, Theodosius expelled the Homoian bishop, Demophilus of Constantinople, and appointed Meletius patriarch of Antioch, and Gregory of Nazianzus, one of the Cappadocian Fathers from Cappadocia (today in Turkey), patriarch of Constantinople. Theodosius had just been baptized, by bishop Ascholius of Thessalonica, during a severe illness.

In May 381, Theodosius summoned a new ecumenical council at Constantinople to repair the schism between East and West on the basis of Nicene orthodoxy. The council went on to define orthodoxy, including the Third Person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, as equal to the Father and &#x27;proceeding&#x27; from Him. The council also &quot;condemned the Apollonarian and Macedonian heresies, clarified jurisdictions of the bishops according to the civil boundaries of dioceses. and ruled that Constantinople was second in precedence to Rome.&quot;

===Policy towards paganism===
Theodosius seems to have adopted a cautious policy toward traditional non-Christian cults, reiterating his Christian predecessors&#x27; bans on animal sacrifice, divination, and apostasy, while allowing other pagan practices to be performed publicly and temples to remain open. He also voiced his support for the preservation of temple buildings, but nonetheless failed to prevent the damaging of many holy sites, images and objects of piety by Christian zealots, some including even his own officials. Theodosius also turned pagan holidays into workdays, but the festivals associated with them continued. A number of laws against paganism were issued towards the end of his reign, in 391 and 392, but historians have tended to downplay their practical effects and even the emperor&#x27;s direct role in them. Modern scholars think there is little if any evidence Theodosius pursued an active and sustained policy against the traditional cults.

There is evidence that Theodosius took care to prevent the empire&#x27;s still substantial pagan population from feeling ill-disposed toward his rule. Following the death in 388 of his praetorian prefect, Cynegius, who had vandalized a number of pagan shrines in the eastern provinces, Theodosius replaced him with a moderate pagan who subsequently moved to protect the temples. During his first official tour of Italy (389–391), the emperor won over the influential pagan lobby in the Roman Senate by appointing its foremost members to important administrative posts. Theodosius also nominated the last pair of pagan consuls in Roman history (Tatianus and Symmachus) in 391.

====Temple destruction====

Contemporary archaeology has found that the area with the most destruction against temples by Christians took place in the territory around Constantinople in the diocese of Orientis (the East) under Theodosius&#x27;s prefect, Maternus Cynegius, where archaeological digs have discovered several destroyed temples. Theodosius officially supported temple preservation, but Garth Fowden says Cynegius did not limit himself to Theodosius&#x27;s official policy, but instead, commissioned temple destruction on a wide scale, even employing the military under his command for this purpose. Christopher Haas also says Cynegius oversaw temple closings, the prohibition of sacrifices, and the destruction of temples in Osrhoene, Carrhae, and Beroea.

Earlier scholars believed Cynegius&#x27;s actions were just part of a tide of violence against temples that continued throughout the 390s. However, recent archaeological discoveries have undermined this view. The archaeological evidence for the violent destruction of temples in the fourth and early fifth centuries around the entire Mediterranean is limited to a handful of sites. Temple destruction is attested to in 43 cases in the written sources, but only 4 of them were confirmed by archaeological evidence. Trombley and MacMullen say part of what creates this discrepancy are details in the historical sources that are commonly ambiguous and unclear. For example, Malalas claimed Constantine destroyed all the temples, then he said Theodosius did, then he said Constantine converted them all to churches. There is no evidence of any desire on the part of the emperor to institute a systematic destruction of temples anywhere in the Theodosian Code, and no evidence in the archaeological record that extensive temple destruction ever took place.

====Theodosian decrees====
According to &quot;The Cambridge Ancient History&quot;, the Theodosian Law Code is a set of laws, originally dated from Constantine to Theodosius I, that were gathered together, organized by theme, and reissued throughout the empire between 389 and 391. Jill Harries and Ian S. Wood explain that, in their original forms, these laws were created by different emperors and governors to resolve the issues of a particular place at a particular time. They were not intended as general laws. Local politics and culture had produced divergent attitudes, and as a result, these laws present a series of conflicting opinions: for example, some laws called for the complete destruction of the temples and others for their preservation. French historian of Antiquity, , observes that &quot;Ammianus Marcellinus&quot; says this legal complexity produced corruption, forgery of rescripts, falsified appeals, and costly judicial delays.

The Theodosian Law Code has long been one of the principal historical sources for the study of Late Antiquity. Gibbon described the Theodosian decrees, in his &quot;Memoires&quot;, as a work of history rather than jurisprudence. Brown says the language of these laws is uniformly vehement, and penalties are harsh and frequently horrifying, leading some historians, such as Ramsay MacMullen, to see them as a &#x27;declaration of war&#x27; on traditional religious practices. It is a common belief the laws marked a turning point in the decline of paganism.

Yet, many contemporary scholars such as Lepelly, Brown and Cameron, question the use of the Code, a legal document, not an actual historical work, for understanding history. One of many problems with using the Theodosian Code as a record of history is described by archaeologists Luke Lavan and Michael Mulryan. They explain that the Code can be seen to document &quot;Christian ambition&quot; but not historic reality. The overtly violent fourth century that one would expect to find from taking the laws at face value is not supported by archaeological evidence from around the Mediterranean.

====End of paganism====
The picture of Theodosius as &quot;the most pious emperor&quot;, who presided over the end of paganism through the aggressive application of law and coercion – a view which R. Malcolm Errington says &quot;has dominated the European historical tradition almost to this day&quot; – was first written by Theodoret who, in Errington&#x27;s view, had a habit of ignoring facts and cherry picking. In the centuries following his death, Theodosius gained a reputation as the champion of orthodoxy and the vanquisher of paganism, but modern historians see this as a later interpretation of history by Christian writers rather than actual history.

An increase in the variety and abundance of sources has brought about the reinterpretation of religion of this era. According to Salzman: &quot;Although the debate on the death of paganism continues, scholars ...by and large, concur that the once dominant notion of overt pagan-Christian religious conflict cannot fully explain the texts and artifacts or the social, religious, and political realities of Late Antique Rome&quot;.

Scholars agree that Theodosius gathered copious legislation on religious subjects, and that he continued the practices of his predecessors, prohibiting sacrifices with the intent of divining the future in December of 380, issuing a decree against heretics on 10 January 381, and an edict against Manichaeism in May of that same year. Theodosius convened the First Council of Constantinople, the second ecumenical council after Constantine&#x27;s First Council of Nicaea in 325; and the Constantinopolitan council which ended on 9 July. What is important about this, according to Errington, is how much this &#x27;copious legislation&#x27; was applied and used, which would show how dependable it is as a reflection of actual history.

Brown asserts that Christians still comprised a minority of the overall population, and local authorities were still mostly pagan and lax in imposing anti-pagan laws; even Christian bishops frequently obstructed their application. Harries and Wood say, &quot;The contents of the Code provide details from the canvas but are an unreliable guide, in isolation, to the character of the picture as a whole&quot;. Previously undervalued similarities in language, society, religion, and the arts, as well as current archaeological research, indicate paganism slowly declined, and that it was not forcefully overthrown by Theodosius I in the fourth century. 

Maijastina Kahlos writes that the fourth century Roman empire contained a wide variety of religions, cults, sects, beliefs and practices and they all generally co-existed without incident. Coexistence did occasionally lead to violence, but such outbreaks were relatively infrequent and localized. Jan N. Bremmer says that &quot;religious violence in Late Antiquity is mostly restricted to violent rhetoric: &#x27;in Antiquity, not all religious violence was that religious, and not all religious violence was that violent&#x27;&quot;.

The Christian church believed that victory over &quot;false gods&quot; had begun with Jesus and was completed through the conversion of Constantine; it was a victory that took place in heaven, rather than on earth, since Christians were only about 15–18% of the empire&#x27;s population in the early 300s. Brown indicates that, as a result of this &quot;triumphalism,&quot; paganism was seen as vanquished, and Salzman adds that judging by the sheer number of laws, heresy was a much higher priority than paganism for Christians in the fourth and fifth centuries.

Lavan says Christian writers gave the narrative of victory high visibility, but that it does not necessarily correlate to actual conversion rates. There are many signs that a healthy paganism continued into the fifth century, and in some places, into the sixth and beyond. According to Brown, Christians objected to anything that called the triumphal narrative into question, and that included the mistreatment of non-Christians. Archaeology indicates that in most regions away from the imperial court, the end of paganism was both gradual and untraumatic. The &quot;Oxford Handbook of Late Antiquity&quot; says that &quot;Torture and murder were not the inevitable result of the rise of Christianity.&quot; Instead, there was fluidity in the boundaries between the communities and &quot;coexistence with a competitive spirit.&quot; Brown says that &quot;In most areas, polytheists were not molested, and, apart from a few ugly incidents of local violence, Jewish communities also enjoyed a century of stable, even privileged, existence.&quot;

While conceding that Theodosius&#x27;s reign may have been a watershed in the decline of the old religions, Cameron downplays the role of the emperor&#x27;s &#x27;copious legislation&#x27; as limited in effect, and writes that Theodosius did &#x27;certainly not&#x27; ban paganism. In his 2020 biography of Theodosius, Mark Hebblewhite concludes that Theodosius never saw or advertised himself as a destroyer of the old cults; rather, the emperor&#x27;s efforts to promote Christianity were cautious, &#x27;targeted, tactical, and nuanced&#x27;, and intended to prevent political instability and religious discord.

<text>Tswana, also known native name Setswana, is a Bantu language spoken in and indigenous to Southern Africa by about 8.2 million people. It is closely related to the Northern Sotho and Southern Sotho languages, as well as the Kgalagadi language and the Lozi language.

Setswana is an official language of South Africa and Zimbabwe. It is a lingua franca in Botswana and parts of South Africa, particularly North West Province. Tswana speaking ethnic groups are found in more than two provinces of South Africa, primarily in the North West, where about four million people speak the language. An urbanised variety is known as Pretoria Sotho, and is the principal unique language of the city of Pretoria. The three South African provinces with the most speakers are Gauteng (circa 11%), Northern Cape, and North West (over 70%). Until 1994, South African Tswana people were notionally citizens of Bophuthatswana, one of the bantustans of the apartheid regime. The Setswana language in the Northwest Province has variations in which it is spoken according to the ethnic groups found in the Tswana culture (Bakgatla, Barolong, Bakwena, Batlhaping, Bahurutshe, Bafokeng, Batlokwa, Bataung, and Batswapong, among others); the written language remains the same. A small number of speakers are also found in Zimbabwe (unknown number) and Namibia (about 10,000 people).

== History ==
The first European to describe the language was the German traveller Hinrich Lichtenstein, who lived among the Tswana people Batlhaping in 1806 although his work was not published until 1930. He mistakenly regarded Tswana as a dialect of the Xhosa, and the name that he used for the language &quot;Beetjuana&quot; may also have covered the Northern and Southern Sotho languages.

The first major work on Tswana was carried out by the British missionary Robert Moffat, who had also lived among the Batlhaping, and published &quot;Bechuana Spelling Book&quot; and &quot;A Bechuana Catechism&quot; in 1826. In the following years, he published several other books of the Bible, and in 1857, he was able to publish a complete translation of the Bible.

The first grammar of Tswana was published in 1833 by the missionary James Archbell although it was modelled on a Xhosa grammar. The first grammar of Tswana which regarded it as a separate language from Xhosa (but still not as a separate language from the Northern and Southern Sotho languages) was published by the French missionary, E. Casalis in 1841. He changed his mind later, and in a publication from 1882, he noted that the Northern and Southern Sotho languages were distinct from Tswana.

Solomon Plaatje, a South African intellectual and linguist, was one of the first writers to extensively write in and about the Tswana language.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===
The vowel inventory of Tswana can be seen below.

Some dialects have two additional vowels, the close-mid vowels and . The circumflex on e and o in general Setswana writing is only encouraged at elementary levels of education and not at upper primary or higher; usually these are written without the circumflex.

=== Consonants ===
The consonant inventory of Tswana can be seen below.

The consonant is merely an allophone of , when the latter is followed by the vowels or . Two more sounds, v and 
z , exist only in loanwords.

Tswana also has three click consonants, but these are only used in interjections or ideophones, and tend only to be used by the older generation, and are therefore falling out of use. The three click consonants are the dental click , orthographically ; the lateral click , orthographically ; and the alveolar click , orthographically .

There are some minor dialectal variations among the consonants between speakers of Tswana. For instance, is realised as either or by many speakers; is realised as in most dialects; and and are realised as and in northern dialects.

The consonant can exist at the end of a word without being followed by a vowel (as in Jwaneng and Barolong Seboni).

=== Stress ===
Stress is fixed in Tswana and thus always falls on the penult of a word, although some compounds may receive a secondary stress in the first part of the word. The syllable on which the stress falls is lengthened. Thus, mosadi (woman) is realised as .

=== Tone ===
Tswana has two tones, high and low, but the latter has a much wider distribution in words than the former. Tones are not marked orthographically, which may lead to ambiguity.

: go bua &quot;to speak&quot;
: go bua &quot;to skin an animal&quot;

: o bua Setswana &quot;He speaks Setswana&quot;
: o bua Setswana &quot;You speak Setswana&quot;

An important feature of the tones is the so-called spreading of the high tone. If a syllable bears a high tone, the following two syllables will have high tones unless they are at the end of the word.

: simolola &gt; &quot;to begin&quot;
: simologêla &gt; &quot;to begin for/at&quot;

==Orthography==

Tswana orthography is based on the Latin alphabet.

The letter š was introduced in 1937, but the corresponding sound is still sometimes written as ⟨sh⟩. The letters ⟨ê⟩ and ⟨ô⟩ are used in textbooks and language reference books, but not so much in daily standard writing.

== Grammar ==

=== Nouns ===
Nouns in Tswana are grouped into nine noun classes and one subclass, each having different prefixes. The nine classes and their respective prefixes can be seen below, along with a short note regarding the common characteristics of most nouns within their respective classes.

Some nouns may be found in several classes. For instance, many class 1 nouns are also found in class 1a, class 3, class 4, and class 5.

<doc id="31134" wikidata="Q159491" url="?curid=31134" title="Nikolai Trubetzkoy">
<text>Prince Nikolai Sergeyevich Trubetzkoy (; 16 April 1890 – 25 June 1938) was a Russian linguist and historian whose teachings formed a nucleus of the Prague School of structural linguistics. He is widely considered to be the founder of morphophonology. He was also associated with the Russian Eurasianists.

==Life and career==
Trubetzkoy was born into privilege. His father, Sergei Nikolaevich Trubetskoy, came from a Lithuanian Gediminid princely family. In 1908, he enrolled at the Moscow University. While spending some time at the University of Leipzig, Trubetzkoy was taught by August Leskien, a pioneer of research into sound laws.

After he graduated from the Moscow University (1913), Trubetzkoy delivered lectures there until the Russian Revolution, when he moved first to the University of Rostov-on-Don, then to the University of Sofia (1920–1922) and finally took the chair of Professor of Slavic Philology at the University of Vienna (1922-1938). Trubetzkoy was involved with the Eurasianist movement and became one of their leading theorists and political leaders. After the emergence of &quot;left Eurasianism&quot; in Paris, where some of the movement&#x27;s leaders became pro-Soviet, Trubetzkoy who was a staunch anti-communist heavily criticised them and eventually broke with the Eurasianist movement.

He died from a heart attack attributed to Nazi persecution after he had published an article that was highly critical of Hitler&#x27;s theories.

Trubetzkoy&#x27;s chief contributions to linguistics lie in the domain of phonology, particularly in the analyses of the phonological systems of individual languages and in the search for general and universal phonological laws. His magnum opus, &quot;Grundzüge der Phonologie&quot; &quot;(Principles of Phonology)&quot; was issued posthumously in which he defined the phoneme as the smallest distinctive unit within the structure of a given language. It was crucial in establishing phonology as a discipline separate from phonetics.

Trubetzkoy also wrote as a literary critic. In &quot;Writings on Literature&quot;, a brief collection of translated articles, he analyzed Russian literature beginning with the Old Russian epic &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; and proceeding to 19th-century Russian poetry and Dostoevsky.

It is sometimes hard to distinguish Trubetzkoy&#x27;s views from those of his friend Roman Jakobson, who should be credited with spreading the Prague School views on phonology after Trubetzkoy&#x27;s death.

==As structuralist==

In his biography of the mathematical collective Nicolas Bourbaki, Amir Aczel described Trubetzkoy as a pioneer in structuralism, an interdisciplinary outgrowth of structural linguistics that would be applied in mathematics by the Bourbaki group, as in the notion of a mathematical structure, and in anthropology by Claude Lévi-Strauss, who sought to describe rules governing human behavior. According to Aczel, Trubetzkoy&#x27;s focus in &quot;Principles of Phonology&quot; was the study of phonemes and their opposing aspects to describe rules of language, the goal of describing general underlying rules being the common goal of structuralism.

<doc id="31136" wikidata="Q1098030" url="?curid=31136" title="Trekkies (film)">
<text>Trekkies is a 1997 documentary film directed by Roger Nygard about the devoted fans of Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot;. It is the first film released by Paramount Vantage, then known as Paramount Classics, and is presented by Denise Crosby, best known for her portrayal of Security Chief Tasha Yar on the first season of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

==Contents==
The film contains interviews with &quot;Star Trek&quot; devotees, more commonly known as Trekkies. The fans range from people who dress as Klingons to members of Brent Spiner fan clubs including a club that was formed as a result of his role in the film.

==Production==
After she worked with director Roger Nygard in his television film &quot;High Strung&quot; (1991), former &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; actress Denise Crosby suggested that they should work together on a documentary regarding &quot;Star Trek&quot; fandom. Nygard thought it was a good idea and was surprised that it had not been done before. The first filming session took place at the Fantasticon science fiction convention at the Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles organised by William Campbell. Nygard felt that the footage from this first convention was good enough to warrant continuing with the project.

==Release==
&quot;Trekkies&quot; received a national release in the United States on May 21, 1999. It was in direct competition with &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;.

==Reception==
Colin Covert gave three and a half stars in his review for the &quot;Star Tribune&quot;, adding that it was likely to shake up the viewers opinions of &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans. He praised the structure of the film, with the initial &quot;shock value&quot; of each fan being followed up with further background to round out the portrait. Renee Graham at the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; gave a similar opinion, saying that despite the expectation of the reviewer, none of the opinions put forward by &quot;Trekkies&quot; felt like a &quot;put-down&quot;. She summed up the documentary by saying &quot;The Trekkie phenomenon may fall short of common definitions of normalcy, but as a film, ″&quot;Trekkies&quot;″ sure beats sleeping outside for days to see a mediocre movie about some galaxy far, far away.&quot;

Bob Stauss, the film critic for the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; gave two and a half stars, saying that the documentary goes on too long and did not delve into the &quot;real psychological issues raised by such obsessive interest&quot;. He added that the fans were &quot;amusing for about 15 minutes, tops&quot; and that the cumulative effect of watching the fans for that long was &quot;numbing&quot;. James Verniere for the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; gave three stars, suggesting that Nygard may have found his niche as the &quot;Michael Moore of weirdness&quot; with this and his following film, &quot;Six Days in Roswell&quot;. Verniere suggested that &quot;Trekkies&quot; wasn&#x27;t as definitive as the film &quot;Free Enterprise&quot; (1999) but described it as an &quot;interesting, often hilarious piece of sociological comedy&quot;. Alicia Potter, also at the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, described the film as &quot;surreally funny&quot;.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 86% from 42 reviews with the consensus: &quot;To fan or not to fawn over: this lifelong and prosperous journey into a sometimes cringeworthy world makes &quot;Trekkies&quot; the lovable center of its universe.&quot;

==Sequels==
In 2004, a sequel was released, titled &quot;Trekkies 2&quot;. This documentary travels throughout the world, mainly in Europe, to show fans of &quot;Star Trek&quot; from outside the United States. It also revisits memorable fans featured in the previous film.

Nygard sought to answer some of the criticism received from Trekkies in the sequel, in that he was accused of not showing &quot;normal&quot; fans. With this in mind, he attempted to include some degree of a description of what was normal fan behaviour and what was more unusual.

In an interview with TrekNews.net at the &quot;Star Trek Mission: New York&quot; convention in September 2016, Crosby talked about the potential for another documentary about &quot;Star Trek&quot;:
We do want to make a Trekkies 3. In earnest, we’re hoping to get started in two more years. We have to time it with the rights and all the legal stuff. There’s a lot of politics involved. We approached CBS/Viacom/Paramount [who own various rights to Star Trek] already and there’s interest. So fingers crossed. When producing these documentaries, I’m always delighted by the surprise at something we didn’t expect, such as the stories people tell and interacting with the fans, hearing stories. I never get tired of it...&quot;

<doc id="31139" wikidata="Q3987325" url="?curid=31139" title="The Goodies">
<text>The Goodies were a trio of British comedians: Tim Brooke-Taylor (17 July 1940 – 12 April 2020), Graeme Garden (b. 18 February 1943) and Bill Oddie (b. 7 July 1941). The trio created, wrote for and performed in their eponymous television comedy show from 1970 until 1982, combining sketches and situation comedy.

==Beginnings==
The three actors met each other while undergraduates at the University of Cambridge, where Brooke-Taylor (Pembroke) was a law student, Garden (Emmanuel) was studying medicine and Oddie (Pembroke) was reading English. Their contemporaries included Graham Chapman, John Cleese and Eric Idle, who later became members of Monty Python, and with whom they became close friends. Brooke-Taylor and Cleese studied together and swapped lecture notes, for they were both law students, but at different colleges within the university. All three Goodies became members of the Cambridge University Footlights Club, with Brooke-Taylor becoming president in 1963, and Garden succeeding him as president in 1964.

In 1965, Eric Idle succeeded Garden as Footlights Club president. Idle had initially become aware of the Footlights when he auditioned for a &quot;smoker concert&quot; at Pembroke College in front of Brooke-Taylor and Oddie.

==Career before &quot;The Goodies&quot;==
Brooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie were cast members of the 1960s BBC radio comedy show &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot;, which also featured John Cleese, David Hatch and Jo Kendall, and lasted until 1973. &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot; resulted from the 1963 Cambridge University Footlights Club revue &quot;A Clump of Plinths&quot;. After having its title changed to &quot;Cambridge Circus&quot;, the revue went on to play in the West End in London, England, followed by a tour of New Zealand, then on Broadway in New York City (including an appearance on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot;).

They also took part in various TV shows with other people, including Brooke-Taylor in &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot; (with Cleese, Chapman and Marty Feldman). Brooke-Taylor also took part in &quot;Marty&quot; (with Marty Feldman, John Junkin and Roland MacLeod). In 1968 Brooke-Taylor appeared with Cleese, Michael Palin and Graham Chapman in &quot;How to Irritate People&quot;. Garden and Oddie took part in &quot;Twice a Fortnight&quot; (with Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Jonathan Lynn), before Brooke-Taylor, Garden, and Oddie worked on the late-1960s TV show &quot;Broaden Your Mind&quot; (of which only about ten minutes survives).

==&quot;The Goodies&quot; television series==

The original BBC television series ran from November 1970 to February 1980 on BBC 2, with 67 half-hour episodes and two forty-five-minute Christmas specials. The series was created by Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie, and originally co-written by all three, with Oddie providing the music for the show. Later episodes were co-written by Garden and Oddie.

It was one of the first shows in the UK to use chroma key and one of the first to use stop-motion techniques in a live action format. Other effects include hand editing for repeated movement, mainly used to make animals &quot;talk&quot; or &quot;sing&quot;, and play speed effects as used in the episode &quot;Kitten Kong&quot;. In the series, the threesome travelled on, and frequently fell off, a three-seater bicycle known to them as a &#x27;trandem&#x27;.

In September 1978, the trio appeared in character in an episode of the BBC1 television game show &quot;Star Turn Challenge&quot;, presented by Bernard Cribbins, in which teams of celebrities competed in acting games. Their opponents were three members of the cast of &quot;The Liver Birds&quot;, Nerys Hughes, Elizabeth Estensen and Michael Angelis. They also presented the Christmas 1976 edition of &quot;Disney Time&quot; from the toy department of Selfridges store in London, broadcast on BBC1 on Boxing Day at 5.50 pm.

The Goodies never had a formal contract with the BBC, and when the BBC Light Entertainment budget for 1980 was exhausted by the production of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; TV series, the Goodies signed a contract with London Weekend Television (LWT) for ITV. However, after one half-hour Christmas special (&quot;Snow White 2&quot;) in 1981, and a six-part series in early 1982, the series was cancelled. In later interviews the cast suggest the reasons were mainly economic, and that a typical Goodies sketch was more expensive than it appeared.

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;The Goodies&quot; won the Silver Rose at the Festival Rose d&#x27;Or, held in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1972 for a special episode, based on the &quot;original&quot; 1971 Goodies&#x27; &quot;Kitten Kong&quot; episode, titled &quot;Kitten Kong: Montreux &#x27;72 Edition&quot;. In the first episode of the next series, &quot;The New Office&quot;, Tim Brooke-Taylor can be seen painting the trophy gold.

&quot;The Goodies&quot; was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Programme in 1972, losing to &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;.

&quot;The Goodies&quot; won the Silver Rose in 1975 at the Festival Rose d&#x27;Or for their episode &quot;The Movies&quot;.

&quot;The Goodies&quot; was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Programme in 1976, losing to &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;.

===International releases and repeats of the TV series===
====Britain====

Unlike many long-running BBC comedy series, &quot;The Goodies&quot; has not enjoyed extensive repeats on terrestrial television in the UK. In 1986, BBC2 broadcast the episode &quot;Kitten Kong&quot; during a week of programmes screened under the banner &quot;TV-50&quot;, when the BBC celebrated 50 years of broadcasting. In the late 1980s the pan-European satellite-channel Super Channel broadcast a couple of episodes, and the short-lived Comedy Channel broadcast some of the later &quot;Goodies&quot; episodes in the early 1990s. Later UK Gold screened many of the earlier episodes, often with commercial timing cuts. The same episodes subsequently aired on UK Arena, also cut. When UK Arena became UK Drama, later UKTV Drama, &quot;The Goodies&quot; was dropped along with its other comedy and documentary shows.

The cast finally took matters into their own hands and arranged with Network Video for the release of a digitally-remastered &#x27;best of&#x27; selection entitled &quot;The Goodies ... At Last&quot; on VHS and Region 0 DVD in April 2003. A second volume, &quot;The Goodies ... At Last a Second Helping&quot; was released on Region 2 in February 2005. Series 9 (including the Xmas special) was released on Region 2 as &quot;The Goodies – The Complete LWT Series&quot; on 26 March 2007 and a fourth volume &quot;The Goodies ... At Last Back for More, Again&quot; was released on region 2 in 2010 as well as a DVD box set containing all four volumes to celebrate 40 years of &quot;The Goodies&quot;.

In 2004, an episode of the BBC documentary series &quot;Comedy Connections&quot; was devoted to the Goodies. During Christmas that year, Channel 5 repeated the classic 1973 episode &quot;The Goodies and the Beanstalk&quot;. Christmas 2005 saw a 90-minute &quot;Goodies&quot; special, a documentary about the series, &quot;Return of the Goodies&quot;, broadcast on BBC Two.

Early in 2006, a single episode (&quot;Winter Olympics&quot;) was broadcast on BBC Two. In February 2007, the 1982 LWT series was repeated on pay-TV channel Paramount 2.

In December 2010, BBC Two showed selected late-night repeats of the BBC series, which ran nightly from 23 to 30 December. This apparent gesture followed years of campaigning by The Goodies that the shows had not been repeated like other BBC shows such as &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; and &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;. The episodes shown were: &quot;Bunfight at the O.K. Tea Rooms&quot; / &quot;Earthanasia&quot; / &quot;The Goodies and the Beanstalk&quot; / &quot;Kitten Kong&quot; / &quot;Lighthouse Keeping Loonies&quot; / &quot;Saturday Night Grease&quot; / &quot;The Baddies&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Double Trouble&quot;) and &quot;The Stone Age&quot;, although &quot;Scoutrageous&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu Kapers&quot; and &quot;Scotland&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Loch Ness Monster&quot;) were originally billed as episodes 1, 2 and 7 of the repeat run. The episodes garnered good ratings given their time slot, and the first six episodes were taken from the BBC&#x27;s own master tapes, rather than the digital remasters, the rights to which are currently owned by Network Video. &quot;The Baddies&quot; and &quot;The Stone Age&quot; have never been digitally remastered.

On Sunday 8 June 2014, during a 1970s weekend, BBC Two repeated the Montreux &#x27;72 Edition of &quot;Kitten Kong&quot; once again; however, this has been the only episode to be repeated twice, and no full series have been repeated since.

In September 2018, Network released a box set titled &quot;The Goodies: The Complete BBC Collection&quot;. This set contains every single episode from 1970-1980 (excepting the lost, original version of &quot;Kitten Kong&quot;) and, as a bonus feature, a one-hour edit of the show &quot;An Audience with the Goodies&quot;, hosted by Stewart Lee and filmed live at Leicester Square in June 2018.

In late September 2022 the TV channel &#x27;That&#x27;s TV&#x27; (numbered 183 on SKY TV listings and 65 on Freeview) started showing the BBC episodes, one episode every day, starting with series one episode one on 26 September at 21.40. Series 2 started airing at 21.45 on 5 October. Series 3 started airing at 21:40 on 11 October. Series 4 started airing at 21:30 on 17 October. Series 5 started airing at 21:30 on 24 October. Series 6 started airing at 21:30 on 6 November. Some episodes are being aired in poor quality and/or black &amp; White as the tapes were sadly wiped for reuse by the BBC in the 1970s. Although there is a message before each episode stating; &#x27;This programme reflects the standards, language and attitudes of its time. Some viewers may find this content offensive&#x27;, it seems that not all episodes are being aired - noticeably the &#x27;Kitten Kong&#x27;, &#x27;Special Tax Edition&#x27; &amp; &#x27;The Goodies Rule – O.K.?&#x27; specials, but also series 2 episodes &#x27;Pollution&#x27;, &#x27;The Lost Tribe&#x27;, &#x27;Come Dancing&#x27;, &#x27;Gender Education, &#x27;Charity Bounce&#x27; &amp; &#x27;The Baddies&#x27;, series 3 episode &#x27;Superstar&#x27;, series 4 episodes &#x27;The Goodies and the Beanstalk&#x27; &amp; &#x27;The Race&#x27;, series 5 episodes &#x27;Scatty Safari&#x27; &amp; &#x27;South Africa&#x27; were not aired, with no notice or reason given.

====Australia====
In Australia, the series has had continued popularity. It was especially popular when it was repeated through the 1970s and 1980s by the ABC. As the show was typically broadcast in the 25-minute 6:00 pm children&#x27;s timeslot, portions often had to be cut. The 1981-82 LWT series was played once on the Seven Network in the early 1980s. The ABC screened the BBC episodes again in the early 1990s, but skipped several stories due to either inappropriate material for a children&#x27;s timeslot, or a lack of colour prints at the time. The BBC episodes were then heavily edited to allow time for commercials when repeated on Network Ten in the 1990s, before moving to the pay television channel UK.TV during the late 1990s and early 2000s, where they were screened in full. ABC2 ran re-runs of the series, beginning in 2010.

Three of the Goodies DVDs are available in Australia under different titles to the UK releases: &quot;The Goodies: 8 Delicious Episodes&quot;, &quot;The Goodies: A Tasty Second Helping&quot; and &quot;The Goodies: The Final Episodes&quot;, respectively. The Goodies&#x27; DVDs are also available in a boxed set with a commemorative booklet (&quot;The Goodies: The Tasty Box&quot;). This collection contains the same 16 episodes as the original two DVD releases but with additional material such as commentaries on several episodes and the original scripts of some episodes in PDF format. Picture quality has been greatly improved using digital restoration techniques and the episode &quot;Come Dancing&quot;, which was originally thought to only have survived as a black-and-white film recording, is presented in colour from a 625-line low-band broadcast standard PAL VT recording, made for training purposes, which has had the low-level colour boosted. (The original Australian DVD release, &quot;The Goodies – A Tasty Second Helping&quot; (2 disc set), and &quot;The Goodies – A Second Helping: 4 tasty serves&quot; (1 Disc), featured the b/w telerecording of this episode.)

====Canada====
In Canada, the series was shown in on the CBC national broadcast network during the late 1970s and early 1980s, in the traditional &quot;after school&quot; time slot, later a Friday night 10 pm slot, and occasionally in a midnight slot. Several episodes were also shown on the CTV Television Network. In the mid-1970s it was shown on TVOntario on Saturday evenings, repeated on Thursday evenings, until it was replaced by &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1976.

====Germany====
In Germany in 1972, German TV screened the 13-part variety show &quot;Engelbert and the Young Generation&quot;, a co-production between the BBC and German station ZDF in which The Goodies appeared in short 3-to-4-minute film sequences. The first six of these sequences were culled from the first and second series of &quot;The Goodies&quot;: &quot;Pets&quot; (from &quot;Kitten Kong&quot;), &quot;Pop Festival&quot; (from &quot;The Music Lovers&quot;), &quot;Keep Fit&quot; (from &quot;Commonwealth Games&quot;), &quot;Post Office&quot; (from &quot;Radio Goodies&quot;), &quot;Sleepwalking&quot; (from &quot;Snooze&quot;) and &quot;Factory Farm&quot; (from &quot;Fresh Farm Foods&quot;); and there were seven new film sequences, &quot;Good Deed Day&quot;, &quot;The Gym&quot;, &quot;The Country Code&quot;, &quot;Street Entertainers&quot;, &quot;Plum Pudding&quot;, &quot;Bodyguards&quot; and &quot;Pan&#x27;s Grannies&quot; – these also featured intro sequences with host Engelbert Humperdinck visiting the Goodies at their office. The shows were dubbed into German and because the Goodies part of the shows was more visual than dialogue-based, it translated very well.

Five of these new films were also cut together, with a new story involving The Goodies filling out their &quot;Tax Evasion&quot; form, as a special 25-minute &quot;Goodies&quot; compilation episode, &quot;A Collection of Goodies&quot;, first broadcast on BBC1 at 8.15 pm on 24 September 1972, and produced by Jim Franklin. &quot;The Country Code&quot; and &quot;Bodyguards&quot; were not used.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, the series was originally shown in full by the NZBC (later TV One) during the 1970s and 1980s. Since then, it has been re-run on SKY Network Television&#x27;s Comedy Central.

====Spain====
In Spain, a couple of episodes of &quot;The Goodies&quot; were shown as part of a season of television-award-winning programmes (the Goodies were Montreux Festival winners) on TVE 2 entitled &quot;Festival TV&quot; in 1981.

====United States====
In the US, the series was shown widely in syndication during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but has been little seen since. It was shown also on PBS stations, sometimes in tandem with &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.

==Goodies songs==

&quot;All Things Bright and Beautiful&quot; was released as a single credited to The Goodies in 1973, although it had been recorded in 1966 when they were part of &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot;.

The first true Goodies album, &quot;The Goodies Sing Songs From The Goodies&quot;, was released in 1973 and reissued as &quot;The World of the Goodies&quot; in 1974. &quot;The Goodies Theme&quot; was released as a single in 1973.

They had a string of successful chart singles penned by Bill Oddie. In 1974–75, they chalked up five hit singles in twelve months: &quot;The Inbetweenies&quot;, &quot;Black Pudding Bertha&quot;, &quot;Nappy Love&quot; and &quot;The Funky Gibbon&quot; (all performed during the episode &quot;The Goodies – Almost Live&quot;), and &quot;Make a Daft Noise for Christmas&quot;.

&quot;The Funky Gibbon&quot; was their biggest hit, reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. The Goodies made an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; with the song. They also performed it during the Amnesty International show &quot;A Poke in the Eye (with a Sharp Stick)&quot;. &quot;The Funky Gibbon&quot; became a favourite in the United States on Dr. Demento&#x27;s radio shows and reached number 79 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1975.

&quot;The New Goodies LP&quot;, which featured most of the hit singles, reached number 25 on the UK Albums Chart in 1975.

=== Goodies Theme ===
Three variations of the Goodies Theme were used on the opening titles for the 1970–1982 television series. Apart from the original Goodies Theme, used from 1970 to 1972 and released as a single, two other variations surfaced, one, with a contemporary feel from 1973–1974, sung by Bill and then the third and final theme for the rest of the series from 1975 onwards, again sung by Bill. This variation lasted for the rest of the TV series and also surfaced on later Goodies LPs and, eventually, singles.

==Other collaborations==
Tim Brooke-Taylor was a writer/performer on the television comedy series &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot; (which also included John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Marty Feldman in the cast), in which Eric Idle and Bill Oddie guest-starred in some of the episodes. The famous &quot;Four Yorkshiremen&quot; sketch was co-written by the four writers/performers of the series – Tim Brooke-Taylor, John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Marty Feldman.

Tim Brooke-Taylor was a cast member of the television comedy series &quot;Marty&quot; with Marty Feldman and John Junkin – a compilation of the two series of &quot;Marty&quot; has been released on a DVD with the title of &quot;It&#x27;s Marty&quot;.

Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member of John Cleese&#x27;s special &quot;How to Irritate People&quot;.

Along with John Junkin and Barry Cryer, Brooke-Taylor was a regular cast member of the long-running Radio 2 comedy sketch show &quot;Hello, Cheeky!&quot;, which ran from 1973 to 1979. The series also transferred to Yorkshire Television for two series in 1975 and 1976.

Tim Brooke-Taylor also appeared on BBC&#x27;s hospital comedy &quot;TLC&quot;, as well as the sitcoms &quot;You Must Be The Husband&quot; (with Diane Keen and Sheila Steafel), and &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; (with Richard O&#x27;Sullivan and Joan Sanderson). He also played in a televised pro-celebrity golf match opposite Bruce Forsyth.

Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie were writers/performers on the television comedy series &quot;Twice a Fortnight&quot; (which also included Terry Jones, Michael Palin and Jonathan Lynn in the cast).

Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden were writers/performers on the television comedy series &quot;Broaden Your Mind&quot;, with Bill Oddie joining them for the second series.

The three writers and performers also collaborated on the 1983 animated children&#x27;s programme &quot;Bananaman&quot;, where they played various voice roles.

Bill Oddie has occasionally appeared on the BBC Radio 4 panel game &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, on which Garden and Brooke-Taylor are regular panellists.

Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie worked on the television comedy &quot;Doctor in the House&quot;: they co-wrote most of the first series and all of the second. Garden also appeared as a television interviewer in the series, in the episode titled &quot;On the Box&quot;.

Between 1981 and 1983 Garden and Oddie wrote, but did not perform in, a science fiction sitcom called &quot;Astronauts&quot; for Central and ITV. The show was set in a British space station in the near future.

Garden was a regular team captain on the political satire game show &quot;If I Ruled the World&quot;. Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode, and during the game &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Disagree More&quot; he proposed that it was high time &quot;The Goodies&quot; episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to refute this statement, and replied &quot;I couldn&#x27;t disagree more...it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.&quot; This was followed by uproarious applause from the studio audience.

In 2004, Garden and Brooke-Taylor were co-presenters of Channel 4&#x27;s daytime game show &quot;Beat the Nation&quot;, in which they indulged in usual game show &quot;banter&quot;, but took the quiz itself seriously. Oddie hosts a very successful series of nature programmes for the BBC.

==Goodies reunion shows==

===2005 Australian reunion shows===
The trio reunited in Australia for &quot;The Goodies (Still A) Live on Stage&quot; as part of Sydney&#x27;s Big Laugh Comedy Festival in March 2005. The show toured the country, visiting Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra and selling out most of the 13 performances.

A further Australian tour by the Goodies, sans Bill, took place during November and December 2005.

===&quot;Return of the Goodies&quot; (2005)===
On 30 December, BBC2 broadcast a feature-length special, featuring some new material by Brooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie, linking clips from the original television series and interview footage.

===2006 and 2007 UK reunion shows===
Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden took their Goodies Live show to the 2006 Edinburgh Fringe festival. The show was similar to the second leg of the Goodies Australian tour, with Bill Oddie participating via video (due to his many filming commitments). The show was also performed at the Paramount Comedy Festival in Brighton in October 2006.

Brooke-Taylor and Garden performed the show at 22 further UK venues in 2007.

===2009 World&#x27;s Funniest Island and Riverside===
Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden appeared at Sydney&#x27;s Riverside Theatre (Parramatta) on 15 October 2009 and the World&#x27;s Funniest Island comedy festival on Cockatoo Island, Sydney Harbour on 17–18 October 2009. The show was hosted by Andrew Hansen of Australian comedy team The Chaser.

===2010 The One Show===
On 4 November 2010, The Goodies were once again reunited when the BBC1 magazine and chat show &quot;The One Show&quot; brought them back together.

===2013: &quot;An Oldie but a Goodie&quot;===
Bill Oddie toured Australia to present a series of one-man shows, &quot;An Oldie but a Goodie&quot;, during June 2013. The tour took in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. A video with the three Goodies was shown during the shows.

On 19 June 2013, Oddie made personal appearances on both &quot;The Project&quot; and the &quot;Adam Hills Tonight&quot; television shows in conjunction with the tour.

===2019: &quot;The Big Ben Theory&quot;===
The final time that The Goodies collaborated on a commercially available project was a single, hour-long audiobook created for Audible UK, entitled &quot;The Big Ben Theory&quot;. Scripted by Gareth Gwynn and John-Luke Roberts, along with Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie, and recorded in front of a highly appreciative live audience, the cast comprised Tim, Bill (an indisposed Graeme was replaced at the last minute by the project&#x27;s originator and producer, Barnaby Eaton-Jones), Joanna Lumley, Philip Pope, Jon Culshaw and Kate Harbour, with direction from Dirk Maggs. Graeme Garden&#x27;s own description reads ‘As Parliament falls apart and sinister dictators threaten the world, Tim, Graeme and Bill must save the day. They defeated Kitten Kong! They stuffed the Funky Gibbon! They invented Ecky Thump! Can they save Parliament as well? 52% say yes. 48% say no. But you just can&#x27;t rely on statistics, can you?!’ The audiobook, released by Audible on 9 October 2019, was intended to be the pilot for a forthcoming series of new episodes to be written and recorded in 2020; however, the project ended with Tim Brooke-Taylor’s death from complications from COVID-19 on 12 April that year in Cookham, Berkshire, aged 79.

In January 2022 it was announced that a series of novellas based on the planned Audible episodes was set to be published by Chinbeard Books, commencing with &quot;Avengers Dissemble&quot;, adapted by producer and writer Barnaby Eaton Jones, with a foreword by Joanna Lumley, and based on material co-devised with the Goodies. The first book is dedicated to Tim Brooke-Taylor, 2 years since his death from COVID-19 complications and published with the backing of Tim&#x27;s family and the 2 remaining Goodies: Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie, with a percentage of the royalties going to the charity Tim was President of for over 25 years – Thames Valley Adventure Playground.

==Cultural influence==
&quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; was started when Julian Barratt asked Noel Fielding if he wanted to make a modern-day Goodies.

The official Goodies fan club&#x27;s (Goodies Rule-OK!) newsletter is called the &quot;Clarion &amp; Globe&quot;. It was named after the newspaper in The Goodies&#x27; episode &quot;Fleet Street Goodies&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Cunning Stunts&quot;).

During the 1970s, &quot;Cor!!&quot; comic, released by Fleetway publications, had a &quot;Goodies&quot; comics strip. When the comic later merged with &quot;Buster&quot;, the &quot;Goodies&quot; did not move across, although the TV show was still running.

Australian rock band Spiderbait released a 1993 album and EP which contained a rocked-up fast cover version of the Goodies song &quot;Run&quot;.

Australian theatre company Shaolin Punk produced a short play titled &quot;A Record or an OBE&quot;, written by Melbourne comedian and actor Ben McKenzie, and featuring Tim and Graeme as characters. Set in 1975, the two remaining Goodies struggle to carry on after Bill leaves the group to pursue a music career. The play premiered in the 2007 Melbourne Fringe Festival, where it was highly commended in the Comedy category. Later seasons were also performed for the Adelaide Fringe and Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2008.

U.S. rock band The White Stripes named their 6th album &quot;Icky Thump&quot; in reference to The Goodies sketch &quot;The Battle of Ecky Thump&quot;. The name was changed from &quot;Ecky Thump&quot; to &quot;Icky Thump&quot; to make the title more palatable to an American teenage audience.

==Honours==
All three Goodies were awarded OBEs. Bill Oddie received his OBE in 2003 for wildlife conservation, while Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden received their OBEs in 2011 for services to light entertainment. The show often mocked OBEs: in particular, a running joke was that Tim desperately wanted to receive one.

== Awards ==
All three Goodies have been regular attendees at Slapstick Festival in Bristol, and in 2011 they were awarded the Aardman Slapstick Visual Comedy Legend Award at the festival for the significant contributions to the field of visual comedy they have made during their careers.

==Viewer incidents==
On 24 March 1975, Alex Mitchell, a 50-year-old bricklayer from King&#x27;s Lynn, literally died laughing while watching an episode of &quot;The Goodies&quot;. According to his wife, who was a witness, Mitchell was unable to stop laughing whilst watching a sketch in the episode &quot;Kung Fu Kapers&quot; in which Tim Brooke-Taylor, dressed as a kilted Scotsman, used a set of bagpipes to defend himself from a black pudding-wielding Bill Oddie (master of the ancient Lancastrian martial art &quot;Ecky-Thump&quot;) in a demonstration of the Scottish martial art of &quot;Hoots-Toot-ochaye&quot;. After twenty-five minutes of continuous laughter, Mitchell finally slumped on the settee and died from heart failure. His widow later sent the Goodies a letter thanking them for making Mitchell&#x27;s final moments so pleasant. In 2012, Mitchell&#x27;s granddaughter was diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome after suffering cardiac arrest. Because this condition is genetic, it is believed that Mitchell&#x27;s heart failure was triggered by an undiagnosed case of LQTS.

On 1 November 1977, Seema Bakewell, a 32-year-old housewife from Leicester, went into labour whilst laughing at a sketch in the &quot;Goodies&quot; episode &quot;Alternative Roots&quot;. She refused to leave home for the hospital until the episode had finished. Thirty years later, she visited the 2007 UK reunion tour with &quot;her baby, Ayesha, and the baby&#x27;s husband&quot; and recounted the story to Graeme Garden.

<doc id="31140" wikidata="Q40185" url="?curid=31140" title="Divine Comedy">
<text>The Divine Comedy ( ) is an Italian narrative poem by Dante Alighieri, begun and completed around 1321, shortly before the author&#x27;s death. It is widely considered the pre-eminent work in Italian literature and one of the greatest works of Western literature. The poem&#x27;s imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval worldview as it existed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: &quot;Inferno&quot;, &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, and &quot;Paradiso&quot;.

The poem discusses &quot;the state of the soul after death and presents an image of divine justice meted out as due punishment or reward&quot;, and describes Dante&#x27;s travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. Allegorically, the poem represents the soul&#x27;s journey towards God, beginning with the recognition and rejection of sin (&quot;Inferno&quot;), followed by the penitent Christian life (&quot;Purgatorio&quot;), which is then followed by the soul&#x27;s ascent to God (&quot;Paradiso&quot;). Dante draws on medieval Catholic theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy derived from the &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; of Thomas Aquinas.

In the poem, the pilgrim Dante is accompanied by three guides: Virgil, who represents human reason, and who guides him for all of &quot;Inferno&quot; and most of &quot;Purgatorio&quot;; Beatrice, who represents divine revelation in addition to theology, grace, and faith; and guides him from the end of &quot;Purgatorio&quot; onwards; and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, who represents contemplative mysticism and devotion to Mary the Mother, guiding him in the final cantos of &quot;Paradiso&quot;.

The work was originally simply titled Comedìa (, Tuscan for &quot;Comedy&quot;) – so also in the first printed edition, published in 1472 – later adjusted to the modern Italian . The adjective was added by Giovanni Boccaccio, owing to its subject matter and lofty style, and the first edition to name the poem &quot;Divina Comedia&quot; in the title was that of the Venetian humanist Lodovico Dolce, published in 1555 by Gabriele Giolito de&#x27; Ferrari.

== Structure and story ==

The &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; is composed of 14,233 lines that are divided into three &quot;cantiche&quot; (singular &quot;cantica&quot;) – &quot;Inferno&quot; (Hell), &quot;Purgatorio&quot; (Purgatory), and &quot;Paradiso&quot; (Paradise) – each consisting of 33 cantos (Italian plural &quot;canti&quot;). An initial canto, serving as an introduction to the poem and generally considered to be part of the first &quot;cantica&quot;, brings the total number of cantos to 100. It is generally accepted, however, that the first two cantos serve as a unitary prologue to the entire epic, and that the opening two cantos of each &quot;cantica&quot; serve as prologues to each of the three &quot;cantiche&quot;.

The number three is prominent in the work, represented in part by the number of &quot;cantiche&quot; and their lengths. Additionally, the verse scheme used, &quot;terza rima&quot;, is hendecasyllabic (lines of eleven syllables), with the lines composing tercets according to the rhyme scheme ABA BCB CDC DED... The total number of syllables in each tercet is thus 33, the same as the number of cantos in each &quot;cantica&quot;.

Written in the first person, the poem tells of Dante&#x27;s journey through the three realms of the dead, lasting from the night before Good Friday to the Wednesday after Easter in the spring of 1300. The Roman poet Virgil guides him through Hell and Purgatory; Beatrice, Dante&#x27;s ideal woman, guides him through Heaven. Beatrice was a Florentine woman he had met in childhood and admired from afar in the mode of the then-fashionable courtly love tradition, which is highlighted in Dante&#x27;s earlier work &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;. The Cistercian abbot Bernard of Clairvaux guides Dante through the last three cantos.

The structure of the three realms follows a common numerical pattern of 9 plus 1, for a total of 10. There are nine circles of the Inferno, followed by Lucifer contained at its bottom; nine rings of Mount Purgatory, followed by the Garden of Eden crowning its summit; and the nine celestial bodies of Paradiso, followed by the Empyrean containing the very essence of God. Within each group of nine, seven elements correspond to a specific moral scheme, subdivided into three subcategories, while two others of greater particularity are added to total nine. For example, the seven deadly sins that are cleansed in Purgatory are joined by special realms for the late repentant and the excommunicated. The core seven sins within Purgatory correspond to a moral scheme of love perverted, subdivided into three groups corresponding to excessive love (Lust, Gluttony, Greed), deficient love (Sloth), and malicious love (Wrath, Envy, Pride).

In central Italy&#x27;s political struggle between Guelphs and Ghibellines, Dante was part of the Guelphs, who in general favoured the papacy over the Holy Roman Emperor. Florence&#x27;s Guelphs split into factions around 1300the White Guelphs and the Black Guelphs. Dante was among the White Guelphs who were exiled in 1302 by the Lord-Mayor Cante de&#x27; Gabrielli di Gubbio, after troops under Charles of Valois entered the city, at the request of Pope Boniface VIII, who supported the Black Guelphs. This exile, which lasted the rest of Dante&#x27;s life, shows its influence in many parts of the &quot;Comedy&quot;, from prophecies of Dante&#x27;s exile to Dante&#x27;s views of politics, to the eternal damnation of some of his opponents.

The last word in each of the three &quot;cantiche&quot; is &quot;stelle&quot; (&quot;stars&quot;).
=== &quot;Inferno&quot; ===
The poem begins on the night before Good Friday in the year 1300, &quot;halfway along our life&#x27;s path&quot; (&quot;Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita&quot;). Dante is thirty-five years old, half of the biblical lifespan of seventy (Psalms 89:10, Vulgate), lost in a dark wood (understood as sin), assailed by beasts (a lion, a leopard, and a she-wolf) he cannot evade and unable to find the &quot;straight way&quot; (&quot;diritta via&quot;) to salvation (symbolised by the sun behind the mountain). Conscious that he is ruining himself and that he is falling into a &quot;low place&quot; (&quot;basso loco&quot;) where the sun is silent (&quot;&#x27;l sol tace&quot;), Dante is at last rescued by Virgil, and the two of them begin their journey to the underworld. Each sin&#x27;s punishment in &quot;Inferno&quot; is a &quot;contrapasso&quot;, a symbolic instance of poetic justice; for example, in Canto XX, fortune-tellers and soothsayers must walk with their heads on backwards, unable to see what is ahead, because that was what they had tried to do in life:

Allegorically, the &quot;Inferno&quot; represents the Christian soul seeing sin for what it really is, and the three beasts represent three types of sin: the self-indulgent, the violent, and the malicious. These three types of sin also provide the three main divisions of Dante&#x27;s Hell: Upper Hell, outside the city of Dis, for the four sins of indulgence (lust, gluttony, avarice, anger); Circle 7 for the sins of violence against one&#x27;s neighbor, against oneself, and against God, art, and nature; and Circles 8 and 9 for the sins of fraud and treachery. Added to these are two dissimilar, spiritual categories: Limbo, in Circle 1, contains the virtuous pagans who were not sinful but were ignorant of Christ, and Circle 6 contains the heretics who contradicted the doctrine and confused the spirit of Christ.

=== &quot;Purgatorio&quot; ===
Having survived the depths of Hell, Dante and Virgil ascend out of the undergloom to the Mountain of Purgatory on the far side of the world. The Mountain is on an island, the only land in the Southern Hemisphere, created by the displacement of rock which resulted when Satan&#x27;s fall created Hell (which Dante portrays as existing underneath Jerusalem). The mountain has seven terraces, corresponding to the seven deadly sins or &quot;seven roots of sinfulness&quot;. The classification of sin here is more psychological than that of the &quot;Inferno&quot;, being based on motives, rather than actions. It is also drawn primarily from Christian theology, rather than from classical sources. However, Dante&#x27;s illustrative examples of sin and virtue draw on classical sources as well as on the Bible and on contemporary events.

Love, a theme throughout the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, is particularly important for the framing of sin on the Mountain of Purgatory. While the love that flows from God is pure, it can become sinful as it flows through humanity. Humans can sin by using love towards improper or malicious ends (Wrath, Envy, Pride), or using it to proper ends but with love that is either not strong enough (Sloth) or love that is too strong (Lust, Gluttony, Greed). Below the seven purges of the soul is the Ante-Purgatory, containing the Excommunicated from the church and the Late repentant who died, often violently, before receiving rites. Thus the total comes to nine, with the addition of the Garden of Eden at the summit, equaling ten. 

Allegorically, the &quot;Purgatorio&quot; represents the Christian life. Christian souls arrive escorted by an angel, singing &quot;In exitu Israel de Aegypto&quot;. In his letter to Cangrande (the authenticity of which is disputed), Dante explains that this reference to Israel leaving Egypt refers both to the redemption of Christ and to &quot;the conversion of the soul from the sorrow and misery of sin to the state of grace.&quot; Appropriately, therefore, it is Easter Sunday when Dante and Virgil arrive.

The &quot;Purgatorio&quot; demonstrates the medieval knowledge of a spherical Earth. During the poem, Dante discusses the different stars visible in the southern hemisphere, the altered position of the sun, and the various time zones of the Earth. At this stage it is, Dante says, sunset at Jerusalem, midnight on the River Ganges, and sunrise in Purgatory.

=== &quot;Paradiso&quot; ===

After an initial ascension, Beatrice guides Dante through the nine celestial spheres of Heaven. These are concentric and spherical, as in Aristotelian and Ptolemaic cosmology. While the structures of the &quot;Inferno&quot; and &quot;Purgatorio&quot; were based on different classifications of sin, the structure of the &quot;Paradiso&quot; is based on the four cardinal virtues and the three theological virtues.

The seven lowest spheres of Heaven deal solely with the cardinal virtues of Prudence, Fortitude, Justice and Temperance. The first three spheres involve a deficiency of one of the cardinal virtues – the Moon, containing the inconstant, whose vows to God waned as the moon and thus lack fortitude; Mercury, containing the ambitious, who were virtuous for glory and thus lacked justice; and Venus, containing the lovers, whose love was directed towards another than God and thus lacked temperance. The final four incidentally are positive examples of the cardinal virtues, all led on by the Sun, containing the prudent, whose wisdom lighted the way for the other virtues, to which the others are bound (constituting a category on its own). Mars contains the men of fortitude who died in the cause of Christianity; Jupiter contains the kings of justice; and Saturn contains the temperate, the monks. The seven subdivided into three are raised further by two more categories: the eighth sphere of the fixed stars that contain those who achieved the theological virtues of faith, hope, and love, and represent the Church Triumphant – the total perfection of humanity, cleansed of all the sins and carrying all the virtues of heaven; and the ninth circle, or Primum Mobile (corresponding to the geocentricism of medieval astronomy), which contains the angels, creatures never poisoned by original sin. Topping them all is the Empyrean, which contains the essence of God, completing the nine-fold division to ten.

Dante meets and converses with several great saints of the Church, including Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, Saint Peter, and St. John. Near the end, Beatrice departs and Bernard of Clairvaux takes over as the guide. The &quot;Paradiso&quot; is more theological in nature than the &quot;Inferno&quot; and the &quot;Purgatorio&quot;. However, Dante admits that the vision of heaven he receives is merely the one his human eyes permit him to see, and thus Dante&#x27;s personal vision.

The &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; finishes with Dante seeing the Triune God. In a flash of understanding that he cannot express, Dante finally understands the mystery of Christ&#x27;s divinity and humanity, and his soul becomes aligned with God&#x27;s love:

== History ==

=== Manuscripts ===
According to the Italian Dante Society, no original manuscript written by Dante has survived, although there are many manuscript copies from the 14th and 15th centuries – some 800 are listed on their site.

=== Early translations ===
Coluccio Salutati translated some quotations from the &quot;Comedy&quot; into Latin for his &quot;De fato et fortuna&quot; in 1396–1397. The first complete translation of the &quot;Comedy&quot; was made into Latin prose by Giovanni da Serravalle in 1416 for two English bishops, Robert Hallam and Nicholas Bubwith, and an Italian cardinal, Amedeo di Saluzzo. It was made during the Council of Constance. The first verse translation, into Latin hexameters, was made in 1427–1431 by .

The first translation of the &quot;Comedy&quot; into another vernacular was the prose translation into Castilian completed by Enrique de Villena in 1428. The first vernacular verse translation was that of Andreu Febrer into Catalan in 1429.

=== Early printed editions ===


The first printed edition was published in Foligno, Italy, by Johann Numeister and Evangelista Angelini da Trevi on 1472. Of the 300 copies printed, fourteen still survive. The original printing press is on display in the &quot;Oratorio della Nunziatella&quot; in Foligno.

== Thematic concerns ==
The &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; can be described simply as an allegory: each canto, and the episodes therein, can contain many alternative meanings. Dante&#x27;s allegory, however, is more complex, and, in explaining how to read the poem (see the &quot;Letter to Cangrande&quot;) he outlines other levels of meaning besides the allegory: the historical, the moral, the literal, and the anagogical.

The structure of the poem is also quite complex, with mathematical and numerological patterns distributed throughout the work, particularly threes and nines. The poem is often lauded for its particularly human qualities: Dante&#x27;s skillful delineation of the characters he encounters in Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise; his bitter denunciations of Florentine and Italian politics; and his powerful poetic imagination. Dante&#x27;s use of real characters, according to Dorothy Sayers in her introduction to her translation of the &quot;Inferno&quot;, allows Dante the freedom of not having to involve the reader in description, and allows him to &quot;[make] room in his poem for the discussion of a great many subjects of the utmost importance, thus widening its range and increasing its variety.&quot;

Dante called the poem &quot;Comedy&quot; (the adjective &quot;Divine&quot; was added later, in the 16th century) because poems in the ancient world were classified as High (&quot;Tragedy&quot;) or Low (&quot;Comedy&quot;). Low poems had happy endings and were written in everyday language, whereas High poems treated more serious matters and were written in an elevated style. Dante was one of the first in the Middle Ages to write of a serious subject, the Redemption of humanity, in the low and &quot;vulgar&quot; Italian language and not the Latin one might expect for such a serious topic. Boccaccio&#x27;s account that an early version of the poem was begun by Dante in Latin is still controversial.

=== Scientific themes ===
Although the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; is primarily a religious poem, discussing sin, virtue, and theology, Dante also discusses several elements of the science of his day (this mixture of science with poetry has received both praise and criticism over the centuries). The &quot;Purgatorio&quot; repeatedly refers to the implications of a spherical Earth, such as the different stars visible in the southern hemisphere, the altered position of the sun, and the various time zones of the Earth. For example, at sunset in Purgatory it is midnight at the Ebro, dawn in Jerusalem, and noon on the River Ganges:

Dante travels through the centre of the Earth in the &quot;Inferno&quot;, and comments on the resulting change in the direction of gravity in Canto XXXIV (lines 76–120). A little earlier (XXXIII, 102–105), he queries the existence of wind in the frozen inner circle of hell, since it has no temperature differentials.
Inevitably, given its setting, the &quot;Paradiso&quot; discusses astronomy extensively, but in the Ptolemaic sense. The &quot;Paradiso&quot; also discusses the importance of the experimental method in science, with a detailed example in lines 94–105 of Canto II:

A briefer example occurs in Canto XV of the &quot;Purgatorio&quot; (lines 16–21), where Dante points out that both theory and experiment confirm that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Other references to science in the &quot;Paradiso&quot; include descriptions of clockwork in Canto XXIV (lines 13–18), and Thales&#x27; theorem about triangles in Canto XIII (lines 101–102).

Galileo Galilei is known to have lectured on the &quot;Inferno&quot;, and it has been suggested that the poem may have influenced some of Galileo&#x27;s own ideas regarding mechanics.

== Influences ==


=== Classical ===
Without access to the works of Homer, Dante used Virgil, Lucan, Ovid, and Statius as the models for the style, history, and mythology of the &quot;Comedy&quot;. This is most obvious in the case of Virgil, who appears as a mentor character throughout the first two canticles and who has his epic, the &quot;Aeneid,&quot; praised with language Dante reserves elsewhere for Scripture. Ovid is given less explicit praise in the poem, but besides Virgil, Dante uses Ovid as a source more than any other poet, mostly through metaphors and fantastical episodes based on those in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Less influential than either of the two are Statius and Lucan, the latter of whom has only been given proper recognition as a source in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; in the twentieth century.

Besides Dante&#x27;s fellow poets, the classical figure that most influenced the &quot;Comedy&quot; is Aristotle. Dante built up the philosophy of the &quot;Comedy&quot; with the works of Aristotle as a foundation, just as the scholastics used Aristotle as the basis for their thinking. Dante knew Aristotle directly from Latin translations of his works and indirectly from quotations in the works of Albertus Magnus. Dante even acknowledges Aristotle&#x27;s influence explicitly in the poem, specifically when Virgil justifies the Inferno&#x27;s structure by citing the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;. In the same canto, Virgil draws on Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Officiis&quot; to explain why sins of the intellect are worse than sins of violence, a key point that would be explored from canto XVIII to the end of the &quot;Inferno&quot;.

=== Christian ===
The &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;″s language is often derived from the phraseology of the Vulgate. This was the only translation of the Bible Dante had access to, as it was one the vast majority of scribes were willing to copy during the Middle Ages. This includes five hundred or so direct quotes and references Dante derives from the Bible (or his memory of it). Dante also treats the Bible as a final authority on any matter, including on subjects scripture only approaches allegorically.

The &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; is also a product of Scholasticism, especially as expressed by St. Thomas Aquinas. This influence is most pronounced in the &quot;Paradiso&quot;, where the text&#x27;s portrayals of God, the beatific vision, and substantial forms all align with scholastic doctrine. It is also in the &quot;Paradiso&quot; that Aquinas and fellow scholastic St. Bonaventure appear as characters, introducing Dante to all of Heaven&#x27;s wisest souls. Consequently, the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; has been called &quot;the &quot;Summa&quot; in verse&quot;. Despite all this, there are issues on which Dante diverges from the scholastic doctrine, such as in his unbridled praise for poetry. 

The Apocalypse of Peter is one of the earliest examples of a Christian-Jewish katabasis, a genre of explicit depictions of heaven and hell. Later works inspired by it include the Apocalypse of Thomas in the 2nd–4th century, and more importantly, the Apocalypse of Paul in the 4th century. Despite a lack of &quot;official&quot; approval, the Apocalypse of Paul would go on to be popular for centuries, possibly due to its popularity among the medieval monks that copied and preserved manuscripts in the turbulent centuries following the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; belongs to the same genre and was influenced by the Apocalypse of Paul.

=== Islamic ===
Dante lived in a Europe of substantial literary and philosophical contact with the Muslim world, encouraged by such factors as Averroism (&quot;Averrois, che&#x27;l gran comento feo&quot; Commedia, Inferno, IV, 144, meaning &quot;Averrois, who wrote the great comment&quot;) and the patronage of Alfonso X of Castile. Of the twelve wise men Dante meets in Canto X of the &quot;Paradiso&quot;, Thomas Aquinas and, even more so, Siger of Brabant were strongly influenced by Arabic commentators on Aristotle. Medieval Christian mysticism also shared the Neoplatonic influence of Sufis such as Ibn Arabi. Philosopher Frederick Copleston argued in 1950 that Dante&#x27;s respectful treatment of Averroes, Avicenna, and Siger of Brabant indicates his acknowledgement of a &quot;considerable debt&quot; to Islamic philosophy.

In 1919, Miguel Asín Palacios, a Spanish scholar and a Catholic priest, published &quot;La Escatología musulmana en la Divina Comedia&quot; (&quot;Islamic Eschatology in the Divine Comedy&quot;), an account of parallels between early Islamic philosophy and the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Palacios argued that Dante derived many features of and episodes about the hereafter from the spiritual writings of Ibn Arabi and from the Isra and Mi&#x27;raj, or night journey of Muhammad to heaven. The latter is described in the &quot;ahadith&quot; and the &quot;Kitab al Miraj&quot; (translated into Latin in 1264 or shortly before as &quot;Liber scalae Machometi&quot;, &quot;The Book of Muhammad&#x27;s Ladder&quot;), and has significant similarities to the &quot;Paradiso&quot;, such as a sevenfold division of Paradise, although this is not unique to the &quot;Kitab al Miraj&quot; or Islamic cosmology.

Many scholars have not been satisfied that Dante was influenced by the &quot;Kitab al Miraj&quot;. The 20th-century Orientalist Francesco Gabrieli expressed skepticism regarding the claimed similarities, and the lack of evidence of a vehicle through which it could have been transmitted to Dante. The Italian philologist Maria Corti pointed out that, during his stay at the court of Alfonso X, Dante&#x27;s mentor Brunetto Latini met Bonaventura de Siena, a Tuscan who had translated the &quot;Kitab al Miraj&quot; from Arabic into Latin. Corti speculates that Brunetto may have provided a copy of that work to Dante. René Guénon, a Sufi convert and scholar of Ibn Arabi, confirms in &quot;The Esoterism of Dante&quot; the theory of the Islamic influence (direct or indirect) on Dante. Palacios&#x27; theory that Dante was influenced by Ibn Arabi was satirised by the Turkish academic Orhan Pamuk in his novel &quot;The Black Book&quot;.

In addition to that, it has been claimed that &quot;Risālat al-Ghufrān&quot; (&quot;The Epistle of Forgiveness&quot;), a satirical work mixing Arabic poetry and prose written by Abu al-ʿAlaʾ al-Maʿarri around 1033 CE, had an influence on, or even inspired, Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;.
== Criticism and textual history ==
Critical reception of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; has varied considerably prior to its universal renown today. Although recognised as a masterpiece in the centuries immediately following its publication, the work largely fell into obscurity during the Enlightenment, with some notable exceptions: Vittorio Alfieri; Antoine de Rivarol, who translated the &quot;Inferno&quot; into French; and Giambattista Vico, who in the &quot;Scienza nuova&quot; and in the &quot;Giudizio su Dante&quot; inaugurated what would later become the romantic reappraisal of Dante, juxtaposing him to Homer.

The &quot;Comedy&quot; was &quot;rediscovered&quot; in the English-speaking world by William Blake – who illustrated several passages of the epic – and the Romantic writers of the 19th century. Later authors such as T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Samuel Beckett, C. S. Lewis and James Joyce have drawn on it for inspiration. The poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was its first American translator, and modern poets, including Seamus Heaney, Robert Pinsky, John Ciardi, W. S. Merwin, and Stanley Lombardo, have also produced translations of all or parts of the book. In Russia, beyond Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s translation of a few tercets, Osip Mandelstam&#x27;s late poetry has been said to bear the mark of a &quot;tormented meditation&quot; on the &quot;Comedy&quot;. In 1934, Mandelstam gave a modern reading of the poem in his labyrinthine &quot;Conversation on Dante&quot;. Erich Auerbach said Dante was the first writer to depict human beings as the products of a specific time, place and circumstance, as opposed to mythic archetypes or a collection of vices and virtues, concluding that this, along with the fully imagined world of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, suggests that the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; inaugurated literary realism and self-portraiture in modern fiction. In T. S. Eliot&#x27;s estimation, &quot;Dante and Shakespeare divide the world between them. There is no third.&quot; For Jorge Luis Borges the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; was &quot;the best book literature has achieved&quot;.

The &quot;Comedy&quot; is considered one originator of the encyclopedic novel across multiple formulations of the concept. Mendelson&#x27;s coinage of the term contrasted Dante&#x27;s initial ostracism with his later importance to Italian national identity, comparing this to the culture-building function of later encyclopedic authors like Shakespeare, Cervantes, or Melville.

=== English translations ===
The &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; has been translated into English more times than any other language, and new English translations of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; continue to be published regularly. Notable English translations of the complete poem include the following.

A number of other translators, such as Robert Pinsky, have translated the &quot;Inferno&quot; only.

== In popular culture ==
The &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; has been a source of inspiration for countless artists for almost seven centuries. There are many references to Dante&#x27;s work in literature. In music, Franz Liszt was one of many composers to write works based on the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. In contemporary music, Hozier&#x27;s 2023 album Unreal Unearth also draws inspiration from Dante&#x27;s epic. In sculpture, the work of Auguste Rodin includes themes from Dante. Sculptor Timothy Schmalz created a series of 100 sculptures, one for each canto, on the 700th anniversary of the date of Dante&#x27;s death, and many visual artists have illustrated Dante&#x27;s work, as shown by the examples above. There have also been many references to the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; in cinema, television, comics and video games.

<text>Transport for London (TfL) is a local government body responsible for most of the transport network in London, United Kingdom.

TfL is the successor organization of the London Passenger Transport Board, which was established in 1933, and several other bodies in the intervening years. Since the current organization&#x27;s creation in 2000 as part of the Greater London Authority (GLA), TfL has been responsible for operating multiple urban rail networks, including the London Underground and Docklands Light Railway, as well as London&#x27;s buses, taxis, principal road routes, cycling provision, trams, and river services. It does not control all National Rail services in London, although it is responsible for London Overground and Elizabeth line services. The underlying services are provided by a mixture of wholly owned subsidiary companies (principally London Underground), by private sector franchisees (the remaining rail services, trams and most buses) and by licensees (some buses, taxis and river services). Fares are controlled by TfL, rail services fares calculated using numbered zones across the capital.

TfL has overseen various initiatives and infrastructure projects. Throughout the 2000s, a new radio communication system was implemented across its underground lines. Passenger convenience systems, such as the Oyster card and contactless payments, were also provisioned around this time. During 2008, the consumption of alcohol was banned on TfL services; this move has led to a decrease in anti-social behaviour. On 16 August 2016, TfL oversaw the launch of the Night Tube scheme, which introduced through-the-night services on both the London Underground and London Overground. Perhaps the biggest undertaking it has been responsible for, in this case shared jointly with the national Department for Transport (DfT), was the commissioning of the Crossrail Project; since its completion in 2022, TfL has been responsible for franchising its operation as the Elizabeth line.

In addition to the GLA, the central British government used to provide regular funding for TfL. However, this was tapered off during the 2010s with the aim of the organisation becoming self-sufficient. Direct central government funding for operations ceased during 2018. During 2019–2020, TfL had a budget of £10.3 billion, 47% of which came from fares; the remainder came from grants, mainly from the GLA (33%), borrowing (8%), congestion charging and other income (12%). In 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, fare revenues dropped by 90% and TfL obtained multiple rounds of support from the British government. It also responded with various cutbacks, including a proposal for a 40% reduction in capital expenditure.

==History==
London&#x27;s transportation system was unified in 1933, with the creation of the London Passenger Transport Board, which was succeeded by London Transport Executive, London Transport Board, London Transport Executive (GLC), and London Regional Transport. From 1933 until 2000, these bodies used the London Transport brand.

Transport for London was created in 2000 as part of the Greater London Authority (GLA) by the Greater London Authority Act 1999. The first Commissioner of TfL was Bob Kiley. The first chair was then-Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, and the first deputy chair was Dave Wetzel. Livingstone and Wetzel remained in office until the election of Boris Johnson as Mayor in 2008. Johnson took over as chairman, and in February 2009 fellow-Conservative Daniel Moylan was appointed as his deputy.

Transport for London Corporate Archives holds business records for TfL and its predecessor bodies and transport companies. Some early records are also held on behalf of TfL Corporate Archives at the London Metropolitan Archives.

On 17 February 2003, the London congestion charge was introduced, covering the approximate area of the London Inner Ring Road. The congestion charge had been a manifesto promise by Ken Livingstone during the 2000 London Mayoral election. It was introduced to reduce congestion in the centre of the capital as well as to make London more attractive to business investment; the resulting revenue was to be invested in London&#x27;s transport system. At the time of its implementation, the scheme was the largest ever undertaken by a capital city.

During 2003, TfL took over responsibility for the London Underground, after terms for a controversial public-private partnership (PPP) maintenance contract had been agreed. While the Underground trains themselves were operated by the public sector, the infrastructure (track, trains, tunnels, signals, and stations) were to be leased to private firms for 30 years, during which these companies would implement various improvements. The two consortiums awarded contracts were Tube Lines and Metronet. In July 2007, following financial difficulties, Metronet was placed in administration and its responsibilities were transferred back into public ownership under TfL in May 2008. During 2009, Tube Lines, having encountered a funding shortfall for its upgrades, was denied a request to TfL for an additional £1.75billion; the matter was instead referred to the PPP arbiter, who stated that £400million should be provided. On 7 May 2010, Transport for London agreed to buy out Bechtel and Amey (Ferrovial), the shareholders of Tube Lines for £310million, formally ending the PPP.

TfL was heavily impacted by multiple bombings on the underground and bus systems on 7 July 2005. Numerous TfL staff were recognised in the 2006 New Year honours list for the actions taken on that day, including aiding survivors, removing bodies, and restoring the transport system so that millions of commuters were able to depart London at the end of the workday. The incident was heavily scrutinised, leading to various long term changes being proposed by groups such as London Assembly, including the accelerated implementation of underground radio connectivity.

On 20 February 2006, the DfT announced that TfL would take over management of services then provided by Silverlink Metro. On 5 September 2006, the London Overground branding was announced, and it was confirmed that the extended East London line would be included. On 11 November 2007, TfL took over the North London Railway routes from Silverlink Metro. At the launch, TfL undertook to revamp the routes by improving service frequencies and station facilities, staffing all stations, introducing new rolling stock and allowing Oyster pay as you go throughout the network from the outset. This launch was accompanied by a marketing campaign entitled &quot;London&#x27;s new train set&quot;, with posters and leaflets carrying an image of model railway packaging containing new Overground trains, tracks and staff.

On 1 June 2008, the drinking of alcoholic beverages was banned on Tube and London Overground trains, buses, trams, Docklands Light Railway and all stations operated by TfL across London but not those operated by other rail companies. Carrying open containers of alcohol was also banned on public transport operated by TfL. The then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson and TfL announced the ban with the intention of providing a safer and more pleasant experience for passengers. There were &quot;Last Round on the Underground&quot; parties on the night before the ban came into force. Passengers refusing to observe the ban may be refused travel and asked to leave the premises. The GLA reported in 2011 that assaults on London Underground staff had fallen by 15% since the introduction of the ban.

Between 2008 and 2022, TfL was engaged in the Crossrail programme to construct a new high-frequency hybrid urban–suburban rail service across London and into its suburbs. TfL Rail took over Heathrow Connect services from Paddington to Heathrow in May 2018. In August 2018, four months before the scheduled opening of the core section of the Elizabeth Line, it was announced that completion had been delayed and that the line would not open before autumn 2019. Further postponements ensued. Having an initial budget of £14.8billion, the total cost of Crossrail rose to £18.25billion by November 2019, and increased further to £18.8billion by December 2020. On 17 May 2022, the line was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in honour of her Platinum Jubilee.

TfL commissioned a survey in 2013 which showed that 15% of women using public transport in London had been the subject of some form of unwanted sexual behaviour but that 90% of incidents were not reported to the police. In an effort to reduce sexual offences and increase reporting, TfL—in conjunction with the British Transport Police, Metropolitan Police Service, and City of London Police—launched Project Guardian. In 2014, TfL launched the 100 years of women in transport campaign in partnership with the Department for Transport, Crossrail, Network Rail, the Women&#x27;s Engineering Society and the Women&#x27;s Transportation Seminar (WTS). The programme was a celebration of the significant role that women had played in transport over the previous 100 years, following the centennial anniversary of the First World War, when 100,000 women entered the transport industry to take on the responsibilities held by men who enlisted for military service.

As early as 2014, an Ultra–Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) was under consideration since 2014 under London Mayor Boris Johnson. Johnson announced in 2015 that the zone covering the same areas as the congestion charge would come into operation in September 2020. Sadiq Khan, Johnson&#x27;s successor, introduced an emissions surcharge, called the Toxicity Charge or &quot;T-Charge&quot;, for non-compliant vehicles from 2017. The Toxicity Charge was replaced by the Ultra Low Emission Zone on 8 April 2019, which was introduced ahead of schedule. On 29 August 2023, the ULEZ was expanded to cover all 32 London boroughs, bringing an additional five million people into the zone.

During 2020, passenger numbers, along with associated revenue, went into a sharp downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. In response, TfL services were reduced; specifically, all Night Overground and Night Tube services, as well as all services on the Waterloo &amp; City line, were suspended from 20 March, while 40 tube stations were closed on the same day. The Mayor of London and TfL urged people to only use public transport if absolutely essential so that it could be used by critical workers. The London Underground brought in new measures on 25 March to combat the spread of the virus; these included slowing the flow of passengers onto platforms via the imposition of queuing at ticket gates and turning off some escalators. In April, TfL trialled changes encouraging passengers to board London buses by the middle doors to lessen the risks to drivers, after the deaths of 14 TfL workers including nine drivers. This measure was extended to all routes on 20 April, and passengers were no longer required to pay, so that they did not need to use the card reader near the driver.

==Organisation==
TfL is controlled by a board whose members are appointed by the Mayor of London, a position held by Sadiq Khan since May 2016. The Commissioner of Transport for London reports to the Board and leads a management team with individual functional responsibilities.

The body is organised in two main directorates and corporate services, each with responsibility for different aspects and modes of transport. The two main directorates are:
* London Underground, responsible for running London&#x27;s underground rail network, commonly known as &quot;the tube&quot;, and managing the provision of maintenance services by the private sector. This network is sub-divided into different service delivery units:
** London Underground
*** Deep Tube: Bakerloo, Central, Victoria, Waterloo &amp; City, Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines.
*** SSL (Sub Surface Lines): Metropolitan, District, Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines.
** Elizabeth line, a high-frequency hybrid urban–suburban rail service on dedicated infrastructure in central London (built as part of the Crossrail Project); and on National Rail lines to the east and west of the city. Operation is undertaken by MTR Elizabeth line, a private-sector concessionaire, and maintenance by Network Rail.
* Surface Transport, consisting of:
** Docklands Light Railway (DLR): an automatically driven light metro network in East and South London, although actual operation and maintenance is undertaken by a private-sector concessionaire (a joint venture of Keolis and Amey).
** London Buses, responsible for managing the red bus network throughout London and branded services including East London Transit, largely by contracting services to various private sector bus operators. Incorporating CentreComm, London Buses Command &amp; Control Centre, a 24-hour Emergency Control Centre based in Southwark.
** London Dial-a-Ride, which provides community transport services throughout London.
** London Overground, which consists of certain suburban National Rail services within London. Operation is undertaken by Arriva Rail London, a private-sector concessionaire, and maintenance by Network Rail.
** London River Services, responsible for licensing and co-ordinating passenger services on the River Thames within London.
** London Streets, responsible for the management of London&#x27;s strategic road network.
** London Trams, responsible for managing London&#x27;s tram network, by contracting to private sector operators. At present the only tram system is Tramlink in South London, contracted to FirstGroup, but others are proposed.
** London congestion charge, a fee charged on most cars and motor vehicles being driven within the Congestion Charge Zone in Central London.
** Public Carriage Office, responsible for licensing the famous black cab taxis and private hire vehicles.
** Victoria Coach Station, which owns and operates London&#x27;s principal terminal for long-distance bus and coach services.
** &quot;Delivery Planning&quot; which promotes cycling in London, including the construction of Cycle Superhighways.
** &quot;Special Projects Team&quot; manages the contract with Serco for the Santander Cycles bike rental scheme.
** Walking, which promotes better pedestrian access and better access for walking in London.
** London Road Safety Unit, which promotes safer roads through advertising and road safety measure.
** Community Safety, Enforcement and Policing, responsible for tackling fare evasion on buses, delivering policing services that tackle crime and disorder on public transport in co-operation with the Metropolitan Police Service&#x27;s Transport Operational Command Unit (TOCU) and the British Transport Police.
** Traffic Enforcement, responsible for enforcing traffic and parking regulations on the red routes.
** Freight Unit, which has developed the &quot;London Freight Plan&quot; and is involved with setting up and supporting a number of Freight Quality Partnerships covering key areas of London.

===Operations centre===

TfL&#x27;s Surface Transport and Traffic Operations Centre (STTOC) was officially opened by Prince Andrew, Duke of York, in November 2009. The centre monitors and coordinates official responses to traffic congestion, incidents and major events in London. Network Management Control Centre (manages the bus network) (NMCC), London Streets Traffic Control Centre (LSTCC) and the Metropolitan Police Traffic Operation Control Centre (MetroComm) were brought together under STTOC.

STTOC played an important part in the security and smooth running of the 2012 Summer Olympics. The London Underground Network Operations Centre is now located on the fifth floor of Palestra and not within STTOC. The centre featured in the 2013 BBC Two documentary series &quot;The Route Masters: Running London&#x27;s Roads&quot;.

===Connect project===
Transport for London introduced the &quot;Connect&quot; project for radio communications during the 2000s, to improve radio connections for London Underground staff and the emergency services. The system replaced various separate radio systems for each tube line, and was funded under a private finance initiative. The supply contract was signed in November 1999 with Motorola as the radio provider alongside Thales. Citylink&#x27;s shareholders are Thales Group (33 per cent), Fluor Corporation (18%), Motorola (10%), Laing Investment (19.5%) and HSBC (19.5%). The cost of the design, build and maintain contract was £2 billion over twenty years. Various subcontractors were used for the installation work, including Brookvex and Fentons.

A key reasoning for the introduction of the system was in light of the King&#x27;s Cross fire disaster, where efforts by the emergency services were hampered by a lack of radio coverage below ground. Work was due to be completed by the end of 2002, although suffered delays due to the necessity of installing the required equipment on an ageing railway infrastructure with no disruption to the operational railway. On 5 June 2006, the London Assembly published the 7 July Review Committee report, which urged TfL to speed up implementation of the Connect system.

The East London line was chosen as the first line to receive the TETRA radio in February 2006, as it was the second smallest line and is a mix of surface and sub surface. That same year, it was rolled out to the District, Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City, Metropolitan and Victoria lines, with the Bakerloo, Piccadilly, Jubilee, Waterloo &amp; City and Central lines following during 2007. The final line, the Northern, was handed over in November 2008.

The 2010 TfL investment programme included the project &quot;LU-PJ231 LU-managed Connect communications&quot;, which provided Connect with a new transmission and radio system comprising 290 cell sites with two to three base stations, 1,400 new train mobiles, 7,500 new telephone links and 180 CCTV links.

=== London Transport Museum ===
TfL also owns and operates the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden, a museum that conserves, explores and explains London&#x27;s transport system heritage over the last 200 years. It both explores the past, with a retrospective look at past days since 1800, and the present-day transport developments and upgrades. The museum also has an extensive depot, situated at Acton, that contains material impossible to display at the central London museum, including many additional road vehicles, trains, collections of signs and advertising materials. The depot has several open weekends each year. There are also occasional heritage train runs on the Metropolitan line.

===Financing===
The majority of TfL&#x27;s funding is provided by the GLA and the Mayor of London. Traditionally, the British government via the Department for Transport (DfT) also used to contribute considerably; however, throughout the 2010s, there was a concerted drive by the Conservative government to reduce central government expenditure on TfL, and that the organisation ought to pursue self-sufficiency and make greater efforts to generate its own revenue to supplement its grants. Accordingly, the operational budget of almost £700 million per year provided by the DfT by 2015 was to be entirely eliminated by 2020.

By February 2018, TfL was projecting a budget deficit of £1 billion, a roughly five-fold increase from 2013, which reportedly threatened its long-term investment plans. Revenue collected from fares was set to make up a greater proportion of TfL&#x27;s budget, yet a £240 million downturn in ticket sales by mid-2018 had been recorded. In September 2019, a TfL application for government funding to upgrade the Piccadilly Line was rejected by the Treasury. That same month, TfL head Mike Brown publicly criticised the government&#x27;s decision to impose borrowing limits upon the organisation, and there was little long term certainty in terms of funding, necessitating pauses on multiple upgrade programmes.

On 22 April 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, London mayor Sadiq Khan warned that TfL could run out of money to pay staff by the end of the month unless the government stepped in. Two days later, TfL announced it was furloughing around 7,000 employees, about a quarter of its staff, to help mitigate a 90% reduction in fare revenues. Following the implementation of a lockdown in London on 23 March, Tube journeys had reportedly fallen by 95% and bus journeys by 85%, though TfL continued to operate limited services to allow &quot;essential travel&quot; for key workers. Without government financial support for TfL, London Assembly members warned that Crossrail, the Northern line extension and other projects such as step-free schemes at tube stations could be delayed.

On 7 May, it was reported that TfL had requested £2 billion in state aid to keep services running until September 2020. On 12 May, TfL documents warned it expected to lose £4 billion due to the pandemic and said it needed £3.2bn to balance a proposed emergency budget for 2021, having lost 90% of its overall income. Without an agreement with the government, deputy mayor for transport Heidi Alexander said TfL might have to issue a Section 114 notice - the equivalent of a public body going bust. On 14 May, the UK Government agreed £1.6 billion in emergency funding to keep Tube and bus services running until September - a bailout condemned as &quot;a sticking plaster&quot; by Khan who called for agreement on a new longer-term funding model.

On 1 June 2020, TfL released details of its emergency budget for 2020–2021; it involved a reduction in capital investment by 39% from £1.3 billion to £808 million along with cuts to maintenance and renewal spending by 38% to £201 million. In November 2021, the then Transport Secretary Grant Shapps criticised reports that senior TfL officials would be offered bonuses potentially in excess of £12 million per year in return for efforts to help break-even. By December 2021, the British government and the Major of London had implemented three consecutive short-term funding agreements cumulatively costing in excess of £4b to avert closures of several bus routes and tube lines.

In August 2022, additional British government support was granted to TfL; the organisation was still unable to meet all spending commitments. In response, a new facility was established to balance TfL&#x27;s budget via the provision of up to £500 million; this facility restricted the GLA&#x27;s future financial flexibility. During late 2023, TfL issued further urgent calls for long-term funding to support its operations; it claimed that the British government would need to provide one quarter of its capital investment plans for 2024. The Department of Transport&#x27;s position has been that long term funding for TfL should be provided via the Mayor of London, and that in excess of £6 billion in extraordinary funding has already been provided.

==Fares==
Most of the transport modes that come under the control of TfL have their own charging and ticketing regimes for single fare. Buses and trams share a common fare and ticketing regime, and the DLR, Overground, Underground, and National Rail services another.

===Zonal fare system===

Rail service fares in the capital are calculated by a zonal fare system. London is divided into eleven fare zones, with every station on the London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway and, since 2007, on National Rail services, being in one, or in some cases, two zones. The zones are mostly concentric rings of increasing size emanating from the centre of London. They are (in order):
* Zone 1
* Zone 2
* Zone 3
* Zone 4
* Zone 5
* Zone 6
* Zones 7–9, C, G and W

===Travelcard===

Superimposed on these mode-specific regimes is the Travelcard system, which provides zonal tickets with validities from one day to one year, and off-peak variants. These are accepted on the DLR, buses, railways, trams, and the Underground, and provide a discount on many river services fares.

===Oyster card===

The Oyster card is a contactless smart card system introduced for the public in 2003, which can be used to pay individual fares (pay as you go) or to carry various Travelcards and other passes. It is used by scanning the card at a yellow card reader. Such readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a paper ticket could be fed through, allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through, and on stand-alone Oyster validators, which do not operate a barrier. Since 2010, Oyster Pay as you go has been available on all National Rail services within London. Oyster Pay as you go has a set of daily maximum charges based on the zones used in the day.

===Contactless payments===
In addition to Oyster card, TfL also operates a contactless payment system in London and surrounding areas, which is codenamed CPAY.

Almost all contactless Visa, Maestro, MasterCard and American Express debit and credit cards issued in the UK, and also most international cards supporting contactless payment, are accepted for travel on London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway, most National Rail, London Tramlink and Bus services. This works in the same way for the passenger as an Oyster card, including the use of capping and reduced fares compared to paper tickets. The widespread use of contactless payment - around 25 million journeys each week - has meant that TfL is now one of Europe&#x27;s largest contactless merchants, with one in 10 contactless transactions in the UK taking place on the TfL network.

Mobile payments - such as Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay - are also accepted in the same way as contactless payment cards. The fares are the same as those charged on a debit or credit card, including the same daily capping. During 2020, one in five journeys were made using mobile devices instead of using contactless bank cards, and TfL had become the most popular Apple Pay merchant in the UK.

TfL&#x27;s expertise in contactless payments has led other cities such as New York, Sydney, Brisbane and Boston to license the technology from TfL and Cubic.

==Identity and marketing==

Each of the main transport units has its own corporate identity, formed by differently coloured versions of the standard roundel logo and adding appropriate lettering across the horizontal bar. The roundel rendered in blue without any lettering represents TfL as a whole (see Transport for London logo), as well as used in situations where lettering on the roundel is not possible (such as bus receipts, where a logo is a blank roundel with the name &quot;London Buses&quot; to the right). The same range of colours is also used extensively in publicity and on the TfL website.

Transport for London has always mounted advertising campaigns to encourage use of the Underground. For example, in 1999, they commissioned artist Stephen Whatley to paint an interior – &#x27;The Grand Staircase&#x27; – which he did on location inside Buckingham Palace. This painting was reproduced on posters and displayed all over the London Underground.

During 2010, TfL commissioned artist Mark Wallinger to assist them in celebrating the 150th anniversary of the Underground, by creating the Labyrinth Project, with one enamel plaque mounted permanently in each of the Tube&#x27;s 270 stations.

In 2015, in partnership with the London Transport Museum and sponsored by Exterion Media, TfL launched Transported by Design, an 18-month programme of activities. The intention was to showcase the importance of both physical and service design across London&#x27;s transport network. In October 2015, after two months of public voting, the black cab topped the list of favourite London transport icons, which also included the original Routemaster bus and the Tube map, among others. In 2016, the programme held exhibitions, walks and a festival at Regent Street on 3 July.

===Typeface===
&quot;Johnston&quot; (or &quot;Johnston Sans&quot;) is typeface designed by and named after Edward Johnston. The typeface was commissioned in 1913 by Frank Pick, then commercial manager of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (also known as &#x27;The Underground Group&#x27;), as part of his plan to strengthen the company&#x27;s corporate identity. &quot;Johnston&quot; was originally created for printing (with a planned height of 1 inch or 2.5 cm), but it rapidly became used for the enamel station signs of the Underground system as well.

Johnston was originally printed using wood type for large signs and metal type for print. Johnston was redesigned in 1979 to produce New Johnston. The new family comes in eight members: Light, Medium, Bold weights with corresponding Italics, Medium Condensed and Bold Condensed. After the typeface was digitized in 1981–82, New Johnston finally became ready for Linotron photo-typesetting machine, and first appeared in London&#x27;s Underground stations in 1983. It has been the official typeface exclusively used by Transport for London and The Mayor of London ever since, with minor updates to specific letterforms occurring in 1990–1992 and 2008. A new version, known as Johnston 100, was commissioned by Transport for London from Monotype in 2016 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the introduction of the typeface, and was designed to be closer to the original version of the Johnston typeface.

=== Advertising bans ===
In May 2019, TfL banned advertising from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates due to their poor human rights records. This brought the number of countries to 11 from which TfL has banned adverts, due to them having the death penalty for homosexuals. Countries previously banned from advertising were Iran, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

In 2019, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, introduced restrictions on advertising of unhealthy food and drinks across the TfL network. A study estimated that this led to a 7% reduction in the average weekly household purchase of foods high in fat, salt, and sugar. The largest reductions were seen in the sales of chocolate and sweets. There was no change in purchases of foods not classified as being high in fat, salt, and sugar.

<text>In engineering, a transfer function (also known as system function or network function) of a system, sub-system, or component is a mathematical function that models the system&#x27;s output for each possible input. It is widely used in electronic engineering tools like circuit simulators and control systems. In simple cases, this function can be represented as a two-dimensional graph of an independent scalar input versus the dependent scalar output (known as a transfer curve or characteristic curve). Transfer functions for components are used to design and analyze systems assembled from components, particularly using the block diagram technique, in electronics and control theory.

Dimensions and units of the transfer function model the output response of the device for a range of possible inputs. The transfer function of a two-port electronic circuit, such as an amplifier, might be a two-dimensional graph of the scalar voltage at the output as a function of the scalar voltage applied to the input; the transfer function of an electromechanical actuator might be the mechanical displacement of the movable arm as a function of electric current applied to the device; the transfer function of a photodetector might be the output voltage as a function of the luminous intensity of incident light of a given wavelength.

The term &quot;transfer function&quot; is also used in the frequency domain analysis of systems using transform methods, such as the Laplace transform; it is the amplitude of the output as a function of the frequency of the input signal. The transfer function of an electronic filter is the amplitude at the output as a function of the frequency of a constant amplitude sine wave applied to the input. For optical imaging devices, the optical transfer function is the Fourier transform of the point spread function (a function of spatial frequency).

== Linear time-invariant systems ==
Transfer functions are commonly used in the analysis of systems such as single-input single-output filters in signal processing, communication theory, and control theory. The term is often used exclusively to refer to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Most real systems have non-linear input-output characteristics, but many systems operated within nominal parameters (not over-driven) have behavior close enough to linear that LTI system theory is an acceptable representation of their input-output behavior.

=== Continuous-time ===
Descriptions are given in terms of a complex variable, formula_1. In many applications it is sufficient to set formula_2 (thus formula_3), which reduces the Laplace transforms with complex arguments to Fourier transforms with the real argument ω. This is common in applications primarily interested in the LTI system&#x27;s steady-state response (often the case in signal processing and communication theory), not the fleeting turn-on and turn-off transient response or stability issues.

For continuous-time input signal formula_4 and output formula_5, dividing the Laplace transform of the output, formula_6, by the Laplace transform of the input, formula_7, yields the system&#x27;s transfer function formula_8:
:formula_9
which can be rearranged as:
:formula_10

=== Discrete-time ===

Discrete-time signals may be notated as arrays indexed by an integer formula_11 (e.g. formula_12 for input and formula_13 for output). Instead of using the Laplace transform (which is better for continuous-time signals), discrete-time signals are dealt with using the z-transform (notated with a corresponding capital letter, like formula_14 and formula_15), so a discrete-time system&#x27;s transfer function can be written as:

formula_16

=== Direct derivation from differential equations ===
A linear differential equation with constant coefficients

:formula_17

where &quot;u&quot; and &quot;r&quot; are suitably smooth functions of &quot;t&quot;, and &quot;L&quot; is the operator defined on the relevant function space transforms &quot;u&quot; into &quot;r&quot;. That kind of equation can be used to constrain the output function &quot;u&quot; in terms of the &quot;forcing&quot; function &quot;r&quot;. The transfer function can be used to define an operator formula_18 that serves as a right inverse of &quot;L&quot;, meaning that formula_19.

Solutions of the homogeneous constant-coefficient differential equation formula_20 can be found by trying formula_21. That substitution yields the characteristic polynomial

:formula_22

The inhomogeneous case can be easily solved if the input function &quot;r&quot; is also of the form formula_23. By substituting formula_24, formula_25 if we define

:formula_26

Other definitions of the transfer function are used, for example formula_27

=== Gain, transient behavior and stability ===

A general sinusoidal input to a system of frequency formula_28 may be written formula_29. The response of a system to a sinusoidal input beginning at time formula_30 will consist of the sum of the steady-state response and a transient response. The steady-state response is the output of the system in the limit of infinite time, and the transient response is the difference between the response and the steady-state response; it corresponds to the homogeneous solution of the differential equation. The transfer function for an LTI system may be written as the product:

:formula_31

where &quot;sPi&quot; are the &quot;N&quot; roots of the characteristic polynomial and will be the poles of the transfer function. In a transfer function with a single pole formula_32 where formula_33, the Laplace transform of a general sinusoid of unit amplitude will be formula_34. The Laplace transform of the output will be formula_35, and the temporal output will be the inverse Laplace transform of that function:

:formula_36

The second term in the numerator is the transient response, and in the limit of infinite time it will diverge to infinity if &quot;σP&quot; is positive. For a system to be stable, its transfer function must have no poles whose real parts are positive. If the transfer function is strictly stable, the real parts of all poles will be negative and the transient behavior will tend to zero in the limit of infinite time. The steady-state output will be:

:formula_37

The frequency response (or &quot;gain&quot;) &quot;G&quot; of the system is defined as the absolute value of the ratio of the output amplitude to the steady-state input amplitude:

:formula_38

which is the absolute value of the transfer function formula_39 evaluated at formula_40. This result is valid for any number of transfer-function poles.

==Signal processing==
If formula_41 is the input to a general linear time-invariant system, and formula_42 is the output, and the bilateral Laplace transform of formula_41 and formula_42 is

: formula_45

The output is related to the input by the transfer function formula_39 as

: formula_47

and the transfer function itself is 

: formula_48

If a complex harmonic signal with a sinusoidal component with amplitude formula_49, angular frequency formula_50 and phase formula_51, where arg is the argument

:formula_52

:where formula_53

is input to a linear time-invariant system, the corresponding component in the output is:

:formula_54

In a linear time-invariant system, the input frequency formula_55 has not changed; only the amplitude and phase angle of the sinusoid have been changed by the system. The frequency response formula_56 describes this change for every frequency formula_55 in terms of gain

:formula_58

and phase shift

:formula_59

The phase delay (the frequency-dependent amount of delay introduced to the sinusoid by the transfer function) is

:formula_60

The group delay (the frequency-dependent amount of delay introduced to the envelope of the sinusoid by the transfer function) is found by computing the derivative of the phase shift with respect to angular frequency formula_55,

:formula_62

The transfer function can also be shown using the Fourier transform, a special case of bilateral Laplace transform where formula_63.

=== Common transfer-function families ===

Although any LTI system can be described by some transfer function, &quot;families&quot; of special transfer functions are commonly used:
* Butterworth filter – maximally flat in passband and stopband for the given order
* Chebyshev filter (Type I) – maximally flat in stopband, sharper cutoff than a Butterworth filter of the same order
* Chebyshev filter (Type II) – maximally flat in passband, sharper cutoff than a Butterworth filter of the same order
* Bessel filter – maximally constant group delay for a given order
* Elliptic filter – sharpest cutoff (narrowest transition between passband and stopband) for the given order
* Optimum &quot;L&quot; filter
* Gaussian filter – minimum group delay; gives no overshoot to a step function
* Raised-cosine filter

==Control engineering==

In control engineering and control theory, the transfer function is derived with the Laplace transform. The transfer function was the primary tool used in classical control engineering. A transfer matrix can be obtained for any linear system to analyze its dynamics and other properties; each element of a transfer matrix is a transfer function relating a particular input variable to an output variable. A representation bridging state space and transfer function methods was proposed by Howard H. Rosenbrock, and is known as the Rosenbrock system matrix.

== Imaging ==

In imaging, transfer functions are used to describe the relationship between the scene light, the image signal and the displayed light.

== Non-linear systems ==
Transfer functions do not exist for many non-linear systems, such as relaxation oscillators; however, describing functions can sometimes be used to approximate such nonlinear time-invariant systems.

<text>Twiglets are a wheat-based snack marketed in the United Kingdom that have a &quot;distinctive knobbly shape&quot; similar to that of twigs and a speckled-brown-over-pale-colour appearance. The taste of Twiglets, which has been compared to that of Marmite, primarily derives from the yeast extract used in the coating. Twiglets are packaged in 24 g, 45 g, 105 g, 150 g bags, and in 200 g cylindrical containers.
==History==
Twiglets were invented in 1929 by a French biscuit maker J. Rondalin, a technical manager at Peek Freans&#x27; Bermondsey factory, who added brewer&#x27;s yeast to a leftover batch of Vitawheat dough. They were first launched onto the consumer market in 1932 by Peek Freans. Today, Twiglets are manufactured in Aintree by United Biscuits subsidiary Jacob&#x27;s.

During the Christmas season, Twiglets were traditionally sold in drum-shaped tin boxes as a high-class cocktail accompaniment from the 1930s until the 1970s. In modern times, the tin boxes have been substituted with large cardboard tubes decorated with seasonal themes.

In the early 1990s, a range of tangy Worcester Sauce Twiglets where introduced. Jacobs also released a curry flavoured edition from 1999 to 2001, in collaboration with several Indian restaurant chains in Northern England. From 2010 until 2012, Tangy Twiglets were briefly re-released as a limited edition to commemorate Twiglets&#x27; 80th anniversary.

Twiglets used to be manufactured partly from grain prepared using hammer milling machinery located at the Parker Brothers Lark Roller Mills in Mildenhall. The machinery was powered by water turbines fed by water from the river Lark and this process created the broken grains that give Twiglets their crunchy irregular shape and texture. This water-powered mill operated until the last decade of the 20th century in this capacity.

To celebrate the 85th anniversary of Twiglets in August 2014, United Biscuits hosted an event known as Camp Twiglet on the Cotswolds farm of Blur&#x27;s Alex James. This included three wigwams made from Twiglets which were attributed to a local artist named Mrs Cakehead.

<doc id="31150" wikidata="Q505798" url="?curid=31150" title="Lagrange's theorem (group theory)">
<text>In the mathematical field of group theory, Lagrange&#x27;s theorem states that if H is a subgroup of any finite group , then formula_1 is a divisor of formula_2, i.e. the order (number of elements) of every subgroup H divides the order of group G. 

The theorem is named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange. The following variant states that for a subgroup formula_3 of a finite group formula_4, not only is formula_5 an integer, but its value is the index formula_6, defined as the number of left cosets of formula_3 in formula_4.

This variant holds even if formula_4 is infinite, provided that formula_2, formula_1, and formula_6 are interpreted as cardinal numbers.

== Proof ==
The left cosets of in are the equivalence classes of a certain equivalence relation on : specifically, call and in equivalent if there exists in such that . 
Therefore, the set of left cosets forms a partition of .
Each left coset has the same cardinality as because formula_13 defines a bijection formula_14 (the inverse is formula_15).
The number of left cosets is the index .
By the previous three sentences, 
:formula_16

== Extension ==
Lagrange&#x27;s theorem can be extended to the equation of indexes between three subgroups of .
If we take ( is the identity element of ), then and . Therefore, we can recover the original equation .

== Applications ==
A consequence of the theorem is that the order of any element of a finite group (i.e. the smallest positive integer number with , where is the identity element of the group) divides the order of that group, since the order of is equal to the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by . If the group has elements, it follows

:formula_17

This can be used to prove Fermat&#x27;s little theorem and its generalization, Euler&#x27;s theorem. These special cases were known long before the general theorem was proved.

The theorem also shows that any group of prime order is cyclic and simple, since the subgroup generated by any non-identity element must be the whole group itself.

Lagrange&#x27;s theorem can also be used to show that there are infinitely many primes: suppose there were a largest prime formula_18. Any prime divisor formula_19 of the Mersenne number formula_20 satisfies formula_21 (see modular arithmetic), meaning that the order of formula_22 in the multiplicative group formula_23 is formula_18. By Lagrange&#x27;s theorem, the order of formula_22 must divide the order of formula_23, which is formula_27. So formula_18 divides formula_27, giving formula_30, contradicting the assumption that formula_18 is the largest prime.

== Existence of subgroups of given order ==
Lagrange&#x27;s theorem raises the converse question as to whether every divisor of the order of a group is the order of some subgroup. This does not hold in general: given a finite group &quot;G&quot; and a divisor &quot;d&quot; of |&quot;G&quot;|, there does not necessarily exist a subgroup of &quot;G&quot; with order &quot;d&quot;. The smallest example is &quot;A&quot;4 (the alternating group of degree 4), which has 12 elements but no subgroup of order 6.

A &quot;Converse of Lagrange&#x27;s Theorem&quot; (CLT) group is a finite group with the property that for every divisor of the order of the group, there is a subgroup of that order. It is known that a CLT group must be solvable and that every supersolvable group is a CLT group. However, there exist solvable groups that are not CLT (for example, &quot;A&quot;4) and CLT groups that are not supersolvable (for example, &quot;S&quot;4, the symmetric group of degree 4).

There are partial converses to Lagrange&#x27;s theorem. For general groups, Cauchy&#x27;s theorem guarantees the existence of an element, and hence of a cyclic subgroup, of order any prime dividing the group order. Sylow&#x27;s theorem extends this to the existence of a subgroup of order equal to the maximal power of any prime dividing the group order. For solvable groups, Hall&#x27;s theorems assert the existence of a subgroup of order equal to any unitary divisor of the group order (that is, a divisor coprime to its cofactor).

=== Counterexample of the converse of Lagrange&#x27;s theorem ===
The converse of Lagrange&#x27;s theorem states that if is a divisor of the order of a group , then there exists a subgroup where .

We will examine the alternating group , the set of even permutations as the subgroup of the Symmetric group .

 so the divisors are . Assume to the contrary that there exists a subgroup in with .

Let be the non-cyclic subgroup of called the Klein four-group.

Let . Since both and are subgroups of , is also a subgroup of .

From Lagrange&#x27;s theorem, the order of must divide both and , the orders of and respectively. The only two positive integers that divide both and are and . So or .

Assume , then . If does not share any elements with , then the 5 elements in besides the Identity element must be of the form where are distinct elements in .

Since any element of the form squared is , and , any element of in the form must be paired with its inverse. Specifically, the remaining 5 elements of must come from distinct pairs of elements in that are not in . This is impossible since pairs of elements must be even and cannot total up to 5 elements. Thus, the assumptions that is wrong, so .

Then, where , must be in the form where are distinct elements of . The other four elements in are cycles of length 3.

Note that the cosets generated by a subgroup of a group form a partition of the group. The cosets generated by a specific subgroup are either identical to each other or disjoint. The index of a subgroup in a group is the number of cosets generated by that subgroup. Since and , will generate two left cosets, one that is equal to and another, , that is of length 6 and includes all the elements in not in .

Since there are only 2 distinct cosets generated by , then must be normal. Because of that, . In particular, this is true for . Since .

Without loss of generality, assume that , , , . Then , , , , . Transforming back, we get . Because contains all disjoint transpositions in , . Hence, .

Since , we have demonstrated that there is a third element in . But earlier we assumed that , so we have a contradiction.

Therefore, our original assumption that there is a subgroup of order 6 is not true and consequently there is no subgroup of order 6 in and the converse of Lagrange&#x27;s theorem is not necessarily true.
Q.E.D.

== History ==
Lagrange himself did not prove the theorem in its general form. He stated, in his article &quot;Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations&quot;, that if a polynomial in variables has its variables permuted in all ways, the number of different polynomials that are obtained is always a factor of . (For example, if the variables , , and are permuted in all 6 possible ways in the polynomial then we get a total of 3 different polynomials: , , and . Note that 3 is a factor of 6.) The number of such polynomials is the index in the symmetric group of the subgroup of permutations that preserve the polynomial. (For the example of , the subgroup in contains the identity and the transposition .) So the size of divides . With the later development of abstract groups, this result of Lagrange on polynomials was recognized to extend to the general theorem about finite groups which now bears his name.

In his &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; in 1801, Carl Friedrich Gauss proved Lagrange&#x27;s theorem for the special case of formula_32, the multiplicative group of nonzero integers modulo , where is a prime. In 1844, Augustin-Louis Cauchy proved Lagrange&#x27;s theorem for the symmetric group .

Camille Jordan finally proved Lagrange&#x27;s theorem for the case of any permutation group in 1861.

<text>The Princess Bride is a 1987 American fantasy adventure comedy film directed and co-produced by Rob Reiner and starring Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Chris Sarandon, Christopher Guest, Wallace Shawn, André the Giant and Robin Wright. Adapted by William Goldman from his novel of the same name, it tells the story of a swashbuckling farmhand named Westley, accompanied by companions befriended along the way, who must rescue his true love Princess Buttercup from the odious Prince Humperdinck. The film preserves the novel&#x27;s metafictional narrative style by presenting the story as a book being read by a grandfather to his sick grandson.

The film was first released in the United States on September 25, 1987, and was well received by critics at the time. After only having modest initial box office success, it has over time become a cult film and gained recognition as one of the best films of the 1980s as well as one of Reiner&#x27;s best works. The film is number 50 on the Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;, number 88 on The American Film Institute&#x27;s (AFI) &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions&quot; list of the 100 greatest film love stories, and 46 in Channel 4&#x27;s 50 Greatest Comedy Films list. The film also won the 1988 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

In 2016, the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

A grandfather reads a novel to his sick grandson, who initially dismisses the story.

The book is about Buttercup, a young woman living on a farm in the fictional kingdom of Florin. Whenever she tells farmhand Westley to do something, he always complies, saying, &quot;As you wish.&quot; The two fall in love, and Westley leaves to seek his fortune overseas so they can marry. However, Westley is presumed dead after his ship is attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts.

Five years later, Buttercup is forcibly betrothed to Florin&#x27;s Prince Humperdinck. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by crafty Sicilian criminal Vizzini and his henchmen: Fezzik, a giant, and Inigo Montoya, a Spanish fencing master obsessed with revenge against the six-fingered man who murdered his father. A masked man in black pursues them, as do Humperdinck and his soldiers.

Atop the Cliffs of Insanity, the man in black defeats Inigo in a sword duel and knocks him out, chokes Fezzik into unconsciousness, and kills Vizzini by tricking him into drinking a deadly poison. He takes Buttercup and flees ahead of Humperdinck&#x27;s party. She correctly guesses he is the Dread Pirate Roberts, rebukes him for killing Westley, and shoves him down a steep hill. While tumbling down, he shouts, &quot;As you wish!&quot; Realizing the man is Westley, Buttercup tumbles after him, and they are reunited.

While making their way through the Fire Swamp to avoid Humperdinck and his soldiers, Westley explains that &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; is a transferable title that he assumed when the previous Roberts retired. Having found Buttercup, Westley intends to retire himself and pass on the title to someone else.

Humperdinck captures the pair after they emerge from the Fire Swamp. Buttercup agrees to return with Humperdinck after he promises to release Westley. However, he secretly orders Count Rugen to take Westley to his torture chamber, the Pit of Despair. After Westley notices that Rugen has six fingers on his right hand, Rugen knocks him out.

When Buttercup threatens to commit suicide if the wedding happens, Humperdinck falsely promises to find Westley for her. His real plan is to start a war with the neighboring country of Guilder by killing Buttercup and framing them for it. Humperdinck had secretly hired Vizzini to kill her, but Westley interfered.

Meanwhile, Fezzik becomes part of the brute squad ordered to clear the thieves&#x27; forest before the wedding. He finds a drunk Inigo in the forest, whom he sobers up and tells about Rugen. Inigo says that he and Fezzik need Westley&#x27;s help to storm the castle.

Buttercup realizes that Humperdinck did not search for Westley and calls him a coward. Enraged, he imprisons her and tortures Westley to near death. Inigo and Fezzik follow Westley&#x27;s screams to the pit and take his body to Miracle Max, a folk healer whom Humperdinck recently fired. The &quot;mostly dead&quot; Westley is revived by him, though he is severely weakened.

As Westley, Inigo, and Fezzik storm the castle during the wedding, Humperdinck panics and orders the priest to conclude at once. Inigo confronts Rugen, who flees and then stabs him in an ambush, taunting his obsession. Inigo braves his injuries and kills Rugen.

Westley locates Buttercup as she is about to commit suicide and assures her that the marriage is invalid without her consent. Humperdinck finds them and challenges Westley to a duel, but Westley intimidates him into surrendering.

Inigo finds Westley and Buttercup, and Fezzik procures four horses for their escape. When Inigo is unsure what to do next with his life, Westley offers him the Dread Pirate Roberts title. As dawn breaks, the reunited Westley and Buttercup share a passionate kiss.

The sick grandson eagerly asks his grandfather to read him the story again the next day. His grandfather replies, &quot;As you wish.&quot;

==Cast==
Betsy Brantley appears as the mother of Savage&#x27;s character and Margery Mason portrays the Ancient Booer who heckles Buttercup in her dream. Willoughby Gray and Anne Dyson portray the King and Queen of Florin. Malcolm Storry plays chief enforcer Yellin and Paul Badger appears as an assistant brute.

==Production==
===Development===
Rob Reiner, who had been enamored of Goldman&#x27;s book ever since he was given it as a gift from his father, realized he wanted to make the film adaptation after successfully demonstrating his filmmaking skill with the release of &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; in 1984. During production of &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, released in 1986, Reiner had spoken to an executive at Paramount Pictures regarding what his next film would be, and suggested the adaptation of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;. He was told they could not, leading Reiner to discover that several studios had previously attempted to bring Goldman&#x27;s book to the big screen without success.

Those previous attempts included 20th Century Fox, which paid Goldman $500,000 for the film rights and to do a screenplay in 1973. Richard Lester was signed to direct and the movie was almost made, but the head of production at Fox was fired and the project was put on hiatus. Goldman subsequently bought back the film rights to the novel with his own money.

Other directors had also attempted to adapt the book, including François Truffaut, Robert Redford and Norman Jewison, and at one point, Christopher Reeve was interested in playing Westley in one planned adaption. Reiner found success by gaining financial support from Norman Lear, whom Reiner knew from &quot;All in the Family&quot; and who had funded production of &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot;, with the production to be distributed by 20th Century Fox. Reiner worked closely with Goldman to adapt the book for the screenplay.

===Casting===
Reiner had quickly decided on Cary Elwes for Westley, based on his performance in &quot;Lady Jane&quot;; however, during the casting period in Los Angeles, Elwes was in West Germany on set for &quot;Maschenka&quot;. Reiner flew out to West Berlin to meet with Elwes, confirming his appropriateness for the role. While Reiner and casting director Jane Jenkins auditioned other actors for Westley, they knew Elwes was perfect for the part. Elwes had read the book in his childhood and associated himself with the character of Westley, but never believed he would have the opportunity to play him.

Robin Wright was cast late in the process, about a week before filming; Reiner and Jenkins had auditioned a number of English actresses but had not found their ideal Buttercup. Uma Thurman, Meg Ryan, Sean Young, Suzy Amis, Courteney Cox, Alexandra Paul and Whoopi Goldberg all auditioned for the role. Wright&#x27;s agent had heard of the casting call and encouraged Wright to audition. Though initially shy, Wright impressed Jenkins, and later Reiner. They invited Wright to come meet Goldman at his house. Jenkins recalls: &quot;The doorbell rang. Rob went to the door, and literally, as he opened the door, [Wright] was standing there in this little white summer dress, with her long blonde hair, and she had a halo from the sun. She was backlit by God. And Bill Goldman looked across the room at her, and he said, &#x27;Well, that&#x27;s what I wrote.&#x27; It was the most perfect thing.&quot;

Mandy Patinkin and Wallace Shawn were early choices for the cast; Shawn in particular was chosen as Vizzini due to his diminutive size to contrast that of the giant Fezzik. Danny DeVito was considered for the role of Vizzini.

When Goldman originally shopped his novel in the early 1970s, his first choice for Fezzik was André the Giant, whose wrestling schedule left him unavailable for filming. Goldman&#x27;s second choice was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who at that time was almost unknown as an actor. However, by the time &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; was finally green-lit, Schwarzenegger was a major film star and the studio could not afford him. Jenkins contacted the World Wrestling Federation to ask about hiring André, but were told that the filming conflicted with a wrestling match in Tokyo that would pay him $5 million. Jenkins auditioned other tall men, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Lou Ferrigno and Carel Struycken, but these did not pan out. André was hesitant to take the part on the account of the fact that the film&#x27;s dialogue was in English while he was French and because he was a professional wrestler, not an actor. Furthermore, André was suffering much pain resulting from his acromegaly, which was to eventually lead to his early death. Liam Neeson also auditioned for the role, but he was turned down due to height. Near the end of casting, the World Wrestling Federation told Jenkins that André&#x27;s match in Tokyo had been cancelled, clearing him to play the role of Fezzik. For his part, André found his participation was a gratifying experience considering that no one stared at him on set during production as a kind of freak, but instead simply treated him as a fellow member of the cast.

===Filming===

The film was shot in various locations in England and Ireland in late 1986:
* Carl Wark, Sheffield, England
* Burnham Beeches, Buckinghamshire, England
* Lathkill Dale where it meets Cales Dale (the &quot;Battle of wits&quot; scene)
* Cave Dale, Castleton, Derbyshire, England
* Bradley Rocks and Robin Hood&#x27;s Stride, Birchover, Derbyshire, England
* Cliffs of Moher, County Clare, Ireland (for the Cliffs of Insanity)
* Haddon Hall, Bakewell, Derbyshire, England
* Penshurst Place, Kent, England

The framing story scenes, the last to be filmed, were shot at Shepperton Studios in Surrey.

Reiner rented a house in England near these sites and frequently invited the cast over for meals and light-hearted get-togethers. Many cast members believed this helped to create a sense of &quot;family&quot; that helped to improve their performances for the film.

Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin learned to fence (both left- and right-handed) for the film, and they performed the combat scenes themselves, with the exception of two somersaults performed by stunt doubles. They were trained by fencing instructors Bob Anderson and stunt arranger Peter Diamond, both of whom had also worked on training the actors in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. Elwes and Patinkin spent about three weeks prior to filming learning to fence, and they spent most of their off-camera free time practicing. Anderson encouraged the two to learn the other&#x27;s choreography for the fight to help them anticipate the movements and avoid an accident. They also watched many sword fights from previous films to see how they could improve on those.

André the Giant had undergone major back surgery prior to filming and, despite his great size and strength, could not support the weight of Elwes during their fight scene or Wright for a scene at the end of the film. For the wrestling scene, when Elwes hangs on André&#x27;s back, he was actually walking on a series of ramps below the camera during close-ups. For the wide shots, a stunt double took the place of André. When he was apparently carrying Wright, she was actually suspended by cables.

Billy Crystal and Carol Kane spent time before traveling to England to work out the backstory between Miracle Max and his wife and develop a rapport for their characters. Once on set, Reiner allowed them to improvise some of their lines.

===Soundtrack===

The original soundtrack album was composed by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits. It was released by Warner Bros. Records in the United States and Vertigo Records internationally in November 1987. The album contains the song &quot;Storybook Love&quot;, performed by Willy DeVille and produced by Mark Knopfler. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 60th Academy Awards.

In his audio commentary of the film on the special edition DVD, director Rob Reiner said that only Knopfler could create a soundtrack to capture the film&#x27;s quirky yet romantic nature. Reiner was an admirer of Knopfler&#x27;s work but did not know him before working on the film. He sent the script to him hoping he would agree to score the film. Knopfler agreed on one condition: that somewhere in the film Reiner would include the baseball cap (which had been modified to say &quot;USS Ooral Sea OV-4B&quot;) he wore as Marty DiBergi in &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;. Reiner was unable to produce the original cap, but did include a similar cap in the grandson&#x27;s room. Knopfler later said he was joking.

==Reception==
The film premiered at the Ryerson Theatre in Toronto as part of the 1987 Toronto International Film Festival. It went into wide release later that fall in North America.

===Box office===
Unsure how to describe the film&#x27;s postmodern narrative, Fox promoted it to theaters as a zany comedy and released it without an audience trailer. The film was initially a modest success, grossing $30.8 million at the United States and Canada box office, on a $16 million production budget. Fox executive Barry Diller reassured a frustrated Reiner that the film could find a broader audience in time.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; holds a 96% approval rating based on 84 reviews and an average rating of 8.50/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;A delightfully postmodern fairy tale, &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; is a deft, intelligent mix of swashbuckling, romance, and comedy that takes an age-old damsel-in-distress story and makes it fresh.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 77 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A+&quot; on scale of A to F.

Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film a &quot;two thumbs up&quot; rating on their television program. Ebert also wrote a very favorable print review in his column for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; said the film was fun for the whole family, and later, &quot;Time&quot; listed the film as one of the &quot;Best of &#x27;87&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the cast and the sweetness of the film.

The American critic Dalton Mullins praised the film as one of the best love stories ever filmed, writing: &quot;The chemistry between the two leads is palpable and is clear from the first moment they&#x27;re on screen together. When Buttercup asks Wesley to do something, the tension of the unspoken love between the two is profound and dense, especially when they were standing face to face right before they professed their undying love for each other.&quot; Mullins argued that the phrase &quot;as you wish&quot; sums up the film&#x27;s philosophy as Westley was willing to suffer any hardship and brave any peril for the woman he loves, which led him to argue the film was a story about &quot;true love&quot;. He wrote that the scenes in the swamp were especially effective because the characters have been apart for so long and: &quot;the way Wesley (sic) cradles Buttercup and the affectionate hug has always been a moment that stood out to me because it accentuates the love between the two characters and reinforces the themes of longing and true love&quot;. Mullins called the film the &quot;...greatest romantic, fantasy, adventure story. It flawlessly represents love in that it can be a long arduous process but when fought for, it can be the most beautiful, passionate thing and fill you with the most joyful feelings&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;The Princess Bride&quot; was not a major box-office success, but it became a cult classic after its release to the home video market. The film is widely regarded as eminently quotable. Elwes noted in 2017, on the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, that fans still frequently come up to him and quote lines from the movie. According to him, Wallace Shawn had it worse because any time he made a small error, like dropping his keys, people would shout &quot;Inconceivable!&quot; at him.

In 2000, readers of &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine voted &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; the 38th greatest comedy film of all time. In 2005 &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; was voted 40th in Channel 4&#x27;s 100 Greatest Family Films poll ahead of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and just behind &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; and &quot;Bedknobs &amp; Broomsticks&quot;. In 2006, William Goldman&#x27;s screenplay was selected by the Writers Guild of America as the 84th best screenplay of all time; it earned the same ranking in the Guild&#x27;s 2013 update. The film was selected number 88 on The American Film Institute&#x27;s (AFI) &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Passions&quot; listing the 100 greatest film love stories of all time. BBC Radio 5&#x27;s resident film critic, Mark Kermode, is a fan of the film, frequently considering it a model to which similar films aspire.

In December 2011, director Jason Reitman staged a live dramatic reading of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; script at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), with Paul Rudd as Westley; Mindy Kaling as Buttercup; Patton Oswalt as Vizzini; Kevin Pollak as Miracle Max; Goran Visnjic as Inigo Montoya; Cary Elwes (switching roles) as Humperdinck; director Rob Reiner as the grandfather; and Fred Savage reprising his role as the grandson.

In 2013, director Ari Folman released a live-action animated film titled &quot;The Congress&quot;, which directly referenced &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;. Folman&#x27;s film starred Robin Wright, playing both a live and animated version of herself, as a digitally cloned actress.

In 2014, Cary Elwes wrote &quot;As You Wish: Inconceivable Tales from the Making of The Princess Bride&quot;, a behind-the-scenes account of the film&#x27;s production, co-written with Joe Layden. To help Elwes recall the production, Lear sent him a bound copy of the filming&#x27;s call sheets. The book debuted at No. 3 on the New York Times Bestseller list. In addition to a foreword by director Rob Reiner and a limited edition poster, the book includes exclusive photos and interviews with the cast members from the 25th anniversary cast reunion, as well as unique stories and set secrets from the making of the film.

In 2018, Savage reprised his role as The Grandson in a PG-13 version of &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; entitled &quot;Once Upon a Deadpool&quot;, with Deadpool taking the role of The Narrator and reading &quot;Deadpool 2&quot;&#x27;s story to him at bedtime and skipping over the more adult parts from the R-rated version.

In 2020, a bar themed after the film, named &quot;As You Wish&quot;, opened in Chicago. The menu features 16 themed cocktails.

===Accolades===
At the 60th Academy Awards it was nominated for Best Original Song for &quot;Storybook Love.&quot; At the 15th Saturn Awards it won Best Fantasy Film and Best Costume Design, it was nominated for Best Writing, and Robin Wright was nominated for Best Actress. It won the 1988 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and at the 1987 Toronto International Film Festival it won the People&#x27;s Choice Award.

==Post-theatrical release==

In North America, the film was released on VHS and LaserDisc in 1988 by Nelson Entertainment, the latter being a &quot;bare bones&quot; release in unmatted full screen. New Line Home Video reissued the VHS in 1994. The film was also released on Video CD by Philips.

The Criterion Collection released a matted widescreen version, bare bones version on laserdisc in 1989, supplementing it with liner notes. In 1997 Criterion re-released the Laserdisc as a &quot;special edition&quot;. This edition was widescreen and included an audio commentary by Rob Reiner, William Goldman, Andrew Scheinman, Billy Crystal and Peter Falk (this commentary would also later appear on the Criterion Blu-ray and DVD release); excerpts from the novel read by Rob Reiner; behind the scenes footage; a production scrapbook by unit photographer Clive Coote; design sketches by production designer Norman Garwood; and excerpts from the television series &quot;Morton and Hayes&quot;, directed by Christopher Guest.

By 1998, MGM had acquired the US home video rights to the film (as part of the pre-1996 PolyGram Filmed Entertainment film library package) and released the film on VHS and DVD. The DVD release featured the soundtrack remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 with the film in wide and full screen versions, and included the original US theatrical trailer. The next year MGM Home Entertainment re-released the film in another widescreen &quot;special edition&quot;, this time with two audio commentaries—one by Rob Reiner, the other by William Goldman—&quot;As You Wish&quot;, &quot;Promotional&quot;, and &quot;Making Of&quot; featurettes; a &quot;Cary Elwes Video Diary&quot;; the US and UK theatrical trailers; four television spots; a photo gallery; and a collectible booklet.

In 2006, MGM and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released a two-disc set with varying covers—the &quot;Dread Pirate&quot; and &quot;Buttercup&quot; editions. Each featured their respective character, but had identical features: in addition to the features in the previous release were, the &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts: Greatest Legend of the Seven Seas&quot;, &quot;Love is Like a Storybook Story&quot;, and &quot;Miraculous Make Up&quot; featurettes, &quot;The Quotable Battle of Wits&quot; game, and Fezzik&#x27;s &quot;Guide to Florin&quot; booklet.

A year later, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the film, MGM and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film with flippable cover art featuring the title displayed in an ambigram. This DVD did not include any bonus features from the older editions, but had new short featurettes and a new game. A Blu-ray Disc was released on March 17, 2009, encoded in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. Special features included two audio commentaries, the original theatrical trailer and eight featurettes.

In 2007, the film was released for download in the iTunes Store.

The film is available in Europe (DVD Region 2), published by Lions Gate Entertainment. Its extras are the theatrical trailer and text filmographies.

The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 30, 2018. It included a new 4K digital transfer, the same audio commentary from the Criterion LaserDisc release, an edited 1987 audiobook reading of Goldman&#x27;s novel by director Rob Reiner, new programs on William Goldman&#x27;s screenplay and tapestry, a new interview with art director Richard Holland, an essay by author Sloane Crosley, and a Blu-ray exclusive book highlighting four screenplays, as well as Goldman&#x27;s introduction to the 1995 screenplay. Criterion would re-release the film on a 4K/Blu-Ray combo pack on September 3, 2023.

&quot;The Princess Bride&quot; has been made available on May 1, 2020, on The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s streaming service Disney+.

==Adaptations==
It was announced that composer Adam Guettel was working with William Goldman on a musical adaptation of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; in 2006. The project was abandoned in February 2007 after Goldman reportedly demanded 75 percent of the author&#x27;s share, even though Guettel was writing both the music and the lyrics.

In late 2013, Disney Theatrical Productions announced that they would adapt a stage musical adaptation of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;. A website was launched a couple of months later. In 2016, Rob Reiner said the project was still in development despite &quot;roadblocks&quot; and that Marc Shaiman, Randy Newman and John Mayer had all been approached to write songs, but had turned them down. In June 2019, it was confirmed Rick Elice and Bob Martin were writing the script and David Yazbek was composing the music and lyrics.

In 2018, &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; was adapted by players of a virtual reality social game, &quot;Rec Room&quot;, into what is likely to be the world&#x27;s first full-length virtual reality stage production. The duration of the production was approximately 80 minutes, and ran for a total of four shows.

There have been many board games based on the film, beginning with a promotional roll and move game distributed with an early VHS video release in 1988. In 2008, PlayRoom Entertainment released &quot;The Princess Bride: Storming the Castle&quot;, a board game based on the film. Since 2013, Game Salute (now Tabletop Tycoon, under the SparkWorks imprint) has published multiple games based on specific scenes from the film, including party game &quot;The Princess Bride: Prepare to Die!&quot;, card game &quot;The Princess Bride: A Battle of Wits&quot; and dice game &quot;The Princess Bride: I Hate to Kill You...&quot; In 2020, Ravensburger published &quot;The Princess Bride Adventure Book Game&quot;, a collaborative card and miniatures game with several boards presented as &quot;chapters&quot; of a book.

&quot;The Princess Bride Game&quot; is a casual video game developed and published by New York game development studio Worldwide Biggies.

In June 2020, a &quot;fan made&quot; recreation of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; was released on Quibi called &quot;Home Movie: The Princess Bride&quot;. It was produced by Jason Reitman during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine in March 2020 with help from an ensemble cast who filmed themselves recreating the various scenes at their homes to raise money for the World Central Kitchen charity. Reitman received backing from Jeffrey Katzenberg for the project, as well as the rights to stream the film on his Quibi service. The &quot;fan-made&quot; film also had approval from Norman Lear and the estate of William Goldman, and Mark Knopfler permitted the use of his music. Rob Reiner approved of the project, even briefly stepping in to play the grandfather. It also features the final performance of Carl Reiner, playing the grandfather in the last scene to his own son. The film was dedicated to his memory as he died days later.

On September 13, 2020, most of the original cast members took part in a virtual live read-through of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; script, &quot;Princess Bride Reunion&quot;, to support the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. The returning cast included Elwes, Wright, Sarandon, Patinkin, Guest, Shawn, Crystal, and Kane, with additional performances by Rob Reiner as the Grandfather, Josh Gad as Fezzik, Eric Idle as the Impressive Clergyman, Whoopi Goldberg as the Ancient Booer and the Mother, King Bach as Yellin, the Assistant Brute and the King, Finn Wolfhard as the Grandson, Shaun Ross as The Man With Albinism, and Jason Reitman as the narrator. Norman Lear joined the Q&amp;A session at the end, which was hosted by Patton Oswalt. Cast members promoted the event beforehand using the hashtags &quot;#PrincessBrideReunion and &quot;#DumpTrumperdinck&quot;. More than 110,000 viewers donated a dollar or more to Wisconsin Democrats to view the livestream event.

Zen Studios released &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; table for &quot;Pinball FX&quot; on August 29, 2024.

==Potential remake==
In a September 2019 biographical article on Norman Lear in &quot;Variety&quot;, Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra, speaking of Lear&#x27;s works and interest in remaking them, stated, &quot;Very famous people whose names I won&#x27;t use, but they want to redo &quot;The Princess Bride.&quot;&quot; The reaction to this via social media was very negative, with fans of the film asserting that a remake would be a bad idea and, in reference to the film, &quot;inconceivable&quot;. Elwes paraphrased the film, saying, &quot;There&#x27;s a shortage of perfect movies in this world.

<text>The Taxil hoax was an 1890s hoax of exposure by Léo Taxil, intended to mock not only Freemasonry but also the Catholic Church&#x27;s opposition to it.
Taxil, the author of an anti-papal tract, pretended to convert to Catholicism (circa 1884) and wrote several volumes, purportedly in the service to his new faith. These included the adventures of one Dr. Bataille, a surgeon serving in the French merchant navy who has infiltrated the Freemasons and observes their evil rituals as they occur all over the world. Buddhists, Hindus, and Spiritualists join with Freemasons in conspiring against the Catholic church, and Bataille uncovers an even more secret order within the Masons called the Palladists, who take their orders directly from demons. As Dr. Bataille&#x27;s tale unfolds, he introduces Diana Vaughan, a former high priestess of Palladism who has converted to Catholicism and is in grave danger of assassination from vengeful Freemasons. 

In 1897, Taxil called a press conference at which he promised to produce Vaughan. Instead he announced that his revelations about the Freemasons were made up, and thanked the Catholic clergy for helping to publicize his stories. Nine years later he told an American magazine that he at first thought readers would recognize his tales as &quot;amusement pure and simple&quot;—too outlandish to be true—but when he realized they believed them and that there was &quot;lots of money&quot; to be made in publishing them, he continued to perpetrate the hoax. Despite this debunking, belief in Vaughan and the Palladists did not entirely die and the Palladists appeared in a 1943 noir film &quot;The Seventh Victim&quot;.

==Taxil and Freemasonry==
Léo Taxil was the pen name of Marie Joseph Gabriel Antoine Jogand-Pagès, who had been accused earlier of libel regarding a book he wrote called &quot;The Secret Loves of Pope Pius IX&quot;. On April 20, 1884, Pope Leo XIII published an encyclical, &quot;Humanum genus&quot;, that said that the human race was:


After this encyclical, Taxil underwent a public, feigned conversion to Roman Catholicism and announced his intention of repairing the damage he had done to the true faith.

The first book produced by Taxil after his conversion was a four-volume history of Freemasonry, which contained fictitious eyewitness verifications of their participation in Satanism. With a collaborator who published as &quot;Dr. Karl Hacks&quot;, Taxil wrote another book called &quot;Le Diable au XIXe siècle&quot; (&quot;The Devil in the Nineteenth Century&quot;), which introduced a new character, Diana Vaughan, a supposed descendant of the Rosicrucian alchemist Thomas Vaughan. The book contained many tales about her encounters with incarnate demons, one of whom, a devil snake, was supposed to have written prophecies on her back with its tail, and another who played the piano while in the shape of a crocodile.

Diana was supposedly involved in Satanic Freemasonry but was redeemed when one day she professed admiration for Joan of Arc, at whose name the demons were put to flight. As Diana Vaughan, Taxil published a book called &quot;Eucharistic Novena&quot;, a collection of prayers which were praised by the Pope.

===Palladists===
In the Taxil hoax, Palladists were members of an alleged Theistic Satanist cult within Freemasonry. According to Taxil, Palladism was a religion practiced within the highest orders of Freemasonry. Adherents worshipped Lucifer and interacted with demons. 

In 1891 Léo Taxil (Gabriel Jogand-Pagès) and Adolphe Ricoux claimed to have discovered a Palladian Society. An 1892 French book &quot;Le Diable au XIXe siècle&quot; (The Devil in the 19th Century&quot;, 1892), written by &quot;Dr. Bataille&quot; (actually Jogand-Pagès himself) alleged that Palladists were Satanists based in Charleston, South Carolina, headed by the American Freemason Albert Pike and created by the Italian liberal patriot and author Giuseppe Mazzini.

Arthur Edward Waite, debunking the existence of the group in &quot;Devil-Worship in France, or The Question of Lucifer&quot;, ch. II: &quot;The Mask of Masonry&quot; (London, 1896), reports according to &quot;the works of Domenico Margiotta and Dr Bataille&quot; that &quot;[t]he Order of Palladium founded in Paris 20 May 1737 or Sovereign Council of Wisdom&quot; was a &quot;Masonic diabolic order&quot;. Dr. Bataille asserted that women would supposedly be initiated as &quot;Companions of Penelope&quot;. According to Dr. Bataille, the society had two orders, &quot;Adelph&quot; and &quot;Companion of Ulysses&quot;; however, the society was broken up by French law enforcement a few years after its founding. A supposed Diana Vaughan published &quot;Confessions of an Ex-Palladist&quot; in 1895.

==Confession==
On April 19, 1897, in Société de Géographie, Léo Taxil called a press conference at which, he claimed, he would introduce Diana Vaughan to the press. At the conference instead he announced that his revelations about the Freemasons were fictitious. He thanked the Catholic clergy for their assistance in giving publicity to his wild claims.

Taxil&#x27;s confession was printed, in its entirety, in the Parisian newspaper &quot;Le Frondeur&quot;, on April 25, 1897, titled: &quot;Twelve Years Under the Banner of the Church, The Prank Of Palladism. Miss Diana Vaughan–The Devil At The Freemasons. A Conference held by M. Léo Taxil, at the Hall of the Geographic Society in Paris&quot;.

The hoax material is still cited to this day. The Chick Publications tract, &quot;The Curse of Baphomet&quot;, and Randy Noblitt&#x27;s book on satanic ritual abuse, &quot;Cult and Ritual Abuse&quot;, both cite Taxil&#x27;s fictitious claims.

==Later interview with Taxil==

Ten months before his death on March 31, 1907, Taxil was quoted in the American &quot;National Magazine&quot; as giving his true reasons behind the hoax.

==The Luciferian quote==
A series of paragraphs about Lucifer are frequently associated with the Taxil hoax. They read:

While this quotation was published by Abel Clarin de la Rive in his &quot;Woman and Child in Universal Freemasonry&quot;, it does not appear in Taxil&#x27;s writings proper, though it is sourced in a footnote to Diana Vaughan, Taxil&#x27;s creation.

<text>The Taiwan independence movement is a political movement which advocates the formal declaration of an independent and sovereign Taiwanese state, as opposed to Chinese unification or the status quo in Cross-Strait relations.

Into the 21st-century, Taiwan&#x27;s political status is ambiguous. China under the control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) claims the island of Taiwan as a province of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), whereas the de facto administration of Taiwan under its current government (held by the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) since 2016) maintains that Taiwan is already an independent country as the Republic of China (ROC) and thus does not have to push for any sort of formal independence through legal means. As such, the ROC consisting of Taiwan and other islands under its control exercise full autonomy in its internal governance and already conducts official diplomatic relations with and is recognized by 12 member states of the United Nations and the Holy See.

The use of &quot;independence&quot; for Taiwan can be ambiguous. If some supporters articulate that they agree to the independence of Taiwan, they may either be referring to the notion of formally creating an independent Taiwanese state (Republic of Taiwan) or to the notion that Taiwan has become synonymous with the current Republic of China and is already independent (as reflected in the concept of One Country on Each Side). Some supporters advocate the exclusion of Kinmen and Matsu, which are controlled by Taiwan but are located off the coast of mainland China. 

The Taiwan independence movement is supported by the DPP and the broader Pan-Green Coalition given the threat posed to its liberal democratic system and human rights. The movement is opposed by the Kuomintang (KMT) and the broader Pan-Blue Coalition, which seeks to retain the somewhat ambiguous status quo of the Republic of China (Taiwan) under the so-called &quot;1992 Consensus&quot; or gradually &quot;reunify&quot; with mainland China at some point.

The government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) oppose Taiwanese independence since they believe that Taiwan and mainland China comprise two portions of a single country&#x27;s territory and regards any moves (retaining political autonomy of the ROC or the radical move of declaring formal independence) as separatism that violate the constitution of the PRC and international law given its own interpretation of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758. The government of the PRC has officially maintained the position of peaceful unification of Taiwan but does not rule out using military force, if necessary, to &quot;reunify&quot; the island should formal independence be declared.

As for the ROC (Taiwan), such a move could also be considered a violation of its current constitution. The process for a constitutional amendment in ROC or national territory alternation must be initiated by one-fourth (25%) of the members of the Legislative Yuan (the unicameral parliament of ROC), then voted in the Legislative Yuan with at least three-fourths (75%) members attended and by a three-fourths (75%) supermajority, then approved by majority popular vote in a referendum.

Historically, both governments have formulated a &quot;One China&quot; policy, whereby foreign countries may only conduct official diplomatic relations with either the PRC or the ROC, on the condition that they sever official diplomatic relations with and formal recognition of the other. The ROC&#x27;s One-China policy was softened following democratization in the 1990s.

== History of Taiwan independence ==
Many supporters of independence for Taiwan view the history of Taiwan since the 17th century as a continuous struggle for independence and use it as an inspiration for the current political movement.

According to this view, the people indigenous to Taiwan and those who have taken up residence there have been repeatedly occupied by groups including the Dutch, the Spanish, the Ming, Koxinga and the Ming loyalists, the Qing, the Japanese and finally the Chinese Nationalists led by the Kuomintang. From a pro-independence supporter&#x27;s point of view, the movement for Taiwan independence began under Qing rule in the 1680s which led to a well known saying those days, &quot;Every three years an uprising, every five years a rebellion&quot;. Taiwan Independence supporters compared Taiwan under Kuomintang rule to South Africa under apartheid. The Taiwan independence movement under Japan was supported by Mao Zedong in the 1930s as a means of freeing Taiwan from Japanese rule.

With the end of World War II in 1945, by issuing &quot;General Order No. 1&quot; to the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, the Allies agreed that the Republic of China Army under the Kuomintang would &quot;temporarily occupy Taiwan, on behalf of the Allied forces.&quot; 

From 1928 to 1942, the Chinese Communist Party maintained that Taiwan was a separate nation. Mao Zedong was an early supporter of Taiwanese independence, telling Edgar Snow in the 1930s that the Chinese Communist Party would lend &quot;our enthusiastic help in their struggle for independence.&quot; He changed this position only after the Nationalists started claiming Taiwan with the Cairo Declaration.

=== Martial law period ===
The modern-day political movement for Taiwan independence dates back to the Japanese colonial period, but it only became a viable political force within Taiwan in the 1990s. Taiwanese independence was advocated periodically during the Japanese colonial period, but was suppressed by the Japanese government. These efforts were the goal of the Taiwanese Communist Party of the late 1920s. Unlike current formulations, and in line with the thinking of the Comintern, such a state would have been a proletarian one. With the end of World War II in 1945, Japanese rule ended, but the subsequent autocratic rule of the ROC&#x27;s Kuomintang (KMT) later revived calls for local rule. However, it was a movement supported by the Chinese students who were born on the Island and not associated with KMT. It found its roots in the US and Japan. In the 1950s a Republic of Taiwan Provisional Government was set up in Japan. Thomas Liao was nominally the President. At one time it held quasi-official relations with the newly independent Indonesia. This was possible mainly through the connections between Sukarno and the Provisional Government&#x27;s Southeast Asian liaison, Chen Chih-hsiung, who had assisted in Indonesia&#x27;s local resistance movements against Japanese rule.

After the Kuomintang began to rule the island, the focus of the movement was as a vehicle for discontent from the native Taiwanese against the rule of &quot;mainlanders&quot; (i.e. mainland Chinese-born people who fled to Taiwan with KMT in the late 1940s). The February 28 Incident in 1947 and the ensuing martial law that lasted until 1987 contributed to the period of White Terror on the island. In 1979, the Kaohsiung Incident, occurred as the movement for democracy and independence intensified.

Between 1949 and 1991, the official position of the ROC government on Taiwan was that it was the legitimate government of all of China and it used this position as justification for authoritarian measures such as the refusal to vacate the seats held by delegates elected on the mainland in 1947 for the Legislative Yuan. The Taiwan independence movement intensified in response to this and presented an alternative vision of a sovereign and independent Taiwanese state. This vision was represented through a number of symbols such as the use of Taiwanese in opposition to the school-taught Mandarin Chinese.

Several scholars drafted various versions of a constitution, as both political statement or vision and as intellectual exercise. Most of these drafts favor a bicameral parliamentary rather than presidential system. In at least one such draft, seats in the upper house would be divided equally among Taiwan&#x27;s established ethnicities. In the 1980s the Chinese Nationalist government considered publication of these ideas criminal. In the most dramatic case, it decided to arrest the pro-independence publisher Cheng Nan-jung for publishing a version in his Tang-wai magazine, &quot;Liberty Era Weekly&quot; (). Rather than giving himself up, Cheng self-immolated in protest. Other campaigns and tactics toward such a State have included soliciting designs from the public for a new national flag and anthem (for example, &quot;Taiwan the Formosa&quot;). More recently the Taiwan Name Rectification Campaign () has played an active role. More traditional independence supporters, however, have criticized name rectification as merely a superficial tactic devoid of the larger vision inherent in the independence agenda.

Various overseas Taiwan Independence movements, such as the Formosan Association, World United Formosans for Independence, United Young Formosans for Independence, Union for Formosa&#x27;s Independence in Europe, United Formosans in America for Independence, and Committee for Human Rights in Formosa, published &quot;The Independent Formosa&quot; in several volumes with the publisher &quot;Formosan Association.&quot; In &quot;The Independent Formosa, Volumes 2–3&quot;, they tried to justify Taiwanese collaboration with Japan during World War II by saying that the &quot;atmosphere covered the whole Japanese territories, including Korea and Formosa, and the Japanese mainlands as well&quot;, when Taiwanese publications supported Japan&#x27;s &quot;holy war&quot;, and that the people who did it were not at fault.

The Anti-communist Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Republic of China on Taiwan, believed the Americans were going to plot a coup against him along with Taiwan Independence. In 1950, Chiang Ching-kuo became director of the secret police, which he remained until 1965. Chiang also considered some people who were friends to Americans to be his enemies. An enemy of the Chiang family, Wu Kuo-chen, was kicked out of his position of governor of Taiwan by Chiang Ching-kuo and fled to America in 1953. Chiang Ching-kuo, educated in the Soviet Union, initiated Soviet style military organization in the Republic of China Military, reorganizing and Sovietizing the political officer corps, surveillance, and Kuomintang party activities were propagated throughout the military. Opposed to this was Sun Li-jen, who was educated at the American Virginia Military Institute. Chiang orchestrated the controversial court-martial and arrest of General Sun Li-jen in August 1955, for plotting a coup d&#x27;état with the American CIA against his father Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang. The CIA allegedly wanted to help Sun take control of Taiwan and declare its independence.

During the martial law era lasting until 1987, discussion of Taiwan independence was forbidden in Taiwan, at a time when recovery of the mainland and national unification were the stated goals of the ROC. During that time, many advocates of independence and other dissidents fled overseas, and carried out their advocacy work there, notably in Japan and the United States. Part of their work involved setting up think tanks, political organizations, and lobbying networks in order to influence the politics of their host countries, notably the United States, the ROC&#x27;s main ally at the time, though they would not be very successful until much later. Within Taiwan, the independence movement was one of many dissident causes among the intensifying democracy movement of the 1970s, which culminated in the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was eventually formed to represent dissident causes.

After the lifting of martial law in 1987, and the acceptance of multi-party politics, the Democratic Progressive Party became increasingly identified with Taiwan independence, which entered its party platform in 1991. At the same time, many overseas independence advocates and organizations returned to Taiwan and for the first time openly promoted their cause in Taiwan, gradually building up political support. Many had previously fled to the US or Europe and had been on a blacklist held by KMT, which had held them back from going back to Taiwan. Where they had fled, they built many organisations like European Federation of Taiwanese Associations or Formosan Association for Public Affairs. By the late 1990s, DPP and Taiwan independence have gained a solid electoral constituency in Taiwan, supported by an increasingly vocal and hardcore base.
As the electoral success of the DPP, and later, the DPP-led Pan-Green Coalition grew in recent years, the Taiwan independence movement shifted focus to identity politics by proposing many plans involving symbolism and social engineering. The interpretation of historical events such as the February 28 Incident, the use of broadcast language and mother tongue education in schools, the official name and flag of the ROC, slogans in the army, orientation of maps all have been issues of concern to the present-day Taiwan independence movement. The movement, at its peak in the 70s through the 90s in the form of the Taiwan literature movement and other cultural upheavals, has moderated in recent years with the assimilation of these changes. Friction between &quot;mainlander&quot; and &quot;native&quot; communities on Taiwan has decreased due to shared interests: increasing economic ties with mainland China, continuing threats by the PRC to invade, and doubts as to whether or not the United States would support a unilateral declaration of independence. Since the late 1990s many supporters of Taiwan independence have argued that Taiwan, as the ROC, is already independent from the mainland, making a formal declaration unnecessary. In May 1999, the Democratic Progressive Party formalized this position in its &quot;Resolution on Taiwan&#x27;s Future&quot;.

==== Lee Teng-hui administration (1988–2000) ====
In 1995, Taiwanese president Lee Teng-hui was given permission to speak at Cornell University about his dream of Taiwanese independence, the first time a Taiwanese leader had been allowed to visit the United States. This led to a military response from China that included buying Russian submarines and conducting missile tests near Taiwan.

==== Chen Shui-bian administration (2000–2008) ====
In February 2007, President Chen Shui-bian initiated changes to names of state-owned enterprises, and the nation&#x27;s embassies and overseas representative offices. As a result, Chunghwa Post Co. () was renamed Taiwan Post Co. () and Chinese Petroleum Corporation () is now called &quot;CPC Corporation, Taiwan&quot; () and the signs in Taiwan&#x27;s embassies now display the word &quot;Taiwan&quot; in brackets after &quot;Republic of China&quot;. In 2007, the Taiwan Post Co. issued stamps bearing the name &quot;Taiwan&quot; in remembrance of the February 28 Incident. However, the name of the post office was reverted to &quot;Chunghwa Post Co.&quot; following the inauguration of Kuomintang president Ma Ying-jeou in 2008.

The Pan-Blue camp voiced its opposition to the changes and the former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said that it would generate diplomatic troubles and cause cross-strait tensions. It also argued that without a change in the relevant legislation pertaining to state-owned enterprises, the name changes of these enterprises could not be valid. As the Pan-Blue camp held only a slim parliamentary majority throughout the administration of President Chen, the Government&#x27;s motion to change the law to this effect were blocked by the opposition. Later, U.S. Department of State spokesman Sean McCormack said that the U.S. does not support administrative steps that would appear to change the status-quo by either Taipei or Beijing as threats to regional security.

Former president Lee Teng-hui has stated that he never pursued Taiwanese independence. Lee views Taiwan as already an independent state, and that the call for &quot;Taiwanese independence&quot; could even confuse the international community by implying that Taiwan once viewed itself as part of China. From this perspective, Taiwan is independent even if it remains unable to enter the UN. Lee said the most important goals are to improve the people&#x27;s livelihoods, build national consciousness, make a formal name change and draft a new constitution that reflects the present reality so that Taiwan can officially identify itself as a country.

==== Ma Ying-jeou administration (2008–2016) ====
Legislative elections were held on 12 January 2008, resulting in a supermajority (86 of the 113 seats) in the legislature for the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Pan-Blue Coalition. President Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s Democratic Progressive Party was handed a heavy defeat, winning only the remaining 27 seats. The junior partner in the Pan-Green Coalition, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, won no seats.

Two months later, the election for the 12th-term President and Vice-President of the Republic of China was held on Saturday, 22 March 2008. KMT nominee Ma Ying-jeou won, with 58% of the vote, ending eight years of Democratic Progressive Party rule. Along with the 2008 legislative election, Ma&#x27;s landslide victory brought the Kuomintang back to power in Taiwan.

On 1 August 2008, the Board of Directors of Taiwan Post Co. resolved to reverse the name change and restored the name &quot;Chunghwa Post&quot;. The Board of Directors, as well as resolving to restore the name of the corporation, also resolved to re-hire the chief executive dismissed in 2007, and to withdraw defamation proceedings against him.

On 2 September 2008, President Ma defined the relations between Taiwan and mainland China as &quot;special&quot;, but &quot;not that between two states&quot; – they are relations based on two areas of one state, with Taiwan considering that state to be the Republic of China, and mainland China considering that state to be the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Ma&#x27;s approach with the mainland is conspicuously evasive of political negotiations that may lead to unification which
is the mainland&#x27;s ultimate goal. The National Unification Guidelines remain &quot;frozen&quot; and Ma precluded any discussion of unification during his term by his &quot;three no&#x27;s&quot; (no unification, no independence, and no use of force).

==== Tsai Ing-wen and Lai Ching-te administration (2016–present) ====
The Democratic Progressive Party, led by Tsai Ing-wen, won a landslide victory over the Kuomintang in 2016 and was reelected in 2020. Her administration stated that it sought to maintain the current political status of Taiwan. The PRC government continued to criticize the ROC government, as the DPP administration has continued to not officially recognize the 1992 Consensus and the One China policy. 

Lai Ching-te, the Democratic Progressive Party candidate, won the presidential election in 2024. During the campaign period, Lai asserted Taiwanese sovereignty, but said a formal declaration of independence would be unnecessary and favored maintaining the status quo. He also said he would be willing to work with the Chinese government, but only if they renounce any intentions to use force against Taiwan.

== Legal basis for Taiwan independence ==
Taiwan independence is supported by the Pan-Green Coalition in Taiwan, led by the centre-left Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), but opposed by the Pan-Blue Coalition, led by the conservative Kuomintang (KMT). The former coalition aims to eventually achieve full sovereign independence for Taiwan. Whereas, the latter coalition aims to improve relations with the Beijing government (PRC) — which it refers to as &quot;mainland China&quot; — and eventually &quot;reunify&quot; at some point.

Both factions have long been forced to precariously dance around the so-called &quot;status quo&quot; of Taiwan&#x27;s political status. The DPP is unable to immediately declare independence due to pressure from the PRC and the KMT, whereas the KMT and PRC are unable to immediately achieve Chinese unification due to pressure from the DPP and its &quot;de facto&quot; allies (including the United States, Japan, and the European Union); further, the vast majority of Taiwanese as well as the KMT oppose the mainland&#x27;s proposed one country, two systems solution.

The 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki and 1951 Treaty of San Francisco are often cited as the main bases for Taiwan independence in international law, if such things as &quot;self-determination&quot; and the Montevideo Convention (on the Rights and Duties of States) are to be disregarded. These two treaties are not recognized by the Beijing government and the Pan-Blue Coalition of Taiwan.

=== Undetermined status theory ===
One hypothesis as to a legal basis for an independent Taiwanese state, the theory of the undetermined status of Taiwan, posits that:

a) Japan gained sovereignty over Taiwan in 1895

b) Japan lost sovereignty over Taiwan in 1951–1952 according to the Treaty of San Francisco

c) The Treaty of San Francisco does not assign Taiwan to any power

Therefore, some activists and legal scholars hold that, legally speaking, the island of Taiwan is not an integral part of the territory of the Republic of China (or any other internationally-recognized state); its status is more similar to a League of Nations mandate or United Nations trust territory administered by (the Republic of) China pending a final decision.

==== Mainland position ====
The PRC government regards these agreements as irrelevant to the Taiwan issue, arguing that the Treaty of Shimonoseki (being an unequal treaty) has been nullified and the Treaty of San Francisco assigns Taiwan to China. It also cites the Potsdam Declaration and Cairo Communique as confirming Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan; inasmuch as the PRC is the internationally-recognized &quot;China&quot;, it thus posits that it is the lawful sovereign power on the island. The United Nations currently recognizes Taiwan as an integral part of China (and thus, implicitly, the PRC).

=== &quot;Huadu&quot; and &quot;Taidu&quot; ===
Within the Pan-Green Coalition of Taiwan, there are two main factions, the &quot;Huadu&quot; and &quot;Taidu&quot;. The more moderate &quot;Huadu&quot; faction, mainly located in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, posits Taiwan and its outlying islands are &quot;already&quot; a sovereign state under the name &quot;Republic of China&quot;&quot;,&quot; making a formal declaration of independence unnecessary. &quot;Huadu&quot; politics is the semi-official stance of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party under the Lai Ching-te and Tsai Ing-wen administrations. 

Conversely, the more radical &quot;Taidu&quot; faction advocates a more radical departure from the &quot;status quo&quot; by making a formal declaration of independence to create a &quot;de jure&quot; &quot;Republic of Taiwan&quot;; advocates for a &quot;de jure&quot; Taiwanese state can be found in smaller parties in the Pan-Green coalition, such as the Taiwan Statebuilding Party and Taiwan Solidarity Union, as well as in minority elements of the ruling DPP.

The term &quot;Taiwan independence movement&quot; is thus somewhat imprecise inasmuch its main representative, the Democratic Progressive Party, does not support any change in the constitutional name of the Taiwanese state for the foreseeable future; they generally view the modern Republic of China as synonymous with a sovereign Taiwanese state; the incumbent President of Taiwan, Lai Ching-te of the DPP, believes that &quot;Taiwan is already a sovereign, independent country called the Republic of China&quot;.

=== Kinmen and Matsu issue ===

==== Background ====

When the government of the Republic of China (under the Kuomintang) was forced to retreat to Formosa and the Pescadores (Taiwan and Penghu) in 1949, several Chinese (i.e. not Japanese) islands still remained under Kuomintang control. Because the Chinese Communist Party never gained control of the Kinmen, Wuqiu, and Matsu Islands, they are now governed by the Republic of China on Taiwan as Kinmen County (Kinmen and Wuqiu) and Lienchiang County (Matsu) within a streamlined Fujian Province. The islands are often referred to collectively as Quemoy and Matsu or as &quot;Golden Horse&quot;.

Historically, Kinmen County (&quot;Quemoy&quot;) and Lienchiang County (&quot;Matsu&quot;) served as important defensive strongholds for the Kuomintang during the 1950–1970s, symbolizing the frontline of Kuomintang resistance against the Communist rebellion. They represented the last Kuomintang presence in &quot;mainland China&quot;. The islands received immense coverage from Western (especially United States) media during the First Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1954–1955 and the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1958. They were very significant in the context of the Cold War, a period from 1946 until 1991 of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union (and its allies) and the United States (and its allies).

Ever since the transition into multi-party politics (i.e. &quot;Democratization&quot;) during the 1990s, Kinmen and Lienchiang counties have now essentially developed into two electorates that can be contested through democratic elections. Currently the two electorates are &quot;strongholds&quot; for the Kuomintang due mainly to popular opinion within the electorates, rather than brute control (as in the past). The two electorates have recently developed close relations with the mainland, which lies only around 2–9 km west from the islands, whereas Taiwan lies around 166–189 km east from the islands.

==== Significance of Quemoy and Matsu ====
Quemoy and Matsu are unique and important for several reasons.
* The islands straddle the southeastern coastline of mainland China, only a few kilometers away from mainland China&#x27;s Fujian Province.
* The islands are geographically defined as being part of mainland China rather than Taiwan (aka &quot;Formosa and the Pescadores&quot;).
* The islands are defined as comprising the truncated, streamlined Fujian Province (officially &quot;Fuchien Province&quot;) of the ROC on Taiwan.

==== Quemoy and Matsu in Cross-Strait relations ====
Reportedly, the local government of Kinmen County supports stronger business and cultural ties with mainland China, similarly to the Kuomintang, and views itself as an important (representative) or (focal point) for improving Cross-Strait relations (that is, in the favour of Chinese unification). In January 2001, direct travel between Kinmen County (and Lienchiang County) and mainland China re-opened under the &quot;mini Three Links&quot;. As of 2015, Kinmen has plans to become a &quot;special economic zone&quot; in which free trade and free investment would be allowed between it and the neighbouring mainland SEZ of Xiamen. This might be accomplished in part by building a huge bridge connecting Kinmen to Xiamen, via the island of Lesser Kinmen (Lieyu); A bridge has since been constructed between Greater Kinmen and Lesser Kinmen. Additionally, Kinmen has plans to become a &quot;university island&quot;. In 2010, &quot;National Kinmen Institute of Technology&quot; was upgraded to &quot;National Quemoy University&quot;. Kinmen County plans to establish several branches of mainland Chinese universities in Kinmen, and has bargained with the central Taiwanese (ROC) government so that universities in Kinmen don&#x27;t have to be bounded by the same quotas as other Taiwanese universities in terms of admitting mainland Chinese students. In 2018, the local government of Kinmen County unveiled a new undersea pipeline linking Kinmen to mainland China, through which drinking-water can be imported. This business deal caused controversy in Taiwan and resulted in a &quot;stand-off&quot; between Kinmen County and the Mainland Affairs Council of Taiwan (ROC).

==== Quemoy and Matsu as part of Taiwan ====

Within Taiwan, one camp believes that Kinmen County (Quemoy) and Lienchiang County (Matsu) should be abandoned from a potential independent and sovereign Taiwanese state. This view aligns with the aforementioned treaties and acts that do not define Kinmen and Matsu as being part of Taiwan. This same camp also believes that the PRC has only &quot;allowed&quot; the ROC to continue controlling Kinmen and Matsu in order to &quot;tether&quot; Taiwan to mainland China. The fact that the PRC propagandizes Kinmen and Matsu is evidence that this is true to at least a certain degree. In a hypothetical scenario where Kinmen and Matsu are abandoned by the Taiwanese state, they would likely be &quot;ceded&quot; to the People&#x27;s Republic of China via a peace treaty, officially ending the Chinese Civil War.

Also within Taiwan, a second camp believes that Quemoy and Matsu belong to Taiwan. This camp believes that the ROC and Taiwan have become one and the same. By this logic, Taiwan effectively owns all of the same territories that the ROC is said to own. Among these territories is Quemoy and Matsu. If a potential Taiwanese state were to be created, this camp believes that the new country will actually be the successor state to the ROC, rather than an entirely new country. Therefore, if Taiwan independence were to be successfully achieved, then the islands of Quemoy and Matsu would hypothetically cease to be administered as &quot;Fujian Province&quot;, and would instead simply be classified as &quot;satellite islands of Taiwan&quot; (much in the same way as Penghu).

Despite the differing views of these two camps, there is a general understanding throughout Taiwan that Quemoy and Matsu are not part of the historical region of &quot;Taiwan&quot;, due to having never been governed under the following regimes: Dutch Formosa, Spanish Formosa, Kingdom of Tungning, Republic of Formosa, and Japanese Formosa. Additionally, Quemoy and Matsu experienced a unique history for several years as military outposts of the ROC, further separating the islands from Taiwan in terms of culture.

== Positions ==
The questions of independence and the island&#x27;s relationship to mainland China are complex and inspire very strong emotions among Taiwanese people. There are some who continue to maintain the KMT&#x27;s position, which states that the ROC is the sole legitimate government for &quot;all&quot; of China (of which they consider Taiwan to be a part), and that the aim of the government should be eventual unification of the mainland and Taiwan under the rule of the ROC. Some argue that Taiwan has been, and should continue to be, completely independent from China and should become a Taiwanese state with a distinct name. Then, there are numerous positions running the entire spectrum between these two extremes, as well as differing opinions on how best to manage either situation should it ever be realized.

On 25 October 2004, in Beijing, the U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said Taiwan is &quot;not sovereign,&quot; provoking strong comments from both the Pan-Green and Pan-Blue coalitions – but for very different reasons. From the DPP&#x27;s side, President Chen declared that &quot;Taiwan is definitely a sovereign, independent country, a great country that absolutely does not belong to the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;. The TSU (Taiwan Solidarity Union) criticized Powell, and questioned why the US sold weapons to Taiwan if it were not a sovereign state. From the KMT, then Chairman Ma Ying-jeou announced, &quot;the Republic of China has been a sovereign state ever since it was formed [in 1912].&quot; The pro-unification PFP Party Chairman, James Soong, called it &quot;Taiwan&#x27;s biggest failure in diplomacy.&quot;

=== Support for independence ===
The first view considers the move for Taiwan independence as a nationalist movement. Historically, this was the view of such pro-independence groups as the Tangwai movement (which later grew into the Democratic Progressive Party) who argued that the ROC under the Kuomintang had been a &quot;foreign regime&quot; forcibly imposed on Taiwan. Since the 1990s, supporters of Taiwan independence no longer actively make this argument. Instead, the argument has been that, in order to survive the growing power of the PRC, Taiwan must view itself as a separate and distinct entity from &quot;China.&quot; Such a change in view involves: 
* removing the name of &quot;China&quot; from official and unofficial items in Taiwan,
* changes in history books, which now portrays Taiwan as a central entity,
* promoting the use of Hokkien Language in the government and in the education system, 
* reducing economic and cultural links with mainland China,
* opposing Chinese unification regardless of mainland China being a democracy and
* promoting the general thinking that Taiwan is a separate entity. 

The goal of this movement is the eventual creation of a country where China is a &quot;foreign&quot; entity, and Taiwan is an internationally recognized &quot;country&quot; separate from any concept of &quot;China.&quot; The proposed &quot;Republic of Taiwan&quot; will exclude areas such as Quemoy and Matsu off the coast of Fujian, and some of the islands in the South China Sea (Taiping Island, Pratas Island, Zhongzhou Reef), which historically were not part of Taiwan. Some supporters of Taiwan independence argue that the Treaty of San Francisco justifies Taiwan independence by not explicitly granting Taiwan to either the ROC or the PRC, even though neither the PRC nor the ROC government accepts such legal justification. It is also thought that if formal independence were declared, Taiwan&#x27;s foreign policies would lean further towards Japan and the United States, and the desirable option of United Nations Trusteeship Council is also considered.

The Taiwan Independence Party won a single seat in the Legislative Yuan in the 1998 legislative election. The Taiwan Solidarity Union was formed in 2001, and is also supportive of independence. Though it gained more legislative support than TAIP in elections, the TSU&#x27;s legislative representation has dropped over time. In 2018, political parties and organizations demanding a referendum on Taiwan&#x27;s independence formed an alliance to further their objective. The Formosa Alliance was established on 7 April 2018, prompted by a sense of crisis in the face of growing pressure from China for unification. The alliance wanted to hold a referendum on Taiwan&#x27;s independence in April 2019, and change the island&#x27;s name from the &quot;Republic of China&quot; to &quot;Taiwan,&quot; and apply for membership in the United Nations. In August 2019, another party supportive of independence, the Taiwan Action Party Alliance was founded.

=== Support for status quo ===

A second view is that Taiwan is already an independent nation with the official name &quot;Republic of China,&quot; which has been independent (i.e. de facto separate from mainland China/de jure separate from PRC) since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, when the ROC lost control of mainland China, with only Taiwan (including the Penghu islands), Kinmen (Quemoy), the Matsu Islands off the coast of Fujian Province, and some of the islands in the South China Sea remaining under its administration. Although previously no major political faction adopted this pro-status quo viewpoint, because it is a &quot;compromise&quot; in face of PRC threats and American warnings against a unilateral declaration of independence, the DPP combined it with their traditional belief to form their latest official policy. This viewpoint has not been adopted by more radical groups such as the Taiwan Solidarity Union, which favor only the third view described above and are in favor of a Republic or State of Taiwan. In addition, many members of the Pan-Blue Coalition are rather suspicious of this view, fearing that adopting this definition of Taiwan independence is merely an insincere stealth tactical effort to advance desinicization and the third view of Taiwan independence. As a result, supporters of Pan-Blue tend to make a clear distinction between Taiwan &quot;independence&quot; and Taiwan &quot;sovereignty&quot;, while supporters of Pan-Green tend to try to blur the distinction between the two.

Most Taiwanese and political parties of the ROC support the status quo, and recognize that this is de facto independence through sovereign self-rule. Even among those who believe Taiwan is and should remain independent, the threat of war from PRC softens their approach, and they tend to support maintaining the status quo rather than pursuing an ideological path that could result in war with the PRC. When President Lee Teng-hui put forth the two-states policy, he received 80% support. A similar situation arose when President Chen Shui-bian declared that there was &quot;one country on each side&quot; of the Taiwan Strait. To this day, the parties disagree, sometimes bitterly, on such things as territory, name (R.O.C. or Taiwan), future policies, and interpretations of history. The Pan-Blue Coalition and the PRC believe that Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian are intent on publicly promoting a moderate form of Taiwan independence in order to advance secretly deeper forms of Taiwan independence, and that they intend to use popular support on Taiwan for political separation to advance notions of cultural and economic separation.

=== Opposition to independence ===

The third view, put forward by the government of the PRC and Nationalists of the KMT, defines Taiwan independence as &quot;splitting Taiwan from China, causing division of the nation and the people.&quot; What PRC claims by this statement is somewhat ambiguous according to supporters of Taiwanese independence, as some statements by the PRC seem to identify China solely and uncompromisingly with the PRC. Others propose a broader and more flexible definition suggesting that both mainland China and Taiwan are parts that form one cultural and geographic entity, although divided politically as a vestige of the Chinese Civil War. 

The KMT and the broader Pan-Blue coalition believe that China should be unified under the Republic of China (ROC) and opposes any attempts in de-sinicization that erases any links with China. Since 2016, divisions have emerged in the coalition following electoral defeats and widespread sentiments among the Taiwanese electorate that rejects any form of unification, with pro-Beijing elements beginning to infiltrate the ranks of the coalition through the united front that advocate unification under the PRC. 

The PRC considers itself the sole legitimate government of all China, and the ROC to be a defunct entity replaced in the Communist revolution that succeeded in 1949. Therefore, assertions that the ROC is a sovereign state are construed as support for Taiwan independence, so are proposals to change the name of the ROC. Such a name change is met with even more disapproval since it rejects Taiwan as part of the greater China entity (as one side of a still-unresolved Chinese civil war). The ROC used to be recognized by the UN as the sole legal government of China until 1971. In that year, the UN Resolution 2758 was passed, and the PRC became recognized as the legal government of China by the UN. Chinese nationalists have called the Taiwan independence movement and its supporters to be &quot;hanjian&quot; (traitors).

The Chinese Communist Party classifies Taiwan independence activists as one of the Five Poisons. In 2005, the 10th National People&#x27;s Congress passed the Anti-Secession Law authorizing military force for unification. In 2024, the Chinese government issued a directive to the courts stating that &quot;diehard&quot; independence supporters could be tried in absentia with capital punishment imposed.

== Opinion polls ==

In an opinion poll conducted in Taiwan by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation in 2022 found that among Taiwanese adults aged 20 years and older, 50% said they support Taiwan independence, 11.8% for unification, 25.7% for maintaining status quo. 

Several polls have indicated an increase in support of Taiwanese independence in the three decades after 1990. In a Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation poll conducted in June 2020, 54% of respondents supported &quot;de jure&quot; independence for Taiwan, 23.4% preferred maintaining the status quo, 12.5% favored unification with China, and 10% did not hold any particular view on the matter. This represented the highest level of support for Taiwanese independence since the survey was first conducted in 1991. A later TPOF poll in 2022 showed similar results. The Election Study Center, NCCU Taiwan Independence vs. Unification with the Mainland Survey shows a steady increase in respondents choosing &quot;maintain the status quo and move toward independence in the future&quot; since it started in 1994. However, the option &quot;maintain the status quo indefinitely&quot; had a similar increase in the same period and the most popular option was &quot;maintain the status quo and decide in the future between independence or unification&quot; every year between 1994 and 2022. The option &quot;independence as soon as possible&quot; never went above 10% in the same time period. &quot;unification as soon as possible&quot; has been more unpopular – never going above 4.5%.

<text>The Trident missile is a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV). Originally developed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Corporation, the missile is armed with thermonuclear warheads and is launched from nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). Trident missiles are carried by twelve United States Navy s, with American warheads, as well as four Royal Navy s, with British warheads. The missile is named after the mythological trident of Neptune.

==Development==
In 1971, the US Navy began studies of an advanced Undersea Long-range Missile System (ULMS). A Decision Coordinating Paper (DCP) for the ULMS was approved on 14 September 1971. ULMS program outlined a long-term modernization plan, which proposed the development of a longer-range missile termed ULMS II, which was to achieve twice the range of the existing Poseidon (ULMS I) missile. In addition to a longer-range missile, a larger submarine was proposed to replace the , and -class SSBNs in 1978. The ULMS II missile system was designed to be retrofitted to the existing SSBNs, while also being fitted to the proposed .

In May 1972, the term ULMS II was replaced with Trident. The Trident was to be a larger, higher-performance missile with a range capacity greater than . The first test of the Trident was on January 18, 1977 when an unarmed missile was launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida and traveled almost its full range of , to a point in the South Atlantic Ocean near Ascension Island.

Trident I (designated as &quot;C4&quot;) was deployed in 1979 and retired in 2005. Its objective was to achieve performance similar to Poseidon (C3) but at extended range. Trident II (designated &quot;D5&quot;) had the objective of improved circular error probable (CEP), or accuracy, and was first deployed in 1990, and was planned to be in service for the thirty-year life of the submarines, until 2027.

Trident missiles are provided to the United Kingdom under the terms of the 1963 Polaris Sales Agreement which was modified in 1982 for Trident. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wrote to President Carter on 10 July 1980, to request that he approve supply of Trident I missiles. However, in 1982 Thatcher wrote to President Reagan to request the United Kingdom be allowed to procure the Trident II system, the procurement of which had been accelerated by the US Navy. This was agreed upon in March 1982. Under the agreement, the United Kingdom paid an additional 5% of their total procurement cost of $2.5 billion to the US government as a research and development contribution.

The total cost of the Trident program thus far came to $39.546 billion in 2011, with a cost of $70 million per missile.

In 2009, the United States upgraded the warheads carried by American D5 missiles with an arming, fuzing and firing (AF&amp;F) system called the &quot;super-fuze&quot; that allows them to time their detonation to target silos and bunkers more accurately, greatly increasing their effectiveness against hardened targets.

==Description==

The launch from the submarine occurs below the sea surface. The missiles are ejected from their tubes by igniting an explosive charge in a separate container. The energy from the blast is directed to a water tank, where the water is flash-vaporized to steam. The subsequent pressure spike is strong enough to eject the missile out of the tube and give it enough momentum to reach and clear the surface of the water. The missile is pressurized with nitrogen to prevent the intrusion of water into any internal spaces, which could damage the missile or add weight, destabilizing the missile. Should the missile fail to breach the surface of the water, there are several safety mechanisms that can either deactivate the missile before launch or guide the missile through an additional phase of launch. Inertial motion sensors are activated upon launch, and when the sensors detect downward acceleration after being blown out of the water, the first-stage motor ignites. The aerospike, a telescoping outward extension that halves aerodynamic drag, is then deployed, and the boost phase begins. When the third-stage motor fires, within two minutes of launch, the missile is traveling faster than 20,000 ft/s (6,000 m/s), or 13,600 mph (21,600 km/h) Mach 18. Minutes after launch, the missile is outside the atmosphere and on a sub-orbital trajectory. 

The guidance system for the missile was developed by the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory and is maintained by a joint Draper/General Dynamics Mission Systems facility. It is an inertial navigation system with an additional star-sighting system (this combination is known as astro-inertial guidance), which is used to correct small position and velocity errors that result from launch condition uncertainties due to errors in the submarine navigation system and errors that may have accumulated in the guidance system during the flight due to imperfect instrument calibration. GPS has been used on some test flights but is assumed not to be available for a real mission. The fire control system was designed and continues to be maintained by General Dynamics Mission Systems. Once the star-sighting has been completed, the &quot;bus&quot; section of the missile maneuvers to achieve the various velocity vectors that will send the deployed multiple independent reentry vehicles to their individual targets. The downrange and crossrange dispersion of the targets remains classified.

The Trident was built in two variants: the I (C4) UGM-96A and II (D5) UGM-133A; however, these two missiles have little in common. While the C4, formerly known as EXPO (Extended Range Poseidon), is just an improved version of the Poseidon C-3 missile, the Trident II D-5 has a completely new design (although with some technologies adopted from the C-4). The C4 and D5 designations put the missiles within the &quot;family&quot; that started in 1960 with Polaris (A1, A2 and A3) and continued with the 1971 Poseidon (C3). Both Trident versions are three-stage, solid-propellant, inertially guided missiles, and both guidance systems use a star sighting to improve overall weapons system accuracy.

===Trident I (C4) UGM-96A===
The first eight &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarines were built with the Trident I missiles.

===Trident II (D5) UGM-133A===
The second variant of the Trident is more sophisticated and can carry a heavier payload. It is accurate enough to be a first strike, counterforce, or second strike weapon. All three stages of the Trident II are made of graphite epoxy, making the missile much lighter. The Trident II was the original missile on the British &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class and American &quot;Ohio&quot;-class SSBNs from &quot;Tennessee&quot; on. The D5 missile is currently carried by fourteen &quot;Ohio&quot;-class and four &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class SSBNs. There have been 191 successful test flights of the D5 missile since design completion in 1989, the most recent being from in September 2023. There have been fewer than 10 test flights that were failures, the most recent being from in January 2024. This is the second failure in a row for the Royal Navy after a launch from , one of Britain&#x27;s four nuclear-armed submarines, off the coast of Florida in June 2016.

The Royal Navy operates their missiles from a shared pool, together with the Atlantic squadron of the U.S. Navy &quot;Ohio&quot;-class SSBNs at King&#x27;s Bay, Georgia. The pool is &#x27;co-mingled&#x27; and missiles are selected at random for loading on to either nation&#x27;s submarines.

===D5LE (D5 Life Extension Program)===
In 2002, the United States Navy announced plans to extend the life of the submarines and the D5 missiles to the year 2040. This requires a D5 Life Extension Program (D5LEP), which is currently underway. The main aim is to replace obsolete components at minimal cost by using commercial off the shelf (COTS) hardware; all the while maintaining the demonstrated performance of the existing Trident II missiles. In 2007, Lockheed Martin was awarded a total of $848 million in contracts to perform this and related work, which also includes upgrading the missiles&#x27; reentry systems. On the same day, Draper Labs was awarded $318 million for upgrade of the guidance system. Then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair outlined plans in Parliament on 4 December 2006 to build a new generation of submarines (Dreadnought-class) to carry existing Trident missiles, and join the D5LE project to refurbish them.

The first flight test of a D-5 LE subsystem, the MK 6 Mod 1 guidance system, in Demonstration and Shakedown Operation (DASO)-23, took place on on 22 February 2012. This was almost exactly 22 years after the first Trident II missile was launched from &quot;Tennessee&quot; in February 1990.

===D5LE2 (D5 Life Extension Program 2)===
US Navy Vice Admiral Johnny Wolfe, in charge of overall submarine weapons systems procurement, indicated in 2020 that he had initiated trade studies to apply lessons from the D5LE program to extend the Trident II&#x27;s lifespan to 2084. Wolfe said he expected the first D5LE2 missiles to be deployed aboard the ninth &quot;Columbia&quot;-class submarine by FY 2039.

==Conventional Trident==
The Pentagon proposed the Conventional Trident Modification program in 2006 to diversify its strategic options, as part of a broader long-term strategy to develop worldwide rapid strike capabilities, dubbed &quot;Prompt Global Strike&quot;.

The $503 million program would have converted existing Trident II missiles (presumably two missiles per submarine) into conventional weapons, by fitting them with modified Mk4 reentry vehicles equipped with GPS for navigation update and a reentry guidance and control (trajectory correction) segment to perform 10-meter class impact accuracy. No explosive is said to be used since the reentry vehicle&#x27;s mass and hypersonic impact velocity provide sufficient mechanical energy and &quot;effect&quot;. The second conventional warhead version is a fragmentation version that would disperse thousands of tungsten rods which could obliterate an area of 3000 square feet (approximately 280 square meters). It offered the promise of accurate conventional strikes with little warning and flight time.

The primary drawback of using conventionally armed ballistic missiles is that to missile warning systems, they are virtually indistinguishable from nuclear armed missiles. This leaves open the likelihood that other nuclear-armed countries might mistake it for a nuclear launch which could provoke a counterattack. For that reason among others, this project raised a substantial debate before the US Congress for the FY07 Defense budget, but also internationally. Russian President Vladimir Putin, among others, warned that the project would increase the danger of accidental nuclear war. &quot;The launch of such a missile could… provoke a full-scale counterattack using strategic nuclear forces,&quot; Putin said in May 2006.

<text>A tsunami ( ; from , ) is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water, generally in an ocean or a large lake. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and underwater explosions (including detonations, landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances) above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami. Unlike normal ocean waves, which are generated by wind, or tides, which are in turn generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun, a tsunami is generated by the displacement of water from a large event.

Tsunami waves do not resemble normal undersea currents or sea waves because their wavelength is far longer. Rather than appearing as a breaking wave, a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising tide. For this reason, it is often referred to as a tidal wave, although this usage is not favoured by the scientific community because it might give the false impression of a causal relationship between tides and tsunamis. Tsunamis generally consist of a series of waves, with periods ranging from minutes to hours, arriving in a so-called &quot;wave train&quot;. Wave heights of tens of metres can be generated by large events. Although the impact of tsunamis is limited to coastal areas, their destructive power can be enormous, and they can affect entire ocean basins. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was among the deadliest natural disasters in human history, with at least 230,000 people killed or missing in 14 countries bordering the Indian Ocean.

The Ancient Greek historian Thucydides suggested in his 5th century BC &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; that tsunamis were related to submarine earthquakes, but the understanding of tsunamis remained slim until the 20th century, and much remains unknown. Major areas of current research include determining why some large earthquakes do not generate tsunamis while other smaller ones do. This ongoing research is designed to help accurately forecast the passage of tsunamis across oceans as well as how tsunami waves interact with shorelines.

==Terminology==
===Tsunami===

The term &quot;tsunami&quot; is a borrowing from the Japanese &quot;tsunami&quot; , meaning &quot;harbour wave.&quot; For the plural, one can either follow ordinary English practice and add an &quot;s&quot;, or use an invariable plural as in the Japanese. Some English speakers alter the word&#x27;s initial to an by dropping the &quot;t,&quot; since English does not natively permit at the beginning of words, though the original Japanese pronunciation is . The term has become commonly accepted in English, although its literal Japanese meaning is not necessarily descriptive of the waves, which do not occur only in harbours.

===Tidal wave===
Tsunamis are sometimes referred to as &quot;tidal waves&quot;. This once-popular term derives from the most common appearance of a tsunami, which is that of an extraordinarily high tidal bore. Tsunamis and tides both produce waves of water that move inland, but in the case of a tsunami, the inland movement of water may be much greater, giving the impression of an incredibly high and forceful tide. In recent years, the term &quot;tidal wave&quot; has fallen out of favour, especially in the scientific community, because the causes of tsunamis have nothing to do with those of tides, which are produced by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun rather than the displacement of water. Although the meanings of &quot;tidal&quot; include &quot;resembling&quot; or &quot;having the form or character of&quot; tides, use of the term &quot;tidal wave&quot; is discouraged by geologists and oceanographers.

A 1969 episode of the TV crime show &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; entitled &quot;Forty Feet High and It Kills!&quot; used the terms &quot;tsunami&quot; and &quot;tidal wave&quot; interchangeably.

===Seismic sea wave===
The term seismic sea wave is also used to refer to the phenomenon because the waves most often are generated by seismic activity such as earthquakes. Prior to the rise of the use of the term &quot;tsunami&quot; in English, scientists generally encouraged the use of the term &quot;seismic sea wave&quot; rather than &quot;tidal wave&quot;. However, like &quot;tidal wave&quot;, &quot;seismic sea wave&quot; is not a completely accurate term, as forces other than earthquakes—including underwater landslides, volcanic eruptions, underwater explosions, land or ice slumping into the ocean, meteorite impacts, and the weather when the atmospheric pressure changes very rapidly—can generate such waves by displacing water.

===Other terms===
The use of the term &quot;tsunami&quot; for waves created by landslides entering bodies of water has become internationally widespread in both scientific and popular literature, although such waves are distinct in origin from large waves generated by earthquakes. This distinction sometimes leads to the use of other terms for landslide-generated waves, including landslide-triggered tsunami, displacement wave, non-seismic wave, impact wave, and, simply, giant wave.

==History==


While Japan may have the longest recorded history of tsunamis, the sheer destruction caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami event mark it as the most devastating of its kind in modern times, killing around 230,000 people. The Sumatran region is also accustomed to tsunamis, with earthquakes of varying magnitudes regularly occurring off the coast of the island.

Tsunamis are an often underestimated hazard in the Mediterranean Sea and parts of Europe. Of historical and current (with regard to risk assumptions) importance are the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and tsunami (which was caused by the Azores–Gibraltar transform fault), the 1783 Calabrian earthquakes, each causing several tens of thousands of deaths and the 1908 Messina earthquake and tsunami. The tsunami claimed more than 123,000 lives in Sicily and Calabria and is among the deadliest natural disasters in modern Europe. The Storegga Slide in the Norwegian Sea and some examples of tsunamis affecting the British Isles refer to landslide and meteotsunamis, predominantly and less to earthquake-induced waves.

As early as 426 BC the Greek historian Thucydides inquired in his book &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; about the causes of tsunami, and was the first to argue that ocean earthquakes must be the cause. The oldest human record of a tsunami dates back to 479 BC, in the Greek colony of Potidaea, thought to be triggered by an earthquake. The tsunami may have saved the colony from an invasion by the Achaemenid Empire.

The cause, in my opinion, of this phenomenon must be sought in the earthquake. At the point where its shock has been the most violent the sea is driven back, and suddenly recoiling with redoubled force, causes the inundation. Without an earthquake I do not see how such an accident could happen.

The Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus (&quot;Res Gestae&quot; 26.10.15–19) described the typical sequence of a tsunami, including an incipient earthquake, the sudden retreat of the sea and a following gigantic wave, after the 365 AD tsunami devastated Alexandria.

==Causes==
The principal generation mechanism of a tsunami is the displacement of a substantial volume of water or perturbation of the sea. This displacement of water is usually caused by earthquakes, but can also be attributed to landslides, volcanic eruptions, glacier calvings or more rarely by meteorites and nuclear tests. However, the possibility of a meteorite causing a tsunami is debated.

===Seismicity===
Tsunamis can be generated when the sea floor abruptly deforms and vertically displaces the overlying water. Tectonic earthquakes are a particular kind of earthquake that are associated with the Earth&#x27;s crustal deformation; when these earthquakes occur beneath the sea, the water above the deformed area is displaced from its equilibrium position. More specifically, a tsunami can be generated when thrust faults associated with convergent or destructive plate boundaries move abruptly, resulting in water displacement, owing to the vertical component of movement involved. Movement on normal (extensional) faults can also cause displacement of the seabed, but only the largest of such events (typically related to flexure in the outer trench swell) cause enough displacement to give rise to a significant tsunami, such as the 1977 Sumba and 1933 Sanriku events.

Tsunamis have a small wave height offshore, and a very long wavelength (often hundreds of kilometres long, whereas normal ocean waves have a wavelength of only 30 or 40 metres), which is why they generally pass unnoticed at sea, forming only a slight swell usually about above the normal sea surface. They grow in height when they reach shallower water, in a wave shoaling process described below. A tsunami can occur in any tidal state and even at low tide can still inundate coastal areas.

On April 1, 1946, the 8.6 Aleutian Islands earthquake occurred with a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (&quot;Strong&quot;). It generated a tsunami which inundated Hilo on the island of Hawaii with a surge. Between 165 and 173 were killed. The area where the earthquake occurred is where the Pacific Ocean floor is subducting (or being pushed downwards) under Alaska.

Examples of tsunamis originating at locations away from convergent boundaries include Storegga about 8,000 years ago, Grand Banks in 1929, and Papua New Guinea in 1998 (Tappin, 2001). The Grand Banks and Papua New Guinea tsunamis came from earthquakes which destabilised sediments, causing them to flow into the ocean and generate a tsunami. They dissipated before travelling transoceanic distances.

The cause of the Storegga sediment failure is unknown. Possibilities include an overloading of the sediments, an earthquake or a release of gas hydrates (methane etc.).

The 1960 Valdivia earthquake (&quot;M&quot;w 9.5), 1964 Alaska earthquake (&quot;M&quot;w 9.2), 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake (&quot;M&quot;w 9.2), and 2011 Tōhoku earthquake (&quot;M&quot;w9.0) are recent examples of powerful megathrust earthquakes that generated tsunamis (known as teletsunamis) that can cross entire oceans. Smaller (&quot;M&quot;w 4.2) earthquakes in Japan can trigger tsunamis (called local and regional tsunamis) that can devastate stretches of coastline, but can do so in only a few minutes at a time.

===Landslides===
The Tauredunum event was a large tsunami on Lake Geneva in 563 CE, caused by sedimentary deposits destabilised by a landslide.
In the 1950s, it was discovered that tsunamis larger than had previously been believed possible can be caused by giant submarine landslides. These large volumes of rapidly displaced water transfer energy at a faster rate than the water can absorb. Their existence was confirmed in 1958, when a giant landslide in Lituya Bay, Alaska, caused the highest wave ever recorded, which had a height of . The wave did not travel far as it struck land almost immediately. The wave struck three boats—each with two people aboard—anchored in the bay. One boat rode out the wave, but the wave sank the other two, killing both people aboard one of them.

Another landslide-tsunami event occurred in 1963 when a massive landslide from Monte Toc entered the reservoir behind the Vajont Dam in Italy. The resulting wave surged over the -high dam by and destroyed several towns. Around 2,000 people died. Scientists named these waves megatsunamis.

Some geologists claim that large landslides from volcanic islands, e.g. Cumbre Vieja on La Palma (Cumbre Vieja tsunami hazard) in the Canary Islands, may be able to generate megatsunamis that can cross oceans, but this is disputed by many others.
In general, landslides generate displacements mainly in the shallower parts of the coastline, and there is conjecture about the nature of large landslides that enter the water. This has been shown to subsequently affect water in enclosed bays and lakes, but a landslide large enough to cause a transoceanic tsunami has not occurred within recorded history. Susceptible locations are believed to be the Big Island of Hawaii, Fogo in the Cape Verde Islands, La Reunion in the Indian Ocean, and Cumbre Vieja on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands; along with other volcanic ocean islands. This is because large masses of relatively unconsolidated volcanic material occurs on the flanks and in some cases detachment planes are believed to be developing. However, there is growing controversy about how dangerous these slopes actually are.

===Volcanic eruptions===
Other than by landslides or sector collapse, volcanoes may be able to generate waves by pyroclastic flow submergence, caldera collapse, or underwater explosions. Tsunamis have been triggered by a number of volcanic eruptions. The best-known is perhaps the massive tsunami caused by the eruption of the Santorini volcano around 1600 BC, which is often mentioned as driving the destruction of many harbours in the region and ultimately the decline of Minoan civilization - a question still subject to open debate. Others include the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, and the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha&#x27;apai eruption. Over 20% of all fatalities caused by volcanism during the past 250 years are estimated to have been caused by volcanogenic tsunamis.

Debate has persisted over the origins and source mechanisms of such tsunamis as those generated by Krakatoa in 1883, and they remain lesser understood than their seismic relatives. This poses the larger problem of awareness and preparedness, as exemplified by the eruption and collapse of Anak Krakatoa in 2018, which killed 426 and injured thousands when no warning was available. In all cases, developing better tsunami forecasting models and assessing the risks for densely populated coastal areas to be hit by severe tsunamis is a matter of global priority. 

It is still regarded that lateral landslides and ocean-entering pyroclastic currents are most likely to generate the largest and most hazardous waves from volcanism; however, field investigation of the Tongan event, as well as developments in numerical modelling methods, currently aim to expand the understanding of the other source mechanisms.

===Meteorological===

Some meteorological conditions, especially rapid changes in barometric pressure, as seen with the passing of a front, can displace bodies of water enough to cause trains of waves with wavelengths. These are comparable to seismic tsunamis, but usually with lower energies. Essentially, they are dynamically equivalent to seismic tsunamis, the only differences being 1) that meteotsunamis lack the transoceanic reach of significant seismic tsunamis, and 2) that the force that displaces the water is sustained over some length of time such that meteotsunamis cannot be modelled as having been caused instantaneously. In spite of their lower energies, on shorelines where they can be amplified by resonance, they are sometimes powerful enough to cause localised damage and potential for loss of life. They have been documented in many places, including the Great Lakes, the Aegean Sea, the English Channel, and the Balearic Islands, where they are common enough to have a local name, &quot;rissaga&quot;. In Sicily they are called &quot;marubbio&quot; and in Nagasaki Bay, they are called &quot;abiki&quot;. Some examples of destructive meteotsunamis include 31 March 1979 at Nagasaki and 15 June 2006 at Menorca, the latter causing damage in the tens of millions of euros.

Meteotsunamis should not be confused with storm surges, which are local increases in sea level associated with the low barometric pressure of passing tropical cyclones, nor should they be confused with setup, the temporary local raising of sea level caused by strong on-shore winds. Storm surges and setup are also dangerous causes of coastal flooding in severe weather but their dynamics are completely unrelated to tsunami waves. They are unable to propagate beyond their sources, as waves do.

=== Human-made or triggered tsunamis ===
The accidental Halifax Explosion in 1917 triggered an high tsunami in the harbour at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

There have been studies of the potential for the use of explosives to induce tsunamis as a tectonic weapon. As early as World War II (1939–1945), consideration of the use of conventional explosives was explored, and New Zealand&#x27;s military forces initiated Project Seal, which attempted to create small tsunamis with explosives in the area of what is now Shakespear Regional Park at the tip of the Whangaparāoa Peninsula in the Auckland Region of New Zealand; the attempt failed.

There has been considerable speculation about the possibility of using nuclear weapons to cause tsunamis near an enemy coastline. Nuclear testing in the Pacific Proving Ground by the United States generated poor results. In Operation Crossroads in July 1946, two bombs were detonated, one in the air over and one underwater within the shallow waters of the deep lagoon at Bikini Atoll. The bombs detonated about from the nearest island, where the waves were no higher than when they reached the shoreline. Other underwater tests, mainly Operation Hardtack I/Wahoo in deep water and Operation Hardtack I/Umbrella in shallow water, confirmed the results. Analysis of the effects of shallow and deep underwater explosions indicate that the energy of the explosions does not easily generate the kind of deep, all-ocean waveforms typical of tsunamis because most of the energy creates steam, causes vertical fountains above the water, and creates compressional waveforms. Tsunamis are hallmarked by permanent large vertical displacements of very large volumes of water which do not occur in explosions.

==Characteristics==

Tsunamis are caused by earthquakes, landslides, volcanic explosions, glacier calvings, and bolides. They cause damage by two mechanisms: the smashing force of a wall of water travelling at high speed, and the destructive power of a large volume of water draining off the land and carrying a large amount of debris with it, even with waves that do not appear to be large.

While everyday wind waves have a wavelength (from crest to crest) of about and a height of roughly , a tsunami in the deep ocean has a much larger wavelength of up to . Such a wave travels at well over , but owing to the enormous wavelength the wave oscillation at any given point takes 20 or 30 minutes to complete a cycle and has an amplitude of only about . This makes tsunamis difficult to detect over deep water, where ships are unable to feel their passage.

The velocity of a tsunami can be calculated by obtaining the square root of the depth of the water in metres multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (approximated to 10 m/s2). For example, if the Pacific Ocean is considered to have a depth of 5000 metres, the velocity of a tsunami would be = ≈ , which equates to a speed of about . This is the formula used for calculating the velocity of shallow-water waves. Even the deep ocean is shallow in this sense because a tsunami wave is so long (horizontally from crest to crest) by comparison.

The reason for the Japanese name &quot;harbour wave&quot; is that sometimes a village&#x27;s fishermen would sail out, and encounter no unusual waves while out at sea fishing, and come back to land to find their village devastated by a huge wave.

As the tsunami approaches the coast and the waters become shallow, wave shoaling compresses the wave and its speed decreases below . Its wavelength diminishes to less than and its amplitude grows enormously—in accord with Green&#x27;s law. Since the wave still has the same very long period, the tsunami may take minutes to reach full height. Except for the very largest tsunamis, the approaching wave does not break, but rather appears like a fast-moving tidal bore. Open bays and coastlines adjacent to very deep water may shape the tsunami further into a step-like wave with a steep-breaking front.

When the tsunami&#x27;s wave peak reaches the shore, the resulting temporary rise in sea level is termed &quot;run up&quot;. Run up is measured in metres above a reference sea level. A large tsunami may feature multiple waves arriving over a period of hours, with significant time between the wave crests. The first wave to reach the shore may not have the highest run-up.

About 80% of tsunamis occur in the Pacific Ocean, but they are possible wherever there are large bodies of water, including lakes. However, tsunami interactions with shorelines and the seafloor topography are extremely complex, which leaves some countries more vulnerable than others. For example, the Pacific coasts of the United States and Mexico lie adjacent to each other, but the United States has recorded ten tsunamis in the region since 1788, while Mexico has recorded twenty-five since 1732. Similarly, Japan has had more than a hundred tsunamis in recorded history, while the neighbouring island of Taiwan has registered only two, in 1781 and 1867.

==Drawback==
All waves have a positive and negative peak; that is, a ridge and a trough. In the case of a propagating wave like a tsunami, either may be the first to arrive. If the first part to arrive at the shore is the ridge, a massive breaking wave or sudden flooding will be the first effect noticed on land. However, if the first part to arrive is a trough, a drawback will occur as the shoreline recedes dramatically, exposing normally submerged areas. The drawback can exceed hundreds of metres, and people unaware of the danger sometimes remain near the shore to satisfy their curiosity or to collect fish from the exposed seabed.

A typical wave period for a damaging tsunami is about twelve minutes. Thus, the sea recedes in the drawback phase, with areas well below sea level exposed after three minutes. For the next six minutes, the wave trough builds into a ridge which may flood the coast, and destruction ensues. During the next six minutes, the wave changes from a ridge to a trough, and the flood waters recede in a second drawback. Victims and debris may be swept into the ocean. The process repeats with succeeding waves.

==Scales of intensity and magnitude==
As with earthquakes, several attempts have been made to set up scales of tsunami intensity or magnitude to allow comparison between different events.

===Intensity scales===
The first scales used routinely to measure the intensity of tsunamis were the &quot;Sieberg-Ambraseys scale&quot; (1962), used in the Mediterranean Sea and the &quot;Imamura-Iida intensity scale&quot; (1963), used in the Pacific Ocean. The latter scale was modified by Soloviev (1972), who calculated the tsunami intensity &quot;I&quot; according to the formula:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the &quot;tsunami height&quot; in metres, averaged along the nearest coastline, with the tsunami height defined as the rise of the water level above the normal tidal level at the time of occurrence of the tsunami. This scale, known as the &quot;Soloviev-Imamura tsunami intensity scale&quot;, is used in the global tsunami catalogues compiled by the NGDC/NOAA and the Novosibirsk Tsunami Laboratory as the main parameter for the size of the tsunami.

This formula yields:
* &quot;I&quot; = 2 for formula_2 = 2.8 metres
* &quot;I&quot; = 3 for formula_2 = 5.5 metres
* &quot;I&quot; = 4 for formula_2 = 11 metres
* &quot;I&quot; = 5 for formula_2 = 22.5 metres
* etc.

In 2013, following the intensively studied tsunamis in 2004 and 2011, a new 12-point scale was proposed, the Integrated Tsunami Intensity Scale (ITIS-2012), intended to match as closely as possible to the modified ESI2007 and EMS earthquake intensity scales.

===Magnitude scales===
The first scale that genuinely calculated a magnitude for a tsunami, rather than an intensity at a particular location was the ML scale proposed by Murty &amp; Loomis based on the potential energy. Difficulties in calculating the potential energy of the tsunami mean that this scale is rarely used. Abe introduced the &quot;tsunami magnitude scale formula_7&quot;, calculated from,

:formula_8

where &quot;h&quot; is the maximum tsunami-wave amplitude (in m) measured by a tide gauge at a distance &quot;R&quot; from the epicentre, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are constants used to make the Mt scale match as closely as possible with the moment magnitude scale.

==Tsunami heights==

Several terms are used to describe the different characteristics of tsunami in terms of their height:
* Amplitude, Wave Height, or Tsunami Height: Refers to the height of a tsunami relative to the normal sea level at the time of the tsunami, which may be tidal High Water, or Low Water. It is different from the crest-to-trough height which is commonly used to measure other type of wave height.
* Run-up Height, or Inundation Height: The height reached by a tsunami on the ground above sea level, Maximum run-up height refers to the maximum height reached by water above sea level, which is sometimes reported as the maximum height reached by a tsunami.
* Flow Depth: Refers to the height of tsunami above ground, regardless of the height of the location or sea level.
* (Maximum) Water Level: Maximum height above sea level as seen from trace or water mark. Different from maximum run-up height in the sense that they are not necessarily water marks at inundation line/limit.

==Warnings and predictions==

Drawbacks can serve as a brief warning. People who observe drawback (many survivors report an accompanying sucking sound) can survive only if they immediately run for high ground or seek the upper floors of nearby buildings.

In 2004, ten-year-old Tilly Smith of Surrey, England, was on Maikhao beach in Phuket, Thailand with her parents and sister, and having learned about tsunamis recently in school, told her family that a tsunami might be imminent. Her parents warned others minutes before the wave arrived, saving dozens of lives. She credited her geography teacher, Andrew Kearney.

In the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami drawback was not reported on the African coast or any other east-facing coasts that it reached. This was because the initial wave moved downwards on the eastern side of the megathrust and upwards on the western side. The western pulse hit coastal Africa and other western areas.

A tsunami cannot be precisely predicted, even if the magnitude and location of an earthquake is known. Geologists, oceanographers, and seismologists analyse each earthquake and based on many factors may or may not issue a tsunami warning. However, there are some warning signs of an impending tsunami, and automated systems can provide warnings immediately after an earthquake in time to save lives. One of the most successful systems uses bottom pressure sensors, attached to buoys, which constantly monitor the pressure of the overlying water column.

Regions with a high tsunami risk typically use tsunami warning systems to warn the population before the wave reaches land. On the west coast of the United States, which is prone to tsunamis from the Pacific Ocean, warning signs indicate evacuation routes. In Japan, the populace is well-educated about earthquakes and tsunamis, and along Japanese shorelines, tsunami warning signs remind people of the natural hazards along with a network of warning sirens, typically at the top of the cliffs of surrounding hills.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning System is based in Honolulu, Hawaii. It monitors Pacific Ocean seismic activity. A sufficiently large earthquake magnitude and other information triggers a tsunami warning. While the subduction zones around the Pacific are seismically active, not all earthquakes generate a tsunami. Computers assist in analysing the tsunami risk of every earthquake that occurs in the Pacific Ocean and the adjoining land masses.

As a direct result of the Indian Ocean tsunami, a re-appraisal of the tsunami threat for all coastal areas is being undertaken by national governments and the United Nations Disaster Mitigation Committee. A tsunami warning system is being installed in the Indian Ocean.

Computer models can predict tsunami arrival, usually within minutes of the arrival time. Bottom pressure sensors can relay information in real time. Based on these pressure readings and other seismic information and the seafloor&#x27;s shape (bathymetry) and coastal topography, the models estimate the amplitude and surge height of the approaching tsunami. All Pacific Rim countries collaborate in the Tsunami Warning System and most regularly practise evacuation and other procedures. In Japan, such preparation is mandatory for government, local authorities, emergency services and the population.

Along the United States west coast, in addition to sirens, warnings are sent on television and radio via the National Weather Service, using the Emergency Alert System.

===Possible animal reaction===

Some zoologists hypothesise that some animal species have an ability to sense subsonic Rayleigh waves from an earthquake or a tsunami. If correct, monitoring their behaviour could provide advance warning of earthquakes and tsunamis. However, the evidence is controversial and is not widely accepted. There are unsubstantiated claims about the Lisbon quake that some animals escaped to higher ground, while many other animals in the same areas drowned. The phenomenon was also noted by media sources in Sri Lanka in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. It is possible that certain animals (e.g., elephants) may have heard the sounds of the tsunami as it approached the coast. The elephants&#x27; reaction was to move away from the approaching noise. By contrast, some humans went to the shore to investigate and many drowned as a result.

==Mitigation==


In some tsunami-prone countries, earthquake engineering measures have been taken to reduce the damage caused onshore.

Japan, where tsunami science and response measures first began following a disaster in 1896, has produced ever-more elaborate countermeasures and response plans. The country has built many tsunami walls of up to high to protect populated coastal areas. Other localities have built floodgates of up to high and channels to redirect the water from an incoming tsunami. However, their effectiveness has been questioned, as tsunamis often overtop the barriers.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was directly triggered by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, when waves exceeded the height of the plant&#x27;s sea wall and flooded the emergency generators. Iwate Prefecture, which is an area at high risk from tsunami, had tsunami barriers walls (Taro sea wall) totalling long at coastal towns. The 2011 tsunami toppled more than 50% of the walls and caused catastrophic damage.

The Okushiri, Hokkaidō tsunami, which struck within two to five minutes of the earthquake on July 12, 1993, created waves tall—as high as a 10-storey building. The port town of Aonae was completely surrounded by a tsunami wall, but the waves washed right over the wall and destroyed all the wood-framed structures in the area. The wall may have succeeded in slowing down and moderating the height of the tsunami, but it did not prevent major destruction and loss of life.

<text>The Tower of London, officially His Majesty&#x27;s Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London, is a historic citadel and castle on the north bank of the River Thames in central London, England. It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, which is separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded toward the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was initially a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new Norman ruling class. The castle was also used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins), although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under kings Richard I, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.

The Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history. It was besieged several times, and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The Tower has served variously as an armoury, a treasury, a menagerie, the home of the Royal Mint, a public record office, and the home of the Crown Jewels of England. From the early 14th century until the reign of Charles II in the 17th century, the monarch would traditionally prepare for several nights at the Tower, and lead a procession from there to Westminster Abbey for their coronation. In the absence of the monarch, the Constable of the Tower was in charge of the castle. This was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period. In the late 15th century, the Princes in the Tower were housed at the castle when they mysteriously disappeared, presumed murdered. Under the Tudors, the Tower became used less as a royal residence, and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle, its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery.

The zenith of the castle&#x27;s use as a prison was the 16th and 17th centuries, when many figures who had fallen into disgrace, such as Elizabeth I before she became queen, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Elizabeth Throckmorton, were held within its walls. This use has led to the phrase &quot;&quot;. Despite its enduring reputation as a place of torture and death, popularised by 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century writers, only seven people were executed within the Tower before the world wars of the 20th century. Executions were more commonly held on the notorious Tower Hill to the north of the castle, with 112 occurring there over a 400-year period. In the latter half of the 19th century, institutions such as the Royal Mint moved out of the castle to other locations, leaving many buildings empty. Anthony Salvin and John Taylor took the opportunity to restore the Tower to what was felt to be its medieval appearance, clearing out many of the vacant post-medieval structures.

In the First and Second World Wars, the Tower was again used as a prison and witnessed the executions of 12 men for espionage. After the Second World War, damage caused during the Blitz was repaired, and the castle reopened to the public. Today, the Tower of London is one of the country&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions. Under the ceremonial charge of the Constable of the Tower, operated by the Resident Governor of the Tower of London and Keeper of the Jewel House, and guarded by the Yeomen Warders, the property is cared for by the charity Historic Royal Palaces and is protected as a World Heritage Site.

==Architecture==
===Layout===
The Tower was oriented with its strongest and most impressive defences overlooking Saxon London, which archaeologist Alan Vince suggests was deliberate. It would have visually dominated the surrounding area and stood out to traffic on the River Thames. The castle is made up of three &quot;wards&quot;, or enclosures. The innermost ward contains the White Tower and is the earliest phase of the castle. Encircling it to the north, east, and west is the inner ward, built during the reign of Richard I (1189–1199). Finally, there is the outer ward which encompasses the castle and was built under Edward I. Although there were several phases of expansion after William the Conqueror founded the Tower of London, the general layout has remained the same since Edward I completed his rebuild in 1285.

The castle encloses an area of almost with a further around the Tower of London constituting the Tower Liberties – land under the direct influence of the castle and cleared for military reasons. The precursor of the Liberties was laid out in the 13th century when Henry III ordered that a strip of land adjacent to the castle be kept clear. Despite popular fiction, the Tower of London never had a permanent torture chamber, although the basement of the White Tower housed a rack in later periods. Tower Wharf was built on the bank of the Thames under Edward I and was expanded to its current size during the reign of Richard II (1377–1399).

===White Tower===

The White Tower is a keep (also known as a donjon), which was often the strongest structure in a medieval castle, and contained lodgings suitable for the lord – in this case, the king or his representative. According to military historian Allen Brown, &quot;The great tower [White Tower] was also, by virtue of its strength, majesty and lordly accommodation, the donjon &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot;. As one of the largest keeps in the Christian world, the White Tower has been described as &quot;the most complete eleventh-century palace in Europe&quot;.
The White Tower, not including its projecting corner towers, measures at the base, and is high at the southern battlements. The structure was originally three storeys high, comprising a basement floor, an entrance level, and an upper floor. The entrance, as is usual in Norman keeps, was above ground, in this case on the south face, and accessed via a wooden staircase which could be removed in the event of an attack. It was probably during Henry II&#x27;s reign (1154–1189) that a forebuilding was added to the south side of the tower to provide extra defences to the entrance, but it has not survived. Each floor was divided into three chambers, the largest in the west, a smaller room in the north-east, and the chapel taking up the entrance and upper floors of the south-east. At the western corners of the building are square towers, while to the north-east a round tower houses a spiral staircase. At the south-east corner there is a larger semi-circular projection which accommodates the apse of the chapel. As the building was intended to be a comfortable residence as well as a stronghold, latrines were built into the walls, and four fireplaces provided warmth.

The main building material is Kentish ragstone, although some local mudstone was also used. Caen stone was imported from northern France to provide details in the Tower&#x27;s facing, although little of the original material survives as it was replaced with Portland stone in the 17th and 18th centuries. Reigate stone was also used as ashlar and for carved details. Its location, in the lower courses of the building and at higher levels corresponding to a building break, suggest it was readily available and may have been used when access to Caen stone was restricted. As most of the Tower&#x27;s windows were enlarged in the 18th century, only two original – albeit restored – examples remain, in the south wall at the gallery level.

The tower was terraced into the side of a mound, so the northern side of the basement is partially below ground level. As was typical of most keeps, the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower&#x27;s construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18th century when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. The basement is lit through small slits.
The entrance floor was probably intended for the use of the Constable of the Tower, Lieutenant of the Tower of London and other important officials. The south entrance was blocked during the 17th century, and not reopened until 1973. Those heading to the upper floor had to pass through a smaller chamber to the east, also connected to the entrance floor. The crypt of St John&#x27;s Chapel occupied the south-east corner and was accessible only from the eastern chamber. There is a recess in the north wall of the crypt; according to Geoffrey Parnell, Keeper of the Tower History at the Royal Armouries, &quot;the windowless form and restricted access, suggest that it was designed as a strong-room for safekeeping of royal treasures and important documents&quot;.

The upper floor contained a grand hall in the west and residential chamber in the eastboth originally open to the roof and surrounded by a gallery built into the walland St John&#x27;s Chapel in the south-east. The top floor was added in the 15th century, along with the present roof. St John&#x27;s Chapel was not part of the White Tower&#x27;s original design, as the apsidal projection was built after the basement walls. Due to changes in function and design since the tower&#x27;s construction, except for the chapel little is left of the original interior. The chapel&#x27;s current bare and unadorned appearance is reminiscent of how it would have been in the Norman period. In the 13th century, during Henry III&#x27;s reign, the chapel was decorated with such ornamentation as a gold-painted cross, and stained glass windows that depicted the Virgin Mary and the Holy Trinity.

===Innermost ward===
The innermost ward encloses an area immediately south of the White Tower, stretching to what was once the edge of the River Thames. As was the case at other castles, such as the 11th-century Hen Domen, the innermost ward was probably filled with timber buildings from the Tower&#x27;s foundation. Exactly when the royal lodgings began to encroach from the White Tower into the innermost ward is uncertain, although it had happened by the 1170s. The lodgings were renovated and elaborated during the 1220s and 1230s, becoming comparable with other palatial residences such as Windsor Castle. Construction of Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers – located at the corners of the innermost ward&#x27;s wall along the river – began around 1220. They probably served as private residences for the queen and king respectively.

The earliest evidence for how the royal chambers were decorated comes from Henry III&#x27;s reign: the queen&#x27;s chamber was whitewashed, and painted with flowers and imitation stonework. A great hall existed in the south of the ward, between the two towers. It was similar to, although slightly smaller than, that also built by Henry III at Winchester Castle. Near Wakefield Tower was a postern gate which allowed private access to the king&#x27;s apartments. The innermost ward was originally surrounded by a protective ditch, which had been filled in by the 1220s. Around this time, a kitchen was built in the ward. Between 1666 and 1676, the innermost ward was transformed and the palace buildings removed. The area around the White Tower was cleared so that anyone approaching would have to cross open ground. The Jewel House was demolished, and the Crown Jewels moved to Martin Tower.
===Inner ward===

The inner ward was created during Richard the Lionheart&#x27;s reign, when a moat was dug to the west of the innermost ward, effectively doubling the castle&#x27;s size. Henry III created the ward&#x27;s east and north walls, and the ward&#x27;s dimensions remain to this day. Most of Henry&#x27;s work survives, and only two of the nine towers he constructed have been completely rebuilt. Between the Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers, the innermost ward&#x27;s wall also serves as a curtain wall for the inner ward. The main entrance to the inner ward would have been through a gatehouse, most likely in the west wall on the site of what is now Beauchamp Tower. The inner ward&#x27;s western curtain wall was rebuilt by Edward I. The 13th-century Beauchamp Tower marks the first large-scale use of brick as a building material in Britain, since the 5th-century departure of the Romans. The Beauchamp Tower is one of 13 towers that stud the curtain wall. Clockwise from the south-west corner they are: Bell, Beauchamp, Devereux, Flint, Bowyer, Brick, Martin, Constable, Broad Arrow, Salt, Lanthorn, Wakefield, and the Bloody Tower. While these towers provided positions from which flanking fire could be deployed against a potential enemy, they also contained accommodation. As its name suggests, Bell Tower housed a belfry, its purpose to raise the alarm in the event of an attack. The royal bow-maker, responsible for making longbows, crossbows, catapults, and other siege and hand weapons, had a workshop in the Bowyer Tower. A turret at the top of Lanthorn Tower was used as a beacon by traffic approaching the Tower at night.

As a result of Henry&#x27;s expansion, St Peter ad Vincula, a Norman chapel which had previously stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls for himself and his queen. It was rebuilt by Edward I at a cost of over £300 and again by Henry VIII in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19th century. Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built at the same time as the inner ward&#x27;s curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. It was a simple structure, protected by a portcullis and gate. The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16th century, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower. Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers. During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward. The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. In 1663, just over £4,000 was spent building a new storehouse (now known as the New Armouries) in the inner ward. Construction of the Grand Storehouse north of the White Tower began in 1688, on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses; it was destroyed by fire in 1841. The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details, was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor.

===Outer ward===

A third ward was created during Edward I&#x27;s extension to the Tower, as the narrow enclosure completely surrounded the castle. At the same time a bastion known as Legge&#x27;s Mount was built at the castle&#x27;s northwest corner. Brass Mount, the bastion in the northeast corner, was a later addition. The three rectangular towers along the east wall apart were dismantled in 1843. Although the bastions have often been ascribed to the Tudor period, there is no evidence to support this; archaeological investigations suggest that Legge&#x27;s Mount dates from the reign of Edward I. Blocked battlements (also known as crenellations) in the south side of Legge&#x27;s Mount are the only surviving medieval battlements at the Tower of London (the rest are Victorian replacements). A new moat was dug beyond the castle&#x27;s new limits; it was originally deeper in the middle than it is today. With the addition of a new curtain wall, the old main entrance to the Tower of London was obscured and made redundant; a new entrance was created in the southwest corner of the external wall circuit. The complex consisted of an inner and an outer gatehouse and a barbican, which became known as the Lion Tower as it was associated with the animals as part of the Royal Menagerie since at least the 1330s. The Lion Tower itself no longer survives.

Edward extended the south side of the Tower of London onto land that had previously been submerged by the River Thames. In this wall, he built St Thomas&#x27;s Tower between 1275 and 1279; later known as Traitors&#x27; Gate, it replaced the Bloody Tower as the castle&#x27;s water-gate. The building is unique in England, and the closest parallel is the now demolished water-gate at the Louvre in Paris. The dock was covered with arrowslits in case of an attack on the castle from the River; there was also a portcullis at the entrance to control who entered. There were luxurious lodgings on the first floor. Edward also moved the Royal Mint into the Tower; its exact location early on is unknown, although it was probably in either the outer ward or the Lion Tower. By 1560, the Mint was located in a building in the outer ward near Salt Tower. Between 1348 and 1355, a second water-gate, Cradle Tower, was added east of St Thomas&#x27;s Tower for the king&#x27;s private use.
==History==
===Foundation and early history===
Victorious at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066, the invading Duke of Normandy, William the Conqueror, spent the rest of the year securing his holdings by fortifying key positions. He founded several castles along the way, but took a circuitous route toward London; only when he reached Canterbury did he turn towards England&#x27;s largest city. As the fortified bridge into London was held by Saxon troops, he decided instead to ravage Southwark before continuing his journey around southern England. A series of Norman victories along the route cut the city&#x27;s supply lines and in December 1066, isolated and intimidated, its leaders yielded London without a fight. Between 1066 and 1087, William established 36 castles, although references in the Domesday Book indicate that many more were founded by his subordinates. The Normans undertook what has been described as &quot;the most extensive and concentrated programme of castle-building in the whole history of feudal Europe&quot;. They were multi-purpose buildings, serving as fortifications (used as a base of operations in enemy territory), centres of administration, and residences.

William sent an advance party to prepare the city for his entrance, to celebrate his victory and found a castle; in the words of William&#x27;s biographer, William of Poitiers, &quot;certain fortifications were completed in the city against the restlessness of the huge and brutal populace. For he [William] realised that it was of the first importance to overawe the Londoners&quot;. At the time, London was the largest town in England; the foundation of Westminster Abbey and the old Palace of Westminster under Edward the Confessor had marked it as a centre of governance, and with a prosperous port it was important for the Normans to establish control over the settlement. The other two castles in London – Baynard&#x27;s Castle and Montfichet&#x27;s Castle – were established at the same time. The fortification that would later become known as the Tower of London was built onto the south-east corner of the Roman town walls, using them as prefabricated defences, with the River Thames providing additional protection from the south. This earliest phase of the castle would have been enclosed by a ditch and defended by a timber palisade, and probably had accommodation suitable for William.
Most of the early Norman castles were built from timber, but by the end of the 11th century a few, including the Tower of London, had been renovated or replaced with stone. Work on the White Tower – which gives the whole castle its name – is usually considered to have begun in 1078, however the exact date is uncertain. William made Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, responsible for its construction, although it may not have been completed until after William&#x27;s death in 1087. The White Tower is the earliest stone keep in England, and was the strongest point of the early castle. It also contained grand accommodation for the king. At the latest, it was probably finished by 1100 when Bishop Ranulf Flambard was imprisoned there. Flambard was loathed by the English for exacting harsh taxes. Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower, he was also the first person to escape from it, using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine. He was held in luxury and permitted servants, but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors. After plying them with drink, when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber, and out of the Tower. The escape came as such a surprise that one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that in 1097 King William II ordered a wall to be built around the Tower of London; it was probably built from stone and likely replaced the timber palisade that arced around the north and west sides of the castle, between the Roman wall (to the east) and the Thames (to the south). The Norman Conquest of London manifested itself not only with a new ruling class, but in the way the city was structured. Land was confiscated and redistributed amongst the Normans, who also brought over hundreds of Jews, for financial reasons. The Jews arrived under the direct protection of the Crown, as a result of which Jewish communities were often found close to castles. The Jews used the Tower as a retreat, when threatened by anti-Jewish violence.

The death in 1135 of Henry I left England with a disputed succession; although the king had persuaded his most powerful barons to swear support for the Empress Matilda, just a few days after Henry&#x27;s death Stephen of Blois arrived from France to lay claim to the throne. The importance of the city and its Tower is marked by the speed at which he secured London. The castle, which had not been used as a royal residence for some time, was usually left in the charge of a Constable, a post held at this time by Geoffrey de Mandeville. As the Tower was considered an impregnable fortress in a strategically important position, possession was highly valued. Mandeville exploited this, selling his allegiance to Matilda after Stephen was captured in 1141 at the Battle of Lincoln. Once her support waned, the following year he resold his loyalty to Stephen. Through his role as Constable of the Tower, Mandeville became &quot;the richest and most powerful man in England&quot;. When he tried the same ploy again, this time holding secret talks with Matilda, Stephen had him arrested, forced him to cede control of his castles, and replaced him with one of his most loyal supporters. Until then the position had been hereditary, originally held by Geoffrey de Mandeville, but the position&#x27;s authority was such that from then on it remained in the hands of an appointee of the monarch. The position was usually given to someone of great importance, who might not always be at the castle due to other duties. Although the Constable was still responsible for maintaining the castle and its garrison, from an early stage he had a subordinate to help with this duty: the Lieutenant of the Tower. Constables also had civic duties relating to the city. Usually they were given control of the city and were responsible for levying taxes, enforcing the law and maintaining order. The creation in 1191 of the position of Lord Mayor of London removed many of the Constable&#x27;s civic powers, and at times led to friction between the two.

===Expansion===
The castle probably retained its form as established by 1100 until the reign of Richard I (1189–1199). The castle was extended under William Longchamp, King Richard&#x27;s Lord Chancellor and the man in charge of England while he was on crusade. The Pipe rolls record £2,881 1s 10d spent at the Tower of London between 3 December 1189 and 11 November 1190, from an estimated £7,000 spent by Richard on castle building in England. According to the contemporary chronicler Roger of Howden, Longchamp dug a moat around the castle and tried in vain to fill it from the Thames. Longchamp was also Constable of the Tower, and undertook its expansion while preparing for war with King Richard&#x27;s younger brother, Prince John, who in Richard&#x27;s absence arrived in England to try to seize power. As Longchamp&#x27;s main fortress, he made the Tower as strong as possible. The new fortifications were first tested in October 1191, when the Tower was besieged for the first time in its history. Longchamp capitulated to John after just three days, deciding he had more to gain from surrender than prolonging the siege.

John succeeded Richard as king in 1199, but his rule proved unpopular with many of his barons, who in response moved against him. In 1214, while the king was at Windsor Castle, Robert Fitzwalter led an army into London and laid siege to the Tower. Although under-garrisoned, the Tower resisted and the siege was lifted once John signed Magna Carta. The king reneged on his promises of reform, leading to the outbreak of the First Barons&#x27; War. Even after Magna Carta was signed, Fitzwalter maintained his control of London. During the war, the Tower&#x27;s garrison joined forces with the barons. John was deposed in 1216 and the barons offered the English throne to Prince Louis, the eldest son of the French king. However, after John&#x27;s death in October 1216, many began to support the claim of his eldest son, Henry III. War continued between the factions supporting Louis and Henry, with Fitzwalter supporting Louis. Fitzwalter was still in control of London and the Tower, both of which held out until it was clear that Henry III&#x27;s supporters would prevail.

In the 13th century, Kings Henry III (1216–1272) and Edward I (1272–1307) extended the castle, essentially creating it as it stands today. Henry was disconnected from his barons, and a mutual lack of understanding led to unrest and resentment towards his rule. As a result, he was eager to ensure the Tower of London was a formidable fortification; at the same time Henry was an and wished to make the castle a comfortable place to live. From 1216 to 1227 nearly £10,000 was spent on the Tower of London; in this period, only the work at Windsor Castle cost more (£15,000). Most of the work was focused on the palatial buildings of the innermost ward. The tradition of whitewashing the White Tower (from which it derives its name) began in 1240.

Beginning around 1238, the castle was expanded to the east, north, and north-west. The work lasted through the reign of Henry III and into that of Edward I, interrupted occasionally by civil unrest. New creations included a new defensive perimeter, studded with towers, while on the west, north, and east sides, where the wall was not defended by the river, a defensive ditch was dug. The eastern extension took the castle beyond the bounds of the old Roman settlement, marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle&#x27;s defences. The Tower had long been a symbol of oppression, despised by Londoners, and Henry&#x27;s building programme was unpopular. So when the gatehouse collapsed in 1240, the locals celebrated the setback. The expansion caused disruption locally and £166 was paid to St Katherine&#x27;s Hospital and the prior of Holy Trinity in compensation.

Henry III often held court at the Tower of London, and held parliament there on at least two occasions (1236 and 1261) when he felt that the barons were becoming dangerously unruly. In 1258, the discontented barons, led by Simon de Montfort, forced the King to agree to reforms including the holding of regular parliaments. Relinquishing the Tower of London was among the conditions. Henry III resented losing power and sought permission from the pope to break his oath. With the backing of mercenaries, Henry installed himself in the Tower in 1261. While negotiations continued with the barons, the King ensconced himself in the castle, although no army moved to take it. A truce was agreed with the condition that the King hand over control of the Tower once again. Henry won a significant victory at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, allowing him to regain control of the country and the Tower of London. Cardinal Ottobuon came to England to excommunicate those who were still rebellious; the act was deeply unpopular and the situation was exacerbated when the cardinal was granted custody of the Tower. Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, marched on London in April 1267 and laid siege to the castle, declaring that custody of the Tower was &quot;not a post to be trusted in the hands of a foreigner, much less of an ecclesiastic&quot;. Despite a large army and siege engines, Gilbert de Clare was unable to take the castle. The Earl retreated, allowing the King control of the capital, and the Tower experienced peace for the rest of Henry&#x27;s reign.

Although he was rarely in London, Edward I undertook an expensive remodelling of the Tower, costing £21,000 between 1275 and 1285, over double that spent on the castle during the whole of Henry III&#x27;s reign. Edward I was a seasoned castle builder, and used his experience of siege warfare during the crusades to bring innovations to castle building. His programme of castle building in Wales heralded the introduction of the widespread use of arrowslits in castle walls across Europe, drawing on Eastern influences. At the Tower of London, Edward filled in the moat dug by Henry III and built a new curtain wall along its line, creating a new enclosure. A new moat was created in front of the new curtain wall. The western part of Henry III&#x27;s curtain wall was rebuilt, with Beauchamp Tower replacing the castle&#x27;s old gatehouse. A new entrance was created, with elaborate defences including two gatehouses and a barbican. In an effort to make the castle self-sufficient, Edward I also added two watermills. Six hundred Jews were imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1278, charged with coin clipping. Persecution of the country&#x27;s Jewish population under Edward began in 1276 and culminated in 1290 when he issued the Edict of Expulsion, forcing the Jews out of the country. In 1279, the country&#x27;s numerous mints were unified under a single system whereby control was centralised to the mint within the Tower of London, while mints outside of London were reduced, with only a few local and episcopal mints continuing to operate.

During this period, many Jews were imprisoned at the Tower before Edward I&#x27;s edict of expulsion in 1290.

===Later medieval period===

During Edward II&#x27;s reign (1307–1327) there was relatively little activity at the Tower of London. However, it was during this period that the Privy Wardrobe was founded. The institution was based at the Tower and responsible for organising the state&#x27;s arms. In 1321, Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere became the first woman imprisoned in the Tower of London after she refused Queen Isabella admittance to Leeds Castle and ordered her archers to target Isabella, killing six of the royal escort. Generally reserved for high-ranking inmates, the Tower was the most important royal prison in the country. However it was not necessarily very secure, and throughout its history people bribed the guards to help them escape. In 1323, Roger Mortimer, Baron Mortimer, was aided in his escape from the Tower by the Sub-Lieutenant of the Tower who let Mortimer&#x27;s men inside. They hacked a hole in his cell wall and Mortimer escaped to a waiting boat. He fled to France where he encountered Edward&#x27;s Queen. They began an affair and plotted to overthrow the King.

One of Mortimer&#x27;s first acts on entering England in 1326 was to capture the Tower and release the prisoners held there. For four years he ruled while Edward III was too young to do so himself; in 1330, Edward and his supporters captured Mortimer and threw him into the Tower. Under Edward III&#x27;s rule (1312–1377) England experienced renewed success in warfare after his father&#x27;s reign had put the realm on the backfoot against the Scots and French. Amongst Edward&#x27;s successes were the battles of Crécy and Poitiers where King John II of France was taken prisoner, and the capture of the King David II of Scotland at Neville&#x27;s Cross. During this period, the Tower of London held many noble prisoners of war. Edward II had allowed the Tower of London to fall into a state of disrepair, and by the reign of Edward III the castle was an uncomfortable place. The nobility held captive within its walls were unable to engage in activities such as hunting which were permissible at other royal castles used as prisons, for instance Windsor. Edward III ordered that the castle should be renovated.
When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John&#x27;s Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England&#x27;s fortune in the Hundred Years&#x27; War against France. As a result of Henry&#x27;s victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.

Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton. With the help of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (nicknamed &quot;the Kingmaker&quot;) Henry recaptured the throne for a short time in 1470. However, Edward IV soon regained control and Henry VI was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he was probably murdered. In 1471, during the Siege of London, the Tower&#x27;s Yorkist garrison exchanged fire with Lancastrians holding Southwark, and sallied from the fortress to take part in a pincer movement to attack Lancastrians who were assaulting Aldgate on London&#x27;s defensive wall. During the wars, the Tower was fortified to withstand gunfire, and provided with loopholes for cannons and handguns: an enclosure called the Bulwark was created for this purpose to the south of Tower Hill, although it no longer survives.
Shortly after the death of Edward IV in 1483, the notorious murder of the Princes in the Tower is traditionally believed to have taken place. The incident is one of the most infamous events associated with the Tower of London. Edward V&#x27;s uncle Richard, Duke of Gloucester was declared Lord Protector while the prince was too young to rule. Traditional accounts have held that the 12-year-old Edward was confined to the Tower of London along with his younger brother Richard. The Duke of Gloucester was proclaimed King Richard III in June. The princes were last seen in public in June 1483; it has traditionally been thought that the most likely reason for their disappearance is that they were murdered late in the summer of 1483. Bones thought to belong to them were discovered in 1674 when the 12th-century forebuilding at the entrance to the White Tower was demolished; however, the reputed level at which the bones were found () would put the bones at a depth similar to that of the Roman graveyard found, in 2011, underneath the Minories a few hundred yards to the north. Opposition to Richard escalated until he was defeated at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 by the Lancastrian Henry Tudor, who ascended to the throne as Henry VII. As king, Henry VII built a tower for a library next to the King&#x27;s Tower.

===Changing use===
The beginning of the Tudor period marked the start of the decline of the Tower of London&#x27;s use as a royal residence. As 16th-century chronicler Raphael Holinshed said the Tower became used more as &quot;an armouries and house of munition, and thereunto a place for the safekeeping of offenders than a palace roiall for a king or queen to sojourne in&quot;. Henry VII visited the Tower on fourteen occasions between 1485 and 1500, usually staying for less than a week at a time. The Yeoman Warders have been the Royal Bodyguard since at least 1509. In 1517 the Tower fired its cannon at City crowds engaged in the xenophobic Evil May Day riots, in which the properties of foreign residents were looted. It is not thought that any rioters were hurt by the gunfire, which was probably meant merely to intimidate the mob.

During the reign of Henry VIII, the Tower was assessed as needing considerable work on its defences. In 1532, Thomas Cromwell spent £3,593 on repairs and imported nearly 3,000 tons of Caen stone for the work. Even so, this was not sufficient to bring the castle up to the standard of contemporary military fortifications which were designed to withstand powerful artillery. Although the defences were repaired, the palace buildings were left in a state of neglect after Henry&#x27;s death. Their condition was so poor that they were virtually uninhabitable. From 1547 onwards, the Tower of London was only used as a royal residence when its political and historic symbolism was considered useful, for instance each of Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I briefly stayed at the Tower before their coronations.

In the 16th century, the Tower acquired an enduring reputation as a grim, forbidding prison. This had not always been the case. As a royal castle, it was used by the monarch to imprison people for various reasons, however these were usually high-status individuals for short periods rather than common citizenry as there were plenty of prisons elsewhere for such people. Contrary to the popular image of the Tower, prisoners were able to make their life easier by purchasing amenities such as better food or tapestries through the Lieutenant of the Tower. As holding prisoners was originally an incidental role of the Tower – as would have been the case for any castle – there was no purpose-built accommodation for prisoners until 1687 when a brick shed, a &quot;Prison for Soldiers&quot;, was built to the north-west of the White Tower. The Tower&#x27;s reputation for torture and imprisonment derives largely from 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century romanticists. Although much of the Tower&#x27;s reputation is exaggerated, the 16th and 17th centuries marked the castle&#x27;s zenith as a prison, with many religious and political undesirables locked away. The Privy Council had to sanction the use of torture, so it was not often used; between 1540 and 1640, the peak of imprisonment at the Tower, there were 48 recorded cases of the use of torture. The three most common forms used were the infamous rack, the Scavenger&#x27;s daughter, and manacles. The rack was introduced to England in 1447 by the Duke of Exeter, the Constable of the Tower; consequentially it was also known as the Duke of Exeter&#x27;s daughter. One of those tortured at the Tower was Guy Fawkes, who was brought there on 6 November 1605; after torture he signed a full confession to the Gunpowder Plot.

Among those held and executed at the Tower was Anne Boleyn. Although the Yeoman Warders were once the Royal Bodyguard, by the 16th and 17th centuries their main duty had become to look after the prisoners. The Tower was often a safer place than other prisons in London such as the Fleet, where disease was rife. High-status prisoners could live in conditions comparable to those they might expect outside; one such example was that while Walter Raleigh was held in the Tower his rooms were altered to accommodate his family, including his son who was born there in 1605. Executions were usually carried out on Tower Hill rather than in the Tower of London itself, and 112 people were executed on the hill over 400 years. Before the 20th century, there had been seven executions within the castle on Tower Green; as was the case with Lady Jane Grey, this was reserved for prisoners for whom public execution was considered dangerous. After Lady Jane Grey&#x27;s execution on 12 February 1554, Queen Mary I imprisoned her sister Elizabeth, later Queen Elizabeth I, in the Tower under suspicion of causing rebellion as Sir Thomas Wyatt had led a revolt against Mary in Elizabeth&#x27;s name.


The Office of Ordnance and Armoury Office were founded in the 15th century, taking over the Privy Wardrobe&#x27;s duties of looking after the monarch&#x27;s arsenal and valuables. As there was no standing army before 1661, the importance of the royal armoury at the Tower of London was that it provided a professional basis for procuring supplies and equipment in times of war. The two bodies were resident at the Tower from at least 1454, and by the 16th century they had moved to a position in the inner ward. The Board of Ordnance (successor to these Offices) had its headquarters in the White Tower and used surrounding buildings for storage. In 1855 the Board was abolished; its successor (the Military Store Department of the War Office) was also based there until 1869, after which its headquarters staff were relocated to the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich (where the recently closed Woolwich Dockyard was converted into a vast ordnance store).

Political tensions between Charles I and Parliament in the second quarter of the 17th century led to an attempt by forces loyal to the King to secure the Tower and its valuable contents, including money and munitions. London&#x27;s Trained Bands, a militia force, were moved into the castle in 1640. Plans for defence were drawn up and gun platforms were built, readying the Tower for war. The preparations were never put to the test. In 1642, Charles I attempted to arrest five members of parliament. When this failed he fled the city, and Parliament retaliated by removing Sir John Byron, the Lieutenant of the Tower. The Trained Bands had switched sides, and now supported Parliament; together with the London citizenry, they blockaded the Tower. With permission from the King, Byron relinquished control of the Tower. Parliament replaced Byron with a man of their own choosing, Sir John Conyers. By the time the English Civil War broke out in November 1642, the Tower of London was already in Parliament&#x27;s control.

The last monarch to uphold the tradition of taking a procession from the Tower to Westminster to be crowned was Charles II in 1661. At the time, the castle&#x27;s accommodation was in such poor condition that he did not stay there the night before his coronation. Under the Stuart kings the Tower&#x27;s buildings were remodelled, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. Just over £4,000 was spent in 1663 on building a new storehouse, now known as the New Armouries in the inner ward. In the 17th century there were plans to enhance the Tower&#x27;s defences in the style of the &quot;trace italienne&quot;, however they were never acted on. Although the facilities for the garrison were improved with the addition of the first purpose-built quarters for soldiers (the &quot;Irish Barracks&quot;) in 1670, the general accommodations were still in poor condition.
When the Hanoverian dynasty ascended the throne, their situation was uncertain and with a possible Scottish rebellion in mind, the Tower of London was repaired. Most of the work in this period (1750 to 1770) was done by the King&#x27;s Master Mason, John Deval. Gun platforms added under the Stuarts had decayed. The number of guns at the Tower was reduced from 118 to 45, and one contemporary commentator noted that the castle &quot;would not hold out four and twenty hours against an army prepared for a siege&quot;. For the most part, the 18th-century work on the defences was spasmodic and piecemeal, although a new gateway in the southern curtain wall permitting access from the wharf to the outer ward was added in 1774. The moat surrounding the castle had become silted over the centuries since it was created despite attempts at clearing it. It was still an integral part of the castle&#x27;s defences, so in 1830 the Constable of the Tower, the Duke of Wellington, ordered a large-scale clearance of several feet of silt. However this did not prevent an outbreak of disease in the garrison in 1841 caused by poor water supply, resulting in several deaths. To prevent the festering ditch posing further health problems, it was ordered that the moat should be drained and filled with earth. The work began in 1843 and was mostly complete two years later. The construction of the Waterloo Barracks in the inner ward began in 1845, when the Duke of Wellington laid the foundation stone. The building could accommodate 1,000 men; at the same time, separate quarters for the officers were built to the north-east of the White Tower. The building is now the headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. The popularity of the Chartist movement between 1828 and 1858 led to a desire to refortify the Tower of London in the event of civil unrest. It was the last major programme of fortification at the castle. Most of the surviving installations for the use of artillery and firearms date from this period.

During the First World War, eleven men were tried in private and shot by firing squad at the Tower for espionage. During the Second World War, the Tower was once again used to hold prisoners of war. One such person was Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s deputy, albeit just for four days in 1941. He was the last state prisoner to be held at the castle. The last person to be executed at the Tower was German spy Josef Jakobs who was shot on 15 August 1941. The executions for espionage during the wars took place in a prefabricated miniature rifle range which stood in the outer ward and was demolished in 1969. The Second World War also saw the last use of the Tower as a fortification. In the event of a German invasion, the Tower, together with the Royal Mint and nearby warehouses, was to have formed one of three &quot;keeps&quot; or complexes of defended buildings which formed the last-ditch defences of the capital.

==Restoration and tourism==

The Tower of London has become established as one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country. It has been a tourist attraction since at least the Elizabethan period, when it was one of the sights of London that foreign visitors wrote about. Its most popular attractions were the Royal Menagerie and displays of armour. The Crown Jewels also garner much interest, and have been on public display since 1669. The Tower steadily gained popularity with tourists through the 19th century, despite the opposition of the Duke of Wellington to visitors. Numbers became so high that by 1851 a purpose-built ticket office was erected. By the end of the century, over 500,000 were visiting the castle every year.

Over the 18th and 19th centuries, the palatial buildings were slowly adapted for other uses and demolished. Only the Wakefield and St Thomas&#x27;s Towers survived. The 18th century marked an increasing interest in England&#x27;s medieval past. One of the effects was the emergence of Gothic Revival architecture. In the Tower&#x27;s architecture, this was manifest when the New Horse Armoury was built in 1825 against the south face of the White Tower. It featured elements of Gothic Revival architecture such as battlements. Other buildings were remodelled to match the style and the Waterloo Barracks were described as &quot;castellated Gothic of the 15th century&quot;. Between 1845 and 1885 institutions such as the Mint which had inhabited the castle for centuries moved to other sites; many of the post-medieval structures left vacant were demolished. In 1855, the War Office took over responsibility for manufacture and storage of weapons from the Ordnance Office, which was gradually phased out of the castle. At the same time, there was greater interest in the history of the Tower of London.

Public interest was partly fuelled by contemporary writers, of whom the work of William Harrison Ainsworth was particularly influential. In &quot;The Tower of London: A Historical Romance&quot; he created a vivid image of underground torture chambers and devices for extracting confessions that stuck in the public imagination. Ainsworth also played another role in the Tower&#x27;s history, as he suggested that Beauchamp Tower should be opened to the public so they could see the inscriptions of 16th- and 17th-century prisoners. Working on the suggestion, Anthony Salvin refurbished the tower and led a further programme for a comprehensive restoration at the behest of Prince Albert. Salvin was succeeded in the work by John Taylor. When a feature did not meet his expectations of medieval architecture Taylor would ruthlessly remove it; as a result, several important buildings within the castle were pulled down and in some cases post-medieval internal decoration removed.
Although only one bomb fell on the Tower of London in the First World War (it landed harmlessly in the moat), the Second World War left a greater mark. On 23 September 1940, during the Blitz, high-explosive bombs damaged the castle, destroying several buildings and narrowly missing the White Tower. After the war, the damage was repaired and the Tower of London was reopened to the public.

A 1974 bombing in the White Tower Mortar Room left one person dead and 41 injured. No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but the police investigated suspicions that the IRA was behind it.

In the 21st century, tourism is the Tower&#x27;s primary role, with the remaining routine military activities, under the Royal Logistic Corps, having wound down in the latter half of the 20th century and moved out of the castle. However, the Tower is still home to the regimental headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, and the museum dedicated to it and its predecessor, the Royal Fusiliers. Also, a detachment of the unit providing the King&#x27;s Guard at Buckingham Palace still mounts a guard at the Tower, and with the Yeomen Warders, takes part in the Ceremony of the Keys each day. On several occasions through the year gun salutes are fired from the Tower by the Honourable Artillery Company, these consist of 62 rounds for royal occasions, and 41 on other occasions.
Since 1990, the Tower of London has been cared for by an independent charity, Historic Royal Palaces, which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown. In 1988, the Tower of London was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site. However, recent developments, such as the construction of skyscrapers nearby, have pushed the Tower towards being added to the United Nations&#x27; Heritage in Danger List. The remains of the medieval palace have been open to the public since 2006 where visitors can explore the restored chambers. Although the position of Constable of the Tower remains the highest position held at the Tower, the responsibility of day-to-day administration is delegated to the Resident Governor. The Constable is appointed for a five-year term; this is primarily a ceremonial post today but the Constable is also a trustee of Historic Royal Palaces and of the Royal Armouries. General Sir Gordon Messenger was appointed Constable in 2022.

At least six ravens are kept at the Tower at all times, in accordance with the belief that if they are absent, the kingdom will fall. They are under the care of the Ravenmaster, one of the Yeoman Warders. As well as having ceremonial duties, the Yeoman Warders provide guided tours around the Tower.

==Garrison==

The Yeomen Warders provided the permanent garrison of the Tower, but the Constable of the Tower could call upon the men of the Tower Hamlets to supplement them when necessary. The Tower Hamlets, aka Tower Division of Middlesex&#x27;s Ossulstone Hundred was an area, significantly larger than the modern London Borough of the same name, which owed military service to the Constable in his &quot;ex officio&quot; role as Lord Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets.

The earliest surviving reference to the inhabitants of the Tower Hamlets having a duty to provide a guard for the Tower of London is from 1554, during the reign of Mary I, but the relationship is thought to go back much further. Some believe the connection goes back to the time of the Conqueror. The duty is likely to have had its origin in the rights and obligations of the Manor of Stepney which covered most or all of the Hamlets area.

==Crown Jewels==
The tradition of housing the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London probably dates from the reign of Henry III (1216–1272). The Jewel House was built specifically to house the royal regalia, including jewels, plate, and symbols of royalty such as the crown, sceptre, and sword. When money needed to be raised, the treasure could be pawned by the monarch. The treasure allowed the monarch independence from the aristocracy and consequently was closely guarded. A new position for &quot;keeper of the jewels, armouries and other things&quot; was created, which was well rewarded; in the reign of Edward III (1327–1377) the holder was paid 12d a day. The position grew to include other duties including purchasing royal jewels, gold, and silver, and appointing royal goldsmiths and jewellers.

In 1649, during the English Commonwealth following Charles I&#x27;s execution, the contents of the Jewel House were disposed of along with other royal properties, as decreed by Cromwell. Metal items were sent to the Mint to be melted down and re-used, and the crowns were &quot;totallie broken and defaced&quot;.

When the monarchy was restored in 1660, the only surviving items of the coronation regalia were a 12th-century spoon and three ceremonial swords. (Some pieces that had been sold were later returned to the Crown.) Detailed records of old regalia survived, and replacements were made for the coronation of Charles II in 1661 based on drawings from the time of Charles I. For the coronation of Charles II, gems were rented because the treasury could not afford to replace them.

In 1669, the Jewel House was demolished and the Crown Jewels moved into Martin Tower (until 1841). They were displayed here for viewing by the paying public. This was exploited two years later when Colonel Thomas Blood attempted to steal them. Blood and his accomplices bound and gagged the Jewel House keeper. Although they laid their hands on the Imperial State Crown, Sceptre and Orb, they were foiled when the keeper&#x27;s son turned up unexpectedly and raised the alarm.

Since 1994, the Crown Jewels have been on display in the Jewel House in the Waterloo Block. Some of the pieces were once regularly used by Queen Elizabeth II. The display includes 23,578 gemstones, the 800-year-old Coronation Spoon, St Edward&#x27;s Crown (traditionally placed on a monarch&#x27;s head at the moment of crowning) and the Imperial State Crown.

==Royal Menagerie==

There is evidence that King John (1166–1216) first started keeping wild animals at the Tower. Records of 1210–1212 show payments to lion keepers.

The Royal Menagerie is frequently referenced during the reign of Henry III. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II presented Henry with three leopards, , which were kept in the Tower. In 1252, the sheriffs were ordered to pay fourpence a day towards the upkeep of the King&#x27;s polar bear, a gift from Haakon IV of Norway in the same year; the bear attracted a great deal of attention from Londoners when it went fishing in the Thames while tied to the land by a chain. In 1254 or 1255, Henry III received an African elephant from Louis IX of France depicted by Matthew Paris in his . A wooden structure was built to house the elephant, measuring . The animal died in 1258, possibly because it was given red wine, but also perhaps because of the cold climate of England.
In 1288, Edward I added a lion and a lynx and appointed the first official Keeper of the animals.
Edward III added other types of animals, two lions, a leopard and two wildcats. Under subsequent kings, the number of animals grew to include additional cats of various types, jackals, hyenas, and an old brown bear, Max, gifted to Henry VIII by Emperor Maximilian. In 1436, during the time of Henry VI, all the lions died and the employment of Keeper William Kerby was terminated.

Historical records indicate that a semi-circular structure or barbican was built by Edward I in 1277; this area was later named the Lion Tower, to the immediate west of the Middle Tower. Records from 1335 indicate the purchase of a lock and key for the lions and leopards, also suggesting they were located near the western entrance of the Tower. By the 1500s that area was called the Menagerie. Between 1604 and 1606 the Menagerie was extensively refurbished and an exercise yard was created in the moat area beside the Lion Tower. An overhead platform was added for viewing of the lions by the royals, during lion baiting, for example in the time of James I. Reports from 1657 include mention of six lions, increasing to 11 by 1708, in addition to other types of cats, eagles, owls and a jackal.

By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves, and &quot;other animals&quot;. By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant, and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828, there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.

After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie on the orders of the Duke of Wellington. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or Ensign Seymour had been bitten by a monkey. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent&#x27;s Park. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.

In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280 to 1385 and 1420–1480. In 2011, an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste.

== In folklore ==
The Tower of London has been represented in popular culture in many ways. As a result of 16th- and 19th-century writers, the Tower has a reputation as a grim fortress, a place of torture and execution.

One of the earliest traditions associated with the Tower was that it was built by Julius Caesar; the story was popular amongst writers and antiquaries. The earliest recorded attribution of the Tower to the Roman ruler dates to the mid-14th century in a poem by Sir Thomas Gray. The origin of the myth is uncertain, although it may be related to the fact that the Tower was built in the corner of London&#x27;s Roman walls. Another possibility is that someone misread a passage from Gervase of Tilbury in which he says Caesar built a tower at Odnea in France. Gervase wrote Odnea as Dodres, which is close to the French for London, Londres. Today, the story survives in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;, and as late as the 18th century some still regarded the Tower as built by Caesar.

Anne Boleyn was beheaded in 1536 for treason against Henry VIII; her ghost supposedly haunts the Church of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower, where she is buried, and has been said to walk around the White Tower carrying her head under her arm. This haunting is commemorated in the 1934 comic song &quot;With Her Head Tucked Underneath Her Arm&quot;. Other reported ghosts include Henry VI, Lady Jane Grey, Margaret Pole, and the Princes in the Tower. In January 1816, a sentry on guard outside the Jewel House claimed to have witnessed an apparition of a bear advancing towards him, and reportedly died of fright a few days later. In October 1817, a tubular, glowing apparition was claimed to have been seen in the Jewel House by the Keeper of the Crown Jewels, Edmund Lenthal Swifte. He said that the apparition hovered over the shoulder of his wife, leading her to exclaim: &quot;Oh, Christ! It has seized me!&quot; Other nameless and formless terrors have been reported, more recently, by night staff at the Tower.

<text>Thomas Mifflin (January 10, 1744January 20, 1800) was an American merchant, soldier, and politician from Pennsylvania, who is regarded as a Founding Father of the United States for his roles during and after the American Revolution. Mifflin signed the United States Constitution, was the first governor of Pennsylvania, serving from 1790 to 1799, and was also the state&#x27;s last president, succeeding Benjamin Franklin in 1788.

Born in Philadelphia, Mifflin became a merchant following his graduation from the College of Philadelphia. After serving in the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly and the First Continental Congress, where he signed the Continental Association, he joined the Continental Army in 1775. During the Revolutionary War, Mifflin was an aide to General George Washington and was appointed the army&#x27;s Quartermaster General, rising to the rank of major general. He returned to Congress in 1782 and was elected president of the Congress the following year. He served as speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1785 to 1787 and as president of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Supreme Executive Council from 1788 to 1790.

Mifflin was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and signed the United States Constitution. He then presided over the committee that wrote Pennsylvania&#x27;s state constitution, becoming the state&#x27;s first governor after the constitution&#x27;s ratification in 1790. Mifflin left office as governor in 1799 and died the following year.
== Early life and family ==

Mifflin was born January 10, 1744, in Philadelphia, in the Province of Pennsylvania. He was the son of John Mifflin and Elizabeth Bagnall. His great-grandfather John Mifflin Jr. (1662–1714) was born in Warminster, Wiltshire, England and settled in the Province of Pennsylvania.

In 1760, Mifflin graduated from the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania) and joined the mercantile business of William Biddle. After returning from a trip to Europe in 1765, he established a commercial business partnership with his brother, George Mifflin.

He married a second cousin, Sarah Morris, on March 4, 1767. Their daughter Emily Mifflin married Joseph Hopkinson, the son of Francis Hopkinson. After Sarah&#x27;s death in 1790, Emily became her father&#x27;s hostess and a family source references a total of four daughters in the family, &quot;all beautiful women.&quot; A source indicates that Sarah &quot;had no children of her own.&quot;
== Military service ==

Early in the Revolutionary War, Mifflin left the Continental Congress to serve in the Continental Army. He was commissioned as a major, then became an &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; of George Washington.

On August 14, 1775, Washington appointed him to become the army&#x27;s first quartermaster general, under order of Congress. Although it has been said that he was good at the job despite preferring to be on the front lines, questions were raised regarding his failure to properly supply Washington and the troops at Valley Forge, alleging that he had instead warehoused and sold supplies intended for Valley Forge to the highest bidder. Reportedly, after Washington confronted him about this, Mifflin asked to be relieved as quartermaster general but was persuaded to resume those duties because Congress was having difficulty finding a replacement.

Mifflin&#x27;s leadership in the Battle of Trenton and the Battle of Princeton led to a promotion to major general. In Congress, there was debate regarding whether a national army was more efficient or whether the individual states should maintain their own forces. As a result of this debate the Congressional Board of War was created, on which Mifflin served from 1777 to 1778. He then rejoined the army but took little active role, following criticism of his service as quartermaster general. He was accused of embezzlement and welcomed an inquiry; however, one never took place. He resigned his commission, but Congress continued to ask his advice even after accepting his resignation.

== Political career ==
Prior to American independence, Mifflin was a member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly (1772–1776). He served two terms in the Continental Congress (1774–1775 and 1782–1784), including seven months (November 1783 to June 1784) as that body&#x27;s presiding officer.

Mifflin&#x27;s most important duty as president was to accept on behalf of Congress the resignation of General George Washington on December 23, 1783. After the war, the importance of Congress declined so precipitously that Mifflin found it difficult to convince the states to send enough delegates to Congress to ratify the Treaty of Paris, which finally took place on January 14, 1784, at the Maryland State House in Annapolis. He also appointed Thomas Jefferson as a minister to France on May 7, 1784, and he appointed his former aide, Colonel Josiah Harmar, to be the commander of the First American Regiment.

Mifflin later served as a delegate to the United States Constitutional Convention in 1787. He was a signatory to the Continental Association and the Constitution. He served in the house of Pennsylvania General Assembly (1785–1788). He was a member of the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and on November 5, 1788, he was elected president of the Council, replacing Benjamin Franklin. He was unanimously reelected to the presidency on November 11, 1789. He presided over the committee that wrote Pennsylvania&#x27;s 1790 state constitution. That document did away with the Executive Council, replacing it with a single governor.

On December 21, 1790, Mifflin became the last president of Pennsylvania and the first governor of the Commonwealth. He held the latter office until December 17, 1799, when he was succeeded by Thomas McKean. The Whiskey Rebellion and the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic happened during his term in office. Fries Rebellion also started during his term. He then returned to the state legislature, where he served until his death the following month.

== Personal life ==

Although Mifflin&#x27;s family had been Quakers for four generations, he was expelled from the Religious Society of Friends when he joined the Continental Army, because his involvement with the military contradicted that faith&#x27;s pacifistic doctrines. Mifflin became a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1768 and served for two years as its secretary. He served from 1773 to 1791 as a trustee of the College and Academy of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania), including two years as treasurer (1773–1775).

== Death and legacy ==
Mifflin died in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on January 23, 1800. He is interred at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Lancaster.

A Commonwealth of Pennsylvania historical marker outside Holy Trinity, dedicated in 1975, commemorates Thomas Wharton and Mifflin, the first and last Presidents of Pennsylvania under the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. It reads:

<text>Telesto is a moon of Saturn. It was discovered by Smith, Reitsema, Larson and Fountain in 1980 from ground-based observations, and was provisionally designated . In the following months, several other apparitions were observed: , , and .

In 1983 it was officially named after Telesto of Greek mythology. It is also designated as  or Tethys B.

Telesto is co-orbital with Tethys, residing in Tethys&#x27; leading Lagrangian point (). This relationship was first identified by Seidelmann &quot;et al.&quot; in 1981. Another moon, Calypso, resides in the other (trailing) Lagrangian point of Tethys, 60 degrees in the other direction from Tethys. The Saturnian system has two additional trojan moons.

== Exploration ==

The &quot;Cassini&quot; probe performed a distant flyby of Telesto on October 11, 2005. The resulting images show that its surface is surprisingly smooth, devoid of small impact craters.

<text>The Thar Desert, also known as the Great Indian Desert, is an arid region in the north-western part of the Indian subcontinent that covers an area of in India and Pakistan. It is the world&#x27;s 18th-largest desert, and the world&#x27;s 9th-largest hot subtropical desert.

About 85% of the Thar Desert is in India, and about 15% is in Pakistan. The Thar Desert is about 4.56% of the total geographical area of India. More than 60% of the desert lies in the Indian state of Rajasthan; the portion in India also extends into Gujarat, Punjab, and Haryana. The portion in Pakistan extends into the provinces of Sindh and Punjab (the portion in the latter province is referred to as the Cholistan Desert). The Indo-Gangetic Plain lies to the north, west and northeast of the Thar desert, the Rann of Kutch lies to its south, and the Aravali Range borders the desert to the east.

The most recent paleontological discovery in 2023 from the Thar Desert in India, dating back to 167 million years ago, pertains to a herbivorous dinosaur group known as dicraeosaurids. This discovery marks the first of its kind to be unearthed in India and is also the oldest specimen of the group ever recorded in the global fossil record.

== History of desertification ==

===Ice-age desertification ===

During the Last Glacial Maximum 20,000 before present, an approximately ice sheet covered the Tibetan Plateau, causing excessive radiative forcing i.e. the ice in Tibet reflected at least four times more radiation energy per unit area into space than ice at higher latitudes, which further cooled overlying atmosphere at that time. This impacted the regional climate. Without the thermal low pressure caused by the heating, there was no monsoon over the Indian subcontinent. This lack of monsoon caused extensive rainfall over the Sahara, expansion of the Thar Desert, more dust deposited into the Arabian Sea, a lowering of the biotic life zones on the Indian subcontinent, and animals responded to this shift in climate with the Javan rusa deer migrating into India.

===Desertification due to drying up of Sarasvati river===

10,000-8,000 years ago a paleo channel of Ghaggar-Hakra River - identified with the paleo Sarasvati River, after confluence with Sutlej flowed into the Nara river - a delta channel of the Indus River, changed its course, leaving the Ghaggar-Hakra as a system of monsoon-fed rivers which did not reach the sea and now ends in the Thar desert.

Around 5,000 years ago when the monsoons that fed the rivers diminished further, the Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC) prospered in this area, with the rise of numerous IVC urban sites at Kalibangan (Rajasthan), Banawali and Rakhigarhi (Haryana), Dholavira and Lothal (Gujarat) along this course.

4,000 years ago when monsoons diminished even further, the dried-up Harkra become an intermittent river, and the urban Harappan civilisation declined, becoming localized in smaller agricultural communities.

==Geography==
The northeastern part of the Thar Desert lies between the Aravalli Hills. The desert stretches to Punjab and Haryana in the north, to the Great Rann of Kutch along the coast, and to the alluvial plains of the Indus River in the west and northwest. Much of the desert area is covered by huge, shifting sand dunes that receive sediments from the alluvial plains and the coast. The sand is highly mobile due to the strong winds that rise each year before the onset of the monsoon. The Luni River is the only river in the desert. Rainfall is per year, almost all of it between June and September.

Saltwater lakes within the Thar Desert include the Sambhar, Kuchaman, Didwana, Pachpadra, and Phalodi in Rajasthan and Kharaghoda in Gujarat. These lakes receive and collect rainwater during monsoon and evaporate during the dry season. The salt comes from the weathering of rocks in the region.

Lithic tools belonging to the prehistoric Aterian culture of the Maghreb have been discovered in Middle Paleolithic deposits in the Thar Desert.

===Climate===
The climate is arid and subtropical. Average temperature varies with season, and extremes can range from near-freezing in the winter to more than 50 °C in the summer months. Average annual rainfall ranges from 100 to 500 mm, and occurs during the short July-to-September southwest monsoon.

The desert has both a very dry part (the Marusthali region in the west) and a semidesert part (in the east) that has fewer sand dunes and slightly more precipitation.

===Desertification control===


The soil of the Thar Desert remains dry for much of the year, so it is prone to wind erosion. High-velocity winds blow soil from the desert, depositing some of it on neighboring fertile lands, and causing sand dunes within the desert to shift. To counteract this problem, sand dunes are stabilised by first erecting micro windbreak barriers with scrub material and then by afforestation of the treated dunes—planting the seedlings of shrubs (such as phog, senna, and castor oil plant) and trees (such as gum acacia, &quot;Prosopis juliflora&quot;, and lebbek tree). The 649-km-long Indira Gandhi Canal brings fresh water to the Thar Desert. It was built to halt any spreading of the desert into fertile areas.

===Protected areas===
There are several protected areas in the Thar Desert:
* In India:
** The Desert National Park, in Rajasthan, covers and represents the Thar Desert ecosystem; it includes 44 villages. Its diverse fauna includes the great Indian bustard (&quot;Chirotis nigricaps&quot;), blackbuck, chinkara, fox, Bengal fox, wolf, and caracal. Seashells and massive fossilized tree trunks in this park record the geological history of the desert.
** The Tal Chhapar Sanctuary covers and is an Important Bird Area. It is located in the Churu district, from Jaipur, in the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan. This sanctuary is home to large populations of blackbuck, fox, caracal, partridge, and sand grouse.
** The Sundha Mata Conservation Reserve covers and is located in the Jalore District of Rajasthan.
* In Pakistan:
** The Nara Desert Wildlife Sanctuary covers ; it is located in is located in Mirpurkhas District. It contains the largest population of the endangered mugger crocodile in Pakistan.
** The Rann of Kutch Wildlife Sanctuary located in Badin District is an Important Bird Area and Ramsar Site, with 30 species of mammals, 112 bird species, 20 reptiles, and 22 important plant species.
** The Lal Suhanra Biosphere Reserve and National Park is a UNESCO declared biosphere reserve, which covers the Cholistan region of the Greater Thar Desert.

==Biodiversity==

=== Fauna ===
Some wildlife species that are fast vanishing in other parts of India are found in the desert in large numbers, including the blackbuck (&quot;Antilope cervicapra&quot;), chinkara (&quot;Gazella bennettii&quot;), and Indian wild ass (&quot;Equus hemionus khur&quot;) in the Rann of Kutch. This may be partly because they are well adapted to this environment: they are smaller than similar animals that live in other environments, and they are mainly nocturnal. It may also be because grasslands in this region have not been transformed into cropland as fast as in other regions, and because a local community, the Bishnois, has made special efforts to protect them.

Other mammals in the Thar Desert include a subspecies of red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes pusilla&quot;) and the caracal, and a number of reptiles dwell there too.

The region is a haven for 141 species of migratory and resident desert birds, including harriers, falcons, buzzards, kestrels, vultures, short-toed eagles (&quot;Circaetus gallicus&quot;), tawny eagles (&quot;Aquila rapax&quot;), greater spotted eagles (&quot;Aquila clanga&quot;), and laggar falcons (&quot;Falco jugger&quot;).

The Indian peafowl is a resident breeder in the Thar region. The peacock is designated as the national bird of India and the provincial bird of the Punjab (Pakistan). It can be seen sitting on khejri or pipal trees in villages or Deblina.
=== Flora ===
The natural vegetation of this dry area is classified as northwestern thorn scrub forest (i.e. small, loosely-scattered patches of greenery). The densities and sizes of these green patches increase from west to east, following an increase in rainfall. The primary vegetation of the Thar Desert is composed of trees, shrubs, and perennial herb species, including:
*Trees and shrubs: &quot;Aerva javanica&quot;, &quot;Balanites roxburghii&quot;, &quot;Calotropis procera&quot;, &quot;Capparis decidua&quot;, &quot;Clerodendrum multiflorum&quot;, &quot;Commiphora mukul&quot;, &quot;Cordia sinensis&quot;, &quot;Crotalaria burhia&quot;, &quot;Euphorbia caducifolia&quot;, &quot;Euphorbia neriifolia&quot;, &quot;Grewia tenax&quot;, &quot;Leptadenia pyrotechnica&quot;, &quot;Lycium barbarum&quot;, &quot;Maytenus emarginata&quot;, &quot;Mimosa hamata&quot;, &quot;Suaeda fruticosa&quot;, &quot;Vachellia jacquemontii&quot;, &quot;Ziziphus nummularia&quot; and &quot;Z. zizyphus&quot;.
*Herbs and grasses: &quot;Ochthochloa compressa&quot;, &quot;Dactyloctenium scindicum&quot;, &quot;Cenchrus biflorus&quot;, &quot;Cenchrus setiger&quot;, &quot;Lasiurus scindicus&quot;, &quot;Cynodon dactylon&quot;, &quot;Panicum turgidum&quot;, &quot;Panicum antidotale&quot;, &quot;Dichanthium annulatum&quot;, &quot;Sporobolus marginatus&quot;, &quot;Saccharum spontaneum&quot;, &quot;Cenchrus ciliaris&quot;, &quot;Desmostachya bipinnata&quot;, &quot;Eragrostis&quot; species, &quot;Ergamopagan&quot; species, &quot;Phragmites&quot; species, &quot;Tribulus terrestris&quot;, &quot;Typha&quot; species, &quot;Sorghum halepense&quot;, &quot;Citrullus colocynthis&quot;

The endemic floral species include &quot;Calligonum polygonoides&quot;, &quot;Prosopis cineraria&quot;, &quot;Acacia nilotica&quot;, &quot;Tamarix aphylla&quot;, and &quot;Cenchrus biflorus&quot;.

==People==

The Thar people are the natives of the area. The Thar Desert is the most widely populated desert in the world, with a population density of 83 people per km2. In India, the inhabitants comprise Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Muslims. In Pakistan, inhabitants include both Muslims and Hindus.

About 40% of the total population of Rajasthan lives in the Thar Desert. The main occupations of the inhabitants are agriculture and animal husbandry.

Jodhpur, the largest city in the region, lies in the scrub forest zone at the desert&#x27;s perimeter. Bikaner and Jaisalmer are the largest cities located entirely in the desert.
=== Water and housing in the desert ===
In the true desert areas, the only sources of water for animals or humans are small, scattered ponds - some that are natural (&quot;tobas&quot;) and some that are human-made (&quot;johads&quot;). The persistence of water scarcity heavily influences life in all areas of the Thar, prompting many inhabitants to adopt a nomadic lifestyle. Most of the permanent human settlements are located near the two seasonal streams of the Karon-Jhar hills. Potable groundwater is also rare in the Thar Desert. Much of it tastes sour due to dissolved minerals. Potable water is mostly available only deep underground. When wells are dug that happen to yield sweet tasting water, people tend to settle near them, but such wells are difficult and dangerous to dig, sometimes claiming the lives of the well-diggers.

Crowded housing conditions are common in some areas.

==Economy==
===Agriculture===
The Thar is one of the most heavily populated desert areas in the world with the main occupations of its inhabitants being agriculture and animal husbandry.

Agricultural production is mainly from kharif crops, which are grown in the summer season and seeded in June and July. These are then harvested in September and October and include bajra, pulses such as guar, jowar (&quot;Sorghum vulgare&quot;), maize (&quot;zea mays&quot;), sesame and groundnuts.

The Thar region of Rajasthan is a major opium production and consumption area.

===Livestock===
===Agroforestry===


&quot;P. cineraria&quot; wood is reported to contain high calorific value and provide high-quality fuel wood. The lopped branches are good as fencing material. Its roots also encourage nitrogen fixation, which produces higher crop yields.
===Ecotourism===

Desert safaris on camels have become increasingly popular around Jaisalmer. Domestic and international tourists frequent the desert seeking adventure on camels for one to several days. This ecotourism industry ranges from cheaper backpacker treks to plush Arabian-Nights-style campsites replete with banquets and cultural performances. During the treks, tourists are able to view the fragile and beautiful ecosystem of the Thar Desert. This form of tourism provides income to many operators and camel owners in Jaisalmer, as well as employment for many camel trekkers in the desert villages nearby. People from various parts of the world come to see the Pushkar ka Mela (Pushkar Fair) and oases.
===Industry===
The government of India initiated departmental exploration for oil in 1955 and 1956 in the Jaisalmer area, Oil India Limited discovered natural gas in 1988 in the Jaisalmer basin. 

== History ==
The Desert National Park in Jaisalmer district has a collection of 180-million-year- old animal and plant fossils.

Jaisalmer State&#x27;s historical foundations are in the large empire ruled by the Bhati dynasty. The empire stretched from what is now Ghazni in modern-day Afghanistan to what is Sialkot, Lahore and Rawalpindi in modern-day Pakistan to the region that is Bhatinda and Hanumangarh in modern-day India. The empire crumbled over time because of continuous invasions from central Asia. According to Satish Chandra, the Hindu Shahis of Afghanistan made an alliance with the Bhatti rulers of Multhan because they wanted to end the slave raids that were made by the Turkic ruler of Ghazni, but the alliance was broken apart by Alp Tigin in 977 CE. Bhati dominions continued to shift southwards: they ruled Multan, then finally got pushed into Cholistan and Jaisalmer, where Rawal Devaraja built Dera Rawal / Derawar. Jaisalmer was founded as the new capital in 1156 by Maharawal Jaisal Singh and the state took its name from the capital. On 11 December 1818 Jaisalmer became a British protectorate through the Rajputana Agency.

Because the kingdom&#x27;s main source of income had long been levies on caravans, its economy suffered after Bombay became a major port, and sea trade largely replaced trade along the traditional land routes. Maharawals Ranjit Singh and Bairi Sal Singh tried to reverse the economic decline, but the kingdom nevertheless became impoverished. To make matters worse, there was a severe drought and a resulting famine from 1895 to 1900, during the reign of Maharawal Salivahan Singh, which caused the widespread loss of the livestock upon which the increasingly agriculturally based kingdom had come to rely.

In 1965 and 1971, population exchanges took place in the Thar between India and Pakistan; 3,500 Muslims shifted from the Indian section of the Thar to Pakistani Thar, whilst thousands of Hindu families also migrated from Pakistani Thar to the Indian section.

<text>A Tobin tax was originally defined as a tax on all spot conversions of one currency into another. It was suggested by James Tobin, an economist who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Tobin&#x27;s tax was originally intended to penalize short-term financial round-trip excursions into another currency. By the late 1990s, the term Tobin tax was being applied to all forms of short term transaction taxation, whether across currencies or not. The concept of the Tobin tax is being picked up by various tax proposals currently being discussed, amongst them the European Union Financial Transaction Tax as well as the Robin Hood tax.
== Original proposal ==

Tobin suggested his currency transaction tax in 1972 in his Janeway Lectures at Princeton, shortly after the Bretton Woods system of monetary management ended in 1971. Prior to 1971, one of the chief features of the Bretton Woods system was an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained the exchange rate of its currency within a fixed value—plus or minus one percent—in terms of gold. Then, on August 15, 1971, United States President Richard Nixon announced that the United States dollar would no longer be convertible to gold, effectively ending the system. This action created the situation whereby the U.S. dollar became the sole backing of currencies and a reserve currency for the member states of the Bretton Woods system, leading the system to collapse in the face of increasing financial strain in that same year. In that context, Tobin suggested a new system for international currency stability, and proposed that such a system include an international charge on foreign-exchange transactions.

In 2001, in another context, just after &quot;the 90s&#x27; crises in Mexico, Southeast Asia and Russia,&quot; which included the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, and the 1998 Russian financial crisis, Tobin summarized his idea:

 The tax on foreign exchange transactions was devised to cushion exchange rate fluctuations. The idea is very simple: at each exchange of a currency into another a small tax would be levied - let&#x27;s say, 0.5% of the volume of the transaction. This dissuades speculators as many investors invest their money in foreign exchange on a very short-term basis. If this money is suddenly withdrawn, countries have to drastically increase interest rates for their currency to still be attractive. But high interest is often disastrous for a national economy, as the nineties&#x27; crises in Mexico, Southeast Asia and Russia have proven. My tax would return some margin of manoeuvre to issuing banks in small countries and would be a measure of opposition to the dictate of the financial markets.

Though James Tobin suggested the rate as 0.5%, in that interview setting, others have tried to be more precise in their search for the optimum rate.

Economic literature of the period 1990s-2000s emphasized that variations in the terms of payment in trade-related transactions (so-called &quot;swaps&quot; for instance) provided a ready means of evading a tax levied on currency only. Accordingly, most debate on the issue has shifted towards a general financial transaction tax which would capture such proxies. Other measures to avoid punishing hedging (a form of insurance for cashflows) were also proposed. By the 2010s the Basel II and Basel III frameworks required reporting that would help to differentiate them and economic thought was tending to reject the belief that they could not be differentiated, or (as the &quot;Chicago School&quot; had held) should not be.

== Recent proposals ==

In March 2016 China drafted rules to impose a genuine currency transaction tax and this was referred to in financial press as a Tobin tax . This was widely viewed as a warning to curb shorting of its currency the yuan. It was however expected to keep this tax at 0% initially, calculating potential revenue from different rate schemes and exemptions, and not to impose the actual tax unless speculation increased.

Also in 2016 US Democratic Party POTUS nominee Hillary Clinton included in her platform a vow to &quot;Impose a tax on high-frequency trading. The growth of high-frequency trading has unnecessarily placed stress on our markets, created instability, and enabled unfair and abusive trading strategies. Hillary would impose a tax on harmful high-frequency trading and reform rules to make our stock markets fairer, more open, and transparent.&quot;. However, the term &quot;high-frequency&quot; implied that only a few large volume transaction players engaged in arbitrage would likely be affected. Clinton referred separately to &quot;Impose a risk fee on the largest financial institutions. Big banks and financial companies would be required to pay a fee based on their size and their risk of contributing to another crisis.&quot; The calculations of such fees would necessarily depend on financial risk management criteria (see Basel II and Basel III). Because of its restriction to so-called &quot;harmful high-frequency trading&quot; rather than to inter-currency transactions, neither of Clinton&#x27;s proposals could be considered a true Tobin tax though international exposure would be a factor in the &quot;risk fee&quot;.

==Concepts and definitions==

=== Hedging vs. speculation ===

Critics of all financial transaction taxes and currency transaction taxes emphasize the financial risk management difficulty of differentiating hedging from speculation, and the economic argument (attributed to the &quot;Chicago School&quot;) that they cannot in principle be differentiated. However, advocates of such taxes considered these problems manageable, especially in context of broader financial transaction tax.

===Tobin&#x27;s concept===
James Tobin&#x27;s purpose in developing his idea of a currency transaction tax was to find a way to manage exchange-rate volatility. In his view, &quot;currency exchanges transmit disturbances originating in international financial markets. National economies and national governments are not capable of adjusting to massive movements of funds across the foreign exchanges, without real hardship and without significant sacrifice of the objectives of national economic policy with respect to employment, output, and inflation.&quot;

Tobin saw two solutions to this issue. The first was to move &quot;toward a common currency, common monetary and fiscal policy, and economic integration.&quot; The second was to move &quot;toward greater financial segmentation between nations or currency areas, permitting their central banks and governments greater autonomy in policies tailored to their specific economic institutions and objectives.&quot; Tobin&#x27;s preferred solution was the former one but he did not see this as politically viable so he advocated for the latter approach: &quot;I therefore regretfully recommend the second, and my proposal is to throw some sand in the wheels of our excessively efficient international money markets.&quot;

Tobin&#x27;s method of &quot;throwing sand in the wheels&quot; was to suggest a tax on all spot conversions of one currency into another, proportional to the size of the transaction. In the development of his idea, Tobin was influenced by the earlier work of John Maynard Keynes on general financial transaction taxes.

Keynes&#x27; concept stems from 1936 when he proposed that a transaction tax should be levied on dealings on Wall Street, where he argued that excessive speculation by uninformed financial traders increased volatility. For Keynes (who was himself a speculator) the key issue was the proportion of &#x27;speculators&#x27; in the market, and his concern that, if left unchecked, these types of players would become too dominant.

===Variations on idea ===

The most common variations on Tobin&#x27;s idea are a general currency transaction tax, a more general financial transaction tax and (the most general) Robin Hood tax on transactions only richer investors can afford to engage in.

==== Pollin and Baker ====

A key issue with Tobin&#x27;s tax was &quot;avoidance by change of product mix... market participants would have an incentive to substitute out of financial instruments subject to the tax and into instruments not subject to it. In this fashion, markets would innovate so as to avoid the tax... [so] focusing on just spot currency markets would clearly induce a huge shifting of transactions into futures and derivatives markets. Thus, the real issue is how to design a tax that takes account of all the methods and margins of substitution that investors have for changing their patterns of activity to avoid the tax. Taking account of these considerations implies a Tobin tax that is bigger in scope, and pushes the design toward a generalized securities transaction tax that resembles the tax suggested by Pollin et al. (1999). There are four benefits to this. First, it is likely to generate significantly greater revenues. Second, it maintains a level playing field across financial markets so that no individual financial instrument is arbitrarily put at a competitive disadvantage versus another. Third, it is likely to enhance domestic financial market stability by discouraging domestic asset speculation. Fourth, to the extent that advanced economies already put too many real resources into financial dealings, it would cut back on this resource use, freeing these resources for other productive uses [Fourth] such substitution is costly both in resource use, and because alternative instruments do not provide exactly the same services [thus] just as the market provides an incentive to avoid a Tobin tax, so too it automatically sets in motion forces that deter excessive avoidance.&quot; - Palley, 2000 
Pollin, Palley and Baker (2000) emphasize that transaction taxes &quot;have clearly not prevented the efficient functioning of these markets. &quot;

====The Spahn tax====
According to Paul Bernd Spahn in 1995, &quot;Analysis has shown that the Tobin tax as originally proposed is not viable and should be laid aside for good.&quot;

====Special drawing rights====
On September 19, 2001, retired speculator George Soros put forward a proposal based on the IMF&#x27;s existing special drawing rights (SDRs) mechanism. In Soros&#x27; scheme, rich countries would pledge SDRs (which are denominated as a basket of multiple &#x27;hard&#x27; currencies) for the purpose of providing international assistance. Soros was not necessarily dismissing the Tobin tax idea. He stated, &quot;I think there is a case for a Tobin tax ... (but) it is not at all clear to me that a Tobin tax would reduce volatility in the currency markets. It is true that it may discourage currency speculation but it would also reduce the liquidity of the marketplace.&quot; In this Soros appeared to agree with the Chicago School.

===Scope===

The term &quot;Tobin tax&quot; has sometimes been used interchangeably with a specific currency transaction tax (CTT) in the manner of Tobin&#x27;s original idea, and other times it has been used interchangeably with the various different ideas of a more general financial transaction tax (FTT). In both cases, the various ideas proposed have included both national and multinational concepts. Examples of associating Tobin&#x27;s tax with these:
*April 2001: 
*December 2009: 

==Reactions==
== Proposals and implementations ==
It was originally assumed that the Tobin tax would require multilateral implementation, since one country acting alone would find it very difficult to implement this tax. Many people have therefore argued that it would be best implemented by an international institution. It has been proposed that having the United Nations manage a Tobin tax would solve this problem and would give the UN a large source of funding independent from donations by participating states. However, there have also been initiatives of national dimension about the tax. (This is in addition to the many countries that have foreign exchange controls.)

Whilst finding some support in countries with strong left-wing political movements such as France and Latin America, the Tobin tax proposal came under much criticism from economists and governments, especially those with liberal markets and a large international banking sector, who said it would be impossible to implement and would destabilise foreign exchange markets.

Most of the actual implementation of Tobin taxes, whether in the form of a specific currency transaction tax, or a more general financial transaction tax, has occurred at a national level. In July, 2006, analyst Marion G. Wrobel examined the international experiences of various countries with financial transaction taxes.

===EU financial transaction tax===


The EU financial transaction tax (EU FTT) is a proposal made by the European Commission in September 2011 to introduce a financial transaction tax within the 27 member states of the European Union by 2014. The tax would only impact financial transactions between financial institutions charging 0.1% against the exchange of shares and bonds and 0.01% across derivative contracts. According to the European Commission it could raise €57 billion every year, of which around €10bn (£8.4bn) would go to Great Britain, which hosts Europe&#x27;s biggest financial center. It is unclear whether a financial transaction tax is compatible with European law.

If implemented the tax must be paid in the European country where the financial operator is established. This &quot;R plus I&quot; (residence plus issuance) solution means the EU-FTT would cover all transactions that involve a single European firm, no matter if these transactions are carried out in the EU or elsewhere in the world. The scheme makes it impossible for say French or German banks to avoid the tax by moving their transactions offshore, unless they give up all their European customers.

Being faced with stiff resistance from some non-eurozone EU countries, particularly United Kingdom and Sweden, a group of eleven states began pursuing the idea of utilizing enhanced co-operation to implement the tax in states which wish to participate. Opinion polls indicate that 41 percent of the British people are in favour of some forms of FTT (see section: Public opinion).

The proposal supported by the eleven EU member states, was approved in the European Parliament in December 2012, and by the Council of the European Union in January 2013. The formal agreement on the details of the EU FTT still need to be decided upon and approved by the European Parliament.

===Swedish financial transaction taxes===
Wrobel&#x27;s paper highlighted the Swedish experience with financial transaction taxes. In January 1984, Sweden introduced a 0.5% tax on the purchase or sale of an equity security. Thus a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction resulted in a 1% tax. In July 1986 the rate was doubled. In January 1989, a considerably lower tax of 0.002% on fixed-income securities was introduced for a security with a maturity of 90 days or less. On a bond with a maturity of five years or more, the tax was 0.003%.

The revenues from taxes were disappointing; for example, revenues from the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million. In addition, as taxable trading volumes fell, so did revenues from capital gains taxes, entirely offsetting revenues from the equity transactions tax that had grown to 4,000 million Swedish kronor by 1988.

On the day that the tax was announced, share prices fell by 2.2%. But there was leakage of information prior to the announcement, which might explain the 5.35% price decline in the 30 days prior to the announcement. When the tax was doubled, prices again fell by another 1%. These declines were in line with the capitalized value of future tax payments resulting from expected trades. It was further felt that the taxes on fixed-income securities only served to increase the cost of government borrowing, providing another argument against the tax.

Even though the tax on fixed-income securities was much lower than that on equities, the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared. On 15 April 1990, the tax on fixed-income securities was abolished. In January 1991 the rates on the remaining taxes were cut in half and by the end of the year they were abolished completely. Once the taxes were eliminated, trading volumes returned and grew substantially in the 1990s and 2000s.

====Tobin tax proponents reaction to the Swedish experience====
The Swedish experience of a transaction tax was with purchase or sale of equity securities, fixed income securities and derivatives. In global international currency trading, however, the situation could, some argue, look quite different.

Wrobel&#x27;s studies do not address the global economy as a whole, as James Tobin did when he spoke of &quot;the nineties&#x27; crises in Mexico, South East Asia and Russia,&quot; which included the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, and the 1998 Russian financial crisis.

===British stock transaction tax (Stamp Duty)===
An existing example of a Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) is Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) and stamp duty. Stamp duty was introduced as an ad valorem tax on share purchases in 1808, preceding by over 150 years the Tobin tax on currency transactions. Changes were made in 1963. In 1963 the rate of the UK Stamp Duty was 2%, subsequently fluctuating between 1% and 2%, until a process of its gradual reduction started in 1984, when the rate was halved, first from 2% to 1%, and then once again in 1986 from 1% to the current level of 0.5%.

The changes in Stamp Duty rates in 1974, 1984, and 1986 provided researchers with &quot;natural experiments&quot;, allowing them to measure the impact of transaction taxes on market volume, volatility, returns, and valuations of UK companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. Jackson and O&#x27;Donnel (1985), using UK quarterly data, found that the 1% cut in the Stamp Duty in April 1984 from 2% to 1% lead to a &quot;dramatic 70% increase in equity turnover&quot;. Analyzing all three Stamp Duty rate changes, Saporta and Kan (1997) found that the announcements of tax rate increases (decreases) were followed by negative (positive) returns, but even though these results were statistically significant, they were likely to be influenced by other factors, because the announcements were made on Budget Days. Bond et al. (2005) confirmed the findings of previous studies, noting also that the impact of the announced tax rate cuts was more beneficial (increasing market value more significantly) in case of larger firms, which had higher turnover, and were therefore more affected by the transaction tax than stocks of smaller companies, less frequently traded.

Because the UK tax code provides exemptions from the Stamp Duty Reserve Tax for all financial intermediaries, including market makers, investment banks and other members of the LSE, and due to the strong growth of the contract for difference (CFD) industry, which provides UK investors with untaxed substitutes for LSE stocks, according to the Oxera (2007) report, more than 70% percent of the total UK stock market volume, including the entire institutional volume remained (in 2005) exempt from the Stamp Duty, in contrast to the common perception of this tax as a &quot;tax on bank transactions&quot; or a &quot;tax on speculation&quot;. On the other hand, as much as 40% of the Stamp Duty revenues come from taxing foreign residents, because the tax is &quot;chargeable whether the transaction takes place in the UK or overseas, and whether either party is resident in the UK or not.&quot;

===Sterling Stamp Duty===
In 2005, the Tobin tax was developed into a modern proposal by the United Kingdom NGO Stamp Out Poverty. It simplified the two-tier tax in favour of a mechanism designed solely as a means for raising development revenue. The currency market by this time had grown to $2,000 billion a day. To investigate the feasibility of such a tax they hired the City of London firm Intelligence Capital, who found that a tax on the pound sterling wherever it was traded in the world, as opposed to a tax on all currencies traded in the UK, was indeed feasible and could be unilaterally implemented by the UK government.

The Sterling Stamp Duty, as it became known, was to be set at a rate 200 times lower than Tobin had envisaged in 2001, which &quot;pro Tobin tax&quot; supporters claim wouldn&#x27;t have affected currency markets and could still raise large sums of money. The global currency market grew to $3,200 billion a day in 2007, or £400,000 billion per annum with the trade in sterling, the fourth most traded currency in the world, worth £34,000 billion a year. A sterling stamp duty set at 0.005% as some claim would have raised in the region of £2 billion a year in 2007. The All Party Parliamentary Group for Debt, Aid and Trade published a report in November 2007 into financing for development in which it recommended that the UK government undertake rigorous research into the implementation of a 0.005% stamp duty on all sterling foreign exchange transactions, to provide additional revenue to help bridge the funding gap required to pay for the Millennium Development Goals.

===Multinational proposals===
In 1996, the United Nations Development Programme sponsored a comprehensive feasibility and cost-benefit study of the Tobin tax:
Haq, Mahbub ul; Kaul, Inge; Grunberg, Isabelle (August 1996). The Tobin Tax: Coping with Financial Volatility. Oxford University Press. .

====European idea for a &#x27;first Euro tax&#x27;====
In late 2001, a Tobin tax amendment was adopted by the French National Assembly. However, it was overturned by March 2002 by the French Senate.

On June 15, 2004, the Commission of Finance and Budget in the Belgian Federal Parliament approved a bill implementing a Spahn tax. According to the legislation, Belgium will introduce the Tobin tax once all countries of the eurozone introduce a similar law. In July 2005 former Austrian chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel called for a European Union Tobin tax to base the communities&#x27; financial structure on more stable and independent grounds. However, the proposal was rejected by the European Commission.

On November 23, 2009, the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, after attending a meeting of the Bilderberg Group argued for a European version of the Tobin tax. This tax would go beyond just financial transactions: &quot;all shopping and petrol would be taxed.&quot;.
Countering him was his sister, Christine Van Rompuy, who said, &quot;any new taxes would directly affect the poor&quot;.

On June 29, 2011, the European Commission called for Tobin-style taxes on the EU&#x27;s financial sector to generate direct revenue starting from 2014. At the same time it suggested to reduce existing levies coming from the 27 member states.

====G20 nations====
The first nation in the G20 group to formally accept the Tobin tax was Canada. On March 23, 1999, the House of Commons of Canada passed a resolution directing the government to &quot;enact a tax on financial transactions in concert with the international community.&quot; However, ten years later, in November 2009, at the G20 finance ministers summit in Scotland, the representatives of the minority government of Canada spoke publicly on the world stage in opposition to that House of Commons of Canada resolution.

In September 2009, French president Nicolas Sarkozy brought up the issue of a Tobin tax once again, suggesting it be adopted by the G20.

On November 7, 2009, prime minister Gordon Brown said that G-20 should consider a tax on speculation, although did not specify that it should be on currency trading alone. The BBC reported that there was a negative response to the plan among the G20.

By December 11, 2009, European Union leaders expressed broad support for a Tobin tax in a communiqué sent to the International Monetary Fund.

For supporters of a Tobin tax, there is a wide range of opinion on who should administer a global Tobin tax and what the revenue should be used for. There are some who think that it should take the form of an insurance: In early November 2009, at the G20 finance ministers summit in Scotland, the British Prime Minister &quot;Mr. Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy, France&#x27;s president, suggested that revenues from the Tobin tax could be devoted to the world&#x27;s fight against climate change, especially in developing countries. They suggested that funding could come from &quot;a global financial transactions tax.&quot; However British officials later argued the main point of a financial transactions tax would be provide insurance for the global taxpayer against a future banking crisis.&quot;

====The feasibility of gradual implementation of the FTT, beginning with a few EU nations====
This scenario is possible, given the events in May and June, 2010:

* On June 27, 2010, at the 2010 G-20 Toronto summit, the G20 leaders declared that a &quot;global tax&quot; was no longer &quot;on the table,&quot; but that individual countries will be able to decide whether to implement a levy against financial institutions to recoup billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded bailouts.
* Nevertheless, Britain, France and Germany had already agreed before the summit to impose a &quot;bank tax.&quot; On May 20, 2010, German officials were understood to favour a financial transaction tax over a financial activities tax.

=====Simultaneous taxes in the European Union=====
On June 28, 2010, the European Union&#x27;s executive said it will study whether the European Union should go alone in imposing a tax on financial transactions after G20 leaders failed to agree on the issue.

The financial transaction tax would be &quot;separate&quot; from a bank levy, or a resolution levy, which some governments are &quot;also&quot; proposing to impose on banks to insure them against the costs of any future bailouts. EU leaders instructed their finance ministers, in May, 2010, to work out by the end of October 2010, details for the banking levy, but any financial transaction tax remains much more controversial.

====Latin America – Bank of the South====
In early November 2007, a regional Tobin tax was adopted by the Bank of the South, after an initiative of Presidents Hugo Chávez from Venezuela and Néstor Kirchner from Argentina.

====UN Global Tax====
According to Stephen Spratt, &quot;the revenues raised could be used for ... international development objectives ... such as meeting the Millennium Development Goals.&quot;(, p. 19) These are eight international development goals that 192 United Nations member states and at least 23 international organizations have agreed (in 2000) to achieve by the year 2015. They include reducing extreme poverty, reducing child mortality rates, fighting disease epidemics such as AIDS, and developing a global partnership for development.

At the UN September 2001 World Conference against Racism, when the issue of compensation for colonialism and slavery arose in the agenda, Fidel Castro, the President of Cuba, advocated the Tobin Tax to address that issue. (According to Cliff Kincaid, Castro advocated it &quot;specifically in order to generate U.S. financial reparations to the rest of the world,&quot; however a closer reading of Castro&#x27;s speech shows that he never did mention &quot;the rest of the world&quot; as being recipients of revenue.) Castro cited Holocaust reparations as a previously established precedent for the concept of reparations.

==Original idea and anti-globalization movement==
Tobin&#x27;s more specific concept of a &quot;currency transaction tax&quot; from 1972 lay dormant for more than 20 years but was revived by the advent of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. In December, 1997 Ignacio Ramonet, editor of &quot;Le Monde Diplomatique&quot;, renewed the debate around the Tobin tax with an editorial titled &quot;Disarming the markets&quot;. Ramonet proposed to create an association for the introduction of this tax, which was named ATTAC (Association for the Taxation of financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens). The tax then became an issue of the global justice movement or alter-globalization movement and a matter of discussion not only in academic institutions but even in streets and in parliaments in the UK, France, and around the world.

In an interview given to the Italian independent radio network Radio Popolare in July 2001 James Tobin distanced himself from the global justice movement. «&quot;There are agencies and groups in Europe that have used the Tobin Tax as an issue of broader campaigns, for reasons that go far beyond my proposal. My proposal was made into a sort of milestone for an antiglobalization program&quot;». James Tobin&#x27;s interview with Radio Popolare was quoted by the Italian foreign minister at the time, former director-general of the World Trade Organization Renato Ruggiero, during a Parliamentary debate on the eve of the G8 2001 summit in Genoa. 
Afterwards James Tobin distanced himself from the global justice movement.

Tobin observed that, while his original proposal had only the goal of &quot;putting a brake on the foreign exchange trafficking&quot;, the antiglobalization movement had stressed &quot;the income from the taxes with which they want to finance their projects to improve the world&quot;. He declared himself not contrary to this use of the tax&#x27;s income, but stressed that it was not the important aspect of the tax.

ATTAC and other organizations have recognized that while they still consider Tobin&#x27;s original aim as paramount, they think the tax could produce funds for development needs in the South (such as the Millennium Development Goals), and allow governments, and therefore citizens, to reclaim part of the democratic space conceded to the financial markets.

In March, 2002, London School of Economics Professor Willem Buiter, who studied under James Tobin, wrote an obituary for the man, but also remarked that, &quot;This [Tobin Tax] ... was in recent years adopted by some of the most determined enemies of trade liberalisation, globalisation and the open society.&quot; Buiter added, &quot;The proposal to use the Tobin tax as a means of raising revenues for development assistance was rejected by Tobin, and he forcefully repudiated the anti-globalisation mantra of the Seattle crowd.&quot; In September 2009, Buiter also wrote in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;Tobin was a genius ... but the Tobin tax was probably his one daft idea&quot;.

In those same &quot;years&quot; that Buiter spoke of, the Tobin tax was also &quot;adopted&quot; or supported in varying degrees by the people who were not, as he put it, &quot;enemies of trade liberalisation.&quot; Among them were several supporters from 1990 to 1999, including Larry Summers and several from 2000 to 2004, including lukewarm support from George Soros.

==Evaluating the Tobin tax as a Currency Transaction Tax (CTT)==
===Stability, volatility and speculation===

====The appeal of stability====
In 1972, Tobin examined the global monetary system that remained after the Bretton Woods monetary system was abandoned. This examination was subsequently revisited by other analysts, such as Ellen Frank, who, in 2002 wrote: &quot;If by globalization we mean the determined efforts of international businesses to build markets and production networks that are truly global in scope, then the current monetary system is in many ways an endless headache whose costs are rapidly outstripping its benefits.&quot; She continues with a view on how that monetary system stability is appealing to many players in the world economy, but is being undermined by volatility and fluctuation in exchange rates: &quot;Money scrambles around the globe in quest of the banker&#x27;s holy grail – sound money of stable value – while undermining every attempt by cash-strapped governments to provide the very stability the wealthy crave.&quot;

Frank then corroborates Tobin&#x27;s comments on the problems this instability can create (e.g. high interest rates) for developing countries such as Mexico (1994), countries in South East Asia (1997), and Russia (1998). She writes, &quot;Governments of developing countries try to peg their currencies, only to have the peg undone by capital flight. They offer to dollarize or euroize, only to find themselves so short of dollars that they are forced to cut off growth. They raise interest rates to extraordinary levels to protect investors against currency losses, only to topple their economies and the source of investor profits. ... IMF bailouts provide a brief respite for international investors but they are, even from the perspective of the wealthy, a short-term solution at best ... they leave countries with more debt and fewer options.&quot;

====Effect on volatility====
One of the main economic hypotheses raised in favor of financial transaction taxes is that such taxes reduce return volatility, leading to an increase of long-term investor utility or more predictable levels of exchange rates. The impact of such a tax on volatility is of particular concern because the main justification given for this tax by Tobin was to improve the autonomy of macroeconomic policy by curbing international currency speculation and its destabilizing effect on national exchange rates.

=====Theoretical models=====
Most studies of the likely impact of the Tobin tax on financial markets volatility have been &quot;theoretical&quot;—researches conducted laboratory simulations or constructed economic models. Some of these theoretical studies have concluded that a transaction tax could reduce volatility by crowding out speculators or eliminating individual &#x27;noise traders&#x27; but that it &#x27;would not have any impact on volatility in case of sufficiently deep global markets such as those in major currency pairs, unlike in case of less liquid markets, such as those in stocks and (especially) options, where volatility would probably increase with reduced volumes. Behavioral finance theoretical models, such as those developed by Wei and Kim (1997) or Westerhoff and Dieci (2006) suggest that transaction taxes can reduce volatility, at least in the foreign exchange market. In contrast, some papers find a positive effect of a transaction tax on market volatility. Lanne and Vesala (2006) argue that a transaction tax &quot;is likely to amplify, not dampen, volatility in foreign exchange markets&quot;, because such tax penalises informed market participants disproportionately more than uninformed ones, leading to volatility increases.

=====Empirical studies=====
In most of the available &quot;empirical&quot; studies however, no statistically significant causal link has been found between an increase in transaction costs (transaction taxes or government-controlled minimum brokerage commissions) and a reduction in volatility—in fact a frequent unintended consequence observed by &#x27;early adopters&#x27; after the imposition of a financial transactions tax (see Werner, 2003) has been an &quot;increase in the volatility&quot; of stock market returns, usually coinciding with significant declines in liquidity (market volume) and thus in taxable revenue (Umlauf, 1993).

For a recent evidence to the contrary, see, e.g., Liu and Zhu (2009), which may be affected by selection bias given that their Japanese sample is subsumed by a research conducted in 14 Asian countries by Hu (1998), showing that &quot;an increase in tax rate reduces the stock price but has no significant effect on market volatility&quot;. As Liu and Zhu (2009) point out, [...] the different experience in Japan highlights the comment made by Umlauf (1993) that it is hazardous to generalize limited evidence when debating important policy issues such as the STT [securities transaction tax] and brokerage commissions.&quot;

===Optimum Tobin tax rate===
When James Tobin was interviewed by &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in 2001, the tax rate he suggested was 0.5%. His use of the phrase &quot;let&#x27;s say&quot; (&quot;sagen wir&quot;) indicated that he was not, at that point, in an interview setting, trying to be precise. Others have tried to be more precise or practical in their search for the Tobin tax rate.

According to Garber (1996), competitive pressure on transaction costs (spreads) in currency markets has reduced these costs to fractions of a basis point. For example, the EUR.USD currency pair trades with spreads as tight as 1/10 of a basis point, i.e. with just a 0.00001 difference between the bid and offer price, so &quot;a tax on transactions in foreign exchange markets imposed unilaterally, 6/1000 of a basis point (or 0.00006%) is a realistic maximum magnitude.&quot; Similarly Shvedov (2004) concludes that &quot;even making the unrealistic assumption that the rate of 0.00006% causes no reduction of trading volume, the tax on foreign currency exchange transactions would yield just $4.3 billion a year, despite an annual turnover in dozens of trillion dollars.&quot;

Accordingly, one of the modern Tobin tax versions, called the &quot;Sterling Stamp Duty&quot;, sponsored by certain UK charities, has a rate of 0.005% &quot;in order to avoid market distortions&quot;, i.e., 1/100 of what Tobin himself envisaged in 2001. Sterling Stamp Duty supporters argue that this tax rate would not adversely affect currency markets and could still raise large sums of money.

The same rate of 0.005% was proposed for a currency transactions tax (CTT) in a report prepared by Rodney Schmidt for The North-South Institute (a Canadian NGO whose &quot;research supports global efforts to [..] improve international financial systems and institutions&quot;). Schmidt (2007) used the observed negative relationship between bid–ask spreads and transactions volume in foreign exchange markets to estimate the maximum &quot;non-disruptive rate&quot; of a currency transaction tax. A CTT tax rate designed with a pragmatic goal of raising revenue for various development projects, rather than to fulfill Tobin&#x27;s original goals (of &quot;slowing the flow of capital across borders&quot; and &quot;preventing or managing exchange rate crises&quot;), should avoid altering the existing &quot;fundamental market behavior&quot;, and thus, according to Schmidt, must not exceed 0.00005, i.e., the observed levels of currency transaction costs (bid-ask spreads).

The mathematician Paul Wilmott has pointed out that while perhaps some trading ought to be discouraged, trading for the hedging of derivatives is generally considered a good thing in that it can reduce risk, and this should not be punished. He estimates that any financial tax should be at most one basis point so as to have negligible effect on hedging.

Assuming that all currency market participants incur the same maximum level of transaction costs (the full cost of the bid-ask spread), as opposed to earning them in their capacity of market makers, and assuming that no untaxed substitutes exist for spot currency markets transactions (such as currency futures and currency exchange-traded funds), Schmidt (2007) finds that a CTT rate of 0.00005 would be nearly volume-neutral, reducing foreign exchange transaction volumes by only 14%. Such volume-neutral CTT tax would raise &quot;relatively little revenue&quot; though, estimated at around $33 bn annually, i.e., an order of magnitude less than the &quot;carbon tax [which] has by far the greatest revenue-raising potential, estimated at $130-750 bn annually.&quot; The author warns however that both these market-based revenue estimates &quot;are necessarily speculative&quot;, and he has more confidence in the revenue-raising potential of &quot;The International Finance Facility (IFF) and International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm).&quot;

===Is the tax easy to avoid===

====Technical feasibility====
Although Tobin had said his own tax idea was unfeasible in practice, Joseph Stiglitz, former Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of the World Bank, said, on October 5, 2009, that modern technology meant that was no longer the case. Stiglitz said, the tax is &quot;much more feasible today&quot; than a few decades ago, when Tobin recanted.

However, on November 7, 2009, at the G20 finance ministers summit in Scotland, Dominique Strauss-Khan, head of the International Monetary Fund, said &quot;transactions are very difficult to measure and so it&#x27;s very easy to avoid a transaction tax.&quot;

Nevertheless, in early December 2009, economist Stephany Griffith-Jones agreed that the &quot;greater centralisation and automisation of the exchanges and banks clearing and settlements systems ... makes avoidance of payment more difficult and less desirable.&quot;

In January 2010, feasibility of the tax was supported and clarified by researcher Rodney Schmidt, who noted &quot;it is technically easy to collect a financial tax from exchanges ... transactions taxes can be collected by the central counterparty at the point of the trade, or automatically in the clearing or settlement process.&quot; (All large-value financial transactions go through three steps. First dealers agree to a trade; then the dealers&#x27; banks match the two sides of the trade through an electronic central clearing system; and finally, the two individual financial instruments are transferred simultaneously to a central settlement system. Thus a tax can be collected at the few places where all trades are ultimately cleared or settled.)

Based on digital technology, a new form of taxation, levied on bank transactions, was successfully used in Brazil from 1993 to 2007 and proved to be evasion-proof, more efficient and less costly than orthodox tax models. In his book, &quot;Bank transactions: pathway to the single tax ideal&quot;, Marcos Cintra carries out a qualitative and quantitative in-depth comparison of the efficiency, equity and compliance costs of a bank transactions tax relative to orthodox tax systems, and opens new perspectives for the use of modern banking technology in tax reform across the world.

====How many nations are needed to make it feasible?====
In the year 2000, &quot;eighty per cent of foreign-exchange trading [took] place in just seven cities. Agreement [to implement the tax] by [just three cities,] London, New York and Tokyo alone, would capture 58 per cent of speculative trading.&quot;

==Evaluating the Tobin tax as a general Financial Transaction Tax (FTT)==
===Sweden&#x27;s experience in implementing Tobin taxes===
In July, 2006, analyst Marion G. Wrobel examined the actual international experiences of various countries in implementing financial transaction taxes. Wrobel&#x27;s paper highlighted the Swedish experience with financial transaction taxes. In January 1984, Sweden introduced a 0.5% tax on the purchase or sale of an equity security. Thus a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction resulted in a 1% tax. In July 1986 the rate was doubled. In January 1989, a considerably lower tax of 0.002% on fixed income securities was introduced for a security with a maturity of 90 days or less. On a bond with a maturity of five years or more, the tax was 0.003%.

The revenues from taxes were disappointing; for example, revenues from the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million. In addition, as taxable trading volumes fell, so did revenues from capital gains taxes, entirely offsetting revenues from the equity transactions tax that had grown to 4,000 million Swedish kronor by 1988.

On the day that the tax was announced, share prices fell by 2.2%. But there was leakage of information prior to the announcement, which might explain the 5.35% price decline in the 30 days prior to the announcement. When the tax was doubled, prices again fell by another 1%. These declines were in line with the capitalized value of future tax payments resulting from expected trades. It was further felt that the taxes on fixed-income securities only served to increase the cost of government borrowing, providing another argument against the tax.

Even though the tax on fixed-income securities was much lower than that on equities, the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared. On 15 April 1990, the tax on fixed-income securities was abolished. In January 1991 the rates on the remaining taxes were cut in half and by the end of the year they were abolished completely. Once the taxes were eliminated, trading volumes returned and grew substantially in the 1990s.

====Tobin tax proponents reaction to the Swedish experience====
The Swedish experience of a transaction tax was with purchase or sale of equity securities, fixed income securities and derivatives. In global international currency trading, however, the situation could, some argue, look quite different.

Wrobel&#x27;s studies do not address the global economy as a whole, as James Tobin did when he spoke of &quot;the nineties&#x27; crises in Mexico, South East Asia and Russia,&quot; which included the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, and the 1998 Russian financial crisis.

===Pros and cons if the Tobin tax (FTT) were implemented?===
====Views of ABAC ====
The APEC Business Advisory Council, the business representatives&#x27; body in APEC, which is the forum for facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region, expressed its views in a letter to the IMF on 15 February 2010.

In addition, ABAC expressed further concerns in the letter:

* Key to the APEC agenda is reduction of transaction costs. The proposal is directly counterproductive to this goal.
* It would have a very significant negative impact on real economic recovery, as these additional costs are likely to further reduce financing of business activities at a time when markets remain fragile and prospects for the global economy are still uncertain.
* Industries and consumers as a whole would be unfairly penalized.
* It would further weaken financial markets and reduce the liquidity, particularly in the case of illiquid assets.
* Effective implementation would be virtually impossible, especially as opportunities for cross-border arbitrage arise from decisions of certain jurisdictions not to adopt the tax or to exempt particular activities.
* There is no global consensus why a tax is needed and what the revenue would be used for, and therefore no understanding how much is needed. Any consequential tax would need to be supported by clear consensus for its application.

Note - APEC&#x27;s 21 Member Economies are Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, People&#x27;s Republic of China, Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, The Republic of the Philippines, The Russian Federation, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, United States of America, Vietnam.

====Views of the ITUC/APLN====
The International Trade Union Confederation/Asia-Pacific Labour Network (ITUC/APLN), the informal trade union body of the Asia-Pacific, supported the Tobin Tax in their Statement to the 2010 APEC Economic Leaders Meeting. The representatives of APEC&#x27;s national trade unions centers also met with the Japanese Prime Minister, Naoto Kan, the host Leader of APEC for 2010, and called for the Prime Minister&#x27;s support on the Tobin Tax.

The ITUC shares its support for Tobin Tax with the Trade Union Advisory Council (TUAC), the official OECD trade union body, in a research on the feasibility, strengths and weaknesses of a potential Tobin Tax. ITUC, APLN and TUAC refer to Tobin Tax as the Financial Transactions Tax.

====Regular investors loss====
An economist speaking out against the common belief that investment banks would bear the burden of a Tobin tax is Simon Johnson, Professor of Economics at the MIT and a former Chief Economist at the IMF, who in a BBC Radio 4 interview discussing banking system reforms presented his views on the Tobin tax.

=====Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Bill=====
In 2009, U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio of Oregon proposed a financial transaction tax in his &quot;Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Bill&quot;. (This was proposed domestically for the United States only.)

====Would there be net job losses if a FTT tax was introduced?====
Schwabish (2005) examined the potential effects of introducing a stock transaction (or &quot;transfer&quot;) tax in a single city (New York) on employment not only in the securities industry, but also in the supporting industries. A financial transactions tax would lead to job losses also in non-financial sectors of the economy through the so-called multiplier effect forwarding in a magnified form any taxes imposed on Wall Street employees through their reduced demand to their suppliers and supporting industries. The author estimated the ratios of financial- to non-financial job losses of between 10:1 to 10:4, that is &quot;a 10 percent decrease in securities industry employment would depress employment in the retail, services, and restaurant sectors by more than 1 percent; in the business services sector by about 4 percent; and in total private jobs by about 1 percent.&quot;

It is also possible to estimate the impact of a reduction in stock market volume caused by taxing stock transactions on the rise in the overall unemployment rate. For every 10 percent decline in stock market volume, elasticities estimated by Schwabish implied that a stock transaction (&quot;transfer&quot;) tax could cost New York City between 30,000 and 42,000 private-sector jobs, and if the stock market volume reductions reached levels observed by Umlauf (1993) in Sweden after a stock FTT was introduced there (&quot;By 1990, more than 50% of all Swedish trading had moved to London&quot;) then according to Schwabish (2005), following an introduction of a FTT tax, there would be 150,000-210,000 private-sector jobs losses in the New York alone.

The cost of currency hedges—and thus &quot;certainty what importers and exporters&#x27; money is worth&quot;—has nothing to do with volatility whatsoever, as this cost is exclusively determined by the interest rate differential between two currencies. Nevertheless, as Tobin said, &quot;If ... [currency] is suddenly withdrawn, countries have to drastically increase interest rates for their currency to still be attractive.&quot;

===Is there an optimum tax rate===
Financial transaction tax rates of the magnitude of 0.1%-1% have been proposed by normative economists, without addressing the practicability of implementing a tax at these levels. In positive economics studies however, where due reference was paid to the prevailing market conditions, the resulting tax rates have been significantly lower.

For instance, Edwards (1993) concluded that if the transaction tax revenue from taxing the futures markets were to be maximized (see Laffer curve), with the tax rate not leading to a prohibitively large increase in the marginal cost of market participants, the rate would have to be set so low that &quot;a tax on futures markets will not achieve any important social objective and will not generate much revenue.&quot;

===Political opinion===
Opinions are divided between those who applaud that the Tobin tax could protect countries from spillovers of financial crises, and those who claim that the tax would also constrain the effectiveness of the global economic system, increase price volatility, widen bid–ask spreads for end users such as investors, savers and hedgers, and destroy liquidity.

====Tobin tax proponents response to empirical evidence on volatility====
Lack of &quot;direct&quot; supporting evidence for stabilizing (volatility-reducing) properties of Tobin-style transaction taxes in econometric research is acknowledged by some of the Tobin tax supporters:

These Tobin tax proponents propose on &quot;indirect&quot; evidence in their favor, reinterpreting studies which do not deal directly with volatility, but instead with trading volume (with volume being generally reduced by transaction taxes, though it constitutes their tax base, see: negative feedback loop). This allows these Tobin tax proponents to state that &quot;some studies show (implicitly) that higher transaction costs might dampen price volatility. This is so because these studies report that a reduction of trading activities is associated with lower price volatility.&quot; So if a study finds that reducing trading volume or trading frequency reduces volatility, these Tobin tax supporters combine it with the observation that Tobin-style taxes are volume-reducing, and thus should also indirectly reduce volatility (&quot;this finding implies a negative relationship between [..] transaction tax [..] and volatility, because higher transaction costs will &#x27;ceteris paribus&#x27; always dampen trading activities).&quot; (Schulmeister et al., 2008, p. 18).

Some Tobin tax supporters argue that volatility is better defined as a &quot;long-term overshooting of speculative prices&quot; than by standard statistical definitions (e.g., conditional variance of returns) ) which are typically used in empirical studies of volatility.

The lack of empirical evidence to support or clearly refute the Tobin tax proponents&#x27; claim it will reduce &quot;excess&quot; volatility is due in part to a lack of an agreed definition of &quot;excess&quot; volatility that allows to be distinguished and formally measured.

====Should speculators be encouraged, penalized or dissuaded?====
The Tobin tax rests on the premise that speculators ought to be, as Tobin puts it, &quot;dissuaded.&quot; This premise itself is a matter of debate: &quot;See Speculation.&quot;

On the other side of the debate were the leaders of Germany who, in May 2008, planned to propose a worldwide ban on oil trading by speculators, blaming the 2008 oil price rises on manipulation by hedge funds. At that time India, with similar concerns, had already suspended futures trading of five commodities.

On December 3, 2009, US Congressman Peter DeFazio stated, &quot;The American taxpayers bailed out Wall Street during a crisis brought on by reckless speculation in the financial markets, ... This [ proposed financial transaction tax ] legislation will force Wall Street to do their part and put people displaced by that crisis back to work.&quot;

On January 21, 2010, President Barack Obama endorsed the Volcker Rule which deals with proprietary trading of investment banks and restricts banks from making certain speculative kinds of investments if they are not on behalf of their customers. Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, President Obama&#x27;s advisor, has argued that such speculation played a key role in the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

Volcker endorsed only the UK&#x27;s tax on bank bonuses, calling it &quot;interesting&quot;, but was wary about imposing levies on financial market transactions, because he is &quot;instinctively opposed&quot; to any tax on financial transactions.

===Questions of volatility===
In February 2010, Tim Harford, writing in the Undercover Economist column of the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, commented directly on the claims of Keynes and Tobin that &#x27;taxes on financial transactions would reduce financial volatility&#x27;.

==Comparing Currency Transaction Taxes (CTT) and Financial Transaction Taxes (FTT)==
===Research evidence===
In 2003, researchers like Aliber et al. proposed that empirical evidence on the observed effects of the already introduced and abolished stock transaction taxes and a hypothetical CTT (Tobin) can probably be treated &quot;interchangeably.&quot; They did not find any evidence on the differential effects of introducing or removing, stock transactions taxes or a hypothetical currency (Tobin) tax on any subset of markets or all markets.

Researchers have used models belonging to the GARCH family to describe both the volatility behavior of stock market returns and the volatility behavior of foreign exchange rates. This is used as evidence that the similarity between currencies and stocks in the context of a tax designed to curb volatility such as a CTT (or FTT in general) can be inferred from the almost identical (statistically indistinguishable) behavior of the volatilities of equity and exchange rate returns.

===Practical considerations===
Hanke et al. state, &quot;The economic consequences of introducing a [currency-only] Tobin Tax are [...] completely unknown, as such a tax has not been introduced on any real foreign exchange market so far&quot;. At the same time, even in the case of stock transaction taxes, where some empirical evidence is available, researchers warn that &quot;it is hazardous to generalize limited evidence when debating important policy issues such as the transaction taxes&quot;.

According to Stephan Schulmeister, Margit Schratzenstaller, and Oliver Picek (2008), from the practical viewpoint it is no longer possible to introduce a non-currency transactions tax (even if foreign exchange transactions were formally exempt) since the advent of currency derivatives and currency exchange-traded funds. All of these would have to be taxed together under a &quot;non-currency&quot; financial transactions tax (such as under certain proposals in the U.S. in 2009 which, although not intending to tax currencies directly, would still do so due to taxation of currency futures and currency exchange traded funds). Because these three groups of instruments are nearly perfect substitutes, if at least one of these groups were to be exempt, it would likely attract most market volume from the taxed alternatives.

According to Stephan Schulmeister, Margit Schratzenstaller, and Oliver Picek (2008), restricting the financial transactions tax to foreign exchange only (as envisaged originally by Tobin) would not be desirable. Any &quot;general FTT seems...more attractive than a specific transaction tax&quot; (such as a currency-only Tobin tax), because it could reduce tax avoidance (i.e., substitution of similar untaxed instruments), could significantly increase the tax base and could be implemented more easily on organized exchanges than in a dealership market like the global foreign exchange market. (See also the discussion of tax avoidance as it relates to a currency transaction tax.)

On October 5, 2009, Joseph Stiglitz said that any new tax should be levied on all asset classes – not merely foreign exchange, and would be based on the gross value of the assets, thereby helping to discourage the creation of asset bubbles.

==Non-tax regulatory equivalent==
One non-tax regulatory equivalent of Tobin&#x27;s (very narrow original) tax is to require &quot;non-interest bearing deposit requirements on all open foreign exchange positions.&quot;. If these deposit requirements result in forfeits or losses if a currency suddenly declines due to speculation, they act as inhibitions against deliberate speculative shorts of a currency. However, they would not raise funds for other purposes, so are not a tax.

<doc id="31176" wikidata="Q1217234" url="?curid=31176" title="The Parent Trap (1961 film)">
<text>The Parent Trap is a 1961 American romantic comedy film written and directed by David Swift. It stars Hayley Mills (in a dual role) as a pair of teenage twins plotting to reunite their divorced parents by switching places with each other. Maureen O&#x27;Hara and Brian Keith play the parents. Although the plot is very close to that of the 1945 film &quot;Twice Blessed&quot;, &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; is based on the 1949 German children&#x27;s novel &quot;Das doppelte Lottchen&quot; by Erich Kästner.

Produced by Walt Disney Productions, &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; was released on June 21, 1961, by Buena Vista Distribution. It grossed $25.1 million at the box office and was nominated for two Academy Awards. It was broadcast on television, and three television sequels followed the later adventures of the twins. The film was remade in 1998 with Lindsay Lohan. It was released on VHS, in digital stereo LaserDisc format (1986), and on DVD (2002). &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; was the second of six films Mills made for Disney.

== Plot ==
Teenagers Sharon McKendrick and Susan Evers meet at a girls summer camp. Their identical appearance causes jealousy, resentment, and a rivalry in which they continually get each other into trouble and disrupt camp activities. As punishment, they must spend the remainder of the camp season rooming and dining together in isolation. They overcome their mutual dislike when they realize that they are identical twin sisters, whom their parents, Mitch and Maggie, separated upon divorcing shortly after their birth. Eager to meet the parents from whom they were separated, they decide to cut their hair identically, coach each other on their lives, and switch places.

In Boston with their mother and grandparents, Susan poses as Sharon, while Sharon goes to Mitch&#x27;s California ranch as Susan. Sharon learns that Mitch is engaged to a beautiful and much younger woman, Vicky, who is interested only in Mitch’s money and intends to send Susan to boarding school after the wedding. The girls communicate by phone at night. Susan tells Sharon to break up the couple, but when that fails, Susan decides to end the charade. After a happy reunion, Maggie brings her to California. Mitch is upset by Maggie&#x27;s unexpected arrival, until he learns the truth and is reunited with both daughters. Vicky is jealous of Maggie, who is staying at the ranch.

The girls scheme to reunite their parents by recreating Maggie and Mitch&#x27;s first date. At first, the ex-spouses are drawn together, but then they argue over why they divorced. They make up before Maggie and Sharon are to leave the next morning, and Maggie wishes Mitch well with Vicky. To delay the return to Boston, the twins dress and act alike, so their parents cannot tell them apart. They refuse to reveal their identities unless the family takes a camping trip. Mitch and Maggie reluctantly agree, and Vicky, who loathes the outdoors, is furious. Maggie cajoles Vicky into taking her place &quot;so that Vicky can become better acquainted with the twins.&quot;

The twins take every opportunity to exploit Vicky&#x27;s hatred of camping, pulling a series of pranks on her. That night, the twins sneak into her tent and pour honey over Vicky&#x27;s feet and leave a small honey trail outside the tent. Vicki awakens the following morning to find two bear cubs licking the honey off her feet to which she has a tantrum over her hatred of the outdoors and the twins. She further says all the trouble she&#x27;s been through does not make marrying Mitch for his money worth it and storms off.

Back at the house, the twins apologize for their actions; Mitch accepts their apology and says they don&#x27;t have to discuss the situation anymore. Maggie and Sharon prepare to return to Boston the next day, with the twins now resigned to seeing each other only during visits and shuttling back and forth between parents. Later, Mitch tells Maggie everything he misses about her and their marriage. They realize that they still love each other. The film ends with their second wedding, with Susan and Sharon as their bridesmaids.

== Production ==
The source material, &quot;Das doppelte Lottchen&quot;, was discovered by Disney&#x27;s story editor Bill Dover, who recommended the studio buy it.

In March 1960 Disney announced that Hayley Mills would star in &quot;His and Hers&quot; to be written and directed by David Swift. Swift and Mills had just made &quot;Pollyanna&quot; for Disney. It was also known as &quot;Petticoats and Blue Jeans&quot; and was the first in a five-film contract Mills signed with Disney, to make one each summer.

Maureen O&#x27;Hara signed in June. She wrote in her memoirs that Disney offered her a third of her normal fee of $75,000 but that she held out for her quote and got it. O&#x27;Hara said her contract gave her top billing but that Disney decided to give that to Mills; she says this caused tension with the studio and was why she never worked with Disney again.

Production started in July under the title of &quot;We Belong Together&quot; and went until September.

The production used split screen technology to create the effect of Mills playing both girls, with Susan Henning acting as a body double as part of the filming process.

The film was shot mostly at various locales in California. The summer camp scenes were filmed at Bluff Lake Camp (then owned by the Pasadena YMCA, now by Habonim Dror&#x27;s Camp Gilboa) and the family camping scenes later in the movie at Cedar Lake Camp, both in the San Bernardino Mountains near the city of Big Bear Lake in Southern California. The Monterey scenes were filmed in various California locations, including millionaire Stuyvesant Fish&#x27;s ranch in Carmel and Monterey&#x27;s Pebble Beach golf course. The scenes at the Monterey house were shot at the studio&#x27;s Golden Oak Ranch in Placerita Canyon, where Mitch&#x27;s ranch was built. It was the design of this set that proved the most popular, and to this day the Walt Disney Archives receives requests for plans of the home&#x27;s interior design. In fact, there never was such a house; the set was simply various rooms built on a sound stage. Camp Inch was based on a real girls&#x27; camp called Camp Crestridge for Girls at the Ridgecrest Baptist Conference Center near Asheville, North Carolina.

In 1962, a year after Disney adapted &quot;Das doppelte Lottchen&quot; into &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;, Cyrus Brooks translated the German book into English as &quot;Lisa and Lottie&quot;, an edition still published in the United States and Canada.

In 2014, &quot;Das doppelte Lottchen&quot; was faithfully retranslated into English by Anthea Bell and republished in the United Kingdom and Australia by Pushkin Press as &quot;The Parent Trap,&quot; after the hit Disney film. Then in 2020, Australian actress Ruby Rees recorded an unabridged narration of Bell&#x27;s translation for Bolinda.

== Musical numbers ==
Richard and Robert Sherman provided the songs, which, besides the title song &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;, includes &quot;For Now, For Always&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot;. &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot; (sung by Annette Funicello) is heard playing from a record player at the summer camp; the tune is reprised by the twins when they restage their parents&#x27; first date and that version is sung double-tracked by Hayley Mills (Hayley&#x27;s own single of the song, credited to &quot;Hayley Mills and Hayley Mills&quot;, reached #8 on the US charts). The film&#x27;s title song was performed by Tommy Sands and Annette Funicello, who were both on the studio lot shooting &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; at the time. The campers whistle the 1914 marching song, &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot;, as they march through camp, mirroring the scene from &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;.

== Reception ==
===Critical===
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;it should be most appealing to adults, as well as to children, because of the cheerfully persuasive dual performance of Hayley Mills&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; stated that the film was &quot;absolutely predictable from the outset&quot;, but was still &quot;a winner&quot; thanks to the performance of Mills, who &quot;seems to have an instinctive sense of comedy and an uncanny ability to react in just the right manner. Her contribution to the picture is virtually infinite&quot;. Charles Stinson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; declared it &quot;a comedy unusually well designed for the entire family — enough sight gags to keep the children screaming and enough clever dialogue to amuse their parents&quot;. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; graded the film as &quot;Very Good&quot; and Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;charmingly lively&quot; even though &quot;the terrain is familiar&quot;.

The film holds a score of 90% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews.

===Box office===
The film was a huge success at the box office. It grossed an estimated $9.3 million in the US.

== Accolades ==
The film was nominated for two Academy Awards: one for Sound by Robert O. Cook, and the other for Film Editing by Philip W. Anderson. The film and its editor, Philip W. Anderson, won the inaugural 1962 Eddie Award of the American Cinema Editors.

== Subsequent developments ==

In 1961, a comic book version of the film was published, adapted, and illustrated by Dan Spiegle.

The film was theatrically re-released in 1968 and earned $1.8 million in rentals.

The Disney Studios produced three television sequels &quot;The Parent Trap II&quot; (1986), &quot;Parent Trap III&quot; (1989) and &quot;Parent Trap: Hawaiian Honeymoon&quot; (1989). The original was remade in 1998 starring Lindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, and Natasha Richardson. Joanna Barnes also made an appearance as Vicki Blake, the mother of Dennis Quaid&#x27;s character&#x27;s fiancée, Meredith.

In 2018, a potential remake of &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; was considered for Walt Disney Studios&#x27; streaming service Disney+.

In India, there have been several films inspired by &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;. In 1965, a Tamil language version of the story called &quot;Kuzhandaiyum Deivamum&quot;, starring Kutty Padmini was released. The following year, it was remade into Telugu as &quot;Leta Manasulu&quot; also starring Kutty Padmini. A Hindi version &quot;Do Kaliyaan&quot; starring Neetu Singh in the double role was made in 1968. The 1987 film &quot;Pyar Ke Kabil&quot; also has a similar storyline, as does the 2001 film &quot;Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi&quot; which has Kajol playing the double role of 23-year-old twins.

== Home media ==
&quot;The Parent Trap&quot; was initially released by Walt Disney Home Video through VHS on April 7, 1984, and on May 28, 1986, as part of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Wonderland Campaign&quot;.

The film was released on a 2-disc special edition DVD in May 2002, as part of the Vault Disney collection, with a new digital remaster by THX.

In 2005, the film was once again released in a 2-Movie Collection, which also contained the made-for-television sequel, &quot;The Parent Trap II&quot; (1986), plus the original film trailer and other bonus features.

The film was released for the first time on Blu-ray, but as a Disney Movie Club exclusive on April 24, 2018. The 1998 remake was also released on Blu-ray the same day.

<text>The Torpoint Ferry is a car and pedestrian chain ferry connecting the A374 which crosses the Hamoaze, a stretch of water at the mouth of the River Tamar, between Devonport in Plymouth and Torpoint in Cornwall. The service was established in 1791 and chain ferry operations were introduced by James Meadows Rendel in 1832.

==Current operations==
The route is currently served by three ferries, built by Ferguson Shipbuilders Ltd at Port Glasgow and named after three rivers in the area: &quot;Tamar II&quot;, &quot;Lynher II&quot; and &quot;Plym II&quot;. Each ferry carries 73 cars and operates using its own set of slipways and parallel chains, with a vehicle weight limit of . The ferry boats are propelled across the river by pulling themselves on the chains; the chains then sink to the bottom to allow shipping movements in the river. An intensive service is provided, with service frequencies ranging from every 10 minutes (three ferries in service) at peak times, to half-hourly (one ferry in service) at night. Services operate 24 hours a day, every day (including throughout Christmas and all other holiday periods), with service frequency never falling below half-hourly.

The ferries, along with the nearby Tamar Bridge, are operated by the Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry Joint Committee, which is jointly owned by Plymouth City Council and Cornwall Council.

Tolls are payable in the Torpoint to Devonport eastbound direction only, except for motorcyclists, who pay westbound only. The toll is £2.60 for cars and motorcycle riders are charged 40p; there is no additional charge for a pillion passenger. Frequent users can reduce the fare by half by purchasing top-ups online for a machine-readable windscreen-mounted digital payment tag, called TamarTag, which is also usable on the bridge. The toll increase of 50% in March 2010 was the first rise for nearly 15 years before a further increase in November 2019.

The ferry takes around 10 minutes as opposed to a 20-mile, 30-minute trip around the mainland; rush hour times differ.

===Technical information===
The fully loaded weight of each ferry is given as 1,000 tonnes, powered by up to three 12-litre diesel engines with generators feeding the two electric motors each driving its chainwheel of nearly 2 m diameter. Normally one generator suffices; the extra two provide redundancy and extra power in bad weather or for extra speed. Each chain is 650 m long and weighs 23 t. There are eight guiding pulleys per chain and rubbing plates where the chains enter and leave the hull. The chains are replaced every three years.

Unlike most chain ferries with the chain ends attached directly to the shores, the chains of the Torpoint ferries are attached with a system of falling weights and pulleys on each shore and for each ferry. This keeps a minimum tension of 3 tonnes force on each chain, but also a maximum tension of this amount, plus some friction, as long as the weights are free to fall and rise in their pits.

==History==

A ferry route between Torpoint and Plymouth Dock (now called Devonport) was created by an act of Parliament, the (30 Geo. 3. c. 61) and the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe began to run ferries the following year. In 1826 the ferry operations were taken over by the Torpoint Steamboat Company, which built landing piers on both sides of the Tamar. The company also built the steam ferry &quot;Jemima&quot; which entered service in 1831. The steamer was unable to hold a course in the strong tidal flow of the Hamoaze, so it was soon withdrawn and the older ferryboats returned to service.

The steamboat company approached James Meadows Rendel in 1832 and asked him to design a steam-powered floating bridge for the route. Two ferries were built in 1834 and 1835 and provided a continuous service, operating in alternate months. The tolls varied between 2d for a horse and 5s for a coach with four horses, with a double fare charged on Sundays.

The original ferries were replaced by two new ferries built in 1871 and 1878. As a result of increasing traffic, the ferry company investigated twin ferry operations in 1905. Both the Admiralty and Devonport Corporation opposed this as the company would need to expand the landing beach in Devonport. An experimental two ferry service with the existing shore installations had to be abandoned due to the strain on the equipment. A supplementary steamer service was also introduced in 1902, with the &quot;Volta&quot; and &quot;Lady Beatrice&quot; linking Torpoint to two locations in Devonport on a triangular route.
Cornwall County Council acquired both the ferry and the steamers in 1922 for £42,000. The &quot;Volta&quot; was immediately sold for breaking and two new ferries were ordered, which entered service in 1925 and 1926. These were the first ferries on the route designed to carry motor vehicles and could carry 800 passengers and 16 cars. Land was acquired on both sides of the rivers to lay a second set of chains and expand the landing beaches. A third, reserve, ferry was ordered and modern shore facilities were also built and twin-ferry operation began in July 1932. These changes made the supplementary steamer redundant and the &quot;Lady Beatrice&quot; was sold.

In July 1923 it was reported that an Asian elephant, named Julia, a part of the Bostock and Wombwell Menagerie, had swum across the river after she had broken loose and &quot;launched herself from the ferry&quot;. She was encouraged to swim by her trainer who finally managed to loop a chain around her neck and she arrived safely at the other side.

Motor traffic using the route increased rapidly after World War II, and two new ferries with a capacity of 30 cars each were introduced by 1961. A third ferry entered service in 1966 and a marshaling area was built on the Torpoint foreshore, relieving congestion in the centre of Torpoint. The landing beaches were expanded further in 1972, allowing all three ferries to operate simultaneously. The three ferries were refitted in the 1980s and were stretched so that they could carry approximately 50 cars.
After the refit, they were named the &quot;Tamar&quot;, &quot;Lynher&quot; and &quot;Plym&quot;. These remained in service until 2005 when they were replaced by the current ferries.

All three ferries, &quot;Lynher&quot;, &quot;Plym&quot; and &quot;Tamar&quot;, were sold in 2004 for recycling by the company Smedegaarden located at Esbjerg in Denmark. They had the vessels towed across the North Sea and recycled in 2005.

In April 2022, a campaign pressure group known as the Tamar Toll Action Group was formed. Their stated goal is to seek an end to tolls on both Tamar crossings.

<text>Tarot (, first known as &quot;trionfi&quot; and later as tarocchi or tarocks) is a pack of playing cards, used from at least the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to play card games such as Tarocchini. From their Italian roots, tarot-playing cards spread to most of Europe, evolving into a family of games that includes German Grosstarok and modern games such as French Tarot and Austrian Königrufen. In the late 18th century French occultists made elaborate, but unsubstantiated, claims about their history and meaning, leading to the emergence of custom decks for use in divination via tarot card reading and cartomancy. Thus, there are two distinct types of tarot packs in circulation: those used for card games and those used for divination. However, some older patterns, such as the Tarot de Marseille, originally intended for playing card games, are also used for cartomancy.

Like the common playing cards, tarot has four suits that vary by region: French suits are used in western, central and eastern Europe, and Latin suits in southern Europe. Each suit has 14 cards: ten pip cards numbering from one (or Ace) to ten; and four face cards: King, Queen, Knight, and Jack/Knave/Page. In addition, and unlike standard packs, the tarot also has a separate 21-card trump suit and a single card known as the Fool. Depending on the game, the Fool may act as the top trump or may be played to avoid following suit. These tarot cards are still used throughout much of Europe to play conventional card games.

== Distribution ==
The use of tarot playing cards was at one time widespread across the whole of Europe except the British Isles and the Iberian Peninsula. Having fallen into decline by the 20th century, they later experienced a renaissance in some countries and regions. For example, French Tarot was largely confined to Provence in the 18th century, but took off in the 1950s to such an extent that, in 1973, the French Tarot Association (&quot;Fédération Française de Tarot&quot;) was formed and French Tarot itself is now the second most popular card game in France. Tarock games like Königrufen have experienced significant growth in Austria where international tournaments are held with other nations, especially those from eastern Europe that still play such games, including Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Denmark appears to be the only Scandinavian country that still plays tarot games, Danish Tarok being a derivative of historical German Grosstarock. The game of Cego has grown in popularity again in the south German region of Baden. Italy continues to play regionally popular games with their distinctive Tarot packs. These include: Ottocento in Bologna and Sicilian Tarocchi in parts of Sicily. Meanwhile Troccas and Troggu are still played locally in parts of Switzerland.

==History==

===Playing cards and early tarot-like games===
Tarot cards, then known as &quot;tarocchi&quot;, first appeared in Ferrara and Milan in northern Italy, with the Fool and 21 trumps (then called &quot;trionfi&quot;) being added to the standard Italian pack of four suits: batons, coins, cups and swords. Scholarship has established that the early European cards were probably based on the Egyptian Mamluk deck invented in or before the 14th century, which followed the introduction of paper from Asia into Western Europe. By the late 1300s, Europeans were producing their own cards, the earliest patterns being based on the Mamluk deck but with variations to the suit symbols and court cards.

The first records of playing cards in Europe date to 1367 in Bern and they appear to have spread very rapidly across the whole of Europe, as may be seen from the records, mainly of card games being banned. Little is known about the appearance and number of these cards, the only significant information being provided by a text by John of Rheinfelden in 1377 from Freiburg im Breisgau, who, in addition to other versions, describes the basic pack as containing the still-current 4 suits of 13 cards, the courts usually being the King, Ober and Unter (&quot;marshals&quot;), although Dames and Queens were already known by then.

An early pattern of playing cards used the suits of batons or clubs, coins, swords, and cups. These suits are still used in traditional Italian, Spanish and Portuguese playing card decks, and are also used in modern (occult) tarot divination cards that first appeared in the late 18th century.

A lost tarot-like pack was commissioned by Duke Filippo Maria Visconti and described by Martiano da Tortona, probably between 1418 and 1425 since the painter he mentions, Michelino da Besozzo, returned to Milan in 1418, while Martiano himself died in 1425. He described a 60-card deck with 16 cards having images of the Roman gods and suits depicting four kinds of birds. The 16 cards were regarded as &quot;trumps&quot; since, in 1449, Jacopo Antonio Marcello recalled that the now deceased duke had invented a &quot;novum quoddam et exquisitum triumphorum genus&quot;, or &quot;a new and exquisite kind of triumphs.&quot; Other early decks that also showcased classical motifs include the Sola-Busca and Boiardo-Viti decks of the 1490s.

===Early tarot decks===


The first documented tarot decks were recorded between 1440 and 1450 in Milan, Ferrara, Florence and Bologna, when additional trump cards with allegorical illustrations were added to the common four-suit pack. These new decks were called &quot;carte da trionfi&quot;, triumph cards, and the additional cards known simply as trionfi, which became &quot;trumps&quot; in English. The earliest documentation of &quot;trionfi&quot; is found in a written statement in the court records of Florence, in 1440, regarding the transfer of two decks to Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta.

The oldest surviving tarot cards are the 15 or so decks of the Visconti-Sforza Tarot painted in the mid-15th century for the rulers of the Duchy of Milan. In 15th century Italy, the set of cards that was included in tarot packs, including trumps, seems to have been consistent, even if naming and ordering varied. There are two main exceptions:

* Some late 15th century decks like the Sola Busca tarot and the Boiardo deck had four suits, a fool, and 21 trumps, but none of the trumps match tarot ones. They seem to have been made on the model of tarot decks, but were voluntary departures from an established standard.
* The Visconti di Mondrone pack, one of the Visconti-Sforza decks, originally had a Dame and a Maid in each suit, in addition to the standard King, Queen, Knight, and Jack. Additionally, the pack includes three trump cards which represent the theological virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity, and are not present in any other tarot deck of that era.

Although a Dominican preacher inveighed against the evil inherent in playing cards, chiefly because of their use in gambling, in a sermon in the 15th century, no routine condemnations of tarot were found during its early history.

===Propagation===
Because the earliest tarot cards were hand-painted, the number of the decks produced is thought to have been small. It was only after the invention of the printing press that mass production of cards became possible. The expansion of tarot outside of Italy, first to France and Switzerland, occurred during the Italian Wars. The most prominent tarot deck version used in these two countries was the Tarot of Marseilles, of Milanese origin.

While the set of trumps was generally consistent, their order varied by region, perhaps as early as the 1440s. Michael Dummett placed them into three categories. In Bologna and Florence, the highest trump is the Angel, followed by the World. This group spread mainly southward through the Papal States, the Kingdom of Naples, and finally down to the Kingdom of Sicily but was also known in the Savoyard states. In Ferrara, the World was the highest, followed by Justice and the Angel. This group spread mainly to the northeast to Venice and Trento where it was only a passing fad. By the end of the 16th century, this order became extinct. In Milan, the World was highest, followed by the Angel; this ordering is used in the Tarot of Marseilles. Dummett also wrote about a possible fourth lineage that may have existed along the Franco-Italian border. It spread north through France until its last descendant, the Belgian Tarot, went extinct around 1800.

In Florence, an expanded deck called &quot;Minchiate&quot; was later used. This deck of 97 cards includes astrological symbols and the four elements, as well as traditional tarot motifs. The earliest known mention of this game, under the name of &quot;germini&quot;, dates to 1506.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;tarot&quot; and German &quot;Tarock&quot; derive from the Italian &quot;Tarocchi&quot;, the origin of which is uncertain, although &quot;taroch&quot; was used as a synonym for foolishness in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The decks were known exclusively as &quot;Trionfi&quot; during the fifteenth century. The new name first appeared in Brescia around 1502 as &quot;Tarocho&quot;. During the 16th century, a new game played with a standard deck but sharing a very similar name (Trionfa) was quickly becoming popular. This coincided with the older game being renamed &quot;tarocchi&quot;. In modern Italian, the singular term is &quot;Tarocco&quot;, which, as a noun, is a cultivar of blood orange. The attribute &quot;Tarocco&quot; and the verb &quot;Taroccare&quot; are used regionally to indicate that something is fake or forged. This meaning is directly derived from the tarocchi game as played in Italy, in which &quot;tarocco&quot; indicates a card that can be played in place of another card.
== Playing card decks ==

The original purpose of tarot cards was to play games. A very cursory explanation of rules for a tarot-like deck is given in a manuscript by Martiano da Tortona before 1425. Vague descriptions of game play or game terminology follow for the next two centuries until the earliest known complete description of rules for a French variant in 1637. The game of tarot has many regional variations. Tarocchini has survived in Bologna and there are still others played in Piedmont and Sicily, but in Italy the game is generally less popular than elsewhere.

The 18th century saw tarot&#x27;s greatest revival, during which it became one of the most popular card games in Europe, played everywhere except Ireland and Britain, the Iberian peninsula, and the Ottoman Balkans. French tarot experienced another revival, beginning in the 1970s, and France has the strongest tarot gaming community. Regional tarot games—often known as &quot;tarock&quot;, &quot;tarok&quot;, or &quot;tarokk&quot;—are widely played in central Europe within the borders of the former Austro-Hungarian empire.

===Italian-suited decks===
Italian-suited decks were first devised in the 15th century in northern Italy. Three decks of this category are still used to play certain games:
* The Tarocco Piemontese consists of the four suits of swords, batons, cups and coins, each headed by a king, queen, cavalier and jack, followed by the pip cards for a total of 78 cards. Trump 20 outranks 21 in most games and the Fool is numbered 0 despite not being a trump.
* The Swiss 1JJ Tarot is similar, but replaces the Pope with Jupiter, the Popess with Juno, and the Angel with the Judgement. The trumps rank in numerical order and the Tower is known as the House of God. The cards are not reversible like the Tarocco Piemontese.
* The Tarocco Bolognese omits numeral cards two to five in plain suits, leaving it with 62 cards, and has somewhat different trumps, not all of which are numbered and four of which are equal in rank. It has a different graphical design than the two above as it was not derived from the Tarot of Marseilles.

===Italo-Portuguese-suited deck===
The Tarocco Siciliano is the only deck to use the so-called Portuguese suit system, which uses Spanish pips but intersects them like Italian pips. Some of the trumps are different such as the lowest trump, &quot;Miseria&quot; (destitution). It omits the Two and Three of coins, and numerals one to four in clubs, swords and cups: it thus has 64 cards, but the ace of coins is not used, being the bearer of the former stamp tax. The cards are quite small and not reversible.[9]

===Spanish-suited deck===
The sole surviving example of a Spanish-suited deck was produced around 1820 by Giacomo Recchi of Oneglia, Liguria and destined for Sardinia. The plain suit cards are copied from the Sardinian pattern designed just ten years earlier by José Martinez de Castro for Clemente Roxas in Madrid but with the addition of 10s and queens. The trumps are largely copied from an early version of the Tarocco Piemontese. At that time, Liguria, Sardinia, and Piedmont were all territories of the Savoyard state.

===French-suited decks===
French-suited tarot decks are known as the oldest decks used for the Tarot. With the exception of novelty decks, French-suited tarot cards are almost exclusively used for card games. The earliest French-suited tarot decks were made by the de Poilly family of engravers, beginning with a Minchiate deck by François de Poilly in the late 1650s. Aside from these early outliers, the first generation of French-suited tarots depicted scenes of animals on the trumps and were thus called &quot;Tiertarock&quot; (&quot;Tier&quot; being German for &quot;animal&quot;) appeared around 1740. Around 1800, a greater variety of decks were produced, mostly with genre art or veduta. The German states used to produce a variety of 78-card tarot packs using Italian suits, but later switching to French suited cards; some were imported to France. There remain only two French-suited patterns of Cego packs - the Cego Adler pack manufactured by ASS Altenburger and one with genre scenes by F.X. Schmid, which may reflect the mainstream German cards of the 19th century. Current French-suited tarot decks come in these patterns:

* – the &quot;Industrie und Glück&quot; (&quot;Diligence and Fortune&quot;) genre art tarock deck of Central Europe uses Roman numerals for the trumps. It is sold with 54 cards; the 5 to 10 of the red suits and the 1 to 6 of the black suits are removed. There are 3 patterns – Types A, B and C – of which Type C has become the standard, whereas Types A and B appear in limited editions or specials.
*&quot;Tarot Nouveau&quot; – also called the &quot;Tarot Bourgeois&quot; – has a 78-card pack. It is commonly used for tarot games in France and for Danish Tarok in Denmark. It is also sometimes used in Germany to play Cego. Its genre art trumps use Arabic numerals in corner indices.
* &quot;Adler-Cego&quot; – this is an animal tarot that is used in the Upper Rhine valley and neighbouring mountain regions such as the Black Forest or the Vosges It has 54 cards organized in the same fashion as the &quot;Industrie und Glück&quot; packs. Its trumps use Arabic numerals but within centered indices.
* &quot;Schmid-Cego&quot; - this pack by F.X. Schmid is of the Bourgeois Tarot type and has genre scenes similar to those of the &quot;Tarot Nouveau&quot;, but the Arabic numerals are centred as in the Adler-Cego pack.

=== German Tarock cards ===
From the late 18th century, in addition to producing their own true Tarot packs, the south German states manufactured German-suited packs labeled &quot;Taroc&quot;, &quot;Tarock&quot; or &quot;Deutsch-Tarok&quot;. These survive as &quot;Schafkopf/Tarock&quot; packs of the Bavarian and Franconian pattern. These are not true tarot packs, but standard 36-card German-suited decks for games like German Tarok, Bauerntarock, Württemberg Tarock and Bavarian Tarock. Until the 1980s there were also Tarock packs in the Württemberg pattern. There are 36 cards; the pip cards ranging from 6 to 10, Under Knave (&quot;Unter&quot;), Over Knave (&quot;Ober&quot;), King, and Ace. These use ace–ten ranking, like klaverjas, where ace is the highest followed by 10, king, Ober, Unter, then 9 to 6. The heart suit is the default trump suit. The Bavarian pack is also used to play Schafkopf by excluding the Sixes.


== Cartomancy ==

In English-speaking countries where these games are not widely played, only specially designed cartomantic tarot cards, used primarily for novelty and divination, are readily available. The early French occultists claimed that tarot cards had esoteric links to ancient Egypt, Kabbalah, the Indic Tantra, or I Ching, claims that have been frequently repeated by authors on card divination. However, scholarly research demonstrated that tarot cards were invented in northern Italy in the mid-15th century and confirmed that there is no historical evidence of any significant use of tarot cards for divination until the late 18th century. Historians have described western views of the Tarot pack as &quot;the subject of the most successful propaganda campaign ever launched [...] An entire false history and false interpretation of the Tarot pack was concocted by the occultists and it is all but universally believed.&quot;

The earliest evidence of a tarot deck used for cartomancy comes from an anonymous manuscript from around 1750 which documents rudimentary divinatory meanings for the cards of the Tarocco Bolognese. The popularization of esoteric tarot started with Antoine Court and Jean-Baptiste Alliette (Etteilla) in Paris during the 1780s, using the Tarot of Marseilles. French tarot players abandoned the Marseilles tarot in favor of the Tarot Nouveau around 1900, with the result that the Marseilles pattern is now used mostly by cartomancers.

Etteilla was the first to produce a bespoke tarot deck specifically designed for occult purposes around 1789. In keeping with the unsubstantiated belief that such cards were derived from the Book of Thoth, Etteilla&#x27;s tarot contained themes related to ancient Egypt.

In the occult tradition, tarot cards are referred to as &quot;arcana&quot;, with the Fool and 21 trumps being termed the Major Arcana and the suit cards the Minor Arcana, terms not used by players of tarot card games.

The 78-card tarot deck used by esotericists has two distinct parts:

* The Major Arcana (greater secrets) consists of 22 cards without suits. Their names and numbers vary, but in a typical scheme, the names are: 
** The Fool, The Magician, The High Priestess, The Empress, The Emperor, The Hierophant, The Lovers, The Chariot, Strength, The Hermit, Wheel of Fortune, Justice, The Hanged Man, Death, Temperance, The Devil, The Tower, The Star, The Moon, The Sun, Judgement, and The World. Cards from The Magician to The World are numbered in Roman numerals from I to XXI, while The Fool is the only unnumbered card, sometimes placed at the beginning of the deck as 0, or at the end as XXII.
* The Minor Arcana (lesser secrets) consists of 56 cards, divided into four suits of 14 cards each; 
**Ten numbered cards and four court cards. The court cards are the King, Queen, Knight and Page/Jack, in each of the four tarot suits. The traditional Italian tarot suits are swords, batons, coins and cups; however, in modern occult tarot decks, the suit of batons is often called wands, rods or staves; the suit of coins is often called pentacles or disks and the suit of cups is often referred to as goblets.

The terms &quot;Major Arcana&quot; and &quot;Minor Arcana&quot; were first used by Jean-Baptiste Pitois (also known as Paul Christian) and are never used in relation to tarot card games. Some decks exist primarily as artwork, and such art decks sometimes contain only the 22 Major Arcana.

The three most common decks used in esoteric tarot are the Tarot of Marseilles (a playing card pack), the Rider–Waite Tarot, and the Thoth Tarot.

Aleister Crowley, who devised the Thoth deck along with Lady Frieda Harris, stated of the tarot: &quot;The origin of this pack of cards is very obscure. Some authorities seek to put it back as far as the ancient Egyptian Mysteries; others try to bring it forward as late as the fifteenth or even the sixteenth century ... [but] The only theory of ultimate interest about the tarot is that it is an admirable symbolic picture of the Universe, based on the data of the Holy Qabalah.&quot;

<text>Thuban (), with Bayer designation Alpha Draconis or α Draconis, is a binary star system in the northern constellation of Draco. A relatively inconspicuous star in the night sky of the Northern Hemisphere, it is historically significant as having been the north pole star from the 4th to 2nd millennium BC.

Johann Bayer gave Thuban the designation Alpha and placed it as the only member of his &quot;secundae&quot; magnitude class in Draco, although its current apparent magnitude of 3.65 means it is 3.7 times fainter than the brightest star in the constellation, Gamma Draconis (Eltanin), which Bayer placed in his &quot;tertiae&quot; magnitude class although its current apparent magnitude is 2.24.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;α Draconis&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Alpha Draconis&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation.

The traditional name &quot;Thuban&quot; is derived from the Arabic word &quot;&quot; (&#x27;large snake&#x27; (e.g. a python or a legendary draconian serpent)). It is sometimes known as the &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Tail&quot; and as &quot;Adib&quot; . In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Thuban&quot; for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Right Wall of Purple Forbidden Enclosure&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Alpha Draconis, Kappa Draconis, Lambda Draconis, 24 Ursae Majoris, 43 Camelopardalis, Alpha Camelopardalis and BK Camelopardalis. Consequently, the Chinese name for Alpha Draconis itself is (, ), representing (), meaning &quot;Right Pivot&quot;.

== Visibility ==
Given good viewing conditions, Thuban is relatively easy to spot in the night sky, due to its location in relation to the Big Dipper (aka the Plough) asterism of Ursa Major. While it is well known that the two outer stars of the &#x27;dipper&#x27; point to the modern-day pole star Polaris, it is less well known that the two inner stars, Phecda and Megrez, point to Thuban, just 15 degrees of arc from Megrez. Thuban is not bright enough to be viewed from badly light-polluted areas.

=== Pole star ===

Due to the precession of Earth&#x27;s rotational axis, Thuban was the naked-eye star closest to the north pole from 3942 BC, when it superseded Tau Herculis as the pole star, until 1793 BC, when it was superseded by Kappa Draconis. It was closest to the pole in 2830 BC, when it was less than 10 arcminutes away from the pole. It remained within one degree of celestial north for nearly 200 years afterwards, and even 900 years after its closest approach, was just 5° off the pole. Thuban was considered the pole star until about 1800 BC, when the much brighter Beta Ursae Minoris (Kochab) began to approach the pole as well.

Having gradually drifted away from the pole over the last 4800 years, Thuban is now seen in the night sky at a declination of , RA . After moving nearly 47° off the pole by 10,000 AD, Thuban will gradually move back toward the north celestial pole. In 20,346 AD, it will again be the pole star, that year reaching a maximum declination of , at right ascension .

==Binary system==

Thuban is a single-lined spectroscopic binary. For a long time, only the primary star could be detected in the spectrum. The radial velocity variations of the stars can be measured and the pair have a somewhat eccentric orbit of 51.4 days. The secondary is a main-sequence star slightly cooler than the primary, with an A1 spectral class.

The secondary star was detected in high spatial resolution observations using the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer. The secondary star is 1.8 magnitudes (at 700 nm) fainter than the primary star and was detected at separations ranging from 6.2 to 2.6 milliarcseconds. Eclipses were detected using data obtained with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The presence of eclipses places Thuban into the class of binaries known as eclipsing binaries.

== Properties ==

Thuban has a spectral class of A0III, indicating its similarity to Vega in temperature and spectrum, but more luminous and more massive. It has been used as an MK spectral standard for the A0III type.

Thuban is not a main-sequence star; it has now ceased hydrogen fusion in its core. That makes it a white giant star, being 120 times more luminous than the Sun. It is 300 light-years away and its brightness is only decreased by 0.003 of a magnitude by intervening gas and dust.

<doc id="31182" wikidata="Q187550" url="?curid=31182" title="Toyotomi Hideyoshi">
<text>, otherwise known as and , was a Japanese samurai and &quot;daimyō&quot; (feudal lord) of the late Sengoku and Azuchi-Momoyama periods and regarded as the second &quot;Great Unifier&quot; of Japan. Although he came from a peasant background, his immense power earned him the rank and title of and , the highest official position and title in the nobility class. He was the first person in history to become a &quot;Kampaku&quot; who was not born a noble. He then passed the position and title of &quot;Kampaku&quot; to his nephew, Toyotomi Hidetsugu. He remained in power as , the title of retired &quot;Kampaku&quot;, until his death. It is believed, but not certain, that the reason he refused or could not obtain the title of , the leader of the warrior class, was because he was of peasant origin.

Hideyoshi rose from a peasant background as a retainer of the prominent lord Oda Nobunaga to become one of the most powerful men in Japanese history. Hideyoshi succeeded Nobunaga after the Honnō-ji Incident in 1582 and continued Nobunaga&#x27;s campaign to unite Japan that led to the closing of the Sengoku period. Hideyoshi became the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Japan and acquired the prestigious positions of &quot;daijō-daijin&quot; and &quot;kampaku&quot; by the mid-1580s. Hideyoshi launched the Japanese invasions of Korea in 1592 to initial success, but eventual military stalemate damaged his prestige before his death in 1598. Hideyoshi&#x27;s young son and successor Toyotomi Hideyori was displaced by Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 which would lead to the founding of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

Hideyoshi&#x27;s rule covers most of the Azuchi–Momoyama period of Japan, partially named after his castle, Momoyama Castle. Hideyoshi left an influential and lasting legacy in Japan, including Osaka Castle, the Tokugawa class system, the restriction on the possession of weapons to the samurai, and the construction and restoration of many temples, some of which are still visible in Kyoto.

== Early life (1537–1558) ==

Very little is known for certain about Toyotomi Hideyoshi before 1570, when he begins to appear in surviving documents and letters. His autobiography starts in 1577, but in it, Hideyoshi spoke very little about his past.

According to tradition, Hideyoshi was born on February 16, 1537, according to the lunar Japanese calendar (March 17, 1537, according to the Julian calendar; March 27, 1537 (Proleptic Gregorian calendar)) in Nakamura, Owari Province (present-day Nakamura Ward, Nagoya), in the middle of the chaotic Sengoku period under the collapsed Ashikaga Shogunate. Hideyoshi had no traceable samurai lineage, and his father Kinoshita Yaemon was an &quot;ashigaru&quot; – a peasant employed by the samurai as a foot soldier. Hideyoshi had no surname, and his childhood given name was (&quot;Bounty of the Sun&quot;) although variations exist. Yaemon died in 1543 when Hideyoshi was seven years old.

Many legends describe Hideyoshi being sent to study at a temple as a young man, but he rejected temple life and went in search of adventure. Under the name , he first joined the Imagawa clan as a servant to a local ruler named .

== Service under Nobunaga (1558–1582) ==

In 1558, Hideyoshi became an &quot;ashigaru&quot; for the powerful Oda clan, the rulers of his home province of Owari, now headed by the ambitious Oda Nobunaga.
Hideyoshi soon became Nobunaga&#x27;s sandal-bearer, a position of relatively high status. According to his biographers, Hideyoshi also supervised the repair of Kiyosu Castle, a claim described as &quot;apocryphal&quot;, and managed the kitchen. After Nobunaga noticed his talents at the Battle of Okehazama in 1560, when Nobunaga defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto, he became one of Nobunaga&#x27;s trusted retainers.

In 1561, Hideyoshi married One, the adopted daughter of Asano Nagakatsu, a descendant of Minamoto no Yorimitsu. Hideyoshi carried out repairs on Sunomata Castle with his younger half-brother, Hashiba Koichirō, along with Hachisuka Masakatsu, and Maeno Nagayasu. Hideyoshi&#x27;s efforts were well-received because Sunomata was in enemy territory, and according to legend Hideyoshi constructed a fort in Sunomata overnight and discovered a secret route into Mount Inaba, after which much of the local garrison surrendered.

In 1564, Hideyoshi found success as a negotiator. He managed to convince a number of Mino warlords to desert the Saitō clan, mostly with liberal bribes. This included the Saitō clan&#x27;s strategist, Takenaka Shigeharu.

Nobunaga&#x27;s easy victory at the siege of Inabayama Castle in 1567 was largely due to Hideyoshi&#x27;s efforts, and despite his peasant origins, in 1568 Hideyoshi became one of Nobunaga&#x27;s most distinguished generals, eventually taking the name . The new surname included two characters, one each from Oda&#x27;s right-hand men and , and the new given name included characters from and .

In 1570, Hideyoshi protected Nobunaga&#x27;s retreat from Azai-Asakura forces at Kanegasaki. Later, in June 1570, Nobunaga allied with Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Anegawa to lay siege to two fortresses of the Azai and Asakura clans, and Hideyoshi was assigned to lead Oda troops into open battle for the first time.

In 1573, after victorious campaigns against the Azai and Asakura, Nobunaga appointed Hideyoshi &quot;daimyō&quot; of three districts in the northern part of Ōmi Province. Initially, Hideyoshi stayed at the former Azai headquarters at Odani Castle, but moved to Kunitomo town and renamed it &quot;Nagahama&quot; in tribute to Nobunaga. Hideyoshi later moved to the port at Imahama on Lake Biwa, where he began work on Imahama Castle and took control of the nearby Kunitomo firearms factory that had been established some years previously by the Azai and Asakura. Under Hideyoshi&#x27;s administration, the factory&#x27;s output of firearms increased dramatically. Later, Hideyoshi participated in the 1573 siege of Nagashima.

In 1574, Hideyoshi and Araki Murashige captured Itami Castle, and later in 1575, he fought in the Battle of Nagashino against the Takeda clan.

In 1576, he took part in the Siege of Mitsuji, part of the eleven-year Ishiyama Hongan-ji War. Later, Nobunaga sent Hideyoshi to Himeji Castle to conquer the Chūgoku region from the Mori clan. Hideyoshi then fought in the Battle of Tedorigawa (1577), the siege of Miki (1578), the siege of Tottori (1581) and the siege of Takamatsu (1582).

=== Death of Nobunaga ===
On June 21, 1582, during the Siege of Takamatsu, Oda Nobunaga and his eldest son and heir Nobutada were both killed in the Honnō-ji incident. Their assassination ended Nobunaga&#x27;s quest to consolidate centralised power in Japan under his authority. Hideyoshi, seeking vengeance for the death of his lord, made peace with the Mōri clan and thirteen days later met Akechi Mitsuhide and defeated him at the Battle of Yamazaki, avenging his Nobunaga and taking Nobunaga&#x27;s authority and power for himself.

Meanwhile, the Hōjō clan and the Uesugi clan invaded Kai and Shinano province when they heard of Nobunaga&#x27;s death, beginning the Tenshō-Jingo war. When the Oda clan learned of the defeat of Takigawa Kazumasu at the Battle of Kanagawa by the Hōjō clan, Hideyoshi sent a letter to Ieyasu on July 7 giving him authorization to lead military operations to secure the two provinces from the Hōjō and Uesugi clans. As the war turned in Ieyasu&#x27;s favor and Sanada Masayuki defected to the Tokugawa side, the Hōjō clan negotiated a truce. Hōjō Ujinobu and Ii Naomasa were the Hōjō and Tokugawa representatives for the preliminary meetings. Representatives from the Oda clan such as Oda Nobukatsu, Oda Nobutaka, and Hideyoshi himself mediated the negotiation until the truce officially took effect in October with both Ieyasu and Hōjō Ujinao exchanging family members as hostages as a sign of goodwill.

== Rise to power (1582–1585) ==
=== Construction of Osaka Castle ===
In 1582, Hideyoshi began construction of Osaka Castle. Built on the site of the temple Ishiyama Hongan-ji, which was destroyed by Nobunaga, construction was completed in 1597. The castle would become the last stronghold of the Toyotomi clan after Hideyoshi&#x27;s death.

=== Conflict with Katsuie ===

In late 1582, Hideyoshi was in a very strong position. He summoned the powerful &quot;daimyō&quot; to Kiyosu Castle so that they could determine Nobunaga&#x27;s heir. Oda Nobukatsu and Oda Nobutaka quarreled, causing Hideyoshi to instead choose Nobunaga&#x27;s infant grandson Oda Hidenobu. Having won the support of the other two Oda clan elders, Niwa Nagahide and Ikeda Tsuneoki, Hideyoshi was able to distribute Nobunaga&#x27;s provinces among the generals and form a council of four generals to help Hidenobu govern.

Shibata Katsuie initially supported Hideyoshi&#x27;s decision, but later supported Nobunaga&#x27;s third son Nobutaka, for whom Katsuie had performed the genpuku ritual. He allied with Nobutaka and Takigawa Kazumasu against Hideyoshi. Tension quickly escalated between Hideyoshi and Katsuie, and at the Battle of Shizugatake in the following year, Hideyoshi destroyed Katsuie&#x27;s forces. Hideyoshi had thus consolidated his own power, dealt with most of the Oda clan, and now controlled some 30 provinces.

=== Conflict with Ieyasu ===
In 1584, Nobukatsu allied himself with Tokugawa Ieyasu, and the two sides fought at the inconclusive Battle of Komaki and Nagakute. This ultimately resulted in a stalemate, although Hideyoshi&#x27;s forces were delivered a heavy blow. Ieyasu and Hideyoshi never fought against each other in person, but the former managed to check the advance of the latter&#x27;s allies. After Hideyoshi and Ieyasu heard the news of Ikeda Tsuneoki and Mori Nagayoshi&#x27;s deaths, both withdrew their troops. Later, Hideyoshi made peace with Nobukatsu and Ieyasu, ending the pretext for war between the Tokugawa and Hashiba clans. However, Ieyasu continued to refuse to become Hideyoshi&#x27;s vassal. Hideyoshi began to move towards attacking Ieyasu, but just then the Tenshō earthquake occurred. Osaka suffered extensive damage, causing Hideyoshi to abandon the campaign against Ieyasu. Hideyoshi sent his younger sister Asahi no kata and mother Ōmandokoro to Tokugawa Ieyasu as hostages. In response, Ieyasu finally traveled to Osaka and expressed his intention to submit to Hideyoshi.

=== Toyotomi clan and Imperial Court appointment ===
Like Oda Nobunaga before him, Hideyoshi never achieved the title of &quot;shōgun&quot;. Instead, he arranged to have himself adopted by Konoe Sakihisa, one of the noblest men belonging to the Fujiwara clan, and secured a succession of high court titles. These included Chancellor (Daijō-daijin), and in 1585, the prestigious position of Imperial Regent (kampaku). Also in 1585, Hideyoshi was formally given the new clan name Toyotomi (instead of Fujiwara) by the Imperial Court. He built a lavish palace in 1587, the Jurakudai, and entertained the reigning Emperor Go-Yōzei the following year.

== Unification of Japan (1585–1592) ==

=== Negoro-ji Campaign ===

Also in 1585, Hideyoshi launched the siege of Negoro-ji and subjugated Kii Province. The Negoro-gumi, the warrior monks of Negoro-ji, were allied with the Ikkō-ikki and with Tokugawa Ieyasu, whom they supported in the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute the previous year. After attacking a number of other outposts in the area, Hideyoshi&#x27;s forces attacked Negoro-ji from two sides. Many of the Negoro-gumi had already fled to Ōta Castle by this time, which Hideyoshi later besieged. The complex was set aflame, beginning with the residences of the priests, and Hideyoshi&#x27;s samurai cut down monks as they escaped the blazing buildings.

=== Shikoku Campaign ===

In the 1585 invasion of Shikoku, Toyotomi forces seized Shikoku island, the smallest of Japan&#x27;s four main islands, from Chōsokabe Motochika. Toyotomi&#x27;s forces arrived 113,000 strong under Toyotomi Hidenaga, Toyotomi Hidetsugu, Ukita Hideie and the Mōri clan&#x27;s &quot;Two Rivers&quot;, Kobayakawa Takakage and Kikkawa Motoharu. Opposing them were 40,000 men of Chōsokabe&#x27;s. Despite the overwhelming size of Hideyoshi&#x27;s army, and the suggestions of his advisors, Motochika chose to fight to defend his territories. The battles culminated in the siege of Ichinomiya Castle, which lasted for 26 days. Chōsokabe made a half-hearted attempt to relieve his castle from the siege, but eventually surrendered. He was allowed to keep Tosa Province, while the rest of Shikoku was divided among Hideyoshi&#x27;s generals.

=== Toyama Campaign ===

During the late summer of August 1585, Hideyoshi launched an attack on Etchū Province and Hida Province. He dispatched Kanamori Nagachika to destroy the Anegakōji clan of Hida while Hideyoshi carried out the siege of Toyama Castle. The Toyama Castle garrison of 20,000, led by Hideyoshi&#x27;s former ally Sassa Narimasa, tried to defend against Hideyoshi&#x27;s 100,000 soldiers; in the end, Narimasa&#x27;s defense was shattered, opening the way for Toyotomi&#x27;s supremacy over Etchū Province and Hida Province.

=== Kyushu Campaign ===

In 1586 Hideyoshi conquered Kyūshū, wresting control from the Shimazu clan. Toyotomi Hidenaga, Hideyoshi&#x27;s half-brother, landed to the south of Bungo province on Kyūshū&#x27;s eastern coast. Meanwhile, Hideyoshi took his own forces down a more western route, in Chikuzen province. Later that year, with a total of 200,000 soldiers against the 30,000 men of the Shimazu forces, the two brothers met in Satsuma province. They besieged Kagoshima castle, the Shimazu clan&#x27;s home. The Shimazu surrendered, and Hideyoshi was able to return his attention to the Hōjō clan of Kantō, the last major clan to oppose him.

Later in 1587, Hideyoshi banished Christian missionaries from Kyūshū, either to exert greater control over the &quot;Kirishitan&quot; &quot;daimyō&quot; or to prohibit human trafficking. Around that time, at least 50,000 Japanese people were sold overseas as slaves, mainly by Portuguese merchants. However, since he did much trade with Europeans, individual Christians were unofficially overlooked.

=== Sword Hunt ===

In 1588, Hideyoshi forbade ordinary peasants from owning weapons and started a sword hunt to confiscate all weapons owned by peasants. The weapons were melted down into building material for the Hall of the Great Buddha at the Hōkō-ji temple in Kyoto, that was built by Hideyoshi. This measure effectively stopped peasant revolts, and ensured greater stability at the expense of freedom of the individual &quot;daimyō&quot;.

=== Odawara Campaign ===

In 1590, Hideyoshi carried out the Odawara Campaign against the Hōjō clan in the Kantō region. This was the first battle that involved the alliance between Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Hideyoshi&#x27;s army of 220,000 men surrounded Odawara Castle and its 82,000-strong Hōjō garrison, in what has been called &quot;the most unconventional siege lines in samurai history&quot;. The samurai were entertained by everything from concubines, prostitutes, and musicians to acrobats, fire-eaters, and jugglers. The defenders slept on the ramparts with their arquebuses and armor; despite their smaller numbers, they discouraged Hideyoshi from attacking. Hideyoshi had Ishigakiyama Ichiya Castle secretly constructed in a nearby forest, and then had the forest chopped down, giving the impression it have been built overnight. This demoralized the defenders, leading to their surrender three months after the start of the siege. During the siege, Hideyoshi offered Ieyasu the eight Hōjō-ruled provinces in the Kantō region, in exchange for the submission of Ieyasu&#x27;s five provinces, which Ieyasu accepted.

=== Death of Sen no Rikyū ===

In February 1591, Hideyoshi ordered Sen no Rikyū to commit suicide, likely in one of his angry outbursts. Rikyū had been a trusted retainer and master of the tea ceremony under both Hideyoshi and Nobunaga. Under Hideyoshi&#x27;s patronage, Rikyū made significant changes to the aesthetics of the tea ceremony that had a lasting influence over many aspects of Japanese culture. Even after Rikyū&#x27;s death, Hideyoshi is said to have built his many construction projects based upon aesthetics promoted by Rikyū.

Following Rikyū&#x27;s death, Hideyoshi turned his attention from tea ceremony to Noh, which he had been studying since becoming Imperial Regent. During his brief stay in Nagoya Castle in what is today Saga Prefecture, on Kyūshū, Hideyoshi memorised the &quot;shite&quot; (lead role) parts of ten Noh plays, which he then performed, forcing various &quot;daimyō&quot; to accompany him onstage as the &quot;waki&quot; (secondary, accompanying role). He even performed before the emperor.

=== Kunohe Rebellion ===

The Kunohe rebellion, an insurrection that occurred in Mutsu Province from March 13 to September 4, 1591, began when Kunohe Masazane, a claimant to daimyo of the Nanbu clan, launched a rebellion against his rival Nanbu Nobunao which spread across Mutsu Province. Nobunao was backed by Hideyoshi, who along with sent a large army into the Tōhoku region in mid-1591 which quickly defeated the rebels. Hideyoshi&#x27;s army arrived at Kunohe Castle in early September. Masazane, outnumbered, surrendered Kunohe Castle and was executed with the castle defenders. The Kunohe rebellion was the final battle in Hideyoshi&#x27;s campaigns during the Sengoku period and completed the unification of Japan.

== Taikō (1592–1598) ==
The future stability of the Toyotomi dynasty after Hideyoshi&#x27;s eventual death was put in doubt with the death of his only son, three-year-old Tsurumatsu, in September 1591. When his half-brother Hidenaga died of illness shortly after, Hideyoshi named his nephew Hidetsugu his heir, adopting him in January 1592. Hideyoshi resigned as &quot;kampaku&quot; to take the title of &quot;taikō&quot; (retired regent), and Hidetsugu succeeded him as &quot;kampaku&quot;.

Hideyoshi adopted Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s dream of a Japanese conquest of China, and launched the conquest of the Ming dynasty by way of Korea (at the time known as Koryu or Joseon).

In 1592, Hideyoshi began an invasion of Korea with the intent of conquering Korea and eventually Ming China. Hideoyoshi&#x27;s explicit war goal was for Japan to replace China at the top of the international order. Hideyoshi wrote to his adopted son Hidetsugu that &quot;it is not Ming China alone that is destined to be subjugated by us, but India, the Philippines, and many islands in the South Sea will share a like fate.&quot; 

=== First campaign against Korea ===
In the first campaign, Hideyoshi appointed Ukita Hideie as field marshal, and had him go to the Korean peninsula in April 1592. Konishi Yukinaga occupied Seoul, which was the capital of the Joseon dynasty of Korea, on June 19. After Seoul fell, Japanese commanders held a war council in June in Seoul and determined targets of subjugation called &quot;Hachidokuniwari&quot; literally, Eight(八) Route(道), Country(国) Division(割). Each targeted province was attacked by one of the army&#x27;s eight divisions:
* Pyeongan by the First Division led by Konishi Yukinaga.
* Hamgyong by the Second Division led by Katō Kiyomasa.
* Hwanghae by the Third Division led by Kuroda Nagamasa.
* Gangwon by the Fourth Division led by Mōri Katsunaga.
* Chungcheong by the Fifth Division led by Fukushima Masanori.
* Jeolla by the Sixth Division led by Kobayakawa Takakage.
* Gyeongsang by the Seventh Division led by Mōri Terumoto.
* Gyeonggi by the Eighth Division led by Ukita Hideie.

Within four months, Hideyoshi&#x27;s forces had a route into Manchuria and had occupied much of Korea. The Korean king Seonjo of Joseon escaped to Uiju and requested military intervention from China. In 1593, the Wanli Emperor of Ming China sent an army under general Li Rusong to block the planned Japanese invasion of China and recapture the Korean peninsula. On January 7, 1593, the Ming relief forces recaptured Pyongyang and surrounded Seoul, but Kobayakawa Takakage, Ukita Hideie, Tachibana Muneshige and Kikkawa Hiroie were able to win the Battle of Byeokjegwan north of Seoul, in modern day Goyang City. At the end of the first campaign, Japan&#x27;s entire navy was destroyed by Admiral Yi Sun-sin of Korea, whose base was located in a part of Korea the Japanese could not control. This destroyed Japan&#x27;s ability to resupply their troops in Seoul, effectively ending the invasion.

=== Succession dispute ===
Following Hideyoshi&#x27;s appointment of his nephew Hidetsugu to the position of &quot;kampaku,&quot; tensions started to develop due to the dual power structure between Hidetsugu, who led the court system, and Hideyoshi, who retained actual military power as retired regent. Although Hideyoshi orchestrated Hidetsugu&#x27;s rise, the regent&#x27;s position was governed by established court frameworks, limiting Hideyoshi&#x27;s ability to bypass precedents. This led to the formation of two factions: the &quot;&quot;Taiko&quot; (Hideyoshi&#x27;s) group&quot; and the &quot;&quot;Kampaku&quot; (Hidetsugu&#x27;s) group,&quot; which clashed over political and military issues.

The birth of Hideyoshi&#x27;s second son in 1593, Hideyori, exacerbated these tensions, as it introduced another potential heir to the Toyotomi dynasty. In July 1595, amidst suspicions of treason and the ongoing Korean invasion, Hidetsugu was stripped of his titles, exiled to Mount Kōya, and then ordered to commit suicide in August 1595. Hidetsugu&#x27;s family members who did not follow his example, including 31 women and several children, were then beheaded in Kyoto. In the aftermath, Hideyoshi solidified his authority by securing loyalty oaths, signed in blood, from magistrates and daimyos including influential damiyo like Tokugawa Ieyasu, Maeda Toshiie, Ukita Hideie, Mori Terumoto, and Kobayakawa Takakage.

=== Twenty-six martyrs of Japan ===
In January 1597, Toyotomi Hideyoshi had twenty-six Christians arrested as an example to Japanese who wanted to convert to Christianity. They are known as the Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan. They included five European Franciscan missionaries, one Mexican Franciscan missionary, three Japanese Jesuits and seventeen Japanese laymen including three young boys. They were tortured, mutilated, and paraded through towns across Japan. On February 5, they were executed in Nagasaki by public crucifixion.

=== Second campaign against Korea ===
After several years of negotiations, broken off because envoys of both sides falsely reported that the opposition had surrendered, Hideyoshi appointed Kobayakawa Hideaki to lead a renewed invasion of Korea. This invasion met with less success than the first; Japanese troops remained pinned down in Gyeongsang Province, and although the Japanese forces turned back several Chinese offensives in Suncheon and Sacheon in June 1598, they were unable to make further progress as the Ming army prepared for a final assault. While Hideyoshi&#x27;s battle at Sacheon led by Shimazu Yoshihiro was a major Japanese victory, all three parties to the war were exhausted. He told his commander in Korea, &quot;Don&#x27;t let my soldiers become spirits in a foreign land.&quot;.

== Death ==

Toyotomi Hideyoshi died at Fushimi Castle on September 18, 1598 (Keichō 3, 18th day of the 8th month). His last words, delivered to his closest &quot;daimyō&quot; and generals, were &quot;I depend upon you for everything. I have no other thoughts to leave behind. It is sad to part from you.&quot; His death was kept secret by the Council of Five Elders to preserve morale, and they ordered Japanese forces in Korea to return to Japan.

According to the &quot;Tokugawa Jikki&quot; record, Hideyoshi held a secret meeting with Koide Hidemasa and Katagiri Katsumoto where he shared his regret of launching invasions of Korea. Hideyoshi also instructed Hidemasa and Katsumoto to guide Hideyori into making an alliance with Ieyasu, as he predicted the power of the Tokugawa clan would grow unchecked after his death, and only solution for the Toyotomi clan to survive was to not oppose Ieyasu.

After Hideyoshi&#x27;s death, the other members of the Council of Five Elders were unable to keep Ieyasu&#x27;s ambitions in check. Two of Hideyoshi&#x27;s top generals, Katō Kiyomasa and Fukushima Masanori, had fought bravely during the war but returned to find the Toyotomi clan castellan Ishida Mitsunari in power. He held the generals in contempt, and they sided with Ieyasu. Hideyori lost the power his father once held, and Ieyasu&#x27;s power was consolidated when his Eastern Army defeated the Mitsunari&#x27;s Western Army at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Ieyasu, who was appointed as a shogun in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate, attacked Osaka Castle twice in 1614 and 1615 (the Siege of Osaka), forcing Hideyoshi&#x27;s concubine Yodo-dono and Hideyori to commit suicide, destroying the Toyotomi clan.

It is now believed that Hideyoshi&#x27;s loss of all his adult heirs, leaving only the five-year-old Hideyori as his successor, was the primary reason for the weakening of the Toyotomi regime and its eventual downfall.

== Cultural legacy ==
Toyotomi Hideyoshi changed Japanese society in many ways. These include the imposition of a rigid class structure, restrictions on travel, and surveys of land and production.

Class reforms affected commoners and warriors. During the Sengoku period, it had become common for peasants to become warriors, or for samurai to farm due to the constant uncertainty caused by the lack of centralised government and always tentative peace. Upon taking control, Hideyoshi decreed that all peasants be disarmed completely. Conversely, he required samurai to leave the land and take up residence in the castle towns. This solidified the social class system for the next 300 years.

Furthermore, he ordered comprehensive surveys and a complete census of Japan. Once this was done and all citizens were registered, he required all Japanese to stay in their respective &quot;han&quot; (fiefs) unless they obtained official permission to go elsewhere. This ensured order in a period when bandits still roamed the countryside and peace was still new. The land surveys formed the basis for systematic taxation.

In 1590, Hideyoshi completed construction of the Osaka Castle, the largest and most formidable in all Japan, to guard the western approaches to Kyoto. In that same year, Hideyoshi banned &quot;unfree labour&quot; or slavery in Japan, but forms of contract and indentured labour persisted alongside the period penal codes&#x27; forced labour.

Hideyoshi also influenced the material culture of Japan. He lavished time and money on the Japanese tea ceremony, collecting implements, sponsoring lavish social events, and patronizing acclaimed masters. As interest in the tea ceremony rose among the ruling class, so too did the demand for fine ceramic implements, and during the course of the Korean campaigns, not only were large quantities of prized ceramic ware confiscated but many Korean artisans were forcibly relocated to Japan. Hideyoshi also had a long relationship with tea master Sen no Rikyū, which eventually soured leading to Hideyoshi ordering Sen no Rikyū to commit suicide. The exact reason is disputed.

Inspired by the dazzling Golden Pavilion in Kyoto, he had the Golden Tea Room constructed, which was covered with gold leaf and lined inside with red gossamer. Using this mobile innovation, he was able to practice the tea ceremony wherever he went, displaying his power and status at all times.

Politically, he set up a governmental system that balanced out the most powerful Japanese warlords (or &quot;daimyō&quot;). A council was created to include the most influential lords. At the same time, a regent was designated to be in command.

Just before his death, Hideyoshi hoped to set up a system stable enough to survive until his son grew old enough to become the next leader. A was formed, consisting of the five most powerful &quot;daimyō&quot;. Following the death of Maeda Toshiie, however, Tokugawa Ieyasu began to secure alliances, including political marriages (which had been forbidden by Hideyoshi). Eventually, the pro-Toyotomi forces fought against the Tokugawa in the Battle of Sekigahara. Ieyasu won and received the title of &quot;Seii-Tai Shōgun&quot; two years later.

Hideyoshi is commemorated at several Toyokuni Shrines scattered over Japan.

Ieyasu left in place the majority of Hideyoshi&#x27;s decrees and built his shogunate upon them. This ensured that Hideyoshi&#x27;s cultural legacy remained. In a letter to his wife, Hideyoshi wrote:
The area of Taikō in Nagoya is named after him. The main street is Taikō-dōri, which is served by the subway Taiko-dori Station.

== Names ==
Hideyoshi was born to a low status family and from there he rose through Japan&#x27;s social ranks to receive the highest title of the imperial nobility, that of Imperial Regent. Hideyoshi&#x27;s climb upwards through the ranks of Japanese society resulted in his bearing several names throughout his life. At birth, he was given the name . At &quot;genpuku&quot;, he took the name . Later, he was given the surname Hashiba and the honorary court office &quot;Chikuzen no Kami&quot;; as a result, he was styled . His surname remained Hashiba even as he was granted the new &quot;Uji&quot; or &quot;sei&quot; ( or , clan name) Toyotomi by the Emperor.

The Toyotomi &quot;Uji&quot; was simultaneously granted to a number of Hideyoshi&#x27;s chosen allies, who adopted the new &quot;Uji&quot; &quot;&quot; (Toyotomi no ason, courtier of Toyotomi).

His full name was in formal documents.

The Catholic sources of the time referred to him as (from and the honorific &quot;-dono&quot;) and &quot;emperor &quot; (from &quot;taikō&quot;, a retired &quot;kampaku&quot; (see Sesshō and Kampaku), and the honorific &quot;-sama&quot;).

Toyotomi Hideyoshi had been given the nickname Kozaru (小猿), meaning &quot;little monkey&quot;, from his lord Oda Nobunaga, because his facial features and skinny form resembled those of a monkey.

== In popular culture ==
=== Films ===
In the 1949 Mexican hagiographic film &quot;Philip of Jesus&quot;, Luis Aceves Castañeda plays a character corresponding to Hideyoshi but named &quot;Emperor Iroyoshi Taikosama&quot;.

In the 2009 Japanese historical fantasy film &quot;Goemon&quot;, Toyotomi Hideyoshi (played by Eiji Okuda) features as the principal antagonist to the film&#x27;s protagonist, Ishikawa Goemon. This is based on the tradition that Goemon was executed for his failed attempt to assassinate Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1594, but the film otherwise bears little resemblance to either historical events or the received tradition. In the film, Goemon murders Hideyoshi&#x27;s stand-in, avoids his execution by boiling (being replaced by an associate), succeeds in murdering Hideyoshi on a later occasion, and survives to intervene in the Battle of Sekigahara. Goemon is portrayed as the faithful retainer and avenger of Oda Nobunaga, unhistorically depicted as the victim of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. All of this is counter to historical facts; tradition credits Goemon with serving Nobunaga&#x27;s enemies the Miyoshi clan and his murderer, Akechi Mitsuhide, as well as with failed murder attempts on both Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

Hideyoshi is portrayed by actor/director Takeshi Kitano in his 2023 film &quot;Kubi&quot;.

=== Anime ===
In the Netflix anime series &quot;Great Pretender&quot; (2020), Hideyoshi is referenced many times by Laurent Thierry, one of the central protagonists of the series.

=== Documentary ===
In the Netflix documentary series &quot;Age of Samurai: Battle for Japan&quot; (2021), Hideyoshi is portrayed by Masami Kosaka. The show depicts his life and rise to power.

=== Television ===
Actor Naoto Takenaka portrays Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the 1996 NHK drama &quot;Hideyoshi&quot;, which shows his life from his time under Oda Nobunaga to his rise as a leader himself who helped to unify Japan. It earned an average TV rating of 30.5% running from January 7 – December 22, 1996. Additionally, actor Yukijirō Hotaru plays The Taikō (Nakamura Hidetoshi), a character based on Toyotomi Hideyoshi, in the 2024 miniseries &quot;Shōgun&quot;.
