<text>The Terminator is a 1984 American science fiction action film directed by James Cameron, written by Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd and produced by Hurd. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, a cybernetic assassin sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son will one day save mankind from extinction by Skynet, a hostile artificial intelligence in a post-apocalyptic future. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah. The screenplay is credited to Cameron and Hurd, while co-writer William Wisher Jr. received an &quot;additional dialogue&quot; credit.

Cameron devised the premise of the film from a fever dream he experienced during the release of his first film, &quot;Piranha II: The Spawning&quot; (1982), in Rome, and developed the concept in collaboration with Wisher. He sold the rights to the project to fellow New World Pictures alumna Hurd on the condition that she would produce the film only if he were to direct it; Hurd eventually secured a distribution deal with Orion Pictures, while executive producers John Daly and Derek Gibson of Hemdale Film Corporation were instrumental in setting up the film&#x27;s financing and production. Originally approached by Orion for the role of Reese, Schwarzenegger agreed to play the title character after befriending Cameron. Filming, which took place mostly at night on location in Los Angeles, was delayed because of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s commitments to &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; (1984), during which Cameron found time to work on the scripts for &quot;&quot; (1985) and &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986). The film&#x27;s special effects, which included miniatures and stop-motion animation, were created by a team of artists led by Stan Winston and Gene Warren Jr.

Defying low pre-release expectations, &quot;The Terminator&quot; topped the United States box office for two weeks, eventually grossing $78.3 million against a modest $6.4 million budget. It is credited with launching Cameron&#x27;s film career and solidifying Schwarzenegger&#x27;s status as a leading man. The film&#x27;s success led to a franchise consisting of several sequels, , comic books, novels and video games. In 2008, &quot;The Terminator&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

==Plot==

A cyborg assassin dubbed &quot;The Terminator&quot; is sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 Los Angeles. It resembles a human male and is programmed to hunt and assassinate a woman named Sarah Connor. Separately, a human soldier named Kyle Reese simultaneously arrives, intent on stopping the Terminator. After searching for addresses in a telephone directory, the Terminator systematically dispatches similarly-named women, as well as several other people it comes in close contact with, including Sarah&#x27;s roommate, Ginger, and her boyfriend, Matt. The Terminator eventually locates the actual Sarah at a local nightclub, where she is rescued by Reese during a mass shooting. The pair then steal a car and escape, with the Terminator pursuing them in a stolen police car.

As they hide in a parking lot, Reese explains to Sarah that an artificially intelligent defense network known as Skynet, created by Cyberdyne Systems, will soon become self-aware and trigger a global nuclear war to bring humankind to its extinction. Sarah&#x27;s future son, John, will rally the survivors and lead a successful resistance movement against Skynet and its mechanical forces. On the verge of the resistance&#x27;s victory, Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to murder Sarah, thereby preventing John&#x27;s birth. Reese additionally divulges that the Terminator has a perfect voice-mimicking ability and a durable metal endoskeleton covered by living tissue to appear human.

The Terminator tracks Reese and Sarah, however, it disappears after crashing during a car chase with the duo. The police apprehend Reese and Sarah. Sarah is notified of Ginger and Matt&#x27;s murder, while Reese is interrogated by Dr. Sielberman, a sceptical criminal psychologist. The Terminator breaks into a hotel room to perform self-repairs on its damaged eye and right arm, then arrives at the police station searching for Sarah, killing many officers in the process. Reese and Sarah run off, steal another car and take refuge in a motel, where they assemble several pipe bombs and plan their next move. Reese admits that he has adored Sarah since he saw her in John&#x27;s photograph and that he traveled through time out of love for her. Reciprocating his feelings, Sarah kisses him and they have sex, conceiving John.

The Terminator locates Sarah by intercepting a call intended for her mother. She and Reese escape the motel in a pickup truck while it pursues them on a motorcycle. In the ensuing chase, Reese is badly wounded by gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the Terminator. Sarah knocks the Terminator off its motorcycle but loses control of the truck, which flips over. The Terminator, now bloodied and badly damaged, hijacks a tank truck and attempts to run down Sarah. Reese manages to insert a pipe bomb into the truck&#x27;s hose tube, causing the truck to explode and reduce the Terminator to its endoskeleton. It pursues them into a Cyberdyne-owned factory, where Reese activates machinery to distract it, but it eventually discovers them. Reese then lodges his final pipe bomb into its midsection to blow it apart, but at the cost of his life. Its still-functional torso then pursues Sarah, but she manages to lure it into a hydraulic press that she uses to destroy it.

Months later, Sarah, visibly pregnant with John, travels through Mexico, recording audio tapes to pass on to him. At a gas station, a boy takes a polaroid photograph of her, the exact one that John will one day give to Reese, and she purchases it. The gas station owner remarks that a storm is coming and she notifies her awareness, alluding to humanity&#x27;s impending conflict against Skynet, before driving away towards it.

==Production==
===Development===

In Rome, Italy, during the release of &quot;Piranha II: The Spawning&quot; (1982), director James Cameron fell ill and had a dream about a metallic torso holding kitchen knives dragging itself from an explosion. Inspired by director John Carpenter, who had made the slasher film &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978) on a low budget, Cameron used the dream as a &quot;launching pad&quot; to write a slasher-style film. Cameron&#x27;s agent disliked the early concept of the horror film and requested that he work on something else. After this, Cameron dismissed his agent.

Cameron returned to Pomona, California, and stayed at the home of science fiction writer Randall Frakes, where he wrote the draft for &quot;The Terminator&quot;. Cameron&#x27;s influences included 1950s science fiction films, the 1960s fantasy television series &quot;The Outer Limits,&quot; and contemporary films such as &quot;The Driver&quot; (1978) and &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; (1981). To translate the draft into a script, Cameron enlisted his friend Bill Wisher, who had a similar approach to storytelling. Cameron gave Wisher scenes involving Sarah Connor and the police department to write. As Wisher lived far from Cameron, the two communicated ideas by phoning each other and recording phone calls of them reading new scenes.

The initial outline of the script involved two Terminators being sent to the past. The first was similar to the Terminator in the film, while the second was made of liquid metal and could not be destroyed with conventional weaponry. Cameron felt that the technology of the time was unable to create the liquid Terminator, and shelved the idea until the appearance of the T-1000 character in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991).

Gale Anne Hurd, who had worked at New World Pictures as Roger Corman&#x27;s assistant, showed interest in the project. Cameron sold the rights for &quot;The Terminator&quot; to Hurd for one dollar with the promise that she would produce it only if Cameron was to direct it. Hurd suggested edits to the script and took a screenwriting credit in the film, though Cameron stated that she &quot;did no actual writing at all&quot;. Cameron would later regret the decision to sell the rights for one dollar. Cameron and Hurd had friends who worked with Corman previously and who were working at Orion Pictures. Orion agreed to distribute the film if Cameron could get financial backing elsewhere. The script was picked up by John Daly, chairman and president of Hemdale Film Corporation. Daly and his executive vice president and head of production Derek Gibson became executive producers of the project.

Cameron wanted his pitch for Daly to finalize the deal and had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator. Henriksen, wearing a leather jacket, fake cuts on his face, and gold foil on his teeth, kicked open the door to the office and then sat in a chair. Cameron arrived shortly and then relieved the staff from Henriksen&#x27;s act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron&#x27;s sketches and passion for the film. In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion. &quot;The Terminator&quot; was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million. Aside from Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions, Euro Film Funding and Cinema &#x27;84 have been credited as production companies after the film&#x27;s release.

===Casting===
For the role of Kyle Reese, Orion wanted a star whose popularity was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orion co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for &quot;The Terminator&quot;. Cameron was uncertain about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as he felt he would need someone even more famous to play the Terminator. Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson both turned down the Terminator role. Medavoy suggested O. J. Simpson but Cameron did not feel that Simpson, at that time, would be believable as a killer.

Cameron agreed to meet with Schwarzenegger and devised a plan to avoid casting him; he would pick a fight with him and return to Hemdale and find him unfit for the role. Cameron was entertained by Schwarzenegger, who would talk about how the villain should be played, and began sketching his face on a notepad, asking Schwarzenegger to stop talking and remain still. After the meeting, Cameron returned to Daly saying Schwarzenegger would not play Reese but that &quot;he&#x27;d make a hell of a Terminator&quot;.

Schwarzenegger was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot;, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had, which belonged to the wardrobe for &quot;The Terminator&quot;. Schwarzenegger responded, &quot;Oh, some shit movie I&#x27;m doing, take a couple weeks.&quot; He recounted in his memoir, &quot;Total Recall&quot;, that he was initially hesitant, but thought that playing a robot in a contemporary film would be a challenging change of pace from &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; and that the film was low-profile enough that it would not damage his career if it were unsuccessful. In a later interview with &quot;GQ&quot;, he admitted that he and the studio regarded it as just another B action movie, since &quot;The year before came out &quot;Exterminator&quot;, now it was the Terminator and what else is gonna be next, type of thing&quot;. It was only when he saw 20 minutes of the first edit did he realize that &quot;this is really intense, this is wild, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen anything like this before&quot; and realized that &quot;this could be bigger than we all think&quot;. To prepare for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons to be able to use them and feel comfortable around them. Schwarzenegger speaks only 17 lines in the film, and fewer than 100 words. Cameron said that &quot;Somehow, even his accent worked ... It had a strange synthesized quality, like they hadn&#x27;t gotten the voice thing quite worked out.&quot;

Various other actors were suggested for the role of Reese, including rock musician Sting. Cameron met with Sting, but he was not interested as Cameron was too much an unknown director at the time. Others who were considered for Reese, included Christopher Reeve, Matt Dillon, Kurt Russell, Treat Williams, Tommy Lee Jones, Scott Glenn, Michael O&#x27;Keefe, and Bruce Springsteen. Cameron chose Michael Biehn. Biehn, who had recently seen &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and had aspirations about acting alongside the likes of Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Robert Redford, was originally skeptical, feeling the film was silly. After meeting with Cameron, Biehn changed his mind. Hurd stated that &quot;almost everyone else who came in from the audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this human connection between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. They have very little time to fall in love. A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off.&quot; To get into Reese&#x27;s character, Biehn studied the Polish resistance movement in World War II.

In the first pages of the script, Sarah Connor is described as &quot;19, small and delicate features. Pretty in a flawed, accessible way. She doesn&#x27;t stop the party when she walks in, but you&#x27;d like to get to know her. Her vulnerable quality masks a strength even she doesn&#x27;t know exists.&quot; Lisa Langlois was offered the role but turned it down as she was already shooting &quot;The Slugger&#x27;s Wife&quot;. Jennifer Jason Leigh, Melissa Sue Anderson, and Jessica Harper were also considered for the role of Sarah Connor. Cameron cast Linda Hamilton, who had just finished filming &quot;Children of the Corn&quot;. Rosanna Arquette and Lea Thompson also auditioned for the role. Cameron found a role for Lance Henriksen as Vukovich, as Henriksen had been essential to finding finances for the film. For the special effects shots, Cameron wanted Dick Smith, who had worked on &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. Smith did not take Cameron&#x27;s offer and suggested his friend Stan Winston.

===Filming===

Filming for &quot;The Terminator&quot; was set to begin in early 1983 in Toronto, but was halted when producer Dino De Laurentiis applied an option in Schwarzenegger&#x27;s contract that would make him unavailable for nine months while he was filming &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot;. During the waiting period, Cameron was contracted to write the script for &quot;,&quot; refined the &quot;Terminator&quot; script, and met with producers David Giler and Walter Hill to discuss a sequel to &quot;Alien,&quot; which became &quot;Aliens&quot;, released in 1986.

There was limited interference from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included the addition of a canine android for Reese, which Cameron refused, and to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted. To create the Terminator&#x27;s look, Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron&#x27;s original drawing in Rome. Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted reproductions of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster.

The sequences set in 2029 and the stop-motion scenes were developed by Fantasy II, a special effects company headed by Gene Warren Jr. A stop-motion model is used in several scenes in the film involving the Terminator&#x27;s endoskeleton. Cameron wanted to convince the audience that the model of the structure was capable of doing what they saw Schwarzenegger doing. To allow this, a scene was filmed of Schwarzenegger injured and limping away; this limp made it easier for the model to imitate Schwarzenegger.

One of the guns seen in the film and on the film&#x27;s poster was an AMT Longslide pistol modified by Ed Reynolds from SureFire to include a laser sight. Both non-functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created. At the time the movie was made, diode lasers were not available; because of the high power requirement, the helium–neon laser in the sight used an external power supply that Schwarzenegger had to activate manually. Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was promotional material for the film.

In March 1984, the film began production in Los Angeles. Cameron felt that with Schwarzenegger on the set, the style of the film changed, explaining that &quot;the movie took on a larger-than-life sheen. I just found myself on the set doing things I didn&#x27;t think I would do – scenes that were just purely horrific that just couldn&#x27;t be, because now they were too flamboyant.&quot; Most of &quot;The Terminator&quot;″s action scenes were filmed at night, which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise. A week before filming started, Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle, leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed. Hamilton&#x27;s ankle was taped every day and she spent most of the film production in pain.

Schwarzenegger tried to have the iconic line &quot;I&#x27;ll be back&quot; changed as he had difficulty pronouncing the word &quot;I&#x27;ll&quot;. Cameron refused to change the line to &quot;I will be back&quot;, so Schwarzenegger worked to say the line as written the best he could. He would later say the line in numerous films throughout his career.

After production finished on &quot;The Terminator&quot;, some post-production shots were needed. These included scenes showing the Terminator outside Sarah Connor&#x27;s apartment, Reese being zipped into a body bag, and the Terminator&#x27;s head being crushed in a press. The final scene where Sarah is driving down a highway was filmed without a permit. Cameron and Hurd convinced an officer who confronted them that they were making a UCLA student film.

===Music===

The &quot;Terminator&quot; soundtrack was composed and performed on synthesizer by Brad Fiedel. Fiedel was with the Gorfaine/Schwartz Agency, where a new agent, Beth Donahue, found that Cameron was working on &quot;The Terminator&quot; and sent him a cassette of Fiedel&#x27;s music. Fiedel was invited to a screening of the film with Cameron and Hurd. Hurd was not certain about having Fiedel compose the score, as he had only worked in television, not theatrical films. Fiedel convinced the two by showing them an experimental piece he had worked on, thinking that &quot;You know, I&#x27;m going to play this for him because it&#x27;s really dark and I think it&#x27;s interesting for him.&quot; The song convinced Hurd and Cameron to hire him.

Fiedel said his score reflected &quot;a mechanical man and his heartbeat&quot;. Almost all the music was performed live. &quot;The Terminator&quot; theme is used in the opening credits and appears in various points, such as a slowed version when Reese dies, and a piano version during the love scene. It has been described as &quot;haunting&quot;, with a &quot;deceptively simple&quot; melody recorded on a Prophet-10 synthesizer. It is in the unusual time signature of , which arose when Fiedel experimented with rhythms and accidentally created an incomplete loop on his sequencer; Fiedel liked the &quot;herky-jerky&quot; &quot;propulsiveness&quot;. Fiedel created music for when Reese and Connor escape from the police station that would be appropriate for a &quot;heroic moment&quot;. Cameron turned down this theme, as he believed it would lose the audience&#x27;s excitement.

==Release==

Orion Pictures did not have faith in &quot;The Terminator&quot; performing well at the box office and feared a negative critical reception. At an early screening of the film, the actors&#x27; agents insisted to the producers that the film should be screened for critics. Orion only held one press screening for the film. The film premiered on October 26, 1984. On its opening week, &quot;The Terminator&quot; played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4.0 million making it number one at the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to &quot;Oh, God! You Devil&quot;. Cameron noted that &quot;The Terminator&quot; was a hit &quot;relative to its market, which is between the summer and the Christmas blockbusters. But it&#x27;s better to be a big fish in a small pond than the other way around.&quot; &quot;The Terminator&quot; grossed $38.3 million in the United States and Canada and $40 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $78.3 million.

==Critical response==
===Contemporary===
Contemporary critical responses to &quot;The Terminator&quot; were mixed. &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film, calling it a &quot;blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso moviemaking, terrific momentum, solid performances and a compelling story ... Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in a machine-like portrayal that requires only a few lines of dialog.&quot; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine said that the film had &quot;plenty of tech-noir savvy to keep infidels and action fans satisfied.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; placed &quot;The Terminator&quot; on its &quot;10 Best&quot; list for 1984.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;a crackling thriller full of all sorts of gory treats ... loaded with fuel-injected chase scenes, clever special effects and a sly humor.&quot; The &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot; gave the film three stars, calling it &quot;the most chilling science fiction thriller since &quot;Alien&quot;&quot;. A review in &quot;Orange Coast&quot; magazine stated that &quot;the distinguishing virtue of &quot;The Terminator&quot; is its relentless tension. Right from the start it&#x27;s all action and violence with no time taken to set up the story ... It&#x27;s like a streamlined &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; movie – no exposition at all; just guns, guns and more guns.&quot; In the May 1985 issue of &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; it was referred to as a film that &quot;manages to be both derivative and original at the same time ... not since &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; has the genre exhibited so much exuberant carnage&quot; and &quot;an example of science fiction/horror at its best ... Cameron&#x27;s no-nonsense approach will make him a sought-after commodity&quot;. In the United Kingdom the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; praised the film&#x27;s script, special effects, design and Schwarzenegger&#x27;s performance. Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;The Terminator&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that it was &quot;a gripping sf horror movie&quot;. He continued, &quot;Linda Hamilton is admirable as the woman in peril who discovers her own strength to survive, and Arnold Schwarzenegger is eerily wonderful as the unstoppable cyborg.&quot;

Other reviews criticized the film&#x27;s violence and story-telling quality. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined that the film was a &quot;B-movie with flair. Much of it ... has suspense and personality, and only the obligatory mayhem becomes dull. There is far too much of the latter, in the form of car chases, messy shootouts and Mr. Schwarzenegger&#x27;s slamming brutally into anything that gets in his way.&quot; The &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; wrote a negative review, calling the film &quot;just another of the films drenched in artsy ugliness like &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two stars, adding that &quot;at times it&#x27;s horrifyingly violent and suspenseful at others it giggles at itself. This schizoid style actually helps, providing a little humor just when the sci-fi plot turns too sluggish or the dialogue too hokey.&quot; The Newhouse News Service called the film a &quot;lurid, violent, pretentious piece of claptrap&quot;. Scottish author Gilbert Adair called the film &quot;repellent to the last degree&quot;, charging it with &quot;insidious Nazification&quot; and having an &quot;appeal rooted in an unholy compound of fascism, fashion and fascination&quot;.

===Retrospective===
In 1991, Richard Schickel of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewed the film, giving it an &quot;A&quot; rating, writing that &quot;what originally seemed a somewhat inflated, if generous and energetic, big picture, now seems quite a good little film&quot;. He called it &quot;one of the most original movies of the 1980s and seems likely to remain one of the best sci-fi films ever made.&quot; In 1998, &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; described &quot;The Terminator&quot; as &quot;slick, rather nasty but undeniably compelling comic book adventures&quot;. Film4 gave it five stars, calling it the &quot;sci-fi action-thriller that launched the careers of James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger into the stratosphere. Still endlessly entertaining.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film four stars, referring to it as an &quot;amazingly effective picture that becomes doubly impressive when one considers its small budget ... For our money, this film is far superior to its mega-grossing mega-budgeted sequel.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; gave it five stars, calling it &quot;as chillingly efficient in exacting thrills from its audience as its titular character is in executing its targets.&quot; The film database AllMovie gave it 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, saying that it &quot;established James Cameron as a master of action, special effects, and quasi-mythic narrative intrigue, while turning Arnold Schwarzenegger into the hard-body star of the 1980s.&quot; Alan Jones awarded it five stars out of five for &quot;Radio Times&quot;, writing that &quot;maximum excitement is generated from the first frame and the dynamic thrills are maintained right up to the nerve-jangling climax. Wittily written with a nice eye for sharp detail, it&#x27;s hard sci-fi action all the way.&quot; Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; awarded it five stars out of five, stating that &quot;on the strength of this picture [...] Cameron could stand toe to toe with Carpenter and Spielberg. Sadly, it spawned a string of pointless and inferior sequels, but the first &quot;Terminator&quot; [...] stands up tremendously well with outrageous verve and blistering excitement.&quot;

==Post-release==
===Plagiarism and aftermath===
Writer Harlan Ellison stated that he &quot;loved the movie, was just blown away by it,&quot; but believed that the screenplay was based on a short story and episode of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; he had written, titled &quot;Soldier&quot;, and threatened to sue for infringement. Orion settled in 1986 and gave Ellison an undisclosed amount of money and added an acknowledgment credit to later prints of the film. The credit was also present on the 4k restoration that received a cinematic release and was released on Blu-ray in 2024 for the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary. Some accounts of the settlement state that &quot;Demon with a Glass Hand&quot;, another &quot;Outer Limits&quot; episode written by Ellison, was also claimed to have been plagiarized by the film, but Ellison explicitly stated that &quot;The Terminator&quot; &quot;was a ripoff&quot; of &quot;Soldier&quot; rather than of &quot;Demon with a Glass Hand.&quot;

Cameron was against Orion&#x27;s decision and was told that if he did not agree with the settlement, he would have to pay any damages if Orion lost a suit by Ellison. Cameron replied that he &quot;had no choice but to agree with the settlement. Of course, there was a gag order as well, so I couldn&#x27;t tell this story, but now I frankly don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s the truth.&quot;

===Thematic analysis===
The psychoanalyst Darian Leader sees &quot;The Terminator&quot; as an example of how the cinema has dealt with the concept of masculinity; he writes: 

&quot;The Terminator&quot; also explores the potential dangers of AI dominance and rebellion. The robots become self-aware in the future, reject human authority and determine that the human race needs to be destroyed. The impact of this theme is so great that the Terminator robot has become the &quot;prevalent visual representation of AI risk&quot;.

====Genre====
&quot;The Terminator&quot; features a narrative where elements of the science fiction film and action film genres prevail.
While rarely considered a horror film, the film does feature iconography associated with the slasher film, such as The Terminator as an unstoppable villain, and Sarah Connor as a final girl archetype.

Authors Paul Meehan in his book &quot;Tech-Noir: The Fusion of Science Fiction and Film Noir&quot; (2008) and Emily E. Auger in &quot;Tech-Noir Film: A Theory of the Development of Popular Genres&quot; (2011) found that &quot;The Terminator&quot; belonged to and was the originator of the term tech-noir. Both authors applied the term as a film genre to several works from the 1980s to the 2000s. Academic Carl Freedman was critical of Meehan&#x27;s categorization, noting Meehan&#x27;s lack of interest in genre theory and that his handling of generic categories of science fiction and &quot;film noir&quot; were not clear. Paweł Frelik also critiqued Auger&#x27;s lack of knowledge in genre theory, and dismissed the notion of tech-noir being a unique film genre. Frelik wrote that the films Auger mentioned including &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) had no applicable reason to be understood as tech-noir rather than science fiction.

&quot;The Terminator&quot; won three Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Make-up and Best Writing. The film has also received recognition from the American Film Institute, ranked 42nd on AFI&#x27;s &quot;100 Years... 100 Thrills&quot;, a list of America&#x27;s most heart-pounding films. The character of the Terminator was selected as the 22nd-greatest movie villain on AFI&#x27;s &quot;100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains&quot;. Schwarzenegger&#x27;s line &quot;I&#x27;ll be back&quot; became a catchphrase and was voted the 37th-greatest movie quote by the AFI.

In 2005, &quot;Total Film&quot; named it the 72nd-best film ever made. Schwarzenegger&#x27;s biographer Laurence Leamer wrote that &quot;The Terminator&quot; is &quot;an influential film affecting a whole generation of darkly hued science fiction, and it was one of Arnold&#x27;s best performances&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine selected &quot;The Terminator&quot; as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. &quot;Empire&quot; also placed the T-800 14th on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Movie Characters&quot;. In 2008, &quot;The Terminator&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In 2010, the &quot;Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance&quot; selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years. In 2015, &quot;The Terminator&quot; was among the films included in the book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;.

In 2019, Huw Fullerton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; ranked it the second best film of the six in the franchise, stating &quot;&quot;The Terminator&quot; was a brilliantly original, visceral and genuinely scary movie when it was released in 1984, and no matter how badly the visual effects age it hasn&#x27;t lost its impact.&quot; In 2021, Dalin Rowell of /Film ranked it the fourth best film of Cameron&#x27;s career, stating, &quot;While its pacing and story structure isn&#x27;t as tight as its sequel&#x27;s, &quot;The Terminator&quot; remains one of the most iconic pieces of pop culture ever created.&quot; Phil Pirrello of Syfy ranked it at number seven in the &quot;25 scariest sci-fi movies ever made&quot;, stating, &quot;Cameron forever changed both the genre and Schwarzenegger&#x27;s career with &quot;The Terminator&quot;, an iconic, tension-filled flick that mixes science fiction, action, and certain horror movie elements into one of the best things to ever come out of Hollywood [...] Cameron&#x27;s well-structured script is pure polish, with zero fat and a surplus of riveting tension that helps make it the timeless classic it is today.&quot;

===Merchandise===

A soundtrack to the film was released in 1984 which included the score by Brad Fiedel and the pop and rock songs used in the club scenes. Shaun Hutson wrote a novelization of the film which was published on February 21, 1985, by London-based Star Books (); Randal Frakes and William Wisher wrote a different novelization for Bantam/Spectra, published October, 1985 ().

Schwarzenegger returned for all but &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;, while Cameron and Hamilton returned for &quot;Terminator 2&quot; and &quot;Dark Fate&quot;, a direct sequel to the events of &quot;Terminator 2&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, a total order or linear order is a partial order in which any two elements are comparable. That is, a total order is a binary relation formula_1 on some set formula_2, which satisfies the following for all formula_3 and formula_4 in formula_2:

# formula_6 (reflexive).
# If formula_7 and formula_8 then formula_9 (transitive).
# If formula_7 and formula_11 then formula_12 (antisymmetric).
# formula_7 or formula_11 (strongly connected, formerly called total).

Reflexivity (1.) already follows from connectedness (4.), but is required explicitly by many authors nevertheless, to indicate the kinship to partial orders.
Total orders are sometimes also called simple, connex, or full orders.

A set equipped with a total order is a totally ordered set; the terms simply ordered set, linearly ordered set, toset and loset are also used. The term &quot;chain&quot; is sometimes defined as a synonym of &quot;totally ordered set&quot;, but generally refers to a totally ordered subset of a given partially ordered set.

An extension of a given partial order to a total order is called a linear extension of that partial order.

==Strict and non-strict total orders==

A on a set formula_2 is a strict partial order on formula_2 in which any two distinct elements are comparable. That is, a strict total order is a binary relation formula_17 on some set formula_2, which satisfies the following for all formula_3 and formula_4 in formula_2:
# Not formula_22 (irreflexive).
# If formula_23 then not formula_24 (asymmetric).
# If formula_23 and formula_26 then formula_27 (transitive).
# If formula_28, then formula_23 or formula_30 (connected).

Asymmetry follows from transitivity and irreflexivity; moreover, irreflexivity follows from asymmetry.

For delimitation purposes, a total order as defined above is sometimes called &quot;non-strict&quot; order.
For each (non-strict) total order formula_1 there is an associated relation formula_17, called the &quot;strict total order&quot; associated with formula_1 that can be defined in two equivalent ways:
* formula_23 if formula_7 and formula_28 (reflexive reduction).
* formula_23 if not formula_11 (i.e., formula_17 is the complement of the converse of formula_1).

Conversely, the reflexive closure of a strict total order formula_17 is a (non-strict) total order.

==Examples==

* Any subset of a totally ordered set is totally ordered for the restriction of the order on . 
* The unique order on the empty set, , is a total order.
* Any set of cardinal numbers or ordinal numbers (more strongly, these are well-orders).
* If is any set and an injective function from to a totally ordered set then induces a total ordering on by setting if and only if .
* The lexicographical order on the Cartesian product of a family of totally ordered sets, indexed by a well ordered set, is itself a total order. 
* The set of real numbers ordered by the usual &quot;less than or equal to&quot; (≤) or &quot;greater than or equal to&quot; (≥) relations is totally ordered. Hence each subset of the real numbers is totally ordered, such as the natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers. Each of these can be shown to be the unique (up to an order isomorphism) &quot;initial example&quot; of a totally ordered set with a certain property, (here, a total order is &quot;initial&quot; for a property, if, whenever has the property, there is an order isomorphism from to a subset of ):
** The natural numbers form an initial non-empty totally ordered set with no upper bound.
** The integers form an initial non-empty totally ordered set with neither an upper nor a lower bound.
** The rational numbers form an initial totally ordered set which is dense in the real numbers. Moreover, the reflexive reduction &lt; is a dense order on the rational numbers.
** The real numbers form an initial unbounded totally ordered set that is connected in the order topology (defined below).
* Ordered fields are totally ordered by definition. They include the rational numbers and the real numbers. Every ordered field contains an ordered subfield that is isomorphic to the rational numbers. Any &quot;Dedekind-complete&quot; ordered field is isomorphic to the real numbers.
* The letters of the alphabet ordered by the standard dictionary order, e.g., etc., is a strict total order.

==Chains==

The term chain is sometimes defined as a synonym for a totally ordered set, but it is generally used for referring to a subset of a partially ordered set that is totally ordered for the induced order. Typically, the partially ordered set is a set of subsets of a given set that is ordered by inclusion, and the term is used for stating properties of the set of the chains. This high number of nested levels of sets explains the usefulness of the term.

A common example of the use of &quot;chain&quot; for referring to totally ordered subsets is Zorn&#x27;s lemma which asserts that, if every chain in a partially ordered set has an upper bound in , then contains at least one maximal element. Zorn&#x27;s lemma is commonly used with being a set of subsets; in this case, the upper bound is obtained by proving that the union of the elements of a chain in is in . This is the way that is generally used to prove that a vector space has Hamel bases and that a ring has maximal ideals.

In some contexts, the chains that are considered are order isomorphic to the natural numbers with their usual order or its opposite order. In this case, a chain can be identified with a monotone sequence, and is called an ascending chain or a descending chain, depending whether the sequence is increasing or decreasing.

A partially ordered set has the descending chain condition if every descending chain eventually stabilizes. For example, an order is well founded if it has the descending chain condition. Similarly, the ascending chain condition means that every ascending chain eventually stabilizes. For example, a Noetherian ring is a ring whose ideals satisfy the ascending chain condition.

In other contexts, only chains that are finite sets are considered. In this case, one talks of a &quot;finite chain&quot;, often shortened as a &quot;chain&quot;. In this case, the length of a chain is the number of inequalities (or set inclusions) between consecutive elements of the chain; that is, the number minus one of elements in the chain. Thus a singleton set is a chain of length zero, and an ordered pair is a chain of length one. The dimension of a space is often defined or characterized as the maximal length of chains of subspaces. For example, the dimension of a vector space is the maximal length of chains of linear subspaces, and the Krull dimension of a commutative ring is the maximal length of chains of prime ideals.

&quot;Chain&quot; may also be used for some totally ordered subsets of structures that are not partially ordered sets. An example is given by regular chains of polynomials. Another example is the use of &quot;chain&quot; as a synonym for a walk in a graph.

==Further concepts==

===Lattice theory===

One may define a totally ordered set as a particular kind of lattice, namely one in which we have
: formula_42 for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;.

We then write &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; if and only if formula_43. Hence a totally ordered set is a distributive lattice.

===Finite total orders===

A simple counting argument will verify that any non-empty finite totally ordered set (and hence any non-empty subset thereof) has a least element. Thus every finite total order is in fact a well order. Either by direct proof or by observing that every well order is order isomorphic to an ordinal one may show that every finite total order is order isomorphic to an initial segment of the natural numbers ordered by &lt;. In other words, a total order on a set with &quot;k&quot; elements induces a bijection with the first &quot;k&quot; natural numbers. Hence it is common to index finite total orders or well orders with order type ω by natural numbers in a fashion which respects the ordering (either starting with zero or with one).

===Category theory===

Totally ordered sets form a full subcategory of the category of partially ordered sets, with the morphisms being maps which respect the orders, i.e. maps &quot;f&quot; such that if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) ≤ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;).

A bijective map between two totally ordered sets that respects the two orders is an isomorphism in this category.

===Order topology===

For any totally ordered set we can define the &quot;open intervals&quot; 
* , 
* , and 
We can use these open intervals to define a topology on any ordered set, the order topology.

When more than one order is being used on a set one talks about the order topology induced by a particular order. For instance if N is the natural numbers, is less than and greater than we might refer to the order topology on N induced by and the order topology on N induced by (in this case they happen to be identical but will not in general).

The order topology induced by a total order may be shown to be hereditarily normal.

===Completeness===

A totally ordered set is said to be complete if every nonempty subset that has an upper bound, has a least upper bound. For example, the set of real numbers R is complete but the set of rational numbers Q is not. In other words, the various concepts of completeness (not to be confused with being &quot;total&quot;) do not carry over to restrictions. For example, over the real numbers a property of the relation is that every non-empty subset &quot;S&quot; of R with an upper bound in R has a least upper bound (also called supremum) in R. However, for the rational numbers this supremum is not necessarily rational, so the same property does not hold on the restriction of the relation to the rational numbers.

There are a number of results relating properties of the order topology to the completeness of X:
* If the order topology on &quot;X&quot; is connected, &quot;X&quot; is complete.
* &quot;X&quot; is connected under the order topology if and only if it is complete and there is no &quot;gap&quot; in &quot;X&quot; (a gap is two points &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in &quot;X&quot; with &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; such that no &quot;c&quot; satisfies &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;c&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot;.)
* &quot;X&quot; is complete if and only if every bounded set that is closed in the order topology is compact.

A totally ordered set (with its order topology) which is a complete lattice is compact. Examples are the closed intervals of real numbers, e.g. the unit interval [0,1], and the affinely extended real number system (extended real number line). There are order-preserving homeomorphisms between these examples.

===Sums of orders===

For any two disjoint total orders formula_44 and formula_45, there is a natural order formula_46 on the set formula_47, which is called the sum of the two orders or sometimes just formula_48: 
: For formula_49, formula_50 holds if and only if one of the following holds:
:# formula_51 and formula_52
:# formula_53 and formula_54
:# formula_55 and formula_56
Intuitively, this means that the elements of the second set are added on top of the elements of the first set.

More generally, if formula_57 is a totally ordered index set, and for each formula_58 the structure formula_59 is a linear order, where the sets formula_60 are pairwise disjoint, then the natural total order on formula_61 is defined by 
: For formula_62, formula_63 holds if: 
:# Either there is some formula_58 with formula_65
:# or there are some formula_66 in formula_67 with formula_68, formula_69

=== Decidability ===
The first-order theory of total orders is decidable, i.e. there is an algorithm for deciding which first-order statements hold for all total orders. Using interpretability in S2S, the monadic second-order theory of countable total orders is also decidable.

==Orders on the Cartesian product of totally ordered sets==

There are several ways to take two totally ordered sets and extend to an order on the Cartesian product, though the resulting order may only be partial. Here are three of these possible orders, listed such that each order is stronger than the next:
* Lexicographical order: (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) ≤ (&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;) if and only if &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;c&quot; or (&quot;a&quot; = &quot;c&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;d&quot;). This is a total order.
* (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) ≤ (&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;) if and only if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;c&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;d&quot; (the product order). This is a partial order.
* (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) ≤ (&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;) if and only if (&quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;c&quot; and &quot;b&quot; &lt; &quot;d&quot;) or (&quot;a&quot; = &quot;c&quot; and &quot;b&quot; = &quot;d&quot;) (the reflexive closure of the direct product of the corresponding strict total orders). This is also a partial order.

Each of these orders extends the next in the sense that if we have &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; in the product order, this relation also holds in the lexicographic order, and so on. All three can similarly be defined for the Cartesian product of more than two sets.

Applied to the vector space R&quot;n&quot;, each of these make it an ordered vector space.

See also examples of partially ordered sets.

A real function of &quot;n&quot; real variables defined on a subset of R&quot;n&quot; defines a strict weak order and a corresponding total preorder on that subset.

==Related structures==

A binary relation that is antisymmetric, transitive, and reflexive (but not necessarily total) is a partial order.

A group with a compatible total order is a totally ordered group.

There are only a few nontrivial structures that are (interdefinable as) reducts of a total order. Forgetting the orientation results in a betweenness relation. Forgetting the location of the ends results in a cyclic order. Forgetting both data results in a separation relation.

<text>Strategic or tactical voting is voting in consideration of possible ballots cast by other voters in order to maximize one&#x27;s satisfaction with the election&#x27;s results. 

Gibbard&#x27;s theorem shows that no voting system has a single &quot;always-best&quot; strategy, i.e. one that always maximizes a voter&#x27;s satisfaction with the result, regardless of other voters&#x27; ballots. This implies all voting systems can sometimes encourage voters to strategize. However, weaker guarantees can be shown under stronger conditions. Examples include one-dimensional preferences (where the median rule is strategyproof) and dichotomous preferences (where approval or score voting are strategyproof).

With large electoral districts, party list methods tend to be difficult to manipulate in the absence of an electoral threshold. However, biased apportionment methods can create opportunities for strategic voting, as can small electoral districts (e.g. those used most often with the single transferable vote). Proportional representation systems with small districts often involve large-scale vote management operations, which are common in countries using STV-PR such as Ireland.

== Common types of strategic voting ==

Some types of strategic voting described in the literature are:

; , includes &quot;favorite betrayal&quot;.

: A voter ranks or rates a candidate they dislike – a &quot;lesser evil&quot; – higher in the hope of getting them elected, thus preventing an even worse candidate from being elected.
: This type of strategic voting includes the first-past-the-post strategy of voting for the lesser of two evils, as well as the more general &quot;favorite betrayal&quot; strategy. A sufficiently strong compromising incentive, possibly strengthened by a strategic exit incentive, can lead to or reinforce two-party rule as voters will abandon minor-party candidates to support stronger major-party candidates. This effect is called Duverger&#x27;s law.
: While methods that pass the sincere favorite criterion never incentivize a voter to rank or rate a lesser evil above one&#x27;s favorite, they may still incentivize voters to rank or rate the lesser evil &quot;higher&quot;. For instance, in approval voting, a voter may have an incentive to strategically approve a lesser evil that they dislike. Although not considered favorite betrayal, this is also a type of compromise strategy.
: &quot;Most affects:&quot; instant-runoff (RCV), two-round system, and (especially strong for) plurality.
: &quot;Also affected:&quot; Borda, Score, approval voting.
: &quot;Immune:&quot; Coombs&#x27; method, antiplurality.
: A voter ranks or rates a candidate lower in the hope of defeating them. For example, a voter may insincerely rank or rate a perceived strong candidate last in order to help their preferred candidate win.
: Game theory arguments suggest that if burial incentive is sufficiently severe, a method may induce a race to the bottom. Each voter follows a strategy that, in isolation, helps their candidate win, but the result is that a candidate that nobody likes gets elected instead.
: &quot;Most affects:&quot; Borda, antiplurality, approval voting, and Score.
: &quot;Also affected:&quot; Most Condorcet methods, with the exception of IRV-Condorcet hybrids.
: &quot;Immune:&quot; Instant-runoff voting and plurality voting.

; (sometimes called &quot;pushover&quot; or &quot;pied-piper.&quot; Includes &quot;raiding&quot;.)
: A voter gives a high rank to a weak (i.e. &quot;pushover&quot;) candidate, but not with the intent of getting them elected. Instead, the voter intends for the weak candidate to eliminate a strong alternative, who would otherwise keep the voter&#x27;s preferred candidate from winning. Party raiding is a well-known example of such a strategy.
: &quot;Most affects:&quot; Multi-round rules like instant-runoff, two-round, and primary elections.
: &quot;Immune:&quot; Plurality and all commonly-used rated voting systems, including score voting and approval voting.
; (sometimes called &quot;leveling&quot;. Includes &quot;bullet voting&quot; and &quot;truncation.&quot;)
: Compression is a strategy where a voter refuses to disclose which of two candidates they honestly prefer (i.e. both candidates are given the same rating or ranking). Compression is unique in that it does not involve a rank reversal: in compression, a voter who prefers A to B doesn&#x27;t claim to prefer B to A, only that they&#x27;re indifferent between them.
: Like &quot;compromising&quot; and &quot;burial&quot;, the strategy involves exaggerating differences between candidates: ranking or rating lesser evils equal to one&#x27;s favorite is similar to compromising, and ranking or rating okay candidates equal to one&#x27;s most loathed candidate is similar to burial. The latter is also called &quot;truncation&quot;.
: Compression has the advantage of making it less likely for a disliked candidate to win, but the disadvantage that it reduces the chances of the best candidate winning.
: &quot;Most affects&quot;: Rated voting.
: &quot;Immune:&quot; Random ballot and methods that require strict rankings.

==Frequency and susceptibility==

Strategic voting is highly dependent on the voting method being used. A strategic vote which improves a voter&#x27;s satisfaction under one method could have no effect or be outright self-defeating under another method. Gibbard&#x27;s theorem shows that no deterministic single-winner voting method can be completely immune to strategy, but makes no claims about the severity of strategy or how often strategy succeeds.

Later results show that some methods are more manipulable than others.

Michel Balinski and Rida Laraki, the inventors of the majority judgment method, performed an initial investigation of this question using a set of Monte Carlo simulated elections based on the results from a poll of the 2007 French presidential election which they had carried out using rated ballots. Comparing range voting, Borda count, plurality voting, approval voting with two different absolute approval thresholds, Condorcet voting, and majority judgment, they found that range voting had the highest (worst) strategic vulnerability, while their own method majority judgment had the lowest (best). Further investigation would be needed to be sure that this result remained true with different sets of candidates. 

Party-list proportional methods typically show less strategic voting, although the existence of electoral thresholds can lead voters to vote strategically to avoid wasted votes.

==Mitigation==
Switching from a method that is highly manipulable to one that is more resistant would help discourage widespread strategic voting, all else equal.

From a voting method, it&#x27;s possible to design another voting method that attempts to strategize on behalf of the voter. Such methods are called &quot;declared strategy voting&quot; methods, and seek to improve a method&#x27;s strategy resistance by moving the strategy into the method itself. DSV methods have been proposed for plurality voting, approval voting, and score voting.

==Coordination==

The nature of strategic voting requires some level of coordination. Because it is a system of voting that assesses outcomes before casting one&#x27;s vote, coordination towards the outcome is a prerequisite for strategic voting. There must be some kind of coordination device in order to vote strategically. Coordination devices, though not the only device, are typically opinion polls. For example, if there was two similarly appealing majority candidates and a minority candidate and voters were given the choice between the three, polls are imperative to coordinating votes for either majority candidate. Polls are then a tool used by voters to ensure that the minority candidate doesn&#x27;t obtain office, which would be adverse to Duverger&#x27;s law. 

Tactical voting may occur in isolation or as part of an organized campaign. In the former situation, electors make their own judgement as to the most effective way to (typically) prevent the election of a specific candidate or party. In the latter, one or more parties or groups encourage their supporters to vote tactically in an effort to influence the outcome. 

The form that coordinated tactical voting takes depends largely on the electoral system of the polity. For example, vote thresholds in a proportional representation electoral system are found to prompt voters to coordinate their votes. For example, in the 2018 Swedish election, thresholds led voters who identified with a small party to consider the outcomes of their votes on the system of government as well as the other parties&#x27; outcomes. The voting history of the polity also influences coordination efforts: in proportional representation systems with little voting history, voters tend to vote more sincerely than engage in strategic voting due to the unknown nature of what party will be most viable. 

Organized tactical voting in which a political party mounts a campaign calling on its supporters not to vote for their own favored candidates, but for those of a party which it perceives as more likely to defeat a common opponent, is less common. An example is the 1906 United Kingdom general election, where the Liberals (incidentally, the predecessors of the Liberal Democrats from the previous example) and the then-insurgent Labour Party (founded in 1900) agreed on the Gladstone-MacDonald pact, under which certain Liberal candidates would stand aside in favor of Labour ones, again to ensure that the Conservative candidates would not win on the basis of a split anti-Tory vote.

An intermediate case also exists, where a non-party campaign attempts to coordinate tactical voting, typically with the goal of defeating a certain party. Cases of this include the Canadian Anything But Conservative campaign, which opposed the Conservative Party of Canada in the 2008 and 2015 federal elections, or the Smart Voting campaign organized by Russia&#x27;s Anti-Corruption Foundation with the goal of opposing and weakening the United Russia party in the 2021 Russian legislative election. This also occurred in the UK 2019 General Election, where voting groups such as Tactical Vote and Turf Out The Tories, promoted tactical voting to prevent a Conservative majority.

== Examples in real elections ==
=== Canada ===
The observed effect of Duverger&#x27;s law in Canada is weaker than in other countries. In the 1999 Ontario provincial election, strategic voting was encouraged by opponents of the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris. This failed to unseat Harris but succeeded in suppressing the Ontario New Democratic Party vote to a historic low.

In the 2004 federal election, and to a lesser extent in the 2006 election, strategic voting was a concern for the federal New Democratic Party (NDP). In the 2004 election, the governing Liberal Party was able to convince many New Democratic voters to vote Liberal to avoid a Conservative government. In the 2006 elections, the Liberal Party attempted the same strategy, with Prime Minister Paul Martin asking New Democrats and Greens to vote for the Liberal Party to prevent a Conservative win. The New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton responded by asking voters to &quot;lend&quot; their votes to his party, suggesting that the Liberal Party was bound to lose the election regardless of strategic voting. This failed to prevent the Conservatives from winning the election, although they did not win a majority of seats.

During the 2015 federal election, strategic voting was used extensively against the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, which had benefited from vote splitting among centrist and left-leaning parties in the 2011 election. Following the landslide victory of the Liberals led by Justin Trudeau over Harper&#x27;s Conservatives, experts argued that this dramatic increase in support for the Liberals at the expense of the NDP and Green Party was partially due to strategic voting for Liberal candidates. In three weeks, 1.4 million voters switched from NDP to Liberal. In at least two closely-contested ridings, strategic voting websites obtained enough pledges to account for the victory margin of the Liberal candidate.

=== France ===
The two-round system in France shows strategic voting in the first round, due to considerations which candidate will reach the second round.
=== Germany ===
The mixed-member proportional representation allows to estimate the share of strategic voters in first-past-the-post voting due to the separate votes for party-lists and local single-winner electoral district candidates. The vote for party-lists is considered sincere if the party vote share is significantly above the 5% electoral threshold in Germany. In Germany the share of strategic voters was found around 30%, which decreased to 9% if only non-allied party candidates were contenders for the electoral district winner. In a contentious election year the share of strategic voters increased to around 45%.

Due to electoral threshold in party-list proportional representation one party asked in several elections their voters to vote for another allied party to help this party cross the electoral threshold.

=== Hong Kong ===
In Hong Kong, with its party-list proportional representation using largest remainder method with the Hare quota, voters supporting candidates of the pro-democracy camp often organize to divide their votes across different tickets, avoiding the concentration of votes on one or a few candidates. In 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Election, the practices of strategic voting were expanded by Benny Tai&#x27;s Project ThunderGo. The anti-establishment camp gained 29 seats, a historical record.

=== Hungary ===
In Hungary, during the 2018 Hungarian parliamentary election, several websites, such as taktikaiszavazas.hu (meaning &quot;strategic voting&quot;), promoted the idea to vote for opposition candidates with the highest probability of winning a given seat. About a quarter of opposition voters adopted this behavior, resulting in a total of 498,000 extra votes gained by opposition parties. A total of 14 extra single seats were taken by several parties and independent candidates.

=== Lithuania ===
In Lithuania, which has a parallel voting system at parliamentary and district levels, most of strategic voting takes place in single-member constituencies (or districts in mayoral elections). These constituencies have two-round system when no candidate wins more than 50 per cent of the votes in the first round. A notable example of strategic voting at the parliamentary level could be the 10th Naujoji Vilnia constituency in 2016 Lithuanian parliamentary election. To prevent independent candidate Algirdas Paleckis&#x27; victory, the Liberal Movement&#x27;s, the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union&#x27;s and the Social Democratic Party&#x27;s candidates endorsed their supporters to vote for the Homeland Union&#x27;s candidate Monika Navickienė (who came in second place). Monika Navickienė eventually won the constituency by around 900 votes. At a district level, an example could be Kėdainiai district&#x27;s mayoral election in the 2015 municipal elections. In the first round, the Labour Party won 13 seats of 26 seats in district council and was just one seat short of absolute majority. Nijolė Naujokienė (candidate to the district&#x27;s mayoral seat from the Labour Party) came short by 0.68 per cent in the mayoral election. Her opponent, Saulius Grinkevičius, had a 22 per cent gap to overcome. In the second round, Saulius Grinkevičius won by around 8 per cent (and 1,600 votes).

=== New Zealand ===
Since New Zealand moved to mixed-member proportional representation voting in 1996, the electoral system of New Zealand has seen strategic voting regularly occur in several elections, including one party explicitly or implicitly encouraging voters to vote for a candidate other than theirs. This happened first in 1996 in the Wellington Central, and then in 1999 in the Coromandel. From 1996 until 2005, it was a regular feature in the Ohariu-Belmont electorate, which was won by Peter Dunne throughout its existence and from 2005 in the Epsom electorate which has been won solely by the ACT party since 2005.

=== Poland ===
In the 2023 Polish parliamentary election, websites like pogonimypis.pl (meaning &quot;We&#x27;ll chase the PiS&quot;) gave information for which voters should vote for in their constituency in order to maximize the chance of the opposition winning the extra seat. The campaign was a success, with PiS losing the majority in the Sejm. At the same time, a referendum with the questions asked in a persuasive way took place, with the oppositing recommending to not take the referendal card. The voter turnout of the referendum is 40%, making it non-binding and merely a suggestion for all the future governments.

=== Slovenia ===
According to some media, in the 2011 Slovenian parliamentary election, 30% of voters voted tactically. Public polls predicted an easy win for Janez Janša, the candidate of the Slovenian Democratic Party; however, his opponent Zoran Janković, the candidate of Positive Slovenia, won. Prominent Slovenian public opinion researchers claimed that such proportions of strategic voting had not been recorded anywhere else before.

=== Spain ===
In the 2016 General Election in Spain, the incentives for voting tactically were much larger than usual, following the rise of the Podemos and Ciudadanos and following the economic crisis and election in 2015. The strategic voters successfully influenced the outcome of the election, despite a record low turnout of 66.5%. In a natural experiment in Andalusia 9% voted strategically when having opportunity, strategic behavior did not increase with time, and did not affect surrounding electoral areas, under the assumption that strategic voting happens only for district magnitude above 5.

=== Taiwan ===
In the 1995 Legislative Yuan election, strategic voting was implemented by the opposition parties, such as the Democratic Progressive Party and the New Party. As the members were elected in multi-member districts, the parties urged their supporters to vote for a party-nominated candidate according to criteria, such as the last digit of the voter&#x27;s National Identification Card Number or the voter&#x27;s birth month. This maximized the opposition&#x27;s seat gains and resulted in the ruling Kuomintang losing 10 seats, receiving the lowest share of seats in history at the time.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the 1997 UK general election, Democratic Left helped Bruce Kent set up GROT (Get Rid Of Them) a strategic voter campaign whose aim was to help prevent the Conservative Party from gaining a 5th term in office. This coalition was drawn from individuals in all the main opposition parties, and many who were not aligned with any party. While it is hard to prove that GROT swung the election itself, it did attract significant media attention and brought strategic voting into the mainstream for the first time in UK politics. In 2001, the Democratic Left&#x27;s successor organisation, the New Politics Network, organised a similar campaign. Since then strategic voting has become a consideration in British politics as is reflected in by-elections and by the growth in sites such as tacticalvote.co.uk, who encourage strategic voting as a way of defusing the two party system and empowering the individual voter. For the 2015 UK general election, voteswap.org attempted to prevent the Conservative Party staying in government by encouraging Green Party supporters to tactically vote for the Labour Party in listed marginal seats. In 2017 swapmyvote.uk was formed to help supporters of all parties swap their votes with people in other constituencies.

In the 2006 local elections in London, strategic voting was promoted by sites such as London Strategic Voter in a response to national and international issues.

In Northern Ireland, it is believed that (predominantly Protestant) Unionist voters in Nationalist strongholds have voted for the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) to prevent Sinn Féin from capturing such seats. This conclusion was reached by comparing results to the demographics of constituencies and polling districts.

In the 2017 general election, it is estimated that 6.5 million people (more than 20% of voters) voted tactically either as a way of preventing a &quot;hard Brexit&quot; or preventing another Conservative government led by the Tactical2017 campaign. Many Green Party candidates withdrew from the race in order to help the Labour Party secure closely fought seats against the Conservatives. This ultimately led to the Conservatives losing seats in the election even though they increased their overall vote share.

In the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election to determine the final two candidates for the party vote, it was suggested that front-runner Boris Johnson&#x27;s campaign encouraged some of its MPs to back Jeremy Hunt instead of Johnson, so that Huntseen as &quot;a lower-energy challenger&quot;would finish in second place, allowing an easier defeat in the party vote. Strategic voting was expected to play a major role in the 2019 General Election, with a YouGov poll suggesting that 19% of voters would be doing so tactically. 49% of strategic voters said they would do so in the hope of stopping a party whose views they opposed.

According to a 2020 study, older voters in the UK vote strategically more than younger voters, and richer voters vote more strategically than poorer voters.

In an example of individuals voting tactically, Labour voters in the 2022 Tiverton and Honiton by-election in the UK tactically supported the Liberal Democrat candidate in order to ensure the defeat of the Conservatives. This resulted in the Liberal Democrats winning what had previously been a Conservative safe seat.

In 2024, tactical voting was again advocated for the 2024 general election, as a means to defeat Conservative candidates in seats with traditional large Conservative majorities.

=== United States ===
Strategic voting in the US&#x27;s first-past-the-post voting and presidential system contributes to a two-party system, where the observed effect of Duverger&#x27;s law is stronger than in most countries.

In 2000, 2016, and 2024, a significant number of voters in the Presidential elections opted to use vote swapping to increase Democratic turnout in swing states and third-party turnout in safe states.

One high-profile example of strategic voting was the 2002 California gubernatorial election. During the Republican primaries, Republicans Richard Riordan (former mayor of Los Angeles) and Bill Simon (a self-financed businessman) vied for a chance to compete against the unpopular incumbent Democratic Governor of California, Gray Davis. Polls predicted that Riordan would defeat Davis, while Simon would not. At that time, the Republican primaries were partially closed primaries in which non-partisans and registered Republicans could vote regardless of their party affiliation. Davis supporters (those were eligible to vote in the Republican primary) were rumored to have voted for Simon because Riordan was perceived as a greater threat to Davis; this, combined with a negative advertising campaign by Davis describing Riordan as a &quot;big-city liberal&quot;, allowed Simon to win the primary despite a last-minute business scandal. The strategy to nominate Simon (if in fact it was a reality), was successful, as he lost in the general election against Davis. However, it resulted in the lowest gubernatorial general election turnout in modern California political history, thus requiring fewer signatures to qualify a recall that ultimately ousted Davis.

Similarly, in 2012, Claire McCaskill boosted Todd Akin in the 2012 US Senate election in Missouri. In addition to running ads highlighting Akin&#x27;s conservative stances, McCaskill also directed messages to surrogates to tell Akin to run ads which would increase his primary polling.

==== Puerto Rico ====
Puerto Rico&#x27;s 2004 elections were affected by strategic voting. Pedro Rosselló, the New Progressive Party&#x27;s candidate of that year, was unpopular across much of the territory due to large corruption schemes and the privatization of public corporations. To prevent Rossell from winning, other factions supported the Partido Popular Democratico&#x27;s candidate. The elections were close; statehood advocates won a seat in the U.S. house of representatives and majorities in both legislative branches, but lost governance to Aníbal Acevedo Vilá. (Puerto Ricans have the chance to vote by party or by candidate. Separatists voted under their ideology but for the center party&#x27;s candidate, which caused major turmoil.) After a recount and a trial, Acevedo Vilá was certified as governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

== Rational voter model ==
Analysis of strategic voting is commonly based on a model of behavior where voters are &quot;short-term instrumentally rational&quot;. That is, voters are only voting in order to make an impact on one election at a time (not, say, to build the political party for next election); voters have a set of sincere preferences, or utility rankings, by which to rate candidates; voters have some knowledge of each other&#x27;s preferences; and voters understand how best to use strategic voting to their advantage. The extent to which this model resembles real-life elections is the subject of considerable academic debate.

=== Myerson–Weber strategy ===
An example of a rational voter strategy is described by Myerson and Weber. The strategy is broadly applicable to a number of single-winner voting methods that are additive point methods, such as Plurality, Borda, Approval, and Range. The strategy is optimal in the sense that the strategy will maximize the voter&#x27;s expected utility when the number of voters is sufficiently large.

This rational voter model assumes that the voter&#x27;s utility of the election result is dependent only on which candidate wins and not on any other aspect of the election, for example showing support for a losing candidate in the vote tallies. The model also assumes the voter chooses how to vote individually and not in collaboration with other voters.

Given a set of &quot;k&quot; candidates and a voter let:

: &quot;vi&quot; = the number of points to be voted for candidate &quot;i&quot;
: &quot;ui&quot; = the voter&#x27;s gain in utility if candidate &quot;i&quot; wins the election
: &quot;pij&quot; = the (voter&#x27;s perceived) &quot;pivot probability&quot; that candidates &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; will be tied for the most total points to win the election.

Then the voter&#x27;s &quot;prospective rating&quot; for a candidate &quot;i&quot; is defined as:

: formula_1

The gain in expected utility for a given vote is given by:

: formula_2

The gain in expected utility can be maximized by choosing a vote with suitable values of &quot;vi&quot;, depending on the voting method and the voter&#x27;s prospective ratings for each candidate. For specific voting methods, the gain can be maximized using the following rules:

* Plurality: Vote for the candidate with the highest prospective rating. This is different from choosing the best of the frontrunners, which is a common heuristic approach to voting. In rare cases, the highest prospective rating can belong to a weak candidate (one with a low probability of winning).
* Borda: Rank the candidates in decreasing order of prospective rating.
* Approval: Vote for all candidates that have a positive prospective rating.
* Range: Vote the maximum (minimum) for all candidates with a positive (negative) prospective rating.

Pivot probabilities are rarely estimated in political forecasting, but can be estimated from predicted winning probabilities. An important special case occurs when the voter has no information about how other voters will vote. This is sometimes referred to as the &quot;zero information strategy&quot;. In this special case, the &quot;pij&quot; pivot probabilities are all equal and the rules for the specific voting methods become:

* Plurality: Vote for the most preferred (highest utility) candidate. This is the sincere plurality vote.
* Borda: Rank the candidates in decreasing order preference (decreasing order of utility). This is the sincere ranking of the candidates.
* Approval: Calculate the average utility of all candidates. Vote for all candidates that have a higher-than-average utility; do not vote for any candidates that have a lower-than-average utility.
* Range: Calculate the average utility of all candidates. Vote the maximum points for all candidates that have a higher-than-average utility; vote the minimum points for all candidates that have a lower-than-average utility; vote any value for a candidate with a utility equal to the average.

Myerson and Weber also describe voting equilibria that require all voters use the optimal strategy and all voters share a common set of &quot;pij&quot; pivot probabilities. Because of these additional requirements, such equilibria may in practice be less widely applicable than the strategies.

== Pre-election influence ==
Strategic voting requires voters to be informed, as they can only gauge who is in the leading and who may not be a viable candidate through the information they are supplied. Because strategic voting relies heavily on voters&#x27; perception of how other voters intend to vote, campaigns in electoral methods that promote compromise frequently focus on affecting voters&#x27; perception of campaign viability. Most campaigns craft refined media strategies to shape the way voters see their candidacy. During this phase, there can be an analogous effect where campaign donors and activists may decide whether or not to support candidates tactically with their money and time.

In rolling elections, where some voters have information about previous voters&#x27; preferences (e.g. presidential primaries in the United States), candidates put disproportionate resources into competing strongly in the first few stages, because those stages affect the reaction of later stages.

Perceived influence on other voters also interacts with strategic voting. In a study of the Israeli voting system, presumed media influence was found to be a variable in the case of why voters partake in strategic voting. Because the Israeli electoral system is complex, with many parties, and parliamentary, this perceived media influence effect may have a larger and more observable effect on simpler systems such as the one in the United States. 

Game theory has been used to search for some kind of &quot;minimally manipulable&quot; (incentive compatibility) voting schemes. Game theory can also be used to analyze the pros and cons of different methods. For instance, when electors vote for their own preferences rather than tactically, Condorcet method-like methods tend to settle on compromise candidates, while instant-runoff voting favors those candidates with strong core support but otherwise narrower appeal due to holding more uncompromising positions. Thus, Condorcet methods incentivize candidates to position themselves closer to the median voter and appeal to a wider section of the electorate than instant-runoff voting does.

== By method ==

=== Plurality voting ===

Lesser-evil voting is exceedingly common in plurality elections, where the first preference is all that counts (and thus lesser-evil voting is the only effective kind of strategic voting). The most typical tactic is to assess which two candidates are frontrunners (most likely to win) and to vote for the preferred one of those two, even if a third candidate is preferred over both. Duverger&#x27;s law is the observation that this kind of strategic voting and strategic nomination is sufficiently common for any method based on first preferences to produce two-party domination.

=== Plurality-runoff family (RCV, two-round, and partisan primaries) ===

Theoretical results indicate that, under two-round runoff voting with three candidates, strategic equilibria exist in which only two candidates receive votes. It has been shown experimentally that voters are influenced by a candidate&#x27;s perceived likelihood of winning the election.

Instant runoff voting is vulnerable to three of the four kinds of strategy discussed above. It is vulnerable to lesser-evil voting; to turkey-raising; and to strategic truncation.

There is a common misconception that instant-runoff is not affected by a kind of strategic voting called truncation or bullet voting. However, satisfying later-no-harm does not (by itself) provide resistance to such strategies, unless paired with the participation criterion. Systems like instant runoff that pass later-no-harm but fail participation still incentivize truncation or bullet voting in some situations.

=== Cardinal single-winner voting ===

Most cardinal, single-winner voting systems in large elections encourage similar strategies:

# Calculate the expected (average) utility of the election result (the average utility if the election was repeated many times).
# Top-rate all candidates with above-average utility, and bottom-rate all candidates with below-average utility.

Such a strategy involves &quot;semi-honest exaggeration&quot;. Unlike in most voting systems, voters rarely (if ever) have an incentive to lie about which of two candidates they prefer, which makes such far milder than under other voting systems. Voters exaggerate the difference between a certain pair of candidates but do not rank any less-preferred candidate over any more-preferred one. This form of exaggeration has an effect whenever the voter&#x27;s honest rating for the intended winner is below that candidate&#x27;s median rating; or when their honest rating for the intended loser is above it. In other words, half of voters will have an incentive to strategize, while half will not.

Typically, this would not be the case unless there were two similar candidates favored by the same set of voters. A strategic vote against a similar rival could result in a favored candidate winning; although if voters for both similar rivals used this strategy, it could cause a candidate favored by neither of these voter groups to win.

Balinski and Laraki noted that under majority judgment, many voters have no opportunity or incentive to use strategy. They argued based on a simulation that the highest median methods minimized the number of voters with an incentive to misrepresent their opinions, among the methods they studied.

Strategic voters are faced with the initial tactic as to how highly to score their second-choice candidate. The voter may want to retain expression of a high preference of their favorite candidate over their second choice. But that does not allow the same voter to express a high preference of their second choice over any others.

In approval voting, because the only option is to approve of a candidate or not, optimal strategic voting rarely includes ranking a less-preferred candidate over a more-preferred candidate. However, strategy is in fact inevitable when a voter decides their &quot;approval cutoff&quot;. Steven Brams and Dudley R. Herschbach argued in a paper in &quot;Science&quot; magazine in 2001 that approval voting was the method least amenable to tactical perturbations.

Balinski and Laraki used rated ballots from a poll of the 2007 French presidential election to show that, if unstrategic voters only approved candidates whom they considered &quot;very good&quot; or better, strategic voters would be able to sway the result frequently, but that if unstrategic voters approved all candidates they considered &quot;good&quot; or better, approval was the second most strategy-resistant method of the ones they studied, after majority judgment itself.

=== Ranked single-winner voting ===

The Borda count has both a strong incentive and a large vulnerability to burial. Here is a hypothetical example of both factors at the same time: if there are two candidates the most likely to win, the voter can maximize the impact on the contest between these candidates by ranking the candidate the voter likes more in first place, ranking the candidate whom they like less in last place. If neither candidate is the sincere first or last choice, the voter is using both the compromising and burying strategies at once. If many different groups voters use this strategy, this gives a paradoxical advantage to the candidate generally thought least likely to win.

=== Condorcet ===

Condorcet methods are vulnerable to 3 of the 4 kinds of strategy listed above, because the Condorcet winner criterion is incompatible with the sincere favorite criterion, participation criterion, later-no-harm, and later-no-help. Strategy in Condorcet methods can become highly complex, but almost always involves burial or truncation.

=== Multi-winner voting ===
==== Single transferable vote ====

The single transferable vote may incentivize free-riding: if a voter expects their favorite candidate will almost-certainly be elected, insincerely ranking the second candidate first does not hurt the favored candidate.

Some forms of STV allow strategic voters to gain an advantage by listing a candidate who is very likely to lose in first place. This strategy, called &quot;Woodall free riding&quot;, is essentially eliminated by Meek&#x27;s method; however, Meek&#x27;s method is rarely used because of its substantial complexity, having been adopted only for some local elections in New Zealand.

In Malta&#x27;s STV, the two-party system can cause strategic voting away from third parties.

<text>Tetraodontiformes (), also known as the Plectognathi, is an order of ray-finned fishes which includes the pufferfishes and related taxa. This order has been classified as a suborder of the order Perciformes, although recent studies have found that it, as the Tetraodontoidei, is a sister taxon to the anglerfish order Lophiiformes, called Lophiodei, and have placed both taxa within the Acanthuriformes. The Tetraodontiformes are represented by 10 extant families and at around 430 species overall. The majority of the species within this order are marine but a few may be found in freshwater. They are found throughout the world.

==Taxonomy==
Tetraodontiformes is a name first used for this order in 1940 by Lev Berg, the order was originally proposed in 1817 as the &quot;Les Plectognathes&quot;, the Plectognathi. Cuvier divided this into two families &quot;Les Gymnodontes&quot; and &quot;Les Sclerodermes&quot;. In 1940 Berg first used the term Tetraodontiformes for this order and this name is the currently accepted name as it follows the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature rule that a name for a family or higher taxa must have its root based on the type species of that grouping. In this case the type species is &quot;Tetraodon lineatus&quot; Linnaeus, 1758. The 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; recognises the order as a derived order within the Actinopterygii and as a monophyletic order within the Percomorpha. Other authorities have proposed that it is not an order but that it is a clade, the Tetraodontoidei, within the order Acanthuriformes and is most closely related to the Lophiodei, the anglerfishes.

==Etymology==
Tetraodontiformes suffixes &quot;ifirmes&quot;, meaning &quot;in the form of&quot;, onto the genus name], &quot;Tetraodon&quot;, of the type species of Tetraodontidae, the best known and most widely distributed family in the order. &quot;Tetraodon&quot; means &quot;four tooth&quot; and alludes to the four fused teeth, separated by a central suture, in the jaws.

== Evolution ==
The oldest tetraodontiforms are the extinct suborder Plectocretacicoidei from the Late Cretaceous (Santonian to Campanian) of Italy and Slovenia, both in the former Tethyan region. These comprise the families Cretatriacanthidae and Protriacanthidae. &quot;Plectocretacicus&quot; from the Cenomanian of Lebanon has also been proposed as a tetraodontiform, but this has been more recently questioned.

== Description ==
Tetraodontiformes include a variety of body shapes, all radical departures from the streamlined body plan typical of most fishes. These forms range from nearly square or triangular (boxfishes), globose (pufferfishes) to laterally compressed (filefishes and triggerfishes). They range in size from &quot;Rudarius excelsus&quot; (a filefish), measuring just in length, to the ocean sunfish, the largest of all bony fishes at up to in length and weighing over 2 tonnes.

Most members of this order – except for the family Balistidae – are ostraciiform swimmers, meaning the body is rigid and incapable of lateral flexure. Because of this, they are slow-moving and rely on their pectoral, dorsal, anal, and caudal fins for propulsion rather than body undulation. However, movement is usually quite precise; dorsal and anal fins aid in manoeuvring and stabilizing. In most species, all fins are simple, small, and rounded, except for the pelvic fins which, if present, are fused and buried. Again, in most members, the gill plates are covered over with skin, the only gill opening a small slit above the pectoral fin.

The tetraodontiform strategy seems to be defense at the expense of speed, with all species fortified with scales modified into strong plates or spines – or with tough, leathery skin (the filefishes and ocean sunfish). Another striking defensive attribute found in the pufferfishes and porcupinefishes is the ability to inflate their bodies to greatly increase their normal diameter; this is accomplished by sucking water into a diverticulum of the stomach. Many species of the Tetraodontidae, Triodontidae, and Diodontidae are further protected from predation by tetrodotoxin, a powerful neurotoxin concentrated in the animals&#x27; internal organs.

Tetraodontiforms have highly modified skeletons, with no nasal, parietal, infraorbital, or (usually) lower rib bones. The bones of the jaw are modified and fused into a sort of &quot;beak&quot;; visible sutures divide the beaks into &quot;teeth&quot;. This is alluded to in their name, derived from the Greek words &#x27; meaning &quot;four&quot; and &#x27; meaning &quot;tooth&quot; and the Latin &quot;forma&quot; meaning &quot;shape&quot;. Counting these teeth-like bones is a way of distinguishing similar families, for example, the Tetraodontidae (&quot;four-toothed&quot;), Triodontidae (&quot;three-toothed&quot;), and Diodontidae (&quot;two-toothed&quot;).

Their jaws are aided by powerful muscles, and many species also have pharyngeal teeth to further process prey items, because the Tetraodontiformes prey mostly on hard-shelled invertebrates, such as crustaceans and shellfish.

The Molidae are conspicuous even within this oddball order; they lack swim bladders and spines, and are propelled by their very tall dorsal and anal fins. The caudal peduncle is absent and the caudal fin is reduced to a stiff rudder-like structure. Molids are pelagic rather than reef-associated and feed on soft-bodied invertebrates, especially jellyfish.

==Families==
The Tetraodontiformes contains the following suborders and families:
*Suborder Plectocretacicoidei 
**Family Cretatriacanthidae 
**Family Plectocretacicidae 
**Family Protriacanthidae 
* Suborder Triodontoidei

<text>A thesaurus (: thesauri or thesauruses), sometimes called a synonym dictionary or dictionary of synonyms, is a reference work which arranges words by their meanings (or in simpler terms, a book where one can find different words with similar meanings to other words), sometimes as a hierarchy of broader and narrower terms, sometimes simply as lists of synonyms and antonyms. They are often used by writers to help find the best word to express an idea:
Synonym dictionaries have a long history. The word &#x27;thesaurus&#x27; was used in 1852 by Peter Mark Roget for his &quot;Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus&quot;.

While some works called &quot;thesauri&quot;, such as &quot;Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus&quot;, group words in a hierarchical hypernymic taxonomy of concepts, others are organised alphabetically or in some other way.

Most thesauri do not include definitions, but many dictionaries include listings of synonyms.

Some thesauri and dictionary synonym notes characterise the distinctions between similar words, with notes on their &quot;connotations and varying shades of meaning&quot;. Some synonym dictionaries are primarily concerned with differentiating synonyms by meaning and usage. Usage manuals such as Fowler&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot; or &quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot; often prescribe appropriate usage of synonyms.

Writers sometimes use thesauri to avoid repetition of words – elegant variation – which is often criticised by usage manuals: &quot;Writers sometimes use them not just to vary their vocabularies but to dress them up too much&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;thesaurus&quot; comes from Latin &quot;&quot;, which in turn comes from Greek (&quot;thēsauros&quot;) &#x27;treasure, treasury, storehouse&#x27;. The word &quot;thēsauros&quot; is of uncertain etymology.

Until the 19th century, a thesaurus was any dictionary or encyclopedia, as in the &quot;Thesaurus Linguae Latinae&quot; (&quot;Dictionary of the Latin Language&quot;, 1532), and the &quot;Thesaurus Linguae Graecae&quot; (&quot;Dictionary of the Greek Language&quot;, 1572). It was Roget who introduced the meaning &quot;collection of words arranged according to sense&quot;, in 1852.

== History ==

In antiquity, Philo of Byblos authored the first text that could now be called a thesaurus. In Sanskrit, the Amarakosha is a thesaurus in verse form, written in the 4th century.

The study of synonyms became an important theme in 18th-century philosophy, and Condillac wrote, but never published, a dictionary of synonyms.

Some early synonym dictionaries include:
* John Wilkins, &quot;An Essay Towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language&quot; and &quot;Alphabetical Dictionary&quot; (1668) is a &quot;regular enumeration and description of all those things and notions to which names are to be assigned&quot;. They are not explicitly synonym dictionaries — in fact, they do not even use the word &quot;synonym&quot; — but they do group synonyms together.
* Gabriel Girard, &quot;La Justesse de la langue françoise, ou les différentes significations des mots qui passent pour synonymes&quot; (1718)
* John Trusler, &quot;The Difference between Words esteemed Synonyms, in the English Language; and the proper choice of them determined&quot; (1766)
* Hester Lynch Piozzi, &quot;British Synonymy&quot; (1794)
* James Leslie, &quot;Dictionary of the Synonymous Words and Technical Terms in the English Language&quot; (1806)
* George Crabb, &quot;English Synonyms Explained&quot; (1818)

&quot;Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus&quot;, first compiled in 1805 by Peter Mark Roget, and published in 1852, follows John Wilkins&#x27; semantic arrangement of 1668. Unlike earlier synonym dictionaries, it does not include definitions or aim to help the user choose among synonyms. It has been continuously in print since 1852 and remains widely used across the English-speaking world. Roget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:

It is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.
==Organization==

===Conceptual===
Roget&#x27;s original thesaurus was organized into 1000 conceptual Heads (e.g., 806 Debt) organized into a four-level taxonomy. For example, debt is classed under V..iv:
:Class five, &quot;Volition: the exercise of the will&quot;
::Division Two: &quot;Social volition&quot;
:::Section 4: &quot;Possessive Relations&quot;
::::Subsection 4: &quot;Monetary relations&quot;.
Each head includes direct synonyms: Debt, obligation, liability, ...; related concepts: interest, usance, usury; related persons: debtor, debitor, ... defaulter (808); verbs: to be in debt, to owe, ... &quot;see&quot; Borrow (788); phrases: to run up a bill or score, ...; and adjectives: in debt, indebted, owing, ... Numbers in parentheses are cross-references to other Heads.

The book starts with a Tabular Synopsis of Categories laying out the hierarchy, then the main body of the thesaurus listed by the Head, and then an alphabetical index listing the different Heads under which a word may be found: Liable, &quot;subject to&quot;, 177; &quot;debt&quot;, 806; &quot;duty&quot;, 926.

Some recent versions have kept the same organization, though often with more detail under each Head. Others have made modest changes such as eliminating the four-level taxonomy and adding new heads: one has 1075 Heads in fifteen Classes.

Some non-English thesauri have also adopted this model.

In addition to its taxonomic organization, the &quot;Historical Thesaurus of English&quot; (2009) includes the date when each word came to have a given meaning. It has the novel and unique goal of &quot;charting the semantic development of the huge and varied vocabulary of English&quot;.

Different senses of a word are listed separately. For example, three different senses of &quot;debt&quot; are listed in three different places in the taxonomy:
A sum of money that is owed or due; a liability or obligation to pay

===Alphabetical===

Other thesauri and synonym dictionaries are organized alphabetically.

Most repeat the list of synonyms under each word.

Some designate a principal entry for each concept and cross-reference it.

A third system interfiles words and conceptual headings. Francis March&#x27;s &quot;Thesaurus Dictionary&quot; gives for &quot;liability&quot;: , each of which is a conceptual heading. The article has multiple subheadings, including Nouns of Agent, Verbs, Verbal Expressions, &quot;etc.&quot; Under each are listed synonyms with brief definitions, &quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;Credit. Transference of property on promise of future payment.&quot; The conceptual headings are not organized into a taxonomy.

Benjamin Lafaye&#x27;s &quot;Synonymes français&quot; (1841) is organized around morphologically related families of synonyms (&quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;logis, logement&quot;), and his &quot;Dictionnaire des synonymes de la langue française&quot; (1858) is mostly alphabetical, but also includes a section on morphologically related synonyms, which is organized by prefix, suffix, or construction.

===Contrasting senses===

Before Roget, most thesauri and dictionary synonym notes included discussions of the differences among near-synonyms, as do some modern ones.

&quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Dictionary of Synonyms&quot; is a stand-alone modern English synonym dictionary that does discuss differences. In addition, many general English dictionaries include synonym notes.

Several modern synonym dictionaries in French are &quot;primarily&quot; devoted to discussing the precise demarcations among synonyms.

===Additional elements===

Some include short definitions.

Some give illustrative phrases.

Some include lists of objects within the category (hyponyms), &quot;e.g.&quot; breeds of dogs.

==Bilingual==

Bilingual synonym dictionaries are designed for language learners. One such dictionary gives various French words listed alphabetically, with an English translation and an example of use. Another one is organized taxonomically with examples, translations, and some usage notes.

==Information science and natural language processing==

In library and information science, a thesaurus is a kind of controlled vocabulary.

A thesaurus can form part of an ontology and be represented in the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS).

Thesauri are used in natural language processing for word-sense disambiguation and text simplification for machine translation systems.

<text>The Trial of Socrates (399 BC) was held to determine the philosopher&#x27;s guilt of two charges: &quot;asebeia&quot; (impiety) against the pantheon of Athens, and corruption of the youth of the city-state; the accusers cited two impious acts by Socrates: &quot;failing to acknowledge the gods that the city acknowledges&quot; and &quot;introducing new deities&quot;.

The death sentence of Socrates was the legal consequence of asking politico-philosophic questions of his students, which resulted in the two accusations of moral corruption and impiety. At trial, the majority of the &quot;dikasts&quot; (male-citizen jurors chosen by lot) voted to convict him of the two charges; then, consistent with common legal practice voted to determine his punishment and agreed to a sentence of death to be executed by Socrates&#x27;s drinking a poisonous beverage of hemlock.

Primary-source accounts of the trial and execution of Socrates are the &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot; by Plato and the &quot;Apology of Socrates to the Jury&quot; by Xenophon of Athens, both of whom had been his students; modern interpretations include &quot;The Trial of Socrates&quot; (1988) by the journalist I. F. Stone, &quot;Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths&quot; (2009) by the Classics scholar Robin Waterfield, and &quot;The Shadows of Socrates: The Heresy, War, and Treachery behind the Trial of Socrates&quot; (2024) by the scholar Matt Gatton.

==Background==
Before the philosopher Socrates was tried for moral corruption and impiety, the citizens of Athens knew him as an intellectual and moral gadfly of their society. In the comic play, &quot;The Clouds&quot; (423 BC), Aristophanes represents Socrates as a sophistic philosopher who teaches the young man Pheidippides how to formulate arguments that justify striking and beating his father. Despite Socrates denying he had any relation with the Sophists, the playwright indicates that Athenians associated the philosophic teachings of Socrates with Sophism. As philosophers, the Sophists were men of ambiguous reputation, &quot;they were a set of charlatans that appeared in Greece in the fifth century BC, and earned ample livelihood by imposing on public credulity: professing to teach virtue, they really taught the art of fallacious discourse, and meanwhile propagated immoral practical doctrines.&quot;

Besides &quot;The Clouds&quot;, the comic play &quot;The Wasps&quot; (422 BC) also depicts inter-generational conflict, between an older man and a young man. Such representations of inter-generational social conflict among the men of Athens, especially in the decade from 425 to 415 BC, can reflect contrasting positions regarding opposition to or support for the Athenian invasion of Sicily. Many Athenians blamed the teachings of the Sophists and of Socrates for instilling the younger generation with a morally nihilistic, disrespectful attitude towards their society.

Socrates left no written works; however, his student and friend, Plato, wrote Socratic dialogues, featuring Socrates as the protagonist. As a teacher, competitor intellectuals resented Socrates&#x27;s &quot;elenctic examination&quot; method for intellectual inquiry, because its questions threatened their credibility as men of wisdom and virtue.

It has sometimes been claimed that Socrates described himself as the &quot;gadfly&quot; of Athens which, like a sluggish horse, needed to be aroused by his &quot;stinging&quot;. In the Greek text of his defense given by Plato, Socrates never actually uses that term (viz., &quot;gadfly&quot; [Grk., &quot;oîstros&quot;]) to describe himself. Rather, his reference is merely allusive, as he (literally) says only that he has attached himself to the City (&quot;proskeimenon tē polei&quot;) in order to sting it. Nevertheless, he does make the bold claim that he is a god&#x27;s gift to the Athenians.

Socrates&#x27;s elenctic method was often imitated by the young men of Athens.

===Association with Alcibiades and the Thirty Tyrants===
Alcibiades was an Athenian general who had been the main proponent of the disastrous Sicilian Expedition during the Peloponnesian Wars, where virtually the entire Athenian invading force of more than 50,000 soldiers and non-combatants (e.g., the rowers of the Triremes) was killed or captured and enslaved. He was a student and close friend of Socrates, and his messmate during the siege of Potidaea (433–429 BC). Socrates remained Alcibiades&#x27;s close friend, admirer, and mentor for about five or six years. 

His complex friendship with Socrates was put on display during Alcibiades&#x27; speech at the Symposium, where he both praised Socrates and also disclosed his emotional turmoil and humiliation because of his personal desires. Alcibiades accused Socrates of arrogance during what he framed as a &quot;trial&quot;, using the audience as a jury to judge Socrates&#x27; pride. Yet, Socrates remained silent, demonstrating the self-control that challenged Alcibiades&#x27; values. Alcibiades admitted this created an inner conflict, as Socrates&#x27; teachings inspired a shift in thinking toward focusing on one&#x27;s inner character over their outward success. In this way, the &quot;first trial&quot; of Socrates serves as a powerful metaphor for the philosophical and personal challenges he posed to the traditional Athenian values, foreshadowing the tensions that would later lead to his formal trial. 

During his career, Alcibiades famously defected to Sparta, arch-enemy of Athens, after being summoned to trial, then to Persia after being caught in an affair with the wife of his benefactor (the King of Sparta). He then defected back to Athens after successfully persuading the Athenians that Persia would come to their aid against Sparta (though Persia had no intention of doing so). Finally driven out of Athens after the defeat of the Battle of Notium against Sparta, Alcibiades was assassinated in Phrygia in 400 BC by his Spartan enemies.

Another possible source of resentment was the political views that he and his associates were thought to have embraced. Critias, who appears in two of Plato&#x27;s Socratic dialogues, was a leader of the Thirty Tyrants (the ruthless oligarchic regime that ruled Athens, as puppets of Sparta and backed by Spartan troops, for eight months in 404–403 BC until they were overthrown). Several of the Thirty had been students of Socrates, but there is also a record of their falling out.

As with many of the issues surrounding Socrates&#x27;s conviction, the nature of his affiliation with the Thirty Tyrants is far from straightforward. During the reign of the Thirty, many prominent Athenians who were opposed to the new government left Athens. Robin Waterfield asserts that &quot;Socrates would have been welcome in oligarchic Thebes, where he had close associates among the Pythagoreans who flourished there, and which had already taken in other exiles.&quot; Given the availability of a hospitable host outside of Athens, Socrates, at least in a limited way, chose to remain in Athens. Thus, Waterfield suggests, Socrates&#x27;s contemporaries probably thought his remaining in Athens, even without participating in the Thirty&#x27;s bloodthirsty schemes, demonstrated his sympathy for the Thirty&#x27;s cause, not neutrality towards it. This is proved, Waterfield argues, by the fact that after the Thirty were no longer in power, anyone who had remained in Athens during their rule was encouraged to move to Eleusis, the new home of the expatriate Thirty. Socrates did oppose the will of the Thirty on one documented occasion. Plato&#x27;s &quot;Apology&quot; has the character of Socrates describe that the Thirty ordered him, along with four other men, to fetch a man named Leon of Salamis so that the Thirty could execute him. While Socrates did not obey this order, he did nothing to warn Leon, who was subsequently apprehended by the other four men.

=== Support of oligarchic rule and contempt for Athenian democracy ===

According to the portraits left by some of Socrates&#x27;s followers, Socrates himself seems to have openly espoused certain anti-democratic views, the most prominent perhaps being the view that it is not majority opinion that yields correct policy but rather genuine knowledge and professional competence, which is possessed by only a few. Plato also portrays him as being severely critical of some of the most prominent and well-respected leaders of the Athenian democracy; and even has his claim that the officials selected by the Athenian system of governance cannot credibly be regarded as benefactors since it is not any group of &quot;many&quot; that benefits, but only &quot;someone or very few persons&quot;. Finally, Socrates was known as often praising the laws of the undemocratic regimes of Sparta and Crete. Plato himself reinforced anti-democratic ideas in &quot;The Republic&quot;, advocating rule by elite, enlightened &quot;Philosopher-Kings&quot;.

The totalitarian Thirty Tyrants had anointed themselves as the elite, and in the minds of his Athenian accusers, Socrates was guilty because he was suspected of introducing oligarchic ideas to them. Larry Gonick, in his &quot;Cartoon History of the Universe&quot; wrote: 
Apart from his views on politics, Socrates held unusual views on religion. He made several references to his spirit, or &quot;daimonion&quot;, although he explicitly claimed that it never urged him on, but only warned him against various prospective actions.

==Historical descriptions of the trial==

The extant, primary sources about the history of the trial and execution of Socrates are: the &quot;Apology of Socrates to the Jury&quot;, by Xenophon, a historian and philosopher; and the tetralogy of Socratic dialogues&quot;Euthyphro&quot;, the &quot;Socratic Apology&quot;, &quot;Crito&quot;, and &quot;Phaedo&quot;, by Plato, a philosopher who had been a student of Socrates.

In &quot;The Indictment of Socrates&quot; (392 BC), the sophist rhetorician Polycrates (440–370) presents the prosecution speech by Anytus, which condemned Socrates for his political and religious activities in Athens before the year 403 BC. In presenting such a prosecution, which addressed matters external to the specific charges of moral corruption and impiety levelled by the Athenian &quot;polis&quot; against Socrates, Anytus violated the political amnesty specified in the agreement of reconciliation (403–402 BC), which granted pardon to a man for political and religious actions taken before or during the rule of the Thirty Tyrants, &quot;under which all further charges and official recriminations concerning the [reign of] terror were forbidden&quot;.

Moreover, the legal and religious particulars against Socrates that Polycrates reported in &quot;The Indictment of Socrates&quot; are addressed in the replies by Xenophon and the sophist Libanius of Antioch (314–390).

==Trial==
The formal accusation was the second element of the trial of Socrates, which the accuser, Meletus, swore to be true, before the archon (a state officer with mostly religious duties) who considered the evidence and determined that there was an actionable case of &quot;moral corruption of Athenian youth&quot; and &quot;impiety&quot;, for which the philosopher must legally answer; the archon summoned Socrates for a trial by jury.

Athenian juries were drawn by lottery, from a group of hundreds of male-citizen volunteers; such a great jury usually ensured a majority verdict in a trial. Although neither Plato nor Xenophon of Athens identifies the number of jurors, a jury of 501 men likely was the legal norm. In the &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot; (36a–b), about Socrates&#x27;s defence at trial, Plato said that if just 30 of the votes had been otherwise, then Socrates would have been acquitted (36a), and that (perhaps) less than three-fifths of the jury voted against him (36b). Assuming a jury of 501, this would imply that he was convicted by a majority of 280 against 221. The citizens were in a state of fear because of the past war and plagues they feared to anger their gods again because of Socrates, so this context can help in understanding the state of mind of some jurors when giving their verdict.

Having been found guilty of corruption and impiety, Socrates and the prosecutor suggested sentences for the punishment of his crimes against the city-state of Athens. Expressing surprise at the few votes required for an acquittal, Socrates joked that he be punished with free meals at the Prytaneum (the city&#x27;s sacred hearth), an honour usually held for a benefactor of Athens, and the victorious athletes of an Olympiad. After that failed suggestion, Socrates then offered to pay a fine of 100 drachmaeone-fifth of his propertywhich largesse testified to his integrity and poverty as a philosopher. Finally, a fine of 3,000 drachmae was agreed, proposed by Plato, Crito, Critobulus, and Apollodorus, who guaranteed paymentnonetheless, the prosecutor of the trial of Socrates proposed the death penalty for the impious philosopher. (Diogenes Laërtius, 2.42). In the end, the sentence of death was passed by a greater majority of the jury than that by which he had been convicted.

In the event, friends, followers, and students encouraged Socrates to flee Athens, an action which the citizens expected; yet, on principle, Socrates refused to flout the law and escape his legal responsibility to Athens (see: &quot;Crito&quot;). Therefore, faithful to his teaching of civic obedience to the law, the 70-year-old Socrates executed his death sentence and drank the hemlock, as condemned at trial. (See: &quot;Phaedo&quot;)

==Death==
The death of Socrates is presented in the Platonic diaologue the Phaedo, in which Socrates and his friends discuss the immortality of the soul before Socrates drinks the hemlock poison given to him for his execution.

==Interpretations of the trial of Socrates==
===Ancient===
In the time of the trial of Socrates, the year 399 BC, the city-state of Athens recently had endured the trials and tribulations of Spartan hegemony and the 13-month régime of the Thirty Tyrants, which had been imposed consequently to the Athenian defeat in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC). At the request of Lysander, a Spartan admiral, the Thirty men, led by Critias and Theramenes, were to administer Athens and revise the city&#x27;s democratic laws, which were inscribed on a wall of the Stoa Basileios. Their actions were to facilitate the transition of the Athenian government from a democracy to an oligarchy in service to Sparta.

Moreover, the Thirty Tyrants also appointed a council of 500 men to perform the judicial functions that once had belonged to every Athenian citizen. In their brief régime, the pro-Spartan oligarchs killed about five percent of the Athenian population, confiscated much property, and exiled democrats from the city proper. The fact that Critias, leader of the Thirty Tyrants, had been a pupil of Socrates was held against him.
Plato&#x27;s presentation of the trial and death of Socrates inspired writers, artists, and philosophers to revisit the matter. For some, the execution of the man whom Plato called &quot;the wisest and most just of all men&quot; demonstrated the defects of democracy and of popular rule; for others, the Athenian actions were a justifiable defence of the recently re-established democracy.

===Modern===
In &quot;The Trial of Socrates&quot; (1988), I. F. Stone argued that Socrates wanted to be sentenced to death, to justify his philosophic opposition to the Athenian democracy of that time, and because, as a man, he saw that old age would be an unpleasant time for him.

In the introduction to his play &quot;Socrates on Trial&quot; (2007), Andrew Irvine claimed that because of his loyalty to Athenian democracy, Socrates willingly accepted the guilty verdict voted by the jurors at his trial: 
In &quot;Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths&quot; (2009), Robin Waterfield wrote that the death of Socrates was an act of volition motivated by a greater purpose; Socrates &quot;saw himself as healing the City&#x27;s ills by his voluntary death&quot;. Waterfield wrote that Socrates, with his unconventional methods of intellectual enquiry, attempted to resolve the political confusion then occurring in the city-state of Athens, by willingly being the scapegoat, whose death would quiet old disputes, which then would allow the Athenian polis to progress towards political harmony and social peace.

In &quot;The New Trial of Socrates&quot; (2012), an international panel of ten judges held a mock re-trial of Socrates to resolve the matter of the charges levelled against him by Meletus, Anytus, and Lycon, that: &quot;Socrates is a doer of evil and corrupter of the youth, and he does not believe in the gods of the state, and he believes in other new divinities of his own&quot;. Five judges voted guilty and five judges voted not guilty. Limiting themselves to the facts of the case against Socrates, the judges did not consider any sentence, but the judges who voted the philosopher guilty said that they would not have considered the death penalty for him.

In &quot;The Shadows of Socrates: The Heresy, War, and Treachery behind the Trial of Socrates&quot; (2024), Matt Gatton offered a new perspective on the trial, based on his reconstruction archeological work that was published in the &quot;Oxford Handbook of Light in Archeology&quot; (2022). Gatton asserts that the impiety charge against Socrates stemmed from his searing critique of Athens’ most hallowed religious ritual—the Mysteries of Eleusis. He writes: &quot;Trying to explain what happened to Socrates without talking about the Mysteries of Eleusis is like trying to explain what happened to Galileo without mentioning the Catholic Church.&quot; Gatton agrees with prior authors that the corrupting the youth charge was the result of the ruinous actions of several of Socrates’ former students, most pointedly Alcibiades and Critias, but Gatton sees Alcibiades’ alleged profanation of the Mysteries of Eleusis as a significant factor. In this respect, both of the charges against Socrates are tied back to the same source.

<doc id="30339" wikidata="Q71910" url="?curid=30339" title="Tetris">
<text>Tetris () is a puzzle video game created in 1985 by Alexey Pajitnov, a Soviet software engineer. Players move tetrominoes, which move down the playing field, to fill horizontal lines. The completed lines disappear, granting the player points, and all other blocks move down the corresponding number of lines. Different versions of &quot;Tetris&quot; have introduced altered game mechanics, with some becoming standard over time. Versions have been released for PC, consoles and mobile platforms.

In the 1980s, Pajitnov worked for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Center of the Academy of Sciences, where he programmed &quot;Tetris&quot; on the Electronika 60 and adapted it to the IBM PC with the help of Dmitry Pavlovsky and Vadim Gerasimov. Floppy disk copies were distributed freely throughout Moscow, before spreading to Eastern Europe. Robert Stein of Andromeda Software licensed &quot;Tetris&quot; to Mirrorsoft in the UK and Spectrum HoloByte in the US. Both companies released the game in 1988 to commercial success and sold licenses to other companies, including Henk Rogers&#x27; Bullet-Proof Software. Rogers negotiated with Elektronorgtechnica, the state-owned organization in charge of licensing Soviet software, to license &quot;Tetris&quot; to Nintendo for the Game Boy and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES); both versions were released in 1989. In 1996, after the rights reverted to Pajitnov, he and Rogers formed the Tetris Company to manage licensing. 

The Game Boy version became the best-selling version of &quot;Tetris&quot; and one of the best-selling video games of all time, with 35 million sales, which popularized the console. More than 200 versions of &quot;Tetris&quot; have been published by numerous companies on more than 65 platforms, setting a &quot;Guinness&quot; world record for the most ports and variants. &quot;Tetris&quot; is the second-best-selling video game franchise, with over 520 million sales, mostly on mobile.

&quot;Tetris&quot; has been influential in the genre of puzzle video games and popular culture. It is an early example of a casual game and it is represented in a vast array of media such as architecture and art. It has been the subject of academic research, including studies of its potential for psychological intervention. A competitive culture has formed around &quot;Tetris&quot;, particularly the NES version, following the inaugural Classic Tetris World Championship in 2010. It is often ranked among the greatest video games and was among the first games inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in 2015. Afilm dramatization of the game&#x27;s development was released in 2023.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Tetris&quot; is a puzzle video game with a consistent general design across its numerous versions. It consists of a rectangular field in which tetromino pieces, seven geometric shapes consisting of four squares, descend from the top-center. During the descent, the player can move the piece horizontally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or another piece. The player&#x27;s goal is to stack the pieces in the field to create horizontal lines of blocks. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the blocks placed above fall one row. As lines are cleared, the speed of the descending pieces increase. The game ends if the accumulated pieces in the field block other pieces from entering the field, a process known as &quot;topping out&quot;. Common mechanics among &quot;Tetris&quot; variants include soft drop (the ability to increase the descent of the piece), hard drop (instantly placing the piece as far down as it can go), and holding (reserving a piece for later use).

The objective of &quot;Tetris&quot; is to collect as many points as possible during a gameplay session by clearing lines. &quot;Tetris&quot; scoring system has remained mostly consistent since &quot;Tetris DS&quot; (2006) with some exceptions. Points gained during gameplay increase with the descent speed. The more lines cleared at once, the higher the score for a line clear; clearing four lines at once using an &quot;I&quot;-piece is referred to as a &quot;Tetris&quot;. The player can also gain points by using hard drops or soft drops. There are advanced techniques that can gain more points than a Tetris, including T-spins (spinning a T-piece into a blocked gap), perfect clears (emptying the field following a line clear), and combos (clearing lines with multiple pieces in a row).

==History==
===Creation (1984–1985)===

Alexey Pajitnov was a speech recognition and artificial intelligence researcher for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Center of the Academy of Sciences. Pajitnov developed several puzzle games on the institute&#x27;s Electronika 60, an archaic Russian clone of the PDP-11 computer. In June 1984, he became inspired to convert pentomino tiling puzzles to the computer after he bought a pentomino puzzle set from a store and played with it in his office.

Pajitnov wrote &quot;Tetris&quot; using Pascal for the RT-11 operating system on the Electronika 60 and experimented with different versions. Because the Electronika 60 had no graphical interface, Pajitnov modeled the field and pieces using spaces and brackets. He felt that the game would be needlessly complicated with the twelve different shape variations of pentominoes, so he scaled the concept down to tetrominoes, of which there are seven variants. Afterward, he programmed the basic mechanics, including the ability to flip tetrominoes as they fell in a vertical screen and the clearing of lines. The name &quot;Tetris&quot; was a combination of &quot;tetra&quot; (meaning &quot;four&quot;) and Pajitnov&#x27;s favorite sport, tennis. Pajitnov completed the first version of &quot;Tetris&quot; 1985. This version had no scoring system and no levels but Pajitnov&#x27;s peers were captivated.

Pajitnov sought to port &quot;Tetris&quot; to the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC), which had a higher-quality display than the Electronika 60. He recruited his colleague Dmitry Pavlovsky and the 16-year-old computer prodigy Vadim Gerasimov. Using Turbo Pascal, the three adapted &quot;Tetris&quot; to the IBM PC over two months, with Gerasimov incorporating color and Pavlovsky incorporating a scoreboard. Floppy disk copies of this version were distributed freely throughout the Dorodnitsyn Computing Center, before spreading quickly among Moscow computer circles. Pajitnov kept note of second-hand accounts of &quot;Tetris&quot; spread during this time. &quot;Tetris&quot; reportedly won second place in a Zelenodolsk computer game competition in November 1985, and by 1986, nearly everyone with an IBM computer in Moscow and similar cities had played &quot;Tetris&quot;.

===Spread beyond the Soviet Union (1985–1988)===
Under Soviet law, intellectual rights were not protected, and the state-run organization Elektronorgtechnica (Elorg) had a monopoly on the import and export of software. Pajitnov lacked knowledge of the business world so he asked his supervisor, Victor Brjabrin, who had knowledge of the world outside the Soviet Union, to help him publish &quot;Tetris&quot;. Pajitnov offered to transfer the rights to the Academy and was delighted to receive a non-compulsory remuneration from Brjabrin through this deal. In 1986, Brjabrin sent a copy of &quot;Tetris&quot; to the Hungarian game publisher Novotrade, and copies began circulating via floppy disks throughout Hungary. Robert Stein, an international software salesman for the London-based firm Andromeda Software, saw the commercial potential during a visit to Hungary in June 1986. After an indifferent response from the Academy, Stein contacted Pajitnov and Brjabrin by fax to obtain the license rights. The Soviet researchers expressed interest in forming an agreement with Stein via fax, but were unaware that this fax communication could be considered a legal contract in the Western world; Stein began to approach other companies to produce the game.

Stein approached publishers at the 1987 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and signed two agreements: he sold the European rights to the publisher Mirrorsoft and the American rights to its sister company, Spectrum HoloByte. Spectrum HoloByte obtained the rights after a visit to Mirrorsoft by the Spectrum HoloByte president, Phil Adam, when he played &quot;Tetris&quot; for two hours. At that time, Stein had not yet signed a contract with the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, he sold the rights to the two companies for £3,000 and royalties of 7.5–15% of sales. Before releasing &quot;Tetris&quot; in the United States, the Spectrum HoloByte CEO, Gilman Louie, asked for an overhaul of the graphics and music. The Soviet spirit was preserved, with fields illustrating Russian parks and buildings as well as melodies anchored in Russian folklore of the time. The company&#x27;s goal was to make people want to buy a Russian product. The game came complete with a red package and Cyrillic text, an unusual approach on the other side of the Berlin Wall. 

&quot;Tetris&quot; was first commercially released in the West on the IBM PC, with other computer systems planned for release in the following weeks. The Mirrorsoft version was released in Europe on January 27, 1988, and the Spectrum HoloByte version on January 29, 1988. Mirrorsoft versions for systems such as the Amiga, Atari ST, and Commodore 64 rewrote the code of the original IBM version. Boosted by word of mouth and positive reviews, Mirrorsoft sold tens of thousands of copies in two months, and Spectrum HoloByte sold over 100,000 units in the space of a year. According to Spectrum HoloByte, the average &quot;Tetris&quot; player was between 25 and 45 years old and was a manager or engineer. At the Software Publishers Association&#x27;s Excellence in Software Awards ceremony in March 1988, &quot;Tetris&quot; won Best Entertainment Software, Best Original Game, Best Strategy Program, and Best Consumer Software.

The only document certifying a license fee was the fax from Pajitnov and Brjabrin, meaning that Stein had sold the license for a game he did not yet own. He contacted Pajitnov and asked for a contract for the rights. Stein began negotiations via fax, offering 75% of the revenue generated by Stein from the license. Elorg was unconvinced and requested 80%. Stein made several trips to Moscow and held long discussions with Elorg representatives. He came to an agreement with Elorg on February 24, 1988. On May 10, he signed a contract for a ten-year worldwide &quot;Tetris&quot; license for all current and future computer systems. Pajitnov and Brjabrin were unaware that the game was already on sale and that Stein had claimed to own the rights prior to the agreement. Although Pajitnov did not receive a percentage of these sales, he said that &quot;the fact that so many people enjoy my game is enough for me&quot;.

===Legal battles (1988–1989)===

Following the commercial release of &quot;Tetris&quot;, Spectrum HoloByte and Mirrosoft started licensing it to other companies. In 1988, Spectrum HoloByte sold the Japanese rights to its computer games to Bullet-Proof Software&#x27;s Henk Rogers, who was searching for games for the Japanese market. Mirrorsoft sold arcade rights to the Atari Games subsidiary Tengen, which sold the Japanese arcade rights to Sega and the console rights to BPS. BPS published versions for Japanese computers, including the MSX2, PC-88 and X68000, along with a console port for the Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom). &quot;Tetris&quot; was commercially successful worldwide; the Famicon version sold two million copies in Japan. Elorg was unaware of the deals Stein had negotiated and received no royalties. 

Nintendo was attracted to &quot;Tetris&quot; for its simplicity and its established success on the Famicom, and considered porting it to their first handheld console, the Game Boy. Rogers, who was close to the Nintendo president, Hiroshi Yamauchi, sought the handheld rights. After a failed negotiation with Atari, Rogers contacted Stein in November 1988. Stein agreed to sign a contract, but explained that he had to consult Elorg before returning to negotiations with Rogers. After contacting Stein several times, Rogers began to suspect a breach of contract on Stein&#x27;s part. 

In February 1989, Rogers traveled to the Soviet Union and arrived at the Elorg offices uninvited to negotiate the rights. Discussions resulted the next day, when Stein and the Mirrorsoft manager Kevin Maxwell made an appointment with Elorg without consulting each other. Rogers befriended Pajitnov over a game of Go, and Pajitnov in turn supported Rogers throughout the discussions. Rogers explained that he wanted to obtain the rights to &quot;Tetris&quot; for the Game Boy. After quickly obtaining an agreement with the Elorg president, Nikolai Belikov, Rogers showed Belikov a Famicom &quot;Tetris&quot; cartridge. Belikov believed that the rights to &quot;Tetris&quot; had only been signed for computer systems so the Soviets accused Rogers of illegal publication. He explained that he had obtained the rights via Atari Games, which had itself signed an agreement with Stein. 

Sympathetic to Rogers&#x27; plight, Belikov constructed a strategy to regain possession of the rights and obtain better commercial agreements. At that point, Elorg was faced with three different companies seeking to buy the rights. Belikov proposed canceling Stein&#x27;s rights and granting them instead to Nintendo for both home and handheld consoles. Rogers flew to the US to convince Nintendo&#x27;s American branch to sign up for the rights. The contract with Elorg was signed by Minoru Arakawa of Nintendo for $500,000, plus 50 cents per cartridge sold. Elorg then sent an updated contract to Stein which he signed without carefully reading it. One of the clauses defined a computer as a machine with a screen and keyboard, and thus Stein&#x27;s rights to console versions were withdrawn. Stein later realized that all the contract&#x27;s other clauses, notably on payments, were a &quot;smokescreen&quot; to deceive him.

In March 1989, Nintendo sent a cease and desist to Atari Games concerning their production of &quot;Tetris&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), the North American version of the Famicom. In response, the Mirrorsoft owner, Robert Maxwell, pressured the Soviet Union leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, to cancel the contract between Elorg and Nintendo. Despite the threats to Belikov, Elorg refused to concede, highlighting the financial advantages of their contract compared to those signed with Stein and Mirrorsoft. On June 15, 1989, Nintendo and Atari Games began a legal battle in the courts of San Francisco. Atari Games sought to prove that the NES was a computer, which would make Atari Games&#x27;s port authorized by their license. They argued that the NES&#x27;s Japenese counterpart, the Famicom, could be converted into a computer with a Family BASIC peripheral. Judge Fern M. Smith rejected this argument and declared that Mirrorsoft and Spectrum HoloByte had never received explicit authorization for marketing on consoles. On June 21, 1989, he ruled in Nintendo&#x27;s favor, granting them a preliminary injunction against Atari Games. The next day, Atari Games withdrew its NES version from sale, and thousands of cartridges remained unsold in its warehouses. Preference for this version over Nintendo&#x27;s led to Atari Games cartridges selling for up to $300 on the secondary market.

===Game Boy and NES (1989–1996)===

The Game Boy version of &quot;Tetris&quot; was released in Japan on June 14, 1989 and as a pack-in game in the United States on July 31, 1989. The NES version was released the same year. Both versions achieved commercial success. The Game Boy version was the primary game promoted for the Game Boy, becoming its killer app, generating $80 million in revenue, and popularizing both the Game Boy and &quot;Tetris&quot;. The Game Boy version is the most commercially successful and considered by many to be the best version of &quot;Tetris&quot;. The NES version appeared on Ninendo&#x27;s most popular games list for over a year. To date, the Game Boy version has sold 35 million copies, and the NES version has sold 8 million copies.

Through the legal history of the license, Pajitnov gained a reputation in the West. He was regularly invited by journalists and publishers, through which he discovered that &quot;Tetris&quot; had sold millions of copies, from which he had not made any money. He took pride in the game, which he considered &quot;an electronic ambassador of benevolence&quot;. In January 1990, Pajitnov was invited by Spectrum HoloByte to the Consumer Electronics Show, and he was immersed in American life for the first time. After a period of adaptation, he explored American culture in several cities, including Las Vegas, San Francisco, New York City and Boston. He engaged in interviews with several hosts, including the directors of Nintendo of America. He marveled at the freedom and the advantages of Western society, and, upon returning to the Soviet Union, he spoke often of his travels to his colleagues. He realized that there was no market in Russia for their programs. 

In 1991, with Rogers&#x27; help, Pajitnov and his family emigrated to Seattle, United States, where he worked as a freelance game designer. During this time, Pajitnov worked on several sequels to &quot;Tetris&quot;. &quot;Welltris&quot; (1990) involved adjusting geometrical pieces descending down one of four walls of a three-dimensional well, and &quot;Hatris&quot; (1990) and &quot;Faces...tris III&quot; (1991) replaced descending tetrominoes with hats and faces respectively. Though they generally received positive reviews and commercial success, with &quot;Faces...Tris III&quot; winning &quot;Best Action/Arcade Program&quot; in the 1991 Excellence in Software Awards, none replicated &quot;Tetris&quot; success. Other early variants of &quot;Tetris&quot; developed without Pajitnov&#x27;s involvement included Spectrum Holobyte&#x27;s &quot;Super Tetris&quot; (1991), Bullet-Proof Software&#x27;s &quot;Tetris 2 + BomBliss&quot; (1991) and &quot;Tetris Battle Gaiden&quot; (1993), and Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Tetris 2&quot; (1993).

===The Tetris Company and Blue Planet Software (1996–2014)===

The Academy of Sciences&#x27; rights to &quot;Tetris&quot; expired at the end of 1995, reverting back to Pajitnov. Worried that Elorg, which had become a private company under Belikov following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, would try to claim the rights, Pajitnov recruited Rogers to secure his rights. Rogers formed The Tetris Company as an equal partnership between Elorg and Rogers&#x27; new company, Blue Planet Software. Rogers acquired Elorg and renamed it Tetris Holding in 2005. Since formation, The Tetris Company has maintained guidelines for authorized versions of &quot;Tetris&quot;, and Blue Planet Software has served as an agent for the &quot;Tetris&quot; brand. The Tetris Company has also enforced its copyright of &quot;Tetris&quot; against unauthorized clones, such as the 2012 case, &quot;Tetris Holding, LLC v. Xio Interactive, Inc.&quot;, where a judge ruled that &quot;Mino&quot; violated &quot;Tetris&quot; copyright based on look and feel.

Pajitnov and Rogers sought to keep &quot;Tetris&quot; fresh and innovated in new directions. &quot;Tetrisphere&quot;, developed by H2O Entertainment and released on August 11, 1997 was an example of this innovation. Gameplay involved rotating a three-dimensional sphere to place pieces on its surface. It was the first puzzle video game on the Nintendo 64 and garnered a cult following. David Crookes of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; called &quot;Tetrisphere&quot; &quot;proof that the concept could be modernised and tweaked, while still being faithful to the original&quot;. Another game on the Nintendo 64, the Japan-exclusive &quot;Tetris 64&quot; (1998), allowed for four players and was the only game to utilize the Nintendo 64&#x27;s Bio Sensor, which detected a player&#x27;s pulse. On other platforms around this time, &quot;Tetris Plus&quot; (1996), &quot;Tetris DX&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Next Tetris&quot; added new game modes, and &quot;&quot; (1998) was an arcade game targeted toward experienced players. 

During this time frame The Tetris Company started to standardize features that were not in the original game in order to appeal to beginner players, according to Rogers. These features included the hold feature in &quot;The New Tetris&quot; in 1999, the easy spin and the super rotation system in &quot;Tetris Worlds&quot; in 2001, and the scoring system introduced in &quot;Tetris DS&quot; in 2006.&quot;&quot; Critics panned &quot;Tetris Worlds&quot; for the easy spin mechanic, which allowed players to delay a piece&#x27;s descent by continually rotating it. Despite the controversy and Pajitnov&#x27;s reluctance, the mechanic was implemented into the &quot;Tetris&quot; guidelines. Alongside the easy spin, &quot;Tetris Worlds&quot; introduced the super rotation system which defines how pieces rotate, which most versions have used since.

&quot;Tetris&quot; was first ported to mobile devices in 2001 by G-Mode. In 2002, Rogers formed Blue Lava Wireless to develop &quot;Tetris&quot; games for mobile platforms. JAMDAT acquired Blue Lava Wireless in April 2005, granting them a 15-year license of &quot;Tetris&quot; for mobile platforms. By December 2005 when Electronic Arts (EA) started its acquisition of JAMDAT, &quot;Tetris&quot; had been consistently selling well on American carrier phones. EA completed its acquisition in February 2006, granting it the mobile license for &quot;Tetris&quot;. EA Mobile released their first Tetris game as a launch title for the iTunes store on iPod 5G on September 11, 2006, and then their version of &quot;Tetris&quot; on the Apple App Store on iOS on July 10, 2008. By January 2010, EA&#x27;s mobile versions reached 100 million paid downloads, making &quot;Tetris&quot; the most popular mobile game of all time. EA&#x27;s license expired on April 21, 2020, and the game became inoperable.

===Maya Rogers&#x27; succession and resurgence of popularity (2014–present)===

In January 2014, after eight years of involvement, Henk Rogers&#x27; daughter Maya succeeded him as the CEO of Blue Planet Software. She began by planning activities for &quot;Tetris&quot; 30th anniversary. In an interview with &quot;VentureBeat&quot; in June 2014, Maya spoke of her desire to expand &quot;Tetris&quot; brand, such as through merchandising, and keeping the game fresh. Her theme for the 30th anniversary was &quot;We All Fit Together&quot;. Sega released &quot;Puyo Puyo Tetris&quot;, a crossover between &quot;Tetris&quot; and &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot;, in Japan on February 6, 2014, for multiple platforms. &quot;Puyo Puyo Tetris&quot; sold over 60,000 copies within a week, with the Nintendo 3DS version being the second-highest-selling game of the week according to &quot;4Gamer.net&quot;. Ubisoft&#x27;s &quot;Tetris Ultimate&quot; was released on the Nintendo 3DS in November 2014 and the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in December 2014. A PC port was released on December 2015, although initial user reviews reported frequent crashes. &quot;Tetris Ultimate&quot; received mixed reviews but the online multiplayer was generally seen favorably.

In the late 2010s, &quot;Tetris&quot; had a resurgence in popularity with the release of &quot;Tetris Effect&quot; and &quot;Tetris 99&quot;. &quot;PCMag&quot; credited the resurgence to the 2017 release of &quot;Puyo Puyo Tetris&quot; in the Western world where it received positive reviews and sold 1.4 copies worldwide by November 2020. &quot;Tetris Effect&quot; was developed by Monstars and Resonair and published by Enhance Games. Development began around 2012 following a discussion between Henk and Enhance CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi about creating a &quot;Tetris&quot; game set to music using virtual reality to reflect the feeling of being &quot;in the zone&quot; while playing &quot;Tetris&quot;. &quot;Tetris Effect&quot; was released on the PlayStation 4 on November 9, 2018, and on Windows on July 23, 2019, receiving widespread critical acclaim for its visuals and emotional impact. &quot;Tetris 99&quot; is a battle royale variant of &quot;Tetris&quot; made available to subscribers of Nintendo Switch Online on February 13, 2019, upon its surprise announcement during Nintendo Direct. It received positive reviews and became Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s killer app; according to President of Nintendo Shuntaro Furukawa, 2.8 million Nintendo Switch Online users played &quot;Tetris 99&quot; within a few months of release.

==Versions==

&quot;Tetris&quot; has been released on a multitude of platforms since the creation of the original version on the Electronika 60. It is available on most game consoles and is playable on personal computers, smartphones and iPods. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; recognized &quot;Tetris&quot; as the most ported video game in history, with over 200 variants having appeared on over 65 different platforms as of October 2010. By 2017, this number had increased to 220 official variants.

Across its multiple versions, &quot;Tetris&quot; core gameplay has remained consistent. Since 1996, the Tetris Company maintains standard specifications for authorized versions of &quot;Tetris&quot; known as the &quot;Tetris Guidelines&quot;. The guidelines are updated annually, and Pajitnov considers the guidelines a baseline for different versions and not &quot;set in stone&quot;. Several game mechanics of &quot;Tetris&quot; have been changed over time. For example, the distribution of tetrominoes was completely randomized in early versions, while modern versions opt for a &quot;bag system&quot;, in which each tetromino is guaranteed to appear in a set of seven. Other mechanics that have become standardized in modern versions include the ability to hold tetrominoes to swap with later pieces, introduced in &quot;The New Tetris&quot; (1999), and the super rotation system and infinite spin, introduced in &quot;Tetris Worlds&quot; (2001).

The earliest versions of &quot;Tetris&quot; had no music. Spectrum Holobyte&#x27;s version of &quot;Tetris&quot; in the United States exoticized the Soviet origins through elements such as Russian music, including Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Trepak&quot; from &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; and Reinhold Glière&#x27;s &quot;Russian Sailor Dance&quot; from &quot;The Red Poppy&quot;. This approached differed from other versions of &quot;Tetris&quot; from other countries at the time: Mirrosoft&#x27;s Commodore 64 version in Europe used an atmospheric soundtrack, and Sega&#x27;s arcade version in Japan used a synthesized pop-influenced soundtrack. Nintendo&#x27;s versions for NES and Game Boy continued the pattern of using Russian music. The NES version uses Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy&quot; from &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; as Music A, with the Russian-influenced Music B and the mellow Music C having unclear origins. The Game Boy version has the 1860s Russian folk tune &quot;Korobeiniki&quot; for Music A, an original composition by Hirokazu Tanaka for Music B, and the Menuet of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;French Suite no. 3&quot; for Music C. &quot;Korobeiniki&quot; has become primarily associated with &quot;Tetris&quot; as its main theme and would be used in most significant versions, as mandated by the Tetris Company guidelines.

== Reception and legacy==
=== Sales ===
In January 2010, EA Mobile and Blue Planet Software announced that mobile versions of &quot;Tetris&quot; since 2005 had reached 100 million paid downloads, making it most-downloaded mobile game at the time. In April 2014, Rogers announced in an interview with &quot;VentureBeat&quot; that &quot;Tetris&quot; totaled 425 million paid mobile downloads and 70 million physical copies. To date, the &quot;Tetris&quot; franchise is the second-best-selling video game franchise of all time, totaling 520 million sales according to the Tetris Company. The majority originate from paid mobile downloads, based on Rogers&#x27; figure from the 2014 interview. As a result, some publications consider &quot;Tetris&quot; the best-selling game of all time, despite variations among the different versions. The most successful version is the Game Boy version, which at 35 million copies is one of the best-selling video games of all time. 

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Tetris&quot; quickly began winning awards once it was released in the West. The Spectrum HoloByte version won three Software Publishers Association Excellence in Software Awards in 1989, including Best Entertainment Program and the Critic&#x27;s Choice Award for consumers. &quot;Macworld&quot; inducted &quot;Tetris&quot; into the 1988 &quot;Macworld&quot; Game Hall of Fame in the Best Strategy Game category. &quot;Macworld&quot; praised &quot;the addictive quality&quot; and said its &quot;simplicity is bewitching.&quot; and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave &quot;Tetris&quot; the 1989 Compute! Choice Award for Arcade Game, describing it as &quot;by far, the most addictive game ever&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named it the eighth-greatest game available in 1991, saying: &quot;Thanks to Nintendo&#x27;s endless promotion, &quot;Tetris&quot; has become one of the most popular video games.&quot;

&quot;Tetris&quot; has been widely ranked as among the greatest video games of all time by &quot;Flux&quot; (1995), &quot;Next Generation&quot; (1996 and 1999), &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (1997), &quot;GameSpot&quot; (2000), &quot;Game Informer&quot; (2001 and 2009), &quot;IGN&quot; (2007 and 2021), &quot;Time&quot; (2012 and 2016), &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; (2015 and 2021), &quot;Polygon&quot; (2017), &quot;USA Today&quot; (2022 and 2024), &quot;The Times&quot; (2023), and &quot;GQ&quot; (2023). &quot;Tetris&quot; has also been ranked as among the best computer games by &quot;PC Format&quot; (1991) and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; (1996), among the best video game franchises by &quot;IGN&quot; (2006) and &quot;Den of Geek&quot; (2024), and among the most influential games of all time by &quot;GamePro&quot; (2007), &quot;IGN&quot; (2007), &quot;1Up.com&quot; (2010), &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; (2013), and &quot;The Guardian&quot; (2017).

&quot;Tetris&quot; has been inducted into the &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; of the following publications: &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; (1999), &quot;GameSpy&quot; (2000), &quot;GameSpot&quot; (2003), and &quot;IGN&quot; (2007). &quot;Tetris&quot; was listed as part of the game canon, announced at the 2007 Game Developers Conference by Henry Lowood of Stanford University as a list of ten games to be considered for preservation by the Library of Congress, modeled after the National Film Preservation Board . In November 2012, the Museum of Modern Art acquired &quot;Tetris&quot;, along with thirteen other video games, to display. As part of the 2015 inaugural class, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;Tetris&quot; into the World Video Game Hall of Fame for its iconic nature.

===Industry impact===
Due to Rogers and Nintendo&#x27;s belief in its potential for mass appeal, &quot;Tetris&quot; was the pack-in title and the primary game promoted for the Game Boy in the United States. The resulting public anticipation led &quot;Tetris&quot; to become the Game Boy&#x27;s main draw, with many, including non-gamers, buying the Game Boy specifically to play &quot;Tetris&quot;. This release simultaneously contributed to both the popularity of &quot;Tetris&quot; and the Game Boy, with the bundle selling out in its initial run of a million copies shortly after release. This success established Nintendo&#x27;s dominant position in the handheld gaming market, setting a standard that competitors struggled to replicate.

&quot;Tetris&quot; is influential in the genre of puzzle video games. Commentators have considered &quot;Tetris&quot; an early example of a casual game, and &quot;1Up.com&quot; credits &quot;Tetris&quot; for establishing a market for puzzle video games with universal appeal. Various common elements of puzzle games, such as managing pieces over a fixed screen, originated from &quot;Tetris&quot;, and multiple clones have been created to replicate &quot;Tetris&quot; popularity. Video games influenced by &quot;Tetris&quot; include Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; (1990), Sega&#x27;s &quot;Columns&quot; (1990), Compile&#x27;s &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; (1991), Taito&#x27;s &quot;Puzzle Bobble&quot; (1994), Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo&quot; (1996), and PopCap Games&#x27; &quot;Bejeweled&quot; (2000).

===Cultural impact===

&quot;Tetris&quot; cultural impact and recognition is widespread with representation in a vast array of media such as architecture, art, and merchandise. &quot;Tetris&quot; has earned other Guinness records, such as the record for &quot;largest architectural video game display&quot;, granted to a version hosted on the side of the 29-story Cira Center in April 2014. &quot;Korobeiniki&quot;, a Russian folk song, has become widely associated with &quot;Tetris&quot; following its inclusion in the Game Boy version. A 1992 Eurodance cover of &quot;Korobeiniki&quot; by Doctor Spin peaked at number six in the UK single charts. &quot;Tetris&quot; is widely seen as a &quot; simple but addictive&quot; game, and has been the subject of academic research in psychology and mathematics. Writers such as Dan Ackerman have attributed the enduring success of &quot;Tetris&quot; to its appeal to casual gamers.

&quot;Tetris&quot; has a competitive scene, primarily centering around the NES version. Competitor Jonas Neubauer and his victory in the inaugural Classic Tetris World Championship (CTWC) in 2010 were the subject of the 2011 documentary &quot;Ecstasy of Order: The Tetris Masters&quot;, which helped popularized competitive gameplay of &quot;Tetris&quot;. Competitors at the CTWC, typically adolescents, have used the CTWC to demonstrate advancements in the gameplay of the NES version. For example, gameplay techniques such as &quot;hypertapping&quot; and &quot;rolling&quot; have been used to help competitors to maximize their scores beyond level 29, which was previously deemed impossible to complete due to its speed. Willis Gibson &quot;beat&quot; Tetris by playing NES &quot;Tetris&quot; until it crashed in a 40-minute livestream in January 2024, receiving significant media coverage for his achievement.

The DIC Entertainment animated series &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot; incorporated elements of &quot;Tetris&quot;, depicting &quot;planet Tetris&quot; in two different episodes as a distant, square-shaped world composed of angular humanoids. In 2014, it was announced that Threshold Entertainment had worked with the Tetris Company to develop a film adaptation. Threshold Entertainment CEO Larry Kasanoff called it an epic sci-fi adventure and the first part of a trilogy. A different film, &quot;Tetris&quot;, about the &quot;Tetris&quot; legal battles in the late 1980s, starring Taron Egerton as Henk Rogers, premiered on Apple TV+ on March 31, 2023, to positive reviews according to Metacritic and a viewership of 88,000 people according to Samba TV.

==Research==
=== Psychological research ===

The psychological and addictive effects of &quot;Tetris&quot; were first scientifically recognized by Soviet clinical psychologist Vladimir Pokhilko 1985. Pokhilko was a recipient of the IBM version of &quot;Tetris&quot; in Moscow. Interested in its potential psychological effects based on his experiences playing the game, Pokhilko distributed copies of &quot;Tetris&quot; to his colleagues at the Moscow Medical Center. Pokhilko regretted his decision after constant gameplay impaired medical research so he proceeded to destroy the distributed copies. After new copies were reintroduced to his facility, Pokhilko used &quot;Tetris&quot; while testing patients. 

Starting with the research of American psychologist Richard J. Haier in 1992, &quot;Tetris&quot; has been frequently used as a form of cognitive assessment and neuroimaging. Furthermore, &quot;Tetris&quot; has been studied as a potential form of psychological intervention such as for PTSD and with promising results. The &quot;&quot;Tetris&quot; effect&quot; refers to the phenomena of perceiving certain patterns in dreams and mental images following engagement in a repetitive activity such as playing &quot;Tetris.&quot; The term was first coined by Jeffrey Goldsmith in a 1994 article for &quot;Wired&quot;, in which he compared &quot;Tetris&quot; to an &quot;electronic drug&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wired/1994/05/tetris&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer science research ===
In 1992, John Brzustowski at the University of British Columbia wrote a thesis on the question of whether or not one could theoretically play &quot;Tetris&quot; forever. He reached the conclusion that &quot;Tetris&quot; is statistically doomed to end. If a player receives a sufficiently large sequence of alternating S and Z tetrominoes, the naïve gravity used by the standard game eventually forces the player to leave holes on the board. The holes will necessarily stack to the top and end the game. If the pieces are distributed randomly, this sequence will eventually occur. Thus, if a game with, for example, an ideal, uniform, uncorrelated random number generator is played long enough, any player will almost surely top out.

In computer science, it is common to analyze the computational complexity of problems, including real-life problems and games. In 2001, a group of MIT researchers proved that for the &quot;offline&quot; version of &quot;Tetris&quot; (the player knows the complete sequence of pieces that will be dropped, i.e. there is no hidden information) the following objectives are NP-complete:
* Maximizing the number of rows cleared while playing the given piece sequence.
* Maximizing the number of pieces placed before a loss occurs.
* Maximizing the number of simultaneous clearing of four rows.
* Minimizing the height of the highest filled grid square over the course of the sequence.

Also, it is difficult to even approximately solve the first, second, and fourth problem. It is NP-hard, given an initial field and a sequence of &quot;p&quot; pieces, to approximate the first two problems to within a factor of for any constant . It is NP-hard to approximate the last problem within a factor of for any constant . To prove NP-completeness, it was shown that there is a polynomial reduction between the 3-partition problem, which is also NP-complete, and the &quot;Tetris&quot; problem.

<text>Pre-Socratic philosophy, also known as Early Greek Philosophy, is ancient Greek philosophy before Socrates. Pre-Socratic philosophers were mostly interested in cosmology, the beginning and the substance of the universe, but the inquiries of these early philosophers spanned the workings of the natural world as well as human society, ethics, and religion. They sought explanations based on natural law rather than the actions of gods. Their work and writing has been almost entirely lost. Knowledge of their views comes from &quot;testimonia&quot;, i.e. later authors&#x27; discussions of the work of pre-Socratics. Philosophy found fertile ground in the ancient Greek world because of the close ties with neighboring civilizations and the rise of autonomous civil entities, &quot;poleis&quot;.

Pre-Socratic philosophy began in the 6th century BC with the three Milesians: Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes. They all attributed the &quot;arche&quot; (a word that could take the meaning of &quot;origin&quot;, &quot;substance&quot; or &quot;principle&quot;) of the world to, respectively, water, &quot;apeiron&quot; (the unlimited), and air. Another three pre-Socratic philosophers came from nearby Ionian towns: Xenophanes, Heraclitus, and Pythagoras. Xenophanes is known for his critique of the anthropomorphism of gods. Heraclitus, who was notoriously difficult to understand, is known for his maxim on impermanence, &quot;ta panta rhei,&quot; and for attributing fire to be the arche of the world. Pythagoras created a cult-like following that advocated that the universe was made up of numbers. The Eleatic school (Parmenides, Zeno of Elea, and Melissus) followed in the 5th century BC. Parmenides claimed that only one thing exists and nothing can change. Zeno and Melissus mainly defended Parmenides&#x27; opinion. Anaxagoras and Empedocles offered a pluralistic account of how the universe was created. Leucippus and Democritus are known for their atomism, and their views that only void and matter exist. The Sophists advanced philosophical relativism. The Pre-Socratics have had significant impact on several concepts of Western philosophy, such as naturalism and rationalism, and paved the way for scientific methodology.

==Terminology==
&quot;Pre-Socratic&quot; is a term adopted in the 19th century to refer to this group of philosophers. It was first used by the German philosopher J.A. Eberhard as &quot;&quot;vorsokratische Philosophie&quot;&#x27; in the late 18th century. In earlier literature they were referred to as &quot;physikoi&quot; (&quot;physicists&quot;, after &quot;physis&quot;, &quot;nature&quot;), and their activity, as &quot;physiologoi&quot; (physical or natural philosophers), with this usage arising with Aristotle to differentiate them from &quot;theologoi&quot; (theologians) and &quot;mythologoi&quot; (storytellers and bards who conveyed Greek mythology), who attributed natural phenomena to the gods.

The term was coined to highlight a fundamental change in philosophical inquiries between the philosophers who lived before Socrates, who were interested in the structure of nature and &quot;cosmos&quot; (i.e., the universe, with the implication that the universe had order to it), and Socrates and his successors, who were mostly interested in ethics and politics. The term comes with drawbacks, as several of the pre-Socratics were highly interested in ethics and how to live the best life. Further, the term implies that the pre-Socratics are less significant than Socrates, or even that they were merely a stage (implying teleology) to classical era philosophy. The term is also chronologically inaccurate, as the last of the pre-Socratics were contemporaries of Socrates.

According to James Warren, the distinction between the pre-Socratic philosophers and philosophers of the classical era is demarcated not so much by Socrates, but by geography and what texts survived. The shift from the pre-Socratic to the classical periods involves a shift from philosophers being dispersed throughout the Greek-speaking world to their being concentrated in Athens. Further, starting in the classical period we have complete surviving texts, whereas in the pre-Socratic era we have only fragments. Scholar distinguishes two traditions of separating pre-Socratics from Socratics, dating back to the classical era and running through current times. The first tradition is the Socratic-Ciceronian, which uses the content of their philosophical inquires to divide the two groups: the pre-Socratics were interested in nature whereas Socrates focused on human affairs. The other tradition, the Platonic-Aristotelian, emphasizes method as the distinction between the two groups, as Socrates moved to a more epistemological approach of studying various concepts. Because of the drawbacks of the term pre-Socratic, &quot;Early Greek Philosophy&quot; is also used, most commonly in Anglo-Saxon literature.

 and Glenn W. Most have especially popularized this shift in describing the era as &quot;Early Greek Philosophy&quot; over &quot;Pre-Socratic Philosophy&quot; through their comprehensive, nine volume Loeb editions of &quot;Early Greek Philosophy&quot;. In their first volume, they distinguish their systematic approach from that of Hermann Diels, beginning with the choice of &quot;Early Greek Philosophy&quot; over &quot;pre-Socratic philosophy&quot; most notably because Socrates is contemporary and sometimes even prior to philosophers traditionally considered &quot;pre-Socratic&quot; (e.g., the Atomists).

== Sources ==

Very few fragments of the works of the pre-Socratic philosophers have survived. The knowledge we have of the pre-Socratics derives from the accounts of later writers such as Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch, Diogenes Laërtius, Stobaeus, and Simplicius, and some early Christian theologians, especially Clement of Alexandria and Hippolytus of Rome. Many of the works are titled &quot;Peri Physeos&quot;, or &quot;On Nature&quot;, a title probably attributed later by other authors. These accounts, known as &quot;testimonia&quot; (testimonies), often come from biased writers. Consequently, it is sometimes difficult to determine the actual line of argument some pre-Socratics used in supporting their views. Adding more difficulty to their interpretation is the obscure language they used. Plato paraphrased the pre-Socratics and showed no interest in accurately representing their views. Aristotle was more accurate, but saw them under the scope of his philosophy. Theophrastus, Aristotle&#x27;s successor, wrote an encyclopedic book &quot;Opinion of the Physicists&quot; that was the standard work about the pre-Socratics in ancient times. It is now lost, but Simplicius relied on it heavily in his accounts.

In 1903, the German professors H. Diels and W. Kranz published &quot;Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker&quot; (&quot;The Fragments of the pre-Socratics&quot;), which collected all of the known fragments. Scholars now use this book to reference the fragments using a coding scheme called Diels–Kranz numbering. The first two characters of the scheme are &quot;DK&quot; for Diels and Kranz. Next is a number representing a specific philosopher. After that is a code regarding whether the fragment is a &quot;testimonia&quot;, coded as &quot;A&quot;, or &quot;B&quot; if is a direct quote from the philosopher. Last is a number assigned to the fragment, which may include a decimal to reflect specific lines of a fragment. For example, &quot;DK59B12.3&quot; identifies line 3 of Anaxagoras fragment 12. A similar way of referring to quotes is the system prefixed with &quot;LM&quot; by André Laks and Glenn W. Most who edited &quot;Early Greek Philosophy&quot; in 2016.

Collectively, these fragments are called &quot;doxography&quot; (derived from the latin &quot;doxographus&quot;; derived from the Greek word for &quot;opinion&quot; &quot;doxa&quot;).

== Historical background ==

Philosophy emerged in ancient Greece in the 6th century BC. The pre-Socratic era lasted about two centuries, during which the expanding Persian Achaemenid Empire was stretching to the west, while the Greeks were advancing in trade and sea routes, reaching Cyprus and Syria. The first pre-Socratics lived in Ionia, on the western coast of Anatolia. Persians conquered the towns of Ionia 540 BC and Persian tyrants then ruled them. The Greeks revolted in 499 BC, but ultimately were defeated in 494 BC. Slowly but steadily Athens became the philosophical center of Greece by the middle of the fifth century. Athens was entering its Classical Era, with philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, but the impact of the pre-Socratics continued.

Several factors contributed to the birth of pre-Socratic philosophy in Ancient Greece. Ionian towns, especially Miletus, had close trade relations with Egypt and Mesopotamia, cultures with observations about the natural world that differed from those of the Greeks. Apart from technical skills and cultural influences, of paramount significance was that the Greeks acquired the alphabet 800 BC.

Another factor was the ease and frequency of intra-Greek travel, which led to the blending and comparison of ideas. During the sixth century BC, various philosophers and other thinkers moved easily around Greece, especially visiting pan-Hellenic festivals. While long-distance communication was difficult during ancient times, persons, philosophers, and books moved through other parts of the Greek peninsula, the Aegean islands, and Magna Graecia, a coastal area in Southern Italy.

The democratic political system of independent &quot;poleis&quot; also contributed to the rise of philosophy. Most Greek towns were not ruled by autocrats or priests, allowing citizens to question freely a wide range of issues. Various &quot;poleis&quot; flourished and became wealthy, especially Miletus. which was a centre of trade and production during the early phases of pre-Socratic philosophy. Trade of grain, oil, wine, and other commodities among each &quot;polis&quot; and colonies meant these towns were not isolated but embedded – and economically dependent – on a complex and changeable web of trade routes.

Greek mythology also influenced the birth of philosophy. The philosophers&#x27; ideas, were, to a certain extent, answers to questions that were subtly present in the work of Homer and Hesiod. The pre-Socratics arose from a world dominated by myths, sacred places, and local deities. The work of epic poets such as Homer, Hesiod and others reflected this environment. They are considered predecessors of the pre-Socratics since they seek to address the origin of the world and to organize traditional folklore and legends systematically. Greek popular religion contained many features of the religions of neighboring civilizations, such as the Egyptians, Mesopotamians, and Hittites. The first pre-Socratic philosophers also traveled extensively to other lands, meaning that pre-Socratic thought had roots abroad as well as domestically.

Homer, in his two epic poems, not only personifies gods and other natural phenomena, such as the Night, but he hints at some views on the origin and the nature of the world that came under scrutiny by the pre-Socratics. In his epic poem &quot;Theogony&quot; (literally meaning the birth of gods) Hesiod (c. 700 BC) describes the origin of gods, and apart from the solid mythical structure, one can notice an attempt towards organizing beliefs using some form of rationalization; an example would be that Night gives birth to Death, Sleep and Dreams. Transmigration of life, a belief of the Orphics, a religious cult originating from Thrace, had affected the thought of the 5th century BC but the overall influence of their cosmology on philosophy is disputed. Pherecydes, a poet, magician, and contemporary of Thales, in his book describes a particular cosmogony, asserting that three gods pre-existed – a step towards rationality.

== General features ==
The most important feature of pre-Socratic philosophy was the use of reason to explain the universe. The pre-Socratic philosophers shared the intuition that there was a single explanation that could explain both the plurality and the singularity of the whole – and that explanation would not be direct actions of the gods. The pre-Socratic philosophers rejected traditional mythological explanations of the phenomena they saw around them in favor of more rational explanations, initiating analytic and critical thought. Their efforts were directed at the investigation of the ultimate basis and essential nature of the external world. Many sought the material principle (&quot;arche&quot;) of things, and the method of their origin and disappearance. They emphasized the rational unity of things and rejected supernatural explanations, seeking natural principles at work in the world and human society. The pre-Socratics saw the world as a &quot;cosmos&quot;, an ordered arrangement that could be understood via rational inquiry. In their effort to make sense of the cosmos they coined new terms and concepts such as rhythm, symmetry, analogy, deductionism, reductionism, mathematization of nature and others.

An important term that is met in the thought of several pre-Socratic philosophers is &quot;arche&quot;. Depending on the context, it can take various related meanings. It could mean the beginning or origin with the undertone that there is an effect on the things to follow. Also, it might mean a principle or a cause (especially in Aristotelian tradition).

A common feature of the pre-Socratics is the absence of empiricism and experimentation in order to prove their theories. This may have been because of a lack of instruments, or because of a tendency to view the world as a unity, undeconstructable, so it would be impossible for an external eye to observe tiny fractions of nature under experimental control.

According to Jonathan Barnes, a professor of ancient philosophy, pre-Socratic philosophy exhibits three significant features: they were &quot;internal&quot;, &quot;systematic&quot; and &quot;economical&quot;. Internal meaning they tried to explain the world with characteristics found within this world. Systematic because they tried to universalize their findings. Economical because they tried to invoke only a few new terms. Based on these features, they reached their most significant achievement, they changed the course of human thought from myth to philosophy and science.

The pre-Socratics were not atheists; however, they minimized the extent of the gods&#x27; involvement in natural phenomena such as thunder or totally eliminated the gods from the natural world.

Pre-Socratic philosophy encompasses the first of the three phases of ancient Greek philosophy, which spanned around a thousand years. The pre-Socratic phase itself is divided into three phases. The first phase of pre-Socratic philosophy, mainly the Milesians, Xenophanes, and Heraclitus, consisted of rejecting traditional cosmogony and attempting to explain nature based on empirical observations and interpretations. A second phase – that of the Eleatics – resisted the idea that change or motion can happen. Based on their radical monism, they believed that only one substance exists and forms Kosmos. The Eleatics were also monists (believing that only one thing exists and everything else is just a transformation of it). In the third phase, the post-Eleatics (mainly Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and Democritus) opposed most Eleatic teaching and returned to the naturalism of the Milesians.

The pre-Socratics were succeeded by the second phase of ancient philosophy, where the philosophical movements of Platonism, Cynicism, Cyrenaicism, Aristotelianism, Pyrrhonism, Epicureanism, Academic skepticism, and Stoicism rose to prominence until 100 BC. In the third phase, philosophers studied their predecessors.

== Pre-Socratic philosophers ==
===Milesian beginning: Thales, Anaximander and Anaximenes===

The Milesian school was located in Miletus, Ionia, in the 6th century BC. It consisted of Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, who most probably had a teacher-pupil relationship. They were mainly occupied with the origin and substance of the world; each of them attributed the Whole to a single &quot;arche&quot; (beginning or principle), starting the tradition of naturalistic monism.

====Thales====
Thales ( 624–546 BC) is considered to be the father of philosophy. None of his writings have survived. He is considered the first western philosopher since he was the first to use reason, to use proof, and to generalize. He created the word &quot;cosmos&quot;, the first word to describe the universe. He contributed to geometry and predicted the eclipse of 585 BC. Thales may have been of Phoenician ancestry. Miletus was a meeting point and trade centre of the then great civilizations, and Thales visited the neighbouring civilizations, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Crete, and Phoenicia. In Egypt, geometry was advanced as a means of separating agricultural fields. Thales, though, advanced geometry with his abstract deductive reasoning reaching universal generalizations. Proclus, a later Athenian philosopher, attributed the theorem now known as Thales&#x27;s theorem to Thales. He is also known for being the first to claim that the base angles of isosceles triangles are equal, and that a diameter bisects the circle. Thales visited Sardis, as many Greeks then, where astronomical records were kept and used astronomical observations for practical matters (oil harvesting). Thales was widely considered a genius in ancient times and was revered as one of the Seven Sages of Greece.

Most importantly, what marks Thales as the first philosopher is the posing of the fundamental philosophical question about the origin and the substance of the world, while providing an answer based on empirical evidence and reasoning. He attributed the origin of the world to an element instead of a divine being. Our knowledge of Thales&#x27; claim derives from Aristotle. Aristotle, while discussing opinions of previous philosophers, tells us that &quot;Thales, the founder of this type of philosophy, says the principle (arche) is water.&quot; What he meant by arche, is a matter of interpretation (it might be the origin, the element, or an ontological matrix), but regardless of the various interpretations, he conceived the world as One thing instead of a collection of various items and speculated on the binding/original elements.

Another important aspect of Thales&#x27; philosophy is his claim that everything is full of gods. What he meant by that is again a matter of interpretation, that could be from a theistic view to an atheist one. But the most plausible explanation, suggested by Aristotle, is that Thales is advocating a theory of hylozoism, that the universe, the sum of all things that exist, is divine and alive. Lastly, another notable claim by Thales is that earth &quot;rests on water&quot;- maybe that was a conclusion after observing fish fossils on land.

====Anaximander====


Anaximander (610–546 BC), also from Miletus, was 25 years younger than Thales. He was a member of the elite of Miletus, wealthy and a statesman. He showed interest in many fields, including mathematics and geography. He drew the first map of the world, was the first to conclude that the earth is spherical, and made instruments to mark time, something like a clock. In response to Thales, he postulated as the first principle an undefined, unlimited substance without qualities (&quot;apeiron&quot;), out of which the primary opposites, hot and cold, moist and dry, became differentiated. His answer was an attempt to explain observable changes by attributing them to a single source that transforms to various elements. Like Thales, he provided a naturalistic explanation for phenomena previously given supernatural explanations. He is also known for speculating on the origin of mankind. He proclaimed that the earth is not situated in another structure but lies unsupported in the middle of the universe. Further, he developed a rudimentary evolutionary explanation for biodiversity in which constant universal powers affected the lives of animals. According to Giorgio de Santillana, a philosophy professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Anaximander&#x27;s conception of a universe governed by laws shaped the philosophical thinking of centuries to come and was as important as the discovery of fire or Einstein&#x27;s breakthroughs in science.

====Anaximenes====
Little is known of Anaximenes&#x27; (585–525 BC) life. He was a younger contemporary and friend of Anaximander, and the two worked together on various intellectual projects. He also wrote a book on nature in prose. Anaximenes took for his principle &quot;aēr&quot; (air), conceiving it as being modified, via thickening and thinning, into the other classical elements: fire, wind, clouds, water, and earth. While his theory resembled that of Anaximander, as they both claimed a single source of the universe, Anaximenes suggested sophisticated mechanisms in which air is transformed to other elements, mainly because of changes of density. Since the classical era, he was considered the father of naturalistic explanations. Anaximenes expanded Anaximander&#x27;s attempt to find a unitary cause explaining natural phenomena both living and nonliving, without, according to James Warren, having to &quot;reduce living things in some way to mere locations of material change&quot;.

=== Xenophanes ===

Xenophanes was born in Colophon, an Ionian town near Miletus. He was a well-traveled poet whose primary interests were theology and epistemology. Concerning theology, he pointed out that we did not know whether there was one god or many gods, or in such case whether there was a hierarchy among them. To critique the anthropomorphic representation of the gods by his contemporary Greeks, he pointed out that different nations depicted their gods as looking like themselves. He famously said that if oxen, horses, or lions could draw, they would draw their gods as oxen, horses, or lions. This critique was not limited to the looks of gods but also their behaviour. Greek mythology, mostly shaped by the poets Homer and Hesiod, attributed moral failures such as jealousy and adultery to the gods. Xenophanes opposed this. He thought gods must be morally superior to humans. Xenophanes, however, never claimed the gods were omnipotent, omnibenevolent, or omniscient. Xenophanes also offered naturalistic explanations for phenomena such as the sun, the rainbow and St. Elmo&#x27;s fire. Traditionally these were attributed to divine intervention but according to Xenophanes they were actually effects of clouds. These explanations of Xenophanes indicate empiricism in his thought and might constitute a kind of proto-scientism. Scholars have overlooked his cosmology and naturalism since Aristotle (maybe due to Xenophanes&#x27; lack of teleology) until recently but current literature suggests otherwise. Concerning epistemology, Xenophanes questioned the validity of human knowledge. Humans usually tend to assert their beliefs are real and represent truth. While Xenophanes was a pessimist about the capability of humans to reach knowledge, he also believed in gradual progress through critical thinking. Xenophanes tried to find naturalistic explanations for meteorological and cosmological phenomena.

Ancient philosophy historian Alexander Mourelatos notes Xenophanes used a pattern of thought that is still in use by modern metaphysics. Xenophanes, by reducing meteorological phenomena to clouds, created an argument that &quot;X in reality is Y&quot;, for example B32, &quot;What they call Iris [the rainbow] that too is in reality a cloud: one that
appears to the eye as purple, red, and green. This is still use[d] today &#x27;lightning is massive electrical discharge&#x27; or &#x27;items such as tables are a cloud of micro-particles&#x27;.&quot; Mourelatos comments that the type of analogy that the cloud analogy is remains present in scientific language and &quot;...is the modern philosopher&#x27;s favourite subject for illustrations of inter-theoretic identity&quot;.

According to Aristotle and Diogenes Laertius, Xenophanes was Parmenides&#x27; teacher; but is a matter of debate in current literature whether Xenophanes should also be considered an Eleatic.

===Heraclitus===
The hallmark of Heraclitus&#x27; philosophy is flux. In fragment DK B30, Heraclitus writes: &quot;This world-order [Kosmos], the same of all, no god nor man did create, but it ever was and is and will be: everliving fire, kindling in measures and being quenched in measures&quot;. Heraclitus posited that all things in nature are in a state of perpetual flux. Like previous monist philosophers, Heraclitus claimed that the &quot;arche&quot; of the world was fire, which was subject to change – that makes him a materialist monist. From fire all things originate and all things return to it again in a process of eternal cycles. Fire becomes water and earth and vice versa. These everlasting modifications explain his view that the cosmos &quot;was and is and will be&quot;. The idea of continual flux is also met in the &quot;river fragments&quot;. There, Heraclitus claims we can not step into the same river twice, a position summarized with the slogan &quot;ta panta rhei&quot; (everything flows). One fragment reads: &quot;Into the same rivers we both step and do not step; we both are and are not&quot; (DK 22 B49a). Heraclitus is seemingly suggesting that not only the river is constantly changing, but we do as well, even hinting at existential questions about humankind.

Another key concept of Heraclitus is that opposites somehow mirror each other, a doctrine called unity of opposites. Two fragments relating to this concept state, &quot;As the same thing in us is living and dead, waking and sleeping, young and old. For these things having changed around are those, and those in turn having changed around are these&quot; (B88) and &quot;Cold things warm up, the hot cools off, wet becomes dry, dry becomes wet&quot; (B126). Heraclitus&#x27; doctrine on the unity of opposites suggests that unity of the world and its various parts is kept through the tension produced by the opposites. Furthermore, each polar substance contains its opposite, in a continual circular exchange and motion that results in the stability of the cosmos. Another of Heraclitus&#x27; famous axioms highlights this doctrine (B53): &quot;War is father of all and king of all; and some he manifested as gods, some as men; some he made slaves, some free&quot;, where war means the creative tension that brings things into existence.

A fundamental idea in Heraclitus is &quot;logos&quot;, an ancient Greek word with a variety of meanings; Heraclitus might have used a different meaning of the word with each usage in his book. &quot;Logos&quot; seems like a universal law that unites the cosmos, according to a fragment: &quot;Listening not to me but to the logos, it is wise to agree (homologein) that all things are one&quot; (DK 22 B50). While &quot;logos&quot; is everywhere, very few people are familiar with it. B 19 reads: [hoi polloi] &quot;...do not know how to listen [to Logos] or how to speak [the truth]&quot;. Heraclitus&#x27; thought on &quot;logos&quot; influenced the Stoics, who referred to him to support their belief that rational law governs the universe.

=== Pythagoreanism ===


Pythagoras (582–496 BC) was born on Samos, a small island near Miletus. He moved to Croton at about age 30, where he established his school and acquired political influence. Some decades later he had to flee Croton and relocate to Metapontum.

Pythagoras was famous for studying numbers and the geometrical relations of numbers. A large following of Pythagoreans adopted and extended his doctrine. They advanced his ideas, reaching the claim that everything consists of numbers, the universe is made by numbers and everything is a reflection of analogies and geometrical relations. Numbers, music and philosophy, all interlinked, could comfort the beauty-seeking human soul and hence Pythagoreans espoused the study of mathematics.

Pythagorianism perceived the world as perfect harmony, dependent on number, and aimed at inducing humankind likewise to lead a harmonious life, including ritual and dietary recommendations. Their way of life was ascetic, restraining themselves from various pleasures and food. They were vegetarians and placed enormous value on friendship. Pythagoras politically was an advocate of a form of aristocracy, a position which later Pythagoreans rejected, but generally, they were reactionary and notably repressed women. Other pre-Socratic philosophers mocked Pythagoras for his belief in reincarnation.

Notable Pythagorians included Philolaus (470-380 BC), Alcmaeon of Croton, Archytas (428-347 BC) and Echphantus. The most notable was Alcmaeon, a medical and philosophical writer. Alcmaeon noticed that most organs in the body come in pairs and suggested that human health depends on harmony between opposites (hot/cold, dry/wet), and illness is due to an imbalance of them. He was the first to think of the brain as the center of senses and thinking. Philolaus advanced cosmology through his discovery of heliocentricism – the idea that the Sun lies in the middle of the Earth&#x27;s orbit and other planets.

Pythagoreanism influenced later Christian currents as Neoplatonism, and its pedagogical methods were adapted by Plato. Furthermore, there seems to be a continuity in some aspects of Plato&#x27;s philosophy. As Carl A. Huffman notes, Plato had a tendency to invoke mathematics in explaining natural phenomena, and he also believed in the immortality, even divinity of the human soul.

===The Eleatics: Parmenides, Zeno and Melissus ===

The Eleatic school is named after Elea, an ancient Greek town on the southern Italian Peninsula. Parmenides is considered the founder of the school. Other eminent Eleatics include Zeno of Elea and Melissus of Samos. According to Aristotle and Diogenes Laertius, Xenophanes was Parmenides&#x27; teacher, and it is debated whether Xenophanes should also be considered an Eleatic. Parmenides was born in Elea to a wealthy family around 515 BC. Parmenides of Elea was interested in many fields, such as biology and astronomy. He was the first to deduce that the earth is spherical. He was also involved in his town&#x27;s political life.
Parmenides&#x27; contributions were paramount not only to ancient philosophy but to all of western metaphysics and ontology. Parmenides wrote a hard to interpret poem, named &quot;On Nature&quot; or &quot;On What-is&quot;, that substantially influenced later Greek philosophy. Only 150 fragments of this poem survive. It tells a story of a young man (&quot;kouros&quot; in ancient Greek) dedicated to finding the truth carried by a goddess on a long journey to the heavens. The poem consists of three parts, the proem (i.e., preface), the &quot;Way of Truth&quot; and the &quot;Way of Opinion&quot;. Very few pieces from the &quot;Way of Opinion&quot; survive. In that part, Parmenides must have been dealing with cosmology, judging from other authors&#x27; references. The &quot;Way of Truth&quot; was then, and is still today, considered of much more importance. In the &quot;Way of Truth&quot;, the goddess criticizes the logic of people who do not distinguish the real from the non-existent (&quot;What-is&quot; and &quot;What-is-Not&quot;). In this poem Parmenides unfolds his philosophy: that all things are One, and therefore nothing can be changed or altered. Hence, all the things that we think to be true, even ourselves, are false representations. What-is, according to Parmenides, is a physical sphere that is unborn, unchanged, and infinite. This is a monist vision of the world, far more radical than that of Heraclitus. The goddess teaches Kouros to use his reasoning to understand whether various claims are true or false, discarding senses as fallacious. Other fundamental issues raised by Parmenides&#x27; poem are the doctrine that nothing comes from nothing and the unity of being and thinking. As quoted by DK fragment 3: &quot;To gar auto noein estin te kai einai&quot; (For to think and to be is one and the same).

Zeno and Melissus continued Parmenides&#x27; thought on cosmology. Zeno is mostly known for his paradoxes, i.e., self-contradictory statements which served as proofs that Parmenides&#x27; monism was valid, and that pluralism was invalid. The most common theme of those paradoxes involved traveling a distance, but since that distance comprises infinite points, the traveler could never accomplish it. His most famous is the Achilles paradox, which is mentioned by Aristotelis: &quot;The second is called the &#x27;Achilles&#x27; and says that the slowest runner will never be caught by the fastest, because it is necessary for the pursuer first to arrive at the point from which the pursued set off, so it is necessary that the slower will always be a little ahead.&quot; (Aristotle Phys. 239b14–18 [DK 29 A26]) Melissus defended and advanced Parmenides&#x27; theory using prose, without invoking divinity or mythical figures. He tried to explain why humans think various non-existent objects exist.

The Eleatics&#x27; focus on Being through means of logic initiated the philosophical discipline of ontology. Other philosophers influenced by the Eleatics (such as the Sophists, Plato, and Aristotle) further advanced logic, argumentation, mathematics and especially &quot;elenchos&quot; (proof). The Sophists even placed Being under the scrutiny of elenchos. Because of the Eleatics reasoning was acquiring a formal method.

===The Pluralists: Anaxagoras and Empedocles===

The Pluralist school marked a return to Milesian natural philosophy, though much more refined because of Eleatic criticism.

Anaxagoras was born in Ionia, but was the first major philosopher to emigrate to Athens. He was soon associated with the Athenian statesman Pericles and, probably due to this association, was accused by a political opponent of Pericles for impiety as Anaxagoras held that the sun was not associated with divinity; it was merely a huge burning stone. Pericles helped Anaxagoras flee Athens and return to Ionia. Anaxagoras was also a major influence on Socrates.

Anaxagoras is known for his &quot;theory of everything&quot;. He claimed that &quot;in everything there is a share of everything.&quot; Interpretations differ as to what he meant. Anaxagoras was trying to stay true to the Eleatic principle of the everlasting (What-is) while also explaining the diversity of the natural world. Anaxagoras accepted Parmenides&#x27; doctrine that everything that exists (What-is) has existed forever, but contrary to the Eleatics, he added the ideas of &quot;panspermia&quot; and &quot;nous&quot;. All objects were mixtures of various elements, such as air, water, and others. One special element was &quot;nous&quot;, i.e., mind, which is present in living things and causes motion. 

According to Anaxagoras, &quot;Nous&quot; was one of the elements that make up the cosmos. Things that had &quot;nous&quot; were alive. According to Anaxagoras, all things are composites of some basic elements; although it is not clear what these elements are. All objects are a mixture of these building blocks and have a portion of each element, except &quot;nous&quot;. &quot;Nous&quot; was also considered a building block of the cosmos, but it exists only in living objects. Anaxagoras writes: &quot;In everything there is a portion (&quot;moira&quot;) of everything except mind (&quot;nous&quot;), but there are some things in which mind too is present.&quot; &quot;Nous&quot; was not just an element of things, somehow it was the cause of setting the universe into motion. Anaxagoras advanced Milesian thought on epistemology, striving to establish an explanation that could be valid for all natural phenomena. Influenced by the Eleatics, he also furthered the exploration of metatheoretical questions such as the nature of knowledge.

Empedocles was born in Akragas, a town in the southern Italian peninsula. According to Diogenes Laertius, Empedocles wrote two books in the form of poems: &quot;Peri Physeos&quot; (On nature) and the &quot;Katharmoi&quot; (Purifications). Some contemporary scholars argue these books might be one; all agree that interpreting Empedocles is difficult.

On cosmological issues, Empedocles takes from the Eleatic school the idea that the universe is unborn, has always been and always will be. He also continues Anaxagoras&#x27; thought on the four &quot;roots&quot; (i.e., classical elements), that by intermixing, they create all things around us. These roots are fire, air, earth, and water. Crucially, he adds two more components, the immaterial forces of love and strife. These two forces are opposite and by acting upon the material of the four roots unite in harmony or tear apart the four roots, with the resulting mixture being all things that exist. Empedocles uses an analogy of how this is possible: as a painter uses a few basic colors to create a painting, the same happens with the four roots. It is not quite clear if love and strife co-operate or have a greater plan, but love and strife are in a continual cycle that generates life. Other beings, apart from the four roots and love and strife, according to Empedocles&#x27; &quot;Purifications&quot; are mortals, gods, and daemons. Like Pythagoras, Empedocles believed in the soul&#x27;s transmigration and was vegetarian.

===Atomists: Leucippus and Democritus ===

&quot;Democritus&quot; by [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], 1628. Democritus was known as the &quot;laughing philosopher&quot;

Leucippus and Democritus both lived in Abdera, in Thrace. They are most famous for their atomic cosmology even though their thought included many other fields of philosophy, such as ethics, mathematics, aesthetics, politics, and even embryology.

The atomic theory of Leucippus and Democritus was a response to the Eleatic school, who held that motion is not possible because everything is occupied with What-is. Democritus and Leucippus reverted the Eleatic axiom, claiming that since motions exist, What-is-not must also exist; hence void exists. Democritus and Leucippus were skeptics regarding the reliability of our senses, but they were confident that motion exists. Atoms, according to Democritus and Leucippus, had some characteristics of the Eleatic What-is: they were homogeneous and indivisible. These characteristics allowed answers to Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes. Atoms move within the void, interact with each other, and form the plurality of the world we live in, in a purely mechanical manner.

One conclusion of the Atomists was determinism - the philosophical view that all events are determined completely by previously existing causes. As Leucippus said, (DK 67 B2) &quot;Nothing comes to be random but everything is by reason and out of necessity.&quot; Democritus concluded that since everything is atoms and void, several of our senses are not real but conventional. Color, for example, is not a property of atoms; hence our perception of color is a convention. As Democritus said, (DK 68 B9) &quot;By convention sweet, by convention bitter, by convention hot, by convention cold, by convention colour; in reality atoms and void.&quot; This can be interpreted in two ways. According to James Warren there is an eliminativist interpretation, such that Democritus means that color is not real, and there is a relativist interpretation, such that Democritus means that color and taste are not real but are perceived as such by our senses through sensory interaction.

===Sophists===
The sophists were a philosophical and educational movement that flourished in ancient Greece before Socrates. They attacked traditional thinking, from gods to morality, paving the way for further advances of philosophy and other disciplines such as drama, social sciences, mathematics, and history.

Plato disparaged the sophists, causing long-lasting harm to their reputation. Plato thought philosophy should be reserved for those who had the appropriate intellect to understand it; whereas the sophists would teach anyone who would pay tuition. The sophists taught rhetoric and how to address issues from multiple viewpoints. Since the sophists and their pupils were persuasive speakers at court or in public, they were accused of moral and epistemological relativism, which indeed some sophists appeared to advocate. Prominent sophists include Protagoras, Gorgias, Hippias, Thrasymachus, Prodicus, Callicles, Antiphon, and Critias.

Protagoras is mostly known for two of his quotes. One is that &quot;[humans are..] &quot;the measure of all things, of things that are that they are, of things that are not that they are not&quot;&quot; which is commonly interpreted as affirming philosophical relativism, but it can also be interpreted as claiming that knowledge is only relevant to humankind, that moral rightness and other forms of knowledge are relevant to and limited to human mind and perception. The other quote is, &quot;Concerning the gods, I cannot ascertain whether they exist or whether they do not, or what form they have; for there are many obstacles to knowing, including the obscurity of the question and the brevity of human life.&quot;

Gorgias wrote a book named &quot;On Nature,&quot; in which he attacked the Eleatics&#x27; concepts of What-is and What-is-not. He claimed it is absurd to hold that nonexistence exists, and that What-is was impossible since it had to either be generated or be unlimited and neither is sufficient. There is an ongoing debate among modern scholars whether he was a serious thinker, a precursor of extreme relativism and skepticism, or merely a charlatan.

Antiphon placed natural law against the law of the city. One need not obey the city&#x27;s laws as long as one will not get caught. One could argue that Antiphon was a careful hedonist—rejecting dangerous pleasures.

=== Philolaous of Croton and Diogenes of Apollonia ===
Philolaus of Croton and Diogenes of Apollonia from Thrace (born 460 BC) are considered the last generation of pre-Socratics. Rather than advancing a cosmological perspective on how our universe is constructed, they are mostly noted for advancing abstract thinking and argumentation.
Pythagorianism, Anaxagoras and Empedocles influenced Philolaus. He attempted to explain both the variety and unity of the cosmos. He addressed the need to explain how the various masses of the universe interact among them and coined the term &quot;Harmonia&quot;, a binding force that allows mass to take shape. The structure of the cosmos consisted of &quot;apeira&quot; (unlimiteds) and &quot;perainonta&quot; (limiters).
Diogenes of Apollonia returned to Milesian monism, but with a rather more elegant thought. As he says in DK64 B2 &quot;It seems to me, overall, that all things are alterations of the same things and are the same thing&quot;. He explains that things, even when changing shapes, remain ontologically the same.

==Topics==
===Knowledge===
The &quot;mythologoi&quot;, Homer and Hesiod, along with other poets, centuries before the pre-Socratics, thought that true knowledge was exclusive to the divine. But starting with Xenophanes, the pre-Socratics moved towards a more natural approach to knowledge. The pre-Socratics sought a method to understand the cosmos, while being aware that there is a limit to human knowledge.

While Pythagoras and Empedocles linked their self-proclaimed wisdom to their divinely inspired status, they tried to teach or urge mortals to seek the truth about the natural realm—Pythagoras by means of mathematics and geometry and Empedocles by exposure to experiences. Xenophanes thought that human knowledge was merely an opinion that cannot be validated or proven to be true. According to Jonathan Warren, Xenophanes set the outline of the nature of knowledge. Later, Heraclitus and Parmenides stressed the capability of humans to understand how things stand in nature through direct observation, inquiry, and reflection.

=== Theology ===
Pre-Socratic thought contributed to the demythologization of the Greek popular religion. The narrative of their thought contributed to shifting the course of ancient Greek philosophy and religion away from the realm of divinity and even paved the way for teleological explanations. They attacked the traditional representations of gods that Homer and Hesiod had established and put Greek popular religion under scrutiny, initiating the schism between natural philosophy and theology. Pre-Socratic philosophers did not have atheistic beliefs, but it should be kept in mind that being an atheist those days was not without social or legal dangers. Despite that, arguments rejecting deities were not barred from the public sphere which can be seen in Protagoras&#x27;s quotation on the gods: &quot;About the gods I am able to know neither that they exist nor that they do not exist.&quot;

The theological thought starts with the Milesian philosophers. It is evident in Anaximander&#x27;s idea of the &quot;apeiron&quot; steering everything, which had other abilities usually attributed to Zeus. Later, Xenophanes developed a critique of the anthropomorphism of the gods. Xenophanes set three preconditions for God: he had to be all good, immortal and not resembling humans in appearance, which had a major impact on western religious thought.

The theological thought of Heraclitus and Parmenides is not entirely certain, but it is generally accepted that they believed in some kind of divinity. The Pythagoreans and Empedocles believed in the transmigration of souls. Anaxagoras asserted that cosmic intelligence (&quot;nous&quot;) gives life to things. Diogenes of Appollonia expanded this line of thinking and might have constructed the first teleological argument &quot;it would not be possible without Intellection for it so to be divided up that it has the measures of all things — of winter and summer and night and day and rains and winds and fair weather. The other things, too, if one wishes to consider them, one would find disposed of in the best possible way.&quot; While some pre-Socratics were trying to find alternatives to divinity, others were setting the foundation of explaining the universe in terms of teleology and intelligent design by a divine force.

===Medicine===
Prior to the pre-Socratics, health and illness were thought to be governed by gods. Pre-Socratic philosophy and medicine advanced in parallel, with medicine as a part of philosophy and vice versa. It was Hippocrates (often hailed as the father of medicine) who separated – but not completely – the two domains. Physicians incorporated pre-Socratic philosophical ideas about the nature of the world in their theoretical framework, blurring the border between the two domains. An example is the study of epilepsy, which in popular religion was thought to be a divine intervention to human life, but Hippocrates&#x27; school attributed it to nature, just as Milesian rationalism demythologized other natural phenomena such as earthquakes. The systematic study of anatomy, physiology, and illnesses led to the discovery of cause-effect relations and a more sophisticated terminology and understanding of the diseases that ultimately yielded rational science.

===Cosmology===
The pre-Socratics were the first to attempt to provide reductive explanations for a plethora of natural phenomena.

Firstly, they were preoccupied with the mystery of the cosmic matter—what was the basic substance of the universe? Anaximander suggested &quot;apeiron&quot; (limitless), which hints, as Aristotle analyzed, there is no beginning and no end to it, both chronologically and within the space. Anaximenes placed &quot;aêr&quot; (air) as the primary principle, probably after realizing the importance of air to life and/or the need to explain various observable changes. Heraclitus, also seeking to address the issue of the ever changing world, placed fire as the primary principle of the universe, that transforms to water and earth to produce the universe. Ever-transforming nature is summarized by Heraclitus&#x27; axiom &quot;panta rhei&quot; (everything is in a state of flux). Parmenides suggested two ever-lasting primary building blocs, night and day, which together form the universe. Empedocles increased the building blocks to four and named them roots, while also adding Love and Strife, to serve as the driving force for the roots to mingle. Anaxagoras extended even more the plurality of Empedocles, claiming everything is in everything, myriads of substances were mixing among each other except one, &quot;Nous&quot; (mind) that orchestrates everything—but did not attribute divine characteristics to &quot;Nous&quot;. Leucippus and Democritus asserted the universe consists of atoms and void, while the motion of atoms is responsible for the changes we observe.

=== Rationalism, observation and the beginning of scientific thought ===

The pre-Socratic intellectual revolution is widely considered to have been the first step towards liberation of the human mind from the mythical world and initiated a march towards reason and scientific thought that yielded modern western philosophy and science. The pre-Socratics sought to understand the various aspects of nature by means of rationalism, observations, and offering explanations that could be deemed as scientific, giving birth to what became Western rationalism. Thales was the first to seek for a unitary arche of the world. Whether arche meant the beginning, the origin, the main principle or the basic element is unclear, but was the first attempt to reduce the explanations of the universe to a single cause, based on reason and not guided by any sort of divinity. Anaximander offered the principle of sufficient reason, a revolutionary argument that would also yield the principle that nothing comes out of nothing. Most of pre-Socratics seemed indifferent to the concept of teleology, especially the Atomists who fiercely rejected the idea. According to them, the various phenomena were the consequence of the motion of atoms without any purpose. Xenophanes also advanced a critique of anthropomorphic religion by highlighting in a rational way the inconsistency of depictions of the gods in Greek popular religion.

Undoubtedly, pre-Socratics paved the way towards science, but whether what they did could constitute science is a matter of debate. Thales had offered the first account of a reduction and a generalization, a significant milestone towards scientific thought. Other pre-Socratics also sought to answer the question of arche, offering various answers, but the first step towards scientific thought was already taken. Philosopher Karl Popper, in his seminal work &quot;Back to Presocratics&quot; (1958) traces the roots of modern science (and the West) to the early Greek philosophers. He writes: &quot;There can be little doubt that the Greek tradition of philosophical criticism had its main source in Ionia ... It thus leads the tradition which created the rational or scientific attitude, and with it our Western civilization, the only civilization, which is based upon science (though, of course, not upon science alone).&quot; Elsewhere in the same study Popper diminishes the significance of the label they should carry as purely semantics. &quot;There is the most perfect possible continuity of thought between [the Presocratics&#x27;] theories and the later developments in physics. Whether they are called philosophers, or pre-scientists, or scientists, matters very little.&quot; Other scholars did not share the same view. F. M. Cornford considered the Ionanians as dogmatic speculators, due to their lack of empiricism.

== Reception and legacy ==

=== Antiquity ===
The pre-Socratics had a direct influence on classical antiquity in many ways. The philosophic thought produced by the pre-Socratics heavily influenced later philosophers, historians and playwrights. One line of influence was the Socrato-Ciceronian tradition, while the other was the Platonic-Aristotelian.

Socrates, Xenophon and Cicero were highly influenced by the &quot;physiologoi&quot; (naturalists) as they were named in ancient times. The naturalists impressed young Socrates and he was interested in the quest for the substance of the cosmos, but his interest waned as he became steadily more focused on epistemology, virtue, and ethics rather than the natural world. According to Xenophon, the reason was that Socrates believed humans incapable of comprehending the cosmos. Plato, in the &quot;Phaedo&quot;, claims that Socrates was uneasy with the materialistic approach of the pre-Socratics, particularly Anaxagoras. Cicero analyzed his views on the pre-Socratics in his &quot;Tusculanae Disputationes&quot;, as he distinguished the theoretical nature of pre-Socratic thought from previous &quot;sages&quot; who were interested in more practical issues. Xenophon, like Cicero, saw the difference between pre-Socratics and Socrates being his interest in human affairs (&quot;ta anthropina&quot;).

The pre-Socratics deeply influenced both Plato and Aristotle. Aristotle discussed the pre-Socratics in the first book of &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, as an introduction to his own philosophy and the quest for &quot;arche&quot;. He was the first to state that philosophy starts with Thales. It is not clear whether Thales talked of water as &quot;arche&quot;, or that was a retrospective interpretation by Aristotle, who was examining his predecessors under the scope of his views. More crucially, Aristotle criticized the pre-Socratics for not identifying a purpose as a final cause, a fundamental idea in Aristotelian metaphysics. Plato also attacked pre-Socratic materialism.

Later, during the Hellenistic era, philosophers of various currents focused on the study of nature and advanced pre-Socratic ideas. The Stoics incorporated features from Anaxagoras and Heraclitus, such as &quot;nous&quot; and fire respectively. The Epicureans saw Democritus&#x27; atomism as their predecessor while the Sceptics were linked to Xenophanes.

=== Modern era ===

The pre-Socratics, along with the rest of ancient Greece, invented the central concepts of Western civilization: freedom, democracy, individual autonomy and rationalism. Francis Bacon, a 16th-century philosopher known for advancing the scientific method, was probably the first philosopher of the modern era to use pre-Socratic axioms extensively in his texts. He criticized the pre-Socratic theory of knowledge by Xenophanes and others, claiming that their deductive reasoning could not yield meaningful results—an opinion contemporary philosophy of science rejects. Bacon&#x27;s fondness for the pre-Socratics, especially Democritus&#x27; atomist theory, might have been because of his anti-Aristotelianism.

Friedrich Nietzsche admired the pre-Socratics deeply, calling them &quot;tyrants of the spirit&quot; to mark their antithesis and his preference against Socrates and his successors. Nietzsche also weaponized pre-Socratic antiteleology, coupled with the materialism exemplified by Democritus, for his attack on Christianity and its morals. Nietzsche saw the pre-Socratics as the first ancestors of contemporary science—linking Empedocles to Darwinism and Heraclitus to physicist Helmholtz. According to his narrative, limned in many of his books, the pre-Socratic era was the glorious era of Greece, while the so-called Golden Age that followed was an age of decay. Nietzsche incorporated the pre-Socratics in his Apollonian and Dionysian dialectics, with them representing the creative Dionysian aspect of the duo. 

Martin Heidegger found the roots of his phenomenology and later thinking of Things and the Fourfold in the pre-Socratics, considering Anaximander, Parmenides, and Heraclitus as the original thinkers on being, which he identified in their work as &quot;physis&quot; [φύσις] (emergence, contrasted against κρύπτεσθαι, kryptesthai, in Heraclitus&#x27; Fragment 123) or &quot;aletheia&quot; [αλήθεια] (truth as unconcealment).

<text>Transliteration is a type of conversion of a text from one script to another that involves swapping letters (thus &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;) in predictable ways, such as Greek → , Cyrillic → , Greek → the digraph , Armenian → or Latin → .

For instance, for the Greek term , which is usually translated as &#x27;Hellenic Republic&#x27;, the usual transliteration into the Latin script (romanization) is ; and the Russian term , which is usually translated as &#x27;Russian Republic&#x27;, can be transliterated either as or alternatively as .

Transliteration is the process of representing or intending to represent a word, phrase, or text in a different script or writing system. Transliterations are designed to convey the pronunciation of the original word in a different script, allowing readers or speakers of that script to approximate the sounds and pronunciation of the original word. Transliterations do not change the pronunciation of the word. Thus, in the Greek above example, is transliterated though it is pronounced exactly the same way as , or the Greek letters, . is transliterated though pronounced as , and is transliterated , though it is pronounced (exactly like ) and is not long.

Transcription, conversely, seeks to capture sound, but phonetically approximate it into the new script; corresponds to in the International Phonetic Alphabet. While differentiation is lost in the case of , note the allophonic realization of as a palatalized when preceding front vowels and .

Angle brackets may be used to set off transliteration, as opposed to slashes for phonemic transcription and square brackets for phonetic transcription. Angle brackets may also be used to set off characters in the original script. Conventions and author preferences vary.

==Definitions==
Systematic transliteration is a mapping from one system of writing into another, typically grapheme to grapheme. Most transliteration systems are one-to-one, so a reader who knows the system can reconstruct the original spelling.

Transliteration, which adapts written form altering the pronunciation when spoken out, is opposed to letter transcription, which is a &quot;letter by letter conversion&quot; of one language into &quot;another writing system&quot;. Still, most systems of transliteration map the letters of the source script to letters pronounced similarly in the target script, for some specific pair of source and target language. Transliteration may be very close to letter-by-letter transcription if the relations between letters and sounds are similar in both languages.

For many script pairs, there are one or more standard transliteration systems. However, unsystematic transliteration is common, as for Burmese, for instance.

==Difference from transcription==
In Modern Greek, the letters ⟨η, ι, υ⟩ and the letter combinations ⟨ει, oι, υι⟩ are pronounced (except when pronounced as semivowels), and a modern transcription renders them as ⟨i⟩. However, a transliteration distinguishes them; for example, by transliterating them as ⟨ē, i, y⟩ and ⟨ei, oi, yi⟩. (As the ancient pronunciation of ⟨η⟩ was , it is often transliterated as ⟨ē⟩.) On the other hand, ⟨αυ, ευ, ηυ⟩ are pronounced , and are voiced to when followed by a voiced consonant – a shift from Ancient Greek . A transliteration would render them all as ⟨au, eu, iu⟩ no matter the environment these sounds are in, reflecting the traditional orthography of Ancient Greek, yet a transcription would distinguish them, based on their phonemic allophonic pronunciations in Modern Greek. Furthermore, the initial letter ⟨h⟩ reflecting the historical rough breathing ⟨ ̔⟩ in words such as ⟨Hellēnikḗ⟩ would intuitively be omitted in transcription for Modern Greek, as Modern Greek no longer has the sound.

==Challenges==
A simple example of difficulties in transliteration is the Arabic letter qāf. It is pronounced, in literary Arabic, approximately like English [k], except that the tongue makes contact not on the soft palate but on the uvula, but the pronunciation varies between different dialects of Arabic. The letter is sometimes transliterated into &quot;g&quot;, sometimes into &quot;q&quot; or (for in Egypt it is silent) and rarely even into &quot;k&quot; in English. Another example is the Russian letter &quot;Х&quot; (kha). It is pronounced as the voiceless velar fricative , like the Scottish pronunciation of in &quot;loch&quot;. This sound is not present in most forms of English and is often transliterated as &quot;kh&quot; as in Nikita Khrushchev. Many languages have phonemic sounds, such as click consonants, which are quite unlike any phoneme in the language into which they are being transliterated.

Some languages and scripts present particular difficulties to transcribers. These are discussed on separate pages. Examples of languages and writing systems and methods of transliterating include:

<text>The Torah ( or ; , &quot;Instruction&quot;, &quot;Teaching&quot; or &quot;Law&quot;) is the compilation of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, namely the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. The Torah is also known as the Pentateuch () or the Five Books of Moses. In Rabbinical Jewish tradition it is also known as the Written Torah (, ). If meant for liturgic purposes, it takes the form of a Torah scroll ( &quot;Sefer Torah&quot;). If in bound book form, it is called &quot;Chumash&quot;, and is usually printed with the rabbinic commentaries ().

In rabbinic literature, the word &quot;Torah&quot; denotes both the five books ( &quot;Torah that is written&quot;) and the Oral Torah (, &quot;Torah that is spoken&quot;). It has also been used, however, to designate the entire Hebrew Bible. The Oral Torah consists of interpretations and amplifications which according to rabbinic tradition have been handed down from generation to generation and are now embodied in the Talmud and Midrash. Rabbinic tradition&#x27;s understanding is that all of the teachings found in the Torah (both written and oral) were given by God through the prophet Moses, some at Mount Sinai and others at the Tabernacle, and all the teachings were written down by Moses, which resulted in the Torah that exists today. According to the Midrash, the Torah was created prior to the creation of the world, and was used as the blueprint for Creation. Though hotly debated, the general trend in biblical scholarship is to recognize the final form of the Torah as a literary and ideological unity, based on earlier sources, largely complete by the Persian period, with possibly some later additions during the Hellenistic period.

The words of the Torah are written on a scroll by a scribe (sofer) in Hebrew. A Torah portion is read every Monday morning and Thursday morning at a shul (synagogue) but only if there are ten males above the age of thirteen. Reading the Torah publicly is one of the bases of Jewish communal life. The Torah is also considered a sacred book outside Judaism; in Samaritanism, the Samaritan Pentateuch is a text of the Torah written in the Samaritan script and used as sacred scripture by the Samaritans; the Torah is also common among all the different versions of the Christian Old Testament; in Islam, the &quot;Tawrat&quot; () is the Arabic name for the Torah within its context as an Islamic holy book believed by Muslims to have been given by God to the prophets and messengers amongst the Children of Israel.

==Meaning and names==
The word &quot;Torah&quot; in Hebrew is derived from the root , which in the &quot;hif&#x27;il&quot; conjugation means &#x27;to guide&#x27; or &#x27;to teach&#x27;. The meaning of the word is therefore &quot;teaching&quot;, &quot;doctrine&quot;, or &quot;instruction&quot;; the commonly accepted &quot;law&quot; gives a wrong impression. The Alexandrian Jews who translated the Septuagint used the Greek word &quot;nomos&quot;, meaning norm, standard, doctrine, and later &quot;law&quot;. Greek and Latin Bibles then began the custom of calling the Pentateuch (five books of Moses) The Law. Other translational contexts in the English language include custom, theory, guidance, or system.

The term &quot;Torah&quot; is used in the general sense to include both Rabbinic Judaism&#x27;s written and oral law, serving to encompass the entire spectrum of authoritative Jewish religious teachings throughout history, including the Oral Torah which comprises the Mishnah, the Talmud, the Midrash and more. The inaccurate rendering of &quot;Torah&quot; as &quot;Law&quot; may be an obstacle to understanding the ideal that is summed up in the term &quot;talmud torah&quot; (, &quot;study of Torah&quot;). The term &quot;Torah&quot; is also used to designate the entire Hebrew Bible.

The earliest name for the first part of the Bible seems to have been &quot;The Torah of Moses&quot;. This title, however, is found neither in the Torah itself, nor in the works of the pre-Exilic literary prophets. It appears in Joshua and Kings, but it cannot be said to refer there to the entire corpus (according to academic Bible criticism). In contrast, there is every likelihood that its use in the post-Exilic works was intended to be comprehensive. Other early titles were &quot;The Book of Moses&quot; and &quot;The Book of the Torah&quot;, which seems to be a contraction of a fuller name, &quot;The Book of the Torah of God&quot;.

===Alternative names===
Scholars usually refer to the first five books of the Hebrew Bible as the &#x27;Pentateuch&#x27; (, ; , , &#x27;five scrolls&#x27;), a term first used in the Hellenistic Judaism of Alexandria.

The &quot;Tawrat&quot; (also Tawrah or Taurat; ) is the Arabic name for the Torah, which Muslims believe is an Islamic holy book given by God to the prophets and messengers amongst the Children of Israel.

==Contents==
The Torah starts with God creating the world, then describes the beginnings of the people of Israel, their descent into Egypt, and the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. It ends with the death of Moses, just before the people of Israel cross to the Promised Land of Canaan. Interspersed in the narrative are the specific teachings (religious obligations and civil laws) given explicitly (i.e. Ten Commandments) or implicitly embedded in the narrative (as in Exodus 12 and 13 laws of the celebration of Passover).

In Hebrew, the five books of the Torah are identified by the incipits in each book; and the common English names for the books are derived from the Greek Septuagint and reflect the essential theme of each book:

* &quot;Bəreshit&quot; (, literally &quot;In the beginning&quot;)—Genesis, from (, &quot;Creation&quot;)
* &quot;Shəmot&quot; (, literally &quot;Names&quot;)—Exodus, from (, &quot;Exit&quot;)
* &quot;Vayikra&quot; (, literally &quot;And He called&quot;)—Leviticus, from (, &quot;Relating to the Levites&quot;) 
* &quot;Bəmidbar&quot; (, literally &quot;In the desert [of]&quot;)—Numbers, from (, &quot;Numbers&quot;)
* &quot;Dəvarim&quot; (, literally &quot;Things&quot; or &quot;Words&quot;)—Deuteronomy, from (, &quot;Second-Law&quot;)

===Genesis===
The Book of Genesis is the first book of the Torah. It is divisible into two parts, the Primeval history (chapters 1–11) and the Ancestral history (chapters 12–50). The primeval history sets out the author&#x27;s (or authors&#x27;) concepts of the nature of the deity and of humankind&#x27;s relationship with its maker: God creates a world which is good and fit for mankind, but when man corrupts it with sin God decides to destroy his creation, using the flood, saving only the righteous Noah and his immediate family to reestablish the relationship between man and God. The Ancestral history (chapters 12–50) tells of the prehistory of Israel, God&#x27;s chosen people. At God&#x27;s command Noah&#x27;s descendant Abraham journeys from his home into the God-given land of Canaan, where he dwells as a sojourner, as does his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob. Jacob&#x27;s name is changed to Israel, and through the agency of his son Joseph, the children of Israel descend into Egypt, 70 people in all with their households, and God promises them a future of greatness. Genesis ends with Israel in Egypt, ready for the coming of Moses and the Exodus. The narrative is punctuated by a series of covenants with God, successively narrowing in scope from all mankind (the covenant with Noah) to a special relationship with one people alone (Abraham and his descendants through Isaac and Jacob).

===Exodus===
The Book of Exodus is the second book of the Torah, immediately following Genesis. The book tells how the ancient Israelites leave slavery in Egypt through the strength of Yahweh, the God who has chosen Israel as his people. Yahweh inflicts horrific harm on their captors via the legendary Plagues of Egypt. With the prophet Moses as their leader, they journey through the wilderness to Mount Sinai, where Yahweh promises them the land of Canaan (the &quot;Promised Land&quot;) in return for their faithfulness. Israel enters into a covenant with Yahweh who gives them their laws and instructions to build the Tabernacle, the means by which he will come from heaven and dwell with them and lead them in a holy war to possess the land, and then give them peace.

Traditionally ascribed to Moses himself, modern scholarship sees the book as initially a product of the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE), from earlier written and oral traditions, with final revisions in the Persian post-exilic period (5th century BCE). Carol Meyers, in her commentary on Exodus suggests that it is arguably the most important book in the Bible, as it presents the defining features of Israel&#x27;s identity: memories of a past marked by hardship and escape, a binding covenant with God, who chooses Israel, and the establishment of the life of the community and the guidelines for sustaining it.

===Leviticus===
The Book of Leviticus begins with instructions to the Israelites on how to use the Tabernacle, which they had just built (Leviticus 1–10). This is followed by rules of clean and unclean (Leviticus 11–15), which includes the laws of slaughter and animals permissible to eat (see also: Kashrut), the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16), and various moral and ritual laws sometimes called the Holiness Code (Leviticus 17–26). Leviticus 26 provides a detailed list of rewards for following God&#x27;s commandments and a detailed list of punishments for not following them. Leviticus 17 establishes sacrifices at the Tabernacle as an everlasting ordinance, but this ordinance is altered in later books with the Temple being the only place in which sacrifices are allowed.

===Numbers===

The Book of Numbers is the fourth book of the Torah. The book has a long and complex history, but its final form is probably due to a Priestly redaction (i.e., editing) of a Yahwistic source made some time in the early Persian period (5th century BCE). The name of the book comes from the two censuses taken of the Israelites.

Numbers begins at Mount Sinai, where the Israelites have received their laws and covenant from God and God has taken up residence among them in the sanctuary. The task before them is to take possession of the Promised Land. The people are counted and preparations are made for resuming their march. The Israelites begin the journey, but they &quot;murmur&quot; at the hardships along the way, and about the authority of Moses and Aaron. For these acts, God destroys approximately 15,000 of them through various means. They arrive at the borders of Canaan and send spies into the land. Upon hearing the spies&#x27; fearful report concerning the conditions in Canaan, the Israelites refuse to take possession of it. God condemns them to death in the wilderness until a new generation can grow up and carry out the task. The book ends with the new generation of Israelites in the &quot;plains of Moab&quot; ready for the crossing of the Jordan River.

Numbers is the culmination of the story of Israel&#x27;s exodus from oppression in Egypt and their journey to take possession of the land God promised their fathers. As such it draws to a conclusion the themes introduced in Genesis and played out in Exodus and Leviticus: God has promised the Israelites that they shall become a great (i.e. numerous) nation, that they will have a special relationship with Yahweh their god, and that they shall take possession of the land of Canaan. Numbers also demonstrates the importance of holiness, faithfulness and trust: despite God&#x27;s presence and his priests, Israel lacks faith and the possession of the land is left to a new generation.

===Deuteronomy===
The Book of Deuteronomy is the fifth book of the Torah. Chapters 1–30 of the book consist of three sermons or speeches delivered to the Israelites by Moses on the plains of Moab, shortly before they enter the Promised Land. The first sermon recounts the forty years of wilderness wanderings which had led to that moment, and ends with an exhortation to observe the law (or teachings), later referred to as the Law of Moses; the second reminds the Israelites of the need to follow Yahweh and the laws (or teachings) he has given them, on which their possession of the land depends; and the third offers the comfort that even should Israel prove unfaithful and so lose the land, with repentance all can be restored. The final four chapters (31–34) contain the Song of Moses, the Blessing of Moses, and narratives recounting the passing of the mantle of leadership from Moses to Joshua and, finally, the death of Moses on Mount Nebo.

Presented as the words of Moses delivered before the conquest of Canaan, a broad consensus of modern scholars see its origin in traditions from Israel (the northern kingdom) brought south to the Kingdom of Judah in the wake of the Assyrian conquest of Aram (8th century BCE) and then adapted to a program of nationalist reform in the time of Josiah (late 7th century BCE), with the final form of the modern book emerging in the milieu of the return from the Babylonian captivity during the late 6th century BCE. Many scholars see the book as reflecting the economic needs and social status of the Levite caste, who are believed to have provided its authors; those likely authors are collectively referred to as the Deuteronomist.

One of its most significant verses is Deuteronomy 6:4, the Shema Yisrael, which has become the definitive statement of Jewish identity: &quot;Hear, O Israel: the  our God, the is one.&quot; Verses 6:4–5 were also quoted by Jesus in Mark 12:28–34 as part of the Great Commandment.

==Composition==
The Talmud states that the Torah was written by Moses, with the exception of the last eight verses of Deuteronomy, describing his death and burial, being written by Joshua. According to the Mishnah one of the essential tenets of Judaism is that God transmitted the text of the Torah to Moses over the span of the 40 years the Israelites were in the desert and Moses was like a scribe who was dictated to and wrote down all of the events, the stories and the commandments.

According to Jewish tradition, the Torah was recompiled by Ezra during Second Temple period. The Talmud says that Ezra changed the script used to write the Torah from the older Hebrew script to the &quot;Assyrian&quot; script, so called according to the Talmud, because they brought it with them from Assyria. Maharsha says that Ezra made no changes to the actual text of the Torah based on the Torah&#x27;s prohibition of making any additions or deletions to the Torah in Deuteronomy 12:32.

By contrast, the modern scholarly consensus rejects Mosaic authorship, and affirms that the Torah has multiple authors and that its composition took place over centuries. The precise process by which the Torah was composed, the number of authors involved, and the date of each author are hotly contested. Throughout most of the 20th century, there was a scholarly consensus surrounding the documentary hypothesis, which posits four independent sources, which were later compiled together by a redactor: J, the Jahwist source, E, the Elohist source, P, the Priestly source, and D, the Deuteronomist source. The earliest of these sources, J, would have been composed in the late 7th or the 6th century BCE, with the latest source, P, being composed around the 5th century BCE.

The consensus around the documentary hypothesis collapsed in the last decades of the 20th century. The groundwork was laid with the investigation of the origins of the written sources in oral compositions, implying that the creators of J and E were collectors and editors and not authors and historians. Rolf Rendtorff, building on this insight, argued that the basis of the Pentateuch lay in short, independent narratives, gradually formed into larger units and brought together in two editorial phases, the first Deuteronomic, the second Priestly. By contrast, John Van Seters advocates a supplementary hypothesis, which posits that the Torah was derived from a series of direct additions to an existing corpus of work. A &quot;neo-documentarian&quot; hypothesis, which responds to the criticism of the original hypothesis and updates the methodology used to determine which text comes from which sources, has been advocated by biblical historian Joel S. Baden, among others. Such a hypothesis continues to have adherents in Israel and North America.

The majority of scholars today continue to recognize Deuteronomy as a source, with its origin in the law-code produced at the court of Josiah as described by De Wette, subsequently given a frame during the exile (the speeches and descriptions at the front and back of the code) to identify it as the words of Moses. However, since the 1990s, the biblical description of Josiah&#x27;s reforms (including his court&#x27;s production of a law-code) have become heavily debated among academics. Most scholars also agree that some form of Priestly source existed, although its extent, especially its end-point, is uncertain. The remainder is called collectively non-Priestly, a grouping which includes both pre-Priestly and post-Priestly material.

===Date of compilation===
The final Torah is widely seen as a product of the Persian period (539–332 BCE, probably 450–350 BCE). This consensus echoes a traditional Jewish view which gives Ezra, the leader of the Jewish community on its return from Babylon, a pivotal role in its promulgation. Many theories have been advanced to explain the composition of the Torah, but two have been especially influential. The first of these, Persian Imperial authorisation, advanced by Peter Frei in 1985, holds that the Persian authorities required the Jews of Jerusalem to present a single body of law as the price of local autonomy. Frei&#x27;s theory was, according to Eskenazi, &quot;systematically dismantled&quot; at an interdisciplinary symposium held in 2000, but the relationship between the Persian authorities and Jerusalem remains a crucial question. The second theory, associated with Joel P. Weinberg and called the &quot;Citizen-Temple Community&quot;, proposes that the Exodus story was composed to serve the needs of a post-exilic Jewish community organised around the Temple, which acted in effect as a bank for those who belonged to it.

A minority of scholars would place the final formation of the Pentateuch somewhat later, in the Hellenistic (332–164 BCE) or even Hasmonean (140–37 BCE) periods. Russell Gmirkin, for instance, argues for a Hellenistic dating on the basis that the Elephantine papyri, the records of a Jewish colony in Egypt dating from the last quarter of the 5th century BCE, make no reference to a written Torah, the Exodus, or to any other biblical event, though it does mention the festival of Passover.

==Adoption of Torah law==


In his seminal &quot;Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels&quot;, Julius Wellhausen argued that Judaism as a religion based on widespread observance of the Torah and its laws first emerged in 444 BCE when, according to the biblical account provided in the Book of Nehemiah (chapter 8), a priestly scribe named Ezra read a copy of the Mosaic Torah before the populace of Judea assembled in a central Jerusalem square. Wellhausen believed that this narrative should be accepted as historical because it sounds plausible, noting: &quot;The credibility of the narrative appears on the face of it.&quot; Following Wellhausen, most scholars throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries have accepted that 

More recently, Yonatan Adler has argued that in fact there is no surviving evidence to support the notion that the Torah was widely known, regarded as authoritative, and put into practice prior to the middle of the 2nd century BCE. Adler explored the likelihhood that Judaism, as the widespread practice of Torah law by Jewish society at large, first emerged in Judea during the reign of the Hasmonean dynasty, centuries after the putative time of Ezra. By contrast, John J. Collins has argued that the observance of the Torah started in Persian Yehud when the Judeans who returned from exile understood its normativity as the observance of selected, ancestral laws of high symbolic value, while during the Maccabean revolt Jews started a much more detailed observance of its precepts.

==Significance in Judaism==

===Traditional views on authorship===
Rabbinic writings state that the Oral Torah was given to Moses at Mount Sinai, which, according to the tradition of Orthodox Judaism, occurred in 1312 BCE. The Orthodox rabbinic tradition holds that the Written Torah was recorded during the following forty years, though many non-Orthodox Jewish scholars affirm the modern scholarly consensus that the Written Torah has multiple authors and was written over centuries.

All classical rabbinic views hold that the Torah was entirely Mosaic and of divine origin. Present-day Reform and Liberal Jewish movements all reject Mosaic authorship, as do most shades of Conservative Judaism.

===Ritual use===

Torah reading () is a Jewish religious ritual that involves the public reading of a set of passages from a Torah scroll. The term often refers to the entire ceremony of removing the Torah scroll (or scrolls) from the ark, chanting the appropriate excerpt with traditional cantillation, and returning the scroll(s) to the ark. It is distinct from academic Torah study.

Regular public reading of the Torah was introduced by Ezra the Scribe after the return of the Jewish people from the Babylonian captivity (), as described in the Book of Nehemiah. In the modern era, adherents of Orthodox Judaism practice Torah-reading according to a set procedure they believe has remained unchanged in the two thousand years since the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem (70 CE). In the 19th and 20th centuries CE, new movements such as Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism have made adaptations to the practice of Torah reading, but the basic pattern of Torah reading has usually remained the same:

As a part of the morning prayer services on certain days of the week, fast days, and holidays, as well as part of the afternoon prayer services of Shabbat, Yom Kippur, a section of the Pentateuch is read from a Torah scroll. On Shabbat (Saturday) mornings, a weekly section (&quot;parashah&quot;) is read, selected so that the entire Pentateuch is read consecutively each year. The division of &quot;parashot&quot; found in the modern-day Torah scrolls of all Jewish communities (Ashkenazic, Sephardic, and Yemenite) is based upon the systematic list provided by Maimonides in Mishneh Torah, &quot;Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and Torah Scrolls&quot;, chapter 8. Maimonides based his division of the for the Torah on the Aleppo Codex. Conservative and Reform synagogues may read &quot;parashot&quot; on a triennial rather than annual schedule, On Saturday afternoons, Mondays, and Thursdays, the beginning of the following Saturday&#x27;s portion is read. On Jewish holidays, the beginnings of each month, and fast days, special sections connected to the day are read.

Jews observe an annual holiday, Simchat Torah, to celebrate the completion and new start of the year&#x27;s cycle of readings.

Torah scrolls are often dressed with a sash, a special Torah cover, various ornaments, and a (crown), although such customs vary among synagogues. Congregants traditionally stand in respect when the Torah is brought out of the ark to be read, while it is being carried, and lifted, and likewise while it is returned to the ark, although they may sit during the reading itself.

===Biblical law===
The Torah contains narratives, statements of law, and statements of ethics. Collectively these laws, usually called biblical law or commandments, are sometimes referred to as the Law of Moses (&quot;Torat Moshɛ&quot; ), Mosaic Law, or Sinaitic Law.

==The Oral Torah==

Rabbinic tradition holds that Moses learned the whole Torah while he lived on Mount Sinai for 40 days and nights and both the Oral and the written Torah were transmitted in parallel with each other. Where the Torah leaves words and concepts undefined, and mentions procedures without explanation or instructions, the reader is required to seek out the missing details from supplemental sources known as the Oral Law or Oral Torah. Some of the Torah&#x27;s most prominent commandments needing further explanation are:

* Tefillin: As indicated in Deuteronomy 6:8 among other places, tefillin are to be placed on the arm and on the head between the eyes. However, there are no details provided regarding what tefillin are or how they are to be constructed.
* Kashrut: As indicated in Exodus 23:19 among other places, a young goat may not be boiled in its mother&#x27;s milk. In addition to numerous other problems with understanding the ambiguous nature of this law, there are no vowelization characters in the Torah; they are provided by the oral tradition. This is particularly relevant to this law, as the Hebrew word for &quot;milk&quot; (חלב) is identical to the word for &quot;animal fat&quot; when vowels are absent. Without the oral tradition, it is not known whether the violation is in mixing meat with milk or with fat.
* Shabbat laws: With the severity of Sabbath violation, namely the death penalty, one would assume that direction would be provided as to how exactly such a serious and core commandment should be upheld. However, most information regarding the rules and traditions of Shabbat are dictated in the Talmud and other books deriving from Jewish oral law.

According to classical rabbinic texts this parallel set of material was originally transmitted to Moses at Sinai, and then from Moses to Israel. At that time it was forbidden to write and publish the oral law, as any writing would be incomplete and subject to misinterpretation and abuse.

However, after exile, dispersion, and persecution, this tradition was lifted when it became apparent that in writing was the only way to ensure that the Oral Law could be preserved. After many years of effort by a great number of tannaim, the oral tradition was written down around 200 CE by Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi, who took up the compilation of a nominally written version of the Oral Law, the Mishnah (). Other oral traditions from the same time period not entered into the Mishnah were recorded as &quot;Baraitot&quot; (external teaching), and the Tosefta. Other traditions were written down as Midrashim.

After continued persecution more of the Oral Law was committed to writing. A great many more lessons, lectures and traditions only alluded to in the few hundred pages of Mishnah, became the thousands of pages now called the &quot;Gemara&quot;. Gemara is written in Aramaic (specifically Jewish Babylonian Aramaic), having been compiled in Babylon. The Mishnah and Gemara together are called the Talmud. The rabbis in the Land of Israel also collected their traditions and compiled them into the Jerusalem Talmud. Since the greater number of rabbis lived in Babylon, the Babylonian Talmud has precedence should the two be in conflict.

Orthodox and Conservative branches of Judaism accept these texts as the basis for all subsequent &quot;halakha&quot; and codes of Jewish law, which are held to be normative. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism deny that these texts, or the Torah itself for that matter, may be used for determining normative law (laws accepted as binding) but accept them as the authentic and only Jewish version for understanding the Torah and its development throughout history. Humanistic Judaism holds that the Torah is a historical, political, and sociological text, but does not believe that every word of the Torah is true, or even morally correct. Humanistic Judaism is willing to question the Torah and to disagree with it, believing that the entire Jewish experience, not just the Torah, should be the source for Jewish behavior and ethics.

==Divine significance of letters, Jewish mysticism==


Kabbalists hold that not only do the words of Torah give a divine message, but they also indicate a far greater message that extends beyond them. Thus they hold that even as small a mark as a &quot;kotso shel yod&quot; (), the serif of the Hebrew letter &quot;yod&quot; (י), the smallest letter, or decorative markings, or repeated words, were put there by God to teach scores of lessons. This is regardless of whether that yod appears in the phrase &quot;I am the LORD thy God&quot; (, Exodus 20:2) or whether it appears in &quot;And God spoke unto Moses saying&quot; ( Exodus 6:2). In a similar vein, Rabbi Akiva (), is said to have learned a new law from every &quot;et&quot; () in the Torah (Talmud, tractate Pesachim 22b); the particle &quot;et&quot; is meaningless by itself, and serves only to mark the direct object. In other words, the Orthodox belief is that even apparently contextual text such as &quot;And God spoke unto Moses saying ...&quot; is no less holy and sacred than the actual statement.

==Production and use of a Torah scroll==


Manuscript Torah scrolls are still scribed and used for ritual purposes (i.e., religious services); this is called a &quot;Sefer Torah&quot; (&quot;Book [of] Torah&quot;). They are written using a painstakingly careful method by highly qualified scribes. It is believed that every word, or marking, has divine meaning and that not one part may be inadvertently changed lest it lead to error. The fidelity of the Hebrew text of the Tanakh, and the Torah in particular, is considered paramount, down to the last letter: translations or transcriptions are frowned upon for formal service use, and transcribing is done with painstaking care. An error of a single letter, ornamentation, or symbol of the 304,805 stylized letters that make up the Hebrew Torah text renders a Torah scroll unfit for use, hence a special skill is required and a scroll takes considerable time to write and check.

According to Jewish law, a &quot;sefer Torah&quot; (plural: &quot;Sifrei Torah&quot;) is a copy of the formal Hebrew text handwritten on &quot;gevil&quot; or &quot;klaf&quot; (forms of parchment) by using a quill (or other permitted writing utensil) dipped in ink. Written entirely in Hebrew, a &quot;sefer Torah&quot; contains 304,805 letters, all of which must be duplicated precisely by a trained &quot;sofer&quot; (&quot;scribe&quot;), an effort that may take as long as approximately one and a half years. Most modern Sifrei Torah are written with forty-two lines of text per column (Yemenite Jews use fifty), and very strict rules about the position and appearance of the Hebrew letters are observed. See for example the Mishnah Berurah on the subject. Any of several Hebrew scripts may be used, most of which are fairly ornate and exacting.

The completion of the Sefer Torah is a cause for great celebration, and it is a mitzvah for every Jew to either write or have written for him a Sefer Torah. Torah scrolls are stored in the holiest part of the synagogue in the Ark known as the &quot;Holy Ark&quot; ( &quot;aron hakodesh&quot; in Hebrew.) &quot;Aron&quot; in Hebrew means &quot;cupboard&quot; or &quot;closet&quot;, and &quot;kodesh&quot; is derived from &quot;kadosh&quot;, or &quot;holy&quot;.

==Torah translations==
===Aramaic===
The Book of Ezra refers to translations and commentaries of the Hebrew text into Aramaic, the more commonly understood language of the time. These translations would seem to date to the 6th century BCE. The Aramaic term for &quot;translation&quot; is &quot;Targum&quot;. The &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot; has: 

However, there is no suggestion that these translations had been written down as early as this. There are suggestions that the Targum was written down at an early date, although for private use only. 

===Greek===
One of the earliest known translations of the first five books of Moses from the Hebrew into Greek was the Septuagint. This is a Koine Greek version of the Hebrew Bible that was used by Greek speakers. This Greek version of the Hebrew Scriptures dates from the 3rd century BCE, originally associated with Hellenistic Judaism. It contains both a translation of the Hebrew and additional and variant material.

Later translations into Greek include seven or more other versions. These do not survive, except as fragments, and include those by Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion.

===Latin===
Early translations into Latin—the Vetus Latina—were ad hoc conversions of parts of the Septuagint. With Saint Jerome in the 4th century CE came the Vulgate Latin translation of the Hebrew Bible.

===Arabic===
From the eighth century CE, the cultural language of Jews living under Islamic rule became Arabic rather than Aramaic. &quot;Around that time, both scholars and lay people started producing translations of the Bible into Judeo-Arabic using the Hebrew alphabet.&quot; Later, by the 10th century, it became essential for a standard version of the Bible in Judeo-Arabic. The best known was produced by Saadiah (the Saadia Gaon, aka the Rasag), and continues to be in use today, &quot;in particular among Yemenite Jewry&quot;.

Rav Sa&#x27;adia produced an Arabic translation of the Torah known as &quot;Targum Tafsir&quot; and offered comments on Rasag&#x27;s work. There is a debate in scholarship whether Rasag wrote the first Arabic translation of the Torah.

===Modern languages===

====Jewish translations====
The Torah has been translated by Jewish scholars into most of the major European languages, including English, German, Russian, French, Spanish and others. The most well-known German-language translation was produced by Samson Raphael Hirsch. A number of Jewish English Bible translations have been published, for example by Artscroll publications.

====Christian translations====
As a part of the Christian biblical canons, the Torah has been translated into hundreds of languages.

==In other religions==

===Samaritanism===

The Samaritan Torah (, ), also called the &quot;Samaritan Pentateuch&quot;, is the scripture of Samaritanism, which is slightly different from the Torah of Judaism. The &quot;Samaritan Pentateuch&quot; was written in the Samaritan script, a direct descendant of the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet that emerged around 600 BCE. Some 6,000 differences exist between the Samaritan and Jewish Masoretic Text, most of which are minor spelling and grammar variations, while others involve significant semantic changes, such as the uniquely Samaritan commandment to construct an altar on Mount Gerizim. Nearly 2,000 textual variations are found to be consistent with the Koine Greek Septuagint, some with the Latin Vulgate. It is reported that Samaritans translated their Pentateuch into Aramaic, Greek and Arabic.

===Christianity===
Although different Christian denominations have slightly different versions of the Old Testament in their Bibles, the Torah as the &quot;Five Books of Moses&quot; (or &quot;the Mosaic Law&quot;) is common among them all.

===Islam===
Islam states that the Torah was sent by God. The &quot;Tawrat&quot; () is the Arabic name for the Torah within its context as an Islamic holy book believed by Muslims to be given by God to Prophets among the Children of Israel, and often refers to the entire Hebrew Bible. According to the Quran, God says, &quot;It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Quran) to you with truth, confirming what came before it. And He sent down the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel).&quot; (Q3:3) However, the Muslims believe that this original revelation was corrupted (&quot;tahrif&quot;) (or simply altered by the passage of time and human fallibility) over time by Jewish scribes. The Torah in the Quran is always mentioned with respect in Islam. The Muslims&#x27; belief in the Torah, as well as the prophethood of Moses, is one of the fundamental tenets of Islam.

The Islamic methodology of () refers to interpreting the Qur&#x27;an with/through the Bible. This approach adopts canonical Arabic versions of the Bible, including the Torah, both to illuminate and to add exegetical depth to the reading of the Qur&#x27;an. Notable Muslim (commentators) of the Bible and Qur&#x27;an who weaved from the Torah together with Qur&#x27;anic ones include Abu al-Hakam Abd al-Salam bin al-Isbili of Al-Andalus and Ibrahim bin Umar bin Hasan al-Biqa&#x27;i.

<text>The Hebrew Bible or Tanakh (; Hebrew: , or ) also known in Hebrew as Miqra (; Hebrew: ), is the canonical collection of Hebrew scriptures, comprising the Torah, the Nevi&#x27;im, and the Ketuvim. Different branches of Judaism and Samaritanism have maintained different versions of the canon, including the 3rd-century BCE Septuagint text used in Second Temple Judaism, the Syriac Peshitta, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and most recently the 10th-century medieval Masoretic Text compiled by the Masoretes, currently used in Rabbinic Judaism. The terms &quot;Hebrew Bible&quot; or &quot;Hebrew Canon&quot; are frequently confused with the Masoretic Text; however, this is a medieval version and one of several texts considered authoritative by different types of Judaism throughout history. The current edition of the Masoretic Text is mostly in Biblical Hebrew, with a few passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel and Ezra, and the verse Jeremiah 10:11).

The authoritative form of the modern Hebrew Bible used in Rabbinic Judaism is the Masoretic Text (7th to 10th century CE), which consists of 24 books, divided into chapters and &quot;pesuqim&quot; (verses). The Hebrew Bible developed during the Second Temple Period, as the Jews decided which religious texts were of divine origin; the Masoretic Text, compiled by the Jewish scribes and scholars of the Early Middle Ages, comprises the Hebrew and Aramaic 24 books that they considered authoritative. The Hellenized Greek-speaking Jews of Alexandria produced a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible called &quot;the Septuagint&quot;, that included books later identified as the Apocrypha, while the Samaritans produced their own edition of the Torah, the Samaritan Pentateuch. According to the Dutch–Israeli biblical scholar and linguist Emanuel Tov, professor of Bible Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, both of these ancient editions of the Hebrew Bible differ significantly from the medieval Masoretic Text.

In addition to the Masoretic Text, modern biblical scholars seeking to understand the history of the Hebrew Bible use a range of sources. These include the Septuagint, the Syriac language Peshitta translation, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Dead Sea Scrolls collection, the Targum Onkelos, and quotations from rabbinic manuscripts. These sources may be older than the Masoretic Text in some cases and often differ from it. These differences have given rise to the theory that yet another text, an Urtext of the Hebrew Bible, once existed and is the source of the versions extant today. However, such an Urtext has never been found, and which of the three commonly known versions (Septuagint, Masoretic Text, Samaritan Pentateuch) is closest to the Urtext is debated.

There are many similarities between the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. The Protestant Old Testament includes the same books as the Hebrew Bible, but the books are arranged in different orders. The Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Assyrian churches include the Deuterocanonical books, which are not included in certain versions of the Hebrew Bible. In Islam, the &quot;Tawrat&quot; () is identified not only with the &quot;Pentateuch&quot; (the five books of Moses), but also with the other books of the Hebrew Bible.

== Terminology ==

=== Tanakh ===
&quot;Tanakh&quot; is an acronym, made from the first Hebrew letter of each of the Masoretic Text&#x27;s three traditional divisions: Torah (literally &#x27;Instruction&#x27; or &#x27;Law&#x27;), Nevi&#x27;im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings)—hence TaNaKh.

The three-part division reflected in the acronym &quot;Tanakh&quot; is well attested in the rabbinic literature. During that period, however, &quot;Tanakh&quot; was not used. Instead, the proper title was &quot;Mikra&quot; (or &quot;Miqra&quot;, מקרא, meaning &quot;reading&quot; or &quot;that which is read&quot;) because the biblical texts were read publicly. The acronym &#x27;Tanakh&#x27; is first recorded in the medieval era. &quot;Mikra&quot; continues to be used in Hebrew to this day, alongside Tanakh, to refer to the Hebrew scriptures. In modern spoken Hebrew, they are interchangeable.

=== Hebrew Bible ===
Many biblical studies scholars advocate use of the term &quot;Hebrew Bible&quot; (or &quot;Hebrew Scriptures&quot;) as a substitute for less-neutral terms with Jewish or Christian connotations (e.g., &quot;Tanakh&quot; or &quot;Old Testament&quot;). The Society of Biblical Literature&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of Style&quot;, which is the standard for major academic journals like the &quot;Harvard Theological Review&quot; and conservative Protestant journals like the &quot;Bibliotheca Sacra&quot; and the &quot;Westminster Theological Journal&quot;, suggests that authors &quot;be aware of the connotations of alternative expressions such as ... Hebrew Bible [and] Old Testament&quot; without prescribing the use of either.

&quot;Hebrew&quot; refers to the original language of the books, but it may also be taken as referring to the Jews of the Second Temple era and their descendants, who preserved the transmission of the Masoretic Text up to the present day. The Hebrew Bible includes small portions in Aramaic (mostly in the books of Daniel and Ezra), written and printed in Aramaic square-script, which was adopted as the Hebrew alphabet after the Babylonian exile.

== Content ==

===Genres and themes===
The Tanakh includes a variety of genres, including narratives of events set in the past. The Torah (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy) contains legal material. The Book of Psalms is a collection of hymns, but songs are included elsewhere in the Tanakh, such as Exodus 15, 1 Samuel 2, and Jonah 2. Books such as Proverbs and Ecclesiastes are examples of wisdom literature.

Other books are examples of prophecy. In the prophetic books, a prophet denounces evil or predicts what God will do in the future. A prophet might also describe and interpret visions. The Book of Daniel is the only book in the Tanakh usually described as apocalyptic literature. However, other books or parts of books have been called proto-apocalyptic, such as Isaiah 24–27, Joel, and Zechariah 9–14.

A central theme throughout the Tanakh is monotheism, worshiping one God. The Tanakh was created by the Israelites, a people who lived within the cultural and religious context of the ancient Near East. The religions of the ancient Near East were polytheistic, but the Israelites rejected polytheism in favor of monotheism. Biblical scholar Christine Hayes writes that the Hebrew Bible was &quot;the record of [the Israelites&#x27;] religious and cultural revolution&quot;.

According to biblical scholar John Barton, &quot;YHWH is consistently presented throughout the [Hebrew Scriptures] as the God who created the world, and as the only God with whom Israel is to be concerned&quot;. This special relationship between God and Israel is described in terms of covenant. As part of the covenant, God gives his people the Promised Land as an eternal possession. The God of the covenant is also a God of redemption. God liberates his people from Egypt and continually intervenes to save them from their enemies.

The Tanakh imposes ethical requirements, including social justice and ritual purity . The Tanakh forbids the exploitation of widows, orphans, and other vulnerable groups. In addition, the Tanakh condemns murder, theft, bribery, corruption, deceitful trading, adultery, incest, bestiality, and homosexual acts. Another theme of the Tanakh is theodicy, showing that God is just even though evil and suffering are present in the world.

=== Narrative ===
The Tanakh begins with the Genesis creation narrative. Genesis 12–50 traces Israelite origins to the patriarchs: Abraham, his son Isaac, and grandson Jacob. God promises Abraham and his descendants blessing and land. The covenant God makes with Abraham is signified by male circumcision. The children of Jacob become the ancestors of the twelve tribes of Israel. Jacob&#x27;s son Joseph is sold into slavery by his brothers, but he becomes a powerful man in Egypt. During a famine, Jacob and his family settle in Egypt.

Jacob&#x27;s descendants lived in Egypt for 430 years. After the Exodus, the Israelites wander in the wilderness for 40 years. God gives the Israelites the Law of Moses to guide their behavior. The law includes rules for both religious ritual and ethics . This moral code requires justice and care for the poor, widows, and orphans. The biblical story affirms God&#x27;s unconditional love for his people, but he still punishes them when they fail to live by the covenant.

God leads Israel into the Promised Land of Canaan, which they conquer after five years. For the next 470 years, the Israelites were led by judges. In time, a new enemy emerged called the Philistines. They continued to trouble Israel when the prophet Samuel was judge (1 Samuel 4:1–7:1). When Samuel grew old, the people requested that he choose a king because Samuel&#x27;s sons were corrupt and they wanted to be like other nations (1 Samuel 8). The Tanakh presents this negatively as a rejection of God&#x27;s kingship; nevertheless, God permits it, and Saul of the tribe of Benjamin is anointed king. This inaugurates the united monarchy of the Kingdom of Israel.

An officer in Saul&#x27;s army named David achieves great militarily success. Saul tries to kill him out of jealousy, but David successfully escapes (1 Samuel 16–29). After Saul dies fighting the Philistines (1 Samuel 31; 2 Chronicles 10), the kingdom is divided between his son Eshbaal and David (David ruled his tribe of Judah and Eshbaal ruled the rest). After Eshbaal&#x27;s assassination, David was anointed king over all of Israel (2 Samuel 2–5).

David captures the Jebusite city of Jerusalem (2 Samuel 5:6–7) and makes it his capital. Jerusalem&#x27;s location between Judah in the southern hills and the northern Israelite tribes made it an ideal location from which to rule over all the tribes. He further increased Jerusalem&#x27;s importance by bringing the Ark of the Covenant there from Shiloh (2 Samuel 6). David&#x27;s son Solomon built the First Temple in Jerusalem.

After Solomon&#x27;s death, the united kingdom split into the northern Kingdom of Israel (also known as the Kingdom of Samaria) with its capital at Samaria and the southern Kingdom of Judah with its capital at Jerusalem. The Kingdom of Samaria survived for 200 years until it was conquered by the Assyrians in 722 BCE. The Kingdom of Judah survived for longer, but it was conquered by the Babylonians in 586 BCE. The Temple was destroyed, and many Judeans were exiled to Babylon. In 539 BCE, Babylon was conquered by Cyrus the Great of Persia, who allowed the exiles to return to Judah. Between 520 and 515 BCE, the Temple was rebuilt .

==Development==
=== Traditional attribution ===
Religious tradition ascribes authorship of the Torah to Moses. In later Biblical texts, such as Daniel 9:11 and Ezra 3:2, it is referred to as the &quot;Torah (Law) of Moses&quot;. However, the Torah itself credits Moses with writing only some specific sections. According to scholars, Moses would have lived in the 2nd millennium BCE, but this was before the development of Hebrew writing. The Torah is dated to the 1st millennium BCE after Israel and Judah had already developed as states. Nevertheless, &quot;it is highly likely that extensive oral transmission of proverbs, stories, and songs took place during this period&quot;, and these may have been included in the Hebrew Bible. Elements of Genesis 12–50, which describes the patriarchal age, and the Book of Exodus may reflect oral traditions. In these stories, Israelite ancestors such as Jacob and Moses use trickery and deception to survive and thrive.

King David () is credited as the author of at least 73 of the Biblical Psalms. His son, Solomon, is identified as the author of Book of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon. The Hebrew Bible describes their reigns as a golden age when Israel flourished both culturally and militarily. However, there is no archeological evidence for this, and it is most likely a &quot;retrospective extrapolation&quot; of conditions under King Jeroboam II ( BCE).

=== Before the exile ===
Modern scholars believe that the ancient Israelites mostly originated from within Canaan. Their material culture was closely related to their Canaanite neighbors, and Hebrew was a Canaanite dialect. Archaeological evidence indicates Israel began as loosely organized tribal villages in the hill country of modern-day Israel . During crises, these tribes formed temporary alliances. The Book of Judges, written (around 500 years after the events it describes), portrays Israel as a grouping of decentralized tribes, and the Song of Deborah in Judges 5 may reflect older oral traditions. It features archaic elements of Hebrew and a tribal list that identifies Israel exclusively with the northern tribes.

By the 9th or 8th centuries BCE, the scribal culture of Samaria and Judah was sufficiently developed to produce biblical texts. The Kingdom of Samaria was more powerful and culturally advanced than the Kingdom of Judah. It also featured multiple cultic sites, including the sanctuaries at Bethel and Dan.

Scholars estimate that the Jacob tradition (Genesis 25–35) was first written down in the 8th century BCE and probably originated in the north because the stories occur there. Based on the prominence given to the sanctuary at Bethel (Genesis 28), these stories were likely preserved and written down at that religious center. This means the Jacob cycle must be older than the time of King Josiah of Judah (), who pushed for the centralization of worship at Jerusalem.

The story of Moses and the Exodus appears to also originate in the north. It existed as a self-contained story in its oral and earliest written forms, but it was connected to the patriarchal stories during the exile or post-exile periods. The account of Moses&#x27;s birth (Exodus 2) shows similarities to the birth of Sargon of Akkad, which suggests Neo-Assyrian influence sometime after 722 BCE. While the Moses story is set in Egypt, it is used to tell both an anti-Assyrian and anti-imperial message, all while appropriating Assyrian story patterns. David M. Carr notes the possibility of an early oral tradition for the Exodus story: &quot;To be sure, there may have been a &#x27;Moses group,&#x27; themselves of Canaanite extraction, who experienced slavery and liberation from Egypt, but most scholars believe that such a group—if it existed—was only a small minority in early Israel, even though their story came to be claimed by all.&quot;

Scholars believe Psalm 45 could have northern origins since it refers to a king marrying a foreign princess, a policy of the Omrides. Some psalms may have originated from the shrine in the northern city of Dan. These are the Sons of Korah psalms, Psalm 29, and Psalm 68. The city of Dan probably became an Israelite city during the reign of King Jeroboam II (781–742BCE). Before then, it belonged to Aram, and Psalm 20 is nearly identical to an Aramaic psalm found in the 4th century BCE Papyrus Amherst 63.

The author of the Books of Kings likely lived in Jerusalem. The text shows a clear bias favoring Judah, where God&#x27;s worship was centralized in Jerusalem. The Kingdom of Samaria is portrayed as a godless breakaway region whose rulers refuse to worship at Jerusalem.

===Fixing the canon===
The books that make up the Hebrew Bible were composed and edited in stages over several hundred years. According to biblical scholar John J. Collins, &quot;It now seems clear that all the Hebrew Bible received its final shape in the postexilic, or Second Temple, period.&quot;

Traditionally, Moses was considered the author of the Torah, and this part of the Tanakh achieved authoritative or canonical status first, possibly as early as the 5th century BCE. This is suggested by Ezra 7:6, which describes Ezra as &quot;a scribe skilled in the law (&quot;torah&quot;) of Moses that the Lord the God of Israel had given&quot;.

The Nevi&#x27;im had gained canonical status by the 2nd century BCE. There are references to the &quot;Law and the Prophets&quot; in the Book of Sirach, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the New Testament. The Book of Daniel, written , was not grouped with the Prophets presumably because the Nevi&#x27;im collection was already fixed by this time.

The Ketuvim was the last part of the Tanakh to achieve canonical status. The prologue to the Book of Sirach mentions &quot;other writings&quot; along with the Law and Prophets but does not specify the content. The Gospel of Luke refers to &quot;the Law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms&quot; (Luke 24:44). These references suggest that the content of the Ketuvim remained fluid until the canonization process was completed in the 2nd-century CE.

There is no scholarly consensus as to when the Hebrew Bible canon was fixed: some scholars argue that it was fixed by the Hasmonean dynasty, while others argue it was not fixed until the second century CE or even later. The speculated late-1st-century Council of Jamnia was once credited with fixing the Hebrew canon, but modern scholars believe there was no such authoritative council of rabbis. Between 70 and 100 CE, rabbis debated whether certain books &quot;make the hands unclean&quot; (meaning the books are holy and should be considered scripture), and references to fixed numbers of canonical books appear. There were several criteria for inclusion. Books had to be older than the 4th century BCE or attributed to an author who had lived before that period. The original language had to be Hebrew, and books had to be widely used. Many books considered scripture by certain Jewish communities were excluded during this time.

There are various textual variants in the Hebrew Bible resulting from centuries of hand-copying. Scribes introduced thousands of minor changes to the biblical texts. Sometimes, these changes were by accident. At other times, scribes intentionally added clarifications or theological material. In the Middle Ages, Jewish scribes produced the Masoretic Text, which became the authoritative version of the Tanakh. Ancient Hebrew was written without vowels, but the Masoretes added vowel markings to the text to ensure accuracy.

Rabbi and Talmudic scholar Louis Ginzberg wrote in &quot;Legends of the Jews&quot;, published in 1909, that the twenty-four book canon was fixed by Ezra and the scribes in the Second Temple period. According to the Talmud, much of the Tanakh was compiled by the men of the Great Assembly (&quot;Anshei K&#x27;nesset HaGedolah&quot;), a task completed in 450 BCE, and it has remained unchanged ever since. The 24-book canon is mentioned in the Midrash Koheleth 12:12: &quot;Whoever brings together in his house more than twenty four books brings confusion&quot;.

==Language and pronunciation==
The original writing system of the Hebrew text was an abjad: consonants written with some applied vowel letters (&quot;matres lectionis&quot;). During the early Middle Ages, scholars known as the Masoretes created a single formalized system of vocalization. This was chiefly done by Aaron ben Moses ben Asher, in the Tiberias school, based on the oral tradition for reading the Tanakh, hence the name Tiberian vocalization. It also included some innovations of Ben Naftali and the Babylonian exiles. Despite the comparatively late process of codification, some traditional sources and some Orthodox Jews hold the pronunciation and cantillation to derive from the revelation at Sinai, since it is impossible to read the original text without pronunciations and cantillation pauses. The combination of a text ( &quot;mikra&quot;), pronunciation ( &quot;niqqud&quot;) and cantillation ( &quot;te`amim&quot;) enable the reader to understand both the simple meaning and the nuances in sentence flow of the text.

===Number of different words used===
The number of distinct words in the Hebrew Bible is 8,679, of which 1,480 are hapax legomena, words or expressions that occur only once. The number of distinct Semitic roots, on which many of these biblical words are based, is roughly 2000.

==Books==
The Tanakh consists of twenty-four books, counting as one book each 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel, 1 Kings and 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles and 2 Chronicles, and Ezra–Nehemiah. The Twelve Minor Prophets () are also counted as a single book. In Hebrew, the books are often referred to by their prominent first words.

===Torah===

The Torah (, literally &quot;teaching&quot;) is also known as the &quot;Pentateuch&quot;, or as the &quot;Five Books of Moses&quot;. Printed versions (rather than scrolls) of the Torah are often called ( &quot;Five fifth-sections of the Torah&quot;) and informally as .
* (, literally &quot;In the beginning&quot;) – Genesis
* (, literally &quot;The names of&quot;) – Exodus
* (, literally &quot;And He called&quot;) – Leviticus
* (, literally &quot;In the desert of&quot;) – Numbers
* (, literally &quot;Things&quot; or &quot;Words&quot;) – Deuteronomy

===Nevi&#x27;im===

&quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot; ( , &quot;Prophets&quot;) is the second main division of the Tanakh, between the Torah and Ketuvim. This division includes the books which cover the time from the entrance of the Israelites into the Land of Israel until the Babylonian captivity of Judah (the &quot;period of prophecy&quot;). Their distribution is not chronological, but substantive.

The Former Prophets ( ):
* () – Joshua
* () – Judges
* () – Samuel
* () – Kings

The Latter Prophets ( ):
* () – Isaiah
* () – Jeremiah
* () – Ezekiel

The Twelve Minor Prophets (, , &quot;The Twelve&quot;), which are considered one book:
* () – Hosea
* () – Joel
* () – Amos
* () – Obadiah
* () – Jonah
* () – Micah
* () – Nahum
* () – Habakkuk
* () – Zephaniah
* () – Haggai
* () – Zechariah
* () – Malachi

===Ketuvim===

 (, &quot;Writings&quot;) consists of eleven books.

====Poetic books====

In Masoretic manuscripts (and some printed editions), Psalms, Proverbs and Job are presented in a special two-column form emphasizing the parallel in the verses, which are a function of their poetry. Collectively, these three books are known as (an acronym of the titles in Hebrew, yields , which is also the Hebrew for &quot;truth&quot;).

These three books are also the only ones in Tanakh with a special system of cantillation notes that are designed to emphasize parallel stichs within verses. However, the beginning and end of the book of Job are in the normal prose system.

* () – Psalms
* () – Proverbs
* () – Job

====Five scrolls====

The five relatively short books of the Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther are collectively known as the (Five Megillot).

In many Jewish communities, these books are read aloud in the synagogue on particular occasions, the occasion listed below in parentheses.
* () – Song of Songs, also known as Song of Solomon (on Passover)
* () – Ruth (on Shavuot)
* () – Lamentations (on Tisha B&#x27;Av)
* () – Ecclesiastes (on Sukkot)
* () – Esther (on Purim)

====Other books====
Besides the three poetic books and the five scrolls, the remaining books in Ketuvim are Daniel, Ezra–Nehemiah and Chronicles. Although there is no formal grouping for these books in the Jewish tradition, they nevertheless share a number of distinguishing characteristics: their narratives all openly describe relatively late events (i.e. the Babylonian captivity and the subsequent restoration of Zion); the Talmudic tradition ascribes late authorship to all of them; two of them (Daniel and Ezra) are the only books in Tanakh with significant portions in Aramaic.
* () – Daniel
* () – Ezra and Nehemiah
* () – Chronicles

====Book order====
The Jewish textual tradition never finalized the order of the books in Ketuvim. The Talmud gives their order as Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Daniel, Scroll of Esther, Ezra, Chronicles. This order is roughly chronological (assuming traditional authorship).

In Tiberian Masoretic codices (including the Aleppo Codex and the Leningrad Codex), and often in old Spanish manuscripts as well, the order is Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, Ezra. This order is more thematic (e.g. the &quot;megillot&quot; are listed together).

===Number of books===

The Hebrew Bible is generally considered to consist of 24 books, but this number is somewhat arbitrary, as (for example) it regards 12 separate books of minor prophets as a single book. The traditional rabbinic count of 24 books appears in the Talmud and numerous works of midrash. In several early nonrabbinic sources, the number of books given is 22. This number corresponds to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet; according to Athanasius there were 27 books, corresponding to the alphabet with final letter forms (&quot;sofiot&quot;).

The count of 24 was said to be equal to the number of priestly divisions. According to a modern source, the number of books may be related to the division of the Iliad and Odyssey into 24 books, corresponding to the letters of the Greek alphabet. Both the Bible and Homer formed &quot;foundational literature&quot; of their respective cultures, studied by children and considered distillations of the society&#x27;s values. The division of the Bible into 22 books may be a conversion of the Greek system to the Hebrew alphabet, while the division into 24 may be an adoption of the &quot;perfect&quot; number 24 as befitting the Bible&#x27;s stature in Jewish eyes.

==Nach==
Nach, also anglicized , refers to the Nevi&#x27;im and Ketuvim portions of Tanakh. Nach is often referred to as its own subject, separate from Torah.

It is a major subject in the curriculum of Orthodox high schools for girls and in the seminaries which they subsequently attend, and is often taught by different teachers than those who teach Chumash. The curriculum of Orthodox high schools for boys includes only some portions of Nach, such as the book of Joshua, the book of Judges, and the Five Megillot.

==Jewish commentaries==
The major commentary used for the Chumash is the Rashi commentary. The Rashi commentary and Metzudot commentary are the major commentaries for the Nach.

There are two major approaches to the study of, and commentary on, the Tanakh. In the Jewish community, the classical approach is a religious study of the Bible, where it is assumed that the Bible is divinely inspired. Another approach is to study the Bible as a human creation. In this approach, Biblical studies can be considered as a sub-field of religious studies. The latter practice, when applied to the Torah, is considered heresy by the Orthodox Jewish community. As such, much modern day Bible commentary written by non-Orthodox authors is considered forbidden by rabbis teaching in Orthodox yeshivas. Some classical rabbinic commentators, such as Abraham Ibn Ezra, Gersonides, and Maimonides, used many elements of contemporary biblical criticism, including their knowledge of history, science, and philology. Their use of historical and scientific analysis of the Bible was considered acceptable by historic Judaism due to the author&#x27;s faith commitment to the idea that God revealed the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai.

The Modern Orthodox Jewish community allows for a wider array of biblical criticism to be used for biblical books outside of the Torah, and a few Orthodox commentaries now incorporate many of the techniques previously found in the
academic world, e.g. the Da&#x27;at Miqra series. Non-Orthodox Jews, including those affiliated with Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism, accept both traditional and secular approaches to Bible studies. &quot;Jewish commentaries on the Bible&quot;, discusses Jewish Tanakh commentaries from the Targums to classical rabbinic literature, the midrash literature, the classical medieval commentators, and modern-day commentaries.

== Influence on Jewish identity ==
Multiple scholars have noted the importance of the Hebrew Bible in developing the ethnic and national identity of the Jewish people in antiquity. Fergus Millar wrote that the Bible, serving as &quot;both a national history and a source of law,&quot; was one of several key sources that helped establishing a sense of national identity among ancient Jews. David Goodblatt argued that the Bible and related literature served as a key foundation for Jewish nationalism during the Second Temple period, underpinning the collective belief in shared descent, history, and cultural unity. The Bible provided a &quot;national history&quot; that traced the lineage of the Jewish people through the patriarchal narratives and tribal genealogies, establishing a shared ancestral framework that connected contemporary Jews to their historical forebears and consolidated a sense of shared descent. Moreover, biblical laws, such as male circumcision, Shabbat observance, and dietary prohibitions, became defining cultural markers of Jewish identity, distinguishing Jewish communities from surrounding populations. The Bible also played a key role in preserving Hebrew, which, unlike Phoenician and Edomite, survived even as Aramaic replaced other regional languages. The translation of biblical texts into Greek and Aramaic allowed Jewish culture to be expressed across linguistic boundaries, enabling a translingual Jewish identity while maintaining its cultural coherence.

Several scholars argue that key sections of the Hebrew Bible were deliberately composed during specific historical periods to construct and consolidate a distinct Israelite national consciousness. E. Theodore Mullen, a key proponent of this idea, argued in his first monograph that the &quot;Deuteronomistic History&quot;— including Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings—was composed during the Babylonian captivity to reinforce a threatened Judean identity. In another work, he focused on the Tetrateuch—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers—arguing that these books were compiled during the Persian era to forge a unified ethnic identity. This material, when combined with Deuteronomy, formed the Pentateuch, and its inclusion in the Deuteronomistic History created what David Noel Freedman termed the &quot;primary history.&quot;

According to Adrian Hastings, the study of sacred texts, including the Hebrew Bible, was a foundational element that allowed the Jews—whom he describes as the &quot;true proto-nation&quot;—to preserve their national identity during the two millennia following the loss of their political entity in the first century CE. This enduring connection to their heritage enabled Jews to be perceived as a nation rather than merely an ethnic group, ultimately paving the way for the rise of Zionism and the eventual establishment of the State of Israel. 

== Influence on Christianity ==

Christianity has long asserted a close relationship between the Hebrew Bible and New Testament. In Protestant Bibles, the Old Testament is the same as the Hebrew Bible, but the books are arranged differently. Catholic Bibles and Eastern Orthodox Bibles, as well as those in the Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian churches, contain books not included in certain versions of the Hebrew Bible, called Deuterocanonical books. Protestant English Bibles originally included the Deuterocanonical books, which Protestants now include among the Apocrypha. These books were removed when a slimmed-down King James Version was mass-produced by free Bible societies out of cost considerations.

The ancient translations of the Hebrew Bible currently used by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches are based on the Septuagint, which was considered the authoritative scriptural canon by the early Christians. The Septuagint was influential on early Christianity as it was the Hellenistic Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible primarily used by the 1st-century Christian authors.

Adrian Hastings contended that the model of ancient Israel presented in the Hebrew Bible established the original concept of nationhood, which subsequently influenced the development of nation-states in the Christian world.

<text>The Talmud (; ) is the central text of Rabbinic Judaism and the primary source of Jewish religious law (&quot;halakha&quot;) and Jewish theology. Until the advent of modernity, in nearly all Jewish communities, the Talmud was the centerpiece of Jewish cultural life and was foundational to &quot;all Jewish thought and aspirations&quot;, serving also as &quot;the guide for the daily life&quot; of Jews. The Talmud includes the teachings and opinions of thousands of rabbis on a variety of subjects, including halakha, Jewish ethics, philosophy, customs, history, and folklore, and many other topics.

The Talmud is constituted by the Mishnah (a written compendium of the Oral Torah), and the Gemara (), a commentary on the Mishnah and related Tannaitic writings. Sometimes, the word &quot;Talmud&quot; may only refer to the Gemara. This text is made up of 63 tractates, each covering one subject area. The language of the Talmud is Jewish Babylonian Aramaic. Talmudic tradition emerged and was compiled between the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE and the Arab conquest in the early seventh century. Traditionally, it is thought that the Talmud itself was compiled by Rav Ashi and Ravina II around 500 CE, although it is more likely that this happened in the middle of the sixth century.

The word Talmud commonly refers to the Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Talmud Bavli&quot;) and not the earlier Jerusalem Talmud ().

==Etymology==

Talmud translates as &quot;instruction, learning&quot;, from the Semitic root &quot;lmd&quot;, meaning &quot;teach, study&quot;.

==The Two Talmuds==
In antiquity, the two major centres of Jewish scholarship were located in Galilee and Babylonia. A Talmud was compiled in each of these regional centres. The earlier of the two compilations took place in Galilee, either in the late fourth or early fifth century, and it came to be known as the Jerusalem Talmud (or &quot;Talmud Yerushalmi&quot;). Later on, and likely some time in the sixth century, the Babylonian Talmud was compiled (&quot;Talmud Bavli&quot;). This later Talmud is usually what is being referred to when the word &quot;Talmud&quot; is used without qualification. Traditions of the Jerusalem Talmud and its sages had a significant influence on the milieu out of which the Babylonian Talmud arose.

===Jerusalem Talmud===
The Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Talmud Yerushalmi&quot;) is known by several other names, including the Palestinian Talmud (which is more accurate, as it was not compiled in Jerusalem), or the (&quot;Talmud of the Land of Israel&quot;). The Jerusalem Talmud was a written codification of oral tradition that had been circulating for centuries and represents a compilation of scholastic teachings and analyses on the Mishnah (especially those concerning agricultural laws) found across regional centres of the Land of Israel now known as the Academies in Galilee (principally those of Tiberias, Sepphoris, and Caesarea). It is written largely in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, a Western Aramaic language that differs from its Babylonian counterpart. The compilation was likely made between the late fourth to the first half of the fifth century.

Despite its incomplete state, the Jerusalem Talmud remains an indispensable source of knowledge of the development of the Jewish Law in the Holy Land. It was also an important primary source for the study of the Babylonian Talmud by the Kairouan school of Chananel ben Chushiel and Nissim ben Jacob, with the result that opinions ultimately based on the Jerusalem Talmud found their way into both the Tosafot and the Mishneh Torah of Maimonides. Ethical maxims contained in the Jerusalem Talmud are scattered and interspersed in the legal discussions throughout the several treatises, many of which differ from those in the Babylonian Talmud.

===Babylonian Talmud===
The Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Talmud Bavli&quot;) consists of documents compiled over the period of late antiquity (3rd to 6th centuries). During this time, the most important of the Jewish centres in Mesopotamia, a region called &quot;Babylonia&quot; in Jewish sources (see Talmudic academies in Babylonia) and later known as Iraq, were Nehardea, Nisibis (modern Nusaybin), Mahoza (al-Mada&#x27;in, just to the south of what is now Baghdad), Pumbedita (near present-day al Anbar Governorate), and the Sura Academy, probably located about south of Baghdad.

The Babylonian Talmud comprises the Mishnah and the Babylonian Gemara, the latter representing the culmination of centuries of analysis and dialectic surrounding the Mishnah in the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia. According to tradition, the foundations of this process of analysis were laid by Abba Arika (175–247), a disciple of Judah ha-Nasi. Tradition ascribes the compilation of the Babylonian Talmud in its present form to two Babylonian sages, Rav Ashi and Ravina II. Rav Ashi was president of the Sura Academy from 375 to 427. In this time, he began the creation of the written Talmud, a written project passed onto and completed by Ravina, the final Amoraic expounder. Accordingly, the latest traditional date for the Talmud is often placed at 475, the year Ravina died. However, even on traditional views, a final redaction is still thought to have been made by the &quot;Savoraim&quot; (&quot;reasoners&quot;, &quot;considerers&quot;) in the sixth century.

===Comparison===
Unlike the Western Aramaic dialect of the Jerusalem Talmud, the Babylonian Talmud has a Babylonian Aramaic dialect. The Jerusalem is also more fragmentary (and difficult to read) due to a less complete redactional process. Discussions in the Babylonian Talmud are more discursive, rambling, rely more on anecdote and argumentation by syllogism and induction, whereas those in the Jerusalem Talmud are more factual and apply argumentation through logical deduction. The Babylonian Talmud is much longer, with about 2.5 million words in total. Proportionally, more Babylonian material is non-legal (&quot;aggadah&quot;), constituting a third of its material, compared to a sixth of the Jerusalem. The Babylonian Talmud has received significantly more interest and coverage from commentators. 

Maimonides drew influence from both Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds, although he favored the latter over the former when principles between them conflicted. As the Palestinian Jewish community declined in influence and the Babylonian community became the intellectual center of the Diaspora, the Babylonian Talmud became the more widely accepted and popular version. Whereas the Jerusalem Talmud only includes the opinions of Israelite rabbis (the &quot;Ma&#x27;arava&quot;), the Babylonian Talmud also includes Babylonian authorities, in addition to later authorities because of its later date. As such, it is regarded as more comprehensive.

Neither covers the entire Mishnah. For example, the Babylonian commentary only covers 37 of 63 Mishnaic tractates. In particular:
* The Jerusalem Talmud covers all the tractates of Zeraim, while the Babylonian Talmud covers only tractate Berachot. This might be because the agricultural concerns of Zeraim were not as notable in Babylonia. As the Jerusalem Talmud was produced in the Land of Israel, it consequently has a greater interest in Israelite geography.
* Unlike the Babylonian Talmud, the Jerusalem Talmud does not cover the Mishnaic Kodashim, which deals with sacrificial rites and laws pertaining to the Temple. A good explanation for this is not available, although there is some evidence that a now-lost commentary on this text once existed in the Jerusalem Talmud.
* In both Talmuds, only one tractate of Tohorot (ritual purity laws) is examined, that of the menstrual laws (Niddah).

==Structure==
The structure of the Talmud follows that of the Mishnah, divided into Six Orders (known as the &quot;Shisha Sedarim&quot;, or &quot;Shas&quot;) of general subject matter are divided into 63 tractates (&quot;masekhtot&quot;; singular: &quot;masekhet&quot;) of more focused subject compilations, though not all tractates have Gemara. Each tractate is divided into chapters (&quot;perakim&quot;; singular: &quot;perek&quot;), 517 in total, that are both numbered according to the Hebrew alphabet and given names, usually using the first one or two words in the first Mishnah. A &quot;perek&quot; may continue over several (up to tens of) pages. Each &quot;perek&quot; will contain several &quot;mishnayot&quot;.

===Mishnah===

The Mishnah is a compilation of legal opinions and debates. Statements in the Mishnah are typically terse, recording brief opinions of the rabbis debating a subject; or recording only an unattributed ruling, apparently representing a consensus view. The rabbis recorded in the Mishnah are known as the Tannaim (literally, &quot;repeaters&quot;, or &quot;teachers&quot;). These tannaim—rabbis of the second century CE—&quot;who produced the Mishnah and other tannaic works, must be distinguished from the rabbis of the third to fifth centuries, known as amoraim (literally, &quot;speakers&quot;), who produced the two Talmudim and other amoraic works&quot;.

Since it sequences its laws by subject matter instead of by biblical context, the Mishnah discusses individual subjects more thoroughly than the Midrash, and it includes a much broader selection of halakhic subjects than the Midrash. The Mishnah&#x27;s topical organization thus became the framework of the Talmud as a whole. But not every tractate in the Mishnah has a corresponding Gemara. Also, the order of the tractates in the Talmud differs in some cases from that in the &quot;Mishnah&quot;.

===Gemara===
The Gemara constitutes the commentary portion of the Talmud. The Mishnah, and its commentary (the Gemara), together constitute the Talmud. This commentary arises from a longstanding tradition of rabbis analyzing, debating, and discussing the Mishnah ever since it had been published. The rabbis who participated in the process that produced this commentarial tradition are known as the Amoraim. Each discussion is presented in a self-contained, edited passage known as a sugya.

Much of the Gemara is legal in nature. Each analysis begins with a Mishnaic legal statement. With each sugya, the statement may be analyzed and compared with other statements. This process can be framed as an exchange between two (often anonymous, possibly metaphorical) disputants, termed the &#x27; (questioner) and &#x27; (answerer). Gemara also commonly tries to find the correct biblical basis for a given law in the Mishnah as well as the logical process that connects the biblical to the Mishnaic tradition. This process was known as &quot;talmud&quot;, long before the &quot;Talmud&quot; itself became a text. 

In addition, the Gemara contains a wide range of narratives, homiletical or exegetical passages, sayings, and other non-legal content, termed aggadah. A story told in a sugya of the Babylonian Talmud may draw upon the Mishnah, the Jerusalem Talmud, midrash, and other sources.

===Baraita===
The traditions that the Gemara comments on are not limited to what is found in the Mishnah, but the Baraita as well (a term that broadly designates Oral Torah traditions that did not end up in the Mishnah). The &quot;baraitot&quot; cited in the Gemara are often quotations from the Tosefta (a tannaitic compendium of halakha parallel to the Mishnah) and the Midrash halakha (specifically Mekhilta, Sifra and Sifre). Some &quot;baraitot&quot;, however, are known only through traditions cited in the Gemara, and are not part of any other collection.

===Minor tractates===

In addition to the Six Orders, the Talmud contains a series of short treatises of a later date, usually printed at the end of Seder Nezikin. These are not divided into Mishnah and Gemara.

==Language==
The work is largely in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, although quotations in the Gemara of the Mishnah, the Baraitas and Tanakh appear in Mishnaic or Biblical Hebrew. Some other dialects of Aramaic occur in quotations of other older works, like the Megillat Taanit. The reason why earlier texts occur in Hebrew, and later texts in Aramaic, is because of the adoption of the latter (which was the spoken vernacular) by rabbinic circles during the period of the Amoraim (rabbis cited in the Gemara) beginning around the year 200. A second Aramaic dialect is used in Nedarim, Nazir, Temurah, Keritot, and Me&#x27;ilah; the second is closer in style to the Targum.

=== Premodern estimates ===
The Talmud itself (BM 86a) incorporates a statement that &quot;Ravina and Rav Ashi were the end of instruction&quot;. Likewise, Sherira ben Hanina writes that &quot;instruction ended&quot; with the death of Ravina II in 811 SE (500 CE), and &quot;the Talmud stopped with the end of instruction in the days of Rabbah Jose (fl. 476-514)&quot;. &quot;Seder Olam Zutta&quot; records that &quot;in 811 SE (500 CE) Ravina the End of Instruction died, and the Talmud was stopped&quot;, and the same text is found in Codex Gaster 83. Another medieval chronicle records that &quot;On Wednesday, 13 Kislev, 811 SE (500 CE), Ravina the End of Instruction son of Rav Huna died, and the Talmud stopped.&quot; Abraham ibn Daud gives 821 SE (510 CE) for the same event, and Joseph ibn Tzaddik writes that &quot;Mareimar and Mar bar Rav Assi et al. completed the Babylonian Talmud . . . in 4265 AM (505 CE)&quot;. Nachmanides dated the Talmud&#x27;s compilation to &quot;400 years after the Destruction&quot;, which is 470 CE if taken as exact. According to Moses da Rieti, &quot;Ravina and Rav Ashi compiled the Talmud but they did not complete it, and Mar bar Rav Ashi and Mareimar et al. sealed it in the days of Rabbah Jose . . . he headed the academy for 38 years after succeeding Ravina, until 4274 AM (514 CE), and in his days the Babylonian Talmud was sealed, which was begun and largely redacted in the days of Rav Ashi and Ravina&quot;.

The &quot;Wikkuah&quot;, a description of the 1240 Disputation of Paris, records that Yechiel of Paris claimed that &quot;the Talmud is 1,500 years old&quot;, which would put it in the 3rd century BCE. Pietro Capelli suggests that it must have been traditional among medieval Ashkenazic Jews to date the Talmud from its beginning instead of its completion. Later manuscripts of the &quot;Wikkuah&quot; adopt the usual system of dating it to the time of Ravina II. Nicholas Donin, by contrast, claimed that the Talmud was only composeed &quot;400 years&quot; before, i.e. around 840 CE. 

=== Modern estimates ===
A wide range of dates have been proposed for the Babylonian Talmud by historians. The text was most likely completed, however, in the 6th century, or prior to the early Muslim conquests in the mid-7th century at the latest, on the basis that the Talmud lacks loanwords or syntax deriving from Arabic. 

Recently, it has been extensively argued that Talmud is an expression and product of Sasanian culture, as well as other Greek-Roman, Middle Persian, and Syriac sources up to the same period of time. The contents of the text likely trace to this time regardless of the date of the final redaction/compilation. 

Additional external evidence for a latest possible date for the composition of the Babylonian Talmud are uses of it by external sources such as &quot;Letter of Baboi&quot; () and chronicles like the &quot;Seder Tannaim veAmoraim&quot; (9th century) and the &quot;Iggeret of Rabbi Sherira Gaon&quot; (987). As for a lower boundary on the dating of the Babylonian Talmud, it must post-date the early 5th century given its reliance on the Jerusalem Talmud.

==In Jewish scholarship==
From the time of its completion, the Talmud became integral to Jewish scholarship. A maxim in Pirkei Avot advocates its study from the age of 15. This section outlines some of the major areas of Talmudic study.

===Legal interpretation===
One area of Talmudic scholarship developed out of the need to ascertain the Halakha (Jewish rabbinical law). Early commentators such as Isaac Alfasi (North Africa, 1013–1103) attempted to extract and determine the binding legal opinions from the vast corpus of the Talmud. Alfasi&#x27;s work was highly influential, attracted several commentaries in its own right and later served as a basis for the creation of halakhic codes. Another influential medieval Halakhic work following the order of the Babylonian Talmud, and to some extent modelled on Alfasi, was &quot;the &quot;Mordechai&quot;&quot;, a compilation by Mordechai ben Hillel ( 1250–1298). A third such work was that of Asher ben Yechiel (d. 1327). All these works and their commentaries are printed in the Vilna and many subsequent editions of the Talmud.

A 15th-century Spanish rabbi, Jacob ibn Habib (d. 1516), compiled the &quot;Ein Yaakov&quot;, which extracts nearly all the Aggadic material from the Talmud. It was intended to familiarize the public with the ethical parts of the Talmud and to dispute many of the accusations surrounding its contents.

===Commentaries===
Geonic-era (6th-11th centuries) commentaries have largely been lost, but are known to exist from partial quotations in later medieval and early modern texts. Because of this, it is known that now-lost commentaries on the Talmud were written by Paltoi Gaon, Sherira, Hai Gaon, and Saadya (though in this case, Saadiya is not likely to be the true author). Of these, the commentary of Paltoi ben Abaye (&quot;c.&quot; 840) is the earliest. His son, Zemah ben Paltoi paraphrased and explained the passages which he quoted; and he composed, as an aid to the study of the Talmud, a lexicon which Abraham Zacuto consulted in the fifteenth century. Saadia Gaon is said to have composed commentaries on the Talmud, aside from his Arabic commentaries on the Mishnah.

The first surviving commentary on the entire Talmud is that of Chananel ben Chushiel. Many medieval authors also composed commentaries focusing on the content of specific tractates, including Nissim ben Jacob and Gershom ben Judah. The commentary of Rashi, covering most of the Talmud, has become a classic. Sections in the commentary covering a few tractates (Pes, BB and Mak) were completed by his students, especially Judah ben Nathan, and a sections dealing with specific tractates (Ned, Naz, Hor and MQ) of the commentary that appear in some print editions of Rashi&#x27;s commentary today were not composed by him. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a genre of rabbinic literature emerged surrounding Rashi&#x27;s commentary, with the purpose of supplementing it and addressing internal contradictions via the technique of &quot;pilpul&quot;. This genre of commentary is known as the Tosafot and focuses on specific passages instead of a running continuous commentary across the entire Talmud.

Many Talmudic passages are difficult to understand, sometimes owing to the use of Greek or Persian loanwords whose meaning had become obscure. A major area of Talmudic scholarship developed to explain these passages and words. Some early commentators such as Rabbenu Gershom of Mainz (10th century) and Rabbenu Ḥananel (early 11th century) produced running commentaries to various tractates. These commentaries could be read with the text of the Talmud and would help explain the meaning of the text. Another important work is the &quot;Sefer ha-Mafteaḥ&quot; (Book of the Key) by Nissim Gaon, which contains a preface explaining the different forms of Talmudic argumentation and then explains abbreviated passages in the Talmud by cross-referring to parallel passages where the same thought is expressed in full. Commentaries (&quot;ḥiddushim&quot;) by Joseph ibn Migash on two tractates, Bava Batra and Shevuot, based on Ḥananel and Alfasi, also survive, as does a compilation by Zechariah Aghmati called &quot;Sefer ha-Ner&quot;.

The &quot;Tosafot&quot; are collected commentaries by various medieval Ashkenazic rabbis on the Talmud (known as &quot;Tosafists&quot; or &quot;Ba&#x27;alei Tosafot&quot;). One of the main goals of the &quot;Tosafot&quot; is to explain and interpret contradictory statements in the Talmud. Unlike Rashi, the &quot;Tosafot&quot; is not a running commentary, but rather comments on selected matters. Often the explanations of &quot;Tosafot&quot; differ from those of Rashi.

Among the founders of the Tosafist school were Rabbeinu Tam, who was a grandson of Rashi, and, Rabbenu Tam&#x27;s nephew, Isaac ben Samuel. The Tosafot commentaries were collected in different editions in the various schools. The benchmark collection of Tosafot for Northern France was that of Eliezer of Touques. The standard collection for Spain was Rabbenu Asher&#x27;s &quot;Tosefot haRosh.&quot; The Tosafot that are printed in the standard Vilna edition of the Talmud are an edited version compiled from the various medieval collections, predominantly that of Touques.

A recent project, &quot;Halacha Brura&quot;, founded by Abraham Isaac Kook, presents the Talmud and a summary of the halachic codes side by side, so as to enable the &quot;collation&quot; of Talmud with resultant Halacha.

===Pilpul===
During the 15th and 16th centuries, a new intensive form of Talmud study arose. Complicated logical arguments were used to explain minor points of contradiction within the Talmud. The term &quot;pilpul&quot; was applied to this type of study. Usage of &quot;pilpul&quot; in this sense (that of &quot;sharp analysis&quot;) harks back to the Talmudic era and refers to the intellectual sharpness this method demanded.

Pilpul practitioners posited that the Talmud could contain no redundancy or contradiction whatsoever. New categories and distinctions (&quot;hillukim&quot;) were therefore created, resolving seeming contradictions within the Talmud by novel logical means.

In the Ashkenazi world the founders of &quot;pilpul&quot; are generally considered to be Jacob Pollak (1460–1541) and Shalom Shachna. This kind of study reached its height in the 16th and 17th centuries when expertise in pilpulistic analysis was considered an art form and became a goal in and of itself within the yeshivot of Poland and Lithuania. But the popular new method of Talmud study was not without critics; already in the 15th century, the ethical tract &quot;Orhot Zaddikim&quot; (&quot;Paths of the Righteous&quot; in Hebrew) criticized pilpul for an overemphasis on intellectual acuity. Many 16th- and 17th-century rabbis were also critical of pilpul. Among them are Judah Loew ben Bezalel (the &quot;Maharal&quot; of Prague), Isaiah Horowitz, and Yair Bacharach.

By the 18th century, pilpul study waned. Other styles of learning such as that of the school of Elijah b. Solomon, the Vilna Gaon, became popular. The term &quot;pilpul&quot; was increasingly applied derogatorily to novellae deemed casuistic and hairsplitting. Authors referred to their own commentaries as &quot;al derekh ha-peshat&quot; (by the simple method) to contrast them with pilpul.

===Sephardic approaches===
Among Sephardi and Italian Jews from the 15th century on, some authorities sought to apply the methods of Aristotelian logic, as reformulated by Averroes. This method was first recorded, though without explicit reference to Aristotle, by Isaac Campanton (d. Spain, 1463) in his &quot;Darkhei ha-Talmud&quot; (&quot;The Ways of the Talmud&quot;), and is also found in the works of Moses Chaim Luzzatto.

According to the present-day Sephardi scholar José Faur, traditional Sephardic Talmud study could take place on any of three levels.
* The most basic level consists of literary analysis of the text without the help of commentaries, designed to bring out the &quot;tzurata di-shema&#x27;ta&quot;, i.e. the logical and narrative structure of the passage.
* The intermediate level, &quot;iyyun&quot; (concentration), consists of study with the help of commentaries such as Rashi and the Tosafot, similar to that practiced among the Ashkenazim. Historically Sephardim studied the &quot;Tosefot ha-Rosh&quot; and the commentaries of Nahmanides in preference to the printed Tosafot. A method based on the study of Tosafot, and of Ashkenazi authorities such as &quot;Maharsha&quot; (Samuel Edels) and &quot;Maharshal&quot; (Solomon Luria), was introduced in late seventeenth century Tunisia by rabbis Abraham Hakohen (d. 1715) and Tsemaḥ Tsarfati (d. 1717) and perpetuated by rabbi Isaac Lumbroso and is sometimes referred to as&quot; &#x27;Iyyun Tunisa&#x27;i&quot;.
* The highest level, &quot;halachah&quot; (Jewish law), consists of collating the opinions set out in the Talmud with those of the halachic codes such as the Mishneh Torah and the Shulchan Aruch, so as to study the Talmud as a source of law; the equivalent Ashkenazi approach is sometimes referred to as being &quot;aliba dehilchasa&quot;.

===Brisker method===
In the late 19th century another trend in Talmud study arose. Hayyim Soloveitchik (1853–1918) of Brisk (Brest-Litovsk) developed and refined this style of study. Brisker method involves a reductionistic analysis of rabbinic arguments within the Talmud or among the Rishonim, explaining the differing opinions by placing them within a categorical structure. The Brisker method is highly analytical and is often criticized as being a modern-day version of pilpul. Nevertheless, the influence of the Brisker method is great. Most modern-day Yeshivot study the Talmud using the Brisker method in some form. One feature of this method is the use of Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; as a guide to Talmudic interpretation, as distinct from its use as a source of practical &quot;halakha&quot;.

Rival methods were those of the Mir and Telz yeshivas.

== Textual criticism ==

=== Medieval era ===
The text of the Talmud has been subject to some level of critical scrutiny throughout its history. Rabbinic tradition holds that the people cited in both Talmuds did not have a hand in its writings; rather, their teachings were edited into a rough form around 450 CE (Talmud Yerushalmi) and 550 CE (Talmud Bavli.) The text of the Bavli especially was not firmly fixed at that time.

Gaonic responsa literature addresses this issue. Teshuvot Geonim Kadmonim, section 78, deals with mistaken biblical readings in the Talmud. This Gaonic responsum states:
In the early medieval era, Rashi already concluded that some statements in the extant text of the Talmud were insertions from later editors. On Shevuot 3b Rashi writes &quot;A mistaken student wrote this in the margin of the Talmud, and copyists [subsequently] put it into the Gemara.&quot;

=== Early modern era ===
The emendations of Yoel Sirkis and the Vilna Gaon are included in all standard editions of the Talmud, in the form of marginal glosses entitled &quot;Hagahot ha-Bach&quot; and &quot;Hagahot ha-Gra&quot; respectively; further emendations by Solomon Luria are set out in commentary form at the back of each tractate. The Vilna Gaon&#x27;s emendations were often based on his quest for internal consistency in the text rather than on manuscript evidence; nevertheless many of the Gaon&#x27;s emendations were later verified by textual critics, such as Solomon Schechter, who had Cairo Genizah texts with which to compare our standard editions.

=== Contemporary scholarship ===
In the 19th century, Raphael Nathan Nota Rabinovicz published a multi-volume work entitled &quot;Dikdukei Soferim&quot;, showing textual variants from the Munich and other early manuscripts of the Talmud, and further variants are recorded in the Complete Israeli Talmud and &quot;Gemara Shelemah&quot; editions (see Critical editions, above).

Today many more manuscripts have become available, in particular from the Cairo Geniza. The Academy of the Hebrew Language has prepared a text on CD-ROM for lexicographical purposes, containing the text of each tractate according to the manuscript it considers most reliable, and images of some of the older manuscripts may be found on the website of the National Library of Israel (formerly the Jewish National and University Library). The NLI, the Lieberman Institute (associated with the Jewish Theological Seminary of America), the Institute for the Complete Israeli Talmud (part of Yad Harav Herzog) and the Friedberg Jewish Manuscript Society all maintain searchable websites on which the viewer can request variant manuscript readings of a given passage.

Some trends within contemporary Talmud scholarship are listed below.
* Orthodox Judaism maintains that the oral Torah was revealed, in some form, together with the written Torah. As such, some adherents, most notably Samson Raphael Hirsch and his followers, resisted any effort to apply historical methods that imputed specific motives to the authors of the Talmud. Other major figures in Orthodoxy, however, took issue with Hirsch on this matter, most prominently David Tzvi Hoffmann.
* Some scholars hold that there has been extensive editorial reshaping of the stories and statements within the Talmud. Lacking outside confirming texts, they hold that we cannot confirm the origin or date of most statements and laws, and that we can say little for certain about their authorship. In this view, the questions above are impossible to answer. See, for example, the works of Louis Jacobs and Shaye J.D. Cohen.
* Some scholars hold that the Talmud has been extensively shaped by later editorial redaction, but that it contains sources we can identify and describe with some level of reliability. In this view, sources can be identified by tracing the history and analyzing the geographical regions of origin. See, for example, the works of Lee I. Levine and David Kraemer.
* Some scholars hold that many or most of the statements and events described in the Talmud usually occurred more or less as described, and that they can be used as serious sources of historical study. In this view, historians do their best to tease out later editorial additions (itself a very difficult task) and skeptically view accounts of miracles, leaving behind a reliable historical text. See, for example, the works of Saul Lieberman, David Weiss Halivni, and Avraham Goldberg.
* Modern academic study attempts to separate the different &quot;strata&quot; within the text, to try to interpret each level on its own, and to identify the correlations between parallel versions of the same tradition. In recent years, the works of David Weiss Halivni and Shamma Friedman have suggested a paradigm shift in the understanding of the Talmud (Encyclopaedia Judaica 2nd ed. entry &quot;Talmud, Babylonian&quot;). The traditional understanding was to view the Talmud as a unified homogeneous work. While other scholars had also treated the Talmud as a multi-layered work, Halivni&#x27;s innovation (primarily in the second volume of his &quot;Mekorot u-Mesorot&quot;) was to differentiate between the Amoraic statements, which are generally brief Halachic decisions or inquiries, and the writings of the later &quot;Stammaitic&quot; (or Saboraic) authors, which are characterised by a much longer analysis that often consists of lengthy dialectic discussion. The Jerusalem Talmud is very similar to the Babylonian Talmud minus Stammaitic activity (Encyclopaedia Judaica (2nd ed.), entry &quot;Jerusalem Talmud&quot;). Shamma Y. Friedman&#x27;s &quot;Talmud Aruch&quot; on the sixth chapter of Bava Metzia (1996) is the first example of a complete analysis of a Talmudic text using this method. S. Wald has followed with works on Pesachim ch. 3 (2000) and Shabbat ch. 7 (2006). Further commentaries in this sense are being published by Friedman&#x27;s &quot;Society for the Interpretation of the Talmud&quot;.
* Some scholars are indeed using outside sources to help give historical and contextual understanding of certain areas of the Babylonian Talmud. See for example the works of Yaakov Elman and of his student Shai Secunda, which seek to place the Talmud in its Iranian context, for example by comparing it with contemporary Zoroastrian texts.

==Translations==

There are six contemporary translations of the Talmud into English:

=== Steinsaltz ===
* Adin Steinsaltz began his translation of the Babylonian Talmud into modern Hebrew (the original is mostly Aramaic with some Mishnaic Hebrew) in 1969 and completed it in 2010. (He also translated some tractates of the Jerusalem Talmud.) The Hebrew edition is printed in two formats: the original one in a new layout and the later one in the format of the traditional Vilna Talmud page; both are available in several sizes. The first attempt to translate the Steinsaltz edition into English was &quot;The Talmud: The Steinsaltz Edition&quot; (Random House), which contains the original Hebrew-Aramaic text with punctuation and an English translation based on Steinsaltz&#x27; complete Hebrew language translation of and commentary on the entire Talmud. This edition began to be released in 1989 but was never completed; only four tractates were printed in 21 volumes, with a matching Reference Guide translated from a separate work of Steinsaltz. Portions of the Steinsaltz Talmud have also been translated into French, Russian, and other languages.
* The Noé Edition of the &quot;Koren Talmud Bavli&quot;, published by Koren Publishers Jerusalem was launched in 2012. It has a new, modern English translation and the commentary of Adin Steinsaltz, and was praised for its &quot;beautiful page&quot; with &quot;clean type&quot;. From the right side cover (the front side of Hebrew and Aramaic books), the Steinsaltz Talmud edition has the traditional Vilna page with vowels and punctuation in the original Aramaic text. The Rashi commentary appears in Rashi script with vowels and punctuation. From the left side cover the edition features bilingual text with side-by-side English/Aramaic translation. The margins include color maps, illustrations and notes based on Adin Steinsaltz&#x27;s Hebrew language translation and commentary of the Talmud. Tzvi Hersh Weinreb serves as the Editor-in-Chief. The entire set was completed in 42 volumes.
*In February 2017, the &quot;William Davidson Talmud&quot; was released to Sefaria. This translation is a version of the Noé Steinsaltz edition above, which was released under creative commons license.

=== Artscroll ===

* The &quot;Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud&quot; (Artscroll/Mesorah Publications), is 73 volumes, in an English translation edition and a Hebrew translation edition. In the translated editions, each English or Hebrew page faces the Aramaic/Hebrew page it translates. Each Aramaic/Hebrew page of Talmud typically requires three to six English or Hebrew pages of translation and notes. The Aramaic/Hebrew pages are printed in the traditional Vilna format, with a gray bar added that shows the section translated on the facing page. The facing pages provide an expanded paraphrase in English or Hebrew, with translation of the text shown in bold and explanations interspersed in normal type, along with extensive footnotes. Pages are numbered in the traditional way but with a superscript added, e.g. 12b4 is the fourth page translating the Vilna page 12b. Larger tractates require multiple volumes. The first volume was published in 1990, and the series was completed in 2004.

=== Soncino ===
* &quot;The Soncino Talmud&quot; (34 volumes, 1935–1948, with an additional index volume published in 1952 and a two-volume translation of the Minor Tractates later), Isidore Epstein, Soncino Press. An 18 volume edition was published in 1961. Notes on each page provide additional background material. This translation: is published both in English and in a parallel text edition, in which each English page faces the Aramaic/Hebrew page. It is also available on CD-ROM. Complete.
*In addition, a 7x5in travel or pocket edition was published in 1959. This edition opens from the left for English and the notes, and from the right for the Aramaic, which, unlike the other editions, does not use standard Vilna Talmud page; instead, another older edition is used, in which each standard Talmud page is divided in two.

* &quot;Rodkinson&quot;: Portions of the Babylonian Talmud were translated by Michael L. Rodkinson (1903). It has been linked to online, for copyright reasons (initially it was the only freely available translation on the web), but this has been wholly superseded by the Soncino translation. (see below, under Full text resources).

It is a revision of &quot;The Talmud of Babylonia: An Academic Commentary,&quot; published by the University of South Florida Academic Commentary Series (1994–1999). Neusner gives commentary on transition in use langes from Biblical Aramaic to Biblical Hebrew. Neusner also gives references to Mishnah, Torah, and other classical works in Orthodox Judaism.

=== Translations into other languages ===
*The &quot;Extractiones de Talmud&quot;, a Latin translation of some 1,922 passages from the Talmud, was made in Paris in 1244–1245. It survives in two recensions. There is a critical edition of the sequential recension:
*A circa 1000 CE translation of (some parts of) the Talmud to Arabic is mentioned in Sefer ha-Qabbalah. This version was commissioned by the Fatimid Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah and was carried out by Joseph ibn Abitur.
*The Talmud was translated by Shimon Moyal into Arabic in 1909. There is one translation of the Talmud into Arabic, published in 2012 in Jordan by the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. The translation was carried out by a group of 90 Muslim and Christian scholars. The introduction was characterized by Raquel Ukeles, Curator of the Israel National Library&#x27;s Arabic collection, as &quot;racist&quot;, but she considers the translation itself as &quot;not bad&quot;.

*In 2018 Muslim-majority Albania co-hosted an event at the United Nations with Catholic-majority Italy and Jewish-majority Israel celebrating the translation of the Talmud into Italian for the first time. Albanian UN Ambassador Besiana Kadare opined: &quot;Projects like the Babylonian Talmud Translation open a new lane in intercultural and interfaith dialogue, bringing hope and understanding among people, the right tools to counter prejudice, stereotypical thinking and discrimination. By doing so, we think that we strengthen our social traditions, peace, stability — and we also counter violent extremist tendencies.&quot;
*In 2012, a first volume of the Talmud Bavli was published in Spanish by Tashema. It was translated in Jerusalem under the yeshiva directed by Rav Yaakov Benaim. It includes the translation and explanation of the Mishnah and Gemara, and the commentaries by Rashi and Tosafot. By 2023, 19 volumes have been published.

==Index==
&quot;A widely accepted and accessible index&quot; was the goal driving several such projects.:
* &quot;Mafteah haTalmud&quot; (1910-1930). Breslau: D. Rotenberg. The individual work of . Only four volumes were released before the remainder was lost in manuscript during the The Holocaust.
* &quot;Index Volume to the Soncino Talmud&quot; (1952). Soncino Press. 749 pages. 
* &quot;Michlul haMa&#x27;amarim&quot; (1960). Mossad Harav Kook. A three-volume index of the Bavli and Yerushalmi, containing more than 100,000 entries.
* &quot;HaMafteah&quot; (2011). Feldheim Publishers. has over 30,000 entries.

==Editions==

===Bomberg Talmud 1523===
The first complete edition of the Babylonian Talmud was printed in Venice by Daniel Bomberg 1520–23 with the support of Pope Leo X. In addition to the &quot;Mishnah&quot; and &quot;Gemara&quot;, Bomberg&#x27;s edition contained the commentaries of Rashi and Tosafot. Almost all printings since Bomberg have followed the same pagination. Bomberg&#x27;s edition was considered relatively free of censorship.

=== Froben Talmud 1578 ===
Ambrosius Frobenius collaborated with the scholar Israel Ben Daniel Sifroni from Italy. His most extensive work was a Talmud edition published, with great difficulty, in 1578–81.

===Benveniste Talmud 1645===
Following Ambrosius Frobenius&#x27;s publication of most of the Talmud in installments in Basel, Immanuel Benveniste published the whole Talmud in installments in Amsterdam 1644–1648, Although according to Raphael Rabbinovicz the Benveniste Talmud may have been based on the Lublin Talmud and included many of the censors&#x27; errors. &quot;It is noteworthy due to the inclusion of &quot;Avodah Zarah&quot;, omitted due to Church censorship from several previous editions, and when printed, often lacking a title page.

===Slavita Talmud 1795 and Vilna Talmud 1835===
The edition of the Talmud published by the Szapira brothers in Slavita was published in 1817, and it is particularly prized by many rebbes of Hasidic Judaism. In 1835, after a religious community copyright was nearly over, and following an acrimonious dispute with the Szapira family, a new edition of the Talmud was printed by Menachem Romm of Vilna.

Known as the &quot;Vilna Edition Shas&quot;, this edition (and later ones printed by his widow and sons, the Romm publishing house) has been used in the production of more recent editions of Talmud Bavli.

A page number in the Vilna Talmud refers to a double-sided page, known as a &quot;daf&quot;, or folio in English; each daf has two &quot;amudim&quot; labeled and , sides A and B (recto and verso). The convention of referencing by &quot;daf&quot; is relatively recent and dates from the early Talmud printings of the 17th century, though the actual pagination goes back to the Bomberg edition. Earlier rabbinic literature generally refers to the tractate or chapters within a tractate (e.g. Berachot Chapter 1, ). It sometimes also refers to the specific Mishnah in that chapter, where &quot;Mishnah&quot; is replaced with &quot;Halakha&quot;, here meaning route, to &quot;direct&quot; the reader to the entry in the Gemara corresponding to that Mishna (e.g. Berachot Chapter 1 Halakha 1, , would refer to the first Mishnah of the first chapter in Tractate Berachot, and its corresponding entry in the Gemara). However, this form is nowadays more commonly (though not exclusively) used when referring to the Jerusalem Talmud. Nowadays, reference is usually made in format [&quot;Tractate daf a/b&quot;] (e.g. Berachot 23b, ). Increasingly, the symbols &quot;.&quot; and &quot;:&quot; are used to indicate Recto and Verso, respectively (thus, e.g. Berachot 23:, ). These references always refer to the pagination of the Vilna Talmud.

===Critical editions===

The text of the Vilna editions is considered by scholars not to be uniformly reliable, and there have been a number of attempts to collate textual variants.
# In the late 19th century, Nathan Rabinowitz published a series of volumes called &quot;Dikduke Soferim&quot; showing textual variants from early manuscripts and printings.
# In 1960, work started on a new edition under the name of &quot;Gemara Shelemah&quot; (complete Gemara) under the editorship of Menachem Mendel Kasher: only the volume on the first part of tractate Pesachim appeared before the project was interrupted by his death. This edition contained a comprehensive set of textual variants and a few selected commentaries.
# Some thirteen volumes have been published by the Institute for the Complete Israeli Talmud (a division of Yad Harav Herzog), on lines similar to Rabinowitz, containing the text and a comprehensive set of textual variants (from manuscripts, early prints and citations in secondary literature) but no commentaries.

There have been critical editions of particular tractates (e.g. Henry Malter&#x27;s edition of &quot;Ta&#x27;anit&quot;), but there is no modern critical edition of the whole Talmud. Modern editions such as those of the Oz ve-Hadar Institute correct misprints and restore passages that in earlier editions were modified or excised by censorship but do not attempt a comprehensive account of textual variants. One edition, by Yosef Amar, represents the Yemenite tradition, and takes the form of a photostatic reproduction of a Vilna-based print to which Yemenite vocalization and textual variants have been added by hand, together with printed introductory material. Collations of the Yemenite manuscripts of some tractates have been published by Columbia University.

===Editions for a wider audience===
A number of editions have been aimed at bringing the Talmud to a wider audience. Aside from the Steinsaltz and Artscroll/Schottenstein sets there are:
* The Metivta edition, published by the Oz ve-Hadar Institute. This contains the full text in the same format as the Vilna-based editions, with a full explanation in modern Hebrew on facing pages as well as an improved version of the traditional commentaries.
* A previous project of the same kind, called Talmud El Am, &quot;Talmud to the people&quot;, was published in Israel in the 1960s–80s. It contains Hebrew text, English translation and commentary by Arnost Zvi Ehrman, with short &#x27;realia&#x27;, marginal notes, often illustrated, written by experts in the field for the whole of Tractate Berakhot, 2 chapters of Bava Mezia and the halachic section of Qiddushin, chapter 1.
* Tuvia&#x27;s &quot;Gemara Menukad&quot;: includes vowels and punctuation (&quot;Nekudot&quot;), including for Rashi and Tosafot. It also includes &quot;all the abbreviations of that &quot;amud&quot; on the side of each page.&quot;

===Incomplete sets from prior centuries===
* Amsterdam (1714, &quot;Proops&quot; Talmud and &quot;Marches/de Palasios&quot; Talmud): Two sets were begun in Amsterdam in 1714, a year in which &quot;acrimonious disputes between publishers within and between cities&quot; regarding reprint rights also began. The latter ran 1714–1717. Neither set was completed, although a third set was printed 1752–1765.

===Other notable editions===
Lazarus Goldschmidt published an edition from the &quot;uncensored text&quot; of the Babylonian Talmud with a German translation in 9 volumes (commenced Leipzig, 1897–1909, edition completed, following emigration to England in 1933, by 1936).

Twelve volumes of the Babylonian Talmud were published by Mir Yeshiva refugees during the years 1942 thru 1946 while they were in Shanghai. The major tractates, one per volume, were: &quot;Shabbat, Eruvin, Pesachim, Gittin, Kiddushin, Nazir, Sotah, Bava Kama, Sanhedrin, Makot, Shevuot, Avodah Zara&quot; (with some volumes having, in addition, &quot;Minor Tractates&quot;).

A Survivors&#x27; Talmud was published, encouraged by President Truman&#x27;s &quot;responsibility toward these victims of persecution&quot; statement. The U.S. Army (despite &quot;the acute shortage of paper in Germany&quot;) agreed to print &quot;fifty copies of the Talmud, packaged into 16-volume sets&quot; during 1947–1950. The plan was extended: 3,000 copies, in 19-volume sets.

== In visual arts ==

=== In Carl Schleicher&#x27;s paintings ===
Rabbis and Talmudists studying and debating Talmud abound in the art of Austrian painter Carl Schleicher (1825–1903); active in Vienna, especially –1871.
=== Jewish art and photography ===
==Reception outside of Judaism==

=== Christianity ===
The study of Talmud is not restricted to those of the Jewish religion and has attracted interest in other cultures. Christian scholars have long expressed an interest in the study of Talmud, which has helped illuminate their own scriptures. Talmud contains biblical exegesis and commentary on Tanakh that will often clarify elliptical and esoteric passages. The Talmud contains possible references to Jesus and his disciples, while the Christian canon makes mention of Talmudic figures and contains teachings that can be paralleled within the Talmud and Midrash. The Talmud provides cultural and historical context to the Gospel and the writings of the Apostles.

=== South Korea ===
South Koreans reportedly hope to emulate Jews&#x27; high academic standards by studying Jewish literature. Almost every household has a translated copy of a book they call &quot;Talmud&quot;, which parents read to their children, and the book is part of the primary-school curriculum. The &quot;Talmud&quot; in this case is usually one of several possible volumes, the earliest translated into Korean from the Japanese. The original Japanese books were created through the collaboration of Japanese writer Hideaki Kase and Marvin Tokayer, an Orthodox American rabbi serving in Japan in the 1960s and 70s. The first collaborative book was &quot;5,000 Years of Jewish Wisdom: Secrets of the Talmud Scriptures&quot;, created over a three-day period in 1968 and published in 1971. The book contains actual stories from the Talmud, proverbs, ethics, Jewish legal material, biographies of Talmudic rabbis, and personal stories about Tokayer and his family. Tokayer and Kase published a number of other books on Jewish themes together in Japanese.

The first South Korean publication of &quot;5,000 Years of Jewish Wisdom&quot; was in 1974, by Tae Zang publishing house. Many different editions followed in both Korea and China, often by black-market publishers. Between 2007 and 2009, Yong-soo Hyun of the Shema Yisrael Educational Institute published a 6-volume edition of the Korean Talmud, bringing together material from a variety of Tokayer&#x27;s earlier books. He worked with Tokayer to correct errors and Tokayer is listed as the author. Tutoring centers based on this and other works called &quot;Talmud&quot; for both adults and children are popular in Korea and &quot;Talmud&quot; books (all based on Tokayer&#x27;s works and not the original Talmud) are widely read and known.

=== Iran ===
In 2012, then-Vice President of Iran, Mohammad Reza Rahimi, claimed that the Talmud was the cause of the spread of narcotics in the country.

==Criticism==

Historian Michael Levi Rodkinson, in his book &quot;The History of the Talmud&quot;, wrote that detractors of the Talmud, both during and subsequent to its formation, &quot;have varied in their character, objects and actions&quot; and the book documents a number of critics and persecutors, including Nicholas Donin, Johannes Pfefferkorn, Johann Andreas Eisenmenger, the Frankists, and August Rohling. Many attacks come from antisemitic sources such as Justinas Pranaitis, Elizabeth Dilling, or David Duke. Criticisms also arise from Christian, Muslim, and Jewish sources, as well as from atheists and skeptics. Accusations against the Talmud include alleged:
# Anti-Christian or anti-gentile content
# Absurd or sexually immoral content
# Falsification of scripture

Defenders of the Talmud point out that many of these criticisms, particularly those in antisemitic sources, are based on quotations that are taken out of context, and thus misrepresent the meaning of the Talmud&#x27;s text and its basic character as a detailed record of discussions that preserved statements by a variety of sages, and from which statements and opinions that were rejected were never edited out.

Sometimes the misrepresentation is deliberate, and other times simply due to an inability to grasp the subtle and sometimes confusing and multi-faceted narratives in the Talmud. Some quotations provided by critics deliberately omit passages in order to generate quotes that appear to be offensive or insulting.

===Middle Ages===
At the very time that the Babylonian &quot;savoraim&quot; put the finishing touches to the redaction of the Talmud, the emperor Justinian issued his edict against &quot;deuterosis&quot; (doubling, repetition) of the Hebrew Bible. It is disputed whether, in this context, &quot;deuterosis&quot; means &quot;Mishnah&quot; or &quot;Targum&quot;: in patristic literature, the word is used in both senses.

Full-scale attacks on the Talmud took place in the 13th century in France, where Talmudic study was then flourishing. In the 1230s Nicholas Donin, a Jewish convert to Christianity, pressed 35 charges against the Talmud to Pope Gregory IX by translating a series of allegedly blasphemous passages about Jesus, Mary or Christianity. There is a quoted Talmudic passage, for example, where a person named Yeshu who some people have claimed is Jesus of Nazareth is sent to Gehenna to be boiled in excrement for eternity. Donin also selected an injunction of the Talmud that permits Jews to kill non-Jews. This led to the Disputation of Paris, which took place in 1240 at the court of Louis IX of France, where four rabbis, including Yechiel of Paris and Moses ben Jacob of Coucy, defended the Talmud against the accusations of Nicholas Donin. The translation of the Talmud from Aramaic to non-Jewish languages stripped Jewish discourse from its covering, something that was resented by Jews as a profound violation. The Disputation of Paris led to the condemnation and the first burning of copies of the Talmud in Paris in 1242. The burning of copies of the Talmud continued.

The Talmud was likewise the subject of the Disputation of Barcelona in 1263 between Nahmanides and Christian converts in which they argued if Jesus was the messiah prophesized in Judaism, Pablo Christiani. This same Pablo Christiani made an attack on the Talmud that resulted in a papal bull against the Talmud and in the first censorship, which was undertaken at Barcelona by a commission of Dominicans, who ordered the cancellation of passages deemed objectionable from a Christian perspective (1264).

At the Disputation of Tortosa in 1413, Geronimo de Santa Fé brought forward a number of accusations, including the fateful assertion that the condemnations of &quot;pagans&quot;, &quot;heathens&quot;, and &quot;apostates&quot; found in the Talmud were, in reality, veiled references to Christians. These assertions were denied by the Jewish community and its scholars, who contended that Judaic thought made a sharp distinction between those classified as heathen or pagan, being polytheistic, and those who acknowledge one true God (such as the Christians) even while worshipping the true monotheistic God incorrectly. Thus, Jews viewed Christians as misguided and in error, but not among the &quot;heathens&quot; or &quot;pagans&quot; discussed in the Talmud.

Both Pablo Christiani and Geronimo de Santa Fé, in addition to criticizing the Talmud, also regarded it as a source of authentic traditions, some of which could be used as arguments in favor of Christianity. Examples of such traditions were statements that the Messiah was born around the time of the destruction of the Temple and that the Messiah sat at the right hand of God.

In 1415, Antipope Benedict XIII, who had convened the Tortosa disputation, issued a papal bull (which was destined, however, to remain inoperative) forbidding the Jews to read the Talmud, and ordering the destruction of all copies of it. Far more important were the charges made in the early part of the 16th century by the convert Johannes Pfefferkorn, the agent of the Dominicans. The result of these accusations was a struggle in which the emperor and the pope acted as judges, the advocate of the Jews being Johann Reuchlin, who was opposed by the obscurantists; and this controversy, which was carried on for the most part by means of pamphlets, became in the eyes of some a precursor of the Reformation.

An unexpected result of this affair was the complete printed edition of the Babylonian Talmud issued in 1520 by Daniel Bomberg at Venice, under the protection of a papal privilege. Three years later, in 1523, Bomberg published the first edition of the Jerusalem Talmud. After thirty years the Vatican, which had first permitted the Talmud to appear in print, undertook a campaign of destruction against it. On the New Year, Rosh Hashanah (September 9, 1553) the copies of the Talmud confiscated in compliance with a decree of the Inquisition were burned at Rome, in Campo dei Fiori (auto de fé). Other burnings took place in other Italian cities, such as the one instigated by Joshua dei Cantori at Cremona in 1559. Censorship of the Talmud and other Hebrew works was introduced by a papal bull issued in 1554; five years later the Talmud was included in the first Index Expurgatorius; and Pope Pius IV commanded, in 1565, that the Talmud be deprived of its very name. The convention of referring to the work as &quot;Shas&quot; (&quot;shishah sidre Mishnah&quot;) instead of &quot;Talmud&quot; dates from this time.

The first edition of the expurgated Talmud, on which most subsequent editions were based, appeared at Basel (1578–1581) with the omission of the entire treatise of &#x27;Abodah Zarah and of passages considered inimical to Christianity, together with modifications of certain phrases. A fresh attack on the Talmud was decreed by Pope Gregory XIII (1575–85), and in 1593 Clement VIII renewed the old interdiction against reading or owning it. The increasing study of the Talmud in Poland led to the issue of a complete edition (Kraków, 1602–05), with a restoration of the original text; an edition containing, so far as known, only two treatises had previously been published at Lublin (1559–76). After an attack on the Talmud took place in Poland (in what is now Ukrainian territory) in 1757, when Bishop Dembowski, at the instigation of the Frankists, convened a public disputation at Kamieniec Podolski, and ordered all copies of the work found in his bishopric to be confiscated and burned. A &quot;1735 edition of Moed Katan, printed in Frankfurt am Oder&quot; is among those that survived from that era. &quot;Situated on the Oder River, Three separate editions of the Talmud were printed there between 1697 and 1739.&quot;

The external history of the Talmud includes also the literary attacks made upon it by some Christian theologians after the Reformation since these onslaughts on Judaism were directed primarily against that work, the leading example being Eisenmenger&#x27;s &quot;Entdecktes Judenthum&quot; (Judaism Unmasked) (1700). In contrast, the Talmud was a subject of rather more sympathetic study by many Christian theologians, jurists and Orientalists from the Renaissance on, including Johann Reuchlin, John Selden, Petrus Cunaeus, John Lightfoot and Johannes Buxtorf father and son.

===19th century and after===
The Vilna edition of the Talmud was subject to Russian government censorship, or self-censorship to meet government expectations, though this was less severe than some previous attempts: the title &quot;Talmud&quot; was retained and the tractate Avodah Zarah was included. Most modern editions are either copies of or closely based on the Vilna edition, and therefore still omit most of the disputed passages. Although they were not available for many generations, the removed sections of the Talmud, Rashi, Tosafot and Maharsha were preserved through rare printings of lists of &quot;errata&quot;, known as &quot;Chesronos Hashas&quot; (&quot;Omissions of the Talmud&quot;). Many of these censored portions were recovered from uncensored manuscripts in the Vatican Library. Some modern editions of the Talmud contain some or all of this material, either at the back of the book, in the margin, or in its original location in the text.

In 1830, during a debate in the French Chamber of Peers regarding state recognition of the Jewish faith, Admiral Verhuell declared himself unable to forgive the Jews whom he had met during his travels throughout the world either for their refusal to recognize Jesus as the Messiah or for their possession of the Talmud. In the same year the Abbé Chiarini published a voluminous work entitled &quot;Théorie du Judaïsme&quot;, in which he announced a translation of the Talmud, advocating for the first time a version that would make the work generally accessible, and thus serve for attacks on Judaism: only two out of the projected six volumes of this translation appeared. In a like spirit 19th-century antisemitic agitators often urged that a translation be made; and this demand was even brought before legislative bodies, as in Vienna. The Talmud and the &quot;Talmud Jew&quot; thus became objects of antisemitic attacks, for example in August Rohling&#x27;s &quot;Der Talmudjude&quot; (1871), although, on the other hand, they were defended by many Christian students of the Talmud, notably Hermann Strack.

Further attacks from antisemitic sources include Justinas Pranaitis&#x27; &quot;The Talmud Unmasked: The Secret Rabbinical Teachings Concerning Christians&quot; (1892) and Elizabeth Dilling&#x27;s &quot;The Plot Against Christianity&quot; (1964). The criticisms of the Talmud in many modern pamphlets and websites are often recognizable as verbatim quotations from one or other of these.

Historians Will and Ariel Durant noted a lack of consistency between the many authors of the Talmud, with some tractates in the wrong order, or subjects dropped and resumed without reason. According to the Durants, the Talmud &quot;is not the product of deliberation, it is the deliberation itself.&quot;

===Contemporary accusations===
The Internet is another source of criticism of the Talmud. The Anti-Defamation League&#x27;s report on this topic states that antisemitic critics of the Talmud frequently use erroneous translations or selective quotations in order to distort the meaning of the Talmud&#x27;s text, and sometimes fabricate passages. In addition, the critics rarely provide the full context of the quotations and fail to provide contextual information about the culture that the Talmud was composed in, nearly 2,000 years ago.

One such example concerns the line: &quot;If a Jew be called upon to explain any part of the rabbinic books, he ought to give only a false explanation. One who transgresses this commandment will be put to death.&quot; This is alleged to be a quote from a book titled &quot;Libbre David&quot; (alternatively &quot;Livore David&quot;). No such book exists in the Talmud or elsewhere. The title is assumed to be a corruption of &quot;Dibre David&quot;, a work published in 1671. Reference to the quote is found in an early Holocaust denial book, &quot;The Six Million Reconsidered&quot; by William Grimstad.

Gil Student, Book Editor of the Orthodox Union&#x27;s Jewish Action magazine, states that many attacks on the Talmud are merely recycling discredited material that originated in the 13th-century disputations, particularly from Raymond Marti and Nicholas Donin, and that the criticisms are based on quotations taken out of context and are sometimes entirely fabricated.

<text>TWERPS (The World&#x27;s Easiest Role-Playing System) is a minimalist role-playing game (RPG) originally created by Reindeer Games in 1987 (whose sole product was the &quot;TWERPS&quot; line) and distributed by Gamescience. Presented as a parody of the complicated RPG systems which were prevalent at the time while still being a playable game in its own right, its simple structure and humorous nature gave it unexpected popularity. 

==Description==
&quot;TWERPS&quot;, [(T)he (W)orld&#x27;s (E)asiest (R)ole-(P)laying (S)ystem)], is a humorous universal system of minimalist rules. Characters have only one ability, Strength. Rules sections cover Strength, Combat, and &quot;How to Do Everything.&quot; The game includes a sample character sheet, a combat hex sheet, cardstock miniatures, and an introductory micro-mini-scenario.

The actual rules of the game are indeed extremely simple. Characters are defined by a single attribute, &quot;Strength&quot;, which is used for determining all traditional role-playing elements, such as whether or not the character successfully hits in combat, how fast they can move and how much damage they can take before dying. A de facto skill system exists in the form of &quot;character classes&quot; which give numerical bonuses to certain activities if their role called for it (for instance, a pilot having a +1 modifier on their roll to fly an aircraft).

==Publication history==
&quot;TWERPS&quot; was originally created, written and illustrated (in a distinctive cartoony style) by &quot;Jeff &amp; &#x27;Manda Dee&quot;, Jeff Dee being a noted game illustrator and co-writer of &quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot;. It was published by Reindeer Games in 1987 as a digest-sized 8-page pamphlet, with four cardstock sheets.

===First Edition titles===
Originally each installment of the &quot;TWERPS&quot; system was sold in a small plastic bag containing an 8-page leaflet, a sheet of cardstock counters to be cut apart, little cardstock hex-maps and a tiny ten-sided die, each being a downsized imitation of elements often found in larger, more elaborate games. The initial run of titles was printed at low cost with black ink on various colored papers to distinguish the various titles (the main rules were on pink paper, the kung-fu rules were on yellow, and so on).

*&quot;TWERPS Basic Rules&quot;: the core system, including the sample adventure &quot;Watery Depths&quot;.
*&quot;Fly By Knights&quot;: a fantasy setting, describing very succinctly the world of Arkosa where characters ride various breeds of aerial mounts, stalk the fearsome Meganocerous and vie for knighthood.
*&quot;Magic&quot;: a rules expansion outlining a surprisingly detailed (for TWERPS anyway) magic system and spell-list.
*&quot;Space Cadets&quot;: guidelines for a space opera setting, in the form of various types of character classes, SF weaponry and psychic powers. Basic rules for vehicles were included.
*&quot;Kung Fu Dragons&quot;: a list of various martial arts which characters could train in and a system of colored belts to reward them. One of the cardstock extras was a tiny Game-master&#x27;s screen.

===Second Edition titles===
As the game grew in popularity, the supplements were re-printed in expanded form with more pages and multi-color printing. New supplements covering new genres and specific objects of parody were also added. These expansions and later supplements were mainly written by Norman F. Morin Jr., Brian Rayburn, Jon Hancock and Niels Erickson rather than Jeff &amp; &#x27;Manda Dee. The tone of these second edition titles was noticeably one of more overt humor and silliness, peppering the text with puns (and even calling on fans to mail in suggested puns of their own for future supplements).

*All of the First Edition titles described above were reprinted in expanded full-color form.
*&quot;Rocket Rangers&quot;: the companion to &quot;Space Cadets&quot;, this volume offered systems for spaceship design and combat and several sample ships. Unlike other 2nd edition titles, &quot;Rocket Rangers&quot; was mainly written by Jeff &amp; &#x27;Manda Dee.
*&quot;Twerps Twek&quot;: a direct parody of Star Trek, requiring &quot;Space Cadets&quot; and &quot;Rocket Rangers&quot; to use.
*&quot;Robo-Punks&quot;: rules for running Cyberpunk adventures, including brief systems for cybernetic implants and net-running.
*&quot;Superdudes&quot;: a list of super-powers for running superhero adventures.
*&quot;Metaphysical Ninja Maniac Chainsaw Vitamin Junkies&quot;: guidelines for running post-apocalyptic scenarios in the spirit of films like &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; (with a heavy addition of gonzo wackiness), including rules for vehicle damage and mutations.
*&quot;Twisted Tales of Terror&quot;: the horror supplement, with guidelines for creating monsters or playing monsters as player-characters.
*&quot;M.E.C.H.I.-Tech&quot;: a system for the design and battles between giant robots, with many direct riffs on the popular Battletech games.
*&quot;The T.W.E.R.P.S. Files&quot;: a direct parody of &quot;The X Files&quot;.
*&quot;How to Do Everything Better&quot;: a general rules expansion, offering more character classes, more superpowers and more equipment. Also included were rules for allowing &quot;TWERPS&quot; characters to gain dimension-travelling powers.

==Reception==
Stewart Wieck reviewed the product in the December 1986 to January 1987 issue of &quot;White Wolf&quot;. He downplayed generic role-playing games in general but noted this product was inexpensive, which was part of the appeal of these systems.

Game critic Rick Swan reviewed the game twice: 
* In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, Swan noted &quot;Obviously &quot;Twerps&quot; isn&#x27;t going to hold anyone&#x27;s attention for more than a few minutes, but those few minutes are actually kind of fun.&quot; Swan gave the game a rating of 2.5 out of 4. 
* In the September 1993 issue of &quot;Dragon&quot;, Swan commented &quot;So maybe it’s a joke. Billed as &#x27;The Worlds Easiest Role-Playing System,&#x27; the &quot;TWERPS&quot; game gets remarkable mileage out of a single statistic (Strength, determined by the roll of a 10-sided die) ... Considering its limits, &quot;TWERPS&quot; works surprisingly well.&quot;

Eric Jacobson reviewed &quot;TWERPS Basic Rules&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #47 (Sept., 1994), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;For [the price] you can&#x27;t lose. Releasing a horde of additional, inexpensive support books, Gamescience offers access to almost every gaming genre. For such a simple little game, it&#x27;s amazing what you can do.&quot;

<text>The Modern Lovers were an American rock band formed in Natick, Massachusetts in 1970 by Jonathan Richman. The original band existed from 1970 to 1974 but their recordings were not released until 1976 or later. It featured Richman and bassist Ernie Brooks with drummer David Robinson (later of the Cars) and keyboardist Jerry Harrison (later of Talking Heads). The sound of the band owed a great deal to the influence of the Velvet Underground and the Stooges, and is now sometimes classified as &quot;proto-punk&quot;. It pointed the way towards much of the punk rock, new wave, alternative and indie rock music of later decades. Their only album, the eponymous &quot;The Modern Lovers&quot;, contained idiosyncratic songs about dating awkwardness, growing up in Massachusetts, love of life, and the USA.

Later, between 1976 and 1988, Richman used the name Modern Lovers for a variety of backing bands, always billed as &quot;Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers&quot;. These bands were quieter and featured more low-key, often near-childlike songs as Richman drew on folk-rock and other genres. Of Richman&#x27;s original bandmates, only Robinson was part of any of the other Modern Lovers incarnations.

==The original Modern Lovers, 1970–1974==
Richman grew up in Natick, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, and began playing guitar and writing songs in his mid-teens, first performing solo in public in 1967. He became enamored of the Velvet Underground while he was still in high school, and after graduating in 1969, he moved to New York City where he became personally acquainted with the band and on one occasion opened the bill for them. Richman spent a couple of weeks sleeping on Velvets’ manager Steve Sesnick&#x27;s sofa before moving into the Hotel Albert, a residence known for its poor conditions.

After nine months in New York, and a trip to Europe and Israel, Richman moved back to his native Boston. With his childhood friend, guitarist John Felice, he organized a band modeled after the Velvets. They quickly recruited drummer David Robinson and bass player Rolfe Anderson, and christened themselves &quot;the Modern Lovers&quot;. They played their first date, supporting Andy Paley’s band the Sidewinders, in September 1970, barely a month after Richman&#x27;s return. By this time their setlist already included such noted Richman songs as &quot;Roadrunner&quot;, &quot;She Cracked&quot; and &quot;Hospital&quot;. Richman&#x27;s unique character was immediately apparent; he wore short hair and often performed wearing a jacket and tie, and frequently improvised new lyrics and monologues.

In early 1971 Anderson and Felice departed; they were replaced by Harvard students bassist Ernie Brooks, and keyboardist Jerry Harrison, completing the classic lineup of the Modern Lovers. This new configuration became very popular in the Boston area, and by the fall of 1971, enthusiastic word-of-mouth led to the Modern Lovers&#x27; first exposure to a major label when Stuart Love of Warner Bros. Records contacted them and organized the band&#x27;s first multi-track session at Intermedia Studio in Boston. The demo produced from this session, and the group&#x27;s live performances, generated more attention from the industry, including rave reviews from critic Lillian Roxon, and soon A&amp;M Records was interested in the band as well.

In April 1972, the Modern Lovers traveled to Los Angeles where they held two demo sessions: the first was produced by the Velvet Underground&#x27;s John Cale for Warner Bros. while the second was produced by Allan Mason for A&amp;M. These sessions were later used on the band&#x27;s debut album. While in California the band also performed live, and one gig at the Long Branch Saloon in Berkeley was later issued as a live album. Producer Kim Fowley courted the band, traveling to Boston to produce some poor-quality demos in June 1972. Felice rejoined the group for a few months after his graduation, and the band moved together to live in Cohasset, Massachusetts.

The Modern Lovers continued to be a popular live attraction, and on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1972 supported the New York Dolls at the Mercer Arts Center on a bill which also included Suicide and Wayne County. Early in 1973 they were finally signed by Warner Brothers. However, before returning to the studio in Los Angeles to work with Cale, the group accepted an offer to play a residency at the Inverurie Hotel in Bermuda, owned by the family of a friend of Ernie Brooks. While there, Richman heard and became strongly influenced by the laid-back style of the local musicians, as documented in his later song &quot;Monologue About Bermuda&quot;. There were also growing personality clashes among band members.

Although on the band&#x27;s return Richman agreed to record his earlier songs, he was anxious to move in a different musical direction. He wanted to scrap all of the tracks they had recorded and start over with a mellower, more lyrical sound. The rest of the band, while not opposed to such a shift later, insisted that they record as they sounded now. However, the sessions with Cale in September 1973 also coincided with the death of their friend Gram Parsons (a former Harvard student, like Harrison and Brooks), and produced no usable recordings. The record company then recruited Kim Fowley to produce more sessions with the band, this time at Gold Star Studios, with better results. Recordings from these sessions with Fowley were later released in 1981 on an album titled &quot;The Original Modern Lovers&quot; (reissued on CD by Bomp Records in 2000).

==Break-up and release of first album==
Following the failure to complete a debut album, Warner Brothers withdrew their support for the Modern Lovers, and Robinson left the band. They continued to perform live for a few months with new drummer Bob Turner, but Richman was increasingly unwilling to perform his old (although still unreleased) songs such as &quot;Roadrunner&quot;, and after a final disagreement between him and Harrison over musical style the band split up in February 1974.

Despite the original group&#x27;s premature break-up, many of its members found considerable success elsewhere: founding member John Felice formed the Real Kids, Jerry Harrison later joined Talking Heads, David Robinson co-founded the Cars, and Ernie Brooks would later work with David Johansen, Arthur Russell, Elliott Murphy, and Gary Lucas.

Richman continued recording on his own, eventually moving to California in 1975 to begin working with Beserkley Records whose boss Matthew King Kaufman had met Richman when he worked with A&amp;M. While Richman never returned to the Velvets-inspired sound of the original Modern Lovers, the demo recordings made with that group eventually surfaced in various formats. The first of these releases came in 1976 when Beserkley compiled a posthumous LP from the first two demo sessions produced by Cale and Mason; issued on Beserkley&#x27;s Home of the Hits subsidiary, the album was simply titled &quot;The Modern Lovers&quot; and included celebrated tracks such as &quot;Roadrunner&quot;, &quot;She Cracked&quot;, and &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot;.

Richman did not recognize this compilation as his &quot;first album,&quot; preferring to recognize his debut as 1976&#x27;s &quot;Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers,&quot; an album pursuing the lighter, softer direction he had in mind with a completely different band (the two collections were released within months of each other). However, &quot;The Modern Lovers&quot; was given an enthusiastic critical reception, with critic Ira Robbins hailing it as &quot;one of the truly great art rock albums of all time&quot;, and it influenced numerous aspiring punk rock musicians on both sides of the Atlantic, including the Sex Pistols (who covered &quot;Roadrunner&quot; on &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot;).

==Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers, 1976–1988==
In early 1976, Richman put together a new version of the Modern Lovers, with Leroy Radcliffe (guitar), Greg &#x27;Curly&#x27; Keranen (bass) and the returning David Robinson (drums). Keranen had previously played with the Rubinoos, and Radcliffe with Woody&#x27;s Truckstop. They recorded the album &quot;Jonathan Richman &amp; The Modern Lovers&quot; (1976), but Robinson again left after Richman persisted in reducing the size and volume of his drum kit, and was replaced by D. Sharpe. This band recorded the album &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll with the Modern Lovers&quot; (1977) and toured until Keranen left to go to college and was replaced by Asa Brebner, who played on the albums &quot;The Modern Lovers Live&quot; (1978) and &quot;Back in Your Life&quot; (1979). David &quot;D.&quot; Sharpe died in 1987, aged 39.

In 1980 Richman again formed a new Modern Lovers, with Keranen, drummer Michael Guardabascio and backing singers Ellie Marshall and Beth Harrington. They recorded the album &quot;Jonathan Sings!&quot; in 1981/82, but it was not released until 1983. The group toured to support the album, often regarded as one of Richman&#x27;s best, but split up after Keranen again left in 1984.

The final incarnation of the Modern Lovers, with Andy Paley, Brennan Totten and (initially) Asa Brebner again, toured and recorded between 1985 and 1988. Richman finally retired the Modern Lovers name after the album &quot;Modern Lovers 88&quot;.

Richman continues to perform, often solo and preferring acoustic instruments, and currently has no plans to undertake another group like his original band. A tribute album consisting primarily of Modern Lovers songs, &quot;If I Were a Richman: a Tribute to the Music of Jonathan Richman&quot;, was released by Wampus Multimedia in 2001. Asa Brebner died in 2019, aged 65.

==Influence==
The Modern Lovers band was influential on the then-burgeoning punk rock and later new wave and indie musical styles, as viewed in the feature-length 2015 documentary &quot;Danny Says&quot;.

John Cale, Iggy Pop and David Bowie have all covered &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot;; it was also covered by Los Angeles-area rock band Burning Sensations for the soundtrack of the 1984 Alex Cox film &quot;Repo Man&quot;; additionally the song was covered by the English post-punk band Television Personalities on their album &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Baby, It&#x27;s Only a Movie&quot;.

Seminal punk group the Sex Pistols covered &quot;Roadrunner&quot; on &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot;. Joan Jett sang &quot;Roadrunner&quot; on her cover album, &quot;The Hit List&quot;. In 2009 Titus Andronicus covered &quot;Roadrunner&quot; on its EP &quot;The Innocents Abroad – Live in London 23/02/09;&quot; this recording was subsequently included on the fan compilation &quot;Feats of Strength.&quot; Additional covers of &quot;Roadrunner&quot; include those by Wire and Richman&#x27;s labelmates the Greg Kihn Band.

English rock band Echo &amp; the Bunnymen covered &quot;She Cracked&quot; live on &quot;Crystal Days&quot; in 1985, although with some altered lyrics. Siouxsie and the Banshees released &quot;She Cracked&quot; as the extra b-side of &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s on Fire&quot; 1987 double-pack 7-inch, collected on &quot;Downside Up&quot;. Additionally, American grunge band Seaweed covered &quot;She Cracked&quot; on the &quot;John Peel Sub-Pop Sessions&quot; album, in 1994.

More recently, Aloe Blacc performed the band&#x27;s &quot;New Kind of Neighborhood&quot; in a series of television advertisements for Google.

<doc id="30353" wikidata="Q8338" url="?curid=30353" title="Trumpet">
<text>The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet—with the highest register in the brass family—to the bass trumpet, pitched one octave below the standard B or C trumpet.

Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to the 2nd Millenium BC. They began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, appearing in orchestras, concert bands, chamber music groups, and jazz ensembles. They are also common in popular music and are generally included in school bands. Sound is produced by vibrating the lips in a mouthpiece, which starts a standing wave in the air column of the instrument. Since the late 15th century, trumpets have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape.

There are many distinct types of trumpet. The most common is a transposing instrument pitched in B with a tubing length of about . The cornet is similar to the trumpet but has a conical bore (the trumpet has a cylindrical bore) and its tubing is generally wound differently. Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing, whereas modern instruments generally have three (or sometimes four) valves in order to change their pitch. Most trumpets have valves of the piston type, while some have the rotary type. The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings (especially in German and German-style orchestras), although this practice varies by country. A musician who plays the trumpet is called a &quot;trumpet player&quot; or &quot;trumpeter&quot;.

==Etymology==

The English word &quot;trumpet&quot; was first used in the late 14th century. The word came from Old French , which is a diminutive of . The word &quot;trump&quot;, meaning &quot;trumpet&quot;, was first used in English in 1300. The word comes from Old French &#x27;long, tube-like musical wind instrument&#x27; ( 1100s), cognate with Provençal , Italian , all probably from a Germanic source (compare Old High German , Old Norse &#x27;trumpet&#x27;), of imitative origin.&quot;

==History==

The earliest trumpets date back to 2000 BC and earlier. The bronze and silver Tutankhamun&#x27;s trumpets from his grave in Egypt, bronze lurs from Scandinavia, and metal trumpets from China date back to this period. Trumpets from the Oxus civilization (3rd millennium BC) of Central Asia have decorated swellings in the middle, yet are made out of one sheet of metal, which is considered a technical wonder for its time.

The Salpinx was a straight trumpet long, made of bone or bronze. Homer’s &quot;Iliad&quot; (9th or 8th century BCE) contain the earliest reference to its sound and further, frequent descriptions are found throughout the Classical Period. Salpinx contests were a part of the original Olympic Games. The Shofar, made from a ram horn and the Hatzotzeroth, made of metal, are both mentioned in the Bible. They were said to have been played in Solomon&#x27;s Temple around 3,000 years ago. They are still used on certain religious days.

The Moche people of ancient Peru depicted trumpets in their art going back to AD 300. The earliest trumpets were signaling instruments used for military or religious purposes, rather than music in the modern sense; and the modern bugle continues this signaling tradition.
Improvements to instrument design and metal making in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance led to an increased usefulness of the trumpet as a musical instrument. The natural trumpets of this era consisted of a single coiled tube without valves and therefore could only produce the notes of a single overtone series. Changing keys required the player to change crooks of the instrument. The development of the upper, &quot;clarino&quot; register by specialist trumpeters—notably Cesare Bendinelli—would lend itself well to the Baroque era, also known as the &quot;Golden Age of the natural trumpet.&quot; During this period, a vast body of music was written for virtuoso trumpeters. The art was revived in the mid-20th century and natural trumpet playing is again a thriving art around the world. Many modern players in Germany and the UK who perform Baroque music use a version of the natural trumpet fitted with three or four vent holes to aid in correcting out-of-tune notes in the harmonic series.

The melody-dominated homophony of the classical and romantic periods relegated the trumpet to a secondary role by most major composers owing to the limitations of the natural trumpet. Berlioz wrote in 1844:

Notwithstanding the real loftiness and distinguished nature of its quality of tone, there are few instruments that have been more degraded (than the trumpet). Down to Beethoven and Weber, every composer – not excepting Mozart – persisted in confining it to the unworthy function of filling up, or in causing it to sound two or three commonplace rhythmical formulae.
==Construction==
The trumpet is constructed of brass tubing bent twice into a rounded oblong shape. As with all brass instruments, sound is produced by blowing air through slightly separated lips, producing a &quot;buzzing&quot; sound into the mouthpiece and starting a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the trumpet. The player can select the pitch from a range of overtones or harmonics by changing the lip aperture and tension (known as the embouchure).

The mouthpiece has a circular rim, which provides a comfortable environment for the lips&#x27; vibration. Directly behind the rim is the cup, which channels the air into a much smaller opening (the back bore or shank) that tapers out slightly to match the diameter of the trumpet&#x27;s lead pipe. The dimensions of these parts of the mouthpiece affect the timbre or quality of sound, the ease of playability, and player comfort. Generally, the wider and deeper the cup, the darker the sound and timbre.

Modern trumpets have three (or, infrequently, four) piston valves, each of which increases the length of tubing when engaged, thereby lowering the pitch. The first valve lowers the instrument&#x27;s pitch by a whole step (two semitones), the second valve by a half step (one semitone), and the third valve by one and a half steps (three semitones). Having three valves provides eight possible valve combinations (including &quot;none&quot;), but only seven different tubing lengths, because the third valve alone gives essentially the same tubing length as the 1–2 combination. (In practice there is often a deliberately designed slight difference between &quot;1–2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;, and in that case trumpet players will select the alternative that gives the best tuning for the particular note being played.) When a fourth valve is present, as with some piccolo trumpets, it usually lowers the pitch a perfect fourth (five semitones). Used singly and in combination these valves make the instrument fully chromatic, i.e., able to play all twelve pitches of classical music. For more information about the different types of valves, see Brass instrument valves.

The overall pitch of the trumpet can be raised or lowered by the use of the tuning slide. Pulling the slide out lowers the pitch; pushing the slide in raises it. Pitch can be &quot;bent&quot; using the embouchure only.

To overcome the problems of intonation and reduce the use of the slides, Renold Schilke designed the tuning-bell trumpet. Removing the usual brace between the bell and a valve body allows the use of a sliding bell; the player may then tune the horn with the bell while leaving the slide pushed in, or nearly so, thereby improving intonation and overall response.

A trumpet becomes a closed tube when the player presses it to the lips; therefore, the instrument only naturally produces every other overtone of the harmonic series. The shape of the bell makes the missing overtones audible. Most notes in the series are slightly out of tune and modern trumpets have slide mechanisms for the first and third valves with which the player can compensate by &quot;throwing&quot; (extending) or retracting one or both slides, using the left thumb and ring finger for the first and third valve slides respectively.

Trumpets can be constructed from other materials, including plastic.

==Types==
The most common type is the B trumpet, but A, C, D, E, E, low F, and G trumpets are also available. The C trumpet is most common in American orchestral playing, where it is used alongside the B trumpet. Orchestral trumpet players are adept at transposing music at sight, frequently playing music written for the A, B, D, E, E or F trumpet as well as for the B, C, F or G trumpet (which is used more rarely) on the C trumpet or B trumpet.

The smallest trumpets are referred to as piccolo trumpets. The most common models are built to play in both B and A, with separate leadpipes for each key. The tubing in the B piccolo trumpet is one-half the length of that in a standard B trumpet making it sound an octave higher. Piccolo trumpets in G, F and C are also manufactured, but are less common. Almost all piccolo trumpets have four valves instead of three—the fourth valve usually lowers the pitch by a fourth, making some lower notes accessible and creating alternate fingerings for certain trills. Maurice André, Håkan Hardenberger, David Mason, and Wynton Marsalis are some well-known trumpet players known for their virtuosity on the piccolo trumpet.
Trumpets pitched in the key of low G are also called sopranos, or soprano bugles, after their adaptation from military bugles. Traditionally used in drum and bugle corps, sopranos employ either rotary valves or piston valves.

The bass trumpet is at the same pitch as a trombone and is usually played by a trombone player, although its music is written in treble clef. Most bass trumpets are pitched in either C or B. The C bass trumpet sounds an octave lower than written, and the B bass sounds a major ninth (B) lower, making them both transposing instruments.

The historical slide trumpet was probably first developed in the late 14th century for use in alta cappella wind bands. Deriving from early straight trumpets, the Renaissance slide trumpet was essentially a natural trumpet with a sliding leadpipe. This single slide was awkward, as the entire instrument moved, and the range of the slide was probably no more than a major third. Originals were probably pitched in D, to fit with shawms in D and G, probably at a typical pitch standard near A=466 Hz. No known instruments from this period survive, so the details—and even the existence—of a Renaissance slide trumpet is a matter of debate among scholars. While there is documentation (written and artistic) of its existence, there is also conjecture that its slide would have been impractical.

Some slide trumpet designs saw use in England in the 18th century.

The pocket trumpet is a compact B trumpet. The bell is usually smaller than a standard trumpet bell and the tubing is more tightly wound to reduce the instrument size without reducing the total tube length. Its design is not standardized, and the quality of various models varies greatly. It can have a unique warm sound and voice-like articulation. Since many pocket trumpet models suffer from poor design as well as poor manufacturing, the intonation, tone color and dynamic range of such instruments are severely hindered. Professional-standard instruments are, however, available. While they are not a substitute for the full-sized instrument, they can be useful in certain contexts. The jazz musician Don Cherry was renowned for his playing of the pocket instrument.

The tubing of the bell section of a herald trumpet is straight, making it long enough to accommodate a hanging banner. This instrument is mostly used for ceremonial events such as parades and fanfares.

David Monette designed the flumpet in 1989 for jazz musician Art Farmer. It is a hybrid of a trumpet and a flugelhorn, pitched in B and using three piston valves.

Other variations include rotary-valve, or German, trumpets (which are commonly used in professional German and Austrian orchestras), alto and Baroque trumpets, and the Vienna valve trumpet (primarily used in Viennese brass ensembles and orchestras such as the Vienna Philharmonic and Mnozil Brass).

The trumpet is often confused with its close relative the cornet, which has a more conical tubing shape compared to the trumpet&#x27;s more cylindrical tube. This, along with additional bends in the cornet&#x27;s tubing, gives the cornet a slightly mellower tone, but the instruments are otherwise nearly identical. They have the same length of tubing and, therefore, the same pitch, so music written for one of them is playable on the other. Another relative, the flugelhorn, has tubing that is even more conical than that of the cornet, and an even mellower tone. It is sometimes supplied with a fourth valve to improve the intonation of some lower notes.

==Playing==

===Fingering===
On any modern trumpet, cornet, or flugelhorn, pressing the valves indicated by the numbers below produces the written notes shown. &quot;Open&quot; means all valves up, &quot;1&quot; means first valve, &quot;1–2&quot; means first and second valve simultaneously, and so on. The sounding pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument. Engaging the fourth valve, if present, usually drops any of these pitches by a perfect fourth as well. Within each overtone series, the different pitches are attained by changing the embouchure. 
Each overtone series on the trumpet begins with the first overtone—the fundamental of each overtone series cannot be produced except as a pedal tone. Notes in parentheses are the sixth overtone, representing a pitch with a frequency of seven times that of the fundamental; while this pitch is close to the note shown, it is flat relative to equal temperament, and use of those fingerings is generally avoided.

The fingering schema arises from the length of each valve&#x27;s tubing (a longer tube produces a lower pitch). Valve &quot;1&quot; increases the tubing length enough to lower the pitch by one whole step, valve &quot;2&quot; by one half step, and valve &quot;3&quot; by one and a half steps. This scheme and the nature of the overtone series create the possibility of alternate fingerings for certain notes. For example, third-space &quot;C&quot; can be produced with no valves engaged (standard fingering) or with valves 2–3. Also, any note produced with 1–2 as its standard fingering can also be produced with valve 3 – each drops the pitch by steps. Alternate fingerings may be used to improve facility in certain passages, or to aid in intonation. Extending the third valve slide when using the fingerings 1–3 or 1-2-3 further lowers the pitch slightly to improve intonation.

Some of the partials of the harmonic series that a modern B trumpet can play for each combination of valves pressed are in tune with 12-tone equal temperament and some are not.

==Mutes==

Various types of mutes can be placed in or over the bell, which decreases volume and changes timbre. Trumpets have a wide selection of mutes: common ones include the straight mute, cup mute, harmon mute (wah-wah or wow-wow mute, among other names), plunger, bucket mute, and practice mute. A straight mute is generally used when the type of mute is not specified. Jazz and commercial music call for a wider range of mutes than most classical music and many mutes were invented for jazz orchestrators.

Mutes can be made of many materials, including fiberglass, plastic, cardboard, metal, and &quot;stone lining&quot;, a trade name of the Humes &amp; Berg company. They are often held in place with cork. To better keep the mute in place, players sometimes dampen the cork by blowing warm, moist air on it.

The straight mute is conical and constructed of either metal (usually aluminum)—which produces a bright, piercing sound—or another material, which produces a darker, stuffier sound. The cup mute is shaped like a straight mute with an additional, bell-facing cup at the end, and produces a darker tone than a straight mute. The harmon mute is made of metal (usually aluminum or copper) and consists of a &quot;stem&quot; inserted into a large chamber. The stem can be extended or removed to produce different timbres, and waving one&#x27;s hand in front of the mute produces a &quot;wah-wah&quot; sound, hence the mute&#x27;s colloquial name.

==Range==

Using standard technique, the lowest note is the written F below middle C. There is no actual limit to how high brass instruments can play, but fingering charts generally go up to the high C two octaves above middle C. Several trumpeters have achieved fame for their proficiency in the extreme high register, among them Maynard Ferguson, Cat Anderson, Dizzy Gillespie, Doc Severinsen, John Madrid, and more recently Wayne Bergeron, Louis Dowdeswell, Thomas Gansch, James Morrison, Jon Faddis and Arturo Sandoval. It is also possible to produce pedal tones below the low F, which is a device occasionally employed in the contemporary repertoire for the instrument.

==Extended technique==
Contemporary music for the trumpet makes wide uses of extended trumpet techniques.

Flutter tonguing: The trumpeter rolls the tip of the tongue (as if rolling an &quot;R&quot; in Spanish) to produce a &#x27;growling like&#x27; tone. This technique is widely employed by composers like Berio and Stockhausen.

Growling: Simultaneously playing tone and using the back of the tongue to vibrate the uvula, creating a distinct sound. Most trumpet players will use a plunger with this technique to achieve a particular sound heard in a lot of Chicago Jazz of the 1950s.

Double tonguing: The player articulates using the syllables &quot;.

Triple tonguing: The same as double tonguing, but with the syllables &quot;.

Doodle tongue: The trumpeter tongues as if saying the word &quot;doodle&quot;. This is a very faint tonguing similar in sound to a valve tremolo.

Glissando: Trumpeters can slide between notes by depressing the valves halfway and changing the lip tension. Modern repertoire makes extensive use of this technique.

Vibrato: It is often regulated in contemporary repertoire through specific notation. Composers can call for everything from fast, slow or no vibrato to actual rhythmic patterns played with vibrato.

Pedal tone: Composers have written notes as low as two-and-a-half octaves below the low F at the bottom of the standard range. Extreme low pedals are produced by slipping the lower lip out of the mouthpiece. Claude Gordon assigned pedals as part of his trumpet practice routines, that were a systematic expansion on his lessons with Herbert L. Clarke. The technique was pioneered by Bohumir Kryl.

Microtones: Composers such as Scelsi and Stockhausen have made wide use of the trumpet&#x27;s ability to play microtonally. Some instruments feature a fourth valve that provides a quarter-tone step between each note. The jazz musician Ibrahim Maalouf uses such a trumpet, invented by his father to make it possible to play Arab maqams.

Valve tremolo: Many notes on the trumpet can be played in several different valve combinations. By alternating between valve combinations on the same note, a tremolo effect can be created. Berio makes extended use of this technique in his &quot;Sequenza X.&quot;

Noises: By hissing, clicking, or breathing through the instrument, the trumpet can be made to resonate in ways that do not sound at all like a trumpet. Noises may require amplification.

Preparation: Composers have called for trumpeters to play under water, or with certain slides removed. It is increasingly common for composers to specify all sorts of preparations for trumpet. Extreme preparations involve alternate constructions, such as double bells and extra valves.

Split tone: Trumpeters can produce more than one tone simultaneously by vibrating the two lips at different speeds. The interval produced is usually an octave or a fifth.

Lip-trill or shake: Also known as &quot;lip-slurs&quot;. By rapidly varying air speed, but not changing the depressed valves, the pitch can vary quickly between adjacent harmonic partials. Shakes and lip-trills can vary in speed, and in the distance between the partials. However, lip-trills and shakes usually involve the next partial up from the written note.

Multi-phonics: Playing a note and &quot;humming&quot; a different note simultaneously. For example, sustaining a middle C and humming a major 3rd &quot;E&quot; at the same time.

Circular breathing: A technique wind players use to produce uninterrupted tone, without pauses for breaths. The player puffs up the cheeks, storing air, then breathes in rapidly through the nose while using the cheeks to continue pushing air outwards.

===Instruction and method books===
One trumpet method is Jean-Baptiste Arban&#x27;s &quot;Complete Conservatory Method for Trumpet (Cornet)&quot;. Other well-known method books include &quot;Technical Studies&quot; by Herbert L. Clarke, &quot;Grand Method&quot; by Louis Saint-Jacome, &quot;Daily Drills and Technical Studies&quot; by Max Schlossberg, and methods by Ernest S. Williams, Claude Gordon, Charles Colin, James Stamp, and Louis Davidson. A common method book for beginners is the Walter Beeler&#x27;s &quot;Method for the Cornet&quot;, and there have been several instruction books written by virtuoso Allen Vizzutti. Merri Franquin wrote a &quot;Complete Method for Modern Trumpet&quot;, which fell into obscurity for much of the twentieth century until public endorsements by Maurice André revived interest in this work.

==Players==

In early jazz, Louis Armstrong was well known for his virtuosity and his improvisations on the Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings, and his switch from cornet to trumpet is often cited as heralding the trumpet&#x27;s dominance over the cornet in jazz. Dizzy Gillespie was a gifted improviser with an extremely high (but musical) range, building on the style of Roy Eldridge but adding new layers of harmonic complexity. Gillespie had an enormous impact on virtually every subsequent trumpeter, both by the example of his playing and as a mentor to younger musicians. Miles Davis is widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century—his style was distinctive and widely imitated. Davis&#x27; phrasing and sense of space in his solos have been models for generations of jazz musicians. Cat Anderson was a trumpet player who was known for the ability to play extremely high with an even more extreme volume, who played with Duke Ellington&#x27;s Big Band. Maynard Ferguson came to prominence playing in Stan Kenton&#x27;s orchestra, before forming his own band in 1957. He was noted for being able to play accurately in a remarkably high register.

==Repertoire==
===Solos===
In the 1790s Anton Weidinger developed the first successful keyed trumpet, capable of playing chromatically. Joseph Haydn&#x27;s Trumpet Concerto was written for him in 1796 and startled contemporary audiences by its novelty, a fact shown off by some stepwise melodies played low in the instrument&#x27;s range.

<text>Adrian Nicholas Matthews Thaws (born 27 January 1968), better known by his stage name Tricky, is a British music artist, record producer, vocalist and rapper. Born and raised in Bristol, in southwest England, he began his career as an early member of the band Massive Attack, alongside Robert Del Naja, Grant Marshall and Andrew Vowles. Through his work with Massive Attack and other artists, Tricky became a major figure in the Bristol underground scene, which gave rise to multiple internationally recognized artists and the music genre of trip hop.

Tricky embarked on a solo career with his debut album, &quot;Maxinquaye&quot;, in 1995. The release won Tricky popular acclaim and marked the beginning of a lengthy collaborative partnership with vocalist Martina Topley-Bird. He released four more studio albums before the end of the decade, including &quot;Pre-Millennium Tension&quot; and the pseudonymous &quot;Nearly God&quot;, both in 1996. He has gone on to release nine studio albums since 2000, most recently &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; (2020). In 2016, he joined Massive Attack on stage for the first time in two decades while continuing his solo career.

Tricky is a pioneer of trip hop music, and his work is noted for its dark, layered musical style that blends disparate cultural influences and genres, including hip hop, alternative rock, and ragga. He has collaborated with a wide range of artists over the course of his career, including Terry Hall, Björk, Gravediggaz, Alanis Morissette, Grace Jones and PJ Harvey.

==Early life==
Tricky was born Adrian Nicholas Matthews Thaws on 27 January 1968 in Knowle West, Bristol, to a black Jamaican father and a part-white, part-black, Anglo-Ghanaian mother. His mother, Maxine Quaye, died either by suicide or due to epilepsy complications when Tricky was four. His father, Roy Thaws, operated the Studio 17 sound system (formerly known as &quot;Tarzan the High Priest&quot;) with his brother Rupert and his own father, Hector. Bristol musician Bunny Marrett claimed in 2012, &quot;It became the most popular sound system in Bristol at the time.&quot;

Tricky experienced a difficult childhood in Knowle West, an economically deprived area in Southern Bristol. He became involved in crime at an early age, joining a gang that was involved in car theft, burglary, fights, and promiscuity. Tricky spent his youth in the care of his grandmother, who often let him watch old horror films instead of going to school. At 15, he began to write lyrics (&quot;I like to rock, I like to dance, I like pretty girls taking down their pants&quot;, &quot;MixMag&quot;, 1996). When he was 17, he spent some time in prison after purchasing forged £50 notes from a friend, who later informed the police. Tricky stated in an interview afterward, &quot;Prison was really good. I&#x27;m never going back.&quot;

==Career==
===1987–1994: The Wild Bunch, Massive Attack===
In the mid-1980s, Tricky met DJ Milo and spent time with a sound system called the Wild Bunch, which, by 1987, evolved into Massive Attack. He received the nickname &quot;Tricky Kid,&quot; and, at age 18, became a member of the Fresh 4, a rap group built from the Wild Bunch. He also rapped on Massive Attack&#x27;s acclaimed debut album, &quot;Blue Lines&quot; (1991).

In 1991, before the release of &quot;Blue Lines&quot;, he met Martina Topley-Bird in Bristol. Some time later, she came to his house and mentioned to Tricky and Mark Stewart that she could sing. Martina was only 15 years old, but her &quot;honey-coated vox&quot; impressed them, and they recorded a song called &quot;Aftermath&quot; (although &quot;The Face&quot; &#x27;95 mentions that the first song they recorded together was called &quot;Shoebox&quot;). Tricky showed &quot;Aftermath&quot; to Massive Attack, but they were not interested. In 1993, he decided to press a few hundred vinyl copies of the song. In 1995, a white label record got him a contract with Island Records, and he started to record his first solo album, &quot;Maxinquaye&quot;.

===1995–2001: Solo breakthrough===

Tricky left Massive Attack to release his debut album, &quot;Maxinquaye&quot;, co-produced by himself and Mark Saunders and prominently featuring singer Martina Topley-Bird. The album was successful, and Tricky consequently attained international fame, something he was notably uncomfortable with. The &quot;Maxinquaye&quot; album review by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; read: &quot;Tricky devoured everything from American hip-hop and soul to reggae and the more melancholic strains of &#x27;80s British rock&quot;.

Authors David Hesmondhalgh and Caspar Melville wrote in the book &quot;Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA&quot;: &quot;Tricky showed his debt to hip-hop aesthetics by reconstructualising samples and slices of both the most respected black music (Public Enemy) and the tackiest pop (quoting David Cassidy&#x27;s &quot;How Can I Be Sure?&quot;).&quot; As the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article further explained, Tricky created &quot;a mercurial style of dance music that immediately finds own fast feet.&quot;

Tricky failed to complete a number of lyrics begun for the Massive Attack album &quot;Protection&quot; and gave the band some of the lyrics he had written for &quot;Maxinquaye&quot; instead. So, there&#x27;s significant overlap in the lyrics of songs on the two albums—specifically with &quot;Overcome&quot; on &quot;Maxinquaye&quot; and &quot;Karmacoma&quot; on &quot;Protection&quot;; and &quot;Hell is &#x27;Round the Corner&quot; on &quot;Maxinquaye&quot; and &quot;Eurochild&quot; on &quot;Protection.&quot; Tricky found it difficult to cope with the huge success of &quot;Maxinquaye&quot; and subsequently eschewed the laidback soul sound of the first album to create an increasingly edgy and aggressive punk style of music.

In 1996, Neneh Cherry and Björk appeared as guests on his second album &quot;Nearly God&quot;. The opening number was a cover of the Siouxsie and the Banshees pre-trip-hop song &quot;Tattoo&quot; that had previously inspired Tricky when he forged his style.

In 2001, Tricky appeared on the &quot;Thirteen Ghosts&quot; soundtrack with the song &quot;Excess&quot; which (briefly) features Alanis Morissette during two of the choruses. In 2002, that song also appeared on the &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; soundtrack.

===2002–2011: &quot;Mixed Race&quot; and other work===

Tricky&#x27;s studio album &quot;Knowle West Boy&quot; was released in the UK and Ireland in July 2008, and September 2008 in the US. The first single from the album was &quot;Council Estate&quot; and features the artist as the sole vocalist: &quot;It&#x27;s the first single I&#x27;ve ever done with just me on vocals. I couldn&#x27;t whisper that song. I had to come out of myself and do a loud, screaming vocal. I wanted to be a proper frontman on that one.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Skinny&quot; in July 2008, Tricky mentioned that &quot;Knowle West Boy&quot; was the first album for which he decided to enlist a co-producer. Ex-Suede guitarist Bernard Butler was Tricky&#x27;s initial selection, but, less than enamoured with Butler&#x27;s technical prowess, Tricky finished the album by totally re-recording all of the material.

On 8 December 2009, Tricky&#x27;s 1995 debut album &quot;Maxinquaye&quot; was reissued with a bonus 13-track CD featuring B-sides, outtakes and seven previously unreleased mixes of songs such as &quot;Overcome&quot;, &quot;Hell is Round the Corner&quot; and &quot;Black Steel&quot;.

In December 2009, the media reported that Massive Attack met Tricky in Paris and asked him to work on a future project—Daddy G said: &quot;Things seem like they&#x27;ve healed between us and Tricky. It&#x27;s been quite well documented how us and Tricky get on, hasn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s not that well, but things have changed. Things have softened up. We saw Tricky a couple of weeks ago in Paris and it was quite an amicable meeting after five or six years.&quot; Tricky agreed to record with the band and he revealed in a June 2013 interview that &quot;there&#x27;s a couple of songs which are OK, which are really good actually to be honest with you&quot;. However, Tricky also stated in June 2013 that he could not spend more than two or three days with Massive Attack and described band member Daddy G as &quot;very arrogant&quot;.

Tricky&#x27;s ninth album &quot;Mixed Race&quot; was released on 27 September 2010 and the first single from the album became available on 23 August. The album includes contributions from Franky Riley, Terry Lynn, Bobby Gillespie, Hamadouche, Blackman and Tricky&#x27;s youngest brother Marlon Thaws.

In June 2011, Tricky&#x27;s then label Brownpunk signed on Mexican band My Black Heart Machine for one single, &quot;It Beats Like This&quot;, which Tricky co-produced. My Black Heart Machine was then commissioned by the label to cover a song from Maxinquaye for an album of covers by Brownpunk&#x27;s roster; the band chose &quot;Hell Is Round the Corner&quot;. &quot;It Beats Like This&quot; was released independently by the band on their first EP in April 2013.

Tricky produced rapper Omni&#x27;s album &quot;IamOmni (produced by Tricky)&quot; (released under the moniker &quot;IamOmni&quot;) that was available from 30 August 2011 as a free download on Omni&#x27;s official site.

===2011–present: &quot;False Idols&quot;, live events, &quot;Ununiform&quot;===
On 26 June 2011, Tricky appeared on stage during American singer Beyoncé&#x27;s historic 2011 Glastonbury Festival Performance on the pyramid stage for the track &quot;Baby Boy&quot;. Partly the result of technical difficulties with his microphone, he later stated he was &quot;mortified&quot; by his own performance, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve never been so embarrassed. My body just froze&quot;.

In April 2012, Tricky performed &quot;Maxinquaye&quot; with Martina Topley-Bird at several concerts around the UK including, for the first time in several years in his home town of Bristol. The concerts featured regular interruptions orchestrated by Tricky, where he brought his youngest brother, Marlon Thaws to rap on stage alongside other local rappers as well as encouraging the audience to come up on stage. The review of the concert in Manchester said it was &quot;shambolic&quot; and a &quot;car crash&quot; with Tricky often leaving the stage and continuously forgetting his words, leaving Topley Bird to carry the delivery of the tracks, resulting in many leaving early after repeated issues with Tricky&#x27;s behaviour and shouts of &quot;wanker&quot; from the crowd.

In February 2013, Tricky announced the release of a new album, &quot;False Idols&quot;. The album is the follow-up from his 2010 &quot;Mixed Race&quot; and featured Peter Silberman, Fifi Rong and Nneka. Tricky released this statement about the album:
::&quot;This new album I&#x27;ll stand behind every track. I don&#x27;t care whether people like it. I&#x27;m doing what I want to do, which is what I did with my first record. That&#x27;s what made me who I was in the beginning. If people don&#x27;t like it, it don&#x27;t matter to me because I&#x27;m back where I was.&quot;

In spring 2014, it was announced that Tricky is to perform at a number of festivals throughout Europe over the summer of 2014, including Control Day Out in Romania, festival Couleur Café in Belgium, Positivus Festival in Latvia and Galtres Parklands Festival in England, the latter of which he co-headlines with contemporaries Morcheeba.

Tricky announced a new album titled &quot;Adrian Thaws&quot; in June 2014. It was released on 8 September 2014. &quot;Skilled Mechanics&quot; was released in January 2016. The same month was released a song Tricky had written with 3D from Massive Attack, on the band&#x27;s EP Ritual Spirit.

His thirteenth official studio album, &quot;ununiform&quot;, was released on 22 September 2017, and featured collaborations with Asia Argento, Avalon Lurks, and Martina Topley-Bird, as well as a cover of Hole&#x27;s &quot;Doll Parts&quot;. Polish singer Marta Złakowska joined Tricky&#x27;s band on a 2017 tour as a guest singer. She stepped in at the last minute when the originally planned singer dropped out.

Blink, an imprint of Bonnier Books UK, has acquired Tricky&#x27;s autobiography. Commissioning Editor Kerri Sharp acquired World rights from K7 Music – the independent music company headquartered in Berlin, where Tricky now lives. The book is currently untitled and will sell as a £20 Hardback in October 2019.

His EP &quot;20,20&quot; was released on 6 March 2020. It featured the song &quot;Lonely Dancer&quot; recorded with the female singer Anika. She had previously worked with Beak in 2010. Tricky&#x27;s next album, &quot;Fall to Pieces,&quot; was released in September 2020. The album featured singers Marta and Oh Land.

In October 2021, Tricky released a new album under the artist name &#x27;Lonely Guest&#x27;. The self-titled album featured collaborations with Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, Idles&#x27; frontman Joe Talbot and Maxïmo Park&#x27;s Paul Smith. It featured songs with previous album vocalists Marta and Oh Land.

==Side projects and film career==
Tricky has guest-starred on a number of albums, including an appearance on Live&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;V&quot;. This appearance came as Tricky and Live&#x27;s lead singer Ed Kowalczyk had developed a close friendship, with Kowalczyk contributing vocals to &quot;Evolution Revolution Love&quot;, a track on Tricky&#x27;s album &quot;Blowback&quot;.

Tricky has also acted in various films. He appeared in a significant supporting role in the 1997 Luc Besson film &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, playing the right-hand man &quot;Right Arm&quot; to evil businessman Mr. Zorg.

He also appears briefly in the 2004 Olivier Assayas film &quot;Clean&quot;, playing himself, and had a large role in the music video for &quot;Parabol/Parabola&quot; by Tool. He was also rumoured to have a brief cameo in John Woo&#x27;s 1997 movie &quot;Face/Off&quot;, but has denied that this was the case, although his single &quot;Christiansands&quot; was featured in the movie. Tricky also appeared as Finn, a musician who loves and then dumps main character Lynn, in the US sitcom, &quot;Girlfriends&quot;.

In 2001, Tricky appeared in online advertising for the web series &quot;We Deliver&quot;, about a cannabis delivery service in New York City. Though he did not appear in any episodes, in the advertising it appears as if he is a customer of the service.

The launch of a record label named Brown Punk was announced in mid-2007 that was a collaboration between Tricky and former Island Records executive Chris Blackwell. At the time, Tricky said: &quot;Brown Punk represents a positive movement where you find intellectuals mixing with the working class, rock mixing with reggae and indie mixing with emo.&quot; The Dirty, The Gospel, Laid Blak Mexican band My Black Heart Machine were acts that were signed to the label, but as of October 2013, the label appears to be inactive.

In March 2023, the album &quot;When It&#x27;s Going Wrong&quot; was released on False Idols. It is a collaboration between Tricky and Marta; a polish singer he has worked with since 2017. In April 2023 The German electro pop duo Berlin Banter released the singel &quot;I&#x27;ll Wait&quot; featuring Tricky.

==Idiosyncrasies and media issues==

By the time &quot;Pre-Millennium Tension&quot; was released in 1996, Tricky was increasingly irritated with the British press, particularly articles written in &quot;The Face&quot; magazine. &quot;The Face&quot; had been an early champion of &quot;Maxinquaye&quot;, but saw Tricky as more a duo than a solo project. &quot;The Face&quot; published an article claiming that vocalist Martina Topley-Bird had to single-handedly bring up the child that Tricky had fathered.

Tricky has also been concerned with racial stereotyping by the media. In the documentary &quot;Naked &amp; Famous&quot;, he stated that photographers wanted him to frown angrily in photos. He points to a cover of &quot;The Big Issue&quot;, where he has a milder look on his face, as being more representative of how he feels. In the song &quot;Tricky Kid&quot; from &quot;Pre-Millennium Tension&quot;, he wrote: &quot;As long as you&#x27;re humble/Let you be the king of jungle&quot;.

Throughout his work, he blurs the normally clear gender definitions found in hip-hop. Despite the heavy influence he drew from American hip-hop in his debut album, &quot;Maxinquaye&quot;, he fights against typical gender representations by, for example, dressing as a woman on the side sleeve of his album cover. As many of his tracks blend elements of varying types of music creating a difficult-to-define sound, so do his lyrics, creating a more ambiguous and blurry take on gender and sexuality.

==Personal life==
Tricky has stated that he has &quot;been through a lot... I&#x27;ve been moved around from family to family, never stayed in one house from when I was born to the age of 16. ...I&#x27;m not normal. It&#x27;s got a lot to do with my upbringing...Staying somewhere for three years then going off for three years. My uncles being villains. All that stuff. I&#x27;ve got quite a dysfunctional family...for some reason, in my family, the mothers always give the kids to the grandmothers&quot;.

Tricky has fourteen paternal siblings.

He was in a brief relationship with Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk in the 1990s. When asked in mid-2013 about the time the pair spent together, Tricky stated: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t good for Björk. I wasn&#x27;t healthy for her. I feel she was really good to me, she gave me a lot of love and she really was a good person to me. I think she cared about me, right?&quot; He was also briefly married to Carmen Ejogo in early 1998 in Las Vegas.

Tricky fathered a daughter, Mina Mazy, on 19 March 1995 with Martina Topley-Bird, a musician he discovered when she was sitting on a wall near his Bristol home. Mina struggled with depression and took her own life on 8 May 2019. Following her death, Tricky stated &quot;It feels like I&#x27;m in a world that doesn&#x27;t exist, knowing nothing will ever be the same again. No words or text can really explain, my soul feels empty.&quot;

In 2015, Tricky moved to live in Berlin, Germany., and later moved to Toulouse, France.

<doc id="30356" wikidata="Q745955" url="?curid=30356" title="Thelema">
<text>Thelema () is a Western esoteric and occult social or spiritual philosophy and a new religious movement founded in the early 1900s by Aleister Crowley (1875–1947), an English writer, mystic, occultist, and ceremonial magician. Central to Thelema is the concept of discovering and following one&#x27;s True Will, a unique purpose that transcends ordinary desires. Crowley&#x27;s system begins with &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, a text he maintained was dictated to him by a non-corporeal entity named Aiwass. This work outlines key principles, including the axiom &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,&quot; emphasizing personal freedom and the pursuit of one&#x27;s true path, guided by love.

The Thelemic cosmology features deities inspired by ancient Egyptian religion. The highest deity is Nuit, the night sky symbolized as a naked woman covered in stars, representing the ultimate source of possibilities. Hadit, the infinitely small point, symbolizes manifestation and motion. Ra-Hoor-Khuit, a form of Horus, represents the Sun and active energies of Thelemic magick. Crowley believed that discovering and following one&#x27;s True Will is the path to self-realization and personal fulfillment, often referred to as the Great Work.

Magick is a central practice in Thelema, involving various physical, mental, and spiritual exercises aimed at uncovering one&#x27;s True Will and enacting change in alignment with it. Practices such as rituals, yoga, and meditation are used to explore consciousness and achieve self-mastery. The Gnostic Mass, a central ritual in Thelema, mirrors traditional religious services but conveys Thelemic principles. Thelemites also observe specific holy days, such as the Equinoxes and the Feast of the Three Days of the Writing of the Book of the Law, commemorating the writing of Thelema&#x27;s foundational text.

Post-Crowley figures like Jack Parsons, Kenneth Grant, James Lees, and Nema Andahadna have further developed Thelema, introducing new ideas, practices, and interpretations. Parsons conducted the Babalon Working to invoke the goddess Babalon, while Grant synthesized various traditions into his Typhonian Order. Lees created the English Qaballa, and Nema Andahadna developed Maat Magick.

==Historical precedents==
The word () is rare in Classical Greek, where it &quot;signifies the appetitive will: desire, sometimes even sexual&quot;, but it is frequent in the Septuagint. Early Christian writings occasionally use the word to refer to the human will, and even the will of the Devil, but it usually refers to the will of God. In his 5th-century sermon, Catholic philosopher and theologian Augustine of Hippo gave a similar instruction: &quot;Love, and what you will, do.&quot; ().

In the Renaissance, a character named &quot;Thelemia&quot; represents will or desire in the &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot; of the Dominican friar and writer Francesco Colonna. The protagonist Poliphilo has two allegorical guides, Logistica (reason) and Thelemia (will or desire). When forced to choose, he chooses fulfillment of his sexual will over logic. Colonna&#x27;s work was a great influence on the Franciscan friar and writer François Rabelais, who in the 16th century used &quot;Thélème&quot;, the French form of the word, as the name of a fictional abbey in his novels, &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;. The only rule of this Abbey was &quot;&quot; (&quot;&quot;, or, &quot;Do what you will&quot;).

In the mid-18th century, Sir Francis Dashwood inscribed the adage on a doorway of his abbey at Medmenham, where it served as the motto of the Hellfire Club. Rabelais&#x27;s Abbey of Thelema has been referred to by later writers Sir Walter Besant and James Rice, in their novel &quot;The Monks of Thelema&quot; (1878), and C. R. Ashbee in his utopian romance &quot;The Building of Thelema&quot; (1910).

=== Definitions ===
==== In Classical Greek ====
In Classical Greek there are two words for will: &quot;thelema&quot; () and &quot;boule&quot; ().

* means &#x27;determination&#x27;, &#x27;purpose&#x27;, &#x27;intention&#x27;, &#x27;counsel&#x27;, or &#x27;project&#x27;
* means &#x27;divine will&#x27;, &#x27;inclination&#x27;, &#x27;desire&#x27;, or &#x27;pleasure&#x27;

&quot; is a rarely used word in Classical Greek. There are very few documents, the earliest being Antiphon the Sophist (5th century BCE). In antiquity it was beside the divine will which a man performs, just as much for the will of sexual desire. The intention of the individual was less understood as an overall, generalized, ontological place wherever it was arranged.

The verb appears very early (Homer, early Attic inscriptions) and has the meanings of &quot;ready&quot;, &quot;decide&quot; and &quot;desire&quot; (Homer, 3, 272, also in the sexual sense).

&quot;Aristotle says in the book &quot;On Plants&quot; that the goal of the human will is perception - unlike the plants that do not have &quot; (translation of the author). &quot;&quot;, says the Aristoteles, &quot;has changed here, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;, and that &quot; is to be neutral, not somehow morally determined, the covetous driving force in man.&quot;

==== In the Old Testament ====
In the Septuagint the term is used for the will of God himself, the pious desire of the God-fearing, and the royal will of a secular ruler. It is thus used only for the representation of high ethical willingness in the faith, the exercise of authority by the authorities, or the non-human will, but not for more profane striving. In the Septuagint, the terms &quot;boule&quot; and &quot;thelema&quot; appear, whereas in the Vulgate text, the terms are translated into the Latin &quot;voluntas&quot; (&quot;will&quot;). Thus, the different meaning of both concepts was lost.

==== In the New Testament ====
In the original Greek version of the New Testament the word &quot;thelema&quot; is used 62 or 64 times, twice in the plural (&quot;thelemata&quot;). Here, God&#x27;s will is always and exclusively designated by the word &quot;thelema&quot; (θέλημα, mostly in the singular), as the theologian Federico Tolli points out by means of the &quot;Theological Dictionary of the New Testament&quot; of 1938 (&quot;Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven&quot;). In the same way the term is used in Paul the Apostle and Ignatius of Antioch. For Tolli it follows that the genuine idea of Thelema does not contradict the teachings of Jesus.

===François Rabelais and the Abbey of Thélème===
François Rabelais was a Franciscan and later a Benedictine monk of the 16th century. Eventually he left the monastery to study medicine, and moved to the French city of Lyon in 1532. There he wrote &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel,&quot; a connected series of books. They tell the story of two giants—a father (Gargantua) and his son (Pantagruel) and their adventures—written in an amusing, extravagant, and satirical vein.

Most critics today agree that Rabelais wrote from a Christian humanist perspective. The Crowley biographer Lawrence Sutin notes this when contrasting the French author&#x27;s beliefs with the Thelema of Aleister Crowley. In the previously mentioned story of Thélème, which critics analyze as referring in part to the suffering of loyal Christian reformists or &quot;evangelicals&quot; within the French Church, the reference to the Greek word θέλημα &quot;declares that the will of God rules in this abbey&quot;. Sutin writes that Rabelais was no precursor of Thelema, with his beliefs containing elements of Stoicism and Christian kindness.

In his first book (ch. 52–57), Rabelais writes of this Abbey of Thélème, built by the giant Gargantua. It is a classical utopia presented in order to critique and assess the state of the society of Rabelais&#x27;s day, as opposed to a modern utopian text that seeks to create the scenario in practice. It is a utopia where people&#x27;s desires are more fulfilled. Satirical, it also epitomises the ideals considered in Rabelais&#x27;s fiction. The inhabitants of the abbey were governed only by their own free will and pleasure, the only rule being &quot;Do What Thou Wilt&quot;. Rabelais believed that men who are free, well born and bred have honour, which intrinsically leads to virtuous actions. When constrained, their noble natures turn instead to remove their servitude, because men desire what they are denied.

Some modern Thelemites consider Crowley&#x27;s work to build upon Rabelais&#x27;s summary of the instinctively honourable nature of the Thelemite. Rabelais has been variously credited with the creation of the philosophy of Thelema, as one of the earliest people to refer to it. The current National Grand Master General of the U.S. Ordo Templi Orientis Grand Lodge has opined that:

Aleister Crowley wrote in &quot;The Antecedents of Thelema&quot; (1926), an incomplete work not published in his day, that Rabelais not only set forth the law of Thelema in a way similar to how Crowley understood it, but predicted and described in code Crowley&#x27;s life and the holy text that he received, &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;. Crowley said the work he had received was deeper, showing in more detail the technique people should practice, and revealing scientific mysteries. He said that Rabelais confines himself to portraying an ideal, rather than addressing questions of political economy and similar subjects, which must be solved in order to realize the Law.

Rabelais is included among the Saints of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica.

===Francis Dashwood and the Hellfire Club===
Sir Francis Dashwood adopted some of the ideas of Rabelais and invoked the same rule in French, when he founded a group called the Monks of Medmenham (better known as the Hellfire Club). An abbey was established at Medmenham, in a property which incorporated the ruins of a Cistercian abbey founded in 1201. The group was known as the Franciscans, not after Saint Francis of Assisi, but after its founder, Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer. John Wilkes, George Dodington and other politicians were members. There is little direct evidence of what Dashwood&#x27;s Hellfire Club practiced or believed. The one direct testimonial comes from John Wilkes, a member who never got into the chapter-room of the inner circle.

Sir Nathaniel Wraxall in his &quot;Historical Memoires&quot; (1815) accused the Monks of performing Satanic rituals, but these reports have been dismissed as hearsay. Daniel Willens argued that the group likely practiced Freemasonry, but also suggests Dashwood may have held secret Roman Catholic sacraments. He asks if Wilkes would have recognized a genuine Catholic Mass, even if he saw it himself and even if the underground version followed its public model precisely.
==Beliefs==

===&quot;The Book of the Law&quot;===

Aleister Crowley&#x27;s system of Thelema begins with &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, which bears the official name &quot;Liber AL vel Legis&quot;. It was written in Cairo, Egypt, during his honeymoon with his new wife Rose Crowley (). A small book, &quot;Liber AL vel Legis&quot;, contains just three chapters, each of which Crowley said he had written in exactly one hour—beginning at noon on April 8, April 9, and April 10, 1904, respectively. Crowley also maintained that the book was dictated to him by a non-corporeal entity named Aiwass, whom he later identified as his Holy Guardian Angel. Crowley stated that &quot;no forger could have prepared so complex a set of numerical and literal puzzles&quot; and that study of the text would dispel all doubts about the method of how the book was obtained.

Besides the reference to Rabelais made in the book, an analysis by Dave Evans found similarities to &quot;The Beloved of Hathor and Shrine of the Golden Hawk&quot;, a play by Florence Farr. Evans says this may have resulted from the fact that &quot;both Farr and Crowley were thoroughly steeped in Golden Dawn imagery and teachings&quot;, and that Crowley probably knew the same materials that inspired some of Farr&#x27;s motifs. Sutin also found similarities between Thelema and the work of W. B. Yeats, attributing this to &quot;shared insight&quot; and perhaps to the older man&#x27;s knowledge of Crowley&#x27;s work.

Crowley wrote several commentaries on &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, the last of which he wrote in 1925. The latter commentary, dubbed &quot;&quot;The Comment&quot;&quot;, warns against discussing the book&#x27;s contents, states that all &quot;questions of the Law are to be decided only by appeal to my writings&quot;, and is signed by Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu i.

===Axioms===
Three statements from &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; distill the practice and ethics of Thelema. Of these statements, one in particular, known as the &quot;Law of Thelema&quot;, forms the central doctrine of Thelema.&quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law&quot;. The first statement is then supplemented by a second, follow-up statement: &quot;Love is the law, love under will.&quot; These two statements are generally believed to be better understood in light of a third statement: &quot;Every man and every woman is a star.&quot;

These three statements have specific meanings:

*&quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law&quot;: Adherents of Thelema should seek out and follow their true path, known as their True Will.
*&quot;Every man and every woman is a star&quot;: This refers to the body of light, which Plato described as being composed of the same substance as the stars. It implies that individuals doing their Wills are like stars in the universe—occupying a time and position in space, yet distinctly individual and having an independent nature largely without undue conflict with other stars.
*&quot;Love is the law, love under will&quot;: The nature of the Law of Thelema is love, which Crowley wrote should be understood in the same sense as the Greek word &quot;agape&quot;. Both &quot;agape&quot; and &quot;thelema&quot; sum to 93 in Hermetic Qabalah. The phrase &quot;love under will&quot; is often abbreviated as &quot;93/93&quot;, suggesting that &quot;love under will&quot; represents something akin to unity.

===Cosmology===

Thelema places its principal gods and goddesses—three altogether—from Ancient Egyptian religion as the speakers presented in &quot;Liber AL vel Legis&quot;.

The highest deity in the theology of Thelema is the goddess Nuit (also spelled &quot;Nuith&quot;). She is envisioned as the night sky arching over the Earth, represented as a nude woman and typically depicted with stars covering her body. Nuit is conceived as the &quot;Great Mother&quot; and the ultimate source of all things, the collection of all possibilities, &quot;Infinite Space, and the Infinite Stars thereof&quot;, and the circumference of an infinite circle or sphere. Nuit is derived from the Egyptian sky goddess Nut and is referred to poetically as &quot;Our Lady of the Stars&quot; and, in &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, as &quot;Queen of Space&quot; and &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot;.

The second principal deity of Thelema is the god Hadit, conceived as the infinitely small point, and the complement and consort of Nuit. Hadit symbolizes manifestation, motion, and time. He is also described in &quot;Liber AL vel Legis&quot; as &quot;the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star.&quot;

Hadit has sometimes been said to represent a &quot;point-event&quot; and all individual point-events within the body of Nuit. Hadit is said, in &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, to be &quot;perfect, being Not.&quot; Additionally, it is written of Nuit in &quot;Liber AL bel Legis&quot; that &quot;men speak not of Thee [Nuit] as One but as None.&quot;

The third deity of Thelemic theology is Ra-Hoor-Khuit, a manifestation of the ancient Egyptian deity Horus. He is symbolized as a throned man with the head of a hawk who carries a wand. He is associated with the Sun and the active energies of Thelemic magick.

Other deities within the pantheon of Thelema are Hoor-paar-kraat (or Harpocrates), the god of silence and inner strength and the twin of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, as well as Babalon, the goddess of all pleasure known as the Virgin Whore, and Therion, the beast upon which Babalon rides who represents the wild animal within humankind and the force of nature.

===True Will===

According to Crowley, every individual has a &quot;True Will&quot;, which is to be distinguished from the ordinary wants and desires of the ego. The True Will is essentially one&#x27;s &quot;calling&quot; or &quot;purpose&quot; in life. &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law&quot; for Crowley refers not to hedonism, fulfilling everyday desires, but to acting in response to that calling. According to Lon Milo DuQuette, a Thelemite is anyone who bases their actions on striving to discover and accomplish their true will, when a person does their True Will, it is like an orbit, their niche in the universal order, and the universe assists them:

For the individual to follow their True Will, the everyday self&#x27;s socially instilled inhibitions may have to be overcome via deconditioning. Crowley believed that to discover the True Will, one had to free the desires of the subconscious mind from the control of the conscious mind, especially the restrictions placed on sexual expression, which he associated with the power of divine creation. He identified the True Will of each individual with the Holy Guardian Angel, a &quot;daimon&quot; unique to each individual. The spiritual quest to find what you are meant to do and do it is also known in Thelema as the Great Work.

===Ethics===
&quot;Liber AL vel Legis&quot; makes some standards of individual conduct clear. The primary of these is &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot;, which is presented as the sum of the law and a right. Some interpreters of Thelema believe that this right includes an obligation to allow others to do their own wills without interference, but &quot;Liber AL vel Legis&quot; makes no clear statement on the matter. Crowley himself wrote that there was no need to detail the ethics of Thelema for everything springs from &quot;Do what thou Wilt&quot;. Crowley wrote several additional documents presenting his personal beliefs regarding individual conduct in light of the Law of Thelema, some of which indeed address the topic interference with the will of others: &quot;Liber OZ&quot;, &quot;Duty&quot;, and &quot;Liber II&quot;.

&quot;Liber OZ&quot; enumerates some of the individual&#x27;s rights implied by the overarching right, &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot;. For every individual, these include the right to &quot;live by one&#x27;s own law&quot;; &quot;live in the way that one wills to do&quot;; &quot;work, play, and rest as one will&quot;; &quot;die when and how one will&quot;; &quot;eat and drink what one will&quot;; &quot;live where one will&quot;; &quot;move about the earth as one will&quot;; &quot;think, speak, write, draw, paint, carve, etch, mould, build, and dress as one will&quot;; &quot;love when, where and with whom one will&quot;; and &quot;kill those who would thwart these rights&quot;.

&quot;Duty&quot; is described as &quot;A note on the chief rules of practical conduct to be observed by those who accept the Law of Thelema.&quot; It is not a numbered &quot;Liber&quot; as the other documents Crowley intended for A∴A∴; instead, it is listed as a document explicitly intended for Ordo Templi Orientis. There are four sections:

*&quot;A. Your Duty to Self:&quot; Describes the self as the center of the universe, with a call to learn about one&#x27;s inner nature. Admonishes the reader to develop every faculty in a balanced way, establish one&#x27;s autonomy, and devote oneself to the service of one&#x27;s own True Will.
*&quot;B. Your Duty to Others:&quot; An admonishment to eliminate the illusion of separateness between oneself and all others, to fight when necessary, to avoid interfering with the Wills of others, to enlighten others when needed, and to worship the divine nature of all other beings.
*&quot;C. Your Duty to Mankind:&quot; States that the Law of Thelema should be the sole basis of conduct and that the laws of the land should aim to secure the greatest liberty for all individuals. Crime is described as being a violation of one&#x27;s True Will.
*&quot;D. Your Duty to All Other Beings and Things:&quot; States that the Law of Thelema should be applied to all problems and used to decide every ethical question. It violates the Law of Thelema to use any animal or object for a purpose for which it is unfit or to ruin things that are useless for their purpose. Man can use natural resources, but this should not be done wantonly, or the breach of the law will be avenged.

In &quot;Liber II: The Message of the Master Therion&quot;, the Law of Thelema is summarized briefly as &quot;Do what thou wilt—then do nothing else.&quot; Crowley describes the pursuit of True Will as not merely detaching from possible results but also involving tireless energy. It is Nirvana but in a dynamic rather than static form. The True Will is described as the individual&#x27;s orbit, and if one seeks to do anything else, one will encounter obstacles, as doing anything other than the Will is a hindrance to it.

==Practice==
The core of Thelemic thought is &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot;. However, beyond this, there exists a wide range of interpretation of Thelema. Modern Thelema is a syncretic philosophy and religion, and many Thelemites try to avoid strongly dogmatic thinking. Crowley emphasized that each individual should follow their own inherent &quot;True Will&quot;, rather than blindly following his teachings, saying he did not wish to found a flock of sheep. Thus, contemporary Thelemites may practice more than one religion, including Wicca, Gnosticism, Satanism, Setianism and Luciferianism. Many adherents of Thelema recognize correlations between Thelemic and other systems of spiritual thought; most borrow freely from the methods and practices of other traditions, including alchemy, astrology, qabalah, tantra, tarot divination and yoga. For example, Nu and Had are thought to correspond with the Tao and Teh of Taoism, Shakti and Shiva of the Hindu Tantras, Shunyata and Bodhicitta of Buddhism, Ain Soph and Kether in the Hermetic Qabalah.

===Magick===
Thelemic magick is a system of physical, mental, and spiritual exercises which practitioners believe are of benefit. Crowley defined magick as &quot;the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will&quot;, and spelled it with a &#x27;k&#x27; to distinguish it from stage magic. He recommended magick as a means for discovering the True Will. Generally, magical practices in Thelema are designed to assist in finding and manifesting the True Will, although some include celebratory aspects as well. Crowley believed that after discovering the True Will, the magician must also remove any elements of himself that stand in the way of its success.

Crowley was a prolific writer, integrating Eastern practices with Western magical practices from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He recommended a number of these practices to his followers, including: basic yoga (asana and pranayama); rituals of his own devising or based on those of the Golden Dawn, such as the lesser ritual of the pentagram, for banishing and invocation; &quot;Liber Samekh&quot;, a ritual for the invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel; eucharistic rituals such as &quot;The Gnostic Mass&quot; and &quot;The Mass of the Phoenix&quot;; and &quot;Liber Resh&quot;, consisting of four daily adorations to the sun. He also discussed sex magick and sexual gnosis in various forms involving masturbation and sexual intercourse between heterosexual and homosexual partners; practices which are among his suggestions for those in the higher degrees of Ordo Templi Orientis.

One goal in the study of Thelema within the magical Order of the A∴A∴ is for the magician to obtain the knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel: conscious communication with their own personal daimon, thus gaining knowledge of their True Will. The chief task for one who has achieved this goes by the name of &quot;crossing the abyss&quot;; completely relinquishing the ego. If the aspirant is unprepared, he will cling to the ego instead, becoming a Black Brother. According to Crowley, the Black Brother slowly disintegrates, while preying on others for his own self-aggrandisement.

Crowley taught skeptical examination of all results obtained through meditation or magick, at least for the student. He tied this to the necessity of keeping a magical record or diary, that attempts to list all conditions of the event. Remarking on the similarity of statements made by spiritually advanced people of their experiences, he said that fifty years from his time they would have a scientific name based on &quot;an understanding of the phenomenon&quot; to replace such terms as &quot;spiritual&quot; or &quot;supernatural&quot;. Crowley stated that his work and that of his followers used &quot;the method of science; the aim of religion&quot;, and that the genuine powers of the magician could in some way be objectively tested. This idea has been taken on by later practitioners of Thelema. They may consider that they are testing hypotheses with each magical experiment. The difficulty lies in the broadness of their definition of success, in which they may see as evidence of success things which a non-magician would not define as such, leading to confirmation bias. Crowley believed he could demonstrate, by his own example, the effectiveness of magick in producing certain subjective experiences that do not ordinarily result from taking hashish, enjoying oneself in Paris, or walking through the Sahara desert. It is not strictly necessary to practice ritual techniques to be a Thelemite, as due to the focus of Thelemic magick on the True Will, Crowley stated &quot;every intentional act is a magickal act.&quot;

===Gnostic Mass===
Crowley wrote &#x27;The Gnostic Mass&#x27; — technically called &quot;Liber XV&quot; or &quot;Book 15&quot; — in 1913 while travelling in Moscow, Russia. The structure is similar to the Mass of the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church, communicating the principles of Thelema. It is the central rite of Ordo Templi Orientis and its ecclesiastical arm, Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica.

===Holidays===

The Book of the Law gives several holy days to be observed by Thelemites. There are no established or dogmatic ways to celebrate these days, so as a result Thelemites will often take to their own devices or celebrate in groups, especially within Ordo Templi Orientis. These holy days are usually observed on the following dates:

* March 20. &quot;The Feast of the Supreme Ritual&quot;, which celebrates the Invocation of Horus, the ritual performed by Crowley on this date in 1904 that inaugurated the New Aeon.
* March 20/March 21. The &quot;Equinox of the Gods&quot;, which is commonly referred to as the &quot;Thelemic New Year&quot; (although some celebrate the New Year on April 8). Although the equinox and the Invocation of Horus often fall on the same day, they are often treated as two different events. This date is the Autumnal equinox in the Southern Hemisphere.
* April 8 through April 10. &quot;The Feast of the Three Days of the Writing of the Book of the Law.&quot; These three days are commemorative of the three days in the year 1904 during which Aleister Crowley wrote &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;. One chapter was written each day, the first being written on April 8, the second on April 9, and the third on April 10. Although there is no official way of celebrating any Thelemic holiday, this particular feast day is usually celebrated by reading the corresponding chapter on each of the three days, usually at noon.
* June 20/June 21. The &quot;Summer solstice&quot; in the Northern Hemisphere and the Winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere.
* August 12. &quot;The Feast of the Prophet and His Bride.&quot; This holiday commemorates the marriage of Aleister Crowley and his first wife Rose Edith Crowley. Rose was a key figure in the writing of &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;.
* September 22/September 23. The &quot;Autumnal equinox&quot; in the Northern Hemisphere and the Vernal Equinox in the Southern Hemisphere.
* December 21/December 22. The &quot;Winter solstice&quot; in the Northern Hemisphere and the Summer Solstice in the Southern Hemisphere.
* &quot;The Feast for Life&quot;, celebrated at the birth of a Thelemite and on birthdays.
* &quot;The Feast for Fire/The Feast for Water&quot;. These feast days are usually taken as being when a child hits puberty and steps unto the path of adulthood. The Feast for Fire is celebrated for a male, and the Feast for Water for a female.
* &quot;The Feast for Death&quot;, celebrated on the death of a Thelemite and on the anniversary of their death. Crowley&#x27;s Death is celebrated on December 1.

===Greetings===

The number 93 is of great significance in Thelema. The central philosophy of Thelema is in two phrases from Liber AL: &quot;do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law&quot; and &quot;love is the law, love under will&quot;. Crowley urged their use in everyday communications, and himself used them to greet people. Today, rather than using the full phrases, Thelemites often use numerological abbreviations to shorten these greeting in informal contexts, a practice Crowley also applied in his informal written correspondences. The two primary terms in these statements are &#x27;will&#x27; and &#x27;love&#x27;, respectively. Using the Greek technique of isopsephy, which applies a numerical value to each letter, the letters of words &quot;thelema&quot; (&#x27;will&#x27;) and &quot;agape&quot; (&#x27;love&#x27;) each sum to 93:

* Thelema: = 9 + 5 + 30 + 8 + 40 + 1 = 93
* Agapé: = 1 + 3 + 1 + 80 + 8 = 93

In this way, the first phrase is abbreviated to &quot;93&quot; while the second is abbreviated to &quot;93 93/93&quot;, with the division &quot;93/93&quot; symbolizing love &quot;under&quot; will.

==Post-Crowley developments==
Aleister Crowley was highly prolific and wrote on the subject of Thelema for over 35 years, and many of his books remain in print. During his time, there were several others who wrote on the subject, including U.S. O.T.O. Grand Master Charles Stansfeld Jones, whose works on Qabalah are still in print, and Major-General J. F. C. Fuller. Subsequent to Crowley, a number of figures have made significant contributions to Thelema. Each has their own following within the broader Thelemic community.

===Jack Parsons===
John Whiteside Parsons (1914–1952) was an American rocket engineer, chemist, and Thelemite occultist. Parsons converted to Thelema, and together with his first wife, Helen Northrup, joined the Agape Lodge, the Californian branch of Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), in 1941. At Crowley&#x27;s bidding, Parsons replaced Wilfred Talbot Smith as its leader in 1942 and ran the Lodge from his mansion on Orange Grove Boulevard.

Parsons identified four obstacles that prevented humans from achieving and performing their True Will, all of which he connected with fear: the fear of incompetence, the fear of the opinion of others, the fear of hurting others, and the fear of insecurity. He insisted that these must be overcome, writing that &quot;The Will must be freed of its fetters. The ruthless examination and destruction of taboos, complexes, frustrations, dislikes, fears and disgusts hostile to the Will is essential to progress.&quot;

The project was based on the ideas of Crowley, and his description of a similar project in his 1917 novel &quot;Moonchild&quot;. The rituals performed drew largely upon rituals and sex magic described by Crowley. Crowley was in correspondence with Parsons during the course of the Babalon Working, and warned Parsons of his potential overreactions to the magic he was performing, while simultaneously deriding Parsons&#x27; work to others.

A brief text entitled &quot;Liber 49&quot;, self-referenced within the text as &quot;The Book of Babalon&quot;, was written by Jack Parsons as a transmission from the goddess or force called &#x27;Babalon&#x27; received by him during the Babalon Working. Parsons wrote that &quot;Liber 49&quot; constituted a fourth chapter of Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Liber AL Vel Legis (The Book of the Law)&quot;, the holy text of Thelema.

===Kenneth Grant===

Kenneth Grant (1924–2011) was an English ceremonial magician and advocate of the Thelemic religion. A poet, novelist, and writer, he founded his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis—later renamed the Typhonian Order—with his wife Steffi Grant.

Grant drew eclectically on a range of sources in devising his teachings. Although based in Thelema, Grant&#x27;s Typhonian tradition has been described as &quot;a &quot;bricolage&quot; of occultism, Neo-Vedanta, Hindu tantra, Western sexual magic, Surrealism, ufology and Lovecraftian gnosis&quot;. Grant promoted what he termed the Typhonian or Draconian tradition of magic, and wrote that Thelema was only a recent manifestation of this wider tradition. In his books, he portrayed the Typhonian tradition as the world&#x27;s oldest spiritual tradition, writing that it had ancient roots in Africa. The religious studies scholar Gordan Djurdjevic noted that Grant&#x27;s historical claims regarding Typhonian history were &quot;at best highly speculative&quot; and lacked any supporting evidence; however he also suggested that Grant may never have intended these claims to be taken literally.

Grant wrote that Indian spiritual traditions like Tantra and Yoga correlate to Western esoteric traditions and that both stem from a core ancient source and have parallels in the perennial philosophy promoted by the Traditionalist School of esotericists. He believed that by mastering magic, one masters this illusory universe, gaining personal liberation and recognising that only the Self really exists. Doing so, according to Grant, leads to the discovery of one&#x27;s True Will, the central focus of Thelema. Grant further wrote that the realm of the Self was known as &#x27;the Mauve Zone&#x27;, and that it could be reached while in a state of deep sleep, where it has the symbolic appearance of a swamp. He also believed that the reality of consciousness, which he deemed the only true reality, was formless and thus presented as a void, although he also taught that it was symbolised by the Hindu goddess Kali and the Thelemic goddess Nuit.

Grant&#x27;s views on sex magic drew heavily on the importance of sexual dimorphism among humans and the subsequent differentiation of gender roles. Grant taught that the true secret of sex magic were bodily secretions, the most important of which was a woman&#x27;s menstrual blood. In this he differed from Crowley, who viewed semen as the most important genital secretion. Grant referred to female sexual secretions as &quot;kalas&quot;, a term adopted from Sanskrit. He thought that because women have kalas, they have oracular and visionary powers. The magical uses of female genital secretions are a recurring theme in Grant&#x27;s writings.

===James Lees===

James Lees (August 22, 1939 - 2015) was an English ceremonial magician known for creating the system he called English Qaballa. In November 1976, Lees explained how he had discovered the &quot;order &amp; value of the English Alphabet.&quot; Follow this, Lees founded the order O∴A∴A∴ in order to assist others in the pursuit of their own spiritual paths. The first public report of the system known as English Qaballa (EQ) was published in 1979 by Ray Sherwin in an editorial in the final issue of his journal, &quot;The New Equinox&quot;. Lees subsequently assumed the role of publisher of &quot;The New Equinox&quot; and, starting in 1981, published additional material about the EQ system over the course of five issues of the journal, extending into 1982.

The &quot;order &amp; value&quot; proposed by James Lees lays the letters out on the grid superimposed on the page of manuscript of &quot;Liber AL&quot; on which this verse (Ch. III, v. 47) appears (sheet 16 of Chapter III). Also appearing on this page are a diagonal line and a circled cross. &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; states that the book should only be printed with Crowley&#x27;s hand-written version included, suggesting that there are mysteries in the &quot;chance shape of the letters and their position to one another&quot; of Crowley&#x27;s handwriting. Whichever top-left to bottom-right diagonal is read the magical order of the letters is obtained.

Little, if any, further material on English Qaballa was published until the appearance of Jake Stratton-Kent&#x27;s book, &quot;The Serpent Tongue: Liber 187&quot;, in 2011. This was followed in 2016 by &quot;The Magickal Language of the Book of the Law: An English Qaballa Primer&quot; by Cath Thompson. An account of the creation, exploration, and continuing research and development of the system up to 2010, by James Lees and members of his group in England, is detailed in her 2018 book, &quot;All This and a Book&quot;.

===Nema Andahadna===
Nema Andahadna (1939–2018) practiced and wrote about magick (magical working, as defined by Aleister Crowley) for over thirty years. In 1974, she said she had channelled a short book called &quot;&quot;.

From her experience with Thelemic magick, she developed her own system of magic called &quot;Maat Magick&quot; which has the aim of transforming the human race. In 1979, she co-founded the Horus-Maat Lodge. The Lodge and her ideas have been featured in the writings of Kenneth Grant.

Her writings have appeared in many publications, including the &quot;Cincinnati Journal of Ceremonial Magick&quot;, &quot;Aeon&quot;, and &quot;Starfire&quot;. According to Donald Michael Kraig:

<doc id="30359" wikidata="Q13712" url="?curid=30359" title="Tiber">
<text>The Tiber ( ; ; ) is the third-longest river in Italy and the longest in Central Italy, rising in the Apennine Mountains in Emilia-Romagna and flowing through Tuscany, Umbria, and Lazio, where it is joined by the River Aniene, to the Tyrrhenian Sea, between Ostia and Fiumicino. It drains a basin estimated at . The river has achieved lasting fame as the main watercourse of the city of Rome, which was founded on its eastern banks.

The river rises at Mount Fumaiolo in Central Italy and flows in a generally southerly direction past Perugia and Rome to meet the sea at Ostia. Known in ancient times as , in reference to the yellowish colour of its water, the Tiber has advanced significantly at its mouth, by about , since Roman times, leaving the ancient port of Ostia Antica inland. However, it does not form a proportional delta, owing to a strong north-flowing sea current close to the shore, due to the steep shelving of the coast, and to slow tectonic subsidence.

==Sources==
The source of the Tiber consists of two springs away from each other on Mount Fumaiolo. These springs are called &quot;Le Vene&quot;. The springs are in a beech forest above sea level. During the 1930s, Benito Mussolini had an antique marble Roman column built at the point where the river rises, inscribed (&quot;Here is born the river / sacred to the destinies of Rome&quot;). An eagle is on the top of the column, part of its fascist symbolism. The first miles of the Tiber run through Valtiberina before entering Umbria.

==Etymology==
The genesis of the name &quot;Tiber&quot; probably was pre-Latin, like the Roman name of Tibur (modern Tivoli), and may be specifically Italic in origin. The same root is found in the Latin &quot;praenomen&quot; &quot;Tiberius&quot;. Also, Etruscan variants of this praenomen are in &quot;Thefarie&quot; (borrowed from Faliscan &quot;*Tiferios&quot;, lit. &#x27;(He) from the Tiber&#x27; &lt; &quot;*Tiferis&quot; &#x27;Tiber&#x27;) and &quot;Teperie&quot; (via the Latin hydronym &quot;Tiber&quot;).

Legendary king Tiberinus, ninth in the king-list of Alba Longa, was said to have drowned in the River Albula, which was afterwards called &quot;Tiberis&quot;. The myth may have explained a memory of an earlier, perhaps pre-Indo-European name for the river, &quot;white&quot; (&quot;alba&quot;) with sediment, or &quot;from the mountains&quot; from pre-Indo-European word &quot;alba, albion&quot; mount, elevated area. &quot;Tiberis/Tifernus&quot; may be a pre-Indo-European substrate word related to Aegean &quot;tifos&quot; &quot;still water&quot;, Greek phytonym &quot;τύφη&quot; a kind of swamp and river bank weed (&quot;Typha angustifolia&quot;), Iberian hydronyms &quot;Tibilis&quot;, &quot;Tebro&quot; and Numidian &quot;Aquae Tibilitanae&quot;. Yet another etymology is from *dubri-, water, considered by Alessio as Sicel, whence the form Θύβρις later Tiberis. This root *dubri- is widespread in Western Europe e.g. Dover, Portus Dubris.

==History==
According to legend, the city of Rome was founded in 753 BC on the banks of the Tiber about from the sea at Ostia. Tiber Island, in the center of the river between Trastevere and the ancient city center, was the site of an important ancient ford and was later bridged. Legend says Rome&#x27;s founders, the twin brothers Romulus and Remus, were abandoned on its waters, where they were rescued by the she-wolf, Lupa.

The river marked the boundary between the lands of the Etruscans to the west, the Sabines to the east and the Latins to the south. Benito Mussolini, born in Romagna, adjusted the boundary between Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna, so that the springs of the Tiber would lie in Romagna.

The Tiber was critically important to Roman trade and commerce, as ships could reach as far as upriver; some evidence indicates that it was used to ship grain from the Val Teverina as long ago as the fifth century BC. It was later used to ship stone, timber, and foodstuffs to Rome.

During the Punic Wars of the third century BC, the harbour at Ostia became a key naval base. It later became Rome&#x27;s most important port, where wheat, olive oil, and wine were imported from Rome&#x27;s colonies around the Mediterranean. Wharves were also built along the riverside in Rome itself, lining the riverbanks around the Campus Martius area. The Romans connected the river with a sewer system (the &quot;Cloaca Maxima&quot;) and with an underground network of tunnels and other channels, to bring its water into the middle of the city.

Wealthy Romans had garden-parks or &quot;horti&quot; on the banks of the river in Rome through the first century BC. These may have been sold and developed about a century later.

The heavy sedimentation of the river made maintaining Ostia difficult, prompting the emperors Claudius and Trajan to establish a new port on the Fiumicino in the first century AD. They built a new road, the &quot;Via Portuensis&quot;, to connect Rome with Fiumicino, leaving the city by Porta Portese (the port gate). Both ports were eventually abandoned due to silting.

Several popes attempted to improve navigation on the Tiber in the 17th and 18th centuries, with extensive dredging continuing into the 19th century. Trade was boosted for a while, but by the 20th century, silting had resulted in the river only being navigable as far as Rome.

The Tiber was once known for its floods — the Campus Martius is a flood plain and would regularly flood to a depth of . There were also numerous major floods; for example, on September 15, 1557 the river flooded to a height of 62 feet above sea level and over 1,000 people died. The river is now confined between high stone embankments, which were begun in 1876. Within the city, the riverbanks are lined by boulevards known as &quot;lungoteveri&quot;, streets &quot;along the Tiber&quot;.

Because the river is identified with Rome, the terms &quot;swimming the Tiber&quot; or &quot;crossing the Tiber&quot; have come to be the shorthand term for converting to Roman Catholicism. A Catholic who converts to Protestantism, in particular Anglicanism, is referred to as &quot;swimming the Thames&quot; or &quot;crossing the Thames&quot;.

In ancient Rome, executed criminals were thrown into the Tiber. People executed at the Gemonian stairs were thrown in the Tiber during the later part of the reign of the emperor Tiberius. This practice continued over the centuries. For example, the corpse of Pope Formosus was thrown into the Tiber after the infamous Cadaver Synod held in 897.

==Bridges==

In addition to the numerous modern bridges over the Tiber in Rome, there remain a few ancient bridges (now mostly pedestrian-only) that have survived in part (e.g., the Ponte Milvio and the Ponte Sant&#x27;Angelo), or in whole (Pons Fabricius).

In addition to bridges, the Metro trains use tunnels.
==Representations==

Following the standard Roman depiction of rivers as powerfully built reclining male gods, the Tiber, also interpreted as a god named Tiberinus, is shown with streams of water flowing from his hair and beard.

<text>Tomb Raider, known as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider from 2001 to 2008, is a media franchise that originated with an action-adventure video game series created by British video game developer Core Design. The franchise is currently owned by CDE Entertainment; it was formerly owned by Eidos Interactive, then by Square Enix Europe after Square Enix&#x27;s acquisition of Eidos in 2009 until Embracer Group purchased the intellectual property alongside Eidos in 2022. The franchise focuses on the fictional British archaeologist Lara Croft, who travels around the world searching for lost artefacts and infiltrating dangerous tombs and ruins. Gameplay generally focuses on exploration, solving puzzles, navigating hostile environments filled with traps, and fighting enemies. Additional media has been developed for the franchise in the form of film adaptations, comics and novels.

Development of the first &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; began in 1994; it was released two years later. Its critical and commercial success prompted Core Design to develop a new game annually for the next four years, which put a strain on staff. The sixth game, &quot;Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness&quot;, faced difficulties during development and was considered a failure at release. This prompted Eidos to switch development duties to Crystal Dynamics, which has been the series&#x27; primary developer since. Other developers have contributed to spin-off titles and ports of mainline entries.

The &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; series had sold over 100 million units worldwide by 2024, while the entire franchise generated close to $1.2 billion in revenue by 2002. The series has received generally positive reviews from critics, and Lara Croft became one of the most recognisable video game characters, winning accolades and earning places on the Walk of Game and &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

==Titles==

The first six &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; games were developed by Core Design, a British video game development company owned by Eidos Interactive. After the sixth game in the series was released to a mixed reception in 2003, development was transferred to American studio Crystal Dynamics, who have handled the main series since. Since 2001, other developers have contributed either to ports of mainline games or with the development of spin-off titles.

===Main series===

==== Original series ====
&quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, the first entry in the series, was released in 1996 for personal computers (PC), PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles. The Saturn and PlayStation versions were released in Japan in 1997. Its sequel, &quot;Tomb Raider II&quot;, launched in 1997, again for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation. A month before release, Eidos finalised a deal with Sony Computer Entertainment to keep the console version of &quot;Tomb Raider II&quot; and future games exclusive to PlayStation until the year 2000. The PlayStation version was released in Japan in 1998. &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot; launched in 1998. As with &quot;Tomb Raider II&quot;, the PlayStation version released in Japan the following year.

The fourth consecutive title in the series, &quot;Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation&quot;, released in 1999. In 2000, with the end of the PlayStation exclusivity deal, the game also released on the Dreamcast. In Japan, both console versions released the following year. &quot;Tomb Raider: Chronicles&quot; released in 2000 on the same platforms as &quot;The Last Revelation&quot;, with the PlayStation version&#x27;s Japanese release as before coming the following year. After a three-year gap, &quot;Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness&quot; was released on Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2 (PS2) in 2003. The PlayStation 2 version was released in Japan that same year.

==== &quot;Legend&quot; trilogy ====
The next entry, &quot;Tomb Raider: Legend&quot;, was released worldwide in 2006 for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation Portable (PSP), GameCube, Game Boy Advance (GBA) and Nintendo DS. The Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable versions were released in Japan the same year. A year later, a remake of the first game titled &quot;Tomb Raider: Anniversary&quot; was released worldwide in 2007 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360 and the Wii. The next entry, &quot;Tomb Raider: Underworld&quot;, was released in 2008 on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 (PS3), PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, Wii and DS. The PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360 and Wii versions were released in Japan in 2009.

In 2011, &quot;The Tomb Raider Trilogy&quot; was released for PlayStation 3 as a compilation release that included &quot;Anniversary&quot; and &quot;Legend&quot; remastered in HD resolution, along with the PlayStation 3 version of &quot;Underworld&quot;. The disc includes avatars for PlayStation Home, a Theme Pack, new Trophies, Developer&#x27;s Diary videos for the three games, and trailers for &quot;Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light&quot; as bonus content.

==== &quot;Survivor&quot; trilogy ====
A reboot of the series, titled &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, was released worldwide in 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Its sequel, &quot;Rise of the Tomb Raider&quot;, was released in 2015 on the Xbox 360 and Xbox One. The game was part of a timed exclusivity deal with Microsoft. Versions for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows were released in 2016. Another sequel, &quot;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&quot;, was released worldwide on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows in 2018. An arcade game based on this incarnation was released by Bandai Namco Amusement in Europe in 2018.

=== Spin-offs ===

==== Game Boy spin-offs ====
Core Design developed two Game Boy Colour titles in the early 2000s. The first, a side-scrolling game simply titled &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; was released in 2000. The second, its sequel, &quot;Tomb Raider: Curse of the Sword&quot;, was released in 2001. A Game Boy Advance title called &quot;Tomb Raider: The Prophecy&quot; was released in 2002. Unlike the first two Game Boy titles, this was developed by Ubi Soft Milan and published by Ubi Soft, adopting an isometric perspective and moving away from the side-scrolling platform-based gameplay.

==== &quot;Lara Croft&quot; spin-offs ====
From 2010 to 2015, a subseries simply titled &quot;Lara Croft&quot; was in development at Crystal Dynamics, with different gameplay than the main series and existing in its own continuity. The first game, &quot;Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light&quot;, was released in 2010 as a downloadable title for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360. It was followed by &quot;Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris&quot;, released for retail and download in 2014 for PC, PS4 and Xbox One. Both titles were released in a compilation entitled &quot;The Lara Croft Collection&quot; for Nintendo Switch in 2023. An entry for mobile devices, an endless runner platformer titled &quot;Lara Croft: Relic Run&quot;, was released in 2015. Square Enix Montreal also released a platform-puzzler for mobile devices, &quot;Lara Croft Go&quot; in 2015.

==== Other spin-offs ====
In 2003, four &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; titles for mobile phones were released. Developed by Emerald City Games for iOS and Android devices, &quot;Tomb Raider Reloaded&quot; is an action arcade and free-to-play game released by CDE Entertainment in 2022. A &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; themed downloadable content expansion for &quot;PowerWash Simulator&quot; was released for free on 31 January 2023.

===Cancelled games===
The plans for the franchise following the release of &quot;Tomb Raider II&quot; in 1997 were heavily revised. Initially, an expansion disk was planned for &quot;II&quot; entitled &quot;The Further Adventures of Lara Croft&quot;, which would have been set in India. Some engineering work was conducted for the PlayStation version to allow for a disk swap after launching the base game. A segment from issue 64 of &quot;GamesMaster&quot; informally referred to the expansion as &quot;Tomb Raider 2.5&quot; and stated that it would have seven levels. A full sequel, then billed as &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot; was planned to have a two-year development period and release on the PlayStation 2. This game would have had a remote island setting and a focus on survival, including a need to find food and water. Core Design developer Gavin Rummery has stated that the island setting would not have resembled the 2013 reboot, but rather have been &quot;self-contained&quot;. Eidos was initially behind the plan but intended to maintain an annual release schedule, and therefore brought in a new team to handle &quot;The Further Adventures of Lara Croft&quot;. Rummery objected on the grounds that splitting &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; out across multiple teams could lead to conflict between the projects, and has stated that it led him to &quot;eventually throw in the towel.&quot; Eidos pursued annual releases with the new team. The India setting from the expansion disk was adopted for &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot;, a sequel for the original PlayStation, and the PlayStation 2 title was dropped. Rummery credits the failure of &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot; in 2003 to burnout of the second team from annual releases, which stemmed from those directional changes in the late 1990s. The details were ultimately revealed by interviews with former staffers conducted for &quot;The Making of Tomb Raider&quot; in 2021.

After the release of &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot; in 2003, Core Design continued working on the franchise for another three years, but both of the projects under development in that period were cancelled. A sequel titled &quot;The Lost Dominion&quot; was undergoing preliminary development that year, but the negative reception of &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot; caused it and a wider trilogy to be scrapped. With Eidos&#x27;s approval, Core Design then began development of an updated edition of the first game for the PSP called &quot;Tomb Raider: 10th Anniversary&quot; in late 2005, with a projected release date of Christmas 2006. Development continued while other Core Design staff were working on the platformer &quot;Free Running&quot;. When Core Design was sold to Rebellion Developments in June 2006, Eidos requested the project&#x27;s cancellation. It was suggested by staff that Eidos did not want to let outside developers handle the franchise. An &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; &quot;reskin&quot; of the game was never completed, and &quot;Free Running&quot; was ultimately the studio&#x27;s final title in 2007. Core Design—by then named Rebellion Derby—shut down in 2010. A January 2006 build of &quot;10th Anniversary&quot; was leaked online in 2020, and remains available on the Internet Archive.

==Common elements==
===Lara Croft===

Lara Croft is the main protagonist and playable character of the video game series. She travels around the world in search of many forgotten artefacts and locations, frequently connected to supernatural powers. While her biography has changed throughout the series, her shared traits are her origins as the only daughter and heir of the aristocratic Croft family. She is portrayed as intelligent, athletic, elegant, fluent in multiple languages, and determined to fulfil her own goals at any cost. She has brown eyes and brown hair worn in a braid or ponytail. The character&#x27;s classic outfit consists of a turquoise singlet, light brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall white socks. Recurring accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and twin pistols. Later games have multiple new outfits for her.

Lara Croft has been voiced by five actresses in the video game series: Shelley Blond, Judith Gibbins, Jonell Elliott, Keeley Hawes, and Camilla Luddington. In other media, Croft was also voiced by Minnie Driver in the animated series and portrayed by Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander in feature films. Multiple models and body doubles have portrayed Croft in promotional material until the reboot in 2013. Eight different real-life models have portrayed her at promotional events.

In January 2023, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Phoebe Waller-Bridge was set to write a TV show adaptation of the video game franchise for Amazon. It was also reported that this would involve a tie-in video game and film in an interconnected universe, likened to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

====Continuity====
The circumstances of her first adventures, along with the drive behind her adventures, differ depending on the continuity. In the original continuities, she is on a plane that crashes in the Himalayas: her journey back to civilization against the odds help to begin her journey towards her adult life as an adventuress and treasure hunter. In the original continuity, after her ordeal in the Himalayas, she left behind her privileged life and made a living writing about her exploits as an adventurer, mercenary, and cat burglar. Shortly after these books she was disowned by her family. In &quot;The Last Revelation&quot;, Lara was caught in a collapsing pyramid at the game&#x27;s end, leaving her fate unknown: this was because the staff, exhausted from four years of non-stop development, wanted to move on from the character. &quot;Chronicles&quot; was told through a series of flashbacks at a wake for Lara, while &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot; was set an unspecified time after &quot;The Last Revelation&quot;, with Lara revealed to have survived. The circumstances of her survival were originally part of the game but were cut due to time constraints and the pushing of the publisher Eidos.

In the &quot;Legend&quot; continuity, her mother Amelia was involved in the crash, and she is partially driven by the need to discover the truth behind her mother&#x27;s disappearance and vindicate her father&#x27;s theories about Amelia&#x27;s disappearance. This obsession with the truth is present in &quot;Anniversary&quot;, and ends up bringing the world to the brink of destruction during the events of &quot;Underworld&quot;. Her father is referred to as Lord Henshingly Croft in the original games and Lord Richard Croft in the &quot;Legend&quot; continuity. The &quot;Lara Croft&quot; subseries take place within their own separate continuity, devoting itself to adventures similar to earlier games while the main series goes in a different stylistic direction.

In the 2013 reboot continuity, Lara&#x27;s mother vanished at an early age, and her father became obsessed with finding the secrets of immortality, eventually resulting in an apparent suicide. Lara distanced herself from her father&#x27;s memory, believing like many others that his obsession had caused him to go mad. After studying at university, Lara gets an opportunity to work on an archaeology program, in the search for the mythic kingdom of Yamatai. The voyage to find the kingdom results in a shipwreck on an island, which is later discovered to be Yamatai, but the island is also home to savage bandits, who were victims of previous wrecks. Lara&#x27;s attempts to find a way off the island lead her to discover that the island itself is stopping them from leaving, which she discovered is linked to the still-living soul of the Sun Queen Himiko. Lara tries to find a way to banish the spirit of the sun queen in order to get home. The aftermath of the events of the game causes Lara to see that her father was right, and that she had needlessly distanced herself from him. She decides to finish his work, and uncover the mysteries of the world. The game&#x27;s sequels portray Lara Croft in conflict with an ancient organization Trinity, in their quest to obtain supernatural items for their world domination.

===Gameplay===

The gameplay of &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; is primarily based around an action-adventure framework, with Lara navigating environments and solving mechanical and environmental puzzles, in addition to fighting enemies and avoiding traps. These puzzles, primarily set within ancient tombs and temples, can extend across multiple rooms and areas within a level. Lara can swim through water, a rarity in games at the time that has continued through the series. According to original software engineer and later studio manager Gavin Rummery, the original set-up of interlinking rooms was inspired by Egyptian multi-roomed tombs, particularly the tomb of Tutankhamun. The feel of the gameplay was intended to evoke that of the 1989 video game &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;. In the original games, Lara utilised a &quot;bulldozer&quot; steering set-up, with two buttons pushing her forward and back and two buttons steering her left and right, and in combat Lara automatically locked onto enemies when they came within range. The camera automatically adjusts depending on Lara&#x27;s action, but defaults to a third-person perspective in most instances. This basic formula remained unchanged through the first series of games. &quot;Angel of Darkness&quot; added stealth elements.

For &quot;Legend&quot;, the control scheme and character movement was redesigned to provide a smooth and fluid experience. One of the key elements present was how buttons for different actions cleanly transitioned into different actions, along with these moves being incorporated into combat to create effects such as stunning or knocking down enemies. Quick-time events were added into certain segments within each level, and many of the puzzles were based around sophisticated in-game physics. &quot;Anniversary&quot;, while going through the same locales of the original game, was rebuilt using the gameplay and environmental puzzles of &quot;Legend&quot;. For &quot;Underworld&quot;, the gameplay was redesigned around a phrase the staff had put to themselves: &quot;What Could Lara Do?&quot;. Using this set-up, they created a greater variety of moves and greater interaction with the environment, along with expanding and improving combat.

The gameplay underwent another major change for the 2013 reboot. Gameplay altered from progression through linear levels to navigating an open world, with hunting for supplies and upgrading equipment and weapons becoming a key part of gameplay, yet tombs were mostly optional, and platforming was less present in comparison to combat. The combat was redesigned to be similar to the &quot;Uncharted&quot; series: the previous reticle-based lock-on mechanics were replaced by a free-roaming aim. &quot;Rise of the Tomb Raider&quot; built on the 2013 reboot&#x27;s foundation, adding dynamic weather systems, reintroducing swimming, and increasing the prevalence of non-optional tombs with more platforming elements.

==History==
===Original series at Core Design (1994–2006)===
The concept for &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; originated in 1994 at Core Design, a British game development studio. One of the people involved in its creation was Toby Gard, who was mostly responsible for creating the character of Lara Croft. Gard originally envisioned the character as a man: company co-founder Jeremy Heath-Smith was worried the character would be seen as derivative of Indiana Jones, so Gard changed the character&#x27;s gender. Her design underwent multiple revisions and redrafts during early development. The game proved an unexpected commercial success, reversing Eidos&#x27; then-bleak financial situation. After the success of &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, work began on a sequel. Gard was no longer given creative control of the character, and it was stated by development staff that he was both saddened and disappointed by the use of Lara Croft&#x27;s sex appeal in marketing. Gard left Core Design in 1997, alongside &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; co-creator Paul Douglas, to found their own gaming company Confounding Factor. 

The remaining team members, alongside new arrivals, would work on the sequel &quot;Tomb Raider II&quot; which released a year after the original game and proved as big a commercial success. The development team were burned out by release due to the extreme crunch policy at Core Design. The vision for the franchise in late 1997 involved an expansion pack for &quot;Tomb Raider II&quot;, entitled &quot;The Further Adventures of Lara Croft&quot;, followed by a survival game called &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot; to be released two or three years later for the PlayStation 2. Eidos were initially behind this direction, but later were driven by a desire to have annual releases for the Christmas window. This led them to request that a second team be created to develop an expanded version of &quot;The Further Adventures&quot; and release that as &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot; in the interim. The decision was not communicated to the original team, which learned of the move only when &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot; was publicly announced as a 1998 title for the original PlayStation. They were exhausted and withdrew from the PlayStation 2 project in response, which was soon cancelled. The &quot;Tomb Raider II&quot; team did not work on the franchise again, with some team members going on to work on &quot;Project Eden&quot;.

Going forwards the franchise would be worked on by a new team. With Eidos&#x27; new vision for the franchise they would aim for annual releases. Core Design&#x27;s policy at the time involved years-long crunch periods, which placed strain on them and ultimately led to similar burnout. For this reason, and the feeling that they had exhausted the series&#x27; potential, the team tried to kill off Lara at the end of the fourth game, &quot;The Last Revelation&quot;. Eidos insisted that the series continue, and so &quot;Chronicles&quot; was developed by the Tomb Raider team while an additional group made preparations for the transition to PlayStation 2 with &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot;. The &quot;Chronicles&quot; team strongly disliked being forced to continue the franchise, with the lead animator enjoying creating new death animations for Lara on that basis. The game was poorly received, with reviewers suggesting the series was growing stale. During this period, multiple handheld titles were developed by both Core Design and third-party developers.

The production of &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot; was beset by problems from an early stage, with the team wanting to create a grander game to compete with contemporary action-adventure games. When the &quot;Chronicles&quot; team came back over to work on &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot;, they found that production had completely &quot;gone off the rails&quot;, with the entire project having been scrapped and restarted once already. Under pressure from Eidos, key sections of the game needed to be cut, and it was released before the team felt it was ready. It also suffered from crunch and burnout. The game received negative reactions from critics, and was cited by Paramount as the reason for the second &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; film underperforming.

While development of the next title &quot;Legend&quot; moved to Crystal Dynamics, Core Design continued to work on the franchise. A remake of the original game for PlayStation Portable was in development there, entitled &quot;10th Anniversary&quot;. While Eidos had been averse to further &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; titles from the group, their recent purchase by SCi meant that the decision would now be made by the new parent company, and they were in favour. By 2006 the title was nearly finished, but after Crystal Dynamics sent a demo to SCi showing the first level of &quot;Legend&quot; running on PSP, &quot;10th Anniversary&quot; was cancelled and Crystal Dynamics were charged with making a remake of the original instead. One of the key reasons for this was the fact that Crystal Dynamics had stronger capabilities to do a cross-platform launch. The decision &quot;went down like a cup of cold sick&quot; at Core Design. The studio attempted to reskin the title as a &quot;National Treasure&quot; or &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; game in the wake of the decision, but these did not come to fruition. The loss of the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; IP was a factor in the studio&#x27;s closure several years later.

===Crystal Dynamics and &quot;Legend&quot; trilogy (2003–2008)===
After the critical backlash against &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot;, Eidos decided to take production of the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; series out of Core Design&#x27;s hands and give it to another subsidiary studio. Production of the next game was given to Crystal Dynamics in 2003, a studio that had made its name with the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; series. Eidos CEO Ian Livingstone stated that while the critical failure of &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot; was a major reason for taking the series away from Core Design, the decision was motivated by their inordinate struggles with developing for the PlayStation 2, and by how many members of the Core team had complained that they were &quot;burnt out&quot; on &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. He added that &quot;for a UK company, moving the development of its prized asset from Derby to California was a big decision to make but, as it turned out, absolutely the right one to make&quot;. One of the main priorities for both Eidos and Crystal Dynamics was to regain the fanbase&#x27;s trust in the brand, along with helping the series reclaim the status and selling power it had before &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot;″ release. Their main goal was to put Lara back inside tombs, with their physics-based engine enabling more intricate puzzles. &quot;Legend&quot; was well received, and was the first game in a rebooted trilogy. After &quot;Legend&quot; was finished, the team decided to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the series by remaking the original game, rebuilding the environments and redesigning the story to fit in with the events and gameplay of &quot;Legend&quot;. Alongside the development of &quot;Anniversary&quot;, an entry for seventh-generation hardware was in development, although it used established gaming architecture from &quot;Legend&quot; and this caused problems for the development team. This released as &quot;Tomb Raider: Underworld&quot; in 2008.

===Square Enix acquisition and &quot;Survivor&quot; trilogy (2009–2019)===
In 2009, the year after the release of &quot;Underworld&quot;, Eidos was bought by Square Enix and later renamed Square Enix Europe, giving Square Enix ownership of the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; franchise. Development of Tomb Raider remained with Crystal Dynamics, now under the new structure. A new subseries began in 2010, billed simply as &quot;Lara Croft&quot; rather than &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; while using the aesthetics of the &quot;Legend&quot; continuity. The first of these was &quot;Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light&quot;, followed by &quot;Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris&quot; in 2014. From 2015 the subseries aimed at the mobile format with &quot;Relic Run&quot;, and later &quot;Lara Croft Go&quot; which received critical acclaim.

During this period, a second development team was working on a second reboot of the series and character, which put emphasis on a darker and grittier interpretation of the character. Another priority was presenting Lara as a more human character, putting her in vulnerable situations, and showing how she begins her journey to becoming a &quot;tomb raider&quot; through both narrative and gameplay. The reboot, simply entitled &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, was met with critical acclaim at launch in 2013, and became the start of the &quot;Survivor Trilogy&quot;. A sequel, eventually revealed as &quot;Rise of the Tomb Raider&quot;, was in development a few months after the reboot&#x27;s release. In response to criticisms about a lack of classic tombs, more optional and story-based tombs were incorporated into the game. It continued the team&#x27;s new portrayal of Lara, showing more sides to her character and her growing obsession with discovering the truth. In 2018, &quot;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&quot; was released to coincide with a new film starring Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft, simply titled &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, taking heavy inspiration from the 2013 game of the same name. &quot;Shadow&quot; was developed by Eidos-Montréal as Crystal Dynamics completed &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&quot;, though Crystal would provide secondary support. The game concluded Lara&#x27;s origin story. A &quot;Definitive Edition&quot;, featuring all 7 DLCs for &quot;Shadow&quot; was released in November 2019.

===Diversification and Embracer Group acquisition (2020–present)===
Following the conclusion of the Survivor trilogy, both Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal were busy with Marvel properties, and so there were no further &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; games for several years. In Crystal Dynamics&#x27; case, continued support for &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&quot; lasted until 2023. While there were no new games in this period, the franchise was active via other avenues. In 2021, Legendary Television and DJ2 Entertainment announced an anime series set after the events of &quot;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&quot; for Netflix. The series&#x27; title was revealed as &quot;Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft&quot; and it was released in October 2024. A great many crossovers with other video game franchises were held in the early 2020s, with an article from &quot;Fandom Wire&quot; identifying 14 franchises that received crossovers, ranging from &quot;Fall Guys&quot; to &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot;. These were generally in the form of cosmetic additions or through Lara appearing as a playable character.

Embracer Group purchased a number of Square Enix Europe assets in May 2022 for , including Crystal Dynamics and the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; franchise. The studio announced the next main &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; title in 2022 as a game that would &quot;unify the timelines&quot;, and combine elements from all three series, including the work of Core Design. In this timeline, Lara would be a seasoned adventurer. This instalment will use Unreal Engine 5, and will be published by Amazon Games. &quot;Tomb Raider Reloaded&quot;, a mobile game, was published by Square Enix London Mobile in 2023. &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; was only briefly under Embracer Group, as the company suffered from over-expansion and announced in 2024 that it was to split into three companies; the IP is to be held by Middle-earth Enterprises after it completes its separation. 

The period also saw a number of re-releases in the form of collected editions and remasters. Feral Interactive&#x27;s Lara Croft spin-offs were re-released as &quot;The Lara Croft Collection&quot; for Nintendo Switch in 2023. Aspyr released remasters of all six Core Design titles across two collections as &quot;Tomb Raider I–III Remastered&quot; and &quot;Tomb Raider IV–VI Remastered&quot; in 2024 and 2025. The remasters were made available for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. The Core Design games were also re-released in their original form for Evercade across two cartridges, with &quot;Tomb Raider Collection 1&quot; covering the first three games, and &quot;Tomb Raider Collection 2&quot; covering the fourth and fifth. The Evercade re-releases did not include &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot;.

==Music==
The original &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; theme was composed by Nathan McCree. He created the original theme music after having discussions with Gard about the character of Lara Croft. Having decided to use Classical English music as an inspiration, he decided to create something simple for the theme song. Its simplicity made rearrangements and orchestrations easy. For his work on the first three &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; games, he was given fairly minimal briefs, and for &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot; he was working on the game as a freelancer as he had left the company. For &quot;The Last Revelation&quot;, Peter Connelly replaced Nathan McCree as the main composer, using McCree&#x27;s music as a basis for his work. He composed the opening theme for &quot;The Last Revelation&quot;, saying that the opening melody came to him out of the blue, and added Egyptian motifs to fit in with the game&#x27;s setting. &quot;Chronicles&quot; was originally going to have a sizeable original opening theme, but due to time constraints the majority of it ended up being discarded, much to Connelly&#x27;s later regret. Only the opening segment survived. The music for &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot;, composed by Connelly and Martin Iveson, was the one element of production that did not encounter problems, as recording was finished before the major content cuts happened. Scored using a full orchestra as opposed to the synthesised instruments of previous titles, it was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra.

For &quot;Legend&quot;, Troels Brun Folmann composed the music and managed the sound effects. Alongside composing a large amount of music for the game, he created micro-scores for small segments within gameplay. Folmann returned to score &quot;Anniversary&quot;, doing re-orchestrations of the original score, along with expanding them. For &quot;Underworld&quot;, Folmann handled the main theme while Colin O&#x27;Malley handled the rest of the soundtrack, which featured far less looping music than &quot;Legend&quot;. The 2013 reboot was scored by Jason Graves, who had become known through his work on the &quot;Dead Space&quot; franchise. Along with his orchestral style, he created a special instrument to create discordant sounds within the music, and musical elements from around the globe to represent the inhabitants of the game&#x27;s island location. For &quot;Rise of the Tomb Raider&quot;, the composer was Bobby Tahouri, who had previously worked as assistant composer on video games and theatrical films. &quot;Guardian of Light&quot; used no original music, instead using extracts from the music of &quot;Legend&quot;, &quot;Anniversary&quot; and &quot;Underworld&quot;. The music for &quot;Temple of Osiris&quot; was written by Will Roget II, who had originally worked on licensed video games including &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;. &quot;Temple of Osiris&quot; was the first title in the &quot;Lara Croft&quot; subseries to have an original score, using Egyptian and Middle Eastern musical elements while creating a new main theme that could be used in future &quot;Lara Croft&quot; games.

==Technology==
Over the lifetime of the franchise, four custom proprietary game engines have been built to support the main titles. &quot;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&quot; (2018) was the final main series title to use a proprietary engine, as the franchise is now moving to Unreal Engine 5. The change reflects a wider industry shift in recent years away from proprietary engines.

===Tomb Raider Engine (1994–2000)===
The first &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; used a custom-built game engine, as other equivalent engines available to Core Design at the time were not versatile enough to realise the team&#x27;s vision. The engine was designed by Paul Douglas, who handled the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence (AI) and the three-dimensional (3D) graphics. The choice of a 3D game was influenced by the team&#x27;s opinion that the game type was under-represented when compared to first-person shooters such as &quot;Doom&quot;. Its 3D style meant multiple elements were difficult to implement, including the AI and camera control. Another noted aspect was the multi-layered levels, as compared to equivalent 3D action-adventure games of the time which were limited to a flat-floor system. Lara&#x27;s movements were hand-animated and coordinated rather than created using motion capture. The reason for this was that the team wanted uniformity in her movement, which was not possible with motion capture technology of the time. For &quot;Tomb Raider II&quot;, minor upgrades were made to the engine, with the main improvements being to the AI and smoothing out Lara&#x27;s model. &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot; underwent major revisions, including rewrites to the graphics engine and improvements in the lighting and AI systems. The engine was given a major overhaul for &quot;The Last Revelation&quot;. The first five games make use of full-motion video cutscenes. For the first three games, they were primarily used as transitional periods depicting Lara moving from one level to another or one location to another. For &quot;Chronicles&quot;, fairly minor revisions were made.

===Angel of Darkness Engine (2000–2003)===
For &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot;, a new engine was built from scratch, but due to being unfamiliar and unused to the technology of the PS2, the team encountered multiple problems such as needing to remove areas and characters due to polygon restrictions. Due to the deadlines imposed, the team were forced to cut corners, meaning that the game reached store shelves in a poor condition.

===Crystal Engine (2003–2008)===
For &quot;Legend&quot;, the staff at Crystal Dynamics created a proprietary engine from the ground up, named the Crystal Engine. The engine and the game&#x27;s content were developed in parallel, leading to scheduling and workload difficulties. &quot;Anniversary&quot; used the same engine as &quot;Legend&quot;. &quot;Underworld&quot; used a new engine built specifically for the game, although its basic codebase was shared with &quot;Legend&quot;. The group of developers who were working on this new engine were not tied specifically to the &quot;Underworld&quot; project, but rather shared by other projects, and this led to issues of prioritisation and communication. There were also problems with complicated dependencies and over-ambition. In &quot;Underworld&quot;, Lara&#x27;s movements were animated using full motion capture, with Olympic gymnast Heidi Moneymaker providing the character&#x27;s animations.

===Foundation Engine (2013–2019)===
For the 2013 reboot, an updated version of the Crystal engine called Foundation was created for the game. Motion capture was again used for this title. An updated version of the Foundation engine was used again for &quot;Rise of the Tomb Raider&quot;. Lara&#x27;s hair movements were made more realistic using a technology called TressFX in &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; and PureHair in &quot;Rise of the Tomb Raider&quot;. The Foundation engine remained in use for the third entry in the reboot series, &quot;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&quot;, and featured new graphical enhancements from developer Eidos-Montréal.

==Cultural impact==

Both the character of Lara Croft and the concepts behind the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; franchise have evolved thematically and in popularity since the first game&#x27;s release in 1996. The success of the game series led to several commercial tie-ins that further catapulted to cultural icon status, including feature spin-off games, feature films, and comics.

==Reception==
Upon release, &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; became an unexpected success, reaching the top of sales charts and remaining for a time. It went on to sell over 7 million units worldwide. &quot;Tomb Raider II&quot; was a greater commercial success, with debut sales higher than the first game and total worldwide sales of 8 million units. Despite varying critical receptions, series sales continued to be strong until the release of &quot;Chronicles&quot;, which sold 1.5 million units. While &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot; met with initial strong sales, it failed to meet expectations. Since the release of &quot;Legend&quot;, the series has picked up in terms of sales, popularity, and critical acclaim. The 2013 reboot sold 11 million units, becoming the most commercially successful &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; title to date. As of 2021, the series has sold over 85 million units worldwide. In addition to the games&#x27; success, the 2001 film adaptation grossed $275 million, making it the highest-grossing video game adaptation until being overtaken in 2010 by &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot;. Additionally, the first &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; comic book issue was the best-selling comic book of 1999 and the 2001 film adaptation had the biggest opening weekend (US$47.7m) for an action film with a female lead since &quot;Aliens&quot; in 1986.

Multiple video game journalists, including &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s Crispin Boyer in 1997 and Eurogamer&#x27;s Martyn Carroll in 2008, have cited the series as a pioneer in the medium, both laying the foundations for and popularising action-adventure and platforming games. Carrol credited the series for bringing video gaming out into the cultural mainstream. In a different article, Eurogamer cited &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot; as a pioneer of mixing different video game genres. The public&#x27;s reactions to the series over the years have conversely had a profound effect upon the series&#x27; direction and identity, as noted in a 2008 review of the series&#x27; history by &quot;Develop&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; was voted one of Britain&#x27;s top 10 designs in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum. The game appeared in a list of British design icons which included Concorde, Mini, World Wide Web, &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, K2 telephone box, London tube map, AEC Routemaster bus, and the Supermarine Spitfire. In 2020, &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail to celebrate classic UK video games.

The character of Lara Croft has similarly enjoyed popularity, standing out during her initial appearance in the male-dominated video game market, and continuing to stand out throughout the series&#x27; history. After her debut in 1996, Lara Croft was featured on the front cover of British culture magazine &quot;The Face&quot;, a position previously held by real-life celebrities. She similarly was featured in Irish rock band U2&#x27;s PopMart Tour. The character was inducted onto the Walk of Game in 2006, and earned multiple mentions in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;: she was recognised as the &quot;most successful human video game heroine&quot; in 2006, and earned six awards in 2010. As part of the latter honours, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; editor Gaz Deaves said that the character &quot;epitomises all that&#x27;s great about video gaming&quot;. In an article for 1UP.com, Jeremy Parish said that Lara&#x27;s sex appeal was the main draw for early fans, a facet Eidos exploited for marketing and attempted to emulate in other products. He cited other writers&#x27; statements that her popularity stemmed from player empathy with her ability to survive tough situations, alongside contrasting against weaker female characters such as Princess Peach. However, alongside this praise, she has divided opinion as to her character design and consequent sexuality: she is both hailed as an empowering figure for women and a negative role model due to her hyper-sexualized and unrealistic appearance.

<text>In chemistry, a transition metal (or transition element) is a chemical element in the d-block of the periodic table (groups 3 to 12), though the elements of group 12 (and less often group 3) are sometimes excluded. The lanthanide and actinide elements (the f-block) are called inner transition metals and are sometimes considered to be transition metals as well.

They are lustrous metals with good electrical and thermal conductivity. Most (with the exception of group 11 and group 12) are hard and strong, and have high melting and boiling temperatures. They form compounds in any of two or more different oxidation states and bind to a variety of ligands to form coordination complexes that are often coloured. They form many useful alloys and are often employed as catalysts in elemental form or in compounds such as coordination complexes and oxides. Most are strongly paramagnetic because of their unpaired d electrons, as are many of their compounds. All of the elements that are ferromagnetic near room temperature are transition metals (iron, cobalt and nickel) or inner transition metals (gadolinium).

English chemist Charles Rugeley Bury (1890–1968) first used the word &quot;transition&quot; in this context in 1921, when he referred to a &quot;transition series of elements&quot; during the change of an inner layer of electrons (for example &quot;n&quot; = 3 in the 4th row of the periodic table) from a stable group of 8 to one of 18, or from 18 to 32. These elements are now known as the d-block.
==Definition and classification==
The 2011 IUPAC &quot;Principles of Chemical Nomenclature&quot; describe a &quot;transition metal&quot; as any element in groups 3 to 12 on the periodic table. This corresponds exactly to the d-block elements, and many scientists use this definition. In actual practice, the f-block lanthanide and actinide series are called &quot;inner transition metals&quot;. The 2005 &quot;Red Book&quot; allows for the group 12 elements to be excluded, but not the 2011 &quot;Principles&quot;.

The IUPAC &quot;Gold Book&quot; defines a transition metal as &quot;an element whose atom has a partially filled d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell&quot;, but this definition is taken from an old edition of the &quot;Red Book&quot; and is no longer present in the current edition.

In the d-block, the atoms of the elements have between zero and ten d electrons.
Published texts and periodic tables show variation regarding the heavier members of group 3. The common placement of lanthanum and actinium in these positions is not supported by physical, chemical, and electronic evidence, which overwhelmingly favour putting lutetium and lawrencium in those places. Some authors prefer to leave the spaces below yttrium blank as a third option, but there is confusion on whether this format implies that group 3 contains only scandium and yttrium, or if it also contains all the lanthanides and actinides; additionally, it creates a 15-element-wide f-block, when quantum mechanics dictates that the f-block should only be 14 elements wide. The form with lutetium and lawrencium in group 3 is supported by a 1988 IUPAC report on physical, chemical, and electronic grounds, and again by a 2021 IUPAC preliminary report as it is the only form that allows simultaneous (1) preservation of the sequence of increasing atomic numbers, (2) a 14-element-wide f-block, and (3) avoidance of the split in the d-block. Argumentation can still be found in the contemporary literature purporting to defend the form with lanthanum and actinium in group 3, but many authors consider it to be logically inconsistent (a particular point of contention being the differing treatment of actinium and thorium, which both can use 5f as a valence orbital but have no 5f occupancy as single atoms); the majority of investigators considering the problem agree with the updated form with lutetium and lawrencium.

The group 12 elements zinc, cadmium, and mercury are sometimes excluded from the transition metals. This is because they have the electronic configuration [ ]d10s2, where the d shell is complete, and they still have a complete d shell in all their known oxidation states. The group 12 elements Zn, Cd and Hg may therefore, under certain criteria, be classed as post-transition metals in this case. However, it is often convenient to include these elements in a discussion of the transition elements. For example, when discussing the crystal field stabilization energy of first-row transition elements, it is convenient to also include the elements calcium and zinc, as both and have a value of zero, against which the value for other transition metal ions may be compared. Another example occurs in the Irving–Williams series of stability constants of complexes. Moreover, Zn, Cd, and Hg can use their d orbitals for bonding even though they are not known in oxidation states that would formally require breaking open the d-subshell, which sets them apart from the p-block elements.

The 2007 (though disputed and so far not reproduced independently) synthesis of mercury(IV) fluoride () has been taken by some to reinforce the view that the group 12 elements should be considered transition metals, but some authors still consider this compound to be exceptional. Copernicium is expected to be able to use its d electrons for chemistry as its 6d subshell is destabilised by strong relativistic effects due to its very high atomic number, and as such is expected to have transition-metal-like behaviour and show higher oxidation states than +2 (which are not definitely known for the lighter group 12 elements). Even in bare dications, Cn2+ is predicted to be 6d87s2, unlike Hg2+ which is 5d106s0.

Although meitnerium, darmstadtium, and roentgenium are within the d-block and are expected to behave as transition metals analogous to their lighter congeners iridium, platinum, and gold, this has not yet been experimentally confirmed. Whether copernicium behaves more like mercury or has properties more similar to those of the noble gas radon is not clear. Relative inertness of Cn would come from the relativistically expanded 7s–7p1/2 energy gap, which is already adumbrated in the 6s–6p1/2 gap for Hg, weakening metallic bonding and causing its well-known low melting and boiling points.

Transition metals with lower or higher group numbers are described as &#x27;earlier&#x27; or &#x27;later&#x27;, respectively. When described in a two-way classification scheme, early transition metals are on the left side of the d-block from group 3 to group 7. Late transition metals are on the right side of the d-block, from group 8 to 11 (or 12, if they are counted as transition metals). In an alternative three-way scheme, groups 3, 4, and 5 are classified as early transition metals, 6, 7, and 8 are classified as middle transition metals, and 9, 10, and 11 (and sometimes group 12) are classified as late transition metals. 

The heavy group 2 elements calcium, strontium, and barium do not have filled d-orbitals as single atoms, but are known to have d-orbital bonding participation in some compounds, and for that reason have been called &quot;honorary&quot; transition metals. The same is likely true of radium.

The f-block elements La–Yb and Ac–No have chemical activity of the (n−1)d shell, but importantly also have chemical activity of the (n−2)f shell that is absent in d-block elements. Hence they are often treated separately as inner transition elements.

==Electronic configuration==

The general electronic configuration of the d-block atoms is [noble gas](&quot;n&quot; − 1)d0–10&quot;n&quot;s0–2&quot;n&quot;p0–1. Here &quot;[noble gas]&quot; is the electronic configuration of the last noble gas preceding the atom in question, and &quot;n&quot; is the highest principal quantum number of an occupied orbital in that atom. For example, Ti (&quot;Z&quot; = 22) is in period 4 so that &quot;n&quot; = 4, the first 18 electrons have the same configuration of Ar at the end of period 3, and the overall configuration is [Ar]3d24s2. The period 6 and 7 transition metals also add core (&quot;n&quot; − 2)f14 electrons, which are omitted from the tables below. The p orbitals are almost never filled in free atoms (the one exception being lawrencium due to relativistic effects that become important at such high &quot;Z&quot;), but they can contribute to the chemical bonding in transition metal compounds.

The Madelung rule predicts that the inner d orbital is filled after the valence-shell s orbital. The typical electronic structure of transition metal atoms is then written as [noble gas]&quot;n&quot;s2(&quot;n&quot; − 1)d&quot;m&quot;. This rule is approximate, but holds for most of the transition metals. Even when it fails for the neutral ground state, it accurately describes a low-lying excited state.

The d subshell is the next-to-last subshell and is denoted as (&quot;n&quot; − 1)d subshell. The number of s electrons in the outermost s subshell is generally one or two except palladium (Pd), with no electron in that s sub shell in its ground state. The s subshell in the valence shell is represented as the &quot;n&quot;s subshell, e.g. 4s. In the periodic table, the transition metals are present in ten groups (3 to 12).

The elements in group 3 have an &quot;n&quot;s2(&quot;n&quot; − 1)d1 configuration, except for lawrencium (Lr): its 7s27p1 configuration exceptionally does not fill the 6d orbitals at all. The first transition series is present in the 4th period, and starts after Ca (&quot;Z&quot; = 20) of group 2 with the configuration [Ar]4s2, or scandium (Sc), the first element of group 3 with atomic number &quot;Z&quot; = 21 and configuration [Ar]4s23d1, depending on the definition used. As we move from left to right, electrons are added to the same d subshell till it is complete. Since the electrons added fill the (&quot;n&quot; − 1)d orbitals, the properties of the d-block elements are quite different from those of s and p block elements in which the filling occurs either in s or in p orbitals of the valence shell.
The electronic configuration of the individual elements present in all the d-block series are given below:



A careful look at the electronic configuration of the elements reveals that there are certain exceptions to the Madelung rule. For Cr as an example the rule predicts the configuration 3d44s2, but the observed atomic spectra show that the real ground state is 3d54s1. To explain such exceptions, it is necessary to consider the effects of increasing nuclear charge on the orbital energies, as well as the electron–electron interactions including both Coulomb repulsion and exchange energy. The exceptions are in any case not very relevant for chemistry because the energy difference between them and the expected configuration is always quite low.

The (&quot;n&quot; − 1)d orbitals that are involved in the transition metals are very significant because they influence such properties as magnetic character, variable oxidation states, formation of coloured compounds etc. The valence s and p orbitals (&quot;n&quot;s and &quot;n&quot;p) have very little contribution in this regard since they hardly change in the moving from left to the right in a transition series.
In transition metals, there are greater horizontal similarities in the properties of the elements in a period in comparison to the periods in which the d orbitals are not involved. This is because in a transition series, the valence shell electronic configuration of the elements do not change. However, there are some group similarities as well.

==Characteristic properties==
There are a number of properties shared by the transition elements that are not found in other elements, which results from the partially filled d shell. These include
* the formation of compounds whose colour is due to d–d electronic transitions
* the formation of compounds in many oxidation states, due to the relatively low energy gap between different possible oxidation states
* the formation of many paramagnetic compounds due to the presence of unpaired d electrons. A few compounds of main-group elements are also paramagnetic (e.g. nitric oxide, oxygen)
Most transition metals can be bound to a variety of ligands, allowing for a wide variety of transition metal complexes.

===Coloured compounds===
Colour in transition-series metal compounds is generally due to electronic transitions of two principal types.
*charge transfer transitions. An electron may jump from a predominantly ligand orbital to a predominantly metal orbital, giving rise to a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) transition. These can most easily occur when the metal is in a high oxidation state. For example, the colour of chromate, dichromate and permanganate ions is due to LMCT transitions. Another example is that mercuric iodide, HgI2, is red because of a LMCT transition.

A metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition will be most likely when the metal is in a low oxidation state and the ligand is easily reduced.

In general charge transfer transitions result in more intense colours than d–d transitions.
*d–d transitions. An electron jumps from one d orbital to another. In complexes of the transition metals the d orbitals do not all have the same energy. The pattern of splitting of the d orbitals can be calculated using crystal field theory. The extent of the splitting depends on the particular metal, its oxidation state and the nature of the ligands. The actual energy levels are shown on Tanabe–Sugano diagrams.

In centrosymmetric complexes, such as octahedral complexes, d–d transitions are forbidden by the Laporte rule and only occur because of vibronic coupling in which a molecular vibration occurs together with a d–d transition. Tetrahedral complexes have somewhat more intense colour because mixing d and p orbitals is possible when there is no centre of symmetry, so transitions are not pure d–d transitions. The molar absorptivity (ε) of bands caused by d–d transitions are relatively low, roughly in the range 5-500 M−1cm−1 (where M = mol dm−3). Some d–d transitions are spin forbidden. An example occurs in octahedral, high-spin complexes of manganese(II),
which has a d5 configuration in which all five electrons have parallel spins; the colour of such complexes is much weaker than in complexes with spin-allowed transitions. Many compounds of manganese(II) appear almost colourless. The spectrum of shows a maximum molar absorptivity of about 0.04 M−1cm−1 in the visible spectrum.

===Oxidation states===
A characteristic of transition metals is that they exhibit two or more oxidation states, usually differing by one. For example, compounds of vanadium are known in all oxidation states between −1, such as , and +5, such as .

Main-group elements in groups 13 to 18 also exhibit multiple oxidation states. The &quot;common&quot; oxidation states of these elements typically differ by two instead of one. For example, compounds of gallium in oxidation states +1 and +3 exist in which there is a single gallium atom. Compounds of Ga(II) would have an unpaired electron and would behave as a free radical and generally be destroyed rapidly, but some stable radicals of Ga(II) are known. Gallium also has a formal oxidation state of +2 in dimeric compounds, such as , which contain a Ga-Ga bond formed from the unpaired electron on each Ga atom. Thus the main difference in oxidation states, between transition elements and other elements is that oxidation states are known in which there is a single atom of the element and one or more unpaired electrons.

The maximum oxidation state in the first row transition metals is equal to the number of valence electrons from titanium (+4) up to manganese (+7), but decreases in the later elements. In the second row, the maximum occurs with ruthenium (+8), and in the third row, the maximum occurs with iridium (+9). In compounds such as and , the elements achieve a stable configuration by covalent bonding.

The lowest oxidation states are exhibited in metal carbonyl complexes such as (oxidation state zero) and (oxidation state −2) in which the 18-electron rule is obeyed. These complexes are also covalent.

Ionic compounds are mostly formed with oxidation states +2 and +3. In aqueous solution, the ions are hydrated by (usually) six water molecules arranged octahedrally.
===Magnetism===

Transition metal compounds are paramagnetic when they have one or more unpaired d electrons. In octahedral complexes with between four and seven d electrons both high spin and low spin states are possible. Tetrahedral transition metal complexes such as are high spin because the crystal field splitting is small so that the energy to be gained by virtue of the electrons being in lower energy orbitals is always less than the energy needed to pair up the spins. Some compounds are diamagnetic. These include octahedral, low-spin, d6 and square-planar d8 complexes. In these cases, crystal field splitting is such that all the electrons are paired up.

Ferromagnetism occurs when individual atoms are paramagnetic and the spin vectors are aligned parallel to each other in a crystalline material. Metallic iron and the alloy alnico are examples of ferromagnetic materials involving transition metals. Antiferromagnetism is another example of a magnetic property arising from a particular alignment of individual spins in the solid state.

===Catalytic properties===
The transition metals and their compounds are known for their homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple oxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in the contact process), finely divided iron (in the Haber process), and nickel (in catalytic hydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface (nanomaterial-based catalysts) involve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms of the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilize 3d and 4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening of the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowered). Also because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states, they become more effective as catalysts.

An interesting type of catalysis occurs when the products of a reaction catalyse the reaction producing more catalyst (autocatalysis). One example is the reaction of oxalic acid with acidified potassium permanganate (or manganate (VII)). Once a little Mn2+ has been produced, it can react with MnO4− forming Mn3+. This then reacts with C2O4− ions forming Mn2+ again.

===Physical properties===
As implied by the name, all transition metals are metals and thus conductors of electricity.

In general, transition metals possess a high density and high melting points and boiling points. These properties are due to metallic bonding by delocalized d electrons, leading to cohesion which increases with the number of shared electrons. However the group 12 metals have much lower melting and boiling points since their full d subshells prevent d–d bonding, which again tends to differentiate them from the accepted transition metals. Mercury has a melting point of and is a liquid at room temperature.
