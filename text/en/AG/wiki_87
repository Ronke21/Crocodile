<text>Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977, as part of the Voyager program to study the outer Solar System and the interstellar space beyond the Sun&#x27;s heliosphere. It was launched 16 days after its twin, &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. It communicates through the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) to receive routine commands and to transmit data to Earth. Real-time distance and velocity data are provided by NASA and JPL. At a distance of from Earth , it is the most distant human-made object from Earth. The probe made flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn&#x27;s largest moon, Titan. NASA had a choice of either doing a Pluto or Titan flyby; exploration of the moon took priority because it was known to have a substantial atmosphere. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; studied the weather, magnetic fields, and rings of the two gas giants and was the first probe to provide detailed images of their moons.

As part of the Voyager program and like its sister craft &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, the spacecraft&#x27;s extended mission is to locate and study the regions and boundaries of the outer heliosphere and to begin exploring the interstellar medium. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; crossed the heliopause and entered interstellar space on August 25, 2012, making it the first spacecraft to do so. Two years later, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; began experiencing a third wave of coronal mass ejections from the Sun that continued to at least December 15, 2014, further confirming that the probe is in interstellar space.

In 2017, the Voyager team successfully fired the spacecraft&#x27;s trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) thrusters for the first time since 1980, enabling the mission to be extended by two to three years. &quot;Voyager 1&quot;″s extended mission is expected to continue to return scientific data until at least 2025, with a maximum lifespan of until 2030. Its radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) may supply enough electric power to return engineering data until 2036.

== Mission background ==
=== History ===

A 1960s proposal for a Grand Tour to study the outer planets led NASA to begin work on a mission during the early 1970s. Information gathered by the &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; spacecraft helped engineers design &quot;Voyager&quot; to better cope with the intense radiation around Jupiter. Still, shortly before launch, strips of kitchen-grade aluminum foil were applied to certain cables to improve radiation shielding.

Initially, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was planned as &quot;Mariner 11&quot; of the Mariner program. Due to budget cuts, the mission was reduced to a flyby of Jupiter and Saturn and renamed the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probes. The name was changed to &quot;Voyager&quot; when the probe designs began to differ substantially from Mariner missions.

=== Spacecraft components ===

&quot;Voyager 1&quot; was built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). It has 16 hydrazine thrusters, three-axis stabilization gyroscopes, and referencing instruments to keep the probe&#x27;s radio antenna pointed toward Earth. Collectively, these instruments are part of the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS), along with redundant units of most instruments and eight backup thrusters. The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects such as planets as it travels through space.

==== Communication system ====
The radio communication system of &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was designed to be used up to and beyond the limits of the Solar System. It has a diameter high-gain Cassegrain antenna to send and receive radio waves via the three Deep Space Network stations on the Earth. The spacecraft normally transmits data to Earth over Deep Space Network Channel 18, using a frequency of either 2.3 GHz or 8.4 GHz, while signals from Earth to Voyager are transmitted at 2.1 GHz.

When &quot;Voyager 1&quot; is unable to communicate with the Earth, its digital tape recorder (DTR) can record about 67 kilobytes of data for later transmission. , signals from &quot;Voyager 1&quot; take more than 22 hours to reach Earth.

==== Power ====
&quot;Voyager 1&quot; has three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom. Each MHW-RTG contains 24 pressed plutonium-238 oxide spheres. The RTGs generated about 470 W of electric power at the time of launch, with the remainder being dissipated as waste heat. The power output of the RTGs declines over time due to the 87.7-year half-life of the fuel and degradation of the thermocouples, but they will continue to support some of its operations until at least 2025.

==== Computers ====
Unlike &quot;Voyager&#x27;s&quot; other instruments, the operation of the cameras for visible light is not autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of the digital computers, the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS). Since the 1990s, most space probes have been equipped with completely autonomous cameras.

The computer command subsystem (CCS) controls the cameras. The CCS contains fixed computer programs, such as command decoding, fault-detection and fault-correction routines, antenna pointing routines, and spacecraft sequencing routines. This computer is an improved version of the one that was used in the 1970s Viking orbiters.

The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) controls the spacecraft orientation (its attitude). It keeps the high-gain antenna pointing towards the Earth, controls attitude changes, and points the scan platform. The custom-built AACS systems on both Voyagers are the same.

=== Timeline of travel ===



=== Launch and trajectory ===
The &quot;Voyager 1&quot; probe was launched on September 5, 1977, from Launch Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, aboard a Titan IIIE launch vehicle. The &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe had been launched two weeks earlier, on August 20, 1977. Despite being launched later, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; reached both Jupiter and Saturn sooner, following a shorter trajectory.

&quot;Voyager 1&quot;″s launch almost failed because Titan&#x27;s LR-91 second stage shut down prematurely, leaving of propellant unburned. Recognizing the deficiency, the Centaur stage&#x27;s on-board computers ordered a burn that was far longer than planned in order to compensate. Centaur extended its own burn and was able to give &quot;Voyager 1&quot; the additional velocity it needed. At cutoff, the Centaur was only 3.4 seconds from propellant exhaustion. If the same failure had occurred during &quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s launch a few weeks earlier, the Centaur would have run out of propellant before the probe reached the correct trajectory. Jupiter was in a more favorable position vis-à-vis Earth during the launch of &quot;Voyager 1&quot; than during the launch of &quot;Voyager 2&quot;.

&quot;Voyager 1&quot; initial orbit had an aphelion of , just a little short of Saturn&#x27;s orbit of . &quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s initial orbit had an aphelion of , well short of Saturn&#x27;s orbit.

=== Flyby of Jupiter ===

&quot;Voyager 1&quot; began photographing Jupiter in January 1979. Its closest approach to Jupiter was on March 5, 1979, at a distance of about from the planet&#x27;s center. Because of the greater photographic resolution allowed by a closer approach, most observations of the moons, rings, magnetic fields, and the radiation belt environment of the Jovian system were made during the 48-hour period that bracketed the closest approach. Voyager 1 finished photographing the Jovian system in April 1979.

The discovery of ongoing volcanic activity on the moon Io was probably the greatest surprise. It was the first time active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the Solar System. It appears that activity on Io affects the entire Jovian system. Io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the Jovian magnetosphere – the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet&#x27;s strong magnetic field. Sulfur, oxygen, and sodium, apparently erupted by Io&#x27;s volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by the impact of high-energy particles, were detected at the outer edge of the magnetosphere of Jupiter.

The two Voyager space probes made a number of important discoveries about Jupiter, its satellites, its radiation belts, and its never-before-seen planetary rings.


=== Flyby of Saturn ===

The gravitational assist trajectories at Jupiter were successfully carried out by both Voyagers, and the two spacecraft went on to visit Saturn and its system of moons and rings. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; encountered Saturn in November 1980, with the closest approach on November 12, 1980, when the space probe came within of Saturn&#x27;s cloud-tops. The space probe&#x27;s cameras detected complex structures in the rings of Saturn, and its remote sensing instruments studied the atmospheres of Saturn and its giant moon Titan.

&quot;Voyager 1&quot; found that about seven percent of the volume of Saturn&#x27;s upper atmosphere is helium (compared with 11 percent of Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere), while almost all the rest is hydrogen. Since Saturn&#x27;s internal helium abundance was expected to be the same as Jupiter&#x27;s and the Sun&#x27;s, the lower abundance of helium in the upper atmosphere may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through Saturn&#x27;s hydrogen; that might explain the excess heat that Saturn radiates over energy it receives from the Sun. Winds blow at high speeds on Saturn. Near the equator, the Voyagers measured winds about . The wind blows mostly in an easterly direction.

The Voyagers found aurora-like ultraviolet emissions of hydrogen at mid-latitudes in the atmosphere, and auroras at polar latitudes (above 65 degrees). The high-level auroral activity may lead to the formation of complex hydrocarbon molecules that are carried toward the equator. The mid-latitude auroras, which occur only in sunlit regions, remain a puzzle, since bombardment by electrons and ions, known to cause auroras on Earth, occurs primarily at high latitudes. Both Voyagers measured the rotation of Saturn (the length of a day) at 10 hours, 39 minutes, 24 seconds.

&quot;Voyager 1&quot;″s mission included a flyby of Titan, Saturn&#x27;s largest moon, which had long been known to have an atmosphere. Images taken by &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; in 1979 had indicated the atmosphere was substantial and complex, further increasing interest. The Titan flyby occurred as the spacecraft entered the system to avoid any possibility of damage closer to Saturn compromising observations, and approached to within , passing behind Titan as seen from Earth and the Sun. Voyager&#x27;s measurement of the atmosphere&#x27;s effect on sunlight and Earth-based measurement of its effect on the probe&#x27;s radio signal were used to determine the atmosphere&#x27;s composition, density, and pressure. Titan&#x27;s mass was also measured by observing its effect on the probe&#x27;s trajectory. The thick haze prevented any visual observation of the surface, but the measurement of the atmosphere&#x27;s composition, temperature, and pressure led to speculation that lakes of liquid hydrocarbons could exist on the surface.

Because observations of Titan were considered vital, the trajectory chosen for &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was designed around the optimum Titan flyby, which took it below the south pole of Saturn and out of the plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission. Had &quot;Voyager 1&quot; failed or been unable to observe Titan, &quot;Voyager 2&quot;&#x27;s trajectory would have been altered to incorporate the Titan flyby, precluding any visit to Uranus and Neptune. The trajectory &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was launched into would not have allowed it to continue on to Uranus and Neptune, but could have been altered to avoid a Titan flyby and travel from Saturn to Pluto, arriving in 1986.


== Exit from the heliosphere ==

On February 14, 1990, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; took the first &quot;family portrait&quot; of the Solar System as seen from outside, which includes the image of planet Earth known as &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot;. Soon afterward, its cameras were deactivated to conserve energy and computer resources for other equipment. The camera software has been removed from the spacecraft, so it would now be complex to get them working again. Earth-side software and computers for reading the images are also no longer available.

On February 17, 1998, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; reached a distance of from the Sun and overtook &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; as the most distant spacecraft from Earth. Traveling at about , it has the fastest heliocentric recession speed of any spacecraft.

As &quot;Voyager 1&quot; headed for interstellar space, its instruments continued to study the Solar System. Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists used the plasma wave experiments aboard &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; to look for the heliopause, the boundary at which the solar wind transitions into the interstellar medium. , the probe was moving with a relative velocity to the Sun of about .
With the velocity the probe is currently maintaining, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; is traveling about per year, or about one light-year per 18,000 years.

=== Termination shock ===
Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory believe that &quot;Voyager 1&quot; entered the termination shock in February 2003. This marks the point where the solar wind slows to subsonic speeds. Some other scientists expressed doubt and discussed this in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; of November 6, 2003. The issue would not be resolved until other data became available, since &quot;Voyager 1&quot; solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990. This failure meant that termination shock detection would have to be inferred from the data from the other instruments on board.

In May 2005, a NASA press release said that the consensus was that &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was then in the heliosheath. In a scientific session at the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans on May 25, 2005, Ed Stone presented evidence that the craft crossed the termination shock in late 2004. This event is estimated to have occurred on December 15, 2004, at a distance of from the Sun.

=== Heliosheath ===

On March 31, 2006, amateur radio operators from AMSAT in Germany tracked and received radio waves from &quot;Voyager 1&quot; using the dish at Bochum with a long integration technique. Retrieved data was checked and verified against data from the Deep Space Network station at Madrid, Spain. This seems to be the first such amateur tracking of &quot;Voyager 1&quot;.

It was confirmed on December 13, 2010, that &quot;Voyager 1&quot; had passed the reach of the radial outward flow of the solar wind, as measured by the Low Energy Charged Particle device. It is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere. Since June 2010, detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero, providing conclusive evidence of the event. On this date, the spacecraft was approximately from the Sun.

&quot;Voyager 1&quot; was commanded to change its orientation to measure the sideways motion of the solar wind at that location in space in March 2011 (~33yr 6mo from launch). A test roll done in February had confirmed the spacecraft&#x27;s ability to maneuver and reorient itself. The course of the spacecraft was not changed. It rotated 70 degrees counterclockwise with respect to Earth to detect the solar wind. This was the first time the spacecraft had done any major maneuvering since the &quot;Family Portrait&quot; photograph of the planets was taken in 1990. After the first roll the spacecraft had no problem in reorienting itself with Alpha Centauri, &quot;Voyager 1&quot;&#x27;s guide star, and it resumed sending transmissions back to Earth. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was expected to enter interstellar space &quot;at any time&quot;. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; was still detecting outward flow of solar wind at that point but it was estimated that in the following months or years it would experience the same conditions as &quot;Voyager 1&quot;.

The spacecraft was reported at 12.44° declination and 17.163 hours right ascension, and at an ecliptic latitude of 34.9° (the ecliptic latitude changes very slowly), placing it in the constellation Ophiuchus as observed from the Earth on May 21, 2011.

On December 1, 2011, it was announced that &quot;Voyager 1&quot; had detected the first Lyman-alpha radiation originating from the Milky Way galaxy. Lyman-alpha radiation had previously been detected from other galaxies, but because of interference from the Sun, the radiation from the Milky Way was not detectable.

NASA announced on December 5, 2011, that &quot;Voyager 1&quot; had entered a new region referred to as a &quot;cosmic purgatory&quot;. Within this stagnation region, charged particles streaming from the Sun slow and turn inward, and the Solar System&#x27;s magnetic field is doubled in strength as interstellar space appears to be applying pressure. Energetic particles originating in the Solar System decline by nearly half, while the detection of high-energy electrons from outside increases 100-fold. The inner edge of the stagnation region is located approximately 113 AU from the Sun.

=== Heliopause ===
NASA announced in June 2012 that the probe was detecting changes in the environment that were suspected to correlate with arrival at the heliopause. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; had reported a marked increase in its detection of charged particles from interstellar space, which are normally deflected by the solar winds within the heliosphere from the Sun. The craft thus began to enter the interstellar medium at the edge of the Solar System.

&quot;Voyager 1&quot; became the first spacecraft to cross the heliopause in August 2012, then at a distance of from the Sun, although this was not confirmed for another year.

As of September 2012, sunlight took 16.89 hours to get to &quot;Voyager 1&quot; which was at a distance of 121 AU. The apparent magnitude of the Sun from the spacecraft was −16.3 (about 30 times brighter than the full Moon). The spacecraft was traveling at relative to the Sun. At this rate, it would need about 17,565 years at this speed to travel a single light-year. To compare, Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Sun, is about 4.2 light-years () distant. If the spacecraft was traveling in the direction of that star, it would take 73,775 years to reach it. (&quot;Voyager 1&quot; is heading in the direction of the constellation Ophiuchus.)

In late 2012, researchers reported that particle data from the spacecraft suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause. Measurements from the spacecraft revealed a steady rise since May in collisions with high energy particles (above 70 MeV), which are thought to be cosmic rays emanating from supernova explosions far beyond the Solar System, with a sharp increase in these collisions in late August. At the same time, in late August, there was a dramatic drop in collisions with low-energy particles, which are thought to originate from the Sun.

Ed Roelof, space scientist at Johns Hopkins University and principal investigator for the Low-Energy Charged Particle instrument on the spacecraft, declared that &quot;most scientists involved with &quot;Voyager 1&quot; would agree that [these two criteria] have been sufficiently satisfied&quot;. However, the last criterion for officially declaring that &quot;Voyager 1&quot; had crossed the boundary, the expected change in magnetic field direction (from that of the Sun to that of the interstellar field beyond), had not been observed (the field had changed direction by only 2 degrees), which suggested to some that the nature of the edge of the heliosphere had been misjudged.

On December 3, 2012, Voyager project scientist Ed Stone of the California Institute of Technology said, &quot;Voyager has discovered a new region of the heliosphere that we had not realized was there. We&#x27;re still inside, apparently. But the magnetic field now is connected to the outside. So it&#x27;s like a highway letting particles in and out.&quot; The magnetic field in this region was 10 times more intense than &quot;Voyager 1&quot; encountered before the termination shock. It was expected to be the last barrier before the spacecraft exited the Solar System completely and entered interstellar space.

== Interstellar medium ==
In March 2013, it was announced that &quot;Voyager 1&quot; might have become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space, having detected a marked change in the plasma environment on August 25, 2012. However, until September 12, 2013, it was still an open question as to whether the new region was interstellar space or an unknown region of the Solar System. At that time, the former alternative was officially confirmed.

In 2013 &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was exiting the Solar System at a speed of about per year, which is 61,602 km/h, 4.83 times the diameter of Earth (12,742 km) per hour; whereas &quot;Voyager 2&quot; is going slower, leaving the Solar System at per year. Each year, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; increases its lead over &quot;Voyager 2&quot;.

&quot;Voyager 1&quot; reached a distance of from the Sun on May 18, 2016. On September 5, 2017, that had increased to about from the Sun, or just over 19 light-hours; at that time, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; was from the Sun.

Its progress can be monitored at NASA&#x27;s website.


On September 12, 2013, NASA officially confirmed that &quot;Voyager 1&quot; had reached the interstellar medium in August 2012 as previously observed. The generally accepted date of arrival is August 25, 2012 (approximately 10 days before the 35th anniversary of its launch), the date durable changes in the density of energetic particles were first detected. By this point, most space scientists had abandoned the hypothesis that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany a crossing of the heliopause; a new model of the heliopause predicted that no such change would be found.

A key finding that persuaded many scientists that the heliopause had been crossed was an indirect measurement of an 80-fold increase in electron density, based on the frequency of plasma oscillations observed beginning on April 9, 2013, triggered by a solar outburst that had occurred in March 2012 (electron density is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher outside the heliopause than within). Weaker sets of oscillations measured in October and November 2012 provided additional data. An indirect measurement was required because &quot;Voyager 1&quot;&#x27;s plasma spectrometer had stopped working in 1980. In September 2013, NASA released recordings of audio transductions of these plasma waves, the first to be measured in interstellar space.

While &quot;Voyager 1&quot; is commonly spoken of as having left the Solar System simultaneously with having left the heliosphere, the two are not the same. The Solar System is usually defined as the vastly larger region of space populated by bodies that orbit the Sun. The craft is presently less than one-seventh the distance to the aphelion of Sedna, and it has not yet entered the Oort cloud, the source region of long-period comets, regarded by astronomers as the outermost zone of the Solar System.

In October 2020, astronomers reported a significant unexpected increase in density in the space beyond the Solar System as detected by the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; space probes. According to the researchers, this implies that &quot;the density gradient is a large-scale feature of the VLISM (very local interstellar medium) in the general direction of the heliospheric nose&quot;.

In May 2021, NASA reported on the continuous measurement, for the first time, of the density of material in interstellar space and, as well, the detection of interstellar sounds for the first time.

== Communication issues ==
In May 2022, NASA reported that &quot;Voyager 1&quot; had begun transmitting &quot;mysterious&quot; and &quot;peculiar&quot; telemetric data to the Deep Space Network (DSN). It confirmed that the operational status of the craft remained unchanged, but that the issue stemmed from the Attitude Articulation and Control System (AACS). NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory published a statement on May 18, 2022, that the AACS was functional but sending invalid data. The problem was eventually traced to the AACS sending its telemetry through a computer that had been non-operational for years, resulting in data corruption. In August 2022, NASA transmitted a command to the AACS to use another computer, which resolved the problem. An investigation into what caused the initial switch is underway, though engineers have hypothesized that the AACS had executed a bad command from another onboard computer.

&quot;Voyager 1&quot; began transmitting unreadable data on November 14, 2023. On December 12, 2023, NASA announced that &quot;Voyager 1&quot; flight data system was unable to use its telemetry modulation unit, preventing it from transmitting scientific data. On March 24, 2024, NASA announced that they had made significant progress on interpreting the data being received from the spacecraft. Engineers reported in April 2024 that the failure was likely in a memory bank of the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS), one of the three onboard computer systems, probably from being struck by a high-energy particle or that it simply wore out due to age. The FDS was not communicating properly with the telemetry modulation unit (TMU), which began transmitting a repeating sequence of ones and zeros indicating that the system was in a stuck condition. After a reboot of the FDS, communications remained unusable. The probe still received commands from Earth, and was sending a carrier tone indicating it was still operational. Commands sent to alter the modulation of the tone succeeded, confirming that the probe was still responsive. The &quot;Voyager&quot; team began developing a workaround, and on April 20 communication of health and status was restored by rearranging code away from the defective FDS memory chip, three percent of which was corrupted beyond repair. Because the memory is corrupted, the code needed to be relocated, but there were no place for an extra 256 bits; the spacecraft&#x27;s total memory is only 69.63 kilobytes. To make it work, the engineers deleted unused code, for example the code used to transmit the data from Jupiter, that cannot be used at the current transmission rate. All the data from the &quot;anomaly period&quot; is lost. On May 22, NASA announced that Voyager 1 &quot;resumed returning science data from two of its four instruments&quot;, with work towards the others ongoing. On June 13, NASA confirmed that the probe returns data from all four instruments.

In October 2024, the probe turned off its X-band radio transmitter that was used for communications with the DSN. It was caused by the probe&#x27;s fault protection system that was activated after NASA turned on one of the heaters on October 16. Fault protection system lowered the transmission rate, but the engineers were able to find the signal. Later, on October 19, the transmission stopped; the fault protection system was triggered once again and switched to the S-band transmitter, that was previously used in 1981. NASA reported that the team reactivated the X-band transmitter and then resumed collecting data in mid-November.

== Future of the probe ==
=== Remaining lifespan ===
In December 2017, NASA successfully fired all four of &quot;Voyager 1&quot;″s trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) thrusters for the first time since 1980. The TCM thrusters were used in the place of a degraded set of jets to help keep the probe&#x27;s antenna pointed towards Earth. Using the TCM thrusters allowed &quot;Voyager 1&quot; to continue transmitting data to NASA for two to three more years.

Due to the diminishing electrical power available, the Voyager team has had to prioritize which instruments to keep on and which to turn off. Heaters and other spacecraft systems have been turned off one by one as part of power management. The fields and particles instruments that are the most likely to send back key data about the heliosphere and interstellar space have been prioritized to keep operating. Engineers expect the spacecraft to continue operating at least one science instrument until around 2025.

=== Concerns with the orientation thrusters ===
Some thrusters needed to control the attitude of the spacecraft and point its high-gain antenna in the direction of Earth are out of use due to clogging problems in their hydrazine lines. The spacecraft no longer has a backup available for its thruster system and &quot;everything onboard is single-string,&quot; according to Suzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager at JPL, in an interview with &quot;Ars Technica&quot;. NASA has accordingly decided to modify the spacecraft&#x27;s computer software in order to reduce the rate at which the hydrazine lines clog. NASA will first deploy the modified software on &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, which is less distant from Earth, before deploying it on &quot;Voyager 1&quot;.

In September 2024, NASA performed a &quot;thruster swap&quot;, switching from a clogged set of thrusters to less clogged ones that had not been used since 2018.

=== Far future ===
Provided &quot;Voyager 1&quot; does not collide with anything and is not retrieved, the &quot;New Horizons&quot; space probe will never pass it, despite being launched from Earth at a higher speed than either Voyager spacecraft. The Voyager spacecraft benefited from multiple planetary flybys to increase its heliocentric velocities, whereas &quot;New Horizons&quot; received only a single such boost, from its Jupiter flyby in 2007. , &quot;New Horizons&quot; is traveling at about , slower than &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, and New Horizons, being closer to the sun, is slowing more rapidly.

&quot;Voyager 1&quot; is expected to reach the theorized Oort cloud in about 300 years and take about 30,000 years to pass through it. Though it is not heading towards any particular star, in about 40,000 years, it will pass within of the star Gliese 445, which is at present in the constellation Camelopardalis and 17.1 light-years from Earth. That star is generally moving towards the Solar System at about . NASA says that &quot;The Voyagers are destinedperhaps eternallyto wander the Milky Way.&quot; In 300,000 years, it will pass within less than 1 light-year of the M3V star TYC 3135–52–1.

== Golden record ==

Both Voyager space probes carry a gold-plated audio-visual disc, a compilation meant to showcase the diversity of life and culture on Earth in the event that either spacecraft is ever found by any extraterrestrial discoverer. The record, made under the direction of a team including Carl Sagan and Timothy Ferris, includes photos of the Earth and its lifeforms, a range of scientific information, spoken greetings from people such as the Secretary-General of the United Nations (Kurt Waldheim) and the President of the United States (Jimmy Carter) and a medley, &quot;Sounds of Earth&quot;, that includes the sounds of whales, a baby crying, waves breaking on a shore, and a collection of music spanning different cultures and eras including works by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Blind Willie Johnson, Chuck Berry and Valya Balkanska. Other Eastern and Western classics are included, as well as performances of indigenous and folk music from around the world. The record also contains greetings in 55 different languages. The project aimed to portray the richness of life on Earth and stand as a testament to human creativity and the desire to connect with the cosmos.

<text>Voyager 2 is a space probe launched by NASA on August 20, 1977, as a part of the Voyager program. It was launched on a trajectory towards the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) and enabled further encounters with the ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The only spacecraft to have visited either of the ice giant planets, it was the third of five spacecraft to achieve Solar escape velocity, which allowed it to leave the Solar System. Launched 16 days before its twin &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, the primary mission of the spacecraft was to study the outer planets and its extended mission is to study interstellar space beyond the Sun&#x27;s heliosphere.

&quot;Voyager 2&quot; successfully fulfilled its primary mission of visiting the Jovian system in 1979, the Saturnian system in 1981, Uranian system in 1986, and the Neptunian system in 1989. The spacecraft is in its extended mission of studying the interstellar medium. It is at a distance of from Earth .

The probe entered the interstellar medium on November 5, 2018, at a distance of from the Sun and moving at a velocity of relative to the Sun. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; has left the Sun&#x27;s heliosphere and is traveling through the interstellar medium, though still inside the Solar System, joining &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, which had reached the interstellar medium in 2012. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; has begun to provide the first direct measurements of the density and temperature of the interstellar plasma.

&quot;Voyager 2&quot; is in contact with Earth through the NASA Deep Space Network. Communications are the responsibility of Australia&#x27;s DSS 43 communication antenna, near Canberra.

== History ==
=== Background ===

In the early space age, it was realized that a periodic alignment of the outer planets would occur in the late 1970s and enable a single probe to visit Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune by taking advantage of the then-new technique of gravity assists. NASA began work on a Grand Tour, which evolved into a massive project involving two groups of two probes each, with one group visiting Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto and the other Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. The spacecraft would be designed with redundant systems to ensure survival throughout the entire tour. By 1972 the mission was scaled back and replaced with two Mariner program-derived spacecraft, the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probes. To keep apparent lifetime program costs low, the mission would include only flybys of Jupiter and Saturn, but keep the Grand Tour option open. As the program progressed, the name was changed to Voyager.

The primary mission of &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was to explore Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn&#x27;s largest moon, Titan. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; was also to explore Jupiter and Saturn, but on a trajectory that would have the option of continuing on to Uranus and Neptune, or being redirected to Titan as a backup for &quot;Voyager 1&quot;. Upon successful completion of &quot;Voyager 1&quot;&#x27;s objectives, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; would get a mission extension to send the probe on towards Uranus and Neptune.
Titan was selected due to the interest developed after the images taken by &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; in 1979, which had indicated the atmosphere of the moon was substantial and complex. Hence the trajectory was designed for optimum Titan flyby.

=== Spacecraft design ===
Constructed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), &quot;Voyager 2&quot; included 16 hydrazine thrusters, three-axis stabilization, gyroscopes and celestial referencing instruments (Sun sensor/Canopus Star Tracker) to maintain pointing of the high-gain antenna toward Earth. Collectively these instruments are part of the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters. The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects as it traveled through space.

==== Communications ====
Built with the intent for eventual interstellar travel, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; included a large, parabolic, high-gain antenna (see diagram) to transceive data via the Deep Space Network on Earth. Communications are conducted over the S-band (about 13 cm wavelength) and X-band (about 3.6 cm wavelength) providing data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second at the distance of Jupiter, and then ever-decreasing as distance increases, because of the inverse-square law. When the spacecraft is unable to communicate with Earth, the Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) can record about 64 megabytes of data for transmission at another time.

==== Power ====

&quot;Voyager 2&quot; is equipped with three multihundred-watt radioisotope thermoelectric generators (MHW RTGs). Each RTG includes 24 pressed plutonium oxide spheres. At launch, each RTG provided enough heat to generate approximately 157 W of electrical power. Collectively, the RTGs supplied the spacecraft with 470 watts at launch (halving every 87.7 years). They were predicted to allow operations to continue until at least 2020, and continued to provide power to five scientific instruments through the early part of 2023. In April 2023 JPL began using a reservoir of backup power intended for an onboard safety mechanism. As a result, all five instruments had been expected to continue operation through 2026. In October 2024 NASA announced that the plasma science instrument had been turned off, preserving power for the remaining four instruments.

==== Attitude control and propulsion ====
Because of the energy required to achieve a Jupiter trajectory boost with an payload, the spacecraft included a propulsion module made of a solid-rocket motor and eight hydrazine monopropellant rocket engines, four providing pitch and yaw attitude control, and four for roll control. The propulsion module was jettisoned shortly after the successful Jupiter burn.

Sixteen hydrazine Aerojet MR-103 thrusters on the mission module provide attitude control. Four are used to execute trajectory correction maneuvers; the others in two redundant six-thruster branches, to stabilize the spacecraft on its three axes. Only one branch of attitude control thrusters is needed at any time.

Thrusters are supplied by a single diameter spherical titanium tank. It contained of hydrazine at launch, providing enough fuel until 2034.

=== Launch and trajectory ===
The &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe was launched on August 20, 1977, by NASA from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a Titan IIIE/Centaur launch vehicle. Two weeks later, the twin &quot;Voyager 1&quot; probe was launched on September 5, 1977. However, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; reached both Jupiter and Saturn sooner, as &quot;Voyager 2&quot; had been launched into a longer, more circular trajectory.

&quot;Voyager 1&quot;″s initial orbit had an aphelion of , just a little short of Saturn&#x27;s orbit of . Whereas, &quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s initial orbit had an aphelion of , well short of Saturn&#x27;s orbit.

In April 1978, no commands were transmitted to &quot;Voyager 2&quot; for a period of time, causing the spacecraft to switch from its primary radio receiver to its backup receiver. Sometime afterwards, the primary receiver failed altogether. The backup receiver was functional, but a failed capacitor in the receiver meant that it could only receive transmissions that were sent at a precise frequency, and this frequency would be affected by the Earth&#x27;s rotation (due to the Doppler effect) and the onboard receiver&#x27;s temperature, among other things.

&quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s closest approach to Jupiter occurred at 22:29 UT on July 9, 1979. It came within of the planet&#x27;s cloud tops.
Jupiter&#x27;s Great Red Spot was revealed as a complex storm moving in a counterclockwise direction. Other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds.

&quot;Voyager 2&quot; returned images of Jupiter, as well as its moons Amalthea, Io, Callisto, Ganymede, and Europa. During a 10-hour &quot;volcano watch&quot;, it confirmed &quot;Voyager 1&quot;″s observations of active volcanism on the moon Io, and revealed how the moon&#x27;s surface had changed in the four months since the previous visit. Together, the Voyagers observed the eruption of nine volcanoes on Io, and there is evidence that other eruptions occurred between the two Voyager fly-bys.

Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa displayed a large number of intersecting linear features in the low-resolution photos from &quot;Voyager 1&quot;. At first, scientists believed the features might be deep cracks, caused by crustal rifting or tectonic processes. Closer high-resolution photos from &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, however, were puzzling: the features lacked topographic relief, and one scientist said they &quot;might have been painted on with a felt marker&quot;. Europa is internally active due to tidal heating at a level about one-tenth that of Io. Europa is thought to have a thin crust (less than thick) of water ice, possibly floating on a -deep ocean.

Two new, small satellites, Adrastea and Metis, were found orbiting just outside the ring. A third new satellite, Thebe, was discovered between the orbits of Amalthea and Io.

=== Encounter with Saturn ===

The closest approach to Saturn occurred at 03:24:05 UT on August 26, 1981. When &quot;Voyager 2&quot; passed behind Saturn, viewed from Earth, it utilized its radio link to investigate Saturn&#x27;s upper atmosphere, gathering data on both temperature and pressure. In the highest regions of the atmosphere, where the pressure was measured at , &quot;Voyager 2&quot; recorded a temperature of . Deeper within the atmosphere, where the pressure was recorded to be , the temperature rose to . The spacecraft also observed that the north pole was approximately cooler at than mid-latitudes, a variance potentially attributable to seasonal shifts (&quot;see also Saturn Oppositions&quot;).

After its Saturn fly-by, &quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s scan platform experienced an anomaly causing its azimuth actuator to seize. This malfunction led to some data loss and posed challenges for the spacecraft&#x27;s continued mission. The anomaly was traced back to a combination of issues, including a design flaw in the actuator shaft bearing and gear lubrication system, corrosion, and debris build-up. While overuse and depleted lubricant were factors, other elements, such as dissimilar metal reactions and a lack of relief ports, compounded the problem. Engineers on the ground were able to issue a series of commands, rectifying the issue to a degree that allowed the scan platform to resume its function. &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, which would have been diverted to perform the Titan flyby if &quot;Voyager 1&quot; had been unable to, did not pass near Titan due to the malfunction, and subsequently, proceeded with its mission to explore the Uranian system.

=== Encounter with Uranus ===

The closest approach to Uranus occurred on January 24, 1986, when &quot;Voyager 2&quot; came within of the planet&#x27;s cloudtops. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; also discovered 11 previously unknown moons: Cordelia, Ophelia, Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Portia, Rosalind, Belinda, Puck and Perdita. The mission also studied the planet&#x27;s unique atmosphere, caused by its axial tilt of 97.8°; and examined the Uranian ring system. The length of a day on Uranus as measured by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; is 17 hours, 14 minutes. Uranus was shown to have a magnetic field that was misaligned with its rotational axis, unlike other planets that had been visited to that point, and a helix-shaped magnetic tail stretching 10 million kilometers (6 million miles) away from the Sun.

When &quot;Voyager 2&quot; visited Uranus, much of its cloud features were hidden by a layer of haze; however, false-color and contrast-enhanced images show bands of concentric clouds around its south pole. This area was also found to radiate large amounts of ultraviolet light, a phenomenon that is called &quot;dayglow&quot;. The average atmospheric temperature is about . The illuminated and dark poles, and most of the planet, exhibit nearly the same temperatures at the cloud tops.

The &quot;Voyager 2&quot; Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) experiment observed 140 lightning flashes, or Uranian electrostatic discharges with a frequency of 0.9-40 MHz. The UEDs were detected from 600,000 km of Uranus over 24 hours, most of which were not visible. However, microphysical modeling suggests that Uranian lightning occurs in convective storms occurring in deep troposphere water clouds. If this is the case, lightning will not be visible due to the thick cloud layers above the troposphere. Uranian lightning has a power of around 108 W, emits 1×10^7 J – 2×10^7 J of energy, and lasts an average of 120 ms.

Detailed images from &quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s flyby of the Uranian moon Miranda showed huge canyons made from geological faults. One hypothesis suggests that Miranda might consist of a reaggregation of material following an earlier event when Miranda was shattered into pieces by a violent impact.

&quot;Voyager 2&quot; discovered two previously unknown Uranian rings. Measurements showed that the Uranian rings are different from those at Jupiter and Saturn. The Uranian ring system might be relatively young, and it did not form at the same time that Uranus did. The particles that make up the rings might be the remnants of a moon that was broken up by either a high-velocity impact or torn up by tidal effects.

In March 2020, NASA astronomers reported the detection of a large atmospheric magnetic bubble, also known as a plasmoid, released into outer space from the planet Uranus, after reevaluating old data recorded during the flyby.

=== Encounter with Neptune ===
Following a course correction in 1987, &quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s closest approach to Neptune occurred on August 25, 1989. Through repeated computerized test simulations of trajectories through the Neptunian system conducted in advance, flight controllers determined the best way to route &quot;Voyager 2&quot; through the Neptune–Triton system. Since the plane of the orbit of Triton is tilted significantly with respect to the plane of the ecliptic; through course corrections, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; was directed into a path about above the north pole of Neptune. Five hours after &quot;Voyager 2&quot; made its closest approach to Neptune, it performed a close fly-by of Triton, Neptune&#x27;s largest moon, passing within about .

In 1989, the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) experiment observed around 60 lightning flashes, or Neptunian electrostatic discharges emitting energies over 7×10 J. A plasma wave system (PWS) detected 16 electromagnetic wave events with a frequency range of 50 Hz – 12 kHz at magnetic latitudes 7˚-33˚. These plasma wave detections were possibly triggered by lightning over 20 minutes in the ammonia clouds of the magnetosphere. During &quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s closest approach to Neptune, the PWS instrument provided Neptune’s first plasma wave detections at a sample rate of 28,800 samples per second. The measured plasma densities range from 10 – 10 cm.

&quot;Voyager 2&quot; discovered previously unknown Neptunian rings, and confirmed six new moons: Despina, Galatea, Larissa, Proteus, Naiad and Thalassa. While in the neighborhood of Neptune, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; discovered the &quot;Great Dark Spot&quot;, which has since disappeared, according to observations by the Hubble Space Telescope. The Great Dark Spot was later hypothesized to be a region of clear gas, forming a window in the planet&#x27;s high-altitude methane cloud deck.

== Interstellar mission ==

Once its planetary mission was over, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; was described as working on an interstellar mission, which NASA is using to find out what the Solar System is like beyond the heliosphere. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; is transmitting scientific data at about 160 bits per second. Information about continuing telemetry exchanges with &quot;Voyager 2&quot; is available from Voyager Weekly Reports.

In 1992, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; observed the nova V1974 Cygni in the far-ultraviolet, first of its kind. The further increase in the brightness at those wavelengths helped in the more detailed study of the nova.

In July 1994, an attempt was made to observe the impacts from fragments of the comet Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter. The craft&#x27;s position meant it had a direct line of sight to the impacts and observations were made in the ultraviolet and radio spectrum. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; failed to detect anything, with calculations showing that the fireballs were just below the craft&#x27;s limit of detection.

On November 29, 2006, a telemetered command to &quot;Voyager 2&quot; was incorrectly decoded by its on-board computer—in a random error—as a command to turn on the electrical heaters of the spacecraft&#x27;s magnetometer. These heaters remained turned on until December 4, 2006, and during that time, there was a resulting high temperature above , significantly higher than the magnetometers were designed to endure, and a sensor rotated away from the correct orientation.

On August 30, 2007, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; passed the termination shock and then entered into the heliosheath, approximately closer to the Sun than &quot;Voyager 1&quot; did. This is due to the interstellar magnetic field of deep space. The southern hemisphere of the Solar System&#x27;s heliosphere is being pushed in.

On April 22, 2010, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; encountered scientific data format problems. On May 17, 2010, JPL engineers revealed that a flipped bit in an on-board computer had caused the problem, and scheduled a bit reset for May 19. On May 23, 2010, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; resumed sending science data from deep space after engineers fixed the flipped bit.

In 2013, it was originally thought that &quot;Voyager 2&quot; would enter interstellar space in two to three years, with its plasma spectrometer providing the first direct measurements of the density and temperature of the interstellar plasma. But the Voyager project scientist, Edward C. Stone and his colleagues said they lacked evidence of what would be the key signature of interstellar space: a shift in the direction of the magnetic field. Finally, in December 2018, Stone announced that &quot;Voyager 2&quot; reached interstellar space on November 5, 2018.

Maintenance to the Deep Space Network cut outbound contact with the probe for eight months in 2020. Contact was reestablished on November 2, when a series of instructions was transmitted, subsequently executed, and relayed back with a successful communication message. On February 12, 2021, full communications were restored after a major ground station antenna upgrade that took a year to complete.

In October 2020, astronomers reported a significant unexpected increase in density in the space beyond the Solar System as detected by the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot;; this implies that &quot;the density gradient is a large-scale feature of the VLISM (very local interstellar medium) in the general direction of the heliospheric nose&quot;.

On July 18, 2023, Voyager 2 overtook &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; as the second farthest spacecraft from the Sun.

On July 21, 2023, a programming error misaligned &quot;Voyager 2&quot;&#x27;s high gain antenna 2 degrees away from Earth, breaking communications with the spacecraft. By August 1, the spacecraft&#x27;s carrier signal was detected using multiple antennas of the Deep Space Network. A high-power &quot;shout&quot; on August 4 sent from the Canberra station successfully commanded the spacecraft to reorient towards Earth, resuming communications. As a failsafe measure, the probe is also programmed to autonomously reset its orientation to point towards Earth, which would have occurred by October 15.

== Reductions in capabilities ==
As the power from the RTG slowly reduces, various items of equipment have been turned off on the spacecraft. The first science equipment turned off on &quot;Voyager 2&quot; was the PPS in 1991, which saved 1.2 watts.

=== Concerns with the orientation thrusters ===
Some thrusters needed to control the correct attitude of the spacecraft and to point its high-gain antenna in the direction of Earth are out of use due to clogging problems in their hydrazine injector. The spacecraft no longer has backups available for its thruster system and &quot;everything onboard is running on single-string&quot; as acknowledged by Suzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager at JPL, in an interview with Ars Technica. NASA has decided to patch the computer software in order to modify the functioning of the remaining thrusters to slow down the clogging of the small diameter hydrazine injector jets. Before uploading the software update on the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; computer, NASA will first try the procedure with &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, which is closer to Earth.

== Future of the probe ==
The probe is expected to keep transmitting weak radio messages until at least the mid-2020s, more than 48 years after it was launched. NASA says that &quot;The Voyagers are destined—perhaps eternally—to wander the Milky Way.&quot;

&quot;Voyager 2&quot; is not headed toward any particular star. The nearest star is 4.2 light-years away, and at 15.341 km/s, the spacecraft travels one light-year in about 19,541 years - during which time the nearby stars will also move substantially. In roughly 42,000 years, Voyager 2 will pass the star Ross 248 (10.30 light-years away from Earth) at a distance of 1.7 light-years. If undisturbed for 296,000 years, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; should pass by the star Sirius (8.6 light-years from Earth) at a distance of 4.3 light-years.

== Golden record ==


Both Voyager space probes carry a gold-plated audio-visual disc, a compilation meant to showcase the diversity of life and culture on Earth in the event that either spacecraft is ever found by any extraterrestrial discoverer. The record, made under the direction of a team including Carl Sagan and Timothy Ferris, includes photos of the Earth and its lifeforms, a range of scientific information, spoken greetings from people such as the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of the United States and a medley, &quot;Sounds of Earth&quot;, that includes the sounds of whales, a baby crying, waves breaking on a shore, and a collection of music spanning different cultures and eras including works by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Blind Willie Johnson, Chuck Berry and Valya Balkanska. Other Eastern and Western classics are included, as well as performances of indigenous music from around the world. The record also contains greetings in 55 different languages. The project aimed to portray the richness of life on Earth and stand as a testament to human creativity and the desire to connect with the cosmos.

<doc id="32783" wikidata="Q575965" url="?curid=32783" title="Antisemitism and the New Testament">
<text>Antisemitism and the New Testament is the discussion of how some Christians&#x27; views of Judaism in the New Testament have contributed to discrimination against Jewish people throughout history and in the present day.

The idea that the New Testament is antisemitic is a controversy that has emerged in the aftermath of the Holocaust and is often associated with a thesis put forward by Rosemary Ruether. Debates surrounding various positions partly revolve around how antisemitism is defined, and on scholarly disagreements over whether antisemitism has a monolithic continuous history or is instead an umbrella term covering many distinct kinds of hostility to Jews over history.

Factional agendas underpin the writing of the canonical texts, and the various New Testament documents are windows into the conflict and debates of that period. According to Timothy Johnson, mutual slandering among competing sects was quite strong in the period when these works were composed. The New Testament moreover is an ensemble of texts written over decades and &quot;it is quite meaningless to speak about a single New Testament attitude&quot;.

==The New Testament and Christian antisemitism==
According to Rabbi Michael J. Cook, Professor of Intertestamental and Early Christian Literature at the Hebrew Union College, there are ten themes in the New Testament that have been sources of anti-Judaism and antisemitism:
Cook believes that both contemporary Jews and contemporary Christians need to reexamine the history of early Christianity, and the transformation of Christianity from a Jewish sect consisting of followers of a Jewish Jesus, to a separate religion often dependent on the tolerance of Rome while proselytizing among gentiles loyal to the Roman Empire, to understand how the story of Jesus came to be recast in an anti-Jewish form as the Gospels took their final form.

Some scholars say that critical verses in the New Testament have been used to incite prejudice and violence against Jewish people. Professor Lillian C. Freudmann, author of &quot;Antisemitism in the New Testament&quot; (University Press of America, 1994) has published a study of such verses and the effects that they have had in the Christian community throughout history. Similar studies have been made by both Christian and Jewish scholars, including, Professors Clark Williamsom (Christian Theological Seminary), Hyam Maccoby (The Leo Baeck Institute), Norman A. Beck (Texas Lutheran College), and Michael Berenbaum (Georgetown University).

==New Testament==

There are some verses in the New Testament that describe Jews in a positive way, attributing to them salvation or divine love.

According to the New Testament Gospels, Jesus, on his fateful entry into Jerusalem before Passover, was received by a great crowd of people. Jesus was arrested and tried by the Sanhedrin. After the trial, Jesus was handed over to Pontius Pilate, who duly tried him again and, at the urging of the people, had him crucified.

The New Testament records that Jesus&#x27; disciple Judas Iscariot, the Roman governor Pontius Pilate along with Roman forces and the leaders and people of Jerusalem were (to varying degrees) responsible for the death of Jesus.

===Gospel of Mark===
According to the Gospel of Mark, the crucifixion of Jesus was authorized by Roman authorities at the insistence of leading Jews (Judeans) from the Sanhedrin.

Paul H. Jones writes:
===Gospel of Matthew===

The Gospel of Matthew is often evaluated as the most Jewish of the canonical gospels, and yet it is sometimes said that it is anti-Judaic or antisemitic.

The Gospel of Matthew has given readers the impression his hostility to Jews increases as his narrative progresses, until it culminates in chapter 23. In chapter 21, the parable of the vineyard, which is strikingly similar to Isaiah 5:1-30, is followed by the great &quot;stone&quot; text, an early Christological interpretation of Psalm 118: &quot;The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone&quot;. The Old Testament allusions appear to suggest that the author thought God would call to account Israel&#x27;s leaders for maltreating Christ, and that the covenant will pass to the gentiles who follow Christ, a view that arose in intersectarian polemics in Judaism between the followers of Christ and the Jewish leadership. Then, in chapters 23 and 24, three successive hostile pericopes are recorded. First, a series of &quot;woes&quot; are pronounced against the Pharisees:
Certain passages which speak of the destruction of Jerusalem have elements that are interpreted as indications of Matthew&#x27;s anti-Judaic attitudes. Jesus is said to have lamented over the capital: &quot;Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it...See, your house is left to you, desolate&quot;. Again, Jesus is made to predict the demise of the Temple: &quot;Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down&quot;. Such visions of an end to the old Temple may be read as embodying the replacement theology, according to which Christianity supersedes Judaism.

The culmination of this rhetoric, and arguably the one verse that has caused more Jewish suffering than any other second Testament passage, is the uniquely Matthean attribution to the Jewish people:

This &quot;blood guilt&quot; text has been interpreted by some to mean that all Jews, of Jesus&#x27; time and forever afterward, accept responsibility for the death of Jesus. Shelly Matthews writes:
Douglas Hare noted that the Gospel of Matthew avoids sociological explanations for persecution:
The term &quot;Jews&quot; in the Gospel of Matthew is applied to those who deny the resurrection of Jesus and believe that the disciples stole Jesus&#x27;s corpse.

===Gospel of John===
In the Gospel of John, the word Ἰουδαῖοι, usually translated &quot;the Jews&quot;, is used 63 times, in a hostile sense 31 times, and no distinctions are made between Jewish groups. The Sadducees, for example, prominent elsewhere, are not distinguished. The enemies of Jesus are described collectively as the &quot;&quot;, in contradistinction to the other evangelists, who do not generally ascribe to the &quot;&quot; collectively calls for the death of Jesus. In the other three texts, the plot to put Jesus to death is always presented as coming from a small group of priests and rulers, the Sadducees. The Gospel of John is the primary source of the image of &quot;the Jews&quot; acting collectively as the enemy of Jesus, which later became fixed in Christian minds.

In several places, John&#x27;s gospel also associates the &quot; with darkness and with the devil. In John 8:37-39; 44–47, Jesus says, speaking to a group of Pharisees:
Although the modern consensus is that the term &quot; (Jews) in John refers exclusively to religious authorities, the basis for this statement has been challenged and John&#x27;s use of the term &quot;&quot; remains a complex and debated area of biblical scholarship, though it is accepted that it is not a case of antisemitism. New Testament scholar J.G. Dunn writes:
Reflecting the consensus that John&#x27;s use of the term refers strictly to Jewish religious authorities, some modern translations, such as Today&#x27;s New International Version, remove the term &quot;Jews&quot; and replace it with more specific terms to avoid antisemitic connotations. For example, Messianic Bibles, as well as the Jesus Seminar, often translate this as &quot;Judeans&quot;, i.e. residents of Judea, in contrast to residents of Galilee. 

====Later commentary====
Successive generations of Christians read in the Gospel of John the collective guilt of Jews, universally and in all generations, in the death of Christ. John&#x27;s use of the collective expression &quot;the Jews&quot; is likely explained by the historical circumstances and audience for which he wrote. With the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD, the Jewish priesthood, and thus the class of the Sadducees was massacred and thus ceased to exist, due to its role in the First Jewish–Roman War. As John wrote his Gospel after these events, for a gentile audience, he spoke generically of Jews, rather than specifying a group within Judaism that no longer existed and that would have been unfamiliar to his readers.

===First Epistle to the Thessalonians===
Paul writes in 1 Thessalonians 2:14-16 as follows:
The text appears somewhat anomalous compared to the general tone of thanksgiving, in that we have a diatribe against persecutors identified as Jews. The text appears to flagrantly contradict what Paul writes in chapters 9 to 11 of his Epistle to the Romans. This has led several scholars to question its authenticity, and suggest that it is an interpolation. According to Pieter Willem van der Horst, there is an instance of antisemitic statements in one of the Pauline epistles; David Luckensmeyer maintains that it was not written with the intent to condemn all Jews, Paul&#x27;s letters reveal someone who lived his life within Judaism, but did at the same time have an antisemitic effect. F. F. Bruce called it an &#x27;indiscriminate anti-Jewish polemic&#x27; mirroring Graeco-Roman pagan attitudes to the Jews. Gene Green, Ernest Best, T. Holtz, Amy Downey variously say that it resonates with Old Testament themes, plays on Jewish fears of being the &quot;privileged people of God&quot; and typical of an argumentative style shared by Greeks and Jews alike and thus, in Downey&#x27;s words, exemplifying an intracultural clash between Paul the Jew and Jewish leaders opposing the propagation of Gospel ideas in both Judea and Thessalonia.

===Epistle to the Hebrews===
Most scholars consider the Epistle to the Hebrews to have been written for Christians who were tempted to return to Judaism. Lillian Freudmann thinks that it in trying to argue the superiority of Christianity to Judaism, it twisted Old Testament passages in a way that transmitted an anti-Torah antisemitism. John Gager reads it as a polemic against Judaism, not the Jewish people, and regards it as the most important anti-Judaizing text of early Christianity. Samuel Sandmel says that rather than vilifying Judaism, or the Jews of that age, the Epistle to the Hebrews is an argument for the supersessionist notion that Christianity is the pinnacle of ancient Judaism. William L. Lane dismissed the idea that it contains an anti-Judaic polemic, its primary concern being simply to say that the Old Testament prophecies had been fulfilled. Those who see in its discontinuities antisemitism are wrong William Hagner said: there may be anti-Judaism, but no antagonism for Jews. While it promotes supersessionism it venerates the Hebrew saints, for Donald Bloesch, and therefore what it is exhorting is the replacement of Jewish institutions, not Jews. For Timothy Johnson, Christianity had to struggle to survive amid a majority of sects that were not Messianic, and whatever slander there is, is to be understood as the rhetoric of a marginal group against the majority of Jews. Such rhetorical vehemence was common in antiquity in religious and philosophical disputes.

===Book of Revelation===
In Revelation 2:9 and 3:9, Jesus makes reference to a &quot;synagogue of Satan&quot; (συναγωγή τοῦ Σατανᾶ). At Revelation 2:9 we have:

At 3:9 one reads:
There is no certainty about who are those claiming falsely to be Jews: whether they are Jews hostile to gentiles, Jewish Christians persecuted by a Jewish majority, Jews who are practicing a &quot;false&quot; form of Judaism or gentiles feigning to be Jews.
The traditional interpretation upheld until recently by a majority of scholars took this to denote Jews hostile to Christians, and specifically to the Jewish communities of Smyrna (2:9) and Philadelphia (3:9). In the Smyrna passage, according to Koester, those claiming to be Jews probably bore in their traits the usual markers of kinship, circumcision, dietary restriction and Sabbath observance, but are taken to task for denouncing the Christian community to the Roman authorities to get them arrested.

This has recently been questioned by Elaine Pagels, David Frankfurter, Heinrich Kraft and John W. Marshall. Pagels, reviewing the literature, says that the author of Revelation, John of Patmos, saw himself as a Jew, not a Christian. Unlike the other evangelists who blame Jews for Christ&#x27;s death, the author of Revelation, drawing on old patterns of late Jewish eschatological imagery, assigns responsibility for his death to Romans and says they are abetted by an internal enemy who feign to be God&#x27;s people while acting as agents of Satan, a theme also present in the literature of the Qumran sectaries. Pagels identifies most of these internal enemies as converts to the Pauline doctrine and teachings prevailing among gentiles. Taken literally the passage at Revelations 3:9 would refer to gentiles upstaging Jewish followers of Jesus, feigning to be more Jewish than Jews themselves. Paul Duff on the other hand assumes they are Jews, like John himself, but Jews who are hostile to the Jesus movement. David Frankfurter has revived the old argument of Ferdinand Baur by endorsing the view that in fact the members of Satan&#x27;s synagogue are mostly gentiles, claiming Israel&#x27;s legacy while rebuffing religious practices that are obligatory for Jews. Even those who, like David Aune, consider that the phrase indicates Jews, not gentiles, allow that the Book of Revelation is virtually devoid of traces of the polemics between Christians and Jews typical of those times. Pagels concludes that the evidence weighs in favour of reading the &#x27;synagogue of Satan&#x27; as referring to gentile converts to the Pauline version of the Jesus movement, who denominate themselves as &#x27;those of Christ/Christians&#x27;, a terminology never used by John of Patmos.

It has been said that the idea of a Jewish Antichrist developed from these verses.

==Modern responses==
In the decree &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; in 1965, Pope Paul VI declared that 
True, the Jewish authorities and those who followed their lead pressed for the death of Christ; still, what happened in His passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today. Although the Church is the new people of God, the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures.

Norman A. Beck, professor of theology and classical languages at Texas Lutheran University, has proposed that Christian lectionaries remove what he calls &quot;… the specific texts identified as most problematic …&quot;. Beck identifies what he deems to be offensive passages in the New Testament and indicates the instances in which these texts or portions thereof are included in major lectionary series.

Daniel Goldhagen, former associate professor of Political Science at Harvard University, also suggested in his book &quot;A Moral Reckoning&quot; that the Roman Catholic Church should change its doctrine and the accepted Biblical canon to excise statements he labels as antisemitic – he counts some 450 such passages in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts of the Apostles alone – to indicate that &quot;The Jews&#x27; way to God is as legitimate as the Christian way&quot;.

The Church of England Faith and Order Commission document &quot;God&#x27;s Unfailing Word: Theological and Practical Perspectives on Christian-Jewish Relations&quot; addresses the matter of New Testament texts and connection to antisemitism: &quot;Varying theological emphases within the Church of England regarding the doctrine of scriptural interpretation and authority may have a bearing on how such concerns are addressed.&quot;

James Dunn has said that the New Testament contributed toward subsequent antisemitism in the Christian community.

==Academic views==
A. Roy Eckardt, a writer in the field of Jewish-Christian relations, said that the foundation of antisemitism and responsibility for the Holocaust lies ultimately in the New Testament. Eckardt insisted that Christian repentance must include a reexamination of basic theological attitudes toward Jews and the New Testament in order to deal effectively with antisemitism.

According to Louis Feldman, the term &quot;antisemitism&quot; is an &quot;absurdity which the Jews took over from the Germans.&quot; He thinks the proper term is anti-Judaism. The distinction between anti-Judaism and antisemitism is often made, or challenged, with regard to early Christian hostility to Jews: some, notably Gavin I. Langmuir, prefer anti-Judaism, which implies a theological enmity. They say that the concept of antisemitism &quot;makes little sense&quot; in the nascent days of the Christian religion and that it would not emerge until later. In this context, the term antisemitism implies the secular biological race theories of modern times. Peter Schäfer prefers the word Judaeophobia for pagan hostility to Jews, but considers the word antisemitism, even if anachronistic, synonymous with this term, while adding that Christian anti-Judaism eventually was crucial to what later became antisemitism. Dunn says that the various New Testament expressions of anger and hurt by a minority puzzled by the refusal of a majority to accept their claims about Jesus the Jew reflect inner tensions between Jewish communities not yet unified by rabbinical Judaism, and a Christianity not yet detached from Judaism. The Greek word &quot;Ioudaioi&quot; (Ancient Greek: &quot;Ἰουδαῖοι&quot;) used throughout the New Testament translates to &quot;Jews&quot;, more specifically to &quot;Judeans&quot;. The term &quot;Hellenistes&quot; (Greek: ) refers to the Hellenized Jews.

<text>The V2 (), with the technical name &quot;Aggregat 4&quot; (A4), was the world&#x27;s first long-range guided ballistic missile. The missile, powered by a liquid-propellant rocket engine, was developed during the Second World War in Nazi Germany as a &quot;vengeance weapon&quot; and assigned to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the Allied bombings of German cities. The rocket also became the first artificial object to travel into space by crossing the Kármán line (edge of space) with the vertical launch of MW 18014 on 20 June 1944.

Research of military use of long-range rockets began when the graduate studies of Wernher von Braun were noticed by the German Army. A series of prototypes culminated in the A4, which went to war as the . Beginning in September 1944, more than 3,000 were launched by the Wehrmacht against Allied targets, first London and later Antwerp and Liège. According to a 2011 BBC documentary, the attacks from resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9,000 civilians and military personnel, while a further 12,000 laborers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons.

The rockets travelled at supersonic speeds, impacted without audible warning, and proved unstoppable. No effective defense existed. Teams from the Allied forces—the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union—raced to seize major German manufacturing facilities, procure the Germans&#x27; missile technology, and capture the V-2s&#x27; launching sites. Von Braun and more than 100 core R&amp;D personnel surrendered to the Americans, and many of the original team transferred their work to the Redstone Arsenal, where they were relocated as part of Operation Paperclip. The US also captured enough hardware to build approximately 80 of the missiles. The Soviets gained possession of the manufacturing facilities after the war, re-established production, and moved it to the Soviet Union.

== Development history ==


During the late 1920s, a young Wernher von Braun bought a copy of Hermann Oberth&#x27;s book, &quot;Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen&quot; (&quot;The Rocket into Interplanetary Spaces&quot;). In 1928 a &quot;Raketenrummel&quot; or &quot;Rocket Rumble&quot; fad in the popular media was initiated by Fritz von Opel and Max Valier, a collaborator of Oberth, by experimenting with rockets, including public demonstrations of manned rocket cars and rocket planes. The “Rocket Rumble” was highly influential on von Braun as a teenage space enthusiast. He was so enthusiastic after seeing one of the public Opel-RAK rocket car demonstrations, that he constructed and launched his own homemade toy rocket car in a crowded sidewalk and was later taken in for questioning by the local police, until released to his father for disciplinary action.

Starting in 1930, von Braun attended the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin), where he assisted Oberth in liquid-fueled rocket motor tests. Von Braun was working on his doctorate when the Nazi Party gained power in Germany. An artillery captain, Walter Dornberger, arranged an Ordnance Department research grant for von Braun, who from then on worked next to Dornberger&#x27;s existing solid-fuel rocket test site at Kummersdorf. Von Braun&#x27;s thesis, &quot;Construction, Theoretical, and Experimental Solution to the Problem of the Liquid Propellant Rocket&quot; (dated 16 April 1934), was kept classified by the German Army and was not published until 1960. By the end of 1934, his group had successfully launched two rockets that reached heights of .

At the time, many Germans were interested in American physicist Robert H. Goddard&#x27;s research. Before 1939, German engineers and scientists occasionally contacted Goddard directly with technical questions. Von Braun used Goddard&#x27;s plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the &quot;Aggregate&quot; (A) series of rockets, named for the German word for mechanism or mechanical system.

After successes at Kummersdorf with the first two Aggregate series rockets, Braun and Walter Riedel began thinking of a much larger rocket in the summer of 1936, based on a projected thrust engine. In addition, Dornberger specified the military requirements needed to include a 1-ton payload, a range of 172 miles with a dispersion of 2 or 3 miles, and transportable using road vehicles.

After the A-4 project was postponed due to unfavorable aerodynamic stability testing of the A-3 in July 1936,
Braun specified the A-4 performance in 1937, and, after an &quot;extensive&quot; series of test firings of the A-5 scale test model, using a motor redesigned from the troublesome A-3 by Walter Thiel, A-4 design and construction was ordered 1938–39. During 28–30 September 1939, (English: &quot;The Day of Wisdom&quot;) conference met at Peenemünde to initiate the funding of university research to solve rocket problems.
By late 1941, the Army Research Center at Peenemünde possessed the technologies essential to the success of the A-4. The four main technologies for the A-4 were large liquid-fuel rocket engines, supersonic aerodynamics, gyroscopic guidance and rudders in jet control. At the time, Adolf Hitler was not particularly impressed by the V-2; he opined that it was merely an artillery shell with a longer range and much higher cost.

During early September 1943, Braun promised the Long-Range Bombardment Commission that the A-4 development was &quot;practically complete/concluded&quot;, but even by the middle of 1944, a complete A-4 parts list was still unavailable. Hitler was sufficiently impressed by the enthusiasm of its developers, and needed a &quot;wonder weapon&quot; to maintain German morale, so he authorized its deployment in large numbers.

The V-2s were constructed at the Mittelwerk site by prisoners from Mittelbau-Dora, a concentration camp where 20,000 prisoners died.

In 1943, the Austrian resistance group including Heinrich Maier managed to send exact drawings of the V-2 rocket to the American Office of Strategic Services. Location sketches of V-rocket manufacturing facilities, such as those in Peenemünde, were also sent to the Allied general staff in order to enable Allied bombers to perform airstrikes. This information was particularly important for Operation Crossbow and Operation Hydra, both preliminary missions for Operation Overlord. The group was gradually captured by the Gestapo and most of the members were executed.

== Technical details ==

The A4 used a 75% ethanol/25% water mixture (&quot;B-Stoff&quot;) for fuel and liquid oxygen (LOX) (&quot;A-Stoff&quot;) for oxidizer. The water reduced the flame temperature, acted as a coolant by turning to steam and augmented the thrust, tended to produce a smoother burn, and reduced thermal stress.

Rudolf Hermann&#x27;s supersonic wind tunnel was used to measure the A4&#x27;s aerodynamic characteristics and center of pressure, using a model of the A4 within a 40 square centimeter chamber. Measurements were made using a Mach 1.86 blowdown nozzle on 8 August 1940. Tests at Mach numbers 1.56 and 2.5 were made after 24 September 1940.

At launch the A4 propelled itself for up to 65 seconds on its own power, and a program motor held the inclination at the specified angle until engine shutdown, after which the rocket continued on a ballistic free-fall trajectory. The rocket reached a height of or 264,000 ft after shutting off the engine.

The fuel and oxidizer pumps were driven by a steam turbine, and the steam was produced by concentrated hydrogen peroxide (T-Stoff) with sodium permanganate (Z-Stoff) catalyst. Both the alcohol and oxygen tanks were an aluminum-magnesium alloy.

The turbopump, rotating at 4,000 rpm, forced the alcohol and oxygen into the combustion chamber at 125 liters (33 US gallons) per second, where they were ignited by a spinning electrical igniter. Thrust increased from 8 tons during this preliminary stage whilst the fuel was gravity-fed, before increasing to 25 tons as the turbopump pressurised the fuel, lifting the 13.5 ton rocket. Combustion gases exited the chamber at , and a speed of per second. The oxygen to fuel mixture was 1.0:0.85 at 25 tons of thrust, but as ambient pressure decreased with flight altitude, thrust increased until it reached 29 tons. The turbopump assembly contained two centrifugal pumps, one for the alcohol, and one for the oxygen, The turbine connects directly by a shaft to the alcohol pump and through a flexible joint and shaft to the oxygen pump. Hydrogen peroxide converted to steam, using a sodium permanganate catalyst powered the pump, which delivered of alcohol and of liquid oxygen per second to a combustion chamber at .

Dr. Thiel&#x27;s development of the 25 ton rocket motor relied on pump feeding, rather than on the earlier pressure feeding. The motor used centrifugal injection, and used both regenerative cooling and film cooling. Film cooling admitted alcohol into the combustion chamber and exhaust nozzle under slight pressure through four rings of small perforations. The mushroom-shaped injection head was removed from the combustion chamber to a mixing chamber, the combustion chamber was made more spherical while being shortened from 6 to 1-foot in length, and the connection to the nozzle was made cone shaped. The resultant 1.5 ton chamber operated at a combustion pressure of . Thiel&#x27;s 1.5 ton chamber was then scaled up to a 4.5 ton motor by arranging three injection heads above the combustion chamber. By 1939, eighteen injection heads in two concentric circles at the head of the thick sheet-steel chamber, were used to make the 25 ton motor.

The warhead was a source of trouble. The explosive used was amatol 60/40 detonated by an electric contact fuze. Amatol had the advantage of stability, and the warhead was protected by a thick layer of glass wool, but even so it could still explode during the re-entry phase. The warhead weighed and contained of explosive. The warhead&#x27;s percentage by weight that was explosive was 93%, a very great percentage when compared with other types of munition.

A protective layer of glass wool was also used for the fuel tanks so the A-4 did not have a tendency to form ice, a problem which plagued other early ballistic missiles such as the balloon tank-design SM-65 Atlas which entered US service in 1959. The tanks held of ethyl alcohol and of oxygen.
The V-2 was guided by four external rudders on the tail fins, and four internal graphite vanes in the jet stream at the exit of the motor. These 8 control surfaces were controlled by Helmut Hölzer&#x27;s analog computer, the , via electrical-hydraulic servomotors, based on electrical signals from the gyros. The Siemens &quot;Vertikant&quot; LEV-3 guidance system consisted of two free gyroscopes (a horizontal for pitch and a vertical with two degrees of freedom for yaw and roll) for lateral stabilization, coupled with a PIGA accelerometer, or the Walter Wolman radio control system, to control engine cutoff at a specified velocity. Other gyroscopic systems used in the A-4 included Kreiselgeräte&#x27;s SG-66 and SG-70. The V-2 was launched from a pre-surveyed location, so the distance and azimuth to the target were known. Fin 1 of the missile was aligned to the target azimuth.

Some later V-2s used &quot;guide beams&quot;, radio signals transmitted from the ground, as an added input to the Mischgerät analog computer to keep the missile on course in azimuth. The flying distance was controlled by the timing of the engine cut-off, &quot;Brennschluss&quot;, ground-controlled by a Doppler system or by different types of on-board integrating accelerometers. Thus, range was a function of engine burn time, which ended when a specific velocity was achieved. Just before engine cutoff, thrust was reduced to eight tons, in an effort to avoid any water hammer problems a rapid cutoff could cause.

Dr. Friedrich Kirchstein of Siemens of Berlin developed the V-2 radio control for motor-cut-off (). For velocity measurement, Professor Wolman of Dresden created an alternative of his Doppler tracking system in 1940–41, which used a ground signal transponded by the A-4 to measure the velocity of the missile. By 9 February 1942, Peenemünde engineer Gerd had documented the radio interference area of a V-2 as around the &quot;Firing Point&quot;, and the first successful A-4 flight on 3 October 1942, used radio control for . Although Hitler commented on 22 September 1943 that &quot;It is a great load off our minds that we have dispensed with the radio guiding-beam; now no opening remains for the British to interfere technically with the missile in flight&quot;, about 20% of the operational V-2 launches were beam-guided. The Operation Pinguin V-2 offensive began on 8 September 1944, when (English: &#x27;Training and Testing Battery 444&#x27;) launched a single rocket guided by a radio beam directed at Paris. Wreckage of combat V-2s occasionally contained the transponder for velocity and fuel cutoff.

The painting of the operational V-2s was mostly a ragged-edged pattern with several variations, but at the end of the war a plain olive green rocket was also used. During tests the rocket was painted in a characteristic black-and-white chessboard pattern, which aided in determining if the rocket was spinning around its longitudinal axis.

The original German designation of the rocket was &quot;V2&quot;, unhyphenated – exactly as used for any Third Reich-era &quot;second prototype&quot; example of an RLM-registered German aircraft design – but U.S. publications such as &quot;Life&quot; magazine were using the hyphenated form &quot;V-2&quot; as early as December 1944.

=== Testing ===
The first successful test flight was on 3 October 1942, reaching an altitude of . On that day, Walter Dornberger declared in a meeting at Peenemünde:

Two test launches were recovered by the Allies: the Bäckebo rocket, the remnants of which landed in Sweden on 13 June 1944, and one recovered by the Polish resistance on 30 May 1944 from the Blizna V-2 missile launch site and transported to the UK during Operation Most III. The highest altitude reached during the war was (20 June 1944). Test launches of V-2 rockets were made at Peenemünde, Blizna and Tuchola Forest, and after the war, at Cuxhaven by the British, White Sands Proving Grounds and Cape Canaveral by the U.S., and Kapustin Yar by the USSR.

Various design issues were identified and solved during V-2 development and testing:
* To reduce tank pressure and weight, rapid flow turbopumps were used to increase pressure.
* A short and lighter combustion chamber without burn-through was developed by using centrifugal injection nozzles, a mixing compartment, and a converging nozzle to the throat for homogeneous combustion.
* Film cooling was used to prevent burn-through at the nozzle throat.
* Relay contacts were made more durable to withstand vibration and prevent thrust cut-off just after lift-off.
* Ensuring that the fuel pipes had tension-free curves reduced the likelihood of explosions at .
* Fins were shaped with clearance to prevent damage as the exhaust jet expanded with altitude.
* To control trajectory at liftoff and supersonic speeds, heat-resistant graphite vanes were used as rudders in the exhaust jet.

==== Air burst problem ====
Through mid-March 1944, only four of the 26 successful Blizna launches had satisfactorily reached the Sarnaki target area due to in-flight breakup () on re-entry into the atmosphere. (As mentioned above, one rocket was collected by the Polish Home Army, with parts of it transported to London for tests.) Initially, the German developers suspected excessive alcohol tank pressure, but by April 1944, after five months of test firings, the cause was still not determined. Major-General Rossmann, the Army Weapons Office department chief, recommended stationing observers in the target area – May/June, Dornberger and von Braun set up a camp at the centre of the Poland target zone. After moving to the Heidekraut, SS Mortar Battery 500 of the 836th Artillery Battalion (Motorized) was ordered on 30 August to begin test launches of eighty &#x27;sleeved&#x27; rockets. Testing confirmed that the so-called &#x27;tin trousers&#x27; – a tube designed to strengthen the forward end of the rocket cladding – reduced the likelihood of air bursts.

== Production ==
On 27 March 1942, Dornberger proposed production plans and the building of a launching site on the Channel coast. In December, Speer ordered Major Thom and Dr. Steinhoff to reconnoitre the site near Watten. Assembly rooms were established at Peenemünde and in the Friedrichshafen facilities of Zeppelin Works. In 1943, a third factory, Raxwerke, was added.

On 22 December 1942, Hitler signed the order for mass production, when Albert Speer assumed final technical data would be ready by July 1943. However, many issues still remained to be solved even by the autumn of 1943.

On 8 January 1943, Dornberger and von Braun met with Speer. Speer stated, &quot;As head of the Todt organisation I will take it on myself to start at once with the building of the launching site on the Channel coast,&quot; and established an A-4 production committee under Degenkolb.

On 26 May 1943, the Long-Range Bombardment Commission, chaired by AEG director Petersen, met at Peenemünde to review the V-1 and V-2 automatic long-range weapons. In attendance were Speer, Air Marshal Erhard Milch, Admiral Karl Dönitz, Col. General Friedrich Fromm, and Karl Saur. Both weapons had reached the final stage of development, and the commission decided to recommend to Hitler that both weapons be mass-produced. As Dornberger observed, &quot;The disadvantages of the one would be compensated by the other&#x27;s advantages.&quot;

On 7 July 1943, Major General Dornberger, von Braun, and Dr. Steinhof briefed Hitler in his Wolf&#x27;s Lair. Also in attendance were Speer, Wilhelm Keitel, and Alfred Jodl. The briefing included von Braun narrating a movie showing the successful launch on 3 October 1942, with scale models of the Channel coast firing bunker, and supporting vehicles, including the . Hitler then gave Peenemünde top priority in the German armaments program stating, &quot;Why was it I could not believe in the success of your work? if we had had these rockets in 1939 we should never have had this war...&quot; Hitler also wanted a second launch bunker built.

Saur planned to build 2,000 rockets per month, between the existing three factories and the Nordhausen Mittelwerk factory being built. However, alcohol production was dependent upon the potato harvest.

A production line was nearly ready at Peenemünde when the Operation Hydra attack occurred. The main targets of the attack included the test stands, the development works, the Pre-Production Works, the settlement where the scientists and technicians lived, the Trassenheide camp, and the harbor sector. According to Dornberger, &quot;Serious damage to the works, contrary to first impressions, was surprisingly small.&quot; Work resumed after a delay of four to six weeks, and because of camouflage to mimic complete destruction, there were no more raids during the next nine months. The raid resulted in 735 lives lost, with heavy losses at Trassenheide, while 178 were killed in the settlement, including Dr. Thiel, his family, and Chief Engineer Walther. The Germans eventually moved production to the underground &quot;Mittelwerk&quot; in the Kohnstein where 5,200 V-2 rockets were built with the use of forced labour.

== Launch sites ==

After the Operation Crossbow bombing, initial plans for launching from the massive underground Watten, Wizernes and Sottevast bunkers or from fixed pads such as near the Château du Molay were dismissed in favour of mobile launching. Eight main storage dumps were planned and four had been completed by July 1944 (the one at Mery-sur-Oise was begun during August 1943 and completed by February 1944). The missile could be launched practically anywhere, roads running through forests being a particular favourite. The system was so mobile and small that only one was ever caught in action by Allied aircraft, during the Operation Bodenplatte attack on 1 January 1945 near Lochem by a USAAF 4th Fighter Group aircraft, although Raymond Baxter described flying over a site during a launch and his wingman firing at the missile without hitting it.

It was estimated that a sustained rate of 350 V-2s could be launched per week, with 100 per day at maximum effort, given sufficient supply of the rockets.

== Operational history ==

The LXV &quot;Armeekorps&quot; z.b.V. formed during the last days of November 1943 in France commanded by &quot;General der Artillerie&quot; z.V. Erich Heinemann was responsible for the operational use of V-2. Three launch battalions were formed in late 1943, &quot;Artillerie Abteilung&quot; 836 (Mot.), Grossborn, Artillerie Abteilung 485 (Mot.), Naugard, and &quot;Artillerie Abteilung&quot; 962 (&quot;Mot.&quot;). Combat operations commenced in Sept. 1944, when training Batterie 444 deployed. On 2 September 1944, the SS &quot;Werfer-Abteilung&quot; 500 was formed, and by October, the SS under the command of SS Lt. Gen Hans Kammler, took operational control of all units. He formed &quot;Gruppe Süd&quot; with Art. Abt. 836, Merzig, and &quot;Gruppe Nord&quot; with Art. Abt. 485 and &quot;Batterie&quot; 444, Burgsteinfurt and The Hague.

After Hitler&#x27;s 29 August 1944 declaration to begin V-2 attacks as soon as possible, the offensive began on 7 September 1944 when two were launched at Paris (which the Allies had liberated less than two weeks earlier), but both crashed soon after launch. On 8 September a single rocket was launched at Paris, which caused modest damage near Porte d&#x27;Italie. Two more launches by the 485th followed, including one from The Hague against London on the same day at 6:43 pm. – the first landed at Staveley Road, Chiswick, killing 63-year-old Mrs. Ada Harrison, three-year-old Rosemary Clarke, and Sapper Bernard Browning on leave from the Royal Engineers, and one that hit Epping with no casualties.

The British government, concerned about spreading panic or giving away vital intelligence to German forces, initially attempted to conceal the cause of the explosions by making no official announcement, and euphemistically blaming them on defective gas mains. The public did not believe this explanation and therefore began referring to the V-2s as &quot;flying gas mains&quot;. The Germans themselves finally announced the V-2 on 8 November 1944 and only then, on 10 November 1944, did Winston Churchill inform Parliament, and the world, that England had been under rocket attack &quot;for the last few weeks&quot;.

In September 1944, control of the V-2 mission was transferred to the Waffen-SS and Division z.V.

Positions of the German launch units changed a number of times. For example, &quot;Artillerie Init 444&quot; arrived in the southwest Netherlands (in Zeeland) in September 1944. From a field near the village of Serooskerke, five V-2s were launched on 15 and 16 September, with one more successful and one failed launch on the 18th. That same date, a transport carrying a missile took a wrong turn and ended up in Serooskerke itself, giving a villager the opportunity to surreptitiously take some photographs of the weapon; these were smuggled to London by the Dutch Resistance. After that the unit moved to the woods near Rijs, Gaasterland in the northwest Netherlands, to ensure that the technology was not captured by the Allies. From Gaasterland V-2s were launched against Ipswich and Norwich from 25 September (London being out of range). Because of their inaccuracy, these V-2s did not hit their target cities. Soon after that only London and Antwerp remained as designated targets as ordered by Adolf Hitler himself, Antwerp being targeted in the period of 12 to 20 October, after which time the unit moved to The Hague.

== Targets ==

During the succeeding months about 3,172 V-2 rockets were fired at the following targets:

* Belgium, 1,664: Antwerp (1,610), Liège (27), Hasselt (13), Tournai (9), Mons (3), Diest (2)
* United Kingdom, 1,402: London (1,358), Norwich (43), Ipswich (1)
* France, 76: Lille (25), Paris (22), Tourcoing (19), Arras (6), Cambrai (4)
* Netherlands, 19: Maastricht (19)
* Germany, 11: Remagen (Ludendorff Bridge) (11)
Antwerp, Belgium was a target for a large number of V-weapon attacks from October 1944 through to the virtual end of the war in March 1945, leaving 1,736 dead and 4,500 injured in greater Antwerp. Thousands of buildings were damaged or destroyed as the city was struck by 590 direct hits. The largest loss of life by a single rocket attack during the war came on 16 December 1944, when the roof of the crowded Cine Rex was struck, leaving 567 dead and 291 injured.

An estimated 2,754 civilians were killed in London by V-2 attacks with another 6,523 injured, which is two people killed per V-2 rocket. The death toll in London did not meet the Nazis&#x27; full expectations, during early usage, as they had not yet perfected the accuracy of the V-2, with many rockets being misdirected and exploding harmlessly. Accuracy increased during the war, particularly for batteries where the (radio guide beam) system was used. Missile strikes that did hit targets could cause large numbers of deaths; 160 were killed and 108 seriously injured in one explosion at 12:26 pm on 25 November 1944, at a Woolworth&#x27;s department store in New Cross, south-east London.
British intelligence also helped impede the effectiveness of the Nazi weapon, sending false reports via their Double-Cross System implying that the rockets were over-shooting their London target by . This tactic worked; more than half of the V-2s aimed at London landed short of the London Civil Defence Region. Most landed on less-heavily populated areas in Kent due to erroneous recalibration. For the remainder of the war, British intelligence maintained the ruse by repeatedly sending bogus reports implying that these failed rockets were striking the British capital with heavy loss of life.

=== Possible use during Operation Bodenplatte ===

At least one V-2 missile on a mobile &quot;Meillerwagen&quot; launch trailer was observed being elevated to launch position by a USAAF 4th Fighter Group pilot defending against the massive New Year&#x27;s Day 1945 Operation Bodenplatte strike by the Luftwaffe over the northern German attack route near the town of Lochem on 1 January 1945. Possibly, from the potential sighting of the American fighter by the missile&#x27;s launch crew, the rocket was quickly lowered from a near launch-ready 85° elevation to 30°.

=== Tactical use on German target===

After the US Army captured the Ludendorff Bridge during the Battle of Remagen on 7 March 1945, the Germans were desperate to destroy it. On 17 March 1945, they fired eleven V-2 missiles at the bridge, their first use against a tactical target and the only time they were fired on a German target during the war. They could not employ the more accurate device because it was oriented towards Antwerp and could not be easily adjusted for another target. Fired from near Hellendoorn, the Netherlands, one of the missiles landed as far away as Cologne, to the north, while one missed the bridge by only . They also struck the town of Remagen, destroying a number of buildings and killing at least six American soldiers.

=== Final use ===

The final two rockets exploded on 27 March 1945. One of these was the last V-2 to kill a British civilian and the final civilian casualty of the war on British soil: Ivy Millichamp, aged 34, killed in her home in Kynaston Road, Orpington in Kent. A scientific reconstruction performed in 2010 demonstrated that the V-2 creates a crater wide and deep, ejecting approximately 3,000 tons of material into the air.

== Countermeasures ==


=== Big Ben and Operation Crossbow ===
Unlike the V-1, the V-2&#x27;s speed and trajectory made it practically invulnerable to anti-aircraft guns and fighters, as it dropped from an altitude of at up to three times the speed of sound at sea level (approximately ). Nevertheless, the threat of what was then code-named &quot;Big Ben&quot; was great enough that efforts were made to seek countermeasures. The situation was similar to the pre-war concerns about manned bombers and resulted in a similar solution, the formation of the Crossbow Committee, to collect, examine and develop countermeasures.

Early on, it was believed that the V-2 employed some form of radio guidance, a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering anything like a radio receiver. This resulted in efforts to jam this non-existent guidance system as early as September 1944, using both ground and air-based jammers flying over the UK. In October, a group had been sent to jam the missiles during launch. By December it was clear these systems were not having any obvious effect, and jamming efforts ended.

=== Anti-aircraft gun system (proposed) ===
General Frederick Alfred Pile, commander of Anti-Aircraft Command, studied the problem and proposed that enough anti-aircraft guns were available to produce a barrage of fire in the rocket&#x27;s path, but only if provided with a reasonable prediction of the trajectory. The first estimates suggested that 320,000 shells would have to be fired for each rocket. About 2% of these were expected to fall back to the ground, almost 90 tons of rounds, which would cause far more damage than the missile. At a 25 August 1944 meeting of the Crossbow Committee, the concept was rejected.

Pile continued studying the problem and returned with a proposal to fire only 150 shells at a single rocket, with those shells using a new fuse that would greatly reduce the number that fell back to Earth unexploded. Some low-level analysis suggested that this would be successful against 1 in 50 rockets, provided that accurate trajectories were forwarded to the gunners in time. Work on this basic concept continued and developed into a plan to deploy a large number of guns in Hyde Park that were provided with pre-configured firing data for grids of the London area. After the trajectory was determined, the guns would aim and fire between 60 and 500 rounds.

At a Crossbow meeting on 15 January 1945 Pile&#x27;s updated plan was presented with some strong advocacy from Roderic Hill and Charles Drummond Ellis. However, the Committee suggested that a test not be performed as no technique for tracking the missiles with sufficient accuracy had yet been developed. By March this had changed significantly, with 81% of incoming missiles correctly allotted to the grid square each fell into, or the one beside it. At a 26 March meeting Pile was directed to a subcommittee with RV Jones and Ellis to further develop the statistics. Three days later the team returned a report stating that if the guns fired 2,000 rounds at a missile there was a 1 in 60 chance of shooting it down. Plans for an operational test began, but as Pile later put it, &quot;Monty beat us to it&quot;, as the attacks ended with the Allied capture of their launching areas.

With the Germans no longer in control of any part of the continent that could be used as a launching site capable of striking London, they began targeting Antwerp. Plans were made to move the Pile system to protect that city, but the war ended before anything could be done.

=== Direct attack and disinformation===
The only effective defences against the V-2 campaign were to destroy the launch infrastructure—expensive in terms of bomber resources and casualties—or to cause the Germans to aim at the wrong place by disinformation. The British were able to convince the Germans to direct V-1s and V-2s aimed at London to less populated areas east of the city. This was done by sending deceptive reports on the sites hit and damage caused via the German espionage network in Britain, which was secretly controlled by the British (the Double-Cross System).

According to the BBC television presenter Raymond Baxter, who served with the RAF during the war, in February 1945 his squadron was performing a mission against a V2 launch site, when they saw one missile being launched. One member of Baxter&#x27;s squadron opened fire on it, without effect.

On 3 March 1945, the Allies attempted to destroy V-2s and launching equipment in the &quot;Haagse Bos&quot; in The Hague by a large-scale bombardment, but due to navigational errors the Bezuidenhout quarter was destroyed, killing 511 Dutch civilians.

== Assessment ==
The German V-weapons (V-1 and V-2) cost the equivalent of about US$500 million. Given the relatively smaller size of the German economy, this represented an industrial effort equivalent to but slightly less than that of the U.S. Manhattan Project that produced the atomic bomb. 6,048 V-2s were built, at a cost of approximately ( in 2011) each; 3,225 were launched.
SS General Hans Kammler, who as an engineer had constructed several concentration camps including Auschwitz, had a reputation for brutality and had originated the idea of using concentration camp prisoners as slave laborers for the rocket program. More people died manufacturing the V-2 than were killed by its deployment.

The V-2 consumed a third of Germany&#x27;s fuel alcohol production and major portions of other critical technologies: to distil the fuel alcohol for one V-2 launch required 30 tonnes of potatoes at a time when food was becoming scarce. Due to a lack of explosives, some warheads were simply filled with concrete, using the kinetic energy alone for destruction, and sometimes the warhead contained photographic propaganda of German citizens who had died in Allied bombings.

The psychological effect of the V-2 was considerable, as the V-2, traveling faster than the speed of sound, gave no warning before impact (unlike bombing planes or the V-1 flying bomb, which made a characteristic buzzing sound). There was no effective defence and no risk of pilot or crew casualties. An example of the impression it made is in the reaction of American pilot and future nuclear strategist and Congressional aide William Liscum Borden, who in November 1944 while returning from a nighttime air mission over Holland saw a V-2 in flight on its way to strike London: &quot;It resembled a meteor, streaming red sparks and whizzing past us as though the aircraft were motionless. I became convinced that it was only a matter of time until rockets would expose the United States to direct, transoceanic attack.&quot;

With the war all but lost, regardless of the factory output of conventional weapons, the Nazis resorted to V-weapons as a tenuous last hope to influence the war militarily (hence Antwerp as V-2 target), as an extension of their desire to &quot;punish&quot; their foes and most importantly to give hope to their sympathizers with their miracle weapon. The V-2 did not affect the outcome of the war, but it resulted in the development of the intercontinental ballistic missiles of the Cold War, which were also used for space exploration.

== Unfulfilled plans ==
A submarine-towed launch platform was tested successfully, making it the prototype for submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The project codename was (&quot;Test stand XII&quot;), sometimes termed the rocket U-boat. If deployed, it would have allowed a U-boat to launch V-2 missiles against United States cities, though only with considerable effort (and limited effect). Hitler, in July 1944 and Speer, in January 1945, made speeches alluding to the scheme, though Germany did not possess the capability to fulfill these threats. These schemes were met by the Americans with Operation Teardrop.

While interned after the war by the British at CSDIC camp 11, Dornberger was recorded saying that he had begged the Führer to stop the V-weapon propaganda, because nothing more could be expected from one ton of explosive. To this Hitler had replied that &quot;Dornberger&quot; might not expect more, but &quot;he&quot; (Hitler) certainly did.

According to decrypted messages from the Japanese embassy in Germany, twelve dismantled V-2 rockets were shipped to Japan. These left Bordeaux in August 1944 on the transport U-boats and , which reached Jakarta in December 1944. A civilian V-2 expert was a passenger on &quot;&quot;, bound for Japan in May 1945 when the war ended in Europe. The fate of these V-2 rockets is unknown.

== Post-war use ==

At the end of the war, a competition began between the United States and the USSR to retrieve as many V-2 rockets and staff as possible. Three hundred rail-car loads of V-2s and parts were captured and shipped to the United States and 126 of the principal designers, including Wernher von Braun and Walter Dornberger, were captives of the Americans. Von Braun, his brother Magnus von Braun, and seven others decided to surrender to the United States military (Operation Paperclip) to ensure they were not captured by the advancing Soviets or shot dead by the Nazis to prevent their capture.

After the Nazi defeat, German engineers were relocated to the United States, the USSR, France and the United Kingdom where they further developed the V-2 rocket for military and civilian purposes. The V-2 rocket also laid the foundation for the liquid fuel missiles and space launchers used later.

=== United States ===


Operation Paperclip recruited German engineers and Special Mission V-2 transported the captured V-2 parts to the United States. At the close of the Second World War, more than 300 rail cars filled with V-2 engines, fuselages, propellant tanks, gyroscopes, and associated equipment were brought to the railyards in Las Cruces, New Mexico, so they could be placed on trucks and driven to the White Sands Proving Grounds, also in New Mexico.

In addition to V-2 hardware, the U.S. Government delivered German mechanization equations for the V-2 guidance, navigation, and control systems, as well as for advanced development concept vehicles, to U.S. defence contractors for analysis. During the 1950s, some of these documents were useful to U.S. contractors in developing direction cosine matrix transformations and other inertial navigation architecture concepts that were applied to early U.S. programs, such as the Atlas and Minuteman guidance systems as well as the Navy&#x27;s Subs Inertial Navigation System.

A committee was formed with military and civilian scientists to review payload proposals for the reassembled V-2 rockets. By January 1946, the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps invited civilian scientists and engineers to participate in developing a space research program using the V-2. The committee was initially named the &quot;V2 Rocket Panel&quot;, then the &quot;V2 Upper Atmosphere Research Panel&quot;, and finally the &quot;Upper Atmosphere Rocket Research Panel&quot;. This resulted in an eclectic array of experiments that flew on V-2s and helped prepare for American manned space exploration. Devices were sent aloft to sample the air at all levels to determine atmospheric pressures and to see what gases were present. Other instruments measured the level of cosmic radiation.

Only 68 percent of the V-2 trials were considered successful. A supposed V-2 launched on 29 May 1947 landed near Juarez, Mexico and was actually a Hermes B-1 vehicle.

The U.S. Navy attempted to launch a German V-2 rocket at sea—one test launch from the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Midway&quot; was performed on 6 September 1947 as part of the Navy&#x27;s Operation Sandy. The test launch was a partial success; the V-2 went off the pad but splashed down in the ocean only some from the carrier. The launch setup on the Midway&#x27;s deck is notable in that it used foldaway arms to prevent the missile from falling over. The arms pulled away just after the engine ignited, releasing the missile. The setup may look similar to the R-7 Semyorka launch procedure but in the case of the R-7 the trusses hold the full weight of the rocket, rather than just reacting to side forces.

The PGM-11 Redstone rocket is a direct descendant of the V-2.

=== USSR ===

The USSR captured a number of V-2s and staff, letting them stay in Germany for a time. The first work contracts were signed in the middle of 1945. During October 1946 (as part of Operation Osoaviakhim) they were obliged to relocate to Branch 1 of NII-88 on Gorodomlya Island in Lake Seliger where Helmut Gröttrup directed a group of 150 engineers. In October 1947, a group of German scientists supported the USSR in launching rebuilt V-2s in Kapustin Yar. The German team was indirectly overseen by Sergei Korolev, one of the leaders of the Soviet rocketry program.

The first Soviet missile was the R-1, a duplicate of the V-2 manufactured completely in the USSR, which was launched first during October 1948. From 1947 until the end of 1950, the German team elaborated concepts and improvements for extended payload and range for the projects G-1, G-2 and G-4. The German team had to remain on Gorodomlya island until as late as 1952 and 1953. In parallel, Soviet work emphasized larger missiles, the R-2 and R-5, based on further developing the V-2 technology with using ideas of the German concept studies. Details of Soviet achievements were unknown to the German team and completely underestimated by Western intelligence until, in November 1957, the satellite Sputnik 1 was launched successfully to orbit by the Sputnik rocket based on R-7, the world&#x27;s first intercontinental ballistic missile.

=== France ===
Between May and September of 1946, CEPA, the forerunner to today&#x27;s French space agency CNES, undertook the recruitment of approximately thirty German engineers, who had previous experience working on rocket programs for Nazi Germany at the Peenemünde Army Research Center. Much like their counterparts in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, France&#x27;s objective was to acquire and advance the rocket technology developed by Germany during World War II. The initial initiative, known as the Super V-2 program, had plans for four rocket variants capable of achieving ranges of up to and carrying warheads weighing up to . However, this program was canceled in 1948.

From 1950 to 1969, the research done on the Super V-2 program was repurposed to develop the Véronique sounding rocket, which became the first liquid-fuel research rocket in Western Europe and was ultimately capable of carrying a payload to an altitude of . The Véronique program then led to the Diamant rocket and the Ariane rocket family.

=== UK ===

During October 1945, the Allied Operation Backfire assembled a small number of V-2 missiles and launched three of them from a site in northern Germany. The engineers involved had already agreed to relocate to the US when the test firings were complete. The Backfire report, published in January 1946, contains extensive technical documentation of the rocket, including all support procedures, tailored vehicles and fuel composition.

In 1946, the British Interplanetary Society proposed an enlarged man-carrying version of the V-2, named Megaroc. It could have enabled sub-orbital spaceflight similar to, but at least a decade earlier than, the Mercury-Redstone flights of 1961.

=== China ===
The first Chinese Dongfeng missile, the DF-1 was a licensed copy of the Soviet R-2; this design was produced during the 1960s.

<doc id="32787" wikidata="Q374" url="?curid=32787" title="Vodka">
<text>Vodka ( ; ; ) is a clear distilled alcoholic beverage. Different varieties originated in Poland, Russia, and Sweden. Vodka is composed mainly of water and ethanol but sometimes with traces of impurities and flavourings. Traditionally, it is made by distilling liquid from fermented cereal grains and potatoes since the latter was introduced in Europe in the 18th century. Some modern brands use maize, sugar cane, fruit, honey, and maple sap as the base.

Since the 1890s, standard vodkas have been 40% alcohol by volume (ABV) (80 U.S. proof). The European Union has established a minimum alcohol content of 37.5% for vodka. Vodka in the United States must have a minimum alcohol content of 40%.

Vodka is traditionally drunk &quot;neat&quot; (not mixed with water, ice, or other mixers), and it is often served freezer chilled in the vodka belt of Belarus, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, and Ukraine. It is also used in cocktails and mixed drinks, such as the vodka martini, Cosmopolitan, vodka tonic, screwdriver, greyhound, Black or White Russian, Moscow mule, Bloody Mary, Caesar and Red Bull Vodka.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;vodka&quot; is a diminutive form of the Slavic word &quot;voda&quot; (water), interpreted as &quot;waterkin&quot;: root &quot;vod&quot;- [water] + -&quot;k&quot;- (diminutive suffix, among other functions) + -&quot;a&quot; (ending of feminine gender).

In English literature, the word vodka appeared in around the late 18th century. In a book of travels published in English in 1780 (presumably, a translation from German), Johann Gottlieb Georgi correctly explained that &quot;&quot;kabak&quot; in the Russian language signifies a public house for the common people to drink &quot;vodka&quot; (a sort of brandy) in&quot;. In 1799, William Tooke glossed &quot;vodka&quot; as &quot;rectified corn-spirits&quot;, using the traditional English sense of the word &quot;corn&quot; to refer to any grain, not just maize. In 1800, French poet Théophile Gautier glossed it as a &quot;grain liquor&quot; served with meals in Poland (&quot;eau-de-vie de grain&quot;).

Another possible connection of &quot;vodka&quot; with &quot;water&quot; is the name of the medieval alcoholic beverage &quot;aqua vitae&quot; (Latin, literally, &quot;water of life&quot;), which is reflected in Polish , Ukrainian , Belarusian , and Scandinavian &quot;akvavit&quot;. Whiskey has a similar etymology, from the Irish and Scottish Gaelic &quot;uisce beatha&quot;/uisge-beatha.

People in the area of vodka&#x27;s probable origin have names for vodka with roots meaning &quot;to burn&quot;: ; ; ; ; is also in use, colloquially and in proverbs; ; . In Russian during the 17th and 18th centuries, (&quot;goryashchee vino&quot;, &quot;burning wine&quot; or &quot;hot wine&quot;) was widely used. Others languages include the German &quot;Branntwein&quot;, Danish &quot;brændevin&quot;, , , and (although the latter terms refer to any strong alcoholic beverage).

==History==

Scholars debate the beginnings of vodka because there is little historical material available. For many centuries, beverages differed significantly compared to the vodka of today, as the spirit at that time had a different flavor, color, and smell, and was originally used as medicine. It contained little alcohol, an estimated maximum of about 14%. Distillation techniques were developed in Roman Egypt by the 3rd century, but the description of &quot;aqua ardens&quot; (&quot;burning water&quot;, i.e., alcohol) made by distilling wine with salt appears in Latin works only by the 12th century. The process was well known among European medieval chemists by about 1300.

===Poland===

The world&#x27;s first written mention of the word &quot;wódka&quot; was in 1405 from &quot;Akta Grodzkie&quot; recorder of deeds, in the court documents from the Palatinate of Sandomierz in Poland. At the time, the word &quot;wódka&quot; referred to chemical compounds such as medicines and cosmetics&#x27; cleansers. The production of liquor begins in the mid-15th century, with varied local traditions emerging throughout Europe, in Poland as vodka ( or ). In the 16th century, the Polish word for the beverage was &quot;gorzałka&quot; (from the Old Polish verb &quot;gorzeć&quot; meaning &quot;to burn&quot;), which is also the source of Ukrainian (). The word written in Cyrillic appeared first in 1533, about a medicinal drink brought from Poland to Russia by the Russian merchants.

In these early days, the spirits were used mostly as medicines. Stefan Falimierz asserted in his 1534 works on herbs that vodka could serve &quot;to increase fertility and awaken lust&quot;. &quot;Wodka lub gorzałka&quot; (1614), by Jerzy Potański, contains valuable information on the production of vodka. Jakub Kazimierz Haur, in his book &quot;Skład albo skarbiec znakomitych sekretów ekonomii ziemiańskiej&quot; (&quot;A Treasury of Excellent Secrets about Landed Gentry&#x27;s Economy&quot;, Kraków, 1693), gave detailed recipes for making vodka from rye.
Some Polish vodka blends go back centuries. Most notable are &quot;Żubrówka&quot;, from about the 16th century; &quot;Goldwasser&quot;, from the early 17th century; and aged &quot;Starka&quot; vodka, from the 16th century. In the mid-17th century, the &quot;szlachta&quot; (nobility of Poland) were granted a monopoly on producing and selling vodka in their territories. This privilege was a source of substantial profits. One of the most famous distilleries of the aristocracy was established by Elżbieta Izabela Lubomirska and later operated by her grandson, Alfred Wojciech Potocki. The Vodka Industry Museum, located at the park of the Potocki country estate has an original document attesting that the distillery already existed in 1784. Today, it operates as &quot;Polmos Łańcut&quot;.

Vodka production on a much larger scale began in Poland at the end of the 16th century, initially at Kraków, whence spirits were exported to Silesia before 1550. Silesian cities also bought vodka from Poznań, a city that in 1580 had 498 working spirits distilleries. Soon, however, Gdańsk outpaced both these cities. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Polish vodka was known in the Netherlands, Denmark, England, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria and the Black Sea basin.

Early production methods were rudimentary. The beverage was usually low-proof, and the distillation process had to be repeated several times (a three-stage distillation process was common). The first distillate was called &quot;brantówka&quot;, the second was &quot;szumówka&quot;, and the third was &quot;okowita&quot; (from &quot;aqua vitae&quot;), which generally contained 70–80% ABV. Then the beverage was watered down, yielding a simple vodka (30–35% ABV), or a stronger one if the watering was done using an alembic. The exact production methods were described in 1768 by Jan Paweł Biretowski and in 1774 by Jan Chryzostom Pasek. The late 18th century inaugurated the production of vodka from various unusual substances including even the carrot.

Though there was a substantial vodka cottage industry in Poland back to the 16th century, the end of the 18th century marked the start of real industrial production of vodka in Poland (Kresy, the eastern part of Poland was controlled by the Russian empire at that time). Vodkas produced by the nobility and clergy became a mass product. The first industrial distillery was opened in 1782 in Lwów by J. A. Baczewski. He was soon followed by Jakub Haberfeld, who in 1804 established a factory at Oświęcim, and by Hartwig Kantorowicz, who started producing Wyborowa in 1823 at Poznań. The implementation of new technologies in the latter half of the 19th century, which allowed the production of clear vodkas, contributed to their success. The first rectification distillery was established in 1871. In 1925, the production of clear vodkas was made a Polish government monopoly.

After World War II, all vodka distilleries were taken over by Poland&#x27;s Marxist–Leninist government. During the martial law of the 1980s, the sale of vodka was rationed. Following the success of the Solidarity movement and the abolition of single-party rule in Poland, many distilleries began struggling financially. Some filed for bankruptcy, but many were privatized, leading to the creation of various new brands.

===Russia===
==== Russian Empire ====
A type of distilled liquor designated by the Russian word &quot;vodka&quot; came to Russia in the late 14th century. In 1386, the Genoese ambassadors brought the first &quot;aqua vitae&quot; (&quot;water of life&quot;) to Moscow and presented it to Dmitry Donskoy, the grand prince. The liquid obtained by distillation of grape must was thought to be a concentrate and a &quot;spirit&quot; of wine (&quot;spiritus vini&quot; in Latin), whence came to the name of this substance in many European languages (like English spirit, or Russian , ).

Perhaps one of the earliest terms linked to vodka production was &quot;varenoe vino&quot; (&quot;distilled wine&quot;) which appears in a 1399 document. Another term used was &quot;perevara&quot;, a precursor to vodka, which last appears in official documents in 1495. The term &quot;korchma&quot; is one of the oldest official terms used for vodka, which was used alongside &quot;varenoe vino&quot;, but later came to denote illegally produced vodka by the 16th century. Other terms that referred to vodka included &quot;goriachee vino&quot; (&quot;burning wine&quot;), &quot;zhzhenoe vino&quot; (&quot;burnt wine&quot;), and &quot;khlebnoe vino&quot; (&quot;bread wine&quot;).

According to William Pokhlyobkin, in around 1430, a monk named Isidore from the Chudov Monastery inside the Moscow Kremlin made a recipe of the first Russian vodka. Having a special knowledge and distillation devices, he became the creator of a new, higher quality type of alcoholic beverage. This &quot;bread wine&quot;, as it was initially known, was for a long time produced exclusively in the Moscow grand principality and in no other Russian principality (this situation persisted until the era of industrial production). Thus, this beverage was closely associated with Moscow. In 1474, Ivan III created the first Russian state monopoly on vodka. In 1505, the first exports of distilled Russian vodka arrived in Sweden. By the 16th century, government-run taverns known as &quot;kabaks&quot; replaced privately-run &quot;korchmas&quot;. Giles Fletcher, who was the English ambassador in Russia, wrote:
Until the mid-18th century, the drink remained relatively low in alcohol content, not exceeding 40% ABV. Multiple terms for the drink were recorded, sometimes reflecting different levels of quality, alcohol concentration, filtering, and the number of distillations; most commonly, it was referred to as &quot;burning wine&quot;, &quot;bread wine&quot;, or even in some locations simply &quot;wine&quot;. In some locations, grape wine may have been so expensive that it was a drink only for aristocrats. Burning wine was usually diluted with water to 24% ABV or less before drinking. It was mostly sold in taverns and was quite expensive. At the same time, the word &quot;vodka&quot; was already in use, but it described herbal tinctures (similar to Nalewka), containing up to 75% ABV, and made for medicinal purposes.

The first written usage of the word &quot;vodka&quot; in an official Russian document in its modern meaning is dated by the decree of Empress Elizabeth of 8 June 1751, which regulated the ownership of vodka distilleries. By the 1860s, a government policy of promoting the consumption of state-manufactured vodka made it the drink of choice for many Russians. In 1863, the government monopoly on vodka production was repealed, causing prices to plummet and making vodka available even to low-income citizens. The taxes on vodka became a key element of government finances in Tsarist Russia, providing at times up to 40% of state revenue. By 1911, vodka comprised 89% of all alcohol consumed in Russia. This level has fluctuated somewhat during the 20th century but remained quite high at all times. The most recent estimates put it at 70% (2001).

==== Post-Soviet Russia ====
Vodka remains a major source of state revenue and therefore of power. Seizing control of the state spirits monopoly Rosspirtprom and its Kristall distillery was instrumental for Vladimir Putin to consolidate his power as prime minister and president. Under his rule, the &quot;Putinka&quot; (&quot;little Putin&quot;) brand of vodka became a bestseller, partly to Putin&#x27;s financial benefit.

Other popular Russian vodka producers or brands include Stolichnaya and Russian Standard.

==== William Pokhlebin&#x27;s &quot;A History of Vodka&quot; ====
During the late 1970s, Russian culinary author William Pokhlebkin compiled a history of the production of vodka in Russia, as part of the Soviet case in a trade dispute; this was later published as &quot;A History of Vodka&quot;. Pokhlebkin wrote that while there is a wealth of publications about the history of consumption and distribution of vodka, virtually nothing had been written about vodka production. One of his assertions was that the word &quot;vodka&quot; was used in popular speech in Russia considerably earlier than the middle of the 18th century, but the word did not appear in print until the 1860s.

Pokhlebkin&#x27;s sources were challenged by David Christian in the &quot;Slavic Review&quot; in 1994, who criticized the lack of valid references in Pokhlebkin&#x27;s works and its pro-Russian bias. Pokhlebkin is also known for his Pan-Slavic sympathies under the leadership of Russia and sentiments that, in David Christian&#x27;s opinion, discredit most of his work, especially his &quot;History of Vodka&quot;.

===Sweden===
Up until the 1950s, vodka was not used as a designation for Swedish distilled beverages, which were instead called &quot;brännvin&quot; (&quot;burn-wine&quot;), the word having the same etymology as the Dutch &quot;Brandewijn&quot;, which is the base for the word brandy. This beverage has been produced in Sweden since the late 15th century, although the total production was still small in the 17th century. From the early 18th century, production expanded, although production was prohibited several times, during grain shortages. Although initially a grain product, potatoes started to be used in production in the late 18th century and became dominant from the early 19th century. From the early 1870s, distillery equipment was improved.

Progressively from the 1960s, unflavoured Swedish &quot;brännvin&quot; also came to be called vodka. The first Swedish product to use this term was Explorer Vodka, which was created in 1958 and initially was intended for the American export market. Although it ultimately failed in that market, it remains one of the most popular vodka brands in Sweden today. In 1979, Absolut Vodka was launched, reusing the name of the old &quot;Absolut Rent Brännvin&quot; (&quot;absolutely pure &quot;brännvin&quot;&quot;) created in 1879.

After Sweden joined the European Union in 1995, the regulations were changed so that privately owned companies could produce Vodka.

Vodka has become popular among young people, with a flourishing black market. In 2013, the organizers of the so-called &quot;vodka car&quot; were jailed for two and a half years for having illegally provided thousands of liters to young people, some as young as 13.

==Production==
Vodka may be distilled from any starch- or sugar-rich plant matter; most vodka today is produced from grains such as sorghum, corn, rye, or wheat. Among grain vodkas, rye and wheat vodkas are generally considered superior. Some vodkas are made from potatoes, molasses, soybeans, grapes, rice, sugar beets and sometimes even byproducts of oil refining or wood pulp processing. In some Central European countries, such as Poland, some vodka is produced by just fermenting a solution of crystal sugar and yeast. In the European Union, there are talks about the standardization of vodka, and the Vodka Belt countries insist that only spirits produced from grains, potato, and sugar beet molasses be allowed to be branded as &quot;vodka&quot;, following the traditional methods of production.

In the United States, many vodkas are made from 95% pure grain alcohol produced in large quantities by agricultural-industrial giants Archer Daniels Midland, Grain Processing Corporation, and Midwest Grain Products (MGP). Bottlers purchase the base spirits in bulk, then filter, dilute, distribute and market the end product under a variety of vodka brand names. Similar methods are used in other regions such as Europe.

This pure grain alcohol, also known as &quot;rectified spirit&quot;, &quot;neutral spirit&quot;, or &quot;ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin&quot;, is also available directly to consumers in some areas, as products such as Everclear, Polmos &quot;spirytus rektyfikowany&quot;, and others. In contrast to very high ABV vodkas such as the Bulgarian &quot;Balkan 176°&quot; with 88% ABV, these grain alcohol products are not considered vodka; they have not (yet) gone through the filtration and refining process used to produce vodka.

A study conducted on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Planet Money&quot; podcast revealed negligible differences in taste between various brands of vodka, leading to speculation as to how much branding contributes to the concept of &quot;super-premium vodkas&quot;.

===Distilling and filtering===

A common property of the vodkas produced in the United States and Europe is the extensive use of filtration before any additional processing including the addition of flavorants. Filtering is sometimes done in the still during distillation, as well as afterward, where the distilled vodka is filtered through activated charcoal and other media to absorb trace amounts of substances that alter or impart off-flavors to the vodka. However, this is not the case in the traditional vodka-producing nations, so many distillers from these countries prefer to use very accurate distillation but minimal filtering, thus preserving the unique flavors and characteristics of their products.

The master distiller is in charge of distilling the vodka and directing its filtration, which includes the removal of the &quot;fore-shots&quot;, &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot;. These components of the distillate contain flavor compounds such as ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate (heads) as well as the fusel oils (tails) that impact the usually desired clean taste of vodka. Through numerous rounds of distillation, or the use of a fractioning still, the taste is modified and clarity is increased. In contrast, the distillery process for liquors such as whiskey, rum, and baijiu allow portions of the &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot; to remain, giving them their unique flavors.

Repeated distillation of vodka will make its ethanol level much higher than is acceptable to most end users, whether legislation determines strength limits or not. Depending on the distillation method and the technique of the still master, the final filtered and distilled vodka may have as much as 95–96% ethanol. As such, most vodka is diluted with water before bottling.

===Flavoring===

While most vodkas are unflavored, many flavored vodkas have been produced in traditional vodka-drinking areas, often as home-made recipes to improve vodka&#x27;s taste or for medicinal purposes. Flavorings include red pepper, ginger, fruit flavors, vanilla, chocolate (without sweetener), and cinnamon. In Russia, vodka flavored with honey and pepper, &quot;pertsovka&quot; in Russian, is also very popular. In Poland and Belarus, the leaves of the local bison grass are added to produce &quot;żubrówka&quot; (Polish) and &quot;zubrovka&quot; (Belarusian) vodka, with slightly sweet flavors and light amber colors. In Lithuania and Poland, a famous vodka containing honey is called &quot;krupnik&quot;.

This tradition of flavoring is also prevalent in the Nordic countries, where vodka seasoned with herbs, fruits, and spices is the appropriate strong drink for several seasonal festivities. Sweden has forty-odd common varieties of herb-flavored vodka (&quot;kryddat brännvin&quot;). In Poland and Ukraine, a separate category ( in Ukraine and &quot;nalewka&quot; in Poland) is used for vodka-based spirits with fruit, root, flower, or herb extracts, which are often home-made or produced by small commercial distilleries. Their alcohol contents vary between 15 and 75%. In Estonia, vodkas are available with barberry, blackcurrant, cherry, green apple, lemon, vanilla, and watermelon flavors.

In most cases, vodka flavoring comes from a post-distillation infusion of flavors. Through the fermentation process, grain mash is transformed into a neutral alcohol beverage that is unflavored. The process of flavoring vodka so that it tastes like fruits, chocolate, and other foods occurs after fermentation and distillation. Various chemicals that reproduce the flavor profiles of foods are added into vodka to give it a specific taste.

==Today==
Vodka is less likely than other spirits to produce the undesirable aftereffects of heavy consumption
(though no less likely to intoxicate) because of its low level of fusel oils and congeners, which are impurities that flavor spirits.

Since the year 2000, because of evolving consumer tastes and regulatory changes, several &#x27;artisanal vodka&#x27; or even &#x27;ultra premium vodka&#x27; brands have appeared.

===European Union regulation===
The success of grape-based vodka in the United States in the early twenty-first century prompted traditional vodka producers in the Vodka Belt countries of Poland, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Sweden to campaign for EU legislation that would define &quot;vodka&quot; as only spirits made from grain or potatoes. This proposition provoked heavy criticism from South European countries, which often distill used mash from wine-making into spirits; although higher-quality mash is usually distilled into some variety of pomace brandy, the lower-quality mash is better turned into neutral-flavored spirits instead. Any vodka not made from either grain or potatoes would have to display the products used in its production. This regulation entered into force in 2008.

===Canadian regulations===
Under Canadian regulations, vodka is a potable alcoholic distillate obtained from potatoes, cereal grain, or any other material of agricultural origin fermented by the action of yeast or a mixture of yeast and other microorganisms.

===United States regulations===
In 1956, it was put into revenue ruling that sugar not more than 0.2% and trace amounts of citric acid are not considered flavoring agent. The meaning of &quot;trace amounts&quot; of citric acid was clarified as not more than 1,000ppm in 1995.

It is no longer defined as &quot;to be without distinctive character, aroma, taste, or color.&quot; The law includes other requirements: Vodka cannot be aged in wood; it may or may not be charcoal filtered; and it must meet minimum distillation and bottling proofs.

== Boycotts ==

In summer 2013, American LGBT rights activists targeted Russian vodka brands for boycott over Russia&#x27;s anti-gay policies.

In late February 2022, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, some North American liquor stores and bars expressed symbolic solidarity with Ukraine, and opposition to Russia, by boycotting Russian vodka brands.

One critic argued that boycotts of Russian-branded vodka may inadvertently affect U.S. vodka manufacturers and noted that only 1.2 percent of U.S. vodka imports come from Russia.

==Illegal production==
In some countries, black-market or &quot;bathtub&quot; vodka is widespread because it can be produced easily and avoids taxation. However, severe poisoning, blindness, or death can occur as a result of dangerous industrial ethanol substitutes being added by black-market producers. In March 2007 in a documentary, BBC News UK sought to find the cause of severe jaundice among imbibers of a &quot;bathtub&quot; vodka in Russia. The cause was suspected to be an industrial disinfectant (Extrasept)—95% ethanol but also containing a highly toxic chemical—added to the vodka by the illegal traders because of its high alcohol content and low price. Death toll estimates list at least 120 dead and more than 1,000 poisoned. The death toll is expected to rise due to the chronic nature of the cirrhosis that is causing jaundice.

==Public health effects==

Estimates of the annual death toll resulting from vodka consumption extend up to the thousands in Russia.

== Cooking ==

Vodka can also be used in cooking and various recipes are improved by the addition of vodka or rely on it as a key ingredient. Vodka sauce is a pasta sauce made from tomato sauce, cream, and vodka that gained popularity in the 1970s. Vodka can be used in baking as a substitute for water: pie crusts can be made flakier with vodka. It may be used in seafood dishes, cheesecake, or bitters.

<text>Vivien Leigh ( ; born Vivian Mary Hartley; 5 November 1913 – 8 July 1967), styled as Lady Olivier after 1947, was a British actress. After completing her drama school education, Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed to the role of heroine in &quot;Fire Over England&quot; (1937). She then won the Academy Award for Best Actress twice, for her performances as Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) and Blanche DuBois in the film version of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1951), a role she had also played on stage in London&#x27;s West End in 1949. She also won a Tony Award for her work in the Broadway musical version of &quot;Tovarich&quot; (1963). 

Despite her fame as a screen actress, Leigh was primarily a stage performer. During her 30-year career, she played roles ranging from the heroines of Noël Coward and George Bernard Shaw comedies to classic Shakespearean characters such as Ophelia, Cleopatra, Juliet and Lady Macbeth. Later in life, she performed as a character actress in a few films. Although her career had periods of inactivity, in 1999 the American Film Institute ranked Leigh as the 16th-greatest female movie star of classic Hollywood cinema. Also lauded for her beauty, Leigh felt that her physical attributes sometimes prevented her from being taken seriously as an actress. 

At the time, the public strongly identified Leigh with her second husband, Laurence Olivier, who was her spouse from 1940 to 1960. Leigh and Olivier starred together in many stage productions, with Olivier often directing, and in three films. She earned a reputation for being difficult to work with, and for much of her life she had bipolar disorder, as well as recurrent bouts of chronic tuberculosis, which was first diagnosed in the mid-1940s and ultimately led to her death at age 53.

== Life and career ==
=== 1913–1934: Early life and acting debut ===
Leigh was born Vivian Mary Hartley on 5 November 1913 in British India on the campus of St. Paul&#x27;s School in Darjeeling, Bengal Presidency. She was the only child of Ernest Richard Hartley, a British broker, and his wife, Gertrude Mary Frances (née Yackjee; she also used her mother&#x27;s maiden name of Robinson). Her father was born in Scotland in 1882, while her mother, a devout Catholic, was born in Darjeeling in 1888 and might have been of Irish, Parsi Indian, and Armenian ancestry. Gertrude&#x27;s parents, who lived in India, were Michael John Yackjee, an Anglo-Indian man of independent means, and Mary Teresa Robinson, who was born to an Irish family killed during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and grew up in an orphanage, where she met Yackjee; they married in 1872 and had five children, of whom Gertrude was the youngest. Ernest and Gertrude Hartley were married in 1912 in Kensington, London.

In 1917, Ernest Hartley was transferred to Bangalore as an officer in the Indian Cavalry, while Gertrude and Vivian stayed in Ootacamund. At the age of three, Vivian made her first stage appearance for her mother&#x27;s amateur theatre group, reciting &quot;Little Bo Peep&quot;. Gertrude Hartley tried to instill an appreciation of literature in her daughter and introduced her to the works of Hans Christian Andersen, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, as well as stories of Greek mythology and Indian folklore. At the age of six, Vivian was sent by her mother from Loreto Convent, Darjeeling, to the Convent of the Sacred Heart (now Woldingham School) then situated in Roehampton, south-west London. One of her friends there was future actress Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan, two years her senior, to whom Vivian expressed her desire to become &quot;a great actress&quot;. She was removed from the school by her father, and travelling with her parents for four years, she attended schools in Europe, notably in Dinard (Brittany, France), Biarritz (France), the Sacred Heart in San Remo on the Italian Riviera, and in Paris, becoming fluent in both French and Italian. The family returned to Britain in 1931. She attended &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot;, one of O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s films playing in London&#x27;s West End, and told her parents of her ambitions to become an actress. Shortly after, her father enrolled Vivian at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London.

Vivian met Herbert Leigh Holman, known as Leigh Holman, a barrister 13 years her senior, in 1931. Despite his disapproval of &quot;theatrical people&quot;, they married on 20 December 1932 and she terminated her studies at RADA, her attendance and interest in acting having already waned after meeting Holman. On 12 October 1933 in London, she gave birth to a daughter, Suzanne, later Suzanne Farrington.

=== 1935–1939: Early career and Laurence Olivier ===
Leigh&#x27;s friends suggested she take a minor role as a schoolgirl in the film &quot;Things Are Looking Up&quot;, which was her film debut, albeit uncredited as an extra. She engaged an agent, John Gliddon, who believed that &quot;Vivian Holman&quot; was not a suitable name for an actress. After rejecting his many suggestions, she took &quot;Vivian Leigh&quot; as her professional name. Gliddon recommended her to Alexander Korda as a possible film actress, but Korda rejected her as lacking potential. She was cast in the play &quot;The Mask of Virtue&quot;, directed by Sydney Carroll in 1935, and received excellent reviews, followed by interviews and newspaper articles. One such article was from the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, in which the interviewer noted that &quot;a lightning change came over her face&quot;, which was the first public mention of the rapid changes in mood that had become characteristic of her. John Betjeman, future poet laureate, described her as &quot;the essence of English girlhood&quot;. Korda attended her opening night performance, admitted his error, and signed her to a film contract. She continued with the play but, when Korda moved it to a larger theatre, Leigh was found to be unable to project her voice adequately or to hold the attention of so large an audience, and the play closed soon after. In the playbill, Carroll had revised the spelling of her first name to &quot;Vivien&quot;.

In 1960, Leigh recalled her ambivalence towards her first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting that &quot;some critics saw fit to be as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn&#x27;t able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him.&quot;

In the autumn of 1935 and at Leigh&#x27;s insistence, John Buckmaster introduced her to Laurence Olivier at the Savoy Grill, where he and his first wife Jill Esmond dined regularly after his performance in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Olivier had seen Leigh in &quot;The Mask of Virtue&quot; earlier in May and congratulated her on her performance. Olivier and Leigh began an affair while acting as lovers in &quot;Fire Over England&quot; (1937), while Olivier was still married to Esmond and Leigh to Holman. During this period, Leigh read the Margaret Mitchell novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and instructed her American agent to recommend her to David O. Selznick, who was planning a film version. She remarked to a journalist, &quot;I&#x27;ve cast myself as Scarlett O&#x27;Hara&quot;, and &quot;The Observer&quot; film critic C. A. Lejeune recalled a conversation of the same period in which Leigh &quot;stunned us all&quot; with the assertion that Olivier &quot;won&#x27;t play Rhett Butler, but I shall play Scarlett O&#x27;Hara. Wait and see.&quot;

Despite her relative inexperience, Leigh was chosen to play Ophelia to Olivier&#x27;s Hamlet in an Old Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, Denmark. Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space. She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had returned to normal with no recollection of the event. It was the first time Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.

Leigh appeared with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan in &quot;A Yank at Oxford&quot; (1938), which was the first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends. After dealing with the threat of a lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in &quot;Sidewalks of London&quot;, also known as &quot;St. Martin&#x27;s Lane&quot; (1938), with Charles Laughton.

Olivier had been attempting to broaden his film career. He was not well known in the United States despite his success in Britain, and earlier attempts to introduce him to American audiences had failed. Offered the role of Heathcliff in Samuel Goldwyn&#x27;s production of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1939), he travelled to Hollywood, leaving Leigh in London. Goldwyn and the film&#x27;s director, William Wyler, offered Leigh the secondary role of Isabella, but she refused, preferring the role of Cathy, which went to Merle Oberon.

=== 1939: &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; ===
Hollywood was in the midst of a widely publicised search to find an actress to portray Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in David O. Selznick&#x27;s production of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939). At the time, Myron Selznick—David&#x27;s brother and Leigh&#x27;s American theatrical agent—was the London representative of the Myron Selznick Agency. In February 1938, Leigh asked Myron that she be considered to play the part of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara.

David O. Selznick watched her performances that month in &quot;Fire Over England&quot; and &quot;A Yank at Oxford&quot; and thought that she was excellent but in no way a possible Scarlett because she was &quot;too British&quot;. Leigh travelled to Los Angeles, however, to be with Olivier and to try to convince David Selznick that she was the right person for the part. Myron Selznick also represented Olivier and when he met Leigh, he felt that she possessed the qualities that his brother was searching for. According to legend, Myron Selznick took Leigh and Olivier to the set where the burning of the Atlanta Depot scene was being filmed and stage-managed an encounter, where he introduced Leigh, derisively addressing his younger brother, &quot;Hey, genius, meet your Scarlett O&#x27;Hara.&quot; The following day, Leigh read a scene for Selznick, who organized a screen test with director George Cukor and wrote to his wife, &quot;She&#x27;s the Scarlett dark horse and looks damn good. Not for anyone&#x27;s ear but your own: it&#x27;s narrowed down to Paulette Goddard, Jean Arthur, Joan Bennett and Vivien Leigh&quot;. The director, George Cukor, concurred and praised Leigh&#x27;s &quot;incredible wildness&quot;. She secured the role of Scarlett soon after.
Filming proved difficult for Leigh. Cukor was dismissed and replaced by Victor Fleming, with whom Leigh frequently quarrelled. She and Olivia de Havilland secretly met with Cukor at night and on weekends for his advice about how they should play their parts. Leigh befriended Clark Gable, his wife Carole Lombard and Olivia de Havilland, but she clashed with Leslie Howard, with whom she was required to play several emotional scenes. Leigh was sometimes required to work seven days a week, often late into the night, which added to her distress, and she missed Olivier, who was working in New York City. On a long-distance telephone call to Olivier, she declared: &quot;Puss, my puss, how I hate film acting! Hate, hate, and never want to do another film again!&quot;

Quoted in a 2006 biography of Olivier, Olivia de Havilland defended Leigh against claims of her manic behaviour during the filming of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;: &quot;Vivien was impeccably professional, impeccably disciplined on &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. She had two great concerns: doing her best work in an extremely difficult role and being separated from Larry [Olivier], who was in New York.&quot;

&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; brought Leigh immediate attention and fame, but she was quoted as saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not a film star—I&#x27;m an actress. Being a film star—just a film star—is such a false life, lived for fake values and for publicity. Actresses go on for a long time and there are always marvellous parts to play.&quot; The film won 10 Academy Awards including a Best Actress award for Leigh, who also won a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.

=== 1940–1949: Marriage and early collaborations with Olivier ===
In February 1940, Jill Esmond agreed to divorce Laurence Olivier, and Leigh Holman agreed to divorce Vivien, although they maintained a strong friendship for the rest of Leigh&#x27;s life. Esmond was granted custody of Tarquin, her son with Olivier. Holman was granted custody of Suzanne, his daughter with Leigh. On 31 August 1940, Olivier and Leigh were married at the San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara, California, in a ceremony attended only by their hosts, Ronald and Benita Colman and witnesses, Katharine Hepburn and Garson Kanin. Leigh had made a screen test and hoped to co-star with Olivier in &quot;Rebecca&quot;, which was to be directed by Alfred Hitchcock with Olivier in the leading role. After viewing Leigh&#x27;s screen test, David Selznick noted that &quot;she doesn&#x27;t seem right as to sincerity or age or innocence&quot;, a view shared by Hitchcock and Leigh&#x27;s mentor, George Cukor.

Selznick observed that she had shown no enthusiasm for the part until Olivier had been confirmed as the lead actor, so he cast Joan Fontaine. He refused to allow her to join Olivier in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1940), and Greer Garson played the role Leigh had wanted for herself. &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; (1940) was to have starred Olivier and Leigh; however, Selznick replaced Olivier with Robert Taylor, then at the peak of his success as one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s most popular male stars. Her top billing reflected her status in Hollywood, and the film was popular with audiences and critics.

The Oliviers mounted a stage production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for Broadway. The New York press publicised the adulterous nature of the beginning of Olivier and Leigh&#x27;s relationship and questioned their ethics in not returning to the UK to help with the war effort. Critics were hostile in their assessment of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Brooks Atkinson for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Although Miss Leigh and Mr. Olivier are handsome young people, they hardly act their parts at all.&quot; While most of the blame was attributed to Olivier&#x27;s acting and direction, Leigh was also criticised, with Bernard Grebanier commenting on the &quot;thin, shopgirl quality of Miss Leigh&#x27;s voice&quot;. The couple had invested almost all of their combined savings of $40,000 () in the project, and the failure was a financial disaster for them.

The Oliviers filmed &quot;That Hamilton Woman&quot; (1941) with Olivier as Horatio Nelson and Leigh as Emma Hamilton. With the United States not yet having entered the war, it was one of several Hollywood films made with the aim of arousing a pro-British sentiment among American audiences. The film was popular in the United States and an outstanding success in the Soviet Union. Winston Churchill arranged a screening for a party that included Franklin D. Roosevelt and, on its conclusion, addressed the group, saying, &quot;Gentlemen, I thought this film would interest you, showing great events similar to those in which you have just been taking part.&quot; The Oliviers remained favourites of Churchill, attending dinners and occasions at his request for the rest of his life; and, of Leigh, he was quoted as saying, &quot;By Jove, she&#x27;s a clinker.&quot;

The Oliviers returned to Britain in March 1943, and Leigh toured through North Africa that same year as part of a revue for the armed forces stationed in the region. She reportedly turned down a studio contract worth $5,000 a week () in order to volunteer as part of the war effort. Leigh performed for troops before falling ill with a persistent cough and fevers. In 1944, she was diagnosed as having tuberculosis in her left lung and spent several weeks in hospital before appearing to have recovered. Leigh was filming &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (1945) when she discovered she was pregnant, then had a miscarriage. Leigh temporarily fell into a deep depression that hit its low point with her falling to the floor, sobbing in a hysterical fit. This was the first of many major bipolar disorder breakdowns. Olivier later came to recognise the symptoms of an impending episode—several days of hyperactivity followed by a period of depression and an explosive breakdown, after which Leigh would have no memory of the event, but would be acutely embarrassed and remorseful.

With her doctor&#x27;s approval, Leigh was well enough to resume acting in 1946, starring in a successful London production of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;; but her films of this period, &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (1945) and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1948), were not great commercial successes. All British films in this period were adversely affected by a Hollywood boycott of British films. In 1947, Olivier was knighted and Leigh accompanied him to Buckingham Palace for the investiture. She became Lady Olivier. After their divorce, according to the style granted to the divorced wife of a knight, she became known socially as Vivien, Lady Olivier.

By 1948, Olivier was on the board of directors for the Old Vic Theatre, and he and Leigh embarked on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand to raise funds for the theatre. Olivier played the lead in &quot;Richard III&quot; and also performed with Leigh in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; and &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;. The tour was an outstanding success and, although Leigh was plagued with insomnia and allowed her understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill, she generally withstood the demands placed upon her, with Olivier noting her ability to &quot;charm the press&quot;. Members of the company later recalled several quarrels between the couple as Olivier was increasingly resentful of the demands placed on him during the tour. The most dramatic altercation occurred in Christchurch, New Zealand, when her shoes were not found and Leigh refused to go onstage without them. Olivier screamed an obscenity at her and slapped her face, and a devastated Leigh slapped him in return, dismayed that he would hit her publicly. Subsequently, she made her way to the stage in borrowed pumps, and in seconds, had &quot;dried her tears and smiled brightly onstage&quot;. By the end of the tour, both were exhausted and ill. Olivier told a journalist, &quot;You may not know it, but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses.&quot; Later, he would observe that he &quot;lost Vivien&quot; in Australia.

The success of the tour encouraged the Oliviers to make their first West End appearance together, performing the same works with one addition, &quot;Antigone,&quot; included at Leigh&#x27;s insistence because she wished to play a role in a tragedy.

=== 1949–1951: Play and film roles in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; ===
Leigh next sought the role of Blanche DuBois in the West End stage production of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; and was cast after Williams and the play&#x27;s producer Irene Mayer Selznick saw her in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; and &quot;Antigone&quot;; Olivier was contracted to direct. The play contained a rape scene and references to promiscuity and homosexuality, and was destined to be controversial; the media discussion about its suitability added to Leigh&#x27;s anxiety. Nevertheless, she believed strongly in the importance of the work.

When the West End production of &quot;Streetcar&quot; opened in October 1949, J. B. Priestley denounced the play and Leigh&#x27;s performance; and the critic Kenneth Tynan, who was to make a habit of dismissing her stage performances, commented that Leigh was badly miscast because British actors were &quot;too well-bred to emote effectively on stage&quot;. Olivier and Leigh were chagrined that part of the commercial success of the play lay in audience members attending to see what they believed would be a salacious story, rather than the Greek tragedy that they envisioned. The play also had strong supporters, among them Noël Coward, who described Leigh as &quot;magnificent&quot;.

After 326 performances, Leigh finished her run, and she was soon assigned to reprise her role as Blanche DuBois in the film version of the play. Her irreverent and often bawdy sense of humour allowed her to establish a rapport with Marlon Brando, but she had an initial difficulty in working with director Elia Kazan, who was displeased with the direction that Olivier had taken in shaping the character of Blanche. Kazan had favoured Jessica Tandy and later, Olivia de Havilland over Leigh, but knew she had been a success on the London stage as Blanche. He later commented that he did not hold her in high regard as an actress, believing that &quot;she had a small talent.&quot; As work progressed, however, he became &quot;full of admiration&quot; for &quot;the greatest determination to excel of any actress I&#x27;ve known. She&#x27;d have crawled over broken glass if she thought it would help her performance.&quot; Leigh found the role gruelling and commented to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;I had nine months in the theatre of Blanche DuBois. Now she&#x27;s in command of me.&quot; Olivier accompanied her to Hollywood where he was to co-star with Jennifer Jones in William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;Carrie&quot; (1952).

Leigh&#x27;s performance in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; won glowing reviews, as well as a second Academy Award for Best Actress, a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award for Best British Actress, and a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. Tennessee Williams commented that Leigh brought to the role &quot;everything that I intended, and much that I had never dreamed of&quot;. Leigh herself had mixed feelings about her association with the character; in later years, she said that playing Blanche DuBois &quot;tipped me over into madness&quot;.

=== 1951–1960: Struggle with mental illness ===
In 1951 in London, Leigh and Laurence Olivier performed two plays about Cleopatra, William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; and George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;, alternating the play each night and winning good reviews. They took the productions to New York, where they performed a season at the Ziegfeld Theatre into 1952. The reviews there were also mostly positive, but film critic Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh&#x27;s was a mediocre talent that forced Olivier to compromise his own. Tynan&#x27;s diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure and intent on achieving greatness, dwelt on his comments and ignored the positive reviews of other critics.

In January 1953, Leigh travelled to Ceylon to film &quot;Elephant Walk&quot; with Peter Finch. Shortly after filming commenced, she had a nervous breakdown and Paramount Pictures replaced her with Elizabeth Taylor. Olivier returned her to their home in Britain, where, between periods of incoherence, Leigh told him she was in love with Finch and had been having an affair with him. Over a period of several months, she gradually recovered. As a result of this episode, many of the Oliviers&#x27; friends learned of her problems. David Niven said she had been &quot;quite, quite mad&quot;. Noël Coward expressed surprise in his diary that &quot;things had been bad and getting worse since 1948 or thereabouts&quot;. Leigh&#x27;s romantic relationship with Finch began in 1948, and waxed and waned for several years, ultimately flickering out as her mental condition deteriorated.

Also in 1953, Leigh recovered sufficiently to play &quot;The Sleeping Prince&quot; with Olivier, and in 1955 they performed a season at Stratford-upon-Avon in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;. They played to capacity houses and attracted generally good reviews, with Leigh&#x27;s health seemingly stable. John Gielgud directed &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and wrote, &quot;... perhaps I will still make a good thing of that divine play, especially if he will let me pull her little ladyship (who is brainier than he but &quot;not&quot; a born actress) out of her timidity and safeness. He dares too confidently ... but she hardly dares at all and is terrified of overreaching her technique and doing anything that she has not killed the spontaneity of by overpractice.&quot; In 1955, Leigh starred in Anatole Litvak&#x27;s film &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot;; co-star Kenneth More felt he had poor chemistry with Leigh during the filming.

In 1956, Leigh took the lead role in the Noël Coward play &quot;South Sea Bubble&quot;, but withdrew from the production when she became pregnant. Several weeks later, she miscarried and entered a period of depression that lasted for months. She joined Olivier for a European tour of &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, but the tour was marred by Leigh&#x27;s frequent outbursts against Olivier and other members of the company. After their return to London, her former husband, Leigh Holman, who could still exert a strong influence on her, stayed with the Oliviers and helped calm her.

In 1959, when she achieved a success with the Noël Coward comedy &quot;Look After Lulu!&quot;, a critic working for &quot;The Times&quot; described her as &quot;beautiful, delectably cool and matter of fact, she is mistress of every situation&quot;.

Considering her marriage to be over, Leigh began a relationship with actor John Merivale in 1960, who knew of Leigh&#x27;s medical condition and assured Olivier that he would care for her. That same year, she and Olivier divorced and Olivier soon married actress Joan Plowright. In his autobiography, Olivier discussed the years of strain they had experienced because of Leigh&#x27;s illness: &quot;Throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster, manic depression, with its deadly ever-tightening spirals, she retained her own individual canniness—an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me, for whom she could hardly be expected to take the trouble.&quot;

=== 1961–1967: Final years and death ===
Merivale proved to be a stabilising influence for Leigh, but despite her apparent contentment, she was quoted by Radie Harris as confiding that she &quot;would rather have lived a short life with Larry [Olivier] than face a long one without him&quot;. Her first husband Leigh Holman also spent considerable time with her. Merivale joined her for a tour of Australia, New Zealand and Latin America that lasted from July 1961 until May 1962, and Leigh enjoyed positive reviews without sharing the spotlight with Olivier. Though she was still beset by bouts of depression, she continued to work in the theatre and, in 1963, won a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her role in &quot;Tovarich&quot;. She also appeared in the films &quot;The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone&quot; (1961) and &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; (1965).

Leigh&#x27;s last screen appearance in &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; was both a triumph and emblematic of her illnesses that were taking root. Producer and director Stanley Kramer, who ended up with the film, planned to star Leigh but was initially unaware of her fragile mental and physical state. Later recounting her work, Kramer remembered her courage in taking on the difficult role, &quot;She was ill, and the courage to go ahead, the courage to make the film—was almost unbelievable.&quot; Leigh&#x27;s performance was tinged by paranoia and resulted in outbursts that marred her relationship with other actors, although both Simone Signoret and Lee Marvin were sympathetic and understanding. In one unusual instance during the attempted rape scene, Leigh became distraught and hit Marvin so hard with a spiked shoe that it marked his face. Leigh won the &quot;L&#x27;Étoile de Cristal&quot; for her performance in a leading role in &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;.

In May 1967, Leigh was rehearsing to appear with Michael Redgrave in Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot; when her tuberculosis resurfaced. Following several weeks of rest, she seemed to recover. On the night of 7 July 1967, Merivale left her as usual at their Eaton Square flat to perform in a play, and he returned home just before midnight to find her asleep. About 30 minutes later (by now 8 July), he entered the bedroom and discovered her body on the floor. She had been attempting to walk to the bathroom and, as her lungs filled with liquid, she collapsed and suffocated. Merivale first contacted her family and later was able to reach Olivier, who was receiving treatment for prostate cancer in a nearby hospital. In his autobiography, Olivier described his &quot;grievous anguish&quot; as he immediately travelled to Leigh&#x27;s residence, to find that Merivale had moved her body onto the bed. Olivier paid his respects, and &quot;stood and prayed for forgiveness for all the evils that had sprung up between us&quot;, before helping Merivale make funeral arrangements; Olivier stayed until her body was removed from the flat.

Her death was publicly announced on 8 July, and the lights of every theatre in central London were extinguished for an hour. A Catholic service for Leigh was held at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Cadogan Street, London. Her funeral was attended by the luminaries of British stage and screen. According to the provisions of her will, Leigh was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium and her ashes were scattered on the lake at her summer home, Tickerage Mill, near Blackboys, East Sussex, England. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, with a final tribute read by John Gielgud. In 1968, Leigh became the first actress honoured in the United States by &quot;The Friends of the Libraries at the University of Southern California&quot;. The ceremony was conducted as a memorial service, with selections from her films shown and tributes provided by such associates as George Cukor, who screened the tests that Leigh had made for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, the first time the screen tests had been seen in 30 years.

== Artistry and legacy ==

Leigh was considered to be one of the most beautiful actresses of her day, and her directors emphasised this in most of her films. When asked if she believed her beauty had been an impediment to being taken seriously as an actress, she said, &quot;People think that if you look fairly reasonable, you can&#x27;t possibly act, and as I only care about acting, I think beauty can be a great handicap, if you really want to look like the part you&#x27;re playing, which isn&#x27;t necessarily like you.&quot;

Director George Cukor described Leigh as a &quot;consummate actress, hampered by beauty&quot;, and Laurence Olivier said that critics should &quot;give her credit for being an actress and not go on forever letting their judgments be distorted by her great beauty.&quot; Garson Kanin shared their viewpoint and described Leigh as &quot;a stunner whose ravishing beauty often tended to obscure her staggering achievements as an actress. Great beauties are infrequently great actresses—simply because they don&#x27;t need to be. Vivien was different; ambitious, persevering, serious, often inspired.&quot;

Leigh explained that she played &quot;as many different parts as possible&quot; in an attempt to learn her craft and to dispel prejudice about her abilities. She believed that comedy was more difficult to play than drama because it required more precise timing and said that more emphasis should be placed upon comedy as part of an actor&#x27;s training. Nearing the end of her career, which ranged from Noël Coward comedies to Shakespearean tragedies, she observed, &quot;It&#x27;s much easier to make people cry than to make them laugh.&quot;

Her early performances brought her immediate success in Britain, but she remained largely unknown in other parts of the world until the release of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. In December 1939, film critic Frank Nugent wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Miss Leigh&#x27;s Scarlett has vindicated the absurd talent quest that indirectly turned her up. She is so perfectly designed for the part by art and nature that any other actress in the role would be inconceivable&quot;, and as her fame escalated, she was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine as Scarlett. In 1969, critic Andrew Sarris commented that the success of the film had been largely due to &quot;the inspired casting&quot; of Leigh, and in 1998, wrote that &quot;she lives in our minds and memories as a dynamic force rather than as a static presence&quot;. Film historian and critic Leonard Maltin described the film as one of the all-time greats, writing in 1998 that Leigh &quot;brilliantly played&quot; her role.

Her performance in the West End production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, described by the theatre writer Phyllis Hartnoll as &quot;proof of greater powers as an actress than she had hitherto shown&quot;, led to a lengthy period during which she was considered one of the finest actresses in British theatre. Discussing the subsequent film version, Pauline Kael wrote that Leigh and Marlon Brando gave &quot;two of the greatest performances ever put on film&quot; and that Leigh&#x27;s was &quot;one of those rare performances that can truly be said to evoke both fear and pity.&quot;

Her greatest critic was Kenneth Tynan who ridiculed Leigh&#x27;s performance opposite Olivier in the 1955 production of &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, commenting that she &quot;receives the news that she is about to be ravished on her husband&#x27;s corpse with little more than the mild annoyance of one who would have preferred foam rubber.&quot; He was also critical of her reinterpretation of Lady Macbeth in 1955, saying that her performance was insubstantial and lacked the necessary fury demanded of the role. After her death, however, Tynan revised his opinion, describing his earlier criticism as &quot;one of the worst errors of judgment&quot; he had ever made. He came to believe that Leigh&#x27;s interpretation, in which Lady Macbeth uses her sexual allure to keep Macbeth enthralled, &quot;made more sense ... than the usual battle-axe&quot; portrayal of the character. In a survey of theatre critics conducted shortly after Leigh&#x27;s death, several named her performance as Lady Macbeth as one of her greatest achievements in theatre.

Leigh was portrayed by American actress Morgan Brittany in &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (1975), &quot;Gable and Lombard&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Scarlett O&#x27;Hara War&quot; (1980). English actress Julia Ormond played Leigh in &quot;My Week with Marilyn&quot; (2011). Leigh was also portrayed by Katie McGuinness in the Netflix miniseries &quot;Hollywood&quot; (2020).

In 1969, a plaque to Leigh was placed in the Actors&#x27; Church, St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, London. In 1985, a portrait of her was included in a series of United Kingdom postage stamps, along with Alfred Hitchcock, Charlie Chaplin, Peter Sellers and David Niven to commemorate &quot;British Film Year&quot;. In April 1996, she appeared in the Centenary of Cinema stamp issue (with Sir Laurence Olivier) and in April 2013 was again included in another series, this time celebrating the 100th anniversary of her birth. The British Library in London purchased the papers of Olivier from his estate in 1999. Known as &quot;The Laurence Olivier Archive&quot;, the collection includes many of Leigh&#x27;s personal papers, including numerous letters she wrote to Olivier. The papers of Leigh, including letters, photographs, contracts and diaries, were owned by her daughter, Suzanne Farrington. (Farrington died in 2015.) In 1994, the National Library of Australia purchased a photograph album, monogrammed &quot;L &amp; V O&quot; and believed to have belonged to the Oliviers, containing 573 photographs of the couple during their 1948 tour of Australia. It is now held as part of the record of the history of the performing arts in Australia. In 2013, an archive of Leigh&#x27;s letters, diaries, photographs, annotated film and theatre scripts and her numerous awards was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Also in 2013, Leigh was among the ten people selected by the Royal Mail for their &quot;Great Britons&quot; commemorative postage stamp issue.

<text>Vitruvius ( ; ; –70 BC – after ) was a Roman architect and engineer during the 1st century BC, known for his multi-volume work titled . As the only treatise on architecture to survive from antiquity, it has been regarded since the Renaissance as the first book on architectural theory, as well as a major source on the canon of classical architecture. It is not clear to what extent his contemporaries regarded his book as original or important.

He states that all buildings should have three attributes: , , and (&quot;strength&quot;, &quot;utility&quot;, and &quot;beauty&quot;), principles reflected in much Ancient Roman architecture. His discussion of perfect proportion in architecture and the human body led to the famous Renaissance drawing of the &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci.

Little is known about Vitruvius&#x27; life, but by his own description he served as an artilleryman, the third class of arms in the Roman military offices. He probably served as a senior officer of artillery in charge of &quot;doctores ballistarum&quot; (artillery experts) and &quot;libratores&quot; who actually operated the machines. As an army engineer he specialized in the construction of &quot;ballista&quot; and &quot;scorpio&quot; artillery war machines for sieges. It is possible that Vitruvius served with Julius Caesar&#x27;s chief engineer Lucius Cornelius Balbus.

Vitruvius&#x27; was well-known and widely copied in the Middle Ages and survives in many dozens of manuscripts, though in 1414 it was &quot;rediscovered&quot; by the Florentine humanist Poggio Bracciolini in the library of Saint Gall Abbey. Leon Battista Alberti published it in his seminal treatise on architecture, (). The first known Latin printed edition was by Fra Giovanni Sulpitius in Rome in 1486. Translations followed in Italian, French, English, German, Spanish, and several other languages. Though any original illustrations have been lost, the first illustrated edition was published in Venice in 1511 by Fra Giovanni Giocondo, with woodcut illustrations based on descriptions in the text. Bramante, Michelangelo, Palladio, Vignola and earlier architects are known to have studied the work of Vitruvius, and consequently it has had a significant impact on the architecture of many European countries.

==Life and career==

Little is known about Vitruvius&#x27; life. Most inferences about him are extracted from his only surviving work . His full name is sometimes given as &quot;Marcus Vitruvius Pollio&quot;, but both the first and last names are uncertain. Marcus Cetius Faventinus writes of &quot;Vitruvius Polio aliique auctores&quot;; this can be read as &quot;Vitruvius Polio, and others&quot; or, less likely, as &quot;Vitruvius, Polio, and others&quot;. An inscription in Verona, which names a &quot;Lucius Vitruvius Cordo&quot;, and an inscription from Thilbilis in North Africa, which names a &quot;Marcus Vitruvius Mamurra&quot; have been suggested as evidence that Vitruvius and Mamurra (who was a military &quot;praefectus fabrum&quot; under Julius Caesar) were from the same family; or were even the same individual. Neither association, however, is borne out by (which Vitruvius dedicated to Augustus), nor by the little that is known of Mamurra.

Vitruvius was a military engineer (&quot;praefectus fabrum&quot;), or a &quot;praefect architectus armamentarius&quot; of the &quot;apparitor&quot; status group (a branch of the Roman civil service). He is mentioned in Pliny the Elder&#x27;s table of contents for (Natural History), in the heading for mosaic techniques. Frontinus refers to &quot;Vitruvius the architect&quot; in his late 1st-century work &quot;De aquaeductu&quot;.

Likely born a free Roman citizen, by his own account Vitruvius served in the Roman army under Caesar with the otherwise poorly identified Marcus Aurelius, Publius Minidius, and Gnaeus Cornelius. These names vary depending on the edition of . Publius Minidius is also written as Publius Numidicus and Publius Numidius, speculated as the same Publius Numisius inscribed on the Roman Theatre at Heraclea.

As an army engineer he specialized in the construction of &quot;ballista&quot; and &quot;scorpio&quot; artillery war machines for sieges. It is speculated that Vitruvius served with Caesar&#x27;s chief engineer Lucius Cornelius Balbus.

The locations where he served can be reconstructed from, for example, descriptions of the building methods of various &quot;foreign tribes&quot;. Although he describes places throughout , he does not say he was present. His service likely included north Africa, Hispania, Gaul (including Aquitaine), and Pontus.

To place the role of Vitruvius the military engineer in context, a description of &quot;The Prefect of the camp&quot; or army engineer is quoted here as given by Flavius Vegetius Renatus in &quot;The Military Institutions of the Romans&quot;:

The Prefect of the camp, though inferior in rank to the [Prefect], had a post of no small importance. The position of the camp, the direction of the entrenchments, the inspection of the tents or huts of the soldiers and the baggage were comprehended in his province. His authority extended over the sick, and the physicians who had the care of them; and he regulated the expenses relative thereto. He had the charge of providing carriages, bathhouses and the proper tools for sawing and cutting wood, digging trenches, raising parapets, sinking wells and bringing water into the camp. He likewise had the care of furnishing the troops with wood and straw, as well as the rams, &quot;onagri,&quot; &quot;balistae&quot; and all the other engines of war under his direction. This post was always conferred on an officer of great skill, experience and long service, and who consequently was capable of instructing others in those branches of the profession in which he had distinguished himself.

At various locations described by Vitruvius, battles and sieges occurred. He is the only source for the siege of Larignum in 56 BC. Of the battlegrounds of the Gallic War there are references to:
* The siege and massacre of the 40,000 residents at Avaricum in 52 BC. Vercingetorix commented that &quot;the Romans did not conquer by valour nor in the field, but by a kind of art and skill in assault, with which they [Gauls] themselves were unacquainted.&quot;
* The broken siege at Gergovia in 52 BC.
* The circumvallation and Battle of Alesia in 52 BC. The women and children of the encircled city were evicted to conserve food, and then starved to death between the opposing walls of the defenders and besiegers.
* The siege of Uxellodunum in 51 BC.
These are all sieges of large Gallic &quot;oppida&quot;. Of the sites involved in Caesar&#x27;s civil war, we find the Siege of Massilia in 49 BC (modern France), the Battle of Dyrrhachium of 48 BC (modern Albania), the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC (Hellas – Greece), the Battle of Zela of 47 BC (modern Turkey), and the Battle of Thapsus in 46 BC in Caesar&#x27;s African campaign. A legion that fits the same sequence of locations is the Legio VI Ferrata, of which &quot;ballista&quot; would be an auxiliary unit.

Mainly known for his writings, Vitruvius was himself an architect. In Roman times architecture was a broader subject than at present including the modern fields of architecture, construction management, construction engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, materials engineering, mechanical engineering, military engineering and urban planning; architectural engineers consider him the first of their discipline, a specialization previously known as technical architecture.

In his work describing the construction of military installations, he also commented on the miasma theory – the idea that unhealthy air from wetlands was the cause of illness, saying:

Frontinus mentions Vitruvius in connection with the standard sizes of pipes: probably the role for which he was most widely respected in Roman times. He is often credited as father of architectural acoustics for describing the technique of &quot;echeas&quot; placement in theaters. The only building, however, that we know Vitruvius to have worked on is one he tells us about, a &quot;basilica&quot; completed in 19 BC. It was built at Fanum Fortunae, now the modern town of Fano. The &quot;Basilica di Fano&quot; (to give the building its Italian name) has disappeared so completely that its very site is a matter of conjecture, although various attempts have been made to visualise it. The early Christian practice of converting Roman &quot;basilicae&quot; (public buildings) into cathedrals implies the &quot;basilica&quot; may be incorporated into the Romanesque Fano Cathedral.

In later years the emperor Augustus, through his sister Octavia Minor, sponsored Vitruvius, entitling him with what may have been a pension to guarantee financial independence.

Whether was written by one author or is a compilation completed by subsequent librarians and copyists, remains an open question. The date of his death is unknown, which suggests that he had enjoyed only a little popularity during his lifetime.

Gerolamo Cardano, in his 1552 book &quot;De subtilitate rerum&quot;, ranks Vitruvius as one of the 12 persons whom he supposes to have excelled all men in the force of genius and invention; and might have given him first place if it was clear that he had set down his own discoveries. 

James Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Constitutions of the Free-Masons&quot; (1734), reprinted by Benjamin Franklin, describes Vitruvius as &quot;the Father of all true Architects to this Day.&quot;

==&quot;De architectura&quot;==

Vitruvius is the author of &quot;De architectura, libri decem&quot;, known today as &quot;The Ten Books on Architecture&quot;, a treatise written in Latin on architecture, dedicated to the emperor Augustus. In the preface of Book I, Vitruvius dedicates his writings to giving personal knowledge of the quality of buildings to the emperor. Likely Vitruvius is referring to Marcus Agrippa&#x27;s campaign of public repairs and improvements. This work is the only surviving major book on architecture from classical antiquity. According to Petri Liukkonen, this text &quot;influenced deeply from the Early Renaissance onwards artists, thinkers, and architects, among them Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472), Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), and Michelangelo (1475–1564).&quot; The next major book on architecture, Alberti&#x27;s reformulation of &quot;Ten Books&quot;, was not written until 1452.

However, we know there was a significant body of writing about architecture in Greek, where &quot;architects habitually wrote books about their work&quot;, including two we know of about the Parthenon alone. To A. W. Lawrence, Vitruvius &quot;has recorded a most elaborate set of rules taken from Greek authors, who must have compiled them gradually in the course of the preceding centuries&quot;.

Vitruvius is famous for asserting in his book that a structure must exhibit the three qualities of &quot;firmitatis, utilitatis, venustatis&quot; – that is, stability, utility, and beauty. These are sometimes termed the Vitruvian virtues or the Vitruvian Triad. According to Vitruvius, architecture is an imitation of nature. As birds and bees built their nests, so humans constructed housing from natural materials, that gave them shelter against the elements. When perfecting this art of building, the Greeks invented the architectural orders: Doric, Ionic and Corinthian. It gave them a sense of proportion, culminating in understanding the proportions of the greatest work of art: the human body. This led Vitruvius in defining his Vitruvian Man, as drawn later by Leonardo da Vinci: the human body inscribed in the circle and the square (the fundamental geometric patterns of the cosmic order). In this book series, Vitruvius also wrote about climate in relation to housing architecture and how to choose locations for cities.

===Scope===

Vitruvius is the first Roman architect to have written surviving records of his field. He himself cites older but less complete works. He was less an original thinker or creative intellect than a codifier of existing architectural practice. Roman architects practised a wide variety of disciplines; in modern terms they would also be described as landscape architects, civil engineers, military engineers, structural engineers, surveyors, artists, and craftsmen combined. Etymologically the word architect derives from Greek words meaning &#x27;master&#x27; and &#x27;builder&#x27;. The first of the &quot;Ten Books&quot; deals with many subjects which are now within the scope of landscape architecture.

In Book I, Chapter 1, titled The Education of the Architect, Vitruvius instructs...

He goes on to say that the architect should be versed in drawing, geometry, optics (lighting), history, philosophy, music, theatre, medicine, and law.

In Book I, Chapter 3 (&quot;The Departments of Architecture&quot;), Vitruvius divides architecture into three branches, namely; building; the construction of sundials and water clocks; and the design and use of machines in construction and warfare. He further divides building into public and private. Public building includes city planning, public security structures such as walls, gates and towers; the convenient placing of public facilities such as theatres, forums and markets, baths, roads and pavings; and the construction and position of shrines and temples for religious use. Later books are devoted to the understanding, design and construction of each of these.

===Proportions of man===

In Book III, Chapter 1, Paragraph 3, Vitruvius writes about the proportions of man:
It was upon these writings that Renaissance engineers, architects and artists like Mariano di Jacopo Taccola, Pellegrino Prisciani and Francesco di Giorgio Martini and finally Leonardo da Vinci based the illustration of the &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;.

Vitruvius described the human figure as being the principal source of proportion.

The drawing itself is often used as an implied symbol of the essential symmetry of the human body, and by extension, of the universe as a whole.

===Lists of names given in Book VII Introduction===
In the introduction to book seven, Vitruvius goes to great lengths to present why he is qualified to write . This is the only location in the work where Vitruvius specifically addresses his personal breadth of knowledge. Similar to a modern reference section, the author&#x27;s position as one who is knowledgeable and educated is established. The topics range across many fields of expertise reflecting that in Roman times as today construction is a diverse field. Vitruvius is clearly a well-read man.

In addition to providing his qualification, Vitruvius summarizes a recurring theme throughout the 10 books, a non-trivial and core contribution of his treatise beyond simply being a construction book. Vitruvius makes the point that the work of some of the most talented is unknown, while many of those of lesser talent but greater political position are famous. This theme runs through Vitruvius&#x27;s ten books repeatedly – echoing an implicit prediction that he and his works will also be forgotten.

Vitruvius illustrates this point by naming what he considers the most talented individuals in history. Implicitly challenging the reader that they have never heard of some of these people, Vitruvius goes on and predicts that some of these individuals will be forgotten and their works lost, while other, less deserving political characters of history will be forever remembered with pageantry.

===Rediscovery===

Vitruvius&#x27; was &quot;rediscovered&quot; in 1414 by the Florentine humanist Poggio Bracciolini in the library of Saint Gall Abbey. Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) publicised it in his seminal treatise on architecture, (). The first known Latin printed edition was by Fra Giovanni Sulpitius in Rome, 1486. Translations followed in Italian (Cesare Cesariano, 1521), French (Jean Martin, 1547), English, German (Walther H. Ryff, 1543) and Spanish and several other languages. The original illustrations had been lost and the first illustrated edition was published in Venice in 1511 by Fra Giovanni Giocondo, with woodcut illustrations based on descriptions in the text. Later in the 16th-century Andrea Palladio provided illustrations for Daniele Barbaro&#x27;s commentary on Vitruvius, published in Italian and Latin versions. The most famous illustration is probably Da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;.

The surviving ruins of Roman antiquity, the Roman Forum, temples, theatres, triumphal arches and their reliefs and statues offered visual examples of the descriptions in the Vitruvian text. Printed and illustrated editions of inspired Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical architecture. Filippo Brunelleschi, for example, invented a new type of hoist to lift the large stones for the dome of the cathedral in Florence and was inspired by as well as surviving Roman monuments such as the Pantheon and the Baths of Diocletian.

==Roman technology==

Books VIII, IX and X form the basis of much of what we know about Roman technology, now augmented by archaeological studies of extant remains, such as the water mills at Barbegal in France. The other major source of information is the compiled by Pliny the Elder much later in .

===Machines===
The work is important for its descriptions of the many different machines used for engineering structures such as hoists, cranes and pulleys, as well as war machines such as catapults, &quot;ballistae,&quot; and siege engines. As a practising engineer, Vitruvius must be speaking from personal experience rather than simply describing the works of others. He also describes the construction of sundials and water clocks, and the use of an aeolipile (the first steam engine) as an experiment to demonstrate the nature of atmospheric air movements (wind).

===Aqueducts===
His description of aqueduct construction includes the way they are surveyed, and the careful choice of materials needed, although Frontinus (a general who was appointed in the late 1st century AD to administer the many aqueducts of Rome), writing a century later, gives much more detail of the practical problems involved in their construction and maintenance. Surely Vitruvius&#x27; book would have been of great assistance in this. Vitruvius was writing in the 1st century BC when many of the finest Roman aqueducts were built, and survive to this day, such as those at Segovia and the Pont du Gard. The use of the inverted siphon is described in detail, together with the problems of high pressures developed in the pipe at the base of the siphon, a practical problem with which he seems to be acquainted.

===Materials===
He describes many different construction materials used for a wide variety of different structures, as well as such details as stucco painting. Concrete and lime receive in-depth descriptions.

Vitruvius is cited as one of the earliest sources to connect lead mining and manufacture, its use in drinking water pipes, and its adverse effects on health. For this reason, he recommended the use of clay pipes and masonry channels in the provision of piped drinking-water.

Vitruvius is the source for the anecdote that credits Archimedes with the discovery of the mass-to-volume ratio while relaxing in his bath. Having been asked to investigate the suspected adulteration of the gold used to make a crown, Archimedes realised that the crown&#x27;s volume could be measured exactly by its displacement of water, and ran into the street with the cry of&quot; Eureka!&quot;

===Dewatering machines===
He describes the construction of Archimedes&#x27; screw in Chapter X (without mentioning Archimedes by name). It was a device widely used for raising water to irrigate fields and drain mines. Other lifting machines he mentions include the endless chain of buckets and the reverse overshot water-wheel. Remains of the water wheels used for lifting water were discovered when old mines were re-opened at Rio Tinto in Spain, Rosia Montana in Romania and Dolaucothi in west Wales. The Rio Tinto wheel is now shown in the British Museum, and the Dolaucothi specimen in the National Museum of Wales.

===Surveying instruments===
That he must have been well practised in surveying is shown by his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or &quot;chorobates,&quot; which he compares favourably with the &quot;groma,&quot; a device using plumb lines. They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to the provision of a regular supply of water without damage to the walls of the channel. He also developed one of the first odometers, consisting of a wheel of known circumference that dropped a pebble into a container on every rotation.

===Central heating===
He describes the many innovations made in building design to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants. Foremost among them is the development of the &quot;hypocaust,&quot; a type of central heating where hot air developed by a fire was channelled under the floor and inside the walls of public baths and villas. He gives explicit instructions how to design such buildings so that fuel efficiency is maximised, so that for example, the &quot;caldarium&quot; is next to the &quot;tepidarium&quot; followed by the &quot;frigidarium&quot;. He also advises on using a type of regulator to control the heat in the hot rooms, a bronze disc set into the roof under a circular aperture which could be raised or lowered by a pulley to adjust the ventilation. Although he does not suggest it himself, it is likely that his dewatering devices such as the reverse overshot water-wheel were used in the larger baths to lift water to header tanks at the top of the larger &quot;thermae&quot;, such as the Baths of Diocletian. The one which was used in Bath of Caracalla for grinding flour.

<text>Villains and Vigilantes (abbreviated as V&amp;V) is a superhero-themed role-playing game which competed primarily with &quot;Champions&quot; and &quot;Superworld&quot; in the early to mid-1980s.

==Origin==
&quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot; was the first role-playing game designed by Jack Herman and Jeff Dee and featured illustrations by Dee. Fantasy Games Unlimited published the first edition of &quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot; in 1979. The second edition of &quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot; was published in 1982 with significant rule revisions. In 2010, Monkey House Games published a new edition of the game, although a lawsuit filed in U.S. Federal court, Arizona District, (Case no. 2:2011-cv-02036) asserted that Monkey House Games had no legal right to do so. That lawsuit has since been resolved and a settlement agreed upon with both parties producing their own material.

==Mechanics==
Character creation in &quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot; reflects the unique nature of the rules. Instead of playing a completely fictional character, players are encouraged to start the process with a version of themselves (presumably as the superhero&#x27;s &quot;secret identity.&quot;) &quot;V&amp;V&quot; then uses random die rolls for the origins of superpowers (i.e., mutant, space alien, etc.) number and type, sometimes resulting in odd combinations. A further quirk of the system is that while players advance in levels and hit points, superpowers do not, lending a different feel to characters at low, middle, and high power levels. Character stats in the first edition of the game are strength, endurance, agility, intelligence, and charisma.

Another feature of the system is its approach to combat: a table outlines the effectiveness of the attacker&#x27;s superpower (for example, an energy blast) against the defender&#x27;s powers, reflecting the interplay of attack and defense powers.

==Publication history==

The first edition was created by Jeff Dee and Jack Herman and published by Fantasy Games Unlimited in 1979. This book was followed by an adventure published in 1981, &quot;Break In at Three Kilometer Island&quot;, and a pair of adventures in 1982 designed specifically to be playable with the original ruleset, but to begin to introduce players to the revised second edition which was published later the same year. These two adventures were authored by Bill Willingham, the creator of the &quot;Fables&quot; comic book series. Willingham&#x27;s adventures also used characters that would later appear in his comic book series, &quot;Elementals&quot;.

The second edition of Villains &amp; Vigilantes, created by the same authors and also published by Fantasy Games Unlimited, was released in 1982 in two formats, both as a single rulebook and in a boxed set that contained the revised rulebook, GM&#x27;s screen, dice and character sheets. These were followed by a line of adventure module and rule supplements published through the &#x27;80s until the final supplement published in 1987, &quot;For the Greater Good&quot;.

In 2004, Fantasy Games Unlimited began republishing the original &quot;V&amp;V&quot; rules and supplements as a series of electronic supplements via the DriveThruRPG online store, continuing to add supplements until nearly the entire back catalog is now available.

In 2010, the creators of the game released a new revised version, version 2.1, published through Monkey House Games. This has caused ongoing legal disputes. That same year, Fantasy Games Unlimited began releasing new supplements for &quot;2nd Edition Villains and Vigilantes&quot;, for the first time since 1987, while Monkey House Games continued to release supplements of its own. Both companies continue to sell their products. On April 20, 2016 a resolution has been agreed upon.

==Adventures==
&quot;Crisis at Crusader Citadel&quot; is an introductory adventure published in 1982 by Fantasy Games Unlimited and written and illustrated by Dee and Herman. The scenario begins with the players controlling neophyte superheroes, based on themselves, who are looking to apply for membership in the established super-hero team called the Crusaders. During the adventure, the player-heroes have to stop a crime wave being carried out by the Crusaders&#x27; opposite numbers, a villain team called the Crushers.

Four years after the adventure booklet was published, the setting of the first adventure was used as the basis of a &quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot; comic book limited series by Dee and Herman, published by Eclipse Comics. Each issue included character sheets for new heroes and villains, and updated material for the existing ones for use in the game. (This device was also used in another comic book limited series published by Eclipse, based on the superhero role-playing game the &quot;Champions&quot;, during the same period.)

Two early adventures for the game by Bill Willingham, &quot;Death Duel with the Destroyers&quot; and &quot;The Island of Dr. Apocalypse&quot;, used characters that would later appear in his comic book series &quot;Elementals&quot;. Similarly, a &quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot; character, The Dark, later appeared in a series of comic books by the independent publisher Continüm Comics.

==Reception==
In the inaugural edition of &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; (March 1980), Greg Costikyan commented &quot;&quot;Villains &amp; Vigilantes&quot; is an imaginative, enjoyable game. Its major problem is &#x27;creeping &quot;D&amp;D&quot;ism;&#x27; most of the game-systems are directly derived from &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, and are out of place in a superhero rpg. Also, the short rules do not really provide enough background material and world-design advice for a full-scale role-playing game.&quot; Costikyan gave the game a rating of 6 out of 9.

In Issue 29 of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot;, Marc Weidenbaum wrote, &quot;&quot;&quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot; is a good, firm, introductory role-playing game with easy-to-learn rules. If you are a game master from another &#x27;world&#x27; you can, with little difficulty, adapt these rules to fit almost any other role-playing game.&quot;

William A. Barton reviewed the revised &quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 62 and commented &quot;if you&#x27;re really into superhero adventure, I&#x27;d recommend giving revised &quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot; a try. If you decide you still like &quot;Champions&quot; or &quot;Superworld&quot; better, well, you can always use &quot;V&amp;V&quot; to help you decide what powers to purchase in another system when your superintelligence is on patrol near Arcturus IV.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan commented that since its original appearance more than a decade before, &quot;&quot;V&amp;V&quot; continues to hold its own, thanks to its tongue-in-cheek approach and some genuinely inspired concepts.&quot; Swan thought the character generation system was the most notable part of the game, but &quot;The rest of the game, sadly, lacks the elegance of the character-creation rules.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game a solid rating of 3 out of 4, saying, &quot;For those with a little role-playing experience under their belts, &quot;Vigilantes &amp; Villains&quot; is a terrific introduction to superhero games.&quot;

==2011 legal dispute==
The game&#x27;s creators were involved in a legal dispute with Fantasy Games Unlimited since 2011. They claimed that Fantasy Games Unlimited, Inc. ceased to exist in 1991, and that their contract specified that in such an event the contracted publication rights would revert to them, and that therefore the current Fantasy Games Unlimited (which they claim is a separate legal entity, although with the same owner) had no right to sell &quot;V&amp;V&quot; material. A court case filed in U.S. Federal court, Arizona district (REFERENCE: case no. 2:2011-cv-02036) supported the claim by Fantasy Games Unlimited that the owner properly followed procedure to continue with the obligations of the New York business entity in continued operations as the Arizona entity. The case also asserted that at the time of its dissolution in New York, FGU was current on all obligations with that state and in good standing which then devolved into the entity now operating simply as Fantasy Games Unlimited.

A judgment given on July 11, 2012, on the first two counts of case no. 2:2011-cv-02036 in U.S. Federal court, Arizona district ruled in favor of Scott Bizar resulting in Jeff Dee and Jack Herman being found guilty of defamation and unfair business practice and causing unspecified damages to the plaintiff. More judgments on other counts were still pending as of that date. The judgment ordered (not withstanding any other punitive measures to be determined for damages on all counts) the defendants within 30 days to post conspicuously in every place on the internet a retraction/corrective measure where their false statements have been posted.

In January 2013, the U.S. District Court of Arizona found that Jeff Dee and Jack Herman own all copyrights to &quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot;, including the previously contracted to Fantasy Games Unlimited. Additionally the court found that Fantasy Games Unlimited had been using Dee&#x27;s and Herman&#x27;s (the game creators&#x27;) copyrighted material without permission by selling merchandise like T-shirts, comic books, and video games. Finally, the court found that Fantasy Games Unlimited had legally abandoned its trademark rights to the title &quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot; due to disuse.

<doc id="32798" wikidata="Q182688" url="?curid=32798" title="Victorian era">
<text>In the history of the United Kingdom and the British Empire, the Victorian era was the reign of Queen Victoria, from 20 June 1837 until her death on 22 January 1901. Slightly different definitions are sometimes used. The era followed the Georgian era and preceded the Edwardian era, and its later half overlaps with the first part of the &quot;Belle Époque&quot; era of continental Europe.

Various liberalising political reforms took place in the UK, including expanding the electoral franchise. The Great Famine caused mass death in Ireland early in the period. The British Empire had relatively peaceful relations with the other great powers. It participated in various military conflicts mainly against minor powers. The British Empire expanded during this period and was the predominant power in the world.

Victorian society valued a high standard of personal conduct across all sections of society. The emphasis on morality gave impetus to social reform but also placed restrictions on certain groups&#x27; liberty. Prosperity rose during the period, but debilitating undernutrition persisted. Literacy and childhood education became near universal in Great Britain for the first time. Whilst some attempts were made to improve living conditions, slum housing and disease remained a severe problem.

The period saw significant scientific and technological development. Britain was advanced in industry and engineering in particular, but somewhat undeveloped in art and education. Great Britain&#x27;s population increased rapidly, while Ireland&#x27;s fell sharply.

==Terminology and periodisation==
In the strictest sense, the Victorian era covers the duration of Victoria&#x27;s reign as Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, from her accession on 20 June 1837—after the death of her uncle, William IV—until her death on 22 January 1901, after which she was succeeded by her eldest son, Edward VII. Her reign lasted 63 years and seven months, a longer period than any of her predecessors. The term &#x27;Victorian&#x27; was in contemporaneous usage to describe the era. The era can also be understood in a more extensive sense—the &#x27;long Victorian era&#x27;—as a period that possessed sensibilities and characteristics distinct from the periods adjacent to it, in which case it is sometimes dated to begin before Victoria&#x27;s accession—typically from the passage of or agitation for (during the 1830s) the Reform Act 1832, which introduced a wide-ranging change to the electoral system of England and Wales. Definitions that purport a distinct sensibility or politics to the era have also created scepticism about the worth of the label &#x27;Victorian&#x27;, though there have also been defences of it.

Michael Sadleir was insistent that &quot;in truth, the Victorian period is three periods, and not one&quot;. He distinguished early Victorianism—the socially and politically unsettled period from 1837 to 1850—and late Victorianism (from 1880 onwards), with its new waves of aestheticism and imperialism, from the Victorian heyday: mid-Victorianism, 1851 to 1879. He saw the latter period as characterised by a distinctive mixture of prosperity, domestic prudery, and complacency—what G. M. Trevelyan called the &#x27;mid-Victorian decades of quiet politics and roaring prosperity&#x27;.

==Politics, diplomacy and war==
The Reform Act, which made various changes to the electoral system including expanding the franchise, had been passed in 1832. The franchise was expanded again by the Second Reform Act in 1867. The Third Reform Act in 1884 introduced a general principle of one vote per household. All these acts and others simplified the electoral system and reduced corruption. Historian Bruce L Kinzer describes these reforms as putting the United Kingdom on the path towards becoming a democracy. The traditional aristocratic ruling class attempted to maintain as much influence as possible while gradually allowing the middle- and working-classes a role in politics. However, all women and a large minority of men remained outside the system into the early 20th century.
Cities were given greater political autonomy and the labour movement was legalised. From 1845 to 1852, the Potato Famine caused mass starvation, disease and death in Ireland, sparking large-scale emigration. The Corn Laws were repealed in response to this. Across the British Empire, reform included rapid expansion, the complete abolition of slavery in the African possessions and the end of transportation of convicts to Australia. Restrictions on colonial trade were loosened and responsible (i.e. semi-autonomous) government was introduced in some territories.

Throughout most of the 19th century Britain was the most powerful country in the world. The period from 1815 to 1914, known as the Pax Britannica, was a time of relatively peaceful relations between the world&#x27;s great powers. This is particularly true of Britain&#x27;s interactions with the others. The only war in which the British Empire fought against another major power was the Crimean War, from 1853 to 1856. There were various revolts and violent conflicts within the British Empire, and Britain participated in wars against minor powers. It also took part in the diplomatic struggles of the Great Game and the Scramble for Africa.

In 1840, Queen Victoria married her German cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The couple had nine children, who themselves married into various royal families, and the queen thus became known as the &#x27;grandmother of Europe&#x27;. In 1861, Albert died. Victoria went into mourning and withdrew from public life for ten years. In 1871, with republican sentiments growing in Britain, she began to return to public life. In her later years, her popularity soared as she became a symbol of the British Empire. Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901.

==Society and culture==

===Family life===
The Victorian era saw a rapidly growing middle class who became an important cultural influence, to a significant extent replacing the aristocracy as British society&#x27;s dominant class. A distinctive middle-class lifestyle developed that influenced what society valued as a whole.&quot;&quot; Increased importance was placed on the value of the family, and the idea that marriage should be based on romantic love gained popularity. A clear separation was established between the home and the workplace, which had often not been the case before.&quot;&quot; The home was seen as a private environment,&quot;&quot; where housewives provided their husbands with a respite from the troubles of the outside world. Within this ideal, women were expected to focus on domestic matters and to rely on men as breadwinners. Women had limited legal rights in most areas of life, and a feminist movement developed. Parental authority was seen as important, but children were given legal protections against abuse and neglect for the first time towards the end of the period. Access to education increased rapidly during the 19th century. State-funded schools were established in England and Wales for the first time. Education became compulsory for pre-teenaged children in England, Scotland and Wales. Literacy rates increased rapidly, and had become nearly universal by the end of the century. Private education for wealthier children, boys and more gradually girls, became more formalised over the course of the century.
===Religion and social issues===
The growing middle class and strong evangelical movement placed great emphasis on a respectable and moral code of behaviour. This included features such as charity, personal responsibility, controlled habits, child discipline and self-criticism. As well as personal improvement, importance was given to social reform. Utilitarianism was another philosophy that saw itself as based on science rather than on morality, but also emphasised social progress. An alliance formed between these two ideological strands. The reformers emphasised causes such as improving the conditions of women and children, giving police reform priority over harsh punishment to prevent crime, religious equality, and political reform in order to establish a democracy. The political legacy of the reform movement was to link the nonconformists (part of the evangelical movement) in England and Wales with the Liberal Party. This continued until the First World War. The Presbyterians played a similar role as a religious voice for reform in Scotland.

Religion was politically controversial during this era, with Nonconformists pushing for the disestablishment of the Church of England. Nonconformists comprised about half of church attendees in England in 1851, and gradually the legal discrimination that had been established against them outside of Scotland was removed. Legal restrictions on Roman Catholics were also largely removed. The number of Catholics grew in Great Britain due to conversions and immigration from Ireland. Secularism and doubts about the accuracy of the Old Testament grew among people with higher levels of education. Northern English and Scottish academics tended to be more religiously conservative, whilst agnosticism and even atheism (though its promotion was illegal) gained appeal among academics in the south. Historians refer to a &#x27;Victorian Crisis of Faith&#x27;, a period when religious views had to readjust to accommodate new scientific knowledge and criticism of the Bible.
===Popular culture===
A variety of reading materials grew in popularity during the period, including novels, women&#x27;s magazines, children&#x27;s literature, and newspapers. Much literature, including chapbooks, was distributed on the street. Music was also very popular, with genres such as folk music, broadsides, music halls, brass bands, theater music and choral music having mass appeal. What is now called classical music was somewhat undeveloped compared to parts of Europe but did have significant support. Many sports were introduced or popularised during the Victorian era. They became important to male identity. Examples included cricket, football, rugby, tennis and cycling. The idea of women participating in sport did not fit well with the Victorian view of femininity, but their involvement did increase as the period progressed. 

For the middle classes, many leisure activities such as table games could be done in the home while domestic holidays to rural locations such as the Lake District and Scottish Highlands were increasingly practical. The working classes had their own culture separate from that of their richer counterparts, various cheaper forms of entertainment and recreational activities provided by philanthropy. Trips to resorts such as Blackpool were increasingly popular towards the end of period. Photography became an increasingly accessible and popular part of everyday life. Initially the industrial revolution increased working hours, but over the course of the 19th century a variety of political and economic changes caused them to fall back down to and in some cases below pre-industrial levels, creating more time for leisure.

==Economy, industry, and trade==


Before the Industrial Revolution, daily life had changed little for hundreds of years. The 19th century saw rapid technological development with a wide range of new inventions. This led Great Britain to become the foremost industrial and trading nation of the time. Historians have characterised the mid-Victorian era (1850–1870) as Britain&#x27;s &#x27;Golden Years&#x27;, with national income per person increasing by half. This prosperity was driven by increased industrialisation, especially in textiles and machinery, along with exports to the empire and elsewhere. The positive economic conditions, as well as a fashion among employers for providing welfare services to their workers, led to relative social stability. The Chartist movement for working-class men to be given the right to vote, which had been prominent in the early Victorian period, dissipated. Government involvement in the economy was limited. Only in the post-World War II period, around a century later, did the country experience substantial economic growth again. But whilst industry was well developed, education and the arts were mediocre. Wage rates continued to improve in the later 19th century: real wages (after taking inflation into account) were 65 per cent higher in 1901 compared to 1871. Much of the money was saved, as the number of depositors in savings banks rose from 430,000 in 1831 to 5.2 million in 1887, and their deposits from £14 million to over £90 million.
===Child labour===

Children had always played a role in economic life but exploitation of their labour became especially intense during the Victorian era. Children were put to work in a wide range of occupations, but particularly associated with this period are factories. Employing children had advantages, as they were cheap, had limited ability to resist harsh working conditions, and could enter spaces too small for adults. Some accounts exist of happy upbringings involving child labour, but conditions were generally poor. Pay was low, punishments severe, work was dangerous and disrupted children&#x27;s development (often leaving them too tired to play even in their free time). Early labour could do lifelong harm; even in the 1960s and &#x27;70s, the elderly people of industrial towns were noted for their often unusually short stature, deformed physiques, and diseases associated with unhealthy working conditions. Reformers wanted the children in school; in 1840 only about 20 per cent of the children in London had any schooling. By the 1850s, around half of the children in England and Wales were in school (not including Sunday school). From the 1833 Factory Act onwards, attempts were made to get child labourers into part time education, though this was often difficult to achieve. Only in the 1870s and 1880s did children begin to be compelled into school. Work continued to inhibit children&#x27;s schooling into the early 20th century.

== Housing and public health ==

19th-century Britain saw a huge population increase accompanied by rapid urbanisation stimulated by the Industrial Revolution. In the 1901 census, more than three out of every four people were classified as living in an urban area, compared to one in five a century earlier. Historian Richard A. Soloway wrote that &quot;Great Britain had become the most urbanized country in the West.&quot; The rapid growth in the urban population included the new industrial and manufacturing cities, as well as service centres such as Edinburgh and London. Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure. P. Kemp says this was usually of advantage to tenants. Overcrowding was a major problem with seven or eight people frequently sleeping in a single room. Until at least the 1880s, sanitation was inadequate in areas such as water supply and disposal of sewage. This all had a negative effect on health, especially that of the impoverished young. For instance, of the babies born in Liverpool in 1851, only 45 per cent survived to age 20. Conditions were particularly bad in London, where the population rose sharply and poorly maintained, overcrowded dwellings became slum housing. Kellow Chesney wrote of the situation:

Hunger and poor diet was a common aspect of life across the UK in the Victorian period, especially in the 1840s, but the mass starvation seen in the Great Famine in Ireland was unique. Levels of poverty fell significantly during the 19th century from as much as two thirds of the population in 1800 to less than a third by 1901. However, 1890s studies suggested that almost 10% of the urban population lived in a state of desperation lacking the food necessary to maintain basic physical functions. Attitudes towards the poor were often unsympathetic and they were frequently blamed for their situation. In that spirit, the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 had been deliberately designed to punish them and would remain the basis for welfare provision into the 20th century. While many people were prone to vices, not least alcoholism, historian Bernard A. Cook argues that the main reason for 19th century poverty was that typical wages for much of the population were simply too low. Barely enough to provide a subsistence living in good times, let alone save up for bad.

Improvements were made over time to housing along with the management of sewage and water eventually giving the UK the most advanced system of public health protection anywhere in the world. The quality and safety of household lighting improved over the period with oil lamps becoming the norm in the early 1860s, gas lighting in the 1890s and electric lights beginning to appear in the homes of the richest by the end of the period. Medicine advanced rapidly during the 19th century and germ theory was developed for the first time. Doctors became more specialised and the number of hospitals grew. The overall number of deaths fell by about 20%. The life expectancy of women increased from around 42 to 55 and 40 to 56 for men. In spite of this, the mortality rate fell only marginally, from 20.8 per thousand in 1850 to 18.2 by the end of the century. Urbanisation aided the spread of diseases and squalid living conditions in many places exacerbated the problem. The population of England, Scotland and Wales grew rapidly during the 19th century. Various factors are considered contributary to this, including a rising fertility rate (though it was falling by the end of the period), the lack of a catastrophic pandemic or famine in the island of Great Britain during the 19th century for the first time in history, improved nutrition, and a lower overall mortality rate. Ireland&#x27;s population shrank significantly, mostly due to emigration and the Great Famine.

==Knowledge==
===Science===

The professionalisation of scientific study began in parts of Europe following the French Revolution but was slow to reach Britain. William Whewell coined the term &#x27;scientist&#x27; in 1833 to refer to those who studied what was generally then known as natural philosophy, but it took a while to catch on. Having been previously dominated by amateurs with a separate income, the Royal Society admitted only professionals from 1847 onwards. The British biologist Thomas Henry Huxley indicated in 1852 that it remained difficult to earn a living as a scientist alone. Scientific knowledge and debates such as that about Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859), which sought to explain biological evolution by natural selection, gained a high profile in the public consciousness. Simplified (and at times inaccurate) popular science was increasingly distributed through a variety of publications which caused tension with the professionals. There were significant advances in various fields of research, including statistics, elasticity, refrigeration, natural history, electromagnetism, and logic.
===Industry===
Known as the &#x27;workshop of the world&#x27;, Britain was uniquely advanced in technology in the mid-19th century. Engineering, having developed into a profession in the 18th century, gained new profile and prestige in this period. The Victorian era saw methods of communication and transportation develop significantly. In 1837, William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone invented the first telegraph system. This system, which used electrical currents to transmit coded messages, quickly spread across Britain, appearing in every town and post office. A worldwide network developed towards the end of the century. In 1876, an American patented the telephone. A little over a decade later, 26,000 telephones were in service in Britain. Multiple switchboards were installed in every major town and city. Guglielmo Marconi developed early radio broadcasting at the end of the period. The railways were important economically in the Victorian era, allowing goods, raw materials, and people to be moved around, stimulating trade and industry. They were also a major employer and industry in their own right.

== Moral standards ==


Expected standards of personal conduct changed in around the first half of the 19th century, with good manners and self-restraint becoming much more common. Historians have suggested various contributing factors, such as Britain&#x27;s major conflicts with France during the early 19th century, meaning that the distracting temptations of sinful behaviour had to be avoided in order to focus on the war effort, and the evangelical movement&#x27;s push for moral improvement. There is evidence that the expected standards of moral behaviour were reflected in action as well as rhetoric across all classes of society. For instance, an analysis suggested that less than 5% of working class couples cohabited before marriage.

Historian Harold Perkin argued that the change in moral standards led by the middle of the 19th century to &#x27;diminished cruelty to animals, criminals, lunatics, and children (in that order)&#x27;. Legal restrictions were placed on cruelty to animals. Restrictions were placed on the working hours of child labourers in the 1830s and 1840s. Further interventions took place throughout the century to increase the level of child protection. Use of the death penalty also decreased. Crime rates fell significantly in the second half of the 19th century. Sociologist Christie Davies linked this change to attempts to morally educate the population, especially at Sunday schools.
===Sexual behaviour===
Contrary to popular belief, Victorian society understood that both men and women enjoyed copulation. Chastity was expected of women, whilst attitudes to male sexual behaviour were more relaxed. The development of police forces led to a rise in prosecutions for illegal sodomy in the middle of the 19th century. Male sexuality became a favourite subject of medical researchers&#x27; study. For the first time, all male homosexual acts were outlawed. Concern about sexual exploitation of adolescent girls increased during the period, especially following the white slavery scandal, which contributed to the increasing of the age of consent from 13 to 16. 

At a time when job options for women were limited and generally low-paying, some women, particularly those without familial support, took to prostitution to support themselves. Attitudes in public life and among the general population to prostitution varied. Evidence about prostitutes&#x27; situation also varies. One contemporary study argues that the trade was a short-term stepping stone to a different lifestyle for many women, while another, more recent study argues they were subject to physical abuse, financial exploitation, state persecution, and difficult working conditions. Due to worries about venereal disease, especially among soldiers, women suspected of prostitution were for a period between the 1860s and 1880s subject to spot compulsory examinations for sexually transmitted infections, and detainment if they were found to be infected. This caused a great deal of resentment among women in general due to the principle underlying the checks, that women had to be controlled in order to be safe for sexual use by men, and the checks were opposed by some of the earliest feminist campaigning.

<doc id="32799" wikidata="Q593448" url="?curid=32799" title="Variable-star designation">
<text>In astronomy, a variable-star designation is a unique identifier given to variable stars. It extends on the Bayer designation format, with an identifying label (as described below) preceding the Latin genitive of the name of the constellation in which the star lies. The identifying label can be one or two Latin letters or a &quot;V&quot; plus a number (e.g. V399). Examples are R Coronae Borealis, YZ Ceti, V603 Aquilae. (&quot;See&quot; List of constellations &quot;for a list of constellations and the genitive forms of their names&quot;.)

==Naming==
The current naming system is:
* Stars with existing Greek letter Bayer designations are not given new designations.
* Otherwise, start with the letter R and go through Z.
* Continue with RR–RZ, then use SS–SZ, TT–TZ and so on until ZZ.
* After ZZ return to the beginning of the Latin alphabet and use AA–AZ, BB–BZ, CC–CZ, and so on, until reaching QZ, but omitting the letter J in either first or second position.
* Abandon the Latin letters after all 334 combinations of letters and start naming stars with V335, V336, and so on.
The second letter is never nearer the beginning of the alphabet than the first, e.g., no star can be BA, CA, CB, DA and so on.

==History==

In the early 19th century few variable stars were known, so it seemed reasonable to use the letters of the Latin script. Because very few constellations contained stars with uppercase Latin-letter Bayer designation greater than Q, the letter R was chosen as a starting point so as to avoid confusion with letter spectral types or the (now rarely used) Latin-letter Bayer designations. Although Lacaille had used uppercase R–Z letters in a few cases, for example X Puppis (HR 2548), these designations were either dropped or accepted as variable star designations. The star T Puppis was accepted by Argelander as a variable star and is included in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars with that designation but is now classed as non-variable.

This variable star naming convention was developed by Friedrich W. Argelander. There is a widespread belief according to which Argelander chose the letter R for German &quot;rot&quot; or French &quot;rouge&quot;, both meaning &quot;red&quot;, because many variable stars known at that time appear red. However, Argelander&#x27;s own statement disproves this.

By 1836, even the letter S had only been used in one constellation, Serpens. With the advent of photography the number of variables piled up quickly, and variable star names soon fell into the Bayer-trap of reaching the end of the alphabet while still having stars to name. After two subsequent supplementary double-lettering systems hit similar limits, numbers were finally introduced.

As with all categories of astronomical objects, names are assigned by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The IAU delegates the task to the Sternberg Astronomical Institute and the Institute of Astronomy of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, Russia. Sternberg publishes the &quot;General Catalog of Variable Stars&quot; (), which is amended approximately once every two years by the publication of a new &quot;Name-List of Variable Stars&quot;. For example, in December 2011, the 80th &quot;Name-List of Variable Stars&quot;, Part II, was released, containing designations for 2,161 recently discovered variable stars, which brought the total number in the to 45,678 variable stars. Among the newly designated objects were V0654 Aurigae, V1367 Centauri, and BU Coronae Borealis.

<text>Vercingetorix (; ; – 46 BC) was a Gallic king and chieftain of the Arverni tribe who united the Gauls in a failed revolt against Roman forces during the last phase of Julius Caesar&#x27;s Gallic Wars. After surrendering to Caesar and spending almost six years in prison, he was executed in Rome.

Vercingetorix was the son of Celtillus the Arvernian, leader of the Gallic tribes. Vercingetorix came to power after his formal designation as chieftain of the Arverni at the oppidum Gergovia in 52 BC. He immediately established an alliance with other Gallic tribes, took command, combined all forces and led them in the Celts&#x27; most significant revolt against Roman power. He won the Battle of Gergovia against Julius Caesar in which several thousand Romans and their allies were killed and the Roman legions withdrew.

Caesar had been able to exploit Gaulish internal divisions to easily subjugate the country, since Vercingetorix&#x27;s attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late. At the Battle of Alesia, also in 52 BC, the Romans besieged and defeated his forces. To spare as many of his men as possible, he gave himself to the Romans. He was held prisoner for five years. In 46 BC, as part of Caesar&#x27;s triumph, he was paraded through the streets of Rome and then executed by garroting. Vercingetorix is primarily known through Caesar&#x27;s (Commentaries on the Gallic War). He is considered a folk hero in France, and especially in Auvergne, his native region.
== Name ==
The Gaulish name can be literally translated as &#x27;great king&#x27; or &#x27;leader of warriors&#x27;, from (&#x27;over&#x27;, &#x27;superior&#x27;) + (&#x27;warrior, hero&#x27;) + (&#x27;king&#x27;). Scholar Maigréad Ní C. Dobbs has proposed to see an Irish cognate of the name in the form . In his &quot;Life of Caesar&quot;, Plutarch renders the name as (). According to Florus, he was &quot;endowed [...] with a name which seemed to be intended to inspire terror&quot;.
==Background==
Having been appointed governor of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis (modern Provence) in 58 BC, Julius Caesar proceeded to conquer the Gallic tribes beyond over the next few years, maintaining control through a careful divide and rule strategy. He made use of the factionalism among the Gallic elites, favouring certain noblemen over others with political support and Roman luxuries such as wine. Attempts at revolt, such as that of Ambiorix in 54 BC, had secured only local support, but Vercingetorix, whose father, Celtillus, had been put to death by his own countrymen for seeking to rule all of Gaul, managed to unify the Gallic tribes against the Romans and adopted more current styles of warfare.

===Averni nobleman===
The revolt that Vercingetorix came to lead began in early 52 BC while Caesar was raising troops in Cisalpine Gaul. Believing that Caesar would be distracted by the turmoil in Rome following the death of Publius Clodius Pulcher, the Carnutes, under Cotuatus and Conetodunus, made the first move, slaughtering the Romans who had settled in their territory.

Vercingetorix, a young nobleman of the Arvernian city of Gergovia, roused his dependents to join the revolt, but he and his followers were expelled by Vercingetorix&#x27;s uncle Gobanitio and the rest of the nobles because they thought that opposing Caesar was too great a risk. Undeterred, Vercingetorix raised an army of the poor, took Gergovia, and was hailed as king.

==War with Rome==

Vercingetorix made alliances with other tribes, and in doing so he united Gaul under the pretense of escaping Roman rule. After having been unanimously given supreme command of their armies, he imposed his authority through harsh discipline and the taking of hostages. Leadership and unification on this level was unprecedented in Gaul and would not happen again for decades.

He adopted a policy of retreating to natural fortifications, and undertook an early example of a scorched earth strategy by burning towns to prevent the Roman legions from living off the land.
Vercingetorix scorched much of the land marching north with his army from Gergovia in an attempt to deprive Caesar of the resources and safe haven of the towns and villages along Caesar&#x27;s march south.

===Siege of Avaricum===
However, the capital of the Bituriges, Avaricum (near modern-day Bourges), a Gallic settlement directly in Caesar&#x27;s path, was spared. Due to the town&#x27;s strong protests, naturally defensible terrain, and apparently strong man-made reinforcing defenses, Vercingetorix decided against razing and burning it. Leaving the town to its fate, Vercingetorix camped well outside of Avaricum and focused on conducting harassing engagements of the advancing Roman units led by Caesar and his chief lieutenant Titus Labienus. Upon reaching Avaricum, however, the Romans laid siege and eventually captured the capital.

Afterwards, in a reprisal for 25 days of hunger and of laboring over the siegeworks required to breach Avaricum&#x27;s defenses, the Romans slaughtered nearly the entire population, some 40,000 people, leaving only about 800 alive.

===Battle of Gergovia===
The next major battle was at Gergovia, capital city of the Arverni. During the battle, Vercingetorix and his warriors crushed Caesar&#x27;s legions and allies, inflicting heavy losses. Vercingetorix then decided to follow Caesar but suffered heavy losses (as did the Romans and their allies) during a cavalry battle and he retreated and moved to another stronghold, Alesia.

=== Battle of Alesia ===
In the Battle of Alesia in September 52 BC, Caesar built a fortification around the city to besiege it. However, Vercingetorix had summoned his Gallic allies to attack the besieging Romans. These forces included an army of Arverni led by Vercingetorix&#x27;s cousin Vercassivellaunos and an army of 10,000 Lemovices led by Sedullos.

With the Roman circumvallation surrounded by the rest of Gaul, Caesar built another outward-facing fortification (a contravallation) against the expected relief armies, resulting in a doughnut-shaped fortification. The Gallic relief came in insufficient numbers: estimates range from 80,000 to 250,000 soldiers. Vercingetorix, the tactical leader, was cut off from them on the inside, and without his guidance the attacks were initially unsuccessful. However, the attacks did reveal a weak point in the fortifications and the combined forces on the inside and the outside almost made a breakthrough. Only when Caesar personally led the last reserves into battle did he finally manage to prevail. This was a decisive battle in the creation of the Roman Empire.
According to Plutarch, &quot;Caes&quot;. 27.8-10, Vercingetorix surrendered in a dramatic fashion, riding his beautifully adorned horse out of Alesia and around Caesar&#x27;s camp before dismounting in front of Caesar, stripping himself of his armor and sitting down at his opponent&#x27;s feet, where he remained motionless until he was taken away. Caesar provides a first-hand contradiction of this account, &quot;De Bell. Gal&quot;. 7.89, describing Vercingetorix&#x27;s surrender much more modestly.

===Imprisonment and death===

Vercingetorix was imprisoned in the Tullianum in Rome for almost six years before being publicly displayed in the first of Caesar&#x27;s four triumphs in 46 BC. He was ceremonially strangled at the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus after the triumph. A plaque in the Tullianum indicates that he was beheaded in 49 BC.

== Legacy ==
=== Memorials ===
Napoleon III erected a Vercingétorix monument in 1865, created by the sculptor Aimé Millet, on the supposed site of Alesia. The architect for the memorial was Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. The statue still stands. The inscription on the base, written by Viollet-le-Duc, which copied the famous statement of Julius Caesar, reads (in French):

Many other monumental statues of Vercingetorix were erected in France during the 19th century, including one by Frédéric Bartholdi on the Place de Jaude in Clermont-Ferrand.

=== Asteroid ===
Asteroid 52963 Vercingetorix, discovered by the OCA–DLR Asteroid Survey, was named in his honor. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 25 September 2018 ().

=== Comics ===
Vercingetorix is referenced and appears in flashbacks in several &quot;Asterix&quot; comics. &quot;Asterix and the Chieftain&#x27;s Shield&quot; is about Asterix and Obelix&#x27;s efforts to locate Vercingetorix&#x27;s missing shield and humiliate Caesar in the process.

He is the co-protagonist and title character of the 18th book in the series &quot;The Adventures of Alix&quot;.

The story of his battles against Caesar and subsequent surrender are also referenced in Classics Illustrated &quot;Caesars Conquests&quot;, which is an illustrated summation of &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Gallic Wars&quot;, written by Caesar.

=== TV ===
The 2005–2007 HBO series &quot;Rome&quot; depicts the surrender and execution of Vercingetorix.

=== Film ===
The 2001 film &quot;Druids&quot;, starring Christopher Lambert as Vercingetorix, depicts the Gallic chieftain&#x27;s struggle against Caesar. The film is infamous in France for its poor quality and dismal box office performance. The script was written by Norman Spinrad, who also authored the novelization &quot;The Druid King&quot;.

&quot;Caesar the Conqueror&quot;, a 1962 Italian movie, stars Rik Battaglia as Vercingetorix and Cameron Mitchel as Julius Caesar. The movie centers around Caesar&#x27;s battles with the Gauls as well as his political battling in Rome. The movie ends with the Battle of Alesia and Vercingetorix&#x27;s subsequent surrender.

===Opera===
Joseph Canteloube composed an opera, &quot;Vercingétorix&quot;, about the defeat of the Gauls by Julius Caesar. The libretto was by Étienne Clémentel. The Paris Opéra gave the first performance on 22 June 1933.

<doc id="32807" wikidata="Q215558" url="?curid=32807" title="Vocal cords">
<text>In humans, the vocal cords, also known as vocal folds, are folds of throat tissues that are key in creating sounds through vocalization. The length of the vocal cords affects the pitch of voice, similar to a violin string. Open when breathing and vibrating for speech or singing, the folds are controlled via the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve. They are composed of twin infoldings of mucous membrane stretched horizontally, from back to front, across the larynx. They vibrate, modulating the flow of air being expelled from the lungs during phonation.

The &#x27;true vocal cords&#x27; are distinguished from the &#x27;false vocal folds&#x27;, known as vestibular folds or &quot;ventricular folds&quot;, which sit slightly superior to the more delicate true folds. These have a minimal role in normal phonation, but can produce deep sonorous tones, screams and growls.

The length of the vocal fold at birth is approximately six to eight millimeters and grows to its adult length of eight to sixteen millimeters by adolescence. DHT, an androgen metabolite of testosterone which is secreted by the gonads, causes changes in the cartilages and musculature of the larynx when present in high enough concentrations, such as during an adolescent boy&#x27;s puberty: The thyroid prominence appears, the vocal folds lengthen and become rounded, and the epithelium thickens with the formation of three distinct layers in the lamina propria.. These changes are only partially reversible via reconstructive surgery such as chondrolaryngoplasty, feminization laryngoplasty, and laser tuning of the vocal cords.

==Structure==

=== Location ===
The vocal folds are located within the larynx at the top of the trachea. They are attached at the back to the arytenoid cartilages, and at the front to the thyroid cartilage via Broyles ligament. They are part of the glottis. Their outer edges are attached to muscle in the larynx while their inner edges form an opening called the rima glottidis. They are constructed from epithelium, but they have a few muscle-fibres in them, namely the vocalis muscle which tightens the front part of the ligament near to the thyroid cartilage. They are flat triangular bands and are pearly white in color. Above both sides of the glottis are the two vestibular folds or false vocal folds which have a small sac between them.

===False vocal folds===
The vocal folds are sometimes called &#x27;true vocal folds&#x27; to distinguish them from the &#x27;false vocal folds&#x27; known as vestibular folds or &quot;ventricular folds&quot;. These are a pair of thick folds of mucous membrane that protect and sit slightly higher to the more delicate true folds. They have a minimal role in normal phonation, but are often used to produce deep sonorous tones in Tibetan chant and Tuvan throat singing, as well as in musical screaming and the death growl vocal style.

===Microanatomy===

The vocal cords are composed of twin infoldings of 3 distinct tissues: an outer layer of flat cells that do not produce keratin (squamous epithelium). Below this is the superficial layer of the lamina propria, a gel-like layer, which allows the vocal fold to vibrate and produce sound. The vocalis and thyroarytenoid muscles make up the deepest portion. These vocal folds are covered with a mucous membrane and are stretched horizontally, from back to front, across the larynx.

===Variation===
Males and females have different vocal fold sizes. Adult male voices are usually lower-pitched due to longer and thicker folds. The male&#x27;s vocal folds are between 1.75 cm and 2.5 cm (approx 0.75&quot; to 1.0&quot;) in length, while females&#x27; vocal folds are between 1.25 cm and 1.75 cm (approx 0.5&quot; to 0.75&quot;) in length. The vocal folds of children are much shorter than those of adult males and females. The difference in vocal fold length and thickness between males and females causes a difference in vocal pitch. Additionally, genetic factors cause variations between members of the same sex, with males&#x27; and females&#x27; voices being categorized into voice types.

==Development==

===In newborns===
Newborns have a uniform single layered lamina propria, which appears loose with no vocal ligament. The monolayered lamina propria is composed of ground substances such as hyaluronic acid and fibronectin, fibroblasts, elastic fibers, and collagenous fibers. While the fibrous components are sparse, making the lamina propria structure loose, the hyaluronic acid (HA) content is high.

HA is a bulky, negatively charged glycosaminoglycan, whose strong affinity with water procures hyaluronic acid its viscoelastic and shock absorbing properties essential to vocal biomechanics. Viscosity and elasticity are critical to voice production. Chan, Gray and Titze, quantified the effect of hyaluronic acid on both the viscosity and the elasticity of vocal folds by comparing the properties of tissues with and without HA. The results showed that removal of hyaluronic acid decreased the stiffness of the vocal cords by an average of 35%, but increased their dynamic viscosity by an average of 70% at frequencies higher than 1 Hz. Newborns have been shown to cry an average of 6.7 hours per day during the first 3 months, with a sustained pitch of 400–600 Hz, and a mean duration per day of 2 hours. Similar treatment on adult vocal cords would quickly result in edema, and subsequently aphonia. Schweinfurth and al. presented the hypothesis that high hyaluronic acid content and distribution in newborn vocal cords is directly associated with newborn crying endurance. These differences in newborn vocal fold composition would also be responsible for newborns inability to articulate sounds, besides the fact that their lamina propria is a uniform structure with no vocal ligament. The layered structure necessary for phonation will start to develop during the infancy and until the adolescence.

The fibroblasts in the newborn Reinke&#x27;s space are immature, showing an oval shape, and a large nucleus-cytoplasm ratio. The rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, as shown by electron micrographs, are not well developed, indicating that the cells are in a resting phase. The collagenous and reticular fibers in the newborn the vocal cords are fewer than in the adult one, adding to the immaturity of the vocal fold tissue.

In the infant, many fibrous components were seen to extend from the macula flava towards the Reinke&#x27;s space. Fibronectin is very abundant in the Reinke&#x27;s space of newborn and infant. Fibronectin is a glycoprotein that is believed to act as a template for the oriented deposition of the collagen fibers, stabilizing the collagen fibrils. Fibronectin also acts as a skeleton for the elastic tissue formation. Reticular and collagenous fibers were seen to run along the edges of the vocal cords throughout the entire lamina propria. Fibronectin in the Reinke&#x27;s space appeared to guide those fibers and orient the fibril deposition. The elastic fibers remained sparse and immature during infancy, mostly made of microfibrils. The fibroblasts in the infant Reinke&#x27;s space were still sparse but spindle-shaped. Their rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus were still not well developed, indicating that despite the change in shape, the fibroblasts still remained mostly in a resting phase. Few newly released materials were seen adjacent to the fibroblasts. The ground substance content in the infant Reinke&#x27;s space seemed to decrease over time, as the fibrous component content increased, thus slowly changing the vocal fold structure.

===Children===
The infant lamina propria is composed of only one layer, as compared to three in the adult, and there is no vocal ligament. The vocal ligament begins to be present in children at about four years of age. Two layers appear in the lamina propria between the ages of six and twelve, and the mature lamina propria, with the superficial, intermediate and deep layers, is only present by the conclusion of adolescence. As vocal fold vibration is a foundation for vocal formants, this presence or absence of tissue layers influences a difference in the number of formants between the adult and pediatric populations. In females, the voice is three tones lower than the child&#x27;s and has five to twelve formants, as opposed to the pediatric voice with three to six.
The length of the vocal fold at birth is approximately six to eight millimeters and grows to its adult length of eight to sixteen millimeters by adolescence. The infant vocal fold is half membranous or anterior glottis, and half cartilaginous or posterior glottis. The adult fold is approximately three-fifths membranous and two-fifths cartilaginous.

===Puberty===
Puberty usually lasts from 2 to 5 years, and typically occurs between the ages of 12 and 17. During puberty, voice change is controlled by sex hormones. In females during puberty, the vocal muscle thickens slightly, but remains very supple and narrow. The squamous mucosa also differentiates into three distinct layers (the lamina propria) on the free edge of the vocal folds. The sub- and supraglottic glandular mucosa becomes hormone-dependent to estrogens and progesterone. For females, the actions of estrogens and progesterone produce changes in the extravascular spaces by increasing capillary permeability which allows the passage of intracapillary fluids to the interstitial space as well as modification of glandular secretions. Estrogens have a hypertrophic and proliferative effect on mucosa by reducing the desquamating effect on the superficial layers. The thyroid hormones also affect dynamic function of the vocal folds; (Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis affects the fluid balance in the vocal folds). Progesterone has an anti-proliferative effect on mucosa and accelerates desquamation. It causes a menstrual-like cycle in the vocal fold epithelium and a drying out of the mucosa with a reduction in secretions of the glandular epithelium. Progesterone has a diuretic effect and decreases capillary permeability, thus trapping the extracellular fluid out of the capillaries and causing tissue congestion.

Testosterone, an androgen secreted by the testes, will cause changes in the cartilages and musculature of the larynx for males during puberty, and to a lesser extent to females assigned at birth and others such as intersex individuals as well as those who are androgen deficient if they are given masculinizing hormone therapy. In females, androgens are secreted principally by the adrenal cortex and the ovaries and can have irreversible masculinizing effects if present in high enough concentration. In males, they are essential to male sexuality. In muscles, they cause a hypertrophy of striated muscles with a reduction in the fat cells in skeletal muscles, and a reduction in the whole body fatty mass. Androgens are the most important hormones responsible for the passage of the boy-child voice to adult male voice, and the change is irreversible without reconstructive surgery such as feminization laryngoplasty. The thyroid prominence, which contains the vocal cords appears, the vocal folds lengthen and become rounded, and the epithelium thickens with the formation of three distinct layers in the lamina propria. These changes are also irreversible without surgery, albeit the thyroid/laryngeal prominence, also known as an Adam&#x27;s apple can be potentially diminished via a tracheal shave or feminization laryngoplasty.

===Adulthood===
Human vocal cords are paired structures located in the larynx, just above the trachea, which vibrate and are brought in contact during phonation. The human vocal cords are roughly 12 – 24 mm in length, and 3–5 mm thick. Histologically, the human vocal cords are a laminated structure composed of five different layers. The vocalis muscle, main body of the vocal cords, is covered by the mucosa, which consists of the epithelium and the lamina propria. The latter is a pliable layer of connective tissue subdivided into three layers: the superficial layer (SL), the intermediate layer (IL), and the deep layer (DL). Layer distinction is either made looking at differential in cell content or extracellular matrix (extracellular matrix) content. The most common way being to look at the extracellular matrix content. The SLP has fewer elastic and collagenous fibers than the two other layers, and thus is looser and more pliable. The ILP is mostly composed of elastic fibers, while the DLP has fewer elastic fibers, and more collagenous fibers. In those two layers, which form what is known as the vocalis ligament, the elastic and collagenous fibers are densely packed as bundles that run almost parallel to the edge of the vocal fold.

There is a steady increase in the elastin content of the lamina propria as humans age (elastin is a yellow scleroprotein, the essential constituent of the elastic connective tissue) resulting in a decrease in the ability of the lamina propria to expand caused by cross-branching of the elastin fibers. Among other things, this leads to the mature voice being better suited to the rigors of opera.

The extracellular matrix of the vocal cord LP is composed of fibrous proteins such as collagen and elastin, and interstitial molecules such as HA, a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan. While the SLP is rather poor in elastic and collagenous fibers, the ILP and DLP are mostly composed of it, with the concentration of elastic fibers decreasing and the concentration of collagenous fibers increasing as the vocalis muscle is approached. Fibrous proteins and interstitial molecules play different roles within the extracellular matrix. While collagen (mostly type I) provides strength and structural support to the tissue, which are useful to withstanding stress and resisting deformation when subjected to a force, elastin fibers bring elasticity to the tissue, allowing it to return to its original shape after deformation. Interstitial proteins, such as HA, plays important biological and mechanical roles in the vocal cord tissue. In the vocal cord tissue, hyaluronic acid plays a role of shear-thinner, affecting the tissue viscosity, space-filler, shock absorber, as well as wound healing and cell migration promoter. The distribution of those proteins and interstitial molecules has been proven to be affected by both age and gender, and is maintained by the fibroblasts.

====Maturation====
Vocal fold structure in adults is quite different from that in newborns. Exactly how the vocal cord mature from an immature monolayer in newborns to a mature three layer tissue in adults is still unknown, however a few studies have investigated the subjects and brought some answers.

Hirano et al. previously found that the newborns did not have a true lamina propria, but instead had cellular regions called maculae flavae, located at the anterior and posterior ends of the loose vocal fold tissue. Boseley and Hartnick examined at the development and maturation of pediatric human vocal fold lamina propria. Hartnick was the first one to define each layer by a change in their cellular concentration. He also found that the lamina propria monolayer at birth and shortly thereafter was hypercellular, thus confirming Hirano&#x27;s observations. By 2 months of age, the vocal fold started differentiating into a bilaminar structure of distinct cellular concentration, with the superficial layer being less densely populated than the deeper layer. By 11 months, a three-layered structure starts to be noted in some specimens, again with different cellular population densities. The superficial layer is still hypocellular, followed by an intermediate more hypercellular layer, and a deeper hypercellular layer, just above the vocalis muscle. Even though the vocal cords seem to start organizing, this is not representative of the trilaminar structure seen in adult tissues, where the layer are defined by their differential elastin and collagen fiber compositions. By 7 years of age, all specimens show a three-layered vocal fold structure, based on cellular population densities. At this point, the superficial layer was still hypocellular, the middle layer was the hypercellular one, with also a greater content of elastin and collagen fibers, and the deeper layer was less cellularly populated. Again, the distinction seen between the layers at this stage is not comparable to that seen in the adult tissue. The maturation of the vocal cords did not appear before 13 years of age, where the layers could be defined by their differential fiber composition rather than by their differential cellular population. The pattern now show a hypocellular superficial layer, followed by a middle layer composed predominantly of elastin fiber, and a deeper layer composed predominantly of collagen fibers. This pattern can be seen in older specimens up to 17 years of age, and above. While this study offers a nice way to see the evolution from immature to mature vocal cords, it still does not explain what is the mechanism behind it.

====Macula flavae====
Maculae flavae are located at the anterior and posterior ends of the membranous parts of the vocal cords. The histological structure of the macula flava is unique, and Sato and Hirano speculated that it could play an important role in growth, development and aging of the vocal cords. The macula flava is composed of fibroblasts, ground substances, elastic and collagenous fibers. Fibroblasts were numerous and spindle or stellate-shaped. The fibroblasts have been observed to be in active phase, with some newly released amorphous materials present at their surface. From a biomechanical point of view, the role of the macula flava is very important. Hirano and Sato studies suggested that the macula flava is responsible for the synthesis of the fibrous components of the vocal cords. Fibroblasts have been found mostly aligned in the direction of the vocal ligament, along bundles of fibers. It then was suggested that the mechanical stresses during phonation were stimulating the fibroblasts to synthesize those fibers.

====Impact of phonation====
The viscoelastic properties of human vocal fold lamina propria are essential for their vibration, and depend on the composition and structure of their extracellular matrix. Adult vocal cords have a layered structure which is based on the layers differential in extracellular matrix distribution. Newborns on the other hand, do not have this layered structure. Their vocal cords are uniform, and immature, making their viscoelastic properties most likely unsuitable for phonation. Hyaluronic acid plays a very important role in the vocal fold biomechanics. In fact, hyaluronic acid has been described as the extracellular matrix molecule that not only contributes to the maintenance of an optimal tissue viscosity that allows phonation, but also of an optimal tissue stiffness that allows frequency control. CD44 is a cell surface receptor for HA. Cells such as fibroblasts are responsible for synthesizing extracellular matrix molecules. Cell surface matrix receptors in return, feed back to the cells through cell-matrix interaction, allowing the cell to regulate its metabolism.

Sato et al. carried out a histopathologic investigation of unphonated human vocal cords. Vocal fold mucosae, which were unphonated since birth, of three young adults (17, 24, and 28 years old) were looked at using light and electron microscopy. The results show that the vocal fold mucosae were hypoplastic, and rudimentary, and like newborns, did not have any vocal ligament, Reinke&#x27;s space, or layered structure. Like newborns, the lamina propria appeared as a uniform structure. Some stellate cells were present in the macula flava, but started to show some signs of degeneration. The stellate cells synthesized fewer extracellular matrix molecules, and the cytoplasmic processes were shown to be short and shrinking, suggesting a decreased activity. Those results confirm the hypothesis that phonation stimulates stellate cells into producing more extracellular matrix.

Furthermore, using a specially designed bioreactor, Titze et al. showed that fibroblasts exposed to mechanical stimulation have differing levels of extracellular matrix production from fibroblasts that are not exposed to mechanical stimulation. The gene expression levels of extracellular matrix constituents such as fibronectin, MMP1, decorin, fibromodulin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, and CD44 were altered. All those genes are involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, thus suggesting that mechanical forces applied to the tissue, alter the expression levels of extracellular matrix related genes, which in turn allow the cells present in the tissue to regulate the extracellular matrix constituent synthesis, thus affecting the tissue&#x27;s composition, structure, and biomechanical properties. In the end, cell-surface receptors close the loop by giving feedback on the surrounding extracellular matrix to the cells, affecting also their gene expression level.

====Impact of hormones====
Other studies suggest that hormones play also an important role in vocal fold maturation. Hormones are molecules secreted into the blood stream to be delivered at different targeted sites. They usually promote growth, differentiation and functionality in different organs or tissues. Their effect is due to their ability to bind to intracellular receptors, modulating the gene expression, and subsequently regulating protein synthesis. The interaction between the endocrine system and tissues such as breast, brain, testicles, heart, bones, etc., is being extensively studied. It has clearly been seen that the larynx is somewhat affected by hormonal changes, but, very few studies are working on elucidating this relationship. The effect of hormonal changes in voice is clearly seen when hearing male and female voices, or when listening to a teenage voice changing during puberty. Actually, it is believed that the number of hormonal receptors in the pre-pubertal phase is higher than in any other age. Menstruation has also been seen to influence the voice. In fact, singers are encouraged by their instructors not to perform during their pre-menstrual period, because of a drop in their voice quality.

Vocal fold phonatory functions are known to change from birth to old age. The most significant changes occur in development between birth and puberty, and in old age. Hirano et al. previously described several structural changes associated with aging, in the vocal fold tissue. Some of those changes are: a shortening of the membranous vocal fold in males, a thickening of the vocal fold mucosa and cover in females, and a development of edema in the superficial lamina propria layer in both sexes. Hammond et al. observed that the hyaluronic acid content in the vocal fold lamina propria was significantly higher in males than in females. Although all those studies did show that there are clear structural and functional changes seen in the human vocal cords which are associated with gender and age, none really fully elucidated the underlying cause of those changes. In fact, only a few recent studies started to look at the presence and role of hormone receptors in the vocal cords. Newman et al. found that hormone receptors are indeed present in the vocal cords, and show a statistical distribution difference with respect to age and gender. They have identified the presence of androgen, estrogen, and progesterone receptors in epithelial cells, granular cells and fibroblasts of the vocal cords, suggesting that some of the structural changes seen in the vocal cords could be due to hormonal influences. In this specific study, androgen and progesterone receptors were found more commonly in males than in females. In others studies, it has been suggested that the estrogen/androgen ratio be partly responsible for the voice changes observed at menopause. As previously said, Hammond et al. showed than the hyaluronic acid content was higher in male than in female vocal cords. Bentley et al. demonstrated that sex skin swelling seen in monkey was due to an increase in hyaluronic acid content, which was in fact mediated by estrogen receptors in dermal fibroblasts. An increase in collagen biosynthesis mediated by the estrogen receptors of dermal fibroblasts was also observed. A connection between hormone levels, and extracellular matrix distribution in the vocal cords depending on age and gender could be made. More particularly a connection between higher hormone levels and higher hyaluronic acid content in males could exist in the human vocal fold tissue. Although a relationship between hormone levels and extracellular matrix biosynthesis in vocal fold can be established, the details of this relationship, and the mechanisms of the influence has not been elucidated yet.

===Old age===
There is a thinning in the superficial layer of the lamina propria in old age. In aging, the vocal fold undergoes considerable sex-specific changes. In the female larynx, the vocal fold cover thickens with aging. The superficial layer of the lamina propria loses density as it becomes more edematous. The intermediate layer of the lamina propria tends to atrophy only in men. The deep layer of the lamina propria of the male vocal fold thickens because of increased collagen deposits. The vocalis muscle atrophies in both men and women. However, the majority of elderly patients with voice disorders have disease processes associated with aging rather than physiologic aging alone.

==Function==

=== Oscillation ===

The larynx is a major (but not the only) source of sound in speech, generating sound through the rhythmic opening and closing of the vocal folds. To oscillate, the vocal folds are brought near enough together such that air pressure builds up beneath the larynx. The folds are pushed apart by this increased subglottal pressure, with the inferior part of each fold leading the superior part. Such a wave-like motion causes a transfer of energy from the airflow to the fold tissues. Under the correct conditions, the energy transferred to the tissues is large enough to overcome losses by dissipation and the oscillation pattern will sustain itself. In essence, sound is generated in the larynx by chopping up a steady flow of air into little puffs of sound waves.

The perceived pitch of a person&#x27;s voice is determined by a number of different factors, most importantly the fundamental frequency of the sound generated by the larynx. The fundamental frequency is influenced by the length, size, and tension of the vocal folds. This frequency averages about 125 Hz in an adult male, 210 Hz in adult females, and over 300 Hz in children. Depth-kymography is an imaging method to visualize the complex horizontal and vertical movements of vocal folds.

The vocal folds generate a sound rich in harmonics. The harmonics are produced by collisions of the vocal folds with themselves, by recirculation of some of the air back through the trachea, or both. Some singers can isolate some of those harmonics in a way that is perceived as singing in more than one pitch at the same time—a technique called overtone singing or throat singing such as in the tradition of Tuvan throat singing.

==Clinical significance==
===Lesions===
The majority of vocal fold lesions primarily arise in the cover of the folds. Since the basal lamina secures the epithelium to the superficial layer of the lamina propria with anchoring fibers, this is a common site for injury. If a person has a phonotrauma or habitual vocal hyperfunction, also known as pressed phonation, the proteins in the basal lamina can shear, causing vocal fold injury, usually seen as nodules or polyps, which increase the mass and thickness of the cover. The squamous cell epithelium of the anterior glottis are also a frequent site of laryngeal cancer caused by smoking.

===Reinke&#x27;s edema===
A voice pathology called Reinke&#x27;s edema, swelling due to abnormal accumulation of fluid, occurs in the superficial lamina propria or Reinke&#x27;s space. This causes the vocal fold mucosa to appear floppy with excessive movement of the cover that has been described as looking like a loose sock. The greater mass of the vocal folds due to increased fluid lowers the fundamental frequency during phonation.

===Wound healing===

Wound healing is a natural regeneration process of dermal and epidermal tissue involving a sequence of biochemical events. These events are complex and can be categorized into three stages: inflammation, proliferation and tissue remodeling. The study on vocal fold wound healing is not as extensive as that on animal models due to the limited availability of human vocal folds. Vocal fold injuries can have a number of causes including chronic overuse, chemical, thermal and mechanical trauma such as smoking, laryngeal cancer, and surgery. Other benign pathological phenomena like polyps, vocal fold nodules and edema will also introduce disordered phonation.

Any injury to human vocal folds elicits a wound healing process characterized by disorganized collagen deposition and, eventually, formation of scar tissue. Verdolini and her group sought to detect and describe acute tissue response of injured rabbit vocal cord model. They quantified the expression of two biochemical markers: interleukin 1 and prostaglandin E2, which are associated with acute wound healing. They found the secretions of these inflammatory mediators were significantly elevated when collected from injured vocal cords versus normal vocal cords. This result was consistent with their previous study about the function of IL-1 and PGE-2 in wound healing. Investigation about the temporal and magnitude of inflammatory response in the vocal cords may benefit for elucidating subsequent pathological events in vocal fold wounding, which is good for clinician to develop therapeutic targets to minimize scar formation. In the proliferative phase of vocal cord wound healing, if the production of hyaluronic acid and collagen is not balanced, which means the hyaluronic acid level is lower than normal, the fibrosis of collagen cannot be regulated. Consequently, regenerative-type wound healing turns to be the formation of scar. Scarring may lead to the deformity of vocal fold edge, the disruption of lipopolysaccharides viscosity and stiffness. Patients suffering from vocal fold scar complain about increased phonatory effort, vocal fatigue, breathlessness, and dysphonia. Vocal fold scar is one of the most challenging problems for otolaryngologists because it is hard to be diagnosed at germinal stage and the function necessity of vocal cords is delicate.

==Terminology==
The vocal folds are commonly referred to as &quot;vocal cords&quot;, and less commonly as &quot;vocal flaps&quot; or &quot;vocal bands&quot;. The term &quot;vocal cords&quot; was coined by the French anatomist Antoine Ferrein in 1741. In his violin analogy of the human voice, he postulated that the moving air acted like a bow on . The alternative spelling in English is &quot;vocal chords&quot;, possibly due to the musical connotations or to confusion with the geometrical definition of the word &quot;chord&quot;. While both spellings have historical precedents, standard American spelling is &quot;cords&quot;. According to the Oxford English Corpus, a database of 21st-century texts that contains everything from academic journal articles to unedited writing and blog entries, contemporary writers opt for the nonstandard &quot;chords&quot; instead of &quot;cords&quot; 49% of the time. The &quot;cords&quot; spelling is also standard in the United Kingdom and Australia.

In phonetics, &quot;vocal folds&quot; is preferred over &quot;vocal cords&quot;, on the grounds that it is more accurate and illustrative.

<text>Västerås Municipality (&quot;Västerås kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Västmanland County in central Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Västerås.

The municipality prefers to use the denomination &quot;Västerås stad&quot; (&quot;City of Västerås&quot;) for the whole territory, including rural areas.

The municipality evolved gradually during the municipal reforms in Sweden. Most of the amalgamations took place in 1967 and the municipality in its present form was created in 1971. There are 30 original local government units within the present municipality.

== Localities ==
As of 2018, there were 17 localities in the municipality:

<text>Volapük (; , &#x27;Language of the World&#x27;, or lit. &#x27;World Speak&#x27;) is a constructed language created in 1879 and 1880 by Johann Martin Schleyer, a Roman Catholic priest in Baden, Germany, who believed that God told him to create an international language. Notable as the first major constructed international auxiliary language, the grammar comes from European languages and the vocabulary mostly from English (with some German and French). However, the roots are often distorted beyond recognition.

Volapük conventions took place in 1884 (Friedrichshafen), 1887 (Munich) and 1889 (Paris). The first two conventions used German, and the last conference used only Volapük. By 1889, there were an estimated 283 clubs, 25 periodicals in or about Volapük, and 316 textbooks in 25 languages; at that time the language claimed nearly a million adherents. Volapük was largely displaced between the late 19th and early 20th century by Esperanto.

==History==

Schleyer first published a sketch of Volapük in May 1879 in &quot;Sionsharfe&quot;, a Catholic poetry magazine of which he was editor. This was followed in 1880 by a full-length book in German. Schleyer himself did not write books on Volapük in other languages, but other authors soon did.

André Cherpillod writes of the third Volapük convention,

The Dutch cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoffs was for a number of years Director of the Academy of Volapük, and introduced the movement to several countries.
The French Association for the Propagation of Volapük was authorized on 8 April 1886, with A. Lourdelet as president and a central committee that included the deputy Edgar Raoul-Duval.
However, tensions arose between Kerckhoffs and others in the Academy, who wanted reforms made to the language, and Schleyer, who insisted strongly on retaining his proprietary rights. This led to schism, with much of the Academy abandoning Schleyer&#x27;s Volapük in favor of Idiom Neutral and other new constructed language projects. Another reason for the decline of Volapük may have been the rise of Esperanto. In 1887 the first Esperanto book (&quot;Unua Libro&quot;) was published. Many Volapük clubs became Esperanto clubs.

By 1890 the movement was in disarray, with violent arguments among the members. Schleyer resigned from the Volapük Academy and created a rival academy. Derived languages such as Nal Bino, Balta, Bopal, Spelin, Dil and Orba were invented and quickly forgotten.
In the 1920s, Arie de Jong, with the consent of the leaders of the small remnant of Volapük speakers, made a revision of Volapük which was published in 1931 (now called &quot;Volapük Nulik&quot; &quot;New Volapük&quot; as opposed to the Volapük Rigik &#x27;Original Volapük&#x27; of Schleyer). This revision was accepted by the few speakers of the language. De Jong simplified the grammar, eliminating some rarely used verb forms, and eliminated some gendered pronouns and gendered verb endings. He also rehabilitated the phoneme and used it to make some morphemes more recognizable. For instance, &quot;lömib&quot; &quot;rain&quot; became &quot;rein&quot;.
Volapük enjoyed a brief renewal of popularity in the Netherlands and Germany under de Jong&#x27;s leadership, but was suppressed (along with other constructed languages) in countries under Nazi rule and never recovered.

Regarding the success of this constructed language, the Spanish scientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal wrote in the first edition of his &quot;Tonics of Willingness&quot;, in 1898:
However, some years later (1920), in the third edition of the same book, he added the following footnote to the former assertion: &quot;As it was presumable, nowadays -1920-, the brand new Volapük has been forgotten definitively. We forecast the same for Esperanto.&quot;

Large Volapük collections are held by the International Esperanto Museum in Vienna, Austria; the Center for Documentation and Study about the International Language in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland; and the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
In 2000 there were an estimated 20 Volapük speakers in the world.

In December 2007 it was reported that the Volapük version of Wikipedia had recently jumped to 15th place among language editions, with more than 112,000 articles.
A few months earlier there had been only 797 articles. The massive increase in the size of &quot;Vükiped&quot;, bringing it ahead of the Esperanto Wikipedia, was due to an enthusiast who had used a computer program to automatically create geographical articles, many on small villages. The motive was to gain visibility for the language.
By March 2013 the Esperanto Wikipedia, with a very active user community, had risen to 176,792 articles, while the Volapük Wikipedia had at that point 119,091 articles.

There has been a continuous Volapük speaker community since Schleyer&#x27;s time, with an unbroken succession of &quot;Cifals&quot; (leaders). These were:
# Johann Martin Schleyer 1879–1912
# Albert Sleumer 1912–1948
# Arie de Jong (provisionally) 1947–1948, 1951–1957
# Jakob Sprenger 1948–1950
# Johann Schmidt 1950–1977
# Johann Krüger 1977–1983
# Brian Bishop 1984–2014
# Hermann Philipps 2014–present

==Orthography and phonology==
The phonology of Volapük is as follows:

Additionally, ⟨x⟩ represents the sequence //. The letters C, J, S and Z are pronounced voiced after voiced consonants and unvoiced otherwise.

There are no diphthongs; each vowel letter is pronounced separately.

The letters &quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot;, and &quot;ü&quot; do not have alternative forms such as the &quot;ae&quot;, &quot;oe&quot;, and &quot;ue&quot; of German, but Schleyer proposed alternate forms &quot;ꞛ&quot;, &quot;ꞝ&quot;, and &quot;ꞟ&quot; for them, all of which are part of Unicode since version 7.0 released in June 2014:

===Special consonantal letters===
The author Alfred A. Post mentions in his &quot;Comprehensive Volapük Grammar&quot; some additional letters created by Schleyer:

:And the following letters are constructed by the inventor to designate sounds which occasionally occur –

===Letter &quot;r&quot;===

Modern Volapük has minimal &quot;l–r&quot; pairs such as &quot;rel&quot; &quot;religion&quot; versus &quot;lel&quot; &quot;iron&quot;.

===Stress===
Polysyllabic words are always stressed on the final vowel; for example, &quot;neai&quot; &quot;never&quot; is pronounced . Exceptionally, the question clitic &quot;-li&quot; does not shift the stress of the word it attaches to. When words are compounded together, secondary stress is retained on the final syllables of the compounded elements, as long as that doesn&#x27;t result in adjacent stressed syllables.

==Vocabulary==
Schleyer adapted the vocabulary mostly from English, with a smattering of German and French. Some words remain readily recognizable for a speaker of one of the source languages, but many others are modified beyond easy recognition. For instance, &quot;vol&quot; and &quot;pük&quot; are derived from the English words &quot;world&quot; and &quot;speak&quot;. Although unimportant linguistically, and regardless of the simplicity and consistency of the stress rule, these deformations were greatly mocked by the language&#x27;s detractors. It seems to have been Schleyer&#x27;s intention, however, to alter its loan words in such a way that they would be hard to recognise, thus losing their ties to the languages (and, by extension, nations) from which they came. Conversely, Esperanto and Interlingua are commonly criticized as being much easier to learn for Europeans than for those with non-European native languages.

==Grammar==
The grammar is based on that of typical European languages, but with an agglutinative character: grammatical inflections are indicated by stringing together separate affixes for each element of meaning.

===Nouns===
Nouns inflect for case and number, but not for gender.

The following is the declension of the Volapük word &quot;vol&quot; &quot;world&quot;:

As in German, the Volapük noun has four cases: nominative, genitive, dative and accusative. In compound words, the first part of the compound is usually separated from the second by the genitive termination &quot;-a&quot;, e.g. &quot;Vola-pük&quot;, &quot;of-world language&quot;: &quot;language of the world&quot;. However, the other case endings (&quot;-e&quot; dative, &quot;-i&quot; accusative) are sometimes used if applicable, or the roots may be agglutinated in the nominative, with no separating vowel.

===Adjectives and adverbs===
Adjectives, formed by the suffix &quot;-ik&quot;, normally follow the noun they qualify. They do not agree with the noun in number and case in that position, but they do if they precede the noun, are separated from it by intervening words, or stand alone. Adverbs are formed by suffixing &quot;-o&quot;, either to the root or to the adjectival &quot;-ik&quot; (&quot;gudik&quot; &quot;good&quot;, &quot;gudiko&quot; &quot;well&quot;); they normally follow the verb or adjective they modify.

===Pronouns===
The pronouns begin with &quot;o-.&quot; In the singular, they are &quot;ob&quot; &quot;I&quot;, &quot;ol&quot; &quot;thou&quot;, &quot;om&quot; &quot;he/it&quot;, &quot;of&quot; &quot;she&quot;, &quot;os&quot; (impersonal), &quot;on&quot; &quot;one&quot;, &quot;ok&quot; &quot;oneself&quot;. They are pluralized with &quot;-s&quot;: &quot;obs&quot; &quot;we&quot;, &quot;ols&quot; &quot;ye&quot;, &quot;oms&quot; &quot;they&quot;. The possessive may be formed with either the genitive &quot;-a&quot; or with adjectival &quot;-ik&quot;: &quot;oba&quot; or &quot;obik&quot; &quot;my&quot;. Prepositions, conjunctions and interjections are also formed from noun roots by appending appropriate suffixes. In later, reformed Volapük, &quot;om&quot; was narrowed down to males only, whereas &quot;on&quot; got the meaning of &#x27;it&#x27; as well as impersonal &#x27;they&#x27;.

===Verbs===
The verb carries a fine degree of detail, with morphemes marking tense, aspect, voice, person, number and (in the third person) the subject&#x27;s gender. However, many of these categories are optional, and a verb can stand in an unmarked state. A Volapük verb can be conjugated in 1,584 ways (including infinitives and reflexives).

;Person
For the simple present, the pronouns are suffixed to the verb stem:
:&quot;binob&quot; I am, &quot;binol&quot; thou art,
etc. The present passive takes the prefix &quot;pa-&quot;:
:&quot;palöfons&quot; they are loved.

;Tense, aspect, and voice
The three tenses in the indicative, and the three perfect aspects, each take a characteristic vowel prefix:

The present-tense prefix is omitted in the active voice, so:
:&quot;binob&quot; I am, &quot;äbinol&quot; you were, &quot;ebinom&quot; he has been, &quot;ibinof&quot; she had been, &quot;obinos&quot; it will be, &quot;ubinon&quot; one will have been.

These are seen as being more distant from the present tense the further the vowel is from in vowel space, and they can be used with temporal words to indicate distance in the past or future. For example, from &quot;del&quot; &#x27;day&#x27;,
:&quot;adelo&quot; today, &quot;odelo&quot; tomorrow, &quot;udelo&quot; the day after tomorrow, &quot;ädelo&quot; yesterday, &quot;edelo&quot; the day before yesterday, &quot;idelo&quot; three days ago.

The passive voice is formed with &quot;p-&quot;, and here the &quot;a&quot; is required for the present tense:
:&quot;palöfob&quot; I am loved, &quot;pälogol&quot; you were seen, &quot;pologobs&quot; we will be seen.

;Infinitive mood
The infinitive is formed with the suffix &quot;-ön&quot;. It can be combined with tense/aspect prefixes:
:&quot;Logön&quot; to see, &quot;elogön&quot; to have seen.

;Interrogative mood
Yes–no questions are indicated with the particle &quot;li&quot;:
:&quot;Pälogom-li&quot; was he seen?
The hyphen indicates that the syllable &quot;li&quot; does not take stress. It occurs before the verb to avoid a sequence of three consonants or a double el: &quot;li-pälogol? li-binoms?&quot;

;Participles and the habitual aspect
Participles, both active and passive, are formed in &quot;-öl&quot;:
:&quot;Logöl&quot; seeing, &quot;elogöl&quot; having seen, &quot;ologöl&quot; being about to see, &quot;palogöl&quot; seen (being seen), &quot;pelogöl&quot; seen (having been seen), &quot;pologöl&quot; about to be seen.
&quot;Binob penöl&quot; is literally &#x27;I am writing&#x27;, though &quot;penob&quot; is also used. For &quot;I write&quot; as habitual action, the habitual aspect is used. This is formed by adding &quot;-i-&quot; after the tense prefix, and here again the present-tense &quot;a-&quot; is required. The forms are thus active &quot;ai-, äi-, ei-, ii-, oi-, ui-,&quot; passive &quot;pai-, päi-, pei-, pii-, poi-, pui-.&quot; All are pronounced as two syllables.
:&quot;Aifidob bodi&quot; I eat bread (as a daily occurrence), &quot;äipenob penedis&quot; I used to write letters.
With temporal words,
:&quot;aidelo&quot; daily (at the present time)

;The imperative moods
The imperative &quot;-öd&quot; follows the person suffix:
:&quot;Gololöd!&quot; Go! (to one person), &quot;gololsöd!&quot; go! (to more than one person)

Optative &quot;-ös&quot; is used for courteous requests, and jussive &quot;-öz&quot; an emphatic command.

;Conditional mood
Conditionals are formed with &quot;-la&quot; for the protasis (&quot;if&quot;-clause) and &quot;-öv&quot; for the apodosis (&quot;then&quot;-clause):
: &quot;If äbinob-la liegik, äbinoböv givik&quot; – if I were rich I would be generous.
: &quot;Ibinomöv givik, if ibinom-la liegik&quot; – he would have been generous if he had been rich.

Note that the tense changes as well, so that in the first example the past tense is used even though the present tense is intended. Like the question particle, the &quot;-la&quot; is written with a hyphen to indicate that it is not stressed in speech.

;Potential mood
A potential mood is formed with &quot;-öx&quot;:
:&quot;Pelomöx&quot; he might pay.

;Reflexive verbs
Reflexive forms are made from the active voice and the pronoun &quot;ok&quot;:
:&quot;Vatükob&quot; I wash, &quot;vatükobok&quot; (or &quot;vatükob obi&quot;) I wash myself.
In the third person, the periphrastic form of &quot;vatükomok&quot; (he washes himself) must use the reflexive pronoun, &quot;vatükom oki&quot;, as &quot;vatükom omi&quot; would mean &quot;he washes him (someone else)&quot;.

The plural &quot;-s&quot; may precede or follow the reflexive, as the speaker chooses:
:&quot;vatükomoks&quot; or &quot;vatükomsok&quot; they wash themselves.
Here there is a meaningful distinction between joining the pronoun to the verb, and inflecting it independently:
:&quot;Löfobsok&quot; we love ourselves, &quot;löfobs obis&quot; we love each other.

;Gerundive
The gerundive arguments are active &quot;ö-&quot;, passive &quot;pö-&quot;.

==Examples==
===The Lord&#x27;s Prayer===
==Usage as common noun==
The word &quot;Volapük&quot; or a variation thereof means &quot;nonsense, gibberish&quot; in certain languages, such as Danish &quot;&quot; and Esperanto &quot;&quot;.

In Russian, the term &quot;Volapuk encoding&quot; refers to writing Cyrillic letters with the Latin alphabet based on what they look like, for example writing instead of волапюк.

<text>Vibranium () is a fictional metal appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, noted for its extraordinary abilities to absorb, store, and release large amounts of kinetic energy. Mined only in the kingdom of Wakanda, the metal is associated with the character Black Panther, who wears a suit of vibranium, and Captain America, who bears a vibranium/steel alloy shield. An alternate form of the material, known as Antarctic Vibranium, or Anti-Metal, has appeared in the Savage Land.

==Publication history==
Vibranium first appeared in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #13 (February 1966), which was written by Stan Lee and layouts by Jack Kirby with finished art by John Romita. Here, vibranium was seen to be an unusual metallic element with decidedly strange properties. Since that point in Marvel Comics continuity, it has been established that there are a few variations of this element which can be found in isolated regions all around the world. The variation first introduced in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #13 eventually became known as Anti-Metal. This variation is different in that it can cut through any known metal. In the Marvel Universe, Anti-Metal can traditionally be found only in Antarctica. Later in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #53 (August 1966), by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, a new variation of vibranium was introduced in the isolated nation of Wakanda. This variation had the unique attribute of being able to absorb sound. This is the variation which is most often identified in continuity as simply &quot;vibranium&quot;.

==Fictional history==
In the Marvel Universe, vibranium was first deposited on Earth by a meteorite 10,000 years ago. In the comics, the first documented discovery of vibranium was during a human expedition to Antarctica. This particular isotope of vibranium was called &quot;Anti-Metal&quot; due to its property of dissolving other metals.

In the comics, a different variety of vibranium found in Wakanda absorbs sound waves and other vibrations, including kinetic energy. Absorbing sound waves, vibrations, and kinetic energy makes this metal stronger. To protect this resource, Wakandans concealed their country from the outside world. Wakandan king T&#x27;Chaka funded his country&#x27;s education by occasionally selling off minuscule quantities of the metal. As a result, Wakanda is one of the world&#x27;s most technologically advanced nations.
During the early 1940s, a small amount of Wakandan vibranium came into the possession of the scientist Myron MacLain. He tried to combine vibranium with iron to form a new tank armor, but was unable to fuse the elements. One morning, he found that the two materials had bonded on their own in an unknown manner. The ultra-resilient alloy was used to create Captain America&#x27;s shield. MacLain worked for decades (without success) to duplicate the accident. However, during an experiment in the 1960s, he developed the virtually indestructible metal adamantium.
When T&#x27;Challa became the king of Wakanda, he strove to end his country&#x27;s isolation from the rest of the world. Making the existence of vibranium known to the outside world around the mid-1980s, he sold small quantities of it to foreigners who, he believed, would not use it to harmful ends. T&#x27;Challa used the profits to enrich and modernize his nation.
Over the years, many have tried to obtain or affect the mound of vibranium at Wakanda, but for the most part Wakanda has kept it safe, and become quite powerful in the process.

During the Secret Invasion of Earth, the Skrulls assumed the identity of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and enslaved natives of the Savage Land to mine Anti-Metal. They also invaded Wakanda. The Wakandans successfully repelled the attack.
When Wakanda was politically overtaken by the xenophobic Desturi, they granted Doctor Doom access to the country&#x27;s vibranium vaults. Fearing Doom would use it to amplify his mystical energies, T&#x27;Challa activated a failsafe he had developed that rendered all processed vibranium inert.

The rumors about its alien origin had later been proven true, as while most of earth&#x27;s vibranium had been all but liquidated, certain planetary systems carry an ample supply of the element deep within certain extraterrestrial biospheres, as was the case with a refugee planet that the Spartax Empire tried reclaiming during Captain Marvel&#x27;s space travels. In the wake of the continuity-wide spanning reboot of the Marvel multiverse chronicled in &quot;Secret Wars: Battleworld&quot;, vibranium&#x27;s abundance in Wakanda and beyond has re-flourished to sizable quantities, and the mutant criminal Vanisher was absconding and selling Wakandan vibranium on the black market in New York City.

When a small sub-molecular imperfection was introduced into Captain America&#x27;s shield, each impact over the years spread to neighboring molecules. It grew until the molecular bonds of the shield were completely broken down, shattering the shield. The shattering effect continued to spread to other vibranium, unconnected to the shield. This created a vibranium &quot;cancer&quot;, a shock wave propagating throughout the world. It violently detonated any vibranium it found, from mineral deposits to components of ships or equipment. The shock wave was traveling to the &quot;Great Vibranium Mound&quot; in Wakanda, where the resulting explosion could destroy the world. With the unwitting aid of the villain Klaw, Captain America was able to stop the cancer and restore his shield.

==Properties and known abilities==
In the Marvel Comics Universe, vibranium is a rare metallic substance of extraterrestrial origin. It exists in many forms:

===Wakandan variety===
Wakandan Vibranium is the most common variety, and is often referred to simply as &quot;vibranium&quot;. It is a rare substance only found in Wakanda.

The Wakandan isotope possesses the ability to absorb all vibrations in the vicinity as well as kinetic energy directed at it. The energy absorbed is stored within the bonds between the molecules that make up the substance. As a result, kinetic energy is dissipated within the bonds instead. There are limits to the capacity of the energy that can be stored, and although the exact limitations are not yet known, there have been a few examples. One such instance was when the Roxxon Energy Corporation discovered that a small island in the South Atlantic had a foundation composed of vibranium. Due to this, Roxxon found it necessary to destroy the island with explosives. Unable to absorb the force of the explosions, the vibranium was destroyed, but it succeeded in entirely absorbing the sound made by the explosion, preventing damage to the surrounding area.

This variety of vibranium is also a powerful mutagen. Vibranium exposure led to the mutation of many Wakandan natives. Its radiation has also permeated much of Wakanda&#x27;s flora and fauna, including the Heart-Shaped Herb eaten by members of the Black Panther Tribe and the flesh of the White Gorilla eaten by the members of the White Gorilla Tribe. Both give superhuman abilities to whoever eats them.

It is also believed to dramatically enhance mystical energies.

===Antarctic variety===
Better known as Anti-Metal, this isotope is native to the Savage Land. The variation produces vibrations of a specific wavelength that break down molecular bonds in other metals, causing them to liquefy. It was first discovered by explorer Robert Plunder, the father of Kevin and Parnival Plunder. Wakandan vibranium can be transformed into Antarctic vibranium through exposure to certain kinds of radiation.

Much like Wakandan vibranium, Antarctic vibranium can cause human mutations. One person who donned an Anti-Metal full body suit for protection against Moon Knight began to emit the same radiation he had intended to weaponize.

===Artificial variety===
There are at least two forms of man-made vibranium created outside of Wakanda through various means. The first variant is called NuForm, which featured in the Vibranium Vendetta event of Marvel Comics imprint, created by the Roxxon Corporation for unknown reasons. It possesses the properties of Wakandan vibranium but tends to degrade into Antarctic vibranium unless tempered with microwave radiation.

The second is Reverbium, a dangerous artificial brand created at Horizon Labs by Professor Sajani Jaffrey. Unlike standard vibranium, it rapidly amplifies sound energy before exploding. Max Modell, head scientist of Horizon, ordered it to be destroyed, but Jaffrey held on to some of it without her team&#x27;s knowledge. Reverbium would turn up again in the hands of A.I.M. under the influence of Klaw, who used it to enhance his powers.

===Living variety===
Famed Wakandan scientist and Wakanda University professor Obinna Nwabueze discovered a new form of vibranium in the Echo Chamber, a cave used for training by the Dora Milaje. This variety of Vibranium possesses limited sentience and can attune itself to the environment to cause a variety of effects.

==Uses==

Vibranium appears frequently in the Marvel Universe.

* It is most known for being used in the construction of Captain America&#x27;s shield, the vibranium was of an ultra-resilient vibranium-iron alloy created by Dr. Myron MacLain. The formula has never been reproduced despite numerous attempts.
* After Steve Rogers resigned as Captain America, the Black Panther sent him a new, pure vibranium shield. When Rogers resumed his role as Captain America, the vibranium shield was given to U.S. Agent.
* As U.S. Agent, John Walker has also used two other vibranium shields: the &quot;eagle shield&quot; he used as a member of the Jury, and the &quot;star shield&quot; he used as a member of the New Invaders.
* The Black Panther uses vibranium in a micro weave mesh in his costume that robs incoming objects of their momentum. He also cannot be stabbed, although the costume and the Black Panther can be cut if the attacker slashes along the uniform&#x27;s grain. Beyond that he uses vibranium in the soles of his boots that allows him to survive a fall of several stories and, if given enough momentum, the Panther can also scale walls or skim across water. The field can also be used offensively to shatter or weaken objects, such as kicking something with the boots. He also used the other variety Anti-Metal, in retractable claws.
* By 1915, human expeditions discovered Anti-Metal in Antarctica.
* The story &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;, which happens during World War II, tells how Black Panther, Captain America, Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos fight the Nazis who want to steal vibranium from the Wakandans.
* Skrulls enslaved Savage Land natives to mine Anti-Metal.
* Dr. Myron MacLain created &quot;true&quot; adamantium in an attempt to reproduce the vibranium alloy he had made for Captain America&#x27;s shield.
* Parnival Plunder, the villainous brother of Ka-Zar, planned to use vibranium to make weapons with which to take over the world.
* Diablo became the ruler of Tierra del Maiz, a South American country known for its large deposits of vibranium. While the United Nations had decided not to get involved in the internal affairs of the country, Canada thought differently and sent Alpha Flight to intervene.
* When Dr. Doom gained access to Wakanda&#x27;s stores of vibranium, T&#x27;Challa activated a fail-safe that rendered all processed vibranium inert.
* Both Vibranium compounds were processed by Jack O&#x27;Lantern and Crime Master, then given to Nrosvekistanian weapons manufacturer in Eastern Europe for arsenalization purposes. 
* Captain Marvel discovered Vibranium is in fact alien in origin during a Spartax lethally poisoning Mining &amp; smuggling Op.
* Vibranium in Wakanda and worldwide has been restored after events of Battleworld.

==In other media==
===Marvel Cinematic Universe===
Vibranium (also known as Isipho) appears in live-action films set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. First appearing and named on-screen in &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot;, Howard Stark states the element is stronger than steel, weighs one third as much, and is completely Vibration-absorbent. Having acquired enough to make a shield, Steve Rogers uses it when he becomes Captain America. In &quot;The Avengers&quot;, Captain America&#x27;s shield proves strong enough to absorb and repel an attack from Thor&#x27;s mystical hammer Mjölnir, and in &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot;, it is also shown to be able to cushion falls from great heights. In &quot;&quot;, Ultron uses vibranium obtained from Ulysses Klaue for multiple purposes, including the creation of the synthezoid Vision. In &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;, T&#x27;Challa utilizes a suit composed of a Vibranium weave. In the character&#x27;s self-titled film, it is revealed that T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s home nation of Wakanda was built atop the crash site of a Vibranium meteor centuries ago, with the metal being used to create and power the nation&#x27;s advanced technology. The element also affects organic life, as it is used to stabilize Everett Ross&#x27; gunshot wound and is what gives the Heart-Shaped Herb its potency. In &quot;&quot;, T&#x27;Challa gives Bucky Barnes a new prosthetic arm made completely of Vibranium. In &quot;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&quot;, a mix of Vibranium and plant life cause the people of Yucatán to gain underwater abilities and form the kingdom of Talokan which was eventually led by Namor, among using its properties for weapons and an artificial sun.

In the TV series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; episodes &quot;Love in the Time of Hydra&quot;, &quot;One Door Closes&quot;, and &quot;Afterlife&quot;, Bruce Banner built a cabin called the &quot;Retreat&quot; for S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s use out of Vibranium to temporarily house gifted individuals.

===Television===
* Vibranium appears in the &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; episode &quot;The X-Men Adventure&quot;. The villain Cyberiad captures the X-Men in the Danger Room with traps designed to utilize their greatest weaknesses. In particular, he trapped Kitty Pryde in a room made of Vibranium to counteract her intangibility.
* Vibranium appears in &quot;Iron Man: Armored Adventures&quot;. This version of the element is depicted as a dark grey metal that emits green electricity. In the episode &quot;Panther&#x27;s Prey&quot;, Iron Man and Black Panther work to stop Moses Magnum from selling stolen Vibranium to A.I.M., which the latter would later use to bring MODOK to life in the episode &quot;Designed Only for Chaos&quot;. In the episodes &quot;Line of Fire&quot; and &quot;Titanium vs. Iron&quot;, Justin Hammer and Mr. Fix acquire Vibranium to fuse it with titanium and create an alloy for the former&#x27;s Titanium Man armor.
* Vibranium appears in &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot;. This version is depicted as a purple metal that vibrates when sound is applied to it as well as glow brighter the more sound is applied until it reaches its limit and explodes. It also has mutagenic properties, as it turned Klaw into a being of pure sound energy, and is mined from a large cave in a mountain near the Wakandan capital.
* Vibranium appears in &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2010).
* Vibranium appears in &quot;Marvel Future Avengers&quot;. The element is a critical component of the &quot;Emerald Rain Project&quot;, a scheme by Kang the Conqueror and the Masters of Evil to reverse-engineer Terrigen Crystals and create controllable superhumans. Due to overmining of the mineral in his future, Kang is forced to travel back to the 21st century to obtain vibranium samples necessary for the project&#x27;s completion.

===Film===
* Vibranium appears in the &quot;Marvel Animated Features&quot; series of films.
** In &quot;Ultimate Avengers: The Movie&quot;, the Chitauri use Vibranium in their spacecraft hulls and personal armor. S.H.I.E.L.D. later salvages one of their ships and use it as component of Captain America&#x27;s shield as well as use it in other items such as bullets and knives. They also determined that only nuclear blasts and Vibranium itself is capable of penetrating Vibranium. The organization also developed the satellite &quot;Shield 1&quot; to locate Vibranium anywhere on Earth and locate the Chitauri, though the aliens destroyed it.
** In &quot;Ultimate Avengers 2: Rise of the Panther&quot;, the Chitauri invade Wakanda for their subterranean supply of Vibranium. In this film, the element is portrayed as a substantial power source, as the Chitauri utilize condensed Vibranium cubes to power their spaceships. It is also the principal component of many Wakandan weapons and can be weakened by gamma radiation as well as gamma-powered individuals such as the Hulk.

===Video games===
Vibranium appears in &quot;&quot;. A nanite-based artificial intelligence known as &quot;the Fold&quot; attempts to harvest Vibranium in Wakanda in order to construct communication towers around the world, spreading its control signal globally. While the heroes manage to thwart the invasion, they are unable to prevent the Fold from constructing enough towers to make it a global threat.

===Music===
Vibranium is referenced in the 2019 single &quot;Take Me Back to London&quot; by Ed Sheeran (featuring Stormzy).

It is also referenced in the bridge of the 2020 track &quot;Love Is a War&quot; by Jeremy Renner, who played Hawkeye in several Marvel Cinematic Universe films. The line is &quot;To hit me harder, I feel nothing / And all my armor is vibranium&quot;.

It is referenced again in the 2021 song &quot;Titanium&quot; by Dave in the 5th verse stating &quot;You get hit with a stick, Black Panther You&#x27;re gonna need Vibranium I got stainless steel, I got platinum I got gold and I got titanium&quot;.

==Real-world material==
In 2016, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies developed a real-world smart composite material that they named Vibranium. The lightweight carbon fiber material for the Hyperloop pods is reported to provide the passengers double protection against damage to the exterior. The company says that its Vibranium is 8 times lighter than aluminum and 10 times stronger than steel alternatives. The smart material can transmit critical information regarding temperature, stability, integrity and more, wirelessly and virtually instantly.

Journalists have drawn parallels between Wakanda&#x27;s vibranium reserves and the mining of coltan in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Coltan is an ore containing niobium and tantalum, two rare and valuable metals, and its exploitation is linked with child-labor, systematic exploitation of the population by governments or militant groups, exposure to toxic chemicals and other hazards; see coltan mining and ethics. Historian Thomas F. McDow draws a parallel to uranium, found in the mine Shinkolobwe in Haut-Katanga Province, also in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

== Scholarly analysis ==
The concept of vibranium as an extremely valuable material, monopolized and mastered by the African civilization of Wakanda, has been subject to scholarly analysis. Several studies have looked at it from the perspective of cultural studies and literary criticism, including tying it to the genre of afrofuturism. Alessio Gerola noted in the context of the 2018 film &quot;Black Panther&quot;, that &quot;Fundamental disagreements about vibranium’s existence and use drive the film’s plot, but the mythology and history of vibranium are even more essential to understanding how and why characters like Klaue, Killmonger, T&#x27;Challa, and Shuri treat vibranium the way they do&quot;, concluding that &quot;Vibranium, from a narrative point of view, simply represents the power of possibilities and the disagreements that arise about the “great responsibilities” that follow from such “great powers”.

It has been also analyzed with regards to its physical properties as a type of supermaterial. In 2017 Mark J. Whiting concluded that vibranium, as described in fiction, is not unrealistic, and resembles &quot;a high-entropy shape-memory alloy composite, reinforced with a ceramic&quot;, beyond the ability of our current material science to produce, but not beyond the ability of our current theoretical science to explain. It has been suggested that the popular culture impact of this material can make it useful as a teaching-aid when attempting to interest students in material science and related fields.

<text>The Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey is an American multi-use, tiltrotor military transport and cargo aircraft with both vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. The V-22 is operated by the United States and Japan, and is not only a new aircraft design, but a new type of aircraft that entered service in the 2000s, a tiltrotor compared to fixed wing and helicopter designs. The V-22 first flew in 1989 and after a long development was fielded in 2007. The design combines the vertical takeoff ability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a fixed-wing airplane.

The failure of Operation Eagle Claw in 1980 during the Iran hostage crisis underscored that there were military roles for which neither conventional helicopters nor fixed-wing transport aircraft were well-suited. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) initiated a program to develop an innovative transport aircraft with long-range, high-speed, and vertical-takeoff capabilities, and the Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) program officially began in 1981. A partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft. The Bell-Boeing team jointly produces the aircraft. The V-22 first flew in 1989 and began flight testing and design alterations; the complexity and difficulties of being the first tiltrotor for military service led to many years of development.

The United States Marine Corps (USMC) began crew training for the MV-22B Osprey in 2000 and fielded it in 2007; it supplemented and then replaced their Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knights. The U.S. Air Force (USAF) fielded its version of the tiltrotor, the CV-22B, in 2009. Since entering service with the Marine Corps and Air Force, the Osprey has been deployed in transportation and medevac operations over Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Kuwait. The U.S. Navy began using the CMV-22B for carrier onboard delivery duties in 2021.

==Development==
===Origins===
The failure of Operation Eagle Claw, the Iran hostage rescue mission, in 1980 demonstrated to the U.S. military a need for &quot;a new type of aircraft, that could not only take off and land vertically but also could carry combat troops, and do so at speed.&quot; Additionally, a concentrated force is vulnerable to a single nuclear weapon. Airborne solutions with high speed and range allow for their rapid dispersal to reduce this vulnerability. The U.S. Department of Defense began the JVX aircraft program in 1981, under U.S. Army leadership.
The established tactical purpose of the USMC is to perform an amphibious landing, which the JVX program promised to facilitate. The USMC&#x27;s primary helicopter model, the CH-46 Sea Knight, was aging, and no replacement had been accepted. Because the USMC&#x27;s amphibious capability would be significantly reduced without the CH-46, USMC leadership believed a proposal to merge the Marine Corps with the Army was a credible threat. This potential merger was akin to a proposal by President Truman following World War II. The Office of the Secretary of Defense and Navy administration opposed the tiltrotor project, but pressure from Congress had a significant effect on the program&#x27;s development.

The Navy and USMC were given the lead in 1983. The JVX combined requirements from the USMC, USAF, Army and Navy. A request for preliminary design proposals was issued in December 1982. Interest was expressed by Aérospatiale, Bell Helicopter, Boeing Vertol, Grumman, Lockheed, and Westland. Contractors were encouraged to form teams. Bell partnered with Boeing Vertol to submit a proposal for an enlarged version of the Bell XV-15 prototype on 17 February 1983. Since this was the only proposal the JVX program received, a preliminary design contract was awarded on 26 April 1983.

The JVX aircraft was designated &quot;V-22 Osprey&quot; on 15 January 1985; by that March, the first six prototypes were being produced, and Boeing Vertol was expanded to handle the workload. Production work is split between Bell and Boeing. Bell Helicopter manufactures and integrates the wing, nacelles, rotors, drive system, tail surfaces, and aft ramp, as well as integrating the Rolls-Royce engines and performing final assembly. Boeing Helicopters manufactures and integrates the fuselage, cockpit, avionics, and flight controls. The USMC variant received the MV-22 designation, and the USAF variant received CV-22; this was reversed from normal procedure to prevent USMC Ospreys from having a conflicting CV designation with aircraft carriers. Full-scale development began in 1986. On 3 May 1986, Bell Boeing was awarded a US$1.714 billion contract for the V-22 by the U.S. Navy. At this point, all four U.S. military services had acquisition plans for the V-22.

The first V-22 was publicly rolled out in May 1988. That year, the U.S. Army left the program, citing a need to focus its budget on more immediate aviation programs. In 1989, the V-22 survived two separate Senate votes that could have resulted in cancellation. Despite the Senate&#x27;s decision, the Department of Defense instructed the Navy not to spend more money on the V-22. As development cost projections greatly increased in 1988, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney tried to defund it from 1989 to 1992, but was overruled by Congress, which provided unrequested program funding. Multiple studies of alternatives found the V-22 provided more capability and effectiveness with similar operating costs. The Clinton Administration was supportive of the V-22, helping it attain funding.

Although the Army departed the program, it eventually developed and chose a tiltrotor to replace the UH-60 Blackhawk in the 21st century, and as of the mid-2020s the Army is planning to field the V-280 Valor tiltrotor.

===Flight testing and design changes===
The first of six prototypes first flew on 19 March 1989 in the helicopter mode and on 14 September 1989 in fixed-wing mode. The third and fourth prototypes successfully completed the first sea trials on in December 1990. The fourth and fifth prototypes crashed in 1991–92. From October 1992 to April 1993, the V-22 was redesigned to reduce empty weight, simplify manufacture, and reduce build costs; it was designated V-22B. Flights resumed in June 1993 after safety changes were made to the prototypes. Bell Boeing received a contract for the engineering manufacturing development (EMD) phase in June 1994. The prototypes were also modified to resemble the V-22B standard. At this stage, testing focused on flight envelope expansion, measuring flight loads, and supporting the EMD redesign. Flight testing with the early V-22s continued into 1997.
Flight testing of four full-scale development V-22s began at the Naval Air Warfare Test Center, Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. The first EMD flight took place on 5 February 1997. Testing soon fell behind schedule. The first of four low rate initial production aircraft, ordered on 28 April 1997, was delivered on 27 May 1999. The second sea trials were completed onboard in January 1999. During external load testing in April 1999, a V-22 transported the lightweight M777 howitzer.

In 2000, there were two fatal crashes, killing a total of 23 marines, and the V-22 was again grounded while the crashes&#x27; causes were investigated and various parts were redesigned. In June 2005, the V-22 completed its final operational evaluation, including long-range deployments, high altitude, desert and shipboard operations; problems previously identified had reportedly been resolved.

U.S. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) worked on software upgrades to increase the maximum speed from , increase helicopter mode altitude limit from or , and increase lift performance. By 2012, changes had been made to the hardware, software, and procedures in response to hydraulic fires in the nacelles, vortex ring state control issues, and opposed landings; reliability has improved accordingly.

An MV-22 landed and refueled on board in an evaluation in October 2012. In 2013, cargo handling trials occurred on . In October 2015, NAVAIR tested rolling landings and takeoffs on a carrier, preparing for carrier onboard delivery.

===Discussions===
Development was protracted and controversial, partly because of large cost increases, some of which were caused by a requirement to fold wings and rotors to fit aboard ships. The development budget was first set at US$2.5 billion in 1986, increasing to a projected US$30 billion in 1988. By 2008, US$27 billion had been spent and another US$27.2 billion was required for planned production numbers. Between 2008 and 2011, the V-22&#x27;s estimated lifetime cost grew by 61%, mostly for maintenance and support.

In 2001, Lieutenant Colonel Odin Leberman, commander of the V-22 squadron at Marine Corps Air Station New River, was relieved of duty after allegations that he instructed his unit to falsify maintenance records to make it appear more reliable. Three officers were implicated for their roles in the falsification scandal.
In October 2007, a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article condemned the V-22 as unsafe, overpriced, and inadequate; the USMC responded that the article&#x27;s data was partly obsolete, inaccurate, and held high expectations for any new field of aircraft. In 2011, the controversial defense industry-supported Lexington Institute reported that the average mishap rate per flight hour over the past 10 years was the lowest of any USMC rotorcraft, approximately half of the average fleet accident rate. In 2011, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine reported that the safety record had excluded ground incidents; the USMC responded that MV-22 reporting used the same standards as other Navy aircraft.

By 2012, the USMC reported fleetwide readiness rate had risen to 68%; however, the DOD&#x27;s Inspector General later found 167 of 200 reports had &quot;improperly recorded&quot; information. Captain Richard Ulsh blamed errors on incompetence, saying that they were &quot;not malicious&quot; or deliberate. The required mission capable rate was 82%, but the average was 53% from June 2007 to May 2010. In 2010, Naval Air Systems Command aimed for an 85% reliability rate by 2018. From 2009 to 2014, readiness rates rose 25% to the &quot;high 80s&quot;, while cost per flight hour had dropped 20% to $9,520 through a rigorous maintenance improvement program that focused on diagnosing problems before failures occur. , although the V-22 requires more maintenance and has lower availability (62%) than traditional helicopters, it also has a lower mishap rate. The average cost per flight hour is , whereas the Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion cost about $20,000 (~$ in ) per flight hour in 2007. V-22 ownership cost was $83,000 per hour in 2013. In 2022, the Pentagon evaluated its cost per flight hour at $23,941.
While technically capable of autorotation if both engines fail in helicopter mode, a safe landing is difficult. In 2005, a director of the Pentagon&#x27;s testing office stated that in a loss of power while hovering below , emergency landings &quot;are not likely to be survivable.&quot; V-22 pilot Captain Justin &quot;Moon&quot; McKinney stated that: &quot;We can turn it into a plane and glide it down, just like a C-130.&quot; A complete loss of power requires both engines to fail, as one engine can power both proprotors via interconnected drive shafts. Though vortex ring state (VRS) contributed to a deadly V-22 accident, flight testing found it to be less susceptible to VRS than conventional helicopters. A GAO report stated that the V-22 is &quot;less forgiving than conventional helicopters&quot; during VRS. Several test flights to explore VRS characteristics were canceled. The USMC trains pilots in the recognition of and recovery from VRS, and has instituted operational envelope limits and instrumentation to help avoid VRS conditions.

===Production===
On 28 September 2005, the Pentagon formally approved full-rate production, increasing from 11 V-22s per year to between 24 and 48 per year by 2012. Of the 458 total planned, 360 are for the USMC, 50 for the USAF, and 48 for the Navy at an average cost of $110 million per aircraft, including development costs. The V-22 had an incremental flyaway cost of $67 million per aircraft in 2008, The Navy had hoped to shave about $10 million off that cost via a five-year production contract in 2013. Each CV-22 cost $73 million (~$ in ) in the FY 2014 budget.

On 15 April 2010, the Naval Air Systems Command awarded Bell Boeing a $42.1 million (~$ in ) contract to design an integrated processor in response to avionics obsolescence and add new network capabilities. By 2014, Raytheon began providing an avionics upgrade that includes situational awareness and blue force tracking. In 2009, a contract for Block C upgrades was awarded to Bell Boeing. In February 2012, the USMC received the first V-22C, featuring a new radar, additional mission management and electronic warfare equipment. In 2015, options for upgrading all aircraft to the V-22C standard were examined.
On 12 June 2013, the U.S. DoD awarded a $4.9 billion contract for 99 V-22s in production Lots 17 and 18, including 92 MV-22s for the USMC, for completion in September 2019. A provision gives NAVAIR the option to order 23 more Ospreys. As of June 2013, the combined value of all contracts placed totaled $6.5 billion. In 2013, Bell laid off production staff following the US&#x27;s order being cut to about half of the planned number. Production rate went from 40 in 2012 to 22 planned for 2015. Manufacturing robots have replaced older automated machines for increased accuracy and efficiency; large parts are held in place by suction cups and measured electronically.

In March 2014, Air Force Special Operations Command issued a Combat Mission Need Statement for armor to protect V-22 passengers. NAVAIR worked with a Florida-based composite armor company and the Army Aviation Development Directorate to develop and deliver the advanced ballistic stopping system (ABSS) by October 2014. Costing $270,000, the ABSS consists of 66 plates fitting along interior bulkheads and deck, adding to the aircraft&#x27;s weight, affecting payload and range. The ABSS can be installed or removed when needed in hours and partially assembled in pieces for partial protection of specific areas. As of May 2015, 16 kits had been delivered to the USAF.

In 2015, Bell Boeing set up the V-22 Readiness Operations Center at Ridley Park, Pennsylvania, to gather information from each aircraft to improve fleet performance in a similar manner as the F-35&#x27;s Autonomic Logistics Information System.

Two programs, the &quot;V-22 Cockpit Technology Replacement&quot; (VeCToR) and &quot;Renewed V-22 Aircraft Modernization Program&quot; (ReVAMP), are being studied to upgrade the aircraft and extend its life. VeCToR would upgrade the cockpit with more modern electronics in the 2030s and 40s, and ReVAMP would be a fuselage life extension program to extend the V-22&#x27;s service beyond the 2060s.

==Design==
===Overview===
The Osprey is the world&#x27;s first production tiltrotor aircraft, with one three-bladed proprotor, turboshaft engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. It is classified as a powered lift aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration. For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with the nacelles vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the nacelles rotate forward 90° in as little as 12 seconds for horizontal flight, converting the V-22 to a more fuel-efficient, higher-speed aircraft, like a turboprop aircraft. STOL rolling-takeoff and landing capability is achieved by having the nacelles tilted forward up to 45°. Other orientations are possible. Pilots describe the V-22 in airplane mode as comparable to the C-130 in feel and speed. It has a ferry range of over 2,100 nmi. Its operational range is 1,100 nmi.

Composite materials make up 43% of the airframe, and the proprotor blades also use composites. For storage, the V-22&#x27;s rotors fold in 90 seconds and its wing rotates to align, front-to-back, with the fuselage. Because of the requirement for folding rotors, their diameter is less than would be optimal for an aircraft of this size to conduct vertical takeoff, resulting in high disk loading. Most missions use fixed wing flight 75% or more of the time, reducing wear and tear and operational costs. This fixed wing flight is higher than typical helicopter missions allowing longer range line-of-sight communications for improved command and control.

Exhaust heat from the V-22&#x27;s engines can potentially damage ships&#x27; flight decks and coatings. NAVAIR devised a temporary fix of portable heat shields placed under the engines and determined that a long-term solution would require redesigning decks with heat resistant coating, passive thermal barriers, and ship structure changes. Similar changes are required for F-35B operations. In 2009, DARPA requested solutions for installing robust flight deck cooling. A heat-resistant anti-skid metal spray named Thermion has been tested on USS &quot;Wasp&quot;.

===Propulsion===
The V-22&#x27;s two Rolls-Royce AE 1107C engines are connected by drive shafts to a common central gearbox so that one engine can power both proprotors if an engine failure occurs. Either engine can power both proprotors through the wing driveshaft. However, the V-22 is generally not capable of hovering on one engine. If a proprotor gearbox fails, that proprotor cannot be feathered, and both engines must be stopped before an emergency landing. The autorotation characteristics are poor because of the rotors&#x27; low inertia. The AE 1107C engine has a two-shaft axial design with a 14-stage compressor, an effusion-cooled annular combustor, a two-stage gas generator turbine, and two-stage power turbine.
In September 2013, Rolls-Royce announced that it had increased the AE-1107C engine&#x27;s power by 17% via the adoption of a new Block 3 turbine, increased fuel valve flow capacity, and software updates; it should also improve reliability in high-altitude, high-heat conditions and boost maximum payload limitations from . A Block 4 upgrade is reportedly being examined, which may increase power by up to 26%, producing close to , and improve fuel consumption.

In August 2014, the U.S. military issued a request for information for a potential drop-in replacement for the AE-1107C engines. Submissions must have a power rating of no less than at 15,000 rpm, operate at up to at up to , and fit into the existing wing nacelles with minimal structural or external modifications. In September 2014, the U.S. Navy, who already purchase engines separately to airframes, was reportedly considering an alternative engine supplier to reduce costs. The General Electric GE38 is one option, giving commonality with the Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion.

The V-22 has a maximum rotor downwash speed of over , more than the lower limit of a hurricane. The rotorwash usually prevents the starboard door&#x27;s usage in hover; the rear ramp is used for rappelling and hoisting instead. The V-22 loses 10% of its vertical lift over a tiltwing design when operating in helicopter mode because of the wings&#x27; airflow resistance, while the tiltrotor design has better short takeoff and landing performance. V-22s must keep at least of vertical separation between each other to avoid each other&#x27;s rotor wake, which causes turbulence and potentially control loss. The extreme rotor downwash of the V-22 has caused incidents when rappelling or fast roping from the aircraft, including a soldier being blown 3 meters away from his intended dismount point by the force of the downwash. The downwash is strong enough to destroy unstrengthened helipads and can create flying debris in the landing zone that can injure bystanders or potentially damage the aircraft; an incident involving a Marine Corps Osprey in 2010 resulted in 10 bystanders suffering downwash-related injuries.

===Avionics===
The V-22 is equipped with a glass cockpit, which incorporates four multi-function displays (MFDs, compatible with night-vision goggles) and one shared central display unit, to display various images including: digimaps, imagery from the Turreted forward-looking infrared system primary flight instruments, navigation (TACAN, VOR, ILS, GPS, INS), and system status. The flight director panel of the cockpit management system allows for fully coupled (autopilot) functions that take the aircraft from forward flight into a hover with no pilot interaction other than programming the system. The fuselage is not pressurized, and personnel must wear on-board oxygen masks above 10,000 feet.
The V-22 has triple-redundant fly-by-wire flight control systems; these have computerized damage control to automatically isolate damaged areas. With the nacelles pointing straight up in conversion mode at 90° the flight computers command it to fly like a helicopter, cyclic forces being applied to a conventional swashplate at the rotor hub. With the nacelles in airplane mode (0°) the flaperons, rudder, and elevator fly similar to an airplane. This is a gradual transition, occurring over the nacelles&#x27; rotation range; the lower the nacelles, the greater effect of the airplane-mode control surfaces. The nacelles can rotate past vertical to 97.5° for rearward flight. The V-22 can use the &quot;80 Jump&quot; orientation with the nacelles at 80° for takeoff to quickly achieve high altitude and speed. The controls automate to the extent that it can hover in low wind without hands on the controls.

New USMC V-22 pilots learn to fly helicopter and multiengine fixed-wing aircraft before the tiltrotor. Some V-22 pilots believe that former fixed-wing pilots may be preferable over helicopter users, as they are not trained to constantly adjust the controls in hover. Others say that experience with helicopters&#x27; hovering and precision is most important. the US military does not track whether fixed-wing or helicopter pilots transition more easily to the V-22, according to USMC Colonel Matthew Kelly, V-22 project manager. He said that fixed-wing pilots are more experienced at instrument flying, while helicopter pilots are more experienced at scanning outside when the aircraft is moving slowly.

===Armament===

The V-22 can be armed with one 7.62×51mm NATO (.308 in caliber) M240 machine gun or .50 in caliber (12.7 mm) M2 machine gun on the rear loading ramp. A 12.7 mm (.50 in) GAU-19 three-barrel Gatling gun mounted below the nose was studied. BAE Systems developed a belly-mounted, remotely operated gun turret system, the Interim Defense Weapon System (IDWS); it is remotely operated by a gunner, targets are acquired via a separate pod using color television and forward looking infrared imagery. The IDWS was installed on half of the V-22s deployed to Afghanistan in 2009; it found limited use because of its weight and restrictive rules of engagement.

There were 32 IDWSs available to the USMC in June 2012; V-22s often flew without it as the added weight reduced cargo capacity. The V-22&#x27;s speed allows it to outrun conventional support helicopters, thus a self-defense capability was required on long-range independent operations. The infrared gun camera proved useful for reconnaissance and surveillance. Other weapons were studied to provide all-quadrant fire, including nose guns, door guns, and non-lethal countermeasures to work with the current ramp-mounted machine gun and the IDWS.

In 2014, the USMC studied new weapons with &quot;all-axis, stand-off, and precision capabilities&quot;, akin to the AGM-114 Hellfire, AGM-176 Griffin, Joint Air-to-Ground Missile, and GBU-53/B SDB II. In November 2014, Bell Boeing conducted self-funded weapons tests, equipping a V-22 with a pylon on the front fuselage and replacing the AN/AAQ-27A EO camera with an L-3 Wescam MX-15 sensor/laser designator. 26 unguided Hydra 70 rockets, two guided APKWS rockets, and two Griffin B missiles were fired over five flights. The USMC and USAF sought a traversable nose-mounted weapon connected to a helmet-mounted sight; recoil complicated integrating a forward-facing gun. A pylon could carry of munitions. However, by 2019, the USMC opted for IDWS upgrades over adopting new weapons.

===Refueling capability===
Boeing is developing a roll-on/roll-off aerial refueling kit, which would give the V-22 the ability to refuel other aircraft. Having an aerial refueling capability that can be based on Wasp-class amphibious assault ships would increase the F-35B&#x27;s strike power, removing reliance on refueling assets solely based on large &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carriers or land bases. The roll-on/roll-off kit can also be applicable to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) functions. Boeing funded a non-functional demonstration on a VMX-22 aircraft; a prototype kit was successfully tested with an F/A-18 on 5 September 2013.
The high-speed version of the hose/drogue refueling system can be deployed at and function at up to . A mix of tanks and a roll-on/roll-off bladder house up to of fuel. The ramp must open to extend the hose, then raised once extended. It can refuel rotorcraft, needing a separate drogue used specifically by helicopters and a converted nacelle. Many USMC ground vehicles can run on aviation fuel; a refueling V-22 could service these. In late 2014, it was stated that V-22 tankers could be in use by 2017, but contract delays pushed IOC to late 2019. As part of a 26 May 2016 contract award to Boeing, Cobham was contracted to adapt their FR-300 hose drum unit as used by the KC-130 in October 2016. While the Navy has not declared its interest in the capability, it could be leveraged later on.

==Operational history==
In October 2019, the fleet of 375 V-22s operated by the U.S. Armed Forces surpassed the 500,000 flight hour mark. A fatal accident in December 2023, led the fleet being grounded until March 2024 by the US and Japan.

===U.S. Marine Corps===
Since March 2000, VMMT-204 has conducted training for the type. In December 2005, Lieutenant General James Amos, commander of II Marine Expeditionary Force, accepted delivery of the first batch of MV-22s. The unit reactivated in March 2006 as the first MV-22 squadron, redesignated as VMM-263. In 2007, HMM-266 became Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 266 (VMM-266) and reached initial operational capability. It started replacing the CH-46 Sea Knight in 2007; the CH-46 was retired in October 2014. On 13 April 2007, the USMC announced the first V-22 combat deployment at Al Asad Airbase, Iraq.
V-22s in Iraq&#x27;s Anbar province were used for transport and scout missions. General David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq, used one to visit troops on Christmas Day 2007; as did Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign tour in Iraq. USMC Col. Kelly recalled how visitors were reluctant to fly on the unfamiliar aircraft, but after seeing its speed and ability to fly above ground fire, &quot;All of a sudden, the entire flight schedule was booked. No senior officer wanted to go anywhere unless they could fly on the V-22&quot;. Obtaining spares proved problematic. By July 2008, the V-22 had flown 3,000 sorties totaling 5,200 hours in Iraq. General George J. Trautman III praised its greater speed and range over legacy helicopters, saying &quot;it turned his battle space from the size of Texas into the size of Rhode Island.&quot; Despite attacks by man-portable air-defense systems and small arms, none were lost to enemy fire by late 2009.

A Government Accountability Office study stated that by January 2009, the 12 MV-22s in Iraq had completed all assigned missions; mission capable rates averaged 57% to 68%, and an overall full mission capable rate of 6%. It also noted weaknesses in situational awareness, maintenance, shipboard operations and transport capability. The report concluded: &quot;deployments confirmed that the V-22&#x27;s enhanced speed and range enable personnel and internal cargo to be transported faster and farther than is possible with the legacy helicopters&quot;.

MV-22s deployed to Afghanistan in November 2009 with VMM-261; it saw its first offensive combat mission, Operation Cobra&#x27;s Anger, on 4 December 2009. V-22s assisted in inserting 1,000 USMC and 150 Afghan troops into the Now Zad Valley of Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan to disrupt Taliban operations. General James Amos stated that Afghanistan&#x27;s MV-22s had surpassed 100,000 flight hours, calling it &quot;the safest airplane, or close to the safest airplane&quot; in the USMC inventory. The V-22&#x27;s Afghan deployment was set to end in late 2013 with the drawdown of combat operations; however, VMM-261 was directed to extend operations for casualty evacuation, being quicker than helicopters enabled more casualties to reach a hospital within the &#x27;golden hour&#x27;; they were fitted with medical equipment such as heart monitors and triage supplies.
In January 2010, the MV-22 was sent to Haiti as part of Operation Unified Response relief efforts after an earthquake, the type&#x27;s first humanitarian mission. In March 2011, two MV-22s from helped rescue a downed USAF F-15E crew member during Operation Odyssey Dawn. On 2 May 2011, following Operation Neptune&#x27;s Spear, the body of Osama bin Laden, founder of the al-Qaeda terrorist group, was flown by an MV-22 to the aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, prior to his burial at sea.

In 2013, several MV-22s received communications and seating modifications to support the Marine One presidential transport squadron because of the urgent need for CH-53Es in Afghanistan. In May 2010, Boeing announced plans to submit the V-22 for the VXX presidential transport replacement.

From 2 to 5 August 2013, two MV-22s completed the longest distance Osprey tanking mission to date. Flying from Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Okinawa alongside two KC-130J tankers, they flew to Clark Air Base in the Philippines on 2 August; then to Darwin, Australia, on 3 August; to Townsville, Australia, on 4 August; and finally rendezvoused with on 5 August.

In 2013, the USMC formed an intercontinental response force, the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force – Crisis Response – Africa, using V-22s outfitted with specialized communications gear. In 2013, following Typhoon Haiyan, 12 MV-22s of the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Brigade were deployed to the Philippines for disaster relief operations; its abilities were described as &quot;uniquely relevant&quot;, flying faster and with greater payloads while moving supplies throughout the island archipelago.

===U.S. Air Force===
The USAF&#x27;s first operational CV-22 was delivered to the 58th Special Operations Wing (58th SOW) at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, in March 2006. Early aircraft were delivered to the 58th SOW and used for training personnel for special operations use. On 16 November 2006, the USAF officially accepted the CV-22 in a ceremony conducted at Hurlburt Field, Florida. The USAF&#x27;s first operational deployment sent four CV-22s to Mali in November 2008 in support of Exercise Flintlock. The CV-22s flew nonstop from Hurlburt Field, Florida, with in-flight refueling. AFSOC declared that the 8th Special Operations Squadron reached Initial Operational Capability in March 2009, with six CV-22s in service.
In December 2013, three CV-22s came under small arms fire while trying to evacuate American civilians in Bor, South Sudan, during the 2013 South Sudanese political crisis; the aircraft flew to Entebbe, Uganda, after the mission was aborted. South Sudanese officials stated that the attackers were rebels. The CV-22s had flown to Bor over three countries across . The formation was hit 119 times, wounding four crew and causing flight control failures and hydraulic and fuel leaks on all three aircraft. Fuel leaks resulted in multiple air-to-air refuelings en route. After the incident, AFSOC developed optional armor floor panels.

The USAF found that &quot;CV-22 wake modeling is inadequate for a trailing aircraft to make accurate estimations of safe separation [distance] from the preceding aircraft.&quot; In 2015, the USAF sought to configure the CV-22 to perform combat search and rescue in addition to its long-range special operations transport mission. It would complement the HH-60G Pave Hawk and planned HH-60W rescue helicopters, being employed in scenarios where high speed is better suited to search and rescue than more nimble but slower helicopters. In 2019, a plan was formulated for the USAF V-22 to use the AN/APQ-187 Silent Knight terrain avoidance radar, which was tested on the CV-22 at Eglin Air Force base by 2020. This radar is used on many Air Force aircraft, such as C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and MH-47 Chinook helicopters.

On 29 November 2023, a CV-22B assigned to the US Air Force&#x27;s 353rd Special Operations Wing crashed into the East China Sea off Yakushima Island, Japan, killing all eight airmen aboard. The Osprey, based at Yokota Air Base, was flying from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa Island in clear weather and light winds. An Air Force investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing. A preliminary investigation has revealed a &quot;potential materiel failure&quot; could have caused the accident. On 6 December 2023, the U.S. Navy (NAVAIR) and the Air Force (AFSOC) grounded their V-22 fleets. Japan (Maritime Self Defense Force) also has grounded their fleet. In early March the US and Japan resumed flights of the V-22 with revised maintenance and pilot training focuses but no changes to the aircraft. The V-22 was returned to flight with no changes; the part that failed was identified and how it failed determined, although the accident was still under scrutiny. A near crash in December 2024 led to another operation pause, over concerns about metal fatigue.

===U.S. Navy===

The V-22 program originally included Navy 48 HV-22s, but none were ordered. In 2009, it was proposed that it replace the C-2 Greyhound for carrier onboard delivery (COD) duties. One advantage of the V-22 is the ability to deliver supplies and people between non-carrier ships beyond helicopter range. Proponents said that it is capable of similar speed, payload capacity, and lift performance to the C-2, and can carry greater payloads over short ranges, up to 20,000 lb, including suspended external loads. The C-2 can only deliver cargo to carriers, requiring further distribution to smaller vessels via helicopters, while the V-22 is certified for operating upon amphibious ships, aircraft carriers, and logistics ships. It could also take some helicopter roles by fitting a 600 lb hoist to the ramp and a cabin configuration for 12 non-ambulatory patients and 5 seats for medical attendants. Bell and P&amp;W designed a frame for the V-22 to transport the Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine of the F-35.

On 5 January 2015, the Navy and USMC signed a memorandum of understanding to buy the V-22 for the COD mission. Initially designated HV-22, four aircraft were bought each year from 2018 to 2020. It incorporates an extended-range fuel system for an unrefueled range, a high-frequency radio for over-the-horizon communications, and a public address system to communicate with passengers; the range increase comes from extra fuel bladders in larger external sponsons, the only external difference from other variants. Its primary mission is long-range logistics; other conceivable missions include personnel recovery and special warfare. In February 2016, the Navy officially designated it the &quot;CMV-22B&quot;. The Navy&#x27;s Program of Record originally called for 48 aircraft, but it was later determined that only 44 were required. Production began in FY 2018, and deliveries started in 2020.

The Navy ordered the first 39 CMV-22Bs in June 2018; initial operating capability was achieved in 2021, with fielding to the fleet by the mid-2020s. The first CMV-22B made its initial flight in December 2019. The first deployment began in summer 2021 aboard USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;. The Navy is planning an upgraded gearbox for their CMV-22B.

===Japan Self-Defense Forces===

Japan bought the V-22 and they entered defense service in 2020, becoming the first international customer for the tiltrotor.

In 2012, then-Defense Minister Satoshi Morimoto ordered an investigation of the costs of V-22 operations. The V-22&#x27;s capabilities exceeded current Japan Self-Defense Forces helicopters in terms of range, speed and payload. The ministry anticipated deployments to the Nansei Islands and the Senkaku Islands, as well as in multinational cooperation with the U.S. In November 2014, the Japanese Ministry of Defense decided to procure 17 V-22s. The first V-22 for Japan undertook its first flight in August 2017 and the aircraft began delivery to the Japanese military in 2020.
In September 2018, the Japanese Ministry of Defense decided to delay the deployment of the first five MV-22Bs it had received amid opposition and ongoing negotiations in the Saga Prefecture, where the aircraft are to be based. On 8 May 2020, the first two of the five aircraft were delivered to the JGSDF at Kisarazu Air Field after failing to reach an agreement with Saga prefecture residents. It is planned to eventually station some V-22s on board the s. In September 2023, the first V-22 landings were conducted on the helicopter carrier &quot;Ise&quot;. The aircraft are planned to be based at Saga Airport in Kyushu starting in 2025 where the V-22s will be deployed together with Sikorsky Black Hawk and Apache Longbow helicopters in order to better defend Japan&#x27;s southern Nansei Islands.

Following the fatal crash of a US Air Force CV-22 off Yakushima on 29 November 2023, Japan suspended flights of its 14 MV-22s. In early 2024 it was reported that the Japanese would resume flights of the V-22, and in March 2024 flights resumed.

===Potential operators===
The V-22 can carry a power-module of certain fighter jets such as the F-35, and also is noted it could be useful to nations with island chains or carriers. One question was why the U.S. Army did not procure the V-22 Osprey, and it was actually in the project at the start, but ended up heavily investing in traditional rotor craft such as the UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47 Chinook. The V-22 production line is planned to be open to around 2026 to complete the orders for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corp.

Early on in the 2010s, some of the possible export buyers included Canada, Japan, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. Other potential interest came from India and Indonesia. In Europe, there was some interest on the continent from France, Spain, and Italy also. Canada is thought to have considered the V-22 for the Fixed Wing Search and Rescue (FWSAR), but it was not entered as the overall goals prioritized conventional aircraft; that program was won by the C-295, a fixed-wing medium transport.

The Air Force is also considering some additional V-22 for search and rescue, to supplement the HH-60W with a longer range aircraft, especially in the Indo-Pacific region where longer range is typically needed.
====France====
France had shown some interest in the V-22 especially for Naval operations. It tested the V-22 in operations on the Mistral class LHDs, and also its CVN. The French had two year long program to insure that the V-22 could operate from the &quot;Mistral&quot; class LHD working with USMC V-22.

====India====
In 2015, the Indian Aviation Research Centre showed interest in acquiring four V-22s for personnel evacuation in hostile conditions, logistic supplies, and deployment of the Special Frontier Force in border areas. US V-22s performed relief operations after the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. The Indian Navy also studied the V-22 rather than the E-2D for airborne early warning and control to replace the short-range Kamov Ka-31. India is interested in purchasing six attack version V-22s for rapid troop insertion in border areas.

====Indonesia====
On 6 July 2020, the U.S. State Department announced that they had approved a possible Foreign Military Sale to Indonesia of eight Block C MV-22s and related equipment for an estimated cost of $2 billion (~$ in ). The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of this possible sale. The sale was approved, but in the end Indonesia decided against the purchase at that time due to the cost. It was noted that the V-22 could provide a unique logistical support to the island chain nation, but the concerns about purchase and maintenance costs were an issue.

====Israel====
On 22 April 2013, an agreement was signed to sell six V-22 to the Israeli Air Force. By the end of 2016, Israel had not ordered the V-22 and was instead interested in buying the CH-47 Chinook helicopter or the CH-53K helicopter. As of 2017, Israel had frozen its evaluation of the V-22, &quot;with a senior defence source indicating that the tiltrotor is unable to perform some missions currently conducted using its Sikorsky CH-53 transport helicopters.&quot;

==== United Kingdom ====
The U.K. has had a watchful eye on V-22 program, and a combined UK/US study evaluated possible use. One of the more serious evaluations, came in the late 2010s when it was considered to use them on the new &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class carriers. In the 2020s, it was thought to be one of the possible aircraft for the U.K.&#x27;s New Medium Helicopter program but was not a finalist, a program that is seeking to replace the Westland Puma medium helicopter fleet.

The V-22 has been used on training exercises in the U.K. which has helped identify some issues, such as that the downwash can disrupt landing mats.

==Variants==
The preproduction model was called the V-22. USMC operates the MV-22B including the VIP V-22s, the USAF the CV-22B, and the Navy CMV-22B. 

;V-22 (&quot;V-22A&quot;): Pre-production full-scale development aircraft used for flight testing. These are unofficially considered A-variants after the 1993 redesign.

;CV-22B: U.S. Air Force variant for the U.S. Special Operations Command. It conducts long-range special operations missions and is equipped with extra wing fuel tanks, an AN/APQ-186 terrain-following radar, and other equipment such as the AN/ALQ-211, and AN/AAQ-24 Nemesis Directional Infrared Counter Measures. The fuel capacity is increased by 588 gallons (2,230 L) with two inboard wing tanks; three auxiliary tanks (200 or 430 gal; 760 or 1,630 L) can also be added in the cabin. The CV-22 replaced the MH-53 Pave Low.

;MV-22B: U.S. Marine Corps variant. The Marine Corps is the lead service in the V-22&#x27;s development. The Marine Corps variant is an assault transport for troops, equipment and supplies, capable of operating from ships or expeditionary airfields ashore. It replaced the Marine Corps&#x27; CH-46E and CH-53D fleets.

;CMV-22B: U.S. Navy variant for the carrier onboard delivery role, replacing the C-2. Similar to the MV-22B but includes an extended-range fuel system, a high-frequency radio, and a public address system.

;EV-22: Proposed airborne early warning and control variant. The Royal Navy studied this variant as a replacement for its fleet of carrier-based Sea King ASaC.7 helicopters.

;HV-22: The U.S. Navy considered an HV-22 to provide combat search and rescue, delivery and retrieval of special warfare teams along with fleet logistic support transport. It chose the MH-60S for this role in 2001.

;SV-22: Proposed anti-submarine warfare variant. The U.S. Navy studied the SV-22 in the 1980s to replace S-3 and SH-2 aircraft.

<doc id="32817" wikidata="Q7747" url="?curid=32817" title="Vladimir Putin">
<text>Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin (born 7 October 1952) is a Russian politician and former intelligence officer who has served as President of Russia since 2012, having previously served from 2000 to 2008. Putin also served as Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2008 to 2012. He is the longest-serving Russian president since the independence of Russia from the Soviet Union.

Putin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He resigned in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg. In 1996, he moved to Moscow to join the administration of President Boris Yeltsin. He briefly served as the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and then as secretary of the Security Council of Russia before being appointed prime minister in August 1999. Following Yeltsin&#x27;s resignation, Putin became acting president and, less than four months later, was elected to his first term as president. He was reelected in 2004. Due to constitutional limitations of two consecutive presidential terms, Putin served as prime minister again from 2008 to 2012 under Dmitry Medvedev. He returned to the presidency in 2012, following an election marked by allegations of fraud and protests, and was reelected in 2018.

During Putin&#x27;s initial presidential tenure, the Russian economy grew on average by seven percent per year, driven by economic reforms and a fivefold increase in the price of oil and gas. Additionally, Putin led Russia in a conflict against Chechen separatists, re-establishing federal control over the region. While serving as prime minister under Medvedev, he oversaw a military conflict with Georgia and enacted military and police reforms. In his third presidential term, Russia annexed Crimea and supported a war in eastern Ukraine through several military incursions, resulting in international sanctions and a financial crisis in Russia. He also ordered a military intervention in Syria to support his ally during the Syrian civil war, with the aim of obtaining naval bases in the Eastern Mediterranean.

In February 2022, during his fourth presidential term, Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which prompted international condemnation and led to expanded sanctions. In September 2022, he announced a partial mobilization and forcibly annexed four Ukrainian oblasts into Russia. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes related to his alleged criminal responsibility for illegal child abductions during the war. In April 2021, after a referendum, he signed into law constitutional amendments that included one allowing him to run for reelection twice more, potentially extending his presidency to 2036. In March 2024, he was reelected to another term.

Under Putin&#x27;s rule, the Russian political system has been transformed into an authoritarian dictatorship with a personality cult. His rule has been marked by endemic corruption and widespread human rights violations, including the imprisonment and suppression of political opponents, intimidation and censorship of independent media in Russia, and a lack of free and fair elections. Russia has consistently received very low scores on Transparency International&#x27;s &quot;Corruption Perceptions Index&quot;, &quot;The Economist Democracy Index&quot;, Freedom House&#x27;s &quot;Freedom in the World&quot; index, and the Reporters Without Borders &quot;Press Freedom Index&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Putin was born on 7 October 1952 in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia), the youngest of three children of Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin (1911–1999) and Maria Ivanovna Putina (; 1911–1998). His grandfather, Spiridon Putin (1879–1965), was a personal cook to Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. Putin&#x27;s birth was preceded by the deaths of two brothers: Albert, born in the 1930s, died in infancy, and Viktor, born in 1940, died of diphtheria and starvation in 1942 during the Siege of Leningrad by Nazi Germany&#x27;s forces in World War II.

Putin&#x27;s mother was a factory worker, and his father was a conscript in the Soviet Navy, serving in the submarine fleet in the early 1930s. During the early stage of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, his father served in the destruction battalion of the NKVD. Later, he was transferred to the regular army and was severely wounded in 1942. Putin&#x27;s maternal grandmother was killed by the German occupiers of Tver region in 1941, and his maternal uncles disappeared on the Eastern Front during World War II.

=== Education ===
On 1 September 1960, Putin started at School No. 193 at Baskov Lane, near his home. He was one of a few in his class of about 45 pupils who were not yet members of the Young Pioneer (&quot;Komsomol&quot;) organization. At the age of 12, he began to practice sambo and judo. In his free time, he enjoyed reading the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Lenin. Putin attended Saint Petersburg High School 281 with a German language immersion program. He is fluent in German and often gives speeches and interviews in that language. 

Putin studied law at the Leningrad State University named after Andrei Zhdanov (now Saint Petersburg State University) in 1970 and graduated in 1975. His thesis was on &quot;The Most Favored Nation Trading Principle in International Law&quot;. While there, he was required to join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU); he remained a member until it ceased to exist in 1991. Putin met Anatoly Sobchak, an assistant professor who taught business law, and who later became the co-author of the Russian constitution. Putin was influential in Sobchak&#x27;s career in Saint Petersburg, and Sobchak was influential in Putin&#x27;s career in Moscow.

In 1997, Putin received a degree in economics (&quot;kandidat ekonomicheskikh nauk&quot;) at the Saint Petersburg Mining University for a thesis on energy dependencies and their instrumentalisation in foreign policy. His supervisor was Vladimir Litvinenko, who in 2000 and again in 2004 managed his presidential election campaigns in St Petersburg. Igor Danchenko and Clifford Gaddy consider Putin to be a plagiarist according to Western standards. One book from which he copied entire paragraphs is the Russian-language edition of King and Cleland&#x27;s &quot;Strategic Planning and Policy&quot; (1978). Balzer wrote on the Putin thesis and Russian energy policy and concludes along with Olcott that &quot;The primacy of the Russian state in the country’s energy sector is non-negotiable&quot;, and cites the insistence on majority Russian ownership of any joint-venture, particularly since BASF signed the Gazprom Nord Stream-Yuzhno-Russkoye deal in 2004 with a 49–51 structure, as opposed to the older 50–50 split of British Petroleum&#x27;s TNK-BP project.

== Intelligence career ==

In 1975, Putin joined the KGB and trained at the 401st KGB School in Okhta, Leningrad. After training, he worked in the Second Chief Directorate (counterintelligence), before he was transferred to the First Chief Directorate, where he monitored foreigners and consular officials in Leningrad. In September 1984, Putin was sent to Moscow for further training at the Yuri Andropov Red Banner Institute.

From 1985 to 1990, he served in Dresden, East Germany, using a cover identity as a translator. While posted in Dresden, Putin worked as one of the KGB&#x27;s liaison officers to the Stasi secret police and was reportedly promoted to lieutenant colonel. According to the official Kremlin presidential site, the East German communist regime commended Putin with a bronze medal for &quot;faithful service to the National People&#x27;s Army&quot;. Putin has publicly conveyed delight over his activities in Dresden, once recounting his confrontations with anti-communist protestors of 1989 who attempted the occupation of Stasi buildings in the city.

&quot;Putin and his colleagues were reduced mainly to collecting press clippings, thus contributing to the mountains of useless information produced by the KGB&quot;, Russian-American Masha Gessen wrote in their 2012 biography of Putin. His work was also downplayed by former Stasi spy chief Markus Wolf and Putin&#x27;s former KGB colleague Vladimir Usoltsev. Journalist Catherine Belton wrote in 2020 that this downplaying was actually cover for Putin&#x27;s involvement in KGB coordination and support for the terrorist Red Army Faction, whose members frequently hid in East Germany with the support of the Stasi. Dresden was preferred as a &quot;marginal&quot; town with only a small presence of Western intelligence services. According to an anonymous source who claimed to be a former RAF member, at one of these meetings in Dresden the militants presented Putin with a list of weapons that were later delivered to the RAF in West Germany. Klaus Zuchold, who claimed to be recruited by Putin, said that Putin handled a neo-Nazi, Rainer Sonntag, and attempted to recruit an author of a study on poisons. Putin reportedly met Germans to be recruited for wireless communications affairs together with an interpreter. He was involved in wireless communications technologies in South-East Asia due to trips of German engineers, recruited by him, there and to the West. However, a 2023 investigation by &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reported that the anonymous source had never been an RAF member and is &quot;considered a notorious fabulist&quot; with &quot;several previous convictions, including for making false statements&quot;.
According to Putin&#x27;s official biography, during the fall of the Berlin Wall that began on 9 November 1989, he saved the files of the Soviet Cultural Center (House of Friendship) and of the KGB villa in Dresden for the official authorities of the would-be united Germany to prevent demonstrators, including KGB and Stasi agents, from obtaining and destroying them. He then supposedly burnt only the KGB files, in a few hours, but saved the archives of the Soviet Cultural Center for the German authorities. Nothing is told about the selection criteria during this burning; for example, concerning Stasi files or about files of other agencies of the German Democratic Republic or of the USSR. He explained that many documents were left to Germany only because the furnace burst but many documents of the KGB villa were sent to Moscow.

After the collapse of the Communist East German government, Putin was to resign from active KGB service because of suspicions aroused regarding his loyalty during demonstrations in Dresden and earlier, although the KGB and the Soviet Army still operated in eastern Germany. He returned to Leningrad in early 1990 as a member of the &quot;active reserves&quot;, where he worked for about three months with the International Affairs section of Leningrad State University, reporting to Vice-Rector Yuriy Molchanov, while working on his doctoral dissertation.

There, he looked for new KGB recruits, watched the student body, and renewed his friendship with his former professor, Anatoly Sobchak, soon to be the Mayor of Leningrad. Putin claims that he resigned with the rank of lieutenant colonel on 20 August 1991, on the second day of the 1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt against Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev. Putin said: &quot;As soon as the coup began, I immediately decided which side I was on&quot;, although he noted that the choice was hard because he had spent the best part of his life with &quot;the organs&quot;.

== Political career ==


=== 1990–1996: Saint Petersburg administration ===

In May 1990, Putin was appointed as an advisor on international affairs to the mayor of Leningrad Anatoly Sobchak. In a 2017 interview with Oliver Stone, Putin said that he resigned from the KGB in 1991, following the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev, as he did not agree with what had happened and did not want to be part of the intelligence in the new administration. According to Putin&#x27;s statements in 2018 and 2021, he may have worked as a private taxi driver to earn extra money, or considered such a job.

On 28 June 1991, Putin became head of the Committee for External Relations of the Mayor&#x27;s Office, with responsibility for promoting international relations and foreign investments and registering business ventures. Within a year, Putin was investigated by the city legislative council led by Marina Salye. It was concluded that he had understated prices and permitted the export of metals valued at $93 million in exchange for foreign food aid that never arrived. Despite the investigators&#x27; recommendation that Putin be fired, Putin remained head of the Committee for External Relations until 1996. From 1994 to 1996, he held several other political and governmental positions in Saint Petersburg.

In March 1994, Putin was appointed as first deputy chairman of the Government of Saint Petersburg. In May 1995, he organized the Saint Petersburg branch of the pro-government Our Home – Russia political party, the liberal party of power founded by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. In 1995, he managed the legislative election campaign for that party, and from 1995 through June 1997, he was the leader of its Saint Petersburg branch.

=== 1996–1998: Early Moscow career ===
In June 1996, Sobchak lost his bid for re-election in Saint Petersburg, and Putin, who had led his election campaign, resigned from his positions in the city administration. He moved to Moscow and was appointed as deputy chief of the Presidential Property Management Department headed by Pavel Borodin. He occupied this position until March 1997. He was responsible for the foreign property of the state and organized the transfer of the former assets of the Soviet Union and the CPSU to the Russian Federation.

On 26 March 1997, President Boris Yeltsin appointed Putin deputy chief of the Presidential Staff, a post which he retained until May 1998, and chief of the Main Control Directorate of the Presidential Property Management Department (until June 1998). His predecessor in this position was Alexei Kudrin and his successor was Nikolai Patrushev, both future prominent politicians and Putin&#x27;s associates. On 3 April 1997, Putin was promoted to 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation—the highest federal state civilian service rank.

On 27 June 1997, at the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute, guided by rector Vladimir Litvinenko, Putin defended his Candidate of Science dissertation in economics, titled &quot;Strategic Planning of the Reproduction of the Mineral Resource Base of a Region under Conditions of the Formation of Market Relations&quot;. This exemplified the custom in Russia whereby a young rising official would write a scholarly work in mid-career. Putin&#x27;s thesis was plagiarized. Fellows at the Brookings Institution found that 15 pages were copied from an American textbook.

On 25 May 1998, Putin was appointed First Deputy Chief of the Presidential Staff for the regions, in succession to Viktoriya Mitina. On 15 July, he was appointed head of the commission for the preparation of agreements on the delimitation of the power of the regions and head of the federal center attached to the president, replacing Sergey Shakhray. After Putin&#x27;s appointment, the commission completed no such agreements, although during Shakhray&#x27;s term as the head of the Commission 46 such agreements had been signed. Later, after becoming president, Putin cancelled all 46 agreements. 

=== 1998–1999: Director of FSB === 

On 25 July 1998, Yeltsin appointed Putin director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the primary intelligence and security organization of the Russian Federation and the successor to the KGB. During his tenure as director of the FSB, Putin focused on reorganizing and strengthening the agency, restoring its effectiveness after years of perceived decline following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This period is seen as formative in shaping his approach to governance, marked by consolidating power, suppressing dissent, controlling information, and reinforcing state security.

A week after Putin&#x27;s appointment as FSB director, journalist Anatoly Levin-Utkin was murdered while investigating corruption allegations involving Putin, in what was suspected to be a targeted killing to silence dissent.

=== 1999: First premiership ===


On 9 August 1999, Putin was appointed one of three first deputy prime ministers, and later on that day, was appointed acting prime minister of the Government of the Russian Federation by President Yeltsin. Yeltsin also announced that he wanted to see Putin as his successor. Later on that same day, Putin agreed to run for the presidency.

On 16 August, the State Duma approved his appointment as prime minister with 233 votes in favor (vs. 84 against, 17 abstained), while a simple majority of 226 was required, making him Russia&#x27;s fifth prime minister in fewer than eighteen months. On his appointment, few expected Putin, virtually unknown to the general public, to last any longer than his predecessors. He was initially regarded as a Yeltsin loyalist; like other prime ministers of Boris Yeltsin, Putin did not choose ministers himself, his cabinet was determined by the presidential administration.

Yeltsin&#x27;s main opponents and would-be successors were already campaigning to replace the ailing president, and they fought hard to prevent Putin&#x27;s emergence as a potential successor. Following the September 1999 Russian apartment bombings and the invasion of Dagestan by mujahideen, including the former KGB agents, based in the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, Putin&#x27;s law-and-order image and unrelenting approach to the Second Chechen War soon combined to raise his popularity and allowed him to overtake his rivals.

While not formally associated with any party, Putin pledged his support to the newly formed Unity Party, which won the second largest percentage of the popular vote (23.3%) in the December 1999 Duma elections, and in turn supported Putin.

=== 1999–2000: Acting presidency ===

On 31 December 1999, Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned and, according to the Constitution of Russia, Putin became Acting President of the Russian Federation. On assuming this role, Putin went on a previously scheduled visit to Russian troops in Chechnya.

The first presidential decree that Putin signed on 31 December 1999 was titled &quot;On guarantees for the former president of the Russian Federation and the members of his family&quot;. This ensured that &quot;corruption charges against the outgoing President and his relatives&quot; would not be pursued. This was most notably targeted at the Mabetex bribery case in which Yeltsin&#x27;s family members were involved. On 30 August 2000, a criminal investigation (number 18/238278-95) in which Putin himself, as a member of the Saint Petersburg city government, was one of the suspects, was dropped.

On 30 December 2000, yet another case against the prosecutor general was dropped &quot;for lack of evidence&quot;, despite thousands of documents having been forwarded by Swiss prosecutors. On 12 February 2001, Putin signed a similar federal law which replaced the decree of 1999. A case regarding Putin&#x27;s alleged corruption in metal exports from 1992 was brought back by Marina Salye, but she was silenced and forced to leave Saint Petersburg.

While his opponents had been preparing for an election in June 2000, Yeltsin&#x27;s resignation resulted in the presidential elections being held on 26 March 2000; Putin won in the first round with 53% of the vote.

=== 2000–2004: First presidential term ===

The inauguration of President Putin occurred on 7 May 2000. He appointed the minister of finance, Mikhail Kasyanov, as prime minister. The first major challenge to Putin&#x27;s popularity came in August 2000, when he was criticized for the alleged mishandling of the &quot;Kursk&quot; submarine disaster. That criticism was largely because it took several days for Putin to return from vacation, and several more before he visited the scene.

Between 2000 and 2004, Putin set about the reconstruction of the impoverished condition of the country, apparently winning a power-struggle with the Russian oligarchs, reaching a &#x27;grand bargain&#x27; with them. This bargain allowed the oligarchs to maintain most of their powers, in exchange for their explicit support for—and alignment with—Putin&#x27;s government.

The Moscow theater hostage crisis occurred in October 2002. Many in the Russian press and in the international media warned that the deaths of 130 hostages in the special forces&#x27; rescue operation during the crisis would severely damage President Putin&#x27;s popularity. However, shortly after the siege had ended, the Russian president enjoyed record public approval ratings—83% of Russians declared themselves satisfied with Putin and his handling of the siege.

In 2003, a referendum was held in Chechnya, adopting a new constitution which declares that the Republic of Chechnya is a part of Russia; on the other hand, the region did acquire autonomy. Chechnya has been gradually stabilized with the establishment of the Parliamentary elections and a Regional Government. Throughout the Second Chechen War, Russia severely disabled the Chechen rebel movement; however, sporadic attacks by rebels continued to occur throughout the northern Caucasus.

=== 2004–2008: Second presidential term ===

On 14 March 2004, Putin was elected to the presidency for a second term, receiving 71% of the vote. The Beslan school hostage crisis took place on 1–3 September 2004; more than 330 people died, including 186 children.

The near 10-year period prior to the rise of Putin after the dissolution of Soviet rule was a time of upheaval in Russia. In a 2005 Kremlin speech, Putin characterized the collapse of the Soviet Union as the &quot;greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century&quot;. Putin elaborated, &quot;Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself&quot;. The country&#x27;s cradle-to-grave social safety net was gone and life expectancy declined in the period preceding Putin&#x27;s rule. In 2005, the National Priority Projects were launched to improve Russia&#x27;s health care, education, housing, and agriculture.

The continued criminal prosecution of the wealthiest man in Russia at the time, president of Yukos oil and gas company Mikhail Khodorkovsky, for fraud and tax evasion was seen by the international press as a retaliation for Khodorkovsky&#x27;s donations to both liberal and communist opponents of the Kremlin. Khodorkovsky was arrested, Yukos was bankrupted, and the company&#x27;s assets were auctioned at below-market value, with the largest share acquired by the state company Rosneft. The fate of Yukos was seen as a sign of a broader shift of Russia towards a system of state capitalism. This was underscored in July 2014, when shareholders of Yukos were awarded $50 billion in compensation by the Permanent Arbitration Court in The Hague.

On 7 October 2006, Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist who exposed corruption in the Russian army and its conduct in Chechnya, was shot in the lobby of her apartment building, on Putin&#x27;s birthday. The death of Politkovskaya triggered international criticism, with accusations that Putin had failed to protect the country&#x27;s new independent media. Putin himself said that her death caused the government more problems than her writings.

In January 2007, Putin met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at his Black Sea residence in Sochi, two weeks after Russia switched off oil supplies to Germany. Putin brought his black Labrador Konni in front of Merkel, who has a noted phobia of dogs and looked visibly uncomfortable in its presence, adding, &quot;I&#x27;m sure it will behave itself&quot;, causing a furor among the German press corps. When asked about the incident in a January 2016 interview with Bild, Putin claimed he was not aware of her phobia, adding, &quot;I wanted to make her happy. When I found out that she did not like dogs, I of course apologized&quot;. Merkel later told a group of reporters, &quot;I understand why he has to do this – to prove he&#x27;s a man. He&#x27;s afraid of his own weakness. Russia has nothing, no successful politics or economy. All they have is this&quot;.

In a speech in February 2007 at the Munich Security Conference, Putin complained about the feeling of insecurity engendered by the dominant position in geopolitics of the United States and observed that a former NATO official had made rhetorical promises not to expand into new countries in Eastern Europe.

On 14 July 2007, Putin announced that Russia would suspend implementation of its Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe obligations, effective after 150 days, and suspend its ratification of the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, which treaty was shunned by NATO members abeyant Russian withdrawal from Transnistria and the Republic of Georgia. Moscow continued to participate in the joint consultative group, because it hoped that dialogue could lead to the creation of an effective, new conventional arms control regime in Europe. Russia did specify steps that NATO could take to end the suspension. &quot;These include [NATO] members cutting their arms allotments and further restricting temporary weapons deployments on each NATO member&#x27;s territory. Russia also want[ed] constraints eliminated on how many forces it can deploy in its southern and northern flanks. Moreover, it is pressing NATO members to ratify a 1999 updated version of the accord, known as the Adapted CFE Treaty, and demanding that the four alliance members outside the original treaty, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovenia, join it.&quot;

In early 2007, &quot;Dissenters&#x27; Marches&quot; were organized by the opposition group The Other Russia, led by former chess champion Garry Kasparov and national-Bolshevist leader Eduard Limonov. Following prior warnings, demonstrations in several Russian cities were met by police action, which included interfering with the travel of the protesters and the arrests of as many as 150 people who attempted to break through police lines.

On 12 September 2007, Putin dissolved the government upon the request of Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov. Fradkov commented that it was to give the President a &quot;free hand&quot; in the run-up to the parliamentary election. Viktor Zubkov was appointed the new prime minister. On 19 September 2007, Putin&#x27;s nuclear-capable bombers commenced exercises near the US, for the first time since the downfall of the USSR.

In December 2007, United Russia—the governing party that supports the policies of Putin—won 64.24% of the popular vote in their run for State Duma according to election preliminary results. United Russia&#x27;s victory in the December 2007 elections was seen by many as an indication of strong popular support of the then Russian leadership and its policies. On 11 February 2008, while Putin addressed the 15th anniversary party of Gazprom, its employees threatened Ukraine with a stoppage of flow.

On 4 April 2008 at the NATO Bucharest summit, invitee Putin told George W. Bush and other conference delegates: &quot;We view the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our border as a direct threat to the security of our nation. The claim that this process is not directed against Russia will not suffice. National security is not based on promises&quot;.

=== 2008–2012: Second premiership ===


Putin was barred from a third consecutive term by the Constitution. First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was elected his successor. In a power-switching operation on 8 May 2008, only a day after handing the presidency to Medvedev, Putin was appointed Prime Minister of Russia, maintaining his political dominance.

Putin has said that overcoming the consequences of the world economic crisis was one of the two main achievements of his second premiership. The other was stabilizing the size of Russia&#x27;s population between 2008 and 2011 following a long period of demographic collapse that began in the 1990s.

The Russo-Georgian War that both started and finished in August 2008 was imagined by Putin and communicated to his staff as early 2006.

It was during this premiership that the 2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute occurred, and Putin controlled the Gazprom chessboard, according to Andriy Kobolyev, who was then an advisor to the CEO of the Ukrainian Naftogaz utility. Putin observed at a German trade show in 2010 that if his hosts did not want Russia&#x27;s natural gas nor nuclear power they could always heat with wood, and for that they would need to log Siberia.

At the United Russia Congress in Moscow on 24 September 2011, Medvedev officially proposed that Putin stand for the presidency in 2012, an offer Putin accepted. Given United Russia&#x27;s near-total dominance of Russian politics, many observers believed that Putin was assured of a third term. The move was expected to see Medvedev stand on the United Russia ticket in the parliamentary elections in December, with a goal of becoming prime minister at the end of his presidential term.

After the parliamentary elections on 4 December 2011, tens of thousands of Russians engaged in protests against alleged electoral fraud, the largest protests in Putin&#x27;s time. Protesters criticized Putin and United Russia and demanded annulment of the election results. Those protests sparked the fear of a colour revolution in society. Putin allegedly organized a number of paramilitary groups loyal to himself and to the United Russia party in the period between 2005 and 2012.

=== 2012–2018: Third presidential term ===
Shortly after Medvedev took office in 2008, presidential terms were extended from four to six years, effective with the 2012 election.

On 24 September 2011, while speaking at the United Russia party congress, Medvedev announced that he would recommend the party nominate Putin as its presidential candidate. He also revealed that the two men had long ago cut a deal to allow Putin to run for president in 2012. This switch was termed by many in the media as &quot;Rokirovka&quot;, the Russian term for the chess move &quot;castling&quot;.

On 4 March 2012, Putin won the 2012 Russian presidential election in the first round, with 63.6% of the vote, despite widespread accusations of vote-rigging. Opposition groups accused Putin and the United Russia party of fraud. While efforts to make the elections transparent were publicized, including the usage of webcams in polling stations, the vote was criticized by the Russian opposition and by international observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe for procedural irregularities.

Anti-Putin protests took place during and directly after the presidential campaign. The most notorious protest was the Pussy Riot performance on 21 February, and subsequent trial. An estimated 8,000–20,000 protesters gathered in Moscow on 6 May, when eighty people were injured in confrontations with police, and 450 were arrested, with another 120 arrests taking place the following day. A counter-protest of Putin supporters occurred which culminated in a gathering of an estimated 130,000 supporters at the Luzhniki Stadium, Russia&#x27;s largest stadium. Some of the attendees stated that they had been paid to come, were forced to come by their employers, or were misled into believing that they were going to attend a folk festival instead. The rally is considered to be the largest in support of Putin to date.

Putin&#x27;s presidency was inaugurated in the Kremlin on 7 May 2012. On his first day as president, Putin issued 14 presidential decrees, which are sometimes called the &quot;May Decrees&quot; by the media, including a lengthy one stating wide-ranging goals for the Russian economy. Other decrees concerned education, housing, skilled labor training, relations with the European Union, the defense industry, inter-ethnic relations, and other policy areas dealt with in Putin&#x27;s program articles issued during the presidential campaign.

In 2012 and 2013, Putin and the United Russia party backed stricter legislation against the LGBT community, in Saint Petersburg, Archangelsk, and Novosibirsk; a law called the Russian gay propaganda law, that is against &quot;homosexual propaganda&quot; (which prohibits such symbols as the rainbow flag, as well as published works containing homosexual content) was adopted by the State Duma in June 2013. Responding to international concerns about Russia&#x27;s legislation, Putin asked critics to note that the law was a &quot;ban on the propaganda of pedophilia and homosexuality&quot; and he stated that homosexual visitors to the 2014 Winter Olympics should &quot;leave the children in peace&quot; but denied there was any &quot;professional, career or social discrimination&quot; against homosexuals in Russia.

In June 2013, Putin attended a televised rally of the All-Russia People&#x27;s Front where he was elected head of the movement, which was set up in 2011. According to journalist Steve Rosenberg, the movement is intended to &quot;reconnect the Kremlin to the Russian people&quot; and one day, if necessary, replace the increasingly unpopular United Russia party that currently backs Putin.

==== Annexation of Crimea ====

In February 2014, Russia made several military incursions into Ukrainian territory. After the Euromaidan protests and the fall of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, Russian soldiers without insignias took control of strategic positions and infrastructure within the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. Russia then annexed Crimea and Sevastopol after a referendum in which, according to official results, Crimeans voted to join the Russian Federation.
Subsequently, demonstrations against Ukrainian Rada legislative actions by pro-Russian groups in the Donbas area of Ukraine escalated into the Russo-Ukrainian War between the Ukrainian government and the Russia-backed separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People&#x27;s Republics. In August 2014, Russian military vehicles crossed the border in several locations of Donetsk Oblast. The incursion by the Russian military was seen by Ukrainian authorities as responsible for the defeat of Ukrainian forces in early September.

In October 2014, Putin addressed Russian security concerns in Sochi at the Valdai International Discussion Club. In November 2014, the Ukrainian military reported intensive movement of troops and equipment from Russia into the separatist-controlled parts of eastern Ukraine. The Associated Press reported 80 unmarked military vehicles on the move in rebel-controlled areas. An OSCE Special Monitoring Mission observed convoys of heavy weapons and tanks in DPR-controlled territory without insignia. OSCE monitors further stated that they observed vehicles transporting ammunition and soldiers&#x27; dead bodies crossing the Russian-Ukrainian border under the guise of humanitarian-aid convoys.

As of early August 2015, the OSCE observed over 21 such vehicles marked with the Russian military code for soldiers killed in action. According to &quot;The Moscow Times&quot;, Russia has tried to intimidate and silence human-rights workers discussing Russian soldiers&#x27; deaths in the conflict. The OSCE repeatedly reported that its observers were denied access to the areas controlled by &quot;combined Russian-separatist forces&quot;.

In October 2015, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Russia had redeployed some of its elite units from Ukraine to Syria in recent weeks to support Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. In December 2015, Putin admitted that Russian military intelligence officers were operating in Ukraine.

&quot;The Moscow Times&quot; quoted pro-Russian academic Andrei Tsygankov as saying that many members of the international community assumed that Putin&#x27;s annexation of Crimea had initiated a completely new type of Russian foreign policy and that his foreign policy had shifted &quot;from state-driven foreign policy&quot; to taking an offensive stance to recreate the Soviet Union. In July 2015, he opined that this policy shift could be understood as Putin trying to defend nations in Russia&#x27;s sphere of influence from &quot;encroaching western power&quot;.

==== Intervention in Syria ====


On 30 September 2015, President Putin authorized Russian military intervention in the Syrian civil war, following a formal request by the Syrian government for military help against rebel and jihadist groups.

The Russian military activities consisted of air strikes, cruise missile strikes and the use of front line advisors and Russian special forces against militant groups opposed to the Syrian government, including the Syrian opposition, as well as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), al-Nusra Front (al-Qaeda in the Levant), Hay&#x27;at Tahrir al-Sham, Ahrar al-Sham, and the Army of Conquest. After Putin&#x27;s announcement on 14 March 2016 that the mission he had set for the Russian military in Syria had been &quot;largely accomplished&quot; and ordered the withdrawal of the &quot;main part&quot; of the Russian forces from Syria, Russian forces deployed in Syria continued to actively operate in support of the Syrian government.

==== Russia&#x27;s interference in the 2016 US election ====
In January 2017, a U.S. intelligence community assessment expressed high confidence that Putin personally ordered an influence campaign, initially to denigrate Hillary Clinton and to harm her electoral chances and potential presidency, then later developing &quot;a clear preference&quot; for Donald Trump. Trump consistently denied any Russian interference in the U.S. election, as did Putin in December 2016, March 2017, June 2017, and July 2017.

Putin later stated that interference was &quot;theoretically possible&quot; and could have been perpetrated by &quot;patriotically minded&quot; Russian hackers, and on another occasion claimed &quot;not even Russians, but Ukrainians, Tatars or Jews, but with Russian citizenship&quot; might have been responsible. In July 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the CIA had long nurtured a Russian source who eventually rose to a position close to Putin, allowing the source to pass key information in 2016 about Putin&#x27;s direct involvement. Putin continued similar attempts in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

=== 2018–2024: Fourth presidential term ===

Putin won the 2018 Russian presidential election with more than 76% of the vote. His fourth term began on 7 May 2018. On the same day, Putin invited Dmitry Medvedev to form a new government. On 15 May 2018, Putin took part in the opening of the movement along the highway section of the Crimean bridge. On 18 May 2018, Putin signed decrees on the composition of the new Government. On 25 May 2018, Putin announced that he would not run for president in 2024, justifying this in compliance with the Russian Constitution. On 14 June 2018, Putin opened the 21st FIFA World Cup, which took place in Russia for the first time. On 18 October 2018, Putin said Russians will &#x27;go to Heaven as martyrs&#x27; in the event of a nuclear war as he would only use nuclear weapons in retaliation.
In September 2019, Putin&#x27;s administration interfered with the results of Russia&#x27;s nationwide regional elections and manipulated it by eliminating all candidates in the opposition. The event that was aimed at contributing to the ruling party, United Russia&#x27;s victory, also contributed to inciting mass protests for democracy, leading to large-scale arrests and cases of police brutality.

On 15 January 2020, Medvedev and his entire government resigned after Putin&#x27;s 2020 Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly. Putin suggested major constitutional amendments that could extend his political power after presidency. At the same time, on behalf of Putin, he continued to exercise his powers until the formation of a new government. Putin suggested that Medvedev take the newly created post of deputy chairman of the Security Council.

On the same day, Putin nominated Mikhail Mishustin, head of the country&#x27;s Federal Tax Service for the post of prime minister. The next day, he was confirmed by the State Duma to the post, and appointed prime minister by Putin&#x27;s decree. This was the first time ever that a prime minister was confirmed without any votes against. On 21 January 2020, Mishustin presented to Putin a draft structure of his Cabinet. On the same day, the president signed a decree on the structure of the Cabinet and appointed the proposed ministers.

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====
On 15 March 2020, Putin instructed to form a Working Group of the State Council to counteract the spread of COVID-19. Putin appointed Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin as the head of the group.

On 22 March 2020, after a phone call with Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte, Putin arranged the Russian army to send military medics, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy, which was the European country hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Putin began working remotely from his office at Novo-Ogaryovo. According to Dmitry Peskov, Putin passed daily tests for COVID-19, and his health was not in danger.

On 25 March, President Putin announced in a televised address to the nation that the 22 April constitutional referendum would be postponed due to COVID-19. He added that the next week would be a nationwide paid holiday and urged Russians to stay at home. Putin also announced a list of measures of social protection, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and changes in fiscal policy. Putin announced the following measures for microenterprises, small- and medium-sized businesses: deferring tax payments (except Russia&#x27;s value-added tax) for the next six months, cutting the size of social security contributions in half, deferring social security contributions, deferring loan repayments for the next six months, a six-month moratorium on fines, debt collection, and creditors&#x27; applications for bankruptcy of debtor enterprises.

On 2 April 2020, Putin again issued an address in which he announced prolongation of the non-working time until 30 April. Putin likened Russia&#x27;s fight against COVID-19 to Russia&#x27;s battles with invading Pecheneg and Cuman steppe nomads in the 10th and 11th centuries. In a 24 to 27 April Levada poll, 48% of Russian respondents said that they disapproved of Putin&#x27;s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and his strict isolation and lack of leadership during the crisis was widely commented as sign of losing his &quot;strongman&quot; image.
In June 2021, Putin said he was fully vaccinated against the disease with the Sputnik V vaccine, emphasising that while vaccinations should be voluntary, making them mandatory in some professions would slow down the spread of COVID-19. In September, Putin entered self-isolation after people in his inner circle tested positive for the disease. According to a report by the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, Putin&#x27;s inner circle of advisors shrank during the COVID-19 lockdown to a small number of hawkish advisers.

==== Constitutional referendum and amendments ====

Putin signed an executive order on 3 July 2020 to officially insert amendments into the Russian Constitution, allowing him to run for two additional six-year terms. These amendments took effect on 4 July 2020.

In 2020 and 2021, protests were held in the Khabarovsk Krai in Russia&#x27;s Far East in support of arrested regional governor Sergei Furgal. The 2020 Khabarovsk Krai protests became increasingly anti-Putin over time. A July 2020 Levada poll found that 45% of surveyed Russians supported the protests. On 22 December 2020, Putin signed a bill giving lifetime prosecutorial immunity to Russian ex-presidents.

==== 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis ====

In July 2021, Putin published an essay titled &quot;On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians&quot;, in which he states that Belarusians, Ukrainians and Russians should be in one All-Russian nation as a part of the Russian world and are &quot;one people&quot; whom &quot;forces that have always sought to undermine our unity&quot; wanted to &quot;divide and rule&quot;. The essay denies the existence of Ukraine as an independent nation.

On 30 November 2021, Putin stated that an enlargement of NATO in Ukraine would be a &quot;red line&quot; issue for Russia. The Kremlin repeatedly denied that it had any plans to invade Ukraine, and Putin himself dismissed such fears as &quot;alarmist&quot;. On 21 February 2022, Putin signed a decree recognizing the two self-proclaimed separatist republics in Donbas as independent states and made an address concerning the events in Ukraine.

Putin was persuaded to invade Ukraine by a small group of his closest associates, especially Nikolai Patrushev, Yury Kovalchuk and Alexander Bortnikov. According to sources close to the Kremlin, most of Putin&#x27;s advisers and associates opposed the invasion, but Putin overruled them. The invasion of Ukraine had been planned for almost a year.

==== Full-scale invasion of Ukraine (2022–present) ====
On 24 February, Putin in a televised address announced a &quot;special military operation&quot; (SMO) in Ukraine, launching an invasion. Citing &quot;denazification&quot;, he claimed to be invading to protect people in the Russian-speaking Donbas region who, according to Putin, faced &quot;humiliation and genocide&quot;. He launched a war to gain control of the rest of Ukraine and overthrow the elected government under the pretext it was run by Nazis. Russia&#x27;s invasion was met with international condemnation. International sanctions were imposed against Russia, including against Putin. The invasion led to calls for Putin to be charged with war crimes. The International Criminal Court (ICC) stated that it would investigate possible war crimes in Ukraine since 2013, and the US pledged to help the ICC to prosecute Putin for war crimes. In response, Putin put the Strategic Rocket Forces&#x27;s nuclear deterrence units on high alert. By March, U.S. intelligence agencies determined that Putin was frustrated by slow progress due to unexpectedly strong Ukrainian defense.
On 4 March, Putin signed a law introducing prison sentences of up to 15 years for publishing &quot;knowingly false information&quot; about the Russian military and its operations, leading to some media outlets in Russia stopping reporting on Ukraine. On 7 March, as a condition for ending the invasion, the Kremlin demanded Ukraine&#x27;s neutrality, recognition of Crimea as Russian territory, and the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. Putin promised that no conscripts would be used in the SMO. On 16 March, Putin issued a warning to Russian &quot;traitors&quot; who he said the West wanted to use as a &quot;fifth column&quot; to destroy Russia. Following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia&#x27;s long-term demographic crisis deepened due to emigration, lower fertility rates and war casualties.

As early as 25 March, the UN Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights reported that Putin ordered a &quot;kidnapping&quot; policy, whereby Ukrainian nationals who did not cooperate with the Russian takeover of their homeland were victimized by FSB agents. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was sure Putin thought the Ukrainians would welcome the invading force with &quot;flowers and smiles&quot; while he negotiated that Ukraine would become a non-aligned state.

In September, Putin announced a partial mobilization, following a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv as well as annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine.
On 30 September, Putin signed decrees which annexed Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson Oblasts of Ukraine into Russia. The annexations are not recognized by the international community and are illegal under international law. On 11 November the same year, Ukraine liberated Kherson.

In December 2022, he said a war against Ukraine could be a &quot;long process&quot;. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the Russo-Ukrainian War. In January 2023, Putin cited recognition of Russia&#x27;s sovereignty over the annexed territories as a condition for peace talks.

In March 2023, Chinese president Xi Jinping visited Russia and met with Putin. It was the first international meeting of Putin since the ICC issued a warrant for his arrest.

In May 2023, South Africa announced it would grant diplomatic immunity to Putin to attend the 15th BRICS Summit. In July 2023, South African president Cyril Ramaphosa announced that Putin would not attend the summit &quot;by mutual agreement&quot; and instead send Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

In July 2023, Putin threatened to take &quot;reciprocal action&quot; if Ukraine used US-supplied cluster munitions during a Ukrainian counter-offensive. On 17 July, Putin withdrew from a deal that allowed Ukraine to export grain across the Black Sea despite a blockade, risking deepening the global food crisis and antagonizing neutral countries in the Global South.

On 27–28 July, Putin hosted the 2023 Russia–Africa Summit in St. Petersburg, attended by delegations from more than 40 African countries. , the total number of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers killed or wounded during the invasion was nearly 500,000.

Putin condemned the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel that sparked the Israel–Hamas war and said Israel had a right to defend itself, but criticized Israel&#x27;s response and said Israel should not besiege the Gaza Strip in the way Nazi Germany besieged Leningrad. Putin suggested Russia could be a mediator. Putin blamed the war on the US&#x27; policy in the Middle East and expressed concern over the suffering of Palestinian children. In a December 2023 call, Benjamin Netanyahu expressed displeasure to Putin, over Russia&#x27;s conduct at the UN and described its growing ties to Iran as dangerous.

In November 2023, Putin claimed Russia was always &quot;ready for talks&quot; to end the &quot;tragedy&quot; of the war in Ukraine, and accused Ukrainian leadership of rejecting peace talks. However, on 14 December 2023, Putin said, &quot;there will only be peace in Ukraine when we achieve our aims&quot;, which he said are &quot;de-Nazification, de-militarization and a neutral status&quot; of Ukraine. On 23 December, Putin was reported as signaling through intermediaries since September 2022 that &quot;he is open to a ceasefire that freezes the fighting along the current lines&quot;.
==== ICC arrest warrant ====


On 17 March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Putin&#x27;s arrest, alleging that Putin held criminal responsibility in the illegal deportation and transfer of children from Ukraine to Russia during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

It was the first time that the ICC had issued an arrest warrant for the head of state of one of the five Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council, (the world&#x27;s five principal nuclear powers).

The ICC simultaneously issued an arrest warrant for Maria Lvova-Belova, Commissioner for Children&#x27;s Rights in the Office of the President of the Russian Federation. Both are charged with:
:...the war crime of unlawful deportation of population (children) and that of unlawful transfer of population (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation...
...for their publicized program, since 24 February 2022, of forced deportations of thousands of unaccompanied Ukrainian children to Russia, from areas of eastern Ukraine under Russian control. 

Russia has maintained that the deportations were humanitarian efforts to protect orphans and other children abandoned in the conflict region.

==== 2023 Wagner rebellion ====

On 23 June 2023, the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization, rebelled against the government of Russia. The revolt arose amidst escalating tensions between the Russian Ministry of Defense and Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Wagner.

Prigozhin portrayed the rebellion as a response to an alleged attack on his forces by the ministry. He dismissed the government&#x27;s justification for invading Ukraine, blamed Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu for the country&#x27;s military shortcomings, and accused him of waging the war for the benefit of Russian oligarchs. In a televised address on 24 June, Russian president Vladimir Putin denounced Wagner&#x27;s actions as treason and pledged to quell the rebellion.

Prigozhin&#x27;s forces seized control of Rostov-on-Don and the Southern Military District headquarters and advanced towards Moscow in an armored column. Following negotiations with Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, Prigozhin agreed to stand down and, late on 24 June, began withdrawing from Rostov-on-Don.

On 23 August 2023, exactly two months after the rebellion, Prigozhin was killed along with nine other people when a business jet crashed in Tver Oblast, north of Moscow. Western intelligence reported that the crash was probably caused by an explosion on board, and it is widely suspected that the Russian state were involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Troianovski_Barnes_Schmitt_8/24/2023&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2024–present: Fifth presidential term ===

Putin won the 2024 Russian presidential election with 88.48% of the vote. International observers did not consider the election to be either free or fair, with Putin having increased political repressions after launching his full-scale war with Ukraine in 2022. The elections were also held in the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine. There were reports of irregularities, including ballot stuffing and coercion, with statistical analysis suggesting unprecedented levels of fraud in the 2024 elections.

On 22 March 2024, the Crocus City Hall attack took place, causing the deaths of at least 145 people and injuring at least 551 more. It was the deadliest terrorist attack on Russian soil since the Beslan school siege in 2004.

On 7 May 2024, Putin was inaugurated as president of Russia for the fifth time. According to analysts, replacing Sergei Shoigu with Andrey Belousov as defense minister signals that Putin wants to transform the Russian economy into a war economy and is &quot;preparing for many more years of war&quot;. In May 2024, four Russian sources told Reuters that Putin was ready to end the war in Ukraine with a negotiated ceasefire that would recognize Russia&#x27;s war gains and freeze the war on current front lines, as Putin wanted to avoid unpopular steps such as further nationwide mobilization and increased war spending.

On 2 August 2024, Putin pardoned American journalist Evan Gershkovich, opposition figures Vladimir Kara-Murza, Ilya Yashin and others in a prisoner swap with western countries. The 2024 Ankara prisoner exchange was the most extensive prisoner exchange between Russia and United States since the end of the Cold War, involving the release of twenty-six people.

On 25 September 2024, Putin warned the West that if attacked with conventional weapons Russia would consider a nuclear retaliation, in an apparent deviation from the no first use doctrine. Putin went on to threaten nuclear powers that if they supported another country&#x27;s attack on Russia, then they would be considered participants in such an aggression. Russia and the United States are the world&#x27;s biggest nuclear powers, holding about 88% of the world&#x27;s nuclear weapons. Putin has made several implicit nuclear threats since the outbreak of war against Ukraine. Experts say Putin&#x27;s announcement is aimed at dissuading the United States, the United Kingdom and France from allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied long-range missiles such as the Storm Shadow and ATACMS in strikes against Russia.

== Domestic policies ==


Putin&#x27;s domestic policies, particularly early in his first presidency, were aimed at creating a vertical power structure. On 13 May 2000, he issued a decree organizing the 89 federal subjects of Russia into seven administrative federal districts and appointed a presidential envoy responsible for each of those districts (whose official title is Plenipotentiary Representative).

According to Stephen White, under the presidency of Putin, Russia made it clear that it had no intention of establishing a &quot;second edition&quot; of the American or British political system, but rather a system that was closer to Russia&#x27;s own traditions and circumstances. Some commentators have described Putin&#x27;s administration as a &quot;sovereign democracy&quot;. According to the proponents of that description (primarily Vladislav Surkov), the government&#x27;s actions and policies ought above all to enjoy popular support within Russia itself and not be directed or influenced from outside the country.

The practice of the system is characterized by Swedish economist Anders Åslund as manual management, commenting: &quot;After Putin resumed the presidency in 2012, his rule is best described as &#x27;manual management&#x27; as the Russians like to put it. Putin does whatever he wants, with little consideration to the consequences with one important caveat. During the Russian financial crash of August 1998, Putin learned that financial crises are politically destabilizing and must be avoided at all costs. Therefore, he cares about financial stability&quot;

The period after 2012 saw mass protests against the falsification of elections, censorship and toughening of free assembly laws. In July 2000, according to a law proposed by Putin and approved by the Federal Assembly of Russia, Putin gained the right to dismiss the heads of the 89 federal subjects. In 2004, the direct election of those heads (usually called &quot;governors&quot;) by popular vote was replaced with a system whereby they would be nominated by the president and approved or disapproved by regional legislatures.

This was seen by Putin as a necessary move to stop separatist tendencies and get rid of those governors who were connected with organised crime. This and other government actions effected under Putin&#x27;s presidency have been criticized by many independent Russian media outlets and Western commentators as anti-democratic.

During his first term in office, Putin opposed some of the Yeltsin-era business oligarchs, as well as his political opponents, resulting in the exile or imprisonment of such people as Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky; other oligarchs such as Roman Abramovich and Arkady Rotenberg are friends and allies with Putin. Putin succeeded in codifying land law and tax law and promulgated new codes on labour, administrative, criminal, commercial and civil procedural law. Under Medvedev&#x27;s presidency, Putin&#x27;s government implemented some key reforms in the area of state security, the Russian police reform and the Russian military reform.

In 1999, Putin described communism as &quot;a blind alley, far away from the mainstream of civilization&quot;.

=== Economic, industrial, and energy policies ===

Sergey Guriyev, when talking about Putin&#x27;s economic policy, divided it into four distinct periods: the &quot;reform&quot; years of his first term (1999–2003); the &quot;statist&quot; years of his second term (2004—the first half of 2008); the world economic crisis and recovery (the second half of 2008–2013); and the Russo-Ukrainian War, Russia&#x27;s growing isolation from the global economy, and stagnation (2014–present).

In 2000, Putin launched the &quot;Programme for the Socio-Economic Development of the Russian Federation for the Period 2000–2010&quot;, but it was abandoned in 2008 when it was 30% complete. Fueled by the 2000s commodities boom including record-high oil prices, under the Putin administration from 2000 to 2016, an increase in income in USD terms was 4.5 times. During Putin&#x27;s first eight years in office, industry grew substantially, as did production, construction, real incomes, credit, and the middle class. A fund for oil revenue allowed Russia to repay Soviet Union&#x27;s debts by 2005. Russia joined the World Trade Organization in August 2012.

In 2006, Putin launched an industry consolidation programme to bring the main aircraft-producing companies under a single umbrella organization, the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC). In September 2020, the UAC general director announced that the UAC will receive the largest-ever post-Soviet government support package for the aircraft industry in order to pay and renegotiate the debt.

In 2014, Putin signed a deal to supply China with 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year. Power of Siberia, which Putin has called the &quot;world&#x27;s biggest construction project&quot;, was launched in 2019 and is expected to continue for 30 years at an ultimate cost to China of $400bn. The ongoing financial crisis began in the second half of 2014 when the Russian ruble collapsed due to a decline in the price of oil and international sanctions against Russia. These events in turn led to loss of investor confidence and capital flight, although it has also been argued that the sanctions had little to no effect on Russia&#x27;s economy. In 2014, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project named Putin their Person of the Year for furthering corruption and organized crime.

According to &quot;Meduza&quot;, Putin has since 2007 predicted on a number of occasions that Russia will become one of the world&#x27;s five largest economies. In 2013, he said Russia was one of the five biggest economies in terms of gross domestic product but still lagged behind other countries on indicators such as labour productivity. By the end of 2023, Putin planned to spend almost 40% of public expenditures on defense and security.

=== Environmental policy ===

In 2004, Putin signed the Kyoto Protocol treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, Russia did not face mandatory cuts, because the Kyoto Protocol limits emissions to a percentage increase or decrease from 1990 levels and Russia&#x27;s greenhouse-gas emissions fell well below the 1990 baseline due to a drop in economic output after the breakup of the Soviet Union, excluding emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF).

In 2019 Russia joined the Paris Agreement. Russia&#x27;s goal is to reach net zero by 2060, but its energy strategy to 2035 is mostly about burning more fossil fuels. Reporting military emissions is voluntary and, as of 2024, no data is available since before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Putin described climate change as a concerning fact with big consequences for Russia. He is not sure if it man made or not, but said that Russia is trying and will try to reduce man made emissions with forests and &quot;low-emission energy&quot;, by this term he intends Natural gas, Nuclear energy and Hydroenergy in Russia. He said that rich countries should provide finance and technology to those with less money for lower emissions. Some describe his policy as &quot;mimicry of climate policy&quot; and say he turned environmentalism into tool of political influence.

=== Religious policy ===
Putin regularly attends the most important services of the Russian Orthodox Church on the main holy days and has established a good relationship with Patriarchs of the Russian Church, the late Alexy II of Moscow and the current Kirill of Moscow. As president, Putin took an active personal part in promoting the Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate, signed 17 May 2007, which restored relations between the Moscow-based Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia after the 80-year schism.

Under Putin, the Hasidic Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia became increasingly influential within the Jewish community, partly due to the influence of Federation-supporting businessmen mediated through their alliances with Putin, notably Lev Leviev and Roman Abramovich. According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Putin is popular amongst the Russian Jewish community, who see him as a force for stability. Russia&#x27;s chief rabbi, Berel Lazar, said Putin &quot;paid great attention to the needs of our community and related to us with a deep respect&quot;. In 2016, Ronald S. Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, also praised Putin for making Russia &quot;a country where Jews are welcome&quot;.

Human rights organizations and religious freedom advocates have criticized the state of religious freedom in Russia. In 2016, Putin oversaw the passage of legislation that prohibited missionary activity in Russia. Nonviolent religious minority groups have been repressed under anti-extremism laws, especially Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. One of the 2020 amendments to the Constitution of Russia has a constitutional reference to God.

=== Military development ===
The resumption of long-distance flights of Russia&#x27;s strategic bombers was followed by the announcement by Russian defense minister Anatoliy Serdyukov during his meeting with Putin on 5 December 2007, that 11 ships, including the aircraft carrier &quot;Kuznetsov&quot;, would take part in the first major navy sortie into the Mediterranean since Soviet times.

Key elements of the reform included reducing the armed forces to a strength of one million, reducing the number of officers, centralising officer training from 65 military schools into 10 systemic military training centres, creating a professional NCO corps, reducing the size of the central command, introducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff, elimination of cadre-strength formations, reorganising the reserves, reorganising the army into a brigade system, and reorganising air forces into an airbase system instead of regiments.

According to the Kremlin, Putin embarked on a build-up of Russia&#x27;s nuclear capabilities because of U.S. president George W. Bush&#x27;s unilateral decision to withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. To counter what Putin sees as the United States&#x27; goal of undermining Russia&#x27;s strategic nuclear deterrent, Moscow has embarked on a program to develop new weapons capable of defeating any new American ballistic missile defense or interception system. Some analysts believe that this nuclear strategy under Putin has brought Russia into violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

Accordingly, U.S. president Donald Trump announced the U.S. would no longer consider itself bound by the treaty&#x27;s provisions, raising nuclear tensions between the two powers. This prompted Putin to state that Russia would not launch first in a nuclear conflict but that &quot;an aggressor should know that vengeance is inevitable, that he will be annihilated, and we would be the victims of the aggression. We will go to heaven as martyrs&quot;.

Putin has also sought to increase Russian territorial claims in the Arctic and its military presence there. In August 2007, Russian expedition Arktika 2007, part of research related to the 2001 Russian territorial extension claim, planted a flag on the seabed at the North Pole. Both Russian submarines and troops deployed in the Arctic have been increasing.

=== Human rights policy ===

New York City-based NGO Human Rights Watch, in a report entitled &quot;Laws of Attrition&quot;, authored by Hugh Williamson, the British director of HRW&#x27;s Europe &amp; Central Asia Division, has claimed that since May 2012, when Putin was reelected as president, Russia has enacted many restrictive laws, started inspections of non-governmental organizations, harassed, intimidated and imprisoned political activists, and started to restrict critics. The new laws include the &quot;foreign agents&quot; law, which is widely regarded as over-broad by including Russian human rights organizations which receive some international grant funding, the treason law, and the assembly law which penalizes many expressions of dissent. Human rights activists have criticized Russia for censoring speech of LGBT activists due to &quot;the gay propaganda law&quot; and increasing violence against LGBT+ people due to the law.

In 2020, Putin signed a law on labelling individuals and organizations receiving funding from abroad as &quot;foreign agents&quot;. The law is an expansion of &quot;foreign agent&quot; legislation adopted in 2012.

As of June 2020, per Memorial Human Rights Center, there were 380 political prisoners in Russia, including 63 individuals prosecuted, directly or indirectly, for political activities (including Alexey Navalny) and 245 prosecuted for their involvement with one of the Muslim organizations that are banned in Russia. 78 individuals on the list, i.e., more than 20% of the total, are residents of Crimea. As of December 2022, more than 4,000 people were prosecuted for criticizing the war in Ukraine under Russia&#x27;s war censorship laws.

=== The media ===
Scott Gehlbach, a professor of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, has claimed that since 1999, Putin has systematically punished journalists who challenge his official point of view. Maria Lipman, an American writing in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; claims, &quot;The crackdown that followed Putin&#x27;s return to the Kremlin in 2012 extended to the liberal media, which had until then been allowed to operate fairly independently&quot;. The Internet has attracted Putin&#x27;s attention because his critics have tried to use it to challenge his control of information. Marian K. Leighton, who worked for the CIA as a Soviet analyst in the 1980s says, &quot;Having muzzled Russia&#x27;s print and broadcast media, Putin focused his energies on the Internet&quot;.

Robert W. Orttung and Christopher Walker reported that &quot;Reporters Without Borders, for instance, ranked Russia 148 in its 2013 list of 179 countries in terms of freedom of the press. It particularly criticized Russia for the crackdown on the political opposition and the failure of the authorities to vigorously pursue and bring to justice criminals who have murdered journalists. Freedom House ranks Russian media as &quot;not free&quot;, indicating that basic safeguards and guarantees for journalists and media enterprises are absent. About two-thirds of Russians use television as their primary source of daily news, while around 85% of Russians get most of their information from Russian state media.

In the early 2000s, Putin and his circle began promoting the idea in Russian media that they are the modern-day version of the 17th-century Romanov tsars who ended Russia&#x27;s &quot;Time of Troubles&quot;, meaning they claim to be the peacemakers and stabilizers after the fall of the Soviet Union. Since the 2022 Ukraine invasion, Putin has only once granted an interview to a Western journalist, namely Tucker Carlson in February 2024.

=== Promoting conservatism ===
Putin has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural, and political matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and neoliberalism and is identified by scholars with Russian conservatism. Putin has promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by the conservative right-wing journalist Alexander Prokhanov, stresses (i) Russian nationalism, (ii) the restoration of Russia&#x27;s historical greatness, and (iii) systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies. Vladislav Surkov, a senior government official, has been one of the key economics consultants during Putin&#x27;s presidency.

In cultural and social affairs Putin has collaborated closely with the Russian Orthodox Church. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, head of the Church, endorsed his election in 2012 stating Putin&#x27;s terms were like &quot;a miracle of God&quot;. Steven Myers reports, &quot;The church, once heavily repressed, had emerged from the Soviet collapse as one of the most respected institutions... Now Kiril led the faithful directly into an alliance with the state&quot;.

Mark Woods, a Baptist Union of Great Britain minister and contributing editor to &quot;Christian Today&quot;, provides specific examples of how the Church has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Some Russian Orthodox believers consider Putin a corrupt and brutal strongman or even a tyrant. Others do not admire him but appreciate that he aggravates their political opponents. Still others appreciate that Putin defends some although not all Orthodox teachings, whether or not he believes in them himself.

On abortion, Putin stated: &quot;In the modern world, the decision is up to the woman herself&quot;. This put him at odds with the Russian Orthodox Church. In 2020, he supported efforts to reduce the number of abortions instead of prohibiting it. On 28 November 2023, during a speech to the World Russian People&#x27;s Council, Putin urged Russian women to have &quot;seven, eight, or even more children&quot; and said &quot;large families must become the norm, a way of life for all of Russia&#x27;s people&quot;.

Putin supported the 2020 Russian constitutional referendum, which passed and defined marriage as a relationship between one man and one woman in the Constitution of Russia.

=== International sporting events ===

In 2007, Putin led a successful effort on behalf of Sochi for the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics, the first Winter Olympic Games to ever be hosted by Russia. In 2008, the city of Kazan won the bid for the 2013 Summer Universiade; on 2 December 2010, Russia won the right to host the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup, also for the first time in Russian history. In 2013, Putin stated that gay athletes would not face any discrimination at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.

== Foreign policy ==


Generally, Putin&#x27;s tenure experiences tensions with the west. Anna Borshchevskaya, in her 2022 book, summarizes Putin main foreign policy objectives as originating in his 30 December 1999 document which appeared on the government&#x27;s website, &quot;Russia at the Turn of the Millenium&quot;. She presents Putin as orienting himself to the plan that &quot;Russia is a country with unique values in danger of losing its unitywhich... is a historic Russian fear. This again points to the fundamental issue of Russia&#x27;s identity issuesand how the state had manipulated these to drive anti-Western security narratives with the aim of eroding the US-led global order... Moreover, a look at Russia&#x27;s distribution of forces over the years under Putin has been heavily weighted towards the south (Syria, Ukraine, Middle East), another indicator of the Kremlin&#x27;s threat perceptions&quot;.

Leonid Bershidsky analyzed Putin&#x27;s interview with the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and concluded, &quot;Putin is an imperialist of the old Soviet school, rather than a nationalist or a racist, and he has cooperated with, and promoted, people who are known to be gay&quot;. Putin spoke favorably of artificial intelligence in regard to foreign policy, &quot;Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind. It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world&quot;.

=== Asia ===


In 2012, Putin wrote an article in Indian newspaper &quot;The Hindu&quot;, saying: &quot;The Declaration on Strategic Partnership between India and Russia signed in October 2000 became a truly historic step&quot;. India remains the largest customer of Russian military equipment, and the two countries share a historically strong strategic and diplomatic relationship. In October 2022, Putin described India and China as &quot;close allies and partners&quot;.

Under Putin, Russia has maintained positive relations with the Asian states of SCO and BRICS, which include China, India, Pakistan, and post-Soviet states of Central Asia. In the 21st century, Sino-Russian relations have significantly strengthened bilaterally and economically—the Treaty of Friendship, and the construction of the ESPO oil pipeline and the Power of Siberia gas pipeline formed a &quot;special relationship&quot; between the two great powers.

Putin and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe frequently met each other to discuss the Japan–Russia territorial disputes. Putin also voiced his willingness of constructing a rail bridge between the two countries. Despite numerous meetings, no agreement was signed before Abe&#x27;s resignation in 2020.
Putin made three visits to Mongolia and has enjoyed good relations with its neighbor. Putin and his Mongolian counterpart signed a permanent treaty on friendship between the two states in September 2019, further enhancing trade and cultural exchanges. Putin became the first Russian or Soviet leader to visit Indonesia in half a century in 2007, resulting in the signing of an arms deal. In another visit, Putin commented on long-standing ties and friendship between Russia and Indonesia. Russia has also boosted relations with Vietnam after 2011, and with Afghanistan in the 2010s, giving military and economic aid. The relations between Russia and the Philippines received a boost in 2016 as Putin forged closer bilateral ties with his Filipino counterpart, Rodrigo Duterte. Putin has good relations with Malaysia and its then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Putin also made the first Russian or Soviet leader to visit North Korea, meeting Kim Jong-il in July 2000, shortly after a visit to South Korea.

Putin criticized violence in Myanmar against Rohingya minorities in 2017. Following the 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;état, Russia has pledged to boost ties with the Myanmar military regime.

=== Post-Soviet states ===


Under Putin, the Kremlin has consistently stated that Russia has a sphere of influence and &quot;privileged interests&quot; over other Post-Soviet states, which are referred to as the &quot;near abroad&quot; in Russia. It has also been stated that the post-Soviet states are strategically vital to Russian interests. Some Russia experts have compared this concept to the Monroe Doctrine.

A series of so-called colour revolutions in the post-Soviet states, namely the Rose Revolution in Georgia in 2003, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004 and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan in 2005, led to frictions in the relations of those countries with Russia. In December 2004, Putin criticized the Rose and Orange revolutions, saying: &quot;If you have permanent revolutions you risk plunging the post-Soviet space into endless conflict&quot;.

Putin allegedly declared at a NATO-Russia summit in 2008 that if Ukraine joined NATO Russia could contend to annex the Ukrainian East and Crimea. At the summit, he told U.S. president George W. Bush that &quot;Ukraine is not even a state!&quot;, while the following year Putin referred to Ukraine as &quot;Little Russia&quot;. Following the Revolution of Dignity in March 2014, the Russian Federation annexed Crimea. According to Putin, this was done because &quot;Crimea has always been and remains an inseparable part of Russia&quot;.

After the Russian annexation of Crimea, he said that Ukraine includes &quot;regions of Russia&#x27;s historic south&quot; and &quot;was created on a whim by the Bolsheviks&quot;. He went on to declare that the February 2014 ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych had been orchestrated by the West as an attempt to weaken Russia. &quot;Our Western partners have crossed a line. They behaved rudely, irresponsibly and unprofessionally&quot;, he said, adding that the people who had come to power in Ukraine were &quot;nationalists, neo-Nazis, Russophobes and anti-Semites&quot;.
In a July 2014 speech during a Russian-supported armed insurgency in Eastern Ukraine, Putin stated he would use Russia&#x27;s &quot;entire arsenal of available means&quot; up to &quot;operations under international humanitarian law and the right of self-defence&quot; to protect Russian speakers outside Russia. With the attainment of autocephaly by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in December 2018 and subsequent schism of the Russian Orthodox Church from Constantinople, a number of experts came to the conclusion that Putin&#x27;s policy of forceful engagement in post-Soviet republics significantly backfired on him, leading to a situation where he &quot;annexed Crimea, but lost Ukraine&quot;, and provoked a much more cautious approach to Russia among other post-Soviet countries.

In late August 2014, Putin stated: &quot;People who have their own views on history and the history of our country may argue with me, but it seems to me that the Russian and Ukrainian peoples are practically one people&quot;. After making a similar statement, in late December 2015 he stated: &quot;the Ukrainian culture, as well as Ukrainian literature, surely has a source of its own&quot;. In July 2021, he published a lengthy article &quot;On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians&quot; revisiting these themes, and saying the formation of a Ukrainian state hostile to Moscow was &quot;comparable in its consequences to the use of weapons of mass destruction against us&quot;—it was made mandatory reading for military-political training in the Russian Armed Forces.

In August 2008, Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili attempted to restore control over the breakaway South Ossetia. However, the Georgian military was soon defeated in the resulting 2008 South Ossetia War after regular Russian forces entered South Ossetia and then other parts of Georgia, then also opened a second front in the other Georgian breakaway province of Abkhazia with Abkhazian forces.

Despite existing or past tensions between Russia and most of the post-Soviet states, Putin has followed the policy of Eurasian integration. Putin endorsed the idea of a Eurasian Union in 2011; the concept was proposed by the president of Kazakhstan in 1994. On 18 November 2011, the presidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia signed an agreement setting a target of establishing the Eurasian Union by 2015. The Eurasian Union was established on 1 January 2015.

Under Putin, Russia&#x27;s relations have improved significantly with Uzbekistan, the second largest post-Soviet republic after Ukraine. This was demonstrated in Putin&#x27;s visit to Tashkent in May 2000, after lukewarm relations under Yeltsin and Islam Karimov who had long distanced itself from Moscow. In another meeting in 2014, Russia agreed to write off Uzbek debt. A theme of a greater Soviet region, including the former USSR and many of its neighbors or imperial-era states—rather than just post-Soviet Russia—has been consistent in Putin&#x27;s May Day speeches.

On 22 December 2022, Putin addressed the Security Council in a speech where he did not use the term &quot;Special Military Operation&quot; but instead called the fighting in Ukraine a &quot;war&quot;. Anti-Putin activists have called for Putin to be prosecuted for breaking a law passed to stop people calling the Special Military Operation a war. This law carries a penalty of up to 15 years in jail. On 25 December, he openly declared in a TV interview that the goal of the invasion is &quot;to unite the Russian people&quot;.

On 14 December 2023, President Putin held a press conference where he indicated that Russian would only negotiate with Ukraine &quot;when we achieve our objectives&quot;. He stated that another mobilization wasn&#x27;t required as &quot;617,000&quot; Russian soldiers were fighting in Ukraine.

During the 2024 Year-End Review, President Putin was asked if there were regrets from the “Special Military Operation”. President Putin said that he regretted not launching it at the same time as the annexation of Crimea and with more &quot;preparation&quot;. Saying &quot;This decision, which was made at the beginning of 2022, should have been made earlier. That&#x27;s the first thing. Secondly, we should have started preparing, including for the SMO. The events in Crimea were spontaneous. The events of 2022 also began without preparation. But why did we start? Because it was impossible to stand still and endure any longer&quot;.

=== United States, Western Europe, and NATO ===


Under Putin, Russia&#x27;s relationships with NATO and the U.S. have passed through several stages. When he first became president, relations were cautious, but after the 9/11 attacks Putin quickly supported the U.S. in the War on Terror and the opportunity for partnership appeared. According to Stephen F. Cohen, the U.S. &quot;repaid by further expansion of NATO to Russia&#x27;s borders and by unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty&quot;, but others pointed out the applications from new countries willing to join NATO was driven primarily by Russian&#x27;s behavior in Chechnya, Transnistria, Abkhazia, Yanayev putsch as well as calls to restore USSR in its previous borders by prominent Russian politicians.

From 2003, when Russia strongly opposed the U.S. when it waged the Iraq War, Putin became ever more distant from the West, and relations steadily deteriorated. According to Russia scholar Stephen F. Cohen, the narrative of the mainstream U.S. media, following that of the White House, became anti-Putin. In an interview with Michael Stürmer, Putin said there were three questions which most concerned Russia and Eastern Europe: namely, the status of Kosovo, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and American plans to build missile defence sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, and suggested that all three were linked. His view was that concessions by the West on one of the questions might be met with concessions from Russia on another.
In a January 2007 interview, Putin said Russia was in favor of a democratic multipolar world and strengthening the systems of international law. In February 2007, Putin criticized what he called the United States&#x27; monopolistic dominance in global relations, and &quot;almost uncontained hyper use of force in international relations&quot;. He said the result of it is that &quot;no one feels safe! Because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them. Of course such a policy stimulates an arms race.&quot; This came to be known as the Munich Speech, and NATO secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer called the speech &quot;disappointing and not helpful&quot;.
The months following Putin&#x27;s Munich Speech were marked by tension and a surge in rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic. Both Russian and American officials, however, denied the idea of a new Cold War. Putin publicly opposed plans for the U.S. missile shield in Europe and presented President George W. Bush with a counterproposal on 7 June 2007 which was declined. Russia suspended its participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty on 11 December 2007.

Putin opposed Kosovo&#x27;s unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008, warning that it would destabilize the whole system of international relations. He described the recognition of Kosovo&#x27;s independence by several major world powers as &quot;a terrible precedent, which will de facto blow apart the whole system of international relations, developed not over decades, but over centuries&quot;, and that &quot;they have not thought through the results of what they are doing. At the end of the day it is a two-ended stick and the second end will come back and hit them in the face&quot;. In March 2014, Putin used Kosovo&#x27;s declaration of independence as a justification for recognizing the independence of Crimea, citing the so-called &quot;Kosovo independence precedent&quot;.

After the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. in 2001, Putin had good relations with American president George W. Bush, and many western European leaders. His &quot;cooler&quot; and &quot;more business-like&quot; relationship with German chancellor, Angela Merkel is often attributed to Merkel&#x27;s upbringing in the former DDR, where Putin was stationed as a KGB agent. He had a very friendly and warm relationship with Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi; the two leaders often described their relationship as a close friendship, continuing to organize bilateral meetings even after Berlusconi&#x27;s resignation in November 2011. When Berlusconi died in 2023, Putin described him as an &quot;extraordinary man&quot; and a &quot;true friend&quot;.
The NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011 prompted a widespread wave of criticism from several world leaders, including Putin, who said that the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 is &quot;defective and flawed&quot;, adding: &quot;It allows everything. It resembles medieval calls for crusades&quot;.

In late 2013, Russian-American relations deteriorated further when the United States canceled a summit for the first time since 1960 after Putin gave asylum to American Edward Snowden, who had leaked massive amounts of classified information from the NSA. In 2014, Russia was suspended from the G8 group as a result of its annexation of Crimea. Putin gave a speech highly critical of the United States, accusing them of destabilizing world order and trying to &quot;reshape the world&quot; to its own benefit. In June 2015, Putin said that Russia has no intention of attacking NATO.
On 9 November 2016, Putin congratulated Donald Trump on becoming the 45th president of the United States. In December 2016, US intelligence officials (headed by James Clapper) quoted by CBS News stated that Putin approved the email hacking and cyber attacks during the U.S. election, against the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. A spokesman for Putin denied the reports. Putin has repeatedly accused Hillary Clinton, who served as U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 of interfering in Russia&#x27;s internal affairs, and in December 2016, Clinton accused Putin of having a personal grudge against her.

With the election of Trump, Putin&#x27;s favorability in the U.S. increased. A Gallup poll in February 2017 revealed a positive view of Putin among 22% of Americans, the highest since 2003. Putin has stated that U.S.–Russian relations, already at the lowest level since the end of the Cold War, have continued to deteriorate after Trump took office in January 2017.

On 18 June 2020, &quot;The National Interest&quot; published a nine-thousand-word essay by Putin, titled &quot;The Real Lessons of the 75th Anniversary of World War II&quot;. In the essay, Putin criticizes the Western historical view of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact as the start of World War II, stating that the Munich Agreement was the beginning.

On 21 February 2023, Putin suspended Russia&#x27;s participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States. On 25 March, President Putin announced the stationing of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Russia would maintain control of the weapons. President Putin told Russian TV: &quot;There is nothing unusual here either. Firstly, the United States has been doing this for decades. They have long deployed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allied countries&quot;.

=== United Kingdom ===

In 2003, relations between Russia and the United Kingdom deteriorated when the United Kingdom granted political asylum to Putin&#x27;s former patron, oligarch Boris Berezovsky. This deterioration was intensified by allegations that the British were spying and making secret payments to pro-democracy and human rights groups. A survey conducted in the United Kingdom in 2022 found Putin to be among the least popular foreign leaders, with 8% of British respondents holding a positive opinion.

==== Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko ====
The end of 2006 brought more strained relations in the wake of the death by polonium poisoning in London of former KGB and FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, who became an MI6 agent in 2003. In 2007, the crisis in relations continued with the expulsion of four Russian envoys over Russia&#x27;s refusal to extradite former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoi to face charges in the murder. Mirroring the British actions, Russia expelled UK diplomats and took other retaliatory steps.

In 2015, the British Government launched a public inquiry into Litvinenko&#x27;s death, presided over by Robert Owen, a former British High Court judge. The Owen report, published on 21 January 2016, stated, &quot;The FSB operation to kill Mr. Litvinenko was probably approved by Mr Patrushev and also by President Putin&quot;. The report outlined some possible motives for the murder, including Litvinenko&#x27;s public statements and books about the alleged involvement of the FSB in mass murder, and what was &quot;undoubtedly a personal dimension to the antagonism&quot; between Putin and Litvinenko.

==== Poisoning of Sergei Skripal ====
On 4 March 2018, former double agent Sergei Skripal was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent in Salisbury. Ten days later, the British government formally accused the Russian state of attempted murder, a charge which Russia denied. After the UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats (an action which would later be responded to with a Russian expulsion of 23 British diplomats), British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on 16 March that it was &quot;overwhelmingly likely&quot; Putin had personally ordered the poisoning of Skripal. Putin&#x27;s spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the allegation &quot;shocking and unpardonable diplomatic misconduct&quot;.

=== Latin America ===

Putin and his successor, Medvedev, enjoyed warm relations with Hugo Chávez of Venezuela. Much of this has been through the sale of military equipment; since 2005, Venezuela has purchased more than $4 billion worth of arms from Russia. In September 2008, Russia sent Tupolev Tu-160 bombers to Venezuela to carry out training flights. In November 2008, both countries held a joint naval exercise in the Caribbean. Earlier in 2000, Putin had re-established stronger ties with Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba.

&quot;You express the best masculine qualities&quot;, Putin told Jair Bolsonaro in 2020. &quot;You look for solutions in all matters, always putting above all the interests of your people, your country, leaving out your own personal issues&quot;. Political scientist Oliver Stuenkel noted, &quot;Among Brazil&#x27;s right-wing populists, Putin is seen as someone who is anti-woke, and that is seen as something that is definitely appealing to Bolsonaro. He is a strongman, and that is very inspiring to Bolsonaro. He would like to be someone who concentrates as much power&quot;.

=== Australia and the South Pacific ===
In September 2007, Putin visited Indonesia, the first Russian leader to do so in over 50 years. In the same month, Putin also attended the APEC meeting held in Sydney, Australia, where he met with Prime Minister John Howard and signed a uranium trade deal for Australia to sell uranium to Russia. This was the first visit by a Russian president to Australia. Putin again visited Australia for 2014 G20 Brisbane summit. The Abbott government denounced Putin&#x27;s use of military force in Ukraine in 2014 as &quot;bullying&quot; and &quot;utterly unacceptable&quot;.

Amid calls to ban Putin from attending the 2014 G20 Summit, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he would &quot;shirtfront&quot; (challenge) the Russian leader over the shooting down of MH17 by Russian-backed rebels, which had killed 38 Australians. Putin denied responsibility for the killings.

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said the invasion was &quot;unprovoked, unjust and illegal&quot; and labeled Putin a &quot;thug&quot;. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern denounced Putin as a &quot;bully&quot;. Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama tweeted, &quot;Fiji and our fellow Pacific Island Countries have united as nations of peace-loving people to condemn the conflict in Ukraine&quot;, while the Solomon Islands UN ambassador called the invasion a &quot;violation of the rule of law&quot;.

=== Middle East and Africa ===

On 16 October 2007, Putin visited Iran to participate in the Second Caspian Summit in Tehran, where he met with Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. This was the first visit of a Soviet or Russian leader to Iran since Joseph Stalin&#x27;s participation in the Tehran Conference in 1943, and marked a significant event in Iran–Russia relations. At a press conference after the summit Putin said that &quot;all our (Caspian) states have the right to develop their peaceful nuclear programmes without any restrictions&quot;. Putin was quoted as describing Iran as a &quot;partner&quot;, although he expressed concerns over the Iranian nuclear programme.

In April 2008, Putin became the first Russian president to visit Libya. Putin condemned the 2011 foreign military intervention in Libya, referring to the UN resolution as &quot;defective and flawed&quot;, and added, &quot;It allows everything. It resembles medieval calls for crusades&quot;. Upon the death of Muammar Gaddafi, Putin called it as &quot;planned murder&quot; by the US, saying: &quot;They showed to the whole world how he (Gaddafi) was killed&quot;, and &quot;There was blood all over. Is that what they call a democracy?&quot;
From 2000 to 2010, Russia sold around $1.5 billion worth of arms to Syria, making Damascus Russia&#x27;s seventh-largest client. During the Syrian civil war, Russia threatened to veto any sanctions against the Syrian government, and continued to supply arms to its regime.

Putin opposed any foreign intervention in the Syrian civil war. In June 2012, in Paris, he rejected the statement of French president François Hollande who called on Bashar al-Assad to step down. Putin echoed Assad&#x27;s argument that anti-regime &quot;militants&quot; were responsible for much of the bloodshed. He also talked about previous NATO interventions and their results, and asked, &quot;What is happening in Libya, in Iraq? Did they become safer? Where are they heading? Nobody has an answer&quot;.
On 11 September 2013, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an op-ed by Putin urging caution against US intervention in Syria and criticizing American exceptionalism. Putin subsequently helped to arrange for the destruction of Syria&#x27;s chemical weapons. In 2015, he took a stronger pro-Assad stance and mobilized military support for the regime. Some analysts have summarized Putin as being allied with Shiites and Alawites in the Middle East.

In 2017, Putin dispatched Russian PMCs to back the Touadéra regime in the Central African Republic Civil War, gaining a permanent military presence in return. The first Russia-Africa Summit was held in October 2019 in Sochi, Russia, co-hosted by Putin and Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The meeting was attended by 43 heads of state and government from African countries.

In October 2019, Putin visited the United Arab Emirates, where six agreements were struck with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed. One of them included shared investments between Russian sovereign wealth fund and the Emirati investment fund Mubadala. The two nations signed deals worth over $1.3bn, in energy, health and advance technology sectors. On 22 October 2021, Putin highlighted the &quot;unique bond&quot; between Russia and Israel during a meeting with Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett.

=== Polls and rankings ===
The director of the Levada Center stated in 2015 that drawing conclusions from Russian poll results or comparing them to polls in democratic states was irrelevant, as there is no real political competition in Russia, where, unlike in democratic states, Russian voters are not offered any credible alternatives and public opinion is primarily formed by state-controlled media, which promotes those in power and discredits alternative candidates.

In a June 2007 public opinion survey, Putin&#x27;s approval rating was 81%, the second-highest of any leader in the world that year. In January 2013, at the time of the 2011–2013 Russian protests, Putin&#x27;s rating fell to 62%, the lowest since 2000. After EU and U.S. sanctions against Russian officials as a result of the crisis in Ukraine, Putin&#x27;s approval rating reached 87% in August 2014. In February 2015, based on domestic polling, Putin was ranked the world&#x27;s most popular politician. In June 2015, Putin&#x27;s approval rating climbed to 89%, an all-time high. Observers saw Putin&#x27;s high approval ratings in 2010s as a consequence of improvements in living standards, and Russia&#x27;s reassertion on the world scene during his presidency. Putin was also highly popular in some non-Western countries, such as Vietnam, where his approval rating was 89% in 2017.

Despite high approval for Putin, public confidence in the Russian economy was low, dropping to levels in 2016 that rivaled the lows in 2009 at the height of the global economic crisis. Putin&#x27;s performance in reining in corruption is unpopular among Russians. &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported in 2017 that a poll &quot;indicated that 67% held Putin personally responsible for high-level corruption&quot;. Corruption is a significant problem in Russia.

In October 2018, two-thirds of Russians surveyed agreed that &quot;Putin bears full responsibility for the problems of the country&quot;, which has been attributed to a decline in a popular belief in &quot;good tsar and bad boyars&quot;, a traditional attitude towards justifying failures at the top of the ruling hierarchy in Russia. In January 2019, the percentage of Russians trusting Putin hit a then-historic low—33%. In April 2019 Gallup poll showed a record number of Russians, 20%, willing to permanently emigrate from Russia. The decline was even larger in the 17–25 age group, &quot;who find themselves largely disconnected from the country&#x27;s aging leadership, nostalgic Soviet rhetoric and nepotistic agenda&quot;. Putin&#x27;s approval rating among young Russians was 32% in January 2019. The percentage willing to emigrate permanently in this group was 41%. 60% had favorable views of the US (three times more than in the 55+ age group). Decline in support for the president and government is visible in other polls, such as a rapidly growing readiness to protest against poor living conditions.

In May 2020, amid the COVID crisis, Putin&#x27;s approval rating was 68%, when respondents were presented a list of names (closed question), and 27% when respondents were expected to name politicians they trust (open question). This has been attributed to continued post-Crimea economic stagnation but also an apathetic response to the pandemic crisis in Russia. Polls conducted in November 2021 after the failure of a Russian COVID-19 vaccination campaign indicated distrust of Putin was a major contributing factor for vaccine hesitancy, with regional polls indicating numbers as low as 20–30% in the Volga Federal District.

In May 2021, 33% indicated Putin in response to &quot;who would you vote for this weekend?&quot; among Moscow respondents and 40% outside Moscow. A survey released in October 2021 found 53% of respondents saying they trusted Putin.

Observers see a generational struggle among Russians over perception of Putin&#x27;s rule, with younger Russians more probably to be against Putin and older Russians more likely to accept the narrative presented by state-controlled media in Russia. Putin&#x27;s support among Russians aged 18–24 was only 20% in December 2020.
Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, state-controlled TV, where most Russians get their news, presented the invasion as a &quot;special military operation&quot; and liberation mission, in line with the government&#x27;s narrative. The Russian censorship apparatus &quot;Roskomnadzor&quot; ordered the country&#x27;s media to employ information only from state sources or face fines and blocks. The Russian media was banned from using the words &quot;war&quot;, &quot;invasion&quot; or &quot;aggression&quot; to describe the invasion, with media outlets being blocked as a result.

In late February 2022, a survey conducted by the independent research group Russian Field found that 59% of respondents supported the &quot;special military operation&quot; in Ukraine. According to the poll, in the group of 18-to-24-year-olds, only 29% supported the &quot;special military operation&quot;. In late February and mid-March 2022 two polls surveyed Russians&#x27; sentiments about the &quot;special military operation&quot; in Ukraine. The results were obtained by Radio Liberty. 71% of Russians polled said that they supported the &quot;special military operation&quot; in Ukraine.

When asked how they were affected by the actions of Putin, a third said they strongly believed Putin was working in their interests. Another 26% said he was working in their interests to some extent. In general, most Russians believe that it would be better if Putin remained president for as long as possible. Similarly, a survey conducted in early March found 58% of Russian respondents approved of the operation.

In March 2022, 97% of Ukrainians said they had an unfavorable view of Putin, and 98% of Ukrainians—including 82% of ethnic Russians living in Ukraine—said they did not believe any part of Ukraine was rightfully part of Russia. A poll published on 30 March in Russia saw Putin&#x27;s approval rating jump, from 71% in February, to 83%. However, experts warned that the figures may not accurately reflect the public mood, as the public tends to rally around leaders during war and some may be hiding their true opinions, especially with the Russian 2022 war censorship laws prohibiting dissemination of &quot;fake information&quot; about the military. Many respondents do not want to answer pollsters&#x27; questions for fear of negative consequences. When researchers commissioned a survey on Russians&#x27; attitudes to the war, 29,400 out of 31,000 refused to answer. The Levada Center&#x27;s director, stated that early feelings of &quot;shock and confusion&quot; was being replaced with the belief that Russia was being besieged and that Russians must rally around their leader. The Kremlin&#x27;s analysis concluded that public support for the war was broad but not deep, and that most Russians would accept anything Putin labeled a victory. In September 2023, the head of the VTsIOM state pollster Valery Fyodorov said in an interview that only 10–15% of Russians actively supported the war, and that &quot;most Russians are not demanding the conquest of Kyiv or Odesa&quot;.

A poll by the independent organization Levada, which was conducted on 22–28 June 2023, showed that 42% of respondents would vote for Putin in the 2024 presidential election. A public opinion poll by the state-owned institution VCIOM, which was conducted in November 2023, found that 37.3% of respondents would vote for Putin. According to a VCIOM poll conducted in early March 2024, 56.2% of respondents would vote for Putin.

=== Cult of personality ===

Putin has cultivated a cult of personality for himself with an outdoorsy, sporty, tough guy public image, demonstrating his physical prowess and taking part in unusual or dangerous acts, such as extreme sports and interaction with wild animals, part of a public relations approach that, according to &quot;Wired&quot;, &quot;deliberately cultivates the macho, take-charge superhero image&quot;. In 2007, the tabloid &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; published a huge photograph of a shirtless Putin vacationing in the Siberian mountains under the headline &quot;Be Like Putin&quot;.

Numerous Kremlinologists have accused Putin of seeking to create a cult of personality around himself, an accusation that the Kremlin has denied. Some of Putin&#x27;s activities have been criticised for being staged; outside of Russia, his macho image has been the subject of parody. Putin&#x27;s height has been estimated by Kremlin insiders to be between tall but is usually given at .

There are many songs about Putin, and Putin&#x27;s name and image are widely used in advertisement and product branding. Among the Putin-branded products are Putinka vodka, the PuTin brand of canned food, the &quot;Gorbusha Putina&quot; caviar, and a collection of T-shirts with his image.

=== Public recognition in the West ===
In 2007, he was the &quot;Time&quot; Person of the Year. In 2015, he was No. 1 on the &quot;Time&#x27;s&quot; Most Influential People List. &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked him the World&#x27;s Most Powerful Individual every year from 2013 to 2016. He was ranked the second most powerful individual by &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2018.

In Germany, the word &quot;Putinversteher&quot; (female form &quot;Putinversteherin&quot;) is a neologism and a political buzzword (&quot;Putin&quot; + &quot;&quot;), which literally translates &quot;Putin understander&quot;, i.e., &quot;one who understands Putin&quot;. It is a pejorative reference to politicians and pundits who express empathy to Putin and may also be translated as &quot;Putin-empathizer&quot;.

=== Putinisms ===
Putin has produced many aphorisms and catch-phrases known as putinisms. Many of them were first made during his annual Q&amp;A conferences, where Putin answered questions from journalists and other people in the studio, as well as from Russians throughout the country, who either phoned in or spoke from studios and outdoor sites across Russia. Putin is known for his often tough and sharp language, often alluding to Russian jokes and folk sayings. Putin sometimes uses Russian criminal jargon (known as &quot;fenya&quot; in Russian), albeit not always correctly.

== Assessments ==
Assessments of Putin&#x27;s character as a leader have evolved during his long presidency. His shifting of Russia towards autocracy and weakening of the system of representative government advocated by Boris Yeltsin has met with criticism. Russian dissidents and western leaders now frequently characterise him as a &quot;dictator&quot;. Others have offered favourable assessments of his impact on Russia.

Otto von Habsburg, the last crown prince of Austria-Hungary and former Member of the European Parliament, was an early critic of Putin. In a newspaper interview in 2002 and in two speeches in 2003 and 2005, he warned of Putin as an &quot;international threat&quot;, that he was &quot;cruel and oppressive&quot;, and a &quot;stone cold technocrat&quot;.

Putin was described in 2015 as a &quot;dictator&quot; by political opponent Garry Kasparov, and as the &quot;Tsar of corruption&quot; in 2016 by opposition activist and blogger Alexei Navalny. He was described as a &quot;bully&quot; and &quot;arrogant&quot; by former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton, and as &quot;self-centered&quot; by the Dalai Lama. In 2015, opposition politician Boris Nemtsov said that Putin was turning Russia into a &quot;raw materials colony&quot; of China.

Former U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger wrote in 2014 that the West has demonized Putin. Egon Krenz, former leader of East Germany, said the Cold War never ended, adding: &quot;After weak presidents like Gorbachev and Yeltsin, it is a great fortune for Russia that it has Putin&quot;.

Many Russians credit Putin for reviving Russia&#x27;s fortunes. Former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev, while acknowledging the flawed democratic procedures and restrictions on media freedom during the Putin presidency, said that Putin had pulled Russia out of chaos at the end of the Yeltsin years, and that Russians &quot;must remember that Putin saved Russia from the beginning of a collapse&quot;. Chechen Republic head and Putin supporter, Ramzan Kadyrov, stated prior to 2011 that Putin saved both the Chechen people and Russia.

Russia has suffered democratic backsliding during Putin&#x27;s tenure. Freedom House has listed Russia as being &quot;not free&quot; since 2005. Experts do not generally consider Russia to be a democracy, citing purges and jailing of political opponents, curtailed press freedom, and the lack of free and fair elections. In 2004, Freedom House warned that Russia&#x27;s &quot;retreat from freedom marks a low point not registered since 1989, when the country was part of the Soviet Union&quot;.

The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Russia as &quot;authoritarian&quot; since 2011, whereas it had previously been considered a &quot;hybrid regime&quot; (with &quot;some form of democratic government&quot; in place). According to political scientist Larry Diamond, writing in 2015, &quot;no serious scholar would consider Russia today a democracy&quot;.

Following the jailing of the anti-corruption blogger and activist Alexei Navalny in 2018, &quot;Forbes&quot; wrote: &quot;Putin&#x27;s actions are those of a dictator... As a leader with failing public support, he can only remain in power by using force and repression that gets worse by the day&quot;. In November 2021, &quot;The Economist&quot; also noted that Putin had &quot;shifted from autocracy to dictatorship&quot;.

In February 2015, former U.S. ambassador to Germany John Kornblum wrote in &quot;the Wall Street Journal&quot; that:
=== After the 2022 invasion of Ukraine ===
Following mounting civilian casualties during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, U.S. president Joe Biden called Putin a war criminal and &quot;murderous dictator&quot;. In the 2022 State of the Union Address, Biden said that Putin had &quot;badly miscalculated&quot;. The Ukrainian envoy to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya likened Putin to Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany. Latvian prime minister Krisjanis Karins also likened the Russian leader to Hitler, saying he was &quot;a deluded autocrat creating misery for millions&quot; and that &quot;Putin is fighting against democracy (...) If he can attack Ukraine, theoretically it could be any other European country&quot;.

Lithuania&#x27;s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said, &quot;The battle for Ukraine is a battle for Europe. If Putin is not stopped there, he will go further&quot;. President Emmanuel Macron of France said Putin was &quot;deluding himself&quot;. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian denounced him as &quot;a cynic and a dictator&quot;. UK prime minister Boris Johnson also labelled Putin a &quot;dictator&quot; who had authorised &quot;a tidal wave of violence against a fellow Slavic people&quot;. Some authors, such as Michael Hirsh, described Putin as a &quot;messianic&quot; Russian nationalist and Eurasianist.

== Electoral history ==

Vladimir Putin has been nominated and elected as President of Russia all five times since 2000, typically under an independent banner. In the most recent 2024 Russian presidential election, Putin achieved 88% of the popular vote. There were reports of irregularities at this election, including ballot stuffing and coercion. Russian authorities claimed that in occupied areas of Ukraine&#x27;s Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, Putin won 88.12% and 92.83% of votes. In Chechnya, Putin won 98.99% of the vote.

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===

On 28 July 1983, Putin married Lyudmila Shkrebneva, and they lived together in East Germany from 1985 to 1990. They have two daughters, Mariya Putina, born on 28 April 1985 in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), and Yekaterina Putina, born on 31 August 1986 in Dresden, East Germany (now Germany).

An investigation by &quot;Proekt&quot; published in November 2020 alleged that Putin has another daughter, Elizaveta, also known as Luiza Rozova, (born in March 2003), with Svetlana Krivonogikh. In April 2008, the &quot;Moskovsky Korrespondent&quot; reported that Putin had divorced Lyudmila and was engaged to marry Olympic gold medalist Alina Kabaeva, a former rhythmic gymnast and Russian politician. The story was denied, and the newspaper was shut down shortly thereafter. Putin and Lyudmila continued to make public appearances together as spouses, while the status of his relationship with Kabaeva became a topic of speculation.

On 6 June 2013, Putin and Lyudmila announced that their marriage was over; on 1 April 2014, the Kremlin confirmed that the divorce had been finalised. Kabaeva reportedly gave birth to a daughter by Putin in 2015; this report was denied. Kabaeva reportedly gave birth to twin sons by Putin in 2019. However, in 2022, Swiss media, citing the couple&#x27;s Swiss gynecologist, wrote that on both occasions Kabaeva gave birth to a boy.

Putin has two grandsons, born in 2012 and 2017, through Maria. He reportedly also has a granddaughter, born in 2017, through Katerina. His cousin, Igor Putin, was a director at Moscow-based Master Bank and was accused in a number of money-laundering scandals.

=== Wealth ===

Official figures released during the legislative election of 2007 put Putin&#x27;s wealth at approximately 3.7 million rubles (US$280,000) in bank accounts, a private apartment in Saint Petersburg, and miscellaneous other assets. Putin&#x27;s reported 2006 income totaled 2 million rubles (approximately $152,000). In 2012, Putin reported an income of 3.6 million rubles ($270,000). Putin has been photographed wearing a number of expensive wristwatches, collectively valued at $700,000, nearly six times his annual salary. Putin has been known on occasion to give watches valued at thousands of dollars as gifts, for example a watch identified as a Blancpain to a Siberian boy he met while on vacation in 2009, and another similar watch to a factory worker the same year.
According to Russian opposition politicians and journalists, Putin secretly possesses a multi-billion-dollar fortune via successive ownership of stakes in a number of Russian companies. According to one editorial in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Putin might not technically own these 43 aircraft, but, as the sole political power in Russia, he can act like they&#x27;re his&quot;. An RIA Novosti journalist argued that &quot;[Western] intelligence agencies ... could not find anything&quot;. These contradictory claims were analyzed by Polygraph.info, which looked at a number of reports by Western (Anders Åslund estimate of $100–160 billion) and Russian (Stanislav Belkovsky estimated of $40 billion) analysts, CIA (estimate of $40 billion in 2007) as well as counterarguments of Russian media. Polygraph concluded:
In April 2016, 11 million documents belonging to Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca were leaked to the German newspaper &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; and the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The name of Putin does not appear in any of the records, and Putin denied his involvement with the company. However, various media have reported on three of Putin&#x27;s associates on the list. According to the Panama Papers leak, close trusted associates of Putin own offshore companies worth US$2 billion in total. The German newspaper &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; regards the possibility of Putin&#x27;s family profiting from this money as plausible.

According to the paper, the US$2 billion had been &quot;secretly shuffled through banks and shadow companies linked to Putin&#x27;s associates&quot;, such as construction billionaires Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, and Bank Rossiya, previously identified by the U.S. State Department as being treated by Putin as his personal bank account, had been central in facilitating this. It concludes that &quot;Putin has shown he is willing to take aggressive steps to maintain secrecy and protect [such] communal assets&quot;.

A significant proportion of the money trail leads to Putin&#x27;s best friend Sergei Roldugin. Although a musician, and in his own words, not a businessman, it appears he has accumulated assets valued at $100m, and possibly more. It has been suggested he was picked for the role because of his low profile. There have been speculations that Putin, in fact, owns the funds, and Roldugin just acted as a proxy. Garry Kasparov said that &quot;[Putin] controls enough money, probably more than any other individual in the history of human race&quot;.

=== Residences ===
==== Official government residences ====

As president and prime minister, Putin has lived in numerous official residences throughout the country. These residences include: the Moscow Kremlin, Novo-Ogaryovo in Moscow Oblast, Gorki-9 near Moscow, Bocharov Ruchey in Sochi, Dolgiye Borody (residence) in Novgorod Oblast, and Riviera in Sochi. In August 2012, critics of Putin listed the ownership of 20 villas and palaces, nine of which were built during Putin&#x27;s 12 years in power.

==== Personal residences ====
Soon after Putin returned from his KGB service in Dresden, East Germany, he built a dacha in Solovyovka on the eastern shore of Lake Komsomolskoye on the Karelian Isthmus in Priozersky District of Leningrad Oblast, near St. Petersburg. After the dacha burned down in 1996, Putin built a new one identical to the original and was joined by a group of seven friends who built dachas nearby. In 1996, the group formally registered their fraternity as a co-operative society, calling it Ozero (&quot;Lake&quot;) and turning it into a gated community.

A massive Italianate-style mansion costing an alleged US$1 billion and dubbed &quot;Putin&#x27;s Palace&quot; is under construction near the Black Sea village of Praskoveevka. In 2012, Sergei Kolesnikov, a former business associate of Putin&#x27;s, told the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme that he had been ordered by Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin to oversee the building of the palace. He also said that the mansion, built on government land and sporting three helipads, plus a private road paid for from state funds and guarded by officials wearing uniforms of the official Kremlin guard service, have been built for Putin&#x27;s private use.

On 19 January 2021, two days after Alexei Navalny was detained by Russian authorities upon his return to Russia, a video investigation by him and the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) was published accusing Putin of using fraudulently obtained funds to build the estate for himself in what he called &quot;the world&#x27;s biggest bribe&quot;. In the investigation, Navalny said that the estate is 39 times the size of Monaco and cost over 100 billion rubles ($1.35 billion) to construct. It also showed aerial footage of the estate via a drone and a detailed floorplan of the palace that Navalny said was given by a contractor, which he compared to photographs from inside the palace that were leaked onto the Internet in 2011. He also detailed an elaborate corruption scheme allegedly involving Putin&#x27;s inner circle that allowed Putin to hide billions of dollars to build the estate. Since the prelude to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin prefers to travel in an armored train to flying.
=== Pets ===
Putin has received five dogs from various national leaders: Konni, Buffy, Yume, Verni and Pasha. Konni died in 2014. When Putin first became president, the family had two poodles, Tosya and Rodeo. They reportedly stayed with his ex-wife Lyudmila after their divorce.

=== Religion ===
Putin is Russian Orthodox. His mother was a devoted Christian believer who attended the Russian Orthodox Church, while his father was an atheist. Although his mother kept no icons at home, she attended church regularly, despite government persecution of her religion at that time. His mother secretly baptized him as a baby, and she regularly took him to services.

According to Putin, his religious awakening began after a serious car crash involving his wife in 1993, and a life-threatening fire that burned down their dacha in August 1996. Shortly before an official visit to Israel, Putin&#x27;s mother gave him his baptismal cross, telling him to get it blessed. Putin states, &quot;I did as she said and then put the cross around my neck. I have never taken it off since&quot;.

When asked in 2007 whether he believes in God, he responded: &quot;There are things I believe, which should not in my position, at least, be shared with the public at large for everybody&#x27;s consumption because that would look like self-advertising or a political striptease&quot;. Putin&#x27;s rumoured confessor is Russian Orthodox bishop Tikhon Shevkunov. The sincerity of his Christianity has been rejected by his former advisor Sergei Pugachev.

=== Sports ===
Putin watches football and supports FC Zenit Saint Petersburg. He also displays an interest in ice hockey and bandy, and played in a star-studded hockey game on his 63rd birthday.
Putin has been practicing judo since he was 11, before switching to sambo at the age of fourteen. He won competitions in both sports in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). He was awarded eighth dan of the black belt in 2012, becoming the first Russian to achieve the status. He was rewarded an eighth-degree karate black belt in 2014.

He co-authored a book entitled &quot;Learn Judo with Vladimir Putin&quot; in Russian (2000), and &quot;Judo: History, Theory, Practice&quot; in English (2004). Benjamin Wittes, a black belt in taekwondo and aikido and editor of &quot;Lawfare&quot;, has disputed Putin&#x27;s martial arts skills, stating that there is no video evidence of Putin displaying any real noteworthy judo skills. In a Putin visit to Japan, a little, Japanese girl judo opponent with a green belt in judo tossed Vladimir to the floor using a judo throw.

In March 2022, Putin was removed from all positions in the International Judo Federation (IJF) due to the Russian war in Ukraine.

=== Health ===

In July 2022, the director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, William Burns, stated they had no evidence to suggest Putin was unstable or in bad health. The statement was made because of increasing unconfirmed media speculation about Putin&#x27;s health. Burns had previously been U.S. ambassador to Russia, and had personally observed Putin for over two decades, including a personal meeting in November 2021. A Kremlin spokesperson also dismissed rumours of Putin&#x27;s bad health.

The Russian political magazine &quot;Sobesednik&quot; () alleged in 2018 that Putin had a sensory room installed in his private residence in the Novgorod Oblast. The White House, as well as Western generals, politicians, and political analysts, have questioned Putin&#x27;s mental health after two years of isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In April 2022, tabloid newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; reported that based on video footage Putin may have Parkinson&#x27;s disease. This speculation, which has not been supported by medical professionals, has spread in part due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, which many saw as an irrational act. The Kremlin rejected the possibility of Parkinson&#x27;s along with outside medical professionals, who stress that it is impossible to diagnose the condition based on video clips alone.

== Awards and honours ==

At least fifteen countries have awarded Vladimir Putin civilian honors since 2001. Putin has been awarded honorary doctorates and other awards from organizations across the world, but some of these were revoked in 2022 in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<doc id="32819" wikidata="Q19408" url="?curid=32819" title="Velar consonant">
<text>Velars are consonants articulated with the back part of the tongue (the dorsum) against the soft palate, the back part of the roof of the mouth (also known as the &quot;velum&quot;).

Since the velar region of the roof of the mouth is relatively extensive and the movements of the dorsum
are not very precise, velars easily undergo assimilation, shifting their articulation back or to the front
depending on the quality of adjacent vowels. They often become automatically &quot;fronted&quot;, that is partly or completely palatal before a following front vowel, and &quot;retracted&quot;, that is partly or completely uvular before back vowels.

Palatalised velars (like English in &quot;keen&quot; or &quot;cube&quot;) are sometimes referred to as palatovelars. Many languages also have labialized velars, such as , in which the articulation is accompanied by rounding of the lips. There are also labial–velar consonants, which are doubly articulated at the velum and at the lips, such as . This distinction disappears with the approximant consonant since labialization involves adding of a labial approximant articulation to a sound, and this ambiguous situation is often called labiovelar.

A velar trill or tap is not possible according to the International Phonetics Association: see the shaded boxes on the table of pulmonic consonants. In the velar position, the tongue has an extremely restricted ability to carry out the type of motion associated with trills or taps, and the body of the tongue has no freedom to move quickly enough to produce a velar trill or flap.

==Examples==
The velar consonants identified by the International Phonetic Alphabet are:

==Lack of velars==
The velar consonant is the most common consonant in human languages. The only languages recorded to lack velars (and any dorsal consonant at all) may be Xavante, standard Tahitian (though /tVt/ is pronounced [kVt], a pattern also found in the Niihau dialect of Hawaiian), and arguably several Skou languages (Wutung, the Dumo dialect of Vanimo, and Bobe), which have a coda that has been analyzed as the realization of nasal vowels. In Pirahã, men may lack the only velar consonant. 

Other languages lack simple velars. An areal feature of the indigenous languages of the Americas of the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest is that historical *k was palatalized. When such sounds remained stops, they were transcribed in Americanist phonetic notation, presumably corresponding to IPA , but in others, such as the Saanich dialect of Coastal Salish, Salish-Spokane-Kalispel, and Chemakum, *k went further and affricated to . Likewise, historical *k’ has become and historical *x has become ; there was no *g or *ŋ. In the Northwest Caucasian languages, historical * has also become palatalized, becoming in Ubykh and in most Circassian varieties. In both regions the languages retain a labialized velar series (e.g. in the Pacific Northwest) as well as uvular consonants. In the languages of those families that retain plain velars, both the plain and labialized velars are &quot;pre-velar&quot;, perhaps to make them more distinct from the uvulars which may be &quot;post-velar&quot;. Prevelar consonants are susceptible to palatalization. A similar system, contrasting with and leaving marginal at best, is reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European.

Apart from the voiceless plosive , no other velar consonant is particularly common, even the and that occur in English. There can be no phoneme in a language that lacks voiced stops, like Mandarin Chinese, but it is sporadically missing elsewhere. Of the languages surveyed in the &quot;World Atlas of Language Structures&quot;, about 10% of languages that otherwise have are missing .

Pirahã has both a and a phonetically. However, the does not behave as other consonants, and the argument has been made that it is phonemically , leaving Pirahã with only as an underlyingly velar consonant.

Hawaiian does not distinguish from ; tends toward at the beginning of utterances, before , and is variable elsewhere, especially in the dialect of Niihau and Kauai. Since Hawaiian has no , and varies between and , it is not clearly meaningful to say that Hawaiian has phonemic velar consonants.

Several Khoisan languages have limited numbers or distributions of pulmonic velar consonants. (Their click consonants are articulated in the uvular or possibly velar region, but that occlusion is part of the airstream mechanism rather than the place of articulation of the consonant.) Khoekhoe, for example, does not allow velars in medial or final position, but in Juǀʼhoan velars are rare even in initial position.

== consonants==
Normal velar consonants are &quot;dorso-velar&quot;: The dorsum (body) of the tongue rises to contact the velum (soft palate) of the roof of the mouth. In disordered speech there are also &quot;velo-dorsal&quot; stops, with the opposite articulation: The velum lowers to contact the tongue, which remains static. In the extensions to the IPA for disordered speech, these are transcribed by reversing the IPA letter for a velar consonant, e.g. for a voiceless velodorsal stop, for voiced, and for a nasal.

<doc id="32821" wikidata="Q153348" url="?curid=32821" title="V-1 flying bomb">
<text>The V-1 flying bomb ( &quot;Vengeance Weapon 1&quot;) was an early cruise missile. Its official Reich Aviation Ministry () designation was Fieseler Fi 103 and its suggestive name was &#x27; (hellhound). It was also known to the Allies as the buzz bomb or doodlebug and &#x27; (maybug).

The V-1 was the first of the (V-weapons) deployed for the terror bombing of London. It was developed at Peenemünde Army Research Center in 1939 by the at the beginning of the Second World War, and during initial development was known by the codename &quot;Cherry Stone&quot;. Due to its limited range, the thousands of V-1 missiles launched into England were fired from launch facilities along the French (Pas-de-Calais) and Dutch coasts or by modified He 111 aircraft.

The Wehrmacht first launched the V-1s against London on 13 June 1944, one week after (and prompted by) the successful Allied landings in France. At peak, more than one hundred V-1s a day were fired at southeast England, 9,521 in total, decreasing in number as sites were overrun until October 1944, when the last V-1 site in range of Britain was overrun by Allied forces. After this, the Germans directed V-1s at the port of Antwerp and at other targets in Belgium, launching a further 2,448 V-1s. The attacks stopped only a month before the war in Europe ended, when the last launch site in the Low Countries was overrun on 29 March 1945.

As part of operations against the V-1, the British operated an arrangement of air defences, including anti-aircraft guns, barrage balloons, and fighter aircraft, to intercept the bombs before they reached their targets, while the launch sites and underground storage depots became targets for Allied attacks including strategic bombing.

In 1944 a number of tests of this weapon were apparently conducted in Tornio, Finland. On one occasion, several Finnish soldiers saw a German plane launch what they described as a bomb shaped like a small, winged aircraft. The flight and impact of another prototype was seen by Finnish frontline soldiers; they noted that its engine stopped suddenly, causing the V-1 to descend sharply, and explode on impact, leaving a crater wide. These V-1s became known to Finnish soldiers as &quot;flying torpedoes&quot;.

==Design and development==
In 1935 Paul Schmidt and Professor Georg Hans Madelung submitted a design to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; for a flying bomb. It was an innovative design that used a pulse-jet engine, while previous work dating back to 1915 by Sperry Gyroscope relied on propellers. While employed by the company, Fritz Gosslau developed a remote-controlled target drone, the FZG 43 (&quot;Flakzielgerät-43&quot;). In October 1939 Argus proposed &quot;Fernfeuer&quot;, a remote-controlled aircraft carrying a payload of one ton, that could return to base after releasing its bomb. Argus worked in co-operation with C. Lorenz AG and Arado Flugzeugwerke to develop the project. However, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; declined to award them a development contract. In 1940, Schmidt and Argus began cooperating, integrating Schmidt&#x27;s shutter system with Argus&#x27; atomized fuel injection. Tests began in January 1941, and the first flight made on 30 April 1941 with a Gotha Go 145. On 27 February 1942 Gosslau and Robert Lusser sketched out the design of an aircraft with the pulse-jet above the tail, the basis for the future V-1.

Lusser produced a preliminary design in April 1942, P35 Erfurt, which used gyroscopes. When submitted to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; on 5 June 1942, the specifications included a range of , a speed of , and capable of delivering a warhead. Project Fieseler Fi 103 was approved on 19 June, and assigned code name &quot;Kirschkern&quot; and cover name &quot;Flakzielgerät&quot; 76 (FZG-76). Flight tests were conducted at the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;&#x27;s coastal test centre at Karlshagen, Peenemünde-West.

Erhard Milch, State Secretary in the Reich Ministry of Aviation and Inspector General of the Air force, awarded Argus the contract for the engine, Fieseler the airframe, and Askania the guidance system. By 30 August Fieseler had completed the first fuselage, and the first flight of the Fi 103 V7 took place on 10 December 1942, when it was airdropped by a Fw 200. Then on Christmas Eve, the V-1 flew , for about a minute, after a ground launch. On 26 May 1943 Germany decided to put both the V-1 and the V-2 into production. In July 1943 the V-1 flew and impacted within a kilometre (1,100 yards) of its target.

The V-1 was named by &quot;Das Reich&quot; journalist Hans Schwarz Van Berkl in June 1944 with Hitler&#x27;s approval.

==Description==

The V-1 was designed under the codename (cherry stone) by Lusser and Gosslau, with a fuselage constructed mainly of welded sheet steel and wings built of plywood. The simple, Argus-built pulsejet engine pulsed 50 times per second, and the characteristic buzzing sound gave rise to the colloquial names &quot;buzz bomb&quot; or &quot;doodlebug&quot; (a common name for a wide variety of flying insects). It was known briefly in Germany (on Hitler&#x27;s orders) as (May bug literally &quot;May&quot; + &quot;chafer&quot;) and (crow).

===Power plant===
The Argus pulsejet&#x27;s major components included the nacelle, fuel jets, flap valve grid, mixing chamber venturi, tail pipe, and spark plug. Compressed air rather than a fuel pump forced gasoline from the fuel tank through the fuel jets which consisted of three banks of three atomizers. These nine atomizing nozzles were in front of the air inlet valve system where it mixed with air before entering the chamber. A throttle valve, connected to altitude and ram pressure instruments, controlled fuel flow. Schmidt&#x27;s spring-controlled flap valve system provided an efficient straight path for incoming air. The flaps momentarily closed after each explosion, the resultant gas compressed in the venturi chamber, and its tapered portion accelerated the exhaust gases creating thrust. The operation proceeded at a rate of 42 cycles per second.

Beginning in January 1941, the V-1&#x27;s pulsejet engine was also tested on a variety of craft, including automobiles and an experimental attack boat known as the Tornado, in which a boat loaded with a warhead was steered towards a target ship either by remote control or by a pilot who would leap out of the back at the last moment. The Tornado was assembled from surplus seaplane hulls connected in catamaran fashion. Ultimately insufficient Argus 014 pulse-jets were available as all production was allocated to the V-1 missile program.

The engine made its first flight aboard a Gotha Go 145 on 30 April 1941.

===Guidance system===
The V-1 guidance system used a simple autopilot developed by Askania in Berlin to regulate altitude and airspeed. A pair of gyroscopes controlled yaw and pitch, while azimuth was maintained by a magnetic compass. Altitude was maintained by a barometric device. Two spherical tanks contained compressed air at , that drove the gyros, operated the pneumatic servomotors controlling the rudder and elevator, and pressurized the fuel system.

The magnetic compass was located near the front of the V-1, within a wooden sphere. Shortly before launch, the V-1 was suspended inside the Compass Swinging Building (Richthaus). There the compass was corrected for magnetic variance and magnetic deviation.

The RLM at first planned to use a radio control system with the V-1 for precision attacks, but the government decided instead to use the missile against London. Some flying bombs were equipped with a basic radio transmitter operating in the range of 340–450 kHz. Once over the channel, the radio would be switched on by the vane counter, and a aerial deployed. A coded Morse signal, unique to each V-1 site, transmitted the route, and impact zone calculated once the radio stopped transmitting.

An odometer driven by a vane anemometer on the nose determined when the target area had been reached, accurate enough for area bombing. Before launch, it was set to count backwards from a value that would reach zero upon arrival at the target in the prevailing wind conditions. As the missile flew, the airflow turned the propeller, and every 30 rotations of the propeller counted down one number on the odometer. This odometer triggered the arming of the warhead after about . When the count reached zero, two detonating bolts were fired. Two spoilers on the elevator were released, the linkage between the elevator and servo was jammed, and a guillotine device cut off the control hoses to the rudder servo, setting the rudder in neutral. These actions put the V-1 into a steep dive. While this was originally intended to be a power dive, in practice the dive caused the fuel flow to cease, which stopped the engine. The sudden silence after the buzzing alerted people under the flight path to the impending impact.

Initially, V-1s landed within a circle in diameter, but by the end of the war, accuracy had been improved to about , which was comparable to the V-2 rocket.

=== Warhead ===
The warhead consisted of of Amatol, 52A+ high-grade, blast-effective explosive with three fuses. An electrical fuse could be triggered by nose or belly impact. Another fuse was a slow-acting mechanical fuse allowing deeper penetration into the ground, regardless of the altitude. The third fuse was a delayed action fuse, set to go off two hours after launch.

The purpose of the third fuse was to avoid the risk of this secret weapon being examined by the British. Its time delay was too short to be a useful booby trap but was instead meant to destroy the weapon if a soft landing had not triggered the impact fuses. These fusing systems were very reliable, and almost no dud V-1s were recovered.

===Walter catapult===

Ground-launched V-1s were propelled up an inclined launch ramp by an apparatus known as a (&quot;steam generator&quot;), in which steam was generated when hydrogen peroxide (T-Stoff) was mixed with sodium permanganate (Z-Stoff). Designed by Hellmuth Walter Kommanditgesellschaft, the WR 2.3 Schlitzrohrschleuder consisted of a small gas generator trailer, where the T-Stoff and Z-Stoff combined, generating high-pressure steam that was fed into a tube within the launch rail box. A piston in the tube, connected underneath the missile, was propelled forward by the steam. It is a common misconception that the steam launch was to allow the engine to start running but the real reason was that the Argus had insufficient power to propel the V1 to a speed above its extremely high stall speed. The launch rail was long, consisting of eight modular sections, each long, and a muzzle brake. Production of the Walter catapult began in January 1944.
The Walter catapult accelerated the V-1 to a launch speed of , well above the needed minimum operational speed of . The V-1 made British landfall at , but accelerated to by the time it reached London, as its of fuel burned off.

On 18 June 1943 Hermann Göring decided on launching the V-1, using the Walter catapult, in both large launch bunkers, called Wasserwerk, and lighter installations, called the Stellungsystem. The Wasserwerk bunker measured long, wide, and high. Four were initially to be built: Wasserwerk Desvres, Wasserwerk St. Pol, Wasserwerk Valognes, and Wasserwerk Cherbourg. Stellungsystem-I was to be operated by Flak Regiment 155(W), with 4 launch battalions, each having 4 launchers, and located in the Pas-de-Calais region. Stellungsystem-II, with 32 sites, was to act as a reserve unit. Stellungsystem-I and II had nine batteries manned by February 1944. Stellungsystem-III, operated by FR 255(W), was to be organized in the spring of 1944, and located between Rouen and Caen. The Stellungsystem locations included distinctive catapult walls pointed towards London, several J-shaped stowage buildings referred to as &quot;ski&quot; buildings as on aerial reconnaissance photographs the buildings looked like a ski on its side, and a compass correction building which was constructed without ferrous metal. In the spring of 1944, Oberst Schmalschläger had developed a more simplified launching site, called Einsatz Stellungen. Less conspicuous, 80 launch sites and 16 support sites were located from Calais to Normandy. Each site took only two weeks to construct, using 40 men, and the Walter catapult only took 7–8 days to erect, when the time was ready to make it operational.

Once near the launch ramp, the wing spar and wings were attached and the missile was slid off the loading trolley, Zubringerwagen, onto the launch ramp. The ramp catapult was powered by the Dampferzeuger trolley. The pulse-jet engine was started by the Anlassgerät, which provided compressed air for the engine intake, and electrical connection to the engine spark plug, and autopilot. The Bosch spark plug was only needed to start the engine, while residual flame ignited further mixtures of gasoline and air, and the engine would be at full power after 7 seconds. The catapult would then accelerate the bomb above its stall speed of , ensuring sufficient ram air.

==Operation Eisbär==

Mass production of the FZG-76 did not start until the spring of 1944, and FR 155(W) was not equipped until late May 1944. Operation Eisbär, the missile attacks on London, commenced on 12 June. However, the four launch battalions could only operate from the Pas-de-Calais area, amounting to only 72 launchers. They had been supplied with missiles, Walter catapults, fuel, and other associated equipment since D-Day. None of the nine missiles launched on the 12th reached England, while only four did so on the 13th. The next attempt to start the attack occurred on the night of 15/16 June, when 144 missiles reached England, of which 73 struck London, while 53 struck Portsmouth and Southampton.

Damage was widespread and Eisenhower ordered attacks on the V-1 sites as a priority. Operation Cobra forced a retreat from the French launch sites in August, with the last battalion leaving on 29 August. Operation Donnerschlag began from Germany on 21 October 1944.

==Operation and effectiveness==
The first complete V-1 airframe was delivered on 30 August 1942, and after the first complete As.109-014 was delivered in September, the first glide test flight was on 28 October 1942 at Peenemünde, from under a Focke-Wulf Fw 200. The first powered trial was on 10 December, launched from beneath an He 111.

The LXV &quot;Armeekorps z.b.V.&quot; (&quot;65th Army Corps for special deployment) formed during the last days of November 1943 in France commanded by &quot;General der Artillerie z.V.&quot; Erich Heinemann was responsible for the operational use of V-1.
The conventional launch sites could theoretically launch about 15 V-1s per day, but this rate was difficult to achieve on a consistent basis; the maximum rate achieved was 18. Overall, only about 25% of the V-1s hit their targets, the majority being lost because of a combination of defensive measures, mechanical unreliability or guidance errors. With the capture or destruction of the launch facilities used to attack England, the V-1s were employed in attacks against strategic points in Belgium, primarily the port of Antwerp.

Launches against Britain were met by a variety of countermeasures, including barrage balloons and aircraft such as the Hawker Tempest and newly introduced jet Gloster Meteor. These measures were so successful that by August 1944 about 80% of V-1s were being destroyed The Meteors suffered from frequent cannon failures, and accounted for only 13 V-1s destroyed. In all, about 1,000 V-1s were destroyed by aircraft.

The intended operational altitude was originally set at , but repeated failures of a barometric fuel-pressure regulator led to the operational height being halved in May 1944, bringing V-1s into range of the 40 mm Bofors light anti-aircraft guns commonly used by Allied AA units.
The trial versions of the V-1 were air-launched. Most operational V-1s were launched from static sites on land, but from July 1944 to January 1945, the launched approximately 1,176 from modified Heinkel He 111 H-22s of the &#x27;s &quot;Kampfgeschwader 3&quot; (3rd Bomber Wing, the so-called &quot;Blitz Wing&quot;) flying over the North Sea. Apart from the obvious motive of permitting the bombardment campaign to continue after static ground sites on the French coast were lost, air launching gave the the opportunity to outflank the increasingly effective ground and air defences put up by the British against the missile. To minimise the associated risks (primarily radar detection), the aircrews developed a tactic called &quot;lo-hi-lo&quot;: the He 111s would, upon leaving their airbases and crossing the coast, descend to an exceptionally low altitude. When the launch point was neared, the bombers would swiftly ascend, fire their V-1s, and then rapidly descend again to the previous &quot;wave-top&quot; level for the return flight. Research after the war estimated a 40% failure rate of air-launched V-1s, and the He 111s used in this role were vulnerable to night-fighter attack, as the launch lit up the area around the aircraft for several seconds. The combat potential of air-launched V-1s dwindled during 1944 at about the same rate as that of the ground-launched missiles, as the British gradually took the measure of the weapon and developed increasingly effective defence tactics.

==Experimental, piloted, and long-range variants==
===Piloted variant===
Late in the war, several air-launched piloted V-1s, known as , were built, but these were never used in combat. Hanna Reitsch made some flights in the modified V-1 Fieseler when she was asked to find out why test pilots were unable to land it and had died as a result. She discovered, after simulated landing attempts at high altitude, where there was air space to recover, that the craft had an extremely high stall speed, and the previous pilots with little high-speed experience had attempted their approaches much too slowly. Her recommendation of much higher landing speeds was then introduced in training new volunteer pilots. It was for this that she was awarded the Iron Cross First Class The s were air-launched rather than fired from a catapult ramp.

It had the appearance of a standard V1 with the addition of cockpit, ailerons, landing skids and flight instruments. The pilot would have been airlifted by either Heinkel He 111 or a Focke-Wulf Fw 200. After release, the pilot would start the pulse jet engine, select a target, set the controls then bail out. The chance of survival were considered very small, yet many pilots volunteered. Possibly 175 of these piloted V1s were converted at Darmesbury after initial development by Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug (DFS/German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight) at Ainring.
When Hitler banned the use of the piloted V1, most converted models were scrapped. However, a few were captured by the Allied Technical Air Intelligence crews in Germany. At least one was sent to England, and two, possibly three, were sent to the US for inspection.

Three different versions of the piloted FZG-76 were produced. The Reichenburg I was a one or two-seat unpowered glider intended for use as a training glider for pilot training. Reichenburg II was a single-seat FZG-76 fitted with a pulse jet power plant. A skid was fitted for dead stick landing to gain valuable flying experience. Reichenburg III was to be the operational piloted version of the V1, fitted with the amatol warhead in the nose. The front windscreen had thick bulletproof glass for pilot protection. The V1 pilot&#x27;s kit consisted of a parachute, helmet and life vest. A small case contained two small flares in a waterproof container.

===Air launch by Ar 234===
There were plans, not put into practice, to use the Arado Ar 234 jet bomber to launch V-1s either by towing them aloft or by launching them from a &quot;piggy back&quot; position (in the manner of the , but in reverse) atop the aircraft. In the latter configuration, a pilot-controlled, hydraulically operated dorsal trapeze mechanism would elevate the missile on the trapeze&#x27;s launch cradle about clear of the 234&#x27;s upper fuselage. This was necessary to avoid damaging the mother craft&#x27;s fuselage and tail surfaces when the pulsejet ignited, as well as to ensure a &quot;clean&quot; airflow for the Argus motor&#x27;s intake. A somewhat less ambitious project undertaken was the adaptation of the missile as a &quot;flying fuel tank&quot; for the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, which was initially test-towed behind an He 177A Greif bomber. The pulsejet, internal systems and warhead of the missile were removed, leaving only the wings and basic fuselage, now containing a single large fuel tank. A small cylindrical module, similar in shape to a finless dart, was placed atop the vertical stabiliser at the rear of the tank, acting as a centre of gravity balance and attachment point for a variety of equipment sets. A rigid towbar with a pitch pivot at the forward end connected the flying tank to the Me 262. The operational procedure for this unusual configuration saw the tank resting on a wheeled trolley for take-off. The trolley was dropped once the combination was airborne, and explosive bolts separated the towbar from the fighter upon exhaustion of the tank&#x27;s fuel supply. A number of test flights were conducted in 1944 with this set-up, but inflight &quot;porpoising&quot; of the tank, with the instability transferred to the fighter, meant that the system was too unreliable to be used. An identical utilisation of the V-1 flying tank for the Ar 234 bomber was also investigated, with the same conclusions reached. Some of the &quot;flying fuel tanks&quot; used in trials utilised a cumbersome fixed and spatted undercarriage arrangement, which (along with being pointless) merely increased the drag and stability problems already inherent in the design.

===F-1 version===
One variant of the basic Fi 103 design did see operational use. The progressive loss of French launch sites as 1944 proceeded and the area of territory under German control shrank meant that soon the V-1 would lack the range to hit targets in England. Air launching was one alternative utilised, but the most obvious solution was to extend the missile&#x27;s range. Thus, the F-1 version developed. The weapon&#x27;s fuel tank was increased in size, with a corresponding reduction in the capacity of the warhead. Additionally, the nose cones and wings of the F-1 models were made of wood, affording a considerable weight saving. With these modifications, the V-1 could be fired at London and nearby urban centres from prospective ground sites in the Netherlands. Frantic efforts were made to construct a sufficient number of F-1s in order to allow a large-scale bombardment campaign to coincide with the Ardennes Offensive, but numerous factors (bombing of the factories producing the missiles, shortages of steel and rail transport, the chaotic tactical situation Germany was facing at this point in the war, etc.) delayed the delivery of these long-range V-1s until February/March 1945. Beginning on 2 March 1945, slightly more than three weeks before the V-1 campaign finally ended, several hundred F-1s were launched at Britain from Dutch sites under Operation &quot;Zeppelin&quot;. Frustrated by increasing Allied dominance in the air, Germany also employed V-1s to attack the RAF&#x27;s forward airfields, such as Volkel, in the Netherlands.

===FZG-76 version===
There was also a turbojet-propelled upgraded variant proposed, meant to use the Porsche 109-005 low-cost turbojet engine with about thrust.

==Success of operations==
Almost 30,000 V-1s were made; by March 1944 they were each produced in 350 hours (including 120 for the autopilot), at a cost of just 4% of a V-2, which delivered a comparable payload. Approximately 10,000 were fired at England; 2,419 reached London, killing about 6,184 people and injuring 17,981. The greatest density of hits was received by Croydon, on the south-east fringe of London. Antwerp, Belgium was hit by 2,448 V-1s from October 1944 to March 1945.

==Intelligence reports==
The codename &quot; 76&quot;—&quot;Flak target apparatus&quot; helped to hide the nature of the device, and some time passed before references to FZG 76 were linked to the V-83 pilotless aircraft (an experimental V-1) that had crashed on Bornholm in the Baltic and to reports from agents of a flying bomb capable of being used against London. Importantly, the Luxembourgish Resistance, as well as the Polish Home Army intelligence contributed information on V-1 construction and a place of development (Peenemünde). Initially, British experts were sceptical of the V-1 because they had considered only solid-fuel rockets, which could not attain the stated range of . However, they later considered other types of engine, and by the time German scientists had achieved the needed accuracy to deploy the V-1 as a weapon, British intelligence had a very accurate assessment of it.

==Countermeasures in England==
===Anti-aircraft guns===

The British defence against German long-range weapons was known by the codename Operation Crossbow with Operation Diver covering countermeasures to the V-1. Anti-aircraft guns of the Royal Artillery and RAF Regiment redeployed in several movements: first in mid-June 1944 from positions on the North Downs to the south coast of England, then a cordon closing the Thames Estuary to attacks from the east. In September 1944 a new linear defence line was formed on the coast of East Anglia, and finally in December there was a further layout along the Lincolnshire–Yorkshire coast. The deployments were prompted by changes to the approach tracks of the V-1 as launch sites were overrun by the Allies&#x27; advance.

On the first night of sustained bombardment, the anti-aircraft crews around Croydon were jubilant—suddenly they were downing unprecedented numbers of German bombers; most of their targets burst into flames and fell when their engines cut out. There was great disappointment when the truth was announced. Anti-aircraft gunners soon found that such small fast-moving targets were, in fact, very difficult to hit. The cruising altitude of the V-1, between , meant that anti-aircraft guns could not traverse fast enough to hit the missile.

The standard British QF 3.7-inch mobile gun could not cope with the altitude and speed of the V-1. However, the static version of the QF 3.7-inch, designed for a permanent concrete platform, had a faster traverse. The cost and delay of installing new permanent platforms for the guns was found to be unnecessary as a temporary platform devised by the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and made from railway sleepers and rails was found to be adequate for the static guns, making them considerably easier to re-deploy as the V-1 threat changed.

The development of the proximity fuze and of centimetric, 3 gigahertz frequency gun-laying radars based on the cavity magnetron helped to counter the V-1&#x27;s high speed and small size. In 1944, Bell Labs started delivery of an anti-aircraft predictor fire-control system based on an analogue computer, just in time for the Allied invasion of Europe.

These electronic aids arrived in quantity from June 1944, just as the guns reached their firing positions on the coast. Seventeen per cent of all flying bombs entering the coastal &quot;gun belt&quot; were destroyed by guns in their first week on the coast. This rose to 60 per cent by 23 August and 74 per cent in the last week of the month, when on one day 82 per cent were shot down. The rate improved from thousands of shells for every one V-1 destroyed to 100 for each. This mostly ended the V-1 threat. As General Frederick Pile put it in an April 5, 1946 article in the London &quot;Times&quot;: &quot;It was the proximity fuse which made possible the 100 per cent successes that A.A. Command was obtaining regularly in the early months of last year...American scientists...gave us the final answer to the flying bomb.&quot;

===Barrage balloons===
Eventually about 2,000 barrage balloons were deployed, in the hope that V-1s would be destroyed when they struck the balloons&#x27; tethering cables. The leading edges of the V-1&#x27;s wings were fitted with Kuto cable cutters, and fewer than 300 V-1s are known to have been brought down by barrage balloons.

===Interceptors===

The Defence Committee expressed some doubt as to the ability of the Royal Observer Corps to adequately deal with the new threat, but the ROC&#x27;s Commandant Air Commodore Finlay Crerar assured the committee that the ROC could again rise to the occasion and prove its alertness and flexibility. He oversaw plans for handling the new threat, codenamed by the RAF and ROC as &quot;Operation Totter&quot;, which included a proposal whereby ROC posts would fire &#x27;Snowflake&#x27; illuminating rocket flares in order to alert RAF fighters to the presence of a V-1.

Observers at the coast post of Dymchurch identified the very first of these weapons and within seconds of their report the anti-aircraft defences were in action. This new weapon gave the ROC much additional work both at posts and operations rooms. Eventually RAF controllers actually took their radio equipment to the two closest ROC operations rooms at Horsham and Maidstone, and vectored fighters direct from the ROC&#x27;s plotting tables. The critics who had said that the Corps would be unable to handle the fast-flying jet aircraft were answered when these aircraft on their first operation were actually controlled entirely by using ROC information both on the coast and at inland.

The average speed of V-1s was and their average altitude was to . Fighter aircraft required excellent low altitude performance to intercept them and enough firepower to ensure that they were destroyed in the air (ideally, also from a sufficient distance, to avoid being damaged by the strong blast) rather than the V-1 crashing to earth and detonating. Most aircraft were too slow to catch a V-1 unless they had a height advantage, allowing them to gain speed by diving on their target.

When V-1 attacks began in mid-June 1944, the only aircraft with the low-altitude speed to be effective against it was the Hawker Tempest. Fewer than 30 Tempests were available. They were assigned to No. 150 Wing RAF. Early attempts to intercept and destroy V-1s often failed, but improved techniques soon emerged. These included using the airflow over an interceptor&#x27;s wing to raise one wing of the V-1, by sliding the wingtip to within of the lower surface of the V-1&#x27;s wing. If properly executed, this manoeuvre would tip the V-1&#x27;s wing up, over-riding the gyro and sending the V-1 into an out-of-control dive. At least sixteen V-1s were destroyed this way (the first by a P-51 piloted by Major R. E. Turner of 356th Fighter Squadron on 18 June).

The Tempest fleet was built up to over 100 aircraft by September, and during the short summer nights the Tempests shared defensive duty with twin-engined de Havilland Mosquitos. Specially modified Republic P-47M Thunderbolts were also pressed into service against the V-1s; they had boosted engines () and had half their .50 calibre (12.7 mm) machine guns and half their fuel tanks, all external fittings and all their armour plate removed to reduce weight. In addition, North American P-51 Mustangs and Griffon-engined Supermarine Spitfire Mk XIVs were tuned to make them fast enough. At night airborne radar was not needed, as the V-1 engine could be heard from away or more and the exhaust plume was visible from a long distance. Wing Commander Roland Beamont had the 20 mm cannon on his Tempest adjusted to converge at ahead. This was so successful that all other aircraft in 150 Wing were thus modified.

The anti-V-1 sorties by fighters were known as &quot;Diver patrols&quot; (after &quot;Diver&quot;, the codename used by the Royal Observer Corps for V-1 sightings). Attacking a V-1 was dangerous: machine guns had little effect on the V-1&#x27;s sheet steel structure, and if a cannon shell detonated the warhead, the explosion could destroy the attacker.
In daylight, V-1 chases were chaotic and often unsuccessful until a special defence zone was declared between London and the coast, in which only the fastest fighters were permitted. The first interception of a V-1 was by F/L J. G. Musgrave with a No. 605 Squadron RAF Mosquito night fighter on the night of 14/15 June 1944. As daylight grew stronger after the night attack, a Spitfire was seen to follow closely behind a V-1 over Chislehurst and Lewisham. Between June and 5 September 1944, a handful of 150 Wing Tempests shot down 638 flying bombs, with No. 3 Squadron RAF alone claiming 305. One Tempest pilot, Squadron Leader Joseph Berry (501 Squadron), shot down 59 V-1s, the Belgian ace Squadron Leader Remy Van Lierde (164 Squadron) destroyed 44 (with a further nine shared), W/C Roland Beamont destroyed 31, and F/Lt Arthur Umbers (No. 3 squadron) destroyed 28. A Dutch pilot in 322 Squadron, Jan Leendert Plesman, son of KLM president Albert Plesman, managed to destroy 12 in 1944, flying a Spitfire.

The next most successful interceptors were the Mosquito (623 victories), Spitfire XIV (303), and Mustang (232). All other types combined added 158. Even though it was not fully operational, the jet-powered Gloster Meteor was rushed into service with No. 616 Squadron RAF to fight the V-1s. It had ample speed but its cannons were prone to jamming, and it shot down only 13 V-1s.

In late 1944 a radar-equipped Vickers Wellington bomber was modified for use by the RAF&#x27;s Fighter Interception Unit as an airborne early warning and control aircraft. Flying at an altitude of over the North Sea at night, it directed Mosquito and Beaufighters charged with intercepting He 111s from Dutch airbases that sought to launch V-1s from the air.

===Disposal===
The first bomb disposal officer to defuse an unexploded V-1 was John Pilkington Hudson in 1944.

===Deception===
To adjust and correct settings in the V-1 guidance system, the Germans needed to know where the V-1s were impacting. Therefore, German intelligence was requested to obtain this impact data from their agents in Britain. However, all German agents in Britain had been turned and were acting as double agents under British control.
On 16 June 1944 British double agent &quot;Garbo&quot; (Juan Pujol) was requested by his German controllers to give information on the sites and times of V-1 impacts, with similar requests made to the other German agents in Britain, &quot;Brutus&quot; (Roman Czerniawski) and &quot;Tate&quot; (Wulf Schmidt). If the Germans had been supplied these data, they would have been able to adjust their aim and correct any shortfall. However, the double agents would have been endangered because there was no plausible reason why they could not supply accurate data; the impacts would be common knowledge amongst Londoners and very likely reported in the press, which the Germans had ready access to through the neutral nations. As John Cecil Masterman, chairman of the Twenty Committee, commented, &quot;If, for example, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral were hit, it was useless and harmful to report that the bomb had descended upon a cinema in Islington, since the truth would inevitably get through to Germany ...&quot;

While the British decided how to react, Pujol played for time. On 18 June it was decided that the double agents would report the damage caused by V-1s fairly accurately and minimise the effect they had on civilian morale. It was also decided that Pujol should avoid giving the times of impacts and should mostly report on those which occurred in the northwest of London, to give the impression to the Germans that they were overshooting the target area.

While Pujol downplayed the extent of V-1 damage, trouble came from &quot;Ostro&quot;, an agent in Lisbon who pretended to have agents reporting from London. He told the Germans that London had been devastated and had been mostly evacuated as a result of enormous casualties. The Germans could not perform aerial reconnaissance of London and believed his damage reports in preference to Pujol&#x27;s. They thought that the Allies would make every effort to destroy the V-1 launch sites in France. They also accepted &quot;Ostro&quot;″s impact reports. Due to Ultra, however, the Allies read his messages and adjusted for them.
A certain number of the V-1s fired had been fitted with radio transmitters, which had clearly demonstrated a tendency for the V-1 to fall short. Max Wachtel, commander of Flak Regiment 155 (W), which was responsible for the V-1 offensive, compared the data gathered by the transmitters with the reports obtained through the double agents. He concluded, when faced with the discrepancy between the two sets of data, that there must be a fault with the radio transmitters, as he had been assured that the agents were completely reliable. It was later calculated that if Wachtel had disregarded the agents&#x27; reports and relied on the radio data, he would have made the correct adjustments to the V-1&#x27;s guidance, and casualties might have increased by 50 per cent or more.

The policy of diverting V-1 impacts away from central London was initially controversial. The War Cabinet refused to authorise a measure that would increase casualties in any area, even if it reduced casualties elsewhere by greater amounts. It was thought that Churchill would reverse this decision later (he was then away at a conference); but the delay in starting the reports to Germans might be fatal to the deception. So Sir Findlater Stewart of Home Defence Executive took responsibility for starting the deception programme immediately, and his action was approved by Churchill when he returned.

==Effect==
The use of land-launched V-1s against Great Britain ended on 1 September after which the campaign continued using air-launched missiles. In total, 10,492 V-1s were launched against Britain, with a nominal aiming point of Tower Bridge. 7,500 incoming missiles were observed by the British defenders of which 1,847 were downed by fighters, 1,878 were destroyed by anti aircraft fire and 232 struck barrage balloons. 2,419 V-1s reached the London civil defence region, inflicting 6,184 fatalities and 17,981 serious injuries. On the 28 March the last V-1 reached London.

==Assessment==
Unlike the V-2, the V-1 was a cost-effective weapon for the Germans as it forced the Allies to spend heavily on defensive measures and divert bombers from other targets. More than 25% of Combined Bomber Offensive&#x27;s bombs in July and August 1944 were used against V-weapon sites, often ineffectively. In early December 1944, American General Clayton Bissell wrote a paper that strongly demonstrated the cost-effectiveness for the Germans of the V-1 when compared with conventional bombers. The following is a table he produced:


The statistics of this report, however, have been the subject of some dispute. The V-1 missiles launched from bombers were often prone to exploding prematurely, occasionally resulting in the loss of the aircraft to which they were attached. The Luftwaffe lost 77 aircraft in 1,200 of these sorties.

Wright Field technical personnel reverse-engineered the V-1 from the remains of one that had failed to detonate in Britain and the Republic-Ford JB-2 was being delivered by early 1945. After the end of the war in Europe it was in consideration for use against Japan. General Hap Arnold of the United States Army Air Forces was concerned that this weapon would make his long-range bombers less important, since they were much cheaper and could be built of steel and wood, in 2,000 man-hours and approximate cost of US$600 (in 1943). 

==Belgian attacks==
The attacks on Antwerp and Brussels began in October 1944, with the last V-1 launched against Antwerp on 30 March 1945. The shorter range improved the accuracy of the V-1 which was deviation per of flight, the flight level was also reduced to around .

The Port of Antwerp was recognised by both the German and Allied high commands as a very important port. It was essential logistically for the further progression of Allied armies into Germany, although initially Montgomery had not given high priority to seizure of the Scheldt estuary giving access to the port.

===Countermeasures at Antwerp===
Both British (80th Anti-Aircraft Brigade) and US Army anti-aircraft batteries (30th AAA Group) were sent to Antwerp together with a searchlight regiment. The zone of command under the 21st Army Group was called &quot;Antwerp-X&quot; and given the object of protecting an area with a radius of covering the city and dock area. Initially attacks came from the south-east, accordingly a screen of observers and searchlights was deployed along the attack azimuth, behind which were three rows of batteries with additional searchlights.

US units deployed SCR-584 radar units controlling four 90 mm guns per battery using an M9 director to electrically control the battery guns. 

British gun batteries were each equipped with eight QF 3.7-inch AA gun (94 mm) and two radar units, preferably the US SCR-584 with M9 director as it was more accurate than the British system.

The radar was effective from , the M9 director predicted the target location position based on course, height and speed which combined with the gun, shell and fuse characteristics predicted an impact position, adjusted each gun and fired the shell.

In November attacks began from the north-east and additional batteries were deployed along the new azimuths, including the 184th AAA Battalion (United States) brought from Paris. Additional radar units and observers were deployed up to 40 miles from Antwerp to give early warning of V-1 bombs approaching. The introduction of the VT fuse in January 1945 improved the effectiveness of the guns and reduced ammunition consumption.

From October 1944 to March 1945, 4,883 V-1s were detected. Of these, only 4.5% fell into the designated protected area.

==Japanese developments==
In 1943 an Argus pulsejet engine was shipped to Japan by German submarine. The Aeronautical Institute of Tokyo Imperial University and the Kawanishi Aircraft Company conducted a joint study of the feasibility of mounting a similar engine on a piloted plane. The resulting design was named  (&quot;plum blossom&quot;) but bore no more than a superficial resemblance to the Fi 103. never left the design stage, but technical drawings and notes suggest that several versions were considered: an air-launched version with the engine under the fuselage, a ground-launched version that could take off without a ramp and a submarine launched version with the engine moved forwards.

==Post-war==
===France===
After reverse-engineering captured V-1s in 1946, the French began producing copies for use as target drones, starting in 1951. These were called the ARSAERO CT 10 and were smaller than the V-1. The CT 10 could be ground-launched using solid rocket boosters or air-launched from a LeO 45 bomber. More than 400 were produced, some of which were exported to the UK, Sweden, and Italy.

===Soviet Union===
The Soviet Union captured V-1s when they overran the Blizna test range in Poland, as well as from the Mittelwerk. The 10Kh was their copy of the V-1, later called Izdeliye 10. Initial tests began in March 1945 at a test range in Tashkent, with further launches from ground sites and from aircraft of improved versions continuing into the late 1940s. The inaccuracy of the guidance system when compared with new methods such as beam-riding and TV guidance saw development end in the early 1950s.

The Soviets also worked on a piloted attack aircraft based on the Argus pulsejet engine of the V-1, which began as a German project, the Junkers EF 126 , in the latter stages of the war. The Soviet development of the ended in 1946 after a crash that killed the test pilot.
===United States===
The United States reverse-engineered the V-1 in 1944 from salvaged parts recovered in England during June. By 8 September, the first of thirteen complete prototype Republic-Ford JB-2, was assembled at Republic Aviation. The United States JB-2 was different from the German V-1 in only the smallest of dimensions, with only the forward pulsejet support pylon visibly differing in shape from the original German pilotless ordnance design. The wingspan was only wider and the length was extended less than . The difference gave the JB-2 of wing area versus for the V-1.

A navalised version, designated KGW-1, was developed to be launched from LSTs as well as escort carriers (CVEs) and long-range 4-engine reconnaissance aircraft. Waterproof carriers for the KGW-1 were developed for launches of the missile from surfaced submarines. Both the USAAF JB-2 and Navy KGW-1 were put into production and were planned to be used in the Allied invasion of Japan (Operation Downfall). However, the surrender of Japan obviated the need for its use. After the end of the war, the JB-2/KGW-1 played a significant role in the development of more advanced surface-to-surface tactical missile systems such as the MGM-1 Matador and SSM-N-8 Regulus.

<text>Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) is the process of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining millions or billions of MOS transistors onto a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when MOS integrated circuit (metal oxide semiconductor) chips were developed and then widely adopted, enabling complex semiconductor and telecommunications technologies. The microprocessor and memory chips are VLSI devices.

Before the introduction of VLSI technology, most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform. An electronic circuit might consist of a CPU, ROM, RAM and other glue logic. VLSI enables IC designers to add all of these into one chip.
== History ==
=== Background ===
The history of the transistor dates to the 1920s when several inventors attempted devices that were intended to control current in solid-state diodes and convert them into triodes. Success came after World War II, when the use of silicon and germanium crystals as radar detectors led to improvements in fabrication and theory. Scientists who had worked on radar returned to solid-state device development. With the invention of the first transistor at Bell Labs in 1947, the field of electronics shifted from vacuum tubes to solid-state devices.

With the small transistor at their hands, electrical engineers of the 1950s saw the possibilities of constructing far more advanced circuits. However, as the complexity of circuits grew, problems arose. One problem was the size of the circuit. A complex circuit like a computer was dependent on speed. If the components were large, the wires interconnecting them must be long. The electric signals took time to go through the circuit, thus slowing the computer.

The invention of the integrated circuit by Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce solved this problem by making all the components and the chip out of the same block (monolith) of semiconductor material. The circuits could be made smaller, and the manufacturing process could be automated. This led to the idea of integrating all components on a single-crystal silicon wafer, which led to small-scale integration (SSI) in the early 1960s, and then medium-scale integration (MSI) in the late 1960s.

=== VLSI ===
General Microelectronics introduced the first commercial MOS integrated circuit in 1964. In the early 1970s, MOS integrated circuit technology allowed the integration of more than 10,000 transistors in a single chip. This paved the way for VLSI in the 1970s and 1980s, with tens of thousands of MOS transistors on a single chip (later hundreds of thousands, then millions, and now billions).

The first semiconductor chips held two transistors each. Subsequent advances added more transistors, and as a consequence, more individual functions or systems were integrated over time. The first integrated circuits held only a few devices, perhaps as many as ten diodes, transistors, resistors and capacitors, making it possible to fabricate one or more logic gates on a single device. Now known retrospectively as &quot;small-scale integration&quot; (SSI), improvements in technique led to devices with hundreds of logic gates, known as &quot;medium-scale integration&quot; (MSI). Further improvements led to &quot;large-scale integration&quot; (LSI), i.e. systems with at least a thousand logic gates. Current technology has moved far past this mark and today&#x27;s microprocessors have many millions of gates and billions of individual transistors.

At one time, there was an effort to name and calibrate various levels of large-scale integration above VLSI. Terms like &quot;ultra-large-scale integration&quot; (ULSI) were used. But the huge number of gates and transistors available on common devices has rendered such fine distinctions moot. Terms suggesting greater than VLSI levels of integration are no longer in widespread use.

In 2008, billion-transistor processors became commercially available. This became more commonplace as semiconductor fabrication advanced from the then-current generation of 65 nm processors. Current designs, unlike the earliest devices, use extensive design automation and automated logic synthesis to lay out the transistors, enabling higher levels of complexity in the resulting logic functionality. Certain high-performance logic blocks, like the SRAM (static random-access memory) cell, are still designed by hand to ensure the highest efficiency.

== Structured design ==
Structured VLSI design is a modular methodology originated by Carver Mead and Lynn Conway for saving microchip area by minimizing the interconnect fabric area. This is obtained by repetitive arrangement of rectangular macro blocks which can be interconnected using wiring by abutment. An example is partitioning the layout of an adder into a row of equal bit slices cells. In complex designs this structuring may be achieved by hierarchical nesting.

Structured VLSI design had been popular in the early 1980s, but lost its popularity later because of the advent of placement and routing tools wasting a lot of area by routing, which is tolerated because of the progress of Moore&#x27;s law. When introducing the hardware description language KARL in the mid-1970s, Reiner Hartenstein coined the term &quot;structured VLSI design&quot; (originally as &quot;structured LSI design&quot;), echoing Edsger Dijkstra&#x27;s structured programming approach by procedure nesting to avoid chaotic &quot;spaghetti-structured&quot; programs.

== Difficulties ==

As microprocessors become more complex due to technology scaling, microprocessor designers have encountered several challenges which force them to think beyond the design plane, and look ahead to post-silicon:

* Process variation – As photolithography techniques get closer to the fundamental laws of optics, achieving high accuracy in doping concentrations and etched wires is becoming more difficult and prone to errors due to variation. Designers now must simulate across multiple fabrication process corners before a chip is certified ready for production, or use system-level techniques for dealing with effects of variation.
* Stricter design rules – Due to lithography and etch issues with scaling, design rule checking for layout has become increasingly stringent. Designers must keep in mind an ever increasing list of rules when laying out custom circuits. The overhead for custom design is now reaching a tipping point, with many design houses opting to switch to electronic design automation (EDA) tools to automate their design process.
* Timing/design closure – As clock frequencies tend to scale up, designers are finding it more difficult to distribute and maintain low clock skew between these high frequency clocks across the entire chip. This has led to a rising interest in multicore and multiprocessor architectures, since an overall speedup can be obtained even with lower clock frequency by using the computational power of all the cores.
* First-pass success – As die sizes shrink (due to scaling), and wafer sizes go up (due to lower manufacturing costs), the number of dies per wafer increases, and the complexity of making suitable photomasks goes up rapidly. A mask set for a modern technology can cost several million dollars. This non-recurring expense deters the old iterative philosophy involving several &quot;spin-cycles&quot; to find errors in silicon, and encourages first-pass silicon success. Several design philosophies have been developed to aid this new design flow, including design for manufacturing (DFM), design for test (DFT), and Design for X.

<text>VSO is a not-for-profit international development organization charity with a vision for &quot;a fair world for everyone&quot; and a mission to &quot;create lasting change through volunteering&quot;. VSO delivers development impact through a blended volunteer model consisting of international, national, and community volunteers working together to develop the systems and conditions for positive social change.
In 2022–23, VSO worked in 35 countries in Africa and Asia.

VSO currently works in the following core programme areas: 
* Inclusive Education
* Health
* Livelihoods
And through three core approaches that are relevant to all the areas:
* Social Inclusion and Gender
* Social Accountability
* Resilience

In addition, VSO has a youth focus in which young people are both the beneficiaries of social change outcomes as well as the primary actors in creating the change.

==Structure and governance==
VSO (formerly known as Voluntary Service Overseas) is a company limited by guarantee. VSO operates internationally largely through branch offices. Exceptions to this are:
* Voluntary Service Overseas (Ireland) Limited Company Limited by Guarantee, which is a subsidiary of VSO and incorporated as a charitable entity in Ireland.
* VSO India, which has agreements in place with the independent Indian charitable organisation, VSO India Trust. These agreements permit the Trust to carry out VSO&#x27;s work using the VSO trademark.
* Stitching VSO Netherland, which is a Dutch independent charitable organisation that has agreements with VSO, including a trademark license, and whose accounts were integrated with VSO&#x27;s as of April 2018.
* Voluntary Service Overseas USA, Inc., a US 501(c) organisation(iii).

VSO&#x27;s governing body is the International Board, currently comprising seven trustees. The day-to-day management of VSO is carried out by the executive board, which has operational oversight of VSO&#x27;s global work. Each Executive Board member is responsible for a function of VSO: People, Programmes, Business Development, and Finance.

==History==
VSO was founded in 1958 by Alec and Mora Dickson through a bishop&#x27;s letter to the London paper, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, as an educational experience overseas for school-leavers, initially only male, before starting university. Volunteers offered unskilled help in return for basic accommodation and pocket money. In 1962, the practice changed to using university graduate volunteers.

By 1980, the unskilled volunteers had been completely phased out and the length of service had been extended to two years. Active volunteer numbers initially dropped to about 750, but by 2003 had returned to about 1,400. Since December 2004, applications to volunteer have been accepted from those between ages 20 and 75, who also must have at least two years&#x27; experience in their field.

In the early 1990s, in order to meet growing demand for highly specialised and skilled volunteers from its partners in developing countries, VSO established partner agencies in Canada, the Netherlands, Kenya/Uganda (VSO Jitolee), and the Philippines (VSO Bahaginan). In 2004, VSO launched a partnership called (iVO) in India with , an existing volunteering program of MITRA, an Indian NGO. VSO&#x27;s structure evolved to become an international federation which now includes Ireland, China and India as well as the above named countries. International volunteers are recruited through all of these bases, and they can be placed in any one of VSO&#x27;s programmes (e.g. an Irish volunteer working in Nepal, or a Ugandan volunteer working in Tajikistan).

From 2011, VSO led a consortium to deliver the UK government&#x27;s International Citizen Service programme that provides international volunteer placements for 18- to 25-year-olds. The programme, funded by the Department for International Development (DFID), now includes Raleigh International and Restless Development. In 2016/17, 3,090 young people volunteered through the International Citizen Service programme.

In 2017, VSO was awarded a grant of £50 million from the UK&#x27;s Department of International Development (DFID) for a program called &quot;Volunteering for Development&quot;. The three-year initiative aims to improve quality and access to health and education services as well as livelihood opportunities for the most poor and vulnerable, and targets more than 2 million of the poorest and most marginalised people across the globe. The grant supports VSO&#x27;s vision to enhance effectiveness across a number of vital areas - including in VSO&#x27;s &quot;core approaches&quot; of social inclusion and gender, social accountability, and resilience. During its first year the project successfully placed 606 international volunteers and 920 national volunteers across VSO&#x27;s four areas of focus.

==Today==
Highlights of VSO today include:
* VSO supports the delivery of integrated, large-scale education, health and livelihoods programmes in a range of countries. Its programmes reached over 3.5 million people directly in 2022/23
* VSO now works in post-crisis situations and has recently responded to disasters in Bangladesh, Nepal, the Philippines and Sierra Leone. Most recently it has supported the establishment of a home-based early childhood care and education (ECCE) in emergencies to support refugee Rohingya communities in Bangladesh 
* It supports communities and governments to inform and influence policy dialogues. It recently supported the development of the Africa Union Gender Strategy and the Kenya Special Education Needs Policy.
* In Nepal, VSO has been awarded nearly £10 million for inclusive education work through the UK&#x27;s Girls&#x27; Education Challenge, the world&#x27;s largest education challenge fund, which targets support for adolescent girls. In its first phase the project Sisters for Sisters&#x27; Education introduced to Nepal the first ever peer-based mentoring programme for marginalised girls.
* Citizen Led Monitoring is now a key element of VSOs work. In 2017/18 over 20,000 people in Nepal and Uganda were mobilized for awareness raising and accountability on the delivery of the sustainable development goals
* VSO is supporting the creation of national youth platforms in seven of its countries of operation
* It is playing a leading part in the development of a global standard for responsible and impactful volunteering as part of the Forum for International Volunteering in Development.

===Partnerships===
VSO works with local partners in the communities they work with, placing volunteers with these partners to help increase their impact and effectiveness. VSO also has corporate partnerships and sponsors.

<text>Varicose veins, also known as varicoses, are a medical condition in which superficial veins become enlarged and twisted. Although usually just a cosmetic ailment, in some cases they cause fatigue, pain, itching, and nighttime leg cramps. These veins typically develop in the legs, just under the skin. Their complications can include bleeding, skin ulcers, and superficial thrombophlebitis. Varices in the scrotum are known as varicocele, while those around the anus are known as hemorrhoids. The physical, social, and psychological effects of varicose veins can lower their bearers&#x27; quality of life.
Varicose veins have no specific cause. Risk factors include obesity, lack of exercise, leg trauma, and family history of the condition. They also develop more commonly during pregnancy. Occasionally they result from chronic venous insufficiency. Underlying causes include weak or damaged valves in the veins. They are typically diagnosed by examination, including observation by ultrasound.

By contrast, spider veins affect the capillaries and are smaller.
Treatment may involve lifestyle changes or medical procedures with the goal of improving symptoms and appearance. Lifestyle changes may include wearing compression stockings, exercising, elevating the legs, and weight loss. Possible medical procedures include sclerotherapy, laser surgery, and vein stripping. However, recurrence is common following treatment.
Varicose veins are very common, affecting about 30% of people at some point in their lives. They become more common with age. Women develop varicose veins about twice as often as men. Varicose veins have been described throughout history and have been treated with surgery since at least the second century BC, when Plutarch tells of such treatment performed on the Roman leader Gaius Marius.

== Signs and symptoms ==
* Aching, heavy legs
* Appearance of spider veins (telangiectasia) in the affected leg
* Ankle swelling
* A brownish-yellow shiny skin discoloration near the affected veins
* Redness, dryness, and itchiness of areas of skin, termed stasis dermatitis or venous eczema
* Muscle cramps when making sudden movements, such as standing
* Abnormal bleeding or healing time for injuries in the affected area
* Lipodermatosclerosis or shrinking skin near the ankles
* Restless legs syndrome appears to be a common overlapping clinical syndrome in people with varicose veins and other chronic venous insufficiency
* Atrophie blanche, or white, scar-like formations
* Burning or throbbing sensation in the legs
People with varicose veins might have a positive D-dimer blood test result due to chronic low-level thrombosis within dilated veins (varices).

=== Complications ===
Most varicose veins are reasonably benign, but severe varicosities can lead to major complications, due to the poor circulation through the affected limb.
* Pain, tenderness, heaviness, inability to walk or stand for long hours
* Skin conditions / dermatitis which could predispose skin loss
* Skin ulcers especially near the ankle, usually referred to as venous ulcers
* Development of carcinoma or sarcoma in longstanding venous ulcers. Over 100 reported cases of malignant transformation have been reported at a rate reported as 0.4% to 1%
* Severe bleeding from minor trauma, of particular concern in the elderly
* Blood clotting within affected veins, termed superficial thrombophlebitis. These are frequently isolated to the superficial veins, but can extend into deep veins, becoming a more serious problem.
* Acute fat necrosis can occur, especially at the ankle of overweight people with varicose veins. Females have a higher tendency of being affected than males

== Causes ==

Varicose veins are more common in women than in men and are linked with heredity. Other related factors are pregnancy, obesity, menopause, aging, prolonged standing, leg injury and abdominal straining. Varicose veins are unlikely to be caused by crossing the legs or ankles. Less commonly, but not exceptionally, varicose veins can be due to other causes, such as post-phlebitic obstruction or incontinence, venous and arteriovenous malformations.

Venous reflux is a significant cause. Research has also shown the importance of pelvic vein reflux (PVR) in the development of varicose veins. Varicose veins in the legs could be due to ovarian vein reflux. Both ovarian and internal iliac vein reflux causes leg varicose veins. This condition affects 14% of women with varicose veins or 20% of women who have had vaginal delivery and have leg varicose veins. In addition, evidence suggests that failing to look for and treat pelvic vein reflux can be a cause of recurrent varicose veins.

There is increasing evidence for the role of incompetent perforator veins (or &quot;perforators&quot;) in the formation of varicose veins. and recurrent varicose veins.

Varicose veins could also be caused by hyperhomocysteinemia in the body, which can degrade and inhibit the formation of the three main structural components of the artery: collagen, elastin and the proteoglycans. Homocysteine permanently degrades cysteine disulfide bridges and lysine amino acid residues in proteins, gradually affecting function and structure. Simply put, homocysteine is a &#x27;corrosive&#x27; of long-living proteins, i.e. collagen or elastin, or lifelong proteins, i.e. fibrillin. These long-term effects are difficult to establish in clinical trials focusing on groups with existing artery decline. Klippel–Trenaunay syndrome and Parkes Weber syndrome are relevant for differential diagnosis.

Another cause is chronic alcohol consumption due to the vasodilatation side effect in relation to gravity and blood viscosity.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Clinical test ===
Clinical tests that may be used include:
* Trendelenburg test – to determine the site of venous reflux and the nature of the saphenofemoral junction

=== Investigations ===

Traditionally, varicose veins were investigated using imaging techniques only if there was a suspicion of deep venous insufficiency, if they were recurrent, or if they involved the saphenopopliteal junction. This practice is now less widely accepted. People with varicose veins should now be investigated using lower limbs venous ultrasonography. The results from a randomised controlled trial on patients with and without routine ultrasound have shown a significant difference in recurrence rate and reoperation rate at 2 and 7 years of follow-up.

=== Stages ===
The CEAP (Clinical, Etiological, Anatomical, and Pathophysiological) Classification, developed in 1994 by an international ad hoc committee of the American Venous Forum, outlines these stages

* C0 – Perthes test – no visible or palpable signs of venous disease
* C1 – telangectasia or reticular veins
* C2 – varicose veins
* C2r – recurrent varicose veins
* C3 – edema
* C4 – changes in skin and subcutaneous tissue due to Chronic Venous Disease
* C4a – pigmentation or eczema
* C4b – lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche
* C4c – Corona phlebectatica
* C5 – healed venous ulcer
* C6 – active venous ulcer
* C6r – recurrent active ulcer

Each clinical class is further characterized by a subscript depending upon whether the patient is symptomatic (S) or asymptomatic (A), e.g. C2S.

== Treatment ==
Treatment can be either active or conservative.

=== Active ===
Treatment options include surgery, laser and radiofrequency ablation, and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy. Newer treatments include cyanoacrylate glue, mechanochemical ablation, and endovenous steam ablation. No real difference could be found between the treatments, except that radiofrequency ablation could have a better long-term benefit.

=== Conservative ===
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) produced clinical guidelines in July 2013 recommending that all people with symptomatic varicose veins (C2S) and worse should be referred to a vascular service for treatment. Conservative treatments such as support stockings should not be used unless treatment was not possible.

The symptoms of varicose veins can be controlled to an extent with the following:
* Elevating the legs often provides temporary symptomatic relief.
* Advice about regular exercise sounds sensible but is not supported by any evidence.
* The wearing of graduated compression stockings with variable pressure gradients (Class II or III) has been shown to correct the swelling, increase nutritional exchange, and improve the microcirculation in legs affected by varicose veins. They also often provide relief from the discomfort associated with this disease. Caution should be exercised in their use in patients with concurrent peripheral arterial disease.
* The wearing of intermittent pneumatic compression devices has been shown to reduce swelling and pain.
* Diosmin/hesperidin and other flavonoids.
* Anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen or aspirin can be used as part of treatment for superficial thrombophlebitis along with graduated compression hosiery – but there is a risk of intestinal bleeding. In extensive superficial thrombophlebitis, consideration should be given to anti-coagulation, thrombectomy, or sclerotherapy of the involved vein.
* Topical gel application helps in managing symptoms related to varicose veins such as inflammation, pain, swelling, itching, and dryness.

=== Procedures ===
==== Stripping ====
Stripping consists of removal of all or part the saphenous vein (great/long or lesser/short) main trunk. The complications include deep vein thrombosis (5.3%), pulmonary embolism (0.06%), and wound complications including infection (2.2%). There is evidence for the great saphenous vein regrowing after stripping. For traditional surgery, reported recurrence rates, which have been tracked for 10 years, range from 5% to 60%. In addition, since stripping removes the saphenous main trunks, they are no longer available for use as venous bypass grafts in the future (coronary or leg artery vital disease).

==== Other ====
Other surgical treatments are:
* CHIVA method (ambulatory conservative haemodynamic correction of venous insufficiency) is a relatively low-invasive surgical technique that incorporates venous hemodynamics and preserves the superficial venous system. The overall effectiveness compared to stripping, radiofrequency ablation treatment, or endovenous laser therapy is not clear and there is no strong evidence to suggest that CHIVA is superior to stripping, radiofrequency ablation, or endovenous laser therapy for recurrence of varicose veins. There is some low-certainty evidence that CHIVA may result in more bruising compared to radiofrequency ablation treatment.
* Vein ligation is done at the saphenofemoral junction after ligating the tributaries at the saphenofemoral junction without stripping the long saphenous vein, provided the perforator veins are competent and DVT is absent in the deep veins. With this method, the long saphenous vein is preserved.
* Cryosurgery – A cryoprobe is passed down the long saphenous vein following saphenofemoral ligation. The probe is then cooled with NO2 or CO2 to −85°F. The vein freezes to the probe and can be retrogradely stripped after 5 seconds of freezing. It is a variant of stripping. The only purpose of this technique is to avoid a distal incision to remove the stripper.

==== Sclerotherapy ====
A commonly performed non-surgical treatment for varicose and &quot;spider leg veins&quot; is sclerotherapy, in which medicine called a sclerosant is injected into the veins to make them shrink. The medicines that are commonly used as sclerosants are polidocanol (POL branded Asclera in the United States, Aethoxysklerol in Australia), sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STS), Sclerodex (Canada), hypertonic saline, glycerin and chromated glycerin. STS (branded Fibrovein in Australia) liquids can be mixed at varying concentrations of sclerosant and varying sclerosant/gas proportions, with air or CO2 or O2 to create foams. Foams may allow more veins to be treated per session with comparable efficacy. Their use in contrast to liquid sclerosant is still somewhat controversial, and there is no clear evidence that foams are superior. Sclerotherapy has been used in the treatment of varicose veins for over 150 years. Sclerotherapy is often used for telangiectasias (spider veins) and varicose veins that persist or recur after vein stripping. Sclerotherapy can also be performed using foamed sclerosants under ultrasound guidance to treat larger varicose veins, including the great saphenous and small saphenous veins.

There is some evidence that sclerotherapy is a safe and possibly effective treatment option for improving the cosmetic appearance, reducing residual varicose veins, improving the quality of life, and reducing symptoms that may be present due to the varicose veins. There is also weak evidence that this treatment option may have a slightly higher risk of deep vein thrombosis. It is not known if sclerotherapy decreases the chance of varicose veins returning (recurrent varicose veins). It is also not known which type of substance (liquid or foam) used for the sclerotherapy procedure is more effective and comes with the lowest risk of complications.

Complications of sclerotherapy are rare, but can include blood clots and ulceration. Anaphylactic reactions are &quot;extraordinarily rare but can be life-threatening,&quot; and doctors should have resuscitation equipment ready. There has been one reported case of stroke after ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy when an unusually large dose of sclerosant foam was injected.

==== Endovenous thermal ablation ====

There are three kinds of endovenous thermal ablation treatment possible: laser, radiofrequency, and steam.

The Australian Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) in 2008 determined that endovenous laser treatment/ablation (ELA) for varicose veins &quot;appears to be more effective in the short term, and at least as effective overall, as the comparative procedure of junction ligation and vein stripping for the treatment of varicose veins.&quot; It also found in its assessment of available literature, that &quot;occurrence rates of more severe complications such as DVT, nerve injury, and paraesthesia, post-operative infections, and haematomas, appears to be greater after ligation and stripping than after EVLT&quot;. Complications for ELA include minor skin burns (0.4%) and temporary paresthesia (2.1%). The longest study of endovenous laser ablation is 39 months.

Two prospective randomized trials found speedier recovery and fewer complications after radiofrequency ablation (ERA) compared to open surgery. Myers wrote that open surgery for small saphenous vein reflux is obsolete. Myers said these veins should be treated with endovenous techniques, citing high recurrence rates after surgical management, and risk of nerve damage up to 15%. By comparison ERA has been shown to control 80% of cases of small saphenous vein reflux at 4 years, said Myers. Complications for ERA include burns, paraesthesia, clinical phlebitis and slightly higher rates of deep vein thrombosis (0.57%) and pulmonary embolism (0.17%). One 3-year study compared ERA, with a recurrence rate of 33%, to open surgery, which had a recurrence rate of 23%.

Steam treatment consists in injection of pulses of steam into the sick vein. This treatment which works with a natural agent (water) has results similar to laser or radiofrequency. The steam presents a lot of post-operative advantages for the patient (good aesthetic results, less pain, etc.) Steam is a very promising treatment for both doctors (easy introduction of catheters, efficient on recurrences, ambulatory procedure, easy and economic procedure) and patients (less post-operative pain, a natural agent, fast recovery to daily activities).

ELA and ERA require specialized training for doctors and special equipment. ELA is performed as an outpatient procedure and does not require an operating theatre, nor does the patient need a general anaesthetic. Doctors use high-frequency ultrasound during the procedure to visualize the anatomical relationships between the saphenous structures.

Some practitioners also perform phlebectomy or ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy at the time of endovenous treatment. This is also known as an ambulatory phlebectomy. The distal veins are removed following the complete ablation of the proximal vein. This treatment is most commonly used for varicose veins off of the great saphenous vein, small saphenous vein, and pudendal veins. Follow-up treatment to smaller branch varicose veins is often needed in the weeks or months after the initial procedure.

==== Medical Adhesive ====
Also called medical super glue, medical adhesive is an advanced non-surgical treatment for varicose veins during which a solution is injected into the diseased vein through a small catheter and under the assistance of ultrasound-guided imagery. The &quot;super glue&quot; solution is made of cyanoacrylate, aiming at sealing the vein and rerouting the blood flow to other healthy veins.

Post-treatment, the body will naturally absorb the treated vein which will disappear. Involving only a small incision and no hospital stay, medical super glue has generated great interest within the last years, with a success rate of about 96.8%.

A follow-up consultation is required after this treatment, just like any other one, in order to re-assess the diseased vein and further treat it if needed.

==== Echotherapy Treatment ====
In the field of varicose veins, the latest medical innovation is high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy (HIFU). This method is completely non-invasive and is not necessarily performed in an operating room, unlike existing techniques. This is because the procedure involves treating from outside the body, able to penetrate the skin without damage, to treat the veins in a targeted area. This leaves no scars and allows the patient to return to their daily life immediately.

==Epidemiology==
Varicose veins are most common after age 50. It is more prevalent in females. There is a hereditary role. It has been seen in smokers, those who have chronic constipation, and in people with occupations which necessitate long periods of standing such as wait staff, nurses, conductors (musical and bus), stage actors, umpires (cricket, javelin, etc.), the King&#x27;s guards, lectern orators, security guards, traffic police officers, vendors, surgeons, etc.
